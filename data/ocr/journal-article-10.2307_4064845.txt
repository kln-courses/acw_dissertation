The Range and Co-occurrence of the Shiners Notropis analostanus and N. spilopterus in Southeastern Pennsylvania RICHARD J. HORWITZ Division of Environmental Research Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia l9th and the Parkway, Philadelphia, PA 19103 ABSTRACT.-Changes in the distributions of Notropis analostanus and N. spilopterus in the lower Delaware River Basin were analyzed by reexamination of older collections and comparison with recent distributions. N. spilopterus was present in the Brandywine and Schuylkill Basins by 1905, but was overlooked' in earlier faunal studies. Up to 1926, it was restricted to these basins, but it has since expanded its range to include much of the area. Although N. analostanus was found in the same basins with N. spilopterus before 1926, the two rarely occurred together in the same collection. However, since 1946, the two species have been found together significantly more often; they co- occur commonly in smaller creeks, and less frequently in the larger rivers. Though replaced by N. spilopterus in a few places, N. analostanus remains common and may only recently have colonized the mainstems of Brandywine Creek and the Schuylkill River. These changes are most plausibly explained by increased human development of the area; siltation and other accompanying effects of development have likely directly or indirectly benefitted these relatively tolerant species. [collections, Delaware River Basin, distribution, ecology, Notropis, Pisces, shiners] Contraction or expansion of species ranges over historical time is a common phenomenon. These changes are often re- lated to human impact, such as direct intro- ductions, hunting or fishing, changes in habitat, destruction or creation of barriers to dispersal, and introductions of predators or other species. Other cases, such as the expansion of species into formerly glaciat- ed areas (cf. Radforth 1944), may be related to climatic changes rather than human dis- turbance. In this paper, I discuss changes in the distribution of two closely related species of minnow, the spotfin shiner, No- tropis spilopterus, and the satinfin shiner, N. analostanus, in the lower Delaware Riv- er drainage of Pennsylvania. This appraisal is based on reexamination of collections in the Academy of Natural Sciences of Phila- delphia and on new material. N. spilopterus is found over much of northeastern U.S. (Lee et al. 1980), includ- ing much of the range of N. analostanus, which occurs in Atlantic drainages from New York to North Carolina. N. analos- tanus is closely related (Gibbs 1963) to the steelcolor shiner, N. whipplei, which oc- curs in the Ohio and Mississippi drainages. Currently, both N. spilopterus and N. an- alostanus are common in southeastern Pennsylvania, often occurring together. However, earlier accounts (Cope 1869, 1881; Abbott 1874; Bean 1892; Fowler 1940) listed only N. analostanus from the area. This study was undertaken to determine whether N. spilopterus is a recent invader or whether it was overlooked in earlier col- lections, and to trace changes in the distri- butions of these species by comparison of recent and historical occurrence at the same sites and by new collections in the area. THE STUDY AREA The study was limited to the lower Del- aware Valley of Pennsylvania (Fig. 1). Sup- plemental information was compiled on ad- 178</page><page sequence="2">NOTROPIS ANALOSTANUS AND N.

The Piedmont streams are generally of moderate to high gradient, and are rocky with pools of sand and silt. Streams along the Fall Line are especially steep and rocky, dropping sharply into the Coastal Plain, which has low-gradient streams with fine substrates. The Delaware and Schuylkill rivers are tidal below the Fall Line and es- tuarine below Philadelphia. The Upper Schuylkill River extends into the Ridge and Valley Province. The area along the Delaware is almost completely urban below the Fall Line; the</page><page sequence="3">180 RICHARD J. HORWITZ urban and suburban area extends about 8 to 15 kilometers inland from the river. The remainder of the area is primarily agricul- tural, with a number of small towns and developments. The area along the Dela- ware River below Trenton, the Schuylkill River in Reading and Philadelphia, and parts of the lower Brandywine Creek are heavily industrial. Municipal and industrial pollu- tion has been severe in these reaches, es- pecially in the period 1940-1960. Large parts of the Delaware near Philadelphia were typ- ically anoxic for parts of the summers dur- ing this time (Kiry 1974). SOURCES OF DATA Because of the close similarity of the two species, published records are question- able. Thus, the primary source of historical information on the status of the two species is preserved material. The collections of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadel- phia were used for determination of histor- ical range. These include a number of col- lections made by H. W. Fowler and others from 1898 to 1926 and 3 collections made by Fowler between 1926 and 1946. Fow- ler's collections were made by 1 or 2 peo- ple, presumably using small seines. These collections are generally small, usually con- taining less than 10 individuals of the two study species (Fowler apparently only kept a fraction of his total catch). Locality data are imprecise (stream and town names only), but are usually adequate to locate sites within a kilometer. A few localities are un- locatable, because of vague data or changed place names. A few specimens predate 1898, but these have very vague locality data and cannot be dated precisely. These are the usual problems with older material: collections are small and biased to smaller, rarer, and difficult to identify fishes, making it nearly impossible to draw conclusions about relative abundance and to interpret absence from collections at a locality. However, these problems do not affect conclusions about the status of the two shiners with respect to each other. Fowler did not separate the two species in southeastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey or Delaware (he did in other areas). He cata- logued lots of both species as N. analos- tanus or N. whipplei analostanus. Thus, preserved specimens should be an accurate index of catch proportions. Both species are readily caught by small seines and there is no apparent difference in catchability. These species are represented at a large number of his sites, suggesting that a few were kept from most collections. Thus, while these records do not allow assessment of the abundance of these species relative to the rest of the fauna, they do indicate that one or the other was widespread and allow a reconstruction of their distribution relative to each other. Later material includes several collec- tions made between 1956 and 1971, princi- pally in the larger rivers (the Schuylkill, Delaware and Brandywine). Each was tak- en by seines (2.5 m x 1.1 m, and 7.7 m x 1.1 m, with 6.4 mm mesh). Samples cov- ered several hundred meters, including a variety of microhabitats. These collections are relatively large, contain all specimens collected and have precise locality data. All specimens in these samples identified as either species were examined and identi- fied. A few specimens catalogued with oth- er species were also identified and com- piled. Published studies on fish distribution in Perkiomen Creek (Molzahn 1972) and the Delaware River near Bristol (Anselmini 1971) were used as supplementary sources. These samples, taken with large seines and trawls, are very large, well-tabulated and have precise locality data. Examination of some of the specimens from these surveys indicated that these studies are reliable in- dicators of present-day co-occurrences, al- though proportions of the two species are not always accurate.</page><page sequence="4">NOTROPIS ANALOSTANUS AND N.

From 1976 to 1981, I made a number of collections in the study area. All N. spilop- terus or N. analostanus were preserved for laboratory identification. These samples were usually taken with small seines (2 m x 1.7 m; 5 m x 1.7 m) with mesh sizes of 3.2 or 6.4 mm. Some additional collections were made with cast net or electroshocker. At each locality, about .25 to .50 km was sam- pled. Twenty-seven sites from which either species was taken prior to 1926 were resam- pled, as well as a number of new sites. Re- cent samples were made at the most likely sites for the earlier samples based on ac- cess, existing roads at the time of the earlier surveys, etc. Although major seasonal movements are not recorded for either species, their distri- butions might change with season, so that differences in sampling times might affect conclusions on distribution and co-occur- rence. In the two periods, 1898-1945 and 1946-1981, most collections were made from April through September (75% and 69%, re- spectively); however, samples were con- centrated in different periods. The pre-1946 samples were taken primarily in April and July (34%), while the post 1945 samples were taken largely in September and Oc- tober (46%). However, there is no apparent relationship between season and occur- rence or co-occurrence of the two species: comparisons showed small, statistically in- significant differences between seasons. Thus, the difference in sampling dates does not appear to affect the conclusions of the analyses. MORPHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS The characteristics separating the two species are summarized in Table 1 (cf. Hubbs and Lagler 1958). The best charac- ters are the number of anal rays (about 10- 15% of the individuals of each species over- lap the modal count of the other; see below) and the pigment in the dorsal fin. The range of dorsal pigmentation in the two species overlaps to some extent, but are almost al- ways distinct within age and sex classes. Adult males of both species have black pig- ment throughout the interradial membranes of all rays. However, in small (less than 60 mm standard length) and nonbreeding male N. spilopterus the pigment in the anterior</page><page sequence="5">182 RICHARD J. HORWITZ membranes (especially anterior to the third ray) is less intense than that in the posterior rays. Furthermore, the pigment is concen- trated in the distal part of the posterior membranes in N. spilopterus, whereas it is nearly uniform or concentrated in the mid- dle of the rays in N. analostanus. The pig- ment in the anterior membranes of N. an- alostanus often appears as long dashes, while that in N. spilopterus usually appears as spots. Adult female and large juvenile (greater than 35 mm s.l.) N. spilopterus have much spotting in the distal part of the pos- terior membranes (behind the sixth and seventh rays), no pigment basally or ante- rior to the third ray, and very few to a mod- erate number of spots behind the third, fourth and fifth rays. Analogous N. analos- tanus have almost no pigment in front of the third ray, but pigment occurs in all parts of the remaining membranes. N. spilopte- rus between about 25 and 35 mm have pig- ment like that of adult females, only more reduced-there are a few distal spots be- hind the sixth and seventh rays, none or very few behind the fifth, and none else- where. N. analostanus in this size range also have reduced pigmentation, but it oc- curs between all posterior rays (third through seventh), with considerable pig- ment behind the fifth, sixth and seventh, and the pigment occurs uniformly over the basal and distal parts of the fin. Juvenile N. spilopterus less than about 25 mm show no dorsal pigmentation or only a few distal spots behind the sixth ray. Juvenile N. an- alostanus between 20 and 30 mm show a few spots in all parts of the posterior mem- branes (third through seventh, most distinct behind fifth and sixth); these occur basally and distally. Below about 20 mm neither species shows any dorsal pigmentation. DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS DISTRIBUTION BEFORE 1898. In a synop- sis of Pennsylvania cyprinids, Cope (1869) lists N. analostanus (as Hypsilepis kentuk- iensis, the identification with N. analosta- nus indicated by the description and synon- ymy) occurring in the area in the Delaware River near Trenton and from the Schuylkill drainage (probably in small tributaries of the Schuylkill) at Philadelphia and Consho- hocken. His description most closely fits N. analostanus (the scale count is that of N. analostanus, though it could include some N. spilopterus; anal counts are not given; other characters fit either species). There are 3 lots of a total of 21 specimens of N. analostanus in the ANSP collection from before 1898 taken in or near Philadelphia. These may include some of the fish referred to by Cope. Cope described N. spilopterus from Michigan, but he may have over- looked N. spilopterus in Pennsylvania. He stated that H. kentukiensis (sic) was com- mon in the Ohio tributaries, presumably of Pennsylvania. Neither N. analostanus nor N. whipplei now occur in these drainages in Pennsylvania, so these probably refer to misidentified N. spilopterus. Similarly, N. spilopterus may have been present in southeastern Pennsylvania and was either confused with the more widespread N. an- alostanus or was not found in areas sam- pled by Cope (based on later distribution, N. analostanus would be the likely species in Cope's sites). DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN 1898 AND 1945. Both species occurred in the area in this period (Fig. 2, Table 2); one or the other was found in virtually all but the smallest creeks. N. spilopterus was found in only two drainages: (1) Brandywine Creek and its small tributaries; and (2) the Schuylkill River, including Perkiomen Creek and quarry ponds in the drainage. N. analos- tanus occurred in every major basin. How- ever, the two species were found together in only one locality, the mouth of a tiny tributary of Brandywine Creek in which ju- veniles of both species were collected. N. analostanus was found nowhere else in the Brandywine drainage, although it was col-</page><page sequence="6">NOTROPIS ANALOSTANUS AND N. SPILOPTERUS 183 FIG. 2. Distributional records, 1898-1945.

In the Schuylkill Basin, only N. spi- lopterus was collected in the mainstem (however, there are only 8 specimens from the mainstem); both species occurred in the tributaries, but the two were never collect- ed together. DISTRIBUTION FROM 1945 TO PRESENT. N. spilopterus has spread considerably since 1945 (Fig. 3, Table 2). It is now found throughout the region, though it is absent from several tributaries. N. analostanus is now found in the mainstem of Brandywine Creek and Schuylkill River. Of 33 localities sampled after 1960 at which either species was caught, both species were collected to- gether in 18. Of the 5 sites in which only N. spilopterus was found, 3 were in drain- ages in which it was not known to occur at all before 1945. Data from Molzahn (1972) on distribution in the Perkiomen indicates that the 2 species occurred together at 9 of 12 additional sites, although N. analosta- nus was rare in several of these. N. ana- lostanus was the only member of the pair captured in the Perkiomen prior to 1946. Collections made between 1946 and 1960 are largely limited to the larger rivers. Of 15 localities, the two species occurred to- gether in 5, and only N. spilopterus was found at 8 sites, all in the main Brandywine or Schuylkill in which it was present before 1945.

Thus, the ab- sence of N. spilopterus in pre-1946 samples from much of the area is not definitive. However, it was clearly rare, if it occurred at all: 430 specimens of N. analostanus and no N. spilopterus were caught from drain- ages east of the Schuylkill. If all captures are considered independent, the 99% con- fidence interval of the proportion of N. an- alostanus in these drainages is .985 to 1.00. In any case, the proportions of the two species have changed since 1945. These changes are tested two ways, by comparing sites in which collections exist from both periods and by comparing totals for each subdrainage (Table 2). Fisher's exact test (Brownlee 1965) was performed for each site and basin to test the significance of ob- served changes over time. Twenty seven sites were resurveyed; 4 (with obvious pol- lution) had neither species. Fifteen had only N. analostanus prior to 1946; of these, 9 had both species after 1945 (5 significantly different, 1 untestable, since the propor- tions of the two species in the samples were unobtainable), 4 still had only N. analos- tanus and 2 had only N. spilopterus (both significantly different). The one site which</page><page sequence="9">186 RICHARD J. HORWITZ had both species prior to 1946 had both species in 1981, with the proportion not sig- nificantly different. Of 5 sites with only N. spilopterus before 1946, 3 had both species (1 significantly different), and 2 still had only N. spilopterus. In addition, 2 sites at which only one specimen of N. analostanus was preserved in earlier samples were resam- pled. One still had only N. analostanus, and the other had both species. Thus, sites which originally had only N. spilopterus had either N. spilopterus or both species, but the changes were not statistically signifi- cant in most cases. A number of sites in small creeks which originally had only N. analostanus still had only N. analostanus. The remainder had both species or had shifted to solely N. spilopterus; most of these changes were statistically significant. Of 20 sites on which tests could be per- formed, 5 had changed significantly from N. analostanus to both species, 1 from N. analostanus to N. spilopterus and 1 from N. spilopterus to both species. The changes were more striking when compared by subdrainage. Of the 17 sub- drainages, 4 had only N. analostanus in both periods; 10 showed significant increases in the formerly rarer or absent species. There are almost no collections made be- tween 1926 and 1960 outside of the Schuylkill and Brandywine, so the exact time and rate of spread cannot be deter- mined. One N. spilopterus was captured in 1946 in Tohickon Creek, at the northeast- ern corner of the area. If the spread oc- curred from the original areas in the Schuylkill or Brandywine and up the Del- aware this would suggest that the species occurred over much of the area by 1946. However, it is possible that N. spilopterus entered the Tohickon from outside the area, e.g., from the upper Delaware River or from nearby tributaries of the Perkiomen. CO-OCCURRENCE. The two species now occur syntopically much more frequently than before. Before 1946, only one collec- tion contained both species, although they did occur in the same drainages. Currently, both species are often found together. There is significantly greater co-occur- rence in recent than historical collections. To test this, I compiled the 17 pre-1946 samples from drainages in which both species were taken (Schuylkill, including the Perkiomen, and Brandywine) and in which more than one specimen was preserved. Sample sizes ranged from 2 to 21, with a mean of 8.2 individuals per sample. Recent collections include samples with many more individuals, which are more likely to have both species. To adjust for this, I used a subset of the later samples which has a range and mean number of individuals per sample comparable to those of the earlier samples. The 29 samples containing between 2 and 17 individuals had a mean of 8.0 individuals per sample; this subset was used for com- parison with earlier samples. Of the 29, 9 had both species; this is significantly great- er (p = .047, Fishers exact test, one-tailed) than the proportion (1/17) in collections made before 1946. (The result is unchanged if other subsets of recent samples are used; e.g. both species occur in 11 of 31 of the recent samples with 2-18 individuals, mean of 8.6; this is significantly different from pre- 1946 co-occurrence: p = .023). In recent samples, there is a difference in co-occurrence in the larger rivers (Del- aware, Schuylkill, and Brandywine) and the smaller creeks and runs. For example, of 9 small samples in the Brandywine and its major branches, 8 had only one species (N. analostanus in 1, N. spilopterus in 8). Sev- eral moderate or large samples from several sites in the Schuylkill contained only N. spilopterus; another sample from one of the same sites at a different time was 99% N. analostanus. The difference between co- occurrence in large and small creeks is sta- tistically significant: 17 of 22 samples taken after 1945 from the smaller creeks had both species, while only 4 of 28 samples from</page><page sequence="10">NOTROPIS ANALOSTANUS AND N. SPILOPTERUS 187 the larger rivers had both (X2 = 17.6, p &lt; .005). These two sets have similar range and mean sample size; the mean number of in- dividuals per sample was 43.0 for the small creeks and 42.6 for the large rivers; the range was 6-207 for the small creeks and 5-232 for the large rivers (7 samples with 2 to 4 individuals from the larger rivers were deleted from this analysis to produce com- parable means and ranges of sample size; the difference is still significant if these are included). ANAL RAY COUNTS The stability of the distribution of anal ray counts of N. spilopterus and N. ana- lostanus following the spread of the former was investigated. An increase in the fre- quency of 8 rays in N. spilopterus or 9 rays in N. analostanus following co-occurrence in a locality or subbasin might indicate in- trogression from hybridization. Anal ray count appears to be correlated with habitat in many groups: species with fewer rays are often more benthic or found in faster water than species with more rays. Thus, diver- gence in anal ray counts might indicate evo- lution toward increased habitat separation. Comparisons showed no differentiation in frequencies of anal ray counts within subdrainages, but there were statistically significant differences between subdrain- ages or groups of subdrainages (Table 3). These differences showed no consistent spatial or temporal patterns. While frequen- cies in subdrainages before and after 1945 were only weakly correlated (r2 = .19 for N. analostanus), there was almost no change in overall frequencies between the two periods. There was no apparent rela- tionship between overall frequencies in either species and presence or absence of the other species. If anal ray count is re- sponsive to environmental conditions in early development, a number of factors (e.g., interyear local climatic variation, variation in survival of age-classes or early or late spawn within the population) could result in the counts from individuals within single subdrainages being correlated at any one time yet somewhat variable over time. In making these comparisons, the infre- quent extreme counts (6 or 7 rays in N. spilopterus, 10 or 11 rays in N. analosta- nus) were grouped with the species mode. Sample sizes do not always match those in preceding sections, since some anal counts were indeterminate because of deformation of the fin or deterioration of the specimen. Proportions were compared using the x2 test for homogeneity or Fisher's exact test where the x2 approximation was invalid. There were no significant differences in frequen- cies between different collections from the same subdrainage, so these were com- bined. Samples from adjacent subdrainages were also combined in some cases where sample sizes from the single units were too small for individual analysis. The frequencies of anal counts were compared at individual subdrainages sam- pled both before and after 1946. There were no significant differences between frequen- cies for either species. However, combined samples from some subdrainages did show significant differences for N. analostanus. The far eastern subdrainages (Delaware River, Tohickon, Pidcock, Haugh's, Tul- leytown, Scott, and Mill creeks) had an overall modal frequency of .82 before 1946 and .92 after (x2 = 7.1, p &lt; .01); the far western subdrainages (Brandywine, Red Clay, White Clay, Darby and Chester creeks) had a modal frequency of 1.0 before 1926 and .88 after (p = &lt;.001 Fisher's ex- act test). There were, however, no signifi- cant overall differences in frequencies in the two periods for either species. No relationship between syntopy and anal count was noted by any of several analyses.

The frequencies of allotopic and syn- topic samples are usually very similar. No significant difference in modal frequency was found for either species using unpaired t-tests (on all subdrainages), paired t-tests (on subdrainages with both syntopic and al- lotopic sites), or x2 tests on contingency ta- bles. Since differentiation might not occur within basins, a second classification of al- lotopy and syntopy was used: subdrainages in which only one species occurred were considered allotopic, and subdrainages in which both occurred (even if never at the same site) were considered syntopic. Again, frequencies were very similar in allotopic and syntopic subdrainages. HYBRIDIZATION Natural hybridization might occur, given the close similarity and frequent co-occur- rence of the two species. Pflieger (1965) de- termined that N. spilopterus and N. whip- plei were interfertile. He also observed natural hybridization in one spawning ag- gregation. In this study, one possible hy- brid between N. spilopterus and N. ana- lostanus was collected at the mouth of Harvey Run, a small tributary of the Bran- dywine containing both parent species. The fish is 41.0 mm in standard length. The anal count (8 rays), shape, and pigmentation of the lateral band are typical of N. spilopte- rus; the number of scales in the lateral se- ries (36 + 4 unpored peduncular scales) is intermediate. The pigmentation of the dor- sal fin is also intermediate, though most like that of N. analostanus. There is consider- able pigment in all interradial membranes behind the third ray, as in N. analostanus, but this pigment is largely in the medial and distal portions of each membrane and is nearly absent from the proximal part. DISCUSSION Any explanation for the distribution of the two species must account for the pat- terns demonstrated above: N. spilopterus has spread over much of the area since 1926 (though it cannot be determined whether it was native); before 1926, the two species rarely occurred together; currently, they co- occur frequently, typically in the smaller creeks and less commonly in the large rivers and creeks. Additionally, N. analostanus may occur in the main stem of the large rivers (Schuylkill and Brandywine) with N. spilopterus only since 1926. Although N. analostanus was not recorded from these rivers before 1926, the sample sizes are low (23 individuals) and no differences can be shown. One explanation for the spread of N. spi- lopterus is that it only recently entered the lower Delaware drainage (naturally or by human introduction). In the simplest form of this hypothesis, the spread may have oc- curred independently of any other change in aquatic conditions: the area has long been suitable, and the difference in distribution and co-occurrence during the two periods reflects two stages of the species' expansion into formerly inaccessible areas. While there are several indications of relatively recent introduction, I will argue that the major ex- pansion into the area depended on changes in aquatic conditions related to increasing human development of the drainage. Based on the systematics and current dis- tribution of N. spilopterus and related species, N. spilopterus is generally consid- ered to be of Midwestern origin, entering the Susquehanna drainage via the Genesee system (Gibbs 1957). The Susquehanna is the likely source of the Delaware popula- tions, possibly via small tributaries which currently closely approach the Brandywine and Schuylkill tributaries. N. spilopterus was first recorded in the lower Delaware from the western subbasins adjacent to these</page><page sequence="13">190 RICHARD J. HORWITZ Susquehanna tributaries. In 1935 surveys of the upper Delaware and Susquehanna drainages in New York, Greeley (1936) did not find N. spilopterus in the Delaware or eastern-most Susquehanna headwaters, al- though it was widespread in the western part of the Susquehanna drainage. The Susque- hanna has a much larger primary freshwa- ter fish fauna than the Delaware (Gilbert 1980; Lee et al. 1980; Fowler 1940; ANSP collections), suggesting that natural dis- persal from the Susquehanna to the Dela- ware may be infrequent. These consider- ations suggest that N. spilopterus is of recent occurrence in the area relative to most of the fauna, which is presumed to have been in Atlantic coastal streams dur- ing and since the last glaciation. Since N. spilopterus was collected in the area in the earliest comprehensive samples, there is no way of dating its introduction more pre- cisely, e.g., to post-settlement time. However recent its introduction, the dif- ference in patterns of co-occurrence with N. analostanus before and after 1946 indi- cates that the expansion of N. spilopterus is not simply an invasion of areas formerly accessible only to N. analostanus. If it were, one would expect early occurrences of N. spilopterus to be centered on the sites of introduction. In these areas where it oc- curred, one would expect it to be caught with N. analostanus as often or more often than in later records. In fact, in the pre-1946 samples, N. spilopterus was collected in widely separated parts of the Schuylkill and Brandywine drainages, but almost never with N. analostanus. It is more plausible that the expansion of N. spilopterus reflects a response to chang- ing aquatic conditions (whether it was long native to the area or only recently intro- duced): habitat changes increased the amount of suitable habitat for N. spilopte- rus. This could simultaneously explain the changes in the pattern of co-occurrence and the spread of the species. Unfortunately, the spread of the species obscures the hab- itat preferences that may have produced it. The time lag between habitat change and dispersal from the original range and the chance nature of dispersal would weaken any correlation of habitat with presence and absence of the species. In fact there are no clear correlations between ecological and biogeographic factors and the streams N. spilopterus has and has not colonized. Most of the streams from which N. spilopterus has not been taken are small, rocky tribu- taries (e.g., West Branch Chester Creek, Ridley Creek, Pidcock Creek). However, several, like White Clay, Darby, and Mill Creeks, are moderately large, and include a wide range of habitats. There are no ap- parent differences in the available habitats in these creeks and those in which N. spi- lopterus is abundant. Several of the creeks which do not have N. spilopterus have dams which might act as barriers to colonization, but several appear unimpeded, and N. spi- lopterus does occur in some streams with equally restrictive dams (it may have been introduced to these by bait-bucket release). Distribution within basins of co-occur- rence is more informative. The limited in- formation on habitat conditions in the ear- lier samples, the frequency of co-occurrence in recent samples, and the general similar- ity of habitats precludes statistical analysis of preference, but N. spilopterus appears to occur most commonly in the pools or runs of the larger rivers and in the slower creeks like the Northeast Branch of the Perkiomen and some Tohickon tributaries. N. analostanus appears most common in riffles and runs of larger rivers and in small, steep, rocky creeks and runs. Thus, N. spi- lopterus typically occurs in warmer, siltier, slower and more turbid water than N. an- alostanus, though both species are tolerant of these conditions. If these preferences are real, the spread of N. spilopterus may have resulted from the tremendous increase in urban and sub-</page><page sequence="14">NOTROPIS ANALOSTANUS AND N. SPILOPTERUS 191 urban development in the area. This has resulted in increased siltation, leading to obvious changes in turbidity and sedimen- tation. Increased nutrient loading, leading to increased plankton densities, also in- creases turbidity. Given the habitat pref- erences described above, these changes would encourage the spread of N. spilop- terus. Whereas, high turbidity and siltation were formerly typical principally of the large, slow rivers, the increased sediment load has created silty, turbid pools in many smaller creeks as well. Thus, these changes would explain the increased co-existence: N. spilopterus now finds suitable habitat in some part of most small streams, causing it to occur in close proximity to N. analos- tanus. The greater frequency of co-occurrence in the smaller creeks is plausibly due to the larger habitat patches in the larger rivers. If habitat partitioning occurs, large areas of large rivers may have only one species. In small creeks, individuals may wander rath- er frequently into nearby non preferred habitats. Furthermore, equal-sized samples (in number of individuals or area sampled) from small creks will more likely cover a number of patches, while samples from rivers may be confined to a single large patch. In small creeks, riffle or run species may flee to nearby pools and be captured with the typical pool species; in rivers, rif- fles are longer and fish may use escape be- havior which does not bring them in contact with species of the other habitat. (This also emphasizes the difficulty of demonstrating the preferences: the two species are very hard to distinguish during in situ observa- tion, and collections may disrupt normal occurrence.) Any or all of these processes may cause the observed patterns. The changes which allowed the spread of N. spilopterus may have had a negative, neutral, or positive effect on N. analosta- nus. If the areas which N. spilopterus in- vaded had originally been used by N. an- alostanus, the spread of N. spilopterus may have been detrimental to N. analostanus. The several sites formerly containing N. analostanus and now containing only N. spilopterus primarily or exclusively may be examples. An apparent extreme situation is the creation of slow backwaters behind dams. For instance, Haycock Creek is part- ly inundated by a dam-created lake; a site at the edge of the flowage now contains only N. spilopterus. If the newly colonized habitats of N. spi- lopterus had not been used by N. analos- tanus, the spread might have no effect. Giv- en the close similarity of the two species and absence of well-defined habitat sepa- ration, this seems unlikely. The shift to N. spilopterus in areas which formerly had only N. analostanus raises the possibility of eventual widespread exclu- sion. Perhaps the observed co-occurrence elsewhere is only a transient phenomenon. However, there is no clear evidence of de- crease in N. analostanus in most of the area. N. analostanus is still abundant in the ba- sins in which N. spilopterus has been pres- ent the longest, the Brandywine and Schuylkill. It is possible that the habitat changes had positive effects on N. analostanus which might compensate any negative effects of the spread of N. spilopterus. Since they lay adhesive eggs on the underside of rocks and logs, the reproductive success of both species is much less sensitive to siltation than that of many other species. The loss of vegetation and decreases of gravel beds may have no effect or open new areas to both. Both are able to take food from the surface and are probably less sensitive to decreases in autochthonous production than other species. Production may actually have increased in some of the moderately affect- ed streams due to increased input of nu- trients. Though still common in some areas, predatory species have generally declined in the area through increased fishing pres-</page><page sequence="15">192 RICHARD J. HORWITZ sure and the same changes which are hy- pothesized to affect the other species. This decline may have increased survival and densities of forage species like N. spilop- terus and N. analostanus. Thus, N. ana- lostanus may have expanded into new areas as well. The recent colonization of the Brandywine and Schuylkill mainstreams by that species (if real) might be an example of this. It would be difficult to explain this expansion without some positive effect on N. analostanus. Any increase in reproduc- tive success, growth or survival of one or both species might lead to an increase of "surplus" individuals moving into less-fa- vored areas contributing to the increased recent coexistence. Thus, the most plausible explanations for the distributional patterns of the two species are based on widespread, anthropomorphic changes in aquatic habitats which have in- creased the amount of suitable habitat for N. spilopterus, allowing it to spread over most of the area. The widespread occur- rence of suitable habitat in smaller creeks has brought it into close contact with N. analostanus, increasing the frequency of joint capture. In a few places, this spread has probably been detrimental to N. ana- lostanus, but over the rest of the area, ben- efits to N. analostanus from the habitat changes and resultant changes in commu- nity structure-decline of predators, pos- sible declines of competitors, changes in system productivity, etc.-may have more than compensated for any detrimental ef- fects from N. spilopterus. These changes may have caused greater reproductive suc- cess, growth and survival for both species as well as increasing the amount of suitable habitat.
