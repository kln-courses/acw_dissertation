<plain_text><page sequence="1">A SYNCRETIC ICON" by J. S. NIGAM, M. A. The icon under study here is from the collections of the Central Museum, Nagpur. The label records that the piece is from a place known as Bhāndaka in Chāndā District (Mahārāstra). It has been dated to c. 11th Cent. A. D. The data, on stylistic and other grounds will be discussed below, however, does not confirm the above record. The description of the sculputure is as follows (fig. I et 2). The pedestal constituting the lower part, consists of an argha or yoni, 14 cm. high (2) with the longitudinal axis and the width 67 cm. and 58 cm. respectively. The thickness of the side walls around is 5 cm. The pīļha is solid. Its upper surface is sloping towards the perifery and results in a groove which is 2. 5 cm. deep from the top of the sides. This is to prevent splitting of water outside the argha . The plfha or argha has a chaneled spout which is also termed as water coarse or naia for the discharge of the water offered by the devotees The external width of the spout is 16 cm. A damaged head of a bull ( nandi ) is projecting on the left side of the yoni . The height of nandVs head is 8 cm. and it is 6. 5 cm. wide. The bull and the yoni are carved in the same piece of stone slab as all other members i. e. the whole sculpture. Above the argha almost in the centre, in place of usual liňga , one finds a hurma or tortoise with all the four attributes viz., gada , cakra , padma and áaňkha. The tortoise is facing towards the water coarse. The face is no doubt broken. The back of the tortoise is ellipsoid. The major axis and the minor axis (from front to back and right to left) measures 28 cm. and 25 cm. respectively. The maximum height in the centre is 10. 5 cm. and on the perifery the top slopes and retains a heigt of 7 cm. only. The sides of the tortoise are flaring rather vertical. It holds in the left and right for limbs the gadā and the śankha. The lower ends of both the gadā and śańkha are broken. Their available length is 22 cm. and 5 cm. respectively. The left and right lower limbs carry the cakra and the padma. The diameter of the cakra or the wheel is 8 cm. and the padma or lotus with its stalk measures 14 cm. These detailed (1) The term icon has been preferred since the piece must have been enshirined in the garbha-grha of a temple as inferred from the usual installation of pītha and linga. (2) The height where the bull is projecting is 13 cm. only.</page><page sequence="2">74 J. S. NIGAM measurements of each member have been given to confirm or contradict sanctions in iconographie or iconometric texts if available. A detailed description of the āijudlias is given below. An anti-clockwise order starting from the left forelimb has been followed (fig. 1 ct 2). Gadā: It has the top resembling a lotus bud superimposed on an ãmalaka like round abacus. Below again the shaft has longitudinal ribs which cover almost half of the shaft. The hold is damaged. All the members are carved out of single stone. Cakra : The cakra appears to have been slightly damaged but presents a full picture. It shows twelve spokes emanating from the central hub. The remaining four spokes have been hidden under the limb which holds it as it may be surmised from the proportional space. Padma : The padma or the lotus has been held by the stem. Itde picts a bud as the cluster of the petals is closed at the top and the corolla is not seen. Saňklia : It has been broken at its lower extremity. The remaining portion shows the hollow counch-shell. The association of arglia and liňya has the iconographie sanction. Iconometery provides for the dimensions of such aniconic representations (1). But the unusual combination of symbolic and theriomorphic forms is unique. It has no iconographie sanction. The Kūrrna with the four attributes, undoubtedly stands for Vistui in the incarnation of Kūrmāualār. It is further evident from the following description: Kūrmāvalāriņam deva kamathãkrlimã likhel (Śilparatna, 25th patala) (2) Meaning, 'the tortoise incarnation of the God (Visņu) is depicted in the form of a tortoise'. It is needless to repeat the story of Kūrmāvatār, as it is quite popular. But something must be said about the attributes of Visņu. No iconographie text provides that the tortoise - presentation of Visņu should have the vaisņava emblems (3). Contrary to the canons we do find all the four attributes as provided in the anthropomorphic or therio-anthropomorphic forms. The Rūpamaņdana records the twenty four avalãrs and the position of the attributes in the hands. It is interesting to note that the order of the attributes in the present sculpture does not agree with any one mentioned in the Rūpamaņdana. Before proceeding further two more similar sculptures are being described here. A temple at Katāchpur assigned to the Chãlukyan period has the image of Visņu fixed on a square yoni and placed in the main shrine. The temple is a Saivite shrine is proved 'by the presence of a mutilated nandi placed on the platform to the right of the steps leading to the entrance porch'.

The yoni is always associated with liñga. 'But from all appearances this seems to be a change which has taken place in later times' (1). Another analogus is from somewhere in Bengal. Here a fish has been found on a yoni (2). The creation under study is unique. For a correct understanding and interpre- tation of the sculptor's mind one has to acquaint himself with the various conditions during the mediaeval period when this icon was carved. Those interested in the study of religion, philosophy and art may be knowing about certain icons, viz., Narasimha an incarnation of Visņu, who killed Hiranyakaśipu a devotee of Siva and Śarabha, an incarnation of Siva, killed Narasimha, depict nothing else but jealousy between the two rival sects. Similarly the images of Hari-Hara, Ardhanārīs- vara, etc., suggest the friendship between the two differing sects. The Indian art, roughly from about the time of the Mauryas to the time of Harsa, 'admits, despite local variations due to local tastes and visions, of a common denomination at each different stage of evolution and fulfilment'. The regional trends gradually became stronger from the beginning of the 8th century A. D. This regional consciousness completely arrested the classical tradition of an all-India art which lingered for one or two centuries more. The provincial or zonal spirit was manifested in all other aspects of the culture. In the field of sculpture, the artistic and spiritual values of an image which were the achievements of an artist in the Gupta and Post-Gupta period were lost in the early mediaeval period when the artist had to create such icons which should be instrumental for the devotees. Thus canonisation was rigidly followed with little display of the creative genius of the artist. As pointed out above the whole icon is carved out of a single piece. The āgamās prescribe that the pīllia should be made of slrī-šīlā or female stone and the liňga should be made of puru-silã or male stone. In the present instance, this prin- ciple has not been followed. This being the position of the art in the early mediaeval India, the date of the icon under discussion as given on the plate does not seem to be correct. The present specimen is carved out of the fine grained sandstone where the binding material is ferruginus and the binding property is quite strong. Accor- ding to the geological map (3) the formation in and around Bhāndaka the find spot of the icon, are the 'Kamthis', i. e. the upper Gondavana sandstones - coarsegrained, calcarious or silicious sandstones - which is not suitable for carving. It may be surmised from the above that either the icon was imported from somewhere in nor- thern India or if locally carved the material was obtained from other station. Let us visualise the political condition of India during the mediaeval period. It (1) Annual Report of the Archaeological Department of His Exalted Highness the Nizam's Dominions (1935-36 A. C.)

After the death of Harsa the country was torne into small warring states which were fighting for the crown of India. The Muslims who felt themselves stronger on our frontiers ventured to take advantage of this muddle. They had better of time. They did not remain merely invaders but settled on the soil of India as rulers. The followers of Mohammad were full of zeal and acted with an ardent missionary fanaticism. 'Hinduism felt the difference and tried to close up its ranks as a measure of self-preser- vation. In philosophy, this tendency is reflected in the attempt to svncratise all the warring systems of thought' (1). The spirit of sodality is asserted in the writings of the contemporary writer like Madhusūdana Sarasvatī (in his Prasthānabheda) and others. In the late period 'Vijnānabhiksu, another famous author, possibly belonging to the 16th or 17th Century A. D. made a similar attempt at syncratism.' As seen above, the sculpture may be belonging to 13th or 14th century A. D. It does not follow the canonisation which started in the early mediaeval period nor does it follow the basic principles of not depicting the attributes with the theriomor- phic forms. The unique combination of aniconic and theriomorphic forms - the components of two different sects denote the spirit of sodality and syncraticism as it was the need of the time.
