Koch Department of Biology, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 47405-6801, USA Received: 3 October 20031 Accepted: 17 October 2003 I Online publication: 17 June 2005 Abstract Microorganisms differ in their effectiveness in uptake and selection of substances that they bring in from the envi ronment. They also differ in how they balance the alloca tion of nutrients for immediate and for delayed use. Moreover, they may not take up resources as fast as they seemingly could, and they may extrude derivatives of substances just pumped in. A good deal of these apparent choices must reside in the uptake systems and the linkage of these with the cell's intermediate metabolism. An impor tant feature is that a resource may vary in concentration from time to time, nutrient to nutrient, and habitat to habitat. This variation must have been critical to the evo lution of regulatory processes. Some possibilities for the combined uptake and consumption are considered for substrates serving the same (homologous) and different (heterologous) roles for the bacterium. From the mem brane transport processes diagrammed in Fig. lc and Fig. 2 and corresponding computer program given in Appendix A, the combined effect of uptake processes and cell growth can be studied. The model can be modified for various alternate models to study the possible control of cellular uptake and metabolism for the range of ecological roles of the bacterium. Introduction One aspect of microbial physiology that has lagged be hind is the relationship between the control of the rate of uptake of substances from the medium with the cell's ability to utilize them for its immediate use in growth and/or the production of reserve materials for future use. This interaction among uptake, consumption for growth, uptake linked to excretion, and uptake linked to storage Correspondence to: A.L. Koch; E-mail: Koch@Indiana.edu is extremely important for survival of organisms in varied habitats. Different bacteria deal with the opportunities and problems posed by resource availability quite dif ferently. Not only do oligotrophs and copiotrophs have different strategies, but also various bacteria under some conditions control their growth rate below what might appear to be possible and "reasonable." There are other aspects to metabolic "choices." Some organisms select one or a few among many available equivalent (homologous) resources, whereas many simultaneously consume a variety of different ones. All organisms have needs for a variety of kinds of (heterol ogous) nutrients and are able to deal with or limit the uptake of most or almost all of these when different kinds of substances are limiting for growth. Here, I review some results from microbial physiology and ecology. Simula tions by a BASIC and by a Berkeley Madonna program are presented that link uptake and metabolism together explicitly to try to understand and rationalize these apparently inconsistent behaviors. Evolution Must Deal with a Perennially Variable Environment If an organism always grew in a constant environment, its metabolic regulation and its genome could be much simpler. It was, no doubt, simpler before the elaboration of metabolic and genetic cellular regulation, but envi ronmental fluctuations led to the evolution of mecha nisms to try to cope with too much and too little. The response to too little of a resource would lead to the selection for better pumps and more pumps. I have emphasized this point repeatedly [23, 25, 29-32]. Integral with this idea is that the better transport ability brings with it the risk that the resource will be temporarily be come high and the transport capability will bring too much substrate into the cell more quickly than protective mechanisms can act. This may be an important factor leading to the failure of oligotrophs to grow in high substrate concentrations. DOI: 10.1007/s00248-003-1053-4 Volume 49, 183-197 (2005) ?

Simultaneously, Novick and Szilard [49] and Monod [45] invented continuous culture de vices called, respectively, the chemostat and the bactogen. The designation chemostat is the term that remains in the literature largely because the name itself makes the point that growth rate is controlled by the level of a single chemical. In Novick and Szilard's early studies, this was tryptophan needed by an Escherichia coli auxotrophic strain that had a nonrevertible mutation in the trypto phan operon. They used this organism to study mutation rates to virus resistance as a function of growth rate [49, 50, 51]. Subsequently, the chemostat became the work horse of bacterial physiology because the chemostat generated balanced, growing steady-state cultures; it was versatile and allowed the study by later microbial physi ologists of many important problems. Some of the earliest studies were of the effect of growth limited by one of the many different substances in a simple minimal synthetic medium (see the early compendia symposium reports [41, 54]). This was done by lowering, one at a time, the concentration of single constituents in the input medium. These experiments clearly demon strated that there were different responses made by the same bacterial cell growing at the same rate but under different kinds of limitations. Carbon/energy limitation led to cultures of cells that appear to be much the same over a large range of concentrations of a carbon source and their qualitative nature in the input medium [59, 63]. On the other hand, limitation for a nitrogen, phosphate, or sulfur source led to cells that were invested with a large amount of external polysaccharide, called capsule or glycocalyx. This finding led to the conclusion that with an abun dance of a carbon/energy source over cellular needs for other kinds of substances, the cell took up more glucose than it could use for normal growth and so "had" to do something else with it. There are half-a dozen options for the disposition of the carbon substrate excess listed in Table 1, and aspects of these are discussed throughout the paper, but the chemostat cultures of cells with N, S, or P as the limiting factor were the first examples of uptake in excess of needs combined with an alternative disposition of the excess carbon source. The observation that under certain conditions alternative uses of a substrate took place is the starting point for the major phenomena discussed, modeled, and reviewed in this paper. If bacteria had "free will" or actually were "altruistic," they might have elected to consume less of the environmentally available resource and thus conserved it. Part of the essential problem at hand is to consider the choices that microorganisms appear to make to take up and then find a use for the excess that is an alternative to faster or more extensive growth. This apparent paradox occurs in a several contexts. Anthropo morphically, for this first studied case, one could hypoth esize that the cell had the opportunity, at little or no cost, to take up carbohydrate although it could not be used for regular growth, but instead processed it to form a poly meric carbohydrate covering. This "dog in the manger" behavior might have had an immediate gain to the cell because it could have served the useful purpose of pre venting attack by various agents (predators, antibodies, etc.) and it could be a resource that might be later tapped when there was less carbon resource available. Addition ally, it could serve the purpose of attaching the cell to surfaces, which certainly occurs in many habitats today. It is to be emphasized that in the usual chemostat operation, all except one of the needs of the cell are sup plied in the medium in excess. This was the basis for the word chemostat. The fact that growth occurs no matter what substance is actually limiting emphasizes the fact that the cell has either the ability to limit the uptake or to modify the uses of all nutrients, be they sulfur, nitrogen, potassium, osmolytes, or trace metals. A possible alterna tive is that the cell through evolution has arranged cellular processes so that large variations of internal concentrations of these chemical species have little or no effect on the growth rate of the otherwise growth-limited cells. Anyway, the cell must have mechanisms to protect its metabolic systems, at least, to some considerable extent, from too much or too little of numerous neutralities. As an aside, limitation of components other than carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur gave interesting side effects. Magnesium limitation results in cells with polymorphic morphologies [61, 62]. Thymine starvation of an auxo troph resulted in cell death and in high rates of mutation [5, 8]. Potassium limitation [61] is intriguing because K+ does not engage in covalent linkage, but is necessary for ionic and osmotic reasons and has an essential function in protein synthesis. Two Heterologous Substrates. Following Novick and Szilard and Monod, a different paradigm came into vogue; i.e., lowering the concentration of two different substrates simultaneously. Their ratio was varied in dif ferent chemostats so in one chemostat culture of a series, one substance would be actually limiting and the other almost limiting, while in another chemostat the reverse situation would obtain. One of the first cases of this type of experiment was done in Tempest's laboratory [13]. His group varied the ratio of potassium to phosphate in chemostat cultures of a Bacillus subtilis strain. Phosphate is frequently limiting in natural environments and, of course, is essential for synthesis of nucleic acids and co factors. In Gram-positive cells, phosphate is also used in teichoic acid, which serves an important function in their wall biology. It was found that when phosphate was limiting, the cells economized on their phosphate usage by substituting teichuronic acid for teichoic acid. This can</page><page sequence="3">A.L. Koch: Bacterial Choices 185 also be viewed as a case related to that mentioned above in which excess carbon compound is sequestered in the cell as a polysaccharide covering. Whereas the presence of teichoic acid creates a reserve supply of phosphate, this accumulation of teichuronic acid is just the reverse. In the phosphate-limited cells with teichuronic acid in the wall, the negatively charged phosphate is replaced with a negatively charged uronic acid grouping as the default substitute. Knowledge of the existence of this switch turned out to be important because later in Archibald's laboratory [1] it was possible to implement such a shift by slightly changing the K/P ratio. With this technique they produced critical proof that the poles of the Gram-positive rod-shaped organisms were inert after their formation. Later, with this technique it could be concluded that the cylinder wall was laid down in layers that were subsequently displaced outward [42]. Such a mechanism had been postulated earlier [36] to account for still earlier observations from studies by Doyle's lab oratory [43]. The biochemical economization in the substitution of teichuronic acid is an example of a cellular response to modify metabolism to more effectively use the available resources depending on its availability. In the past 10 years studies with the chemostat of dual heterologous resource has been extended to cases where two heterologous substrates are both simulta neously limiting over a range of ratios of the substances. The published work with such dual limitations has been reviewed by Egli [11]. His laboratory has been very important in this field [40]. This ability to deal with two substances, one almost limiting and the other actually limiting, is associated with an alteration of the internal composition of the bacteria (see below). Usually this is the accumulation of some substance internally, such as p hydroxybenzoate. This conversion can deplete the med ium of a carbon substrate that is in some excess over the amount needed to match the need for another (heterol ogous) substrate. At higher levels, of course, the medium cannot be cleared of one component in this way. Theory: Growth Rate Dependence on a Substrate Concentration Another consequence of evolutionary responses to vari ability in substrate concentration is that substrate versus growth rate curves for a single nutrient would come to deviate from the hyperbolic Monod form. While the Best model is more appropriate, the more realistic computer treatment of Koch [31], extended here, leads to simula tions linking the uptake process with growth capability. The further extension of this is presented below and carries the realistic modeling of the growth of the bac terial cell a little further. Monod's Law. By far, the most often used model of the substrate dependence for bacterial cell growth is Monod's law ([44, 45]; see Koch [30] for history. His law, shown in Fig. la, is: /* = /VaxS/(^m + S), where jla is the specific growth rate and |imax is the maxi mum specific growth rate, S is the substrate concentration, and Km is the concentration that gives the half maximal growth rate. The justification for adopting the Michaelis Menten enzyme kinetic equation for a whole cell is only convincing in the simplest case of bacterial growth on one carbon substrate in a well-stirred medium where transport is limiting and internal consumption is not. It also would strictly apply only if entry was very fast and a single, simple enzymatic process limits intermediary metabolism. However, there are many more models in the liter ature, and many cases of more complex reaction schemes and their associated models (multiple substrates, multiple transport systems, etc.). The Best Equation. A sequence of a diffusion process followed by a single enzyme catalytic event dis tributing the resource to all of intermediary metabolism (Fig. lb) is an improvement on the Monod model (see [30, 32, 35]). This mechanism is also an improvement over Blackman's (1905) law of the minimum [4] and Justus von Liebig's [65] idea (60 years before Blackman). Blackman's law states that only one substance can be limiting for the growth of an organism under a particular set of circumstances. This point of view is partially inconsistent with that held by Cohen and Monod [7a], although they felt that growth must be limited by the most needed substance. With increasing concentration of a substance the growth-limiting processes would gradually switch from one to a different nutrient limitation. Cohen and Monod would not have excluded an external limi tation of some heterologous factor, but they favored the idea that that the limitation might be an internal factor. Thus, growth at a high enough substrate concentration would be independent of its exact concentration. Conse quently, the growth rate would change hyperbolically with concentration as in elementary enzyme kinetics. Monod considered that there were only two issues: the rate of uptake dependent on the substrate concentration below a certain concentration, and the maximum cellular growth rate above that concentration. Monod did not discuss the molecular mechanism for the existence of the upper limitation, but it would, no doubt, be a function of the effective metabolic rate constants. This is in some sense equivalent to the Briggs-Haldane treatment [6] of enzyme kinetics in which the maximum rate of a reaction is determined by the product of the total enzyme amount and the rate constant for the conversion of the enzyme substrate complex into the product. The Best equation was independently derived in microbiological context three times. We (Koch and</page><page sequence="4">186 A.L. Koch: Bacterial Choices Coffman [35], like Powell [53] earlier and Dabes et al. [9] later, analyzed this situation for bacterial growth in the spirit of Briggs and Haldane [6] and ended with a for mulation containing an additional parameter to that in Monod's hyperbolic law. This was a significant improvement of the Monod formulation from two points of view. First, it fits the growth data more accurately, and second, it attempts to link uptake to the cell's ability to grow. The basic assumption for this case is that the up take process obeys Fick's diffusion equation and that it is followed by an irreversible enzymatic entry into the cel lular metabolism. Diffusion is reversible, but at high external concentrations, the internal concentration achieves a value high enough that it saturates the rate of incorporation into the cell's metabolism. The resulting diffusion-enzyme equation is: V = Vna(S + Ku+J) x{l - [1 - 4SJ/(S + KU +/)2]1/2}/2/, where again S is the external concentration but KM and Vmax are constants for the incorporation of the internal form of the substrate into cell constituents. / is a parameter that incorporates the diffusion constant across the cell membrane. / is equal to Vmax/AP, where A is the cell surface area and P is a permeability constant that is equal to the diffusion constant in the membrane divided by its thickness. I have called this treatment the Best law [25-27, 32] because Best [3] had derived it earlier than the three groups cited above. He had done so in the context of an enzymatic reaction system and not of bacterial growth. This / parameter can take values that make the resulting uptake and growth curve vary between the limits of Monod's hyperbola and the Blackman case composed of first-order and zero-order branches joined discontinu ously together. The key points are that the transition of the first-order to zero-order region can be abrupt or gradual and that an accurate knowledge of growth rate dependence on substrate concentration could afford additional important biological information. Computer Simulation of a Transport System Linked to Metabolism In an earlier review [31], a kinetic simulation was pre sented for the coupling of an uptake mechanism with the utilization of the internal form of the substrate for growth by a bacterial cell. This transport model, outlined in Fig. lc, was constructed to study how cellular control of uptake could mesh with internal metabolism. The model explicitly considered a number of conceivable mechanisms that might limit net uptake when high levels of substrate were available in the environment. The cel lular solution to regulate this would necessarily involve a controlling link between the biochemical processes for transport of nutrients with the subsequent intracellular metabolism for growth, for storage, for excretion, and for energy generation. For a copiotroph or a facultative oligotroph when the internal concentrations become too great, the uptake systems would be controlled and regulated by the sub strate concentration within the cell. This could be via limiting, inhibiting, diverting, redirecting, or expelling the substrate. The specific membrane-bound components of the uptake system, the transporter, T, in several forms is expected to be the major locus of the regulation, and it is assumed that the transporters can face the outside or the inside of the cytoplasmic membranes and, therefore, can bind the substrate on either side of the membrane. One can readily think of four possibilities for the control of uptake. These have been listed [31]. The first of these regulatory mechanisms is a default and is the simple reversal of the uptake process. Net back flow could occur by mass action when the internal concentration becomes too high. If this alone functioned, the model would be a refinement of the Best model. The second is also a default possibility and is the product inhibition of the transport process by binding and accumulating the transporter on the inside of the cell membrane. This causes T on the outside surface to be reduced, and this slows entry. These first two properties of the system could serve to couple uptake and growth on the assumption that the internal transport products, SI, can "back react" with the corre sponding transport elements, leading to reverse fluxes and tying up the transport elements. Both actions would tend to slow net uptake to a value appropriate to the growth capability of the internal parts of the cell. How ever, if either of these default regulatory systems required high levels of SI for regulatory function than can be obtained in natural systems, they would not be adequate to control balanced growth, and then a surfeit of an internal constituent might result. A third potential regulatory mechanism is that the cell may have special ways to actively control transport activity at appropriate level of the SI product within the cell. There are several possibilities, and the exact mechanism for such regulation is not specified in the model. It could be that phosphorylation of the transporter renders it inactive and inhibits transport. This is similar to the type of mechanism that occurs in the two-component systems common in bacteria. Another would be having allosteric enzyme ac tion control uptake. Moreover, it could be that the transporter element is itself the regulator. Such possible active mechanisms could curb uptake to match growth needs by a process that is symbolized in the metabolic scheme of Fig. lc as the conversion of TI to TIP when the internal concentrations become too high. This type of control is designated in Fig. lc (and Fig. 2) by open headed arrows. Still another alternative is the existence of</page><page sequence="5">A.L. Koch: Bacterial Choices 187 a process that limits growth by the depletion of the cell's energy reserves available for the relevant transport. The fourth potential regulatory mechanism is over flow metabolism; this has been given many other names in the literature (overproduction, spillover, energy spill ing, futile cycles, slip reactions, and wastage). It functions by the cell having pathways in which the internal metabolite is converted to other compounds that are then excreted. Although other explanations can be given for the purpose of the overflow process [63], it could also function to match net intake to the cell's ability to grow by diverting some of the SI into metabolites that are secreted, or are not used for growth, or do not upset the cell's physiology. Overflow metabolism at first appears to be such a seemingly irrational mechanism that both wastes the energy for transport and requires a higher transport capability for a resource that is pumped into the cell and then pumped back into the environment in some modified chemical form [28, 48]. Because of this apparent inefficiency, only part of the imported substrate is actually utilized for growth. From an anthropomorphic viewpoint, in the overflow case, at least for some carbon compounds is "elective" in the sense that the organisms, instead of extruding the overflow substance, "could" have metabolized it more completely with the available coreactants to trap more energy. However, the cells just did not "choose" to do so, but instead have increased the number of substrate molecules imported beyond a just sufficient number for normal growth. I have discussed this phenomenon in an earlier paper [28] in connection the extrusion of alpha-ketoglutarate and glutamic acid. Seemingly this, too, requires fruitless uptake of carbo hydrates. With further study, one hopes, the anthropo morphic aspect of these phenomena will be replaced by a rational understanding of their purpose and use to the cell. The metabolic scheme of Fig. lc omits processes such as (i) diffusion up to the cell, (ii) diffusion through porins and diffusion through the periplasmic space (of Gram-negative bacteria), (iii) diffusion through the thick wall of Gram-positive bacteria, and (iv) diffusion through the cytoplasm. Considerations of these processes have been presented earlier [24, 26, 31], but they have been glossed over for the present purposes because the diffusion processes are usually so rapid that often these do not limit growth. The details of coupling of various types of energy sources, such as linkage to protonmotive force or linkage to phosphorylation sources such as ATP, also are neglected. However, their effects may be approximately simulated as discussed earlier [32].

Models for bacterial growth, (a) The Monod model. Monod postulated, analogously to Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics, that a reversible complex is formed between the substrate, S, and the bacterium, B. This complex is resolves to recover the original catalyst, i.e., the bacterium, and the product, which is a second bacterium, (b) The Best model. The external substrate, SE, diffuses reversibly through the cell membrane. When internal to the cell, where it is designated as SI, it reacts with a cell enzyme, E. This is the first step in its metabolism. The complex, in an irreversible reaction, regenerates the enzyme, produces a product, P, that then is used variously to supports different aspects of cell growth, (c) Linkage model. This model links uptake with consumption. A pathway for facilitated diffusion acts to bring the substrate into the cell via a membrane-bound carrier, T. All stages (binding, disso ciating, traversing the membrane) are reversible. The substrate, on dissociation, reacts internally with the first enzyme in the inter mediary metabolism pathway according to the usual kind of en zyme mechanism with a Km and a Vmax. Three regulatory mechanisms are shown: (i) by combination with a phosphate group by a two-component system; (ii) by overflow metabolism as the internal substrate is ejected from the cell in a transformed state, X; (iii) by storage within the cell as compound Y. B to the symbols for components and kinetic constants in the two separate copies that together are then part of the larger program. This combined model can be used in several ways. Substrates A and B can be either homologous or heterologous. The terms, homologous and heterolo gous, were established by Harder and Dijkhuisen [16, 17] for classifying substrates, although other terms have been used in the literature. The former are groups of substances</page><page sequence="6">188 AL. Koch: Bacterial Choices Outside Overflow Orerfh* "\.

Metabolic scheme for the linkage of uptake of two growth substrates. The transport system for both substrates was modeled from an earlier review [30]. It has been outlined in Fig. lc. The symbols S, T, E, I stand for substrate, transporter, external, and internal substrate. These symbols have an A or B added to them depending on which transport system is involved. Rate constants have been designated, for example, by K13B instead of KUB. Also KMB is used instead of KMB and VmaxB instead of VmaxB, to designate Michaelis-Menten constants and maximum velocities. In this scheme there are four forms of the free substrates and four forms of the transporter for each substrate. The 12 kinetic rate constants for each substrate should be considered the equivalents of the rate constants in chemical kinetics or in enzymology. The internal form of each kind of substrate, SI A and SIB, feeds into central metabolism at a maximum rate dependent on EA*K13A and EB*K13B when SIA or SIB are large relative to the binding constants, KMA or KMB (i.e., at saturation condition). The internal substrate may also be extruded in another form, XA and XB, or stored as a reserve material inside the cell, YA and YB. These phenomenological constants correspond to different kinetic forms for homologous and heterologous substrates as described in the text. The open-headed arrows present a possible control of the internal pools on that function by regulating TIA and TIB. that the organism can substitute one for the other (such as different carbon compounds); the latter are substances that serve qualitatively different purposes for the cell. However, there is at least one more possibility; this is that a substance may have both a specific and a nonspecific use by the cell. An example of such an additional purpose is a substance contributing to the osmotic pressure of the cell in addition to the metabolic roles. SEA and SEB are the concentrations of two external nutrilites and, when transported across the cytoplasmic membrane, lead to internal concentrations, designated SIA and SIB. For the present paper each transport system is postulated to have equivalent series of unit steps for uptake and for the control of this uptake. A large variety of cases can be modeled by choosing the kinetic param eters and concentration of the external substrates of the A and B halves. In addition to the possible types of regu lation, there are the possibilities that either SIA or SIB is in part metabolized and excreted as XA or XB, dependent on the values of Kl IA and Kl IB. Also, the substrates may accumulate in the cell as some kind of reserve material, DYA or DYB, depending on the values assigned to K12A and K12B. Additionally note that DXA and DXB desig nate the rate and not the accumulated values. Note that all the individual rates for the different steps are com puted and only then, by either program, are the new values for the concentration of the individual compo nents calculated. Internal Nutrient Limitation versus a Heterologous Nutrient Limitation Maximum Growth Rate Limited by Second Nutri ent. With two transport systems, we have the potential ability to model dual heterologous substrates. One sub strate can have a dependence that is first-order at low concentrations and zero-order at high concentrations be cause of limitation caused by the second substrate. Con</page><page sequence="7">A.L. Koch: Bacterial Choices 189 sequently, in a somewhat more explicit fashion, we can consider an alternative to the usually assumed internal limitation of growth rate by modeling that the growth rate is also controlled by the concentration of a second heter ologous substrate. If we could surmise the nature of such a dual control in a given experimental case, our experimental action would be clear. However, we might not be able to test the concept, if the second external substrate is not known or is not under our experimental control. In the case where this second species was known, we would augment its concentration and thereby increase the yield in accor dance with the philosophy of Liebig and of Blackman. Figure 3a shows a graph of growth response for one set of choices that approximate the Monod case. In the computer simulation, the growth limitation has been achieved by fixing the maximum incorporation of A into cellular metabolism as dependent on the incorporation of B (according to V^ = K13B*EB*SIB/(SIB + KMB)), assuming a scaling factor of unity. The curves presented in Fig. 3a corresponds to a value of VmaxB controlling the metabolism of A. In the simulation, if uptake of A leads to a value of K13A*EA*SIA/(SIA+KMA) that is greater than the value to which the B-constraint would limit growth, there may be production of internal and external storage forms but no further increase in the utilization of A for growth. An Internal Limitation. The other alternative, one that has been suggested often, is that some internal process provides an upper limit to growth rate. The basis of such a "cap" has never been determined or even successfully speculated about. Several kinds of possibilities can be suggested. It might be that evolution has not yet had time to lead to a faster maximum growth rate. Another possi bility is that a higher maximal growth rate would bring with it disadvantages that have prevented further evolu tion. Still another is that the relevant enzyme molecules cannot be made to function faster or that no more than a few copies of the enzyme can function simultaneously, such as in the case of DNA replication where the space at the replication point is limiting. The case of an internal limitation applicable to any of these possibilities is mod eled in Fig. 3b. This was achieved in the simulation by setting the value of K13A*EA appropriately. Modeling the Transport Function and the Cellular Limitation of Entry into Cell Synthesis for Two Substitutable Substrates For this section the computer program has been used to study the effectiveness of the combined action of the two mentioned types of default regulation (mass action and product inhibition) on the transport processes during growth with homologous substrate sources which are imported into the cell by two independent uptake sys tems. It is assumed here that there are no active regula tory mechanisms in play.

This is for the case where the rate of uptake of a second substrate, B, can limit cellular growth at high concentration of A. (b) Growth rate as a function of substrate A if internal consumption limits growth in this case. The maximum limitation is due to limitation in the rate at which the internal-form SIA can be used and is not dependent on the uptake of substrate B. This is the usually assumed case of the cell being limited in consumption of the internal level of substrate. Thus SIA, or VmaxA limits growth under various conditions. two active regulatory controls described here, and others, will be studied to find when and where active processes are necessary or useful.</page><page sequence="8">190 A.L.

Dual homologous substrates consumption at high (a) and at low (b). The kinetic parameters are the same for both substrates, except for the maximum rate of internal consumption, which is 100 times greater for (a) than for (b). Simulations for two substrates are shown in Fig. 4a and 4b and are for the case where the kinetic parameters and the total amount of the transporters are the same for both sources A and B. In the simulations presented, only the external concentration of A is varied while B is kept constant. Two cases are shown, one with a large value of the maximum velocities for both VmaxA = K13A*EA and for VmaxB = K14B*EB for actual entry into cellular metabolism and the other with a 100 fold smaller values for both maximum velocities. The maximum utilization velocity for cellular growth was chosen to be fast enough when given the remainder of the set of the selected parameters, so as to not impede intake and to retain' the transport kinetics as the limiting stage of growth for both substrates. For the case of a high value of VmaxA and ymaxB&gt; both SIA and SIB are maintained very near zero by the metabolism into cellular constituents. When the single change was made to decrease the maximal rates of consumption by a 100-fold, as shown in Fig. 4b, then internal consumption became limiting and the internal pools, SIA and SIB, both rise to the point that they force the transporters on the inner face to recombine to form SITIA and SITIB, tending to block influx and favor efflux. Selective Utilization versus Usage of Multiple Homologous Substrates. Monod invented the term diauxie for the selective and nearly complete utilization of first one and then the other of a pair of homologous substrates and studied this phenomenon for his PhD [44]. From a large body of subsequent work diauxie is a phenomenon rel evant to cells exposed to nontrace concentrations of nutrients. But even for these it does not apply to all homologous systems. In these cases the cells respond by inducing relevant enzymes and permeases (transport systems) and inhibiting induction of other transport and metabolic systems by catabolite repression and inducer exclusion. So this class of phenomenon is largely dependent on the regulation of enzyme synthesis. Although I feel it necessary to mention the diauxie phenomenon to begin this section, this is the place to contrast it with the opposite phenomenon, i.e., the coutilization of dual substrates. This is most easily studied in steady-state chemostat culture where the levels of both nutrients can be maintained very low [2, 10, 11, 18, 60]. The work of Hegewald and Knorre [20] did not use the chemostat, but supported this concept. Relevant to many natural situations where conditions are near starvation, the conclusion from studies with the chemo stat is that bacterial cells generally behave differently at low substrate concentrations than they do when the substrate concentrations are high. In almost starvation conditions, many bacteria consume simultaneously the range of available carbon sources for which they have genomic resources and, instead of being selective as in the diauxie response, are quite ecumenical. Studies in this field have been reviewed by Egli and his co-workers [10, 11, 38]. When total carbon sources are low, it is fre quently observed that a number of pumps and metabolic enzymes are derepressed allowing the simultaneous uti lization of small amounts of diverse organic molecules. The biochemistry of such processes has been discussed by Ferenci [14]. With the flexibility of the developed computer pro gram, the values for the parameters can be chosen so that a variety of growth patterns can be simulated. For example, as a future goal we can study conditions such that one carbon compound might prevent the utilization of another, or when both might be used in proportion to their external concentrations outside the cell. This would be done for cases where the transport and utilization</page><page sequence="9">A.L. Koch: Bacterial Choices 191 pathways become altered in different environments. Only one general example is presented now (it is shown in Fig. 5), but researchers for use for their specific applica tions can obtain and apply our simulation program. Other kinds of theoretical developments have come from the laboratory of Ramkrishna [55, 56y 64]. The approach of Ramkrishna's group comes mainly from the "cybernetic" point of view that he developed. It assumes that the cell alters rates of synthesis of different enzyme systems and does so under the assumption that the cell has the wisdom to optimize its growth rate under any particular ambient set of conditions. Interesting and quite different work by Narang also comes from the same laboratory. He presents a quite different and noncyber netic model for the consumption of multiple homoge neous substrates [46, 47]. Experimental work from Egli's laboratory [11, 12, 39, 40] is currently extending the earlier studies with dual homologous substrates. Heterologous Dual Substrates The two transport systems shown in the two halves of Fig. 2 import substrates by independent mechanisms to the inside of the cell. In this section their utilization by the cell is for different metabolic purposes such that ei ther can limit cell growth. It might logically appear that only one of these can limit growth at a time unless the uptake rates were exactly matched with respect to cellular needs. Consequently, away from this singular point, one substance could be brought into the cell in excess of needs for growth and only enough of it would be used for growth consistent with the utilization of the other growth factor. The excess uptake of either may be disposed of by the ways listed in Table 1 and discussed above. This was the philosophy employed for Fig. 3a and is relevant here, but only for the case in which only a very little internal or external storage is made. In this section we add such possibilities, and this allows for "dual limitation." Such a sharp differentiation, so that one nutrient is limiting and another heterologous one is in part excreted or stored is not often observed. A good review has been presented by Kovarova-Kovar and Egli [38]. They list 10 experimental papers in the 1970s and 10 more recent ones. The most accurately defined kinetic study is that of Rutgers et al. [57] and the sole experimental report that measured what the cell did with the slight excess of a carbon source is that of Grazer-Lampert et al. [15]. Theoretical explanations for dual limitation can be found in seven papers, and one more variant is proposed here and also earlier [38]. The model diagrammed in Fig. 2 might regulate uptake by any of the first five options shown in Table 1. These controlling mechanisms would apply most obvi ously to an excess of carbon/energy sources, and some different kinds of qualifications and possibilities would be io51-1 y DPB= Rate of entry of B e / ^ 11 * t i- Secretion 10"6 _r mto cell metaboh^ _, , r ~ ~ --nnoooooooi J ?4L-gg***?L? 8 i | IO*7 f\f - B f /\ Rate of A entry 15 nn-s _/ into metabolism_ o iu ?-f .? / Internal storage &lt; io* f-^-??^ $ 10",0&lt;:-/-1 i io- ~y Q IO12 / IO13 |-1-,-, 0 12 3 4 External concentration, SEA, or Substrate A Figure 5. Heterologous dual substrates. In this simulation, dif ferent concentrations of substrate A that were supplied externally varied from 0 to 4 in arbitrary units, while the concentration of B was supplied at 1 throughout. At an extreme concentration of SEA = 1, internal A (SIA) is in excess. Above this equivalence point, an excess flux of A over B is continuously fed into inter mediary metabolism and must be accommodated. These on-going fluxes must either lead to further metabolic changes (in enzyme concentrations) or, in theory, to an infinite intracellular concen tration of a substrate. Possible control by the reversal of the transport or by feedback inhibition of the transport system alone was taken into consideration in these calculations. Active mecha nisms to control transport, such as a two-component system or an overflow mechanism, could allow stable growth. Additionally, the influx could lead to internal or external storage forms, or to overflow metabolism. relevant for special limitations due to magnesium, nitrogen, sulfur, or phosphorus deficiency. Moreover, quite different possibilities would apply to limitations of elements that are not linked through covalent bonds to the cell's constituents, such as potassium and osmolytes. Of the many interesting cases that could be simu lated, only one is shown here, although a further paper is in preparation. Our basic case is shown in Fig. 5; it differs from the parameters of Fig. 3a only in a 10-fold increase in the rate of excretion of a derivative of A. The simu lation has been done assuming cultures grown with a constant concentration of B and with a progressively increasing level of A. After the level of A is increased sufficiently, the internal pool SIA starts to increase sig nificantly. With increasing SIA the cell grows faster and the SIB concentration gradually decreases as the growth rate increases. The increase of SIA favors the formation of internal and/or external stored forms of A. Eventually as A increases, faster formation of storage forms cannot take place. At this point the roles reverse and the steady-state</page><page sequence="10">192 A.L. Koch: Bacterial Choices concentration of SIB becomes and remains nearly zero. Then the import of A becomes too large for the constant concentration of SIB and is in excess of the cell's needs to match the B resource. This is indicated on the right-hand side of Fig. 5. Of course, this results in a progressively higher steady-state level of SIA. This high level of the internal resource partially slows entry of A for the parameters chosen, but may not slow it sufficiently to prevent a surfeit of A. From the point of view of nutrient B the situation is simply the reverse. The consequence when A is small is that there is an excess of capability for B uptake. This excess of B would also have to be managed by the cell in one or more of the ways outlined in Table 1. In Fig. 5, the problem is just posed, but not solved in the sense that balanced growth can occur without a very high concen tration of either A or B. In fact what the simulation shows is that balancing the excess of either substrate for the assumed parameters could not be done by the action of either of the two default processes of binding the trans porter elements or reversing the substrate flow. Thus uptake of the excess component may not be slowed fully to the rates of uptake actually used for growth at any but the exact matching of the ratios of the rates of inputs to needs. It is beyond the range of this paper to consider details of how the cell may adapt to alter the levels of the transporter elements and to consider any enzymatic machinery associated with the transport to accommodate such growth conditions. Although this may happen, in many cases in the nature of growth it may be much slower an adaptation than the speed at which the internal concentration of substrate is able to change, for example, if the external resource changes discontinuously. In the Fig. 5 the excess of SIA (over a different scale) is shown subject to a removal process. The process is unspecified, and it may be the conversion into an over flow metabolite or into the formation of an internal or external storage material. In any of these three cases, it is removed to a certain degree from the SIA pool and does not subject the cell to the possible disadvantage of too high an internal concentration of A. Figure 5 concerns the steady state, which may be only slowly approached when the entry process is at a rate nearly equal to the consumption rate for cell growth. An additional point must be mentioned; one or the other of the active controls on transport mentioned above and in Table 1 may come to function to decrease the net import of substance A. In such a case the, sim ulation would be different than shown here, and I hope to address this later. Conclusions The goals of this review and the simulations presented was to try to understand (i) how bacteria could deal with excesses of some substrates in the medium and not be Table 1. Ways in which bacteria cope with an internal excess of a nutrient 1. The accumulation of an internal pool causes a reverse flow. This default mechanism is simply the back-reaction of the import mechanism. 2. The accumulation of an internal pool causes product inhibition that limits entry through the transport machinery. This default mechanism ties up the transport elements as complexes with internal forms of the substrates. 3. The accumulation of an internal pool limits the rate of entry by actively blocking the transport system through the formation a derivative of the transporter element. This may be controlled by a mechanism such as two-component regulatory systems. This would be expected to be an active mechanism (i.e., energy requiring) that converts the transporters into inactive forms. 4. Although the transport mechanism carries out entry, another series of processes may be available that cause the excess to be metabolized and the product excreted from the cell. This overflow metabolism may occur by a different transport mechanism. 5. The excess may be converted into an external storage form such as a capsule-like material, e.g., glycocalyx. 6. The transport mechanism carries out an entry process, but the excess is converted into an internal storage form, such as to a polyhydroxybutyrate or a storage protein. harmed by them; (ii) how bacteria can disburse the excess amounts of various substances they may have taken up from their environment beyond those used for current growth, including storing resources for contingencies and future use; (iii) how the cell might reject or expel re source molecules if they are too abundant; and (iv) how the organism might implement a strategy of using only one growth substrate among several available or alter natively choose a strategy to diversify and be able to utilize many different compounds simultaneously. The simulations presented here were based on earlier ideas for steady-state kinetic systems [19, 21, 22, 66], but in addition the simulations presented here incorporate the coupling of the entry process to internal usage by the cell. In addition, the contribution made here is to provide an ability to deal with the consequences of growth with multiple homogeneous substrates. The probable cause of the difference between oligo trophs and copiotrophs [32, 33, 34, 52] is the nature of an internal limitation within the organism. It can be ar gued that the oligotroph has adapted over evolutionary time to be very efficient in growing under low levels of nutrients and that the achievement of high efficiency under low-substrate conditions has crippled the cell to not being effective when there are high concentrations of nutrients. It can also be argued that the low rates or lack of growth (or even death) at high nutritional conditions are the consequences of adaptations that are only useful under low nutrient concentrations. The oligotrophy of marine bacteria is particularly relevant [7, 37, 58]. Because the geological, chemical, and biological fac tors determine the concentrations of nutrients and are</page><page sequence="11">A.L. Koch: Bacterial Choices 193 beyond the control of microorganisms, the problem faced by a microorganism under natural conditions is how to acquire all the building blocks from the environment that are necessary for its growth no matter what the diverse exogenous concentrations are. For homologous or sub stitutable resources, as emphasized above and from Egli's laboratory [12, 39, 49], most organisms in a poor envi ronment cannot be selective and cannot choose to use only certain organic substrates. Many organisms when inhabiting a nutrient environment that are high in a certain substrate may become selective to a particular substrate and may loose their versatility. It has been long known that during chemostat-type growth the cells are more adapted to a single substrate than in batch growth. This is not a surprising finding for carbon/energy-defi cient environments. However, being derepressed for consumption of a variety of carbon sources presents a severe problem to the cell. More internal metabolic machinery and more kinds of transportation mechanisms in the cell envelope will be needed, and this can place a burden on the cell. Moreover, multiple mechanisms will need to be in place even in the absence of any particular source. This can lead to the additional problem that the cell's cytoplasmic membrane may be overcrowded with protein elements involved in transport. Microbial ecology is at least two different, but interacting fields: ecology and microbiology. Jacque Monod started his research career and fused them to gether by watching bacteria grow with the then-new photoelectric colorimeter. This made him a microbial physiologist, although his original purpose was to study growth of bacterial populations as analogues of higher organisms. The attraction of bacteria was that they were able to grow fast. Later his kinetic model fueled several branches of microbiology; not only microbial physiology but also microbial ecology and aspects of the fermenta tion industry. Here I have gone a little further with the hopes that it will stimulate work in microbial physiology and ecology at the bench and in the field. The chemostat and bactogen have fueled under standing of bacterial adaptation and response to the environment. But these continuous-culture studies are limited by the necessity that a single component alone is limiting. Not only does this require that effective and sufficient mixing be maintained, but in the past, conclu sions have been frequently confounded by growth on the surfaces of the culture vessel. Moreover, today when the surface growth is the point of interest, it raises uncertainty in dealing with either the biofilm phase or the fraction of the cellular population that is in suspension. New tools are appropriate. And in fact, much progress has been made with visual methods of examining colonies growing on surfaces. Flow methods are certainly needed and are being used. However, much of the nutritional physiology will only be discovered by first studying cul tures of well-dispersed cells. But to be extended, they will have to be interpreted with mathematical models of dif fusion in packed cellular systems. Techniques drawn from studies of diffusion in porous materials developed in chemical engineering systems will have to be imported into the microbiological field. Continuous-flow systems have limitations: for che mostat operation the variation of the limiting substance within the fluid or on or near solid surfaces poses diffi culties and uncertainties. Continuous flow where there is not a single limiting substrate presents difficulties. Even for the simplest case of dual substrates when both are almost limiting, difficulties are posed, but studies in this field also have revealed the versatility of microbial metabolism. What may be the innovations in the near future? I hope and expect that the methods and ability to deal adequately with multiple substrates will be the next step. Of course, some quite novel experimental approaches will be needed. The one I am breathlessly anticipating is that supersensitive analytical techniques will become com monly employed for physiological studies. They can be used in the study of very dilute cultures so that the organisms will not use an appreciable fraction of the available but very low limiting resource, but however that mass-spectrometric measurements, refined light-absorp tion measurements, and fluorescent measurements will allow growth rates to be determined in very dilute cul tures. Then, even if multiple species of cells and limiting resources are present the analysis can be extended. Application of the newer and improved analytical tech niques will allow the measurement of the rate of utili zation of the chemical species available as the resource and the measurement of the rate of formation of chem ical species for excretion leading to a balanced under stand of the economics of the bacterial cell.

Koch: Bacterial Choices Appendix A This appendix supplies a program for the simulation of dual uptake systems and internal consumption shown in Fig. 2. While it was written for an old version of Future Basic it could be adapted easily to Berkeley Madonna for the Macintosh computers, Microsoft Visual Basic or for C++, Java, etc. As presented here this program can be adapted to many formats, but it is not easy to use because some of the steps have to be made very small and therefore the program takes a long time to run. It would be much better if it carried out the simulation using, say the Kutta-Runge integration procedure. This has not been done because of the variety of detail that would be needed for different computer programs.
