<plain_text><page sequence="1">L.PREMATILLEKE IDENTITY AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE OBJECT HELD BY THE DWARFS IN THE GUARDSTONES OF ANCIENT CEYLON There are three groups of sculptures that adorn the guardstones which are placed on either side of the flights of steps leading to ancient shrines of Ceylon, namely, prinagha.ta (auspicious jar), vadmana (dwarf) or bahirava, as they are locally called and ndgardjaa (cobra king, shown both in zoomorphic and anthropomorphic forms). Among these, the dwarfs are usually shown holding a whip-like object hanging in a cluster of strands alongside the edge of the niche of the guard- stone (Figs. I, 2 and 3). This object is passed off by scholars merely as a club or a garland. A close examination, however, would reveal that it constitutes an object of great iconographical interest. The headdress of these figures is of two types: (a) s'aikha-crown formed by two conches with their open ends spreading out and (b) padma-crown formed by a double-petalled lotus (Figs. I and 2). Taking into consideration these two types of crowns, S. Paranavitana aptly identifies the two dwarf figures as representations of Saikhanidhi and Padmanidhi respectively who are the attendants of Kuvera, the god of wealth and regent of the North,. According to the Indian Silpaidstra text, Athfumadbhed.gama, Saikhanidhi and Padmanidhi are represented in the form of bhbitas on either side of Kuvera; they carry in their hands lotus flowers and are adorned with karayda-maku.tas2. There is no mention of their wearing jahkha- maku.ta or padma-maku.ta, as is the case with the representations of the Ceylonese examples3. It appears that the Ceylonese sculptors deviated from the Indian iconography and made an innovation in depicting Saikhanidhi as wearing a conch-crown and Padmanidhi a lotus-crown. No doubt this innovation was guided by the names Saikha and Padma, and this way of depicting the figures makes it easily recognisable. Refering to the object held by Saikha and Padma, S.Paranavitana says, "The club with which the personified treasures are armed may be compared with the gadd ('club' or 'mace'), the weapon of Kuvera, the god of wealth4." However, as stated above, this object cannot be dis- pensed with merely as a club or mace, nor does it represent a garland. With reference to the tradition of the portrayal of Saikha and Padma at the doorsteps as related in the Meghadita of Kilidisa, C. Sivaramamurti comments thus: "In sculpture also this motif is very popular, both as actual conch and lotus in early representation of the third and fourth centuries A.D. (cf. the marble carvings of the Ikshuviku period from a derelict Buddhist stfpa from the KrishnB valley, now in the collection of Rao Bahadur S. T. Srinivasagopalachari), I Artibus Asiae, Vol.XVIII, pp. 121-127. 2 See Rao, T.A. G., Elements of Hindu Iconography, Vol.II, Pt.II, p. 5 36. 3 The bhita from Vijaydrama (Fig. 3), however, conforms to the Indian tradition, for it wears a karan.da-makuta. 4 Artibus Asiae, op.cit., p. 124. 155</page><page sequence="2">and as dwarf Yaksas representing the nidhis or treasures with conch and lotus oozing coins re- presented beside them to explain their identity clearer; but they are numerous in the latter form, thus answering Kilidisa's line likhita-vapushau, 'with their bodies portrayed'. The numerous Chalukyan temples containing the dwarf Yaksa and the lotus and conch beside them are good examples. Two excellent examples form Kiveripikkam are now preserved in the Madras Museum (pl. V. I~3)s." Our figures 4 and 5 of the Kiveripdkkam sculptures are clear enough to show their identity as personifications of Saskha and Padma. On either side of the bhb~ta Saskha is a conch exuding coins which fall down in the fashion of strands, while in the case of the bhita Padma, the coin strands issue forth from a lotus flower. The earliest plastic representation of Saskhanidhi and Padmanidhi in the form of a conch and a lotus exuding coins is to be found in the Banyan capital discovered by Alexander Cunningham at Besnagar and which is now exhibited in the Indian Museum, Calcutta (Fig.6)6. This pillar capital is considered as datable to about the third or second century B.C. It is carved in the shape of a banyan tree surrounded by a railing. Surrounding the tree trunk are seen eight objects identi- fiable, according to J.N. Banerjea, with the symbolic representations of the eight treasures (aS.tanidhi) associated primarily with Sri-Laksmi and secondarily with Kuvera7. Among these, the conch and the lotus exuding coins have been correctly identified by Ananda Coomaraswamy with the two nidhis of Kuvera, i.e., Saskha and Padma (Fig. 7)8. It is presumable that, when the two treasures of Kuvera came to be shown in anthropomorphic form, the earlier aniconic form, too, was depicted beside the two bhb~tas in order to establish their identity. This explains the representation of the two nidhis as portrayed in the Kiveripikkam examples discussed above. As stated above, the artists of ancient Ceylon appear to have gone a step further in aiding the identity of the bhbitas by the introduction of the conch-crown and the lotus-crown. Among the numerous examples of Ceylon, a dwarf guardstone found at Rijagirilena-kanda, Mihintale (Fig. 8)9, should be considered first. It depicts a plastic style earlier than that of the much more evolved dwarf sculptures of the Abhayagiri ddgaba, Vijayabahu Palace, Vijaydrdma, etc. and may be dated between the fifth and the sixth centuries A.D. What interests us, in the present context, in this sculpture, is that the dwarf is seen holding in his left hand a wavy rod- like object which is often considered to be a club. A closer examination makes it clear that this 'rod' or 'club' is nothing but a tightly packed mass of coin strands issuing forth from a conch at the top. A sculpture similar to the one described above is seen on the lower terrace of the Bodhi tree at the Isurumuni vihdra, Anurdhapura (Fig. 9). The dwarf is wearing a conch-crown and is holding by his right hand the coin strands issuing from a conch. The Banikhanidhi aspect is thus quite apparent in this sculpture. It is clear that the two sculptures from Rijagirilena-kanda and Isurumuni vihdra bear a great resemblance to the Safikhanidhi representation from Kiveripik- s Memoirs of the Archaeological Survey of India, No.73, p. I I. 6 Coomaraswamy, A.K., Yakfas, Pt.II, Pl.1 i. J.N. Banerjea suggests that the banyan capital might have been originally placed on the top of a column standing in front of a shrine of Kubera-Vaitravana. See The Development of Hindu Icono- graphy, I956, p. Io05. 7 Banerjea identifies them as conch-shell, lotus, two vases all exuding coins and four similar bags or purses, their necks tied round by strings.

Anaridhapura kam, the difference between the Indian and Ceylonese examples being that, in the former, the downpour of coins is not held by the dwarf, while in the latter, the wavy coin strands are held by the dwarf and this remains a characteristic feature of the Ceylonese representations of Saikha and Padma. In the small dwarf guardstone placed on the landing of the flight of steps of the so-called Mahasen's Palace, Anuridhapura, the coin strands appear to be issuing forth from the crowns, and so is the sculpture found near the Ruvanvilisaiya (Fig. io),o. The representations of aAikha and Padma on the guardstones at Toluvila, Anuridhapura, clearly show two coin strands issuing forth from their respective crowns and are held by the bhbitas halfway down; their original signifi- cance of Safikhanidhi and Padmanidhi is still more indicated by placing a conch and a lotus at the end of the respective coin strands". The sculpture now preserved in the Archaeological Museum, Anuridhapura, is quite unusual 1o Parker identifies the object with a snake. This identification is evidently wrong, for he has mistaken the conch shape of the crown to be a snake hood and the coins for scales of the snake.

The dwarf in this case, holds on his left hand, a double- petalled lotus. A strand of circular objects, which make their iden- tity as coins clearer, issues forth from the lotus. The strand of coins runs along the edge of the arched niche encircling the up- per half of the figure and ends as usual at the end of the horizon- tal edge. It can be assumed that the counterpart of this sculpture, which is now lost, must have had the coins issuing forth from a conch held on the right hand of the dwarf. This unique guard- stone from Ceylon is a graphic example of the idea of the lotus exuding coins. These instances make it evident that the object held by the dwarfs in the guardstones of Ceylon is a further development of the symbols of Safikhanidhi and Padmanidhi, the original form of which, as represented in the Besnagar 'Kalpadruma' capital, shows a conch and a lotus exuding coins. It was stated above that, in the later examples ofguardstones such as those found at the Abhayagiri dgiiba and Vijayabahu Palace, the object resembles a sort of whip, for unlike in the examples discussed above, the coin strands in these sculptures are fixed to a handle (Figs. I and 2). These strands always run down along the edge of the lower half of the vertical line and then along the horizontal edge, giving the appearence that the dwarf stands trampling the 'coin whip'. Such a representation would suggest the flexible nature of the object and does not warrant its identi- fication with a club or a mace. Hence, it is reasonable to consider the object as a 'whip'. Why should it form a whip? This brings us nearer to the babirava concept which is an estab- lished tradition among the Sinhalese. As guardians and protectors of treasures of the sacred sites, these bahiravas are supposed to punish those who try to rob or meddle with the sacred treasures contained in the religious structuresm. Hence the babhiravas, as these dwarf figures are popularly known in Ceylon, hold a whip in their hands. It is conceivable that the dwarf figures, in their developed form, may have resulted from a compromise between the two concepts of Saikha-Padma on the one hand and of the bahirava on the other. Our hypothesis is further supported by the tradition maintained by the people who take oaths and make vows in front of the dwarf figures at the Abhayagiri dagiiba, which are addressed as 'Saikha-bahirava' and 'Padma-bahirava' respectively'3. 12 Parker, H., op.cit., p. 142. ,a The last line of the stanza recited on invocation of the bhitas is as follows: 'Jetavanavihiravif Sahkha-bahiravam (Padma- bahiravam) bhaje'. It should be noted that the popular tradition still considers the Abhayagiri dagaba to be the Jetavana digdba and vice versa. I am thankful to the chief kapurdia of the so-called Jetavana vihara for supplying me with the above line of the invocatory stanza. 161</page></plain_text>
