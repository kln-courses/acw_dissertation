What's that you say! You never heard of the Gzyzbowski Foun- dation? And you call yourself a marine micropaleontologist (marine geologist, paleoceanographer, or other other euphe- mism for a practicing earth scientist)! The Grzybowski Founda- tion, the brainchild of Mike Kaminski (London) and Marion Gasinski (Krakow), is a non-profit foundation associated with the Geological Society of Poland, and has for its prime purpose the support of our glorious "subdiscipline" in all its manifesta- tions (something we can all rally behind in these days of dimin- ished expectations). Don't look now but it has just published its fourth Special Publication in as many years and the tradition of high-quality is maintained in this magnificent volume. The Indian Ocean was formed by the Late Jurassic fragmenta- tion, and subsequent Early Cretaceous dispersal, of Gondwana- land (and its constituent parts: India, Australia and Africa/ Madagascar). Drilling by the Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) in the early 1970s yielded a large amount of foraminiferal data the most significant result of which was the discovery of the unique deep-water Cretaceous agglutinated benthic foraminif- eral ("Krasheninikov") fauna on the Argo Abyssal Plain. This fauna, while comparable in many respects to the so-called "flysch type" agglutinated benthic foraminiferal faunas well- known in northern hemisphere basins in the Carpathian, Cauasus and Alpine Mountains and NW Europe, offshore Can- ada and Labrador Sea, retained, nevertheless distinct character- istics, among them the presence of numerous morphotypes with a smooth, agglutinated wall texture. Unfortunately the material garnered from early drilling was unable to play a significant role in (Cretaceous) biostratigraphic and paleoecologic inter- pretation owing to the discontinuous nature of coring. With the advent of continuous coring under the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) and the recovery of a major part of the Upper Jurassic and Cretaceous on ODP Legs 122 and 123 (1988) in the eastern part of the Indan Ocean, it became clear that these Mesozoic fo- raminiferal faunas were a gold mine capable of providing im- portant information on the evolution of the Indian Ocean. This is the main inspiration behind this book. Anne Holbourn and Mike Kaminski have made a thorough syn- thesis of all available benthic foraminiferal material from the Lower Cretaceous of the eastern Indian Ocean. A quantitative examination of some 443 samples from 10 DSDP/PDP sites/holes yielded a benthic fauna of 260 species, almost equally divided between agglutinated (132) and calcareous (128) taxa. A six-fold biostratigraphic zonation is established for the Valanginian to lower Cenomanian and a revised biostra- tigraphic/chronostratigraphic framework made based on an in- tegration of the benthic fauna with calcareous nannoplankton. A thorough review of earlier studies is presented complemented by an overview of the sequence of benthic foraminiferal assem- blages observed at each site/hole. Calibration of biostratigraphy to the "standard integrated magnetochronologic scale (Grad- stein et al. 1994, 1995) is made via integrating data from other microfossil groups and displayed in Figure 15. However, I found an element of confusion in this figure as a result of a printer's error: seems the uniform/homogenous "red" for the bi- ostratigraphic distribution of several zones which follow each other sequentially resulted from the printer's use of too much red ink so that the various shades of color did not reproduce faithfully as intended. How are we to differentiate the range of these different zones under such conditions? Also the stra- tigraphically highest of the zones listed here is the Berthelina cenomanica Zone (just above the Pleurostomella reussi Zone) shown to be correlative with the mid-upper Albian. Yet, no such zone is identified in the paper and, in fact, the stratigraphically highest (defined) zone, just above the P. reussi Zone, is the Spi- roplectella gandolfi Zone (upper Albian-lower Cenomanian). The microfaunas treated here represent neritic to abyssal pa- leoenvironments and serve to delineate the sequential marginal subsidence and evolution of the eastern Indian Ocean during the Early Cretaceous. The global distribution of mid-Cretaceous black shales has been related to intense intra-plate volcanism and associated high atmospheric C02, warm and equable cli- mates. Cyclic changes in climate and productivity (and dysoxic bottom waters) are reflected in alternating high and low diver- sity benthic foraminiferal assemblages at the sea floor. The authors review the distribution of faunas in the Lower Creta- ceous on the eastern Indian Ocean in terms of these alternating conditions, linking impoverished Glomospira assemblages to dysoxic conditions whereas diversified calcareous assemblages are linked with well oxygenated conditions. Operating from/within an eclectic taxonomic framework the authors demonstrate the essentially cosmopolitan nature of most deep water benthic foraminiferal faunas justifying their astute observation that "'endemism' is often anthropomorphic, ex- pressing taxonomic bias rather than real biological differ- ences,..." (op. cit., p. 22). At the same time the authors do recognize a certain degree of endemism among certain faunal elements: the relative rarity/absence of epistominids, mars- sonellids, falsogaudryinellids and praedorothiids, typical of Te- thyan regions. As a result of this study, however, it is now possible to make more accurate biostratigraphic correlations with the well known Lower Cretaceous sequences in the Te- thyan and northern hemisphere boreal regions, although the authors refrain from constructing such a useful regional biostra- tigraphic correlation chart. The bulk of the book is given over to a comprehensive taxo- nomic treatment of the large and diverse microfauna. While not- ing the unsatisfactory state of classification among the agglutinated taxa and the Nodosariacea, the authors make a val- iant effort at a state-of-the art taxonomy and classification against the background of careful comparison with type mate- micropaleontology, vol. 44, no. 2, pp. 209-210, 1998 209</page><page sequence="2">Review of Lower Cretaceous Deep-Water Benthic Foraminifera of the Indian Ocean by Anne E.L. Holboum and Michael A. Kaminski rial in museums and private collections in Europe and Australia (Holboum for the calcareous taxa, while Kaminski relied on his encyclopedic familiarity with agglutinated taxa). This is com- plemented by a balanced (27 agglutinated, 26 calcareous) set of high quality SEM plates and nicely executed shaded line draw- ings in the text that bear an uncanny resemblance to those that illustrated foraminiferal mongraphs by VNIGRI micropaleon- tologists in the 1950s-1970s. How comforting to leam that they were, indeed, drawn ab natura by a retired VNIGRI artist named "Boris". The volume concludes with an Appendix in which is listed all the quantitative data (counts) from the different DSDP/ODP sites/holes and a taxonomic index. In this day of disappearing expertise in treating microfaunal groups from a "world view", comprehensive compilations of this nature are all the more im- portant as a source of basic information. They serve to unify the disparate elements of what is a basically a very complicated sys- tem. The authors, and the Grzybowski Foundation, deserve our hearfelt thanks for having prepared and published, respectively this handsome volume.
