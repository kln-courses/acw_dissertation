<plain_text><page sequence="1">32 Scythian and Olbian settlements in the Lower Dnieper region Valeria Bylkova Interaction between Scythians and Greeks has been studied for over a hundred years, but the subject retains its topicality. Additions to the fund of archaeological source material in the last quarter of the twentieth century have created the requisite conditions for the investigation of substantive problems which fall within the scope of the above theme. An important result of these investigations has been the determination of the boundaries of the Greek poleis and the elucidation of the meaning of the 'polis-chora' and 'Greek-barbarian' antitheses in terms of the archaeological data. Against this background there are renewed such questions as the ethnic character of the population of the rural territories of the North Pontic poleis at different chronological stages, its expansion and shrinkage, the elucidation of the cultural traditions of a mixed population etc. The correlation between ethnos and archaeological culture is a separate theoretical problem which cannot be examined in a short paper such as this. Nevertheless, the archaeological material does allow us to tackle such questions. The content of this paper is determined by the fact that the source material accumulated up to the present time demonstrates differences between the settlements of Scythia and the territory of Olbia, (or, more accurately, between Scythian steppe culture and that of the agricultural hinterland of Olbia, that is between the 'outer' and 'inner' lands). In this sense the settlements of Olbia most distant from the centre are of especial interest in that it is precisely in this zone that contacts between the bearers of different cultures are most likely to occur. A particular feature of the situation under review is the fact that it is a matter of interrelations between a nomadic Scythian population and colonist-farmers, and of the spread of Olbian culture in lands which were not the object of colonisation in its initial stage in the Archaic period. The investigation focuses on two groups of settlements (an 'outer' and an 'inner'), which arose simultaneously at the turn of the fifth-fourth centuries BC and which coexisted in the fourth century and the first third of the third (FIG. 32.1). Originally, however, they belonged to two different archaeological cultures: one purely Scythian, the other principally Greek but with some local elements. As for the 'inner' group, more than 150 monuments belong to the Classical and early Hellenistic period in the territory defined by the spread of Olbian culture, if we include those known only from surface material and those which have no cultural layer (Kryzhitskii et al. 1990). A large proportion of the settlements of this period were located on territory already occupied by the colonists in the Archaic period, but some settlements arose on lands which earlier had not fallen within the sphere of influence of Olbia, that is the eastern region, and the materials from them are analysed in the present paper. The closer the settlements are to Olbia, the more densely they tend to be situated, but all of them, including sites on the borders of the 'great chora' of Olbia, which was established at the turn of the fifth-fourth centuries BC and at the very beginning of the fourth century, are identical in their archaeological characteristics and, accordingly, in the economic activity of their inhabitants (agriculture, fishing, trade), in cult practice and so on. One may note only that there are more sites in the 'old lands' and there is an observable concentration of populated points around the settlements with the deepest cultural layer (Kryzhitskii et al. 1989, 102). As for the newly-settled eastern region, there are no grounds for assuming the existence of a hierarchy of settlements. The few settlements in the eastern 'frontier' region are independent of each other. There is no evidence of dominance and, with the exception of the city of Olbia, no observable gravitation towards any centre. Most probably, the population of the settlements was linked directly with Olbia by water and land routes. Thus, the Dnieper-Bug sector of the coast and river valleys was only completely occupied quite late by the settlers, by the fourth century BC, but in accordance with the overall scheme of colonisation. Olbian settlements are found on the right bank of the lower reaches of the Dnieper in the Bug-Dnieper loess plain, a choice of location which corresponds with the predominantly agrarian character of colonisation. This is a region of dark chestnut-coloured soils. The settlements are sited on high banks cut by ravines, and the places chosen were the most convenient for fishing and sailing. The sites extend along the bank of the river,</page><page sequence="2">298 VALERIA BYLKOVA il II SÌ il o¿ On Q iS ^ 1 s SI fi li it ¡s lì Slit 1 'O - eft - O -</page><page sequence="3">SCYTHIAN AND OLBIAN SETTLEMENTS IN THE LOWER DNIEPER REGION 299 their length never less than twice their width, with an area usually of 2 to 4 ha. The settlement of Glubokaya Pristan' (FIG. 32.1: 3) is quite large, with fortification walls enclosing some 10 ha (Buiskikh 1989), but judged by other indicators it cannot claim to be a central place. All the settlements are densely built up and show elements of systematic planning: an arrangement of structures can be traced along the shoreline and on an axis running inland from the bank. As was usual in the rural territory of the polis, no centre in the form of an agora or similar space is found in these sites. What we have are farmsteads of the Classical Greek type, in each of which might live a family and its servants, and which are accompanied by a particular set of household structures. These make up the private space. Non- dwelling structures were also located on territory adjacent to the settlement. Though finds of bones of domesticated animals are very numerous, specially built stalls have not been discovered anywhere. All of the settlements show evidence of several building periods, but they were inhabited throughout by a population of the same culture. Excavations of the settlements under review were conducted in 1950 by I. Ratner (Glubokaya Pristan'), and more recently by M. Abikulova (Usad'ba Litvinenko), S. Buiskikh (Glubokaya Pristan'), V. Bylkova (Belozerskoe and two others). As far as one can judge from the areas excavated, the settlement included building complexes which comprised dwel- ling structures, ancillary premises, cellars, wells, cisterns, pits, etc. At Usad'ba Litvinenko (Stanislav 2; FIG. 32.1: 2), in a small excavation (A), the remains were uncovered of a ground-level dwelling with mud-brick walls, a clay floor and a stone hearth (Bylkova 19960, 7-8, 458, fig. 4). A layer of ash 17 cm thick found above the floor, along with the presence of finds in situ on the floor, attests that the house was destroyed by fire. Associated with it are two household pits, located alongside and 3.3 m apart. They are both of the same type, bell- shaped in section, and differ little in size or form. The diameter of the neck of pit no. 1 is 1.15 x 0.95 m, that of the bottom 2.6 x 2.4 m, and the depth is 1.5 m. The second pit has a diameter of 0.8 m at the neck, 2.15 m at the bottom, and a depth of 1.5 m. The bottoms and walls of the pits were carefully smoothed and the clay of the bottoms hardened by fire. Among the varied material in the secondary ash fill were found fragments of amphoras and other pottery which were consistent with the finds on the floor of the dwelling. These structures are characteristic of the second building period in the settlement. To the earlier per- iod belongs a cistern for water, 4 m deep and 1.1 m in diameter at the bottom, with a trap for sediment 0.48 m in diameter and o. 12 m deep. A large pit of uncertain function, located alongside the cistern, was in use at the same time. It was oval in plan, 3.2 x 2.2 m at the neck and 2.15 x 1.5 m at the bottom, and the flat bottom lay at a depth of 1 .4 m below the level of the subsoil. To a depth of 0.7 m below that level the walls were cut at an angle of 45o and thereafter almost vertically. After they ceased to be used, both these early structures were filled with clean clay which contained no finds. The dwelling to which they belonged was not discovered, most probably because it had been destroyed by erosion of the river bank. In the settlement of Belozerskoe (FIG. 32.1: 4), taking into account the work of the 2002 season, an area of about 2000 m2 has been uncovered in the main excavation. Here too, two main building periods have been identified. Despite major disturbance of the cultural layer, some stratigraphie observations are possible. Both the earlier and the later structures are oriented in line with the river bank. As far as one can determine the orientation of walls within the squares investigated, and even in other excavations, they invariably run north-east-south-west. In sectors which were not built up a cultural layer was deposited, but it was only sparsely filled with material. One gets the impression that the planning principle was preserved unchanged over the entire life of the settlement (approximately 100 years). In any case, if a sector is empty, it is always so and the same observation holds for the built-up sectors. Apparently, the territory was divided and laid out in one go. The first period is characterised by large and varied household structures of complex design, by semi- dugouts used both as dwelling and household premises, and by houses with mud-brick walls and tiled roofs. Only the subterranean parts of the structures of the first period are preserved, and the largest of these, and the most complex in terms of construction, are located in the western sectors. In each sector cisterns for storing water were found, typically 3-5 m in depth with shallow depressions to trap sediment and facilitate cleaning, and one or two large storage pits, more than 2 m deep with a base diameter of 3 m. In the north- western sector there was in addition a large vaulted cellar, about 4 m in diameter and 2.5 m in height, with a distinctive entrance (FIG. 32.2: 18). In this last case the cistern was unique (FIG. 32.2: 56). It was 5 m deep with three niches at different levels, and was coated with plaster of a special composition. It seems to have been in use for a long time. Such a complex cistern with its niches could only have been cut into a loess subsoil. The rest of the cisterns are similar to those of the same date from Olynthos, where eight houses were equipped with cisterns, which were also located in the courtyard (Robinson and Graham 1938, 307-9). Other types of pit are encountered equally in both building periods and are in fact characteristic of all Olbian settlements. The basic form is pear- or bell-shaped or trapezoidal, with a narrow upper part and a capacious body (FIG. 32.2: 5, 42; FIG. 32.3 a: 8-10). They range from 1 m to 1.8 m in depth and have a lower diameter of i.ç-2.21; m. In all the pits of this construction, both</page><page sequence="4">300 VALERIA BYLKOVA S ' v / ' ' CO • ( ® h 3^ 0 12 3 4 5mS'""" /z^/^' y "' t V^r¿¿' &gt;s^ i Jf II ' / /i¿, J2.2.

In some cases they might be covered by a post-supported roof. Pits are also encountered with straight walls, 0.7-1.5 m in diameter and up to 1 m deep (FIG. 32.3 a: 7). It has not been possible to determine precisely what kind of ground-level buildings were located in the sectors investigated, as a result of the poor state of preservation of the cultural layer and the levelling operations which took place at the time of major reconstruction. With regard to the ground-level buildings of the first period one can only go by the ruined mud-brick walls and the construction debris (FIG. 32.4 0, ¿, d). What household structures there were within and outside the houses one can only conjecture from the fill. In the case of the large pit no. 42 and cellar no. 18, which were located side-by-side (FIG. 32.2), large quantities of mud bricks from the walls lay on the floors, creating the impression that the walls had collapsed into them, that is that they were interior structures. In the south-western sector the largest and deepest dugout structure, no. 63 (FIG. 32.3 ¿), which may have been a household basement, stands out. It has a regular rectangular shape with sides 6.15 x 3 m, its area is almost 17 m2, and it is sunk 1.5 m into the subsoil. All the walls in the subsoil are carefully faced to their full height with mud bricks 0.46 m long and 0.09 m thick. The bricks are made of well-puddled clay with vegetative additives, as revealed by the voids they left. The domestic function of the basement is confirmed by the presence in the centre of a large round pit with a diameter of 3.15 m at the bottom and 2.4 m at the neck. The pit was back-filled with almost clean clay and the top was covered with several layers of clay, which were then heated. The basement subsequently continued in use. In the centre of the south-eastern wall a buttress of mud brick, 0.6 x 0.5 m, was added from the floor to the level of the subsoil, dividing the basement into two almost square parts. In the fill of this structure there were large masses of brick-clay, especially on the western side, as well as stone, wood and large iron nails. It is clear that quite high walls had fallen in, and one may assume the existence of living quarters above it. Two other early semi-dugout structures, nos. 20 and 80 (FIG. 32.3 &lt;r, d) with areas of 4-5 m2, also have a regular rectangular shape, which is typical of Olbian building. Their walls were made of mud bricks and wood was used for supporting constructions and roofing.</page><page sequence="6">302 VALERIA BYLKOVA -^ ' » V) U I L X_r¿J 'J ( | ft 4 a.

It is possible that in the first building period there existed in the settlement simple one- or two-roomed houses, as are assumed to be common in other Greek territories in the Classical period (Jameson 19900, 103). The buildings of this first period were completely destroyed, the ground was levelled and compacted, and new construction took place on the site. This occurred at the end of the third or beginning of the last quarter of the fourth century BC. For the levelling a layer of ash was used, and part of the walls and pavement were constructed directly upon it. Their remains are revealed primarily in the form of fallen brick and stone, but portions of undisturbed strata are also preserved. In the second building period multi- room, ground-level houses were erected, of stone/ mud-brick construction with clay floors and roofs of the same Sinopean tiles as before. Subterranean structures consisted only of pits of modest dimensions and simple construction. Sections of pavement were found, the largest 9 m2 in area. These were made of unworked slabs of limestone, or a combination of stones and amphora fragments, or, sometimes, potsherds set in clay. One may distinguish four built-up sectors - north-western, south-western, south-eastern and north-eastern. Between them lies an open space which is about 4 m wide on average. The remains of three synchronous farmhouses of the second period were discovered. Local (shell) limestone was used and the slabs were not always carefully worked. Usually only the upper surface in the higher courses of the masonry was smoothed, but in some cases regularly shaped blocks of slightly different sizes were used (e.g. 0.57 x 04 x 0.16 m; 0.5 x 0.32 x 0.19 m, and so on; FIG. 32.4 e). Judging by the masonry corners that were found and stones with holes for door-pivots, the houses at this time were multi-roomed. The distance between two parallel lines of masonry was 4.4 m, and one fully preserved room totalled 14.8 m2 in area. The remains of four hearths were found, but given the circumstances in which they were discovered, it is not possible to determine with confidence whether or not they were located inside the house. In one instance a clay brazier and a set of hand-made kitchen pots were found, most probably outside the house (Bylkova 2000, 31). In general, the experience in our settlements confirms the view that there was no set type of hearth or fixed location for it in the Greek house (see Tsakirgis, this volume). Excavations at Glubokaya Pristan' (Sofievka 2; FIG. 32.1: 3) have uncovered a central farmhouse with a paved court, part of the adjoining street, and portions of four ground-level dwellings which were furnished</page><page sequence="7">SCYTHIAN AND OLBIAN SETTLEMENTS IN THE LOWER DNIEPER REGION 303 with stone hearths and roofed with thickly laid reeds covered with clay (Buiskikh 1989, 23-4). The inhabitants of these houses made use of twenty-six pits of medium size and twelve rubbish heaps. Five semi-dugout houses were also found in the settlement, which were in existence as early as the first half of the fourth century and remained in use until life in the settlement ceased in the first third of the third century. In this settlement two mounds of ash were also discovered (Buiskikh 1993). One was 15 m in diameter and 2 m high, the other, more oval in plan, was 20 x 10 m in diameter and 1.2 m high. They were located 22 m apart in two ancient gullies. Taking into account the depth of these gullies, the thickness of these accumulations of ash increases to 4 m and 2.8 m respectively. All the material encountered in them shows the traces of the action of fire. It includes clay 'loaves', anthropomorphic statuettes, terracotta fragments and graffiti. Judging by the date of the pottery, the ash piles were established at the time of the settlement's foundation and continued in use until the cessation of life there. In other settlements such large, specially designated ash piles are absent, but the habit of depositing ash separately from other refuse, in pits originally used for storing foodstuffs, may be observed. The fine ash of this fill contains a great quantity of finds, including specific artefacts of fired and unfired clay - 'loaves', 'cakes', beads and weights. The ground-level houses in all the settlements in Olbian territory had walls of mud brick on stone socles. In those cases where it is possible to trace the complete length of the wall of a room, it comes to approximately 4 m. The masonry is typically 0.3-0.5 m thick, and the socles are not normally preserved to a height of more than two courses of slabs laid flat. Special resilient foundations made of alternating layers of clay and ash are sometimes found beneath the socles and pavements. This type of construction is known from other parts of the Greek world (Ertel 1994). Floors were of tamped clay with holes cut in them for containers, though in some cases the pots and amphoras stood on the floor itself. Oil lamps, sets of sinkers for fishing-nets and loom-weights were found constantly in dwellings and, in two cases, stone anchors. For roofing, imported Sinopean tiles of the Sicilian system were usually used (FIG. 32.4 c). The most prolific use of roof tiles in all the Olbian settlements was found in the easternmost settlement of Belozerskoe. They comprise 2-7% of all the ceramic finds from different parts of the excavation, but there is no correlation with other 'luxury' items. While ground-level houses are familiar from every Greek territory, on the coast of the Black Sea structures dug into the subsoil are also common and these too are considered by most investigators to be Greek (Kryzhitskii et al 1989, 103-20). Since, however, the Greek use of pit dwellings is a matter of some debate (Kuznetsov 1999), it is necessary to examine the question in greater detail. Shallow semi-pit houses, of which ten have been discovered in the three settlements discussed above in an excavated territory of over 3000 m2, are usually 10-30 m2 in area and sunk 0.3-0.6 m into the subsoil (FIG. 32.3 #), although in the early levels smaller buildings are encountered. They are usually rectangular, but the corners are sometimes rounded. Occasionally there is a niche cut for a stone hearth, while elsewhere a place is reserved on the floor. To judge by the number of fragments, portable clay braziers were commonly used. The above- ground walls of all these semi-pit structures are of mud brick. As in the ground-level dwellings, the remains of timbers and large iron building nails are frequently encountered. Dugout dwellings are, as a rule, only slightly sunk into the subsoil, and one gets the impression that the 30-40 cm involved correspond simply to the masonry foundations of ground-level houses. The principal difference lies only in the fact that they are single-roomed, while the above-ground houses are multi-roomed. There were semi-pit structures which were not dwellings (e.g. Bylkova 1996^, 104, fig. 4: 1, 11). We find them in every settlement and they form part of the household complex. They are sunk to different depths, from 0.4-0.6 m to 1.4 m, round or rectangular in shape, with post-supported roofs. If the pit is deep, there are steps at the entrance. These household structures were widespread throughout the Olbian chora and the main types did not change significantly over time (Kryzhitskii et al 1989, 42-50, 104-6). The two earliest dwellings in the settlement of Belozerskoe are small, only 4-5 m2 in area. The pit of one of them, 0.7 m deep, is in plan a quadrilateral with its parallel sides aligned to the shoreline (Bylkova 2000, 29 fig. 3: 1). The entrance, with three steps, is located on the north-west side, along with a rounded hollow, which served as a shelf, to judge by the position of the pots which fell from it. At a depth of 0.4 m from the level of the subsoil was a layer of burnt material, ash, charcoal and stone, along with building nails and a clay fill containing lumps of burnt clay. On the floor lay a number of broken vessels - amphoras, table- and kitchen ware of rather rarely found shapes (Bylkova 2000, 28-30). In this case we perhaps have a separate kitchen, insofar as the entire floor is chock-full of pots and there is no space for a bed. The only pit house, sunk 1.2 m deep, was located on the edge of the steep river bank. (It was discovered in the unpublished reconnaissance of M. Dmitrenko in 1946, and the description which follows is taken from the field documentation.) It was reinforced with stone/mud-brick walls and the roof was perhaps of earth or reeds and clay. Inside there was a niche cut for a hearth. On the bottom of the pit were found three Olbian coins, amphoras, conical clay loom-weights, spindle-whorls, and hand-made pottery.</page><page sequence="8">304 VALERIA B YLKOVA Fig. 32.5. Excavation IX in Scythian Kamenskoe settlement (by B. N. Grakov, 1954, 217, fig. 23): 1: hearths; 2: post-holes; j: hollows and ditches Analogous structures, of the same date and also in the lower levels, are found in the settlements close to Olbia and are considered to be the dwellings of the colonists (Rusyaeva 1968, 205-8; Marchenko and Domanskii 1986, 55-7). It would seem wrong to deny to the population which lived in these semi- pit houses their affiliation with Greek cultural traditions. Such assumptions were prevalent at a time when Scythian settlements had not been investigated, but new data allow us to compare 'inner' and 'outer' settlements. The Scythian settlements are sited on the banks of the smaller tributaries of the Dnieper, typically on headlands. They vary in size, from 1, 2 or 4 ha to about 1200 ha in the case of Kamenskoe, the dominant fortified settlement in the region (FIG. 32.1: 7). The settlements of this group are characterised by significant open areas, and their territory is much less densely built up. In those parts of the settlements where dwelling and household structures are concentrated, there is no trace of systematic planning, with buildings of different types and sizes scattered haphazardly (FIG. 32.5-6). Hypothetically, one can combine the dwelling structures into complexes with the closest ancillary premises, but no principle of association can be discerned. Ethnographically, a similar picture may be observed at the beginning of sédentarisation, where the scattered distribution of their houses identifies the settlements of recently settled nomads (Cribb 1990, 156-61). In the Scythian settlements of the Lower Dnieper region, house construction takes the form of pit structures and ground-level wattle-and-daub dwellings. The large ground-level buildings at Kamenskoe range in area from 50 to 80 m2, and are reconstructed according to ditches (FIG. 32.5). In the settlement of Chernecha (FIG. 32.1: 6) a ground-level building, about 9 m2 in area and possibly a seasonal dwelling, was excavated. Inside were three pits of various depths and diameters, one of which may have been for a post (Gavrilyuk and Bylkova 1992, II, 48 fig. 15: 1). The remains of wattle-and-daub walls and clay plaster are constantly encountered on these sites and they attest the existence of ground-level structures of various functions with such walls. Pit and semi-pit structures are found in all Scythian settlements and were in use at the same time as the ground-level houses. At Kamenskoe they are reconstructed as rectangular, ranging in size from 77 to 150 m2 (Grakov 1954). At Pervomaevka 2 (FIG. 32.1:</page><page sequence="9">SCYTHIAN AND OLBIAN SETTLEMENTS IN THE LOWER DNIEPER REGION 305 1 / V / Fig 32.6. Excavation III in Scythian Pervomaevka 2 settlement (excavations by the author): a dugout dwelling (A) and pits. 5) one pit structure is projected to be up to 40 m2 in area, with walls rising 2.5 m from the floor (Gavrilyuk and Bylkova 1992, II, 36 fig. 3). It has a stepped entrance on the south side and around the perimeter are benches cut from the subsoil. Smaller houses are less deeply dug out. One semi-pit structure of about 8 m2 consisted of a rectangular room with rounded corners and an oval stepped entrance. Its walls were 1 .4 m in height and in the southern part of the room there was a 'bench' (FIG. 32.6: A). Apparently, part of the roofed space lay outside the pit since a fully-preserved hand-made pot was found on the rim. A post to support the roof may have rested on a stone set in the north-western part of the structure. Rotten wood from construction timbers survived in the fill of several dwellings. At Lysaya Gora (FIG. 32.1: 8) there is a rectangular semi-pit structure,</page><page sequence="10">3O6 VALERIA BYLKOVA 5 m2 in area and sunk 0.8 m into the subsoil, which has two steps and an earthen bench (Gavrilyuk and Bylkova 1992, 1, 11). As for hearths, they take the form of small, round or oval clay platforms, or alternatively shallow pits. They are found within semi-pit and other structures, but also outside them. As for pits, the most common type is broadly circular or oval in plan, with walls which are either vertical or converge towards the bottom; some have a rather irregular form. They range in diameter from 0.4 m to 2.5 m, and in depth from 0.3 m to 1.3 m. Thus, it is clear that dugout houses in the Olbian and Scythian settlements show marked differences in building type. They differ first of all in depth and in the character and height of their external walls. The Scythians never made use of mud brick, not to mention roof tiles, and only extremely rarely exploited the stone which outcrops immediately alongside their settlements. The Scythian dwellings, moreover, have sleeping platforms cut from the subsoil. One observes also a different type of hearth and attitude towards its ash. Earlier, B. N. Grakov had noted that a distinctive feature of Kamenskoe was the absence of ash: in only one case was ash found in a dwelling (Grakov 1954, 62-3), and this observation was confirmed for the Scythian settlements excavated subsequently. The Scythians did not designate special places or receptacles for the collection of domestic ash, as was customary among agricultural peoples. The Scythians, likewise, did not make use of special lamps in their houses, and indeed the entire set of finds is quite different. We thus have no reason to link the use of dugout structures in the territory of Olbia with the presence of Scythians among its population. And if we take into account the fact that dugouts appeared in the Olbian chora in the Archaic period, when there were no Scythian settlements in the steppe zone at all, then the connection with the Scythians becomes quite untenable. Independently of the origin of this type of house, it was widespread specifically in the territory of Olbia, while in the interior of Scythia other forms arose. This means that we can only consider them a culture-forming indicator if we take into account all the details and not simply the fact that they were to some extent subterranean. CONCLUSIONS In recent field excavations the spread of Greek culture in the Lower Dnieper region has been well documented, and one can equate the area of diffusion with the Olbian chora (Kryzhitskii et al 1989; Bylkova 1996^). In our region we can investigate the model of Greek cultural evolution within a nomadic environ- ment. Research has shown that even the easternmost 'frontier' settlements of the Greek culture are not at all like the settlements of the Scythians themselves, located higher up the Dnieper. In this case one cannot define the substantive differences between the popula- tions of Olbian and Scythian territory by way of the customary opposition of a 'hellenised local population' and a 'local population without obvious hellenisation', insofar as we are presented with two distinct cultural traditions and not simply external indicators imported into the culture. Comparison between the Olbian and Scythian spheres in the Lower Dnieper region shows major differences in the built environment, in the choice of natural resources for exploitation, and in the topography, planning and construction of the settlements themselves. Although the Greek and Scythian settlements were contemporary, their appearance was conditioned by different factors. We find no similarity, archaeologically, in the character of these sites, not even to the extent that one might speak of significant cultural influence. The main difference between the type-sites consists in the system of their organisation of settled space. The Greek settlements present a systematically organised space, while the Scythian do not. Any variations in settlement patterns among the Olbian population exist within the same culture, which is on the whole totally different from the Scythian. This holds good even for the eastern 'frontier' zone, where it was anticipated that greater reciprocal influences between cultures might be encountered. As it turned out, the situation in the 'nearer chora? was reproduced in the most distant settlements down to the details. As a result of the destruction of the upper part of the cultural layer, ground-level buildings are only partially preserved. Nevertheless, the remains of traditional Greek houses, with a multiplicity of rooms organised around an interior court, the existence of which may be explained as a product of environmental conditions and social requirements (Nevett 1994, 108), are to be found on all sites, including the eastern 'frontier' settlements under consideration. The problems in large part inhere in the interpretation of the dugout dwellings at Greek sites. The finds in situ within them exhibit the usual range of artefacts, and do not suggest a special function or ethnic character. It would seem that there were no significant differences within the household, with different people using different types of living space. In every dwelling the set of artefacts is remarkably similar. Since the dugouts are not found at native sites in the period when the Greek colonists first settled in the territory of Olbia, it is not possible to trace their origin to the influence of the local population. The accommodation to unfamiliar natural conditions called forth new features in the culture of the Greek colonists, but the essential foundations of their existence were preserved even in these remote regions. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would like to thank David Howorth for translating the Russian text, and Sergei Djachenko for drawing the figures.</page></plain_text>
