Life Sci., 20 (1998), 35-40 The Multiple Meanings of 'Teleological' Ernst Mayr Museum of Comparative Zoology, Harvard University 26 Oxford Street, Cambridge, Massachussetts 02138, USA Ghiselin (1984) has repeatedly called attention to the frequency of scientific controversies caused by equivocation, that is by the use of the same term for several different concepts. It was because I realized that 'ideological' was one of these equivocal terms that I undertook my first analysis in 1974. Various other authors, such as Pittendrigh (1958), Goudge (1961), and Ayala (1970) had done so before me, but I felt, righdy or wrongly, that their classification of kinds of teleological did not provide clear-cut classes. Since the word 'teleological' to most people, particularly to scientists, had a rather metaphysical flavor (hence Pittendrigh's introduction of the term teleonomic), I proposed a terminology that largely avoided the use of the term teleological and restricted its use to the non-existent cosmic teleology. I discriminated a number of clearly defined classes of phenomena to which the term teleological had been applied and characterized them by a distinguishing terminology. I showed that one must distinguish between end directed processes, such as those controlled by natural laws, and goal directed processes, such as those controlled by genetic programs. And I concluded that natural selection is not teleological, because, even though it produces results, it has no definite goal. These conclusions of mine are attacked in the preceding paper by G. J. Krieger. I shall not attempt to refute Krieger's claims in detail; it attributes to me too many statements I never made. I recommend to the reader of Krieger's paper always to check what I have really said. For instance, Krieger claims that one can summarize my treatment of teleology in two statements, one being 'teleological processes are those that involve conscious deliberation of an active agent'. I ask, where in my writings have I ever said anything even vaguely similar to that statement? Krieger rejects my endeavor to make a terminological distinction between the several meanings of the word teleological. He says that this would merely 'obfuscate...teleological language.' It is my considered view that what obfuscates teleological language is, on the 0308-7298/90 $ 3.00 © 1998 Taylor and Francis Ltd</page><page sequence="2">36 ERNST MAYR contrary, to lump the five phenomena which I now distinguish, under the single term teleological. Here are the reasons for my conclusions. In my previous classification of teleological, I had no category for purposive behavior because I feared to get involved in anthropomorphism. I said 'The use of words like "purposive" or "goal directed" seemed to imply the transfer of human qualities such as intent, purpose, planning, deliberation, or consciousness to organic structures and to subhuman forms of life. Intentional, purposeful human behavior is, almost by definition, teleological. Yet I shall exclude it from further discussion, because the word "intentional" or "consciously premeditated," which are usually used in connection with such behavior, endanger us with getting involved in complex controversies over psychological theory, even though much of human behavior does not differ in kind from animal behavior'. (Mayr 1974). Much literature has been published since then, showing that purposive behavior in thinking animals does not differ in any way from human purposive behavior. It was an error of judgment on my part to exclude purposive behavior from the classification of phenomena to which the term teleological had been applied. Therefore I now admit it as a fifth class in my classification of teleological; this class contains 'purposive activities of thinking organisms.' As I now see it, the term 'teleological' has been used for five entirely different kinds of phenomena. To avoid confusion it is advisable to restrict the use of the word 'teleological' to cosmic teleology and to use instead other more specific terms for the other phenomena to which the term teleological had been applied in the past. 1. Teleomatic processes Processes in inanimate nature which reach an end stage determined by the universal laws physics I call teleomatic processes. The law of gravity and the second law of thermodynamics are among the natural laws which most frequently govern teleomatic processes. In much of the philosophical literature such end directed processes have been called teleological. See Mayr 1992. 2. Teleonomic processes A teleonomic process or behavior is one that owes its goal directeclness to the operation of a program. It only occurs in</page><page sequence="3">THE MULTIPLE MEANINGS OF 'TELEOLOGICAL' 37 proximate causation. Teleonomic processes are particularly common in development and in animal behavior. The term teleonomic is not a substitute for the term teleological. The term applies only to one of the five different meanings of the term teleological. A program might be defined as coded or prearranged information that controls a process (or behavior) leading it toward a goal. A program is not a description of a given situation but a set of instructions. 3. Adapted features Features that contribute to the adaptedness of an organism are in the philosophical literature often referred to as teleological. I consider this designation as misleading because these features are stationary systems. For me, the word teleological is not appropriate for phenomena that do not involve movements. Such usage is a remnant of the natural theologians who considered adaptations evidence for purposive design by the Creator. Actually adaptedness is an a posteriori result of natural selection rather than a priori goal seeking. Adapted features being, so to speak, executive organs for teleonomic processes could also be considered somatic programs. Again, for a more detailed analysis see Mayr 1992. 4. Purposive behavior Man and various kinds of warmblooded vertebrates are capable of purposive behavior. Several species of jays bury in the fall acorns and pinon seeds and return to these caches (which they remember remarkably accurately) and retrieve this food, when at the end of the winter natural sources of food are largely exhausted. The literature on animal behavior is full of descriptions of such animal behavior that is clearly purposive, revealing careful planning. Another famous example is the hunting strategy of lionesses. When preparing an attack, the pride may separate into two groups, one of which moves behind the intended victim, cutting off its escape route. In such purposive planning, there is in principle no difference between man and animals capable of thinking.</page><page sequence="4">38 ERNST M AYR 5. Cosmic teleology Prior to Darwin and, to some extent, far into the twentieth century, a belief was widespread that changes in the world were teleological in nature, leading to ever greater perfection. Actually such trends toward perfection are not found in nature nor have any mechanisms been discovered that could produce such trends. Indeed all phenomena that were formerly attributed to cosmic teleology can now be explained either by natural laws or by natural selection. It is now quite clear that cosmic teleology does not exist. I shall omit any reference to the theological use of teleology (Krieger's external teleology), from Saint Augustine to natural theology, because this kind of explanation is no longer part of philosophy. Furthermore, teleomatic processes are also externally caused. I agree with Ghiselin that Darwin was not a finalist and have argued this in a special paper (Mayr 1984). A strict distinction must be made between using teleological language referring to different processes and accepting teleological explanations. It is perfectly legitimate to use teleological language in the description of teleonomic processes and purposive activities. It is, however, not correct when Krieger claims that 'Colin S. Pittendrigh, George G. Simpson, George C. Williams, and Ernst Mayr have opted to restrict the usage of teleological language in biology, replacing it instead with talk of "teleonomic" processes'. Actually all of these authors have defended the use of so-called teleological language, but since the word teleological has so many meanings, they (beginning with Pittendrigh) have recommended to designate as teleonomic all activities controlled by a program. As Pittendrigh said quite rightly, it is scientifically completely justified to use teleological language when saying 'the tortoise came on land to lay her eggs.' Krieger quotes Ayala as saying that actions or processes can be considered teleological in evolution when they 'can be seen to be purposefully or teleologically ordained towards [obtain] goals'. 'Ordained' is strictly theological language and 'purpose', as far as I can see can be attributed legitimately only to a thinking organism. For instance, the heart has no purpose, it does not continuously think Ί must keep on beating to keep the blood flowing'. The correct way to refer to the heart is to say it is adapted for its role as a pump to maintain the circulation of the blood. To repeat, only thinking organisms have a purpose. The careful stalking of its prey by a carnivore is a characteristic illustration of purposive behavior.</page><page sequence="5">THE MULTIPLE MEANINGS OF 'TELEOLOGICAL' 39 Krieger's long criticism boils down to a simple argument: is natural selection a teleological process? Krieger says yes, while I say no. No one questions seriously that Darwin's theory of natural selection is valid. However, we no longer say, nature selects the best, but instead say that so-called selection is rather a process during which the less fit tend to be eliminated. As one recent philosopher has articulated it, 'Selection is a nonrandom process of elimination'. Naturally, when the less fit are eliminated, the more fit are left over. But there is no agent that 'selects' them; nor is there any goal. Paleontologists have pointed out again and again that evolutionary trends are rarely rectilinear for any length of time. Rather, they frequently change direction and sometimes completely reverse themselves. Selection clearly never has a goal, it only, so to speak, rewards a posteriori the possession of certain fitness giving characteristics. And the process starts anew in every sexual generation. The starting point in every generation is a uniquely different genetic population which is then exposed to a new set of biotic and abiotic environmental conditions. Of course, there is a 'winning ticket', but it is different in each generation. Ayala calls this a teleological process, which I do not. The high extinction rate of species shows that the end point of the non random process of elimination sooner or later is extinction, but I would hesitate to call selection a teleological process because, sooner or later, it has an end point (extinction). Almost anything on earth has an end: a book does, a vacation does, an opera does, the day does, etc. Are these telic phenomena? The life of an individual has an end, is life a telic process? This is why I said it was 'dangerous' to classify telic phenomena as teleological. Pittendrigh (1958) introduced the term teleonomic because he saw, just as I did, how many meanings the word teleological had in the writings of various authors. However, he failed to give a precise definition and in the ensuing years the term was most frequently used for two different phenomena: (1) programmed activities and (2) adapted structures. I narrowed it down to (1), because adapted structures (2) are static and do not move toward a goal. I had first included man-made objects like loaded dice under teleonomic because they were 'programmed' to behave in a particular way, but I later excluded such objects as being only analogous. I nowhere said that they were 'purposive', as claimed by Krieger. Krieger says, 'all teleological systems are purposive', but I say: (a) What is a teleological system? and (b) only the actions of thinking organisms are purposive. This shows again how important it is to distinguish the five kinds of phenomena to which the term teleological</page><page sequence="6">40 ERNST MAYR has been applied indiscriminately. Contrary to Krieger, I nowhere said, 'a system should be goal directed', but rather that 'a process or behavior is teleonomic if it owes its goal-directness to a program'. There is a decisive difference between the two statements. Krieger throughout his account ascribes to me the frequent use of the word purposive. So far as I know I almost entirely avoided this use. I cannot see that Krieger has shown that my definition of teleonomic is circular. When he rephrases it as two statements, it becomes redundant, but not circular. Let me not waste more words on details. Let the reader simply look at Krieger's summary in which he states why he wants to discontinue the use of the word teleonomic and return to an indiscriminate use of the word teleological for all five different kinds of phenomena and processes for which the word teleological had been used in the past. In his last sentence, Krieger accuses me of having 'obfuscated' the teleology problem. I leave it to the reader to decide, what is more obfuscating, my effort to distinguish between at least five usages of the word teleological for very different phenomena or processes and to discriminate between them by a specific terminology, or Krieger's endeavor to lump them again (including a rejection of Pittendrigh's term, teleonomic) and to call all five phenomena simply teleological, no matter how different they are from each other.
