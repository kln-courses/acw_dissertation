<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Quarrel of the "Vowels" Victor Aboulaffia It is still difficult to assess the extent to which Arthur Rimbaud's work has been assimilated by its readers within the generic idealism of the lyrical tradition extending from Romanticism to Symbolism, the two limits of nineteenth-century French poetry. Starting with Marcel Raymond's important history of modern French lyricism, De Baudelaire au Surrealisme (1933), Rimbaud's poetry has been commonly perceived as occupying a major, and often pivotal place in the nationalistic continuum of the French language and its lit- erary tradition. M. Raymond actually grants the young poet a high standing in the pantheon of what may be called the "Symbolist Company." He begins his influential study of modern French po- etry by tracing the "sources vives du mouvement poetique contem- porain" to a branching out of the tradition at the start of the 1850's, establishing Baudelaire and Rimbaud as the two major heralds of lyrical modernity. But the deeper origin of modern poetry, accord- ing to Raymond, should be seen in the way nineteenth-century poetic activity took over, after the Enlightenment's critique of su- perstition, the role faith and the church once played in managing man's relationship to the unknown and the irrational. "II apparte- nait a l'art (mais non a lui seul) de satisfaire a quelques-unes des exigences humaines que la religion, jusque-la, avait reussi a exor- MLN, 107, (1992): 774-794 ? 1992 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">M L N 775 ciser."' The integration between man and cosmos, thought and being, becomes at that point in time the calling to which the lyric poet answers when he strives to "ressaisir les puissances obscures et de tenter de surmonter le dualisme du moi et de l'univers" [11]. And Raymond concludes by stating his thesis regarding the societal function poetic activity inherited from religious discourse: "II ap- parait donc que les poetes, des cette epoque, et dans la mesure ou ils s'efforcent de faire de l'art une operation vitale, remplissent dans notre societe une fonction compensatrice" [12]. This vital, sublimatory function ascribed to the poetic field is doubly compen- satory. It makes up both for the loss of credibility undergone by religious discourse itself and for the fundamental sense of inade- quacy experienced by man in his relationship to the universe. Art, then, is important for its harmonizing, therapeutic function, as it responds to man's quest for metaphysical certainty, carrying him from the imperfect world of sense experience to the perfect realm of the spirit. Thus bracketing the possibility that a majority of man's ills and lacks may be of a material and social nature, Marcel Raymond speculates that aesthetic activity virtually fulfills human- ity's spiritual longing for perfection and totality. The solidarity of this philosophy of art with the set of traditional onto-theological assumptions ruling the discourse of absolute metaphysics clearly emerges in M. Raymond's thinking, as he con- cludes, concerning Rimbaud's contribution to the evolution of French poetry: "La poesie, desormais, tend a devenir une ethique ou je ne sais quel moyen irregulier de connaissance metaphysique; un besoin la travaille de changer la vie, comme le voulait Rimbaud, de changer l'homme et de lui faire toucher l'etre" [12, my italics]. This is an ambitious poetic agenda and the claims Raymond attrib- utes to Rimbaud need attention. First, he hesitates as to whether to assign an ethical or a metaphysical quality to the new course poetry would be taking at this juncture. Although he allows for both pos- sibilities, Raymond's caution at taking seriously, with the rigor granted to philosophical discourse, the cognitive claim of poetic discourse, is made obvious by the classical turn of phrase: "je ne sais quel. . ." These catchwords intimate a sense of delight in the aware- ness of being taken in. His wavering is furthered by the restrictive 1 Marcel Raymond. De Baudelaire au Surrealisme (Paris: Jose Corti, 2nd rev. and aug. ed., 1947) 11.</page><page sequence="3">776 VICTOR ABOULAFFIA character of the adjective "irregulier" qualifying the specific way poetry reaches out to the unknown and the invisible, in contrast, of course, to the more regular path followed by philosophical reason. The ways of poetry are thus essentially irrational, outside the do- minion of the cogito; poetry gives speech to man's unconscious in the same manner that philosophy expands the realm of conscious- ness. Paying homage to Albert Beguin's study of the literary influ- ence of German Romantic thought upon French Romanticism, L'Ame romantique et le reve, Raymond also identifies Rousseau as a precursor, then views, in the tradition of intellectual history, the promotion of the irrational and the unreal at the start of the Ro- mantic era as a reaction against the eighteenth-century Philosophes and their "conception rationnelle et positive de l'univers et de la vie" [12]. Since this rationalistic, middle-class world view would become dominant in the course of the nineteenth century, gaining ground during the industrial revolution as the bourgeoisie consol- idated its political power, the poets would continue their "reven- dication metaphysique" against the rule of reason through the only means at their disposal, namely with words and images aiming to transcend the gap between subject and object in order to restore man to an "existence pleniere" [12], that is, to a sense of wholeness. And in order to provide access to this putative fuller state of being, to an existential plenitude, the linguistic medium, that is to say, the concrete condition and means of production of the poetic experi- ence, must erase itself. "Toute image s'organise secretement en symbole, les mots cessent d'etre des signes pour participer aux choses elles-memes, aux realites psychiques qu'ils evoquent" [14, my italics]. Marcel Raymond offers here a critical usage of the crucial term "symbole." What is a symbol? It is a sign which conceals its being a sign, hides its conventional nature, in order to eliminate the dis- tance between subject and object, the gap between thought and thing, experience and its representation. Whether the referent is empirical or psychical does not matter, what's important is that the material linguistic medium should make itself invisible and inau- dible, disappear in order to provide for an illusion of the presence of "the thing itself." In this perspective, which has provided the standard in the field of nineteenth-century French poetry studies until the late 1960's, the understanding of the term "symbol" is important. One needs to consider this notion for a while, for al- though neither this word itself, nor any of its morphological vari- ants, ever appear-not even once-in Rimbaud's available corpus</page><page sequence="4">M L N 777 of writings, his entire work has often been interpreted from the perspective of this Romantic notion. It is the one Marcel Raymond relied upon in the above quotation. As formulated in his explica- tion of the crucial term, the poetic word turns into a symbol when it ceases being a sign and starts partaking instead of the nature of the thing which it represents, be it an objective or a subjective reality. The notorious turn of phrase "aux choses elles-memes" is doubtless a reflection of the influence the phenomenological cur- rent in philosophy was having in France at the time the book was written, as the expression inevitably recalls Husserl's formulation of the ontological project as "a return to things themselves." The possibility of this return has epistemological implications for poetic discourse, as it makes conceivable processes of presentation and subjectification in the many virtual associations between object, sign and subject, and as all the associations of the elements within these signifying sets become specified by a relationship of repre- sentation to one another. Paul de Man's inquiry into "the intentionality of rhetorical fig- ures" has focused on the changes undergone by a number of "rhe- torical key-terms" which in the course of the nineteenth century have established "a subjectivistic critical vocabulary."2 His probing analysis of the cliches of contemporary criticism led him to notice that the use of common, but important, terms such as metaphor, symbol and allegory was still "governed by assumptions that go back at least as far as the romantic period" [188] in European literature. Foremost among these changes, de Man argued, was the prominence acquired around the turn of the eighteenth century by the figure of the symbol, at the expense of the more traditional figure of allegory. "The supremacy of the symbol, conceived as an expression of unity between the representative and the semantic function of language, becomes a commonplace that underlies lit- erary taste, literary criticism, and literary history. The supremacy of the symbol still functions as the basis of recent French and En- glish studies of the romantic and post-romantic eras" [188], he wrote. In contradistinction to the perception of allegorical devices, which in the programmatic statements of some German and En- glish Romantic writers were relegated to the domain of mechanical 2 Paul de Man, "The Rhetoric of Temporality," in Blindness and Insight: Essays in the Rhetoric of Contemporary Criticism (Minneapolis: Univ. of Minnesota Press, 2nd aug. ed., 1983) 188 and 187.</page><page sequence="5">778 VICTOR ABOULAFFIA phenomena, the ascendant value of the notion of symbol depended on its being perceived as an organic form, through a relation of analogy between natural and cultural growth. "Allegory appears as dryly rational and dogmatic in its reference to a meaning it does not constitute, whereas the symbol is founded on an intimate unity between the image that rises before the senses and the super sen- sory totality that the image suggests" [189]. This valorization of the symbol, which is now given the divine privilege to bridge and unify distinct ontological domains of the linguistic, the sensible and the intelligible, is similar to the transcendental power M. Raymond granted to the symbolizing process, a power whose belief in, he concedes in his Introduction, can best be understood as "la conse- quence d'un reve ancestral a demi noye dans l'inconscience, le reve d'un univers magique, ou l'homme ne se sentirait pas distinct des choses, ou l'esprit regnerait sans intermediaire sur les phe- nomenes, en dehors de toute voie rationnelle" [15]. The scientific and philosophic debate that went on throughout the age of the Enlightenment between advocates of mechanical and of organic models of universe and mind, eventually leading to this development in aesthetic theory, has been thoroughly presented by Meyer Abrams and need not be resumed here.3 What Paul de Man, however, further analyzes in the context of that debate between the two Enlightenment intellectual currents is the reactivating of old theological assumptions in poetry's renewed claim to absolute metaphysical truth at the start of the nineteenth century. The Ro- mantic moment is best described by de Man in his summary of Gadamer's view of the period's shift in rhetorical priorities. In Warheit und Methode, Hans-Georg Gadamer makes the valorization of symbol at the expense of allegory coincide with the growth of an aes- thetics that refuses to distinguish between experience and the represen- tation of this experience. The poetic language of genius is capable of transcending this distinction and can thus transform all individual ex- perience directly into general truth. The subjectivity of experience is preserved when it is translated into language; the world is then no longer seen as a configuration of entities that designate a plurality of distinct and isolated meanings, but as a configuration of symbols ulti- mately leading to a total, single and universal meaning. (188) And as the symbolizing process rather than its allegoric counter- 3 The Mirror and the Lamp: Romantic Theory and the Critical Tradition (London: Oxford U.P., 1953).</page><page sequence="6">M L N 779 part was increasingly taken to be more exemplary of the presum- ably unlimited creative potential of man's spirit, it was integral to the Romantic redefinition of the poetic mission. Now fashioned, thanks to the "endless suggestiveness" of the symbol, after the in- finite creativity of divine speech within nature, poetic genius would be aiming at the same disclosure within human expressiveness, now conceived of as natura naturans, of the presence of an everlasting transcendental signified. But, as Paul de Man insisted, what gets obfuscated in this rhetorical shift toward greater immediacy, trans- parency and continuity between man and a now supposedly en- tirely totalizable environment is an awareness of the temporal and spatial limitations of language, that is of the material and ideolog- ical constraints and heterogeneities pertaining to the nature and traditions of the literary medium. As noted in the hesitant views quoted earlier, Marcel Raymond did not give complete credence to the claims he himself made on behalf of the epistemological, or cognitive, powers of poetic sym- bolism, eventually dismissing it as artistic fancy, or again, as the avatar of a childish stage in mankind's coming to terms with natural phenomena, a form of primitive magical thinking, in Freudian terms, of the childish wish to master the external world through the sheer, unmediated exercise of one's thought. And as a matter of fact, when he comes to present Rimbaud's contribution to mod- ern French poetry, after having discussed the works of Baudelaire, Verlaine and Mallarme, the critic situates "la trajectoire suivie par cette ame hors de toutes les voies communes" [37] on an ethical plane, that of moral and social revolt, rather than in a metaphysical or mystical aesthetic dimension. Immediately following the earlier characterization, he is careful to distinguish Rimbaud's ethical and social priorities from Mallarme's worshipping of art, as he goes on writing about the former: "Ce n'est pas lui qui eut songe qu'un Livre legitimeraitjamais l'existence du monde. La poesie-'une de mes folies!'-est d'abord a ses yeux une methode pour exalter la vie et depasser l'homme" [37]. What this statement actually stresses is that Rimbaud took poetry to be a means, not an end, that is to say, an instrument of social action and change, including actions di- rected at changing poetic discourse. This ethically determined, concrete rather than abstract, negativity turned against an entire political and cultural order-a public ethos-is then the actual as- pect of Rimbaud's work on which Raymond focuses in his final summation.</page><page sequence="7">780 VICTOR ABOULAFFIA Le demon de Rimbaud est celui de la revolte et de la destruction. Le "temps des assassins" a commence pour lui. Ce que l'on appelle la civil- isation et l'homme de l'Occident, voila sur quoi d'abord il reve de faire le bond de la bete de proie. L'Etat, l'ordre public et ses contraintes, "le bonheur etabli," le train conventionnel de l'amour et des families, le christianisme, la morale, tous les produits de l'esprit humain, en somme, il les nie et les bafoue. (37) Marcel Raymond's assessment of Rimbaud's moral revolt is fine; but this is a good place to make an important point regarding the thin line demarcating an ethical from a metaphysical interpreta- tion. In spite of his perceptive reading of the socially grounded import of Rimbaud's negativity, the critic goes on, in a manner typical of a number of later historians of the Symbolist movement, to dilute this profane ethical basis within the vague perspective of a theological condemnation of the shortcomings inherent to hu- man nature in general, raising issues related to universal evil and sinfulness that eventually dehistoricize the poet's writings and re- inscribe them within the Romantico-Symbolist idealistic contin- uum. "Resterait a extirper la racine du mal, l'esprit humain lui- meme, tel qu'il s'est forme lentement au cours des siecles" [37], he continues, adopting a variety of internal monologue that ventrilo- quizes Rimbaud's voice, after having identified the poet's battle as one waged against "tous les produits de l'esprit humain." The hy- perbolic "tous," Rimbaud's most abused rhetorical turn, should be taken as the influence of the poet's style upon a sympathetic critic who, in his paraphrase, could only take at face value a recurrent figure of speech and grant it a literal status. Nonetheless, when read in context, Rimbaud's particular enunciation of feelings of entrapment and estrangement always brings attention to a deter- minate sense of Western limitations and closure, and therefore, to contingent and surmountable conditions of alienation. Even Ray- mond's ultimately idealistic reading of Rimbaud's revolted mood inadvertently makes this point, since the word "produits" used in his last statement unwittingly pays tribute to a materialistic herme- neutics, as one instead would have expected here the less industrial word "creations," the standard term in the spiritualistic critical lex- icon of the 1930's, to refer to the lofty achievements of the human mind. Rimbaud's formulation of the Romantic project in Une Saison en enfer, however, seems to question the idealism involved in the po- etic quest, rather than to confirm it. The main force of the "livre</page><page sequence="8">M L N 781 paien" tends to demystify Romantic ideology by stating the failure of its grandiose dreams, rather than to maintain their validity. This sense of defeat is clearly articulated in "Adieu," the work's con- cluding section, as the poet recapitulates past writing ambitions, only to dismiss them for having been no more than the effects of a subjected self's delusional and compensatory dream of imaginary power. J'ai essaye d'inventer de nouvelles fleurs, de nouveaux astres, de nou- velles chairs, de nouvelles langues. J'ai cru acqu6rir des pouvoirs sur- naturels. Eh bien! je dois enterrer mon imagination et mes souvenirs! Une belle gloire d'artiste et de conteur emportee! Moi! moi qui me suis dit mage ou ange, dispense de toute morale, je suis rendu au sol avec un devoir a chercher, et la realite rugueuse a 6treindre!4 I suggest that this passage strongly urges the lyrical subject to return to an ethical enunciative position and to a social version of reality ("la realite rugueuse"), an aesthetic position already held in the satirical verses Rimbaud wrote during 1870 and 1871. The emphatic repetition of a sublime ego's claim to omnipotent power: "Moi! moi qui me suis dit.. ." signifies the demise of the speaking subject, rather than his triumph. This stressful denunciation of the lyrical self can thus be seen as exposing the mystification involved in the Romantic genius' solitary adventure. This passage can then be read as a general denial of the Romantic project to achieve a metaphysical disclosure of being through poetic language, and therefore contradicts Marcel Raymond's interpretation of Rim- baud's statements as an affirmation of poetry's mission to "reach being." The next paragraph of "Adieu"-the poet's farewell to the kind of mystified aesthetics he wished to leave behind-makes this point even more strongly, as the writer states he will now ask for- giveness "pour m'etre nourri de mensonge," that is, for having absorbed deceitful Romantic illusions. Many great scholars have taken the Romantic aesthetics for granted in their perception of Rimbaud's literary involvement, without recognizing the complication and subversion of this agenda by the iconoclastic poet. Guy Michaud's erudite three vol- ume study of the fin-de-siecle literary movement, Le Message poet- 4 Oeuvres (Paris: Garnier, 1981) 240.</page><page sequence="9">782 VICTOR ABOULAFFIA ique du Symbolisme (1947), is among the most influential works on the topic. Michaud provides a good deal of inspiring commentary concerning the middle part of Rimbaud's output; but it remains basically focused on Une Saison en enfer, and is intent upon viewing this moment in Rimbaud's evolution as if it were the only, and the last, in the poet's writing career, in order also to read him as a precursor of the Symbolist trend. Like Raymond, Michaud singles out of Rimbaud's text these flashy and reiterable utterances which indeed, when taken out of context, may be interpretable as a proto- symbolist aesthetic position, but which turn out to be more com- plicated in relation to these two movements when read in context and with appropriate critical attention. A similar observation can be made regarding interpretive perspectives adopted by important Anglo-American studies of the period. Foremost among these, Ed- mund Wilson's series of lectures entitled Axel's Castle (1931) was a major contribution to the field: it adopted a comparative approach to the Symbolist movement, placing its evolution and transforma- tion in the wider context of European literature of studying the common aesthetics uniting an array of writers, from Yeats to Val- ery, Eliot, Proust, Joyce and Gertrude Stein. This book is interest- ing in that its fellow-traveling writer assumed an ideological per- spective quite hostile to the idealistic withdrawal from life and re- treat into a remote aesthetic realm that he associated with the early Symbolist reaction to Naturalism, in the literary domain, and to the triumph of bourgeois values, on the social front. "One of the prin- cipal causes, of course," writes Edmund Wilson, "for this with- drawal of the Fin-de-siecle poets from the general life of their time, was the fact that in the utilitarian society which had been produced by the industrial revolution and the rise of the middle class, the poet seemed to have no place."5 He defines the basic Symbolist attitude as promoting "the ideal of renunciation of the experience of the outside world for the experience of the imagination alone" and "the withdrawal of the individual from society" [257-58]. What place does Edmund Wilson assign then to Rimbaud's poetry in this scheme of things? It is an ambiguous one, coming in the study's concluding chapter entitled "Axel and Rimbaud." After having covered some fifty years of literary history, he identifies the move- ment's archetypal opus in Villiers de l'Isle-Adam's convoluted neo- 5 Edmund Wilson, Axel's Castle: A Study in the Imaginative Literature of 1870-1930 (New York: Scribner's, 1969 reprint of the 1931 ed.) 268.</page><page sequence="10">M LN 783 gothic narrative, Axel (1890), which relates the melancholic con- cerns of a fallen aristocratic youth who finds serenity only by clos- ing his door to reality and espousing the mystical Rosicrucian faith. Wilson then proceeds to establish a parallel between Villiers and his more famous contemporary Huysmans, whose decadent aestheti- cism incarnated in A rebours's main character, Des Esseintes, also pointed to an escapist ethos. In this chapter, one would expect Rimbaud to stand out in contrast to the Symbolist mood of defeat and withdrawal; but Wilson, after having collated back to back a number of decontextualized quotations from Une Saison en enfer and from the "Lettres du Voyant," which make Rimbaud sound like the Symbolist writer par excellence, proceeds to present the poet's rejection of literature and choice of an adventurous life as the ultimate renunciation of all. Thus, in spite of its sympathetic tone, Edmund Wilson's representation of Rimbaud's contribution to French letters is actually quite disappointing from there on, for it amounts to little more than an anecdotal account of the poet's unusual life, with Verlaine in Paris and abroad in Africa; and the scholar's early version of these biographical events is actually made- up of more legendary than factual material. Henri Peyre is another major scholar who has shaped a lasting critical perception of Rimbaud's position in modern literary his- tory. His erudite study of French Symbolist literature had the ben- efit of a double audience, since he wrote for French as well as American readers and students of French literature. The introduc- tion to one of his shorter books on the subject, La Litterature sym- boliste (1976), makes an interesting point, unusual for a work of this sort, since it starts by stating that the study at hand will not concern itself with the poets of the French Symbolist school proper, the likes of Henri de Regnier, Gustave Kahn, Rene Ghil, Maeterlinck or Villiers, "mais ceux qui les precederent et ne s'appelerentjamais, et pour cause, 'symbolistes': Baudelaire, Mallarme, Rimbaud, Ver- laine, Laforgue."6 What Peyre is saying is that the former group's influence in French letters and abroad did not last, and is the least important in a normative definition of Symbolist poetics since by 1886, the time around which Mallarme had become the recognized master of the movement and entertained the younger generation of writers, among whom were Valery and the young Gide, in his Tuesday evening salons of the rue de Rome, the movement was 6 La Litterature symboliste (Paris: P.U.F., 1976) 4.</page><page sequence="11">784 VICTOR ABOULAFFIA yielding little more than pseudo-philosophical platitudes, poetic cliches and worn out literary devices. In remarks prefacing a chap- ter entitled "La Floraison symboliste," and covering the years 1885- 1895, the literary historian acknowledges in fact that the Symbolist movement itself showed "nulle unite reelle de doctrine ou de maniere" (127). What is a critic concerned with making sense to do then, but compile, select and organize those verses, views, and statements from a number of different writers using a notion as malleable as that of the symbol, draw out their similarities, and fabricate a climate of unity and coherence? Peyre hence finds this theoretical unity in the precursors' common allegiance to the "culte de l'art" and in their dedication to the creation of a poetic reality equally remote from the concerns of the "bourgeois et de la plebe." Tracing this attitude back in time to the Romantic elitist ideology, he draws a continuity between the aristocratic artistic movement and its Symbolist succession, inasmuch as both advocated the pri- macy of "la sensibilite" over analytic reason and directed their ef- forts toward the discovery of invisible and mysterious phenomena through irrational means. Other features which H. Peyre sees as defining Symbolist literature are "le culte de l'inexprimable, la quete du vague, l'idealisme philosophique et l'utilisation de sym- boles" [71], all features which he concedes can hardly be distin- guished in Rimbaud's poetry. Furthermore, in his presentation of the major precursors of the Symbolist generation (writers born between 1850 and 1865) from whose texts he extracted this sense of theoretical unity, Peyre discusses Rimbaud immediately after his chapter on Baudelaire. This choice of sequence is surprising since Mallarme and Verlaine were actually Rimbaud's seniors, first of all, chronologically, but also in terms of the literary influence these two poets exerted upon the next generation. One would also have ex- pected the former two poets' precedence in literary history to be respected on account of the more explicit contributions they made to the Symbolist aesthetic proper, as they often took on the role of public spokesmen, Mallarme in periodical interviews such as "Crise de vers," and Verlaine in his "Art poetique" and his many prefaces, for instance. Furthermore, in terms of doctrinal, thematic and technical transmission, it is clearly Mallarme's affiliation to Baude- laire, not Rimbaud's, which can provide the major line of continu- ity across the poetic generations. As I have already noted, one never encounters the term "sym- bole" in Rimbaud's poetry. Henri Peyre is clearly aware of this</page><page sequence="12">M L N 785 problem, since he starts his presentation of his work by noting: "I1 y a chez Rimbaud bien moins encore de textes paraissant mettre les symboles au centre de la creation poetique qu'il n'y en a chez Baude- laire" [25, my italics]. And further on, he adds: "I1 est clair aussi que certains des traits qui passent souvent pour caracteriser le sym- bolisme ne se rencontrent pas avec evidence criante chez Rimbaud: poursuite du vague et effacement de tous contours anguleux, nu- ances plutot que couleurs violentes, musicalite des vers ou des ver- sets en prose, poesie decorative ou mollement reveuse" [26]. What is it then that Rimbaud wrote, which made Peyre feel that he should occupy such a pivotal place in the Symbolist movement? It is the program of "voyance" taken in a strictly metaphysical, rather than in a political extension, which seems to fit the bill, although the literary historian acknowledges that the famous two letters ex- pounding Rimbaud's theories were not published until 1912 and 1926, and that "la generation symboliste n'en avait donc pas eu connaissance" [27]. Hence it is his interpretation of these letters penned by "l'adolescent tempetueux et le voyant Rimbaud" [27], an interpretation mostly derived from M. Raymond's and G. Michaud's earlier views, rather than from Rimbaud's actual poetic practice, which leads Peyre to write that "le poete a pretendu, non plus seulement retrouver dans les sensations et les objets d'ici-bas des correspondances swedenborgiennes ou platoniciennes avec un autre monde, mais bel et bien depasser et immoler le reel et le reconstruire" [26]. Let alone the fact that, again, one does not find the notorious term "correspondances" in any of Rimbaud's writ- ings, it is unlikely that he had come across the works of the Swedish mystic outside of Baudelaire's references to him in the Paradis ar- tificiels. And since the Bibliotheque de Charleville does not list The Marriage of Heaven and Hell among its holdings during that period, it is difficult to understand why Henri Peyre also attributes to Rim- baud "l'ambition demesuree de depasser l'homme en l'agrandis- sant," in order to conclude a few words later that "le tres jeune poete ambitionnait dans un mouvement de revolte m6taphysique et morale, de depasser les notions de bien et de mal, de marier ciel et enfer" [32]. The point here is that Henri Peyre is bent on interpreting Rim- baud from a perspective hostile to radical leftist combinations of poetic and historic discourses. This recuperative point of view be- comes evident in the following evaluation of Rimbaud's commit- ment to the Commune of 1871, which according to Peyre as well as</page><page sequence="13">786 VICTOR ABOULAFFIA to other conservative rimbaldians such as Pierre Petitfils, was noth- ing more than a passing fancy. Cette revolte litteraire de Rimbaud .... s'accompagnait d'une revolte politique et sociale: celle-ci n'a laisse que peu de traces dans l'oeuvre poetique, malgre trois ou quatre pieces vehementes criant probable- ment la sympathie du jeune homme pour les travailleurs et son indig- nation devant les massacres de la Commune. Quelques ecrivains qu'a du impressionner une autre revolution avortee, celle de 1968 (Pierre Gas- car entre autres), ont voulu lire un sens politique dans plusieurs pieces de Rimbaud: cela demande beaucoup de parti pris et plus encore de subtilite hermeneutique. (31) Henri Peyre's own "parti pris" is also apparent in his misrepresen- tation of the poet's position in political struggle, and this misread- ing typically informs the mainstream critical view on the issue of Rimbaud's historical engagement.7 The sonnet entitled "Voyelles" has long been the cornerstone of the idealist recuperation of Rimbaud. This poem's appropriation by the Symbolist movement proper started when Jean Moreas in- cluded in his account of the period the sonnet's influence on the movement's aesthetics.8 In his 1885 Traite du Verbe, the artist Rene Ghil had also contributed to restrict the illusive sonnet within the doctrinal limits of a theory of synaesthetic correspondences or "au- dition coloree," by turning Rimbaud into the absent father of the new generation of aesthetes and decadents. This moment of Rim- baud's sanctification by younger writers comes with an irony well expressed by the following letter penned by a journalist named Paul Bourde, from whom the poet had solicited in vain a favor concerning the possibility of newspaper employment. The letter was sent to Rimbaud in August of 1885, when the poet, now living in Africa, had left behind the salons he had always held in con- tempt. You probably don't know, living as far from us as you do, that you've become for a small cenacle in Paris a sort of legendary figure, one of those people whose death is announced but in whose existence some faithful will persist in believing, and whose return they await with im- patience.

Certain youths, whom I personally consider somewhat naive, have tried to found a system on your "Sonnet des Voyelles." This little group calls you its master and not knowing what has become of you, earnestly hopes that you will reappear one day to drag it out of its obscurity. Rimbaud never bothered to answer this letter; perhaps he was amused at the thought of having made disciples among a younger crowd, who now worshipped his fantastic alphabet. Ever since, the poem has been the object of myriad interpretations, some more outlandish than others.9 Voyelles A noir, E blanc, I rouge, U vert, O bleu: voyelles, Je dirai quelque jour vos naissances latentes: A, noir corset velu des mouches eclatantes Qui bombinent autour des puanteurs cruelles, Golfes d'ombre; E, candeurs des vapeurs et des tentes, Lances des glaciers fiers, rois blancs, frissons d'ombelles; I, pourpres, sang crache, rire des levres belles Dans la colere ou les ivresses penitentes; U, cycles, vibrements divins des mers virides, Paix des patis semes d'animaux, paix des rides Que l'alchimie imprime aux grands fronts studieux; 0, supreme Clairon plein des strideurs etranges, Silences traverses des Mondes et des Anges: -O l'Omega, rayon violet de Ses Yeux!'0 This famous sonnet occupies the same interpretive position that "Correspondances" holds in accounts of Baudelaire's ostensibly transcendental aesthetics.11 Just as the latter sonnet is convention- ally read as the poet's assertion of the unity of all things-senses and spirit, mind and matter, man and nature-Rimbaud's poem is taken to express the poet's hallucinated, but authentic vision of a mysterious universal harmony.

"Avec le sonnet des Voyelles," they claimed, "Rimbaud atteint la vision parfaite, celle oui toutes les perceptions se fondent, se renforcent, se confirment, celle qui ne se laisse de- truire ni par le dementi de la raison, ni par la resistance de ce que nous nommons le reel: vision si parfaite qu'elle devient hallucina- toire et qu'elle se superpose a la vue."13 When pressed, however, to specify the contents of the vision, or what he also calls an "illumi- nation," in the mystical sense of the term, Etiemble finally assesses the poem to be semantically "incoherent." In her still inspiring book on Rimbaud's life and art, Enid Starkie, unfortunately prompted by the word "alchimie" of line 11, chose to decode the entire text in terms of the cabalistic canon prescribing the various stages of the transformation of matter in the mystical quest for the philosopher's stone. "Now poetry became for him less an art than a magical exercise which would enable him to reach the regions beyond the world. Therefore his ideas became more significant for him than anything else; the search for wisdom and a philosophy more vital than the quest for mere beauty,"14 she wrote, referring to this moment of the poet's career, which she also associated to the voyance period. Rimbaud, however, did not stop writing poetry at that time and, if anything, as we shall see, moved further away from the search for a so-called philosophical wisdom. Moreover, poetry hardly stands as a metaphor for magic in Rim- baud's text; it is rather the other way around. The same hermetic hermeneutics also informs Jacques Gengoux's obscurantist ap- proach to Rimbaud, obscurantist since in his book it is not a single poem, but the entirety of Rimbaud's opus which is submitted to a delirious decrypting and rewriting by the literature of the occult.15 Other interpreters have moved to demystify the poem's aura by accepting the hypothesis emitted by Henri Heraut in an essay pub- lished by La Nouvelle Revue franfaise in 1934, according to which Rimbaud was simply reminiscing about childhood memories of a colored alphabet book, an illustrated abecedary, the kind French 12 "Le Besoin d'interpreter" in Clefs pour l'imaginaire (Paris: Seuil, 1985) 210. 13 Rene Etiemble and Yassu Gauclere, Rimbaud (Paris: Gallimard, 1950) 142. 14 Enid Starkie, Arthur Rimbaud (Norfolk: New Directions, 1961) 162. 15 La Pense'e poetique de Rimbaud (Paris: Nizet, 1950).</page><page sequence="16">M L N 789 children learned to read from during pre-school years. Enid Starkie actually gave weight to this more banal hypothesis, without having to abandon her spiritualistic reading-key, as she concluded her commentary on the poem with the following statement. "It is possible that both sources inspired Rimbaud in the composition of the sonnet. From his memory of the alphabet he got the idea of giving each vowel its own individual color; and from the doctrine of alchemy their sequence and meaning" [167]. Another outland- ish version of the presumably secret meaning hidden behind this sonnet shook up the scholarly world when, in 1961, Robert Fau- risson published a pornographic interpretation, based on the shape and position of each letter, rather than their sounds, and suggested that the poem as a whole should be read as the blazon of a female body in coitus.16 The erotic theme, however, is not a constant con- notation of the poem, and Faurisson was hard-pressed to make the shape of the characters correspond to the colors associated with them, and explain why a beautiful woman's hair would be green. In his annotation of the poem for the second Pleiade edition, Antoine Adam came close to demystifying the entire affair when he force- fully stated: "Rimbaud n'invoque ni metaphysique, ni doctrines esoteriques, ni synesthesies. II a simplement voulu 'inventer un verbe poetique accessible, un jour ou l'autre a tous les sens.' II a donc 'invente' la couleur des voyelles, c'est-a-dire qu'il a cherche quelles sensations elles pouvaient produire, quelles images elles pouvaient evoquer."'7 Adam, however, could not resist the temp- tation to overinterpret, adding some of his own text to the intrigu- ing letters' ongoing quarrel. Published in 1968 in Tel Quel, Jean- Louis Baudry's grammatological reading of the sonnet is among the most exciting. He dismissed any referential dimension to the poem, finding instead that "Voyelles" features the production pro- cess of textuality in general, highlighting the materiality of the signifier and its effects of representation. "Dans 'Les Voyelles' en effet le texte est a lui-meme sa propre representation,"18 he wrote. Interpreting the identification between the letters and the color as a displacement of the phonocentric opposition of the Western logocentric tradition-color and the visual in opposition to the spo- ken, rather than speech in opposition to writing-Baudry con- 16 Robert Faurisson, "A-t-on lu Rimbaud?" in Bizarre #21-22 (1961). 17 Oeuvres Completes (Paris: Gallimard, 1972) 901. 18Jean-Louis Baudry, "Le Texte de Rimbaud," Tel Quel #35-36 (1968): 55.</page><page sequence="17">790 VICTOR ABOULAFFIA cluded that "la manoeuvre de Rimbaud a pour but, dans ce sonnet, a la fois et dans un meme geste, la destruction de la representation et le renversement du rapport signifiant-signifie" [56]. It is indeed difficult to clear this poem from the metaphysical atmosphere a Symbolist tradition of reading has attached to it. As every rimbaldian scholar has observed, the sonnet undoubtedly draws on an esoteric notion of synaesthesia, also known as "the theory of correspondences," which postulates the interconnected- ness of various sense perceptions, and the possibility of transposing them into one another. Baudelaire had elegantly reformulated this imaginative notion in his "Salon de 1846" and used it again in "Correspondances." It is even probable that Rimbaud echoed these texts in May 1871, around the same time he composed "Voyelles," when he stated in the so-called "lettre du Voyant" that his goal was to "trouver une langue." He continued: "Cette langue sera de l'ame pour l'ame, resumant tout, parfums, sons, couleurs, de la pensee accrochant la pensee et tirant."19 Rimbaud's passion for totalization stands out here, but the entity referred to twice in this passage is language ("langue") itself. And the utterance stresses language's capacity to signify thought and phenomena, rather than to reveal the mystery of things; just as in the sonnet, the foregrounding of the vowels also brings attention to the linguistic being of poetry. Furthermore, the latter part of the letter's statement insists on the performative function of poetic language, that is, its persuasive force ("accrochant," "tirant") enacted by readers being drawn into the text's figurative performance.20 Another major difference between "Correspondances" and "Voyelles" consists in the fact that whereas the beginning of Baude- laire's sonnet asserts the invisible unity of all things, Rimbaud's sonnet rather evokes their visible multiplicity and differences. Each vowel is assigned a separate color and evokes affectingly and mor- ally different visual, tactile, sonorous or olfactive associations. Thus, it is the contrast, or the difference between "A" and "E"- black and white, "puanteurs" and "candeurs"-which is significant, not their resemblance or their secret identity. The poet actually placed these two vowels next to each other, rather than at either 19 OC, 252. 20 I argue in another study that these seemingly metaphysical utterances are often contextualized by a socially progressive frame of reference.</page><page sequence="18">M L N 791 end of the spectrum-which would have suggested gradation and integration-so as to stress these oppositions rather than to reduce them into a continuum. Furthermore, Rimbaud's sonnet starts of- fensively with an image of disintegration and death, and ends on a note of infinite alterity, otherness and strangeness. Disconcerting to the reader, this trajectory denotes a perspective on life much less reassuring than Baudelaire's observation of man by "des regards familiers," in a world in which the poet feels at home. Finally, it seems to me that the imaginative process of Rimbaud's sonnet is often blatantly linguistic and discloses a relational play among sig- nifiers and metaphors, rather than a deep metaphysical enterprise. For example, the most plausible motivation of the substantive "can- deurs," in apposition to the letter "E" and illustrating the color white at the start of the second quatrain, is philological or linguistic, rather than phenomenal or referential, since candor meant white in Latin. Likewise for the adjective "virides" qualifying "mers" at the start of the first tercet; this rare epithet associated with the letter "U" and illustrating the color green was simply selected on account of its derivation from the Latin word viride, for the color green. In these two cases then, the semantic relationship between the terms of the utterance yields at best a tautology from the perspective of systematic referential interpretations. The play of the text here consists in the reader being prompted into an impossible moral decoding of the second, uncommon, term, "virides," after having been induced to do so by the likely moral extension of "can- deurs".21 In a little known essay written as early as 1953, Emilie Noulet had already noticed the basic differences between the two famous son- nets. Commenting on the repeated usage of the device of enumer- ation in Rimbaud's sonnet, she asked the following question: "Si les quatorze vers de Baudelaire sont une formulation de l'Unite et de son corollaire, le symbolisme des choses crees, l'un et l'autre perjus comme revelation, peut-on en dire autant de 'Voyelles?' "22 Not only was her answer in the negative, insisting on the text's centrif- ugal forces, but she also stressed, long before it became common to do so, Rimbaud's strong emphasis on the autonomy of language. 21 I am grateful to Elisabeth Cardonne-Arlyck for her help in analyzing this move. 22 Le Premier Visage de Rimbaud (Bruxelles: Palais des Academies, 1953) 154.</page><page sequence="19">792 VICTOR ABOULAFFIA Loin de ramener la multiplicite a l'unite, ffrt-elle "tenebreuse", Rimbaud suit, dans le sonnet "Voyelles", une direction inverse. Ne pretend-il pas y defaire une unite conventionnelle (celle du mot) en ses parties, les liberant de toute cohesion, leur conferant une folle et arbitraire auton- omie? Le poeme n'a-t-il pas pour sujet l'eclatement d'un tout fragile en ses plus petits morceaux? Pour theme, celui de la dispersion, de la va- riete, de la multiplicite? Ce que marquent vigoureusement les nom- breux pluriels. Son mouvement est centrifuge. II chasse un a un des element brusquement individualises vers l'existence solitaire et les sig- nifications dubitatives. Ruine de la securite, mais vertu vitale de la dis- parite. (155) The threat to the reader's sense of security as to the semiotic mechanisms of language is what gives this poem its "writerly" qual- ity then, to use Roland Barthes' term for texts that resist definitive interpretation. Commenting on the outpouring of commentaries "Voyelles" has generated, Octave Mannoni suggested that the force of the poem lies in its laying bare the process of metaphoricity, opening up from within the poetic horizon of its epoch "la pure possibilite de faire glisser un mot a la place d'un autre" [213]. According to the psychoanalyst, it is when he is confronted with this text's resistance to give up its secret, or meaning, that the reader suffers from not knowing what to make of, or how to stop, the endless metaphoric process to which the poem subjects him. "La metaphore, ici, c'est precisement de dire que A est noir. C'est devant elle que le lecteur souffre, a tort ou a raison, d'un besoin d'explication" [212]. Perhaps this hermeneutic anxiety is indeed the strange experience Rimbaud was referring to when he wrote in his May 15, 1871, letter to Paul Demeny, "des faibles se mettraient a penser sur la premiere lettre de l'alphabet, qui pourraient vite ruer dans la folie!" [OC, 252]. For Mannoni, then, who resists the temptation to offer yet another meaningful explication, or closure of the poem's semiotic play, the links between the vowels and the gamut of colors, sounds, feelings, and other qualities the poet as- sociated with these characters are fundamentally arbitrary; they exemplify the way language itself is said to be, and do nothing more than reveal a poet's awareness of the infinite possibilities of play, slippage and displacement linguistic signifiers allow for in the articulation of human experience. These figural links are thus be- yond the reach of any interpretive effort bent on reducing them to a preexisting order of meaningfulness or experience, be it bio- graphical, psychological, arcane, or otherwise.</page><page sequence="20">M LN 793 Mannoni places this literary development, which eventually leads to the Surrealist appropriation both of Rimbaud and of the Freud- ian notion of the unconscious, within the context of poetic evolu- tion in general, whose essence he locates, as did Freud, in the skillful poet's ability to disguise, or justify, his images, and to con- ceal language's arbitrariness, so as to alleviate the anxiety a truly uncontained metaphorical play can generate. The conventional logic of poetic similes and metaphors is thus "opposee aux yeux des lecteurs comme de veritables ecrans, pour leur masquer ce mou- vement fondamental du langage. Aussi, pendant longtemps, ne s'est-on guere querelle sur le sens, mais sur le gout, c'est-a-dire entre autres choses sur l'art de voiler, en la justifiant, la liberte metaphorique" [213]. In this schematic history of poetry's figura- tive practice, Mannoni sees a major step toward "la promotion decisive de la metaphore poetique" in Baudelaire's "Correspon- dances," although he feels that the latter poet was still too inclined to rationalize his vision and explain away the play and power of words. "Baudelaire le premier commence a devoiler le secret de la metaphore. II ne le devoile qu'a moitie, il lui faut encore une jus- tification, et il la cherche encore du cote de la realite et non du langage" [213]. Things, or nature, however, spoke to man in Baudelaire's poem, and that was enough, according to Mannoni, to justify Baudelaire's own exceeding of earlier limitations imposed upon poetic freedom by prosodic and rhetorical codes. The moment of confrontation with a generic tradition can be seen to correspond loosely to the node in time at which Barthes situated the beginning of French literature's reflexive period. What the so-called Symbolist generation of writers such as Baudelaire, Verlaine, Rimbaud and Mallarme seem to have brought about then, each to a certain degree, is an increasing demystification of a mystery-not that of the universe, however, but that of the figu- rative devices and processes literature traditionally mobilizes to manage uncertainties and anxieties surrounding the human con- dition. As far as Rimbaud's own aesthetic evolution is concerned, Octave Mannoni even felt that the writing of the sonnet "Voyelles" brought him closer to rejecting lyrical conventions, and eventually to renounce the deceitful art of poetry altogether. II est eclairant, pour expliquer la suite de l'oeuvre de Rimbaud, et meme pour rendre compte de son precoce silence, de supposer que ce a quoi le poete devait arriver, c'est au devoilement radical de la metaphore</page><page sequence="21">794 VICTOR ABOULAFFIA poetique et a la decouverte de sa parente avec le vertige et le nonsens. On pourrait dire qu'avec le sonnet des "Voyelles," il commence deja a renoncer a 1'art poetique, qui n'est pas l'art de s'abandonner aujeu de la metaphore et de decouvrir que tout peut se dire de tout, mais celui de le cacher, de fournir assez de justifications, d'aiguiller le lecteur sur autre chose. (215-16) But is poetry destined to be an art of illusions? Poetic forms never stop changing historically; and Rimbaud was among those who criticized illusionist aesthetics so as to transform poetic discourse as well as its environment. By uncovering "le c6te obscur de l'experi- ence de la parole, le fait qu'une chose doit toujours etre dite autre chose" [214], poems such as "Correspondances" and "Voyelles," which have steadfastly refrained from providing stable grounds to a recuperative idealist reading, have also brought some readers one step closer to freedom from the shackles of symbolic orders. Finally, for those readers still wishing that the sonnet will even- tually yield more than the insistent display of metaphors and their operative intralingual milieu, it should be sufficient to note that Rimbaud used the future tense when he wrote in the poem's sec- ond line what he was about to do ("je dirai quelque jour le se- cret .. ."). The poet thus stated that there was no secret to be found in this poem, as he vaguely promises and indefinitely ("quelque") defers the moment of revelation to some other time. In other words, the present text does not actually make any metaphysical claims it does not fulfill. And two years later, during the summer of 1873, Rimbaud himself will actually have been the first reader to ironize on the predictable metaphysical response to this text. The urbanized, proletarianized, disenchanted narrator ("je croyais a tous les enchantements") of "Alchimie du verbe," in the second "Delires" section of Une Saison en enfer, went on denouncing the Romantic delusions of the Poete-Voyant, as he cynically reap- praised the performance of his past poetic self. J'inventai la couleur des voyelles!-A noir, E blanc, I rouge, O bleu, U vert-Je reglai la forme et le mouvement de chaque con- sonne, et, avec des rhythmes instinctifs, je me flattai d'inventer un verbe poetique accessible, un jour ou l'autre, a tous les sens.
