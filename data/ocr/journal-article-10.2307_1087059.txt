<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ATHENIAN AGORA: RESULTS OF EXCAVATIONS CONDUCTED BY THE AMERICAN SCHOOL OF CLASSICAL STUDIES AT ATHENS. VOLUME XI: ARCHAIC AND ARCHAISTIC SCULPTURE. By EVELYN B. HARRISON. Princeton: American School of Classical Studies at Athens. 1965. Pp. xix, 192, 68 plates. ($18.25) MY FIRST DUTY as a reviewer must be to disabuse the reader of the notion that this book is a catalogue. With this volume, her second contribution to the Agora series, Professor Harrison gives us a treatise on sculpture which is bound to become "required reading" in the field. The 178 items under discussion (43 archaic and 26 archaistic fragments, 22 Hekataia and 87 herms) form a motley collection: some are out- standing, but the majority are poor-in preservation if not always in quality-and some even problematic in their interpretation. Yet the very nature of the finds has proved to be an asset rather than a handicap for the accurate, painstaking and penetrating analysis of the author. She has risen above the single fragments to a general view of periods, styles, and types; for each section her opinions are summarized in lucid intro- ductory essays, packed with information and always convincing or at least thoroughly plausible. Indeed, common sense is the most striking charac- teristic of the book: sound, scholarly common sense based on an unusual competence in the field of sculpture and a detailed knowledge of literary and epigraphical evidence. These factors enable Miss Harrison quietly to lower the entire traditional chronology of archaic sculpture, to dismiss PHOENIX, Vol. 20 (1966) 4.</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 341 the fine distinctions implicit in the terminology of archaistic art (she therefore uses "archaizing" as the verbal equivalent of "archaistic"), and to reach important conclusions on not only the dating, but even the possible origin and meaning, of several well-known and controversial monuments. Archaic and archaistic items are grouped in one volume because of obvious affinities in style, if not in time; some difficult pieces may actually belong to either category. Hekataia and herms are included with archaistic sculpture, although treated separately. The former are given a more succinct commentary because of the recent study by Kraus; none- theless Miss Harrison manages to revise his groupings and lower his chronology substantially for the most important items. The Hekataion in the British School in Athens and the large Agora Hekataion (no. 134) are thus dated to our era. The treatment of herms is extensive, subdivided under such headings as "The Herm of Andokides and Tribal Herms," "Herms dedicated by Individuals," "Ephebes, the Gymnasium and the Origin of Portrait Herms." The section dealing with the Hermes Propylaios of the Akropolis stresses that it is not at all certain that the Hermes seen by Pausanias was the work of Alkamenes, since "Propylaios" was used as epithet for any divine guardian of gates and doors. Among "Herms as Supports in Sculpture," the herm with mantle and child (no. 210) which had been hailed by Rizzo as a copy of Kephisodotos' Hermes and Dionysos, is realistically interpreted as an adaptation, rather than prototype, of the famous Praxitelean group. In addition to the twelve sections which Miss Harrison has written I should have liked a thirteenth, concerning the possible use of herms as funerary monuments. The difficult passage of Cicero on the post-Solonian anti-sumptuary law has not yet been satisfactorily explained, especially with reference to the enigmatic hermas quos vocant (Leg. 2.26.65). Some of the Agora herms may conceivably have originated in the Kerameikos, as did some other Agora material, and therefore have possible funerary connotations. The most important essays deal with archaic and archaistic sculpture. The latter contains an exhaustive analysis of dress types as potential clues to identification and chronology. The archaistic Athena on a red- figure oinochoe from the Agora dated ca. 410 B.C. suggests that archaizing trends originated in that period, which was stylistically inclined toward linear patterns in drapery. Some korai in Athens are demoted from archaic to archaistic; the Akropolis Four-Gods base comes down from the fourth century B.C. into the Augustan period, and is preceded (not followed) in the second century B.c. by the Agora tripod base (no. 128); an Athenian prototype is claimed for several well-known statuary types, especially the so-called Herculaneum Pallas, of which the Agora material includes a possibly original fragment (no. 124).</page><page sequence="3">342 PHOENIX In the archaic section, Miss Richter's divisions of kouroi are rearranged: the Sounion group is shifted down into the early sixth century and the Orchomenos-Thera youths are recognized as backward contemporaries of the Tenea-Volomandra statues. Among the female figures, the Peplos kore is dated in the early 520's; thus the entire Akropolis series is lowered in time and, from Akr. 674 downward, placed after 500 B.c. The Brother- and-Sister stele is dissociated from the Alkmeonidai and their historical dates, and can therefore be assigned to the middle or the late 530's. Also the Athenian Treasury, freed from Marathonian or Kleisthenic con- nections, reasonably falls in the 490's, at a time of great Athenian prosperity and building activity. These suggestions are so sensible and so intelligently presented that one fails to realize immediately their revolutionary impact. For the first time since Miss Richter's fundamental works on Greek archaic art, we are presented with an alternative chronology sufficiently documented and explicit enough to deserve serious con- sideration, if not unconditional agreement. After such thought-provoking introductory chapters one would imagine the catalogue proper to be somewhat dull reading, yet even it repays close scrutiny. Miss Harrison has a gift for lucid descriptions and terse, vivid English. Her prose clearly reflects both the meticulous care expended on her manuscript, and her extreme familiarity with her material. Even the "initiate" is amazed at her ability to read and interpret the tool marks and to reconstruct the processes of re-cutting and repair which they imply. Discussion of single items still allows digression into more general topics; for example, the excursus on Attic lions under no. 91, or the comments prompted by no. 86, on the representation of Herakles and the lion, and the influence pedimental composition may have had on vase painting. This fragment is of such amorphous preservation as to be almost unintelligible, were it not for the drawing on pl. 17. Indeed one would wish for many more such drawings, since not even Alison Frantz's photographs can illuminate the most ambiguous fragments, and not enough views of some pieces are available. Yet a more lavish photographic commentary might have been economically unjustifiable because of the mediocre nature of the finds. One is indeed grateful for the six plates of comparative material included at the end. Miss Harrison is quite objective about the "no more than statistical value" of some of her fragments, but she believes in their over-all interest because they are "all undoubtedly genuine and all from Athens." If any criticism can indeed be levelled at the book, it might be to doubt that every item from the Agora must by necessity have "an Attic shape" (p.v): some korai which rolled down into the market place from the Akropolis may possibly have been sculptured by foreigners, and some stelai from the Kerameikos have been erected by and for non-Athenians.</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 343 This is perhaps especially true for the so-called "dog-stelai," a type which, at the present state of our knowledge, seems much more at home in Asia Minor than in Attica. No. 105, which preserves the dog's muzzle, is of island marble and was perhaps of the less common wide format; the earlier no. 104, of Attic marble and more probably Attic, shows a pre- sumed tail that is far too thick in comparison with those of other sculptured dogs. The interpretation as a hockey stick, rejected because the deceased wears sandals "unsuitable for vigorous exercise," might perhaps be re-proposed after the recent discovery of Eupheros' stele (ca. 430 B.c.), where the youth is identified as an athlete because of his strigil, but appears shod and clothed in a mantle (7HS Archaeological Reports 1964-65 p. 5 and fig. 3). Among the outstanding pieces or those of unusual importance not previously mentioned, I would cite the fragments attributed to the Dipylon kouros (no. 65); the large poros lion's head from the pediment of some sizable building (no. 94), similar to the poros sculpture from the Hekatompedon; the decree relief (no. 133) dated 321/0 B.C., with the remains of an archaistic female figure and a huge dolphin (!); an early herm that might have been damaged by the hermoclasts of 415 B.C. (no. 156); and an unprecedented double herm, partly archaistic and partly anthropomorphic (no. 205). It seldom happens that a reviewer can be so full of praise about a book for review. It is with great expectation that we now look forward to Miss Harrison's forthcoming volumes in the series, on the classical and later sculpture from the Agora.
