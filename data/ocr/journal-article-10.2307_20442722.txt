The controversy centered on a sculpture by the Franco-Lithuanian artist Jacques Lipchitz. Lipchitz had been commissioned to produce a monumental piece, Prometheus Strangling the Vulture, for the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques de la Vie Moderne. However, as the time to exhibit the statue approached, word spread that Lipchitz's handling of the theme was unconventional and inappropriate. The organizers, fearing a hostile reaction on the part of the public, decided at the last minute to remove the statue from its central position in the Grand Palais where it was to be housed and to place it outside the building.1 But the popular press was not satisfied with this gesture and launched a concerted attack on both the artist and his work. The first salvo was fired by Le Figaro. The newspaper printed a photograph of the sculpture, accompanied by the headline, "What is this monu ment?" and a caption that read "What does it represent?"2 Writing in the Mercure de France, Bernard Champigneulle opined that the statue's "coarseness revolts passers-by" and expressed regret that "we presented to visitors of the Exposition an example so poorly aligned with contemporary French sculpture and its tradi tions."3 But the worst was yet to come. At the end of 1938 the daily Le Matin began to wage a war against the statue that included scurrilous attacks on the sculptor himself. Every day for a week an article with photographs appeared on the first page of the newspaper. One writer quipped that the piece had been placed near the Grand Palais in order to "demonstrate by contrast classical French taste and what will become of it under the influence of the Bolsheviks."4 Other pieces insulted "the Jew Lipchitz," charged him with political radicalism, sedition, and called for the removal of his statue. Sadly, the art world took up the calls of the journalistic Right and launched its own campaign. Conservatives made the rounds of the s Sprlnq 2006, pp. 96~120. d0. 2006 Grey Rvoom, ln rn Ma~h&amp;A~no. oq 9</page><page sequence="3">ateliers and academies soliciting signatures from students and artists calling for the removal of the work. Looking at photographs of the statue today, one has difficulty understanding what all the controversy was about. Granted, the piece resists the kind of nostalgic classicism preferred by the conservative elites of the capital in favor of a vaguely primitivist aesthetic composed of undulating, bulbous forms. But the result is hardly illegible, as the headlines in Le Figaro would lead one to believe. Indeed, compared to the spatial fragmentation and distortion that cubists and futurists had been producing in the capital for some thirty years, Prometheus Strangling the Vulture seems a model of transparency and clarity. Why then did it provoke such hostile and passionate responses? In order to answer this question I am going to examine the statue against the backdrop of debates on national identity that flared in France just prior to the International Exposition. While presented as a forum for international cooperation and reconciliation during the tense 1930s, both con temporary observers and current historians have seen the Exposition Internationale as precisely the opposite: a site of intense ideological conflict and a "'contested [terrain]' for the articulation of collective national identities."5 While states attempted to assert the superiority of their political and social systems by mount ing elaborate displays of their economic and cultural achievements, the most fun damental propaganda battles were fought in a medium much more visceral and direct: the architecture and decorations of the national pavilions themselves. These pavilions were presented not merely as reflections of national character but as living, breathing national characters. Personifications of the nation, these characters were to function as exemplary national subjects, model citizens bearing the traces of an idealized national identity. The centrality and importance of this state fetishism, however, put France in an extremely awkward and problematical position. While the dictatorships could eas ily present totalizing images of identity, France, increasingly ethnically diverse and profoundly divided over the meaning and mandate of the Third Republic, could not. The exhibition organizers attempted to neutralize this ethnic and social fragmentation aesthetically by using the material culture of the Exposition Internationale to present a single, coherent vision of French identity. Relying on stereotypes of unity, coherence, and wholeness, the exposition organizers con structed a "classical" France infinitely able to absorb foreign elements and trans form them into the immutable stuff of latinite. With his radical rereading of the Prometheus myth, Lipchitz's statue must have seemed like a direct challenge to this strategy. Fusing Latin clarity with an Oceanian primitivism, the sculptor 98 Grey Room 23</page><page sequence="4">rejected the fantasy of French purity in favor of a vision of national identity as metissage, a rearticulation that cultural conservatives could perceive only as a dangerous and debilitating miscegenation. From Commodity Fetishism to State Fetishism On May 24 the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques de la Vie Moderne officially opened, and Paris prepared to play host to the world, not merely in the conventional sense of welcoming foreign visitors onto French soil but by unveil ing a miniature version of the world itself in the heart of the French capital. The fair offered the interested spectator a global survey of contemporary human accom plishment: pavilions dedicated to every conceivable French trade and industry; the national pavilions of forty-two sovereign nations and empires; a string of exotic structures housing the natural and cultural riches of various colonies; and palaces of art, science, and ethnography. All were contained in the area stretching from the Trocadero Hill on the Right Bank across the Seine to the base of the Eiffel Tower. For the dedicated flaneur willing to spend some money and expend a little energy, the world was at his feet. A 1937 exposition was first proposed in 1929 by Julien Durand, a Radical politi cian from the Doubs region. In Durand's original conception, however, this fair was to be essentially aesthetic in nature: an exhibition of the decorative arts based on the 1925 Exposition des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels. But with the Wall Street crash and the ensuing global depression, the focus of the exposition shifted to address the challenges to the international economic and social order. By 1933, the government under the Radical Edouard Daladier announced its intention to host a fair centered on the themes of industrial and decorative arts, workers' and peasants' lives, and intellectual cooperation. By the following year, however, the economic crisis that had prompted the shift in the character of the exhibition had led to its outright cancelation. In a time of depression and financial austerity, neither the central government nor the city of Paris felt they could justify such an expensive endeavor. But the fate of the exposition would soon be reversed. Under pressure from both the business and artistic communities, the newly appointed conserva tive Gaston Doumergue resuscitated the fair and attempted to use it as a financial instrument to kick-start the moribund economy of France. According to Edmond Labbe, a retired high civil servant appointed by Doumergue as the commissioner general of the exposition, the fair would "stimulate French production, provide the best forum for serious publicity, pull inactive capital out of its torpor, help in the expansion of domestic trade, and perhaps even in an intensification of Juny The F,ce not he Nehon: state Fehshsm and Metissage at the Exoselton nternahonae, Pars 1937 99</page><page sequence="5">international exchange," all of which would contribute to "reviving the economic vitality of France."6 This conception of the Exposition Internationale, however, was complicated by the increasing tension of international affairs. With the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, Franco's assaults on the Spanish Republic, and German rearmament, Europe seemed on the brink of war. The promotion of peace, therefore, became a sub sidiary cause of the exposition. Most often this was linked to the promotion of trade in the hope that a disruption of commerce could be avoided by the sublima tion of international hostilities into peaceful economic competition. This inter weaving of pacifism and capitalism was boiled down to an aphorism by Robert Lange, the author of a contemporary monograph on the exposition: The Exposition of 1937 will mark a place in history because of its universal ity which must serve peace, because of the quality of its effort to overcome the economic crisis.... Today's assembly takes place at the hour of economic crisis and international tension: Against hate, for Peace! Against poverty, for Prosperity!7 But the loftier aims of the exposition organizers were soon shaken by the real ization that some of the international participants would be using the fair for less-than-idealistic purposes. French officials and fair organizers became aware of the fact that many foreign nations were tuning up their propaganda machines and that France needed to compete or risk being trumped at home. The rapporteur of the Chamber of Deputies' finance commission insisted that France needed to devote intellectual and financial capital to the cause of self-promotion, "if we want France, through its own propaganda, to be capable of responding to the propaganda efforts that other nations will certainly make in connection with the exposition."8 National identity and propaganda had increasingly been the focus of the fairs as they developed through the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The earlier fairs had a largely commercial function. They provided a forum for the display and comparison of consumer goods and industrial products that were classified by cat egory and nation of origin and exhibited in large international halls. For Walter Benjamin, the quasi-mystical reverence with which these goods were displayed transcended the utilitarian mandate of the fairs. These were not mere trade shows but "places of pilgrimage to the commodity fetish,"9 devoted to establishing the "mystical character of commodities."10 With the growth of nationalist movements in Europe and the widespread attempt to "invent" national traditions, the expositions 1 00 tt&gt; SS ' -</page><page sequence="6">saw the increased popularity of discrete national pavilions, which began to dis place the more fluid, cosmopolitan exhibition spaces by the early 1900s. According to historians such as Shanny Peer and Eric Hobsbawm, by 1937 this transformation was complete: the expositions had shifted from displays of commercial wares to the display and propagandizing of separate nations as collective entities. The Exposition Internationale had become the ideal forum for the projection of a representation of the nation to the rest of the world. This change is succinctly sum marized by a contemporary observer of the 193 7 exposition: In 1900, foreign delegations had merely provided space and cover to the motley crowd of national exhibitors. This time, for the most part, they exposed not products, but nations.... In 1937 objects were not included for their own sake, but as parts of a synthetic whole encompassing the economic, social, and political activities of a people. Commercial publicity disappeared and was replaced by national propaganda.1" One of the key sites for the articulation and propagandizing of this national identity was the architecture of the national pavilions themselves. The pavilions functioned not merely as containers for the national (and nationalist) content within but as symbolic stand-ins for the nations they represented. In various debates and discussions during the Exposition Internationale, the pavilions were routinely anthropomorphized, discursively transformed into avatars of the nation. We can see this rhetorical tendency in both general comments about architecture and specific descriptions of buildings. In his piece on "Architecture at the Exposition of 1937," Edmond Labbe notes that "the face of France was ... fashioned by French architecture that imprinted a design and a physiognomy on her."12 This trope of the face was also used by Emile Condoyer in his article for Larousse, "Faces of the Nations at the Exposition," where he states that "every palais is a face where [the national soul] is reflected." 13 In some of the descriptions of specific buildings the anthropomorphism becomes much more active and we actually see the pavilions come to life. In his discussion of the new Trocadero the writer for Le Journal describes the building's "surfaces with the pink pallor of young flesh" and leaves us with a final image of the new structure's two wings, "its grandiose arms open in an ample gesture of welcome."'14 If the newly animated Trocadero struck the writer for Le Journal as a gentle, welcoming creature, childlike with its pink fleshy exterior, other buildings were more sinister and threatening once brought to life. These were qualities that Albert Speer noticed in his own work. "My architecture represented an intimidating display of power," he wrote; }~~ ~~~~ ml. t tt v 3 tOn&gt;S^ 'e0e.t';.Wt.lb}d t 05@&lt;-2 ......... 8 o]e X p } l t |to a % ti s a io .).</page><page sequence="7">"my buildings were heavy and menacing, constructed, so to speak, with too much muscle on them."15 The opposite of the innocent, welcoming child, Speer's muscle bound warrior presented a frightening spectacle of martial vigor. This shift from commodities to national identity should be seen, however, not as a radical rupture but as a further displacement of the religious energies involved in fetishism. The anthropomorphism of the pavilions is perhaps the most obvious and literal manifestation of what Michael Taussig has called "state fetishism," the tendency to "casually identify 'the State' as a being unto itself, animated with a will and mind of its own."'16 Building on Marx's notion of commodity fetishism, Taussig has pointed to the essentially phantasmatic nature of this vision of the state and its tendency to subjectify the objective while it objectifies the subjective. Taussig approvingly quotes anthropologist A.R. Radcliffe-Brown, who notes that "the State in this sense [as an "entity over and above the human individuals who make up a society"] does not exist in the phenomenal world; it is a fiction of the philoso phers."'17 For Radcliffe-Brown what does exist is "an organization, i.e., a collection of individual human beings connected to a complex set of relations ... there is no such thing as the power of the State; there are only, in reality, powers of individu als-kings, prime ministers, magistrates, policemen, party bosses and voters."''18 While Taussig agrees with the proposition that the state is an unreal entity, he diverges from Radcliffe-Brown in his insistence that the unreal can have very real effects. "For what the notion of State fetishism directs us to," he writes, "is the existence and reality of the political power of this fiction, its powerful insubstan tiality."19 This is exactly what we find at the Exposition Internationale: although they are fantastical creatures, fictional characters, the national palais do the very real work of creating a national identity. The French Palais de Chaillot presents an exceptional example of this state fetishism and its role in identity formation, not because of its success but because of its dismal failure. Profoundly divided as a nation, the French could not agree on a story to tell about themselves, and this lack of consensus resulted in a pavilion that was itself profoundly split. Although puta tively embodying the progressive values of the Popular Front, the building in fact presents a palimpsest of conflicting agendas and ideologies. Instead of countering the propaganda efforts of the dictatorships with a coherent image of France, the Trocadero showed the Republic in the midst of an identity crisis. A Call to Order The planning and preparation of the Exposition Internationale took place not only in an atmosphere of international tension but in an environment of extreme division 102 Grey Room 23</page><page sequence="8">and conflict within France itself. Economic depression led to political destabilization and a fraying of the social consensus. Unable to control the economic situation, between 1932 and 1934 five cabinets lasted less than twelve weeks each, leading to a crisis of confidence in the parliamentary system and the increased popularity of the brutal street politics of right-wing groups such as the Croix de feu and the Jeunesses patriotes. The fear that fascism was taking hold in France led the Socialists, Communists, and centrist Radicals to form a united leftist front in 1935 and orga nize their own demonstrations in opposition to those of the Right. One scholar has counted "1063 riotous assemblies, processions, or demonstrations" between February 1934 and May 1936, a situation that historian Shanny Peer dubbed "moral and psychological civil war."20 But the crisis over French identity went much deeper than political or economic instability and touched such key issues as ethnic diversity and the meaning of Frenchness. At the beginning of the century the nation experienced a "demo graphic crisis" that stirred up long-standing French anxieties over degeneration and emasculation. This crisis was managed by recruiting foreign laborers to work in industry and agriculture. By the First World War some 300,000 foreigners worked in France, the majority of them nonwhite workers from North Africa, Indochina, China, and Madagascar.21 Anxious about the impact of this large, visible popula tion of immigrants, the government deported many of them after the war, prefer ring to recruit white laborers from Italy, Spain, and Poland, nations whose blood was deemed more "compatible" with the "transfusion" needed by an "anemic" France.22 Some did stay, however, and by 1926 some 1,500 black African workers resided in Paris. These numbers were supplemented by soldiers from France's African and Caribbean colonies who fought for France in the First World War and remained in the capital after the armistice. A portion of the population responded positively to these immigrants: the heightened visibility of Africans in the streets of Paris and the active expatriate African-American jazz and literary communities helped fuel a mania for "negritude" among Parisian intellectuals.23 Others, how ever, were not so tolerant and worried about the effects that this population would have on the purity of French blood and French identity. Predictably, these anxieties took sexualized forms. Eugene Apert, founding member of the French Eugenics Society, invoked the image of a rising tide of miscegenation when he noted that Algerian, Moroccan, and Senegalese soldiers had "sown little half-breeds" throughout the French countryside.24 With the economic crisis of the 1930s, these racist attitudes became more widespread and virulent: visible minorities were easy scapegoats for the perceived collapse of French society. u nyk T he Face of t.

He expressed hope that the fair would give French citizens "the feeling of national cohesion" and make them "more greatly aware of their profound unity and strength."25 But the nature of the nation-whether it was a "pure," homoge nous society or a diverse, cosmopolitan one-remained unresolved. The Popular Front was itself ambiguous on the matter. On the one hand, the government spoke about the exposition in the best universalizing rhetoric of republicanism. But on the other hand, it sanctioned buildings that sent a radically different message. Edmond Labbe spoke about the exposition in messianic terms: not merely as a mechanism for economic revitalization, an opportunity to work for pacifism or an affirmation of national identity, but as a revival of humanism and a crucible for the formation of new subjectivities. Relying on a familiar trope, Labbe noted that " [i]n 1937 we are celebrating the memory of Rene Descartes; it was in 1637 that the immortal Discourse on Method was published in Leyden. Our Exposition must be Cartesian."26 For the commissioner the Exposition Internationale had to embody the principles of rationality, stability, and coherence associated with Descartes. Labbe then made clear his reasons for framing the exposition in this particular way. We must present to the public a sort of panorama of modern techniques, including the most simple and most complex material techniques, including what contemporary pedagogues audaciously call "cultural" techniques, [operations formative of] the body and mind which will assure the France of tomorrow an industrious youth more skillful, more competent, more sure of itself and its destiny than the generations tried by the war and the [economic] crisis.27 Labbe calls for an exposition that will shape a younger generation of Frenchmen and help them shake off the deleterious effects of a modernity in crisis. The expo sition will help make them into coherent, integrated individuals, well-balanced Cartesian selves. The fair "will be a manifestation of contemporary humanism, a humanism that exalts all the powers of man, because it has discovered that all of these powers are, in reality, inseparable, and it will thus make its contribution to the work for peace and contribute to the progress of humanity."28 The exposition, then, would do its part for the formation of a new national sub ject imbued with the progressive, humanistic, republican values of the Popular Front. This pedagogical function of the Exposition Internationale was further underscored by the comments of the minister of agriculture for the Popular Front 1 0 4 e-e - ., S</page><page sequence="10">who argued that world's fairs no longer functioned primarily to create a new clientele for products but had become "centers of attraction and education for the masses."29 But if the discourse about the exposition in general was carried on in good humanistic and universalizing terms, the debates about architecture, and the archi tecture itself, seemed to veer off in a different direction. The exhibition organizers saw architecture as a privileged tool for the regeneration of an embattled French identity. For Labbe6, the success of the exposition would depend "to a large degree on its architectural conception and the quality of its execution," not only because architecture surrounds the spectators, giving them shelter and attractive vistas, but because "it materially expresses the conception of the whole."130 Architecture, then, would not only give physical form to the abstract ideas that constituted and defined the exposition but would function as a material synecdoche for the regen erated wholeness of self and society that the government was working toward. In order to express these values, the fair organizers called on architects to work within certain parameters, to develop a particular style that suited the abstract ideas they wished to embody. The official architectural formula of the exposition was: ''harmony of the most revolutionary modernism with the most profound respect for the formidable patrimony of traditions."131 The buildings of the Exposition InternatILionale were to be traditional and yet audacious in their reinterpretation and renovation of the most venerable styles. This reconciliation of contemporaneity and tradition would moderate both the excesses of various modernist styles and the sterile fantasy of historical "pastiche," resulting in a kind of Aufhebung, a higher form of reason and order, associated by Labbe6 with "le g6niefran9ais. "' Both orga nizers and architects saw this ideal architecture embodying reason, order, tradi tion, and national identity as a call for the return to an idiom of classicism. Problematically, however, other states also associated themselves with classi cism-most notably Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. According to the Album offi ciel, the Italian pavilion was "conceived in a manner both classical and modern," an evaluation seconded by Labbe6, in whose opinion it joined ("always harmo niously") the "great Roman tradition" and the "geometries of modernism."3 Not wanting to be outdone, the Germans insisted on their own classical pedigree. Their pavilion guidebook, written by prominent Nazi art critics and officials, denied that German classicism was "mere slavish copying" and instead insisted that the sim ilarities sprang from a worldview shared with the ancients: "The reason for the fundamental harmony of our buildings with those of the Ancient World is a similar attitude toward building as such."3 Analyzing the sculpture of the Third Reich, Christian Zervos, editor of the journal Cahiers d'art, noted that "the influence of</page><page sequence="11">antique statuary is visible throughout," and his article quotes one artist who states that "we believe in the encounter between German genius and Greek genius."35 There seemed to be Hellenes everywhere you turned. But the coherence of classicism as an image of humanistic, republican France was not only challenged by the association of this style with Europe's totalitarian regimes, it was compromised by the authoritarian and racist legacy of this move ment in twentieth-century France itself. Critics such as Kenneth Silver have traced the twentieth-century revival of classicism to the xenophobia and cultural chau vinism propounded by the French Right during the First World War. At that time, the iconography of classicism began to appear in war propaganda, and a variety of specious genealogies were proffered "proving" that the French were the heirs of antique, Latin reason while the Germans were the modern avatars of a supersti tious and autocratic medieval mysticism.36 If, however, twentieth-century classicism has its origins in wartime and the binary opposition of French and Germanic iden tities, by the 1930s it had taken on other meanings and was being used to confront different social and political realities. This is clear in a work like Profits et pertes de ]'art contemporain, by Waldemar George, a prominent and powerful art critic who had been appointed an inspector attached to the department of works of art at the Paris International Exposition of 1937 where he oversaw the production of decorative murals for the World's Fair.37 George's project is framed as a critique of the decadence of post-Davidean painting. The author begins by constructing a genealogy of modern classicism against which he opposes the debacle and betrayal of contemporary art. George deals with a number of European painters-David, Ingres, Delacroix, Corot, Renoir, Degas-whom he sees participating in and further developing a specifically "Latin" tradition. All of the artists are described in broad, classicizing terms: Delacroix is the painter who orders chaos, who returns to "Romanite," whose orientalism evokes "classical antiquity" and a "Latin rhetoric"; Corot is seen as a "Classique" who participates in the "ancient tradition of Roman res gestae"; Renoir "Latinizes the impressionist style ... like a painter of the clas sical tradition" (PP, 22-27). What unites all of these figures is a particular visuality. All of these artists have particularly sharp, particularly acute vision. David, for example, is described as having "the eye of a lynx" (PP, 22). But, this is not vision that merely registers physical surfaces; rather it is a seeing that goes "a fond": to the essence, ground, foundation. And in fact George attacks the idea of optical truth as the sole truth of painting. For George vision is merely the (necessary) road to a higher mental truth, a fundamental truth of ideas. Art that neglects to take this final, crucial step to the world of ideas violates its essential spiritual mission: "art 106 (3rey Room 23</page><page sequence="12">that is a representation of the visible universe and nothing else has ceased to be an expression of the spirit [esprit]" (PP, 18). For George, this deep, penetrating vision reveals a number of truths about humanity and the universe that he refers to as "humanism": namely, the order and intelligence of "harmonious man"; the coher ence of space; and the accord between man and the universe, the microcosm and macrocosm. For George, however, these fundamental metaphysical and aesthetic truths have, for the most part, been forsaken by contemporary European culture. Instead of cel ebrating "harmonious man," the ideal of Western civilization, European artists have instead been seduced by visions of a pantheistic primitive man. For George, this turn to primitivism has its roots in the social crisis caused by modernity and especially the insidious effects of capitalism. He sees primitivism as a flight from the ubiquitous rationalization and reification of the twentieth century. However, for George the rebellion is ultimately impotent because in rejecting the evils of rationalization it settles on something even worse. Primitivism throws out the baby with the bathwater. In opposing capitalism, it jettisons thinking and reason as well and for that reason "cannot liberate modern man" (PP, 56). However, more than simply the antirationalism of "primitivism" offends George, and it is here that the racist component of his thinking is glaringly obvious. What bothers him is the rejection of Western civilization and the embrace of non-European cultures that the move toward primitivism entails. For George the proper opposite of "industrial order" is "Greek and Roman order," not the disorder of Asia or Africa. The impressionist fascination with Japanese art or the modernist obsession with African art connote for him "a hate of Periclean Athens, the Renaissance, and the French Grand Siecle" (PP, 89). For George, the art of Asia and Africa is not only different from the art of the West, but its very antithesis; or, as he puts it, "the negation of Occidental order" (PP, 84). This negation is presented in a series of binary oppositions: where Western art is rational, "primitive" art with its animism and occult forces is irrational; where Western art celebrates human free dom, "primitive" art abdicates this freedom and places humanity in a static world of supernatural forces beyond human control; where Western art cultivates an ideal of beauty and perfection, "primitive" art wallows in ugliness and the grotesque; and where Western art insists on cultivation, control, and self-restraint, "primitive" art abandons itself to a debauch of instinctual satisfaction. If George's negative valuation of non-Western cultures was not clear enough, he applies the coup de grace of an unambiguous trope: Western culture's fascination with Asia and Africa is "a Faustian union, a damnation. Man sells his soul to the devil" (PP, 84). Junyk The Face of the Naho0n. State FetishSm and Mdtissage at the Expos~tton Teternado0nale, Paris 1937 107</page><page sequence="13">The Trocadero The authoritarian and racist nature of this interwar French classicism was clearly evident in the debates over the most important French building at the exposition the newly rebuilt Palais de Chaillot. Standing on the Trocad6ro Hill on the Right Bank overlooking the Champs de Mars, the Palais functioned as the Entree d'hon neur to the Expo and offered spectators a striking view of the entire fair and the French capital beyond. This spot was not unused to grandeur, having served as an important architectural landmark for over a century. The proposed site of Napoleon's Palace of the King of Rome, the "Trocad6ro Villa" celebrating the taking of the Andalusian fort of the Trocad6ro in 1823, and a triumphal monument to Napoleon I, the hill loomed large in the Parisian architectural imaginary before any monu mental building had actually been erected.38 In 1876, after Haussmann's renova tions had turned the area into a series of gardens, a palace was constructed there for the 1878 World's Fair. A certain segment of opinion had never thought much of this palace. In 1878 a writer for the Revue de France opined that this "Assyrian or Moorish or Byzantine" monument "resembles, with its two minarets, the immense bonnet of an ass, with its two big ears." 3(' However, in the early 1930s, when it was decided that the Exposition Internationale would take place along the Montparnasse-Chaillot axis, the level of vitriol unleashed against the Old Trocad6ro reached unprecedented new heights. Many commentators reproached the building for "having deprived walkers crossing the summit of the hill of a magnificent viewpoint."4" With this large structure dominating the Trocadero hill, the panorama of Paris was almost completely eclipsed. But the vast majority of criticism was directed against the old building's exotic, "oriental" style. One writer seemed to positively foam at the mouth when he raved against "this Turkish bath establishment," with its "fake Lebanese variegated aspect" similar to an "enormous stone shellfish with atro phied claws." Why wait so long, he wondered, to eliminate these "Moorish abom inations that dishonored the sky of Passy,"41 to remove, as another writer put it, this "mass which was a weight on the chest of Paris?"42 For the old building's critics, the structure had the look of a subaltern mongrel, not the Gallic purity to which they aspired. As the building that would anchor the exposition site and represent 10 Ge,Rom2</page><page sequence="14">France in the eyes of the world, the Old Trocad6ro was clearly unacceptable. Debates over the building's external appearance were mirrored by deliberations over what to do about its interior spaces. From the early years of the century through the 1920s the Trocad6ro housed a highly eccentric ethnographic museum. Like the taxonomic system of Borges's Chinese sage, the "Troca's" categorization and display practices seemed to defy all rational and scientific principles. According to James Clifford, "the Trocad6ro was a jumble of exotica." With its "mislabeled, misclassified objets d'art," its "costumed mannequins, panoplies, dioramas, massed specimens," the museum was a place where "one could go to encounter curiosities, fetishized objects."4 3 The problem with the Troca, however, was not merely its baroque, Wunderkammer nature but the fact that the pieces on display (African, Oceanian, Inuit) were presented not as "artifacts" but as works of art. Instead of situating the works in a cultural context as manifestations of par ticular "primitive" societies, they were presented as discrete aesthetic objects just as the works of the European masters in the Louvre or the European avant-garde in the Mus6e d'Art Moderne. The reception of these works seemed to further underscore the cultural leveling performed by their presentation as aesthetic objects. The Troca became a favorite haunt of the avant-garde, particularly the sur realists and cubists, who studied the works on display and borrowed from them in their own artistic experiments. For conservatives, this cultural metissage repre sented everything that was wrong with contemporary France: the loss of objective order and hierarchy, the encroachment of relativism, the loss of faith in progress and development, the degeneracy of culture makers who would abandon their spir itual patrimony in favor of the primitive fetishes of l'art negre. The debates over the appearance of the Trocad6ro were not merely aesthetic or museological battles but touched on raw and pressing issues of national identity. Indeed, the discourse generated by the Trocad6ro reveals profound anxieties over cosmopolitanism and the problems of m6tissage, or racial mixing, in interwar France. At a time when the very notion of Frenchness was perceived to be under threat, the use of a "Moorish" building to represent France in the eyes of the world, or a museum housing "primitive" works that influenced European artists, would generate tremendous anxieties. In the fantasies of reactionaries and cultural pes simists, both of these facts stood as signs that French identity and cultural author ity were degenerating and that the colonials were ever more rapidly colonizing the nation. After much deliberating and many false starts, a new Trocad6ro was approved: one more stylistically and ideologically consonant with the France of the 1930s. Opposite: Gabriel Davioud.

Paris 1937 109</page><page sequence="15">The new building would include not only a large open terrace from which specta tors could enjoy a magnificent view of the City of Light but a brand new "scientific" museum-the Musee de l'Homme. When the scaffolding came down, revealing the structure designed by architects Louis-Hippolyte Boileau, Jacques Carlu, and Leon Azema, the critics were almost uniformly impressed. Gone now was the riot of Moorish gewgaws, replaced by a building of the purest reason and order. The new Trocadero is perfectly symmetrical, a model of balance and harmony. Looking at it from the Seine side, one can see that the building is organized around a large open space-where the Moorish building once stood, one now finds a terrace that looks out over the Seine, the Eiffel Tower, and the Champs de Mars. Framing this space on either side are two large wings with classical columns, while directly under the terrace is a facade with nine metopes flanked by two monumental stairways that lead to pools, gardens, and fountains. Almost uniformly, commentators saw the new building as a rejection of foreign exoticism and a reaffirmation of classicism and Frenchness. Le Figaro praised the palace's "classical style, capable of aging without going out of fashion."44 Bdtiments et travaux publics noted that the architectural "parti" adopted by the authors is inspired by French tradi tion ... characterized by the predominance of the horizontal. The alignment of the pilasters is reminiscent of old colonnades. The absence of capitals and fluting, the infrequency of sculpted motifs, the simplicity of cornices attest to its modernity. The elegance of the proportions is incontestable.45 Louis Gillet, the academician, claimed that in the new Trocad6ro "all the medioc rities, the little ornamental miseries, have been reabsorbed, erased, replaced by a great, truly French harmony, which offers a complex mixture of urbanity and nobility, of courtesy and austerity."46 The new Trocadero, then, is a profoundly "classical" structure, one that is in line with the grand tradition of French architecture. And yet it is not an anachronism; the building's authors have not slavishly imitated the past but have channeled its spirit into distinctly modern forms. Further, all the 110 Grey Room 23</page><page sequence="16">qualities associated with the building's classicism are also bound up with its Frenchness; the two, in fact, are interpenetrated, inseparable. Only by throwing off foreign influences, specifically degenerate Orientalism, is the Trocadero able to reclaim the balance, harmony, and nobility that is its patrimony. In a series of equivalences, then, French equals classical equals harmonious, balanced, and rational, and this entire equation is contrasted to foreign chaos. Combining these various tropes with the anthropomorphism of the building that we observed pre viously, we can clearly see the allegory of national identity that the pavilion per forms. Like a person who is quintessentially French and classical, endowed with the key attributes of order, proportion, and reason, the Trocadero functions as an idealized French citizen. As an allegory of national identity the building projected an image of France into the international competition of national representations and gave the French spectators a model for their own subjective self-fashioning. The Trocadero also sought to actively fashion French citizens through the medium of visuality, the key modality of classicism as identified by Waldemar George. The second major criticism of the Old Trocadero was its eclipsed view. In the remodeled building this problem was solved by destroying the central Moorish building and replacing it with a large barren terrace that offered a spectacular van tage point for the visual delectation of Paris. This new promontory was mentioned again and again in enthusiastic reviews of the structure. Louis Gillet bragged that "'there is hardly any site that possesses such a commanding view," and Andre Dezarrois, the museum official, noted, "'It is from the new terrace of the new Palais de Trocadero that the eye takes possession of this ephemeral and Babylonian city."'47 Art historian James Herbert sees this site of the gaze as the space of subjectivity-construction. "Looking down on the world embodied in the pavilions of the Champ de Mars," writes Herbert, "the spectator regarded itself as the subject of that object."48 Looking down from the Trocadero hill, the spectator felt himself to be in a position of mastery, a transcendent God-like eye "taking possession" of the world. Imagining himself in this position of mastery, "the spectator imagined itself to be French," saw himself as one with the anthropomorphized structure whose wings, like giant arms, seized the world in a gesture of embrace-or more likely domination.49 The architecture of the pavilion not only created an idealized citizen as a model for French spectators but actually made the spectators into this citizen: put them in a space where they would identify with this citizen's domineering gaze and see themselves as this citizen. The particular type of visual experience offered by the Trocadero should per haps be called panoramic. The panorama was a precinematic visual entertainment Louis-Hippolyte Boileau, Jacques Carlu, and Leon Azema. The Trocadero (Palais de Chaillot), 1937. From Isabel Gournay, The New Trocad6ro (Liege, Belgium: Mardaga, 1985). Junayk The Fac ofhe Na1n Stat F;tshLm and PLtisaqe at th E position Internattonale, CarL 1 37 1 11</page><page sequence="17">invented around 1787 which presented spectators with landscape painting repro ducing a 360-degree view. According to Stephan Oettermann, "the panorama reproduced a new optical experience in pictorial form: the possibility of seeing in a full circle without obstruction, of having a broad overview, seeing beyond the previous limits of the horizon."50 This seems to be the material analogue of the clas sicist visuality that emerges with David and other European painters in the late eighteenth century and finds a late spokesman in Waldemar George.51 The panorama, like classical vision, removes the spectator from the flux and confusion of the life world and places him above the fray, in the position of the godhead, from where one can see a higher order of coherence and rationality. According to Oettermann, "'Panoramic' vision is primarily a way of 'getting a grip' on things, a grip that leaves what is observed undamaged, but surrounds and seizes the whole."52 For the Frenchman looking down from the terrace of the Palais de Chaillot with classicist eyes, the panorama of contemporary Europe did not look chaotic and bewildering but was the model of perfect order, with all dangerous ambiguities and crossings rigidly defined and contained. Looking down from the Trocadero hill, the spectator would see a stable Europe committed to peace and reconciliation; a technologically progressive France producing a variety of desirable commodities; and a happy, docile, and skilled workforce, laboring blissfully in both the colonial and French regional sections of the fair. The ordering of the classicist gaze was also apparent in the new museum (the Musee de l'Homme), where it tidily resolved the ambiguities of subject and object, Frenchman and colonial, that dominated the Old Troca. Like the Exposition Internationale in general, on the face of it the Museum appeared liberal and progressive. Its effect, however, was in many ways racist and exclusionary. James Clifford notes: The Musee de l'Homme's African sculptures were displayed regionally along with other objects, their significance functionally interpreted. They did not find a place beside the Picassos of the Musee d'Art Moderne, located a few streets away. As we have seen, the emerging domains of modern art and eth nology were more distinct in 1937 than a decade before. It is not merely whimsical to question these apparently natural classifications. At issue is the loss of a disruptive and creative play of human categories and differences, an activity that does not simply display and comprehend the diversity of cultural orders but openly expects, allows, indeed desires its own disorientation.53 Where the Troca staged a dialogical encounter between center and periphery, Frenchman and colonial, in which both were, in turn, subjects and objects of 1 12 C re4 oo v rn i</page><page sequence="18">inquiry, in the new Museum these relations were formalized and in the process impoverished. Henceforth the Frenchman would be the observing subject; the colonial, the observed object. And the dialogical exchange that might have ques tioned this entire taxonomic system would be rigorously proscribed. If, however, the Trocade6ro attempted to construct a subject that was purely clas sical and French, with all of its dangerous elements externalized, projected to dis crete sites where they could be contained and domesticated, like the colonials laboring blissfully on the Ile de Cygnes in the middle of the Seine, in practice it was unable to actualize this ideal subjectivity. Critics insisted on the Trocade6ro's unsullied Frenchness and expressed hysterical joy at the banishment of all foreign contaminants. These affirmations of purity, however, are nothing but instances of the most deliberate misrecognition, for the critics knew very well that the Trocade6ro was not "pure." In order to save money, the wings of the original Moorish "mon strosity" were retained and were integrated into the new structure, covered with a classical veneer.4 According to Michel Roux-Siz h rhtcs"eedml ishing without demolishing; they were preserving the worst of the Trocade6ro: the form of its layout with its two rubber arms indefinitely stretched out, its indecisive form and a negligible decorative effect."55 In L'architecture d'aujourd'hui, Andre' Bloc complained that "conserving the shell of the building saves little money and we become slaves to a layout that any self-respecting architect can only condemn."156 In a piece titled "Deux palais pour un," the arts journal Beaux-Arts complained about the use of the old building's wings with their "weak and illogical curves."157 The building was recognized as a hybrid, a mongrel, and not the French purebred its champions claimed it to be. Instead of staying contained "out there," foreign ness was present in the very core of the homogeneous national self. What Is This Monument? Perhaps we can now return to Lipchitz's Prometheus Strangling the Vulture and understand why it provoked such intense feelings of anger and outrage. For a spec tator in 1937 (particularly a conservative spectator) a neoclassical artifact would have called up such highly charged issues as the coherence of national identity, racial purity, and the clarity and rationality of modern subjectivity. Lipchitz's han dling of the Prometheus myth was so outrageous because it not only frustrated traditional expectations of how these values should be represented, it seemed to explicitly reject the values themselves. Instead of the classicism of immutability and transparency valorized by Waldemar George, Lipchitz's piece invoked the fluid ity and ambiguity of the baroque. The art historian Alfred Werner has argued that:</page><page sequence="19">With its absolute minimum of facial and bodily expression, its abstract cloud shapes, the Prometheus is unmistakably of our time. A Bernini would have produced something more explicit, and yet his name comes to mind. Both artists have a theatrical conception, both dematerialize the plastic volume by dissolving the mass in fluid atmosphere, both give animation to their work by exploiting the play of light and shadow (which in the Prometheus, inten sifies the notion of struggle). Both have that dynamic vitality that is alien to the static principle of classic sculpture.58 Lipchitz's Prometheus rejects the verities of George's classicism in favor of a radi cally different conception of personhood: undulating and flowing, he embodies an open subjectivity, a self defined by metamorphosis and change. Further, with his "absolute minimum of facial and bodily expression" he invokes the "primitive" figures of Africa and Oceania, deconstructing the opposition between the European classical self and the debased foreign other.59 Prometheus recapitulates the vision of French identity articulated by the Trocadero: not the official identity champi oned by French conservatives but the uncanny doubled identity that emerged from the building's inability to actualize the values that it putatively embodied. Instead of demonizing the fragmentation and foreignness that emerged on the terrace of the Palais de Chaillot, Lipchitz's Prometheus celebrated it, turning to metissage and hybridity as the key values of a rearticulated Frenchness.60 For conservatives violently resisting these changes, Lipchitz's vision was radi cally threatening. The threat was compounded by the artist's ethnicity-his iden tity as both Jew and Eastern European. In the 1920s, France pursued a policy of increased immigration from Eastern Europe. While initially these immigrants were seen as preferable to the visible racial minorities that had been recruited before the war, this optimism and idealization soon wore off. By the mid-1920s, the reluc tance of Eastern Europeans to assimilate "properly" sparked a revival of the rhetoric of invasion and siege that had been used to describe the German "assaults" on French culture during the war. For example, in 1925 the literary journal Cahier du mois devoted an entire issue to the harmful influence of the East on French cul ture, featuring interviews with prominent authors such as Andre Gide and Paul Valery; the following year Henri Massis published a book titled The Defense of the West.61 Louis Vauxcelles struck the appropriate pitch of hysteria when he raved: A barbarian horde has rushed upon Montparnasse, descending on [the art galleries of] Rue La Boetie from the caf6s of the 14th arrondissement 1 14 Grey Roorn23</page><page sequence="20">[Montparnasse], uttering raucous Germano-Slavic screams of war.... Their culture is so recent! When they speak of Poussin, do they know the master? Have they ever really looked at a Corot? Or read a poem by La Fontaine? These are people from "somewhere else" who ignore and in the bottom of their hearts look down on what Renoir has called the gentleness of the French School-that is, our race's virtue of tact.62 Within this Eastern European horde the Jews were singled out as particularly undesirable immigrants. In the aesthetic sphere this anti-Semitism manifested itself in debates over the "problem" of Jewish painting. Modernist art produced by Jewish painters was denounced as "messy," "frenzied" Romanticism, and Pierre Jaccard's "L'Art grec et le spiritualisme hebreux" argued that the Semitic race was utterly incapable of producing any kind of naturalistic art and found its opposite in the formal idealism of the Greeks.63 By the exposition of 1937 this popular sentiment against Eastern Europeans, Jews, and their hideous modernism had reached its boiling point. French writers of the Right began to express a virulent xenophobia (using rhetoric reminiscent of contemporaneous Nazi assaults on "degenerate art") and sometimes even sympa thy for the racist policies of the totalitarian regimes. Writing in the Revue hebdo madaire, Rene Gillouin asked "What is the School of Paris?" and went on to answer: "A rendezvous of meteques, flocking to Paris from their native Lithuania, Podolsk, and Czechoslovakia, where they didn't have the slightest chance of a career."64 Once in France, however, these talentless hacks succeeded "in a trice" by conspir ing with a corrupt art market that used the techniques of modern advertising in order to dupe a gullible public. Gillouin lamented that foreigners succeeded when "hundreds of artists of good French race . .. vegetate all their lives in an obscure mediocrity." And in the end, disgusted by the state of his nation, he could only admire Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy for having the sense to "literally vomit" these outre modernists out of their countries. Under ferocious attack by the journalistic, academic, and artistic Right, the city of Paris caved in and decided to remove Lipchitz's statue. Le Matin gloated that "following our protest, the abominable third-rate statue in the Champs-Elysees will be removed from its pedestal."65 Meanwhile, at a dinner hosted by the Academie des Beaux-Arts, Georges Laroux praised the city's decision, arguing that the removal had been necessary "for the artistic prestige of our country."66 That spring Lipchitz watched as workmen took down the statue, quartered it, and carted it away. Given the choice between fantasies of coherence and homogeneity, and the Junyk Th Fac of the N herr State Fed hi m and Mdt/ss ge at the E position Internationale , Paris 1937 115 1</page><page sequence="21">reality of dispersal and hybridity, Parisians resolutely chose the former."7 Disturbed by this type of intolerance, many members of the cosmopolitan avant-garde had already begun to leave Paris. "I have decided to leave insane Europe," wrote Ukrainian sculptor Alexander Archipenko as he departed for the United States. "We creative people feel that our effort is useless in a place that is destined for catastrophe.""8 Lipchitz himself fled Paris in May 1940 and arrived in New York on June 13, 1941. Within six months on either side of his arrival, Andr6 Breton, Salvador Dalf, Max Ernst, Andr6 Masson, Matta, Kurt Seligmann, Yves Tanguy, Fernand L6ger, Piet Mondrian, Marc Chagall, Ossip Zadkine, and Amed6e Ozenfant had all done the same. A photograph, taken on the occasion of the exhibition Artists in Exile (Pierre Matisse Gallery, New York, March 1942), shows many of them sitting together."") At precisely this time, in his studio on Twenty-third Street, Lipchitz was hard at work on two of his most challenging reinterpretations of the classical canon: The Rape of Europa (1941) and Theseus and the Minotaur (1942).7" With the self-appointed heirs of Greece and Rome imposing order and purity on the Continent, a classicism stressing openness and cosmopolitanism had found a home in a city of exiles.

Lipchitz has referred to his work in similar terms. He noted that his work of the 1930s and 1940s was "very free and baroque in its organization" and represented "a new and open expressionist type of composition." See Jonathan Fineberg, "Lipchitz in America," in Lipchitz and the Avant-Garde: From Paris to New York, ed. Jacques Lipchitz et al. (Urbana-Champaign: Krannert Art Museum, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2002), 59-60. 59. Lipchitz was a lifelong collector of non-Western sculpture and artifacts. He bought his first piece (a painted wooden statuette from the Dahomey of French West Africa) in 1910 and supple mented his interests with visits to the Troca. In 1935, just before starting work on Prometheus, he purchased a mask made by the Toma of Guinea. Lipchitz described his relationship with this "prim itive" art as a series of "encounters" and noted that he "bought sculpture of all cultures from which I could learn something." See Irene Patai, Encounters, the Life of Jacques Lipchitz (New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls Company, 1961), 87; and Sarah L. Eckhardt and Natasha C. Ritsma, "A Collector and a Workman: Lipchitz and Non-Western Art," in Lipchitz and the Avant-Garde, ed. Lipchitz et al., 103. 60. For Lipchitz this open, cosmopolitan self was essentially a democratic self. The artist has noted that "the Phrygian cap that I placed on Prometheus had a particular significance for me as a symbol of democracy; what I was trying to show was a pattern of human progress that to me involves the democratic ideal. So, in a certain way, this is a political sculpture, propaganda for democracy." See Jacques Lipchitz with H.H. Aranson, My Life in Sculpture (New York: The Viking Press, 1972), 139. 61.

On the eve of the millennium, this choice would come under intense scrutiny by French intel lectuals. In 1997 the sculptor Alain Kirili prepared an official report entitled "For the Installation of Twentieth Century Sculptures in the Tuileries at the Dawn of the Third Millennium" that sparked a good deal of soul searching in the French capital. Distressed by the preponderance of academic art in the Tuileries gardens, Kirili was agitating for the installation of some modernist sculpture as an affir mation of the capital's key role in the evolution of modernism and a confirmation of the state's pro gressive cultural policy. What particularly fuelled Kirili's ire was the recent "implantation" of two sculptures by the quasi-academic neoclassicist Paul Belmondo on the "triumphal way," the main thoroughfare of the Tuileries. For Kirili, the bypassing of work by important modernists such as Picasso in favor of a pair of second-rate statues executed in the mediocre, muscular, neoclassical style of the 1940s was symptomatic of the coarsening of French aesthetic sensibilities since the Second World War. These issues found a receptive audience in the French intelligentsia, which used them as a springboard for a more general evaluation of the state of art in Paris at the dawn of the twenty-first century. The conclusions reached were uniformly gloomy and apocalyptic: for a city that had started the century as the undisputed leader of modern art, Paris, at the new fin de si?cle was sadly outmoded and hopelessly out of touch with postmodern developments. Most located the begin ning of the decline in the 1940s. With the Nazi occupation many radical and progressive artists fled the city, abandoning the field to sculptors like Belmondo whose work was both aesthetically and politically acceptable to the Vichy regime. But some had different ideas, most notably Philippe Dagen, art critic of Le Monde. For Dagen the 1940s were not the beginning of the decline but the ful fillment of a tendency that started in the 1920s. For Dagen, the neoclassical revival of the interwar period was the crucial step that led to the debacle of fascist aesthetics in the 1930s and 1940s and the decadence of contemporary French art. Cementing the connection between the classicism of the 1920s and fascist politics, Dagen claims that admirers of this movement are the apostles of a "bitter nostalgia" who are greater enemies of French art than the reactionary followers of Jean-Marie Le Pen.
