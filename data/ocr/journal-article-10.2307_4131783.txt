<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sara Japhet. The Commentary of Rabbi Samuel ben Meir (Rashbam) on the Book of Job. Publications of the Perry Foundation for Biblical Research in the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 2000. 487 pp. (He- brew). Our knowledge of the French school of biblical interpretation has benefited in the last two decades from much original scholarship, including newly published texts and groundbreaking studies. Sara Japhet has already contributed in both ar- eas, with her edition of Rashbam on Qohelet (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1985, with a translation by R. Salters) and studies of this school's hermeneutics. Her new book, likewise, represents a two-fold advance in scholarship. It features the (unat- tributed) Job commentary in MS Lutzki 778, which she identifies as Rashbam's, preceded by an analytic introduction, divided into seven chapters, two appendices and a bibliography that itself is a most valuable, up-to-date study of Rashbam's exegesis. After demonstrating that this commentary was, indeed, written by Rash- bam (Chapter One), Japhet outlines his concept of peshat (Chapter Two), system of beliefs (Chapter Three), literary insights (Chapter Four), and linguistics (Chap- ter Five). M. Banitt contributed a study of Rashbam's Old French glosses (Chap- ter Six), which is followed by Japhet's description of her edition (Chapter Seven). Apart from offering an important new commentary by Rashbam, critically edited and annotated, Japhet has produced the most comprehensive published study on this exegete since the pioneering work of Rosin over a century ago. Building on the substantial advances in our understanding of the interpretive tradition since that time, Japhet has created a lucid, nuanced picture of Rashbam's hermeneutical thought and practice. Japhet's greatest contribution is her thorough, insightful definition of Rash- bam's concept of peshat as embodied in the Job commentary and its relation to his other writings. In his Torah commentary, Rashbam makes a point of interpreting Scripture without resorting to Midrash. Though his anti-midrashic stance is not stated openly in the Job commentary, Japhet identifies the same endeavor by show- ing how the label "peshuto" implies a rejection of the midrashic reading (pp. 55- 75). She suggests that his muted tone on Job indicates this commentary was writ- ten late in his career, when Rashbam was confident in his peshat method and no longer needed to defend it polemically. (Alternatively, we might suggest that the midrashim on Job were simply not as well known as those on the Torah, and that Rashbam did not need to address them directly.) The idea that Rashbam avoided 128</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews Midrash, of course, is hardly new; M. Greenberg,' for example, defined this as the key feature that distinguishes Rashbam's notion of peshat from Rashi's. But Japhet refines this distinction by showing that Rashbam's debate was with midrashic methods, not midrashic readings themselves, which he accepts when they meet his criteria of peshat (pp. 55n, 63, 75-78). As Japhet shows, a peshat reading, ac- cording to Rashbam, is one that takes into account (a) the literary context (pp. 55- 65); (b) derekh leshon ha-miqra ("the manner of biblical language"), i.e., biblical stylistic conventions (pp. 65-69); and (c) noheg she-ba-'olam ("the manner of the world"), i.e., typical human behavior, societal norms, and the natural order (derekh eretz ["the way of the world"] in Rashbam's Torah commentary; pp. 148-149). Rashbam applies these principles in conjunction with the ein le-daqdeq ("one must not scrutinize") rule to undercut elaborate, fanciful and supernatural midrashic readings and offer a more reasonable peshat interpretation. Japhet's new book is related in important ways to her earlier studies of the so-called compilatory genre,2 which have changed our perception of northern French exegesis. As earlier scholars have noted, many French commentaries orig- inated as marginal glosses on the biblical text or Rashi's quntres, which made them susceptible to being compiled into larger works that represent a school of thought rather than individual authorship. (One need only compare the varied collections of Tosafot on the Talmud with Maimonides' Mishneh Torah or Mishnah commen- tary, both of which bear his unmistakable signature.) A prime example of the com- pilatory genre, according to Japhet, is the Job commentary attributed to Joseph Qara, recently published by M. Ahrend.3 That work includes much material iden- tical to the Job commentary in MS Lutzki 778, which forces scholars dealing with either one to define the relationship between them. Ahrend himself noted that his text often incorporates Rashi's glosses and midrashic citations, the latter being es- pecially surprising in light of Qara's otherwise staunchly anti-midrashic tone. Japhet's solution: Ahrend's alleged "Qara commentary" is a compilatory work that draws upon Qara's original glosses on Job among other sources, including Rash- bam's commentary as attested in MS Lutzki 778. Ironically, Japhet's insight has come back to haunt her, as some scholars continue to maintain the integrity of the Qara commentary by arguing that MS Lutzki 778 is the compilation. Japhet de- votes her first chapter and an appendix to refuting this view, presented most fully by M. Rosen in his Ph.D. dissertation (University of London, 1995). The dialogue continues in M. Lockshin's review of Japhet's book, in which he defends Rosen's position (JSQ 8 [2001]: 80-104). In the end, Lockshin (p. 103) admits that this commentary reflects the imprint of Rashbam and may have been written by his 1. "The Relationship Between Rashi and Rashbam to the Pentateuch" [Hebrew].

Despite its importance, the issue of authorship should not deflect at- tention from the more central questions of hermeneutical method that Japhet ad- dresses in her comprehensive analysis. Having described what I consider to be the most important features of Ja- phet's work, I would like to select a few points where an alternative perspective might be helpful. Japhet appropriately describes Rashbam against the backdrop of his own intellectual milieu, in which Rashi and midrashic works were prevalent. Yet when we place Rashbam in a larger cultural picture that includes the Spanish exegetical tradition (of which he was largely unaware), a different result emerges. For example, in light of the modern literary reading of Scripture, Japhet empha- sizes Rashbam's sense of biblical poetics. She points to his well-known insights about biblical parallelism, a convention he notes in the Job commentary (pp. 170- 87) and regards as a means of enhancing Scripture's elegance (tiqqun milat ha- miqra; p. 173). Rashbam also discerned Scripture's proclivity for metaphor (pp. 68, 76, 87, 148-51), an exegetical concept he invoked in conjunction with the ein le- daqdeq principle to avoid elaborate midrashic readings. While it is evident that Rashbam manifests literary sensitivity, it must be distinguished from the literary awareness of exegetes in Muslim Spain who were exposed to Arabic poetics. Lack- ing such training, Rashbam's literary intuition is remarkable but his isolated styl- istic observations do not match the aesthetic sense manifested, for example, by the great Hebrew poet, Moses ibn Ezra, who analyzed biblical parallelism and met- aphor (which he distinguished from simile and allegory) as part of an overall en- deavor to identify biblical precedents for twenty Arabic poetic techniques.4 A sim- ilar observation perhaps applies to Rashbam's linguistics, which lacked the benefit of the numerous important works in this field written in Arabic. Japhet, however, does argue that Rashbam was aware of Hayyuj's work and promises to address this question elsewhere (pp. 51 n, 228). A comparison with the Andalusian school also sheds light on the rationalist tendencies Japhet detects in Rashbam. As she notes, he at times reinterprets an- thropomorphic depictions of God (pp. 127-135), an endeavor typical of the philo- sophical exegetical tradition pioneered by Sa'adia.5 But Rashbam did not have a philosophical outlook that would militate against anthropomorphism, which might explain why he does not reinterpret it consistently. A similar issue arises with re- spect to Satan in Job 1-2. The existence of a heavenly being capable of influenc- ing God was theologically untenable for Sa'adia and Maimonides, who both adopt- 4. See M. Cohen, "The Aesthetic Exegesis of Moses ibn Ezra," chap. 31.2 of Hebrew Bible / Old Testament: History of its Interpretation, ed. M. Sxebo (Gbttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2000), vol. 1/2, pp. 282-301. 5. Japhet (p. 127n) points to the Targumim as a precedent for this endeavor. While Sa'adia and Maimonides both made this claim, it has been challenged by M. Klein, Anthropomorphisms and Anthropopathisms in the Targumim of the Pentateuch [Hebrew] (Jerusalem: Makor, 1982). Citing nu- merous Targumic passages that depict God anthropomorphically, Klein argues that even those passages that avoid anthropomorphism do not reflect a philosophical stance. Sa'adia and Maimonides may have been compelled to project their anti-anthropomorphic theology onto the Targumim; but Rashbam would have had less reason to do so. 130</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews ed decisive exegetical strategies to nullify this inference. Rashbam does not address this problem explicitly; but Japhet infers from his comments that he takes Satan to be an imaginary character, employed by Scripture to hypostasize God's infliction of pain on human beings (pp. 136-137), an interpretation articulated by M. Weiss (The Story of Job 's Beginning [Jerusalem: Ha-Sokhnut Ha-Ychudit Le-Erets Yis- rael [Hebrew], 1983], pp. 38-39). While Japhet's reading of Rashbam's language is itself not unreasonable, it seems questionable to me whether he really had this sophisticated explanation in mind. After all, Rashbam accepted the existence of demons and other supernatural entities (pp. 142-46) and might have expressed himself more clearly if he really intended to claim that Satan is an imaginary character, something Maimonides does with great fanfare in Guide III:22. As Japhet herself notes (p. 56), a mythological text should prompt a peshat reader to suspend his rationalism and convey the plain sense of the text, a directive that would have led Rashbam to avoid the heavy-handed, philosophically driven read- ing and accept Satan's heavenly existence. Northern French biblical commentaries, including Rashbam's, have been char- acterized in earlier scholarship as collections of glosses on words and phrases, rather than analyses of larger literary units. Japhet, however, argues that this gen- eralization does not apply to Rashbam's Job commentary, which includes a struc- tural analysis of this biblical book (pp. 98-99, 101-9, 162-70). Rashbam shows, for example, that chapters 12-14 form an integrated speech that concludes the first round of dialogues; he addresses the incomplete structure of the third round, in which Zophar's part is missing; and he identifies the internal structure of the Eli- hu speeches. Yet Rashbam does not address meta-textual issues; i.e., he explains what the narrator and characters say and mean, but he does not evaluate their views philosophically, as the medieval Spanish exegetes, like modern readers, tend to do. Abraham ibn Ezra, for example, whose textual glosses otherwise resemble Rash- bam's, composed a lengthy epilogue in which he abstracts a theoretical stance from the speeches of each interlocutor, culminating in the ultimate philosophical re- sponse to evil uttered by God Himself. The lack of such explicit analysis in Rash- bam raises a question, in my opinion, about Japhet's view (pp. 125-27) that Rash- bam identified the correct philosophical solution to Job's suffering in Elihu's words. Ibn Ezra (comm. on Job, introduction and epilogue), Maimonides (Guide III:23), and Nahmanides (comm. on Job 33:17, 36:14) all make this claim explic- itly; but Rashbam never evaluates the analytic merit of Elihu's arguments. Japhet draws her inference from Rashbam's reading of Job 42:7, in which Elihu is spared from the divine wrath directed at the other three friends for "not speaking that which is right (nekhonah), as my servant Job [had done]." This verse, no doubt, is an important key for unlocking the book of Job and was, indeed, taken by the Span- ish exegetes as evidence that Elihu offered the correct view and therefore was not scolded by God. But why is Job not scolded for his blasphemy? In fact, God's words imply that "my servant Job" spoke "that which is right"! Ibn Ezra, Maimonides and Nahmanides all answer that Job merits this status because he retracted his blas- phemy and accepted the philosophical truth he received from God. When we turn to Rashbam against this backdrop, it becomes evident that he reads 42:7 quite dif- ferently. He explains that Job was spared from God's wrath because his blasphe- 131</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews my was mitigated by suffering (as suggested in the Talmud [p. 125]), and that Eli- hu was spared because he spoke to Job in a consoling manner (as Rashi on 36:9 argues), unlike the three friends who criticized Job. According to Rashbam, then, God's wrath indicated the interlocutors' moral and religious flaws, not philosoph- ical errors. Just as Job's blasphemous words were excusable (but, presumably, not correct) in light of his despair, Elihu was exceptional among Job's friends because of his moral virtue, not his philosophical insight. This reading of 42:7 comes clos- er to the modern view that the book of Job teaches that there is no philosophical solution to the problem of evil, and that true friends must respond to a sufferer with compassion and sensitivity.6 Mordechai Z.
