<plain_text><page sequence="1">JAN C. DAWSON Landmarks of Home in the Pacific Northwest One of the most familiar metaphors of postmodern ecological con- sciousness is the earth as home. "Home" as a place where caring is both learned and practiced is the central metaphor of much eco- feminist theory; for the bioregionalist movement, home is the web of life in which humans participate in communities in particular places. Women and men who currently are writing about nature use the metaphor as well, usually to mean that either some par- ticular environment or the planet Mother Earth will welcome us if we will cease our practices of domination. Two recent feminist studies of connections between the valuations of nature and of home- Carol Bigwood's Earth Muse: Feminism , Nature , and Art and Vera Norwood's Made from This Earth : American Women and Nature -promise to raise understanding of the potential richness of the metaphor to a new level. Using the methods of existential phenome- nology to recover the feminine in metaphysics, Bigwood "works toward a postmodern ethic of place" in which a reconceptualized notion of "world-earth-home" defines it as both where care begins and a place of self-criticism. And in her history of nineteenth- and twentieth-century women's contributions to the way Americans look at nature, Norwood demonstrates that ecofeminism is only the "most recent collective attempt [by women] to bring the values of home to bear on public environmental decision-making processes."1 The metaphor of home is not without its critics, however. Such criticism reminds us that "home" has not always been and today is</page><page sequence="2">2 ISLE not everywhere a welcoming place, that, indeed, some of the most devastating events in people's lives, and especially in women' lives, have historically occurred in the home. In Western philosophy, the home, or oikos, has traditionally been so subordinated to the polis that it may provide too weak a foundation on which to build an ethics of environmental responsibility suitable for large political entities like the United States. Furthermore, historians of any area once conceived by large groups of people as a "frontier" must espe- cially doubt the efficacy of the home metaphor as they contemplate the high environmental and personal costs of "making a home" in unfamiliar and seemingly unfriendly places.2 One such place, the Pacific Northwest, has recently seen the pub- lication of a spate of books seeking to define the specialness of the region. Two are books by women who explicitly explore the meaning of the region as home: Phoebe Goodell Judson's A Pio- neer's Search for an Ideal Home , a reminiscence originally written in 1925; and Sallie Tisdale's 1991 travel memoir and natural history, Stepping Westward: The Long Search for Home in the Pacific Northwest.3 These works are important, first, because they provide evidence of women's contribution to the way we look at nature in a particular area of the United States. Norwood's Made from This Earth concen- trates on the meshing of women's roles and the national self-image of America as "home to a new society defined as nature's nation," or "America domestica." In challenging ecofeminism to do a better job of "cultivating its own history," Norwood keeps open "the ques- tion of the ways that American women actually have chosen to cen- ter themselves in nature." One such way is through nature writing, which "springs from immersion in a specific landscape," however much it may cumulatively water the field of nationalism. Better appreciation of women's contributions to regionalism, such as The Desert Is No Lady: Southwestern Landscapes in Women's Writing and Art (1987), edited by Norwood and Janice Monk, can suggest its own answers to "how women's culture can offer a better future."4 Second, Judson's and especially Tisdale's books contain passages of nature writing that are essential to their use of the metaphor of home to embrace a particular place- in both these cases, a succes- sion of Pacific Northwest places- as special. Yet their regionalist perspective is important for its reminder that women have rarely "centered themselves" purely in nonhuman nature. Both Judson and Tisdale ultimately make their Pacific Northwest home in a "ver-</page><page sequence="3">Landmarks of Home in the Pacific Northwest 3 nacular landscape" rather than within the general natural history of America domestica or even solely out of a masculinist-constructed "wilderness."5 Finally, and most obviously, the very existence of works from dif- ferent eras that explicitly use the metaphor of home supports efforts such as Carol Bigwood's to ground an ethics of caring in the human survival strategy of searching for a "belonging-place."6 However much women have experienced home as oppressive and however much Western culture has privileged the public over the private sphere, home is also what people have called the places where they are engaged in the most fundamental relationships and tasks re- quired for living and hence the places where they make their most basic decisions about how to live.7 How people have actually con- structed those tasks, relationships, and choices, like the ways in which they have actually chosen to center themselves in nature, must always inform the theories by which we seek to heighten our ecological consciousness. The following analyses of Tisdale's and, especially, Judson's books stay close to the textual narratives to underscore that, for each woman, home was as much a particular process of establish- ing connectedness, of becoming at home, as it was a specific place. Although the texts are different in purpose and style, home is, in both, first, a place from which deliberate separation occurs in the pursuit of a better, or a better understanding of, home. This im- mediately locates the authors outside the merely interior, domestic sphere commonly, although not always correctly, associated with both the classical Greek oikos and the bourgeois house. In each, the author also initiates or at least commits to the search, which indi- cates that she is anything but a reluctant explorer of an unfamiliar landscape. Both Judson and Tisdale must struggle with sacrifice and disappointment, certainly. But eventually Judson is able to claim a new place as home, not an ideal place but as rich in associations as her memory of the home she left, whereas Tisdale reclaims as home the same place to which, however, she now has much deeper and stronger connections. Phoebe Judson was twenty-three years old when she and her new husband set out in 1833 from the shores of Lake Erie in Ohio for the Puget Sound region of the soon-to-be-established Washington Terri- tory. She had been settled in the Nooksack Valley for fifty-four years</page><page sequence="4">4 ISLE when her reminiscence was published in 1925, but she had searched for her ideal home for many years both before and after coming to far northwestern Washington. Because A Pioneer's Search is a remi- niscence, Judson exercised greater control over its thematic devel- opment than if it were a diary; thus, she is very explicit about how her experience and understanding of her search for her ideal home changed. The meaning of home for Phoebe Judson was always inti- mately linked with the natural environment and particularly with that perspective on nature we now distinguish as the scenic.8 But it also came to have additional associations with rootedness and con- tinuity, with the dimension of time as well as of romanticized place.9 Judson set the stage for "the romance of frontier life" (7) by char- acterizing herself as a pioneer's new wife who, with her husband, was willing "to encounter dangers, endure hardships and privations in order to secure a home that we might call 'ours[,]' . . . [that] would make us independent" (9). She then presents her first description of "[t]he many air castles that I built concerning my 'ideal home' while the preparations for our long journey were being made": It should be built by a mountain stream that flowed to the Pacific, or by some lake, or bay, and nothing should obstruct our view of the beautiful snow-capped mountains. True, it would be built of logs, but they would be covered with vines and roses, while the path leading to it should be bor- dered with flowers and the air filled with their sweet perfume. "Home, home, sweet home; Be it ever so humble, There's no place like home." (9) The phrase "air castles" alerts the reader that the actual home or homes into which the Judsons settle, as well as their search itself, are going to end up being less romantic than Phoebe anticipates, and we cannot help but wonder why. There must have been many such lovely places and abundant resources from which to make such a simple home somewhere in northwestern Washington Territory. Seeing the elements of the landscape in which she would locate her home, such as streams, stands of timber- "I love the tim- ber" Judson declared after sighting a small stand in the middle of an otherwise treeless prairie en route to the Pacific Northwest (34)- and snow-capped mountains, always evoked reflections on her ideal (27, 51, 66). Such passages are often ambiguous, how-</page><page sequence="5">Landmarks of Home in the Pacific Northwest 5 ever. On one hand, a stream and its drooping willow branches in the Bear River Valley of southeastern Idaho inspired the hope that Puget Sound would provide a similar setting for her ideal home; the scenery in this passage seems an essential component. But in the next paragraph, Judson recalls passing many delightful hours as a child "building, re-building and furnishing the 'ideal home' that should some day be mine- little dreaming that it would be located west of the Rocky mountains." Here the exterior landscape is peripheral and the ideal home is really a Victorian girl's doll- house. Back in her adult pioneer present Judson does, ultimately, connect landscape and the Victorian house by having the mountains or rivers "sweetly enshrine" the ideal home, a most Victorian senti- ment indeed. But then, as if the aged author finds this too roman- tic a reminiscence, she concludes this reflection with, "Traveling so far after the slow, plodding cattle nearly cured me of building 'air castles,' excepting those of a practical nature. I only hoped and prayed that we would live to get through with our little family" (51). At one level, home is neither scenery nor houses, but, instead, wherever we are safe with the people we love.10 Whether Judson's hope was waning or her ideal actually unrav- eling, by the time her wagon train descended into the Columbia River Valley in Oregon and the pioneers began in earnest to antici- pate the end of their journey, she confessed that "the more sublime the scenery the more difficult became our progress" (68). As if sub- consciously exploring what would happen if the Pacific Northwest landscape continued to be inhospitable to pioneers like herself, she even dreamed one night that her ideal home ended up on "the wrong side of" a Puget Sound river and "I was not at all pleased" (69). Then, while visiting her sister, who had settled the year before outside Portland, this self-proclaimed lover of timber, this person who had also reflected that "a tree comes as near being human as any inanimate thing that grows" (66), now admitted she could not imagine being content "in the midst of so gloomy a forest" (76) where "the huge firs and cedars . . . were so dense as to hide all scenery from our view" (75). Ambivalence toward the forest, per- haps the defining feature of the Pacific Northwest landscape then and today, recurs throughout A Pioneer's Search. As she neared Puget Sound, where she intended to settle, Phoebe Judson seems to have gotten an inkling of the distinction we would</page><page sequence="6">6 ISLE make between scenery- what non-natives see- and environment- what natives live within and adapt to and, in the case of most Euro- pean Americans, strive to transform. One of A Pioneer's Search's most important contributions to our understanding of how the first generation of white settlers thought about their environment is its evidence of Phoebe Judson's réévaluation of her romantic attitude toward nature. For her this réévaluation included a revision of her concept of the ideal home.11 As a romantic, Phoebe Judson evaluated nature in terms of what it did for the soul or as a metaphor for a spiritual interpretation of a person's life. The best scenery, she concluded, was that which refreshed and inspired the soul (51, 64-66, 81). Contrary to the fears she felt on first entering the Oregon Territory, Phoebe Jud- son's first home had ideal scenery for a romantic. At Grand Mound in Washington Territory, so named by its first settler, her father, "to distinguish it from adjacent prairies that were covered with small mounds!,] . . . when the fog cleared away the blue sky and mountain scenery in the pure atmosphere were a feast for the soul" (86, 88). The glass windows in her second log house made her especially ap- preciative of "the beauties of nature, so grateful to the busy house- wife" often confined for long hours indoors (116-17). The presence of her parents and the beauty of the place should have meant that her search was over. "Grand Mount [sic] prairie would have filled my conception of an 'ideal home,' " she confided, "[b]ut for the un- productiveness of the gravelly soil" (88). Early in Judson's extended account of their lives at Grand Mound she admitted that they knew very little about "the nature of soil, having no experience in agricultural lines" (86). They settled where they did, instead of on the richer bottomlands closer to Puget Sound, she later explained, to be closer to other settlers and, hence, "least exposed to dangers from the Indians" (97). Even though the "prairie abounded with deer, the forest with grouse and pheasants, . . . the streams . . . with salmon and trout" and they were able to eat native crabapples and berries, they continued to have "visionary . . . plans for raising great crops" (89, 97). Part of her ideal "air castle" was to have walls "stacked [with] potatoes, onions, cabbages, beets, peas and beans" (97). When the gophers and squirrels consumed most of the garden produce and the garden was turned over to produc- ing sorrel, Phoebe "began to fear this spot was not the 'ideal home'</page><page sequence="7">Landmarks of Home in the Pacific Northwest 7 about which I had built so many 'air castles' " (105). Scenery alone, then, did not make the environment hospitable to the ideal home. The environment needed to sustain pioneer life, specifically, the life of the pioneer family farmer.12 Within a year the Judsons "again set forth on the quest for an ideal home" on the bottomlands of the Chehalis River, south of Grand Mound. The area was much more conducive to a garden and to growing commercial grain, but "[t]he inconveniences of our environment," especially the "lack of harvesting and transporta- tion facilities" and "the constant drudgery effectually took all the romance and poetry out of farm life" (133). Phoebe recounts wish- ing they had learned to adapt to subsistence farming on the Grand Mound prairie by using fertilizer and having a few cows, sheep, and chickens. There were also few spiritual compensations along the Chehalis, where "[a] heavy growth of alder, cottonwood, maple, poplar and willow obstructed our view of the snow-capped moun- tains, river and other scenery that would have lifted our thoughts from the sordid things of earth" (134). And there was not even suf- ficient elevation on the claim to build an ideal home that would not be washed away by seasonal flooding. Nevertheless, Judson's famil- iarity with native flora, her appreciation for the abundant wildlife, and her empathy with the humanness, even the spirituality, of the local Indians, recorded sparingly while she was at Grand Mound, grew substantially during their second year in the Pacific North- west. Even though her ideal home seemed no closer to realization, she was becoming much more at home where she was. Conflicts between whites and Indians, territorial politics, and the Civil War deferred Phoebe's search for her ideal home during the 1860s, when the Judsons lived in Olympia, the territorial capital. When the discovery of gold in British Columbia looked like it might bring prosperity to upper Puget Sound, the Judsons decided to join friends who had already moved to the area that is now Bellingham. Determined to try their hand again at homesteading, the Judsons departed for Whatcom Bay in spring 1871, leaving civilization even more behind than when they set out from Lake Erie. The Judsons employed an Indian couple to canoe them up to the head of the Nooksack River. Judson likened the canoe trip to their earlier travel by prairie schooner but noted that now "we had no fear of the Indians" (205). More than that, she recorded the details of</page><page sequence="8">8 ISLE what the Indians ate and how they cooked. Judson also commented extensively on the native wildlife the Indians identified. Before leaving Olympia the Judsons had agreed to care for two children of the original homesteader and his Indian wife, and, whereas earlier Judson had failed to distinguish one Indian tribe from another, now the family's existence became deeply intertwined with that of Indi- ans whom she clearly distinguished as Lummi and Nooksack. This did not mean that Phoebe ceased to want the Indians to become Christians and to give up some of their less "civilized habits," but it did mean that she came to see the Indians as she would have seen (and in the case of bachelor homesteaders, probably did see) any white non-Christians rather than as a separate and savage race. The scenery of the upper Nooksack Valley fulfilled every roman- tic expectation Phoebe had earlier envisioned. "I never had seen a spot whose environments more perfectly fulfilled my dreams of an 'ideal home/ " Judson remarked about her first stocktaking of the location of their homestead (208). "Here we passed many quiet, un- eventful years, remote from the world, surrounded by the beauties and bounties of nature. The snow-capped mountains were an un- ceasing joy and inspiration. The joyous sparkling Nooksack rolled at our feet. The forests teemed with game, the marshes with wild fowl, and the rivers and small streams abounded with salmon and trout" (209). About Bellingham Bay she later declared: "a more lovely scene I had never beheld; even my beautiful Lake Erie did not surpass it" (218). The only imperfection in this setting were two log jams on the Nooksack, which the community pitched in to have removed (219-20). The only real source of sadness was loneli- ness brought on by the absence of loved ones, one of whom Phoebe deeply missed taking long walks with along "beautiful, beautiful Lake Erie" (222-23). Surprisingly little appears in the reminiscence about how the family actually lived off the land on the Nooksack, although it is clear they did subsistence farming, had an orchard, and raised a few head of livestock. This was the kind of life Judson later real- ized they could have had at Grand Mound had they known more about farming from the start. Although family members were not in the Nooksack Valley, as they had been at Grand Mound, enough settlers had followed them to set up a post office, which they named Lynden, and Phoebe's husband became postmaster (234).</page><page sequence="9">Landmarks of Home in the Pacific Northwest 9 Phoebe grew both more philosophical and more spiritually weary, rather than more at home, however, as the rigors of the life and its remoteness resulted in deaths, including those of children. Phoebe herself almost died while caring for others during an 1875 typhoid epidemic, and her premonition at that time of her "heav- enly home" seemed to lessen her enthusiasm for her ideal home by the Nooksack: "the first objects that greeted my fully awakened eyes were the great fir trees that cast their shadows over my earthly home. Surely, I thought, this cannot be heaven. Oh, how dark and dreary this earth life appeared" (242). Mountaintop scenery could still "captivate" her, as when, on a rare hiking excursion, she felt that "elevated above the sordid cares of earth life- resting and drink- ing in the pure mountain air- we were that much nearer heaven" (261). But even this carefree pleasure, which revived Judson for awhile, witnessed an old Indian woman's sadness over her people's loss of the valley in which the mountain-climbing party camped. In what may have been her consummate, though unconscious, act of spiritual identification with the Indians, Judson wrote of Polly's private wailing: "In spite of their nomad life, I have noticed the love of home and friends is a pronounced characteristic of the Indian nature" (262). That the ideal home on the upper Nooksack had never been so ideal after all also becomes clear in Judson's almost unrestrained enthusiasm for the development boom that hit Lynden after Wash- ington gained statehood in 1889. When a sawmill finally came to Lynden, the townspeople set out to erect the first real church, and the Judsons started building a larger house with two stone fire- places. We learn that Phoebe's " 'ideal home' was one more step nearer completion" (279, 281). Again she insists that "[a] more en- chanting spot upon which to rear it could hardly be surpassed on earth[,]" but what makes the new homesite desirable is differently ordered from before: "The soil so productive, the scenery most magnificent, and the climate all one could desire . . . and [n]o gam- bling dens, no saloons, nor even a drug store where that 'dark bev- erage of hell' could be procured" (280). Scenery is now secondary to the economic and even social advantages of the new location, but she also seems to have recovered a faith in primeval innocence that she lost long ago, when she concludes: "our environments were as pure as when created by the hand of God" (280).</page><page sequence="10">10 ISLE Despite the damage it caused to the forest, Judson writes equally enthusiastically about the new construction on the rest of the town- site: The stately firs and wide spreading cedars, under whose branches the wild animals had roamed and the Indian erected his wigwam, and performed his mysterious enchantments for unknown centuries, now found their lofty tops brought low. Great columns of smoke and flame ascended day and night from the many high piled log heaps. The nightly spectacle pre- sented by the many glowing fires was grand, as well as inspir- ing. (281-82) She admitted that "it grieved me to see the great forests despoiled" by the felling of so many trees, but she "realized it was one of the 'needs be' in the path of progress" (279). And in what consisted the progress? For one thing, it relieved the tedium of an emotion- ally rewarding but exhausting and seemingly endless routine of caring for others. Town building was, in contrast, a scene of "ac- tivity and bustle cheering indeed to ones who had wanted so many years, Macaber-like [sic], for 'something to turn up' " (279). And for another, the task of establishing family farms "in the almost un- inhabited country" to which Judson believed the U.S. government had "invited" the pioneers apparently had been only partially suc- cessful (194, 304). As she matured, Phoebe's satisfaction came from "see[ing] the silent wilderness grown pregnant with human life, and dotted with beautiful homes"; hence, she welcomed the "indescrib- able air of excitement and thrill that accompanies the carving of a town in the wilderness" (282). Even as she took pride in her contribution to transforming the "wilderness," Phoebe Judson came to believe that her earlier fear- ful dream of planting her ideal home on the wrong side of the river had contained a spiritual truth. She was wrong to have thought she could erect her ideal home- now conceived as a place "where sor- rowing and sighing are unknown" (309)- on this earth. With the welcomed growth of Lynden came liquor, whose destructive effects on the Indians she had lamented long ago (101). Only across the river of death could she now hope to find her truly "ideal home." But it would still be in a "fair city," by the river, in "sweet fields," with the "tree of life blooming" (309). Until her time to cross that river, she was happy to live "under the shade of the wide-spreading</page><page sequence="11">Landmarks of Home in the Pacific Northwest 11 maples my husband planted after clearing the ground of the many huge majestic fir trees that so thickly studded it" (314). In the final analysis, Phoebe Judson's search for an ideal home in the Pacific Northwest in the late nineteenth century remained a process rather than becoming a place, even when she was settled. It involved constant adjustments among several conflicting impulses. Even more fundamentally than for us today, home had to meet both her spiritual and her material needs. It had to be productive enough to feed, clothe, and shelter its inhabitants, but it also had to refresh their spirits with its natural beauty. The picturesque scenery that invigorated Judson was not the same as the fauna and flora that supported her material needs, except, perhaps, for an occasional encounter with interesting wildlife. Home was not just a natural landscape full of material as well as spiritual resources, however. Judson's ideal home needed to contain meaningful human contacts, both the personally intimate sort and the sort that manifests itself as collective effort. It was no coincidence that Judson was able to build a home as close as possible to her earthly ideal only when she no longer feared, and even came to respect and love, the Indi- ans. Finally, Judson's earthly ideal home was a place where women as well as men could see that they had built something lasting- a house, a town- with their hard labor, even if that meant tearing down and replacing what had been there before. Sallie Tisdale, author of Stepping Westward , would have only one serious quarrel with the foregoing summary of the characteristics of Phoebe Judson's search for the ideal home, a pioneer account she knew well and to which she was deeply indebted. Tisdale would in- sist on substituting connectives like "precisely because" in place of the qualifiers "even if" to explain the relationship between the pio- neers' labors and their often destructive impact on the environment. In the last chapter of Stepping Westward Tisdale writes: "The fact that [the first white settlers] destroyed what they found in the taking of it is an act without irony, and therein lies the surprise. There seems almost to be a kind of artistry in the subjugation of the land and the savage" (240). Much of Stepping Westward is a struggle to confront this startling conclusion, more than a little inspired by Phoebe Jud- son's sense of accomplishment but equally by her sense of failure. Tisdale grew up in northern California, an area she includes in her Pacific Northwest, and now lives in Oregon. Her connection</page><page sequence="12">12 ISLE with Phoebe Judson's world is interesting and complex. Tisdale selected Judson's central metaphor for her subtitle, although Step- ping Westward cites testimony from numerous male and, especially, other female, pioneers. Tisdale uses Judson's observations about such typically northwestern experiences as clearing the heavily for- ested land for farming and the "woeful influence of" alcohol con- sumption as well as the early abundance of salmon (20, 46, 81). But there are also striking differences between the two accounts, per- haps the most obvious being the different cultural orientations each brings to her search. In place of Judson's marriage of romantic ideas about nature and the ideal of Victorian domesticity, Tisdale's con- ceptual framework visits and revisits natural settings and human encounters with them from a self-consciously philosophical orien- tation to the meaning of "place" derived from Aristotle, Yi-Fu Tuan, and Eugene Victor Walter (9-11, 24-25). "Home" becomes wherever we "join ourselves to a place." It is both a place and a process: "We live where we have made definitions, and in the process of making definitions we create a place in which to live. . . . [We] live within [our] interpretations as much as [our] environment" (9). Tisdale's indebtedness to Judson rests most firmly on Judson's having por- trayed especially clearly how different from ours her interpretation of home was. Rather than as a search for an ideal home, Tisdale's search be- gins as a desire to understand her characteristically northwestern romanticization of pioneer ancestors, despite being fully aware of the devastating human and ecological costs of their enterprise (13- 16). Part of that search is also to understand how and why the pioneers made such a different world from the one they dreamed of (17). "I grew up surrounded by people," Tisdale explains, "who hungered for a past more noble and more true than the present, and far more noble than the real history of our own flesh, than the facts" (15). The "imagined West of the first explorers .... of the last, lost virgin place" was the home the people in Tisdale's childhood were searching for (15). Its appeal was "the possibility of a life altogether new" (15). As Tisdale learns, the pioneers dreamed of a great North- west Passage that would bring unrivaled prosperity through trade with the Orient; when they did not find it, what they did find, the magnificent Columbia River and Puget Sound, "were disappoint- ments" (8). The pioneers' disappointment is what later generations</page><page sequence="13">Landmarks of Home in the Pacific Northwest 13 do not want to see, as they also do not want to see the logic of what the first white settlers did next in the face of that disappointment. To find the land livable, the pioneers had first to adjust- in this case, to scale back- their expectations to something the land could conform to. Reflecting on the human process of defining place as home, Tisdale notes: "intimacy is nearness to self; the most out- landish surroundings can be home if they fit our expectations" (11). For many, the expectation, at least at first, became Phoebe Judson's ideal home, a moderately prosperous family farm nestled amid pic- turesque mountain scenery. For even this scaled-back expectation, however, the Pacific Northwest environment proved to be out- landish, a wild wilderness that did not readily submit to familiar methods and types of cultivation. Then, but only then, according to Tisdale, did the first white settlers become "pioneers" in the popular sense of the term: "More than the journey, more than the travail, it is reconstruction of the landscape that is the experience of the pio- neer" (169). The landscape was incomplete and required the human touch, the "sculpting of the wilderness," to make it livable, because it had not by itself conformed to the settlers' expectations. Thus Tisdale concludes: "I've only recently come to realize that my ancestors stayed here in spite of all that keeps me here- in spite of the mountains, and the storms, the high plains and the wild coast" (239). Each generation, really, according to Tisdale, each indi- vidual, defines place as home. For Tisdale and others of her- that is, our- generation, the Pacific Northwest must provide not deco- rum and geniality but untamed, untouched landscape. Her expecta- tion is no more right than her ancestors' expectation was, however. They found "a land that seemed meant for solitude and isolation, for the singular existence of the single man, and it had to be turned into a world of commerce and families" (239). We have now "grown sick" of civilizing and "long for the signs of wildness, so dimin- ished and narrow and rare" (239). 13 Just as there was enough raw material in the Pacific Northwest wilderness for the ancestors to believe they could fulfill their expectations of material prosperity, so today there is just enough wildness left for the present genera- tion to fulfill its expectation or hunger for the untamed. Sallie Tis- dale started her search for home by seeking to connect with her ancestors, only to have to turn to the landscape to fulfill her own hunger "to see wilderness unchanged" (239). When she finally saw</page><page sequence="14">14 ISLE the interconnection of these two searches, she had arrived at a pro- found understanding of the unique dilemma of human adaptation to the environment: "Both hungers, the one for the human-made, the other for the untouched, are part of the search for balance, for a little of each, for the knowledge that humans, superior or no, are a species among species on a shared planet" (239). At the turning point of her understanding the pioneers, Tisdale wrote of the "great-great-grandchildren" of the pioneers like herself who "fly over the land [and] see how scrabbed and worn it had be- come" as the result of the human reconstruction of the landscape (169). That is their disappointment, that which produces their hun- ger for the untouched. That hunger Tisdale sought to satisfy by exploring much of the landscape as a present-day naturalist, by finding in the abundant forests, mountains, and water as much that fulfills her dream of the untouched and untamed as disappoints her. As a consequence, Stepping Westward has elements of what is some- times called the ramble. It moves over the landscape of all the area Tisdale calls the Pacific Northwest. It also lingers in specific moun- tain, forest, and riparian landscapes as Tisdale makes herself and her readers familiar with their details, both natural and historical. Her method of becoming intimate with, inventing nearness to, the land is not to transform it, as her ancestors did, but to make her- self familiar with its own life-giving and life-sustaining processes. Some naturalists have done this in strictly scientific terms, but the descriptions in Stepping Westward are more in the style of the inter- pretive nature writing that Thomas Lyon labels the "natural history essay" in This Incomperable Lande, and they make abundant use of gendered and erotic imagery.14 Students of Pacific Northwest regionalism debate which natural feature most distinguishes the area and to which feature regional- ists are most attached: its volcanic mountains, its forests with the largest trees in the country, or its various aquatic environments. In the third of her eleven untitled chapters Tisdale takes us on a kind of natural tour of Crater Lake, Mount Hood, and Mount Rainier, orienting us to the distinctiveness of each with carefully chosen bo- tanical or historical details. Tisdale reserves her most fulsome and gendered descriptions of mountains for Mount Shasta and the Kla- maths, both in her childhood home of northern California. About the sudden appearance of Mount Shasta as one drives north on the interstate toward Oregon she writes:</page><page sequence="15">Landmarks of Home in the Pacific Northwest 15 There is Shasta. She is skirted by an alluvial plain, green with runoff and wavering streams bordered by cottonwood. . . . After the canyons [of the Klamaths], there was suddenly noth- ing hard left in the world, only a vast green land lying soft and damp in Shasta's creamy lap. The bosomy mounds of Shasta's debris hover in the low gold light of afternoon, and around them cattle graze and crops grow. (63) Tisdale describes the Klamath mountains to the north in equally loving but geological rather than anthropomorphic detail, primarily for the purpose of explaining "what [David Rains] Wallace calls the Klamaths' 'promiscuity' " in The Klamath Knot (79). She gives the dramatic relief or contours of the range as the most immediate rea- son for this impression of promiscuity. The heat of summer fires, the resulting fertility, "independent" weather systems, all in abun- dance-even excess- surely these too are "promiscuous" features of this landscape (79). But Tisdale inserts at the end of the chapter on mountains two stories from her youth, interwoven with the story of two early-twentieth-century female missionaries to the Klamath Indians who had a love for the area equal to Tisdale's. The point of these stories is to testify not to the promiscuity but to the sacred- ness of the place and the pain of sacred spaces lost. It is not the mountains per se but the forests in which Tisdale feels most at home, however. As a sixteen-year-old exploring the red- wood forest in northern California's Siskiyou Mountains with three friends, Tisdale had an archetypal experience of being at home in the natural environment. Recalling how it felt to be huddled in "a slight opening between the close and hugging trees" (24), Tisdale reflects, "I find it hard now to imagine ever being happier than that, or being more willing or able to be happy than I was that night." The reason at first sounds like the confession of a classic Ameri- can transcendental naturalist: "I was a very small thing in a very large place, at the mercy of great forces" (24-25). But rather than revealing her cosmic insignificance or absorption into the cosmos, the experience made her feel "a small immortality" (25). "My sig- nificance had to do with fit, not size," she explains. In contrast with many early pioneers, who found "this lovely place . . . too big and inhuman to take," Tisdale felt "put in my proper place being there, knowing that's where I am" (25). In many ways, the rest of Stepping Westward is a search for a deeper understanding and a renewal of</page><page sequence="16">l6 ISLE that ultimate feeling of being at home, of finding one's proper place in the human and nonhuman natural order of things. A particular forest had provided the adolescent Tisdale with the comfort of "hugging trees"; forests in general made the mature naturalist writer feel at home at least in part because Tisdale identi- fied with the female imagery so often used to describe forests. The term "virgin" used to describe never-logged forests she finds both ironic and apt. Most of the trees in a virgin forest are, after all, "[plretty big virgins: strapping, thick-thighed trees" (47). On the other hand, she points out, the virgin forest retains "its purity by our largess" (47). Even more appropriate, Tisdale observes, is the term "climax" as applied to the mature state of an old, although not necessarily virgin, undisturbed forest: "It is a proper word, erotic and unfinished, this place quiet and ripe and hanging eternally at the cusp, the peak, the zenith of its reach" (47). Elsewhere Tisdale mentions, although without such pithy comment, that undisturbed forests contain many nursing logs, which, as they go through de- composition and decay, provide the nourishment that sustains the growth of new trees (53, 233). The forest is, then, female. What has happened to forests in the Pacific Northwest Tisdale cannot help but take personally, and there is evidence that it has caused her to lose her conviction that the forest is her proper place. It may be stretching a point about her consciousness, but the recent proliferation of slasher films showing the mutilation of women will give pause to at least some readers of Tisdale's description of logging "slash." Slash is "a peculiar kind of garbage ... an almost impassable surface of organic waste strewn across the ground," left behind when a forest is "clear-cut" (34). Clear-cutting is particularly shocking to see when done to old- growth forests, many but not all of which are also virgin. The lan- guage used to defend this practice Tisdale finds telling: "these are the forests consistently dismissed as 'decadent' and 'overripe,' dis- missed as selfish systems hogging the most nutrients" (230). Such language grants forests "sentience" and an "aesthetic," changing them from simply a crop to be harvested into "something almost wicked" (231). This sounds, of course, much like the early settlers from the East, who found the trees "too dark, too cool, . . . inde- cently large"(42)- like an all-consuming womb? Tisdale calls the perspective or "aesthetic" of the lumberman "a trust in mechanism, an inclination toward control" (219). The</page><page sequence="17">Landmarks of Home in the Pacific Northwest 17 lumberman sees "miles of clear-cut . . . [as] a project finished" whereas she sees "a scene of devastation and loss ... a kind of physical and psychological violence" (219). The woman who, as an adolescent, felt at home among the "hugging trees" realizes that "whether I wanted to be or not [,] I am what he might call a 'tree hugger'"(2i9). But, as the entire account of forest and trees in Step- ping Westward suggests, that label misses the point. Tisdale is, in reality, a forest hugger: she experiences the land not as a cluster of individual trees but as an organic, integrated landscape, and when it is harvested, the land is changed forever (228), or, as she puts it, "The forest is broken as a promise is broken" (232). 15 Tisdale introduces her analysis of the effects of logging with the assertion: "How one feels about trees, both singly and in forest, is a large measure of how one lives here- literally how one's life is spent" (207). In the next-to-last chapter of Stepping Westward Tis- dale recognizes that the "tree hugger" and the logger in the Pacific Northwest share an "improper depth of emotion" about trees (207). Surely this is an important step toward locating herself in the con- tinuum created by the pioneers' dream of a cultivated land for which logging the forests was so essential. But the recognition also means Tisdale has to find the untamed and unchanged in some landscape other than the forests she loved as a child. Although Tisdale gives many more words to describe the mean- ing of forests in the identity of the Northwest and northwesterners, it is her experience of the waters of Washington's Puget Sound that actually enables her to complete her long search for home.16 After visiting a geoduck research project on the southern end of Washing- ton's Puget Sound at Hood Canal, Tisdale decides to go snorkeling by herself. "Sometimes in deep water I'm caught by visceral leg- dangling shark fears that mean more than sharks," she admits. "I am caught up in the strangeness of where I am, the size" (156). But on this particular expedition, much like on the camping trip taken in the Siskiyous when she was sixteen, Tisdale feels at home in the most primal sense: I felt surrounded by fertility. It was like being plunged into a culture medium, a womb. I was feeling a generative intimacy with the water, an abrupt fetal memory almost embarrassingly immediate. I was paddling through a soup of milt and roe, copulation determined and steady on every side. Geoducks and</page><page sequence="18">l8 ISLE anemones, like a lot of marine creatures, reproduce by spew- ing clouds of sperm into the water. I caught a mouthful of salt water, a teaspoon mouthful overflowing with seed. (157) The tone of this passage anticipates a realization Tisdale has at the end of the book when she sees "this land . . . [as] carnal and sacred at once" (245). Tisdale follows snorkeling at Hood Canal with a night dive in a different part of Puget Sound. She hoped to see octopus, to whose mating habits she had been introduced by another scientist friend, but she "was embraced instead by moon jellies," reminiscent of the hugging trees of the Siskiyous. The diver and the moon jellies, the "small shells of sea, floating, turning themselves almost inside- out with each pulse, collapsing in the hard wash of my hand move- ments, righting themselves again," do a kind of dance together (162). Do we hear echoes of the Indian hunter commiserating with the hunted here? In at least some metaphorical way, can we conclude about Stepping Westward , as we did about A Pioneer's Search , that Indian knowledge can ease the homemaking of whites? Although she is profoundly conscious of the Pacific Northwest's Indian past and knowledgeable about some Indian cultures, Sallie Tisdale is nostalgic for neither. What is taken as an Indian understanding of place is, on the other hand, one of several points of departure for her own rediscovery of the region, and a brief examination of it will en- able us to summarize the meaning of Tisdale's long search for home. "Among certain tribes," Tisdale mentions early in Stepping West- ward during a description of travel through her beloved northern California, "when a person moves, it is he who has changed, not the land; directions are derived from his orientation to a permanent landscape" (58). Such an attitude was possible when the "landscape before the white man's arrival changed very slowly" (58), but, Tis- dale, as we have already seen, concludes that, once whites began changing the land so dramatically, changes to the landscape rather than movement within it changed people (169). Still, she believes, there is a kind of irreducible bedrock created by the landscape that sets limits on the expectations or dreams for the land people can have: "A given landscape permits and prohibits how one perceives, what one is literally able to experience. ... I wonder sometimes at the me that never grew because I grew here and not somewhere else" (60). The landscape that produced her she describes in this way: "I live here, in the middle of a city that is itself in the middle of</page><page sequence="19">Landmarks of Home in the Pacific Northwest 19 a tamed land in the middle of a long-sought, long-lost wilderness" (61). The history of the landscape may be linear, but her experi- ence of it is not. "[A] free woman" paradoxically "unable to move," she internalizes the character of the landscape and "in the end I've traced a circle," the circle that defines who she can be and what her expectations can be (60). The circle is the structure of Stepping Westward. Having found her untamed wilderness beneath the waters of Puget Sound, Tisdale re- turns to face head-on the reality that her ancestors were able to be at home only by clearing and then reconstructing the environments they discovered (163 passim). The aspect of the logic behind their transformations, the "heritage," that Tisdale finally accepts is the faith that "something will come up. The West will provide" (245). It was, after all, the fecundity of the land itself that made such a heri- tage possible (119). The arid Southwest is also the West, but if those who lived there ever uttered the words "the West will provide" it was more a question or desperate prayer than a confident affir- mation. Tisdale's discovery and embrace of the Puget Sound moon jellies, as it were, enabled her also to embrace her region's heritage, despite its frequent "narcissistic" excesses (243). Phoebe Judson and Sallie Tisdale are part of this same Pacific Northwest heritage; the faith that "the West will provide" inspired both of their searches for home. In what way does it make sense, then, to describe Tisdale's search for home as "longer" than Phoebe Judson's, as the subtitle of Stepping Westward suggests, although her life there so far has been shorter? In contrast to Judson, Tisdale can- not search for her home just in her present; there are too many simi- larities to accompany the painfully obvious differences between her search and that of her ancestors. Her search must encompass theirs, but to be distinctly hers it must also encompass the history of the land and of its original inhabitants. Its greater length is, then, the longer time it covers, but it is also the more spiritually demanding process of staking claim to that past and making herself part of it rather than eternally picking up and moving on. Home as a place where people, including women, can and would want to choose to stay, not because it is ideal or because it is safe but because it is the locus of connectedness- of an existential "fit"- may, finally, be Sallie Tisdale's most important contribution to our ongoing search to find in home a suitable metaphor for ecological consciousness. Her method of seeking the balance between hunger for the human-</page><page sequence="20">20 ISLE made and the hunger for the untouched may be best suited to ex- ploring the Pacific Northwest, but the history of other regions may reveal the workings of other distinct dialectics between human defi- nition and the responsiveness of the landscape. In "The Landscape of Home" David Sopher attests that "[t]he land- marks of home are the signs that one is welcome" (146). For Phoebe Judson and Sallie Tisdale, the landmarks of home are the signs - often actively sought- of being welcome. To be at home required them to take a journey out of themselves to meet, to connect with, to be engaged by a place. Their movement outward took differ- ent forms. The natural history portions of A Pioneer's Search , for example, locate Phoebe Judson in the tradition her contemporary Susan Cooper began of making "wilderness . . . part of a home- scape rather than some far and fearsome frontier threatening civili- zation"; Cooper left the house to study nearby fauna and flora and thereby to define the wild as indigenous.17 In this journey Judson traveled the same path among the Indians as among the animals and plants. For Sallie Tisdale the recovery of a place she had ex- perienced as welcoming her home in her childhood required travel in time as well as in space. She had to explore the vernacular land- scape encoded by her ancestors, the mothers as well as the fathers, the Indians as well as the whites, along with the majestic landscapes of mountains and forests and the intimate seascape of Hood Canal. In Earth Muse Carol Bigwood writes, "Home, as I understand it, is a nomadic place, an unfinished place of variable historical and geographical boundaries, but a belonging-place nonetheless" (292). It has more the character of an evolving neighborhood than an efficiently run household. After reading Tisdale and even Judson, Bigwood's reconceptualization of home seems less radical than the impression created by her method for thoroughly deconstructing the dualisms and hierarchies established by western metaphysics.18 For these "actual women" who had a special interest in their par- ticular Pacific Northwest environment and the ability to pursue that interest, home, as Vera Norwood also discovered, has had a much richer, longer, and more fluid history as a metaphor of ecological consciousness than we have heretofore imagined.19</page><page sequence="21">Landmarks of Home in the Pacific Northwest 21 NOTES 1. Early uses of the home metaphor for ecological consciousness in- clude Gary Snyder, Earth house hold (New York: New Directions, 1969) and Carolyn Merchant, "Earthcare: Women and the Environmental Movement," Environment 23 (June 1981): 6-13, 38-40. Ecofeminist writings in addition to Merchant include three essays in Irene Diamond and Gloria Feman Oren- stein, eds., Reweaving the World (San Francisco: Sierra Club Books, 1990); Judith Plant, "Searching for Common Ground: Ecofeminism and Bioregion- alism," 155-61; Cynthia Hamilton, "Women, Home, and Community: The Struggle in an Urban Environment," 215-22; and Catherine Keller, "Women against Wasting the World: Notes on Eschatology and Ecology," 262-63. Bioregionalism uses the home metaphor without always making explicit its association with women. See Van Andruss, Christopher Plant, Judith Plant, and Eleanor Wright, eds., Home ! A Bioregional Reader (Philadelphia: New Society Publishers, 1990). Recent examples of nature writers using the home metaphor are the following selections in Lorraine Anderson, ed., Sisters of the Earth (New York: Vintage Books, 1991): Celia Laighton Thax- ter, "Childhood on White Island," 71-75; China Galland, "Running Lava Falls," 149-51; Terry Tempest Williams, "The Bowl," 178-81; Marge Piercy, "Homesick," 305-07. On nature writers using the home metaphor, see also Peter Sauer, ed., Finding Home: Writing on Nature and Culture from Orion Magazine (Boston: Beacon Press, 1992); John Daniel, The Trail Home (New York: Pantheon Press, 1992); Carol Bigwood, Earth Muse: Feminism , Nature, and Art (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1993), 7, 4, 10, 295-96; Vera Norwood, Made from This Earth: American Women and Nature (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1993), 260. 2. The sharpest critique of dependence on the metaphor of home in eco- feminist theory and ecological politics is Janet Biehl, Rethinking Ecofeminist Politics (Boston: South End Press, 1991), esp. chap. 6, "Women in Demo- cratic Politics." For other qualifications, see the writings of selected geog- raphers: Yi-Fu Tuan's classic Topophilia (New York: Columbia University Press, 1974), 99-100, and idem, Space and Place (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1977), chaps. 10 and 11; and David Sopher, "The Land- scape of Home," in The Interpretation of Ordinary Landscapes, D. W. Meinig, ed. (New York: Oxford University Press, 1979), 129-49. Finally, bell hooks' explication of the role of "homeplace" in African American culture is a reminder that the ancient classical and Victorian polarizations of the do- mestic and the political are not relevant to all Western experience or theo- rizing involving home. See "Homeplace: A site of resistance," in bell hooks, Yearning: Race, Gender, and Cultural Politics (Boston: South End Press, 1990), 41-49. Much to her credit, Norwood devotes part of chapter 6 in Made from This Earth to the dilemmas of those with a history of being dispossessed of</page><page sequence="22">22 ISLE nature defined in terms of home but who nevertheless later participate in its cultural construction. 3.

Martha Allen's Traveling West: 19th Century Women on the Overland Routes (El Paso: Texas Western Press, 1987) establishes the outlines of how women's reactions to western landscapes both resembled and differed from men's during the period of travel. In Topophilia Yi-Fu Tuan generalizes that "[o]nce a people have settled down and adapted somewhat to the new set- ting, it is difficult to know their environmental attitudes for, having become native, they lose the urge to make comparisons and comment on their new home" (68). Judson's reminiscence helps fill this gap for the Pacific North- west. 12. Richard White emphasizes the dominance of the family farm model in the "recreation" of the Pacific Northwest landscape in "The Altered Land- scape: Social Change and the Land in the Pacific Northwest," in William G. Robbins, Robert J. Frank, and Richard E. Ross, eds., Regionalism and the Pacific Northwest (Corvallis: Oregon State University Press, 1983), 109-27. Using the example of Susan Fenimore Cooper's Rural Hours, Norwood establishes that the domesticity of the family farm was long the concep- tion of home that enabled middle-class white women to reconcile their nature study with their gender role expectations. See chap. 2 of Made from This Earth. 13. This reversal of preferences for tamed and untamed nature is another theme in Norwood's Made from This Earth, 50.</page><page sequence="23">Landmarks of Home in the Pacific Northwest 23 14. Thomas J.
