<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gregory Radick, The Simian Tongue. The Long Debate about Animal Language (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2008), xiv + 577 pp., illus., $45.00, £23.50. In the 1970s, there was a small boom in studies designed to teach pri- mates some sort of language, ranging from contrived communications systems using physical props to American Sign Language. And the anthropological linguist Jane Hill pronounced that it was doubtful "that any of us will in our lifetimes see again a scientific breakthrough as</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 781 profound in its implications as when Washoe, the baby chimpanzee, raised her hand and signed 'come-gimme' to a comprehending human" (p. 319). Gregory Radick's ambitious book places these studies in an international scientific context and covers more than a century of debate. At this moment, when apes have recently been granted legal rights in Spain and other countries are likely to follow Spain's example, the book is extremely timely, since its basic subject is the long argument about whether non-human primates share with us the qualities of sen- sibility required for speech. But the view that has prevailed for most of the time period covered by Radick's study - advanced for varying reasons and supported in diverse modes - has been that they do not, that human and non-human primates' characteristics are discontinuous. As Thomas Huxley stated in 1863, language "constitutes and makes man what he is" (p. 33); through language, humans "slowly accumu- lated and organized the experience which is almost wholly lost with the cessation of every individual life in other animals" (p. 380). In short, humans are distinctive because we have culture. The narrative center of Radick's analysis is an apparently unlikely hero: a self-taught American primatologist, Richard Lynch Garner (1848-1920), as much a showman as a scientist, who was often styled "Dr." and "Professor" and whose work attracted attention from an extraordinary array of figures, including Alexander Graham Bell; William Dwight Whitney, professor of philology at Yale; William James, the Harvard psychologist and philosopher; Ales Hrdlicka, curator of physical anthropology at the Smithsonian; and Yale psy- chologist and primatologist Robert Yerkes. In the 1880s, Garner began his quest for what he called "the simian tongue," the evolutionary precursor of human language, and his major achievement was the pri- mate playback experiment; he recorded primates' vocalizations and played his recordings back to them to see if distinct responses were elicited by distinct cries. He first tried his experiment with captives of New York's Central Park Zoo and subsequently traveled to French Equatorial Africa, where he stationed himself in a (protective) cage in the forest to listen to what he understood as primates' rudimentary language and acquired primates to whom he attempted to teach lan- guage (with minimal success). And he became so famous that "virtually no one working in or writing about comparative psychology from the 1890s on was unaware of the man and his claims" (p. 213). At the same time as Garner was working to establish that non- human primates had language, however, the psychologist Conwy Lloyd Morgan, Huxley's former student, enunciated the methodological</page><page sequence="3">782 BOOK REVIEWS principle he was to call his "canon." In 1892, he said, "in no case is an animal activity to be interpreted as the outcome of the exercise of a higher psychical faculty, if it can be fairly interpreted as the outcome of the exercise of one which stands lower in the psychological scale" (p. 51). Morgan's canon indicated that to interpret primates' cries as language was to be guilty of anthropomorphism. And during the first third of the twentieth century, the international population of students of animal behavior came to agree that vocalizations were entirely independent of thought in nonhuman animals. Not until the 1930s would it seem reasonable to reinvent the playback experiment to investigate animal communication, as occurred in the primate studies of C. Ray Carpenter, trained as a psychologist at Duke by William McDougall, whose early career included a stint of anthropological fieldwork. What had happened? The most important thing was a shift away from strictly laboratory studies to work undertaken in the field, or to research that integrated laboratory and field work, which represented the diffusion of the approach of ethologists to a range of scientists, including psychologists and biological anthropologists. Late in the twentieth century, it would be impressive (especially to popular audi- ences) when such primates as Washoe were taught languages, but Washoe and her fellows were essentially laboratory creatures. Perhaps rather more remarkable were scientists' analyses of natural communi- cations. Radick describes a series of efforts to understand animals' communications on animals' terms, beginning with Carpenter's tenta- tive use of playbacks with gibbons in Siam and including the studies of birds' learned songs conducted in the 1950s by the Cambridge zoologist W. H. Thorpe as well as his student Peter Marier, which used the sound spectrograph and approached birdsongs in the light of information theory, and the studies of vervet cries undertaken in the late 1970s in Kenya by the team of Robert Seyfarth and Dorothy Cheney, Marler's protégés (and now at the University of Pennsylvania in the Departments of Psychology and Biology, respectively), who relied on playback technology and concluded that "the same mechanisms might underlie the development of words as labels in children and in monkeys" (quoted p. 359). Cheney and Seyfarth were present at the creation of cognitive ethology, "casting off old taboos about exploring the mental awareness of animals" (p. 359). Why did it seem especially plausible around 1890 and again around 1980 that similarities between animal and human speech could be established? Radick does not see history repeating itself: Garner</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 783 contrived the playback experiment with a view to documenting the hierarchy of animal nature, whereas Cheney and Seyfarth had "an arguably antihierarchical evolutionary theory" (p. 368). But he does see a pattern in scientific fashion: scientists saw affinities among species in 1890 and again in 1980 because in each instance there was a general lack of sympathy with saltationist arguments. This makes good sense. To point to scientific fashion is to beg the question somewhat, however. What factors make saltationist arguments unappealing? To answer this question surely requires speculation about social contexts. But I know that it is distinctly unfair to ask why Radick did not abandon the rig- orous scholarly standards that inform his admirable book and indulge in speculation.
