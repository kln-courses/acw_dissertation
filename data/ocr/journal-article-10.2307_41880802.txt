<plain_text><page sequence="1">[1] 109 HINDU MYTHOLOGY IN TAMIL FIGURATIVE SPEECH Introduction. Hindu mythology has fascinated generations of Western and Indian scholars who have translated and interpreted its myriads of tales. Which aspects of this treasure-house of the imagination have aroused the interest of ordinary Indians has hardly been considered. The Tamils' interest in Hindu mythology takes seve- ral forms; the most widespread one among these are references to mythic themes in their language: sayings as well as less idiomatic similes and metaphors in the works of Tamil writers. From the very beginning of my study of Tamil culture reflected in modern Tamil literature I have been struck by the Tamil writers' love of mythic figures of speech. Notes taken for almost twenty years from the works of thirty-six writers (sixty-one short story collections, thirty-three novels and other book-length works as well as nine plays) have swelled to more than seven hundred1 making their systematic examination imperative. The first purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the Tamils' love and know- ledge of Hindu mythology. Their love for themes of religious mythology is also apparent in Tamil films, as even a casual observer of film posters may confirm. However, films only partially reveal people's knowledge of myths; they partially teach that very knowledge. The same applies the literary versions of myths, for which modern Tamil writers have a penchant. Conversely, in sayings on mythic subjects and in figures of speech created or creatively transformed by the writers, knowledge of the myths in question is taken for granted. Of course, not every Ta- mil speaker using an idiom that plays on a mythic theme is aware of its provenan- 1 The mythic themes of my corpus are not evenly distributed among the various Tamil writers. About half of them come from L.S. Ramamirtham because he uses more similes and metaphors of any type than other writers and because I have perused all of his works, while I have consulted only some by other writers. However, this numerical predominance of one writer has no appreciable influence on the choice of mythic themes, at most on the creative reinterpretation of such themes.</page><page sequence="2">110 Gabriella Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi [2 ] ce. Not every Tamil understands all mythic similes and metaphors he may find in his reading, as I have repeatedly checked. By and large, however, especially among the educated, the knowledge of Hindu mythology enshrined in the Tamil language is surprising. I do not, of course, claim that sayings on mythic themes are peculiar to Tamil; many have certainly parallels in other Indian tongues. The number of such sayings, however, clearly exceeds those current in modern We- stern languages. In Western languages sayings referring to Germanic, Celtic and Roman mythologies are extremely rare. Greek mythology and the Bible (both the Old and New Testaments) provide considerable scope for figurative expressions; but even the sum of mythic themes of any origin in Western languages cannot match their prevalence in Tamil2. Besides, with few exceptions, reference to Greek and Chri- stian mythologies has gone out of fashion in the West and occurs almost only in affected speech. Reference to Hindu myths in spoken and written Tamil, howev- er, is not felt as obsolete or affected. Of course, the great number of sayings on mythic subjects partly owes to the great number of sayings on any subject current in Tamil. The Tamil writers' love of mythic similes and metaphors partly owes to the love of figurative speech in general that has been a hallmark of Tamil literatu- re from ancient poetry to modern prose. It remains, however, that Hindu mytho- logy plays a conspicuous role in these. The second purpose of this paper is to examine the expressive uses made of mythic themes. I shall draw attention to focal interests, variations and innovations as well as to different interpretations on the part of scholars, on the one hand, or- dinary Hindus and writers on the other. In the first part of this paper I shall give a brief overview of mythic themes that have entered Tamil speech and hence are known to its speakers. In the second part I shall point out specific examples of meanings expressed through mythic themes. A) Knowledge of Hindu Mythology as Apparent in Figurative Speech. Before broaching the subject of mythic similes and metaphors found in mo- dern Tamil fiction I wish to draw attention to another source of information on people's knowledge of mythology. In addition to creating new versions of myths, Tamil writers like to refer to mythic characters and events in stories on non- mythic subjects. Such references usually pursue a didactic intent. They also tend to be couched in comparative terms and take the knowledge of the mythic con- text for granted. For brevity's sake I shall not consider them here. Two examples may give the flavour of the method. In a story by Jeyakanthan (1974: 69-70) a 2 I can think of less than one hundred standard mythic expressions of any provenance in We- stern languages.</page><page sequence="3">[3] Hindu mythology in Tamil figurative speech 111 well-to-do Brahmin father complains that his daughter put love above everything else. By running away with a low caste man she has ruined her life and brought him sorrow. Also Rama and Murukan3 loved, he recalls, but they never forgot their duty to others because of their love. In a story by Alagiriswamy (1977: 100) a station-master asks a former schoolmate to spend some ten days with him in the godforsaken place where he lives. The schoolmate remarks: «Why should I not spend ten days here? Rãma spent fourteen years in the forest». The station-master couters this ironic remarks by pointing out that it was in the forest that Rãma ac- quired some of his dearest friends. I) Šiva and his family. The most common and varied mythic similes and metaphors current in mo- dern Tamil literature refer to the great god Šiva (49 cases in my corpus). The phy- sical characteristic that has most struck people's fantasy is his third eye in the mid- st of his forehead (12 cases). In figurative speech Šiva roams around the burning ground, is unpredictable, a skilful trickster, takes possession of his devotees and grants them his divine vision. His kindness induces him to assume the form of a midwife (Tãyumãnavar). In fact, several similes and metaphors of this multiface- ted god refer to named aspects of his: Nllakanta, the swallower of poison, the co- smic dancer Natarãja who blissfully dances in his Kailãsa palace or in the golden hall of Chidambaram but who may also dance a dance of destruction. Šiva is furthermore remembered as the hermaphrodite Ardhanarlšvara, the teacher Daksinämürti, the moon-crested one (Candrašekhara) and the destroyer Sainhäramürti. Šiva' s consort PãrvatI appears in figurative speech in both her benevolent aspects, for instance as beautiful Ampãl, Kanyãkumãrl or Devi, and in her ter- rifying forms as Durgã and Kali. In her benevolent aspect as Mlnãksl her wedding to Šiva is a glorious affair. In her quality as Kali she wears a garland of skulls, roams around village boundaries and dances a dance of destruction. The divine couple's eldest son, known as Pillaiyãr, Ganapati, etc., sits immo- bile under a tree, is pot-bellied, joyful, an inveterate bachelor and a god of lear- ning who facilitates the latter by putting candy on his devotees' tongues. Thanks to his clever trick of walking around his father Šiva he managed to receive from him a prized mango. Pillaiyar's younger brother Murukan is described as an innocent child born in a reed pond, a handsome and heroic youth carrying a spear bestowed on him by his mother Šakti. He is also a bigamist who mischievously laughs when tricking the girl Valli, his future second wife, into his arms. 3 Names of pan-Indian deities and other things are transcribed from the Sanskirt form; purely Tamil terms are transcribed following the system adopted by the Madras University Tamil Lexicon.</page><page sequence="4">1 12 Gabriella Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi [4] Similes and metaphors do not forget Siva's steed, the bull Nandi pictured as proud, majestic as well as in his quality of guardian of Siva's palace and erotic play with ParvatT. II) Visnu, his wife, entourage and avatãras. In figurative speech Visnu carries the conch and the disc; hurling the latter produces a roar. He reclines on his serpent couch Ãdisesa in the milk sea and transforms himself into the enchantress MohinI with tinkling anklets. His wife Laksmï appears as earth goddess and goddess of fortune rising from the milk sea. The vulture Garuda, Visnu's steed, is remembered for his capacity of lifting heavy loads. The wise and frightening serpent king Ãdisesa has one thousand mouths. In similes and metaphors Visnu's second most important avatãra is Krsna. Krsna appears as a mischievous child, as playing with his foster father Nanda and surprising his fostermother Yasodã when she looks into his mouth (implicidy, be- cause she sees in it the whole world). Further characters connected with his child- hood used figuratively are his cruel uncle Kamsa, and the ugly demoness Pütanä. Episodes from his cowherd days in Vrindavan show him protectively raising Mt. Govardhana, joking and dancing the circle dance with the milk maids who wear jewellery and brightly coloured clothes. Krsna is also known as a proverbial Casa- nova because of his erotic sports with the gopis and as a bigamists because he married Rukminï and Satyabhãmã. Varãha, Visnu's boar avatãra, is remembered because of his snout and Parasurãma because he cut off his mother's head at his father's command. The man-lion avatãra Narasimha is pictured as bursting out of a pillar and killing the demon Hiranyakašipu. III) The Rãmãyana. The Rãmãyana inspires the greatest number of figurative expressions on mythic themes in modern Tamil literature (I found 103 instances excluding the si- de-stories) covering a sizable part of the epic. Although I shall discuss the figurati- ve uses of mythic themes in the second part of this paper, with regard to the Rãmãyana and the Mahãbhãrata an anticipation may be permitted. The knowledge of both epics is taken so much for granted that not knowing them stands for gross ignorance and slowness of wit in the sayings «after having heard the Rãmãyana for so long you still think that Rãma is Slta's uncle» (literally, her father's younger brother) (Marina 1974: 91), or «after having heard the Mahãbhãrata for so long you still think that Duryodhana is Draupadl's uncle» (li- terally, her father's elder brother; in reality he is her husband's cousin) (Marina 1987 a: 27).</page><page sequence="5">[5] Hindu mythology in Tamil figurative speech 113 In several similes and metaphors characters of the Rãmãyana are grouped pairwise: Rãma and Sita with their mutual love; Rãma and Laksmana, brothers and obedient sons; Dasaratha deriving his glory from his son Rãma; Kusa and La- va, Rãma and Sïtâ's playful children; Dasaratha and Kaikeyl who asks from him the terrible boon to exile Rãma; Bhãrata joyfully awaiting his half-brother's return and refusing to be crowned king in his stead; as well as the quarrelling monkey brothers Valin and Sugrlva. Rãma is praised for reviving Ahalyã as well as for his valour and chivalry in battle. He granted a respite to his adversary and only reluctantly killed the demo- ness Tãtakã piercing her breast with his arrow. In figurative speech Sita is praised for her beauty and devotion to her husband. She is ignorant of the world, likes to bathe in forest lakes and takes a fire bath to prove her innocence. After his master Rãma the monkey general Hanumãn, alias Añjaneya, is most prominent in comparisons. In these he recognizes Rãma whom he has never seen before and humbly bows before him. He assiduously searches for Sita and Rãvana, shows the signet ring to Sita, brings the sanjwi mountain with the life-re- storing herbs, rages and destroys the rãksas in battle. Other friends of Rãma men- tioned include the vulture Jatãyu that precipited to death when Rãvana cut its wings, the long-lived king of bears Jãmbavãn and the squirrel that helped the best it could to build the Adam's bridge and was gently stroked in gratitude by Rãma. Among Räma's enemies, in addition to the hunch-backed vengeful woman Küni and horrible-looking demoness Surpanakã there is above all her furious brother Rãvana who once dared touch Sïtâ's hair, which she miraculously cut. Fi- gurative speech also refers to Râvana's sleepy brother Kumbhakarna, to his stron- gly built messengers, the Kiňkaras, to the big-mouthed guardian demoness Lanki- ni and to Mãrlca who transformed himself into an illusionary gazelle. IV) The Mahãbhãrata. Although lagging far behind the Rãmãyana the Mahãbhãrata can still boast of a considerable number of figurative expressions in the Tamil language (sixty- six in my corpus). Predictably, Arjuna and Bhlma stand out among the fi- ve Pãndava brothers. Arjuna's archery, his amorous relations with the nymph Ur- vašl and his incognito period disguised as the eunuch Brhannalã are chosen for comparison. In similes and metaphors Bhlma leans on his club and wields it in battle. Yudhisthira's chariot does not touch the ground until he tells his first lie. Apart from Arjuna, the most prominent character of the Mahãbhãrata in figu- rative speech is Draupadl. She receives unending garments, laughs derisively and stands in fire. The strong Ghatotkaja, the skilful archer Ekalavya, the canniba- listic demon Bakãsura are minor figures of the epic used in expressive compari- sons.</page><page sequence="6">1 14 Gabriella Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi [6] Krsna is mentioned as blowing the conch shell. By eating a single grain of ri- ce he appeases the Durvãsas' hunger. Drona is recalled as the teacher cruelly attacked by his former students and cheated by Yudhisthira; Kunti as the mother of illegitimate children. Similes and metaphors stress the Kaurava brothers' riotous assembly, Duryodhana's role in the indecent scene with Draupadl and his, as well as Kama's «Achilles heels» consisting in the former's thigh and the latter's ear-ring. Dhrtarãstra, the Kauravas' father, is remembered as closing his eyes afraid to lose again the eyesight he has acquired or because he cannot bear the divine vision. The battle field of Kuruksetra, Bhïsma waiting on his bed of arrows for the beginning of the sacred part of the year ( uttarãyana ) and Aravãn, the sacrificial victim, are among further themes that have entered figurative speech. V) Minor deities, miscellaneous supernatural beings and objects. In addition to the great gods and the two great epics Tamil similes and me- taphors play on a host of minor deities, demons, sages, saints, other mythical or legendary persons and objects. Prominent in the first category is the king of gods Indra (of his wife Indrãnl I found only one mention), in whose heaven the wishing tree grows. In his assembly hall the celestial musicians ( tumburu ) play, the gandharvas sing and the beautiful apsaras dance delighting him and other mem- bers of the audience. Figurative speech recalls the god of love Manmatha with his sugarcane bow and wife Rati, the goddess of learning SarasvatI, the gods of ele- ments: Agni, Varuna and Vãyu, the god of wealth Kubera who possesses an aerial chariot and resides in his capital; the architect of the gods Maya, the divine physi- cians Ašvins, the sinister planetary deity Sani; the god of death Yama, his accoun- tant and the youth Naciketas who vexed the god with his questions. Sages include the troublesome Nãrada, the proud Vasistha, the furious Visvãmitra tempted by the nymph Menakã and Gautama, who unjustly won Ahalyã for wife. In addition to the raksasas known from the Rãmayana , similes and metaphors refer to Siva's demon followers, the ganas , to the buffalo demon Mahlsa, to Bhasmãsura whom Šiva granted a dangerous boon, to the astral demon Rãhu swallowing the moon, to Rãhu and Keta participating in the gods' feast as uninvi- ted guests, to the asuras Sunda and Upasunda who killed each other fighting for the beautiful Tilottamã, to asuras destroying the sages' sacrifice, to the demon Vétala who spitefully climbs up the drumstick tree over and over again and to the folklore demons with fiery mouths roaming around at the night. Among mythic devotees comparison is made to the pious demon Prahlãda, to Dhruva who was transferred to the sky as the polar star, to Kucela who became rich thanks to Krsna and to king Nahusa who temporarily obtained Indra's thro- ne.</page><page sequence="7">[7] Hindu mythology in Tamil figurative speech 115 The most popular Tamil village deity in figurative speech is goddess Mãriyamman. Goddess Pidãri is recalled for her furious shouts. Village godlings include Karuppan and Cañkilivlran rolling their big frightening eyes as well as moustached Maturaivlran and Kãttavarãyan. Also some local legendary themes are used for expressive comparisons, such as the furious Kannaki and the fire of Madurai, Maniměkalai doing austerities in prison, the generous Pari who broke his chariot to prop up a creeper, king Manu- niti who killed his son for having accidentally overrun a calf as well as the suffe- ring women Nallãyini and Nallattahkãl. Similes and metaphors refer to the Šaiva saints N antan, Kannappan and Cuntaramürtti as well as to the Vaisnava saints Ãntãl and Tirumankaiyãlvãr. The pan-Indian legendary king Vikramãditya is re- membered for his difficulty in climbing the steps of the throne he discovered and for his habit of dividing his time between his capital and the forest. Themes from temple legends such as statues coming to life, bowing or kicking the sculptor, also have found their way into figurative speech. Mythic animals chosen for comparison include the heavenly cow Kãmadhenu and her calf Surabhl, the cruel serpent Karkota and Sarvabhauma, the male elephant sustaining the world in the northern region. There are also several birds, such as the cãtaka bird living on dew, the Indian love-bird cakravaka and the hy- perdelicate asumananmã. Plants comprise Krsna's holy tulasi plant, the ketaki flower finally forgiven by Šiva for its false witness and the rain of flowers the gods send as a blessing. Geographical features and objects include the seven continents of the earth, the chtonic world of nãgas, Mt. Meru and Mt. Mandara, the pestle destroying the Yãdava tribe, the soma drink of the gods as well as nectar and poison churned out from the primeval milk sea. Karma and rebirth, the cycle of yugas and pralaya , the deluge at the end of each cycle, have all become enshrined in the figurative Tamil language. B) figurative Uses of Hindu Mythology. Mythic themes may be used in figurative speech to render a description more vivid and memorable. In Rajam Krishnan's words (1978: 60), for instance, an earthquake «makes pots and pans tumble as if they were beating the rhythm to Kali's dance». Kalpana (1971: 117) compares the clear morning sky to the Hima- layan reed pond saravana , which her readers know is the birthplace of god Murukan. Even in such descriptive uses of mythic themes a value judgement is usually involved, such as beauty and calmness expressed through the lacustrine image. In fact, the most common figurative use of Hindu mythology both in idio- matic and novel comparisons consists in stressing some positive or negative value or else in picturing an emotion.</page><page sequence="8">116 Gabriella Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi [8] In the following I shall divide mythic themes occurring in similes and me- taphors into those that are predominantly or uniquely used to express one mea- ning and those that function as synonyms. A second classification adopted distin- guishes different meanings given to one and the same mythic theme suggested by the myths themselves from different meanings that seem to have been invented by popular fantasy or by a writer's creative imagination. I) Dominant or unique figurative meanings of mythic themes. Some mythic themes have acquired a standard figurative meaning to such an extent that they have hardly any mythic or non-mythic alternative. In praising a person past his prime for his surprisingly youthful appearance reference to sage Mãrkandeya is proverbial. Shankaranarayanan (1985: 109), for instance, calls a youthful father a «descendant of Mãrkandeya». Thanks to his devotion to Šiva, one must know, the youth Mãrkandeya was not only saved from predestined death, but was granted the boon of remaining sixteen years old for ever. This age marks the prime of youth according to a pan-Indian tradition. Even Tamil Chri- stians, who are not always as well versed in Hindu mythology as their Hindu countrymen, I have heard employ this mythic image. Long life without concomi- tant youthfulness may be expressed by reference to Räma's friend Jãmbavãn, a long-lived bear. The editor of one of Ramamirtham's books (Tirunavukkarasu 1989: i), for instance, calls his author «a Jãmbavãn among writers». While modern Westerners try to discover ways and means to obtain what they want making the least effort, the Indian yogic tradition glorifies great effort both physical and mental. A saying occurring repeatedly in modern Tamil literatu- re (for example Putamaippittan 1978: 27) calls persistent almost superhuman stri- ving «Bhaglratha's effort». Reference is to the devout mythic king Bhaglratha who by propitiating Šiva succeeded in making the heavenly Ganges descend to earth. Kubera is the Indian Cresus. Like his Greek counterpart he proverbially stands for a wealthy man. In negative terms «plundering Kubera's capital» (Mari- na 1978: 100) means squandering a large sum of money. Any Hindu deity may be worshipped for spiritual and material benefits, the latter including desire for wealth. Visnu's wife LaksmI, however, is the dispenser of wealth and other good fortune par exellence. A penniless writer Jeyakanthan (1975f: 47) describes as saying «LaksmI Devi is my stepmother but SarasvatI is my solemnly wed wife». In the Mahãbhãrata the Pãndava Yudisthira, also known as Dharmaputra (the son of right conduct), did not abide by truth throughout his life. Consequently, not he but Harišcandra is the epitome of truthfulness in Hindu mythology. A hu- sband reproaches his wife for not being able to light the fire with damp firewood, while Candramati (Hariscandra's wife) is said to have lit the fire with green bana- na leaves (reference is to Candramati's period of trial as a servant maid). Knowing</page><page sequence="9">[9] Hindu mythology in Tamil figurative speech 117 her husband's moral shortcomings the wife replies «since you are no Harišcandra I need not be Candramati» (Parthasarathy 1976: 118). As we have seen above, many positive and negative characters and events of the Mahãbhãrata have entered figurative speech. Complessively, however, the ne- gative image of the epic seems to be foremost in people's minds. Using an idioma- tic expression Ramamirtham (1975: 176) speaks of a person seriously ill as suffe- ring the Mahãbhãrata. Tamil parents try to inculcate into their children the habit of getting up befo- re sunrise. Too great a disposition to sleep is considered a moral fault and fre- quenty criticized by reference to Rävana's brother. A matron displeased with a young mother reproaches her saying «mothers must not sleep like a Kumbhakarni» (she uses a female derivative of the sleepy demon's name) (Marina 1981*: 18). ' Since rsi Nãrada is the proverbial trouble maker of Hindu mythology «Nãra- da's work» stands for an attempt to sow discord (Marina 1978: 153). II) Mythic themes as figurative synonyms. Much more common than mythic themes possessing a unique or predomi- nant figurative meaning are mythic themes treated as figurative synonyms. This is not surprising given the richness of Hindu mythology that has many more charac- ters, situations and events than there are emotions and values that may be expres- sed through comparison with it. 1. Positive figurative meanings. Whereas Greek mythology provides Westerners with only one standard me- taphor for a beautiful woman: Venus (Helen's beauty has not become proverbial), Hindu mythology possesses a long list of celestial nymphs suche as Rambhã (Vriddhachalam 1971: 200) or UrvasI (Ramamirtham 1988: 71) and beautiful god- desses who may be used in flattering comparisons. Ramamirtham himself acknow- ledges the existence of mythic synonyms when he compares the extraordinary beauty of one of his heroines to several goddesses at a time: Kanyãkumãrl, DãksayanT, Tatatakai (Mïnâksî) - all benevolent forms of the Šaiva goddess - as well as to Draupadl (1988: 77). Just as the Babylonian Adonis and the Greek Apollon are alternative me- taphors for handsome males in Western languages so are the pan-Indian god of love Manmatha and the youthful Tamil god Murukan in Tamil. In Hindu mytho- logy, however, also other male characters are known for their good looks. A pair of well-fed bulls with shining skin is compared to Rãma and Laksmana because of their similar beauty and collaboration (Muthanandam) 1984: 40). Also for extraordinary or superhuman strenght Hindu mythology can boast</page><page sequence="10">118 Gabriella Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi [ 1 0] of several characters who may be used as figurative synonyms. In addition to Bhlma, often called the Indian Hercules, Hanumãn is a proverbial strongman (Ra- mamirtham 1981: 4). Bhlma' s son Ghatotkaja and Rãvanas messengers, the Kinka- ras, are also endowed with admirable strenght (Ramamirtham 1984: 30, 290). Many mythic characters are skilful archers but Rãma and Ekalavya are sin- gled out in figurative speech. The cross-cultural metaphor4 of shooting arrows for asking pointed questions may be expressed in Tamil by reference to Rama's ar- rows (Kalki 1976: 26). The unfailing aim of Ekalavya's arrows provides a perti- nent simile for the kicks and blows a policeman directs at a hated youth sparing no part of his body (Ramamirtham 1990: 88). Sltã, SãvitrI, Anasuyã and ArundhatI are all models of wifely devotion and faithfulness in figurative speech. «Where Rãma is Ayodhyã is for Sita» a Tamil saying goes. It recalls the fact that Sita voluntarily renounced the luxury of the royal palace in Ayodhyã to share her husband's forest exile. The saying may be used as a strong hint to a wife that she should be equally submissive (Marina 1974: 99). SãvitrI, whose devotion persuaded the god of death to revive her hu- sband Satyavãn, resembles the Greek Alcestis, but the latter has not become a standard metaphor in Western languages. In Bharanidharan's words (1974: 226)5 Kasturbai (Gandhi's wife) fought with the god of death for her husband's life like SãvitrI. In Western parlance Romeo and Juliet are the proverbial lovers; Hindu mythology comprises several proverbial loving couples like Rãma and Sltã, Gandra and Rohini (the moon and his favourite wife, the Aldebaran star), Sakuntalã and Dusyanta, DamayantI and Nalan, etc., who may all be employed in exemplary comparisons to human lovers (for example Parthasarathy 1978: 124). The most frequent positive use of mythic themes in figurative speech, howe- ver, is to express not only erotic love but joy and happiness in any form including love between the sexes. More than two dozen mythic images in my corpus serve this purpose. In Rajamayyar's novel The Life Story of Kamalãmpãl (1972: 153, 156), written at the end of the last century, the young wife writes to her husband that on seeing him again she will be as happy as Nantan (an untouchable Šaiva saint) who obtained the vision of god Šiva. A little later the couple is reunited and lives happily like the fabulous cakravãka bird and its mate. In a story by Rajana- rayanan (1984¿z: 89) even Hanumãn bringing the sanjwi mountain could not have been happier than his character who managed to find a jackfruit for which his pregnant wife craved. In order to describe the joy of a barren woman who hears 4 By cross-cultural I mean cropping up in widely different cultures, hence probably not due to diffusion. A cross-cultural fact need not be present in all cultures, it need not be universal. 5 Bharanidharan and Marina are two pseudonyms of the same Tamil author when writing serious works and comedies respectively.</page><page sequence="11">[11] Hindu mythology in Tamil figurative speech 119 an unknown child call her 'mother' Jeyakanthan (1975¿: 45) piles up similes, most of which have a mythic content. For instance, she felt like having been released from a curse and as if the kali yuga had come to an end. 2. Negative figurative meanings. Just as beauty is a greater asset for women than for men so ugliness is a grea- ter misfortune for women than for men. Demons and devils provide favourite objects of comparison to ugly males and females. Sundaram (1983: 81) ironically speaks of a fat bejewelled woman as combining the beauty of Šurphanaka (Rävana's horrible sister mutilated by Laksmana) and Tãtakã (a demoness killed by Rãma). Like ugliness, a person's greed for food and money is preferably expressed by comparison to demons; for instance, to the cannibalistic Bakãsura (Marina 1981¿: 6) and to Kundodara, a gluttonous round-bellied goblin in Siva's host. A character in a novel by Rajam Krishnan (1969: 46) claims to have the hunger of Kuntodara: he could swallow table, chairs and all. Hindu gods and other mythical heroes are not averse to cheat. So there is an embarras de choix when wanting to stress this disreputable habit in humans. Invei- ghing against lawyers one of Rajamayyar's (1972: 21) characters states that they «are more skilful than Šiva in transforming falsehood into truth, truth into fal- sehood, jackals into horses and horses into jackals»6. Reference is to a foul trick Šiva played on his devotee Mãnikkavãcakar and the king in The sixty-four sports of Šiva , the temple legend of Mïnâksï temple in Madurai. «Asvatthãma, the elephant» (Ramamirtham 1978¿z: 125) also stands for outrageous falsehood. By pronouncing 'the elephant' in this sentence in a lower voice that did not reach Drona, Yudhisthira made him believe that his son Asvatthãma and not the elephant by the same name had been killed. The so-far truthful Pãndava thus managed to de- prive the invincible archer of his fighting spirit. For illusion, so important in Indian thought, Hindu mythology provides two standard comparisons: Indra's magic (Vedanayaham 1984: 215) and the illusio- nary gazelle Mârïca whom Rävana sent to be able to abduct Sita (Akilan 1976¿z: 24). While Laksmï is the prototypical dispenser of good fortune in actual belief as well as in similes and metaphors, misfortune is vested in more than one mythic fi- gure. Competitors for this dubious fame may be considered Laksml's elder sister Mütevi (Bhanumati 1984: 15) and the sinister planetary god Sani (Saturn). Noti- cing that he sold little one day, the owner of a restaurant grumbles to himself: 6 The richness of the Tamil language permits to express the contrast between jackal {nari) and horse {pari) through a rhyme.</page><page sequence="12">120 Gabriella Eichinger F erro-Luzzi [12] «How could business be good when this inauspicious person like Sani sat at my entrance door?» (Alagiriswamy 1977: 21). The dejection of a person whose whole family has died from cholera Putu- maippittan stresses by comparison to king Nahusa who lost again Indra's throne, which he had obtained after having performed many horse sacrifices (1978: 156). Dejection of a somewhat less severe form is expressed by reference to sage Aga- stya who was sent to South India during Mïnâksï's wedding (Ramamirtham 1966: 167-168). The sage was dispatched there to stabilize the subcontinent whose wei- ght had been upset after the whole South Indian population flocked to Šivas Hi- malayan palace in order to see his wedding to MlnaksI. Since the wedding is the most beautiful and elaborate ceremony in the life of a human being, let alone a god, one can imagine Agastya's state of mind when Šiva obliged him to renounce attending it. Hindu mythology contains several arrogant characters, apt metaphors or si- miles for humans with this moral defect. To think that one is Brhaspati (the pre- ceptor of the gods) proverbially denotes a conceited person (Marina 1978: 46). Alternatively, a conceited person who claims to be able to do anything may pro- mise to «bring tiger's milk» (Janakiraman 1978: 128). This seemingly impossible task was, however, accomplished by a prince, the future god Aiyappan. Fury, just as pride, is one of the defects which the Hindu ascetic and ordi- nary man are supposed to correct but find hardest to eradicate. «A rsi s fury» is a Tamil idiom. Elaborating it Jayapprakasam (1975: 122) compares a person's rage to the fury of a holy man whose deep meditation has been disturbed. (As every- body, knows, this fury likely makes him hurl a disasterous curse at the culprit). Apart from attributing fury to rsis in general, figurative, expressions refer to seve- ral specific mythic cholerics such as Visvãmitra (Janakiraman 1967: 104) and Durvâsas. A wife, for instance, calls her angry husband a «true descendant of Durvãsas» (Marina 1974: 97). Fury with its terrifying, violent and destructive con- notations is an emotion vested in more than two dozen mythic characters in my corpus. One wonders whether the Hindu emphasis on the subjugation of pas- sions, including the passion of fury, is not the consequence of people's more than average proneness to them. Demons are held to be born cholerics. Their similar character may induce even the individual writer to employ them as figurative sy- nonyms. Kalki (1976: 20), for instance, compares a terribly enraged person simul- taneously to Hiranyakašipu, Rãvana and Sürapadma, three demons sworn ene- mies of Visnu, Rãma and Murukan respectively. According to a Hindu belief, all women have something of the demonic, the passagge from gentle to fierce comes natural to them. Consequently, Kali or Bha- drakãll is a favourite metaphor for enraged women (Kalpana 1971: 50; Akilan 1977: 92; Madhavan 1915b: 188). Putumaippittan (1973: 14) in one of his stories compares the fury of one mythic heroine to that of another. When Ahalyã hears</page><page sequence="13">[13] Hindu mythology in Tamil figurative speech 121 that Rãma had asked his wife Šita to undergo the fire ordeal «in her mind dances the fury of Kannaki». Despite the Hindus' avowed aim to reach self-perfection by subduing fury and other passions Hindu mythology also contains cases in which fury is justified and even admired. Kannaki's fury that made her burn Madurai, one must know, was righteous (if one accepts the premise of collective responsibility) since her hu- sband had been unjustly put to death. Also Narasimha's fury directed at the de- mon Hiranyakašipu is implicitly justified (Ramamirtham 1987: 97). To attribute fury to elements such as fire is a cross-cultural metaphor, but Hindu mythology offers also a culture-specific7 version of this association of ideas. An authoritative father whom his son dares contradict - an action normally disapproved of by so- ciety - becomes terribly furious like the fire destroying the universe at the end of each cycle oí yugas ( kala akkini) (Vedanayaham 1984: 140). III) Different figurative uses of one and the same mythic theme. 1. Different meanings derived from mythology itself. Given the complexity of some mythic characters and the vicissitudes of their lives it is not surprising that different aspects of these may be chosen for compari- son. Thus Akilan (1976 b' 106), for instance, makes Hanumãn a simile for a person easily enraged and Ramamirtham (1986: 148) a metaphor for his dear friend, taking care, however, to point out that he himself does not consider himself Rãma. Remembering the happy period he spent with this now deceased friend he calls it his Cuntara Kãntam , the section of the Rãmãyana in which Hanumãn is the prota- gonist. Despite all its merits the same epic is also a somewhat disparaging idiom for a great quarrel (Dharman 1984: 53). Since the vulture Jatãyu died when endeavouring to rescue Sita, Rajanaraya- nan's story (1984¿z: 189) about a helpful man mutilated and killed when trying to rescue a woman from her rapists is pertinently entitled Jatãyu. However, since a vulture's beak makes one think of a curved nose, a Jatãyu nose may stand for the Western 'aquiline' nose (Ramamirtham 1966: 191). Närada's dominant figurative meaning of trouble maker, as we have seen, may at times be disregarded. One of Madhavan's characters dreams of travelling through the sky like Nãrada (1975¿z: 35). Sage Vasistha has to be added to the proverbial figurative expressions for an arrogant person (Janakiraman 1978: 173). He had no qualms to flout the age-old social rule that one acquires one's varna by birth and nominated the non-Brahmin Visvãmitra Brahmin rsi. Naturally this fil- 7 By culture-specific I mean occurring in one culture only or being particularly developed there.</page><page sequence="14">122 Gabriella Eichinger F erro-Luzzi [14] led the latter with great joy. A further Tamil idiom about the sage picks out this positive effect of his arrogance. For instance, being praised by a sister-in-law is so rare and joyous like having been nominated Brahmin rsi by Vasistha (Marina 1977: 114). The serpent king Ãdisesa is above all a simile for frightening things like the howling wind (Rajamayyar 1972: 212), but the wisdom ascribed to serpents - a cross-cultural folklore motif - is not forgotten in figurative speech. In a backward Tamil village the one who has learnt to read a little (literally four letters) is consi- dered like Ãdisesa (Ramamirtham 1972: 127). Probably because of the high value attributed to milk in Indian culture the milk sea is above all a positive mythic image, which may substitute for the cross- cultural metaphor 'sea of happiness'. In Parthasarathy's words (1974: 57) a devo- tional song sung at the sea shore seems to transform the salty sea into a new milk sea. The churning of the milk sea, however, produced both nectar and poison. Hence the milk sea may metaphorically stand for the joys and sorrows of family li- fe (Ramamirtham 1966: 106). Since the Hindu pantheon contains a god of death called Yama or Kãlan the abstract concept death is frequently personified by reference to him. Naturally, he inspires fear and despair. Seeing a menacing stick raised in front of itself a crow thinks that Yama has «torn up its card», i.e. it will die the next moment (Chuda- mani 1986: 11). But in Hindu mythology the god of death is not all powerful; he may at times be defeated. Following this line of thought a houseowner is said to ha- ve a voice making Yama tremble (Cavi 1979: 115). A person in exceptionally good health has a pulse strong enough to kick away Yama (Janakiraman 1978: 139). In Rajamayyar's words (1972: 96) when the wind caused sparks to fly from a burning haystack «it looked as if it wanted to make the whole village a sacrificial offering to god Agni». In this simile the god of fire appears in his primary destruc- tive form. However, fire may also be seen as a thing of beauty. A guru sitting on a tigerskin when teaching emits such brilliants light «as if he were god Agni» (J a- nakiraman 1967: 104). Choosing the same characteristic, a lightning that brigh- tens a dark room Ramamirtham (1970: 20) compares to god Agni who rising from a sacrificial firepit carries a silver vessel in his hand. 2. Creative interpretations of mythic themes. The distinction between creative interpretations of mythic themes and their different meanings derived from the myths themselves should not be taken cate- gorically. Despite their mythic backing there was room for creativity also in the different figurative expressions mentioned in the preceding subchapter, in the choice of less idiomatic sides of a character or situation and, above all, in the subjects of comparison (Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi 1992 b). Although god Agni rising from the firepit is a well-known mythic image, Ramamirtham's use of it is un-</page><page sequence="15">[15] Hindu mythology in Tamil figurative speech 123 doubtedly creative. In the following instances mythic themes are given figurative meanings not suggested by the myths themselves in the strict sense of the term. Not only scholars also ordinary Tamil speakers and writers sometimes inter- pret a mythic theme subjectively. Ramamirtham states that poetic licence gives him the right to reinterpret mythic themes. He does so implicitly several times, but in the foreword of his novel Apita (1971:/) he explicitly explains such a rein- terpretation. Apitã, one of Parvatl's epithets, refers to the fact that the goddess has not suckled her children. (Murukan was breast-fed by the Krttikã sisters and Ganeša was created beyond the breast-feeding age). The author, however, gives his heroine's name Apitã the meaning «untouched, impossible to be touched». In the case of the Great Dipper Ramamirtham abides by given mythic mea- nings. In Sanskrit mythology the constellation is conceived as a group of seven rsis but in a folk tradition also as a plough. Combining the two images he stresses tur- bulent thought through the metaphor of seven rsis ploughing the heart (1978¿: 96). Alagiriswamy, however, chooses the fact that the constellation is composed of seven stars for his personal association of ideas. He compares a group of seven friends to the Great Dipper. «If one star [a little boy] were missing the others could not bear it» he writes (1977: 23). The mythic Indian king Trišaňku remained suspended between heaven and earth. This not very enviable position Komakal (1972: 23) makes an apt simile for a person's unpleasant sorrowful state of mind. Dilip Kumar (1985: 24), however, disregarding the fact that Trisanku's position did not depend on himself calls in- decision «Trisañku's state of mind». Following the universal mental association between positive and high (un- marked in linguistic terminology), the positive value of truth may be metaphori- cally equated with 'up'. In the Mahãbhãrata , as long as Yudhisthira abides by truth his chariot does not touch the ground. Similes may use this image in the sen- se of truth as opposed to falsehood (Ramamirtham 1987: 33). In Tamil as in We- stern languages, however, idealism and ecstacy also tend to be associated with the upward direction, for instance in the metaphor 'flight of fantasy'. Following this line of thought Ramamirtham compares the idealistic period of his youth when he used to converse with like-minded friends to «the ecstatic days when our chariot did not touch the ground» (1981: 4). A common form of reinterpreting a mythic theme consists in changing its character from positive to negative or vice versa or else in using it in a comic sen- se. Self-born (Ta t anton ri, Skr. svayambhü) is a very positive concept when ap- plied to a lingam or an anthropomorphic idol. Such idols are considered more va- luable and powerful than similar ones sculptured by human hands8. In Tamil po- 8 The Selfe-milking Cow and the Bleeding Lihgam (Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi 1987) deals mostly with self-born idols.</page><page sequence="16">124 Gabriella Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi [ 1 6] pular parlance, however, self-born is not necessarily a positive epithet. A person unconcerned about others may be called tantonri (Janakiraman 1972: 84). According to Rajagopalachari (1968: 281), author of an English version of the Mahãbhãrata , Ghatotkaja who gave his life for the Pãndavas on the battle field, is one of the most positive characters of the epic. Bharati, however, makes his Ghatotkaja of the kali yuga (198: 105-113) an uncouth somewhat ludicrous sim- pleton. Visnu's man-lion avatãra naturally inspires similes of horror, as in a story by Jeyakanthan. A man believed to be dead acquires consciousness on the funeral py- re and emerges from it «like Narasimha bursting from a pillar to tear out Hiranyakasipu's heart» (1975¿/: 59). Another time the same author disregards the sinister associations of the mythic theme keeping in mind only the image of emer- gence. In a vision his protagonist sees the earth burst open and a beautiful child emerge «like Narasimha bursting open the pillar (1975¿: 97). Bhanumati reinter- prets the terrifying theme in a comic sense. Her very orthodox mother-in-law, she tells, used to eat with her face turned towards the wall. Nobody but Narasimha splitting open the wall would have been able to know what ritually pure food she ate (1984: 5). In the Rãmãyana the vengeful hunch-backed woman Küni and the lustful de- moness Šůrphanaka are decidedly negative characters, but Rajamayyar finds a po- sitive side in them. Tongue-in-cheek he tells his readers that his story could not be written without his negative heroine Cuppu just as there could be no Rãmãyana without the excellent women Küni and Sürphanakä. Therefore they have to accept Cuppu just as gods and rsis pay homage to Küni and Sürphanakä 1972: 22). A Hindu god showing his devotee his grandiose cosmic form ( visvarüpa ) tends to fill him with awe and ecstacy. In figurative speech visvarüpa may be used for majestic tallness (Rajanaryanan 1990: 29). Another time Rajanarayanan uses the concept in the sense of expansion. A husband whose wife suddenly relieves him from the financial straights that had crushed his energy seems to rise «like Hanumãn showing his cosmic form» (Rajanarayanan 1989: 68). If, however, Bha- numati (1984: 21) writes that a dish of cooked bananas began to show its višvampa - it now had to be eaten despite all the schemings to avoid it - the in- congruous overstatement makes the mythic theme decidedly funny. The curse is a mainstay of Hindu mythology. Both in real life and modern Tamil literature people firmly believe in the disastrous effect of curses. Being libe- rated from a curse, therefore, may be a simile for great joy, as we have seen above (p. 119). In Ramamirtham's words (1961: 165) the torn pieces of a photograph turn up again and again like an unrelenting curse. Since these pieces remind the narrator of his unhappy marriage the simile is serious despite the disproportion between the subject and object of comparison. In one of Marina's comedies, how-</page><page sequence="17">[17] Hindu mythology in Tamil figurative speech 125 ever (1977: 19) the wife jokingly asks whether husbands have not been cursed not to listen to what their wives say, even if it is true. In Hindu mythology Šiva's fiery third eye at the centre of his forehead has a menacing destructive connotation. In one of Putumaippittan's bitter stories (1962: 53) it is an appropriate simile for the headlight of a train that presages death: the next moment this train overruns the three main characters. However, if Bhagyam Ramaswamy starts one of the episodes in the life of his grandfather hero saying that he «was is urgent need of a third eye» (1977: 36), the mythic theme is a comic overstatement. The old man does not attempt at anybody's life, he would simply like to abolish the signboard his wife has put on his door. The Pãndava Bhlma is a majestic figure known for his strength. The strongest lad in a novel by Rajanarayanan (1990: 20) is said to think himself Bhlma. Howev- er, when Jeyakanthan (1975¿z: 155) compares an ant placing its front legs on a clod of mud its head raised up to Bhlma leaning on his club, his readers cannot but smile. Discussion. The first striking fact revealed by the study of Hindu mythology that has be- come part of the Tamil language is the enormous number and variety of mythic themes used in similes and metaphors. Which of the myriads of such themes will be employed in figurative speech depends on many contingent facts and is the- refore strictly unpredictable. In some cases, however, the fascination exerted by a particular theme might ( post hoc) stand to reason either because it is a cross-cultu- ral folklore motif following a «highway of thought»9 or because it is an idea uni- quely developed in Indian culture. An instance of the former case is Siva's third eye. It repeatedly appears in similes and metaphors probably because it is so- mehow salient to the mind, as confirmed by the fact that it belongs to cross-cultu- ral fantasies about an abnormal number of eyes: one, three or a great round num- ber. For instance, the Greek Polyphemus has one eye, god Tani of the Ramos (a NEFA tribe), has three eyes like Šiva, but his third eye is at his back (Dhasmana 1979: 236), Argus has one hundred eyes and Indra has a thousand. A rsì s fury, on the other hand, appears frequently in standard and novel figurative expressions probably because fury is more common in Hindu mythology than in that of other communities. Similes and metaphors derived from Greek and Roman mythologies seem to have entered European language thanks to writers and other intellectuals admi- ring ancient Greek and Roman cultures. Unlike these figurative reflections of 9 By 'highway of thought' I mean a mental proclivity which does not demonstrably depend on any internal or external constraint, just as nobody obliges travellers to use a highway but many do so spontaneously.</page><page sequence="18">126 Gabriella Eichinger F erro-Luzzi [18] dead religions, mythic themes in the Tamil languages are part of a living religion. It therefore might be assumed that myths about gods with the greatest number of worshippers inspire the greatest number of figurative expressions. This is only partly so. Šaivism being more widespread than Vaisnavism in Tamilnadu, Šiva and his family members indeed offer more frequent comparisons than Visnu and his avatãras except Krsna and Rãma. Among Visnu's avatãras Krsna is the best lo- ved and most worshipped deity in Tamilnadu, a fact reflected in the relative im- portance of scenes from his life story in Tamil figurative speech. However, Rãma has no temple in the whole of Tamilnadu, to my knowledge. The domestic cele- bration of his birthday (. Rãmanavami) is little in evidence and restricted almost only to Brahmins (Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi 1978: 101). The prominence of his name in figurative speech owes, of course, to people's love for the Rãmãyana in Vâlmîki's and above all in Kampan's versions. However, not all characters of Hindu mythology conspicuous in figurative speech have the backing of widespread worship or great literature. Among minor gods Indra is second only to Yama (twelve and twenty-three mentions respectively in my corpus). Indra was the god presiding over the fertile agricultural region (, marutam ) of the cahkam period, the earliest stratum of Tamil poetry written in the first part of the first millennium of the Christian era. Judging from the Lay of the Anklet (Ilarikõ Atikal I. 5) Indra's festival was then celebrated with great pomp. Now, however, Indra has been totally eclipsed by Šaiva and Vaisnava dei- ties and his festival has long been discontinued. Indra is mentioned in the Rãmãyana but most events of his life story are told in Sanskrit texts not well- known to the wider Tamil public. His relative importance in the figurative speech of modern Tamils, therefore, may be somewhat unexpected. Rather than the one thousand yonis on his body (the result of a curse) his one thousand eyes (the re- sult of a mitigated curse) are well remembered. The rhythmical Tamil saying «one would need ten million eyes to see it» {kãna kan kõti věntum ) (Jeyakanthan 1976: 66), said of a particularly beautiful sight, probably is a multiform of «one would need Indra's one thousand eyes to see it» (Chudamani 1986: 37) by increasing the latter's eyes still further for alliterative purposes. Similes and metaphors also like to play on the beauty of Indra's heaven (Sundara Ramaswamy 1977: 46). In figu- rative speech a person may be proud as if he were nominated king of gods ( Veda- nay aham 1984: 185) despite the fact that in myth and ritual many gods are more powerful than Indra. Religious -philosophical concepts like the theory of the four yugas, karma and rebirth run throughout Hindu mythology. However, such religious -philosophical concepts are rarely used for figurative purposes. In the preceding paragraphs we have met two references to the kali yuga (pp. 119, 124). Jeyakanthan speaks of a dog following his master like his deeds in previous lives (1975¿/: 74). One of Putu- maippittan's characters remains connected with his birthplace like the memory of</page><page sequence="19">[19] Hindu mythology in Tamil figurative speech 127 his previous life (1978: 160). Perhaps the most original comparison to a religious- philosophical theme has been devised by Janakiraman (1975: 96). Looking at the coconut and mango treees in her backyard reflected in the windows in front and behind her a woman is reminded of the chain of life. Rajamayyar quotes an advai- ta view of liberation saying that «in the end we shall merge with god like the wa- ves merge with the sea» (1984: 163). The well-known metaphor of the rope-snake for Sarikara's contention that the phenomenal word is an illusion Putumaippittan uses as title of a philosophical story on the illusionary or mind-dependent nature of time (1973: 20-27). The complessively scant use of such themse in figurative speech is not surpri- sing, since many of these are collective creations. Ordinary people, in particular il- literate people, are more interested in colourful characters and events than in phi- losophical speculations. Even people ignorant of Sañkara's philosophy, however, know his legendary life story. Therefore Jeyakanthan (1978¿: 67) is able to employ a simile playing on the religious philosopher's special relationship to his mother. A son wanting to leave his mother in search of work assures her that he will return when she needs him like Ãdisankara. Šaňkara who left his mother to become a world renouncer is said to have known by a sixth sense when she was lying on her deathbed. He hastened back to her in time to see her and perform her funeral ri- tes. Also scholarly views of mythic themes do not necessarily coincide with popu- lar interest in them as apparent in figurative language. The Sanskrit term sesa meaning remainder is responsible for the name of the mythical serpent king Ädisesa (the original remainder). In philosophical religious texts the serpent is the remainder of the sacrifice from which new life arises (Shulman 1978: 115-116); an idea undoubtedly inspired by the serpent's habit of sloughing its skin. In similes and metaphors I have not found philosophical ideas of rebirth and cyclical world view with regard to Ädisesa; in these he is frightening or wise, apart from acting as Visnu's couch. Draupadl's garments have been given symbolic interpretations of regeneration and fertility (Hiltebeitel 1980: 97-112). In similes their concrete length has struck the imagination. Much has been written on the philosophical message of the Mahãbhãrata. Rajagopalachari (1968: 206) calls the epic «a gospel of devotion to duty without attachment or desire of reward». For the ordinary Ta- mil, however, the battle at Kureksetra is carnage and the Mahãbhãrata an idioma- tic metaphor for great suffering. The androgyn and the eunuch have given rise to many, sometimes conflicting learned interpretations. Scholars with psychoanalytical leanings may see in the former «the male need of and fear of the female» (O'Flaherty 1980: 331). In one of the few philosphical considerations expressed through a mythic image the pro- tagonist of one of Ramamirtham's stories reflects on the relationship between body and mind and their male or female character. He concludes that the mind is</page><page sequence="20">128 Gabriella Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi [20] Ardhanarlšvara, both male and female (1989 b: 135). In figurative speech the eunuch or transvestite Brhannalã (Arjuna in female disguise) and Sikhandl (who changed from female to male) have nothing of the esoteric. In Janakiraman's mind (1976: 139) these characters are similes for a husband who does not seem to noti- ce his wife's adultery or does not care to be cuckolded. Writers and ordinary peo- ple employing mythic figures of speech know well that one does not compare a thing to itself. They never make the error - common among members of the «dee- per meaning school of thought» - to hold that a simile or metaphor might reveal a deeper meaning. Mythic themes entered the Tamil language because people knew and liked them. Once this has happened, either in idiomatic or more novel figurative ex- pressions, these themes perform a mnemonic function: they help to keep alive myths that might otherwise fall into oblivion. Some sayings on non-mythic themes like the Brahmin clasping a bear or the 'meals Rama' {cãppã ttu raman who has nothing to do with the mythic Rãma) seem to be abridged folk stories. Similarly, similes and metaphors on mythic themes may be considered succinct renderings of the myths in question. In the first part of this paper I have stressed that the figurative uses of myths take their knowledge for granted, but detailed knowledge is not equally important for all such uses. If a beautiful woman is said to be like UrvasI, even the reader who knows nothing about the celestial nymph still understands that the simile is a compliment. More solid knowledge is needed to understand metaphoric titles such as Entering Fire or Aravãn. If one wants to get an inkling of what the story might be about. Jeyakanthan's Entering Fire (197 5 g: 123-151) alludes to the ritual purification through fire of mythical heroines. In the modern story a girl is ritually purified from the stain of rape, wisely by water, not fire. Aravãn, in a Tamil folk version of the Mahãbhãrata , is Arjuna's son sacrified to assure the Pãndavas' vic- tory. Ramamirtham (1957: 95-108) applies the mythic metaphor to a baby sacrifi- ced, i.e. left to die of hunger, for it's father's sake. The most solid knowledge seems to be required for comic, in particular ironic10, uses of mythic themes. The admittedly rare Tamil reader who did not know the property of Siva's third eye would not be able to grasp the full comic quality of Bhagyam Ramaswamy's grandfather hero in urgent need of Siva's third eye. The plethora of mythic similes and metaphors in the Tamil language is apt to correct one scholarly view of the relationship between a metaphor and its refe- rent. «No metaphor, it has been claimed, can ever be comprehended, or even ade- quately represented independent of its experiential basis» (Lakoff and Johnson 1980: 19). Tamil rhetoricians have long known that this is not necessarily so. They 10 Or irony, in particular the overlap between the concepts of irony and humour, see Eichinger Ferro-Luzzi 1992c: 16-17.</page><page sequence="21">[21] Hindu mythology in Tamil figurative speech 129 created the concept il porul uvamai (comparison to a non-existing thing) such as Tiruvalluvar's (28.3) «cow clothed in a tiger skin» as a simile for a weak person pretending to be strong. Hindu believers would not call their mythic themes il po- rul (non-existing) but they can also not strictly speaking experience them. Making an abstract concept or even a concrete thing more salient by comparing it to a myth fits well with the advaita conviction of the mind-createdness of the world we know. It is as if in mythic similes and metaphors the mind were playing with itself.
