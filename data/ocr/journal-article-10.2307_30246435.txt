Using images in stone ("rock art") as a vehicle to explore issues of the past, place, and identity, I discuss the perspectives of Tohono O'odham, Hopi, Zuni, and Western Apache cultural advisors proffered during a three-year collaborative ethnohistoric research project. This paper seeks to examine alternative perspec- tives of glyphs in the American Southwest, as well as to illuminate the social meanings that intersect these signs of the past, the landscape of which they are a part, and the modern identities they help shape. RESUMEN Veintenas de yacimientos-desde presas de mamuts hasta pueblos en ruinas-se encuen- tran dispersos a lo largo del Valle de San Pedro, marcando el rastro de doce mil aios de historia indoamericana. Por medio de imdgenes en piedra (arte rupestre) como vehiculos para explorar asuntos relacionados con el pasado, la ubicaci6n y la identidad, discuto las perspectivas que consejeros de los Tohono O'odham, Hopi, Zuni, y Western Apache ofrecieron durante un proyecto etnohist6rico en colaboraci6n que dur6 tres afiios. Este ensayo busca examinar perspectivas alternativas de los glifos de la Amdrica sudoccidental, asf como echar luz sobre las implicaciones sociales relacionadas con estos signos del pasa- do, el panorama al que pertenecen y las identidades modernas que ayudan a perfilar. In the Sonoran Desert of southern Arizona, running water is like a Siren at sea. Few creatures can resist the lure of these waterways, creating a lush ribbon of life in the midst of a stark expanse. Among the last free flowing rivers in the American Southwest, the San Pedro River is no exception.

Interwoven with this tapestry of vibrant life is the archaeological landscape. For at least 12,000 years, generations of humans have lived along the river leaving behind them the traces of their persistence. Scores of sites-from mammoth kills to his- toric mines-are strewn across the San Pedro Valley (Fulton 1966; Gregonis 1996; Haury et al. 1959). Among the many kinds of sites in the San Pedro are the places inscribed with images in stone ("rock art"), which offer us a picture of the past not captured in any other medium of history. Scholars have long been fascinated by the possible meanings and func- tions of images in stone around the world (Whitely 2001). Images in stone are of interest not only to western researchers however, but also to native peoples whose ancestors created these very objects of scholarly inquiry. Robert Layton has recommended that the ethnographic study of native viewpoints of glyphs can ultimately lead to an understanding of their meanings to the outsider and its "inward evocations of meanings" (Layton 2001:315). Yet the investigation of native people's interpretations ought not function merely as a tool to help archaeologists craft history; it can also serve to illuminate how and why land- scapes with petroglyphs and pictographs are extraordinary places in our contem- porary world. An ethnohistoric study of Native American viewpoints teaches us as much about the present as it does the past. This paper explores the way four contemporary Native American groups use, value, and interpret glyphs in the San Pedro Valley of southeastern Arizona. Importantly, discussions of these places provide an avenue for addressing the broader cultural and historical landscape in the San Pedro. This paper is based on the extant literature and a three-year ethnohistoric research project spearheaded by T.J. Ferguson (see Colwell-Chanthaphonh and Ferguson, in press) and con- ducted in collaboration with the Hopi Tribe, Pueblo of Zuni, Tohono O'odham Nation, and San Carlos and White Mountain Apache Tribes (Figure 1). This work shows that sites with images in stone are not simply or generally important to these Native Americans, but that such places provide specific cultural experiences. To elucidate how Native Americans envision images in stone cultural advisors either visited or saw images from three sites--Charleston, Villa Verde, and Mal- pais Hill (Table 1; Figure 2). Although there are more than 2,000 known sites with glyphs in Arizona, only several dozen have been formally recorded in the San Pedro watershed (Thiel 1995:124-127). One of the areas with the largest concen- trations of petroglyph surrounds the ghost town of Charleston (Fulton and Bahre 1967), which has four discrete loci of anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, and geo- metric images predominately dating to the Hohokam period (Kolber 1992; Fig- ure 3). A site with comparable depictions of abstract symbols and human-like figures dating to the Classic Period (A.D. 1200-1400) is Villa Verde, at the head- waters of the San Pedro River forty miles south of the current U.S.-Mexico border</page><page sequence="3">SIGNS IN PLACE 7 ARIZONA NEW MEXICO Gokof HOPI Gallup Flagstaff o 1 e 0^ZUNI HITE MOUNTAIN ACHE Phoenix Iver SAN CARLOS S APACH ucson TOHONO . .

From the fantastic images of spirals, dots, anthropomorphs, and geomorphic figures, archaeologists concluded that the place was "ceremonial in nature," and made by ancestors of the Western Apache people (Schaafsma 1980:337-341; Schaafsma and Vivian 1975; cf. Meighan 1993; Quijada et al. 1997). The technique of photo elicitation (El Gundi 1998) enabled us to initiate a dialogue about history and the meanings these images hold for people today.

As with any interpretation, these have been shaped by personal experiences, but they are simultaneously laced with rich social and historical meanings. Vansina (1985) and others (Appadurai 2001; Olwig 1999) have all persuasively argued that sto- ries of the past are not, in the words of Appadurai (1981:201), a "limitless and plastic symbolic resource, infinitely susceptible to the whims of contemporary interest and the distortions of contemporary ideology." Rather, people's histori- cal imagination is constrained by socially bound mechanisms of power and authority, and culturally constructed concepts of time and space. As significantly, employing ethnographic approaches is vital because, "If we throw out ethno- graphic information that relates to the cultures under investigation, we are free to cast the past into our own terms, and it becomes a mirror of ourselves" (Schaafs- ma 1997:16).</page><page sequence="5">SIGNS IN PLACE 9 Malpais Hill Tucson A \ 0 10 20 Kilometers SCharleston Sierra Vista A / *lVilla Verde Arzn Sonora ~~ lilaVed Figure 2. Petroglyph and Pictograph sites in the San Pedro Valley discussed in this paper. SIGNS FROM THE ANCESTORS In a series of insightful publications, M. Jane Young (1985, 1987a, 1987b, 1988) provides a foundation for understanding the meanings of place and petroglyphs among the Zuni. Young argues that petroglyphs and pictographs are still impor- tant for Zunis today as the force inherent in imagery is transferred to place through the creation of images in stone. For Zunis, these images are thought to be important messages or "signs from the ancestors," although they may not</page><page sequence="6">10 Chip Colwell-Chanthaphonh Figure 3.

Indeed, Young contends that Zunis draw power from the very ambiguity of glyphs as interpretations evolve around the context in which they are given. This fluidity of meaning is sustained through a Zuni emphasis on process over product and the unity of all things, sensate and insen- sate, past and present:</page><page sequence="7">SIGNS IN PLACE 11 Figure 4. Numerous pet- roglyphs at Villa Verde are located around the conical hill in the center of the pic- ture. (The reservoir is human-made.) Petroglyphs at Villa Verde include a winding spiral motif.

[S]pace is not viewed as being outside or external to ceremonial life, nor is it regarded as something to be traveled through or overcome. Rather such bound- aries do not apply; the cosmos is one entity and the beings within it operate according to the principles of circularity rather than linearity. (Young 1987a:186). In this way the past is still experienced in the present as Zunis use history to com- prehend their world and shape their identity. Young suggests that landmarks may be metonyms of narrative, "evoking not just the image of the place named, but the emotions, the moral values, the stories associated with such places as well" (Young 1987b:4).

In ancient stories and contemporary practice, Zunis have valued rock imagery-atsinna:wa ("inscriptions on rock") as it is called in the Zuni language (Ferguson 2002:4.14). In an early reference, tKidiklo, a god, recounting the origin account says, 'A'"sina'hkwi a'wik'ta; is'ko thluwal'emaku" ("We come to stone-picture place; here we get up and move on") (Stevenson 1904:87). Frank H. Cushing also recorded an allusion to images in stone in a story of ancient days, where migrants made "the marks of the rites of their fathers and of their kin-names on the rocks thereabout" (Cushing 1896:386). Elsie Clews Parsons, in her classic Pueblo Indian Religion, discussed places of significance such as ruins, caves, and boulders. She added: "There are other places of interest in Pueblo geography, usually places where people stopped or lived during their early migrations. At Hanthlipinkya, where there are many pictographs, the Ashiwi (Zuni tribe) stopped and got their clan names." Anthropologists continued to document Zuni interpretations of glyphs throughout the twentieth century, from the work of Frank H.H. Roberts (1932) to Evans et al. (1993) at Petroglyph National Monument. Ferguson (2002: 4.14-4.15) has recorded in detail the range of Zuni interpretations including symbols of migrations, animals, plants, and celestial bodies, as well as specific ceremonial figures such as Hlewekwe (Sword-Swallower) and the ritual activities of medicine societies: Zuni cultural advisors report that the petroglyphs in [Petroglyph National] Mon- ument reference the entire regional landscape and history of the Enotedekwa, the ancient Zuni People. For the Zuni, these petroglyphs represent knowledge given to them by their fathers and grandfathers .... In prayers and in daily life, these ancestors continue to be with the Zuni. The petroglyphs are thus a powerful form of communication across the generations. Zuni cultural advisors felt a strong spiritual and historical affinity to many places in the San Pedro Valley, most notably, Reeve Ruin and Davis Ranch Ruin- sites with distinct traces of Western Pueblo ancestors (Di Peso 1958a, 1958b). As we stood at the edge of a sunken room, which archaeologists and advisors both called a ceremonial kiva, Octavius Seowtewa thoughtfully said: This trip allows us to make the spiritual and cultural connection between Zuni and here. You find these sites like this one, here and at Zuni, so it's a real connec- tion. The stories told to us by our ancestors weren't just myths because we've now seen these sites. Now we know our ancestors were here.</page><page sequence="10">14 Chip Colwell-Chanthaphonh As the kiva, artifacts, architecture, and the attendance of spirits told the Zuni advisors of their ancestor's presence, so too they found connections in the rock imagery of the San Pedro. Of the images shown to them, they interpreted various animal forms, including a bear paw, dragonfly, human, centipede, and turkey. Another image of two figures holding hands adjacent to four enchained diamonds was thought to represent "humans holding hands ... and the four underworlds; the people are holding hands because they pulled each other out of the underworlds." Advisors suggested one petroglyph, which archaeologists would categorize as snake-like, as being "a trail marker of the river, a map." Sim- ilarly another image of a spider-web like design was taken to "indicate where things are in different directions." Zuni advisors maintained that they did not know anything about the polychromatic paintings of Malpais Hill because, "We use red, black, and white, but not green." The image of the unwinding spiral at Villa Verde was immediately identified as a migration symbol (cf. Young 1988:136). Seowtewa explained at length: A line connected to a spiral is like a migration trail. During migration, the people up looking ahead to make settlements, they would draw a pecked line to show others where they were going. There are traditions of different people going ahead and branching out. If they didn't find a good settlement area, they'd go back to the main group. If they found a good fertile area, the others would come.... Because this one has a connecting line, it's not just a spiral; it is about migration. Importantly, Zuni advisors did not identify every stone image, admitting that some symbols they had never seen before. Even though these images could not be identified they were still important because as one advisor confided, "I don't know, but it meant something to somebody back then." Such statements comport with those of Young's Zuni advisors who similarly asserted such stone images are "a message from our ancestors that we can no longer understand" (Young 1987a: 183). Despite the loss or confusion of particular signs, for the Zuni, the markers on the landscape, ruins and glyphs alike, "reinforce ... their perception of themselves as a people intimately linked to their particular land- scape where powerful beings dwell and where significant events of the past took place" (Young 1988:238). HOLY PLACES South of the Gila River just off Highway 77 is Dudleyville, a rural mining town of modest brick houses and dirt lots, left slightly unhinged when the focus of the copper industry shifted to South America. Standing sentinel above Dudleyville to the west is a prominent peak called Malpais Hill, an appellation of Spanish origin meaning "bad country." The Apache name for the same point is Nadnlid</page><page sequence="11">SIGNS IN PLACE 15 Cho ("big sunflower hill"), whose base meets the Sambeda, the San Pedro River. In Apache oral tradition, long ago, two clans originated to the south of Big Sun- flower Hill, the Ddhiigbtshdhf ("yellow extending upward people") and the Sdgihne (meaning unknown) (Goodwin 1942:616-617). When the United States Army erected Fort Aravaypa in 1860 nearby at Lednti ("flows together"), the soldiers moved into the homeland of the Tcejind ("dark rocks people") and the 'Tis'evian (named after the place 'tiseviz, "cottonwoods in gray wedge shape"), or who the Americans called the Arivaipa and Pinal bands (Goodwin 1942:24-29; see Stone 1941). Throughout the late 1800s, Apache families continued to live around Big Sunflower Hill, including Coyotes, Segulas, Ha-ca-tes, and the prominent leader Hackibinzin. Although most Apaches were forced to leave the San Pedro through intimidation tactics, physical violence, and land theft, others were able to maintain a livelihood there to even a generation ago. On a wintry morning in early 2002, Rosalie Talgo, a San Carlos Apache elder, led a group of us down a rough dirt road at the base of Big Sunflower Hill. After a slow bumpy mile, Ms. Talgo told the driver to stop-her father's mother and cousin's mother were buried on a nearby hill, next to a tall saguaro. She was too frail to walk up the steep incline, but those who did saw several oblong rock rings, marking the graves of Ms. Talgo's relatives. As we stopped there and rested, Ms. Talgo told us that here her father cultivated corn, sugar cane, and herded cat- tle. Ms. Talgo's father left the area about 1910 for San Carlos to be a policeman, and it was around then, she surmised, that white people were finally able to take over the area. Ms. Talgo remembers her father referring to a place nearby with "writings on the rock." Flaring out from the northern base of Big Sunflower Hill is a sandy ridge rising above the creosote flats. Along the wall of the cliff is a horizontal overhang that shelters pictographs drawn in vibrant, though fading, shades of white, black, red, yellow, and green. Archaeologists have called this place the Malpais Picto- graph Site, or more technically AZ BB:2:16 (ASM). When T. J. Ferguson and I vis- ited the site with Apache advisors, several of the paintings were interpreted without trouble: a lizard, snake, rattlesnake, elk (or deer), Gain dancer, and a "higher being" also referred to as a "deity." Some advisors had never seen various depictions, such as a black and white rattlesnake-like creature with two tails. A more recent inscription, etched into the base of the overhang, "IVAN HENRY 1929" was identified as a possible Apache name. To one elder, several of the images looked like they might not be from the hand of an Apache: one black col- ored cross was seen as a "copy" of the "original" red cross. Ramon Riley-whose relatives served as military scouts farther south at Fort Huachuca--asserted that all the images he saw were unmistakably Apache, even suggesting that the ances- tors left some as signs to declare, "This is our land." When Larry Mallow, Sr., an Apache participant, was shown reproductions of the pictographs he inferred that some of the images did not look wholly Apache to him, although in separate</page><page sequence="12">16 Chip Colwell-Chanthaphonh interviews both he and Eva Watt, another Apache elder, talked about some of these symbols resembling the modern iconography of Silas John (see Basso 1990:25-52). Two of the advisors noted that various motifs-like a stylized lizard-are similar to icons represented in Apache sand paintings. The ceremonial associations of these icons were further illuminated when we presented Eva Watt with some photographs of the site. Pointing to a picture of a painted black loop connected to a red cross, she said that in 1926 she wit- nessed a man put that same mark on the palm of the hands of her sister-in-law and brother "for that rattlesnake ceremony . . . that way no snake would bite them." Interestingly, because of the zoomed in print we showed her, Ms. Watt did not know that just next to the circle and cross emblem are four snake-like symbols, including the two-tailed snake and one snake with two heads. Yet Ms. Watt was probably referring to the sailis jan bi' at' eehi ("Silas John his sayings") movement which began around 1920 and involved novel rituals and a language system that "had a strong emphasis on healing with rattlesnakes and on cross symbols employed at 'holy ground' dance areas and conferred protective bless- ings on all who believed" (Ferg and Kessel 1988:144). Several weeks later when Ramon Riley visited the site with me, on seeing this whole panel but without knowing Ms. Watt's interview, he commented that, "This person who made this knew about the snake ceremonies." Although Mr. Riley could have been referring to the rituals of Silas John, other Apache ceremonies involving snake iconography are also known (e.g., Bourke 1892:504-505). In 1902, Albert Reagan witnessed a singing given for a young Apache girl, Twinkling Star, dying of consumption. During the ritual, a drawing in red, white, black, gray, and green sixteen feet in diameter was made "in a protected spot at the edge of the woods" (Reagan 1923:78). An illustration of a medicine drawing used on a different occasion included the depiction of four rattlesnakes and other animals. Earlier in the ceremony, the medicine man took a "crudely made, striped, wooden snake," doused it in ashes and then, while singing, placed it against the patient's afflicted body parts. The wooden snake was next completely burned, as the singer "sends the evil spirits away with a hissing breath and looks with elevated face towards the northeastern heavens" (Reagan 1923:76). Grenville Goodwin (n.d.) correspondingly emphasized the force of snake imagery when he recited a story Neil Buck told him in 1937 about witches who "connived to destroy everyone about them" using a "rock with a picture of a snake drawn on it" in part to accomplish their fiendish errand. The disaster was averted only when the rock was found and a "shaman ... told them they must destroy it, so they smashed it to bits, and he used his power on it and made it harmless" (Goodwin n.d.). This was a time when there were old snake medicine songs, "tl-ij si, for snake sickness." Unlike the Zuni elders, the Apache cultural advisors largely did not seek the encoded meanings of each symbol. Vernelda Grant told us, "These places are</page><page sequence="13">SIGNS IN PLACE 17 'releases' where medicine men release the bad stuff they collect during curing cer- emonies . . . wherever they got it from, it could be symbols from other bad groups-so we may never know and we were not meant to know what these symbols are." These comments resonate with Opler's observation among the Chiricahua Apache that "places with markings on the walls or on rocks may be considered sacred" (Opler 1965:312; also see Schaafsma 1980:341). Similarly, Goodwin (1942:64) suggests caves are intensified places for Apaches, in part because Gin may live there; and as at "na-go-i-ah there is a big cave where the snake medicine-(man?) lives" (Goodwin n.d.). Anna Price told Goodwin (n.d.) about a cave in the White Mountains where she and others made prayers and solicitations for good fortune. Evoking such accounts, as we were walking away from the pictograph site, Vernelda Grant emphasized that these places are very potent and powerful; she added that this is "holy ground ... that's serious stuff." It is not only sites where "releases" of medicine and prayers occur that are holy places. Apache advisors told us that even archeological sites are important because they were once occupied by the nalkfde ("ancient ones"). Even those vil- lages not lived in by the nohwizd'yd ("departed Apache people") are important because they are ancient places where Apaches continue to go to gather ritual objects, charged with power through their association of place. As we wandered around one site in the San Pedro, an Apache colleague, Jeanette Cassa shared, This time of year, people are picking up beads from archaeology sites. Mostly they use pink, black, white and turquoise beads . . . these are of value to us. But we don't pick these up with our hands, but a stick. These beads are used in dances for young girls, the nai'iees ceremony. Medicine men in particular may comb sites for objects such as abalone shell, beads, and other artifacts. One advisor summarized this use of place by saying that Apaches would collect "groundstone, beads, and arrowheads ... these are the things people pick up and use. My grandmother used these things." Because archaeological sites furnish ritual objects and offer a means to connect directly the present with past, a sense of sacredness pervades them. The very power of the objects impregnated within these spaces was made clear in the warning that people ought not pick up certain artifacts, like beads, with bare hands. Thus, like the preternatural space of the pictographs, notions of the sacro- sanct are suffused throughout archaeological sites. Walking across one ruined village, an advisor simply affirmed: "To us, these are holy places." For the Western Apache, the landscape surrounding the Malpais Picto- graph Site and the story of the Apache people in relation to it is as central to understanding the place as any translation of a specific image. Even as places such as Big Sunflower Hill and nearby archaeological sites provide a means of contact with the "holy," the landscape is simultaneously inscribed with the diffi-</page><page sequence="14">18 Chip Colwell-Chanthaphonh cult history of union to a place and the exit from it. The named landscape recalls that past and fosters a reconnection in the present (Basso 1996). For Rosalie Talgo, these associations are not abstract or even purely culturally bound; they are the personal story of her family, whose corporeal remains still reside at the base of Big Sunflower Hill. FOOTPRINTS OF THE HISAT.SINOM The origin and evolution of the Hopi people is narrated not in a single tale, but the manifold stories of how humans emerged in this, the Fourth World, and trav- eled throughout the land until they reached the center of the universe, the Hopi Mesas. Sitting in his cinder block home in the village of Songbopavi, Elden Kuwanyama recounted to me: We know we came from Mexico, from the Sfpaapuni. I'm from Palatkwapi. ... Other people came up and came on this land, although there were no clans then. They then met with Maasaw who told them, "I've been waiting for you. You put your feet on this land-it's yours." As the people of the world surfaced, they made a covenant with Miaasaw and sojourned across the earth gradually forming into dozens of clans until at last they arrived at the Hopi Mesas. Ancient Hopi history is accordingly encapsu- lated in clan migration stories, which directly relate to the paced movement of ancient people from one village to the next. As Dalton Taylor, a Hopi elder point- ed out, "These aren't just old ruins; it's the history of our migrations, and how our ancestors traveled." The Hopi kin who traversed the landscape in ancient times were the Hisat.sinom, the ancestors, the people of long ago (Dongoske et al. 1997:603; Hill et al. 1998; Lyons 2003). Today, Hopis say that when the Hisat.sinom left one place for another, they would intentionally leave behind evidence of their life- pottery was shattered and ruins left standing. "It's important because it's ours; we're the ones who stayed there and left our ruins right there. They let us know they were there by breaking up their pottery to say we were there. Also the petro- glyphs, and the manos and metates," Harold Polingyumptewa affirmed in an interview. These "footprints" of the ancestors were deliberately left for clans fol- lowing behind, as well as distant generations to know their history (see Ferguson et al. 1995, 2001; Kuwanwisiwma 2002a, 2002b). The artifacts fixed in the land do not merely chronicle the history of the Hopi forbearers they also buttress living Hopis' sense of self-identity. As Micah Loma'omvaya, a Hopi scholar, offered in a conversation: The footprints reaffirm oral and material traditions. The evidence confirms affilia- tion with Hopi today. People today can recognize the things in the past, and it</page><page sequence="15">SIGNS IN PLACE 19 becomes an unbroken continuity.... Our interpretations are based on experience, not hypotheses like archaeologists. That's why this continuity is so important to us ... it reaffirms ties to the land-it's one element of our identity, who we are. Ancestral places are sacred because even today they continue to be occu- pied by the remains of once living people, and Hopis aver to directly experience the Hisat.sinom in those places. Hopis say that they encounter their deceased ancestors through emotional responses to a place; at an ancestral village one man of the Flute Clan recounted that he heard the tune of a flute carried on the wind and another saw a bounding deer, sent as a good sign. Ancient sites are often referred to as being "alive" and some believe that the deceased ancestors can hear us speak as we stand among the vestiges of their homes. Amidst the footprints left behind during the Hisat.sinom migrations are the rock markings. Wilmer Kavena calling images in rock tutuveni said, "This is what they call pictures on rocks .... All petroglyphs record clan migrations in those areas that they were in. They were instructed to leave markings. ... These are evi- dence of the Hopi-everywhere you go, you put your symbol" (see Hill et al. 1998). For more than a century anthropologists have investigated the signifi- cance of images in stone to the Hopi, as ancient signs have been etched directly onto the very bedrock of the Hopi Mesas (Fewkes 1892; Parsons 1996:187). Such glyphs are used adjacent to shrines (Fewkes 1906:362-364), and "spirals and concentric petroglyphs" in part demarcate the "exterior boundary of the Hopi domain" (Eggan 1994:15). Even as recently as the early 1900s, Hopis were known to have left clan symbols on cliffs during salt gathering pilgrimages (Colton 1946; Colton and Colton 1931; Mallery 1886:29; Michaelis 1981). When Hopi cultural advisors were shown pictures of tutuveni in the San Pedro, their interpretations fell into six categories: clans, plants/animals, migra- tion, religious societies/ceremonies, astronomy, and landscape, the first four being the most prominent. Images of animals or their tracks were commonly identified as clan symbols, so that an icon interpreted as "bear tracks" implied the "Bear Clan" had been present. Of the San Pedro stone images, advisors explicitly identified twelve clans: Badger, Bear, Bear Strap, Corn, Greasewood, Horn, Lizard, Sand, Snake, Sun, Water, and Water-Corn. This notion has prece- dent in Fewkes' (1897) work with "totemic signatures," clan symbols illustrated on rocks, cliffs, buildings, paper and other media. Not every plant or animal was assigned to a particular clan. For instance, some advisors identified such animals and plants as the centipede, tadpole, parrot, homed toad, and elk without sug- gesting a specific clan affiliation. Migration symbols were not ubiquitous, but advisors easily concurred on which images were intended as symbols of population movements. For instance, every Hopi advisor who chose to comment on the unwinding spiral at Villa Verde interpreted it is a migration symbol, although advisors did vary in the</page><page sequence="16">20 Chip Colwell-Chanthaphonh details of their readings. A Hopi team of advisors suggested that the spiral illus- trated, "This is the clan migration going down to Mexico, California, up to Alas- ka ... covering a large area." Leigh J. Kuwanwisiwma posited that the winding line of the spiral indicated, "After emergence, a clan was back down there to revisit down south." Likewise Jim Towyesua, Sr. felt that this image meant, "These might be people returning back home in that valley." Similar designs of concentric circles were distinctly interpreted as being related to celestial obser- vances and mapping the landscape. As Albert Reagan (1920) connected petroglyphs with known Hopi cere- monies, so too Hopi advisors saw religious societies depicted in the San Pedro glyphs (also see Schaafsma 1981; Sims 1949). Two advisors interpreted a panel with two human-like figures holding hands, placed adjacent to four interlinked diamonds as part of the Wuwtsim dance (see McCreery and Malotki 1994:134). In turn another advisor thought that the same image depicted the Snake Clan- the four diamonds not only representing the back of a rattlesnake, but also a foot race associated with the Snake Clan where runners cross paths four times. The two figures were inferred to be snake priests holding one another. Lastly, a key- hole shaped image at Malpais Hill, painted in black and white was interpreted to be associated with the Antelope Society. These interpretations do not encompass every conceivable Hopi reading of tutuveni. Rather, these explanations are ideas the cultural advisors chose to relate, of how they envision these images in stone to be a part of the complex of objects interwoven with the landscape that make up the footprints of the Hisat.sinom. Although for the Hopi these icons are intimately tied to their ancestral clan migrations, they also tell of the ceremonial life and landscape in which the ancestors resided until finally, they reached the center of the universe. SACRED SPOTS AND WRITING ON THE ROCKS In early fall of 1692, Father Eusubio Francisco Kino visited a string of Sobaipuri villages on the "Rio Quiburi" (San Pedro River) for the first time (Bolton 1936:267). Over the next decade, the Jesuit priest and his compatriots Juan Mateo Manje and Crist6bal Martin Bemal, traveled to the villages of these Piman speaking peoples (Burrus 1971), recording their observations of the inhabitants on the river who raised "by irrigation plentiful maize and beans, besides cotton, which they wove, dyed, and wore for clothing" (Bolton 1936:361). Although Kino found the Sobaipuri to be "less docile" (Bolton 1936:269) than the Pima people to the west, the Sobaipuri eventually consented to the Spanish presence, even actively fighting in concert with them against the native peoples who lived in "Apacherfa" beyond the Spanish frontier. By the 1760s, after years of perpetu- al strife, the Sobaipuri left their redoubts along the San Pedro for safer homes on the Santa Cruz and Gila rivers (Di Peso 1953:40).</page><page sequence="17">SIGNS IN PLACE 21 Today, several centuries after their ancestors moved their quarters to the west, the O'odham maintain links to the valley. The names of these ancestors are rarely recalled as the names given to the mountains and valleys, rivers and arroyos of the San Pedro have been lost. But even within the minds of those still living, memories persist of visiting Oracle, the Santa Catalina Mountains, Dra- goon Mountains, and Huachuca Mountains to gather bear grass and yucca to use in weaving baskets. Few of the O'odham advisors who traveled as children to the San Pedro continue to make the trip, because, they say, people who now live in these areas do not welcome foraging O'odham. Although it is difficult for O'od- ham to physically interact with some sacred sites and much traditional knowl- edge has been scattered, many O'odham continue to place great value on their historical landscapes. Part of this connection is grounded in traditional narra- tives and practices that include explicit references to the ruins of past peoples (Bahr et al. 1994; Bahr 2001:201-202). The sanctified nature of these places was underscored when Ida Ortega, an O'odham advisor, chose to leave an offering of white corn at the site of Reeve Ruin. Far from being a worldly gesture, "Corn, which was the staple food of the [O'odham] as of many Indians in the Southwest, was regarded as holy. To sprin- kle a little cornmeal on anyone or anything was the same as giving him a bless- ing" (Underhill 2000:57). Walking away from the site, Ida in her soft voice explained that her oblation was parallel to the O'odham practice of setting little tables with a big feast, like watermelon and bread at graves: "To leave things to remember them." After a pause, she said that when O'odham go, they make extra things for the grave of a person that they do not even know. For Ida it did- n't matter if O'odham or Western Pueblo ancestors lived here, only, "It is impor- tant to respect them if they are dead. That's what is important." Focusing on two sites along the U.S.-Mexico border in southwestern Ari- zona, Rick and Sandy Martynec (1995) concluded that historically the O'odham made petroglyphs of initials, dates, names, and livestock brands (cf. Hayden 1972). Not far south of where the Martynecs examined glyphs, on a rocky outcrop near the town of Pitiquito, Sonora, a Christian shrine sits on top of earlier Indian petroglyphs, indicating to some the continuity of O'odham sacred spaces over the centuries (Griffith 1992:143). In the northern end of the O'odham world, the ethnographer Frank Russell observed a similar "sacred place" in the early 1900s: HIdhdtesumiehin or Hdhdtai s'maihisk, Stones Strike, is a large block of lava located in the eastern Santan hills. The largest pictograph ever seen by the writer in the Southwest is cut upon it and 2 or 3 tons of small angular stones foreign to the locality are piled before it. There are also many pictographs on the bowlders [sic] round about. This was probably a Hohokam shrine, though it is regarded with reverence by the Pimas, who still place offerings of beads, bits of cloth, and twigs of the creosote bush at the foot of the large pictograph (Russell 1975:254).</page><page sequence="18">22 Chip Colwell-Chanthaphonh According to Jose Enriquez, an O'odham elder, today people continue to leave offerings at "sacred spots" like petroglyph sites, as well as caves and shrines. The O'odham advisors intimated that it is preferable to leave hand-made objects, but people also offer money, plastic trophies, dolls, and other modem accou- trements. People submit these things to demonstrate respect and to foster "good luck." Bernard Siquieros, an O'odham collaborator, warned that "If you go up to a shrine and are disrespectful and take things, then you'll get sick." Jose Enriquez added that the "elders say that if you abuse something ... an accident will hap- pen, maybe not to the perpetrator, but to his next of kin." Such places are power- ful for their ability to inflict harm or offer aid, as well as their affiliation to past people. Jose's brother Joseph Enriquez noted that he sees petroglyphs where he goes hunting, but such signs in stone are not meant to be scrutinized, they are "just a reminder that our ancestors were here as well." The actual meaning of images in stone have for the most part been lost with the passing of the ancestors. Jose remarked that, "It meant something to our ancestors, although we don't know what it means today." The symbols in glyphs were likened to those etched into O'odham "calendar sticks," which record momentous events in O'odham history. And as with calendar sticks, the O'od- ham advisors felt that the icons engraved into rocks for the most part only have meaning to its carver. Thus, of the glyphs from the San Pedro shown to the O'od- ham advisors, few specific interpretations were attempted except where an unde- niable human or animal form could be discerned. An exception to this general reticence to interpret symbols in glyphs was exhibited in an anecdote told by Bernard Siquieros. In this story, one day a hunter was out when he tied his horse to a tree and began walking. He walked a long way and became so thirsty he could not turn back to retrieve his horse. As he rested under a tree, exhausted, by chance another O'odham man came and asked what he was doing sitting there. The hunter explained his situation, to which the stranger asked if he knew of any petroglyphs or pictographs in the vicinity. As it happened, the hunter did know of a place nearby and showed the glyphs to the stranger who climbed up to the panel of images and studied them. The stranger then walked around and began burrowing into the sandy ground. Soon water came gurgling up. Amazed, the hunter asked him how he understood where to dig, and the stranger replied that he knew from the "writings on the rock." The ligatures O'odham make to images in stone are enlaced with their notions of respect for the ancestors and their feelings of loss because of separa- tion from traditional landscapes. The San Pedro Valley was and continues to be a home to O'odham ancestors and other ancient people. Archaeological sites are like burial grounds, sacred spots infused with the power of what lies beyond our daily perceptions of the world. For the O'odham, images in stone are a part of that sacred universe. But these spaces are less and less accessible to living O'od- ham; they are less able to reconnect to these landscapes. Places like Oracle and</page><page sequence="19">SIGNS IN PLACE 23 the Huachuca Mountains no longer provide the raw materials for traditional activities-activities that sustain families and the broader community. This too is part of the San Pedro's meaning for the O'odham today. FROM THE PAST, IN THE PRESENT: SOME CONCLUSIONS The social meanings of images in stone for many contemporary native peoples are multi-layered and complex. Perhaps because so many different groups have lived in the San Pedro Valley over so many millennia, each of the tribes in this investi- gation make claims of connections that are frequently overlapping, but at times altogether distinct. For instance, the advisors from both of the Western Pueblo groups-the Zuni and Hopi-consistently talked about the petroglyph of the unwinding spiral at Villa Verde as an unambiguous sign of their ancestors' migra- tions. The O'odham and Apache advisors offered no such assertions. And while the Zuni did not sense a clear kinship to Malpais Hill, the Western Apache advi- sors for the most part professed a strong tie to these pictographs because of recog- nizable iconography and the acknowledgment of the site as a sanctified space. Still, from this research, scholars might wonder how these interpretations could inform historical analyses that seek to order petroglyphs and pictographs in a temporal sequence or decipher the symbolism rock imagery held in the past. The question here then, is by what standards can archaeologists evaluate such ethnographic data? Fortunately, ethnohistorians have developed a gamut of stratagems through which collated ethnographic accounts can be filtered and recombined with other categories of historical information. Although written nearly twenty years ago, Vansina's Oral Tradition as History remains valuable; and in practice numerous researchers have engaged with this text (e.g., Anyon et al. 1997, 2000; Dongoske et al. 1997; Echo Hawk 1997, 2000; Fixico 1997; Lyons 2003; Whiteley 2002). Drawing on such critical ethnohistoric techniques, archaeologists can effectively use native oral histories and the cultural meanings tied to ancestral places as a guidepost for studying human experience and behav- ior in the past. Such questions lie just beyond this inquiry because in this article I have put forward that even though places with glyphs have evocative meanings for contemporary native peoples, these links may not always be of the kind that archaeologists narrowly desire for constructing their culture histories. Just because Native Americans cannot (or choose not) to offer loaded cultural inter- pretations that continually penetrate into the yawning recesses of the remote past, however, does not imply that these places are without meaning and value for people today. Following from the work of Schiffer (1995), if archaeologists are charged with explicating the relationships all humans make to their material world, archaeologists ought to be equally concerned with modemrn and ancient times. Consequently this ethnohistoric research is a breed of archaeology-but not only an archaeology to imagine the distant past.</page><page sequence="20">24 Chip Colwell-Chanthaphonh This study has illustrated that many Native Americans recognize a strong emotional and historical connection to archaeological sites-especially those with petroglyphs and pictographs. Unlike many western scholars, however, the cultural advisors we worked with did not think of sites with glyphs in isolation from the broader geographic landscape or native people's self-identity. For the Hopi this means that it would be absurd to talk about the iconography of spirals without the symbolic meanings of ancient clan migrations, as it would be incon- gruous for Rosalie Talgo to discuss the pictographs at Big Sunflower Hill without referring to the nearby land her family lost. Incorporating Native American van- tage points into archaeological studies of "rock art" may entail a wider anthro- pological perspective that does not divorce glyphs from ruins or even contemporary social ills. Such orderly partitions of the material landscape at dis- tinct moments of time constitute archaeologists' own singular mindset, their own fractional outlook on the world. These native views that imagine the uni- verse as an inseparable body of life thus offer a rich understanding of the social and physical "place" of images in stone, both in the past and present.
