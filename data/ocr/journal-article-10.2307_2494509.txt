<plain_text><page sequence="1">RUSSELL ZGUTA Origins of the Russian Puppet Theater: An Alternative Hypothesis The Russian puppet theater (kukol'nyi teatr or'Petrushka) is not well known in the West. There are passing references to it in general histories of puppetry and the like, but unfortunately these are more often confusing than enlighten- ing. One learns, for example, that the Old Russian version of the Polish marionette theater, the szopka, was the "bertep [sic] meaninig Bethlehem,n"' or that the first known description of a Russian puppet show appears in "Adam O'Leary's [sic] Trazvels in Russia and Persia."2 Perhaps even more unfor- tunate, Petrushka has been neglected by native scholars as well. Their failure to deal seriously with the origins of the Russian puppet theater has been particularly glaring, and they have also largely ignored its early history. Most have, in fact, been content to view the entire period before the 1630s, when Adam Olearius appeared with his famous illustrated description of a performing Russian puppeteer, as terra incognita.3 The few scholars who have stucdied the early history of Russian puppetry have generally sought its roots in one of three foreign cultures-Italian, Byzantine, or Chinese. The greatest number of these scholars contencd that 1. Bil Baird, The Art of the Puppet (New York, 1965), p. 67. The author must mean vertep, the Ukrainian word for "cave" or "manger" which is analogous to the Polish szopka. We will not concern ourselves here with the Ukrainian vertep, since it did not play a major role in the evolution of the secular puppet tlheater in Russia. Originally a Christmas play performed by students, the vertep has been compared to the morality and mystery plays of Western Europe. It was brought to the Ukraine from Poland in the late sixteenth century and eventually spread to Belorussia and Great Russia. During the course of the seventeenth century it did have some impact oIn the evolution of the Russian legitimate theater. V. N. Vsevolodsky-Gerngross, Russkzii teatr, ot istokov do seredilly XVIII v.

The reference here is obviously to Adam Olearius, tlle Dutch scholar- traveler who accompanied an embassy from the Duke of Holstein to Muscovy and Persia in the 1630s. 3. The complete text of Olearius's description of the Russian puppet theater appears toward the end of this article. A comprehensive history of the Russian puppet theater remains to be written. The earliest attempt at writing a scholarly account of Russian puppetry was made by V. N. Peretts, Kukol'nyi teatr ta Rusi (St. Petersburg, 1895). Peretts's study is quite brief and begins only in the early seventeeilth century. Among the most recent studies is N. I. Smirnova's Sovetskii teatr kuvlkol (Moscow, 1963), which contains two solid chapters on the earliest period. A delightful fictionalized account of the early history of Petrushka was recently published by B. A. Privalov, Petrutslhka - dusha skomslorosh'ia (Moscow, 1963).</page><page sequence="2">Russian Puppet Theater 709 the Russian puppet theater was borrowed from the West, more specifically from Italy. They argue that the prototype of the Russian puppet hero, Petrushka, is the Italian Pulcinella, who was brought to Russia from Italy, via Germany, in the early seventeenth century by the skortorokhi, the itinerant Russian minstrel-entertainers.4 The close similarity between Petrushka and Pulcinella is regarded as sufficient proof of the Italian or West European origin of the Russian kukol'nyi teatr.5 Less widely accepted is the hypothesis that the Russian puppet theater had its roots in Byzantium, and could have been brought to Kievan Rus' by visiting mimes as early as the tenth or eleventh century.6 To support this argument its proponents point to the frescoes adorning the western staircase of the Kievan Saiint Sophia.7 Among the scenes depicted in these eleventh- century frescoes, frequently referred to as the "skom'orokh frescoes," is one in whiclh two performing acrobats, six musicians, and two actors are engaged in an apparent dialogue. One section of these frescoes, however, is quite enigmatic. Pictured on the extreme left are two men standing behind what appears to be a miniature or puppet stage. A tlhird person stands in front of the stage, pointiing to it. According to Veselovsky, it is entirely possible that the fresco depicts a troupe of puppeteers preparing to give a performance.8 Some sclholars lhave raised the possibility that the puppet theater may have been brouglht to Russia from Chiina by way of the Mongols. After all, it was the Monigols who were instrumental in transmitting their knowledge of Chinese lantern pictures or shadow puppetry to the Turks.9 Could they not have done the same for the Russians? 4. In fact, according to A. M. Veselovsky, the skooiiorokli, as bear-tamers, probably visited Germlainy aind Italy as early as the sixteenth century or even earlier, bringing the pul)pet theater back with themn to Russia at this time.

Petrushka's striking resemblanice to the Italian puppet hero Pulci- nella is indisputable. But so is hiis relation to the Englislh Puniclh, the French Polichinelle, the German Hanswurst, the Czech Kasparek, the Hunigariani Vitez Laszk6, ancd the Turkislh Karagoz, amiaong others. Rather thlaai proving hiis Italian or Western origin, the similarity betweeni Petrushka and these other puppet heroes seems to inldicate the uiniversality of the clharacter, regardlless of lhis ethiic background. Veselovsky's contentioni that the extreme left sectioni of the Sainlt Sophia staircase frescoes represents a troupe of Byzantinie puppeteers preparing to give a performance appeared unltil recently to have considlerable mlerit. Cer- tainly there could be no dlenying that Byzantiumii once exerted a strong cultural influence on Kievan Rus'. However, in 1967 two Soviet sclholars pub)lishled an importanat article, based on resear-ch carriedl out after the mlost recent and extensive restoration of the Saint Sophia frescoes, in wlhich they dcemonstrated conclusively tlhat wlhat had so lonag beeni thouglht to be anl early example of the Byzaintinie puppet theater was in fact a Byzalntine pnaeumatic organ.10 The possibility of tracinag the origins of the Russiain puppet tlleater to Clhinia through the M\ongols canniot be dlislmiissedI out of lhalndl eitlher. As Vernadsky has so ably demonstrated, the Maongols did not always leave only destruction anid ruin in their wake after coniquering anad suibtjugatinlg muclh of Russia.11 The imain difficulty here is to reconcile the Cllinese tecillique of shadow puppetry or lanterln pictures with the Russian lhandl and string puppets. In Turkey the lantern tecilmique, wlich we know was introduiced by the Mongols, has survived to this day. In Russia! with perhaps one very question- able early exception, there is no evidence of its ever beilng used.12 10. S. A. Vysotsky and I. F.

It arises from a statemiient made by Baird (Art of thle Pltppet, p. 84 and( illus. p. 27) in whlich he speculates that the ancienit ancestors of the Slavs, the Scytlhianis, as well as somle of the nomiiadic peoples of Central Asia could have been familiar with shadow puppetry as early as 500 B.C. "It is known," he writes, "that the Scythians of the third and fourth centuries B.C. made handsome silhouettes of leather. And in the burial grounds amlonig the Altai Mountainis near Outer Mongolia, along the old trade route betweeni Chinia and Russia, ther-e have been found cutout leather animilals, one a moose that could well have been a shadow figure." One is more inclined, however, to agree with Karl Jettmlar, who describes similar leather silhouettes as applique decorations, quite coimmon amonig the nomiiadic peoples of this area. Some have been fould, for exam)ple, in the Altai region of Central Asia adorninig the exterior of a woodeni sarcoph- agus and a saddle dating froml the Scythiain era.

The kutkol'nyi teatr, even in its early stage, was probably subject to considerable foreign influence. Those persons most closely identified with the early history of puppetry both in Russia and elsewhere were by nature itinerant and widely traveled. There is evidence not only that Russian skomlor-okhi had visited Germanly and Italy as early as the sixteenth century but that German Spielleute and Byzantine mimes had even earlier (certainly n1o later than the thirteenth century) made their way into Kievan Rus' and Muscovite Russia.13 Surely there must have been some exchange of tecilmique and metlhod, if not repertoire, among these various troupes of entertainers. But one should not confuse influence with origins. And it is here precisely that we take issue with the traditional interpretations. By blurring the distinction between influence and origins, scholars have inadvertently overlooked many centuries of native East Slavic sociocultural development, especially in popular mythology and folk ritual. In the process they have also lost sight of the elementary fact, acknowledged by most autihorities, that puppetry, like drama, had its genesis in religion and religious ceremony.14 The masks and anthropomorphic images which were the essential trappings of many primitive religions were with time and the impact of civilization and Christianity gradually cast aside, becoming the ready "tools of the trade" for the early puppeteer. Precisely how this transformation from religious idol to secular puppet occurred in a given society is as difficult to explain as the unique transformation of Greek ritual to Greek drama. This should not, however, deter us from presenting here what we feel to be persuasive evidence in support of the indigenous origins of the kutkol'nyi teatr, and from offering this as an alternative hypothesis to the three we have examined. Although little evidence survives regarding official public worship among the pagan ancestors of the Eastern Slavs, certain of their traditional rituals, especially those bound up with the agricultural year, have been preserved to our own day. Among these the best k-nown is the cycle of rites with the general theme of bidding farewell to winter and ushering in spring and summer. The winter part of the cycle includes the two festival periods of Koliada (Christmas, New Year) and Maslenitsa (pre-Lent or Mardi Gras) the spring part of the cycle includes Rusalia (Trinity Sunday) and Kupalo (Feast of Saint John 13. Zguta, "Skomorokhi," pp. 299-300. 14. Baird, Art of the Puppet, p. 35; Smirnova, Sovetskii teatr ktukol, pp. 13-14. Professor Vernadsky, in his Origins of Russia (Oxford, 1959), makes thle following observation in the course of his description of the festivities surrounding the Maslenitsa or pre-Lenten festival: "Companies of itinerant actors and musicians (skoillorokhi) per- formed short plays, some of them remnants of the old sacred drama of the heathen tiines. . . . An outgrowth of these shows was the puppet-theatre (Petrushka)" (p. 112).</page><page sequence="5">712 Slavic Review the Baptist or Midsummer). In pre-Christian times the two winter festivals corresponded, more or less, to the winter solstice and spring equinox respec- tively, while the spring festivals were observed arouind the time of the sunmmer solstice. Among the most ancient of tlhe customs associated witlh Koliada, the first of the two winter festivals, is the wearing of masks and costunmes. Botlh in antiquity and in more recent times masks were an essential feature of tllis annual winter observance. The masks were almost exclusively of animnals, the most favored being the goat, the aurochs, the lhorse, the bear, and tlhe wolf. According to most scholars it was probably the Koliada, with its pagan "dramatic" performances, that the eleventh-century Bislhop of Novgorod, Luluka Zhidiata, had in mind wlhen lhe warned his flock to shuin 'ioskolitdstvo. 15 Though in recent timles these games lhave acquired a far less serious tone, they originally served a magical or semnireligious purpose (to wit the bishop's concern and admonition to his flock), since they were intenided to secure a good harvest and the like for the comiilg year.16 The second of the two festivals associated with the winter cycle is Maslenitsa. Like the Mardi Gras and carnival in the West, to wlhiclh it has frequently been compared, Maslenitsa is celebrated during tlhe week immedi- ately preceding the beginning of Lent.17 Since it was originally celebrated around the spring equinox, in Marclh, the Maslenitsa lhas often been described as a ritual of bidding farewell to winter. Like the Koliada it is characterized by the wearing of masks and costumes. In addition, hiowever, it has preserved certain ancient features wlhich link it witlh Russia's pagani past. The cuilminatilng highlight of the Maslenitsa festival is the carrying in procession and eventlual destruction (by drowning, bturninig, or burial) of Winter, symbolically repre- sented by an imlage or puppet of straw or wood, called variotusly larilo, Chuchilo, or Cludo.18 The religious overtones of this ceremony are obviotus. 15.

Rusalia and Kupalo, the two festivals dominating the spring cycle, were originally celebrated as one, at the time of the summer solstice in June. After the introduction of Christianity in 988 the churclh tried to substitute Trinity Sunday and the Feast of Saint John the Baptist for the pagan rituals associated with this part of the calendar year. As frequently happened in such cases, instead of supplanting the pagan rites the two church feasts became identified with them-Trinity Sunday with Rusalia and Saint John's Day with Kupalo. Both Rusalia and Kupalo bear a strong resemblance to Maslenitsa in at least one important respect. In both, puppetlike straw images provide the focal point for the rites associated with them. The Rusalia festival is particularly rich in music ancld dance. Much circle dancing and choral singing (performied simultaneously and called kzhorovody) takes place. This culminates in a tug of war in the open fields over the rutsalka puppet, wlhich is eventually torn apart and scattered to the four winds, making the world safe for another year from these menacing female spirits.19 In some regions the straw puppet is burned or drowned.20 In the ceremonies for Kupalo, in addition to music and dance, fortune- telling and leaping through open bonfires by youing, unnmarried couples provide the most characteristic diversion. A male and numerous female straw puppets are made for the occasion. Because the young men repeatedly "abduct" the female puppet, the girls must make new ones to replace her. Eventually the puppet couple, "Kupalo" and "Marena," are either torn and scattered about or drowned.21 It should be readily apparent, even from this abbreviated description of the important annual festivals whiclh for centuries dominated the calendar year of the Eastern Slavs,22 that puppets and masks played an integral part 19. The Rusalki were reputed to be the spirits of drowning victims, premature babies, and infants who died unbaptized (the latter sometimes also called Mavki). In the spring they roamed about the fields and allegedly tickled people to death or drowned those who went near water. 20. A good description of the tug of war and scattering of the rusalka puppet is provided by A. Veselovsky in his article "Genvarskiia rusalii i gotskiia igry v Vizantii," Zhurnal Miniistcrstva narodnago prosveshcheniia, September 1885, p. 4. Other methods of disposing of the puppet are described by Vsevolodsky-Gerngross, Istoriia ruisskogo teatra, 2 vols. (Moscow and Leningrad, 1929), 1:169-70. Special songs for Rusalia can be found in P. P. Chubinsky, comp. and ed., Trudy Etnzografichesko-statisticheskoi ekspeditsii v -apadno-rutsskii krai, vol. 3 (St. Petersburg, 1872), pp. 187-92. 21.

Furtlhermore, it is probably no accident that tlle skomioroklhi, wlho had tlheir origin in tlhe popular pagan cult of anicient Rus', were also tlhe first Russiani ptippet masters.23 Together witlh tlhe volkhzfy, who constittited the official priestlhood of pre-Clhristian Rus', tlhe skomtorokhi were intimllately involved in the cult of the people witlh its wealth and diversity of ritual. As formler priests or ctult leaders tlhey were tlhe logical inhleritors of the "ptuppets" or images whiclh were an imlportaint part of tllat rittual and whiclh, after tlhe introduction- of Clhristianity, became, like the slkomorokhi tlhemselves, anatlhenma to the clhturcl.4 Whlat the skw';'lorokhi "inherited" was more an idea or teclhniquie, anad not necessarily, as tlhe foregoing sentenlce may imply, a physical pantlheoln of antlhropolmiorplhic deities which tlley hastenled, rather sacrilegiotusly, to convert on stage iinto less thlani divinie anad often vtilgar-ptuppets. The relation of the skomnorokhi to tlhe ptuppet seems quiite natural in yet another way. As Veselovsky lhas so metictulotusly demonstrated, tlle modern Russian word for ptuppet, 'ukia,25 did not always refer to a marionette.26 As late as the ninleteelntlh centtury it lhad in certain regions, notably the provinces of Orlovsk anad Pskov, the connotationa of sorcery or witchcraft.27 It may be that tlhe klekla or ptuppet was originally uised by the skoviorokhi, who were sometimes looked uponl as warlocks, as a meditulm for inflictinlg harm oI1 their iz zemli Polian," Sovetsklaia asrkhlcologiia, 4 (1962): 66-89, brilliantly anid coniclusively demonstrated that the anniual agrarian festivals of the proto-Slavs can be traced back at least to the fourth century A.D. 23. I. Beliaev was the first to postulate the thleory that the skoniorokhi were niative in origin, with roots deep in early Russiani paganiismii. See "O skomorokhakih," Vrcniennik Iniperatorskaqo obshchcstva istorii i dr1vniostei rossuiskikh, 20 (1854) : 70-71. A. Afanasev elaborates on this theme in the first volume of his Pocticheskiia zozzrciiia Slav'iawn 11a prirodut (Moscow, 1865), pp. 336-39. 24. It is obvious that some of the images or "puppets" which had origilnally been the focal point of religious worship amonig the Eastern Slavs contillued to be used, in spite of official proscription, even to recent timnes in conjunctioni withi some of the cyclic festivals of the countryside. 25. The earliest reference to the Old Slavolnic word kukla occurs in the fifteenth- century edition of the tenth-cenitury Bulgarian Klironlografiia foanla Malaliv, in which the original Greek Tov OXTIVULZXV (meaniing "of the stage," "theatrical") is rendered as kukla.

The word kutkla does not appear in any native Russian source until the early seventeelnth century. Here it also carries the broad connotationi of "theatrical performance," in the Greek sense of the term, anid appears to be borrowed from Canoni 51 of the Trullan Church Council (Constan- tinol)le, 692), where mimes and theaters are singled out for censure.

Illustrating tlhis is a story dating from the seventeelnth century attributed to Simon Azarin, an elder of the Trinity- Sergius Monastery. In a village not far from the lmaonastery a band of sk.om,torokehi had given a performance at the conclusioil of which they passed tlhe lhat aroulnd, so to speak, for volulntary donations. A certaini woman in the audience refused to make a dolnation, wlhereupon, says tlhe author, the skomo- rokzhi cast a spell on her, making her deathly ill, and warned of even worse evils that would befall her.28 Thus a progression from pagan religious rite to secular marionette seems to have occurred almaong the Eastern- Slavs just as it did, according to Baird, il a number of other early societies.29 The question that remains is when the skomorolkhi first begani using puppets for noniritualistic, entertainment purposes. Was it, as some have suggested, in the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century, shortly before Olearius had chanced upon the seom-orokh-puppeteer wlhom lhe so vividly described in hiis Travels? Our own view is that it was much earlier, as the following discussion should demonstrate. In 1733 there appeared in the Sanket-Peterburgskiia vedomnosti an alnonymous article entitled "O pozorishclhnykh igrakh, ili komediaklh i trage- diakh," in which the author discussed in print for the first time in Russia the characteristics of the kitkol'nyi teatr. Also significant is the author's use of the relatively modern Russian word for puppet, kttkla, to describe one of the theatrical arts included under the general heading of pozorishche (sometimes also po-or). 30 "Among the po-orishchnye igry," he writes, "one must also include the klukol'nye igry in which the performances are given not by live actors but rather by puppets."31 A brief description of the potential range and scope of puppets as actors follows. One will therefore probably search in vain to find early references to the Russian puppet theater under its relatively modern name, 'lutkol'nyi teatr or kitkla.32 This can be further demonstrated by two seventeenth-century docu- ments. In Tsar Aleksei's famous gram,nota of 1648, through which he sought to proscribe all manner of popular festivals and superstitions in Russia, he 28. Simon Azarin, Kniga o chudcsakh pr. Sergiia, ed.

And surely by 1648 and even earlier, as Olearius has so vividly demonstrated in his illustration, the puppet theater had become an important part of a skoniorokh entertainment. Is it not safe to assume, then, that the reference here to pozorishche is in fact a reference to the puppet shows of the skoniorokhi? In an earlier seventeenth-century document, an ntkaz of the Patriarch Filaret dating from 1628, there is also a stern denunciation of all surviving folk games and festivals with pagan overtonies. Among the practices condemned by Filaret is one which can be translated literally as "going about with mares."85 In the Olearius illustration of the skomoroleh entertainment there is a mare pictured on the portable stage which the puppeteer has raised over his head. Furthermore, of some twenty-three surviving original episodes involving the traditional puppet hero Petrushka, twenty refer to his bargaining with a gypsy over a mare.36 Olearius has evidently reproduced one of these most popular of episodes from "Petrushka" in his illustration.87 Consequently, the reference by Filaret to "going about with mares" can be interpreted only as an allusion to the puppet shows of the skomorokhi. Again there is no mention here of kutol'nyi teatr or kukla. In the foregoing digression we have tried to show that even as late as the mid-eighteenth century the term commonly used to refer to puppetry in Russia was pozorishche. Between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries pozo- rishche was used exclusively to render the Greek word for "theater" or "theatrical performance" (Oat-TQov) .38 By 1284 it was no longer used as part 33.

However, in this particular instance we find pozorishche listed along with igrishche, a term long regarded by scholars as an Old Russian equivalent for a dramatic performance usually involving real actors.39 A distinction between po-orishche and igrishche is obviously intended in this thirteenth-century collection of ecclesiastical law from Riazan. According to Vsevolodsky-Gerngross, the common people have always looked upon these two terms as distinct-regarding pozorishche as the forerunner of the moldern word for "theater" (in the sense of performance or spectacle) and igrishche as the early equivalent of "drahia."40 . Sources such as the Povest' vremennykh let contain frequent references to igrishcha in the context of rituial games associated with the primitive cult of the Eastern Slavs.41 As in ancient Greece, these games represent the earliest stage in the evolution of drama in Russia. To this day the popular Russian expression for a wedding (a thoroughly dramatic affair lasting several days, with a traditional cast of characters and a standardized, unwritten script) is igrat' svad'bu. In light of the linguistic and other evidence that we have presented above, is it not possible that the reference in the Korlchaia kniga Riazanskaia to pozorishche is in fact an allusion to a nondramatic theatrical performance, one differing from the igrishche not only in tone and content but also in its reliance on puppets rather than live actors as dramatis personae? And would this not then in effect place the origins of the Russian puppet theater sometime in the late thirteenth rather than the early seventeenth century, as many have alleged ? The early history of the Russian puppet theater is intimately bound up with the history of the skomorokhi, the original Russian puppeteers. By the thirteenth century these itinerant minstrel-entertainers had completely aban- doned the politically strife-torn and somewhat intolerant lands of Kievan Rus' for the much freer atmosphere of Novgorod and its northern territories.42 In northern Russia they continued to flourish, many of them abandoning their vagabond ways for a more settled and secure life on the land or in the town while still continuing to practice their venerable profession. During the second half of the sixteenth century, the center of their activity shifted from Novgorod to Moscow, largely as a result of Ivan IV's Oprichnina and his outright 39.

The Secolnd Novgorod Clhronicle tells us that in September 1572 Ivan ordered all of the skoviorokhi from Novgorod and other nearby towns to be rounded up and, together with their trained bears, transported to Moscow.43 There is no doubt, however, that the skomtorokhi had become a familiar sight throughout the Muscovite lancds, as far east as Kazan in fact, imiucl earlier thain the 1 570s.44 For example, a charter granted by Prince Iurii Vasilievich of Dmitrov OI1 January 14, 1470, to the Trinity-Sergius MXionastery (located some forty-eiglht miles nlorth of Moscow) specifically prohibits the minstrel-entertainers froml performing or entertaiining ill the villages anld hamlets belonging to the monastery.45 Sigismulnd von Herberstein, the ambas saclor of the Holy Romain Empire to Moscow in 1517 and again in 1526, described how some of the itinerant skomiorokhi had died from exposure during the severe winter of 1526.46 And the Stoglav of 1551 warned that they were a cause of great concern among both the people and the authorities, because they traveled about in such great numbers (sixty to a hundred).47 By the 1630s the puppet show had already become an integral part of a skomoroikh entertainIment. Accordiing to Olearitis, "[the Russian] dlaicinlg-bear impresarios have comedians with them, wlho, among other things, arrange farces employing puppets. These comedians tie a blanket around their bodies and spread it above their heads, thus creating a portable stage with whiclh they can run arouncd the streets, and on top of whiclh they can give puppet shows."48 The illustration accompanying this description of a skomiorokh entertainment shows a dancing bear with his trainer, two musicials, one playing an oval g'ttsli and the otlher a gudok, and a puppeteer giving a perfornmance. With respect to the latter, note should be made of the portable stage which lhe is using. It is made by tying a blanket at the waist and, with the lhelp of two wooden poles, raising it over the head. This leaves both of the operator's lhands free to manipulate the hand puppets. This kind of one-man, portable puppet stage seems to be unique to Russia.

The scene depicted on Olearius's stage is obviously taken from an early version of "Petrushka." The hero, Petrushka, is shown bargaining rather vigorously with a gypsy over a mare, while his wife looks on. At least twenty different versions of this scene have survived.49 It is impossible to say what other plays, besides the numerous adventures of Petrushka, were included in the repertoire of the skoniorolh-puppeteers. Much of their original repertoire was, like the byliny and istorichesk?ie pesni which the minstrel-skomiorokhi recited, transmitted orally and never written clown. It is safe to assume, however, that because of the itinerant nature of the prodcuctions, the repertoire would have been limited by the amount of equipment that could be brought along. Shortly after Olearius had witnessed his first skowiorokh entertainment andl puppet show, the fortunes of the Russian minstrel-entertainers took a decided turn for the worse. With some prodding from the ecclesiastical authorities Tsar Aleksei issuedc his famous grazota of 1648, "On the Righting of Morals and the Abolition of Superstition."50 In it he outlawed the skonwo- rokhi and all of their entertainments, which, as we have seen, included the pozorishche or puppet theater. The skomtorolhi never recovered from this blow. The Russian puppet tlheater, on the other hand, not only survived but found new life in Aleksei's own lifetime and during the reign of Peter the Great and his successors. Like so many otlher aspects of Russian society and culture, lhowever, it was subjected to progressively stronger foreign influence and came to lose much of its native character. One learns, for example, that in 1660 a certain Ivan Gebdon, an English merclhant living at court to whom the tsar frequently turned for foreign goods and services, was commissioned by Aleksei to bring back from Germany to Moscow an unspecified number of puppet masters.51 In 1699 a certain Russialn puppeteer (no longer called a skoilnorokh but ratlher a komnediant, a term obviously borrowed from the West) by the name of Ivan Antonovyi was buying his puppets from Denmark. He had ordered thirty of them from a certain Gottfried Kaulitz, who delivered only six, for whiclh breach of contract lhe was severely beaten by Ivan.5' A year later, in 1700, Peter the Great 49.

Some of the surviving playbills from the period bear this out. In 1733 in St. Petersburg, for example, the touring puppet company of Johann Christofor Zigmunld was showing, among others, "Adam and Eve" (a comedy), "The Crucifixion of Christ," "The Life and Death of Don Juan," "King Agasfer and Queen Esfir," "King Admet and the Strength of the MIighty Hercules," and "Princess Florian and the Beautiful Bancefori."55 To what extent native Russian puppeteers or koinedianti, the spiritual successors of the s1komi1orokhi, continued to bring the adventures of Petrushka to the people of the countryside dcuring this period of strong foreign influence is difficult to say. That they did is certain, however, since Petruslhka not only survived this foreign intrusion but, even more important, remained untainted by it. The twenty-three separate episodes about him that have come down to us, in manuscript form, from the nineteenth century attest to that.56 Furtler- more, his very name, like that of Punch in England, has become so closely identified with puppetry in Russia that today the two have become synonymous. To his countrymen Petrushka was and is the Russian puppet theater. on behalf of Kaulitz with Peter, who ordered an investigation into the whole affair, a transcript of which has survived.
