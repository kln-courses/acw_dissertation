<plain_text><page sequence="1">Yam Symbolism in the Sepik: an Interpretative Account DONALD F. TUZIN In this essay yam-oriented beliefs and behavior patterns are analyzed in an effort to understand the symbolic complexities surrounding yams in the Sepik area of New Guinea. It is postulated that the yam is symbolically multivalent with regard to "male pride," "body," and "penis." The symbolic equations linking yams to these referents function, respectively, at the conscious, preconscious, and unconscious levels of individual awareness. In formulating this conceptualization attention is paid to certain results of neurophysiological experimentation and to the relevant clinical findings of psychoanalysis. The resulting model of yam multivalence is applied to the analysis of observed instances of yam-oriented behavior, and it is found to enable in- terpretations of behavior patterns not comprehended in a unidimensional view of yam symbolism. This suggests that the levels of symbolic meaning interact in a mutually reinforcing way and that this dynamism contributes to the persistence of the symbolic complex over time. A MONG the peoples inhabiting the foothills of the Torricelli and Prince Alexander mountains of northern New Guinea, the significance of the yam extends far beyond its value as a staple food. Anthropologists and other social scientists working there have recognized this to such a degree that further comment on the matter would seem destined to tedious restatement. And yet, despite the existence of a few lengthy discussions on yams and many bits of yam lore scattered through the Sepik ethnography, aspects of the phenomenon, in my opinion, have not been fully explored. Using data collected among the Ilahita Arapesh,' I shall examine some of these aspects, beginning with the question of what yams are. What are the characteristics which make the yam such a singular item in the local culture? The answer to this question involves consideration of the elaborate set of beliefs which has evolved around the yam, including a range of symbolic identifications which are manifest at different levels of individual awareness. Analysis of these beliefs in relation to the general issue of symbol etiology suggests a conceptual approach to the phenomenon of the yam which is then applied to the interpretation of yam-oriented behavior patterns.

Beyond their eastern boundary lies the territory of the Abelam, a culture known through the writings of Forge (1962, 1966, 1970a, 1970b), Kaberry (1941, 1941-1942, 1965-1966) and Lea (1964, 1969). Close con- tact with the Abelam over a long period and a similar environmental situa- tion have resulted in many shared features between these cultures, and a cor- responding divergence of the Ilahitans from their linguistic cousins, the Mountain Arapesh (Mead 1935, 1938, 1940, 1947; Fortune 1939, 1942, 1943). The Ilahita Arapesh reside in seven sedentary villages averaging somewhat over 500 inhabitants. Each village is segmented into multi-carpellary wards (Hogbin and Wedgewood 1953:243) that are semi-autonomous in matters of politics and minor ritual. Staple foods include taro, sago, and banana, but the principal and favored food is the yam. The 60-odd varieties of yam are divided by the Arapesh into two general categories which correspond to the species locally prevalent, Dioscorea alata and D. esculenta. D. alata tubers are elongated and smooth, while D. esculenta tubers are squat and covered with tiny rootlets. However, this distinction is ritually less significant than the difference between normal sized tubers of both species and those few D. alata which have been planted under special conditions so that they might produce gigantic offspring, up to nine feet in length (cf. Forge 1966:28; Haynes and Coursey 1969). To simplify the discus- sion, therefore, I shall disregard the species distinction and apply the term "short yam" to both of them. The special D. alata will be referred to as "long yam" while the unattributed term "yam" will be used in a general sense, or where the context makes the referent unambiguous. Space does not permit a full discussion of the technology of yam cultiva- tion;2 however, one point deserves mention for its social and symbolic implica- tions. The high clay content of the soil in this area requires that the earth into which the tuber will grow must first be crushed by hand. In the case of short yams a basin of only 12 to 15 inches depth is so prepared. For long yams the task is much greater: a hole is dug corresponding to the size and shape of the desired yam and the backfill crushed and replaced. Then the seed yam is placed on top of the softened earth, and a large mound of soil is heaped over it (cf. Lea 1964). As the new yam grows it follows the path of least resistance and comes to occupy the refilled hole. With the prominent place of yams in the prestige system, a man without legitimately acquired magic and confidence in his own ritual potency is unlikely to expend the effort needed to produce a long yam. Thus, technology has operated tradi- 2 See Lea (1966) for a concise description of Abelam yam-growing, a technological system closely similar to that of the Ilahita Arapesh. Coursey (1967) has produced a defin- itive botanical analysis of the genus Dioscorea; in a more recent work Coursey and Coursey (1971) discuss the ethnobotanical features of the New Yam festivals of West Africa.</page><page sequence="3">232 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY tionally to favor for high status those individuals who already possessed the main attributes of leadership. The introduction of steel implements (espe- cially shovels) in the late 1930's changed the situation and, so grieve the old "big men," today practically anyone can (and will) try to plant a long yam. In the wild state yams evolve through the natural mechanisms of cross- pollination, but after domestication by man their form is controlled and their genotype fixed under technologically directed vegetative propagation. It is likely that the long-yam varieties were originally adopted for their mag- nitude, rather than taste or texture, and that for this virtue they are carefully preserved by man against extinction or evolutionary modification. Thus the interaction of selective adoption and preservation, technology, and cultural constraints as to who may plant long yams has produced an object esteemed above all others as the symbol of male pride and prestige (Forge 1966; Kaberry 1965-1966; Lea 1969). Men may achieve renown for the production of short yams or long yams or both. If the former, the emphasis is on abundance; and with the daily care of the gardens largely in female hands, polygyny is a decided asset to a status-aspiring male. The long yams, in contrast, are exclusively the male's domain. The gardens are heavily charmed against intruders, rigidly taboo to women, and located away from beaten paths. Here the emphasis is on the size, shape, skin texture, and purity of the individual tuber. Equivalent value is given to the straight "male" yams and the "female" yams which are forked or many-appendaged.3 Kaberry (1941-1942, 1965-1966) has written on the place of yams in Abelam political behavior and the emergence of leaders, and most of her remarks would apply as well to the Ilahita Arapesh. Here I need only men- tion that the difference between short and long yams is reflected in the com- petitive spheres in which they are used. Competition with short yams is a relatively mild affair, occurring at the local ward level or, occasionally, be- tween disputing wards within the same village. Contests with long yams, on the contrary, are known to be potentially serious as a substitute for overt violence. Today long-yam competitions are countenanced only between enemy villages; their absence in the field of intra-village disputes is the result of a social reform enacted a number of years ago. About 1948 a heated long-yam competition between two wards of Ilahita village was followed by a number of deaths in each of the contending groups. It was believed that these deaths were caused by sorcery resulting from hatreds aggravated by the competition. 3 The association of straightness with maleness has its basis in penis imagery, just as forking is likened to a female's spread legs. The same symbolism characterizes straight versus forked or bushy trees, and straight versus meandering streams.</page><page sequence="4">YAM SYMBOLISM IN THE SEPIK 233 A meeting of village elders decided that, thereafter, inter-ward competitions would occur with long yams only if the head and the base of each had been previously amputated. The symbolic potency of the whole yam, as an object of competition, was so intense that it threatened to tear the village apart.4 The differential use of short and long yams may be seen, therefore, as an index of their symbolic charges, of the tolerance limits within which conven- tional competition must operate if social disruption is to be avoided. On the basis of this brief introduction to yams as symbols of male pride one might fairly ask, why yams? Although symbolization derives from intra- psychic processes, the selection of a given object for symbolic attribution does not seem to be arbitrary, but is based on certain characteristics which appear to "invite" such treatment. The most general characteristic in the case of the yam is that it is biologically alive, possessing the ability to grow and repro- duce itself in the relatively short period of five to seven months. Where an object is related symbolically to something as abstract as "male pride," its "aliveness" confers on it no necessary advantage in terms of the symbolic operation. For example, ropes of shell valuables function quite adequately as symbols of pride and prestige among the Tolai of New Britain (Epstein 1969:243). When, however, the symbolic referent is both concrete and alive itself-for instance, a part or the whole of the human body-complications arise in making a symbolic association with an inanimate object. For ex- ample, the Arapesh imbue stones with symbolic meaning, but they first vitalize these objects by regarding them as the petrifications of parts or the wholes of mythical (animate) beings. Once ideationally transformed the stone may be subjected to further symbolic treatment. An object such as a yam, which is already alive, can be related directly to the live referent without the necessity of an intermediate symbolic operation. If yams possess a virtue in being alive, they share this with numerous other entities in the phenomenal world. But, unlike other living species available to the Arapesh, the yam's growth is highly subject to determination by man. The cultivated yam is, to this extent, a cultural artifact. Trees, snakes, and pigs are animate and have symbolic associations, but man can little affect the size and shape to which they grow. By imposing his personal nuances onto the magic, taboo, and technology involved in producing a long yam, the indi- 4 This suggests that yam competition was an innovation formulated only shortly before this reform and that the big men were, so to speak, still experimenting with it. Kaberry reports (1941-1942:344) that yam competitions followed the cessation of traditional warfare and are a functional substitute for armed violence. My data show that intra-village yam competitions had existed before European contact, but with the Pax Australiana they were intensified and extended to include relations with enemy villages. This development, in turn, affected the functioning of the institution within the village, resulting in the need for social reform.</page><page sequence="5">234 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY vidual may in the end regard the magnificent tuber as something truly his own, the creation of his planning and his power, his art. The stage is set for strong identification of a man with his yam, a phenomenon implied by the term he will often use in reference to it, "my child" (cf. Forge 1966:28; Kaberry 1941:356). In addition, yams can be eaten. Their function as food provides a good practical reason for keeping them around, growing them, talking about them. The suitability of yams as prestige emblems is enhanced by their capacity to store well (up to eight months), so that a man may display his entire year's harvest on a single occasion. And, while environmental condi- tions are generally favorable to yam cultivation, so that a skilled gardener can depend on a reasonable harvest, there are enough uncontrollable factors present to make the difference between competence and excellence largely a matter of chance.5 It should also be noted that, among the Arapesh, yams are the only plant whose growth is believed subject to magical governance; not surprisingly, they are the only plants with spirits. Thus it can be seen that the natural characteristics and potentialities of the yam make it an entity that is unique in the phenomenal world of the Arapesh, and peculiarly apposite to its role as the main symbol of male pride and prestige. With this empirical base Arapesh ideology has gone on to ex- tend the yam's uniqueness in ways that Nature never intended. III As well as being alive biologically, yams are endowed by the Arapesh with inherent spirits (cf. Coursey 1967:203). These spirits are believed to have an affinity with the man who has planted them; they can recognize him by his characteristic odor and the tread of his feet. As the tubers grow their spirits also develop, so that by harvest time their supernatural maturity is attained and they behave as independent beings. Thus, while to an outsider a short- yam garden immediately before harvest is a desolate place, with leaves shrivelled and no trace of former lushness, to the Arapesh it is now really coming alive. Under the earth the yam spirits are moving about, visiting friends and kinsmen in their own and other gardens, leading active lives which are in most respects human. The subjective aspect of these yam beliefs is difficult to convey and requires participating somewhat in Arapesh ide- ology; but an appreciation of it is part of understanding the behavioral correlates. 5 Relevant here is William Clarke's suggestion (personal communication) that the yam's strong seasonality, with clearly defined growth phases, and the rather narrow micro- environmental range within which it flourishes conduce to the view that the tubers may behave somewhat capriciously. Hence the elaboration of magical techniques for controlling them.</page><page sequence="6">YAM SYMBOLISM IN THE SEPIK 235 Short-yam spirits do not communicate with men, but it is understood from "experience" that they do not want to be harvested. If the spirits get an inkling that the owner is about to unearth them, they will flee the garden and leave the harvest team to poke about in the empty soil. To insure that this does not happen ancestral spirits are magically invoked on the eve of the harvest to use their influence in keeping the unruly yam spirits contained in the garden. The impishness of the short-yam spirits is a striking contrast to the sobriety of the long yams. No artifice is needed to remove them from the ground; indeed, they literally summon their grower to harvest by sending bird and insect auguries. Informants imagine that their ancestors' shades while away many ghostly hours in the long-yam gardens in grave comradeship with the spirits of the long yams. This close association of long-yam spirits with ances- tral ghosts blurs the conceptual distinction between them. Arapesh feelings toward them are strongly ambivalent: both are usually beneficent, sometimes terrifying, but always powerful. Parental ghosts can kill and devour the living, and in some vaguely defined way the long-yam spirits have come to share these negative traits; they can, for example, bring sickness down on humans-particularly women and children. Comparing the alleged behavior of short and long yams we may note that both are closely associated with ancestral ghosts and, as such, exhibit a capriciousness over which man has, at best, tenuous control. In the short yams this capriciousness is a nuisance to their grower; in the long yams, it is menacing.6 The trinity of yam, ancestor, and man is, in Arapesh conceptualization, spiritually confluent. The blending of semen and untapped menstrual blood forms a fetus which is the spiritual amalgam of mother and father, and the basis of an essential link between the infant and the living dead. This link is fortified throughout the life of the individual as he ingests yams which are themselves descendants of the yams his ancestors planted and ate. During digestion, part of the yam is absorbed for physical growth and renewal, part is excreted, and the spiritual essence of the yam is released to find its way to the okom (heart), the source of being and emotion. Eating yams is a mystical as well as physical act, and in sharing their ancestral yams a married couple is engaging in a form of spiritual communion. Similarly, betrothal ideally should occur while a girl is still immature, so that her future parents-in-law may feed her and contribute to her growth. Through the yams she develops a spiritual unity with her husband and his agnatic group which is considered the basis of behavioral harmony. 6 Informants were unable to say whether forked "female" yams have feminine spirits, but I suspect (in the absence of evidence to the contrary) that their spirits are also masculine. Short-yam spirits, in their ideational resemblance to human children, are viewed as virtually asexual with only a slight tendency towards masculinity.</page><page sequence="7">236 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY The relationship between yams and marriage practices is founded on the notion that yams have pedigrees of their own. Newlyweds are given a supply of yams by both sets of parents sufficient to feed them until they harvest their own first garden.7 Specimens from each of the two lots of yams are set aside for later planting, and form the basis of the couple's lifetime of yam cultiva- tion. At this time, and for years afterwards, each of the yams harvested by the couple must be carefully marked to show whether it is descended from the wife's lot or the husband's lot. The sharing of vital fluids involved in sexual intercourse establishes a spiritual harmony between an individual and his spouse's yams which permits each of the parties to relate to the other's ances- tral yams. One purpose served in keeping the yams separate is that in the event of marital dissolution there is no confusion over the disposal of yam property. If divorce occurs the estranged wife takes possession of her own yams and remains economically self-reliant. If either spouse dies before they have had children, the immediate agnates of the deceased take over his or her yams which can yet flourish because of the consanguinity of the deceased and the receiving group. When divorce or death occurs where there are children it is the duty of the surviving spouse, or of the respective agnatic descent group, to hold the yam line in trust and prevent its extinction until the children marry and assume their birthright. The marriage of the couple's first child marks the beginning of the final phase of their married life; from this point only token attempts are made to keep the yams separate. Divorce is unthinkable and death no longer matters; for all practical purposes the spirits of the old couple and the spirits of their yams have fused. The preceding discussion suggests a symbolic link between "yam" and "human body" which is also expressed in the general anthropomorphism of the tubers. Aside from the spiritual and "behavioral" traits already men- tioned, physical resemblance between man and yam is accented in styles of adornment. The finale of each of the several initiation rites occurs when the novices are arrayed in wealth and finery and presented for public approval. The towering headdresses and lavish use of leaves, shells, and feathers have the effect of enhancing the beauty and size of the festooned figure. When long yams are displayed the same materials are used, with painted designs on the tuber's skin representing belts, armlets, shell ornaments, genitalia, and the like. "Male" yams are lined in "standing" position along the inside wall of 7 Neither set of parents may accept back any of these yams for fear that the presumedly avid sex activity of the newlyweds has ritually defiled them, and that when persons past sexual prime eat them old age will advance more quickly. This prohibition persists until the birth of the newlyweds' first child, whereupon the post-partum taboo on sex makes the yams safe and edible by the parents-in-law.</page><page sequence="8">YAM SYMBOLISM IN THE SEPIK 237 the display house, while "female" yams are hung from horizontal poles and decorated with the motifs and fancy netbags used when girls come out of puberty seclusion. At display times, therefore, the symbolic body-yam equa- tion is perhaps most explicit.8 The final evidence in support of the yam-body equation concerns the alleged effect on the tubers of female sexual and menstrual fluids. Ritual antipathy between female sexuality and yams is common among yam-growing peoples and leads to a prohibition against sexual intercourse during part or all of the yam's growth phase. Some writers have invoked this antipathy and the accompanying avoidances as evidence for yam phallicism (Forge 1966:28; Kaberry 1965-1966:340). Such a view would apply as well to Arapesh yams which are believed to abhor the smell of female sexual secretions present on a man's body after intercourse. But yams are also repulsed by menstrual con- tact, and a man who takes food from a menstruating woman is jeopardizing his harvest for that year. Moreover, the man is risking his general health by eating such food, and if he has sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman the bodily damage resulting may be grievous or even fatal. The symptoms of such affliction are short-windedness and loss of general muscle tone, both signs of old age. The important point is that menstrual pollution is believed to affect a man's entire body, and only by implication his penis; as representations of the man's entire body, his yams will suffer simultaneously. Thus the avoidances relating to female sexuality indicate the multivalence of yam symbolism: sexual intercourse is involved with the yam-penis equa- tion, menstruation with the yam-body equation.9 Given the strength of the yam-man identification, an attack on one's yams will be treated as an attack on oneself. Patterns of abuse would make no sense if this were not so. On numerous instances I observed quarrels between men and women; these involved unrelated persons as well as members of domestic units. Whatever the specific cause of the uprising the nature of the abuse was highly predictable and varied little from one case to the next. Where the couple are not related, feminine tears of humiliation are best 8 Short yams are exhibited somewhat differently, with the aim of displaying their quantity rather than quality to maximum advantage. Anthropomorphism is evident but to a much lesser extent than with the long yams. Applying the "yam = body" equation to this, and recalling the appellation "child" used for these yams, I would suggest that the symbolic referent of short-yam display is the fecundity of the man and, by inference, his wife. 9 This distinction breaks down when "penis" and "body" overlap as symbolic referents. For instance, excessive sexual activity is thought to produce the same symptoms in a man as those resulting from contact with menstruation. This would also damage the yams-but in their symbolic capacity as "body" or as "penis"? The implication is that underlying or co-existent with the two symbols discussed in the text there is the additional equation "body = penis," a phenomenon not uncommonly reported in the psychoanalytic literature. See Fenichel (1955), Ferenczi (1955), Lewin (1933) and Sandler (1959).</page><page sequence="9">238 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY induced by a tirade referring to her licentious, capacious, smelly, and other- wise revolting vagina. To this the woman retorts that the man is incapable of producing long or abundant yams, and the few miserable specimens of which he boasts were illicitly grown with the help of his ritually more potent affines. Between husband and wife the pattern is reversed, and understandably so for the accusations above would here rebound on the accuser. The man would be admitting to a lack of control over his wife's sexual conduct, and the woman would have to share the blame for her husband's poor yams. Thus the husband condemns his wife for her laziness, or for careless habits during her monthly periods which have ritually endangered his long yams. Even when a man upbraids her for adultery he phrases the complaint in economic terms, because the main consequence of wifely adultery is thought to be the ruin of her family's gardens. The wife replies by screaming to all listeners that her husband is a sexual shell; he cannot satisfy her for he is old and white- haired and balding and his penis has no strength. That yam abuse and sexual abuse are replies to one another in a single context, and that they are functionally interchangeable in varying contexts, supports the proposed "yam - penis" symbolic equation. So too does the belief that yams possess erectile potential, that while in the ground they respond to external stimuli (a footstep or sexual odor) by sudden tumescence or detumescence. Harvests are planned for the early morning when, it is alleged, the yams are in their naturally most tumescent state. It should also be noted that the downward "penetrating" action of a growing long yam is suggestive of sexual symbolism.10 The interpretation that "yam" symbolizes "penis" is, therefore, based on what yams are and what, in Arapesh ideology, they are believed to be. Still unattended is the more fundamental question: how do we account for the peculiar notion that one's penis can somehow be "out there," that it can be symbolically projected onto an external object? To approach this issue it is necessary to consider the relationship of a man to his own penis. IV One of the more remarkable properties of the penis is its ability to become erect or slack independently of the will of its owner. Masters and Johnson (1970:11) have noted that "no man can will, wish, or demand an erection." The obverse can be no less disconcerting: as one middle-aged Arapesh man put it, the main advantage of trousers over the traditionally nude state is that such untoward events can be better concealed (cf. Klausner 1965). 10 Forge (1966:31) mentions the Abelam belief that long yams are believed to secrete an invisible substance comparable to semen.</page><page sequence="10">YAM SYMBOLISM IN THE SEPIK 239 The neurophysiology of this phenomenon has been investigated by Mac- Lean and Ploog (1962:29), who found that "electrical or chemical stimulation of certain parts of the limbic system resulted in penile erection" in squirrel monkeys, a species whose brain anatomy resembles that of Homo sapiens. Sometimes called the "reptilian brain," the limbic system is phylogenetically old, predating in vertebrate evolution the elaboration of the neocortex. This region is influenced-but not controlled-by input received from the neo- cortex, such as visual stimuli associated with sexual response. In other words the experiential fact that the penis may behave somewhat autonomously of the "will" is a reflection of similar autonomy exercised by neural activity in the limbic system vis-i-vis processes occurring in the neocortex. Moreover, it has been found that artificial stimulation of the limbic system may also arouse in the animal behavioral responses characteristic of aggression and feeding (MacLean 1963). Indeed, the accumulating evidence in this field has led many students to the view that "activity in this [limbic] system forms the neural basis of our emotional experience" (Smith 1970:248).11 These studies indicate that there is a physiological basis to the strong emotional tie of a man to his penis, and also that the penis is largely beyond his conscious control-an experience which appears in cultural contexts as the "penis as maverick" theme in mythology. One bawdy Arapesh myth recalls the days when men had very long penises. One man pursued the anti-social habit of sending his penis on long underground excursions in search of unsus- pecting women. Once it entered a woman when she was in the process of bathing and she, having presence of mind and a bamboo razor, cut it off. The man died as a result, but so did the woman for she forgot to remove the head (glans penis) from her vagina and it rotted inside her. Since then men have not had long penises. Castrative notions aside, the story clearly portrays the penis as part of, and yet apart from, the male body. The head of the penis was acting quite inde- pendently from the man at the other end of it; moreover, after the man had been detached and had died, the head of the penis became the avenger by destroying the woman. A behavioral manifestation of the "maverick" theme is contained in an historical incident whose authenticity is confirmed by eyewitnesses. Around 1930 a group of young men successfully raided an enemy camp, and a woman of the camp was speared in the groin. Immediately after the enemy were routed the victors gathered to remove the spear from the woman's body, a 11 These studies suggest a new relevance for the work of Freud, who, it will be remembered, began his career as a neurologist and maintained the conviction that the psychic mechanisms he postulated for sexuality and the unconscious had, ultimately, physio- logical bases (Jones 1961:194). For further discussions on this subject see Fisher (1965) and Smith (1970:344ff.).</page><page sequence="11">240 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY difficult operation since the bamboo blade had splintered upon entry. An added complication was that the woman's vulva was necessarily in full view of the operator, and each man who tried to remove the blade had to retire because of the distraction of an inopportune erection. The comic element of the situation was appreciated by all those present-except the woman who was bleeding to death. Finally, someone ingeniously suggested blindfolding the operator. The blade was removed forthwith. Thus the penis is seen as a capricious thing to which, for better or worse, a man is emotionally and physically committed. The neurophysiological autonomy of penile behavior accords with the facts of experience and the forms of mythological fantasy. A plausible inference is that these dimensions are causally linked, and that together they provide a basis for the otherwise outrageous idea that the penis can be symbolically projected on to an external object. When such symbolization occurs we might expect the external object to take on some of the affect characteristics of the penis. From evidence already presented and yet to come, we may say that this is precisely what has happened in the case of yam ideology. The strong emotional attachment of the Arapesh to their yams, corres- ponding to their significance as phallic and body symbols, is powerfully re- vealed when yams are physically attacked. This is a grave action, the effects of which are potentially disastrous, for the spirits of the yams are liable to flee the area forever. I recorded three contexts in which attacks upon yams occur, one of which I shall reserve for later comment. At times of utmost despair or frustration, women contemplate suicide, and on rare occasions hang themselves. Under similar stress a man, to whom the notion of literal male suicide is inconceivable, may commit a symbolic form of self-aggression by hacking his yams to pieces (cf. Lea 1964:142). This act is potentially social suicide for it betokens the man's withdrawal from dom- inance contests and the pursuit of social renown. The remainder of his life, it is said, may be spent in parasitic attachment to the household of a kinsman. More often he pulls out of his depressed state, acquires seed yams from his agnates, and begins producing again. It is only by the grace of the ancestral and yam spirits that he will succeed in making a new start; and, informants explained, one can never be sure that such grace will be forthcoming.12 The involvement of yams with intense emotional states is well illustrated in the curious ritual a man performs when circumstances have pushed him beyond the limits of self-restraint. With great solemnity he selects a sizeable 12 One wooden-faced old man named Lawank ("tree") was widely renowned as a yam- grower. In cantankerous moods he would occasionally drag a few yams out of his storehouse and administer to them a public beating. Marvelled my informant, "He has such power the yam spirits are afraid to abandon him!"</page><page sequence="12">YAM SYMBOLISM IN THE SEPIK 241 short yam and places it on a small inadequate fire. When the fire is exhausted he removes the yam from the embers, eats part of it, and intones to those around him, "I have eaten this yam and it is still raw." At that he leaves to perform the deed which has become unavoidable: he may ravage his own garden, or murder his wife, or present himself in an enemy village for spearing.13 The following example shows how the identification of a man with his yams makes him easy prey to the depredations of his wife. On the morning of July 2, 1970 neighborhood attention was drawn to a quarrel between Lango and his wife, Sala'uwa, whose house was located just downhill from my own. The argument concerned the alleged laziness of Sala'uwa and raged on for about 30 minutes before a grudging agreement was reached and the couple went sullenly off toward their garden. The crowd dispersed. I was just reach- ing my house with a young male companion, Salalaman, when I glanced back down the hill in time to see Sala'uwa dashing back through the village with a bush-knife in her hand. Salalaman's brow suddenly became very smooth, and he plunged down the hill into Lango's yam house instants after Sala'uwa had entered it. He dragged her sputtering and clawing from the house and calmly replaced the palm-spathe sheets which covered the entrance. Then Salalaman took her by the hand to where she had left Lango, sad and re- signed with his head in his hands. Sala'uwa was grabbed before she could get at the yams; and it was a good thing, the gossipers agreed later, for she might have permanently driven the yam spirits away. Of course, she herself would have suffered if the subsistence prosperity of her family had languished, but in her aggressive state this seemed a small price to pay for the satisfaction of revenge. In the light of the "yam = penis" equation, her act may be interpreted as an attempted sym- bolic castration of her husband. At the "yam = body" level, the act is a form of redirected aggression: she is doing to the yams what she would like to do to her husband's body. But perhaps most salient in this particular case is that Sala'uwa's action was a deliberate attempt to degrade her husband socially. Her success would have meant (potentially) the ruin of Lango's prospects for social advance. Lango's passive response was perhaps due to his presumption that someone in the vicinity would surely have thwarted her. Or perhaps his attitude derived from the realization that, with all the opportunities available to her, if a woman wants to injure her husband in this way there is nothing he can do to stop her. 13 Informants were unable to provide an interpretation that links the act of eating the yam, the ritual utterance, and the desperate deed. From what has been said regarding digestion beliefs a possible explanation-in Arapesh terms-is that some noxious substance contained in the semi-cooked yam reaches the okom and excites emotional forces located there, thus producing the aggressive frame of mind needed to carry out the deed.</page><page sequence="13">242 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY This case indicates that the three levels of yam symbolism (penis, body, male pride) may all be present and in concert in any given instance of yam- oriented belief or behavior, and that a complete analysis of the phenomena cannot arbitrarily neglect any of them.14 Furthermore, in evaluating the relative balance and interplay of these reference fields, observational data on behavior exhibited toward the symbolic object are as important to the analysis as cultural ideology and social context. Such behavior may range from a chortle to a violent attack, depending on the symbolic object and the context in which it is perceived. To the extent that this behavior is appro- priate to the symbol, as culturally defined, it affirms the symbolic value and contributes the essential input which the object needs for continued or en- hanced symbolic vitality. This view appears to underlie Forge's (1966) analysis in which he regards Sepik art as a symbolic medium carrying socially important "messages," among them, "the ultimate identity of man, long yam and spirit" (Forge 1966:30). He observes, however, that although these mes- sages are "relevant to and essential for the existing social structure," they "may not be totally conscious in either the creators or the beholders of the art . . ." (Forge 1966:30). The implications of this statement must now be considered. V Psychoanalytic studies have built a sizeable literature on the subject of unconscious symbols: how and why they become repressed, their relationship to the "real" world, and the ways in which they may intrude themselves into conscious thought and behavior. But symbols repressed in the unconscious should be distinguished from symbols such as "the dove is a symbol of peace." No one (in their right mind) would argue that the dove is peace, for this would be nonsense. The problem is that, although psychologists use the term "symbol" with reference to fetish objects and obsessive-compulsive behavior, they are dealing with something which is of a different order from symbols of the dove-peace variety. For in terms of the psychological (internal) reality of the person experiencing the repressed symbolic association, the relation between object and referent is one of identity and not of representation. 14 Bateson makes the general observation that, among the Iatmul of the Middle Sepik, "phallic symbols are to be regarded, not simply as symbols of the genital organ, nor as symbols of fertility, but rather as symbols of the whole proud ethos of the males" (1936:163). This recognition stems from his earlier study of flute symbolism in that culture (Bateson 1935). Bateson errs, in my opinion, by presuming that priorities exist between elements in the flute's symbolic field, that "male pride" is somehow more profound than, and indeed subsumes, "penis." This leads him to prejudge the analysis of other symbols and assign to them undemonstrated connotations (1936:163). Moreover, Bateson seems not to notice that certain recorded behavior is patently inconsistent with his primary referent; if flutes are primarily symbols of "male pride," it must be asked why the men expressed shame rather than anger when missionaries revealed them to the women (1935:164).</page><page sequence="14">YAM SYMBOLISM IN THE SEPIK 243 Segal (1957) makes the same distinction in her discussion of the ontogeny of symbols. She proposes that phallic symbols of identity result from repressed phallic associations established in early childhood which, in the course of socialization and psychic ontogeny, have come to be projected onto objects in the external world. These differ markedly from symbols of representation where the external object's separate nature is recognized and not distorted by unconscious fantasies concerning its referent. This distinction as it applies to Arapesh cultural phenomena is illustrated in the contrast between the symbolic connotations of spears and yams. On the evidence these may both be recognized as "phallic symbols." However, the Arapesh do not view it this way. To them the spear does indeed symbolically represent the phallus, with all of the ribald delight this recognition conveys. An adolescent going for an evening's flirtations will be asked leeringly by the old men if he has properly sharpened his spear. Similarly, a young man gos- siping over an illicit conquest will with mocking innocence admit, "Yes, I used my spear, but I did not draw blood. It is not a matter for the slit-gong (i.e., a cause for public announcement)." Upon being asked if this meant that during battle warriors were threatening the enemy with their "penises," in- formants agreed that this was perhaps so, but the idea was clearly not inter- esting to them. On the face of it, the case for establishing the yam-penis equation seems even stronger. The data presented earlier indicated that yams look like penises, in many ways they are believed to "act" like penises, and they are the prime objects of male pride. In addition, the ingredients of yam magic (snakes, eels, vines, etc.) are themselves phallically charged. But the associa- tion of yam with penis is even more direct than this. Supalo is a middle-aged "big-man" who, during 20 months as my neighbor in the village, had become a valuable informant by virtue of his intelligence and candor. With my fieldwork drawing to a close, Supalo sang to me a song which is customarily heard at display times in praise of the long yam of each man in turn. The re- peating chorus is: O what a long penis Gwawi has, O what a long penis Gwawi has. Kwasuwi [his wife] will clean the stinging red ants Off Gwawi's penis.15 (Repeat for each man and his wife.) Prior to this occasion I had, over many months of inference and oblique questioning, satisfied myself that the "yam = penis" equation was not con- 15 This is a euphemism for sexual intercourse and relates to the lifting of sex taboos following the yam harvest.

Supalo's song came close to being an ex- plicit statement of the symbolic association and, to test the strength of the psychological defenses keeping the equation repressed, I suggested to Supalo that his song indicated a symbolic equation between yam and penis. With good-natured firmness he put me off, saying that in the song "penis" was only a figure of speech. He then described the ways yams could, in fact, be symbolized. Sometimes when we know someone has a large yam in his garden we say, "There is a great python in Supalo's garden; let us go catch him." Or, sometimes, "An enormous tree has just fallen on Supalo. We must make a stretcher and go rescue him." Or else, if we see Supalo return from his garden wearing red and black body paint and bearing his huge ceremonial spear, then we know he is telling us that he has a yam waiting to be harvested. It is characteristic of Supalo (and other proud men) that he would, in his hypothetical examples, cast himself as the person with the long yam. At other times Supalo had told me of dreams where he saw his father's ghost walking with a long spear on his shoulder. This Supalo took to be an excellent omen of a fine long yam waiting to be harvested. In subsequent interviews with other informants it was found that they too rejected the notion that the long yam symbolizes the penis. The analytical problem is clear: why is it that while members of this culture are cognizant of a range of phallic symbols, they are positively disinclined to recognize the phallic significance of the long yam which, on ideological and behavioral evidence, is demonstrably a phallic symbol? In my view the answer must be that the two categories of symbols are operating at different orders of individ- ual awareness, that the "positive disinclination" of the informants expresses the unconscious and deeply repressed nature of yam phallicism. The psycho- analytic implication, following Segal, is that the yam is unconsciously felt to be the penis and that primary process activities concerning the penis reveal themselves in symbolic contexts through this unconscious identity. The pre- cise character and etiology of these primary process activities is a subject be- yond the scope of this paper; what matters is that the repressed nature of yam phallicism is evidence of their existence and that this has consequences for yam-oriented behavior.'6 16 Leach (1958) has argued against studies which apply psychoanalytic universals to ethnographic material and assert on a priori grounds that a given cultural symbol represents the "return of the repressed." I agree that such deductive approaches, while often illumi- nating, are not logically relevant to the anthropological task. When,however, it can be inferred from the empirical data that a particular symbolic association is repressed (e.g., "yam = penis") then the consequences of this for behavior related to this symbol cannot be ignored; in such cases psychoanalytic concepts are a valid aid to the symbolic analysis. For an approach to the analysis of ritual symbols which is at marked variance to the one proposed here, see Turner (1964).</page><page sequence="16">YAM SYMBOLISM IN THE SEPIK 245 With regard to the other category of symbols I would suggest-on evidence too involved to present here-that the phallic symbolism of snakes and trees, as well as of spears, exists at preconscious levels in the awareness of Arapesh individuals. Cameron (1963:147) defines the "preconscious" as including: all that can easily become conscious as we shift our orientation, and change what we perceive, do or think, from one thing to another. It is the vast reservoir of readily accessible perceptions, thoughts, memories and actions . . . which lie near the surface of conscious experience, and are barred from it only by the limited scope of conscious experience at any one time. Here the relationship of symbol to referent is one of representation and not identity. The relationship between conscious and preconscious levels of symbolic meaning is illustrated by data Mead presents for the Mountain Arapesh. For these people (as well as for the Ilahita Arapesh) shell rings are important symbols of wealth and prestige. The ring assumes a specifically phallic symbolism in certain ritual contexts by being placed in water and referred to as an eel-a creature which, as Mead (1935:39) states, is "closely connected symbolically with the phallus." Thus, the equation "shell ring = penis" is arrived at through the prior symbolization, "shell ring = eel (= penis)." The context of the ritual Mead describes (which is the restoration of a father's masculinity following post-partum taboos and ritual dangers) makes it clear that the "aim" of the symbolic operations is to confer phallic mean- ing on to the restoring agent-the shell ring. Moreover, I feel that Mead's description allows the inference that the "shell ring = penis" equation is repressed, whereas the "eel = penis" equation functions at the level of preconscious awareness. If these inferences are correct, then the preconscious symbol (eel) provides a way of drawing attention to the phallic significance of the shell ring without making explicit the statement of symbolic equiv- alence; that is, without breaching the psychological defenses which are keeping the "shell ring = penis" equation repressed. Mechanisms similar to this are, I believe, operating between the three levels of yam symbolism outlined earlier. Evidence has been presented to support the "yam = body" equation, a symbolization which seems to function at the preconscious level. That is, although Arapesh men do not normally discuss this equation among themselves, at yam displays they spontaneously remark on the anthropomorphism of their yams in order to boast of their decorative skills. This is especially true when there are per- sons present who, in the estimation of the men, might be naive about the yam-body equation, in particular, Europeans and young children. The</page><page sequence="17">246 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY symbol is, in other words, usually implicit but readily available to conscious awareness. The effect of this is to orient the attention of spectators to other levels of symbolic meaning which may or may not be developed further. For example, with respect to yam displays, body symbolism links in an intimate way the growers and their yams and provides the justification for lavish boasting and self-congratulation by the hosts of the ceremony; that is, it directs attention to the "yam = male pride" equation. Although there is sometimes an undertone of aggression in this boasting, guests who are rivals of the hosts conventionally contribute praises of their own for the yams, sometimes with a gratuitous touch of irony. The ceremony is not a direct contest, but an occasion on which the opposition's strength in yams may be gauged in terms of future competitions. Thus the emotion present is highly controlled by the conventions of the ceremony; neither the hosts nor their rivals feel threatened by what is going on. And, significantly, I have not observed during yam displays any form of behavior which would indicate that the specifically phallic nature of the yam is manifesting itself. From this I would propose that at yam displays the symbolic levels of "body" and "male pride" are interacting in a salient way while the unconscious phallic symbolism is, as it were, dormant. In neurophysiological terms, the partici- pants are exercising neocortical control over their behavior, and emotion- bound processes which are excited by neuronal activity in the limbic system are relatively unobtrusive. What, then, happens when yam-oriented be- havior becomes intensely emotional and, to a certain extent, uncontrolled? To approach this question I shall examine the behavioral details of an aggressive yam presentation. The event occurred on August 29, 1970 and was precipitated by a land dispute between the enemy villages of Ilahita and Lehinga. Three days earlier Ilahita had been attracted by the sound of trees being felled in the direction of the disputed land. The small party which went to investigate found themselves outnumbered by Lehingans ready for a fight. After a brief scuffle the Ilahita men withdrew, but not before the Lehingans had managed to abduct two elderly Ilahitans and take them back to their village. Under these humiliating circumstances the old men were verbally abused and forced to accept a large "male" yam. On hearing the old men's story most of the younger Ilahitans argued for an immediate armed assault on the enemy village. Their elders overruled them by pointing out that such action would only land them in jail; and, besides, a more appropriate and far more effective reprisal would be to humble them with Ilahita yams. Whereupon, the long yams of Ilahita were examined and nine (six "male" and three "female") were selected as suitable</page><page sequence="18">YAM SYMBOLISM IN THE SEPIK 247 for presentation to Lehinga. Word was sent to an allied village, Ningalimbi, suggesting that they appear with Ilahita on the appointed day in case Lehinga suspected a trap and brought their own allies. The men assembled on the morning of the 29th and, with their prize yams suspended from poles, moved toward the boundary area. They numbered about 350, or approximately four times the full adult male strength of the rival village. On arrival most of the force, with the yams, concealed themselves in the nearby undercover and waited while a small group started felling trees to lure the Lehingans. It was less than an hour before they arrived, a group of about 40 Lehingans who began making threatening gestures at the woodcutters with the characteristic battle stomp of the area. At this the Ilahitans leapt from hiding and began menacing the Lehingans, edging them back until the two unequal sides stood facing each other, ten feet apart, across the boundary which Ilahita claimed was the rightful one. A cacophony of insult and argument poured back and forth across the boundary for about 30 minutes, with an occasional blow thrown. At times a few of the Lehingans would form themselves into a sort of can-can line and dance a jig while they sang defiance at the Ilahitans. On the Ilahita side some of the men repeatedly taunted the Lehinga group by displaying their buttocks, an aggressive gesture much accentuated with a spray of red croton leaves held over the posterior. Others in the Ilahita group made a gesture as a prelude to the yam presentation which the Lehingans could not mistake. Holding the right hand high over the head with the index finger outstretched, the man encircles the protruding finger with the thumb and index finger of his left hand. Prancing up and down giddily, he strokes the right index finger in an unmistakably obscene manner. This gesture is referred to as "skinning the penis" and, according to in- formants, its symbolic message is: "When we have completed what we are about to do, your penis will be ruined and of no further use to you!" The noise and excitement reached a thunderous pitch when, as if on the cue of some choreographer with a flair for drama, an aisle formed in the Ilahita ranks and down it came men bearing the "male" yams two abreast. Singing songs of victory, and dancing a straight-legged goosestep, the yam bearers lunged back and forth toward the Lehingans as if assaulting the line of enemies with a battering ram. Then with a final cry they rushed forward and thrust the poles on to enemy shoulders. The Lehingans struggled to prevent this from happening, both sides jostling and pushing the yam laden poles at each other. Finally, the transfer was made, four Lehinga men turned homeward with the two yams, and the next pair of yams were danced forward for presentation. The following yams were</page><page sequence="19">248 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY smaller and excitement diminished as these were presented with little Lehinga resistence. With the entire transfer complete, the two groups dis- engaged and returned home. This encounter exhibits a number of significant features. Emotion was intense; and, although the interaction was one of mainly "symbolic aggres- sion," it must be realized that there was a fair amount of real aggression going on and that, throughout the engagement, the two groups were teeter- ing close to an all-out fight. Lehinga's seemingly reckless defiance was ex- pressed with full awareness that they were operating within the conventions of a yam presentation in which the mutual roles of dominance and submis- sion were ritually defined. As long as these conventions held-and they were likely to, as the ritually dominant group also possessed great numerical superiority-a considerable amount of verbal and gestural aggression could proceed without recourse to large-scale violence. The critical point in the event occurred when the yams were actually transferred. Informants ex- plained later that anxiety in both groups centered on the fear that, in jostling over the yams, one of them would fall and break. The blame would have been Lehinga's, and Ilahita would have been provoked into attacking. Hence the maintenance of the constraining conventions depended speci- fically on the value assigned to the yams as the focus of symbolic aggression.17 In emphasizing the aggressive content of this yam presentation it must not be overlooked that there was as well a distinctly sexual aspect. The "skinning of the penis" gesture is clearly concerned with sexuality, and two possible interpretations emerge from the data. The first is that the "penis" (index finger) referred to in the gesture is that of Lehinga and that the encircled fingers of the other hand symbolically represent Ilahita's attack on the genitals of Lehinga. The other interpretation reverses the roles and expresses Ilahita's dominance through a symbol of aggressive sodomy: the "penis" (index finger) belongs to Ilahita and the encircled fingers symbolize the anal orifice of Lehingans. This is suggested by the fact that phallic sym- bols (yams) are being aggressively thrust upon the Lehingans in a manner suggestive of copulatory movement. The first interpretation originates in the informants' unambiguous claim that it is the Lehingan's "penis" which is being injured, "skinned." Addi- tional support comes from a consideration of the buttocks displays per- 17 An incident is recalled where, a few years earlier, Lehinga was aggressively pre- senting yams to Ningalimbi. At the crucial moment one of the Ningalimbi men darted forward and slashed the offending yam to pieces with a bush-knife-an act of incomparable audacity. As the sides were evenly matched, the resulting brawl ended indecisively. But everyone still believes that the daring Ningalimbi man is doomed to die of sorcery enacted either by Lehinga alone, or with the connivance of someone from Ningalimbi itself, as punishment for having so brazenly violated the conventions governing symbolic aggression.</page><page sequence="20">YAM SYMBOLISM IN THE SEPIK 249 formed by the Ilahitans. Anal and fecal allusions are not uncommon in Arapesh aggression; imitation feces are thrown at novices in initiation rites and they are also made to drink a dilute infusion of fecal material during their ordeals. In Arapesh mythology occurs the fantasy that the anus can be a devouring orifice belonging to a dreaded ogress, with the implication that the anus contains teeth. This "anal dentata" notion is clearly brought out in idioms relating to yam competition. If a man is being wrongly insulted over allegedly poor yams, he counters with the claim, accompanied by a hand gesture, that he has tusks (like a boar) in his mouth. If his maternal kinsmen are also good yam growers, he proclaims that he has tusks in his mouth (using the same hand gesture) and in his anus (here he protrudes his buttocks slightly and points toward them). It seems quite possible that the buttocks displays made against Lehinga were an expression of this boasting gesture, informing them that the Ilahitans had tusks in their anuses. If this inference is cor- rect, then the first interpretation offered of the "skinning of the penis" gesture becomes meaningful: it is a symbolic message meaning that if the Lehingans were to copulate with the anuses of the Ilahitans they would find tusks there and their penises would be skinned. Indeed, the action of a boar's tusk is slashing rather than biting; it is an ideal instrument for honing spears or other implements. Given the fantasy that the anus contains tusks, it is expectable that the effect on a penetrating penis would be to skin it. That both interpretations are supported suggests that they are perhaps complementary: the combined aggressive gestures symbolically mean that the Ilahitans are humiliating the Lehingans through aggressive sodomy, but that they (the Ilahitans) are not vulnerable to the same degradation be- cause they have tusks in their anuses. Applying the three-tiered model of symbolic meaning, the presentation can be seen at one level as an intense display of the pride and prestige of the Ilahitans. As in other instances of yam-oriented events, the participants are consciously aware of the prestige connotations of the yams. Yams and accompanying prestige are a favorite-if not constant-topic of conversation among the men, and "big men" are formally defined in terms of their yam growing ability. In discussions following the described presentation, the Ilahita men focused exclusively on the prestige gains they had won that day. Turning to the preconscious awareness that "yam" symbolizes "body," it should be remembered that competitions such as I have described arose historically as an alternative to warfare. In my view symbolic aggression using yams could not have developed without an implicit assumption of the "yam = body" equation. Corresponding to the belief that a man and his yams are spiritually confluent, convention prescribes that a man cannot</page><page sequence="21">250 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY legitimately compete using another man's yams. In short, the validity of yams as conscious symbols of male pride rests on the preconscious assump- tion that yams also symbolize the bodies of their growers. These symbolic meanings are important components in an analysis of the sociological dimensions of the aggressive yam presentation, but they have little applicability to the actual behavior patterns which are seen to occur during the confrontation. As I have tried to show, these gestures can be interpreted by analyzing them in the light of the "yam = penis" equa- tion. Why, it might be asked, did the gestures appear at all when they are absent from, say, yam displays? My view is that they appeared as a conse- quence of the markedly more intense-at times uncontrolled-emotional commitment of the participants. In contrast to the display, the presentation involved an armed confrontation between two hostile enemy groups. Al- though conventions existed to prevent violence, they were at times breached; there was always the possibility that the rules could break down altogether and a fight ensue. But, by and large, in this instance the conventions held- not because of a lack of emotion among the participants, but because the emotion present was being maintained within bounds. Outlet through direct aggression being prevented, these emotional forces found expression in sexually symbolic gestures. Freud postulated (Cameron 1963:153) that all human drives (other than hunger, thirst, and the need for sleep) can be comprehended within the categories of sex and aggression. MacLean's (1963) physiological and ethological investigations have shown that sex and aggression are intimately associated at the neurophysiological level and that in primates their behavioral manifestations are often strikingly similar. On what is now known about the relationship between sex and aggression, I suggest that the symbolic gestures described for the yam presentation repre- sent the excitation of unconscious sexual associations and controlled threat behavior which are expressed in lieu of physical violence. It should be noted finally that aggressive symbolic expression of the "yam = penis" equation in this context ultimately depends on yams being recognized symbols of male pride; indeed, it was on this basis that the yam presentation was planned in the first place. Here again can be seen the dynamic interaction of different levels of symbolic meaning. Not only does the prestige importance of the yam provide opportunities for the appearance of unconscious phallic significances ("the return of the repressed"), but their manifestation under highly emotional circumstances affirms and validates the notion that yams are important for prestige, and that for the Ilahita Arapesh they are true symbols of man.</page><page sequence="22">YAM SYMBOLISM IN THE SEPIK 251 VI Studies that rely on cultural data in the analysis of symbols face the dilemma of having to adopt, for practical reasons, the methodologically untenable premise that all the individuals in the culture subscribe to these symbols in the same way and to the same degree. An imperfect corrective to this is the standard anthropological procedure of cross-checking informa- tion with informants whose reliabilities have been assessed over a long period. This technique should at least reveal marked ideological peculiarities on the part of individuals, and on this basis I can claim that none of the beliefs and practices described here are idiosyncratic. On the other hand, it is not likely that all of these could be found together in a single Arapesh individual. When studies of this type attempt to relate cultural symbolic phenomena to processes occurring in the brains of individuals the conceptual problems become manifold. The main difficulty, related to the "uniformity" fallacy, is the tendency to reify culture. Individuals may experience conscious, pre- conscious, and unconscious awareness, but cultures do not. How, then, can one progress conceptually from the intrapsychic origin of symbolic phenom- ena to their expression as a shared feature of the culture? How do we account for the generality in a culture of particular unconscious mental processes? These questions point to an issue which, perforce, has been omitted from the present essay: the means by which unconscious fantasies relating to the penis come to be repressed in the course of ontogeny. Investigation along these lines would look to the common experiences of Arapesh infants as they are suckled, weaned, and raised in the culture. Attention would be paid to the character of parent-child attachments, the psychodynamic processes of the growing child, and the relationship be- tween the sexes. In brief, the question asked early in the paper-"Why yams?"-is but a part of the larger issue, "Why do Arapesh men seek to flaunt their maleness?"
