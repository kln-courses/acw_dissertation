<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rel. Stud. IO, pp. 3 I 9-324 RICHARD L. PURTILL Professor of Philosophy, Western Washington State College FOREKNOWLEDGE AND FATALISM In a recent book,' J. R. Lucas presents an argument to show that if God has infallible knowledge of the future, our will is not free. Thus, Lucas con cludes, like the medieval Jewish philosopher Gersonides, that God in creating beings with genuinely free will, abdicates some of his omniscience as well as some of his omnipotence. God could, but will not, determine our choices, since such an exercise of his power would rob us of free will. Simi larly, Lucas holds, God could but does not foreknow our future choices since this also would rob us of free will. This argument, from so formidable a foe of determinism as Lucas, merits our most serious attention. However, I believe that there is a way to evade its conclusion, a way which Lucas considers but rejects (in my view too hastily). The argument is perhaps best regarded as a variant of that 'master argu ment' which Epictetus described in the Discourses.2 The classical Master Argument can be reconstructed as follows: i. The future follows from the past; 2. The past is unchangeable; 3. What follows from the unchangeable is unchangeable; 4. The future is unchangeable. In this version the argument is open to a fatal objection: no one but a determinist would grant that premise i was true if 'follow from' means any kind of logical or quasi-logical 'following from,' and no one but a determinist would grant that premise 3 is true if 'follows from' means only a temporal 'following after.' Thus either premise i is question-begging for the non determinist, or premise 3 is, or the argument equivocates on 'follow from.' The Stoic logicians seem to have seen this, at least partially, if I interpret Epictetus correctly.3 To see similarities of Lucas' argument to the Master Argument, as well as the crucial differences, let me first consider a sound but harmless variant of Lucas' argument: I'. If yesterday God predicted infallibly what I will do tomorrow, it follows logically that I will do it. 1 The Freedom of the Will (Oxford, I97I), Chapter 14, especially pp. 74-5.

What happened yesterday is unchangeable. 3'. What follows logically from the unchangeable is unchangeable. 4'. If yesterday God predicted infallibly what I will do tomorrow, my actions tomorrow are unchangeable. By 'God predicted' we will mean 'God overtly predicted', that is, 'God told some person. . . .' I take premise 2 to be true if by 'unchangeable' we mean 'unchangeable now', and I believe that his sense of 'unchangeable' is all that is needed for the argument. Premise 3 does not, of course, have the same claim to be uncontroversially true as 'What follows logically from the logically necessary is logically necessary', which is a truth of (modal) logic. Premise 3 is a 'mixed' statement which uses both modal and temporal terms, and we are sometimes justifiably cautious about such mixed state ments. But premise 3 is true, for all that. Premise i seems to be true merely because of the meaning of 'infallibly.' Thus the argument seems to be sound. The conclusion, however, is harmless. Theists do not believe that God often makes overt predictions of our future actions, and even where they believe that he seems to have done so (e.g., Jesus' prediction that Judas would betray him), there may have been a free decision antecedent to the prediction. Thus the conclusion is a harmless hypothetical: God could remove our freedom by making detailed infallible predictions about our actions before our birth, but the theist does not believe that he has done so or will do so. We now come to Lucas' argument proper, which can be represented as a variation of our second argument, with the substitution for i'. of I". If yesterday God infallibly knew what I will do tomorrow, it follows logic ally that I will do it. This yields the conclusion: 4". If yesterday God infallibly knew what I will do tomorrow, then my actions tomorrow are unchangeable. This is hypothetical but not harmless, since the theist seems committed to the belief that yesterday (or at any date in the past you like) God knew infallibly what I will do tomorrow (or on any date in the future). It is this belief that Lucas (and Gersonides) urge us to abandon to avoid 'theological determinism'. It might, of course, be possible to deny premise I ", to argue that infallible foreknowledge is somehow different from an infallible prediction actually made to some person, and that infallible foreknowledge does not give rise to the same problem as infallible prediction. Lucas replies to a suggestion of this kind in a footnote (Op. cit. p. 74, footnote 2): 'To say that God knows what I am going to do is to say that God could at some previous date say, in definite words, what I am going to do. Knowledge is</page><page sequence="3">FOREKNOWLEDGE AND FATALISM 32I nothing if not definite. The cards are already shown, at least to God. Therefore God's knowledge cannot depend on what is yet to happen. And the problem remains'. There are two arguments that Lucas might be taken as using here, one bad, the other intuitively convincing but hard to put precisely. The bad argument can be stated as follows: If God foreknows our actions he could make an overt prediction; If God made an overt prediction of our actions they could not be free; (cf. the second argument that we considered). Therefore if God foreknows our actions they could not be free. This, of course, is a fallacy of the form 'If A then possibly B, If B then C (Therefore) If A then C.' If this were Lucas' argument it would have no force. But I am willing to grant that Lucas is not using this argument but one which can be put more discursively as follows: 'You can see there would be a problem if God made an overt prediction. But whether or not he makes such a prediction, he has the data, so to speak, for a prediction "the cards are shown, at least to God." And his having precise and definite knowledge of what I am going to do creates a problem just as much as his making a precise and definite prediction.' It might be possible to argue that this argument owes its force to an unconscious reliance on the fallacious argument, but I do not think that this is correct. The difficulty is one of dependence. There is the knowledge of my actions, existing in the past. This knowledge cannot depend on my actions, which are still in the future. My future knowledge can depend on past events, but my past knowledge cannot depend on future events, just as my future actions can depend on past actions, but my past actions cannot depend, in the same sense, on future actions. This is the real crux of the difficulty, and the remark about predictions can now be seen to be merely illustrative. Thus the difficulty remains. The solution I propose to offer to this difficulty depends on the idea that God is 'outside' of time in some sense. Lucas considers this kind of solution and dismisses it in these words (op. cit., pp. 74-5): 'The suggestion that God is outside time is difficult to discuss, because its meaning is unclear. There are no doubt many ways in which God is not subject to temporal limitations as we human beings are. But if to be outside time is to exclude God from all temporal experience-as it must be if it is to avoid the argument from foreknowledge-then it is to deny God anything that could be called per sonality ... to be a person one must be capable of consciousness and all conscious ness is temporal. Time is a distentio animi, as St Augustine said. Therefore God if he is a personal God must have temporal experience, and we can ask of his knowledge not only what he knows, but what he knows now. And then the argument from foreknowledge is under way.' C</page><page sequence="4">322 RICHARD L. PURTILL Lucas' difficulties with the 'God is outside time' solution begin with a complaint that the suggestion is unclear. Let us attempt to use an analogy with God's relation to space to understand his relation to time. The following account of God's relation to space seems to create no conceptual difficulty: God is not in space, by which we mean that he is not contained by an area of space, and that He has no spatial parts. (On the other hand I am both contained by a given area of space, and part of me is in one place, part of me in another.) God may be said to be 'at' all places in the sense that he is acting on all objects in space. God also knows that is going on at all places and thus knows what is going on 'here', for any use of the indexical 'here'. But his actions are non-spatial in the sense that he is not at any place when he does them and his knowledge is 'non-spatial' in the sense that he is not any place when he know things. However his actions on things in space are spatial in the sense that they affect things in space and his knowledge of things in space is spatial in the sense that he knows these things as spatial. I take it that to deny any of this would be to fall into a sort of anthropomorphic view of God as somehow material. Consider now the parallel statements about God's relation to time: God is not in time, by which we mean that he is not contained by any period of time, and that he has no 'temporal parts.' God may be said to be 'at' all times in the sense that he is acting at all times. God also knows what is going on at all times and thus knows what is going on 'now' for any use of the indexical 'now.' But his actions are non-temporal in the sense that He is not 'at' any time when he does them, and his knowledge is non-temporal in the sense that he is not 'at' any time when he knows things. However, his actions on things in time are temporal in the sense that they affect things at certain times and his knowledge of things in time is temporal in the sense that he knows these things as temporal. I take it that this account is roughly the traditional one, and it seems to me that it raises no difficulties more insupportable than those of the parallel account of God's relation to space. Many people find it easier to imagine a non-spatial God than to imagine a non-temporal God, but that is another matter. Let us now see how this affects the foreknowledge problem. We can see that a consequence of the accounts of God's relation to space and time is that questions like 'What is God doing here?' and 'What is God doing now?' tend to be misleading. We can give answers to such questions; here and now God is keeping me in existence, for example. But the answers are misleading if they suggest that God or any part of God is contained by any time or place. 'God is here' means just 'God is acting here;' 'God is here now' just means 'God is acting here now'. The answer to the question what did God know yesterday is just a description of what happened yesterday, just as the answer to the question 'What has God done at Oxford?' is a description of things which have happened at Oxford.</page><page sequence="5">FOREKNOWLEDGE AND FATALISM 323 To interpret the first question as 'What did God know while he was living through yesterday?' is just as absurd as to interpret the second question as 'What did God do while he was living in Oxford?' In other words, questions about what you or I did at a given time or place involve reference to where and when we were when we acted and also to where and when the actions took place (normally the same, but consider 'A man in London created a furor in South Africa yesterday' (e.g., by a radio speech)). Questions about what God did at a time or place, on the other hand, involve no reference to his spatial or temporal location, for he has none. 'Heaven' is not God's spatial address, 'eternity' is not God's temporal address. We can see, then, that the whole problem created by 'If God knew yesterday what I will do tomorrow. . .' cannot arise on the view that God is outside of time. It turns out to mean 'If God knew while he was living through yesterday what I will do tomorrow . . .' and this is illegitimate since God did not live through yesterday. Lucas, however, criticises this view, on the grounds that it would 'exclude. God from all temporal experience' and would therefore 'deny God anything that could be called personality' since 'to be a person one must be capable of consciousness and all consciousness is temporal'. On what grounds, how ever, does Lucas hold that 'all consciousness is temporal'? He quotes Augustine, but Augustine agreed with Boethius that while each spirit had its proper duration, the duration of God is eternity, the duration of angels and the Blessed is aeviternity, and that of man as he is now is time. Even Lucas' quote says 'distentio animi', not 'distentio spirituis'. I presume that Lucas does not want to use Wittgensteinian arguments about 'our concept' of personality or 'our criteria' of personality, for such arguments can easily be used to 'prove' that the concepts of God or spirit are unintelligible. This is ad hominem, of course, but I am convinced that all such arguments are bad ones,1 and Lucas would be ill-advised to rely on them quite apart from any question of whether they could be turned against other positions he holds. Thus I am not sure how Lucas would justify his generalisation that 'all consciousness is temporal'. The theory that God is outside of time, as held at least since Boethius, is an alleged counter-example to this generalisation, and Lucas' assertion of the generalisation appears to be a question-begging dismissal of the theory. To refute a theory that includes the notion that God's consciousness is non-temporal, it is not enough to simply assert that all consciousness is temporal. I am sure that Lucas appears to beg the question only because this dis cussion is subordinate to his main purpose, the refutation of determinism. Lucas is bound to have arguments to support his generalisation, and I would be most interested to see these arrangements. But until Lucas gives 1 Cf. my 'Disembodied Survival', Sophia, Vol. XII, No. 2, July 1973.</page><page sequence="6">324 RICHARD L. PURTILL them, it is no use pretending that he has disposed of the 'God is not in time' theory as a possible answer to the problem he raises. It remains a live option, in the absence of further arguments. Let me close, however, by recording my agreement with Lucas on an important point. If the 'God is not in time' theory is not viable, I agree with Lucas that we must deny that God has infallible foreknowledge of free human actions. Whether or not the arguments, as Lucas gives it, is entirely watertight, he has convinced me that there is a serious incompatibility be between infallible foreknowledge in the past of an action in the future and that action being free. The two ways out are to deny that God's foreknow ledge is 'in the past' or to deny that it is infallible. If the first escape is closed, then I agree with Lucas that both Christianity and philosophical common sense require us to take the second.</page></plain_text>
