<plain_text><page sequence="1">This essay addresses the relationship between speciality, citation , and the ghost writing that takes place in the name and institution of scholarship. Responding to places where Jacques Derrida implicitly or explicitly connects quotation and haunting, the essay considers the extent to which academic writing is a manifestation of a "spectropoetics" Citation's Haunt: Specters of Derrida JULIAN WOLFREYS To the begin title with of this the essay. title: The there disturbance, is a graphic signalled disturbance by the in the title of this essay. The disturbance, signalled by the possessive apostrophe, demands that you read the title in a particular fashion: that a place is implied, the place where citation takes place, where it returns habitually, and where, as critical readers, we believe we are habituated in finding citation - in the place, perhaps the scene, of criticism. This is where citation is anticipated, where we assume, even ahead of its arrival, its inevitable manifestation. Citation haunts criticism and, more generally, it haunts all reading and writing. But haunting this phrase, "Citations Haunt," is another remark, without the possessive inscription by which citation assumes to itself its habitual right to habitation-as-haunting: citations haunt. There is more than one citation here. Indeed, they may be innumerable, and with them comes an insistence on the spectral persistence of citations. Citations will haunt, it can be read, and the haunt of citations is here. And here. Thus this title haunts this essay, announcing its concerns, interests, and orientations. In addition to these issues is the manifestation of another haunting or phantom effect: that of those "specters of Der- rida," to which my title also refers. Not quite a double geni- tive, on the one hand this phrase, citation's haunty names Mosaic 35/ 1 0027- 1 276-00/02 1 0 1 4$02.00©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">22 Mosaic 35/1 (March 2002) the processes of "ghost writing" in the work of so many invisible citations arriving from Derrida's essays and indicated parenthetically throughout this essay. The effect of such ghosting or hovering takes place beyond these obvious locations, however; overflowing, even to the point of excess in what might be called style or imitation of style. Even my use of the phrase on the one hand might be assumed to be imitation or citation, or both. (Interestingly, even though Derrida does not originate the formula on the one hand / on the other handy this figure manifests itself frequently enough in his arguments that any subsequent use transforms the formula in a quite spectral and citational fashion, particularly when its appearances take place in essays concerning Derrida's work.) On the other hand, the phrase specters of Derrida announces those places in Derrida's writing where the question of citation disturbs Derrida, coming to haunt his consideration in different ways. In recognizing this, it cannot be said that there is an argument here as such. I am not proposing anything that has not already been said by Derrida, and often, it could be argued, more elegantly by him than by me. What takes place in this essay is a certain registration, recognition, or admission of the work of haunting within any textual form, as that work disturbs the certain identity of, or distinction between, the forms of imitation or mimicry (the shaping of an apparently original argument in the more or less discernible lineaments of another) and the function of citation itself as a somewhat spectral authority. Citation haunts precisely because it arrives from some other place as an authority, the authority of the other, which intrusion of the guest is paradoxically conjured so as to assert the very idea of originality in argument or research. So, to begin again. Writing without citation is impossible. Writing without citation is impossible. As obvious as this remark will have appeared, it bears reiterating. If I had never written it, its interruptive principle would still be at work. It would have returned and retreated in every word here, in every line. Indeed, that which moves this statement has the force of inevitability, coming as it does from somewhere else and bearing the signs of some disassimilating other, the traces of a borderless context (Derrida, "Moment" 34). Beginning by acknowledging interruption, the principle announced attests to a matter of (always ghostly) dislocation ("Art" 81), of intimate proximity and yet, also, immeasurable distance. The concern is with something haunting (unheimlich) within the habitual (heimlich) , the apparition of an other, which</page><page sequence="3">Julian Wolfreys 23 is neither simply real nor not real ( Adieu 121) and yet which, in being neither being nor not being, in not being nothing, has always already exceeded all ontological determination or definition (112) beyond all that is delimitable ("Moment" 34). Less a question of habitation than of haunting (18), even though the one always implies the other (. Archive 86), the spectrality of citation arrives as a summons calling us to respond, to acknowledge it (Cinders 22). Such a silent disturbance in the field of forces is precisely what obligates. Even though there are no quotation marks here, in reading this opening gambit, citation, pseudo-citation, or, at the very least, the simulacrum of citation will have been read by some. This is a question of frequency, of interruption, or even cadence, as is known ( Spectres 165; "Moment" 18). And then again, such a frequency can take place and has taken place, there in that qualifying remark disturbing the purity, for want of a better word, of the inscription and doing so repeatedly. And, if not citation, pseudo- citation or the simulacrum of a citation - which without quotation marks is nonetheless a more or less direct citation concerning citation, pseudo- citation, or the simulacrum of citation - then, perhaps, let us put it this way, there is discernible a semi- or quasi-citational atmosphere or, equally, ambience. A question arises or presents itself in passing, an apparent digression as engagement otherwise considered: is it ever possible (or indeed inescapable) to cite resonance, atmosphere, or, to put it more crudely, tone, style? Or is the perception of this citational character or impression ( mimeto - or mnemocitationality) more a question of reading crudely? Is it a question of interpretation or translation where the question hides itself in an act of supposed identification or determination? Imagine this citation, for example, arriving from a number of places at once, both past and future: "There, there is citation." (By the way, even though this citation is invented, a simulacrum of a citation, so to speak, this "phantom quotation" is nonetheless a citation for all that; the quotation marks signal this condition [" Geschlecht " 390] .) You can just hear the voice, can't you? Where is citation? Nowhere, as such, yet, in the tone, bearing or, let's call it a family atmosphere or resemblance. (This statement amounts to "quasi-quotation" again in a double manner: for, on the one hand, the remark resonates with an unacknowledged quotation while, on the other hand, the recognition of a resemblance is suggestive of a certain haunting citational force where intertextuality is read in a genealogical fashion.) Or perhaps the question is one of pastiche or parody, as doubtless the bad reader would hasten to suggest so as to indict (citation, the question of the law) - J'accuse / Jacques ose citer - with the evidence of the</page><page sequence="4">24 Mosaic 35/1 (March 2002) ghost of a citation, which is nowhere in sight yet simultaneously everywhere. Imagine this haunted and haunting figure: the incited reader, lacking insight and in a hurry to find the citation, which is nowhere present as such (once again), and all the while misreading across the text-as-site the general, dif- fused stench of the citational, and calling this, that, or the other, parody or pastiche. Will he? Mais oui, encore une fois. Yet this is simply the will to read without reading. It announces a desire to proceed by that most conventional or predictable of literary-critical methods, the perception of similarity or allusion. This is no mere hypothesis being presented here. I am indirectly citing, citing without citing, as it were, or otherwise alluding. (But then it has to be asked, What is allusion if not a form of citation that because of its indirection already announces its condition of being traced or returning to its audience another text?) Without wishing to sound coy, I could establish a series, one that is already immanent. It would be possible to trace a hitherto invisible network of citations for two incommensurate purposes. On the one hand, it would doubtless be possible to dismiss the hypothetical taint of that to which I have just alluded. Citations could be found that would give authority to my comments on the incited reader. On the other hand, however, proceeding in this fashion would support what is readable immediately above as the parodie mimicry of an argument wielded against essays such as the present one. (Note the phrase such as: it announces indirect reference.) Were I to follow this argument through, I might do it in order to show how such an argument or accusation is not merely a misreading. Simply and with all the simplicity of an evangelical fervour, the so-called reader has not read, even though such a polemic may well have cited numerous "sources" in support of its own weary and wearying argument. I refrain from citation, though. It is necessary to abandon this lengthy digression. Arguably, however, it has only the appearance of digression, addressing the matter of citationality or its illusion all the while. It could be said that, despite appearances to the contrary, the matter of citation haunts the experience of this passage, of both writing and reading it as the structural and yet disjointing necessity of its possibility - and, by extension, that of every act of writing, every performance or event. One possible point is that writing, and, more generally, inscription, without citation is impossible, whether directly or indirectly. Writing could not take place without the trace of some other text, without the manifestation or the revenance that is named, on occasion, iterability. Writing is thus haunted and, in being so, maintains the haunting-effect. Citation haunts. It can come from any past or any future, as I have already implied in what might be called a gesture designed to incite. Writing is the haunt of citation.</page><page sequence="5">Julian Wolfreys 25 In order to open this spectral condition to the beginning of a reading, and in order to begin to discern the traces of the phantomatic or phantasmic materiality of writing, I wish to orient this essay around the more apparent of the apparitions, limiting myself to remarks - extended citations - taken from certain texts by Jacques Derrida as exemplary instances of haunting's implication in the scene of writing generally, as well as in the motion of citation specifically. These citations haunt this essay even though they are nowhere quoted as such. They appear in Schibboleth : pour Paul Celan , Politiques de Vamitiéy Dissemination , Archive Fever, Ulysse Gramophone , and "At this very moment in this work here I am." Other texts that address citation are also alluded to, such as "La loi du genre," "Signature Event Context," "Psyche: Inventions of the Other," as well as those that speak of haunting and spectrality, not least Spectres de Marx, The Truth in Painting , Echographies , Adieu to Emmanuel Lévinas , and, most recently, Sur parole: instantanés philosophiques . Indeed, these and others are already here as ghosts in the machine ghost writing this essay. And, although I try to hold citations at bay, even this act of naming texts, letting their names return, constitutes citation whether with or without quotation marks. For the most part, however, I remain in the general vicinity of the passages already acknowledged. The implication of a relationship between the spectral and citation is well known. Certainly, the argument can be put with some justification that those who are most familiar with Derrida are already familiar with this most persistent of Derrida's interests. However, what I wish to explore is the peculiar intimacy between the one and the other, between spectrality and citation. If the one is not reducible to the other - and I would argue that the relationship between citation and spectrality could not be less certain - then, at least, what is of interest in opening this consideration is the possibility of beginning to read how one comes to take place in the place of the other, destabilizing the identification of either and thus returning again and again the matter of spectral disturbance. That the citation is spectral, that it partakes of the spectral condition of literary writing, and that what appears is not simply some prior text (in the narrow sense of that word - indeed, as Derrida has demonstrated amply in various places, the conventional meaning of "text" is always already haunted from within by an illimitable excess) now being quoted may be comprehended if one acknowledges that the spectral is that which is also to come: the disfiguring figure Và venir disrupts meaning, disjointing in the process the time of reading. In so doing, this figure operates on and thereby countersigns the text and the experience of the text in a particularly uncanny fashion. Acknowledging this, in the wake not only of</page><page sequence="6">26 Mosaic 35/1 (March 2002) Derrida but also of Geoffrey Bennington, Peggy Kamuf, Werner Hamacher, and Nicholas Royle amongst others, each in his or her singular fashion (I refrain again from citation, on the one hand to keep the ghosts at bay and, on the other, to allow their resonances full play without attempting to control the phantomatic effect through the process of citation, which in extracting fragments from the body of the text seeks to inter and to fix in place), it has to be admitted in a recognition of the anachrony discernibly at work that that which is not yet, already is. In this, the experience of the impossible time of reading, there is acknowledged the fact that reading remains to come, and that we will never have done with it. (Once again this is well known, this is not an "original" observation. In acknowledging this, I only admit to the ghostly power of citational force, all the more resonant for never having been cited as such.) Citation or quotation disturbs the remarking of the present from within itself. It undermines the articulation of the present moment, especially in the resonance of the present tense of the citation, which is clearly the return of another "present," though never the present as such ("Moment" 11-51). All presence, all presentation, of the present is internally disturbed, though - and here I find it necessary to make a qualification - such internality is not simply some discernible figure, one half of a polar pairing marking off and thereby stabilizing a spatial or anterior location or locution. This is the condition of text and of writing, the more so when inscription feigns the presence of the subject - first person singular - in relation to the temporal instantane- ity of utterance. Even those inscriptions that are not assumed to have a voice and yet that are read conventionally as singular or unique - dates, for example - are available for reiteration. Indeed, the force of the date's singularity is guaranteed only by the possibility of its being reinscribed outside the supposed authenticity of its apparently proper occurrence. Thus, for Derrida, while the date can never return in stricto sensu , it nonetheless can find itself remarked in a spectral fashion. Moreover, this revenance of the date is also a revenance, a phantomatic oscillation, which always already haunts the structure of dating ( Schibboleth 37-38). Of course, the question does not come down to a matter of only dates or, to invoke another well-known instance, the articulation of saying "I." Neither of these singular examples guarantees the singularity or absolute centring that they appear to promise. Neither the date nor the "I" maintains any singularity except by the chance of its being spirited away, reiterated, or cited, as is well known. What is not fully acknowledged, however, is that the iterability that guarantees that singularity is itself the experience of haunting, which is all the more uncanny, all the more spectral, in that it admits to the</page><page sequence="7">Julian Wolfreys 27 unassignability of any absolutely discernible or traceable originary location. Thus in both cases the date and the "I" are marked by a certain citational revenance at or as the origin , as it were. In this, acts of dating or articulations of the "I" betray a citational relationship to writing in general, despite the fact that the reader habitually or conventionally reads them as inscriptions belonging to a different order of signification such as that accorded signatures or proper names, which also supposedly operate according to laws quite different from other inscribed apparitions and yet are shown to behave as typical modes of inscription (with Bennington, Jacques 100-09, 140-56). The phantasmatic or spectral condition is not only what comes to haunt citation and all acts of quotation in certain specific situations, particular expressions and their rhetorical deployment, or simply in certain "forms" of writing. Indeed, all writing may be said to be spectral, though special- ity is equally another name or one possible substitution for the endlessly citational structures that are called or otherwise invoked in the name of writing. (Borrowing a model based on the double logic articulated by Derrida elsewhere, it is tempting to suggest that writing partakes of the doubling work of "conjuring," especially when writing relies on citation for its authoritative force [Spectres 40-41] .) The experience of the literary is also the experience of the spectral, though the term literary does not refer merely to either a restricted range of texts or an equally restricted - and restrictive - defini- tion of certain texts. Spectrality is what allows citation to take place as displacement, as doubling and haunting. The spectral, neither simply there nor not there, disrupts pure singularity and thus manifests its performative effect in the mark, the trace, and those places where one "begins" with iterability, with what returns; and this is to say nothing other than inscription ("Signature" 320-21). As Derrida makes clear, the idea of the mark that is not iterable, that cannot be cited or re-cited, is unthinkable (320-21, 326). Moreover, the definition and practice of citation is irreducible to simply determined mechanical processes of extraction and repetition from one place to another, obeying all the while the laws and conventions of citation through the proper use of quotation marks, annotations, the various conventions by which acts of citation are bound, and so forth ("Loi" 254). The law of citation will be returned to in this essay; or, to put it another way, it is that which will return to us. In the sense that the law always returns or, more accurately, is always already in the act of returning via the event of the citation and every citation, this concern with the law governing citation is readable as having announced itself from at least the beginning of this essay, at least as that which haunts any consideration of what constitutes a "proper" citation and whether the re-marking of citation itself constitutes a</page><page sequence="8">28 Mosaic 35/1 (March 2002) question of property, properly or improperly transplanted or appropriated. For, whether one speaks of the law of citation, or whether one speaks of the doubling and division that takes place within, as the sign of the undecid- ability of the single word, the spectral has always already returned and retreated within the supposedly stable site, leaving the merest, yet undeniably most powerful, if not violent, of traces ( Dissemination 98; Khôra 19, 21-22, 23-24, 57-60). We are witness here to spectral logic and its abyssal effects (Spectres 108): revenance as resonance, the other within, composition and/as annihilation: haunting takes place . The effects of haunting are discernible even in the genealogical or ge- nealogicophantomatic drift, for want of a better expression, within both the word and concept of citation. (Another parenthetical detour: in the awkward coinage offered here, it may be suggested - may it not? - that the motif of genealogy is always that in which is traced the phantom effect, the ghost-writing, of an improper and disinterred citationality.) One could go so far as to suggest that every time one cites, speaks of citation, or otherwise encounters the manifestation of citation within another's text - the manifesta- tion of the other within the other - one encounters such a drift in both the very propriety that is enacted and in the most precisely observed re-marking of the laws of citation also. Why should this be the case? What authority can there be for such a remark? Arguably, authority resides or is indirectly cited in the promise or asserts itself in the act of citation. Turning from Derrida for the moment to the Oxford English Dictionary, the dictionary entry notes that the very idea of citation, its possibility and what authorizes it, is juridical in condition. Citation names the act of summoning to a court, while naming also the summons, the written document itself that cites the court and bears through that citation the authority in the name of which that inscription comes to be presented. At this point, the OED defers its own authority to that of the Law Dictionary. It thereby presents within its definition a citation and with that the process and law of citation, that of issuing an inscription that causes action, referring in the process specifically to process in the spiritual or ecclesiastical court. Authority thus halts and displaces itself, backing itself up by reference to a higher authority. Authority does not reside in a statement without citation. The sign of another must arrive in order to prove authority, in order to authorize from some other place the authority that a definitive statement simultaneously seeks to make manifest and yet that it manifestly lacks. In this process there is to be discerned the ghostly shimmering of an abyssal supplementarity. To cite is thus to call or otherwise to set in motion. The call of citation and the displaced writing that remarks the act of citation (which is citation</page><page sequence="9">Julian Wolfreys 29 also) comes from some other place. It doubles and divides itself, as can be witnessed. Citation both is and is not citation. It disrupts the authority of identity and of origin, being always already in motion. Destabilizing itself both internally and from the location or locution of the other, citation thereby engages or tropes itself as other than itself in the transport from and as a condition of the command, the injunction, the order ("Remember me," says the ghost of Hamlet's father). At the same time, there is a gesture of giving that defines citation. In English, one may cite, in an essay, for example, but one can also legally give a citation, as the buried etymology reveals. Such an act of giving causes citation to remark itself as not simply itself, and thereby in the process operating as the division and the dislocation of itself both from and within itself as performative transport. Citation's haunted and haunting structure operates through a simultaneous and yet anachronistic motion of returning and arriving - la contre-allée. There, in the ghost of a chance, one can begin to read the phantom-performative of citation. Arriving at this comprehension places us in a closer relation to the condition of citation. We find ourselves involved in a process that has no beginning. At the same time, however, what is also observable is that all we can do is begin repeatedly, if only so as to get to the point of beginning and departure ("Psyché" 216). The principle of citation is therefore readable as citing, indirectly, not simply some anterior, originary source. Instead, citation in principle and in effect acts as a spectral thread or trace - un des fils conducteurs : conductor and clew/clue, a genealogical, if not genetic, imprint hinting at frayed inheritance and heritage, at once generative and generational (Parole 121) and yet also discontinuous and coming apart at the edges. The father's message, the trace of his phantom, returns to haunt the son. This thread attests to a vast and complex network, a mnemotechnic. It announces and enacts the impersonal making of an archive and an archiving of memory, all the more uncanny for being irreducible to any human origin, being neither simply there nor not there as such, and thereby being resistant to an anthropomorphizing, domesticating reading - epistemo-political habitas the attempted exorcism of the ghost from the house, the habitus and oikos - of citation. And, of course, as Derrida has insisted in addressing Yerushalmi's encounter with Freud's phantom, the archive, its structuration, is spectral through and through ( Archive 84). Returning from the archive, the ghost of and in citation turns our attention toward its own repressed truth, which is that it appears as or in the guise of an indirect manifestation of some other specter, the specter of the other, which in turn, internally, as the other of citation haunts the humanist-ideological reading of citation as the voice of authoritative origin even as it resists that reading. The truth of the spectral comes to be unveiled</page><page sequence="10">30 Mosaic 35/1 (March 2002) through the phantomatic-technicity of citational transport and return while reciprocally the spectral truth of citation is opened to us. There is here, therefore, a doubling effect, doubling being the uncanny manifestation of the iterable (Truth 373), where division and constitution take place simultaneously as the possibility of, and also within, the site of citation. Such doubling is made possible by the movement of difference, and the readability of division and doubling reflects the performative work of the ghostly simulacrum. In reading the split within a term such as pharmakon, for example, the reader neither has the authority to suggest nor can he or she locate any originary locus for such authority from which to argue that one half of the double or division has a greater primacy than the other. Both figures within the effect of doubling mimic or mirror one another without either the hope for anterior reference or allusion to the real, hence, the fleeting sense of the uncanny that arrives or arises in the resistance within structure to any ontological or semantic resolution. What is all the more haunting in such a structure is that the spectral oscillation is there, ahead and independent of any consciousness that may or may not read such a disjointing. Derrida speaks of this in discussing the double-yes. One affirmation cites the other, Derrida claims, though it is not a matter of one being original and the other being secondary, supplementary, or otherwise a mimetically faithful copy of the first ( Ulysse 141; one might also consider Kurtz's utterance "the horror, the horror" in Conrad's Heart of Darkness in a similar fashion, the horror perhaps being Kurtz's recognition of the anthropomorphic fallacy behind the very idea of the human that the colonialists bring with them and that haunts their brutality toward the Africans). Rather, one is the ghost of the other; or, to put this another way so as to avoid the misunderstanding of placement and priority by which the vertiginous and abyssal vibration between and in the two might be calmed, each disfigures itself in figuring as part of a doubling matrix, a machinery of spectral projection and oscillation as the ghost of and in the other. No simple reflection; instead, two haunting traces. No closure, therefore ( Ulysse 140 ni). The double-yes haunts through the inscription of memory and affirmation and the undecidability, which such citation makes plain. Moreover, haunting takes place through the spectral effect of a doubling beyond any simple opposition (Truth 340). Mimicry, mirroring, and citational specularity are observed in passing here, but this is only fitting given the virtual rapidity of apparition ("Art" 64), the briefest of instantaneities hinting at a furtiveness or indecipherability - the encryption - of purpose. (It might be proposed here, en passant , that such encryption of citation could be termed cryptocitation : this figures yet another architectural, archival and labyrinthine structure as the dwelling place, the</page><page sequence="11">Julian Wolfreys 31 haunt, of ghosts. Or it might be said that this very notion is comprehensible as that which structures and disturbs the idea of the subject constituted by, and as, the encrypted lodging place of the spectral, the phantasmatic other, and of so many haunting citations ["Fors" xxiii] , which is misrecognized and misread as the self, as "I" "here" and gathered together in this simulacrum of unity, uncannily so.) And what could be more furtive, more the registration of a certain haste, than the end- or footnote, a manifestation of citation, especially when that footnote concerns itself once again and in passing with the simulacrum of a citation, with haunting and mimicry (Dissemination 196-97 n20)? Establishing or, rather, writing itself out of an already woven network or labyrinth of citations and their variations into which it places itself even as it displaces textual organization, Derrida's footnote recites as it cites an archival structure of responses within the various editions of the texts of Mallarmé, themselves responding to and re-citing the encounter with a text, the pantomime booklet, Pierrot Murderer of his Wifey all of which variants belong to the text of Mimique and all of which are, suggests Derrida, caught up in the complex textile weave concerning anonymous origins, omissions, textual fragments, reflections of variations, and the simulacrum of citation. Citation mirrors or mimes citation, because absolute priority is forestalled and displaced. Nothing other than citation is possible, even while the very act of citation is itself called into question in the process of citation by Derrida, whose dense annotated network transforms itself from speaking of the troping of citation, to enacting the disturbing performative condition of citation itself. And what is more, in some kind of parody of authority, (panto) miming, let us say, the authority of scholarship, Derrida marshals the citations concerning the Pierrot, that silent figure of mimicry who "cites" in parody the very idea of the human via a series of material gestures, the materiality of which is so counterintuitive that all phenomenal adequation is called into question. Derrida does so furthermore, by pointing out - and this is still a condition of that performative pantomimicry of scholarly reading, a gesture not Derridas own but haunted by the ghost of the Mallarméan text - that no such citation is to be found anywhere. The citation returns, certainly, but only ever in some ghostly fashion, mirroring and citing its other selves, without source, without origin. In coming back and in being projected from some other place, the prov- enance of which is undecidable, the citations, far from gathering themselves into a determinable set or act, separate themselves from themselves and from within themselves. Instead, like two shoes - as is known, their relationship as a pair is undecidable (Truth 373-74) - the spectral possibility opens (onto</page><page sequence="12">32 Mosaic 35/1 (March 2002) itself) a spectrum of possibilities as the truth in haunting, irreducible once more to all epistemologies, ideologies, and anthropomorphic mimeticisms that are reliant on the prior or anterior location. And, indeed (to return momentarily to that note on Mallarmé), the word phantom does not simply arrive in the note on the variations to Mimique , the Mallarméan text, whether by that word phantom one suggests some literal apparition or the work of metaphor. Ahead of definition, the phantom exceeds all such possibility, disabling the reading by pushing at the very limit of interpretability. As Derrida reminds us, this is a case of a radical, reflective mimicry ( Ulysse 206), recalling, and calling to, those oscillations, those numbers of yeses. The mime does not have a referent, even though elsewhere the Pierrot bears apparently some filial relation to the recurrent ghosts of Hamlet that trouble the text of Mallarmé (with Bennington, Jacques 195). The reference is not to that which is real but to another ghost, and thus one is witness to the play of difference, the doubling vibration between two mirrors belonging to what is termed a differential structure of mimicry. The ghost is the ghost of a ghost, trace of a trace. Haunting takes place both in the place of and as citation. The event of revenance taking place otherwise in citation is glimpsed if only because citation promises to make the invisible visible, though never as a presence, never present. In effect, the citational program, that which is supposed to take place, is displaced in its very act and in the demand that the act must occur. Thus the promise, premise, or program of citation is always already haunted within its very structural possibility before a word is written or rewritten. This promise, or unlooked-for gift, is inscribed in the citation of a name. It is that which takes place, if it takes place at all, in the proper name as the uncanny disturbance within its law and logic. It takes place especially in that moment, during a eulogy, for example, when the name returns, illuminating and making visible the one who is dead ( Politiques 21-22) and thereby in- citing, ex-citing, the projected spectrum of revenance and survival , living-on, living beyond death in the citation that apostrophizes the other (20). We can always anticipate this and thus cite the spectral return from the future, thereby opening ourselves to it. Again there is readable a strange and awful temporal disorganization. However, this is citation (l avenir IV à venir). This is what takes place when citation recalls the name. This is the work of citation: to return the voices of countless ghosts from what can all too easily be called the past and, somewhat less easily, the future, as though by the use of such temporal determinations everything could be fixed into place as though one could thereby have done with specters, with speculation, and with that haunting sensation every time words arrive from somewhere else. What</page><page sequence="13">Julian Wolfreys 33 is most haunting is that the movement of revenance never comes to a halt, with or without some consciousness to bear witness. It might be said that the spectral is everywhere all the time, and that the protocols surrounding citation are so precise, that the laws have multiplied themselves in the name of citation, citing countless examples along the way, if only so as to seek to calm or protect against the haunting vibrations and thereby keep at bay the haunts of citation; which haunts are those very places where citation takes place and to which it appears habituated, in which it finds itself most at home and yet where it can come to operate the most uncanny effects. Throughout this essay, I have acknowledged various texts by Derrida through abbreviation and page reference, even though they are not cited "directly." They are neither visible nor not visible. They are never present as such. It would be more accurate to suggest that they are cited without being cited, that their citations impose themselves without ever having been quoted verbatim. Citations "appear," in other words, in a semi-transparent, semi-encrypted fashion but hover somewhere between "correct" forms of citation and the barest possible acknowledgement while remaining tied to the protocols of academic citation. There is thus a situation, directly in relation to this essay, its subject and its writing, that is more or less impossible ("Oral" 192); it is a double bind having to do with hierarchical and other forms of relationship concerning the institutionalization, the normalization of location apropos of the matter of authority (193-94). However, and this is very much my point in this essay, even were I to abandon all pretense toward minimal acknowledgement, even were there to be no abbreviations here, nonetheless citation would always already have taken place. In playing on the limits of what acknowledges protocols and the possibility of citation, and, moreover citation concerning the question of the spectral, I have merely sought to highlight that spectralization that is the interest of any modality that is called citation. Of course, there is the merest possibility that this essay might be taken as an annotation, though hardly authoritative given its citational brevity, to all the sources that, conventionally understood, might be taken as the various authorities to which this essay appeals.
