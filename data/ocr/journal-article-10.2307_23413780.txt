Reviewed by Tobias Schneebaum Simon Kooijman's Art, Art objects, and Ritual in the Mimika Culture tills one ot the gaps in our knowledge of the art of West New Guinea. In recent years, a</page><page sequence="2">18 by the Japanese in the second World War, the Mimika people were forced to supply food for the more than one thousand soldiers. After the war, the MSCs returned and intensified their missionary work, setting up schools everywhere, so that by all villages had teachers. The Indonesian government took control over West New Guinea in 1 ybZ and the Mimika were again under a new government, confusing them with demands for change by a third outside culture. All this left the Mimika diffused and dislocated. Trenkenschuh has stated that "Mimika strikes a person as a dead area filled with zombies. There is no work and no interest in work. By 1970, almost all local art had disappeared and all artists were old men." Kooiiman's quote from Trenkenschuh says that Mimika "is a society without pride in itself and one which totally lacks any sense of excitement or enjoyment of life. " Nothing has been learned about Mimika culture since Pouwer's publications of the earlv 1950s; Knniiman has harl to hasp his research nn the earlv works, inrludinp the / ' / ' ' v_» Wollaston Report of 1912. His investigation of artifacts comes from the Mimika material in the Cambridge Museum of Archeology and Anthropology, the Museum of îvianKina, Lonoon, in ine iNauonai iviuseum 01 lennoiogy, Leiaen, aiiu uie c.uinograpiuc Museum 'Justinus van Nassau,1 National Museum of Ethnology, Breda, the Royal Tropical Institute, Amsterdam, and the Museum of Geography and Ethnology in Rotterdam. It is obvious that these collections have been studied with great care. The Leiden museum has the oldest Mimika collection of which the author is aware. Collected in 1828 by Salomon Muller, a member of the Triton Expedition, it consisted primarily of bamboo penis cases and body ornaments. In 1903, W. de 3ong, Captain of the "Van Doom", collected 13 ceremonial boards, drums, paddles, and weapons, mostly from Kaap Steenboom, and gave them to Leiden. Other Military EYnloration teams pave artifacts, and other collections were added, but analysis of these pieces is difficult because of the lack of documentation. The oldest material almost certainly comes trom the uta-Otakwa region, ine second most important group of artifacts is in Cambridge, probably collected by A.F.R. Wollaston on the Second British Expedition. The Papuans of Mimika live in the 300-kilometer stretch of southwest coastal New Guinea from Etna Bay to the Otokwa River, separated from Asmat on the east by an UllillilcLUiLCU died, d KlliU UI llU-HIdll b ldilU. ill LUC CcLl iy 1/^3, tue lVlllIUis.d puyuiCltiui 1 was estimated at 8,000 compared with the 30,000 Asmat Zegwaard had estimated in 1953. Although six distinct dialects comprise the Mimika language, other aspects of the culture, such as the food supply and ritual life, and relatively homogenous so that the name Mimika has rightly become associated with the groups scattered throughout the area. The art and mvths are included in this homogeneity. The dialects, according to ûrabbe (1953), are related to the various dialects of Asmat and, like Asmat, the Mimika region is a low-lyine swamp criss-crossed and interlaced with rivers and streams, creeks and tributaries, although there are none of the great Asmat river systems. In these waters the women fish, collect many types of shellfish and pound sago, the basic foods. A senru-nomadic life was necessary, with the people following the stands of sago as supplies dwindled. Again, like among the Asmat, traditional culture had an almost uninierrupiea series 01 leasts ana ceremonies ior wiucn specxuc ntucu uujecib weie made, including the great spirit poles, mbitoto, masks, three-dimensional female figures, sheild-like boards, yamate, and pierced prow decorations. One of the main</page><page sequence="3">19 cultural differences between the Asmat the the people of Mimika had to do with the system of revenge in Asmat and the almost continual state of warfare. Mimika was much less violent, though it is not known what the culture may have been like in the distant past. Art was an inextricable part of feasts and ceremonies and there were several types of carving necessary to ritual life. Unquestionably, the most pectacular of these are the mbitoro, spirit poles, much like the ancestor poles of the Asmat, called mbis. The poles are carved from the trunk and roots of a mangrove tree. Unlike the Asmat, the MimiKa did not carve tneir poles as part 01 a least ceieDrating a neadnunting raid tnat led to initiation ceremonies. The Mimika did not have the vengeful feelings necessary to life in Asmat. The mbitoro feast celebrated death and renewal of life as expressed in tne initiation ceremonies, ine A/iirruka wora ior "impersonal spirit" is mDii. i ne physical similarity between the Asmat and Mimika versions of the feast and poles are obvious, but so are the differences. The Mimika poles are far more stylized, with the figures hollowed out, delicate, stiff and hard-edged, qualities rarely seen in Asmat carving, with its firm, full-bodied figures. This scooped-out, hollow quality can be traced to the Mimika beliet that at death the igu, the personal spirit, and the nata, tne inner body, depart, leaving only the external body, the rind or kao. As in Asmat, the carved ligures are placed one aDove tne otner, usually two in MimiKa, wnereas in nsmai as many as thirty figures have been carved on .a single pole. One of the designs central to all MimiKa carvings is tne mopere or navei design, several 01 wnicn are usually iouna in the pierced projection at the top of the mbitoro. This navel design is the only Ui il vti oai oy 111 u\j i wi nouiai auu v^an uv^ xv^uuu in an aiv.aj) aiinvugn xi u iivi ao prominently placed as the Mimika mopere. The mopere, in fact, appears to be the starting point tor the designs surrounding it. Kooijman here quotes Fouwer: "When a carver wished to give a paddle a relief decoration, he started with this figure and then added the rest of the ornamentation. " The mbitoro were set up in front of the feast house as memorials to the dead; it was also part of the initiation and nose-piercing ceremonies. A photograph reproduced from C.G. Rawlings The Land of the New Guinea Pygmies (London) shows a "dancing hall", 17 meters wide, 6 meters high and 5 meters deep. The Iront was covered witn mats, while the roof and sides were of attap. During the feast, masks were worn to say farewell to the dead. It is not certain that the masks were worn during the mbitoro ceremony, although a 1928 photo by A.J. Wenting shows this to have been possible. Sago was also an important part of this feast, indicating the importance of women as producers of food, as wives, and as bringers of new me. After tne piercing 01 tne initiate's septum with a thorn from a sago palm, the initiate underwent a series of tests of strength and skill, after which he put on the bamboo penis case. After the mbitoro ceremony, the poles were taken into the stands of sago and left to rot so that the spirits within could protect the trees. As in Asmat, the ancestor pole was used in a ceremony of both homage and farewell to the dead, as well as the beginning of new life for the initiates. The complete function of the mbitoro and the full ceremonies connected with it, however, are not known. External influence from Indonesia and the Geelvink Bay area changed a great deal even before the arrival of the white man.</page><page sequence="4">20 Free-standing figures considerably smaller than the mbitoro, were also carved, ilthough their exact use is not known. Some of these are completely three-dimensional while others are two-dimensional. Such figures were stood up in front of the feast house luring the nose-piercing ceremonies. As far as the illustrations in this book are :oncerned, no double or multiple figure carvings such as those in Asmat are seen. A completely different type of carved figure xs also illustrated, a two-dimensional ane representing a man wearing a long-snouted mask. A curved loop at the groin shows the manner in wmcn older men raised xneir penes againsx xne aDdomen, xne ioresKin pulled up and held in place by a shell on a waistband. Apparently, only the penes of the older men were placed in this way; the young ones wore the bamboo penis case. This carving was probably used in the saeo larvae feast. Most of the illustrations show two-dimensional figures but one, whose provenance is not known, is solidly three-dimensional and resembles the figures of Northwest Asmat. The above examples are all male. There are also six iemale ligures, all collected in 1913. which were made for the Kiawa feast, with rituals related to death, the dead, ind the renewal of life. This ceremony was associated with women as the bringers of new life and with female fertility. Five of the six figures are of pregnant women standing with knees slightly bend, a swollen abdomen, arms bent with hands up near tne chin. Trenkenschuh states that Mimika was a matriarchal society and tnese iigures may be assessed in that light. Animal figures in Mimika may be either Iree-standing or as part oî decorations on ceremonial shields (yamate), prow ornaments and poles in feast houses. The free-standing ones are flat and stvlized and usually reoresentine hornbills and casuaries. birds used in the initiation ceremonies. At the end of this feast, the initiated boys and the men went outside the feast house and were met by the women wearing painted bark-cloth aprons. The men and boys held the carved birds on top of their heads and the women shot arrows into them. This emakame feast has many similarities with the emak cem feast of Asmat, also an initiation feast, the most obvious being the carved crocodile head at the end of the ridge pole, something that is also found among the Marind-Anim in the dema ceremonies. Singular to southwest costal New Guinea are the yamate, objects snaped like shields that presumably have a purely ceremonial function. There are two categories: (1) yamate with a symmetrical outer shape on which designs have been carved in relief; and (2) yamate that are asymmetrical and have pierced decoration. On type i, the very top may be pierced; the lower end has a pointed projection that allows the yamate to be planted in the grounds. Type 2 may be subdivided into those with all designs pierced and those with anthropomorphic figures more solidly worked. The yamate were set up in a row in front of the feast house during the emakame least, l ney mignt also be used to close off the doorways of the feast house. Other artifacts Kooijman lists under ceremonial objects are drums, prow ornaments, sago bowls, masks, and women's bark-cloth aprons, as well as such body ornaments as headdresses, armlets and nose-pieces. Daily life also had its inspired art in tne ornamented sides oi canoes, and ine decoranon on paaaies, sago pounaers, handles of chisels, neck rests, spears, arrow heads, and bamboo penis cases.</page><page sequence="5">21 This is a welcome and fascinating book, adding greatly to our knowledge of the art af New Guinea.
