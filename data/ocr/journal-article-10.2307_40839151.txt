<plain_text><page sequence="1">8 GREGORY BATESONfS COLLECTION FROM NEW BRITAIN AND THE SEPIK RIVER, NEW GUINEA. Antonia Lovelace This year will see the start of a project financed by the Crowther- Beynon fund to assess and publicize a collection made during 1927-30 and 1932-3 by Gregory Bateson, mainly from the Iatmul of the Sepik River, New Guinea, but also from the Baining and Sulka of New Britain and including odd items from New Ireland and the Siassi and Aua islands. The project will concentrate on the Iatmul material. It is hoped to combine both formal stylistic analyses of particular types of object and an analysis of the overall style of Iatmul culture and its interrelationship with other Sepik cultures in this assessment. The project will also assess Bateson's own contribution to the study of both Iatmul culture in general and Iatmul art and material culture in particular. It is this aspect which will be intro- duced here. First I give an outline of the circumstances of the collection, dates, places and contents, then a general review of Bateson1 s research and finally a review of his remarks on, and attitudes to, art and material culture (there is very little analysis of these topics in his published work). Circumstances of collection Gregory Bateson was a zoology student who was converted to anthropology on a Cambridge Antiquarian Society field trip to King's Lynn. fDr Haddon first made me an Anthropologist, telling me in a railway carriage between Cambridge and King's Lynn that he would train me and send me to New Guinea' (Naven, 1936, foreword). Bateson had returned from an unsuccessful trip to the Galapogos islands and a visit to Morgón' s Drosophila laboratory at Columbia University convinced he would be unhappy as a zoologist. The Cambridge Antiquarian Society was one of several avenues he tried to discover another vocation (Lipset 1980:113-4). Haddon too had been a convert from zoology, but a large part of the interest in this collection comes from the differences in Bateson' s approach to that of his first teacher. In his Decorative Art of British New Guinea</page><page sequence="2">9 of 1894 Haddon saw himself as describing species and variation in types of object, as against the art historian's concentration on the privileged few examples. The high points of his survey are the classifications of the variation in Torres Straits arrow heads, Papuan Gulf belts and Massim lime spatulas, but these are obviously marred for us by his thesis of degener- ative gradations from realistic representation in the anthropomorphic and zoomorphic motifs. Thirty years on Haddon was in charge of the New Guinea collections in the museum and researching the diffusion of techniques as well as the evo- lution of forms in such pet topics as canoes, tobacco pipes and toys. He was fascinated by the pattern of the distribution of cultures in New Guinea, particularly the possibility of connection between the Fly River and Papuan Gulf cultures and those, being described by German explorers and anthropologists, of the Kaiserin-Augusta Fluss or Sepik River. Large collections of material had already found their way to several German museums, and there were a few general surveys of the area, but little on the details of social structure. Bateson was to go to the Middle Sepik to provide such details, (he himself writes of the need to study the variations in black/white culture contact in the 100 mile long area of highly similar cultures in the Middle Sepik, in a letter to Haddon from London 16.7.1926) and also to make a collection for the Cambridge University Museum. However Bateson was persuaded by Chinnery, the government anthropologist for New Guinea, to spend some time among the Baining of New Britain first. Large head-hunting raids had recently been reported from the Sepik River and Chinnery considered it too dangerous a place for anyone inexperienced in bush-life. Bateson spent 10 months in Latromat village among the T sulky and recalcitrant1 Baining, then after a period in Sydney teaching Pacific languages under Radcliffe Brown, in the company of W. Lloyd-Warner, C. Wedgwood, R. Fortune and I. Hogbin, he returned to New Britain but deserted the Baining for a neighbouring coastal people, the Sulka. However this fieldwork proved just as frustrating, although the Sulka were voluble about selective aspects of their culture, Bateson fell ill with malaria and Sulka culture began to appear decaying. After five months he retreated to Rabaul. From there he went with a friendly schooner captain to the Admiral islands and up the Sepik (Lipset 1980:126-132). He spent six months in the Middle Sepik, mostly in the village of Mindimbit, before returning to Cambridge.</page><page sequence="3">10 / ' Ä io-285 ã /Ml 111 M km IW/W ufi ¿n 'rh y¿ y^' 3Ü.S4G '*-¿) ' l^i H ' / N 'S^ - Ï P I I fcg&gt;.'.&lt;g) y 1 'yj ; j^ PI ^ - -^^ IhW 5(1-248 'kv V-^7 Fig. 1 : Sketches of a few examples from Bateson's collection.

Remarks in square brackets are mine, the rest come from the museum's catalogue cards.</page><page sequence="5">12 In 1927 he sent back a 'box of curios1 (letter to Haddon 9.12.27), including material collected by E.W.P. Chinnery and by the schooner captain J.A.T. Thurston. This was followed by a rough catalogue of the different collections. The shipment arrived in 1930 and he and Haddon transferred most of the details to catalogue cards. A second shipment from his second trip to the Sepik was accessioned in 1935. These later cards are typed. All the cards give local names, remarks on usage, motifs, place of collect- ion and, where different, place of manufacture. There are also a few sketches of designs from Sulka barkcloth masks, with their names but little interpretation, and a few rolls of film, mostly of Iatmul initiation sequences. Some of the notes on usage, particularly for the 1935 accessions, for example for mwai masks and tshumbwan hooks, run onto several cards, but there is no stylistic assessment and little on the age of pieces or on individual artists and craftsmen. In all there are over 500 Iatmul pieces with some comparative pieces from Tshuosh villages and villages on the Lower Sepik, the Iatmul pieces include rain-hoods, toys, tools, and trays for paint as well as the more striking masks, hooks etc. (see cover and fig. 1). The New Britain material, approximately 100 items, is not so wide-ranging. I have only just begun to assess the strengths and gaps of the collection. Amongst Haddon' s papers are letters from Bateson from the field: these have a relaxed and lively tone. There are dutiful notes on tobacco seeds which he collected for Haddon and on the domestic fowl, dogs and hermaphrodite pigs. But also details of Bateson1 s emotional reaction to the Iatmul, for example: f - I could wish my people a little less "big- mouthed11. I feel instinctively shocked whenever they go off pop and stride up and down shouting and stamping. I should not so much mind their killing each other but I hate the uncivilized noise1 (letter from Mindimbit c. 25. 1.1930, p. 5). And remarks on the method of collecting: f... I have just been told that the only man who cultivates the long leaved tobacco is my pet aversion (reciprocated). I don't know whether I have the face to request to him for seed, (ibid, p. 5), and '... I am getting a man to collect on the Sepik for the benefit of Cambridge museum. I will make arrangements for the stuff to be packed in Rabaul and shall probably give him my rifle to keep him up to the mark. Whether this is worth while I do not know, all I feel sure is that he wants to do some collecting for any museum that will take the stuff off his hands. I shall not enquire too closely into his</page><page sequence="6">13 methods but I think that he is pretty straight1 (ibid, p. 11). Summary of Bateson's Published work on the Iatmul Before returning to the field Bateson wrote his master's dissertation summarizing his findings so far. This was published as an article, 'Social Structure of the Iatmul People of the Sepik River' Oceania (1932: 2:245-91, 401-53). The first part gives brief resumes of the geographical and physical conditions, neighbouring peoples, local organization and social grouping, and lastly material culture (three pages only, with sub- headings for dwelling houses and decorative art, the last being a summary of sorts of decoration found on different objects). The second part is concerned with kinship and the family, the third with clans, totems and personal names and the fourth with religion. The fifth and final part, the conclusion, attempts a vague delineation of structure and function, but analogy with the definite structures of anatomy leads Bateson to talk of a series of formulations instead of structures. An attempt is made to talk in terms of relations of equivalence between such formulations, on a parallel with the types recognised in biology; homology, analogy and homonomy (op. cit.:447). No analysis of such possible relations is actually undertaken 'owing to déficiences in the material a great deal of the analysis would be based on guesswork' (op.cit . :449) . So instead directions are hinted at for future research. This article is useful for concrete details of kinship terminology, totemism, shamanism and the elaborate naming system, and for its brief resume of types of decoration in the section on Decorative Art. It also shows the germ of disaffection with the emphasis in Radcliffe Brown's structural-functionalism on sociological structures and institutions rather than the patterns of cultural formulations or premises. However an attempt to analyse types of similarity in patterns of relationship seems to occur only as an afterthought and the article as a whole is disjointed and rambling. The personal developments that occurred in Bateson's second trip are well-known anthropological gossip. His meeting-up with Margaret Mead and Reo Fortune and the gradual change in their attachments are described in Mead's Blackberry Winter (Mead 1973:202-204, 208-240). This meeting, especially the opportunity to study a draft of Ruth Benedict's Patterns of Culture (1935) in the field, while searching for a way to describe the affectual tone or 'ethos' of Iatmul society, was to broaden Bateson's view- point, already much broader than that of Cambridge Anthropology, beyond the</page><page sequence="7">14 confines of British Anthropology and finally of Anthropology altogether. He finished writing Naven (first published in 1936) just before he and Margaret Mead were married in Malaya, preparatory to doing fieldwork in Bali. The book grew from ideas on the meaning of the transvestism and role-reversal practised in naven ceremonies; ceremonies which celebrate the first occasion of a cultural accomplishment by a sister's child. TMy field work was scrappy and disconnected - perhaps more so than that of other anthropologists... my own theoretical approaches (Oceania 1932: 484ff) proved too vague to be of any use in the field... I did not see clearly why I should enquire into one matter rather than another1. The outcome was a book which stressed the theoretical possibilities of focusing on a culture from three points of view: that of sociology viz. Radcliffe Brown's structural-functionalism, and that of two sides to the study of culture or cultural values, the study of ethos or affective struc- tures and functions, and the study of eidos or cognitive structures and functions. It was the study of Iatmul ethos which proved most illuminating. The sociology of naven leaves unanswered the problem of why the male transvestism takes the form of buffooning in widow's tatters while the female transvestism involves parading with pride in the finery of a homicide. Contrasts in male and female ethos, inter-sex envy and the slippage from boasting to buffooning in competitive male debates indicate affectual patterns prompting the particular styles of transvestism. The central mechanism fitting this argument together with that of the notion of the dynamic-equilibrium of a culture/society is that of schismogenesis. Schismogenesis is 'a process of differentiation in the norms of individual behaviour resulting from cum- ulative interaction between individuals' (1958:175). Where the relationship is that of unequal competition as in that between men and women, male initiators and novices, and that of a boasting sister's child and the mother's brother the progression is complementary, i.e. one of increasing assertion and submission respectively. Where the relationship is between equals, as between most Iatmul men, the progression is symmetrical, e.g. both parties become more and more aggressive or boastful. However the progression cannot be infinite and various behaviours sidetrack or counter- act it. Naven ceremonies are one of these counteractions.</page><page sequence="8">15 Bateson's new terminology of ethos and eidos and the concept of schismogenesis was not generally accepted by anthropologists. His interest in cultural psychology rather than social structure was not shared by most later researchers in 'British1 anthropology. But he went on to show that an emphasis on context and process in the evolution of relation- ships was illuminating in other fields. The breadth of his interests, together with his emphasis on fundamentals of patterns in different processes, can be gauged from the collection of his essays published in Steps to an Ecology of Mind (1973), which includes essays on his theory of double-bind in schizophrenia, on play and learning and animal communication, but also articles which show the identity of most of his theoretical concerns despite the number of fields he covered (see particularly the essay 'Form, Substance and Difference' pp. 423-440). Bateson's attitude to art and material culture Bateson's breadth of vision, some would say quirky eclecticism, is also demonstrated in his last book Mind and Nature, a Necessary Unity (1979) conceived as a primer to show the unity of approach possible in the study of nature and human mind/ life. It contains two references which are of particular interest for the present project. The first is a clear state- ment of his own process of argument in Naven (pp. 191-195) . The second occurs in the discussion with his daughter at the end of the book, entitled 'So What?1 Here he says he always wanted to probe the areas of art, aesthetics, consciousness and the sacred but felt he could never make his formulations clear enough. 'Now after all the discussion of mind and tautology and immanent differences and so on, I am beginning to be ready for symphonies and albatrosses... The question is onto what surfaces shall a theory of aesthetics be mapped ... there has to be a reason why these questions have never been answered... I think I would like to call my next book fWhere Angels Fear To Tread1, every one keeps wanting me to rush in. It is monstrous - vulgar, reductionist, sacrilegious, - call it what you will - to rush in with an oversimplified question. It is a sin against all three of our new principles. Against aesthetics and against consciousness and against the sacred1 (pp. 210-213) . This cautious reverential attitude to art has its roots in his stern yet colourful family background. His father was the biologist William Bateson who popularised the ideas of Mendel in this country (hence Bateson's Christian name). His 'view of literature and the arts was that</page><page sequence="9">16 they were the great thing in the world but that no Bateson would ever be capable of contributing to them. Art, to him, meant the Renaissance, pretty nearly, and of course nobody in the twentieth century could make Renaissance art. But science was something one could do. It was more conscious1 (Bateson in Lipset 1980:93). William's second son Martin clashed with him over this. Martin was a rebel with aspirations to literary greatness; he turned from zoology to drama, and as a mediocre drama student staged his own suicide under the statue of Eros in Piccadilly, after a young actress refused his unrequited love. William Bateson was a fervent art collector, who was made a trustee of the British Museum, a man who celebrated the birth of his first son John by purchasing an original copy of William Blake's Book of Job (Lipset 1980: 31). Gregory's first serious involvement with art was a presentation he gave to the 'Tea Club' group of undergraduate zoologists on Blake's poetry and mystical cosmology (Lipset 1980: 105-6), with which he became fascinated. Blake was to become, like Whitehead, Butler and Lamarck, a favourite source of inspiration and quotation. Bateson's only attempt to map out a theory of aesthetics 'Style, Grace and Information in Primitive Art' (1973:101-125) seems to allow a reverence for psychic integration or 'grace' to overshadow any attempt at comparative aesthetics. It is, as Bateson warns at the start, full of disparate suggestions rather than a rounded argument. In it he elaborates the different kinds and roles of unconscious thought and feeling, and suggests that art achieves a corrective integration of affective levels of conscious- ness. The concept of 'grace' is taken from Aldous Huxley. 'God resembles animals whose behaviour has a naivete, a simplicity which man has lost... God cannot deceive and is incapable of internal confusion ... Man has lost the grace which animals still have... Art is a part of man's quest for grace; sometimes his ecstasy in partial success, sometimes his rage and agony at failure. ' This quest is only part of great art however, and it has to be an integration from the depths of the primary processes, so 'some cultures may foster a negative approach to this difficult integration, an avoidance of complexity by crass preference either for total consciousness or total unconsciousness. Their art is unlikely to be great' (1973:102). And</page><page sequence="10">17 'Allegory, at best a distasteful sort of art, is an inversion of the normal creative process. Typically an abstract relation, e.g., between truth and justice, is first conceived in rational terms. The relationship is then metamorphized and dolled up to look like a product of primary process. The abstractions are personified and made to participate in a pseudomyth, and so on. Much advertising is allegorical in this sense, that the creative process is inverted1 (1973:109). He concludes that art exhibits, demonstrates, this dynamic integration and suggests sorts of correction in the direction of wisdom that can be achieved. The essay ends with an analysis of a Balinese painting, which is said to achieve the correction of affirming that to choose either turbulence or serenity as a human purpose would be a vulgar error. There is no discussion of how specific this affirmation is to Balinese culture, though in the essay before this in Steps to an Ecology of Mind, 'Bali, the Value System of a Steady State', he notes that 'a large proportion of our collection of 1,200 Balinese carvings shows a preoccupation on the part of the artist with problems of balance' (1973:93). Nor is there much dis- cussion of how other styles could achieve integration in a different way. The essay dismisses the problem of non-great arts which could be said to be more closely related to play (an activity to which Bateson elsewhere discusses more favourably, for example in 'A Theory of Play and Fantasy', (1973:167-172) where he argues that play indicates a capacity for meta- communication amongst otters). It also favours affective patterns rather than cognitive patterns of integration, just as it was ethos rather than eidos which was central in finding clues to the function of naven. This could be problematic with the high complexity of Iatmul totemic references and the abundance of these in their decorative and non-decorative arts. All these criticisms should prompt creative discordances in any attempt to summon the ghost of Bateson as mentor in this project. References Bateson, G. 1932.
