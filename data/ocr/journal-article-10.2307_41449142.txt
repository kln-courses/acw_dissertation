Martin, of McGill University, is an anatomist who has grave suspicions about conventional genetic theory. Once before he issued a minority report (Martin '53 ), and now he does it again, in a book that has the most eye-catching title in recent memory. Geneticists, says Dr. Martin, worship the orthodoxy of the "muta- tion-selection " theory, explaining away all that does not square with it, yet rejecting evidence to the contrary, and ignoring theories not contained within the several ideas of particularate inheritance, isolation of the genie material from environmental influences, natural selection, and mutation. Not quite a Lamarkian, and too much a naturalist to offer an Ã©lan vital , Martin assembles citations to prove "lingering modifications" ( Dauermodifikation ) and offers his own theory of why sex is important. Throughout, the argument is directed against what he thinks geneticists think, and that is why the objects of the objections are often so elusive. Now the study of evolution is an evolving science where the hetero- doxies of one era become the orthodoxies of another. The early post- Darwinian age of acceptance gave rise to the era of scepticism, and this in turn yielded to the Genetical Theory of Natural Selection . New ideas are to be welcomed; we still have much to learn about evolution. But Dr. Martin's ideas are a curious blend of last-century objections and half-understood concepts, both better illustrated than described. Mutations, he says, are pathological conditions. Why? Because known mutagens, such as nitrogen mustard and penetrating radiation are exceedingly injurious. What happens, he argues, is that the genes or "particles of the genes" are agitated, much as violent agitation can dislocate a man's thumb. And from this line of anthropomorphic reasoning, it is not difficult for him to decide that all mutations (being injuries) are harmful, whereas such characters as seem to be adaptive are simply examples of "lingering modifications." Ergo, as stated on page 81 "... I fail to see how the mutation-selection theory can be defended." As promised, psychology is drawn in, that is, the psychology of what used to be called instinctive behavior. Martin correctly cites many instances where the feeding preferences of a form have been modified by rearing the young on a non-preferred plant, on an unaccustomed</page><page sequence="2">294 BOOK REVIEWS diet. Such examples, he feels, show that preferences can be modified and the new preference then becomes hereditary. The rest of us would see here the effects of learning: increasingly much of what used to be called instinctive, now appears to be learned. Even such seemingly basic "instincts" as the nesting instinct in the pregnant rat, or the " grooming " instinct depend upon the previous experiences of the animal in question. So the whole argument about the modification - and - inheritance of behavior dissolves into a simple exercise in learning theory. As to sex, Martin rejects the conventional explanations. The idea that new genotypes are thus produced is insufficient for him ; " shuffling the genes destroys gene-complexes just as fast as it creates them." (This, of course, is not at all true.) But his explanation for the survival of sex involves "its usefulness as a restriction on the trans- mission of the prejudices, aversions and partialities of parents to their offspring." For an understanding of this explanation, the book must be read. The real value of the present work lies in the large number of rarely-quoted minority reports he cites. They include the work of Kammerer, whose unfortunate history Martin does not recount, and other publications where modifications were claimed to persist for many generations. They include, also, accounts of the reversion of domes- ticated lines to "wild" types, and others where hereditary traits are shown to persist only on a particular diet. (They do not include references to DeLamarck, whose inferences that the peculiarities of domesticated animals and plants are due to nutrition, are at least partly correct.) What Psychology, Evolution and Sex does show, is the increasing difficulty of tackling one field, with the conceptual tools and references of another. Despite Martin, the autopsy table is not a proving ground for genetical theory, nor does embryological similarity prove that no new evolutionary characters have entered into pre-natal development.
