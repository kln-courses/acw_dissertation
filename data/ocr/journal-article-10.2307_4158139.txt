<plain_text><page sequence="1">BIRDS AS INDIVIDUALS, By Len Howard. Collins, London, 1952:223 pp., 32 plates. 10s. 6d. ($1.47). Miss Howard is an English musician and amateur ornithologist who has succeeded, through extraordinary patience and tolerance, in overcoming completely the normal fear of humans in the small passerine birds around her Sussex cottage. Not only do birds come fearlessly to her hand while out-of-doors, but they also have complete free- dom of the house; some even roost in the bedroom with the author. She wisely lists the disadvantages as well as the pleasures of such a living arrangement at the start of the book. Probably no other writer has ever been so closely acquainted with so many unconfined wild birds, and Miss Howard's observations and conclusions will be of interest to all students of avian behavior. The book is divided into two sections. The first section, of 150 pages, is entitled "Bird Behavior." In this portion the author narrates her experiences with birds of her neighborhood, particularly Great Tits (Parus major) and Blackbirds (Turdus merula). This makes pleasant reading and includes many interesting and important notes on the great differences in behavior shown by individuals within a species. One such note tells of a Great Tit which, after being seriouisly injured and defeated in combat with another male, recovered his territory from the erstwhile victor by improvising highly elaborate bluff and threat displays. Another is the account of a Blackbird which always used an oak leaf held in his beak as an aid in courtship and territorial activity. Obser- vations of this sort illustrate well the intraspecific plasticity which may lead to the evolution of new and striking behavior patterns. The first section is concluded with a chapter entitled "The Mind of a Bird" which is probably the most controversial part of the book. In this chapter the author criticizes modern behavior theory for not attributing a greater and more human degree of intelli- gence and emotion to birds. Miss Howard makes a good case for the intelligence of some of the birds with which she is intimately acquainted, but whether or not some of the activities she describes should be attributed to reasoning or human-like emotions is largely a matter of opinion. No ornithologist would deny that birds often seem closely attached to their mates or young ("love"), or are aggressive toward rivals ("jealousy"), etc., but it is certainly debatable that birds feel such emotions in a way similar to humans. The reader may decide for himself whether Miss Howard is correct in taking the affirmative. Beyond this, probably few biologists will agree with her proposal that birds have some system of thought transference or mental telepathy, despite the claims of parapsychologists. The second and shorter section of the book is an analysis of technique in bird song, written primarily from the standpoint of a musician. Miss Howard's perceptive dis- cussion will be enjoyed by American readers even though they may be unfamiliar with the songs of the species described, and the authors deep appreciation and feeling for music has moved her to some charming descriptive passages. Miss Howard is consciously anthropomorphic in some of her interpretations, but, as before, she offers reasons for her opinions.
