<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ARISTOTELIAN TELEOLOGY. THE one marked characteristic of the early Greek cos- I mology was its nayve acceptance of the causelessness of the cosmic process. As a matter of the history of thought, it was but natural to the speculation of the Greek cosmologists, who were accustomed to the notion, not of dead things obedient to mechanical law, but of things animated by inner impulses, to presuppose the conception of movement and change as one that is intelligible in itself and in need of no further explana- tion; or to regard that ' explanation' as sufficient which derived the relatively complex from simple materials through simple and well-known processes, as, e.g., rarefaction and condensation. The conception of any deeper meaning or reason dwelling in the world-process could follow only upon a scepticism which forced the mind to revise critically its formiace. The agnostic sensationalism of the Sophists forced upon Socrates the necessity of discovering a new philosophical method or instrument. But, although with Socrates himself cosmological investigations were quite arbitrarily burked, yet the spirit of the philosophy of the Concept was universal, and meant, at last, a critical revision of the early cosmological pre- suppositions. The most important contribution, in the history of Greek philosophy, to the philosophical interpretation of cos- mic reality was Aristotle's critical reconstruction of the Platonic doctrine of ' Substance' and concept of the 'Idea of the Good.' In the systematic period of Greek philosophy the principles gained through the Sophists and Socrates were applied in such wise that there resulted, on the one hand, through Democritus, a purely mechanical explanation of the cosmos, and on the other hand, through Plato, an a priori, but not immanent, teleological explanation. Aristotle effects a reconciliation of necessity and finality in finding, by way of the essential relation of Form and Matter, or the idea of immanent teleology, both principles</page><page sequence="2">THE ARISTOTELIAN TELEOLOGY. 387 equally valid for the philosophical interpretation of the cosmic process. We shall, therefore, briefly indicate the character of the Platonic teleology, that we may the better appreciate Aris- totle's reconstruction; then repudiate the misapprehensions, on the part of certain modern philosophers, of Aristotle's meaning; and finally determine, without metaphysical construction, the philosophical value of (the idea of) immanent teleology. The Platonic metaphysic begins with a critical appreciation of the Sophistic theory of sense perception. The consequence of Plato's accepting the Protagorean theory of perception, in order to transcend it, was to furnish a distinction between rela- tive and true knowledge, and, therewith, a corresponding dis- tinction between appearance and reality. The search for the concept, which was with Socrates merely an inductive method of knowledge, becomes with Plato a search for reality: true being is the being of the concept. It is, accordingly, an incor- poreal (aclao-carov) world that forms the object of true knowl- edge. But just as sensuous perception and true knowledge exist side by side, differing in kind, so, too, their objects exist independently of one another.1 With respect to knowledge and real existence, Plato conceives the nearer relation of the real (' ideal') and the phenomenal worlds as one of similarity. The world of the Ideas is one of archetypes; and in so far as the world of individual things ' imitates,' or ' partakes of,' the char- acter or quality of the Ideas, so far have individual things just their degree of reality, and just so far the Ideas or archetypes themselves are capable of being known. For with Plato him- self knowledge of the Ideas themselves is a recollections of pure immaterial forms, now occasioned by the likeness in cor- poreal things to those immaterial forms, a real knowledge of which the soul possessed in a higher world and purer life.3 "What Socrates, in his doctrine of the formation of concep- tions, had designated as ' induction,' became transformed, there- fore, for Plato into an intuition that proceeds by recollecting, I Aristotle, Met., i, 6, 987 b; xii, 4, 1078 b, 12. 2 Plato, Meno., 8o b. 3 Plato, Phaedrus, 246f:</page><page sequence="3">388 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. VI. into reflection upon a higher and purer perception." 1 But now, for that reason, just as there are many empirical percep- tions, there will be at least just as many Ideal archetypes, unless some principle of evaluation determines what perceptions have genuinely possible archetypes. Hence, the point to be emphasized here is that, although the archetypal world was con- sidered by Plato the more valuable metaphysically in compari- son with the phenomenal world, Plato yet possessed no principle of evaluation of such a sort as to determine within the arche- typal world what Ideas were genuinely real, or whether any and what relations obtained between Idea and Idea. Thus in hav- ing, for all that Plato could say to the contrary, as many Ideas or archetypal units as there are empirical units or perceptions, the world of Ideas is, as Aristotle submitted,2 just "the world of perception thought over again in conception." Under the criticism of Aristotle, as we think, Plato has become fully conscious that the Ideal world is not yet a system.3 In Plato's first draft of the Ideal theory, while his interest was logico-metaphysical, reality stood over against appearance and wholly separate from it: the Ideas, in short, were not prin- ciples of movement and change, and, therefore, not the ' ground' and ' cause' of phenomena. At last in Plato's own eyes the conception of true being or real substance demanded that the absolute separation, and mere 'imitative ' relation, of Idea and phenomenon be broken down for a relation of dependence. The concept which transforms Plato's Ideal theory is that of the supreme (ethical) category - the Idea of the Good. Plato's study of human nature - of psychology and society - has revealed to him a new and intimate relation between the empirical world (the phenomenon of human life) and the Ideal world, which he will apply universally and within the Ideal world itself. The Idea of the Good is disclosed in the Republic and the Philebus as the cause (airla) 4 and final end (re'Xos, ro o' ePEKa) 5 of all reality. But still the world of Ideas and the ulti- 1 Windelband, Gesch. d. Phil., Eng.

Consequently, the intimate causal relation that obtains between the Ideal and empirical worlds is not a mechanical, but a teleological relation: the Idea of the Good effects cosmical processes by its mere presence, as pure final cause or absolute end of phenomena. Not only is the world of Ideas in a teleo- logical relation to the world of phenomena, but the world of Ideas itself is in teleological relation to the Idea of the Good, the absolute end of all reality. That is to say, the logical, ethical, and physical world-ground are one and the same, or the universe in its wholeness has an absolute moral meaning.1 The Platonic metaphysic is the first apriori teleology in the history of Greek philosophy. Unfortunately Plato identified the Idea of the Good with the Anaxagorean world-reason, and modern philosophers interpreting the Anaxagorean vooDs in terms of our psychological values,' and also failing to distinguish between Plato's metaphysic and a special application, on his part, of that metaphysic, have made Plato, as they have on similar grounds also made Aristotle, a ' designist ' rather than a ' teleologist,' as if Plato and Aristotle regarded the world as having been made by hands, or as having had reason put into it, and not as having reason originally immanent in it, by virtue of its own absolute nature or constitution. The motive or method of the Anaxagorean teleology was a posteriori; the doctrine itself could claim no higher validity than that of quasi- inductive probability. In Plato's doctrine the Anaxagorean motive appears only in the Timaeus. The metaphysic of the 1 The characteristic limitation of Greek psychology, until Aristotle, is its failure to determine the nature of the ' soul ' in terms of pure spirituality. The soul is always not only the principle of perception, but also of life and motion. Besides, the soul as perceptive possesses no creative activity: its content is always given. And now, for Plato, immateriality (ellos dcrLbArTov) is in no wise synonymous with spirituality. We can define the incorporeal only negatively. The Idea of the Good, with which Plato has identified the Anaxagorean voos, and voDs itself will, therefore, be subject to interpretation in terms of these Greek psychological values. Consequently, since the Idea of the Good cannot be interpreted in terms of per- sonality, the teleological relation of the phenomenal world to the Ideal world, and of the system of Ideas to the Idea of the Good, can represent simply the absolute moral meaning of the Universe.

Republic and the Philebus belongs to Plato's philosophy as a metaphysical system. On the other hand, the mythus of the Timaeus merely illustrates what cannot be scientifically known. With Plato the ethical world is the world that can be scientifi- cally known. True, therefore, to his epistemological postulate, he can give no metaphysic of Nature which has any scientific or strictly philosophical validity: about the order of Nature he ventures only opinions (&amp;otat), not scientific knowledge (erUTl IWOr We must in the case of Plato, as also in the case of Aris- totle, distinguish the motive for any special application of his metaphysical concepts from the metaphysic itself. Thus, the mythus of the Timaeus is but an attempt, on Plato's part, to read the meaning of his metaphysic into Nature: it is avowedly his ' unscientific opinion' as to how the order of Nature may be explained on a teleological basis. Out of non-being, which, like the Aristotelian ' matter,' is also the accessory cause of the nature-order, and the ground of its mechanical necessity, a 8,utovpryo', or world-architect, acting according to ends (i.e., according to the immutable Ideas of the supra-sensuous world),' constructed " this one most perfect and beautiful cosmos, unitary in its nature and unique in its kind." But philosophically con- sidered, the ultimate in explanation, the primitive unit, is with Plato the absolute movement of the system. The originally given is the teleological whole. Particular changes or events are the resultants of the absolute teleological system; they are not, as with Democritus, the brute resultants of the mechanical play of particular atom-forms. The Aristotelian teleology develops by the slightest recon- struction, and in the simplest way, from the metaphysic of the Republic and the Philebus. The Platonic Idea of the Good and the teleological system of Ideas represented, as we saw, simply the absolute moral meaning of the universe. But a real teleo- logical relation between the real (I ideal') and the phenomenal worlds cannot obtain, if the Idea of the Good remains pure 1 See Republic, 596-598.</page><page sequence="6">No. 4.] THE ARISTOTELIAN TELEOLOGY. 39I final cause. In order to effect movement and change, the final causes of the Ideal world, as Aristotle perceived,' must become efficient causes through immanency in phenomena the Ideal world must become, that is, the constitutive end and cause of being and becoming. The a priori tele- ology which Plato had set up as a postulate and had applied (in the Timaeus) in mythical form, Aristotle thoroughly and consistently carried out in conceptions by transforming, first of all, Plato's Ideas into immanent causes or constitutive principles of being and becoming, and secondly, his Idea of the Good, as absolute end of all, into self-conscious spirit. This transformation is effected through the new concept of the essential relation of Form and Matter, as constituting true being. Real substance, Aristotle says, is self-realizing essence (I entelechy '). In striving after perfection of being the entel- echies of things necessarily determine the cosmic processes teleologically. But the world of immanent entelechies is a con- tingent world. It exists, therefore, for an absolute entelechy. Nature strives after and produces the good, in as far as the sum total of cosmic beings individually realize perfection of being; that is, in the last analysis, the self-possessed or resting being of the absolute entelechy. As pure Form the absolute entelechy is pure activity -i.e., pure thought. The cosmos is, therefore, determined by a transcendent and absolute spirit to an ideal or moral order. As with Plato, so with Aristotle, the ultimate in explanation, the originally given, is the teleological whole. With one pur- pose all creation moves toward " one far-off divine event." Yet, in Aristotle's doctrine, all anthropomorphism is absent. The world-ground is not a 8?,Utovppyo"S. The world-principle, though a spiritual being, with respect to the world does nothing, wills nothing, creates nothing - in nowise interferes. But while the absolute entelechy determines the world-process simply by his mere existence as absolute entelechy, all being and becom- ing within the world itself are determined by constitutive or immanent entelechies. These entelechies, immanent and tran- 1 Met., i, 6. 988 a, 6; cf. 1078 b, 35.</page><page sequence="7">392 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. VI. scendent, are but Plato's system of Ideas and the Idea of the Good - all the entelechies being in teleological relation, not only to themselves, but also to the absolute entelechy. As particular phenomena had with Plato higher metaphysical truth or value, in as far as they represented better their Ideal arche- types; so phenomena have with Aristotle higher metaphysical truth and reality, in as far as their self-realizing essences approach more nearly to the resting being of the absolute entelechy. Finally, matter and necessity are with Aristotle, as with Plato, the accessory causes of cosmic being and becoming; and Aristotle's final and formal causes, as the Ideas and the Idea of the Good with Plato, most truly explain appearance and reality. The Aristotelian metaphysics is, as we think, funda- mentally a reconstruction of Plato's a priori teleology. On the ground that Aristotle holds to a doctrine of the immanence and transcendence of the Good, we have defined Aristotle's teleology as a priori and objective. Such we desig- nate it more specifically on the ground that Aristotle's method and motive are not Anaxagorean, and that his doctrine of necessity is not Democritean. Undoubtedly Aristotle's bio- logical and medical studies must have impressed upon his mind the presence of intricate adaptations of parts and of functions in the case of animal organisms. These, however, could not have had a philosophical significance for him, until he had been trained in the school of Plato. It is indeed to be expected that the philosophical principles he may have matured while in the school should seem to him, on the basis of his empirical studies, to have universal application and high empirical warrant. And so it happens that, aside altogether from his metaphysical treatise, there occur everywhere throughout his distinctively physical writings a statement of, and an insistence upon, cer- tain general philosophical concepts, which can be understood only if we consider that Aristotle is applying specifically some philosophical concept for the true interpretation of empirical reality. Indeed he is everywhere expressing his fundamental belief in, and seeking empirical proof and illustration of, the purposive activity of Nature, the finality of the cosmic process.</page><page sequence="8">No. 4.] THE ARISTOTELIAN TELEOLOGY. 393 The very fact that, as Romanes says,' " the only respect in which he [Aristotle] differs from a modern Darwinist - although even here the school of Wallace and Weismann agree with him -is in holding that adaptation must be present in all cases, even where the adaptation is not apparent," is clear proof, to our mind, that Aristotle is in possession of a metaphysical prin- ciple which he is at all times applying and trying to verify. This view is vindicated by the fact that wherever Aristotle does find order or adaptation he attributes it directly to a con- stitutive cause (entelechy), or fundamental finality in things. We need but consult the familiar passage in the Physics (II, 8) to see that Aristotle will accept no explanation of organic forms which insists upon the Empedoclean ' natural selection,' or the Democritean ' brute necessity' of matter. On the other hand, he himself submits2 that " it is manifest there is finality in the processes and phenomena of Nature; and since Nature has two principles, Form and Matter, the one existing as end and the other existing for the sake of the end, the final end must be the determining cause." And in his De Partibus Animalium he insists over and over again that there are but two methods or principles of scientific explanation, and that finality must take precedence over necessity. Romanes cites De Partibus Animalium (I, 5, 645) to prove that Aristotle was not a designist or teleologist, " except in the sense of being in every case antecedently convinced that organic structures are adapted to the performance of definite functions, and that the organism as a whole is adapted to the conditions of existence. That is to say," he continues, "he is a believer in adaptation or final end, but leaves in abeyance the question of design or final cause. Romanes' terminology is peculiar to himself. Aristotle, how- ever, to keep to this terminology, believes in 'adaptation ' or final end'; that is to say, he believes, on philosophical grounds, that every being or organism has an end in existing, and that it is adapted just by its own inner essence or nature (ivtie), 1 " Aristotle as a Naturalist," Contermom;y Review, February, 1891, p. 279. 2 PAys., ii, 8, 199 a, 29.</page><page sequence="9">394 TILE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. VI. and by nothing extrinsic, to its end, namely, perfection of being. But, on the other hand, Aristotle, though a believer in 'final cause,' which is at the same time always ' final end,' does most emphatically not believe in anthropomorphic design, or in 'final cause' in Romanes' sense of ' first cause.' Aristotle's 'first cause' (first ontologically), or Unmoved Mover, is in no wise a Creator or Contriver of a world, an anthropomorphic designer who 'does something to' the world. The Unmoved Mover is pure 'final cause,' and effects the world-process simply through his mere existence, as perfect being, whose perfection (resting being) it is the will of imperfect beings to strive to realize in and for themselves. And Aristotle most emphatically asserts, properly on philosophical grounds,' the finality of the ordered universe in its wholeness, and, consequently, of all movement and change within the whole. Romanes,2 Darwin,3 and Lewes I have missed the point of Aristotle's statements in his Physics and .De Part. An. With Aristotle 'adaptation' is but a 'resultant' or 'case' of that finality which belongs to the cosmos in its wholeness. Besides, the adaptation of which Romanes and Darwin are speaking is with Aristotle merely secondary and relative; that is to say, it is merely an aspect or moment in something ' final,' namely, the complete realization of a certain whole, or characteristic unity of being. It is this total finality, this end and perfection of being, that, in Aris- totle's eyes, determines the nature and possibility, the meaning and worth, of particular adaptations, when they exist. The point, so Aristotle himself submits,5 with regard to this question is that the ' adaptation ' of ' natural selection' (Empe- doclean) does not afford any raison d'tre of the organism; it merely explains survival. The adaptation did not efficiently or finally 'cause' the organism. On the contrary, the organism, its inner ' nature ' or its ' end,' which is just itself perfected, ' causes' and explains the adaptation. " For the process of 1 Met.

The fittest mode, then, of interpretation is to say: A man (e.g.) has such and such parts, because the conception of a man includes their presence, and because they are the necessary conditions of his existence, or, at any rate, of his per- fection; and these conditions in turn imply antecedent condi- tions. Thus, we should say, because man is an animal with such and such characteristics, therefore is the process of devel- opment such as it is, and therefore is it accomplished in such and such an order; and after like fashion we should explain the evolution of all other works of Nature." Again, Aristotle's doctrine of necessity is not Democritean. natural law and the nature-order are, for Aristotle, teleological law and moral order. There is first of all absolute necessity in things; this absolute necessity is, however, but the expression of the immanent or essential finality of the originally given, namely, the teleological whole determined to unity of purpose by and for the absolute or original entelechy of the world. This essential and total necessity or finality determines a priori and within the cosmos all particular outer and hypothetical necessities. All forms of finality and of necessity, both hypo- thetical and absolute, are explained by the teleological relation of the immanent and the transcendent entelechies. From the point of view of the teleological whole, necessity is, as we said, but the expression of complete finality. Within the whole, mechanism is subordinate to, and realizes, purpose. There is for Aristotle also an absolute necessity or spontaneity (-ro avro',uarov) in things which on its own account produces the lawless - the absurd and brutish. But still within the cosmos there is a preponderance (not accidental, but essential) of finality over necessity; an inner necessity or finality determines 'on the whole' (KaO' O'Xov), or ' for the most part' (ewl - woX6o) all outer and hypothetical necessity. In opposition to Democritus, Aristotle submits that all movement and development are the 1 De Part. An., i, i, 640 a, i8 ff. Cf. Met.

VI. resultant of the originally given and the teleological relation of the immanent and the transcendent entelechies - that is, of the teleological whole, and not of the brute play of unrelated or particular atom-forms. Romanes' essay on "Aristotle as a Naturalist" is all the more false because it expresses a half-truth. If we remember that Aristotle's teleology is a metaphysical deduction, and that it centres about the concept of self-realizing essence (entelechy), which, as both constitutive end and cause, ever seeks perfection of being, it is clearly false to assert, as Romanes does, that Aristotle regards purposive activity in Nature as proceeding, "'not from the mind of a creator, but rather of an architect who does the best he can with the materials supplied him, under the conditions of necessity." Romanes here reverts to the concept of ' design.' For such an interpretation of his doctrine Aristotle himself is responsible, through his unfortu- nate attempt to make plain his meaning, under the analogies of artifice and biological development. Form and Matter, with Aristotle, really are not entities; they are, or express, the rela- tional or functional aspects of one teleological whole or process. On the one hand, individual organic bodies are regarded by Aristotle as self-realizing Forms; on the other hand, individual bodies, organic and inorganic, in relation to one another, afford the occasion and possibility of teleological functioning, and effect through that relation the cosmic process. But there is the cosmos only; and all mechanical, chemical, and inorganic changes occur within and for a cosmic whole; they are func- tions of one cosmic process; they are, in short, but expressions on the part of the members of a single end or purpose govern- ing the universe, -the end, namely, of attaining to absolute perfection, represented as the resting being of the deity. We may, then, if we please, agree with Romanes in saying that in as far as Aristotle was a mere naturalist " he found that the hypothesis of purpose was a good working hypothesis in his biological researches "; but we must remember that, as philoso- pher, Aristotle's teleology is a metaphysical deduction; his work- ing hypothesis is not an induction from empirical fact, although</page><page sequence="12">No. 4.] THE ARISTOTELIAN TELEOLOGY. 397 he will give his metaphysical deduction empirical illustration and verification. These two moments ran along together in Aristotle's philosophical development. But he is everywhere insisting that the apriori and objective teleological view alone gives true insight into the strictly cosmical nature of things; that, therefore, the view of the empirical scientist must be sup- plemented and guided by that of the metaphysician ' who sees that what is last in the order of time "is first in the light of the phenomenon's fixed nature." On the side of motive and method Aristotle's teleology is deductive; as, centring about the concept of self-realizing essence, it is, in its nature, immanent or objective. Aristotle was bound down to this a priori and immanent teleology, as being just the further interpretation of the Platonic doctrine of real substance (ovidaa). We cannot, he says, think Form apart from Matter, and conversely. Matter to be really existent must embody Form, or Form to be really existent must be bodied forth in Matter: " Substance takes being from quality; quality actuality from substance." The a priori Form is the constitutive end and cause of the really existent. Matter and necessity exist for the entelechies; but, while the cosmic entelechies are immanent principles or causes of development, and, as immanent, exist on their own account, they have them- selves a transcendent ground. We define Aristotle's teleology, therefore, as deductive and immanent on the ground of his insistence upon the ' a-priority ' of the entelechies, as constitu- tive ends and causes of cosmic being and becoming, and of pure spirit as absolute end and cause of all reality. All is for God, from God, and to God. Spiritual monotheism - hardly spirit- ual monism - is the ripe fruit of Greek philosophy. Aristotle's metaphysic is indeed spiritual and teleological, but not in the deepest and most significant sense. The relation of God to his world never becomes with Aristotle one of complete immanency. The world-ground is absolutely transcendent, excludes, rather than contains, by actively constituting, the 1 De Part. An., i, r, 640 f, 22.</page><page sequence="13">398 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. VI. world. There is no reason in the nature of God why the cos- mos should be at all, or be such as it is. And yet in spite of the transcendency of the deity, the nature-order is a moral order. That is the fundamental paradox in Aristotle's system: God is, and yet, on the grounds which Aristotle alleges, cannot be, the cause of the world. To have discovered the existence of God, as Aristotle actually did, by writing an argument from the contingency of the world with an argument from the idea of immanent teleology, was inevitably to separate God from the world, as pure spirit, in the most inane sense. On the other hand, to have spiritualized the meaning of the idea of immanent teleology, by a thoroughgoing and consis- tent deduction, would have been to have determined the rela- tion of God to his world as not only immanent and essential, but also as transcendent - because his is a creative, constitu- tive function. History speaks at once as if there were an inherent discrep- ancy in a system which maintains such an absolute dualism as spiritual monotheism and a teleological naturalism. The Peripatetics themselves began the work of reconstruction by repudiating the Aristotelian God. By destroying the tran- scendency of God, and still keeping the world alive with reason (teleological), the Stoics naturally and inevitably passed from Aristotelianism to pantheistic naturalism. Appreciative criti- cism of Aristotle's teleology, on the part of a modern philoso- pher, may more easily and naturally follow the older criticism, and reconstruct the idea of immanent teleology in terms of naturalism. The universe is alive as one vast organism. The outer order is just the external aspect or expression of an unconscious will behind the scenes. The external mechanical necessity of the phenomenal order is but the expression of a noumenal or inner necessity (teleology of the whole). All is the expression of the life of the unconscious world-will. There is no necessity apart from finality, and, conversely, there is no finality without necessity. But since the world-will is not definitely conceived in terms of self-consciousness, as a will which knows its own meaning,</page><page sequence="14">No. 4.] THE ARISTOTELIAN TELEOLOGY 399 and whose world is its eternal choice, its wholeness is given to it, its unity as a will is fictitious, and really naturalism appears as disguised materialistic monism. One may take the idea of immanent teleology, and if it be constructed empirically, one will remain with this system of atheistic monism. On the other hand, the idea of immanent teleology, if deductively con- structed in idealistic terms, as it must be, results in spiritual monism. That Aristotle's system did not actually become spiritual monism is due properly, we think, to the fact that being in want of our epistemological presuppositions he actually deter- mined the significance of the idea of immanent teleology empir- ica/ly. To determine the significance of the idea empirically is simply to universalize it. Thus, the living organism wills to live: nothing makes it what is or becomes, except its own essential nature. It is itself its own constitutive end and cause, its own promise and potency. The organism itself is ever self- active, self-formative, self-developing. No reason explains it except its very self. As it is its own end and cause, all is in and for the organism itself. The world is just such a living, self-active, self-developing whole. Now to universalize the meaning of the idea of immanent teleology, as empirically determined, will never take one beyond itself, and will never determine the inner nature of reality. The solution of this problem is contained in the meaning of how all can be in and for one living reality. This is possible only if the one living reality is self-conscious, and therefore the consti- tutive principle of a complete and significant world. Accord- ingly, the proof of objective idealism is the disproof of naturalism. Then the real and significant order of the universe is that order which has its meaning originally and eternally complete. This order cannot be an ' evolution' in the ordinary scientific sense, for that remains forever incomplete and insignifi- cant; it is properly what Hegel would call an 'emanation'- i.e., the self-differentiations of an ultimate identical spiritual essence. The immanent teleology, for idealism, belongs to the inner spiritual whole in its self-conscious completeness. That self- conscious, and therefore complete and significant, process is</page><page sequence="15">400 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. the only ideal or moral order. The outer reality, our phenom- enal world, is our own free (a priori) construction, and in our world, which is an abstraction from the spiritual whole, there is nothing but brute fact and rigid necessity. Externality qua externality is essentially human, finite, paradoxical, -the frag- mentary aspect of an incomplete point of view. We cannot see in the nature-order, in cosmical evolution, anything truly sig- nificant; we cannot see spirituality and the realization of ideals there. The heavens do not declare the glory of God; the firmament does not show his handiwork. Nature tells us not of God. Its very insignificance, its sterility, its caprice -the fact that it will mean nothing to us, if it pleases - tells us that its truth is not there as we look, and drives us back from itself to the inner heart of reality. So far as we look on we merely see Reason, as Hegel says, the deeper reason of things, " in nature gone out of itself into its ' other'- its extreme opposite irrationality." Nature conceals rather than reveals the deeper truth of real- ity, because its order is determined by the categories of a " dis- cursive understanding." Necessity and Contingency are the categories of a finite, external observer, and his describable world. No event in a space and time world can be caused by a mind which is essentially above space and time. God cannot be conceived, therefore, as an external observer, and the cause, of the world. God is the one constitutive mind; and only an absolute mind, or 'perceptive understanding,' possesses signifi- cant truth, because his self-conscious, complete experience is the truth. The life of the absolute mind is constituted as one of the absolute freedom of reason; in that life free spiritual ideals alone are realized. But we, as self-conscious beings, also actively constitute ourselves members of that spiritual life. The freedom of our life, the spiritual significance of our morality, is bound up in our self-conscious choice of ideals, in our active cooperation with the mind and will of God. J D. LOGAN.
