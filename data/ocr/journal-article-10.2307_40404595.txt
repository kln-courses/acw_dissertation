What accounts for its universality? Is our spe- cies primarily homo religiosas and only secondarily homo sapiens} Has religion been a crucial adaptation in human survival? Has it played a beneficial role in human evolution? Even if so, has some turning point been reached mak- ing this no longer so? Why, after all the gains made by science and secular- ism, has there been a massive worldwide revival of religion and retreat from enlightenment values? These are some of the questions raised by Alexander Saxton in this provocative book. Saxton sees the origin of religion in a crisis of consciousness grounded in realization and fear of death: When the advent of consciousness imposed knowledge of individual death, our ancestors sought solace from this terror by projecting anthropomorphic images onto nature and imputing reality to those images as spiritual beings. (63.) Religion made possible a representation of a universe that is ultimately or- derly and trustworthy. This collective belief system made it possible for our species to overcome paralyzing fear of death and thus to survive physically. Moreover, religion maintained morality, i.e., social cohesion, even class and gender domination, which enabled the paradoxical progress of civilization and the advance of culture. These achievements are now endangered by nuclear, biological, and ecological crises. There has been a decisive change of the human condition. The global environment, which once seemed an unbounded resource, is faced with depletion, even extinction. The beliefs and behaviors that served in the struggle for survival and dominance have become rigid, resistant to criticism and dysfunctional for survival. Religion sows divisiveness, not only 554</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 555 among creeds and ethnicities, but between scientific knowledge and reli- gious faith. Because religion sets faith above knowledge, it evades the real- ity that investigation brings into focus and provides ideological cover for a politics of denial, for the intrusion of . . . transcendental hypotheses disrupts the accumulation of scien- tific knowledge, opening easy escapes from problems that might otherwise be solved through empirical research. (49.) Despite this, despite the fact that scientific and technological advances have rendered divine intervention diminishingly credible, religion survives and thrives. Validation has shifted from rationalist arguments from design to fideist appeals to inner belief. All sorts of stratagems, such as strictures against reductionism, serve to circumvent critique. That, in broad strokes, is Saxton's argument. Along the way, he exam- ines the dilemma posed by the problem of evil as dramatized and analyzed in scriptures, literature and philosophical and theological texts. Saxton ranges from the Book of Job through the writings of Augustine, Milton, Dante to Leibniz, Kant and Schleiermacher. He brings into play the social scien- tific study of religion as represented by Tylor, Durkheim and Weber as well as the reaction to secularism in Parsons, the Templeton Foundation and postmodernist theology. The book is learned and its arguments are plausible. I find myself much in agreement with it in its broad outlines. It deserves to be widely read and appreciated. Saxton's approach is better grounded in philosophical and historical argument than such high-profile books making a case against re- ligion as The God Delusion by Richard Dawkins and God Is Not Great by Chris- topher Hitchens. However, there are problems that make reading this book a less satis- factory experience than it might be. It is written in a highly abstract mode and does not capture the dynamic of the process by which religion came into the world, took hold and became enmeshed with all else that is human. The intellectual history underlying the argument is astute in its way, but somehow thinned out and inadequately contextualized. It is often written as an internalist history of ideas and texts rather than as a materialist his- tory in which the history of ideas is organically connected to the history of everything else. This is particularly surprising in that Saxton is a professor emeritus of history as well as a historical novelist. The book is put forward as a materialist history of religion, but it lacks, for example, an adequate ex- planation of the revival of religion and the retreat from secularism and en- lightenment values. This is rooted in the tendency to analyze texts without grounding them in socio-historical forces in a satisfactory way.</page><page sequence="3">556 SCIENCE Ã f SOCIETY Another problem is that some of Saxton's arguments seem not so much wrong as a few degrees off. Most crucially, his thesis that the origin of reli- gion lies in the fear of death does not give sufficient scope to the drive to explain the world. Throughout the book, the question of truth is somewhat marginalized. The intellectual quest to come to terms with the origin of the universe, to weigh the arguments for and against the existence of God or gods, is there, but does not come sharply into focus. There is also Saxton's critique of what he calls Marxism's "failed cri- tique of religion," which I do not find adequately informed or argued. His critique is based on claims that Marxism gives no clear definition of religion and no account of its historical origins, that its interpretation of history is deductive not inductive, that its dialectic of nature is idealist and teleologi- cal, that it ties religion too closely to ideology, that it has evaded the prob- lem of religion to win support. I do not accept that a study of Marxism as an intellectual tradition and a political movement supports any of these claims, although there is some truth in the contention that the movement has some- times evaded the question of religion to maximize support. The evidence that Saxton brings to bear on this is very thin and sketchy. It is largely based on the explicit writings of Marx and Engels on religion. It does not consider fully their writings on materialism in philosophy and his- tory. Moreover, Saxton ignores the work of subsequent generations of Marx- ists in his unsupported claims about Marxism and its analysis of religion. Of the many works by Marxists deserving of attention before leaping to gener- alizations about Marxism on the question of religion, I would cite Lucien Goldmann's The Hidden God and the study of religion in Christopher Caud- well's Studies and Further Studies in a Dying Culture. While this book is well worth reading on the question of religion, it is far from a definitive treatment.
