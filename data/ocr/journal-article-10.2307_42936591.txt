New Delhi : Archaeological Survey of India Rs. 250/-. Reviewed by H. D. Sankalia This publication is unique in several ways, and most welcome help for the decipherment of the Indus Script and thus tell us something definite about the authors of the Indus Civilization. It is now nearly 56 years that this most extensive of the four ancient civilizations was discovered. Though equally literate like the other three, still it is regarded as " illiterate because we cannot read their writing, most artistically engraved on hundreds of steatite tablets, a few on copper, and still smaller number scratched or painted on potsherds etc. Thus all this material is considerable and except the one fiom Harappa, Mohenjodaro and Chanhudaro, the rest not yet fully published. Every new discovery adds a couple of seals, and other material to the existing stock. The first step was to collect all this material, from all over India, and some lying in foreign museums, and codify it. This necessitated not only whole- time attention to this subject, and much more - willingness of all the museums, including that of the Archaeological Survey to allow this un- published material to be used. Fortunately Shri Mahadevan got a Nehru Fellowship, and the Survey for the first time allowed a scholar outside the Department access to this unpublished treasure. More important than this physical and material help, the entire work of codification could be done by a scholar trained in the modern Computer Science. Thus an ordinary archaeologist from the Department or outside would not have helped. Even Shri Mahadevan could achieve all this he has done because he found competent scholars at the TIFR, Bombay and then an intelligent and adventurous press like the Tatas. The result of this unique combination has been first rate. It would do credit to Indian scholarship and knowhow. And even a person like the late Sir Mortimer Wheeler ( who was a stickler in the matter of publication ) would have been certainly delighted to see this volume on the Indus Script, for which all the parties -Shri Mahadevan and his colleagues - My thili Rangarao and T. Rajeswari, and the two Press experts N. Soundararajan and</page><page sequence="2">194 H. D. SANK ALIA Amarnath Sharma - and the Archaeological Survey of India deserve our congratulations. The book presents in one volume a corpus of texts in the Indus Script together with a concordance to the texts and a set of tables providing the basic statistics relating to the script. Thus it provides a sourcebook material for further research. Mahadevan has personally examined material in the museums in India, London, and Paris, Thus over a thousand objects were inspected of which several unpublished are included in this volume. Texts compiled from original sources only. Every text included in the volume is taken from an original source, that is, either the object itself is copied by the author from a museum, or its mechanical reproduction by means of a plaster cast or a a photograph of the original or its impression. Thus 19 Harappan sites in Indo.-Pakistan and 5 west Asian sites are represented in the present collection. These have given a total of 2906 inscribed objects, of which the bulk-1540, and 985 are from Mohenjodaro and Harappa, 165 from Lothal and 99 from Kalibangan. Kish, Susa, Telloh and Ur have given respectively 2, 1,2, and 6. Inscribed objects Contrary to general impression, inscriptions in the Indus Script occur on several types of objects. Of these the most common are so called ' seals ' with texts deeply engraved on them is intaglio in the reversed direction. Then there are sealings which are positive impressions made by seals or special moulds on impressionable material like clay, faience or metal. Lastly, there are a few inscribed objects which carry thinly incised inscriptions meant for direct reading. These include miniature stone, terracotta or faience tablets, pottery, copper tablets, bronze implements, ivory or bone rods. This small but varied miscellaneous group of objects, - as well as the number of sides, sometimes six on cube sealings, and also the fact that inscriptions were incised even on edges, - all these do indicate that the seals were not used for commercial or religious purposes only, giving the name of the owner or deity. Even in flat, square or rectangular seals there are often no " bosses ", and the engraving is on both sides. The vast majority of the seals/sealings carry a conventional motif, *an animal, generally facing right. In three rare cases, there is an anthropomorphic figure seated on a pedestal. The inscriptions are generally placed in the upper register above the animal and the lines run with a few exceptions from the head of the animal towards its tail over the back. By far the most frequent filled symbol, on the seals, is the so-called " unicorn " with 1159 occurrences.</page><page sequence="3">REVIEW 195 The total number of texts in the corpus is 2906. The total number of lines of texts is 3573. The majority of texts are of single lines only. Though the direction of writing has been amply proved to be from right to left, still Mahadevan thought it was not conclusive. So he verified the direction of writing by a comparative study of the entire known material. This was made possible by the computerisation of texts and the background data. How the problem was tackled has been dicussed in detail (pp. 11-12). Orientation of asymmetric signs It was found that the asymmetric signs ( with respect to the vertical axis) occur oriented in either direction. By mere counting it can be ascertained that for each asymmetric sign ( occuring three or more times ), there is a preponderant orientation. This is defined on a statistical basis as the ' normal ' orientation of the sign and the opposite as the * reversed ' orientation. It can also be established that ( subject to a few exceptions, all asymmetric signs in a given line of text have the same orientation, either all normal or all reversed. This indicates that the lines were written in either direction and that the orientation of the asymmetric signs changed with the direction of the writing of the lines. The sign list records 417 signs, in the Indus Script. But this list has to be regarded on provisional. It is arranged according to the Morphological classification. The figure illustrates the arrangement of the concordance. Printing The printing of such a complex nature was most complicated. Earlier attempt by a smaller computer had to given up. Ultimately, a more versatile computer DEC 1077, available at the TIFR, Bombay in 1975 was used by NCSDCT ( National Centre for Software Development Computer Techni- ques ). And then the Tata Press prepared a special film font for the Indus Script from which the Texts, concordance and Tables have been printed. This itself is a great asset, because no font was available for printing in the Indus Script characters. Mahadevan has said plainly that the question of deciphering the script is beyond the scope of the present work. And so he had not referred to any previous decipherments. However, we can safely say that with this concord- ance is his hand any scholar, either " intuitively " or by a methodical study of other ancient scripts, as did the late Rev. Father Heras, some 40 years ago try to unlock the key to the secret of this script. Only whoever makes</page><page sequence="4">196 H. D.

In fact Father Heras's attempt had this in abundant degree. He would write blind fold all the letters ( figures ) then known and give their interpretation with the dictionary he had prepared. But the linguists pooh-poohed his attempt, because he had tried to prepare the key with the help of the modern Dravidian ! Now, curiously after 35 years, the Finns have once again gone back to the Dravidian, but without much success. Whereas Dr. Walter A. Fairservis. Jr. has given a fairly consistent interpretation, without the help of the computer, which he thinks is a hindrance, on the Dravidian basis. This ( Excavations at Allahclino Graffiti - A model in the Decipherment of the Harappan Script) I would review separately. So the field is still open for scholars in India and abroad.</page></plain_text>
