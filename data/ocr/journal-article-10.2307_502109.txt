<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shrines in Sepulchres? A Re-examination of Three Middle to Late Minoan Tombs* CHARLOTTE R. LONG PLATE 20 The three tombs with which this paper is pri- marily concerned are the tholos tomb at Apesokari in the Messara, the Temple Tomb at Knossos, and Tomb 5 at Ayia Triadha. These tombs have sev- eral features in common which do not occur in ordinary Middle Minoan tombs: the multiplicity of rooms in addition to the sepulchral chamber, the presence of pillar rooms, and the inclusion of a room which appears to be a shrine. Two of the three are built entirely above ground; the third was constructed in a huge cut made in the hill slope, possibly because in this way it could be oriented East-West. Two of the three are situated near palaces and no doubt served as dynastic sepulchres while the third lay near a settlement but not, so far as is yet known, near any residence of imposing size. The tomb at Apesokari1 (pl. 20) is built on a terrace near a Middle Minoan settlement. From the pottery found in it, Schoergendorfer concluded that the tomb was built at the beginning of Middle Minoan I and continued in use during Middle Minoan I and II. The building is oriented as nearly East-West as the terrain permitted and its entrance lies at the east end. In front of the tomb is an open area which has, on its north side, a rectangular platform o.8o by 0.9go m. in size and only 0.20-0.25 m. high. Schoergendorfer identified the latter as an altar because of the quantity of fragments of stone and pottery vessels found near it,2 but its height is more suitable for an altar base. The tomb proper, which is built entirely above ground, consists of a circular burial chamber or tholos and a rectangular building in front of the tholos, which served as an elaborate entrance system for the tholos. A large pillar room occupies the north-central part of the building while the remaining space to the east, south, and west is divided into narrow rooms. An alcove to the east of the pillar room and immedi- ately to the right of the entrance contained a thin, six-sided slab of stone laid on the floor at its north end, and an anthropomorphic concretion." Originally the concretion must have stood on the slab, and it may be taken to be the symbol of a deity. Conse- quently the alcove in which it was found appears to be a shrine. At the same time, burials were found in the tholos and in the rooms to the west and south of the pillar room, though not in the pillar room nor the alcove, and the building must there- fore be considered as a sepulchre. In its use as a communal sepulchre, in its con- struction, and in its plan, the tomb at Apesokari is a direct descendant of the Early Minoan tholoi of the Messara.' Both the tomb at Apesokari and the tholoi are built above ground. Both have round sepulchral chambers. The rectangular building in front of the sepulchral chamber at Apesokari is an elaboration of the anteroom found in front of some of the Early Minoan tholoi,5 and the open area with the altar in front corresponds to the paved courts sometimes found near Early Minoan tombs' though it did not necessarily fulfill the same function. The tomb at Apesokari, however, shows further archi- tectural development in the elaboration of the entrance system and the inclusion of a pillar room. The most important difference between the tomb and the earlier tholoi is the presence of a shrine within the building. The altar outside the tomb may have served this shrine, although it may also have been used for funeral rites.

LONG [AlA 63 altar are situated in front of the sepulchral part of the building so that persons could visit the shrine or perform ceremonies at the altar without entering the burial chambers, but the pillar room and the rooms containing burials could be reached only from the shrine. Thus while the two functions of the building are clearly separated, they cannot be wholly unrelated: presumably the deity symbolized by the concretion was conceived to be a protector of the dead left inside. The concretion gives no indication of the sex of this deity, nor are there any offerings which might illuminate the extra- sepulchral functions of the deity. Near the altar were found quantities of broken vessels but no bones; hence it may be assumed that the offerings made consisted principally of liquids, fruit, grain or the like rather than slaughtered animals. In date and in architecture the tomb at Apeso- kari is intermediate between the Early Minoan tholoi and the tombs at Knossos and Ayia Triadha next to be considered (pl. 20). The pottery found in excavating the Temple Tomb suggests that it was built during the Middle Minoan III B period.7 At the end of the Late Minoan I A period, part of it collapsed, but the building was repaired immedi- ately.8 Evans dated the final interment to the close of Late Minoan II and the latest of the votive vases found within the tomb to Late Minoan III A.' Except for the sepulchral chamber, which is cut into the living rock at the back of the tomb, the entire building is constructed in a huge cut made in the slope of the hill beside the road leading from Knossos to the south of Crete. Its east wall was built approximately at ground level. The main entrance to the tomb is situated on the north slope, well above the level of the ground floor of the tomb and only three steps below that of the upper storey. In addition to the labor involved in making the cut for the tomb, the building shows other evidence of lavish construction, the use of large, hewn lime- stone blocks in the visible wall faces, of slabs of gypsum to line the sepulchral chamber as well as of gypsum door-jambs, etc. That its furnishings were once equally rich is suggested by a cache of gold and beads found near the tomb and probably loot from it.1o The building consists of two storeys. At the east end of the lower storey is an enclosed court with a portico. The entrance to the tomb proper is situ- ated on the west side of the court. From this a hall leads past an inner stairway connecting the two storeys to the pillar crypt, a large room with two pillars. To the west of the pillar crypt is the sepul- chral chamber which is hewn out of the rock. The roof over the entrance and inner hall of the tomb was paved with slabs of green schist and was evidently used as a terrace. To the west, over the pillar crypt, was built an enclosed room with the same dimensions and nearly the same plan as the crypt below. The stucco on its walls was painted red and its door-frame at the northeast corner and a column base found within it were of gypsum. Of its furnishings nothing was recovered except part of a limestone pair of horns of consecration which may have stood either within the room or upon its roof. No traces of a bench nor of any other con- struction were noted within it. On the analogy of a "tomb of Minos" in Sicily described by Diodorus Siculus, Evans identified this upper room as a shrine of the goddess.' When the pillar crypt was excavated, the spaces between its pillars and between the west pillar and the west and south walls were filled with rubble walls composed of broken blocks and building debris. The areas enclosed by these walls were filled with a mixture of rubble, human bones and sherds of Late Minoan I A pottery. In all, the bones be- longed to twenty or more individuals, but except for one or two instances in which parts of the same skeleton were laid out in some order, the bones were mixed indiscriminately with the rest of the debris and were much decayed.12 Clearly the lower storey of the building was used as a sepulchre both before and after its partial col- lapse at the end of Late Minoan I A. The bones found in the pillar crypt belong to a series of burials of which the latest must have been made shortly before the collapse since at the time of the restora- tion one or two of the skeletons were sufficiently intact to be moved in order, whereas the rest had evidently disintegrated and were simply swept up with the rest of the debris. Had they been the re- mains of people killed in the fall of the building as Evans suggested,'3 more of the skeletons should T Evans, Sir Arthur, The Palace of Minos at Knossos, IV, (London 1935) 962-78, 986-1o08; on the date of construction, 975-76; henceforward abbreviated as PojM. 8 PoJM IV, 987-92. 9 PoIM IV, 1oo2-II, 1015-i7. 10 PojM IV, 963-64, pl. 34. 11 Diodorus Siculus 4.79.3; PofM IV, 965. 12 PofM IV, 988-90. 18 PofM IV, 990.</page><page sequence="3">1959] SHRINES IN SEPULCHRES? 61 have been found in order. Some of the looting represented by the cache near the tomb may have been done in clearing the tomb at this time or the earlier burials may have been stripped of every- thing valuable in preparing the tomb for subsequent interments. In any case, it seems very likely from the magnificence of the structure that these bones belonged to the rulers of Knossos during the Late Minoan I A period. It is the room above the pillar crypt which is of greatest interest, though the absence of finds in it leaves its use open to various interpretations. This room could be approached quite apart from the lower storey via the roof terrace and the steps up from the north entrance. Unless the portico west of the court was carried up two storeys, this room must have been visible from outside, and the frag- mentary horns of consecration found near it sug- gest that it had an imposing faqade with horns of consecration on its roof. At the same time, the upper room is connected with the sepulchral cham- bers by an interior stairway, and its position directly above the pillar crypt may have been significant. The exposure of the upper room in contrast to the concealing of the burial chambers below argues against its having been used in the same way as the lower storey. It is exceedingly difficult, however, to find any use for which the room is suited: it is too near the rear of the building to have been an efficient guardroom. It is at once too imposing and too wanting in domestic conveniences to have served as the living quarters of a tomb attendant. Evans' own theory that the room was a shrine of the goddess is the most satisfactory explanation of it. The separate entrance would permit worshippers to visit the shrine, if such it was, without entering the tomb, while the location of the shrine directly above the sepulchral chambers would enable the deity thus honored to extend his (her) benevolent protection to the bones laid out in the rooms below. A second possibility is that the room was used for rites to the dead below, but for the later period, at least, it may be assumed from the finding of kylixes and other vessels at the entrance to the sepulchral chamber and at the north entrance to the tomb that libations were made to the dead at these points and not in the upper room. If the upper room of the Temple Tomb is indeed a shrine, it has certain things in common with the shrine at Apesokari: both are distinct from the sepulchral part of the building, although in both there is ready communication between the shrine and the sepulchre. Both shrines lie to the west of an open area, the roof terrace at Knossos and the altar court at Apesokari. In both the entrance is placed so that the interior of the shrine is largely con- cealed from the gaze of people outside it. Like the tholos at Apesokari, Tomb 5 at Ayia Triadha is built entirely above ground on a terrace14 (pl. 20). Too little of it is preserved for its orienta- tion to be certain, but its entrance was on either the east side like the entrances of the other tombs at this site, or possibly on the north. The date of the construction of Tomb 5 and its original purpose are uncertain because nothing was found directly on its floor. In one of the rooms, about 0.30 m. above the floor, was found a vase in the form of a bird which may be dated to the Mid- dle Minoan I period,"5 and hence the building may have been erected as early as the beginning of the Middle Minoan period. The bulk of the finds, how- ever, belong to Late Minoan I-III, and it is with the appearance and use of the building in the Late Minoan period that we are concerned. When the building was excavated, the washing away of the slope above and below the terrace on which it stood had destroyed all but the south wall of the building together with the ends of five cross- walls and parts of two pillars. The south wall still rose to a height of 1.75 m. and the better preserved of the two pillars to a height of I.29 m., a height approximately ten centimeters above the top of the Minoan fill in the room. Of the other pillar, only the lowest block was still in place, but the excava- tion report does not reveal whether the higher blocks were removed before or after the Late Mi- noan occupation. Possibly, therefore, the building was already in ruin when it was used as a sepulchre in the Late Minoan period, but there is no positive evidence that it was. On the contrary, the richness of the Late Minoan stratum suggests that the bones found in it did not belong to burials carelessly made by the wall of an abandoned house, but rather to persons of some importance who would be laid out in a proper tomb. Of the four extant rooms lying next to the south wall, the easternmost may have been a court, for it has a width East-West of 4.20 m. without any sign 14 MonAnt 14 (1904-05) cols. 677-756. -' MonAnt 14 (1904-05) cols. 753-54, fig. 46.

Nothing was found in it. Next to it are two narrower rooms, each approximately I.50 m. in width. The juxta- position of two narrow rooms of the same width naturally suggests a stairway, and this in turn pre- supposes a second storey.? In support of this identi- fication it may be noted that the west narrow room was evidently filled in when the building was in use, for it contained no finds whatsoever, and one of its walls seemed to have no face. In the east nar- row room at a height of 0.30 to 0.50 m. above the floor were found the bird vase mentioned above, a gold-plated earring(?), a bronze mirror of Late Minoan III date, and a worn stone bowl, possibly, of Early Minoan manufacture. At a higher level, 1.15 m. or more above the floor, was another group of objects: a black steatite sphinx which must have come from Syria or Anatolia, part of a bronze figurine of a bull, two daggers and a hair-ring, also of bronze, part of a terracotta "goddess" with a cylindrical skirt, and the two pillars which sup- ported the figure of a swinging girl found in the pillar room to the west. The "goddess" and the pillars must have come from the same original location as the "goddesses" and the swinging girl found in the pillar room, and probably the other finds came from there too. The westernmost room is called the pillar room from the two pillars which supported its ceiling. It is the largest of the rooms, measuring 4.80 m. East-West. The half meter of fill directly above the floor of the pillar room was sterile. Above this were found parts of no less than five skeletons still in order by the south wall, in what was the most protected part of the room. Mixed with the bones or above them, o.5o-.00oo m. above the floor, lay various objects: a curious, heart- shaped gold amulet, two plain gold rings, pieces of a stone vase and of another in glass paste shaped like a conch shell, seven terracotta "goddesses" with cylindrical skirts, and fragments of a pedestal jar and an urn. One of the objects closest to the floor was the figure of the swinging girl mentioned above. I.oo-.2ao m. above the floor were found a scarab inscribed with the name of Queen Tiyi (wife of Amenophis III, 1402-1365 B.C.), two gold pend- ants in the form of lions and three in the form of calves' heads, a third gold ring, four bronze dag- gers, a mace head, an alabaster head of a man, another terracotta "goddess" with knobs on her skirt, and handleless cups. The two strata should be considered as a single mixed deposit, for there is no appreciable difference in character between them, and the figure of the girl from the bottom of this deposit belongs with the pillars from the top of the deposit in the east narrow room. The skeletons prove conclusively that the pillar room was used as a sepulchre, presumably in the Late Bronze Age since the objects in the same de- posit can be dated LM I-III. While the gold objects found were not directly associated with any of the burials, their discovery proves that the tomb be- longed to persons of wealth, no doubt the lords of the neighboring villa. The presence of a second princely tomb, the tomb of the painted sarcophagus, near this building provides a possible terminus ante quem for the use of Tomb 5 as a sepulchre, for the sarcophagus belongs to the Late Minoan III A period. If, then, the skeletons can be taken as proof that the pillar room in this building was used as a tomb in the Late Minoan period, the "goddesses" prove just as definitely that a shrine existed in this area, also in the Late Minoan period. Obviously the pillar room could not have been used simultane- ously as a sepulchre and as a shrine, and so the question arises: where was the shrine? Nilsson, in the first edition of The Minoan-Mycenaean Re- ligion,l' suggested that the shrine was part of the original house and that burials were made in the pillar room subsequent to the destruction of the house. This is impossible, for the bones lay near the bottom of the stratum containing the figurines and the figurines are among the latest objects in this stratum." Miss Banti believed that the figurines might have been washed down the slope from a house built higher up." It seems hardly likely, however, that so large a number of figurines (ten), representing very probably all the figurines the shrine contained, would be washed out of the build- ing in which they stood, down the slope, and into 16 An alternate possibility is that the two narrow rooms served as magazines, but this seems hardly likely since they contained no storage vessels either whole or fragmentary. There is, in fact, a remarkable absence of domestic pots and pans in the entire building. 17 Skrifter utgivna av kungl. humanistiska vetenskapssam- fundet i Lund, IX (Lund 1927) 259. 18 The type of figurine with a cylindrical skirt belongs to LM III.

The most reasonable location for the shrine is directly above the pillar room. The collapse of the ceiling of the pillar room (and the floor of the room above) would naturally cause most of the contents of the upper room to fall into the room below, though some might roll into a neighboring room. That an upper storey did exist may be inferred from the stairway to the east of the pillar room, though none of its structure has been preserved. At the Temple Tomb the leaving of votives continued after the latest interment, and it is possible that here too the shrine continued in use after the latest interments as the late type of "goddess" suggests. Architecturally, in so far as it can be recon- structed, Tomb 5 at Ayia Triadha has much in common with the Temple Tomb: a possible court at the east end; beside it a stairway leading to the upper storey; to the west a pillar room used as a sepulchre with a shrine in the room above. Whether the building always had this plan or whether the remains of an earlier building were adapted in the Late Bronze Age to fit this plan is impossible to say from what is extant. The furnishings of the shrine found at Ayia Triadha illuminate the nature of the cult. There is no evidence whatsoever that the shrine was dedi- cated to the souls of the dead or that the rulers were deified and worshipped in the shrine above their tomb. In all, ten terracotta figurines were recovered, eight of them representing women or goddesses wearing cylindrical skirts, one of a woman or goddess in a knobbed skirt, and one of a girl in Minoan costume swinging. None of the figurines is distinguished from the others by size or excellence; hence they are probably all votive offerings rather than cult images. It may be as- sumed, however, that the shrine was dedicated to a goddess since they are all female. The terracottas look no different from those found in Late Minoan III domestic shrines, and this has led to the con- clusion that they belong to a domestic shrine rather than a mortuary one."' The opposite conclusion should be drawn, that the goddess or goddesses to whom they were dedicated was equally at home in the palace of the king and in his tomb.21 The swinging girl may reflect some special aspect of the goddess to whom the shrine belonged or it may be merely a toy. More valuable offerings made to the goddess are the bronze bull, the alabaster head,22 and the steatite sphinx.23 The sphinx was possibly im- ported, perhaps from Syria or Anatolia, and may have been presented to the goddess by one of the rulers of Ayia Triadha. A socket in its back may once have held the figure of a deity like the ex- quisite crystal statuette found at Tarsus by Miss Hetty Goldman,24 for Hittite deities are often shown on the backs of animals, though I know of no instance in which the support is a sphinx. If the sphinx did hold the figure of a god or goddess, it would be a most suitable as well as costly offering for the shrine. Virtually no ritual vessels were found in the building though these may have lain in the de- stroyed north portion. The cups could have been used for libations either to the goddess or to the dead. The vase in the form of a conch-shell may likewise be assigned to either the shrine or the sepulchre since conch or triton shells and imita- tions of them have been found in both types of building.25 The nature of the rites is therefore uncertain. Possibly, as at Apesokari, the worship of the goddess was conducted in the open air outside the tomb, and the cups found are merely the re- mains of libations to the dead such as were made at the Temple Tomb. Since each of these tombs illustrates different aspects of the association of shrines with sepulchres, a composite picture can be drawn of the phenome- non from the three. At Apesokari, the concretion found in the shrine may be an actual cult image. It should not be taken to signify a chthonic deity any more than the figurines at Ayia Triadha since concretions were also found in a Late Minoan III domestic shrine in the Little Palace at Knossos.26 The discovery of an altar base and fragments of vessels in front of the tomb at Apesokari indicates 20 Nilsson's and Banti's hypotheses regarding the location of the shrine are based on this assumption. 21 Since all the figurines lay in the southernmost part of the room, it is tempting to restore a bench for them by the south wall of the shrine above, like the benches in domestic shrines. However it should be remembered that we know nothing of what may have lain in the destroyed portion of the room and hence have no comparative data with which to justify this restoration. 22In the original publication the head is identified as a pommel (MonAnt 14 [1904-05] cols. 727-28, fig. 25). 23 MonAnt 14 (1904-05) cols. 749-53. 24Archaeologica orientalia . . .

LONG [AlA 63 that the offerings were made outside the building rather than in the shrine. The structure of the shrine is best preserved at Knossos: it was a single cella, probably containing two columns, with its entrance on the east side. Horns of consecration probably stood on the roof just as in contemporary representations of shrines. At Ayia Triadha, finally, the similarity of the figurines in the tomb to those found in domestic shrines indicates that the god- dess worshipped was similar to and perhaps identi- cal with the goddess or goddesses honored in domestic cults. In all three tombs the proximity of the shrine to the sepulchral part of the building suggests that the deity thus honored, though es- sentially supernal, was expected to protect the re- mains of the dead. There are three additional pieces of evidence re- garding the close association of a divine cult with burials in the second millennium: first, Diodorus Siculus states27 that a structure in Sicily, believed to be the tomb of Minos of Crete, had a temple of Aphrodite built above the sepulchre. A Mycenaean jar has been found in the neighboring town of Akragas (Girgenti),28 and hence people from the Aegean may have reached this part of Sicily, though there is more evidence for their presence in the neighborhood of Syracuse.29 The form of the tomb agrees with the remains of the Temple Tomb at Knossos, as Evans recognized," and also with those of Tomb 5 at Ayia Triadha. Diodorus further states that sacrifices were made to Aphrodite, not to Minos, and seems to be rather puzzled by the asso- ciation of Aphrodite with the tomb. Aphrodite, who presumably usurped the cult of a Minoan goddess, was not a deity primarily associated with death or the after life. Yet almost the same situa- tion existed in Tomb 5 at Ayia Triadha: the shrine there was dedicated to a goddess, not to the de- ceased, and the goddess thus honored was appar- ently the same deity worshipped in domestic shrines, i.e., a supernal rather than an infernal goddess. Secondly, a tablet found at Boghazkay, relating to royal burial customs in the Hittite Empire, states that sacrifices were made both to the sun goddess and to the soul of the deceased." Again a supernal deity is involved in funerary practices. If this was customary in Anatolia, a similar practice may have existed in nearby Crete. Finally, the well-known sarcophagus from Ayia Triadha has, on opposite sides, representations of offerings being brought to the soul(?) of the de- ceased and sacrifices being made before a shrine.32 Here as at Apesokari, the altar is set in the open air in front of the shrine, but in addition to the offering of fruits or cakes and liquids, for which there was evidence at Apesokari, a bull and two goats are being sacrificed. It is worthy of notice that a scene of this type was considered an appropriate subject for a coffin quite apart from the fact that it balances the scene of offerings to the dead. One end of the sarcophagus shows two goddesses riding in a chariot drawn by griffins. If these are the occupants of the shrine on the long side, once more the deity to whom the sacrifices are made is a goddess. It would be felicitous indeed if the shrine of the sarcophagus could be shown to represent the shrine in Tomb 5 at Ayia Triadha, which was actually in use at the time the sarcophagus was painted, but there is no reason to suppose it is. Horns of consecration such as crown this shrine were found near the shrine of the Temple Tomb at Knossos, but they occur on other shrines and palaces as well, and there is cer- tainly no evidence for the presence of an olive tree in or near Tomb 5 at Ayia Triadha or the Temple Tomb. It should be mentioned in passing that on the opposite side of the sarcophagus where the rites for the dead are depicted, people are mix- ing wine, perhaps for libations to the dead such as were made in the Temple Tomb at Knossos. In each of these three instances it will be seen that the burial is royal or princely, for surely the Ayia Triadha sacrophagus was designed for no ordinary citizen. In two instances sacrifices were made to a deity at the time of the funeral; in the third a cult was established above the tomb. While the deities involved are not necessarily the same, the association of a deity with a royal burial seems certain. Of the three tombs containing shrines, the tholos 27 Diodorus Siculus 4.79.3-4. 28Ausonia I (I906) 10, fig. 3.

It may represent an early stage of the association of the divine cult with the sepulchre just as archi- tecturally it represents an intermediate stage be- tween the Early Minoan tholoi and the tombs at Knossos and Ayia Triadha. It is important prin- cipally as proof that this peculiar association was present in Crete centuries before it was embodied in the Temple Tomb and in Tomb 5 and was an integral part of Minoan civilization. If this associa- tion did exist, other double tombs must have been built, near the palaces at Phaistos and Mallia if nowhere else,33 and should eventually be found un- less their exposed nature has led to their total de- struction. The Temple Tomb and Tomb 5 at Ayia Triadha both stand near the residences of Minoan rulers and were used as royal tombs. In life these rulers may have been considered the favorites of certain gods or goddesses just as the Homeric heroes had their patron deities. They were not gods on earth like the Egyptian pharaohs nor were they deified in death, but the goddess who had favored them in life and lived in their palaces took up her abode above their tombs.3" CLINTON, NEW YORK 33At Chrysolakkos near the Palace of Mallia, there are, in fact, the remains of a building used as a tomb, which had in a room beside its east wall, a hollow column or altar base for libations and a number of handleless cups embedded in its floor. (Demargne, Pierre, btudes Critoises 7 [Paris 1945] 26- 38, especially 35-38.) Demargne concluded that the funerary cult practised here was that of the goddess worshipped in the palace. The interior of the tomb had been thoroughly plundered, but its name suggests that it was a rich tomb, suitable for the rulers of Mallia. While the tomb was constructed above ground and has a court outside and a place for offerings, it does not have either the shrine or the pillar room found in the tombs at Apesokari, Knossos and Ayia Triadha. The form of the building is different, therefore, although the cult may have been the same. 34 Since this was written, I have had access to Nicholas Pla- ton's article, "Ta MLVOLKa OiKLtaK '(epa," KpIILK&amp; XpoPLKa 8 (I954) 428-83. Platon includes all three tombs in his dis- cussion of domestic shrines and pillar crypts. He considers Tomb 5 at Ayia Triadha a house with a shrine re-used as a tomb (455-56), and he dates the terracotta figurines MM III B-LM I A. His conclusions in regard to the shrines of the Temple Tomb and the tholos at Apesokari (446-47, 457, 483) are similar to mine, but he believes in addition that the pillar rooms were used for the cult of the dead.</page><page sequence="8">PLATE 20 LONG Apesokari: tholos tomb F0 -~ SI IF 91 Knossos: temple tomb Ayia Triadha: tomb 5 Orientation: north is at the bottom of the plate</page></plain_text>
