<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ethnographic Museums and Cultural Commodification Indigenous Organizations, NGOs, and Culture as a Resource in Amazonian Ecuador by Patrick C. Wilson I think that this is the great pain that the Indians of the Huacamayos have, and it is for this that they hate us. And I am tired of it.... Because we have given them their symbols-we the mestizos, the whites, the Mishus [Quichua for "mes- tizo"], the colonizers. We have built them a museum.... We have given them the element so that they can have culture, man, culture! Do you understand? And for this, they hate us more. Jesus Gonzdlez It is difficult to find a more important location of cultural representation than ethnographic museums, where cultural forms are consciously selected, appropriated, and displayed with the goal of conveying particular images of the ethnic or cultural groups in question. Museums reveal as much about the cultural assumptions of the individuals creating them as they do about any "objective reality" of the people being represented. They may therefore come to reflect or reveal aspects of local, regional, national, or even global power structures, because "decisions about how cultures are presented reflect deeper judgments of power and authority" (Lavine and Karp, 1991: 2). In recent years, the groups represented in museum contexts have increasingly come to be active participants in processes of representation, demanding involvement in selecting how and which artifacts should be publicly dis- played and what meanings should be attached to them. Therefore, many groups contest the ways in which they are represented (Clifford, 1997: 173- Patrick C. Wilson is a senior lecturer at the University of Akron.

Museums may thus serve as locations of cultural intensification, con- texts in which cultural representation is discussed and debated. In the Upper Napo of Ecuador's Amazon Basin, the building of an ethnographic museum became a site of contention over issues of cultural, political, and economic authority and autonomy. The two primary goals of the museum, as established by the nongovernmental organization (NGO) responsible for the project, were to strengthen local cultural pride and to gen- erate employment and income for local peoples, thereby providing a "sus- tainable" economic alternative to forest cutting. However, the construction and operation of the museum, called Mundos Amaz6nicos (Amazon Worlds), brought to the surface more widespread and thinly veiled tensions between local indigenous communities, a local and a regional indigenous organization, and a domestic NGO. In this article I will situate the case study of the ethnographic museum historically, within broader trends of sustain- able development projects in indigenous communities. I will then argue that what was contested was not so much the nature of the cultural representations contained within the museum as who had the cultural and political right to claim any economic benefits emerging from them. Furthermore, I will sug- gest that the museum exemplifies the politicized nature of sustainable devel- opment projects and the diverse and debilitating potential these projects have for indigenous communities and indigenous organizations. Finally, I will relate this case study to larger debates about the roles and potentials of indige- nous organizations and development NGOs in promoting the growth of "alternative economies" rooted in ecological and economic sustainability for local indigenous communities. MUNDOS AMAZONICOS Mundos Amazonicos is located on the outskirts of the small rain-forest city of Archidona, in the neighborhood of San Agustin, a diverse community of Quichua, mestizo, and Afro-Ecuadorian inhabitants. The museum rises above the surrounding landscape of one-story houses, its impressive circular thatched-roof structure reaching toward the sky. The top of the structure is constructed of translucent plastic that, lit from within, glows. Decorated with four petroglyph symbols copied from the numerous boulders found in the surrounding area, it illuminates the sky like an Amazonian version of the "bat signal." One of the petroglyph symbols, an anthropomorphic figure, is promi- nently displayed on the side facing the entrance to the museum grounds. This symbol has also, not coincidentally, been adopted as the emblem of Sinchi</page><page sequence="3">164 LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES Sacha, the Quito-based NGO that designed and implemented the museum project. The museum's centerpiece is a massive petroglyph boulder bearing numerous carvings that are thought to date to at least 2,000 years B.P.1 The museum itself is composed of two main buildings: a restaurant-gift-shop and the museum complex. Both are constructed with materials from the area, fea- turing durable chonta palm wood and thatched roofs. Materials were donated by several of the surrounding indigenous communities, and these same com- munities provided the labor for the museum's construction. The restaurant is oval and contains tables cut from the trunks of large trees and wooden chairs. On shelves lining one corer of the building are a variety of Quichua-made handicrafts, such as beaded necklaces, pottery, and woven baskets. The kitchen, although never fully functioning during my stay, was intended to serve a mix of local Quichua delicacies, sandwiches, soft drinks, and beer. The museum complex is the larger and taller of the buildings. The interior of this spacious building is divided into two parts: to the left of the entrance is a video viewing room, complete with television, VCR, Direct TV satellite television, and rows of seats. Sinchi Sacha's initial idea was to use this room to show ethnographic films during the day and movies (for a fee) at night. To the right of the entrance is the oval main room. Mounted on its walls are representations of each of the seven indigenous ethnic groups populating Ecuador's Amazon Basin.2 Each group is given its individual space, divided from the next by the large palm tree trunks that support the roof. The central component of each display is a plaque that gives basic information about the group, including its geographic location, population, language, and "general characteristics." In the open space in the middle of the room is a glass case containing archaeological remains, contemporary ceramic pieces, and carved wooden furniture. NGOs, INDIGENOUS ORGANIZATIONS, AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT Sinchi Sacha received funding for the project from the Canadian govern- ment through the Fondo Ecuatoriano Canadiense de Desarrollo (the Cana- dian Fund for Ecuadorian Development-FECD), which typically funds small-scale projects promoting urban and rural economic development.3 Sinchi Sacha, which means "powerful forest" in Quichua, was founded in 1991 and views itself as a nonprofit NGO with the goals of providing "sup- port for indigenous peoples of the continent in their development efforts" and participating in "the world-wide movement for the defense of the</page><page sequence="4">Wilson / CULTURE AS RESOURCE IN AMAZONIAN ECUADOR 165 environment" (Paymal and Sosa, 1993: 197). It is a small NGO with three members at its core: Jesus Gonzalez, executive director; Rebeca Santos, pres- ident; and Camilo Pinto, cultural coordinator.4 Gonzalez and Pinto worked most closely on the creation of the museum. Sinchi Sacha has combined its development work in indigenous commu- nities with an entrepreneurial spirit, often blurring the line between nonprofit organizations and for-profit businesses. One of its first activities, for exam- ple, was the publication of a coffee-table book highlighting the different eth- nic groups in Ecuador's Amazon, replete with impressive color photos and short essays by academics and indigenous intellectuals. More recently Sinchi Sacha has opened a shop called the Centro Cultural Tianguez that specializes in the sale of indigenous-made craft items and is, ironically, located in the basement of the colonial-era San Francisco Cathedral. Its strategic location aids in the store's prosperity, as the daily multitudes of international tourists visiting the cathedral find the store convenient for shopping. This also reflects Sinchi Sacha's basic development philosophy, that is, that viable cul- tural practices are those that successfully integrate with the market. Sinchi Sacha collaborated with one local and one regional indigenous organization for the construction of the museum. It worked directly with the Union Huacamayos, a local indigenous organization representing 11 Quichua communities at the base of the foothills of the Huacamayos Moun- tains. The Uni6n was established in 1995 as the Comite Intercomunitario de los Huacamayos, with seven original members. A conservation NGO, the Programa Regional de Bosques Nativos Andinos (Regional Program for Native Andean Forests-PROBONA), initiated and encouraged the idea of creating the Union as an organization with the mission of promoting eco- nomic alternatives to forest cutting in the highly biodiverse Huacamayos area. Jesus Gonzalez worked with PROBONA at the time and was actively involved in the Huacamayos project. PROBONA has inscribed its primary goal, which is "to consolidate the participation of the local population in the management, conservation, and sustainable use of the forest" in its activities in the Quichua communities of the Huacamayos. It has supported small-scale activities in the different communities through agreements for technical and financial support, among them the opening of walking paths to sites of poten- tial tourist interest such as waterfalls or large petroglyph boulders, the cre- ation of ethnobotanical gardens, and the planting of nurseries of native plants. In 1996 PROBONA suggested the formation of the officially sanctioned organization that became the Uni6n Huacamayos. The Uni6n is a member of the regional Federaci6n de Organizaciones Indigenas de Napo (Federation of Indigenous Organizations of Napo- FOIN), which represents more than 100 Quichua communities in Napo</page><page sequence="5">166 LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES Province. It has regularly elected officials and acts as an intermediary between the communities and local, provincial, and national governments, pursues land titles for member communities, and promotes community eco- nomic development. Formed in 1969, it was one of the earliest indigenous federations in Ecuador's Amazon, following the precedent of the Federation of Shuar Centers formed two years earlier. It played an active role in the cre- ation of both an indigenous Amazonian confederation in Ecuador, the Confederaci6n de Nacionalidades Indigenas de la Amazonia Ecuatoriana (Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon- CONFENIAE) in 1980 and a national indigenous organization, the Confederaci6n de Nacionalidades Indigenas del Ecuador (the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador-CONAIE), in 1986. CONAIE serves as the national indigenous umbrella organization and CONFENIAE as the regional organization in the Amazon (Ecuador Runacunapac Riccha- rimui [Quichua for "Ecuadorian Awakening Man"]-ECUARUNARI-is its counterpart in the highlands). CONFENIAE, in turn, has subregional member organizations (of which FOIN is one) representing the different eth- nic groups in the Amazon.5 CONAIE has emerged as a powerful voice within Ecuadorian politics, staging impressive national strikes such as the uprising of 1990 (see Lucero and Perreault in this issue). In 1997-1998 CONAIE and its political-social movement, Pachakutik, took advantage of the constitu- tional reform in Ecuador to win official recognition of key movement goals in the new constitution (see Van Cott in this issue), and in 2000 it spearheaded the movement that resulted in the toppling of Jamil Mahuad's government (see Lucero in this issue). FOIN emerged in the context of agrarian reform and the resultant increase in land pressure from colonists (MacDonald, 1992; Leon, 1986; Perreault in this issue), and while its initial objectives coalesced around issues of coloni- zation and land tenure they were frequently tied to related concerns of eco- nomic development.6 It sought and obtained credit and loans from develop- ment NGOs and banks for agricultural and cattle-ranching projects in member communities. By the mid-1980s it had blossomed into the most important indigenous organization in Napo Province, at least partly through a shift in organizational identity. Privileging sustainable community develop- ment and conservation as key objectives, it attracted the attention and support of sustainable-development and conservation NGOs interested in forging alliances with indigenous organizations and translated this into significant economic and political prosperity. Its membership also expanded during this period, reflecting its greater capacity to provide tangible benefits to its mem- ber communities. Often, it directly administered development projects in</page><page sequence="6">Wilson / CULTURE AS RESOURCE IN AMAZONIAN ECUADOR 167 member communities, and it maintained a full-time technical team to fulfill its increased responsibilities. Also in the 1980s FOIN benefited from a general tendency for develop- ment NGOs to pursue small-scale sustainable-development projects in indig- enous communities, often collaborating with local and regional indigenous organizations and making them the principal protagonists of these projects. The growing international environmental movement made Amazonian con- servation a top priority. Many conservation NGOs suggested that the indige- nous inhabitants, because of their extensive knowledge and comparatively sustainable use of forest resources, could help promote forest conservation and sustainable management. Indigenous organizations representing these peoples also apparently identified with the goals of the conservation move- ment (Schwartzman, 1991; Shiguango et al., 1993; MacDonald, 1992). Fur- thermore, these organizations possessed or could acquire the administrative capacities deemed necessary for project success. Environmental conserva- tion and indigenous empowerment became complementary activities, since empowering indigenous peoples and protecting their land rights would serve conservation efforts while stronger environmental regulations would benefit indigenous forest inhabitants (Hall, 1997; Hicks, 1990; Putsche, 1993). Through the 1980s the alliance between conservation and sustainable- development NGOs and indigenous peoples prospered, and NGOs played a central role in the strengthening and proliferation of indigenous organiza- tions in Amazonian Ecuador and elsewhere. They provided economic and technical support to indigenous organizations (Leon, 1986; Shiguango et al., 1993), sponsored conferences bringing indigenous peoples together to dis- cuss their "collective fate" (Schroder, 1991), and called international and national media attention to indigenous issues (Fisher, 1994; Ireland, 1991; Turner, 1992). NGOs' environmental concerns and indigenous social issues blurred, to the benefit of many indigenous groups, which were "able to re- frame their disadvantageous relationships with the nation-states that encom- pass them by redefining their projects in the global space of environmental- ism and human rights" (Kearey, 1995: 560). In Ecuador and elsewhere, indigenous organizations have adeptly used environmental rhetoric for polit- ical advantage in disputing land claims with and gaining important leverage on national governments (Sawyer, 1997; Fisher, 1994; see Roper in this issue). By the early 1990s, however, the romance between NGOs and indigenous organizations had begun to fade. At least three factors contributed to the emergence of conflict between them. First, the overwhelming majority of the sustainable-development projects funded and implemented in Ecuador's Amazon had negative outcomes, and few of these projects endured for long</page><page sequence="7">168 LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES after project funding ceased.7 Second, many indigenous organizations were not fully trained to be the financial administrators of development projects, and this led to chronic mismanagement of funds. Third, some NGOs began to question whether indigenous organizations were able to encourage extensive local-level support for and involvement in sustainable-development projects. This did not, for the most part, lead to a critical self-reflection on the work of NGOs themselves; instead, many of them began to place the blame for prob- lems with the projects on the indigenous organizations. NGOs' unrealistic expectations of indigenous organizations and commu- nities contributed to the cooling of relations between them. Lucero (in this issue) suggests that "community" has been employed as an organizing prin- ciple for thinking about indigenous peoples but used differently for diverse social, political, and economic aims. During the 1980s, many NGOs formu- lated sustainable-development projects unproblematically along "commu- nal" lines, suggesting that this reflected the reality of Amazonian indigenous communities. Environmental conservation, they argued, could best be pro- moted through the collective use and management of natural spaces by indig- enous people. Some development workers suggested a "natural" link between indigenous peoples and the environment (Stearman, 1994; Ramos, 1991). Indigenous leaders were often complicit in promulgating these stereo- types, as they recognized that strategic environmentalist self-representations would garer economic, technical, and political support from the interna- tional NGO community (Conklin, 1997). Therefore, the environmentalism that NGO representatives hoped to find in indigenous communities often became a self-fulfilling prophecy. Yet, these indigenous leaders and community members did not always live up to the environmental rhetoric they employed. Many indigenous peo- ple participate in nonsustainable activities such as cattle ranching and log- ging (Roper, 1999) that contradict not only their own rhetoric but also the NGO-held, Western-style environmental ethic. These contradictions have led some international NGOs to rethink their partnership with indigenous organizations and pursue other strategies for the implementation of sustain- able-development projects in local communities. In some cases NGOs have abandoned the very indigenous communities they championed in the 1980s and early 1990s (Conklin and Graham, 1995) while seeking new approaches to work with indigenous communities. One such approach has been to work with domestic NGOs in the design, implementation, and administration of development projects in indigenous communities. Sinchi Sacha is a product of this approach (Fisher, 1994; Carroll, 1992). Thomas Carroll (1992) argues that working with these intermediate NGOs, which he terms "grassroots support organizations" (GSOs), has several</page><page sequence="8">Wilson / CULTURE AS RESOURCE IN AMAZONIAN ECUADOR 169 advantages. They tend to be less politically motivated than membership orga- nizations, and the most successful of them are even capable of separating their personal political agendas from their role in the development process. Because they are held accountable by the donor organization (future funding is likely contingent upon successful management and administration of cur- rent funding), they are less prone to corruption and mismanagement. Further, they are thought by many to promote substantial local participation in pro- jects. This privileging of domestic NGOs has sparked their proliferation: it is estimated that more than 45 percent of the current NGOs in Ecuador were founded between 1990 and 1995 (Arcos and Palomenque, 1997) and that they have received an average of US$170 million annually in international support (El Comercio, August 4, 1998).8 Yet this reliance on intermediate NGOs assumes that, while not members of the community in which they are working, they still possess the social closeness deemed necessary for effective project implementation simply by being part of the same "national culture" (Fisher, 1997). As Fisher suggests, this is problematic, especially in ethnically diverse settings such as Ecuador; it is not necessarily the case that the NGO and the people receiving the project agree on the primary objectives of local development. Furthermore, many NGOs interact with their host states in complex ways. While not necessarily complicit in state agendas, NGOs' developmentalist programs often indi- rectly serve state objectives by facilitating the incorporation of "marginal" populations into market economies (Bebbington et al., 1993; Ferguson, 1994; Fisher, 1997). CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT One recent attempt to mediate the needs of local communities with greater market and state incorporation is the promotion of "culturally appropriate" models of sustainable development. The rationale is that linking local cul- tural practices to economic productivity will enhance the local participation in and viability of development projects (Mitchell, 1994; Neace, 1997). Some development specialists and anthropologists have argued that convert- ing local knowledge into economic profit has helped encourage local cultural revitalization (Healy, 1992), thereby linking economic and cultural empow- erment. Sinchi Sacha's work reflects the desire to root development projects in the presumed cultural traditions of local peoples. In addition to the ethnographic museum, Sinchi Sacha implemented a ceramics plant and an ecotourism lodge in two of the base communities of the Uni6n Huacamayos.</page><page sequence="9">170 LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES The ceramics plant was touted as an attempt to revive a lost ceramic tradition in Napo Quichua communities; Sinchi Sacha views ceramic production as a central component of Amazonian Quichua culture. The ecotourism project allowed community members to present traditional dance, folklore, medi- cine, and other local knowledge to tourists, thereby generating profit while "preserving" local traditions. Sinchi Sacha's Gonzalez and Pinto suggest that linking cultural practices with the market economy can create a more harmonious relationship between the market and Amazonian indigenous peoples. In their view, indigenous communities must change culturally to embrace community development as an economic model. As Pinto puts it: We are... testing a new approach. It is a new process in the last five years. This process of critique and self-critique is an initial debate that we have opened. We see that we may still be able to find that point of confluence of which I was speaking: of how to combine the criteria of community with the criteria of prof- itability, efficiency, and harmonious ties under equal conditions with the mar- ket. But this is a long process, because it is a cultural process, a process that requires cultural change. Gonzalez suggests that this type of cultural change is essential. He sees a cul- tural crisis in the indigenous communities of the Upper Napo that is reflected in what he sees as their lack of well-developed artistic traditions. He suggests that the production and sale of craft goods and a general revalorization of cul- tural traditions will provide the mechanisms for incorporating the communi- ties into the market while at the same time "rejuvenating" their cultures: I think that the reason the indigenous movement, especially in Napo where we work,... is in a social crisis ... is that the culture is entirely fractured. It is fin- ished. It doesn't exist as it used to. Ours is a progressive and growing process, and this process of cultural structuring, as Pinto says, of course has much to do with the relation of the population to the market. There is a symbiosis between the influence of the market and the growth of cultural structure.... Our position is to initiate certain processes so that the communities can have, shall we say, a dignified relationship with the markets, so that they can structure themselves- to see if we can culturally structure the community. We have said, for example, that the base of understanding for the Amazon is in its art. If a community ... does not have a structured artisanship, the process of [cultural] decay is greatly accelerated. Therefore, we have viewed artisanship as the base of our participation-art and artisanship. In these terms, culture is reduced to artistic production, and cultural revital- ization, therefore, revolves around a revalorization of material culture. As a result, the goals of the museum included providing the indigenous inhabit-</page><page sequence="10">Wilson / CULTURE AS RESOURCE IN AMAZONIAN ECUADOR 171 ants of the region with a mechanism for interacting with market economies on what Sinchi Sacha considered to be more equal terms by basing their inter- action on the display, representation, and sale of culturally meaningful items. THE CLASH OF NGOs AND INDIGENOUS POLITICS In some contexts, indigenous cultural practices have been transformed for market consumption while also empowering local peoples (Stephen, 1991). This has typically occurred in a context in which local groups have signifi- cant input into the design and implementation of the project. When this is not the case, NGOs often misinterpret local cultural practices and design projects that do not reflect local realities, and this, added to gaps in communication between NGOs and local peoples, results in further misunderstanding (Nygren, 1999). This was the case with Sinchi Sacha, the Union Huacamayos, and FOIN. Pinto suggested that there were key communicative and philosophical gaps between Sinchi Sacha and the indigenous organiza- tions, and he and Gonzalez recognized the potential for conflict. One of the most general misunderstandings was a disagreement about whether develop- ment was a political or an apolitical activity. FOIN and Uni6n Huacamayos leaders suggested that the history of development in the Amazon had con- firmed its inherently political nature, while Sinchi Sacha argued that politi- cizing development simply interfered with its success. FOIN and the Uni6n Huacamayos see Sinchi Sacha itself as indicative of the political nature of development. Because the trend in the past ten years has been for intermediary NGOs such as Sinchi Sacha to replace indigenous organizations such as FOIN and the Union Huacamayos as the primary actors in the development process, indigenous leaders are increasingly suspicious of them. Many feel that their autonomy in the development process has been usurped by these NGOs, and this has made NGOs easy targets when their projects run into difficulty. Indigenous leaders contest their exclusion from the development process by arguing that the benefits of these projects are not staying in indigenous communities but going to NGOs. As Artemio Patucue, president of the Uni6n Huacamayos, said, "Our money, which is obtained in the name of the Indians, is going for the benefit of others." The influx of inter- mediary NGOs such as Sinchi Sacha, which up to now has brought question- able benefit for local communities, is viewed by some indigenous leaders as the latest form of exploitation. Sinchi Sacha saw the politicized attitude of the Uni6n and FOIN as obstructive to the development process, and Gonzalez and Pinto acted in</page><page sequence="11">172 LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES ways that they hoped would defuse political tensions. They repeatedly told me that the main difficulty with the Uni6n Huacamayos and FOIN was their inability to separate the economic aspects of development from their larger political goals, which created conditions unfavorable for development initiatives. Gonzailez, who took credit for the idea of forming the Uni6n Huacamayos, considered it an apolitical organization devoted to community development. Patucue, as the first president of the Union, quickly moved it away from this stance. In his first briefing of FOIN as president he said that the purpose of administering projects of self-development in the indigenous communities was "[demonstrating] the capacity that we indigenous peoples have for the administration of our own resources and our own culture, and not permitting what is ours to be administered by people foreign to our [Quichua] culture, who always seek to take the traditional knowledge of our communities" (Informe de la Directiva de la Union Indigena para la Administracion, Uso, Aprovechamiento y Gestion Comunitaria del Area de los Huacamayos, agosto 1996-agosto 1997, FOIN archives). He went on to suggest the need to avoid the intervention of NGOs, which might threaten the autonomy of the indigenous communities: It is necessary that communal interests in reference to aspects of territory, natu- ral resources, education, health, environment, and others be defined by the leaders of the base communities and of the Federation in order to gain the respect of the communities so that we are the ones who administer the produc- tive projects of self-development. In this way we can prevent NGOs, compa- nies, or others from taking the cultural riches from our communities. The growing tension and mistrust between Sinchi Sacha and the Union caused Sinchi Sacha to become involved in local indigenous politics. This involvement had three stages. It first attempted to place leaders friendly toward Sinchi Sacha in positions of power. When this backfired, it attempted to undermine the capacity of the established leaders to retain their positions or to function effectively. Finally, it adopted the practice of ignoring local structures of power and authority. When the Comite Intercomunitario was formed in 1995, PROBONA named Mariano Huatatoca, a young and up-and-coming FOIN member, as the indigenous coordinator of the project. Gonzalez had been a friend of Huatatoca for a number of years, and this made for tranquil relations between the Comite and PROBONA. In the fall of 1996 FOIN held its Thirteenth Con- gress and elected new leadership. By this time Gonzalez was working with Sinchi Sacha, and Sinchi Sacha was in the early stages of constructing the</page><page sequence="12">Wilson / CULTURE AS RESOURCE IN AMAZONIAN ECUADOR 173 ethnographic museum. Rebeca Santos, as president of Sinchi Sacha, wrote a letter to FOIN on this occasion, backing Mariano Huatatoca as nominee for FOIN's presidency: As you know, Sinchi Sacha has been working for one and a half years with the Comit6 Intercomunitario de los Huacamayos on various training projects and technical assistance. We have learned that some of the communities are think- ing of Mariano Huatatoca as candidate for president of FOIN, and therefore we have considered it prudent to make you aware that we would support this motion, as we know Mariano Huatatoca, who has worked very diligently with PROBONA and Sinchi Sacha and has demonstrated organizational conscience and a high level of responsibility. Huatatoca ultimately won the election and assumed the presidency in Octo- ber 1996. It is unclear how much impact this letter of support had on his elec- tion, but it did serve to place a leader sympathetic to Sinchi Sacha in an important political office. Whether or not Sinchi Sacha had much influence in actually electing Huatatoca, it certainly played a crucial role in his subsequent removal from office. By January 1998 the relationship between Sinchi Sacha and the Union Huacamayos was rapidly deteriorating. At the same time, conflicts within FOIN had led to the calling of an extraordinary congress. Huatatoca was forced to resign, and one motivation for his dismissal was the suggestion that he was too close to Gonzalez and Sinchi Sacha. During the congress, Patucue accused Huatatoca of working in the interest of Sinchi Sacha rather than that of the communities of the Uni6n Huacamayos and argued that it was the responsibility of the president of the Federation to defend the communities against the injustices that Sinchi Sacha was committing. Pinto and Gonzalez were also active in trying to dissuade communities from voting for Patucue as president during the Union Huacamayos's con- gress in 1997. Patucue had assumed the presidency of the then-Comit6 Intercomunitario de los Huacamayos in 1996 when Huatatoca had vacated the post to become president of FOIN. In the ensuing year relations between the Uni6n and Sinchi Sacha had steadily cooled, and by the time of the elec- tion of new leaders of the Union in 1997 Sinchi Sacha felt that a change would be beneficial for more effective working relations between the two. Pinto suggested that Patucue was a strong leader but too politicized and that his unwillingness to work in nonconfrontational terms had debilitated the devel- opment process. He denied that Sinchi Sacha had campaigned against Patucue (a charge that Patucue and others had made) but did admit that when he and Gonzalez were asked whom they would vote for they had encouraged the communities to vote for other candidates.9</page><page sequence="13">174 LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES Community members and leaders of the Uni6n tell the story differently. Some suggest that Sinchi Sacha actively campaigned against Patucue by vis- iting communities that were undecided and encouraging them to vote against him. In at least one community, it is said to have given community members T-shirts in an attempt to influence the vote, and two other communities are said to have been promised their own development projects for voting against Patucue. Whatever the truth of these accusations, Sinchi Sacha did involve itself in the Uni6n Huacamayos's political process. Its attempts to manipulate FOIN and Union Huacamayos politics ended up creating more conflict. Further conflict arose around the site chosen for the museum. Barrio San Agustin had never been affiliated with either FOIN or the Uni6n Huacamayos.'o When the plans for the museum were drafted, the barrio was not informed about them, and when members of San Agustin's women's organization heard of them they felt that they should have been included in the proposal. Sinchi Sacha tried to calm the women by offering them work in the construction of the museum and jobs at the museum once it was finished, all of this without consulting the Union Huacamayos. Its rationale was that the museum was supposed to be for "everyone" and that since Mundos Amaz6nicos was to be located in San Agustin it only made sense to include them as beneficiaries of the project. Sinchi Sacha and the barrio signed an agreement outlining the initial details of the work arrangement, and Sinchi Sacha provided food and transportation as the women collected materials to construct one of the cabaiias at the museum at their own expense. Gonzailez, however, envisioned the women of San Agustin as future beneficiaries of the profits generated at the museum. He suggested that "our general view regard- ing how to intervene in projects is that the organizations that participate should be those that are recognized as project beneficiaries." When the Uni6n leaders learned of Barrio San Agustin's participation, they were furious. Patucue explained that since the barrio was not a member organization of FOIN or of the Uni6n Huacamayos, it should not be receiving benefits from the project. He interpreted this as a slight to the Uni6n and FOIN and an attempt by Sinchi Sacha to divide and weaken the Uni6n. A let- ter from Patucue to Gonzalez from November 1997 reads: "We would like you to think and reflect upon the damage that you are causing the Uni6n, by promoting division within the Union and also by seeking to stir up other phantasmal organizations that FOIN has not approved as members because they are members of other federations." Gonzalez considered this another example of the inability of the Uni6n to separate politics from economics. He suggested that the requirement that all organizations be members of FOIN and the Uni6n Huacamayos in order to receive benefits from the projects was totalitarian and that the Uni6n should not be able to impose such a</page><page sequence="14">Wilson / CULTURE AS RESOURCE IN AMAZONIAN ECUADOR 175 requirement: "The women's organization of San Agustin wasn't a member of FOIN and didn't want to be a member. They have this right, and we cannot force them. But the Union excluded the barrio because it wasn't a member. We thought that since there are blacks, since there are mestizos, everyone should participate in the museum." This lack of respect for or understanding of indigenous politics highlights Sinchi Sacha's general lack of comprehen- sion of the local political context in which it was working. When the women learned that the Union planned to exclude them from the project, they threatened to burn down the museum and dynamite the petroglyph rock. The Union attempted to secure the museum by placing a lock and chain around the entrance gate. The women responded by buying their own lock and chain and placing it on the same gate. This brief standoff was temporarily resolved when the Uni6n agreed to give the women posi- tions at the museum as long as the barrio became an active member of FOIN and the Union. Neither ultimately transpired, and tension persisted. WHO CAN SELL CULTURE? To return to the words of Jesus Gonzalez that open this article, what was oddly absent from the conflict over the construction of the museum was dis- cussion or debate about its contents. Sinchi Sacha suggested through its words and its actions that it had the right and authority to represent Amazo- nian indigenous cultures. Its actions revealed its advantaged position in rela- tion to its indigenous counterparts. It never questioned its authority to repre- sent Amazonian Indians ethnographically or its capacity to represent them accurately. In fact, it symbolically placed its seal upon the museum and Quichua culture itself by adopting a petroglyph as its emblem and emblazon- ing it on the museum spire. While the Union Huacamayos and FOIN did not contest the cultural con- tent of the museum, what they did resist was Sinchi Sacha's attempt to depoliticize the use of indigenous culture for economic ends. Indigenous organizations have devoted as much attention to resisting cultural as material domination (Schroder, 1991; Hale, 1994). As a result, they present their movements as struggles over cultural meaning as much as struggles for mate- rial benefit (Hale, 1994; Escobar, 1992). In the context of "culturally appro- priate" sustainable development, the cultural and the economic overlap in ways perceived as dangerous by indigenous leaders. In the case of Mundos Amaz6nicos, what was at stake was not cultural representation per se but who had the right to benefit from the commodification of culture in museum form.</page><page sequence="15">176 LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES The buying and selling of cultural forms runs the risk of co-optation of those forms by forces not entirely under local people's control. FOIN and the Union Huacamayos feared the loss of control over what they perceived to be their own cultural resources. As FOIN's president suggested in 1998,1 "Sinchi Sacha is running the project. They have their museum in Quito. How long are they going to take from us? They are taking everything from us. There are many organizations that treat us like this, so we have to be careful. They offer us a little bit of money, and then they try to divide the com- munities." Patucue likewise suggested that Sinchi Sacha benefited unfairly from the construction of the museum. He threatened to start a media cam- paign against it so that "[Jesuis Gonzalez] can never make money in the names of indigenous people again." Even within indigenous communities it was hotly contested who could claim cultural authenticity and therefore the right to benefit from the museum. The conflicts between San Agustin and FOIN and the Union Huacamayos raise larger questions relating to issues of pan-Quichua versus localized Quichua identity. The women of San Agustin argued that those who inhabited the museum site and its vicinity (i.e., the Quichua of San Agustin) had a legitimate claim to the benefits of the museum. They claimed owner- ship of the petroglyph boulder inside the museum grounds as a central com- ponent of their cultural identity and culture history. The members of the Union Huacamayos, however, suggested that the women of San Agustin did not deserve the benefits of the museum because they were not members of the Uni6n or FOIN. Patucue argued that the benefits should be reserved for those directly involved in indigenous political struggles, which he considered a central component of Quichua (and all indigenous) identity. CONCLUSION The potential for effective collaboration between indigenous organiza- tions and intermediate NGOs has been complicated by the history and poli- tics of sustainable development in the Amazon. Indigenous organizations are increasingly suspicious of NGOs and their agendas, and the removal of indig- enous organizations from the development loop has left many resentful of the intermediate NGOs that now occupy their places. Furthermore, some of the concerns I have raised about the capacity of NGOs to promote the develop- ment of alternative economies in Ecuador's Amazon are not simply situa- tional. Many of these NGOs have strong political agendas that are not neces- sarily complementary to those of the indigenous organizations with whom they must still collaborate. Using indigenous culture as a resource through</page><page sequence="16">Wilson / CULTURE AS RESOURCE IN AMAZONIAN ECUADOR 177 which to foster alternative economies politicizes culture-not necessarily in the sense of the way in which culture is represented or used but in terms of who has the right to claim ownership of those cultural forms in order to trans- late them into economic benefit. By closely linking culture and economics through development projects, "culturally appropriate" sustainable develop- ment becomes highly contentious. Indigenous organizations and intermedi- ate NGOs have found cooperation in this terrain elusive, and this has weak- ened attempts by both groups to promote local-level sustainable economic development in indigenous communities. NOTES 1. While no systematic study of these petroglyphs has been conducted, the carvings in the boulder at the museum and numerous other boulders in the region are thought to have been important communicative tools, representing mythical creatures or religious figures, anthropo- morphic and animal sketches, and perhaps maps of the region (Porras, 1985; Paymal and Sosa, 1993). 2. The ethnic groups represented in the museum are Achuar, Cofan, Huaorani, Quichua, Shuar, Siona-Secoya, and Zaparo. 3. The FECD believes that the most effective mechanism for development in local commu- nities is through the coordinated efforts of Ecuadorian NGOs or grassroots organizations and individual communities or groups of communities. As a result, it tends to finance domestic NGOs to implement projects in cooperation with local organizations and communities. 4. These and other names used in the text to refer to individuals are pseudonyms. 5. The regional indigenous organizations in Ecuador's Amazon are widely varied in scope and constituencies. Some of these organizations, such as FOIN, are provincial-level organiza- tions serving single ethnic groups. Others, such as Organizaci6n de Pueblos Indigenas de Pastaza (Organization of Indigenous Peoples of Pastaza-OPIP) in Pastaza Province, are pro- vincial-level organizations but have multiethnic constituencies. Still others, such as the Organizaci6n de la Nacionalidad Huaorani de la Amazonia Ecuatoriana (Organization of the Huaorani Nationality of the Ecuadorian Amazon-ONHAE) represent a single ethnic group but are smaller than their provincial-level counterparts. There are also a large number of indigenous organizations that consider themselves independent of the regional and national organizations. Three of these exist in the city of Tena, which is also home to FOIN, and while they have only a fraction of the membership of FOIN they do compete with it for members. 6. A discussion of the impacts of agrarian reform and colonization in the late 1960s and 1970s is beyond the scope of this article, but these impacts should not be underestimated. The Ecuadorian state's drive to occupy the Amazon Basin for the combined interests of a perceived threat to national security and the perceived unlimited economic potential of the region prompted the state to promote widespread Amazonian colonization. Contained within the agrar- ian reform legislation were statutes that regulated land use and promoted the adoption of cattle ranching and "modem" agriculture (Rudel, 1983; Salazar, 1977). For further discussion of agrar- ian reform and colonization in the Amazon and its impacts on local Quichua communities, see Perreault in this issue.</page><page sequence="17">178 LATIN AMERICAN PERSPECTIVES 7. Because of the chronic failure of sustainable-development projects to make a lasting impression in Ecuador's Amazon, some NGO workers have begun to refer to it as the "graveyard of development" (Lazaro Maman, personal communication). Gonzalez himself refers to the region in this way and suggests that the cultural conditions necessary for development are not prominent in indigenous communities and indigenous organizations. Like many development specialists, he is quick to blame the failures of past projects on local cultural, social, or economic conditions that would have limited the potential of even a well-designed project. 8. These figures relate to all classes of NGOs in Ecuador and not simply to those working with indigenous communities on development issues, but the increase in NGOs during the first half of the 1990s is striking. Ecuador's ongoing economic recession also has contributed to the rise in new NGOs, as many middle-class intellectuals have found starting an NGO to be a viable and prosperous economic alternative (Bebbington et al., 1993). This has led to questions regard- ing the motives of some NGO staffers, as some analysts have suggested that it may be more the profit motive than a desire to help alleviate poverty in marginal communities that drives individ- uals to found or work for NGOs (Fisher, 1997; Reyna, 1997). 9. The individual whom Gonzalez and Pinto wanted to see as president of the Uni6n was the president of one of its member communities. After his failed attempt to win the presidency this individual essentially broke his ties with the Uni6n, and his community has become a source of conflict within it. 10. In fact, one condition for membership in the Uni6n Huacamayos is membership in FOIN. 11. The president at this time had recently replaced Huatatoca, who had been removed from office earlier that year.
