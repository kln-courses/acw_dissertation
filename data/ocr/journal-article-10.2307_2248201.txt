[Two problems are to be considered: whether real evolution and real eternity can be congruous in the realm of concrete existences, and whether the idealistic eternal can conceivably be related in any logically consistent or practically pertinent way with the empirically undeniable existence of the temporal and the evolving. The constant of physical science fails us; for a world in which qualitative evolu- tion is supposed to take place is one in which, as a total, quantitative con- stancy cannot be said to subsist. The eternal of Neo-Kantian idealism also fails us; Thomas Aquinas, Hegel, Green, Howison, McTaggart are one and all unable to relate the eternal to the temporal. In fact, the eternal is the characteristic but not necessarily incorrigible distemper of adoles- cent metaphysics. A thoroughly temporalistic way of thinking has its technical categories for the most part still to forge, but of its main prin- ciple we have by this time a right to be confident.] C. M. Bakewell. 'I dealism and Realism.' [Many of the charges brought against current idealism are mere absurdities, although most of them may be extracted by interpretation from the esse-percipi theory. It is forgotten that Berkeley was chiefly concerned to demolish the substantial matter of earlier realism, and it is also forgotten that the first searching criticism of the esse-pereipi dictum was made by the first great idealist. In fact, a realism which makes its reals lie outside of experience has subjectivism for its twin error, and idealism has from the outset been a conscious re- pudiation of subjectivism. Since the modern idealist keeps the distinc- tion between subjective and objective, and heartily believes in the reality of the natural order, and since the modern realist teaches that the real is the experienceable and the intelligible, it would seem that reconciliation should be possible: it is, however, hindered by the desire for a residual, non-experienced reality, or by the identification of idealism with immediatism, or by acceptance as metaphysical of the distinction between physical and mental phenomena. Idealism simply realises the desire in and through individual experience to reach universal experience: starting ontologically from the object side, or epistemologically from the subject side of the subject-object relation, it comes to view the real as 'idea,' which is both form and content, thread of meaning and detail, manifold and unity of experience.] 0. Ewald. 'German Philosophy ina 1908.' [The Heidelberg Congress showed the power of Neo-Kanti- anism; Neo-Fichteanism is supported by Miinsterberg and, on the'logical side, by Cohn. The influence of Schelling is attested by von Hartmann's school; that of Hegel by Eucken and Simmel. Another line of deriva- tion from Kant leads, by way of Fries, to Nelson and to the phenomen- ologists (Gomperz) ; the latter are connected with Gnosticism and Romanticism by Schmitt. It is in Neo-Romanticism (Joel) that the current struggle for philosophical insight finds most tangible expression.] Reviews of Books. Notices of New Books.

[Characterises, first, works upon ancient (Brochard, Hamelin, Rodier, Robin, Brehier) and mediaval philosophy (Martin, Rousselot). A series of books on the principles of science (Duhem Milhaud, Hannequin) takes us to Pascal (Strowski), Newton (Bloch), Cournot (Mentre), evolutionism (Berthelot, Thouverez), and the minor Cartesians (Prost). Spinoza finds recognition at the hands of Appuhn, Brochard, Colonna d'Istria; Bayle is treated by Delvolve, Hel- vetius by Keim, Knutzen, Leibniz and Kant by van Biema, and Kant by Delbos.] E. B. Talbot. ' Individuality and Freedom.' [It is often said that, if we deny the existence of real alternatives in the choices of men, we rob personality of all significance. Now individuality implies -unity (which in its higher forms involves great inner complexity)-, unique- ness (which rests upon a broad basis of similarity), and some degree of self-sufficiency. It is clear, first, that the denial of real alternatives is more fully in harmony than its assertion dould be with the conception of the self as unitary. Logically, again, the possibility of two actions at a given time must mean that choice does not proceed from the self, i.e., that the self is not self-sufficient. And, lastly, the most serious objec- tions, that without alternatives every action would be predictable and life itself deprived of its vividness and actuality, fall to the ground if we assume that every element of reality is unique and that time and change are of the essence of reality.] E. G. Spaulding. ' The Postulates of a Self-critical Epistemology.' [A self-critical epistemology must be consistent in its use of terms; must be free of contradiction either of part by part, or of part by whole, or conversely; must apply to itself, presuppose and imply itself; and must incorporate in itself its own presuppositions, and yet derive them from itself., The logic upon which it is based must treat of the infinite intensionally; must accept the doctrine of the externality of relations to their terms ; and must work by way of discontinuity. On these foundations, the writer works out a series of fifteen postulates, which are necessary and adequate to the establish- ment of a self-critical theory of knowledge.] Reviews of Books.

'Time- relations of the Affective Processes.' [Experiments made with series of paired colours, groups of geometrical figures, etc., passing before the ob- server at known and variable rates, show that an affective process may be aroused in *75 to 1-00 sec., and that affective intensity decreases with decrease of time of exposure. Reaction experiments with single colours and with tones confirm the author's previous conclusion that the reaction- method is applicable to affective processes, and that affective times and their variability are either absolutely or relatively of the same order as sensory times and their variability ; the time-relation of affective to sensory process varies, however, with the different sensory fields. In general, affection requires a longer time for arousal than sensation; the author ascribes this fact to the lack of affective clearness.] E. L. Thorndike. 'A Note on' the Accuracy of Discrimination of Weights and Lengths.' [Record of experiments with weights (72 observers; 8 tests with a -standard of 100 gr., 8 with 200 gr.) and drawing of lines (37 observers ; 30 tests with a standard of 50 mm., 30 with 100 mm.) by the error method. The deviation from the standard is regarded as the inverse measure of accuracy of discrimination. 'In general tendency, the 200 gr. weight shows an error 1,585 times that of the 100 gr., and the 100 mm. line gives deviations from the standard 1 8 times those of the 50 mm., or</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 289 a variable error of 1 4 times. These results are made the basis of a polemic against a psychophysical law. Accuracy in sense-discrimination has developed as a function of instinctive response to concrete objects, and laboratory work is artificial. ] G. M. Whipple. ' A " Range of Information " Test.' [Extension and supplement of Kirkpatrick's voca- bulary test; 100 test-words are so chosen that each represents some specific field of knowledge or activity (American history, chemistry, French, golf, etc.). Typical results, quantitative and qualitative, are given.] J. V. Breitweiser. 'Resistance of Keys as a Factor in Reaction Times.' [Experiments with spring key and ergograph. With- in the limits employed (50 to 1500 gr.), reaction time varies with key- resistance; in experimentation the resistance should therefore be known and stated. Rate of tapping, also varies directly with resistance. Ex- cess force of reaction movement is, on the other hand, largely indepen- dent of resistance; the graphic records show a tendency to rhythm, especially in tapping; the excess decreases, mor e or less regyularly, with practice. The results may be due, in slight degree, to compression of finger-tip; chiefly, however, they are to be explained by muscular elasticity; time of formation of nervous impulse possibly plays a part.] Announcement. [Seventh international congress.]-Vol. xvi., No. 6. H. T. Woolley. 'Some Experiments on the Colour Perceptions of an Infant and their Interpretation.' [Experiments by the method of paired comparisons prove that colour vision mnay exist in an infant at six months. R, B, Y are certainlly seen as colours; G is doubtful. The child pre- ferred R, and was indifferent to G. Soon after this age, interest in colour lapses; the child is developing miiotor co-ordinations. Then, at about eighteen months, the interest revives; motor facility has been acquired, and sensory discrimination is free again. The fact that children learn other descriptive adjectives before those for colour has a pragmatic sanction; words like 'hot,' 'dark' are of hiah practical imnportance.] E. B. Holt. 'On Ocular Nystagmus and the Localisation of Senisory Data during Dizziness.' [A subject rotated with eyes closed experiences sensa- tions from extra-peripheral stimuli (air currents, etc.), and from proprio- ceptive organs (joints, inuscles, etc.), as well as true sensations of motion, which depend in somlie way upon the non-auditory structures of the internal ear. The precise function of the labyrinlth is, however, still under debate. On the other hand, it is agreed that visual dizziness is closely connected with nystagmic eye-movements. The author's experiments show that voluntary inhibition of the nystagmus abolishes the sense of rotation, not merely after the turningy has stopped, but during the actual rotation itself. This result flatly contradicts those of Mach; and as Macli was a very careful observer, we miiust have recourse to individual differences. Now individual differences in the movement of after-images seem to depend, not upon eye-movement sensations, but upon mode of inner- vation (voluntary, semi-voluntary, involuntary). This fact may be carried over by analogy to visual dizziness: the 'sensation of rotation' is not a sensation at all, in the ordinary sense; the process most nearly parallel to the experience of rotation is a kind of innervationi process. Afferent impulses come from various, and so far unidentified sources, converge in the central nervous system, and pass out as a unified and definite innervation to eye-movement.] F. G. Henke and M.

B. Breese. 'Binocular Rivalry.' [The average phase, length for 10 mm. squares crossed by vertical and horizontal lines is 1 84- sec. (previous work with diagronal lines gave 1-89 sec.). The smaller th&amp; stimulus, the longer the phase; this result is analogous to that obtainedc with variation of intensity of light. The phase lengthens also with in- distinctness of image. In direct it is rather less than half what it is in indirect vision.] Minor Studies from the Psychological Laboratory of Wellesley College.-i. E. A. McC. Gamble. 'Intensity as a Criterion in Estimating the Distance of Sounds.'

'Darwinism and Logic: a-Reply to Professor Creighton.' [There is no contradiction between the point of view of evolution, dualistic as it is, and that of a truly psychical account of the genesis of knowledge; the latter issues in and justifies the former. In the last resort both mechanism and teleology are, when legitimately em- ployed, naturalistic or empirical categories; both are valid, but both aro restricted in their proper use: and both are superseded in a hypolricalge mode of experience.] AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY. Vol. XX., No. 4. L. R. Geiss- ler. 'The Measurement of Attention.' [Opens with a review of the experimental work on attention, which the author classifies, in two ways, according to the methods employed. (1) The method of distraction, or single-task miethod, was first used by Wundt and Obersteiner in 1874; the method of division of attention, or double-task method, by Loeb in 1886. (2) For purposes of systematic review, it is best to classify the methods as those of expression and of impression. The former have utilised peripheral vision, muscular strength, liminal and differential sensitivity, reaction time, and accuracy of work; the latter; only tho&amp; presentation of graded distractors. The writer made three series of experiments: on motor inhibition (negative result), on degrees of clear- ness with continuous addition, and on degrees of clearness with marking circles (adaptation of McDougall's test). He finds a very close parallelism between introspectively distinguishable variations of attention and differ- ences in the accuracy of work performed at these levels, under the con- ditions that degree of attention is estimated in terms of clearness, and that the work itself is influenced by nothing else than change in atten- tion; under the same conditions, the estimate of quality of work is by no, means as reliable as that of degree of attention. He finds, further, that there are two types of the attentive consciousness: the dual-division, in which a reciprocal relation holds between the two levels, and the multi- level formation.] W. H. Pyle. 'An Experimental,Study of Expecta- tion.' [Review of literature; report of experiments on expectation of visual, auditory, touch and temperature stimuli, on reaction, on expecta- tion of words, numbers and geometrical figures, and on the watching of' situations calculated to arouse expectation. Expectation has a special conscious pattern; it is initiated by a perception (never, in the writer's experience, by an idea), which is followed by kineesthetic and organic- sensations, and in some cases by verbal ideas. These sensations are the conscious aspect of a problem or Aufgabe, set up by the perception as the-</page><page sequence="5">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 291 result of habit. The image of expectation is conspicuous by its absence. Consciousness is not attentional; it is rather all background and no focus.

A first series, i-n which complicated visual figures were exposed for memorisation under various conditions, showed that recollection is an affective phenomenon partially intellectualised in images; the non-representative or affective factor appeared as consciousness of omission (vague or specific), as feeling of recognition, and as verbal or imaginal symbolism. A second series, aiming by similar means at an analysis of the process of recognition, showed that recognition may take place without the intervention of an image; it is, again, an affective phenomenon, a feeling of familiarity in- corporated in the impression.] H.

Results: the test offers no technical difficulties; the quality of the reactions is significant, though psycho- analysis is indispensable as a supplement to the test; the averag(e times of reaction are also extremely significant, though again analysis is valu- able, especially in the case of the control-observers ; the inethod of reproduction, on the contrary, is of little value. The experiments bring out certain limitations of the test, but show that it possesses l)ositive validity. If applied in legal practice to accused persons, it should )recede any examination in the court room.] A. J. Schulz. ' Untersuchungen iiber die Wirkung gleicher Reize auf die Auffassung bei momentaner Exposition.-ii.' [Introspective account of observers' experiences during and after the exposure. The results are explained by the tendency of the identical elements to stand out clearly, at once and together; this tendency failed to appear in the work of Ranschburg and Aall, because their material favoured a successive, while the new material favours a simultaneous apprehension of the series.] Literaturbericht.-Bd. lii., Heft 5 und 6.

[Three hysterical subjects showed, under hypnosis, functional changes that were not due to suggestion, but accompanied other changes induced by suggestion or by way of a physiological reflex. These half-spontaneous phenomena were of four kinds; the connexion might obtain between motor and sensory function, between analgesia and vascular constriction, between one sensory function and another on the same side of the body; and between motor and sensory function and tendinous reflexes. After reviewing the recorded cases, the writer offers a physiological explanation, in terms of a reciprocally effected change in the excitability of the sensory and motor centres, possibly resulting from exclusion of the suggested centre. Hysteria, he thinks, is not essential, though it is favourable to. the phenomena; on the other hand, the phenomena themselves may give us the key to a number of disputed questions regar4ing hysteria.]- Litera- turbericht.-Bd. liii., Heft 1. L. J. Martin. 'Uber asthetische Synas- thesie. [Report of experiments, by the serial method and the method of suggestion, upon photographs and coloured reproductions of works of art or natural objects, and upon plain colours, made with a view to the description and evaluation of the 'pseudo-sensations' attaching to csthetic contemplation. These pseudo-sensations are the sense-experiences syn.Eesthetically aroused by the sight of painting, sculpture, architecture, or by the reading or hearing of literary productions. The results show. that the lower senses not only possess oesthetic value, but that their pseudo-sensations may actually form the basis of an csthetic impression.. They show, on the other hand, that it is impossible to ground a theory of oesthetics upon the facts of synasthesia, since this may be wholly lacking where the esthetic impression is strong, may be crossed by association, and again may, if well marked, prompt a negative as, well as a positive judgment. The pseudo-sensations themselves partake of the character both of sensation and of image, and thus form a con- necting link between the two. The writer describes them in detail, and&amp; also discusses certain points of method.] S. Witasek. 'Lokalisations- differenz und latento Gleichgewichtsstdrung.' [It had been objected: to the writer that his 'difference of monocular localisation' was really due to a latent divergence of the eyes. In disproving this criticism, he takes occasion to report further modifications of the experiments, and to extend his theoretical discussion, especially with regard to a possible translation of the point of attention; he also gives a geometrical deri- vation of the difference of binocular and monocular localisation. The result of the previous paper is reaffirmed.] Literaturbericht.-Bd. liii., Heft 2 und 3. H. S. Langfield. ' Uber die heterochrome Helligkeits- vergleichung.' [All the indirect methods of colour photometry base in the last resort upon the possibility of the direct method, i.e., of the direct comparison of colour with colour or with grey for equality or difference of tint. The writer reports experiments made, in this direct. way, by the large Helmholtz spectral apparatus and by a modification of Hering's tinting apparatus. The method is feasible and leads to. consistent results, if the observer has had sufficient practice, and if he adheres strictly to a single criterion. Two modes of judgment proved&amp; -to be common: a judgment in terms of the 'shine' of the colours, and a judgment in terms of their 'density' or 'opacity': in the latter- case. the colours compared were seen as screens sta'nding before a source of light.] M.

If his view is correct, then the phenomena of con- trast should be variable by hypnotic suggestion. A series of careful post-hypnotic experiments with coloured shadows, tissue-covered discs, etc., gave, however, a negative result. Thus, a field might be seen as deep blue, by suggestion; yet the sbadow cast by objectively white light showed as black. Or a blue field might be seen as colourless, by sug- gestion; yet the shadow still showed the contrast yellow. The writer accordingly accepts the Hering (physiological) explanation.] S. Meyer. 'Zum TrauumprobleiA.' [Dream ideas are not hallucinatory, since they lack the spatial and temporal reference of perception; they are not very intensive, but are overestimated in regard to itntensity; they are not specially clear; and they are rarely coloured by strong emotion. Hence there is in dreaming no dominant motive, no prevalent impulse, no volition; dreaming, is simply a disturbance of sleep, a first beginning of waking. The writer criticises adversely Freud's theory and interpre- tation of the dream consciousness, and emphasises strongly the scrappy, incoherent character of dreamns, and the tendency to round them out in subsequent narration.] Literaturbericht. Gesellschaft ftir experi- mentelle Psychologie.-Bd. liii., Heft 4 und 5. A. von Sybel. ' Uber das Zusammenwirken verschiedener Sinnesgebiete bei Gedachtnislei- stungen.' [Experiments undertaken by the methods of learning and of right associates, with various modes of presentation of nonsense- syllables and of connected material, to answer the question of the in- fluence of the co-operation of sense departments in presentation upon the economy of learning and upon retention. The method of right associates was supplemented by introspective reports upon definite topics, and the reports were subjected to statistical treatment. The results are set forth in detail, with constant reference to the ideational types of the observers. Thus, as regards reading aloud and reading silently, it is a general rule thfat the former procedure saves time, though the number of right associates is larger in silent reading with constant motor attitude. The individual modes of learning are carefully analysed. On the matter of the co-operation of memory-elements from different sense- departments, the writer finds that the sensory mode of learning becomes, under certain circumstances, a function of the number of repetitions; it accommnodates itself the better to the mode of presentation, the less the particular memory is dominated by a single sense; it may change with practice; etc., etc.] F. M. Urban. 'fUber die bei Durchgangs- beobachtungen auftretende Dezimalgleichung.' [A comparison of Meiss- ner's tables of systematic errors in astronomical observation with the results of psychological experiment shows a close agreement. Thus the estimate of the round second appears oftener than would be expected, by the law of probabilities, but is on the average correct; and the ac- cordance of actual and estimated time in the interval 0 6 to 0 7 sec. confirms the existence of a psychological indifference-point (placed by experiment at 0 5 to 017 sec.) between the zones of underestimation and overestimation. It is therefore best to leave the astronomical observer uninstructed, and to apply a subsequent correction to his results.] Literaturbericht.-Bd. liii., Heft 6. G. Heymans. 'Untersuchungen fiber psychische Hemmung,' v. [The previous papers had dealt with the inhibition of sensation by sensation; and critics had urged that sensorial, peripheral inhibition is an entirely different matter from ideational inhibition. The present experiments were undertaken to meet the objection. It was found that the differential limen for sen- sations of light varies according as there is present in the adjacent field a greater or lesser light difference, and under circumstances in which the effect of factors such as contrast is eliminated. It follows then that 20</page><page sequence="12">298 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. a given 'feeling of difference' may be inhibited by another 'feeling of difference'; the objection has been successfully met, and the writer's well-known view of the relation of sensation to stimulus is confirmed.] Literaturbericht.-Bd. liv., Heft 1 und 2. F. Hillebrand. 'Die Heterophorie und das Gesetz der identischen Sehrichtungen.' [An exposition and rejoinder called forth by Witasek's recent papers, vols. 1. and liii. (1) The law of identical visual directions simply lays down the rule of localisation within the given visual field; it says nothing of the localisation of the visual field itself, nothing e.g. of the localisation of the pqint of fixation in the sense of the binocular line of regard. (2) Witasek's results are due to an exophoria. Had he repeated his test-experiment on a large number of persons, the results would probably have shown variation, since some of the observers would have had an esophoria. (3) Every position in the visual field may be resolved into two perceptual variables, distance and direction, just as a tone may be resolved into pitch and intensity; for every difference of position may be increased or decreased by change in these two regards. Direction thus applies primarily to the single point in visual space; secondarily, when we abstract from the act of vision and replace this by a second objective point, it implies two points or positions.] R. Heine. 'Ein Beitrag iiber die sogenanuten Vergleichungen iibermerklicher Empfindungs- unterschiede.' [Experiments with grey discs in light adaptation. The results are like those of Fr8bes: the subjective mean, apart from certain values obtained with a middle range of intensities, lies higher than the geometrical mean; in the range of highest intensities, and in certain instances within that of moderate intensities, it lies higher than the arithmetical. (It is to be noted that in both sets of experiments the difference between the two objective means decreases as the brightness of the discs is increased.) If judgment by degree of cohesion is forbidden, the subjective mean falls, as a rule, even below the geometrical; the task of judgment is now extremely difficult.] R. Mueller=Freienfels. 'Die associativen Faktoren im iisthetischen Geniessen.' [Emphasises the complexity of the aesthetic attitude, and illustrates certain factors: the feelings of activity, ranging from the mere pleasure in being occupied to that of the play of the artistic imagination, the feelings of form (com- position of picture -or drama), of tension and relaxation, of surprise; objective and subjective associations and reproduced feelings; feelings of internal imitation of bodily movements and attitudes (nacherlebte Zustainde), and feelings which are read interpretatively into works of art, music or architecture (zugefi6h1te Z.) ; the idea of self in the attitudes of participant and of spectator. The paper gives a wealth of detailed observation, and offers, besides a criticism of the empathy-theory, a discussion of objectivity and subjectivity in oeethetic appreciation, and a defence of subject or meaning as a factor in the aesthetic effect.] H. Schuessler. 'UJber die VTerschmelzung von Schallreizen.' [Experi- ments with the electric spark and the sound-hammer. Spark-pairs fuse most easily in the order strong-weak; least easily as weak-weak. Hammer-pairs fuse best when a stronger sound precedes and a weaker follows; hammer-triads should also begin, with a strong stimulus, though triads beginning with a weak sound fuse more easily than pairs; certain triads fuse more roadily to a pair than to a single impression. Fusion may appear with pairs at an interval of 135o-; with triads at 189-; the least average fusion-time found was 3o-, the greatest almost 100. Distributed attention is more favourable to fusion than indefinitely directed; and this again than definitely directed attention.] Literatur- bericht. Aufruf.

'Die objektive Methode der Moralphilosophie bei Wundt und Spencer.' [The objective method in ethics starts out from the given facts of history and of society, founds itself upon the history and natural history of custom (anthropological ethics) and upon the general history of civilisation (historical ethics), and -attempts to evaluate the norms objectively expressed in law (juristic ethics), or the motives to action demonstrable in the phenomena of commercial intercourse (ethics of political economy). The writer expounds and criticises the use made of the method by Wundt (64 pp.) and Spencer (7 pp.). In conclusion he discusses three questions: the significance of the method for an inquiry into the origin of the moral consciousness; its service in,the establishment of the principles of morality; and its importance as justifying the requirement of a moral life. His view is in general favourable; on the last question, e.g., he thinks that the method can show what judgments of value have universal validity, and that an historical consideration of the sceptical schools furnishes arguments for the requirement of a moral life.] K. S. Laurila. 'Ist der -esthetische Eindruck aus einer oder mehrerens Quellen abzuleiten ?' [Lipps refers the iesthetic impression to empathy; K. Lange to conscious self-decep- tion; Groos to inner imitation; and Cohn, Elster and Tolstoy all agree in seeking a single ultimate source. On the other hand, Fechner and, more recently, especially Volkelt and Dessoir have argued for a multiple derivation. The writer urges that we may find a unitary origin for vesthetics in the affective function, in the sense that all characteristic features of the aesthetic impression are, in the last resort, intelligible and explicable from the predominance of feeling in the state of conscious- ness in which that impression consists.] A. Schlesinger. 'Der Begriff des Ideals; systematisch-psychologische Darstellung und Wiirdigung der bisherigen Idealtheorien.' LThis is the continuation of a study the first part of which was published, in separate form, under the title "Der Begriff des Ideals: eine historisch-psychologische Analyse " (1908). Be- ginriing with the definition of an ideal as that mental formation which for the experiencing subject contains in pure form some object as con- nected with some sort of requirement, the author offers as its final de- finition the mental formation which for the experiencing subject contains in pure form of transcendence (Ausserwirklichkeit) some object as con- nected with the requirement of its actuality (Wirklichkeit). The present instalment of the work offers a systematic psychological exposition and evaluation of typical theories of the ideal, and concludes with reference to the value of such conceptual analysis to the normative sciences, and in particular to ethics.] F.

[The writer offers, on the basis of his own experience, the three following conditions of the phenomenon: a state of weakness or fatigue, which limits the persistence of ideas and hinders their reproduction; the anticipation in perception or idea of' a coming experience; and a complete separation between this anticipation and the actual experience, so that when the latter occurs the former has no trace remaining.

[First part of a hiohly technical paper, in which the relation between the method of just noticeable difference and the metnod of constant stimuli is discussed in detail. The writer aimns to show that the former method closely resembles the method employed in empirical measurements, and that its understan-ding is of importance for the theory of errors of observation. This theory rests upon the principle of the arithmetical mean; and the analysis of the method of just noticeable differences indicates that under the conditions of systematic observation the arithmetical mean of a group of results does in fact represent their most probable value.] E.

Meumann. 'Uber Lesen und Schreiben im Traume.' [Careful record of dreams in which reading or writing played the principal part. Such dreams are rare: partly because reading and writing are among our commonest and most accustomed experiences, partly also because they are highly com- plicated activities, and in dreaming consciousness is greatly reduced. The character of the remembered dreams recalls the analogy which Kraepelin found to hold between speech in dreams and certain patho- logical derangements of the speech-function; there are, however, notable differences between dreams of speech and dreams of reading and writiing.] E. Meumann. 'Uber einige optische Tauschungen.' [Figures drawii with perspective shading (barrels, cones, rings, etc.) show irregularities of contour: the lighter parts bulge out, the darker shrink in. The il- lusion is so clear that it is involuntarily allowed for by drauchtsmnen. Its main cause is, undoubtedly, irradiation. But since this, a purely optical factor, is here opposed to the associative factor of perspective apprehen- sion, we have in the figures clear evidence that physical and physiological conditions may outweigh psychological. The evidence is especially valu- able in view of the present conflict of theories (Wundt, Lipps).] Gesell- schaft fur experimentelle Psychologie. Literaturbericht. PHILOSOPHISCHES JAHRBUCH. Bd. xix., Heft 4. Outberlet. 'Eine Ethik des freien Wollens.' [This short paper is partly a review, partly a refutation of Max Wentscher's Ethik, which appeared last year. The writer fully appreciates the value of a work that affirms Free-will in con- tradiction to many modern thinkers; but considers that in raising Free- will to the height of a moral principle, he has gone too far. And, though not scornfully hostile to Christianity, he in several places misjudges its doctrines and tendencies.] Klunke. 'Der Instinkt.' [The writer goes on to point out that instinct, though partly a mechanical and physio- logical process, has also its psychological side; and he defines it as a psychophysical activity which under certain stimuli causes the psycho- physical system to perform actions which surely and uniformly tend towards a purpose which, however, is unknown as such. A third article, in conclusion, is to follow.] Stehle. 'Die Phantasie und ihr Tatig- keit.' [This second and last paper on the subject exaamines the phenomena of dreams, forebodings, mental suggestions, Telepathy and Spiritism, gives several instances of phenomena of the latter kinds, criticises the scientific explanations offered, and shows that in certain</page><page sequence="15">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 301 cases they can only be explained by the direct action of one mind upon another.] Endres. 'Fredegisus und Candidus.' [A short paper con- cerniing two philosophers of the early Middle Ages (782-834 circiter). The former was deeply imbued with the ideas of Alcuini, his master, and in a short tractate, De Nihilo et Teniebris, strives to prove that both have ob- jective existence. The latter, whose work, Dicta Candidi, is still extant, therein attempts, somewhat lamely, to prove God's existence. He ascends from matter to life, thence to man, and to a 'Higher One' yet.] Uebinger. ' Nikolaus Treverensis.' [A long article, strictly historical, on the career and works of Nicholas of Treves, dividing it and them into five periods: his student life (1425); his secretaryship with Cardinal Orsini (1426-7); his life in his own country (1428-9); at Rome (1430), and on the Rhine (1430-7).] RIVISTA DI FILOSOFIA.

[The doctrine of intellectual perception, ori- ginated by the immortal Reid, was coumpleted and amended by Rosmini. The process so designated involves four distinct elements: (1) The sen- sation; (2) the idea or the universal (by this seems to be meant what we call the concept); (3) the affirmation or judgment by which sensations are brought under concepts; (4) existence. This last is apparently seized by intuition, and answers to the copula in a proposition. Now the leading difference between Rosmini and Ardigo seems to be that the head of the Italian Positivist school, while holding on to the idea of existence as the necessary assunmption of all knowledge, ascribes our pos- session of it not to a quasi-mystical intuition but to the gradual evolution of the less into the more distinct, vague sensations clustering into co- herent perceptions and judgments.] E. d'Ors. 'Religio est Libertas.' [According to Prof. d'Ors all life whether it consists of work or play es sentially takes the formi of a struggle between ourselves and an opposing force-the not-ourselves. First we fight against the external world with our physical organs, then by a new dualism mind is opposed to body, and finally the mental faculties themselves come to be regarded as part of the environment, of the cosmic fatalities that hem us iD. Then nothing remains but the pure consciousness of freedom as such-and the recogni- tion of this is the ultimate and only true religion.] Rodolfo Mon- dolfo. ' Studi sui tipi rappresentativi.' [A series of observations on his own mentality have led the writer to the conclusion that while visual and auditory sensations are actually revived in memory, kiniesthetic or sensori-motor feelings are not revived as images but physically repro- duced as an accompaniment of more or less conscious movements.] A. Faggi. 'Lo Schelling e la Filosofia dell' Arte.' [An account of Schel- ling's philosophy of art as set forth in the famous 'Lectures on Univer- sity Studies,' recently reprinted in the three-volume edition of his select works.

[The dawn of the twentieth century has been signalised by a reaction against the ideas of the nineteenth closely resembling the romantic movement of a hundred years ago. Now Fichte's career coincides with and explains the great reaction that came after Kant's philosophy and with the French Revolution. It should therefore be studied if we wish to understand the similar crisis of our own day. It may be mentioned that the parallel between Kant's Critique and the Revolution was,</page><page sequence="16">302 PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. we believe, first suggested by Fr. Schlegel.] Erminio Troilo. 'La relazioni tra la filosofia e la scienza.' [There is no philosophy of any particular science, but there is a philosophy of science in general, or, to put the same truth differently, philosophy supplies the abstract form and science the concrete content which in their synthesis constitute knowledge as a whole. More precisely: Epistemology or theory of knowledge is the only possible philosophy. We must return to Kant's formula: Concepts without intuitions are empty; intuitions without concepts are blind. But Kant's particular systematisation is not binding on the thought of the present day.] Adolfo Levi. 'I1 fenomenismo empiristico.' [Gives, so far, a careful account of the theories of knowledge represented by Mill's 'permanent possibilities of sensation,' with the reserve of personal identity as an inexplicable ultimate, and of Avenarius's theories of 'least effort' and 'introjection'. The subject is to be continued in a future number.] Ludovico Limentani. 'La Supremazia del criterio morale nella valutazione degli atti.' [How can the moral law, once so respected, validate its claims against the rising scepticism of our age, an age in which the right of the stronger, the worship of success, the accomplished fact, and the legitim!acy of natural instinct are asserting themselves with ever-increasing audacity against the old asceticism? Not at any rate, in the writer's opinion, by a return to the religious beliefs of the past. But neither does modern science seem likely to take their place as an ethical sanction. Still Spencer at least shows a good spirit and offers a few helpful suggestions. Nor is Nietzsche so black as he has been painted. Meanwhile amoralism has at least freed us from the intoler- able oppression of sermons. -Nevertheless some may think that the jeremiads of Limentani offer a strong family resemblance, though not on the side of piquancy, to the discourses of Father Vaughan.]-Anno i., No. 4, July-September, 1909. Roberto Ardigo. 'Fisico e psichico contrapposti.' [Contends against Tyndall and Griesinger that there is no insuperable chasm between the world of extension and the world of con- sciousness. They exhibit the common character of existence, represented by each under a different specification. That irreconcilable opposition of which we hear so much is the result of our own intellectual evolution whose very law is to pass from the less to the more-distinct. Posi- tivism has no more to fear from the reactionary big-wigs among the University professors of our day than the physics and astronomy of Galileo and Kepler had to fear from the Aristotelian big-wigs of the early seventeenth century.] Alessandro Chiapelli. 'La critica filosofica e il concetto del "Dio vivente".' [The old anthropomorphic conception of a personal God has been irrevocably destroyed by modern thought. But there is room for something as much above personality as that is above mechanical energy, to be conceived after the analogy of the ultra-violet rays in the solar spectrum. The Unknowable of Herbert Spencer and the Eternal Consciousness of T. H. Green seem both to point towards such a God, who also seems to be foreshadowed in the self-4hinking thought of Aristotle. But all will not agree with Prof. Chiapelli in hold- ing that quantitative analogies can be transferred in this summary fashion to the dialectic of concepts.] Adolfo Levi. 'I1 fenomenismo empiris- tico.' [After completing his account of Avenarius Levi goes on to analyse the theories of Mach and Ostwald. His conclusion is that phenomenism, after approaching Kant's criticism, as closely as was consistent with its premises, in the philosophy of Renouvier, returns to Hume's position with J. S. Mill, subsequently tending with Avenarius, Mach, and Ostwald towards a realism which in the case of Ostwald seems much more nearly akin to materialism than to ordinary experience.] Ludovico Limentani. 'La Supremazia del Criterio Morale.' [After all there is a good deal to</page><page sequence="17">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 303 be said for the old-fashioned morality and against the transference of popular sympathy from the law-breaker to his victim. In view of the present corruption it is desirable as a first step that moral education should take a greater place and be carried on by more enlightened methods in Italian schools. This arbicle affords one more illustration of the fervour with which the whole higher intellect of Italy is now throwing itself into the educational question.] Autorelazioni, etc. RIVISTA FILOSOFICA.
