Was this sense of dedication uniquely strong in Japan as a product of the "healthy nationalism" of the Meiji era? Or was it similar to the desire of many intellectuals in any modern society to be relevant and influential? How general was this feeling: what led some "public men" in Japan to run the risk of ostracism? The author briefly cites the case of Yanaihara Tadao (p. 24 and p. 261, n. 54). He, like Nambara, was greatly influenced by the Christian leader, Uchimura Kanzo, and taught at Tokyo Imperial Univer- sity. Yet Yanaihara had to forfeit his post after presenting a direct critique of Japan's diplomatic and military policies in China as harmful to that na- tion's independent development. Two writers, whom the book mentions only in passing, provide other examples of resistance. Baba Tsunego, a prominent journalist like Hasegawa, continued his scathing attacks on the growing power of the military and the civilian bureaucracy at the expense of the Diet's authority until the proscription of his works in 1941. Kiyosawa Kiyoshi also suffered the same fate for his blunt assessments of Japan's for- eign policies. As the author suggests, for some intellectuals a transcendent ideology may have facilitated resistance; a firm Christian pacificism bol- stered Yanaihara. The cases of Baba and Kiyosawa, however, seem more difficult to explain from that perspective. They might have felt to a lesser extent the imperative of national service or they might have defined it differently. This fine book has introduced to Western-language scholarship two im- portant Japanese writers and has helped us understand better the struggles of Japanese intellectuals during the turbulent years of the early Showa era. Barshay's arguments should stimulate and help guide further studies. In particular, the emphasis on an intellectual's perception of his own role in society provides a useful avenue for examining the reasons for writers' ac- tions in the 1920s and 1930s. Shinto and the State, 1868-1988. By Helen Hardacre. Princeton Univer- sity Press, 1989. xvi, 203 pages. $24.95. Reviewed by ANDREW BARSHAY University of California, Berkeley This is an unpretentious book. Modest in proportion, lightly clothed in the- ory, and sound in its judgments, it presents a chronological and topical re- view of the fateful relationship of Shinto to the Japanese state in modern 205</page><page sequence="2">Journal of Japanese Studies times. Hardacre brings to this work an intimate familiarity with Japan's complex religious history and with the methods and problematics of the "history of religions" as a field of study. Shinto and the State is quite dif- ferent from her earlier Lay Buddhism in Contemporary Japan and Ku- rozumikyo and the New Religions of Japan.' Both of these works were based on participant observation (in the Reiyfikai Kyodan in the former case), carefully constructed anecdotal accounts, and close analyses of sur- vey data. In Shinto and the State, by contrast, we are presented with a "case study of modern relations between religion and state" (p. 3): the work was written as the second in a series on this subject. Indeed, it is clear that the framework preexisted the text. The result is substantially more his- torical and broadly interpretive than Hardacre's previous contributions. As a survey/synthesis, it has the conventionally desired virtues of clear prose and tight organization. It focuses, refreshingly, on the history of Shinto in the social and political periphery, rather than in the center. Hard- acre looks at the activities of priests rather than officials, and draws on "documents of rural areas," for example, rather than "government direc- tives" (p. 7). It also suffers from a number of generic faults. The style is occasionally flat and repetitious (cf. word-for-word appearances of certain sentences and/or phrases on pp. 40, 157, 158). The presentation in places is unjustifiably schematic or truncated, and certain judgments made in pass- ing need more supporting evidence. In the main, Hardacre overcomes what is clearly an assigned framework to make crisp, challenging, and some- times provocative arguments. These, along with certain consequential weaknesses of the book, merit close consideration. Hardacre's chief contention is that Shinto as we know it today is "largely an invented tradition." Moreover, its incarnation in this century as "State Shinto"-that is, as an organized hierarchy of officially patronized shrines and rites centered in Ise-"radically . . . departed from anything in the country's previous religious history" (pp. 3-4). How and why did Shinto, which "in an institutional sense . .. has no legitimate claim to an- tiquity as Japan's 'indigenous religion'" (p. 5), become a state cult? And what role did the priesthood assume in its development? Hardacre addresses these questions in her introduction and first chap- ter. To be sure, she notes, the "ritual practice of the imperial court" formed an important, if largely hidden, "layer" of premodern Shinto (p. 11). So too did Amaterasu's shrine at Ise, with its venerable priestly tra- dition. During the Tokugawa period, Ise became a magnet for pilgrims from all over Japan. Local confraternities and "an informal order of Ise priests called oshi" (p. 16) provided a rudimentary network for this pur- 1.

But the vast majority of Shinto shrines were dedicated to the commu- nal worship of local or clan deities and had no resident priest. Membership in a shrine, moreover, depended on social status and was not automatic (p. 13). Premodern Shint6, Hardacre concludes, was amorphous and by definition peripheral. But it was also ripe for "invention"-and "centralization." Through the medium of kokugaku activists such as Okuni Takamasa and his fol- lowers, the interests and concerns of many priests came to be linked with the broader political movement that culminated in the Meiji Restoration. The establishment of an "imperial" state after 1868 seemed a golden op- portunity for the priesthood; the new state's prestige, they hoped, would become their own. A campaign against Buddhism was launched, allowing priests to vent their common resentment at Shinto's centuries-long subor- dination to and humiliation by Buddhist institutions. "The Department of Divinity (Jingikan) was established as the highest organ of government, even surpassing the Council of State (Dajokan)" (p. 29). The emperor pro- claimed "the unification of rites and government" and worshiped at Ise for the first time in a millenium. The nation's shrines were ranked in a hierar- chy extending downward from Ise. Like the secular hierarchy itself, "offi- cial shrines" (kansha)-those of imperial and state rank-enjoyed higher status than "civil shrines" (minsha) (p. 86; perhaps "popular" is a better translation?). With "the whole population . . . ordered to worship the kami" (pp. 31-32), Shinto and its priests had at last moved-or returned- from periphery to sacred center. This momentary success, however, soon revealed that they had brought the periphery with them. As Hardacre shows in chapter 3, the priesthood was an insular and disparate group, with a small but fractious administra- tive elite and a great many poorly educated and trained members. One does not come away from this book impressed with their intellectual acumen. The failure of the Great Promulgation Campaign (1870-84) to establish Shinto as a genuinely national and popular form of worship (explored in chapter 2) points up the inherent ambiguities of the invented tradition it- self. Spurred by anti-Buddhist feeling and by the growth of so-called New Religions, many priests, especially adherents of Okuni-school kokugaku, envisioned a pastoral and doctrinal role for Shinto. This was to include the performance of Shinto funeral rites. Others, particularly followers of Hirata-school kokugaku, insisted that Shint6 was best seen as a national liturgy, one that required priests and shrines for its proper performance. In the event, it was the latter vision that won out, though at a price. As Hardacre notes, these internecine conflicts marred "the state's ideo- logical self-presentation" (p. 49) and cost Shinto important official sup- port. One positive result of this misfortune was that the priesthood was fi- 207</page><page sequence="4">Journal of Japanese Studies nally forced to organize itself into a national body. More importantly, the lines of the now emergent State Shinto became clear. After 1890, "the priesthood enlarged and codified shrine rites and promoted the notion that shrine rites"-the worship of the kami-"were essential to personal and political life" (p. 77). This was a crucial point, one with far-reaching consequences. Shinto, its representatives argued, was not like Buddhism or Christianity; it was not a "religion" and could not be defined or circumscribed by Buddhist or Western, especially Protestant, notions that stressed (private) belief and behavior. As a National Rite (kokka no soshi), Shinto provided symbolic legitimation to the imperial state via a non-religious link to the sacred. Par- ticipation in shrine rites, therefore, was defined as "patriotic duty" that happened to require the mediation of a priest; it was also "customary" and therefore not to be disturbed by the exercise of "private" religious belief. (This latter right was guaranteed under Article 28 of the Meiji constitu- tion, so long as its "manifestations [were] confined to the mind" [p. 119]). Hardacre discusses (all too briefly) the notorious lese-majeste cases involv- ing Kume Kunitake and Uchimura Kanzo to illustrate the coercive nature of sanctioned "custom" (pp. 123-24, 129). As she aptly remarks, the ar- gument that Shint6 was not a religion-that it even "transcended" reli- gion-was little more than "casuistry" (p. 118). Somehow it is not surpris- ing to find that Shinto priests supported and took advantage of official persecution of so-called "pseudo-religions" such as Omotokyo, not in the name of true religion but of true patriotism. The slippage between religion, custom, and civil obligation was equally evident in education. Not only were many Shinto priests automat- ically qualified to teach in the primary schools, they also distributed "texts teaching principals how to make ceremonial readings of the Imperial Re- script on Education" (p. 109). Even without priests, of course, the Rescript and Imperial Portraits were treated as sacred objects according to precise rules laid down for shrine worship.2 Hardacre leaves little doubt that the priesthood of itself was incapable of winning popular acceptance for State Shinto. The evidence points to widespread resistance to calendrical reform, shrine mergers, and even flag displays continuing into the twentieth century (p. 33). There were, Hard- acre suggests, two crucial factors in changing this state of affairs. First was Japan's success in its wars against China and Russia. The cult of the war dead allowed the state to tap "Japan's oldest and most affectively laden area of religious life, the cult of the dead and the ancestors" (p. 161, emphasis 2. On this piont see also Atsuko Hirai, "The State and Ideology in Meiji Japan: A Re- view Article," Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 46, No. 1 (February 1987), esp. p. 9. 208</page><page sequence="5">Review Section added). Thus the years after 1905 saw an aggressive campaign to promote what Hardacre calls the "rites of empire," in which the Yasukuni and local "guardian" shrines played the central role. But inseparable from this campaign was obviously the prior transfor- mation of the emperor Meiji into his people's living patriarch and (as At- suko Hirai puts it), "Japan's modern Mars."3 Hardacre makes much of the completion in 1920 of the Meiji Shrine, emphasizing that it was an "un- precedented" national effort in which the populace, out of love and respect for the departed emperor, was energetically involved (pp. 38, 93-94). In- deed she places the Meiji Shrine alongside Ise and Yasukuni as pillars of State Shinto. Nowhere, however, does she describe, explain, or analyze Meiji's metamorphosis into an object of popular affection and worship, let alone Shinto's role in promoting it. This, she says, would involve the dis- cussion of "state" as opposed to "shrine" rites (p. 80); Hardacre distin- guishes these in order to justify her focus on the latter. But it is a hard distinction to accept. Not only does she herself make an exception of the promotion by the priesthood of the Education Rescript, and thereby weaken the argument; the whole edifice of State Shinto rested on the claim that it was not religious but patriotic in nature. And since the imperial cult formed the very core of its worship, it seems bizarrely formalistic to ig- nore the modern transformation of its central figure into a national pater- familias. Could not Hardacre have looked at the rites attending the pro- mulgation of the constitution, or, more to the point, the imperial funeral of 1912? What other event could call forth the combination of religious vener- ation and patriotic emotion that defined State Shinto?4 Yet these events are hardly mentioned. Indeed in Hardacre's account the emperor functions as an "absent present," significant but silent. But for whose sake, if not his, did the "glorious heroes" enshrined at Yasukuni meet their deaths? Speaking of deaths: Hardacre has also made a deliberate decision to underplay the "thoroughly debated" events of 1930 to 1945 (p. 8), so as to give greater attention to previously neglected areas. This is well and good. But it does undercut the sense of alarm she evinces in her final chapter on postwar attempts to revive State Shinto. All the elements of State Shinto- coercive, affective, and political-were undoubtedly present by the Taisho period. But Hardacre is clearly responding to postwar problems in terms of the extreme forms to which State Shinto was taken after 1930; she is view- ing it through the prism of Japan's defeat and its historical meaning. It is ironic, therefore, that she omits serious consideration of this period, par- ticularly of the "Shintoization" of colonial populations. 3. Hirai, "State and Ideology," p. 93. 4.

It is certainly the most impassioned. There is, in fact, an interesting difference in tone and focus between the pre- and post- war chapters. In the former, the multiple identities and ambiguities of Shinto are conveyed with great cogency. The term "state," on the other hand, tends to be used in blanket, almost anthropomorphic, fashion. (Cf. p. 106, where "the state" digs up the grave of Mori Arinori's assassin.) It is as if the "center" were unproblematic, while the "periphery" was not. Yet that cannot have been the case: tradition had to be invented in part be- cause the center-the author of Japan's modernity-was problematic in and of itself. In the postwar chapter, by contrast, the state assumes a more specific character. Hardacre deals concretely and pointedly with legal in- stitutions, the Diet and political parties, various ministries, the Self De- fense Forces, and so on, in addition to bodies such as the Society of the Bereaved (Nihon Izoku Kai). The emphasis has clearly shifted away from the priesthood. Nor is this surprising. Thoroughly discredited by defeat and stripped of state support under the new constitution, postwar Shinto is showing un- mistakable signs of "decay." Rural shrines steadily lose potential parish- ioners to the cities. In urban settings, parish life is seen as undemocratic and particularly unresponsive to the "religious aspirations of women." The priesthood, as ever, has been "feeble and ineffectual" in responding to such challenges. Converting shrines into wedding halls may be econom- ically necessary, but it helps little to dispel "society's image of Shinto as ethically and intellectually bankrupt" (pp. 142-43). This is in striking contrast, not to a declining established Buddhism, but to the New Religions. Precisely because Shinto's social roots have become so desiccated, Hardacre asserts, official efforts to reconstruct State Shinto are likely to continue. This is more than a matter of conservatives attempting to cover political failure with nationalism. It speaks directly to the problem of political legitimation in Japan. Although the country now possesses an "open, pluralistic political culture" (p. 145), Hardacre notes, "the desire of governments to seek religious legitimation" in Shinto "operates at all levels of politics" (p. 162). Hardacre points to repeated (though unsuc- cessful) attempts by LDP cabinets and the lower house to pass a bill allow- ing the state to support the Yasukuni Shrine, and to supreme court deci- sions that allowed the city of Tsu to pay for grounds purification by a priest and that later supported the right of the SDF to apotheosize a dead member over the wishes of his Christian widow. Once linked to the state, therefore, Shinto has come to depend on "the element of coercion" (p. 163) and legalistic casuistry to survive. There can be no "reinvention" of a premodern-style, "popular" Shinto. Though it is 210</page><page sequence="7">Review Section beyond the scope of her work, Hardacre's conclusion implicitly raises a question of considerable moment: if Shinto has in fact become inescapably associated with a coerced political and social consensus, what are the spiri- tual and intellectual foundations of Japanese democracy? Gedatsu-kai and Religion in Contemporary Japan: Returning to the Cen- ter. By H. Byron Earhart. Indiana University Press, Bloomington, 1989. xviii, 280 pages. $57.50. Reviewed by HELEN HARDACRE Griffith University Byron Earhart's Gedatsu-kai and Religion in Contemporary Japan is a wel- come addition to scholarship on the new religions of Japan, albeit one diffi- cult to endorse enthusiastically. Inasmuch as the new religions represent between one-fourth and one-third of the entire population of Japan, eth- nographic documentation of their membership and activities, doctrines, ritual, and history contributes to knowledge of a poorly understood aspect of Japanese society and is always to be applauded. Gedatsukai is one of a small number of Buddhist new religions derived from the esoteric schools of Buddhism, principally represented in Japan by the Tendai and Shingon schools, and this book is the first substantial Western-language study of a new religion originating in this tradition. Gedatsukai also incorporates ele- ments originating in Shinto, the folk tradition, and the cult of sacred moun- tains. As of 1983, it had about 227,000 members. The book treats the founder's life and group history, its present-day organization, membership and activities, its branch meetings, doctrines, and ritual. Questionnaire data and members' testimonies are analyzed in detail. This study results from a collaboration between Earhart, a formidable pioneer in the United States in the field of the study of the Japanese new religions, and a team of Japanese colleagues headed by Miyake Hitoshi, a premier scholar of the mountain cult Shugendo, and his postgraduate stu- dents. Previously Earhart has compiled a comprehensive bibliography of Western-language works on the Japanese new religions and a number of articles on the general phenomenon of new religions in Japan. The present work is his first book entirely devoted to the study of a single new religion. In this work Earhart shows clearly how much can be accomplished by the collaborative research designs favored by Japanese scholars but far beyond 211</page></plain_text>
