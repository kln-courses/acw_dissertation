THE PRAGMATICS OF INDIRECT SPEECH IN OLD CHURCH SLAVONIC AND OTHER EARLY SLAVIC WRITINGS DANIEL E. COLLINS How, in fact, is another speaker's speech re- ceived? What we have in the forms of report- ed speech is precisely an objective document of this reception. Once we have learned to decipher it, this document provides us with information... about steadfast social tenden- cies in an active reception of other speakers' speech, tendencies that have crystallized into language forms (Volosinov [1929] 1986: 117). 1. Introduction As Volosinov points out in these words from his classic study of verbal interaction, the act of reporting discourse is not a purely mechan- ical transmission of the form and/or content of some prototype utter- ance, real or imaginary; it is a context-sensitive expression of authorial purpose. Rather than being repeated in an unintentional, parrot-like manner, reported messages are incorporated into new contexts and, eo ipso, subordinated functionally to the communicative needs of the au- thors of those contexts (see especially Bachtin [1929] 1971: 177-78; Sternberg 1982b, 1991). Thus any instance of reported speech is an in- herently dual-voiced phenomenon, reflecting not only the locutionary act of the represented speaker but also, and more importantly, the illo- cutionary goals of the reporter. Cross-linguistically, there is considerable diversity in the techniques available for framing reported speech.1 Every language offers some choice of strategies, and the repertory of formal possibilities within a single language can be quite large. Certain patterns are typologically widespread, among them the choice between direct and indirect dis-</page><page sequence="2">22 course. It is important to recognize that the various modes of reporting are not functionally equivalent, as a rule, even when they appear to be synonymous as far as propositional content is concerned. While they all make reference to the occurrence of a speech act, each one convention- ally emphasizes a different aspect of the represented event. In other words, each one has a different perspective on the "scene of linguistic action" (Dirven et al. 1982). Each one "'hears' a message differently; it actively receives and brings to bear in transmission different factors, different aspects of the message than do the other patterns" (Volosinov [1929] 1986: 129). Consequently, the reporter's act of selecting the mode of reporting appropriate in a given context is one of the chief ways in which he can accomplish his communicative goals. The choice is informed by the reporter's pragmatic competence both as speaker and as interpreter, i.e., his knowledge of "the steadfast social tenden- cies in an active reception of other speakers' speech". Several recent studies with pragmatic, sociolinguistic, and anthropo- logical-linguistic orientations have revived and given further legitimacy to the idea that variation in reporting techniques can be adequately un- derstood only as a purposive and context-sensitive phenomenon.2 For example, Philips (1985: 168), who examines the contextualization of re- porting methods in a contemporary American trial, concludes that "dif- ferent ways of framing reported speech cue listeners that such reported speech has different functions or meanings in the discourse, and is to be interpreted variably". It is clear that, at each stage in which report- ers choose between alternative ways of framing their reports, they are cast in the role of interpreters as well as authors. They make their de- cisions based on their perceptions of the needs of the speech situation, including their own communicative goals (their "speech will") as a priv- ileged factor. Therefore, the only way to gain a true understanding of the pragmatics or - in all but in a trivial sense - the syntax of report- ed speech is to deduce those features of the context that would be promoted by the formal properties of the reporting strategy selected. These features are part of what the original reporter intended to con- vey and, concomitantly, part of what the intended interpreter needed to recognize in order to understand the report in its full expressiveness. Like any pragmatically oriented treatment of premodern discourse, the study of reported speech poses an interesting problem when the language being analyzed is known only from written artifacts, in which the only observables are the words themselves, without any supplement from independent native speaker testimony or (for what it is worth) in-</page><page sequence="3">23 trospection. Particularly interesting, in this regard, are Old Church Sla- vonic, in which the surviving texts consist almost entirely of transla- tions, and the earliest South and East Slavic vernaculars, which were profoundly influenced by such translations. However, the existing works that deal, to any extent, with represented speech in the earliest Slavic writings (see below) focus almost entirely on formal features and pay little attention to the issues of function and contextualization. In fact, they tend to overlook the fact that a repertory of strategies was avail- able and to present speech reporting as if it were monolithic or, at best, dichotomistic, with one half of the dichotomy (indirect discourse) in- completely developed in the languages in question. The observable vari- ation in reporting techniques is treated, if at all, as if it were a reflec- tion of diachronic competition between synonymous categories (with direct speech being more "basic" or "primitive" than the other varieties) rather than as an intentional selection of functionally distinct strategies. In this paper I will examine the contextualization of one particular reporting mode in the earliest Slavic writings - indirect speech, a tech- nique that is especially interesting in that its very existence in OCS and early East Slavic has been doubted or denied. My material comes pri- marily from OCS and, in large part, from the Gospels, as attested in the Codex Marianus.3 I also use certain translations of somewhat later attestation, as well as original East Slavic texts of the Kievan period. I should state up front that I consider the general issue of Greek interfe- rence to be moot, since we have no South or East Slavic texts that could conceivably be free of possible contamination, whether directly via translation or indirectly via the use of the canonical texts as models. In reconstructing the pragmatics of translations, one is potentially also reconstructing the pragmatics of the originals; however, this should scarcely be viewed as a danger. In principle, at least, one may assume that translators who are relatively faithful to the originals and who share the ideological standpoint of the authors will endeavor to animate the position of those authors; accordingly, unless they fail to under- stand their work, they will share those authors' expressive or general communicative goals, at least in part, and will try to achieve them in their own medium as much as they are able. Moreover, the various meth- ods of reporting speech that occur in the earliest texts exhibit formal features that must have been processed in some way by their Slavic in- terpreters, including the authors of original texts; this pragmatic com- petence, at least, can be investigated. The methodology to be used in doing this is to track the patterns of</page><page sequence="4">24 speech reporting not eclectically but over entire texts or corpora of texts, and not in isolation but in their larger context. When a given strategy is found to recur in specific contexts, one may infer that some or all of its formal properties suited the communicative needs of the authors and/or translators in those contexts, while the features of other reporting modes did not. This allows one to match form to function. It is especially important to examine seeming counterexamples, in which other reporting methods were used instead of the predicted one, in or- der to establish whether there is true functional overlap; however, in many cases it turns out that the contexts in which these nonconforming examples occur actually manifest certain special features that justify the use of the unexpected technique. The norms established in this manner are the "stabilized constructional patterns", the "basic and constant tendencies in the active reception of other speakers' speech [author's emphasis]" that Volosinov [1929] 1986: 116-17) rightly considers to be the chief object in the study of reported speech. If this method seems to entail a great deal of attention to apparently trivial features of con- text, it is because I do not think that context is trivial. In undertaking a pragmatic analysis of reported speech, we must try as much as possi- ble to reconstruct the interpretive framework of the reporter and the intended hearer or reader - that is, to progress from the outsider's "etic" perspective to the insider's "ernie" one (to gain "a more fully contextual understanding"; Becker 1984: 425). As Becker observes, the study of discourse - "unlike the study of syntax - is of necessity the study of particularity" (ibid.: 435; cf. also Becker 1988; and Tannen 1989: 34-36). 2. Previous studies of indirect speech in the earliest Slavic texts Considering the typological importance of indirect discourse, it has been surprisingly little discussed in linguistic investigations of the earliest Slavic writings. The very topic of indirect reports of declarative speech acts falls outside the purview of many of the standard OCS handbooks, including some that treat the syntax of the texts.4 Generally speaking, most of the studies that do deal with OCS indirect speech to any extent discuss it in only a few sentences under the rubric of subor- dinated direct-object clauses - in particular, constructions with the complementizer jako.5 Accordingly, they are concerned with the formal structure of indirect reporting rather than with its function. Indirect re- ports of questions and commands, which are traditionally discussed un-</page><page sequence="5">25 der separate rubrics because of the influence of classical grammar, re- ceive somewhat more attention, although again exclusively from the standpoint of form.6 On the whole, the available treatments offer an unenlightening and, at times, confusing picture of indirect speech in OCS. To begin with, there is no consensus on the fundamental issue of whether indirect speech - understood in the sense of reports of declarative speech acts - actually exists in the OCS codices; nor is there agreement on the question of whether it was native to the South Slavic vernaculars at the onset of literacy. While some investigators, e.g., Lunt (19746: 144), re- fer to indirect speech in the earliest Slavic texts, others deny its exi- stence, except perhaps in a rudimentary form. For example, Chabur- gaev (1974: 426) asserts that "staroslavjanskie teksty ne dajut dostover- nych primerov kosvennoj reci [author's emphasis], na osnovanii cego mozno predpolagat', cto bolee sloznaja (po sravneniju s prjamoj) kos- vennaja ree' v X-XI w. v jazyke slavjan esce ne oformilas', chotja èle- menty ètogo sposoba peredaci cuzoj reci v staroslavjanskich pamjatni- kach nachodjat otrazenie...". Matveeva-Isaeva (1958: 182) likewise posits that indirect speech was inchoate in OCS, if it existed at all: "V staro- slavjanskom jazyke ne differencirovany do konca imejusciesja v sovre- mennych slavjanskich jazykach dva sposoba peredaci cuzoj reci: prja- maja i kosvennaja ree'". These claims have two main rationales. First, direct speech is statistically predominant in the OCS texts. Second, ca- ses of direct speech complementized by the so-called jako recitativum are widespread7 in the earliest Slavic writings - e.g., the two reports in the following excerpt: (1) I e^HNH KT^CTdKT^We /tTOK^ C'hK'fyyfcTe/thCTKOKddX'* Nd NK ™ìlJT6- 'fcKO AtT^I C^^IUJdXOA^I-H T/TlnUlJTh- ^KO á3*K pü30p»Ä l|pKKb CHHK P^KOTKOpeN/fthift • I TpbAAH ^bNh/VAH HNÄ Nep^KOTBOpeN/ft CT^HW^/ft (Mark 14: 57-58 in the Codex Marianus; Jagic (ed.) [1883] 1960: 177). Chaburgaev and Matveeva-Isaeva, among other investigators (see be- low), view this combination of a complementizer, which is usually asso- ciated with indirect speech in the modern Slavic and Western European languages, with the purportedly "simplest" and "most basic" mode of reporting, direct speech, to be indirect discourse in ovo. It is notewor- thy that both authors consider reported speech even as it exists in, say, Modern Russian to be a dichotomy rather than a continuum of tech- niques.8 Moreover, they both regard this putatively binary division as</page><page sequence="6">26 the telos of the supposed development in the earlier stages of the Slavic languages. Chaburgaev, in particular, asserts that the direction of the drift was toward the greater complexity that he views as a categorial feature of indirect speech. A third set of investigators seem to take the presence of comple- mentized reports in OCS as a sufficient condition for indirect speech in the absence of deictic forms oriented toward the participants of the ac- tual or represented speech situation. Thus Gamanovic ([1964] 1991: 251), who treats the jako recitativum construction as slipping from in- direct to direct speech ("cuzaja ree' casto nacinaetsja sojuzom jako, t.e. kosvennoj, a prodolzaetsja, kak prjamaja..."), states that reports com- plementized by jako are indirect speech as long as they would not in- volve any shifts of perspective if converted into direct speech: "sobst- venno kosvennaja ree' vyderzivaetsja tol'ko togda, kogda ona peredaet ree' o 3-m lice (ili predmete)... Esli sojuz jako ubrat', kosvennaja ree', perechodja v prjamuju, ne menjaetsja" (ibid.). If this were true, it would imply, for example, that the following passage from the Codex Mari- anus is indirect speech: (2) l e^HH^AATs r/ÏÏftllJT6Ath 0 l^pKKH- ^KO K4/M6NH6/Mb ^OBpO/Uh H rKC/fyVki OYKpaweNd errh- pene... (Luke 21: 5; Jagic (ed.) [1883] 1960: 293). In practice this is also the position of Mutalimova (1984), the author of an article devoted to reported speech in OCS (in particular, in the Codex Suprasliensis and the noncanonical Dobromirovo Evangelie), even though in principle she makes reference to the role of the deictic pivot in determining indirect discourse (ibid.: 94-95): "[V kosvennoj reci] cuzie slova podvergajutsja suscestvennym struktur- nym i stilisticeskim izmenenijam. V predlozenijach s kosvennoj rec'ju slova adresanta oformljajutsja kak glavnoe predlozenie, a cuzie - kak pridatocnoe. Svjaz' mezdu castjami sloznogo predlozenija osuscestvlja- etsja posredstvom podcinitel'nych sojuzov... V otlicie ot konstrukcij s prjamoj rec'ju, v ètich cuzie slova javljajutsja zavisimoj cast'ju i sluzat v kacestve ob"ekta pri skazuemom v glavnom predlozenii. V nich nevoz- mozny obrascenija, menjaetsja forma lica i glagola. Vse èto svide- tel'stvuet o tom, cto ree' odnogo iz personazej prelomljaetsja cerez vos- prijatie drugogo, vosproizvoditsja im s razlicnymi izmenenijami v zavisi- mosti ot togo, kakie stilisticeskie celi stavit pered soboj avtor povestvo- vanija."9</page><page sequence="7">27 While Mutalimova cites a number of cases of complementized report- ed speech, none of them could involve a shift in deixis, either because the reports contain no deictic expressions coreferential with the actual or represented speech situation or because they are tagged by first-per- son nonpast verba dicendi and represent quasi-performative emphatic frames of the "Verily, verily, I say unto you" variety, in which the re- presented and actual speech situations are identical.10 Thus, given that there is no way to determine whether the reports differ in style from their models (a weak diagnostic, in any event), the only, feature that could distinguish them as indirect speech, as Mutalimova defines it, would be the complementizer jako - a problematic criterion, given that the author also allows for the existence of complementized direct speech, i.e., for jako recitativum as a separate mode (ibid.). Subse- quently Mutalimova acknowledges that, in her view, indirect speech does not always imply any "transformation": "v odnich slucajach [kom- ponenty v cuzich slovach] upotrebljajutsja bez izmenenija form lica i glagola, t.e. tak, kak oni upotrebljajutsja pri prjamoj reci" (ibid.: 95). Hence, for Mutalimova, the only hard-and-fast distinction between di- rect and indirect speech would seem to be the impossibility of ad- dress-forms ("nevozmoznost' upotreblenija obrascenij"; ibid.) in the lat- ter - a feature that has little to do with the essence of either mode of reporting. As I have pointed out in an earlier work (Collins 1994), most studies of reported speech in early East Slavic texts likewise pay little attention to the functions of indirect discourse; instead, they focus on the puta- tive evolution of its form, about which, generally speaking, they make untenable assumptions. As was the case with OCS, there is some skep- ticism about whether indirect speech had actually developed by the time of the earliest Rus'ian writings. In a number of investigations, indirect speech is presented, without reference to its contextualization, as if it were a late and stylistically elevated phenomenon that gradually expan- ded, for no apparent reason, at the expense of direct discourse.11 This supposition is based, again, primarily on the fact that clear-cut indirect speech occurs infrequently in the oldest East Slavic texts (both translat- ed and original), while direct speech complementized by the jako reci- tativum or by other relative words such as eie, oze, aze is quite com- mon.12 As mentioned above, it is often assumed that the use of an ex- plicit subordinator is one of the features that distinguish full-fledged in- direct and direct speech. Accordingly, a number of scholars have inter- preted these cases of complementized direct speech as reflections of a</page><page sequence="8">28 transitional stage in what they see as the evolution of the indirect- speech construction (cf. Chaburgaev and Matveeva-Isaeva's treatment of the jako recitativum in OCS). In addition, some authors view instances of slipping from indirect into direct speech and vice versa - switches from one mode of reporting to another without any intervening tagging device (a phenomenon also attested in OCS) - as an error or syntactic contamination caused specifically by medieval writers' lack of familiarity with and inability to control the putatively more complex form of indi- rect discourse.13 Thus indirect speech in both OCS and early East Slavic tends to be treated as a relatively complex and literary construction functionally synonymous with the supposedly more natural form of direct speech, rather than as an alternative mode of reporting with a different expres- sive force. When mentioned at all, its coexistence with direct discourse in the earliest texts is usually explained as synchronie dynamism - hy- potactic indirect speech evolving from and impinging on paratactic di- rect speech; it has not been viewed as a context-sensitive use of func- tionally distinct strategies, comparable to the alternation between the various noncompeting modes of reporting in the modern Slavic lan- guages. Even Volosinov ([1929] 1986: 119-20), who was the first to de- monstrate that the modern Russian modes of reporting are context-sen- sitive, concludes, albeit tentatively, that "the pattern of indirect dis- course is almost completely lacking". His explanation for this differs from those of other investigators in that it appeals speculatively to the development of social institutions rather than to the putative evolution of subordinating syntax; however, it shares their fundamental flaw in arguing e silentio and in paying no attention to the role of contexts: "If, at some given stage in its development, a language habitually per- ceives another's utterance as a compact, indivisible, fixed, impenetrable whole, then that language will command no other pattern than that of primitive, inert direct discourse (the monumental style)" (ibid.: 128; see also ibid.: 120, 123). The circularity of this reasoning is evident; we can only identify the factor causing the predominance of direct speech - that a language "habitually perceives another's utterance as a compact, indivisible, fixed, impenetrable whole" - on the basis of that predomi- nance. What Volosinov and the other investigators fail to consider is that they are grounding their generalizations on eclectic data rather than on a systematic study of a range of contexts. They draw their conclusions without considering what kinds of contexts are most preva- lent in the writings from which they draw their evidence - typically,</page><page sequence="9">29 third-person narratives that have a covert or effaced narrator and fea- ture scattered snippets of foregrounded reported speech rather than, say, reports used as background information or as echoes in sustained passages of dialogue. Investigation of particular contexts would have revealed cases of well-motivated indirect speech in Slavic texts from the earliest period onwards. There are certainly pronounced differences in how the reporting modes are distributed over text kinds, as might be expected with a context-sensitive phenomenon; however, even the few studies that do examine the usage in particular text kinds generally re- strict themselves to affirming the coexistence of reporting techniques without attempting to explain their contextualizations. 3. Categorial properties of indirect speech Before discussing indirect speech in the earliest Slavic texts, it is nec- essary to define the category, given that certain phenomena have been treated erroneously under that rubric in previous research. From a ty- pological standpoint, the sole universal of indirect discourse is that deictic expressions are - or, in the case of adverbiais, tend to be - transparent, that is, oriented not toward the reference points of the original speech situation,14 as in direct discourse, but toward those of the renarration or authorial context.15 Hence they reflect the external perspective of their reporter rather than the internal viewpoint of the speaker to whom they are ascribed.16 This implies, in particular, that first- and second-person elements in direct quotations will correspond to third-person elements in indirect quotations unless they are coreferen- tial with the speaker or addressee of the frame in which the report is inset (embedded). Elements that are coreferential with the speaker of the frame will be in the first person in indirect speech, and elements coreferential with the addressee will be in the second person, regardless of which person they would be in a direct quotation, i.e., if the deixis of the report had the same reference points as in the represented speech situation. Cross-linguistically, the use of transparent (reporter- oriented) reference in indirect speech occurs most regularly with pro- nouns and verb forms with subject-agreement; it can also affect tempo- ral and spatial deictics, although here it tends to be less consistent (to- morrow &gt; on the following day, here &gt; there, this &gt; that, etc.).17 While indirect speech can have other, language-specific character- istics, this referential strategy is the essence of the category; indeed, as Li observes (1985: 32), it is "often the only diagnostic criterion avail-</page><page sequence="10">30 able in many languages for distinguishing a direct quote from an indi- rect quote out of discourse context". It is, indeed, the sole feature that can be considered a meaningful diagnostic for indirect discourse in the Slavic languages up to the present day. By contrast, features like con- secutio temporum (backshifting of tenses) and the shift from indicative to nonindicative modality, which occur, in various concatenations, in Ancient Greek, Latin, and the modern Western European languages, inter alia, are by no means universal. To be sure, phenomena of this kind crop up occasionally in Slavic texts of various periods, e.g., in the following Old Testament passage: (3) RHA'tKUJM we ermiTANe &gt;k6n8 ero, raKO ^OKpa KAiue s'k/to (Gene- sis 12: 14; HM.SMS.279, 12v2-3). Here the use of the imperfect tense (ß/Mue) in the complement clause is clearly relative to the time frame of the narrative rather than the represented speech situation.18 However, sporadic occurrences not- withstanding, sequence-of-tense rules have never been a regular charac- teristic of indirect reports in the Slavic languages.19 More controversial, it would seem, is the extent to which explicit subordination marking should count as an obligatory feature of indirect speech in the oldest attested stages of the Slavic languages. There are several reasons to doubt that this was the case. First, the possibility of free indirect discourse (style indirect libre, Erlebte Rede) shows that subordination is not a necessary property of indirect reporting per se. Second, the use of a complementizer is by no means a universal cha- racteristic of even the tagged form of indirect discourse, although it is typologically widespread.20 Third, as is well known, in many languages, an uncomplementized variety of tagged indirect speech coexists with the complementized one. This mode of reporting may be attested in the OCS canon (see the discussion of excerpt (18), below). The comple- mentizing conjunction is also optional with tagged indirect speech in Old Russian of the Muscovite period, as in the modern Slavic lang- uages, at least on the surface level; its use evidently depends on stylistic and other pragmatic factors.21 Syntactic theory has elaborated mecha- nisms for deriving cases of uncomplementized indirect speech from un- derlying constructions with explicitly expressed subordination. However, one may question whether it is really necessary to posit that tagged in- direct speech must be complementized in a universal grammar. A fourth and more telling reason why the occurrence of explicit subordination marking cannot be regarded as either a necessary or a</page><page sequence="11">31 sufficient diagnostic of indirect reporting is the cross-linguistically widespread phenomenon of complementized direct speech. Reports of this kind occur frequently, for instance, in colloquial modern Russian (see Peskovskij 1956: 485), even though the subordinating conjunction is absent in what may be termed the prototypical or "canonical" form (cf. Roncador 1988) of tagged direct speech.22 To those who would exclude the complementized examples from analysis because they are putatively "ungrammatical", one can only reply, "E pur si muove". The fact that cases of this kind do not seem to be syntactically well-formed is beside the point; they are a phenomenon of discourse, of text at large, and cannot be explained away as syntactic "contaminations". The presence or absence of the complementizer is equally nonproba- tive in Old Russian of the Muscovite era, as the following examples show: (4) M o6om MCTUbi CKa3ajiM: TaKOB HaM, rocnoAHHe, cya 6biJi, KaK b ceM cnHCKy nucaHO (Podpisnoj sudnyj spisok of 1498/1499, in a copy of the seventeenth century; Grekov and Cerepnin (eds.) 1952-1964, vol. 2: 453, no. 418).

These representative passages, drawn from fifteenth- and early-six- teenth-century trial transcripts (see Collins 1994), illustrate the same le- gal formula framed in four different ways. Direct speech appears in ex- cerpts (4) and (5) - in the second instance, preceded by the comple- mentizer cto; the first-person pronoun of the report is coreferential with the subject of the narrative introductory clause (o6oh HCijbi). Ex- cerpts (6) and (7) exemplify complementized and uncomplementized in- direct speech, respectively; here the pronoun in the report appears in</page><page sequence="12">32 the third person, just like the preferential pronoun in the authorial narration.23 According to Munro (1982: 303), the fact that similar di- rect vs. indirect contrasts can occur in many languages, whether or not a complementizer is present, implies that subordination marking cannot be considered "the best universal correlate of the distinction". Instead, Munro privileges "transparency of pronominal reference" (ibid.), the characteristic of indirect speech that is preferred in this paper, as against the opacity of pronominal reference in direct speech. Finally, the use of a complementizer cannot be regarded as constitu- tive of the distinction between direct and indirect speech for the simple reason that, cross-linguistically, both of these modes of reporting can be realized in syntactic positions other than that of object complement; ' hence their co-occurrence with the marker of one particular kind of syntactic relation is beside the point.24 For instance, in medieval Russian documents, reports framed as indirect speech tagged with the citation particle dë(i), a grammaticalized verbum dicendi, can occur as the sole propositional content of topicalizing clauses: (8) TdKwe ecA'h h* noradAOKd'*, hto a6H n$ Ttb* n$ H* xPeCTbraH no MdNdrrtjpcKHX K B'fcwHijKHH Repxi* npHea^/N^ npncTdKHe a'oh, K6/'HK0r(ô) KN(A)3ra, ^d NdA'eTTKIKdWTr ^6H Nd NH* CpOKH CHANO K A'fe/tOKoe Kpe/VAA... (Zalovannaja tarchannaja i nesudimaja gramota of May 17, 1462; Grekov and Cerepnin (eds.) 1952-1964, vol. 1: 215, no. 304). In this passage, the cto clause that contains the indirect speech (cf. the third-person pronouns ich, na nich, which are coreferential with the pronoun ich in the preceding narrative sentence) cannot be treated as a complement of the verb pozalovati 'grant a boon', which takes a direct object referring to the beneficiary; its function is to introduce back- ground information relevant to the subsequent dispositions. It is the content of the reported message that is asserted in this passage, not the fact that such a speech act occurred.25 Similarly reportive causal and relative clauses may be found in Old Russian texts, and the general pattern may be found in many other languages.26 Traditionally, the more straightforward or prototypical kind of re- ported speech introduced by a preposed verbum dicendi has been treated as the direct object of that verb.27 However, Partee (1973) demonstrates that this approach cannot adequately account for the syntactic behavior of direct-speech insets, at least, while Munro (1982) concludes, on the basis of considerable typological evidence, that verbs of saying in general</page><page sequence="13">33 tend to behave as intransitives and that the reports that they introduce differ from ordinary object clauses (see also Li 1986: 34-37; Haiman and Thompson 1984: 519-20). It seems particularly doubtful that reports featuring intercalated and postposed verba dicendi - e.g., the direct- speech paraphrases from the thirteenth-century Middle Bulgarian Bo- logna Psalter in excerpts (9) and (10) - should be regarded as objects of the given verbs, that is, as syntactically subordinate to the authorial context (see also excerpt (47), below).28 (9) ^HraKOrtT* pene &amp;&amp; Ne xK&lt;MHTrk CA Nd ma- A° KONi^a oy^OK/t^RdA MH (Commentary to Psalm 12 [13]: 4; Dujcev (ed.) 1968: 31, fol. 16bl4-16). (10) A^^A^ 'MM Rp-feAtA noKaraNHra pene (Commentary to Psalm 118 [119]: 122; ibid.: 406, fol. 202d21-22). Unlike other deviations from neutral word-order patterns, the dis- placement of the putative matrix verb, i.e., the tagging device, cannot be explained as a rhematization of new information.29 Rather, the verbs of saying evidently function as parenthetical quotation markers (cf. Kieckers 1920; Urmsson 1952; Shapiro 1984: 73-77) that do not inter- fere with the information structure of the message that is actually being asserted, i.e., the reported speech.30 Likewise, according to Li (1986: 35), the reports tagged by postposed verba dicendi in the following sentences do not seem to "play the role of the direct object or patient of the verb of saying": (11) "'I don't want to play tennis', John said". (12) "He didn't want to play tennis, John said". Li concludes that, "[s]ince the semantic function of 'say' tends to lean in the direction of a hearsay evidential or an epistemic quantifier, the new information translated by [such] sentences... rests in the quoted speech, whether it is direct or indirect" (ibid.). In sum, it is evident that, from a typological standpoint, there is no properly syntactic difference between the categories of direct and indi- rect speech, notwithstanding how their prototypical forms may be con- stituted in a given language. The use of explicit subordination marking cannot be regarded as a universal feature of indirect discourse; nor can it be treated as constitutive of the category in languages that permit complementized direct and uncomplementized indirect reports. It is not the use of a complementizer or even the presence of a tag clause that</page><page sequence="14">34 defines indirect speech; it is the localization of the deictic pivot in the perspective of the reporter. Hence the chief feature that distinguishes direct and indirect speech belongs to the level of discourse rather than to that of sentence or clause (see also Collins 1994: 26-33). 4. Indeterminate forms of reported speech The definition of indirect speech established above has two impor- tant ramifications. First, complementized direct discourse, including the jako recitativum construction, should not be considered a precursor or primitive form of indirect speech just because it features explicit subor- dination marking.31 It is a phenomenon of a different type, in that it does not exhibit the only feature of indirect discourse that can be con- sidered determinative from a typological standpoint - the shift of deic- tic orientation; it provides no evidence for the development of indirect- ness. While a full treatment of the phenomenon is beyond the scope of this study, it is apparent that the jako recitativum may be viewed as the result of a general tendency to make textual relations explicit, much like the use of sentence-initial relatives in Latin (e.g., "Caesar statuii exspectandam ciassem, quae ubi convenit..."; Lakoff 1984: 488; see ibid.: passim). In this light, the use of the jako recitativum and similar complementizers with direct speech may be linked with syntactic pleo- nasms such as eie with the infinitive (an imitation of Greek; see Uspenskij 1987: 174-75) and redundant conjunctions such as jako da (see Korotaeva 1958: 69-70; Preobrazenskaja 1973: 288-89; and Ste- cenko 1977: 263).32 At any rate, the jako recitativum cannot be ex- plained with any certainty as a purely organic development, since it is parallel to and perhaps an imitation of the koine Greek hoti or hös re- citativum - a fact overlooked by the authors who regard the given construction as an early stage in the development of indirect speech in Slavic, e.g., Otin (1969: 55 and passim) and Chaburgaev (1974: 426-27).33 In Vaillant's succinct words (19642: 374), "... à l'imitation du grec hoti, jako peut être suivi d'une phrase au style direct". A second ramification of the definition of indirect discourse given above is that certain constructions cannot be classified in a principled manner as either direct or indirect speech, at least in the absence of graphic or intonational cues.34 This ambiguity takes two forms in the earliest Slavic texts. The first involves cases of reports in which the re- porter and the addressee of the report are equally the speaker and the addressee, respectively, of the represented speech act. For example, in</page><page sequence="15">35 the following excerpt, John the Baptist's self-quotation following the word p'kx1* cannot be classified as either direct or indirect discourse without an element of arbitrariness: (13) OTT^K^LJJd HOdNTv H p6H6... KTsJ CáMU MKWk d^^'k/^TeAKCT^^fTS' 'fcKO p^x^ N'fecAiTs. d3Tv xV NT^ norhrtdNT* gc/wt* np'fyvk NH/WK (John 3: 27-28, in the Codex Marianus; Jagic (ed.) [1883] 1960: 324). The second type of ambiguity occurs when an inset report contains no deictic elements coreferential with its frame or any other elements that could shift in orientation, as in excerpt (2), above, and numerous other passages in the OCS canon and in the earliest Russian texts. In such cases, the question of whether the report is in direct or indirect speech is irrelevant, at least for written languages in which there are no graph- ic indicators of direct speech. Therefore, the kinds of examples that Gamanovic ([1964] 1991) and Mutalimova (1984) treat as indirect speech (see above) must be excluded from the analysis, despite the presence of jako, because they are inherently indeterminate (see also Kurz 1969: 206; Lunt 19746: 144; Worth 1985: 234-35; and Collins 1994: 30-31). This indeterminacy can be present even when the report is a verbatim citation of a prior text, such as biblical quotations: (14) ONTv &gt;K6 O'ThK'kllJTdKT* p6H6- ÍIHUJGTT*- N6 O X^^^ e^HNOAAb flOWH- kgtt* hkV nt' o KceAtk r/?fc icxo^aiuthiaik 13 oycTi* B&gt;KiH (Matthew 4: 4, in the Codex Zographensis; Jagic (ed.) [1879] 1954: 1). S. Indirect speech in cases of multiple participation frameworks Even when ambiguous cases of the kind discussed above are ex- cluded, clear-cut indirect speech turns out to be well attested in the earliest Slavic texts. Moreover, it tends to occur in specific discourse contexts in which its formal properties would seem to be communica- tively well motivated. For example, several of the cases of indirect speech in the earliest Slavic writings occur in a context (or cluster of contexts) in which indirect speech seems to be almost universally pre- ferred - namely, when the reporter or the addressee of the report (the narratee) is depicted as a participant in the represented speech situ- ation, but with a different participation status than in the actual speech situation.35 In such cases, in which the reporter's first-person perspec- tive holds sway over the discourse, any deictic words that appear within the report tend to make reference to the participation framework of the actual (enframing) utterance rather than that of the represented (in-</page><page sequence="16">36 set) one.36 Clearly the use of indirect discourse is, in general, purposive in the given context, because its formal properties can mitigate the difficulties in production and interpretation that might otherwise be caused by competing deictic orientations. While self-quotations and addressee-reports are ubiquitous in every- day dyadic conversation and in quasi-dyadic discourse types such as let- ters and epistles, they are relatively uncommon in the earliest Slavic writings, for the simple reason that the surviving texts generally do not feature overt, homodiegetic narrators and/or addressees. The Gospels, Acts, and early hagiographies and chronicles are framed, for the most part, as third-person narratives with effaced narrators, as are the later- attested historical works of the Old Testament;37 hence self-quotations and reports of addressees' utterances occur only in additional layers of reported speech within reported speech (see below). While sermonic discourse can involve both an overt reporter and explicit addressees, the translated sermons found in the earliest Slavic writings, e.g., in Clozianus and Suprasliensis, do not happen to include any instances of homodiegesis. The same is true in the Psalter; here the fact that the in- dividual psalms often lack a single controlling viewpoint presents a fur- ther factor that militates against the given kind of speech-reporting.38 The potential reported speech that occurs in the procedural discourse of service books such as the Euchologium Sinaiticum is framed in the third person, with a suppressed reporter: (15) H nOTO/VKb&gt; KrK/'O&gt;KHT&lt;rK&gt; Kp&lt;TK&gt;CTTk[l] KT* Kô^, Kp&lt;TK&gt;CTA M/U&lt;b&gt; I r&lt;/'drO&gt;/'A- Kl* CrtdRÄ C&lt;KA&gt;TtKIIA TpOHLJA, ô&lt;Tb&gt;l^d H Kt^Nd H C&lt;KA&gt;TddTO A&lt;Oy&gt;Xd, N'fclN'k H npMCNO H rtWA&lt;He&gt;- dA^HN&lt;rK&gt; (Euchologium Sinaiticum; Frcek (ed.) 1933-1939, part 1: 648, fol. 6a-6b). Moreover, the reports inset within the third-person frame - the prayers to be intoned and their responses - reflect a collective, institu- tional perspective rather than the controlling viewpoint of individual speakers that is characteristic of self-quotations and addressee-report- ing. The language of such texts, like that of nomocanonical and other legislative works, is intended to be "autonomous", in Kay's sense (1977), i.e., maximally independent of the specifics of context and background knowledge. While there can be reports attributed to the in- tended addressee of the prayers, these tend to be scriptural quotations presented as direct speech (complementized and uncomplementized),</page><page sequence="17">37 the only mode of reporting well-suited, by virtue of its formal proper- ties, for verbatim citation of authorities (cf. Sternberg 1982b: 149).39 As mentioned above, in the Gospels reported speech that is inset in the narrative can contain additional layers of reported speech. These doubly narrated quotations can be conveyed in the form of indirect dis- course when the reporters, i.e., the represented speakers of the outer layer of reported speech, cite remarks in which they themselves are mentioned and explicitly ascribe them to their addressees, the repre- sented speakers of the inner layer of reported speech. In cases of indi- rectness, the reporter will control the first-person perspective in the inner as well as the outer layer of reported speech: (16) p^UJA We KhCH TT^I AW 6CH OyBO CÍTK kSkHM- ONT* &gt;K6 KTv NH/ttiv pene- ktvI r/TeTe ■kKO d3*k ecMT* (Luke 22: 70, in the Codex Ma- rianus; Jagic (ed.)

In these passages, the additional layers of reported speech are framed as indirect discourse not only in the OCS but also in the Greek originals (excerpts (16') and (17')). The indirectness of the renarrated reports can be seen by comparing them with the statements that they echo in the previous turns at speaking (tt^i /'h ecH oyßo cítk bSkmh in (16), oyso ijFp aw ecH tt^i in (17)), which have second- rather than first-person pro- nouns and verb forms. Both of these requotations have the character of repartee in dialogue (see Longacre 1983: 43-76; cf. also Arutjunova 1986). The (represented) reporter turns the content of his interlocutor's question into an assertion or affirmation; at the same time, he disclaims responsibility for that assertion without disavowing it.40 By virtue of its formal properties, complementized indirect speech is well-suited for this kind of illocution. By minimizing the transition from the enframing narrative - in excerpts (16) and (17), the outer layer of reported speech - to the embedded quotation, it renders the tag clause and, in particular, the identity of the speaker more prominent in the discourse than the report itself.41 In other words, the given mode of re-</page><page sequence="18">JO porting mitigates the effect of what Page (1988: 33) aptly calls "'gear- shifting'... in the change from nondialogue to dialogue elements and back again". Indirect speech is, on the whole, more suitable than direct speech for presenting presupposed42 or backgrounded information be- cause it maintains the reference points of the current speech situation; hence it avoids the abrupt changes of footing characteristic of direct speech, which can impede the flow of the discourse and, consequently, the pace of interpretation.43 In general, indirect speech as a reductive or condensing strategy tends to be used to convey information that does not require the maximally explicit form of presentation, direct speech, in order to be adequately comprehended.44 The use of a complementizer, as in excerpts (16) and (17), enhances the steadying effect of indirect speech. Because their dependence on the embedding structure is made explicit, reports that are grammati- cally integrated by complementization or by clause union require less interpretation, and hence delay apprehension less, than independent clauses composed of structurally separate, paratactically or asyndetically connected layers.45 Therefore, explicitly subordinated complement clauses tend to be used in framing information that is perceived as less promi- nent, for whatever reason (Townsend and Bever 1977: 1, 4 and passim; Wallace 1982: 212, 215). The fact that indirect speech is likewise em- ployed in presenting messages in a less salient manner explains, at least in part, why it tends cross-linguistically to co-occur with complementiz- ers, even though, as mentioned above, explicit subordination is neither a necessary nor a sufficient property of the given mode of reporting. A third instance of an addressee-report in the OCS canon likewise involves competing deictic orientations; however, it is not an echo of previous dyadic discourse but rather a message that the reporter is bid- ding the addressee to deliver on his behalf. This example is interesting in that the indirect mediated quotation is introduced into the discourse without any signal of subordination to the tag clause: (18) r/Td 6H icV Ne npHKdCdM ca Mbhrk- ng oy bo k^ma^ otl^w /vto- 6/WOy- l^H We K*h BpdTpH A'06M l Çh''U H/MT* K^CXOJK^ KT* OTl^W Moe/woy h oífw Kdwe/woy- i (Toy woe/woy h Boy Kdwe/woy (John 20: 17, in the Codex Marianus; Jagic (ed.)

Goffman 1981: 144), i.e., the person whose position it will establish. The indirectness of the mediated message can be seen both from its content and from the fact that the first-person forms kt^cxowa^ and AtoeAtoy are used unambiguously in reference to Jesus rather than to Mary Magdalene, the represented intermediary and the subject of the immediately preceding tag clause. One could perhaps see some blurring of perspective in the use of the second-person pos- sessive B4UJ6/M0Y in reference to Mary's intended addressees; the given form would be appropriate if the message were framed as direct speech controlled by her viewpoint or else presented as if Jesus were the ani- mator as well as the principal.46 This may be why Blass and Debrunner (1961: 247) treat the mediated report in excerpt (18') under the rubric "Mixture of direct and indirect discourse", by which they evidently mean slipping, and supply a tag clause to make Jesus the represented speaker: "... eipe autois. (my Master says to tell you,) anabainõ". While slipping, which is attested elsewhere in the Greek and Slavonic New Testament (see below), is certainly a possibility here, one can also in- terpret the mediated report as straightforward indirect speech, since the author undoubtedly believed Mary Magdalene to be in the same rela- tionship of filiation with God as those to whom the message was ostensibly addressed. Indeed, the use of third-person pronouns in this context (*oíjw hx^, *ßoy hx'k) would have had a disturbingly aloof or exclu- sionary implicature (much as when one exasperated parent tells the other, "Do you know what your child did today?"). Mediated reported speech offers potential conflict not only in first- person but also in the second-person viewpoint - for example, when reporters charge addressees with autoreferential messages (often, com- mands or questions) to third parties, as in the following excerpts.47 (19) i /uapTd AMivB/fkaiije o •w'KNOS'k crtoywivB'k- ctüktvUjh &gt;K6 pene- Fm N6 pd^HUJH AY' 'fcKO CeCT(p)d AAO'fc e^HNÄ AAA OCTdBM C/tOy&gt;KMTH- pKi^H oyso en ^d mm noMOweTTv (Luke 10: 40, in the Codex Ma- rianus; Jagic (ed.)

Keleuson me luthënai (ibid.).48 In reported commands of this kind, the use of indirectness prevents confusion between the perspectives of the addressees in the different layers of representation. In this respect, as in others, renarrated speech tends to replicate the patterns of reporting found in nonnarrative con- texts in everyday conversation and in quasi-dyadic discourse such as letters, in which the overt first-person viewpoint of the speaker or writer predominates - for example, Novgorodian birchbark letters such as the following: (21) à NTviNe Ka: ñonqui kt* TOAtoy: AtoyweKH: rpdAtOToy: e ^h *Y Nero poKd: (Novgorod birchbark letter no. 109, stratigraphically dated to the end of the eleventh century to the mid-1110s; Zaliznjak 1995: 235).

(Novgorod birchbark letter no. 235, stratigraphically dated to the 1160s-1170s; ibid.: 308) Similar cases of indirect discourse appear in early Slavic writings when the reporters renarrate their addressees' autoreferential speech acts. This situation occurs at least once in the corpus of canonical OCS manuscripts and can also be found in Slavonic texts that are of later attestation but were presumably translated in the earliest period of Slavic literacy.49 (24) i no/MT^iiiMdídX/ft AP°YrTK KTK AP*YroY r/TwsuiiTe- 'two x4*KTK Ne HMdAtTv- l pdSOy/WkKTv HCT* rÃd HAtT*- HTO nO/VA^IUJAddTe ^KO Xa^ktx Ne H/MdTe- Ne w ah Hwexe nh pdaoy/M'fceTe eujTe- OKdAie- N6N0 ah HAAdTe cp^i^e Kdiue (Mark 8: 16-17, in the Codex Mari- anus; Jagic (ed.)

(25') ... hoti ouk apëggeilas moi, hoti gunë sou estin... (Genesis 12: 18;</page><page sequence="21">41 Brenton (ed.) [n.d.] 1970: 14). In the Slavonic passages, as in their Greek equivalents, the second- person forms within the renarrated reports (HMdTe in (24), th in (25)) are coreferential with the second-person subjects of the tag clauses (no- /MTJUMddTG in (24), noK^d in (25)).50 In both cases, the messages con- veyed by the requotations are presupposed in the discourse - a factor that promotes the use both of indirect speech and of the complement- izer, as was seen in excerpts (16) and (17). The Gospel passage cited in (24) actually includes the complementized direct-speech equivalent of the indirect renarration (r/u^uiTe- 'kno x^bt* we umamts). The Old Tes- tament reading in (25) echoes an earlier verse in the same episode in which Abram is depicted bidding Sarai to dissemble about her iden- tity.51 In addition, the same verse contains a structurally similar report that shows the expected pronominalization strategy for oratio recta - noHTO mí pene rano cGCTpd /MM gc[tk], in which c6CTpd /uh is codesigna- tive with &gt;K6Nd th (even though the given case of represented speech violates the felicity condition of sincerity, since the reader is aware that Sarai was only Abram's half-sister and since the context suggests that he was concerned with hiding a different kind of relationship). Another feature of the context that may have favored the use of complementized indirect speech in excerpts (24) and (25) is the fact that both of the renarrated reports are backgrounded in the discourse, i.e., intended to be less salient than the surrounding text. In (24), it is clearly the tag clause rather than the reported message that is asserted in the discourse (see the discussion of excerpts (16) and (17), above). As the sequel to the requotation shows, it is not the contents of the disciples' speech acts but the fact that they were debating (noAATviuj- rt'fcdX/ft - no/UTxiiiMddTe) that Jesus is holding up as an illustration of their lack of faith; in the sequel he is represented upbraiding them for forgetting that he fed crowds of four and five thousand (Mark 8: 19-20). In excerpt (25), the negated tag clause to which the indirect re- port-clause is subordinated conveys backgrounded collateral information by virtue of its counterfactual status. As Grimes (1975: 65) observes, the discourse function of negated clauses and other "comparators" is primarily to subserve the representation of asserted events: "By provid- ing a range of nonevents that might take place, [collateral information] heightens the significance of the real event" (see also Labov 1972: 380-82). In the given instance, Pharaoh is depicted adducing what Abram did not say only as a prologue to questioning Abram's motive in</page><page sequence="22">42 prevaricating. It is noteworthy that the factual substance of Abram's offending speech act is presented in the more salient mode of direct speech (iiohto /'h pene raKO cecTpa mu 6c[ttk]). A further situation in which indirect speech is attested in the OCS canon, as well as in slightly later Slavonic sources, is in renarrated third-person statements that make reference to the represented report- er.52 This is likewise a context in which competing deictic orientations might have caused confusion if direct discourse had been employed.53 (26) )(Bd/M4 (Td, raKO ni të^HNoroMe KarK X^CTHXrKi tivK/uo KpHcna h PdHd, há Ne KT0 P6H6TK, «KO B*k /U0I6 H/MA XPC™XTK# X?"C™XTfck me H CT6¿|sdHHNK AOAilvj K TOAtOy N6 B'k^t a4je KOr° HNOrO XpcTHX'K (1 Corinthians. 1: 14-16, in the Christinopol'skij Apó- stol; Kahizniacki (ed.) 1896: 138).54 (26') hiña me tis eipêi hoti eis to emon onoma ebaptisa (1 Corinthians 1: 15; Nestle and Nestle (eds.) 193014: 427, variant reading).

In both of these cases, the requotations convey collateral informa- tion; this fact presumably motivated the use of indirect speech in Greek and Slavonic as a way of rendering the reports less prominent in the discourse. Excerpt (26) resembles (25) in having a purely hypothetical, indeed, counterfactual message with a negated tag - a proposition ad- duced only as a way of asserting its opposite. For the author (whether in the original or as represented in the Slavonic translation) to abrogate his own perspective in favor of the viewpoint of a nonreferential entity would be a contextually marked shift disproportionate to the impor- tance of this ancillary report in the given segment of discourse, especi- ally given that the hypothetical report has neither a reply nor any other sequel. In excerpt (27), not only is the report collateral information (since questions "raise alternatives that might or might not turn out to be so"; Grimes 1975: 65), it is also presupposed, as an echo of the go- vernor's question (neco pa^H oyso Ne wbpewH). Its backgrounded status in the discourse is evident from the fact that it serves merely as a pre- amble for Basiliskos' subsequent affirmation (a3Tü b'khn/K &gt;Kbp^...).</page><page sequence="23">43 Although indirect speech appears to be the basic reporting mode when the reporters or addressees are participants in the represented speech situation but have a different status than in the actual speech situation, the OCS canon also contains instances of direct speech - i.e., reports in which the deictic orientation of the represented speakers is maintained rather than that of the reporters - that are employed seem- ingly in the same general situation.55 By my observations, nonconfor- ming examples of this kind turn out in context to exhibit special features, which justify the use of direct discourse despite the potential conflicts in deictic orientation: (28) OTTvK'fcWTd W6Nd H p6H6 6/MOy- N6 H/Md/MTv /MftHtd- ÍMd GH HCT*- AOKp'k pene ■feno /w^wd n6 hmümt^ ratk bo /vt/K&gt;Kh HAfk/U ecH- i NTviN'fc erowe H/UdWH n^ctt* th mäwtv ce kt* icthnä pene (John 4: 17-18, in the Codex Marianus; Jagic (ed.)

Despite the use of direct speech, there is no risk of perspectivai confusion in either of these requotations, because disambiguating ele- ments appear in the immediate context - mkma in (28) and the difference in number between the subject of the tag clause and the one within the renarrated report in (29). The messages conveyed by the renarrated re- ports framed as complementized direct speech in these passages have already been established in the discourse (see John 10: 33 for the pre- cedent of the second excerpt). Nevertheless, they are foregrounded (like their tag clauses) in their second instantiations, because they serve as texts that the reporters are about to submit to discussion and analysis. In excerpt (28), the report forms part of a dialogic repartee; it is sim- ilar to what Arutjunova (1986: 54) terms a "parnaja citacija neodo- brenija" ("ceF peredraznivanija - ukazat' sobesedniku na neadekvat- nost', neèticnost' i pr. zanjatoj im kommunikativnoj ili ziznennoj pozi-</page><page sequence="24">44 rii" or even to outright parody ("parodiruja cuzuju ree', govorjascij ca- sto stavit pod somnenie podlinnost' ee èmocionarnoj 'upakovki'"; ibid.). Jesus is depicted assuming the Samaritan woman's not entirely forth- right words as a temporary rhetorical position in order to reveal pre- ternaturally her actual situation; cf. the emphatic topicalization of MfoWâ, as of andrà in the Greek version (incidentally, a lucid illustra- tion of the nonreproductiveness of direct speech in both languages). In his subsequent exegesis of her statement (nATh bo m^wk H/tffc/ta ecH- i NTviN'k erowe HAtdUJH N'ferrK th /m;k&gt;kt'), Jesus is, as it were, entering into a dialogue with the speech that he is reporting. Clearly the renar- rated reported speech is important in and of itself as a theme in the embedded discourse, much like the dyadic reports inset in the narrative framework of the Gospels.57 The direct-speech requotation in excerpt (29) likewise forms part of a dialogic repartee. The foregrounding of this report is evident first of all from the fact that it is placed into focus by being contrasted with the report in the following causal clause (kt^i rvfeTe 'kKO K/'ace|sHAt/'- ■teujH... p'fex^ 'fcKO cÍTK b&gt;kmh GC/Mh). The requotation, once introduced, serves as a gambit for a counterargument (aiiiTe ah TKop»^...), in which the validity of the represented addressees' statement is subjected to a direct challenge. As was the case in (28), Jesus is depicted temporarily adopting (reenacting) his interlocutors' rhetorical position as a prelimi- nary to analysis. Therefore, at least two features in the contextualization of the re- quotations in (28) and (29) favored the use of direct speech. First, the reports convey verbal repartee, in which the represented reporter briefly echoes snatches of the previous dialogue for rhetorical purposes. Direct speech is unique among the modes of reporting precisely because its formal properties allow the reporter to assume the purported viewpoint ("voice") of the represented speaker by re-enacting that individual's pu- tative orientation in the represented speech event.58 Second, the renar- rated reports in (28) and (29) are foregrounded in the discourse. As various investigators have observed, cross-linguistically there is a wide- spread - perhaps even universal - tendency for direct speech to be preferred over any other available reporting technique when the report- er wishes to highlight the represented speech event.59 This same ten- dency explains why oratio recta is so prevalent in the earliest Slavonic narratives, including the OCS Gospels, in which speech acts tend to be presented as sequenced events in the plotlines. The turn-taking charac- teristic of dialogue implies that its representation in narrative will tend</page><page sequence="25">45 strongly to consist of sequenced events. If one wished to salvage the hypothesis that indirect speech was nonexistent or inchoate at the time of the earliest attested Slavic writ- ings (see above), one could conceivably claim that the indirect reports in excerpts (16)-(20) and (24)-(29) are nonnative imitations of the syn- tax of the Greek originals (excerpts (16')-(20') and (24')-(29')) or, at any rate, of Greek model-texts. However, there does not seem to be any reason a posteriori to prefer such an explanation. Indeed, the ques- tion of the origin of indirect speech in early Slavic is essentially moot (at least when only internal evidence is used), since the given mode of reporting is attested not only in the oldest surviving texts but also in later stages of the Slavic languages, including the modern literary stan- dards and including West Slavic, where Greek influence has been mini- mal.60 The belief that early Slavic syntax must have been "simpler" or more "primitive" - understood as more paratactic - than that of the modern languages in this regard, as in others, must remain aprioristic; it cannot be established without circularity on the basis of the oldest monumenta, nor is it supported by a context-sensitive reading of those texts. One fact that can be established on the basis of examples like (16)-(20) and (24)-(29) is that readers of the earliest Slavic texts were presented with models of indirect speech used in a way that avoided ambiguity and perspectivai "gear-shifting" when more than one explicit participation framework was involved. The changes of viewpoint that would have resulted if direct speech had been used in that context would have retarded the pace of interpretation, an effect that would not be strategic in the case of reports that were backgrounded in the discourse. Thus, in the given context(s), indirect speech was used pur- posively in the earliest Slavic texts, as in their Greek originals/models. In this light, it is important to recognize that, even though the same pattern of reporting was found in the Greek originals of the Slavonic canon, the tendency to use indirect speech instead of direct in the giv- en context(s) is not specifically Greek but rather universal. The pro- nominal switches that are the quintessence of indirectness can occur even in languages that otherwise lack indirect speech when elements coreferential with the speaker or addressee of the ongoing speech event are involved. For example, according to Ebert (1986: 150), in Chamling, a Tibeto-Burman language of Nepal, direct speech is the only mode of reporting available except "when something said about the actual speaker or hearer by a third person is reported...":</page><page sequence="26">46 "It is felt odd to talk in 3rd person about a speech act participant. Therefore nouns and 3rd person pronouns or possessives are adapted to the actual situation. The switch is possible only in one direction: 3rd -» 2nd/lst[.] Taking a deictic switch as the basic feature of indirect speech, we may state that Chamling makes a limited use of this tech- nique. It is, so to speak, a concession to pragmatic practicability, even though it does in principle lead to ambiguities." (ibid.: 151) Ebert points to a similar limited use of indirect speech in Nepali, Hindi, and Farsi, and suggests that it may be a linguistic universal (ibid.: 152-53, 156). Whether or not this is the case, from the stand- point of language use indirect speech is well motivated and, one might think, even natural in such contexts, since it effectively avoids the po- tential misunderstandings attendant upon a pronominalization strategy that inverts the ongoing speech situation by treating the actual address- ees as represented speakers and the actual speakers as represented addressees or even as third-person referents. The same universal or near-universal tendency explains why, e.g., early East Slavic passages of direct speech that include second- or third-person references to the writers or represented speakers often feature a slip from direct into indirect speech. This is illustrated by Novgorod birchbark no. 531, a letter from Anna to her brother Kliment that dates from the end of the twelfth or the beginning of the thir- teenth century: (30) d&gt;K6 TH R030M0/'0KH KOCNATHNO &amp;áAá pOyKOy A3d [sic] 3AT6 TT^I we Kpai^e rocnoAHNe /uo/tOKH e/vto [sic] tüko owe koya*Y AWAH Nd AAOw chTpoY [5/c]t 0&gt;Ke B0YA°Y ^WAH npH koaao roya^Y A&lt;m¿ poyKoy 3d 3ATG to Te a ko KHN6 (Arcichovskij and Janin 1978: 131, no. 531). The first two occurrences of the form budu in this passage are third person plurals featuring the characteristic Northwest Russian loss of desinential -f (see Zaliznjak 1986: 143-44); judging from the ending of the participle dala (feminine singular), the third instance, which occurs in the underlined portion, is a first person singular that refers to the writer Anna. Hence the passage may be translated as follows: "But you, lord brother [sc. Kliment], speak to him thus: If there are witnesses against my [sc. Kliment's] sister - if there are witnesses before whom I 'sc. Annal gave surety for my son-in-law, then I 'sc. Annal am at fault". As was mentioned above, the phenomenon of slipping is treated by</page><page sequence="27">47 some investigators as an indication that early Russian writers were not yet sufficiently familiar with the nascent category of indirect speech to control the intricacies of its pronominalization strategy. If that were the case, surely one would not expect slips from direct into indirect speech, as in excerpt (30), or in other early South and East Slavic texts: (31) H pene ^d ia noTp'kB/iiÄ: dijje Ne bi Atoei HSB'hpdN'Ki ero: Ctuat* KT* CTvKpoyiueNii np'fyvk niaak: RT^KpaTm 'fcpocTT* ero: y^d Ne no- royBrrh ixt* (Psalm 105 [106]: 23, in the Psalterium Sinaiticum; Sever'janov (éd.)

At any rate, slipping is rather common in languages that unquestion- ably have fully developed, long-standing indirect speech, such as En- glish and Modern Russian, in which, pace Peskovskij (1956: 485-86), indirect speech is a familar and fully developed method of reporting.63 Thus slipping provides no evidence for any putative evolution from di- rect to indirect speech, unless one wants to treat as an archaism a phe- nomenon that clearly arises spontaneously in the production constraints of everyday speech. Careful attention to its contextualization shows that it has various pragmatic motivations (see, e.g., Collins 1994: passim),</page><page sequence="28">48 including, notably, helping the speaker to track pronominal reference in extended, syntactically convoluted passages of reported speech.64 6. Indirect speech and summaries Another context in which indirect speech is found in the earliest Slavic writings is in reports that recapitulate episodes described in de- tail in the preceding text. Summaries of this kind are used, for ex- ample, to attribute accounts of individual experiences that have been presented in the order of the narrative rather than as flashbacks - i.e., as events in the world rather than as discourse: (34) npH^e AAapH'k Mar^aAUHH KbSß^ujTa^ujTH oyhgnhkoait* 'bKO KHA'fe Fa- i cm pene gh (John 20: 18, in the Codex Marianus; Jagic [1883] 1960: 398).

In excerpt (34), Mary Magdalene is depicted informing the disciples of events of which the reader has just been told at length (see John 20: 11-17); cf. the anaphoric use of ch 'these things (that have just been stat- ed in the narrative)'. The indirectness of the complementized report can be seen in the use of third-person forms coreferential with the subject of the tag clause (kha*, gh). Clearly the evangelist (both in the original and as animated by the Slavic translator) felt it necessary to indicate the source of a narrated scene that he did not witness, despite the re-</page><page sequence="29">49 dundancy involved, because he was recounting Mary's experience as tes- timony to the Resurrection, one of the central messages of his work. It is noteworthy, in this regard, that the author/animator framed the most important portion of Mary's speech act ('bKO KHA'fc rd) in a relatively diffuse manner, which would require less reconstructive work on the part of the reader than its highly compressed sequel (t ch pene 6h). Much the same pattern appears in excerpt (35), in which Cleopas and his companion tell the disciples of their encounter with the risen Jesus on the road to Emmaus - an episode already recounted in the preceding text (see Luke 24: 13-32). In this case, much of their repre- sented speech act is condensed into a relative clause that functions as a textual conveyor ('bwe ktviuja Nd n^TH).66 However, as in (34), the most crucial part of their revelation - the part that the author/anima- tor wanted to stress to the reader - is presented in the less reductive form of complementized indirect discourse (cf. the third-person pro- noun H/vtd, which refers to the represented speakers). In excerpt (36), the indirect report likewise recapitulates the pre- vious narrative (see Luke 8: 43-46) in the form of a represented speech act. Source-attribution was particularly important in the given episode because the narrated information - the healing of an internal disorder - could be supplied only by the individual most affected. It may be ob- served that the indirect report serves as background for Jesus' repre- sented speech act in the following verse, which is framed as direct dis- course (ont' we p(e)ne en Api^dM ^vkujtm K'fcpa TKO'b crfc[e] ta h^h ktv /UHp-h; Luke 8: 48, Jagic (ed.) [1883] 1960: 232).67 As in excerpts (34) and (35), the principal message in the represented speech act is con- veyed by indirect speech (1îko HCLvfcrt'b dKHe, in which the third-person aorist is coreferential with the tag verb noK't^'b). The remainder of the reprise is framed in a more reductive manner, with a proleptic relative phrase headed by an evaluative noun that serves as the direct object of the verbum dicendi (3d Ntiftwe khnä npHKOCN^ ca e/v'T'); the reader can only interpret this passage by reconstructing the proposition(s) to which the phrase 3d Ni^^e khnä refers (cf. 'fewe ktsjuja Nd hath in (35)).68 A similar use of indirect speech in the context of recapitulations can be found in original South and East Slavic texts (which admittedly tend to be profoundly influenced by the syntax of translations from Greek) - for example, The Tale of the Miracles of Roman and David (Boris and Gleb) in the late-twelfth- or early-thirteenth-century Rus'ian Uspenskij Sbornik:</page><page sequence="30">50 (37) h cT^Kdsaiue npe/i/h Bbck/tw raw6 KH^'fc- raKO npHWb/t/KUja erara /MHNK4 KT' N6AA0Y' iipeKpKCTHCTa 'GM$'( OHM TpHlilb^l- H dKHJ6 w^RpT^ocTa ca ohm rero (Kotkov (éd.) 1971: 65, fol. 22c20-26). This instance of indirect speech (cf. the third-person pronouns kt* Ne/Moy, ra/uoy, raro) occurs in an account of a miraculous healing. The content of the formerly blind man's report is at least partially presup- posed from events related in the preceding narrative: h npHUje^^ npe- BTUKdWe Oy LJPKK6 CTOto /MHKOy ^HH N'feKO/WKO- iipHiia^ara H AAO/AA CA CTti/tta A°NAe&gt;Ke k^ictk 'GM$' norfeijjeNHre h nposhp'k (ibid.: fol. 22cl2-18). However, certain connections are left to the inferential work of the reader, while one procedural detail (npeKpbCTMrra re/ttoy ohm TpH- uib^i) is reported for the first time; presumably it is too tangential to the main point to require special foregrounding. It is noteworthy that the author begins with full integration of the speech into the narrative in the form of a relative clause (rawe kh/^) but shifts to the less con- densed technique of complementized indirect speech to convey the crux of his story, the miracle itself, which he is using to demonstrate the grace and power of the saints whom he is commemorating. It is also significant that the author utilized direct speech to frame the only re- presented speech act (a vision of St. George) that is foregrounded in the preceding narrative (ibid.: fol. 22b30-22c8). The use of oratio obliqua in these OCS and Old Rus'ian examples, as in their Greek originals/models, would seem to be a context-sensitive use of the given reporting strategy. Indirect speech is a more economi- cal way of presenting summaries than direct speech because its peculiar features promote streamlining of the message. This is especially appro- priate in contexts that exhibit a reduced information load, as compared with the preceding discourse - for example, passages featuring a tran- sition from a dyadic framework to a more continuously narrative for- mat, as in excerpts (34)-(36). In recapitulations, the information that is uniquely provided by direct speech - in particular, orientation within the participation framework of the represented speech event - is essen- tially superfluous; only the propositional content of the represented speech needs to be conveyed as a reminder of discourse purportedly already familiar to the reader or hearer. All other things being equal, the lack of deictic switches in indirect speech embedded in narrative allows for a smooth transition between the frame and the inset, as compared with direct discourse; as Page (1988: 33) observes, "Indirect speech... combines more readily with nar-</page><page sequence="31">51 rative style [than direct speech], making possible a free movement from one to another" (cf. also Cumakov 1975: 19, 26). Therefore, at least in principle, indirect speech maintains the same pace of interpretation as the narrative, or even accelerates it in cases such as (34)-(37), in which information is condensed by means of evaluative terms, textual-con- veyor nouns, anaphora, demonstratives, and similar referential strate- gies. This "glossing-over" effect makes the indirect reports in summa- ries less time-consuming to interpret and, concomitantly, less salient in the discourse than the nearby passages of direct speech used to convey new, foregrounded information. In general, providing for a compara- tively fast rate of intepretation would seem to be a desideratum in summaries, especially those that occur between or at the end of episodes. Since the information communicated is generally redundant, the author can assume that the intended interpreter has processed it already and needs only a minimal reorientation before going on to the next episode. It should be noted that the Slavonic translations of the Gospels, like their Greek originals, also contain instances of reprises that are framed as direct rather than indirect speech. However, despite their apparent similarities, such cases generally represent situations different from straightforward summaries like the ones discussed above. For example, the following passage bears a superficial resemblance to excerpt (36), in that a healing miracle previously expounded in the narrative is con- veyed for a second and, indeed, a third time in the form of reported speech: (38) r/TddX/ft &gt;K6 6/Moy- KdKO th ca OTBp'krre ohm- OT^K'fciiJTd ont* h P6H6- H/TkKTv HdpHL^dG/U^I H?

(John 9: 10-12, 15-16; Nestle and Nestle (eds.) 193014: 260).69 This passage is distinguished from excerpts (34)-(37) by two fea- tures. First, the formerly blind man's reports are presented as turns at speaking in a dyadic narrative framework. As was mentioned above, dialogue inset in narrative tends to be presented as sequenced, plot-ad- vancing speech acts; direct speech is preferred in this context because the changes of "footing" or perspectivai shifts that it involves tend to make reports obtrusive and hence prominent in the discourse. Second, unlike the reported summaries in (34)-(37), the blind man's testimony in its third instantiation is not accepted outright; it occasions réponses and debate (see the rest of John 9). This delayed reception and scrutiny keep the message in the foreground of the discourse. In fact, the given repetitions cannot be regarded as summaries. A strategic use of both direct and indirect speech may be seen in the following recapitulation from the Acts of the Apostles in both the Greek and the Slavonic versions: (39) CHUSA &gt;K6 NdAtb, KdKO BM/t/fc K XPdm'k CKOS/Ub dnK/'d, CTdKUId H p6- K bill d 6/M$: iloC/AH Kb Horib AtKttH H npH3OKM CH/MONd, NdpHL'd6A'drO flexpd, Hwe peneri* r/nu k TeK'k, Kb NHX^we crfcewH ce ttu h KbCb A*Atb TKOM (Acts 11: 13-14, in the Christinopol'skij Apóstol; Kaluzniacki (ed.) 1896: 26). (39') Apëggeilen de hêmin põs eiden ton aggelon en tõi oikõi autou stathenta kai eiponta. aposteilon eis Ioppën kai metapempsai Si- mona ton epikaloumenon Petron (Acts 11: 13; Nestle and Nestle (eds.) 193014: 332). This report occurs in a lengthy passage of direct speech in which the apostle Peter is depicted relating his encounter with the Roman centurion Cornelius, the represented speaker of excerpt (39), to other members of the early Church. It should be noted that Cornelius' vision has already been related twice (although not to the given represented audience) - first as narrative (Acts 10: 3-6), with the angel's inset state- ment framed as direct speech; then as a direct-discourse renarration, with Peter as the represented addressee (Acts 10: 30-32). In this third instantiation, Cornelius' statement is framed as indirect speech control- led by Peter's first-person perspective; cf. Nd/Ub, as well as the coreference of the third-person aorists CKd3d and RMA'fc, which have Cornelius as their understood subject. Three factors evidently conspired here to mo-</page><page sequence="33">53 tivate the indirectness: the presupposed status of the message; the po- tential conflict of deictic orientations; and the occurrence of the report in a fast-paced, highly compressed narrative sequence (Acts 11: 5-17). By contrast, the inner layer of reported speech, which is attributed to the angel, is framed as direct speech. It is evident that the slower pace of interpretation occasioned by this switch of perspectives subserved the purposes of both the represented reporter and the author (as well as his Slavic animator), since the message thus foregrounded refers to the redemption of the Gentiles, the crucial point in Peter's story and one of the central themes of the entire book. 7. Nondyadic indirect speech in narratives As was discussed above, direct speech is cross-linguistically the most prevalent strategy for framing dialogues and, in general, foregrounded speech inset in narrative discourse. This tendency, which is evidently universal, is clearly at work in OCS and in the earliest East Slavic texts. At the same time, it has been shown that indirect speech can provide a seamless transition from and to the narrative in which it is inset because it shares its reference points. The fact that indirect dis- course can mesh with narrative in this way motivates its use in present- ing reports that are meant to be interpreted relatively quickly, without delaying the pace of the exposition. This can include not only summa- ries of the kind analyzed above, but also reports of nondyadic discourse that appear between major episodes or as preambles to major scenes, as well as reports of speech acts that occur in isolation amidst the re- presentation of nonverbal action. In such contexts, where the give-and- take of dialogue is not a factor, the information contained in a report is often presented as being of interest not in and of itself but only in- sofar as it sets the stage for important events (both verbal and nonver- bal), sheds light on the motives of the characters in the narrative, or affects their movements and configuration in the represented participant framework. This can be the case even when the fact that an utterance occurred forms part of a chain of foregrounded events. In such situa- tions, the use of indirect speech ensures that the report will not be perceived as more prominent than the surrounding narrative. If a com- plementizer is employed in conjunction with the indirect speech, it al- lows the report to be processed as background information even when the act of speaking, as conveyed by the tag clause, is foregrounded. The reported speech that occurs in preambles to important dialogues,</page><page sequence="34">54 sermons, or other episodes tends to be backgrounded so that it will not distract from the more important episodes to come. This general pur- pose motivates the use of indirect speech and other reductive strategies, as in the following examples: (40) BhNHA6 K6 nOAA^ILU/AeHHe Kh, NA- KT'T0 MX*k BAWT6M BH BlU/tt (Luke 9: 46, in the Codex Marianus; Jagic (ed.)

In excerpts (40) and (41), the indirect reports are used to collapse various statements made by secondary or minor characters in the Gos- pel narrative.70 Reporting the speech acts individually would clearly give them undue weight. Indirect speeches an economical technique for coalescing overlapping statements, since It obviates the issue of present- ing the multiple viewpoints involved. The indirect reports of the disci- ples' wrangling in (40) and (41) do not convey messages that have any value as theological information; they are reported in order to establish a context for the admonitions that follow, which are framed, as expec- ted, in direct speech (see Luke 9: 47-48 and 22: 25-30). By contrast, the indirect report in excerpt (42), which is introduced by the even more integrated form of fused speech (noB'fc^ra wMVf omw c'h/vtpkTh), represents a single speech act, albeit by a minor character. While none of the information within the report is presupposed in the discourse, the individual details thus conveyed are not important per se; rather, they have a purely ancillary function - to show that Boris had</page><page sequence="35">55 good cause to fear Svjatopolk in order to bear witness to the great submission inherent in his subsequent actions (the crux of the hagio- grapher's message). The author's focus lies not on Volodimer's death, as catastrophic as that was in Rus'ian history, but on Boris' deeds and spiritual state; consequently, it is not surprising that the lengthy mono- logic lament of Boris that immediately follows this passage is presented in direct discourse, as foregrounded information. The same pattern of report can occur at the end of episodes, where the backgrounded reports typically convey nondyadic verbal reactions to the preceding dialogue or events: (43) ONH we McnrtT^NHiuA ca BeaoyMb'fc- i r"AX&amp; AP°YrTK KTK AP°YroY* HTO khwa cTvTKopH/'H h^h- (Luke 6: 11, in the Codex Marianus; Jagic (ed.)

The indirect question in excerpt (43) completes an illustrative epi- sode; it describes the reaction of the scribes and Pharisees, who are minor characters in the given narrative, to a sabbath-day healing (see Luke 6: 6-10). The represented speech clearly serves as a summary of an indeterminate number of speech acts by unidentified speakers, all of which have the same general purport. The use of direct speech here would necessitate considerable diffuseness, since several speech acts with different perspectives would have to be reported and attributed. Indirect speech is also used for economy of presentation in excerpt (44), in which, following the Last Supper, the disciples are depicted re- acting to the news that one of them would betray Jesus (cf. Luke 22: 14-22). Excerpt (44) actually serves a transition to another episode, the pre- amble of which is cited in (40). Indirect speech and other strategies that minimize the distinction between the report and the narrative are typical in transitional passages, in which events both verbal and nonver-</page><page sequence="36">56 bal are represented in a more compressed manner than in the surround- ing major episodes: (45) Ti^r^d sanp^TH oyneNHKO/Miv ckohmts- ^d NHKOAtoy&gt;K6 Ne peK^TT*- 'fcKO Cb 6CTT* HCT* xV OTT* TO/ffc NdHATT* UCK- CkKd3dTH OyH6NH- KOATk CKOHA^- 'fcKO nOAOKddTTv 6/WOy HTH K'Vvt'h- I AtTsHOrO flOCTpd- AdTH OTT* CTdpei^Tv- I dpXH6p6H- I KbNHWKNHKlv- I OyKlvGNOy KTvlTH- H TpeTH ^KNb KTvCTdTH- I flOG/VAT* I iieTpT*, NdHATT* iip'fep'feKdTH e/woy t/Ta- AtH/tocpX^ ttvI Fh- Ne H/WdT^ TeK* bt^itm ce- ont' &gt;Ke OKpdiiJT^ ca pene nexpoKH- i^h 3d /m^nokr cotono rhK/idSNi* aìh ecH- 'bKO Ne aat^kmhujh 'fejKe cätt^ bhíh^ n [sic - DEC] HancKd'b (Matthew 16: 20-23, in the Codex Marianus; Jagic (ed.)

(Matthew 16: 20-23; Nestle and Nestle (eds.) 193014: 43-44, variant reading). This passage contains the transition between two thematically impor- tant dialogues between Jesus and Peter (cf. the similar passage in Mark 8: 30-31, in the Codex Marianus; Jagic (ed.) [1883] 1960: 146-47). There is no indication that the ensuing speech acts are dyadic. The first instance (adnp^TM oyHeNHKOMT* ckoh/mt*- ¿'d NMKO/vtoywe Ne peK^Tiv...) involves an indirect report of a command framed by a speech-act verb (see below). The second case of reported speech (NdHAT^ uck- c'hKd- 3dTH oyneNHKO/Mit ckoh/mtv 'feno no^oKddTTv 6Moy HTH k'Vmt*...) is an adumbration of events that will be given in greater detail later in the narrative. It is significant that, following this summary of a monologic speech event, the author (as well as his Slavic animator) reverts to di- rect speech for the presentation of a dialogic interchange (neTp^ NdHATT* np'fep'feKdTH 6/MOy T/Ta... ONT* &gt;K6 OKpdWTT* CA p6H6 fl6TpOKH...). Reports of nondeclarative speech acts such as commands and re- quests are particularly common in fast-paced narrative in which nonver- bal action is primary. Obviously part of the reason for this is that such speech acts are typically employed in the world to stage-manage the actions of others. As Longacre (1983: 57-58) points out, speech events that have "nonverbal resolutions" cannot be considered prototypical dy- adic interchanges, for all that there is a form of response. Reporting</page><page sequence="37">57 them in direct speech, as if they occurred in dialogue, opens the possi- bility that the verbal portion of the interaction could be perceived as more prominent than the action(s) that it occasions. There are situ- ations in which this foregrounding may be motivated - for example, when the represented addressees of the speech acts are depicted as being uncooperative, so that individual viewpoint becomes an issue. However, in fast-paced narrative in which one act leads to another, there is generally little reason to interrupt the exposition for speech acts that have their expected perlocution in the represented world. Indirect reports of stage-managing commands and requests, as well as other kinds of narrated directives, are well-attested in the OCS Gos- pels and in other early narrative texts.71 The following is a representa- tive example in its narrative context: (46) ICT' Hie OTH^e CT* OyHeNHKT^I CBOH/MH KT' AAOpW- I WhNOn* NdpfyVh OTT' r&lt;MH/'6IA ilo N6/Mb H^e...

(Mark 3: 9, 12; Nestle and Nestle (eds.) 193014: 90-91). This passage occurs in a stretch of narrative that has a great deal of nonverbal action and relatively little dialogue, as compared with other portions of the Gospels; it forms part of a transition between two ma- jor debates of Jesus and his opponents (Mark 3: 1-5 and 22-30). The first report in the excerpt (i pene oyHeNHKO/in* cbohaat*- ^d em* npH Ne/MT* Ad&amp;uY'['d...) is framed as indirect speech; cf. npH ncaatv, 6/vtoy, which are coreferential with the subject of pene. This directive is not part of a true dialogue, as can be seen from the fact that no men- tion is made of any response; its fulfillment is tacitly assumed in the narrative.72 Foregrounding this event would lend undue weight to speech that does not present any information subserving the overall theological message of the work.</page><page sequence="38">58 By contrast, the choral or coalesced statements of the demons being expelled is presented as direct speech, with second-person elements standing out markedly in an otherwise homogeneously third-person pas- sage (i K^nH'bx^ r/fwT6 'fcKO ttj ecH x&gt; c^ bh&lt;hh). The relative prom- inence of this report in its context presumably reflects a purposive use of reporting strategies, inasmuch as it offers testimony about the divinity of Jesus, a message crucial to the work as a whole.73 No such importance can be attributed to the message of the third report, a neg- ative directive framed as indirect speech (i Ancoro np'kujTddUje m/mtv- Ad Ne dB* TKOpATT* ero; cf. also Matthew 12: 16, Jagic (ed.) [1883] 1960: 38). While the fact that this command was uttered is foregrounded, the message itself, which concerns the actions of participants within a single episode, does not need to be presented in a more salient manner than the narrative.74 The same is true of the fourth report in excerpt (46) (h npnai^Kd wone cd/WT' x°Tik)- This stage-managing directive is framed in an even more compressed way than indirect speech - as a single-clause narra- tive synthesis involving a speech-act verb, with no attempt to present any of the propositional structure or structure of the underlying mes- sage. This extreme degree of reduction - narrative reports of speech acts, to use Leech and Short's term (1981: 323-24) - puts represented utterances "on a par with other kinds of action" (ibid.: 324; see also Coulmas 1985b: 149 and 1986: 20-21). Since the given strategy integrates or submerges the reported speech into the narrative (cf. Page 1988: 34), it can serve as an evaluative condensing strategy that prevents triv- ial portions of the narrative from being encumbered by unnecessary details, such as the complex shifts of perspective and general diffuseness characteristic of direct speech. Consequently, narrative reports of speech acts tend to co-occur with indirect discourse and other reductive modes of reporting in the earliest Slavic texts: (47) C^KdSdiiJd we »e/uoy dpxnepeM h cTdp'feHWHN'hi Hk&gt;a6m Nd fldB/td h /HO/tAXOyTH H, flpOCAl^Je BÎTrOAdTM Nd Nb, raKÔ A4 nOC/tŒTH H B*K HepcÁAATv, rtOKAUJG OyBO OyBMTH H Nd ílOyTH- ¿|ShCTT' *K6 WTB^lfJd, CTp'fcqjH fldBrtd BT' KeCdpHH, Cd/VTh X0TA ßTk CKOp'fc H3HTH- CoyijJHH BO Els.

This passage features a nuanced use of a rich variety of reporting techniques. To begin with, two narrative reports of speech acts (rhKd- 3dWd Nd and mo/iaxoyth) attributed to the high priests and elders are employed alongside an instance of complementized indirect speech in- troduced by the speech-act verbal collocation npocAijje K/froAdTM. Un- like the narrative reports of speech acts, where only the fact and type of the utterance are pertinent, this example of clausal indirect speech conveys a message that provides background needed for understanding the following context (the official Festus' uncooperative response). The content of Festus' reported command is important only insofar as it af- fects the future configuration of the central character; it is framed as an infinitive after a verbum dicendi (wTK^tjjd rrp'fcijiH), a strategy that offers a greater degree of integration into the narrative than clausal in- direct speech because of the lack of independent tense, mood, and per- son marking in the report (cf. Givón 1980; Haiman and Thompson 1984). The Slavonic translation does not make it clear whether the ac- companying participial phrase (cdAAT* xota rt* ckop^ h3hth), indicating Festus' future plans, is to be understood as authorial analysis or report- ed speech; if the latter (which seems more probable), it must be regard- ed as an instance of free indirect speech, the most complete form of coalescing narrative with reported discourse, since the participial phrase would be headed by the subject of the narrative matrix clause.75 Following this, there is a slip into direct speech tagged relatively inob- trusively by an intercalated verb of saying (as in the Greek original); this foregrounding is apparently motivated by the fact that the state- ment thus conveyed not only foils the elders' schemes but also sets the stage for an important verbal confrontation. While the elders' inter- change with Festus has a dyadic structure, so that direct speech might be expected throughout, in actuality the stage-managing discourse re- presented by the various integrative reporting modes serves primarily as background information intended to explain the configuration of parti- cipants in the subsequent crucial event, Paul's appeal to Caesar. This</page><page sequence="40">60 function evidently motivates the inobtrusive presentation of the report- ed speech through various reductive strategies. In general, integrated modes such as the infinitival reports and nar- rativized speech-act verbs discussed above bear a close relation to claus- al indirect speech in form as well as function. This is shown, inter alia, by the fact that they can include subordinated clauses with reported content.76 If any deictic elements are present in such clauses, they tend to have indirect orientation, as in the underlined portions of the follow- ing excerpts: (48) RtvIktojjw we anh, rhTKopwe n^hm wt HwAeH kokt*, npoK/'raujd ca, r/Twifie nh ^cth nh iimth, AONAewe oysh^TK fids/id (Acts 23: 12, in the Christinopol'skij Apóstol; Kahizniacki (ed.) 1896: 55-56).

This orientation toward the deictic framework of the narrative is by no means inevitable, as may be seen from cases in Slavonic texts (as well as their Greek originals) that feature direct speech in clauses sub- ordinated to intejgrated report constructions:</page><page sequence="41">61 (53) T^icoyijJNHKTv we OTnoycTM oyNotuw- noKe^'fcK^ NH^AHHOAAoywe noK^kAOTH, raKO toko r/Ta kt* aan^ (Acts 23: 22, in the Christino- pol'skij Apóstol; Kahizniacki (ed.) 1896: 56).

Thus instances of integrated speech like excerpts (48)-(52) provide a further proof that the fundamental mechanism of indirectness was al- ready available in the earliest Slavic writings. 8. Conclusions The assumption that indirect speech either had not yet evolved or was in the process of doing so in OCS and early East Slavic has to be rejected, in view of the evidence provided by the texts themselves. Full-fledged, unambiguous indirect discourse, as defined by the univer- sal feature of reporter-oriented deixis, is attested in the oldest surviving South and East Slavic texts; thus there is no documentation whatsoever for a period in which it was not yet available as a compositional pat- tern. Even certain investigators who are aware of this fact seem reluc- tant to give it its due weight. For example, Lopatina (1979: 437) cor- rectly notes that "paralleFno s konstrukciej prjamoj reci uze v drevnej- sich russkich pamjatnikach dlja peredaci cuzoj reci upotrebljaetsja kon- strukcija kosvennoj reci"; however, she subsequently makes the irrecon- cilable assertion that "konstrukcija kosvennoj reci vtoricna i pojavlja- etsja v pamjatnikach pozdnee, cem konstrukcija prjamoj reci" (ibid.: 438). The aprioristic notion that indirect speech must have appeared later than direct (cf. also Otin 1969: 54) would seem to be based on the fol- lowing line of reasoning: since indirect speech is putatively a complex subordinated construction (for criticism of this view, see above), it must have emerged after the "simple" mode of direct speech, because the syntax of the Slavic languages has putatively evolved from paratactic simplicity to hypotactic complexity - an assumption reflected in numer- ous works on the subject. In fact, the syntax of the earliest attested forms of Slavic can scarcely be considered more "primitive" than that of the modern languages. Hypotactic and paratactic constructions have coexisted from the time of the earliest texts and, indeed, must have al- ready existed in Proto-Slavic and Proto-Indo-European. In general, the preference for one kind of structure over another in a given text or</page><page sequence="42">62 during a given period depends on stylistic and pragmatic factors (cf. Lakoff 1984); it is not a reflection of diachronic competition.77 More- over, one may note that the earliest Slavic texts contain hypotactic con- structions that are no longer possible in the modern languages, so that the development has, in some cases, been toward greater syntactic sim- plicity. Among these constructions are instances of fused reported speech or clause union involving semantically faded verba dicendi plus participles (nominativus and accusativus cum participio) and infinitives (accusativus cum infinitivo), as in the following passages:78 (54) h noR'kAddw6 ct* nhaaa bh/^bt* reoprura ONoro OTpoKd cTdro bo- pHca x^Ara^d CTk NH/Md h Nocraijid ck^ijjk» (The Tale of the Mir- acles of Roman and David, in the Uspenskij Sbornik; Kotkov (ed.) 1971: 61, fol. 19dll-15).

If full-fledged indirect speech were only inchoate in the earliest few centuries of Slavic literacy, it would be hard to account for the fact that its basic structure is the same in all the Slavic languages. There are, to be sure, certain trivial differences, such as the identity of the complementizer, but none of these alter the fundamental typological identity of the construction.79 Hence parallel development, while conceiv- able, would not be a particularly convincing explanation - especially in</page><page sequence="43">63 the case of the Sorbian languages, which have undergone heavy gram- matical interference from German (see, for example, Sewc-Schuster 1976, 2: 165-66).80 In this connection, it is important to note that indirect speech is at least a near-universal of language. While it is sometimes claimed that there are languages without some form of indirect speech sensu stricto (see Wierzbicka 1974: 271; Longacre 1983: 132; and Ro- maine and Lange 1991: 268), one wonders whether such assertions may not be based on insufficient fieldwork, on data drawn primarily from narrative texts, in which direct speech universally predominates, or on otherwise incomplete information.81 The rarity of indirect speech in the earliest texts cannot be taken as evidence that it was a new, as yet unassimilated reporting technique, pace Otin (1969) and other investigators, since it is likely to be an acci- dent of the attested contexts. As Longacre (1983: 132) observes, "There are... languages which while having both direct and indirect quotations in their surface structure, greatly prefer the latter"; he cites Biblical Hebrew as an example (ibid.). Likewise, Blass and Debrunner (1961: 195) note that there was a "very strong overall preference for direct discourse" in New Testament Greek: "Indirect discourse... is not at all congenial to the N[ew] T[estament] writers any more than it is to folk- narrators in general" (ibid.: 246).82 Therefore, since the earliest Slavic texts consist either of translations from Greek (and from Hebrew through Greek) or of imitations of such translations, the fact that they contain more cases of direct discourse than any other reporting strat- egy is scarcely probative - a fact that most of the previous investiga- tors of reported speech in early Slavic have, oddly enough, failed to consider. An analysis of reported speech that was not context-sensitive and made use of randomly selected texts might likewise conclude, equally erroneously, that indirect speech is rare or nonexistent in one of the modern Slavic languages. Indeed, Volosinov ([1929] 1986: 127) makes this very claim about Modern Russian: "On the whole, one must acknowledge the unqualified primacy of direct discourse in Russian. The history of the Russian language knows no Cartesian, rationalistic period, during which an objective 'authorial con- text', self-confident in its power of reason, had analyzed and dissected the referential structure of the speech to be reported and created com- plex and remarkable devices for the indirect transmission of language." It is impossible to agree with this extraordinary generalization, which seems to assume that direct speech and indirect speech cannot coexist</page><page sequence="44">64 without competing with one another. In fact, claims that are based on uncontextualized frequency cannot be considered probative, since the nonoccurrence of the given construction may simply reflect the absence of contexts in which it would be functionally appropriate from the viewpoint of the speakers or writers. It is anthropomorphic to discuss the "preference" of a language for one mode of reporting or for one syntactic construction over another; it is the speakers who prefer a given strategy, and then only in specific contexts and for particular purposes (cf. Lakoff 1984). Most of the early cases of direct speech in early Slavic texts function as prominent, sequenced events in the plotline of narrative texts; this is in accordance with the cross-linguistic tendency for direct speech to fore- ground important events in narrative (see above).83 As discussed above, direct discourse has the unique property of reenacting the viewpoint of the represented speaker in the represented speech event. The role-playing involved in direct speech explains the widespread and generally valid impression that the given technique is more "vivid" than other modes of reporting - in other words, that it is more likely to generate a high degree of involvement in the audience.84 This capacity results from the fact that direct speech makes greater demands on the reconstructive abilities of the interpreter than do the other reporting methods. Its he- terogeneous deictic orientation compels the interpreter to undergo the same experience as the reporter and become, in effect, a witness of the represented speech event. Romaine and Lange (1991: 267) state that "dialogue [framed as direct speech - DEC] creates involvement because it makes it possible for listeners to come closer to imagining the re- counted action or speech rather than hearing about it". This observa- tion is not strong enough; in reality, direct speech gives the interpreters no choice but to imagine the scene by imposing the perspective of the represented speaker upon them (see also Schiff rin 1981: 59-60; Tannen 1986: 325 and 1989: 17, 23 and passim). The inferential work involved in this role-playing inevitably slows the interpretation process; this delay, in combination with the use of contextually marked nonnarrative forms dependent on the perspective of the represented speaker, produces a foregrounding effect by making the reports stand out from the surround- ing discourse. While indirect speech resembles direct in maintaining the indepen- dent clausal structure of the report, it lacks the specific features that make direct discourse stand out from narrative as figure on ground. The fact that oratio obliqua maintains the perspective of the surround-</page><page sequence="45">65 ing text without any "gear-shifting" (Page 1988) ensures that it will be interpreted at about the same rate as its frame, though its independent clausal structure may perhaps retard the pacing of the discourse some- what more than fully integrated modes such as those in excerpts (54)-(57). Thus, as a category, indirect speech is less suitable for fore- grounding reports intended to be prominent than is the more intrusive form of direct speech. In the earliest Slavic texts, it forms part of a rep- ertory of linguistic devices such as participial tags and complement- izers that, alone or in combination, allow for different degrees of back- grounding, for diverse pragmatic effects. There can, of course, be various motivations for blending repre- sented speech into the surrounding discourse. As a rule, the likely con- textualizations for backgrounded reports are not prototypical for third- person narrative with a covert narrator. This scarcity of environments explains the relative rareness of oratio obliqua in OCS and the earliest East Slavic writings. Nevertheless, a thorough survey of the texts re- veals that indirect speech occurs regularly in certain recurrent contexts in which direct speech, conversely, is not typical. In particular, indirect speech is found when reports that are presupposed due to their prior occurrence in the discourse are restated not as topics in there own right but as reminders to the readers - that is, as a form of reorienta- tion needed for understanding the subsequent new information. The use of the pace-impeding form of direct speech in this context would be at cross-purposes with the overall communicative goal - to summarize in order to avoid distracting the reader from the main point., This is also true in the case of reports that, while not presupposed, are nonetheless strictly ancillary to the following, more prominent discourse.85 Like- wise, indirect speech and other integrative techniques are more appro- priate than direct speech when speech acts with stage-managing or procedural intent occur as one of a series of concisely represented events, since there is no particular reason to interrupt the flow of the narrative or to single out the reports for special attention. It may be noted that the use of less-than-direct forms of reporting in such con- texts is also typical in Old Russian texts of the Muscovite era (see Collins 1994), as well as in the modern Slavic languages and many others. The use of indirect speech in cases of multiple participation frame- works can overlap with the backgrounding and pace-maintaining func- tions mentioned above. The usual contextualization for reports of this kind is when overt reporters renarrate utterances that contain refer- ences either to themselves or to their addressees. As mentioned above,</page><page sequence="46">66 indirect discourse tends to be favored in such situations even in lan- guages that otherwise employ it hardly at all. Certainly one of the moti- vations for this typologically widespread, perhaps even universal ten- dency is to avoid the confusion that might be caused by mixing the deictic orientations of two separate speech events when a slower pace of interpretation, with its resultant foregrounding, does not subserve the communicative intentions of the reporter. In addition, the use of di- rect speech in such contexts is often at variance with such goals as controlling the construction of one's own identity. As mentioned above, direct speech places the interpreter on a witness-like footing. Reporters can use direct speech as a form of implicit, if not necessarily actual, self-suppression; by using the given frame, they can cede - or give the appearance of ceding - to their intended audience the responsibility of imposing meaning on the message thus conveyed.86 By contrast, report- ing modes like indirect speech that maintain the deictic orientation of the surrounding narrative permit the reporter to maintain a more expli- cit control of the interpretation.87 It is evident that reporters are espe- cially prone to this form of subjective reporting when they convey mes- sages in which they themselves or any elements or participants of their current frame of reference are invoked, since they can thereby avoid having to renegotiate their footing in the ongoing conversational en- counter. In this sense, at least, one may well question whether direct speech is actually the "simplest" and "most basic" form of reporting, as is of- ten said - a hypothesis based, in part, on the untenable assumption that oratio recta is an inherently verbatim mode. Why should indirect speech be "complex", when it represents nothing more than holding steady to the reference points of the surrounding text? Indirect speech has fre- quently been conceptualized as the result of a shift from putatively un- derlying direct speech, i.e., as the result of a conversion or transforma- tion of direct speech. However, the use of indirect speech when the re- porter or addressee is invoked in the report suggests that, in some contexts, at least, the opposite is the case. As Ebert (1986: 157) obser- ves, "It is when the narrator presents another person's cognitive act as 'direct speech' that he has to change his perspective: he has to put him- self in the other person's place. Thus from a pragmatic point of view it is the 'direct' speech that is shifted".

A full survey of the vast typological literature on reported speech is beyond the scope of this study. 2 See, in particular, Philips 1985; Silverstein 1985, 1993; Tannen 1986, 1989: 98-133; J. Collins 1987; Johnstone 1987; and Romaine and Lange 1991. 3 The citations from Marianus are usually also found, with only minor differences, in the other OCS and recensional Gospels. Therefore, the conclusions that I draw on the basis of this one manuscript are, generally speaking, valid for its counterparts as well. 4 This is the case in Vondrák 1912, Lehr-Spíawiñski and Bartula 19594, and Vail- lant 19642, to name just a few. 5 See, for example, Lunt 19746: 144; Vecerka 1984: 195-96; and Duridanov (ed.) 1991: 479-87. 6 It seems doubtful that there is any legitimate syntactic reason in Slavic to distin- guish indirect questions, at least, from other forms of indirect speech; they are distinct from indirect statements in precisely the same way that main-clause questions are dis- tinct from main-clause declarations. In this, Slavic differs from Ancient and New Tes- tament Greek, where there could be modal differences, and from languages in which interrogative modality is reflected in a special grammatical mood. 7 Mutalimova (1984: 94) asserts that complementized direct speech is rare in OCS: "V rassmatrivaemych pamjatnikach [Suprasliensis and Dobromirovo Evangelie - DEC] vstrecajutsja edinicnye slucai, kogda prjamaja ree' s sochraneniem vsech ee formal 'no-grammaticeskich priznakov prisoedinjaetsja k slovam adresanta s pomosc'ju sojuza jako... Delo v torn, cto takogo tipa predlozenija dejstvitel'no esce redki v anali- ziruemych tekstach, no oni vstrecajutsja, pricem vstrecajutsja v pamjatnikach i bolee rannego perioda". It is difficult to agree with Mutalimova's view that complementized direct speech is "isolated" and "rare", unless one uses an extreme standard to measure frequency of occurrence. By my observations, complementized direct speech is quite common in the OCS Gospels, the Codex Suprasliensis, and the somewhat later Dobro- mirovo Evangelie; indeed, it occurs with about the same frequency in these Slavonic texts as the equivalent phenomenon does in their Greek originals. A number of investigators with functional or typological orientations argue co- gently that the varieties of reported speech form a continuum, of which direct and in- direct speech are not even the poles. See McHale 1978: 258-60; Leech and Short 1981: 324; Tannen 1986: 323; Page 1988: 35; Hickmann 1993: 66-67; and Collins 1994. 9 Even though the words "kakie stilistiõeskie celi stavit pered soboj avtor povestvo- vanija" suggest that this study has a pragmatic approach, Mutalimova (1984) does not, in fact, examine the functions or contextualizations of the reporting strategies</page><page sequence="48">68 that she discusses. Rather, she associates the "stylistic" function of a reporting strat- egy with the effect produced by individual words (e.g., forms of address or emotive vocabulary) that, in her view, may be conveyed in it - a problematic criterion, since it assumes proscriptions that cannot be tested. Mutalimova is not concerned with the effect(s) that the properties of the technique as a whole may have when combined with different kinds of enframing contexts. 10 The term tag {tagging device) is used here, as in recent narratological studies (e.g., Shapiro 1984), to denote a formal unit belonging to the authorial context, the primary function of which is to attribute or otherwise index reported speech ("quota- tion-deictics"; Fónagy 1986: 262, 264). The most widespread kind of tags are clauses that include verba dicendi ("inquit clauses"). 11 See, for example, Molotkov 1958: 27; Stecenko 1960: 233-35; Sprincak 1964: 119-25; Otin 1969: 54-55; and Lopatina 1979: 438-39, 445-46. The most extreme ex- pression of this view may be found in Bulachovskij (19585: 415-16), who asserts that indirect speech did not stabilize in Russian until the eighteenth century, under the influence of Latin and German models and the study of classical grammar and rheto- ric. One may well think these languages to be an odd influence on the stability of Russian indirect speech, considering 1) that indirect speech in Latin and German tends to feature consecutio temporum (tense-backshifting); 2) that indirect speech in German and Ancient Greek tends to feature nonindicative mood; and 3) that infiniti- val constructions are a widespread form of nondirect reporting in the classical langu- ages. In other words, the only property that Russian indirect speech shares with the comparable phenomena in German, Latin, and Ancient Greek is the shift of deictic pivot. In any case, careful examination of medieval documents shows that indirect speech already existed in fifteenth-century Russian - and undoubtedly even earlier - in as stable a form as in the twentieth-century literary language (see Collins 1994). 12 See, for example, Otin 1969; Molotkov 1962: 189-92; and Lopatina 1979: 434-37, 444. 13 See Bulachovskij 19585: 415; Sprincak 1964: 123; and Otin 1969: 55. On slip- ping in Old Russian, see also Lopatina 1979: 445-46. 14 The term original speech situation makes no claim about the actuality of the re- port; rather, it refers to the frame of reference in which the represented speech act purportedly occurred, or, when the report is inset in a nonpast frame, the one in which it is supposed to be happening or in which it is predicted to take place in the future. 15 See, for example, Munro 1982: 303; Haiman and Thompson 1984: 520; Coulmas 1986: 2-3; Li 1985: 30-34; Palmer 1986: 163-65; and Roncador 1988. 16 Note that, in reported speech within reported speech, the authorial context is it- self an inset in a frame. For example, in the sentence "Hattie said to Hilary, 'Victor told me he thought it would be a pity if you ran away from him'", the deixis of the re- port within the single quotations, which is direct speech inset in a third-person frame, is oriented toward the speech situation in which Hattie is talking with Hilary rather than toward the one within the double quotation marks (the narration in which the women's conversation is being recounted). Thus the first-person form 'me' refers to</page><page sequence="49">69 Hattie, the represented reporter, while Victor, the represented speaker within Hattie's report, is in the third person because he is a nonparticipant in Hattie's conversation with Hilary. On the other hand, the report within the report ("'... he thought it would be a pity if you ran away from him'") is indirect, corresponding to a direct quotation of the form "I think it would be a pity if she ran away from me". Thus this second layer of reporting is oriented not toward the speech situation that represents, in which Victor is talking with Hattie, but toward the speech situation in which Hattie is talk- ing with Hilary. Hence the third-person form 'he' is a shift from a first-person pro- noun coreferential with Victor, while the second-person form 'you' refers neither to Hattie, Victor's represented addressee, nor to the addressee of the passage in the double quotation marks (the reader of this footnote; "exophoric reference", cf. Brecht 1974: 489-94 and passim), but to Hilary, the addressee of the represented reporter. Like- wise, since indirect speech in English involves backshifting, the present tense of the report within the report ("think") is shifted to the past tense ("thought") in order to agree with the represented reporter's viewpoint. 17 As Haberland (1986: 238) notes with reference to Danish and other languages, for time and place deixis the change of pivot tends to be subject to production con- straints: "[T]he choice between a shifted element and a nonshifted element seems to depend on the ease with which the deictic shift can be accomplished". 18 This case of backshifting presumably imitates its Greek original, which likewise has a preterite verb: "... idontes hoi Aiguptioi ten gunaika autou, hoti kalê en spho- dra" (Brenton (ed.) [n.d.] 1970: 14). This excerpt from the Slavonic Book of Genesis is taken from HM.SMS.279, a late-fifteenth-century Pentateuch of Moldavian origin. This manuscript, which belongs to the Hilandar Monastery on Mount Athos, is avail- able on microfilm in the Hilandar Research Library, The Ohio State University (see Matejic and Thomas 1992: 441). I would like to thank the monks of Hilandar Mona- stery for their generosity in providing microform access to this and many other invalu- able resources. The Slavonic version of the Book of Genesis is of late attestation; I am assuming that the passage cited, which follows the text of the Septuagint closely, is syntactically conservative. 19 On the use of tenses in Russian indirect speech and in object clauses after verbs of cognition and perception, see Costello 1961; Brecht 1974, 1975; and Comrie 1985: 107-17. For cross-linguistic studies of backshifting, see, for example, Jespersen [1924] 1992: 292-95; Coulmas 1986: 14-16; and Haberland 1986: 239-41. The pre- sence of backshifting in French, German, English, and other Western European lan- guages misled some early investigators such as Jespersen ([1924] 1992: 293-94) into thinking that it was a "natural" or "inevitable" feature of indirect speech; by the same token, the lack of consecutio temporum in Russian was considered a symptom of indi- rect speech being poorly developed in that language (see Peskovskij 19567: 485-86; Volosinov [1929] 1986: 126-27). In fact, sporadic examples of backshifting may be found in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Russian, perhaps under the influence of French or German syntax - for example, in Chapter 1 of Puskin's Kapitanskaja docka ([1836] 19572: 395): "On toteas potreboval kanal'ju francuza. Dolozili, cto mus'e daval mne svoj urok". The subsequent context makes it clear that the lesson is supposed to be in progress, so that the coreferential present is expected instead of the preterit. Sporadic cases of backshifting can also be found in spoken Modern Russian.</page><page sequence="50">70 In Tikar (Benue-Congo, Cameroon), the complementizer Is is mandatory with direct speech, but optional with indirect, as defined by shifts in deictic orientation (Li 1986:35-36). Pace Lopatina (1979: 444-45), who cites a few sixteenth- and seventeenth-cen- tury examples as "redkie slucai", uncomplementized indirect speech is fairly common in Old Russian writings. See also Collins 1994: 344-46, 446-55, 511-20. 22 Among Schuelke's (1958: 91, 93) examples of slipping in Old Icelandic and Modern English are cases in which "[t]he entire quoted section is direct with its only relation to indirect presentation contained in the word that" (ibid.: 91) - in other words, examples of complementized direct speech. The proximal demonstrative sej is used exophorically in excerpt (6) (K ceM CFlHCK'fc) whereas in (4) and (5) it can be either exophoric or endophoric. 24 Cf. the following examples of direct speech from early-nineteenth-century En- glish: "After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time with - 'It is your turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. / talked about the dance, and you ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the room, or the number of couples" (Austen [1813] 1926: chapter 18); "There were some very strong objections against the lady', were Colonel Fitzwilliam's words" (ibid.: chapter 33). 25 Topicalizing clauses that assert that a speech act occurred are also attested; these are typically framed as complementized indirect speech with a preposed tag, as in the following passage: "Ce ra3, KN(ra)3k kg/ukih Hkünt* KdCH/tieKHH(b), nowd/tWKd* ec/MH MroyAteNd CnHpHAONid CeprHGKd AtdNdCTTsjpra 3 Bpa^^ew- Htw aw KM* HG/WV*1, d CKdS'hIKdG'1*, HTW ^GH CKGpTTdKdW^ 3 KOrtWHG ^OpOrH CT* C/tOKOAnKH6 BCAKCk 63^0KH Nd H* /MdNdCTTKip6K Nd NmKO/'8 Nd ^GpWrHNd, Ad Nd C/tOßOAKOY Nd HgHGKKHNS, &amp;&lt;' CTdKA^d A^H K T0M /UdNdCTTvipK* H K AePeßNraX, Ad H KOp/UT*!

[Zalovannaja gramota of 1467-1474; Grekov and Õerepnin (eds.) 1952-1964, vol. 1: 260, no. 354). 6 The fact that explicit direct and indirect speech can occur in various kinds of clauses, both dependent and independent, leads A. Dömötör to note that "there are as many categories of reported sentences as subordinate clauses in Hungarian. Reported sentences may function as an object clause, a subject clause, a predicate clause, an attributive clause, an adverbial clause or as an apposition..." (cited in Fónagy 1986: 260). This observation can be extended to other languages. It is sometimes posited (e.g., by Mutalimova 1984: 92) that only indirect speech functions as a direct object, while direct speech is syntactically independent. How- ever, as Haiman and Thompson (1984: 520) point out, it is theoretically ill-grounded to assume that a given verbum dicendi would be more transitive with indirect speech than with direct. 28 Similar examples of intercalated and postposed tags may be found in early East Slavic texts. Pace Molotkov (1958: 30-31), they are not rare, nor is there any evi- dence that they developed later than preposed tags. 29 However, as Volosinov ([1929] 1971: 177-78), Haiman and Thompson (1984: 519-520) and Sternberg (1982b: 108-9, 1991: 64) cogently argue, all reported speech</page><page sequence="51">71 is communicatively subordinated to its context. 30 On intercalated verba dicendi in Old Russian of the Muscovite period, see also Collins 1994: 465-71, 531-49. By the same token, it cannot be interpreted as a nascent form of style indirect li- bre, since it is neither indirect nor free (unbound), pace Uspenskij (1973: 33-36). 32 Cf. the following passage from the Life of Feodosij Pecerskij in the Uspenskij Sbomik: "H BrtdWGNOAAOy -O-eO^OCHK» ATKNOrO TOrO AAOAHKTsllJW- I3K0 Ad N6 pd3/'0yHHTH CA M/Wd A^NT^G^Ke »6CTd KT* n/t*kTH- H N6 W^X^A"™ ^/WOy WT Nl€ro" (Kotkov (ed.) 1971: 124, fol. 60cl0-15). For further early instances of jako da, see ibid.: 97, fol. 42c6-13; ibid: 121, fol. 58a29-32; and Acts 25: 3, in the Christino- pol'skij Apóstol (Kaíuzniacki (ed.) 1896: 59; excerpt (47)). 33 In using a comparative relative, the Slavonic jako recitativum is more strictly comparable to the Greek nos recitativum than to the more widespread hoti recitati- vum, although it is used to translate both these constructions. Hõs is translated by jako in the Codex Marianus in Luke 22: 61 (Jagic (ed.) [1883] 1960: 301-2; and in the ChristinopoPskij Apóstol in Acts 10: 28, 37-38 (Kahizniacki (ed.) 1896: 24-25), Romans 1: 9 (ibid.: Ill), Romans 11: 2 (ibid.: 128), Philippians 1: 9 (ibid.: 198), and 1 Thessalonians 2: 10-11 (ibid.: 211). It is translated by kako in Luke 6: 3-4 (Jagic (ed.) [1883] 1960: 215) and Acts 20: 18-20 (Katuzniacki (ed.) 1896: 48). The pleo- nastic hõs hoti is also translated by jako, see 2 Corinthians 5: 18-19 (ibid.: 169) and 11:21 (ibid.: 176). 34 Here one may include certain cases that are ambiguous due to specific features of OCS grammar. For example, it is impossible to determine whether the following re- port is direct or indirect because of the syncretism of the second- and third-person singular aorist in OCS: "llO/MdBddXft &gt;K6 OT'klJW ero- KdKO EM XST'krt'h Ndpe- UJTH 6" (Luke 1: 62, in the Codex Marianus; Jagic (ed.) [1883] 1960: 194). The Greek original happens to have a third-person optative, so that the reported question is indirect: "eneneuon de tõi patri autou to ti an theloi kaleisthai auto" (Nestle and Nestle (eds.) 193014: 142). As mentioned above, in cases of reported speech within reported speech, the "ac- tual speech situation" should be understood as the represented speech situation that enframes the report. The term participation framework denotes the configuration of the participants in the speech act, in accordance with Goffman's (1981: 137) definition: "[I]f one starts with a particular individual in the act of speaking... one can describe the role or function of all the several members of the encompassing social gathering from this point of reference... The relation of any one such member to this utterance can be called his 'participation status' relative to it, and that of all the persons in the gather- ing the 'participation framework' for that moment of speech". This, of course, can be the case even when the narrators identify themselves at some point in the text, as in the Gospel of John. As Sternberg (1985: 72) observes, perspectivai complexity is a general charac- teristic of psalmic discourse: "The Psalter... operates with a whole range of selves,</page><page sequence="52">72 voices, viewpoints, personae, situational contexts of utterance. Some Psalms are attri- buted, or even anchored in space and time, and others emerge from nowhere. Some are soliloquies, others appeals, and still others dialogues. Some speak with one voice, others with many voices; some in the voice of the individual, others of the collective". 39 However, even in the earliest Slavic texts, citations of authorities do not have to be reported verbatim; cf. the following fused reports based on Matthew 26: 71-72: "H/MdWH nerpa HW6 pdK'fc RTvlipdllJAWllJTH W 0yHHT6/'H OThKpbHte CA Ch KrtATKOto N63Ndtë/tta 6rO CTvTKOpM- H /lltKhNOtt pOTOW OKATd" (Izbomik of 1076; Kotkov (ed.) 1965: 551, fol. 201r4-8). The models of these reports are framed as direct speech (see Jagic (ed.) [1883] 1960: 104). Cf. also the following highlycon- densed and unbound infinitival reports, also from the Izbornik of 1076, which sum- marize various scriptural admonitions: "NT* AKO &gt;K6 peM6: /l/KKHTH Fd H B/tH- &gt;KhNAdrO- CTwWfepHTH CA Tpbri'fcTH CK'kpKH- KpOT'kKOy KTilTM H /MHphNHKOy- SriOB'KI N6 Aph&gt;KATH N6 OCOyWATH NHKOrO &gt;K6- NH rt'krdTM" (Kotkov 1965: 555, fol. 203r3-9). Likewise, in service books like the Euchologium Sinaiticum, ad- dressee-reports attributed to God can also be framed as fused reported speech or as narrative reports of speech acts. These modes of reporting are especially frequent in the preambles to the prayers, in which divine attributes and actions, including speech acts, are conveyed as background information to the subsequent requests: "IXocflO^I K&lt;O&gt;&gt;K6 NdWT*, KbSK^LJJeH OyHeNHKO/MT* CKOM/UTv N6 C'hrp'kUJ'klJUd pOK^LUd ca crt'kna, nh po^HTe/tw ero, nt* ^Ms. pa^M E&lt;o&gt;&gt;KeH i tokoitK [sic]..." (Eucholoigum Sinaiticum; Frcek (ed.) 1933-1939, part 1: 726, fol. 32b); fT&lt;0Cn0A&gt;l Hc&lt;oy&gt;X&lt;PkCT&gt;6 K&lt;o&gt;H&lt;e hüuj^, aanoK^dK^i rMbThNiti/Mh i c&lt;rK&gt;n&lt;d&gt;crh- Nlvl/Mb N6 CKßp'KNHTH CA H&lt;/'OKrfe&gt;KOy KO K^X^A^^HM^" ßT^ OyCTd..." (ibid.: 694, fol. 19b). Fused reported speech and narrative reports of speech acts allow the report to be reduced considerably; hence they are well-suited for the representation of presupposed messages, in which reduction of form does not entail much risk of misin- terpretation (see also Collins 1994: passim). The evident motive for this disclaimer is a principle established elsewhere in the Gospels and known to readers familiar with the texts - "If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true" (John 5:31, KJV). As Longacre points out (1976: 10), "A discourse must not only have cohesion but prominence. If all parts of a discourse are equally prominent, total unintelligibility results. The result is like being presented with a piece of black paper and being told, 'This is a picture of black camels crossing black sands at midnight'. Prominence is achieved in many ways in a discourse: by nominalizing some clauses or making them dependent clauses and thus highlighting the independent clause, by topicalization on the sentence level, by marking of theme and/or thematic participant on the paragraph level, by devices that distinguish on-the-line from off-the-line information, and by marking of paragraph and discourse peaks" (Longacre 1976: 10). On salience (pro- minence) as a linguistic concept, see also Wallace (1982: 211-16). 42 It is generally accepted that the complements of verbs of saying, like those of other "nonfactive" verbs, do not necessarily have a presupposed truth value (see Ki- parsky and Kiparsky 1970: 147-48; Givón 1980: 344-45). However, this does not im- ply that such complements cannot themselves consist of presupposed information. 43 See Goffman 1981: 126, 128, 150-52; Collins 1994: 400-401, 402-3, 433. The</page><page sequence="53">73 term footing is used in Goffman's sense, to indicate "the social capacities in which the persons present claim to be active" in the dialogue (1981: 126). I am not claiming that indirect speech is invariably connected with background- ing; I am simply suggesting that its properties make it well-suited for that function. It is an overgeneralization to set up one-to-one correspondences between the formal varieties of reported speech and specific functions. As Sternberg (1982b: 148) co- gently argues, speech reporting is governed by a "Proteus Principle": "In different contexts - reporting frames as well as nonreporting frameworks - the same form may fulfill different functions and different forms the same function". The fact that complementizers help to maintain or accelerate the pace of inter- pretation is surely apparent to anyone who has read medieval manuscripts with mini- mal punctuation and no word-spacing. 46 On the roles of the animator and the principal in speech representation, see Goffman 1981: 144-45. As was noted above, reports of questions and commands differ from what is more generally called reported speech - i.e., reports of declarative utterances - only in that they are representations of distinct sentence-types. Therefore, they must be regarded as subtypes of the same general category (mimesis of speech events), with the same kind of syntactic relation to the tag clauses and the surrounding narrative. 48 In the Greek passage the complement of the verb of commanding is a passive in- finitive rather than a clause with a finite verb, as in the OCS translation. Cf. also indirect questions that are not renarrations - for example, the following report from Novgorodian birchbark letter no. 424, stratigraphically dated to the first quarter of the twelfth century: "d/'H N6 H^eTe d npHCT^TG [sic] AtH rpdAtOTHHy CTOpOBH AH eCT6" (Zaliznjak 1995: 248). Here the notion of communication is im- plicit in the textual conveyor gramotica. The aorist nOK'fc^d in excerpt (25) can be either second or third person; how- ever, the context rules out the latter reading. There is no possibility that the report that Pharaoh ascribes to Abram is framed as direct speech; since the reader has already been informed that Sarai is the wife of Abram, not Pharaoh, the pronoun TH cannot refer to Abram 's represented addressee. Cf. also the following passage from the same chapter of Genesis: "p6H[6] dBpd** Cdprk KGN'k CB06H- H BHA'fc [sic] d3*h ta KO ^OKpd 6CH &gt;K6Nd K AHIJ6- KYAeX *YB0 erAd *YkhAaX ernnTANe, m peKy^ raKO weNd ecH 6M$ OyBbW'1' AAA- d T6B6 ROHAiyTh- pi^H OyBO fdKO CGCTpd 6AA&amp; eCAtb- &amp;A H AtN'fc AOBpO b8a6TK T6B6 pdAH" (Genesis 12: 11-13; HM.SMS.279, 12r21-12v2). Once again, this use of indirect speech in renarrations replicates the tendency in everyday dialogue and in quasi-dyadic texts like epistles, which featuring an overt, controlling first-person perspective. Cf. the following report from the ChristinopoFskij Apóstol: "TH KO 0 NdCTv K^ljJdWTh, KdKOKT* KT^X^Vk HAA'kx^Tv K^ KdATh, H KdKO OKpdTHCTG CA WT KOyMHpT* KT' BKH, pdBOTdTH BOy *KHBOy H HCTH- NbNOy" (1 Thessalonians 1: 9; Kahizniacki (ed.) 1896: 210). The fact that the report is framed as an indirect question must be viewed as a reductive strategy, since it is</page><page sequence="54">74 not a representation of an interrogative speech-act or sentence-type. 53 The same use of indirect speech to avoid competing deictic orientations can be found in the converse contextual ization - autoreferential third-person statements that make no reference to either the reporter or the addressee, e.g., "pene &gt;K6 lldBb/t'K: Mount* oyso xpc™^ ram* XP1^6""^ Na noKdraNHre, /tw^k/WT* rvfra, kt*. rpAAoyijJdro no h'gmk &amp;à BrèpoywTb, cnp'kHh, kt* )(Fd W?á" (Acts 19: 4, in the Christinopol'skij Apóstol; Katuzniacki (ed.) 1896: 45). It seems probable that indi- rect reporting would also occur in cases in which renarrated third-person statements refer to the addressees; however, I did not find any clear-cut examples of this situation in the sources that I investigated. The following passage from the Christino- pol'skij Apóstol is ambiguous: "dl|J6... K^HH/VOyTb &gt;K6 N6pd30yAtHBHH HAH NGB'kpNHH, N6 p6K0yTh /tH, raKO 3AH CA A^Te?" (1 Corinthians 14: 23; Ka- fuzniacki (ed.) 1896: 157). It is impossible in principle to determine whether the hy- pothetical report introduced by Ne peKOyTh /'H is direct speech with the jako recita- tivum or complementized indirect speech, since the writer does not state whether his own addressees are also the addressees of the represented speech act. The passages from the Acts and Epistles quoted in excerpt (26) and elsewhere in the article are not attested in the earliest surviving Slavonic version, the Eninski Apo- stol-Aprakos (see Mircev and Kodov (eds.) 1965: 258). The Christinopol'skij Apó- stol, one of the earliest surviving Reading Apostles, dates from the twelfth century and is of Rus'ian (Galician) provenience. Direct speech is also found in the superficially similar case of requotations in which the represented speaker is neither the reporter nor his addressee - for example, excerpt (1), above, and the similar passage in Matthew 26: 61 (ibid.: 103); cf. also Matthew 27: 43 (ibid.: 109). Here the maintenance of the represented speaker's deictic orientation does not present any overt risk of perspectivai ambiguity. 56 The renarrated report "AOKp'k pene *kKO /UÄWd Ne H/Vtd/UV in excerpt (28) is adduced by Matveeva-Isaeva (1958: 182) as an illustration of the notion that direct and indirect speech were not yet fully distinct in OCS. In fact, given that the Slavonic translation follows the Greek original closely in the given passage, one could as well argue on the same basis that direct and indirect speech were not yet fully distinct in Greek - a historically ungrounded hypothesis. In fact, the report in question is framed as clear-cut complementized direct speech. Cf. the following instance of a metalinguistic echo of the preceding dialogue, which is framed as direct speech: "P^liJA &gt;K6 OTT* oyH6NHKT' ero KT* ceK'k- HTO eCTT* Ce 6&gt;K6 rvfeTT* Nd/ttTv- ET* MaA*b H Ne KH^HTe /M6N6- I ndKTvl RT* A'&lt;'Awk H Oy3hpHT6 AtA I 'tiKO H^ KT* OTl^W- r/TddX^ W6 HTO eCTT* C6 6&gt;K6 r/TeTTv Els. MdA'k- N6 B'b/Mb HTO T/TeTV (John 16: 17-18, in the Codex Marianus; Jaeic [1883] 1960: 382). 58 See Wierzbicka 1974: 272; Goffman 1981: 149-52; Tannen 1983: 365 and 1989: 125; Fónagy 1986: 255; and Haberland 1986: 220-21. 59 See, for example, Larson 1978: 60-75, 183; Tannen 1983: 364; Philips 1985: 169; and Li 1986: 40. Lopatina (1979: 445) likewise regards direct discourse in Rus'ian and Old Russian senso stricto as a way of foregrounding reports: "Konstrukcija prja-</page><page sequence="55">75 moj reci, sochranjaja cuzuju ree' bez izmenenija, tern samym aktualiziruet ee v okru- iajuSòem tekste". 60 As mentioned above, the use of a complementizer is not an inherent property of the category; hence the fact that different complementizers were used in the earliest texts than in later stages of the Slavic languages is irrelevant to the question of when and how indirect speech developed. One may note a more or less general tendency to replace subordination markers derived from relatives with ones derived from interrog- atives; however, this purely formal development is reflected in other kinds of syntactic relations as well. 61 The Greek original of this passage in the Septuagint (at least, in the version available to me) has an infinitival construction rather than direct speech: "Kai eipe tou eksolothreusai autous, ei më Mouses ho eklektos autou este en tei thrausei enõpion autou, tou apostrepsai apo thumou orges autou, tou me eksolothreusai" (Brenton (ed.) [n.d.] 1970:763). 62 Slipping is also attested from direct speech into reporting modes that are even more reduced than indirect discourse - for example, infinitival reports of directive speech acts: "H c NHAtH 'kA™ noKea'fcKdiije haak u?t 6pc/tAtd Ne /'oy&gt;KHT6 ce, Nh &gt;KA4TH OK'kTOBdNH'k WTHd, 6K6 C/tTvlWdCTe 8 /W6N6I ^KO HOKdNK BEO KpCTH KOAOW, KTvl &gt;K6 KpkCTHCT6 C6 AX*^ CTH/Wb N6 Í1Ô /MNOS'fcx^ AÑexi* CHXb" (Acts 1: 4-5, in the ChristinopoPskij Apóstol; Kaíuzniacki (ed.) 1896: 1). This passage features a switch from direct speech into the infinitival mode of re- porting and then back again. Its Greek original begins as with an infinitival report, then slips into direct speech: "kai sunalizomenos parëggeilen autois apo Ierosolumõn më chôrizesthai, alla perimenein tën epaggelian tou patros hën ëkousate mou" (Acts 1: 4; Nestle and Nestle (eds.) 193014: 297). For a slip from an infinitival construction to direct speech, see Luke 5: 14 in the Codex Marianus (Jagic (ed.) [1883] 1960: 211); from indirect speech to an infinitival report, see Mark 6: 8-9 (ibid.: 135). 63 Some investigators choose to leave constructions of this kind out of their accounts of reported speech. For example, Partee (1973: 411) states, "My only justification for this... exclusion (since intractability is not a justification) is the admittedly preju- diced belief that such sentences do not occur in ordinary spoken language". In fact, sentences with slipping are widespread in ordinary spoken English (the language discussed by Partee) and in the colloquial strata of other languages. See, for example, Koduchov (1955: 136-40), Peskovskij (19567: 485), Vinogradov and Istrina (eds.) (1960: 413-14), and Lopatina (1979: 446-47) on Modern Russian; Borkovskij (1981: 222-30) on dialectal Russian and Belorussian; Schuelke (1958) and Tannen (1986: 314 and 1989: 117-18) on English; Haberland (1986: 230-31) on Danish; and Fónagy (1986: 276-77) on Hungarian and French. 64 The OCS canon provides examples of slipping that have other motivations - e.g., Luke 19: 9 in the Codex Marianus: "Pene &gt;K6 KT* N6/VA0y MCK- 'feKO AbN6Cb CÏÏC6NH6 A$M$Y TKOe/MOy B'klCrk- 3dN6 H Ck CNTK áKQàáMAK 6CTV (Jagic (ed.) [1883] 1960: 284). This in turn reflects a change of reporting techniques in the original Greek: "kathoti kai autos huios Abraam [estin]" (Nestle and Nestle (eds.) 193014: 207). In this example, the change from (complementized) direct speech to indirect speech - or, alternatively, direct speech with a change of addressee - is well motivated in the context; the represented speaker is evidently portrayed turning from</page><page sequence="56">76 his initial addressee, Zacchaeus, and responding to the amazement of the onlookers, who are mentioned in the preceding and following passages. Thus, the boldfaced re- port examplifies what Goffman (1981: 134) calls "crossplay" - "communication be- tween ratified participants and bystanders across the boundaries of the dominant en- counter". For other reports that feature a change of ratified participants in mid-stream, see Matthew 9: 6 in the Codex Marianus (Jagió (ed.) [1883] 1960: 25); Mark 2: 10 (ibid.: 121); and Luke 5: 24 (ibid.: 212-13). 65 Some of the Greek Gospel manuscripts have first-person heõraka 'I have seen', which implies complementized direct speech (Nestle and Nestle (eds.) 193014: 293). 66 Cf. also the use of a relative clause as a condensing device in the following indi- rect report of a prohibition: "CkX^AAUITe/WT* we HATh C*K ropu- Sdnp'feTH M/UT* Ad NHK0/W0y&gt;K6 N6 nOK^AATT* ^6 RH^UJA- TTvK/MO eV^á CHTK M/AKHCK^IH KTiCKpTjXNGTTi H3 /VtpTvTKTJXV (Mark 9: 9, in the Codex Marianus; Jagic (ed.) [1883] 1960:149). 67 The use of direct speech in this second quotation may be viewed as a foreground- ing strategy, motivated not only by the identity of the represented speaker but also by the fact that the quotation explicates the healing and reinforces one of the central messages of the Gospel narrative. This example is also interesting as a rare early example of postposition of the tag clause with complementized reported speech. Cf. also the following passage from the Izbornik of 1076: "... »e&gt;K6 CTdN^/MT* A^BP'b CKKd3d»eTb" (Kotkov (ed.) 1965: 457, fol. 100r9-10); or from Suprasliensis, "NT* raKO noc/toywdTM M/WdTe NdtU6ro OyH6Nhra- N6 ílbptt- K^A* SO KdUJe nOKOpeNHie" (John Chrysostom's sermon on the Resurrection; Supr 495.3-5; Zaimov and Capaldo (eds.) 1982-1983, vol. 2: 451, fol. 495, 11. 3-5). Given cases like these, it is impossible to agree with Mutalimova's assertion (1984: 96) that the tag clause is always preposed in the oldest Bulgarian texts. (Mutalimova's study is limited to the Codex Suprasliensis and the Dobromirovo Evangelic However, postposition is attested in the latter in Luke 8: 47, the parallel to excerpt (36); see Velöeva (ed.) 1975: 165, 1. 62a.) It is clear that the postposition (or intercalation) of the tag in the cited examples is motivated by topical ization of the re- port. 69 The Slavonic passage shows an ambiguity in the reported question in verse 15, owing to the syncretism of the second- and third-person singular aorist; the Greek has indirect discourse. On formal grounds, the reports in (40) and (41) are to be classified as indirect questions, even though the speech acts being represented are probably not interroga- tive. For fast-paced narrative that features a similar use of indirect commands, re- quests, and questions in nondyadic contexts, see the following representative passages in the Codex Marianus: Matthew 16: 20-23 (Jagic (ed.) [1883] 1960: 56-57); Mark 6: 8-9 (ibid.: 135); Mark 8: 22-23 (ibid.: 146); Mark 13: 34 (ibid.: 171) and Luke 19: 15 (ibid.: 285, both represented commands within reported speech. For represen- tative cases in East Slavic texts, see Acts 25: 2-5 in the Christinopol'skij Apóstol (Kafuzniacki (ed.) 1896: 59); or the following passages from the Uspenskij Sbornik:</page><page sequence="57">77 fol. 29al9-25 (Kotkov (éd.) 1971: 76); fol. 4ícl7-25 (ibid.: 95-96); and 59bl2-17 (ibid.: 122). 72 Cf. the following example from the Life of Feodosij Pecerskij in the Uspenskij Sbornik: "no CHX" &gt;K6 BftcTKbNTJH -O^eW^OCHH UJe^/K KT* Je^HNOAtOy Wx KOy3- NkL^h- nOKGA'k töAAOy &gt;KG/rk30 rkMeílMTO CTsKOKdTH- HW6 H KTvSbAiT* H Hp6- noracd ca H/Mh kt* npecAd CKora h TdKO x*WdUJ6" (Kotkov (ed.) 1971: 78, fol. 30b26-32). The fulfillment of the reported directive (nOBe/fk reAAOy &gt;K6/rb30 CTv- HenHTO rhKOKdTH) is implicit in the following relative clause (H&gt;K6 H KT^hAATs H npenoracd CA); the referent of the head of this relative belongs, properly speaking, to the world of represented discourse (*Ke/ffc30). Examples of this kind illustrate the often fuzzy boundary between reported speech and narrative in the earliest Slavic texts. Cf. the following passage, in which an indirect report is juxtaposed with a direct one: "I np'kqJddX^ GAAOy AA'hNOSH &amp;á OyAAA'kHHTTv ONT* &gt;K6 H3AHX4 KT*- rwkwe* effe AAK^'A01^ nOAAHAOyH AAA" (Mark 10: 48, in the Codex Marianus; Jagic (ed.) [1883] 1960: 158). Here an indeterminate number of prohibitive speech acts by faceless speakers are coalesced for the sake of economy into a single indirect command. By contrast, the blind beggar Bartimaeus is depicted making an equally indeterminate number of pleas (cf. the imperfect tag-verb KT^nH'fcllie), which, though coalesced into a single represented utterance, are framed as direct speech. The prohi- bitions clearly do not stand in a dyadic relation to Bartimaeus' cries; the beggar is simply ignoring them in his attempts to initiate dialogue with someone else. The use of direct speech here is clearly motivated by foregrounding. Bartimaeus' statements have messianic content; moreover, as a named speaker he himself is prominent in the discourse. For a similar indirect report of a prohibition in fast-paced narrative, see Mark 7: 36 in the Codex Marianus (Jagic (ed.) [1883] 1960: 143). No such ambiguity is present in the Greek, where Festus' wish is conveyed by accusativus-cum-infinitivo report parallel with his order concerning Paul: "ho men oun Fëstos apekrithë tëreisthai ton Paulon eis Kaisareian, heauton de mellein en ta- chei ekporeuesthai" (Nestle and Nestle (eds.) 193014: 378). 76 These must be distinguished from superficially similar cases in which the subor- dinate clauses fall under the scope of the narration rather than that of the report, e.g., the purpose clauses in the following excerpt: "I C'KrAA^dKT^llJe norkAdUJA 3dcfc- AKHHK^I- TKOpAIJJA CA npdKG^NHL^H CÄUJT6 &amp;&amp; HAAMTT* I KT* CAOB6CH- &amp;&amp; K/K H fip^AdM KAd^VKNT^CTKOy H OKAdCTH KOeKO^Tvl" (Luke 20: 20, in the Codex Marianus; Jagic (ed.) [1883] 1960: 290). 77 As mentioned above, many of the existing studies of OCS and early East Slavic grammar present parataxis as if it were somehow a "simpler", more "primitive", less "sophisticated" means of organization than hypotaxis. Therefore, it is paradoxical that hypotaxis actually makes fewer demands on the interpreter than parataxis does: "[C]ompared to any of the other possible meaning-encoding strategies, syntactic sub- ordination is in a real sense the least sophisticated, if by 'sophisticated' we mean in- direct, assuming knowledge and skill on the part of participants" (Lakoff 1984: 486).</page><page sequence="58">78 78 See also the discussion in Collins 1994: 202-44. 79 The existence of special "renarrated" forms in Bulgarian and Macedonian adds an additional layer of evidential complexity; however, it does not imply any substan- tial typological difference in the structure of indirect speech in those languages. 80 To be sure, sequence-of-tense and mood-shifting rules are not absolute in Ger- man dialects or the modern colloquial language (see Coulmas 1986: 16). 81 For an expression of similar doubts, see Palmer 1986: 164-65. One example of a language that supposedly lacks indirect reporting is Paez, a Micro-Chibchan lan- guage of Columbia (see Gerdel and Slocum 1976: 423; Li 1986: 39-40). However, Gerdel and Slocum (1976: 425) actually cite an example of Paez reported speech that features a first-person element referring to the reporter rather than the represented speaker: "Pta'shcu... angy quim-te-va He-told I who~was-ever" , i.e., "He told them who I was". The authors try to disassociate such "indirect question sentences" from reported speech in a strict sense by claiming that they encode only "deep structure awareness attribution": "Even [the cited example] involving the verb 'tell' is not a transformation of direct speech, but is more on the order: 'He made them aware of who I was'" (ibid.). Whether or not one takes the view that indirect speech is, in some sense, a transformation of direct (see Banfield 1973 and Partee 1973 for discus- sion), it is difficult to accept Gerdel and Slocum 's explanation. The passage certainly involves more than just "awareness attribution"; how could the represented speaker make his addressees aware of the reporter's identity other than by communicating it? In fact, the example in question is obviously an analytical representation of an utter- ance framed as indirect speech and tagged by a verbum dicendi. 82 See also Ebert 1986: 156 on Chamling and Nepali. 83 Lichacev (1952: 94) actually recognizes that the predominance of direct speech in East Slavic texts of the earliest period was functionally motivated by the general narrative character of the writing; however, his explanation for this is questionable, since it is based on the idea that direct speech is verbatim rather than on the pragma- tic efforts that could be produced by the formal properties of the given technique: "Drevnjaja russkaja pis'mennost' XI -XI II w. poeti ne znaet kosvennoj reci. Za red- kimi iskljucenijami slova dejstvujuscich lie povestvovanija peredajutsja v forme prja- moj reci, Sledovatel'no mesto, zanimaemoe prjamoj rec'ju v drevnerusskom povestvo- vanii, uze v silu odnogo togo dolzno bylo byt' i bol 'se, i znacitePnee, cem vposledst- vii. Èto ne znacit, odnako, cto stesnennyj malocislennost'ju form kosvennoj reci drev- nerusskij avtor pol'zovalsja prjamoj rec'ju, ne zadumyvajas' nad osobennostjami prja- moj (ustnoj) reci kak takovoj. Oscuscenie 'dokumental'nosti' privodimoj prjamoj reci bylo u drevnerusskogo avtora ves 'ma otcetlivym...

Lichacev's be- lief that direct speech is inherently characterized by verbatim reproduction (cf. his confusion of prjamoj with ustnyj), though shared by many authors, is untenable (for criticism, see Volosinov [1929] 1986: 128; Sternberg 1982a and 1982b; Worth 1985: 236; Tannen 1989: 99-110; and Collins 1994: 64-91). Moreover, since the infrequency of indirect speech in the earliest Russian texts is probably an epiphenomenon of the corpus, there are no firm grounds for concluding that Lichacev's prototypical medie-</page><page sequence="59">val bookman would have been hindered in any way by its putative rarity ("stesnennyj malocislennqst'ju form kosvennoj reci..."); there are, however, good grounds for assu- ming that h'e'would have been reluctant to use the given mode of reporting in prag- matically inappropriate contexts. 84 For further expressions of this view, see Jespersen [1924] 1992: 290; Schuelke 1958: 97; Öumakov 1975: 19; Leech and Short 1981: 319-20; Schiffrin 1981: 58; Page 1988: 32-33; and Tannen 1983: 365, 1986: 311, and 1989: 25-26. On involvement in discourse, see, in particular, Tannen 1989: 9-35 and passim. 85 This explains, at least in part, why indirect reports are common with verbs of knowing and thinking in the earliest Slavic texts - for example, "ßdacy/wk &gt;K6 HC*- 'kKO X^^X^ H K^npdUJdTH" (John 16: 19, in the Codex Marianus; Jagic (ed.) [1883] 1960: 382); "npHWT^we we np^KMi /MTvhrkdx^ ca *ko kaijjg npHI/wra/TK- H npHACA I TH Í10 n^NASOy" (Matthew 20: 10, in the Codex Zogra- phensis, second hand; Jagic (ed.) [1879] 1954: 28). Reports of thoughts can be pre- sented as direct speech, especially when they are lengthy and present a didactic mes- sage (cf. the martyr-to-be Boris' musings, which cover more than three columns over two pages in the Uspenskij Sbornik; Kotkov (ed.) 1971: 44-45, fol. 9bl0-10al6). However, more often they are introduced into the discourse as background information - in particular, as pretexts for subsequent action or as explanations for already-narrated events. Consequently, they tend to be framed by means of backgrounding devices such as indirect and fused speech. 86 Of course, in leaving the main task of imposing coherence to the interpreter, the reporter simultaneously gives the impression that he is refraining from active interfer- ence in the form and content of the report. According to Longacre (1983: 131), "In a language where the direct quotation and the indirect quotation contrast as surface structures, the use of the former is sometimes an attempt to avoid interpretation and bias (or to seem to avoid them) . Thus a person may insist: But I gave you his actual words! ". 87 This explains why the use of indirect speech tends to give the impression that the reporter is overtly intervening in the report (cf. Leech and Short 1981: 320). In rea- lity, there is no report without some degree of authorial intervention, if only in the act of recontextualization (see above).
