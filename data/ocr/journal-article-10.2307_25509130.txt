A radiocarbon determination on associated material provided a mid fourth millennium cal. BC date for the activity. This paper describes the Neolithic material, places it in context and explores its possible meaning. INTRODUCTION Carrickmines Great in south county Dublin was the scene for archaeological excavations that took place in 2002 arising from the construction of the South-Eastern Motorway (Figure l).1 Situated at the base of the Dublin Mountains and 3.5km inland from Killiney Bay, the site forms some of the first flat ground encountered on the northeast side of the mountain range. A large boggy area immediately to the south of the site was a former lake and the focus for settlements and related activities throughout much of the prehistoric period. Stippling the terrain around Carrickmines is a chain of megalithic tombs that bear witness to the presence of communities here during the Neolithic (Figure 2). In recent years the archaeology of these people has been augmented greatly by the increase in open-area excavations around Dublin, work which has led to new discoveries such as the settlements at Kilgobbin and Kishoge and a Neolithic axe production site at Lambay Island (O Donovan 2003-4; Cooney 2000, 195-7; Hagan 2006). This paper provides the first published account of another new discovery of Neolithic date from the county. THE EXCAVATIONS Archaeological excavations at Carrickmines Great have documented a sequence of prehistoric activity that ranged over a period of four millennia, from the Neolithic to the Iron Age (Figure 3).2 A pit-cremation of 4th - 6th century cal. AD date formed the latest archaeological activity on the site and this was preceded in the La Tene Iron Age (c.200 cal. BC) by a settlement that comprised a roundhouse (the first Iron Age example from County Dublin), an iron-smelting furnace and associated domestic structures. Late Bronze Age (c. 1000 cal. BC) activity took the form of a series of cooking-pits, huts and hearths that were probably on the edge of a larger settlement. The earliest archaeology recorded was a pit of Neolithic date and this forms the subject for this paper. THE NEOLITHIC PIT The pit was isolated from the two main foci of Late Bronze Age and Iron Age activity (Figure 4). It was a well-defined, circular feature 0.80m diameter x 0.25m deep. The base and sides were Kilkennyarchaeology@gmail.com JRSAI Vol. 136 (2006): 141-157</page><page sequence="2">142 COILIN 6 DRISCEOIL Fig. 1 Carrickmines Great, site location.</page><page sequence="3">A NEOLITHIC DISC-BEAD NECKLACE FROM CARRICKMINES GREAT, COUNTY DUBLIN 143 ?? -?- y Urban Area V i^dMbNAffiS^SWSP^fe^^^ / ."* ./ ill ?*~- ? \ BBBBBB^B!sM?m ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^K^kl^n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^HflHBsl^^^^^P'- 1 biiiiMiyB^ # Passage tomb o Wedge tomb n Neolithic house site 0 N?P o,cP ^ D Portal tomb A Unclassified tomb I 1 ^^^^B metres OD Fig. 2 Distribution map of megalithic tombs in the greater Dublin area (after Cooney 2000, 145 with additions). lined with clay and it was cut in such a way that a narrow shelf was formed along one side. From the pit, nine disc-beads were recovered, three of which were found together on the shelf, indicating that the complete article was most likely originally placed here; the other beads were subsequently displaced by roots, whose tracks within the pit were clearly visible (Figure 5). After the beads were placed, the pit was then backfilled; the absence of erosion to the sides or base indicated there was little time-lag between its opening and closing. A mix of redeposited subsoil (probably the material dug out to form the feature) and burnt debris of ash, charred oak (Quercus sp.), hazel (Corylus avellana) and hazelnut shells filled the pit (O Carroll 2004). This was presumably the waste from a fireplace, within which sherds of Western Neolithic pottery, chips of flint and grains of charred wheat (Triticum species) were identified (Ballin 2003; Brindley 2002; Johnson 2003). One of the Triticum grains produced a radiocarbon determination of 4820?35 (Poz-11604) which calibrates to between 3610-3520 cal. BC, ie. the end of the Early Neolithic or beginning of the Middle Neolithic.3 THE DISC-BEADS The nine disc-beads were manufactured from water-rolled, disc-shaped pebbles that were all variations of the same rock type, a light grey-green metamorphosed clay (fine mudstone)</page><page sequence="4">144 C6ILIN 6 DRISCEOIL f?;--;? ? j ' !i ".

Fig 4 Carrickmines Great, plan and section of the Neolithic pit which contained the disc-bead necklace, Pit 42. containing dark blue bands and mineral growth (probably garnet) (Figures 6-7; Mandal 2003). It is likely the stones were sourced locally from river gravels or the underlying till. The beads were all flat with a smooth finish and ranged in thickness from 2.57mm - 5.69mm. Their diameters extended from 11.49mm - 22.30mm and their weights from 0.45g - 2.15g. Two shapes of bead were represented - roughly circular (Nos. 1, 2, 3, 7) and irregular/notched (Nos. 4, 5, 6, 8, 9). Those that were of true circular outline were also the smallest (Nos. 1 and 7) and the beads graduated in size from these to form an attractive symmetrical piece that may have originally appeared as in Figure 7. All of the beads were perforated slightly off-centre and from one side, probably with the aid of a flint piercer. This would have allowed them to hang together in a uniform manner. The direction of boring was clearly visible as a carved ring around the perforation-hole. In all cases, there was wear in the form of smoothing visible on the circumference of the hole, a consequence of the abrasion caused by the cord on which the beads would have been threaded. In one case (No.4) this had elongated the shape of the perforation, indicating the item had been worn for a</page><page sequence="6">146 COILIN 6 DRISCEOIL '*!^^^ l;:;'^frl; y^^^^BBBB^^^^^^^^^K^^^^mW'^ ' $flpHBGE' &lt; ^^^^^^^^Mi^^^^^^^t^^^^^^^^^^^BBBBK^^^^^ ~ Fig 5 The Carrickmines Great disc-beads 'in-situ' within Pit 42.

How exactly it was worn is not entirely clear though given the rather soft character of the stone used, it probably was sported as a necklace rather than as a bracelet, where it would have been more prone to damage. A descriptive catalogue of the disc-beads is provided in Appendix 1. About 300 disc-beads have been recovered from prehistoric domestic and funerary sites (predominantly passage tombs) scattered around Ireland (O'Sullivan 2005, 125,136-139; Sheridan 1985, fig.4.9, 158-159). Those that can be dated to the first half of the fourth millennium BC occur in the majority of cases in what may be considered 'settlement' contexts (Figure 9). This was certainly the case at Knowth where a pit (Pit 17) adjacent to a rectangular Neolithic house produced two serpentine disc-beads, sherds of Western Neolithic pottery and lithics (Figure 10; Eogan 1984, 234-5 and figure 78). Likewise, early Neolithic houses at Corbally, Co. Kildare and Cloghers, Co. Kerry had disc-beads in their foundation trenches (Purcell 2002; Kiely 2003). At Circle L, Lough Gur the deposition of a complete necklace occurred prior to the construction of a dwelling over it (Figure 10; 6 Riordain 1954, 347, Figure 23:18 PI. 32b: 10; Grogan and Eogan 1987, 391-2, Figures 36-37, Plate XVIIa). It is interesting to note that many of the Lough Gur beads carried the same distinctive 'notching' as the Carrickmines examples4; Grogan and Eogan suggested the resultant curved profile was symbolic of the female form (Grogan and Eogan 1987, 391; Alison Sheridan pers.comm.). THE POTTERY Five pottery sherds were recovered from the pit, small portions of the rim, neck and body of a single, large, thick-walled, shouldered bowl (Figure 8; Brindley 2002). It appears from the nature</page><page sequence="9">A NEOLITHIC DISC-BEAD NECKLACE FROM CARRICKMINES GREAT, COUNTY DUBLIN 149 10mm ??r i Fig. 8 Carrickmines Great shouldered bowl of 'modified Western Neolithic' type (drawn by Florence Coppi). of the breaks, which had clearly occurred in antiquity, that the pottery was deposited into the pit already broken, probably as refuse. The style of pottery may be considered as 'modified Western Neolithic', ie. a regional variant of the original 'traditional Western Neolithic' pottery of the early fourth millennium BC (Sheridan 1995). The dating of'modified Western Neolithic' pottery to the period 3600-3400 cal. BC by Brindley accords well with the radiocarbon determination noted above (Brindley 2002). DISCUSSION At Carrickmines Great c. 3500 cal. BC a single pit was dug and promptly filled again with the ash from a hearth, as well as some of the soil removed to create the feature. Included in this deposit were flint-chips, fragments from a broken pottery-bowl and charred cereal remains. Before the backfilling occurred a fine necklace of stone disc-beads had been placed on a small ledge on the pit-edge. This begs the question, why did it end up here?</page><page sequence="10">150 COILIN 6 DRISCEOIL E -L w Fig. 9 Distribution map of early-mid fourth millennium BC disc-beads from Ireland.</page><page sequence="11">A NEOLITHIC DISC-BEAD NECKLACE FROM CARRICKMINES GREAT, COUNTY DUBLIN 151 " -CSvi- mil- ^fe- w *-' '-* &lt;^r &gt;&amp;?* ^^ y i?^BjBgp * ^.. . * 1037 1920 1821 1822 1923 .-. - -*- -- til "*' ^ g2^-- 1928 1929 1930 W': ?x .^^^ 1931. ,^^^i' ,,ii 'i i i 11_ 1906 1907 1908 1*? jft[ ?*!^I*!T'"X^^\. 19?&gt; 1911 1912 1913 1914 ! 1915 1?? 1917 1918 1919 | 1044 1045 Fig. 10 Disc-beads from Circle L Lough Gur, Co.

Meath 'later Western Neolithic Complex' Pit 17 (Eogan 1984, figure 83).</page><page sequence="12">152 COILIN 6 DRISCEOIL Recent years have seen much discussion around the interpretation of pits of Neolithic date (eg. Edmonds 1999, 29; Thomas 1999, 64; Garrow 2005). Whilst in the past, explanations such as 'rubbish pits', 'storage pits' and suchlike dominated, detailed study of what is actually contained within them has created concepts that centre on the idea that items that meant something were put in places that were considered special. Arising from this there have been attempts to engage with the question of what the meaning behind such deposits may have been, and in so doing 'metaphorical engagements' with the landscape and the marking of particular places or events have been suggested as explanations. These analyses have occurred primarily in relation to British sites, with the exception of excavations at Goodlands, County Antrim and Lambay Island, Co. Dublin where the excavators were able to demonstrate that the practice of 'structured deposition' in pits had occurred within the context of rock extraction (Case 1973; Gibson 1998, 15; Edmonds 1999, 29; Chapman 2000; Cooney 2000, 197). Can the foregoing assist in arriving at an understanding of the Carrickmines Great pit? Regrettably, virtually nothing is known about the immediate context of the site that might furnish clues and a key question that must remain unanswered is: was the pit actually an isolated l ll A A N I I I 20mm Fig. 11 Carrickmines Great, scale-flaked knife of early Neolithic type discovered in the topsoil near the pit (drawn by Lisa Wilson).</page><page sequence="13">A NEOLITHIC DISC-BEAD NECKLACE FROM CARRICKMINES GREAT, COUNTY DUBLIN 153 feature? While the absence of any contemporary activity from the wide area investigated around the feature would suggest this was the case, it is possible that the pit represents all that remains of a temporary camp that has left no other archaeological trace. Is it possible for instance it represents all that remains of a temporary camp that has left no other archaeological trace? Certainly the nature of the debris in the backfill - flint chips, broken pottery, charred grain and wood - could well have originated in such a context and a flint knife of early Neolithic type discovered in the topsoil nearby reinforces the impression (Figure 11) (Ballin 2003). Interpretation as a domestic refuse-pit or storage-pit however, appears unlikely: why would a necklace be placed with such care in a refuse pit? And would a storage pit have been backfilled so rapidly with waste? It is quite striking that at Lough Gur there was also a specially built ledge constructed to hold the bead-necklace, which is more than a little reminiscent of the Carrickmines Great example. Does this indicate there was a certain tradition involving this form of disc-bead? The anthropomorphism seen in both the Carrickmines Great and Lough Gur beads would also tend to add weight to this suggestion. Moreover the fmdspots of the disc-beads from Corbally, Lough Gur Circle L and Cloghers in house foundation trenches is interesting. Could they be considered as foundation offerings, the marking of a place prior to the construction of a dwelling? If so, this would suggest the disc-beads were items with a particular meaning. Is there any particular reason that the site's location was chosen? There is nothing particularly striking in terms of its topography but the density of portal-tombs (six within 10km) within the area does indicate it was an area of some significance within the Neolithic mindset (Figure 2). Could it be consequently, that the pit and its contents were placed here because this location held a particular connotation in the Neolithic? CONCLUSION Archaeological excavations at Carrickmines Great have produced evidence for a remarkable sequence of prehistoric archaeology ranging from the Neolithic to Iron Age. Some five and a half thousand years ago a pit was dug to contain a fine disc-bead necklace. The manner in which the necklace was placed within the pit and its location in an area steeped in the portal-tomb tradition signifies this may have been no ordinary rubbish or storage feature. What was represented is difficult to determine, though it can be seen to form part of a tradition of depositing special items in places that were of importance within the Neolithic landscape.
