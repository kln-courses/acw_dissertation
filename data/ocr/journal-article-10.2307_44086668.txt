<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kent e. Ryden "How Could a Weed Be a Book?": Books, Ethics, Power, and A Sand County Almanac Since its publication in 1949, Aldo Leopold's A Sand County Almanac has been widely noted for its attempts to decenter the human perspective on the natural world. Leopold is the man who encourages us to think like a mountain, taking into account the health of entire landscapes and ecosystems, imagining long spans of evolutionary time rather than immediate human frameworks (129-32). He wonders what a skunk is thinking as he follows its tracks through the January snow and wishes he were a muskrat half-buried in marsh mud, tracking the movement of geese from an animal's point of view (5, 19). In elaborating his "land ethic, "Leopold famously notes that, while the human use and alteration of natural resources is inevitable, a land ethic nonetheless "changes the role of Homo sapiens from conqueror of the land-community to plain member and citizen of it" (204) and positions humankind as, "in fact, only a member of a biotic team" (205). In these and many other ways, Leopold presents and enacts a conception and definition of nature that places it most meaningfully outside of human frames of reference, that presents it as a realm to which humans must adapt their behavior rather than the other way around. At the same time, Leopold recognizes that humans are not simply- equal teammates with plants and animals and soils but hold a privi- leged position by virtue of their level of consciousness and imagination; humans not only play on the team but, to a certain extent, coach it as well, guiding its progress and success through actions that they choose to take or not to take. Leopold comments on this "first among equals" status when contemplating a Wisconsin monument to the extinct pas- Interdisciplinary Studies in Literature and Environment 15.1 (Winter 2008) Copyright Â© 2008 by the Association for the Study of Literature and Environment</page><page sequence="2">2 ISLE senger pigeon. Leopold notes that humans "are only fellow-voyagers with other creatures in the Odyssey of evolution" and that "man, while now captain of the adventuring ship, is hardly the sole object of its quest" (109-10). At the same time, though, Leopold is aware of that sense of difference and distance when he notes that "[f]or one species to mourn the death of another is a new thing under the sun," and that "[h]ad the funeral been ours, the pigeons would hardly have mourned us. In this fact [. . .] lies objective evidence of our superiority over the beasts" (110). By "superiority," Leopold means that humans occupy a unique ethical position rather than a privileged right to self-interested power; with our technological and imaginative capabilities comes great responsibility, particularly the responsibility of restraint. He also seems to recognize that, while his goal of decentering the human is laudable and necessary, it is only partially achievable; while we should think like mountains as much as we can, it may not be possible to wholly abandon anthropomorphic ways of experiencing and conceptualizing the natural world- and, moreover, that may not necessarily be a weak- ness, that both ways of conceiving one's place in one's environment, the extra-human and the all-too-human, can work together in the service of an efficacious land ethic. This blending and melding of subject positions softens what might seem to be a paradox in the book: the fact that the author of the oft- quoted "Thinking Like a Mountain" and "Land Ethic" sections also draws frequent and deliberate parallels between the natural world and human artifacts and practices, between a realm in which hu- mans are mere members of a much larger team and the specifically human-centered realm of thought, intention, shaping, and design. As a leitmotif throughout the book, many of these parallels derive from the world of cultural andaesthetic production. The Rio Gavilan in Mexico makes music, "a vast pulsing harmony- its score inscribed on a thousand hills, its notes the lives of plants and animals, its rhythms spanning the seconds and the centuries" (149). The woodcock provides terpsichorean entertainment forthe discerning few: "the sky dance is to be seen over my woods every evening in April and May. Since we discovered it, my family and I have been reluctant to miss even a single performance" (30). A greening riverbank becomes a painting: "It is a river who wields the brush, and it is the same river who, before I can bring my friends to view his work, erases it forever from human view" (51). And the most suggestive example of this rhetorical strategy is the ongoing textual metaphor that Leopold weaves through the "Sand County Almanac" and "Sketches Here and There"sections of the book, a device whereby components of the landscape are compared to written texts, particularly books.</page><page sequence="3">"How Could a Weed Be a Book?" 3 In a way, Leopold's use of this metaphor constitutes a continua- tion of what Barton St. Armand describes as "the characterization of nature as a bound volume- the old idea of the Book of Nature," which amounts to "the reification of nature as a powerful instrument of hu- man culture" (30-31). In American nature writing, that instrument historically revealed the mind and intentions of God, or atleast a more diffuse spirituality, but "by the time of Muir and Burroughs, the once- vital metaphor of the Book of Nature was not merely a commonplace, but superannuated and sadly constrictive" (39). Leopold, however, is not simply trying to resurrect a tired and shopworn literary device. Nor is he blithely making nature over in the image of "human culture," the very practice that he critiques throughout his book; in fact, he does quite the opposite. Rather than "reading" nature in the traditional way as revealing a divine spirituality, Leopold takes seriously the materi- ality of printed texts as objects that circulate within particular social contexts, as cultural artifacts that necessarily imply not merely acts of interpretation, but a world of authors and readers who exist only in relation to each other. Far from amounting to what St. Armand wryly calls "yet another imperial colonization" (30), Leopold's ongoing use of the textual metaphor casts nature and natural systems in the role of author while placing humans in the position of incompetent readers, a set of social identities that reverses the usual hierarchies of power that characterize relationships between humans and nonhuman nature and that encourages Leopold's own readers to conceive of new, nonhierar- chical ways of relating to the natural world around them. Leopold seems to live simultaneously in the natural world and in a world of books and libraries. Spring floods bring pieces of flotsam that tell stories of their origins: "The autobiography of an old board is a kind of literature not yet taught on campuses, but any riverbank farm is a library where he who hammers or saws may read at will. Come high water, there is always an accession of new books" (25). The presence of certain tree species indicates certain patterns of landscape history: "Thus, he who owns a veteran bur oak owns more than a tree. He owns a historical library, and a reserved seat in the theater of evolution" (30). Even the form of individual trees encodes information about their ex- periences through time: "Hard years, of course, come to pines as they do to men, and these are recorded as shorter thrusts, i.e. shorter spaces between the successive whorls of branches. These spaces, then, are an autobiography that he who walks with trees may read at will" (83). The movements of animals and the tracks that they leave likewise are a legible source of information about the natural world: "Science knows little about home range: how big it is at various seasons, what food and cover it must include, when and how it is defended against trespass,</page><page sequence="4">4 ISLE and whether ownership is an individual, family, or group affair. These are the fundamentals of animal economics, or ecology. Every farm is a textbook onanimal ecology; woodsmanship is the translation of the book" (81). Even as witnesses to history, elements of the landscape are metaphorical diarists: says Leopold of an old cottonwood in the process of being cutdown, "Time was when that tree was a buoy in the prairie sea. George Rogers Clark may have camped under it; buffalo may have nooned in its shade, switching flies. Every spring it roosted fluttering pigeons. It is the best historical library short of the State College, but once a year it sheds cotton on the farmer's window screens. Of these two facts, only the second is important" (117). The dry archness of Leopold's concluding comment aligns closely with his ongoing project of decentering and de-privileging human perspectives and priorities. As a historical library, the natural landscape tells of histories other than our own, events that happen regardless of our presence, time frames measured in hundreds and thousands rather than tens or dozens of years. Reading these historical docu- ments, or at least analogizing the landscape to a library of nonhuman history, can tell us much about how nature works on the evolutionary and ecosystemic level, and can also teach humility, reminding us that ours are not the only histories, nor the only ones that matter. In this way, the textual analogy undercuts itself, using our familiarity with a particular human artifact in order to point beyond the humanized world and get us to think about plants and animals and landscapes on their own terms, terms that transcend language and the fixity of print. And the textual analogy breaks down in several other ways as well, suggesting limits on its appropriateness and usefulness: for example, we encounter print in a linear fashion, making meaning through fol- lowing it in strict sequence, while even Leopold's own encounters with nature as recorded in his book are multisensory, overlapping, open- ended, anything but paragraph-like. Much of the analogy's power and effectiveness lies precisely in the fact that it is just that- an analogy, a tool for thought rather than a literal representation. Of course a tree or a landscape isn't a book. And yet it can be book-like in ways that have important ramifications for the ethical concerns that engage Leopold throughout his work. The book is titled A Sand County Almanac, after all; it is a book that is named after a particular kind of book, and as such it invites us to think of na- ture not just through strict textual analogies- nature as a collection of material things that, like books and libraries, encode information about the past- but also insofar as those metaphorical books intersect with the concerns of print culture more broadly, particularly in its social and ethical dimensions. When construed as authors, the rivers and trees and</page><page sequence="5">"How Could a Weed Be a Book?" 5 animals that Leopold identifies as such occupy a privileged position; in a society that values reading, they possess considerable cultural capital. As Leopold notes throughout his book, though, the books of nature authors go largely unread- not because most humans do not want to read them, but because they cannot read them. In Leopold's imagined world of books, humans are illiterate, culturally bankrupt. The differ- ences in social and cultural position and power implicit in Leopold's textual metaphor effectively place nature in an elite positionand relegate humans to the ranks of society's disenfranchised and dispossessed; the human perspective is not only decentered; it is demoted. Leopold does not insist on this formulation- he is more interested in leveling hierarchies than in erecting new ones in place of the old- but the inver- sions he accomplishes in his metaphorical world of print serve to jar Leopold's readers out of their wonted perspectives and enable them to construct new alternative visions, perhaps imagining empathetically what it would be like to be trapped within nature's powerlessness, perhaps foreseeing a new relationship altogether. As Richard H. Brodhead has persuasively argued in his book Cultures of Letters: Scenes of Reading and Writing in Nineteenth-Century America, categories such as "author" and "reader" are historically con- tingent. Not everyone has been able to read, not everyone has been able to write, not everyone who has been able to write has wanted to write for publication, not everyone who has wanted to write for publication has been able to make it into print. "Author" and"reader" have been very restricted identities, open only to those who not only possess the skills of writing and reading but who have occupied certain carefully defined social and cultural positions as well. Brodhead identifies his approach as a "history of literary access, conceived as the history of the processes by which literary writing has had different cultural places made for it, and so has had different groups placed indifferent proximities to it;" his is a mode of inquiry that"would ask of every literary attempt what sense of literary empowermentit illustrates and proceeds from, then what conditions enabled its writer to envision his [sic] power in that form and not another" (115; italics in original). At any historical moment, members of different social groups can imagine themselves as certain kinds of authors and not others, choosing from those genres and publication outlets that are culturally "open"to them- and those openings are carved out and maintained by the dominant culture. As a woman of a certain social standing, Sarah Orne Jewett could publish local-color stories in the Atlantic but did not imagine herself as a "major" novelist like William Dean Howells or Henry James; the African-American writer Charles Chesnutt found a ready audience for his dialect tales of southern black life but was not able to</page><page sequence="6">6 ISLE gain publication for the other kinds of writing that he wanted eagerly to get into print. Insofar as Leopold imagines nature's creatures as cultural produc- ers, they are members of a recognizable cultural elite: they are painters whose works are worthy of galleries, they are dancers and choreog- raphers, they are classical musicians, and they are authors of books. In Brodhead's model, the gates to these social and cultural roles are erected and policed by the dominant culture's tastemakers; Chesnutt could enter authorship through the back door, so to speak, but not through the front. In the metaphorical culture of letters that Leopold creates in his book, nature is in a position of power, at the top of the taste hierarchy, able to define the world and the things in it in an ironic inversion of the usual "cultural construction of nature" carried on by humans. And humans are on the very bottom rung of society, trapped by their illiteracy in a position of irrelevance. Literacy is not simply a skill; it is a set of social relationships as well, whereby some people have access to knowledge, communication, and civic participation, and others do not. Literacy connotes power far beyond the ability to deci- pher meaning from a printed page; it is inevitably bound up in social ideologies.1 Slaves in the American South were not taught to read as a means ofcontrolling them and preventing them from communicating beyond the range of a human voice; conversely, colonial New England achieved high rates ofliteracy so that men and women could read the Bible and the Psalms and thus fulfill their expected roles as members of a civic and a religious community. Insofar as human relationships with the natural world embody questions of power, of the ability of people to impose their will on the environments that surround them, Leopold portrays in social and culturalterms an upside-down vision of the power differentials that structure human engagements with nature. Not only are most people unable to understand the long-term historical processes that have shaped the world around them and that provide possible guides for its future, in their illiteracy they are imagi- natively disenfranchised from any involvement in nature's"society" at all. Leopold's textual metaphor enables him to construct an ironic version of the world in which his readers actually live, one in which humans will only gain full membership- a membership set on nature's terms- if they improve their reading skills so they can make out what the natural world wants to communicate to them. While ideas concerning authorship and readership constitute the most incisive and subversive critique implicit in Leopold's textual metaphor, he also explores several other aspects of print culture that provide a useful framework for questioning and rebuilding humans' relationships with the natural world. As texts and as material objects,</page><page sequence="7">"How Could a Weed Be a Book?" 7 books put people in certain social relationships to each other, be it through their place in what Robert Darnton calls the "communica- tions circuit" (31) that brings words out of an author's head and into a reader's hands, or through their relative engagement with the ideas put forth by those words. By placing humans in the role of author at one point, Leopold alludes to the ethical implications of writing and the responsibility that writers must take for their words, and by musing on what happens to books once they have been published, Leopold raises important questions about environmental stewardship. In all, he touches on three additional aspects of the social and cultural life of books that have powerful metaphorical implications for how his read- ers think about and act in the natural world: authorship (with "author" here seen as individual creator, not as a particular social identity), librarianship,and censorship. At one point during his musings, as he is discussing how and why he thins the trees on his property every November, Leopold steps back from his analogy of nature-as-book to acknowledge his role in author- ing that book, just one of many other texts he has seen and created: I have read many definitions of what is a conservationist, and written not a few myself, but I suspect that the best one is written not with a pen, but with an axe. It is a matter of what a man thinks about while chopping, or while deciding what to chop. A conservationist is one who is humbly aware that with each stroke he is writing his signature on the face of his land. (68) Again, Leopold is not saying that we should not chop at all, but ac- knowledging that a certain level of resource use is inevitable andneces- sary, be it for fuel or for building or for maintaining the overall health of a forest. He also recognizes that humans have individual agency, that they are going to author different texts depending on their past and present predilections: "Signatures of course differ," he notes, "whether written with axe or pen, and this is as it should be" (68); and as for his own decisions, he will "always cut the birch to favor the pine," because "I love all trees, but I am in love with pines" (69-70). Still, the point here is that the human contributors to nature's library do not simply scribble blindly and without consequence, but bear responsibility for the stories they create, for the course and outcome of their plots, a responsibility made all the more acute because their authorial decisions have real- world consequences; the motto here, perhaps, is not "art for art's sake," but "art for the land's sake." In his summation of his land ethic, Leopold famously states, "A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integ- rity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise" (224-25). Just as books may have social impacts for</page><page sequence="8">8 ISLE good or for ill, so, too, do the authorial choices made by Leopold and others have anethical dimension. The contributions they make to the historical library that surrounds and sustains them directly determine the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community; flatly, they are right or they are wrong. While addressing questions of metaphorical authorship, Leopold also considers the ethical and political dimensions of what we do with the books after they are written and published. At one point in the "July" section of the "Almanac," he notes the presence of a Silphium plant in an unmown corner of a country cemetery, "a yard-square relic of original Wisconsin," and he values the plant for the witness it has borne to the region's prehuman history: "What a thousand acres of Silphiums looked like when they tickled the bellies of the buffalo is a question never again to be answered, and perhaps not even asked" (45). By the end of the summer, though, the fence around the cemetery has been removed and the Silphium cut down, fated to be mowed again and again by the highway crew until it dies. Leopold responds to this loss with perhaps his most explicit and charged use of the textual anal- ogy: "If I were to tell a preacher of the adjoining church that the road crew has been burning history books in his cemetery, under the guise of mowing weeds, he would be amazed and uncomprehending. How could a weed be a book?" (46). By now we know several ways in which that question can be an- swered: a weed is a book in that it tells stories and encodes history, and in that its landscape is authored through human decisions to mow or not to mow, to alter or not to alter. But Leopold here also encourages us to think about how we handle books. Elsewhere he has characterized an old Cottonwood tree, and by extension the natural landscape more broadly, as"the best historical library short of the State College" (117), but now it appears that the landscape is a special collections library as well, with humans put into the role of archivists and curators. An archivist makes certain key decisions: what gets preserved? What evi- dence of which pasts is kept extant and available? How might we best treat these materialsin order to ensure their preservation? These are not only practical but ethical questions. If evidence of certain pasts is eradicated, particularly the pasts of historically voiceless or oppressed populations, those pasts are no longer recoverable; it is as if they never existed. When considered as librarians in charge of a special historical collection consisting of fragile primary texts, humans bear a unique responsibility to preserve the non-human pasts of the landscapes that surround them. As representatives of the dominant culture, it is up to them to ensure that the stories of the dominated natural world remain available to teach and enlighten us.</page><page sequence="9">"How Could a Weed Be a Book?" 9 Leopold's potent image of book-burning raises one further spectre, that of censorship, with the highway crew in the unwitting role of an angry mob. Typically, such mobs destroy books because they contain ideas that are not only unpopular with those doing the burning, but are seen as dangerous and subversive as well. The presence of the Silphium plant thus emerges as somehow socially disruptive and threatening. In alluding to a time when the landscape was healthier because unaltered by human presence and activity, the plant points out the costs and self-destructive effects of our modern way of life. It stands in silent admonishment of our modern systems of agriculture and consumption, and suggests heretical alternative ways of thinking and acting. Best to burn these seditious pamphlets before they foment revolution. Notes Leopold drily, "It might be best to prohibit at once all teaching of real botany and real history, lest some future citizen suffer qualms about the floristic price of his good life"(46). And what better way to inhibit such teaching than to get rid of the history books? "We grieve only for what we know," Leopold concludes/The erasure of Silphium from western Dane County is no cause for grief if one knows it only as a name in a botany book" (48). And if one considers it as a history book, ignorance of the larger natural past to which it alludes allows one to move into the future with confidence, ill-founded though that confidence may be. The mob has not only tossed the history books into the fire, it has lobbed a Molotov cocktail into thespecial archival collections as well. There is a great difference between a tree and a book; the latter is a cut-down, chewed-up, flattened-out, printed and bound version of the former- natural material subjected to the extremes of human artifice. Yetin A Sand County Almanac, Leopold brings book and landscape to- gether in the service of a better environmental future. While famously critiquing anthropocentrism, he also draws on analogies from the world of print culture to better guide humans in their relationships with the naturalworld. If his land ethic provides a guide for thinking about nature- or thinking like a mountain, if you will- his ongoing textual motif provides a guide for behavior and a corrective to human hubris. If we think of ourselves as authoring books that the future will judge us by, if we think of ourselves as conserving rare and valuable environmental texts and encouraging the free flow of environmen- tal ideas, if we cede our cultural authority to nature's "authors," the "integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community" seems that much more assured.</page><page sequence="10">10 ISLE NOTE 1.
