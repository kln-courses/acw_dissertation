The work towards publication has been carried out by various researchers, most of whom were originally selected and approached by Shiloh. It should be noted that, as a result, the reports were prepared over a large number of years, and a scholar researching one chapter did not necessarily know of the conclusions found in the next. The publication strategy noted in the first final report volume (Ariel 1990) entails publication of units of material as they are completed. In the advanced stages of preparation towards publication subsequent to Shiloh's death, the coordination of the research has been carried out by Donald T. Ariel and Alon De Groot. Contrary to the announcement in the preface to Vol. IV (Ariel and De Groot 1996), this volume contains only one of the units originally projected in the final reports series, the inscriptions. Coincidentally, this unit was projected to be published as Vol. VI (the fifth volume of the final reports) when the original publication program was announced (Ariel 1990: IX). At that time, Yair Shoham was designated editor of the inscriptions unit. Alon De Groot was also instrumental in coordinating the preparation of the reports on the inscriptions. Some of the material published in this volume, such as rosette-stamped handles and figurative bullae, may perhaps be considered not to belong among the inscriptions according to the strict definition of the word. It should be clear, however, that such subject matter is most appropriately published with the other chapters found in this volume. At the same time, studies of some other similarly related material (e.g. anepigraphic seals), not available in time for publication in this volume, are regrettably absent. The decision to publish the available material was taken in accordance with the above-mentioned publication strategy. As with the earlier volumes, the City of David Society continues to support the publication of Shiloh's excavation finds. In this regard Dr. Dan Bahat of the Executive Board of the Society deserves particular mention. The Institute of Ar- chaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem is the trustee of Shiloh's academic estate. The In- stitute, now headed by Gideon Foerster, and the editorial board of its Qedem monograph series have maintained their commitment to the publication of the excavation's final reports. Considering the fluid publication strategy mentioned above, the support of both of the above has been essential. The Qedem monograph series' editorial assistant, Sue Goro- detsky, has been especially instrumental in main- taining the quality and continuity of all of the City of David final reports. The Kaplan Kushlik Foundation, founded by Mr. Mendel Kaplan of Johannesburg, South Africa, has continued to bear the financial burden of the research and publication of Shiloh's excavation. This volume is dedicated to the memory of Yair Shoham, whose untimely death (in May 1997) occurred while the volume was being edited. Yair grew up in Kibbutz Kefar Darom and Moshav Nir Etzion, and moved to Jerusalem while studying at the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew Uni- versity. He participated in numerous archaeological projects, but was most closely associated with the excavations at Tel Dan and those at the City of David, where he supervised the work in Area E2 (1980-1982) and Area D2 (1983-1985). Yair was responsible for much of the processing of the epigraphic material from the excavation, together with his teacher, Prof. J. Naveh. Yair's individual contributions to the inscriptions unit were all written in Hebrew before 1992 (the important report on the bullae was completed in 1990), and he approved the translation into English of most of them. However, he did not have the opportunity to revise or update them before his death. It was felt that for the publication of ancient inscriptions a fully updated bibliography is not essential, and consequently only the most important recent studies have been added to the bibliographies. Moreover, it was decided to leave untouched the minor stylistic VII</page><page sequence="5">inconsistencies between those chapters and other chapters. The editor has done his best to bring Yair's chapters faithfully to press. We would like to mention here those who directly contributed to processing the finds published in this volume, some of whom are not otherwise thanked in the text. Photographs of the finds were taken by Zeev Radovan, M. Salzberger and Ilan Sztulman; infra-red photographs of some of the inscriptions in Chapter I were supplied by the Division of Identification and Forensic Sciences of the Israel Police department, then headed by Meir Kaplan. The profile drawings of the pottery are by Shifra Eisenstein. Most of the inscriptions were drawn by Ada Yardeni and the remainder by Sara Halbreich; the figures in Chapter IV are by C. Hersch. In Vols. II and IV (Ariel 1990; Ariel and De Groot 1996) concordances were presented which also provided updated stratigraphie designations for published objects from all of the excavation areas. The concordance appearing here details the finds noted in Vol. V as well as the inscribed material found in this volume. Much remains to be published from the late Yigal Shiloh's excavations in the City of David. Never- theless, at this juncture, the editor wishes to take the opportunity to thank all who have helped him in making available to the public the large quantity of finds which have been published so far.

The readings of some of them are presented here, with considerable reservations. Drawings of the inscriptions are by Dr. A. Yardeni. I. FIRST TEMPLE PERIOD IN 1. E2/1816; L. 540; Str. 5? (12 x 8 cm). Fragment of a monumental inscription engraved on the smoothed surface of a reddish-gray stone slab. Only thirteen letters and five letter fragments have been preserved: [ ]On/us[- ] 1 [ ]ñ'yy.yivyi[ ] 2 [ ]i.^n[ ] 3 [ M ] 4 In lines 2 and 3, one may read two numbers on which one might base the reconstruction of a date formula: &gt;ym[n mm ... row nihw vivyi "in the seventeenth year ... in the fourth month" (cf., e.g., Jer. 1:2-3). However, this reading is quite prob- lematic. In line 2, after the reconstructed resh (of which only the downstroke remains), no traces of the downstroke of the he are discernible, though the smoothed surface for it has been preserved. It does not seem likely that a mistake in the genders of 1</page><page sequence="9">the numerals would occur in such a monumental inscription, or that the writer (or engraver) would omit the final mater lectionis. Thus it may be that iw yivyn should be understood as "satisfied with riches"; see 1 Chr. 29:28: yivy raio ra&gt;vn fT&gt;n] nn&gt;i TDD1 ivyv o&gt;&amp;&gt;; Eccles. 4:8: iw ynvyn tò m; Eccles. 5:9: Nb «ito ihn. The latter interpretation may perhaps be correlated with the surviving letters in line 1. The verb ms "to heap up, to gather" occurs seven times in the Old Testament; twice it is related to corn (Gen. 41:35, 49) and on two other occasions (Zach. 9:3; Job 27:16) the biblical text deals with "heaping up silver like dust." The following letter, he, may belong to the noun yin "wealth," which is a synonym of "riches" (see Ps. 112:3; Prov. 8:18). The difficulty in reconstructing yin is that the remnants of the letter after the he cannot belong to a waw (one would expect a slightly rightward diagonal) and the traces of its head seem rather to belong to a mem or to a nun. The OT consistently spells ļiri (on this word, occurring mainly in Proverbs, see Hurvitz 1991: 42-44). Could the suggested be related to the spellings o&gt; and ïp in the Siloam inscription, and o&gt; in the Lachish and Arad ostraca? On o&gt; - oi&gt; see Kutscher 1970: 18-19; Rainey 1972; Aharoni 1981: 13, 14 n. 18. The word in line 3 can be understood as "fourth (month)" (see above) or as "fourth (gen- eration)" (see owi o&gt;vybvy by in Exod. 20:5; 34:7; Num. 14:18; Deut. 5:9). The latter occurs in an Aramaic burial inscription from Nerab: y:n "children of the fourth generation; they wept for me" (Gibson 1975: 97). As the text is very fragmentary, none of these suggestions can be substantiated, and no historical or other conclusions should be based on them. Two monumental inscriptions bearing similar letters have been found in Jerusalem: the Siloam Tunnel inscription and the burial inscription of "..ģ&lt; yahu the royal steward." In these inscriptions one would expect a lapidary style of writing. However, as such a tradition did not evolve in the Hebrew script, the formal cursive style was employed for writing on stone. In this style the words are consistently divided by dots and the rightward downstrokes are thickened. The latter phenomenon is the natural by-product of writing with pen and ink, and it accompanies the most formal writing traditions. The formal cursive script is very conservative and does not tend to change; therefore this fragmentary inscription cannot be dated precisely. A date in the 7th century BCE, however, can be considered as sound. IN 2. G 4599; L. 783; Str. 10C-B (17 x 7 cm). A fragmentary ink inscription in three lines, written on the body of a jar from its base towards the handle, reads as follows: .rant?.ont?n.bN&gt;nN.p.t?[ ] 1 [.^]ro.o»n.innon.ii.w[&gt; ] 2 [ ].oton.in&gt;yi[&gt;.p.]iri&gt;[ ] 3 This is a list of the names of three persons, each accompanied by a description. The text in line 2 reminds us of Eccles. 2:8: inn "I gathered also silver and gold." Thus line 3 may perhaps be reconstructed [.nmltWDn "who gathers gold," which would parallel the description [.&lt;ļ]OD.tBDri "who gathers silver" of line 2. The 2</page><page sequence="10">descriptions do not seem to be epithets or references to the persons' occupations; "the silver collector" would rather be &lt;ļOin odd. Presumably two wealthy persons are mentioned in lines 2-3. The description of the man in line 1 is difficult. The root o*io does not exist in OT, unless it stands for 'r w (&gt;W)V in later Hebrew), meaning "to incise, to scratch, to make marks, to make incisions in the body, to wound." The word nino is even more problematic. It occurs only in Jer. 38:1 1-12 in the expression o&gt;nbEn nunon the traditional translation of which is "old rags and worn-out clothes." Does nino mon mean "he who marks (sõret) rags," or "who(se body) is injured (sārūt) by (wearing) rags"? In Akkadian, however, sarātu - as has been noticed by Avigdor Hurowitz - means "to tear (clothes)": nahlapta sarātu , lubuša šurrutu and subāta sarātu (see AHw 1 186a, s.v. sarātu). Hurowitz translates nino ono n as "tearer of rags," suggesting that nino and subãtu are etymologically related. Now the question is whether nino onon means "the tearer ( ha-sõrêt ) of rags," or "the one with torn ( ha - sārūt) rags (or clothes)." In the OT, mini yrip "with his coat rent" (2 Sam. 15:32) and ovni &gt;yrip "with their clothes rent" (2 Sam. 13:31; 2 Kings 18:37; Isa. 36:22; Jer. 41:5) designate grief. How- ever, in this context the description of "[...]s son of 'Ahi'el" as nino onon (standing in opposition to &lt;loi oí in "who gathers silver") seems rather to be a sign of poverty (like o^vip "torn clothes, rags" in Prov. 23:21). The name of the first person has not been preserved; it may begin with yhw- or may (like the name of his father, 'Ahi'el) not be Yahwistic. At any rate, those of the other two are. One wonders what was the purpose of writing this text on a jar. The script is a formal handwriting of the 7th century BCE. It is noteworthy that the verb odd occurs only in the later books of the Bible; see Hurvitz 1972: 175, n. 308. IN 3. G 4849; L. 791; Str. 10B (3.8 x 6.2 cm). A fragment of an ostracon bearing a name-list written in ink: [ 1 [ ïmn 2 [ o]p&gt;nN 3 [ t?]N&gt;nN 4 [ -n]Nmp 5 Line 1 can be reconstructed either as "(belonging) to Benaiah" or as ... pb or ... followed by a personal name, i.e. "(belonging) to the son(s) of PN"; cf. the Arad inscriptions (Aharoni 1981: Nos. 10 [line 4], 49, 55, 56), as well as the jar-inscription nit? discussed below (IN 6). Î7N1V1 occurs in Num. 1:14; 7:42, 47; 10:20 (for this and related names see Porten 1971). Although the upper bar of the alef is not visible, the reading is preferable to note the stance of the downstroke. The name iiNTip appears in the Arad ostraca (Aharoni 1981: Nos. 24:14, 39:3; in No. 39 Aharoni read m&gt;m) and on a bulla in the defective spelling -lNilp (Avigad 1986: No. 156). Note that none of the names in this list is Yahwistic and that in lines 2-4 there are medial matres lectionis. IN 4. G 11427; L. 950; Str. 9 (7.5 x 8 cm). A fragment of an ostracon comprising a name-list with designations of amounts of wheat or barley: [ ].nvyN - « - « [ ] 1 [ ].nwN - L- - 1 [ ] 2 [ ].nvyN - 1 - « [ ] 3 [ ?imi]'yn » [ ] 4 [ ]&gt; - [ ] 5 [ ] 6 Originally there were at least two columns, in which the names were followed by amounts of commod- ities. In this fragment the end of a column and the beginning of another one have been preserved. The 3</page><page sequence="11">mark « - i which recurs in column 1, lines 1-4, designates amounts of wheat (oun) in the Arad ostraca (Aharoni 1981: Nos. 31-32). In the second column there is a list of informal personal names, "the wife of [PN]" (see the discussion of hw&gt; ra below). The horizontal strokes belong to the second column; these are check-marks. Similar strokes (generally oblique ones) appear in the Aramaic name-lists on papyrus from Elephantine (Cowley 1923: Nos. 22, 24) and Edfu (Cowley 1923: No. 81). IN 5. G 4542/3; L. 783; Str. 10C-B (9.1 x 8.5 cm). Illegible traces of writing in two lines on a jar fragment. IN 6. El/7986; L. 1300; Str. 10 (14.4 x 6.5 cm). An ink inscription written under the shoulder of a jar, between the two handles: o hw&gt;. nil? HW&gt; ra^ indicates ownership; the jar belonged to a woman known as the daughter of Ya'ama'. In a familiar environment where people knew one another, the personal name was very often dropped. "Son/daughter/wife of PN" are informal names (Naveh 1990). Hypocoristica very often end with -a (spelled with either final alef or final he). Final - a may follow a theophoric element (such as tòyn in the Samaria ostraca) or another (nominal or verbal) element (e.g. N*ny). However, the people who introduced and used these names in antiquity were not aware of the kind of element which preceded the - a ; they simply abbreviated the name by cutting it short and adding an -a at its end. Sometimes these elements are cut off in the middle, for example nt?nN, a short form of (see the 8th-century BCE Aramaic graffito on a brick from Hamat; Otzen 1990: 289); dwiid, the abbreviation of (in the Hermopolis 4</page><page sequence="12">papyri; Bresciani and Kamil 1966: 419 [index]); and NTiwy, which is presumably a shortened form of pvrnnvyy or a similar Phoenician name ( CIS I, 164). Just as biblical (1 Kings 22:8-9) or tòw (2 Chr. 18:7-8) are presumably abbreviated forms of (Noth 1928: 28), may stand for or ïnviaw (cf. in 2 Chr. 17:16 and V)W). Actually the last letter in the word we read as HW&gt; is a peculiar alef : the lower horizontal stroke breaks through to the left side of the downstroke. Thus one may read vw&gt; instead of hw&gt;. However, samekh should have three horizontal strokes drawn high above the downstroke (see also IN 14 below). The tet at the end of this short inscription is reminiscent of the ^/-symbol common in the Persian and Hellenistic periods (see its appearance on locally stamped handles from the City of David, Ariel and Shoham, this volume, Chapter IX, L 101- 110). The interpretation of this symbol is still a matter of debate. Whereas the generally accepted view is that it was a royal emblem (see Cross 1968: 231; Avigad 1974: 52-54; Goldwasser and Naveh 1976), Delavault and Lemaire (1975) believe that this tet stands for no "good," meaning "wine of good quality." Lemaire (1976) found this symbol incised on an Iron Age decanter, where he read "1/4 hin (wine) of first quality." Following this inter- pretation, one may read here (n)o (ļ&gt;&gt;) ra!? "(belonging) to the daughter of Ya'ama, (wine of) good (quality)." However, there is no reason to assume that the tet in the Iron Age should be related to the tet- symbol of the Persian-Hellenistic periods. Note the single letters (including tet ) appearing on Iron Age jars found in the excava- tions of the City of David (Shoham, this volume, Chapter II). IN 7. G 5747; L. 872; Str. 10B (5 x 6.5 cm). An ink inscription on a fragment of the shoulder of ajar: 5</page><page sequence="13">Note that the downstrokes of the samekh and waw were drawn leftward. This may be a result of poor conditions for writing; perhaps access to the jar was difficult. IN 8. El/5973; L. 631; Str. 11 (inscription 14.5 cm long). Chiseled after firing on the shoulder of a jar: onn tb As inscriptions beginning with lamed on the shoulders of jars generally indicate ownership, we would expect a personal name here. However, oddd does not seem to be one. If means "(belonging) to the heater," it should perhaps be related to the three inscriptions (one on a bowl and two on jars) which were found in three northern sites: "of the cooks" at Tel Dan, N&gt;pv^ "of the cup-bearers" at 'En Gev (both in Aramaic; see Avigad 1968) and "of the food-servers" at Tel Hazor (Naveh 1981). The two signs engraved to the left and at some distance (about 5 cm) from the main inscription seem to comprise a measure and a numeral. The sign on the right resembles the hieratic numeral 7 (Möller 1909: No. 620). IN 9. E2/7340; L 1444; Str. 12 (inscription 19 cm long).

Chiseled after firing on the inner surface of a bowl: on&gt;t? on' meaning "orphan," is quite a common name in the Elephantine documents; it also occurs on a seal from Tell Kheleifeh (Avigad 1961). Inscriptions engraved on hard pottery vessels by continuous careful chiseling are quite common in Jerusalem and other Judahite sites. It may be that this technique was copied from that of engraving in soft limestone, an example of which has been found in the Ophel (Naveh 1982: esp. 197-98, n. 6). IN 11.

It seems likely that this block is a stone weight (see Eran 1996: W 123, Fig. 39:16) on which the designation of ownership was inscribed.

SECOND TEMPLE PERIOD IN 16. D2/20172; Surf.; Unstr. (9x7 cm). A fragmentary ostracon.

Except for psw "there went out" (i.e. "there were expedited"), the abbreviation samekh (standing for seah) and most of the numerical signs, the readings are reconstructed. IN 17.

An ostracon. ťPM vb [1] yiDD P» Loaves (of bread): [1] thousand; for Hananiah dough From the paléographie point of view this ostracon should be dated to the latter part of the 4th century, or perhaps the beginning of the 3rd century BCE. The letter forms can be compared with those of the Ketef Yeriho name-list (Eshel and Misgav 1988), the ostracon mentioning &gt;f?nû of ca. 300 BCE (Naveh 1985: 118-19, PL XX:9) and a 3rd-century BCE name-list from Egypt (Bresciani 1962). According to Mishnah 'Eruvin 8:2 and Kelim 17:11, a loaf of bread was baked from a half or a third of a qab of flour, and it was adequate for two meals. Since a qab is about 2.2 liters (or 2.5 liters 9</page><page sequence="17">according to Milik's calculation [1962: 39], based on an inscribed jar from Qumran), the dough for a thousand loaves of bread was made from a huge amount of flour. The word px i is Hebrew; the Aramaic word for dough is A sherd (No. 548) inscribed px n was also found at Masada (Yadin and Naveh 1989: 48). Moreover, the use of "idd as "a loaf of bread" is also Hebrew; the Aramaic equivalent is ht'ù or NDtw. In Aramaic "DD does not mean "loaf' (Cowley 1923: No. 30, line 28: 1 yiDD = "1000 silver talents"). It seems likely that this ostracon served as a label in a public (perhaps military) bakery, where Hebrew was presumably the spoken language. IN 18. El/17180; Str. 2113; Str. 9 (6.3 x 6.8 cm). An ostracon. /// p nmt Zebadiah: 3 qabs p I v [&gt;]#?vy Shelom[ai]: 1 seah ' /// (and) 4 qabs Paleographically this ostracon should be dated to the late 4th century BCE.

Ml III - ™ [ ]no[ ] The script seems to be of the late 4th or early 3rd century BCE. Thus the year 16 may refer to the regnal years of Ptolemy I (323-282 BCE) or perhaps of Ptolemy II (282-246 BCE). In the second line the reading is difficult. It may perhaps mention amounts of goods; [ ]no could then be reconstructed [p]n v "ground (wheat or barley)." IN 20. D2/13864; L. 1801; Unstr.

At any rate, this style of writing was common in the Persian period, but was still current in the 3rd and early 2nd centuries BCE; see, e.g., the short early 2nd-century building inscriptions on Mount Gerizim (Naveh and Magen 1997: 12*, Nos. 3-4).

The mem , however, is typical of the Persian period. Such mems, appearing on coins of Gaza from the Persian, Hellenistic and Roman periods, are thought to be the emblem of Gaza, where Marnas was the chief deity. Similar mems were also incised before firing on a lamp and a juglet of the Persian period found at 'En Gedi (Mazar and Dunayevsky 1967: 139, PI. 32:1-2). It is possible that the mem on this jar, whose shape is one that continued from the Persian period, was intended to indicate that the jar was made in Gaza (Naveh 1985: 119, n. 27). IN 27.

However, the writing in the soft clay is reminiscent of some kinds of incantation texts (Naveh and Shaked 1985: 84-89). The assumption that this piece may be part of a spell seems to be corroborated by the only complete word, nt^n, which means "you will (should) eradicate." The text was engraved in the typical Hasmonean Jewish script (150-30 BCE); see the looped alef (known from the Nash Papyrus; Cross 1961: 148, Fig. 3:1) and the open samekh. 12</page><page sequence="20">IN 28.

Part of a letter (?), dated AH 102 (720/1 CE). The ostracon is a sherd from the lower part of a vessel, with maximum dimensions of 75 x 63 mm. For the archaeological context of the ostracon, see Ariel and Magness 1992: 75. The vessel itself is described in Magness 1992: 161, 182, Fig. 11:3. Remnants of six or seven lines are written "head to head" from the middle of the sherd towards the borders. The early 8th century script, in black ink applied with a nib probably made from a reed, is reminiscent of the writing on papyri, other ostraca and pieces of marble slabs. A great part of the inscription has been lost; much of it has faded or been washed away.

The end of the 7th and the beginning of the 8th centuries represent a period of intensive Umayyad activity in Jerusalem and indeed in the whole of 15</page><page sequence="23">Syria. In the year AH 101 (720 CE) the pious Caliph Umar II (717-20) died and was succeeded by Yazîd II (720-24). The dynasty was then at its height; the first two decades of the 8th century had witnessed the building activity of Caliph Walîd I (705-15) and his brother Sulaymân throughout Syria. The city of Ramla was built and Damascus and Jerusalem were embellished with beautiful Friday mosques and other public buildings. Although papyrus was available, it was expen- sive; sherds, pieces of marble and other materials with suitable surfaces were therefore used for writing. Samples of them have been discovered, although not in great abundance, at Nessana, Arad and a few sites in Transjordan. The importance of this find lies in the fact that the few words preserved on this ostracon contain, as far as I can see, an exact date. BIBLIOGRAPHY Ariel, D.T. and Magness, J. 1992. Area K.

FIRST TEMPLE PERIOD Described here are 45 very short inscriptions on pottery from the First and Second Temple periods. Of the 39 inscriptions ascribed to the First Temple period, four (IP 36-39) derive from contexts dated stratigraphically to a later period. Some of the six inscriptions ascribed to the Second Temple period (IP 40-45) may also derive from the First Temple period. IP 1. El/3792; L. 641; Str. 10 (3.5 x 5.5 cm).

On the shoulder of a cooking pot, the letter qof incised with a chisel after firing. The letter is well formed. A single letter incised on a pottery vessel is sometimes an abbreviation of a word (Aharoni 1981: 102-103, 115-17, 405). According to the Mishnah ( Ma'aser Sheni 4:11), the letter qof may stand for the word qorban (sacrifice). The Mishnah states: "If a man finds a vessel and on it inscribed a qof ' it means - qorban , a mem means - ma'aser , a dalet - demai ; a tet - tebel ; a taw - terumah ; for in times of danger they used to write taw for terumah Typologically, the cooking pot is typical of the 8 th- 7th centuries BCE; it may have served the needs of the Temple in Jerusalem.

They bear, with more or less certainty, South Arabian letters. All were incised on ceramic vessels after firing, with a character- istically Judean chiseling technique. Both the inci- sion technique and the ware of the fragments themselves indicate that the signs may have been incised in Jerusalem. IP 46. G 5793; L. 913; Str. IOC. This fragment of a ceramic cooking pot bears two incised marks apparently of ancient South Arabian origin. The one on the right side of the sherd is 45 mm high and 32 mm wide; it appears to be the letter h Cf), which may have been used as a monogram. Two lines incised to the sides could indicate a pair of /'s (1), which together with the h can be read as the name HLL. A not very well executed circle 25 mm in diameter is incised on the left side of the sherd. A small ring 10 mm high and 7 mm wide is inscribed, slightly off center, within the circle. If this is regarded as a letter, it can be read only as ' (©) and may be interpreted as a magical sign (Höfner 1952-53: 276, first circle). The form of the h is similar to that known from the earliest South Arabian inscriptions, which correspond in date to the Iron Age II level in * The late Prof. Höfner's contribution was composed from two detailed letters to Professor Shiloh, the first from from March 1981, and the second undated. A letter from Prof. Höfner on November 10, 1988, indicated that she had no remarks to add to the first two letters. The first three of these sherds was treated in Shiloh 1987. A response by B. Sass concerning the same three sherds was published in 1990. They are also noted in Nadelman 1990: 39-41, in a discussion of the chiseling technique employed to make the inscriptions, and again in Bron 1995: 84. We do not know if Höfner saw any of these articles. A draft of this article was read by Hannes D. Galter of the University of Graz (Editor). which the fragment was found. The same way of writing this letter appears in relief in a monogram on a storage jar found at Hagar Bin Humaid in Wadi Beihan, now in the Republic of Yemen (Albright 1956: 9-10; Van Beek 1956: 6-9); this example is dated to "before 700 BCE," perhaps to the 9th century BCE. IP 47. E2/3305; L. 601; Str. 10. On this sherd the letters h (Y) and / (1) are very clearly visible. The next sign is incomplete, consisting of a vertical stroke to which is added a diagonal line ()). It could possibly be restored to read y (^). The reading HLY might indicate a personal name, similar to HLL on IP 46 above. For both names, see Harding 1971: 197-99. 26</page><page sequence="34">IP 48. G 4738; Surf.; Unstr. The sherd consists of the shoulder of a closed vessel with the lower part of a handle. Immediately below the base of the handle is a sign which could be read q (Ý). However, it is more likely that this is a monogram composed of two antithetical ďs (Ý). DD might also be a personal name; compare Harding 1971: 236. IP 49. G 4661; L. 799; Str. 10C-B. The fourth incised sherd is more difficult to read, since the incision on it is not clearly identifiable as an ancient South Arabian letter or monogram. If rotated 180 degrees, the sign may be read as a b (n) and a g (-*), or alternatively as a single letter (TT) if the horizontal lines at the ends of the vertical strokes are insignificant. If the latter interpretation is correct, it would raise the question of why the lines are there at all. The incision should perhaps best be interpreted as a potter's mark. Some remarks concerning the epigraphy and orthography of the inscriptions are in order. As pointed out above, the h (Y) found on IP 46 and IP 49 is similar to those found on ancient monumental inscriptions in South Arabia. But these forms also appear in South Arabian graffiti and, especially, in Thamudic and Safaitic inscriptions from Central and North Arabia. So do the other letter forms mentioned above, which depart significantly from monumental ancient South Arabian forms. Whereas the monumental forms include (i q ) and &amp;j ( d ), the Jerusalem pottery examples and the rock inscriptions have the forms *1 (y), Ý (#) anc* Ý ( d ). In addition, the reconstructed personal names on the Jerusalem sherds occur in such forms mainly 27</page><page sequence="35">in Safaitic texts rather than in ancient South Arabia. One would hope for additions to the corpus of material from Jerusalem before drawing additional conclusions. BIBLIOGRAPHY Albright, W.F. 1956. A Note on Early Sabaean Chronology.

Their initial presentation and descrip- tion were rapidly prepared by Yigal Shiloh himself and were published in a series of general articles (listed in Ariel 1990: XVII-XX). This study will discuss each of the 45 Hebrew bullae individually and in greater detail. B. Brandl (this volume, * The Hebrew version of this report was completed in 1990. The bullae were later discussed by Shoham (1994). As noted in the Preface, Yair Shoham corrected the first draft of the translation into English, but did not have the opportunity to carry out any further revisions. Some major recent studies by other authors in which the bullae are included, Davies 1991 and the recent Corpus of West Semitic Stamp Seals (Avigad and Sass 1997), have been added to the bibliography (without making indivi- dual references to them); otherwise the report has basically been left unchanged. After Yair Shoham's death, in the course of Baruch Brandl's research on the four bullae with figurative decoration, a number of new understand- ings of the technological aspects of those bullae were developed. These are presented in Chapter IV. The editor collaborated with Brandl in a reexamination of the inscribed bullae, and it was found that the new understandings are equally relevant for the inscribed bullae. Inclusions were found in the fabrics of almost all the inscribed bullae; these are seen most clearly in the photographs of B 1 (back) and B 26 (face). The strings wrapping the rolled papyrus are clearly visible in most of the photographs of the backs of the bullae, as is the concavity of the backs. The folding of the clay over the loops before sealing was often visible from the side, though no views of this are presented here. Signs of the four holes for the loops of the knotted strings are most clearly seen in the photo- graphs of B 10, 18 and 34 {Editor). Chapter IV) will discuss the four bullae with figurative decoration. Both the preparation of the bullae for this publication and the writing of this text were begun after the untimely death of Prof. Shiloh. Nevertheless, his influence is felt throughout this discussion. He viewed the bullae as the jewel in the crown of the City of David finds, and spared no effort in their decipherment and dating. His publications and notes provided the groundwork for this discussion. The descriptions and commentaries were written under the guidance of Prof. J. Naveh. I am most grateful to him for his generous help in reading the bullae, clarifying the text and suggesting bibliogra- phy. A. Yardeni drew the bullae and assisted in their reading. Members of the City of David excavation staff - D.T. Ariel, J.M. Cahill, A. De Groot, E. Mazar and D. Tarler - read the manuscript and offered many valuable comments. The original Hebrew text was translated by T. Schneider. The bullae were photographed by Z. Radovan. I thank all of the above for their help. The Hebrew bullae are presented in numerical order from 1 to 45. This order differs from that of the inventory numbers given to the bullae as they were registered, which continued to be used in the preliminary publications. The change was moti- vated by the desire to present the bullae in a logical order rather than the arbitrary one in which they were discovered. The bullae are illustrated at a scale of 2:1. I. THE BULLAE AND THEIR ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXT The bullae were discovered in the summer of 1982 during the fifth season of excavations in the City of David. They were found in Area G, at the northern 29</page><page sequence="37">end of the excavations, along the eastern crest of the City of David spur. In this area a complex of structures was exposed, all belonging to Stratum 10 and dating from the second half of the 7th and the early 6th centuries BCE. The bullae were found in one of these buildings, which became known as the "House of the Bullae." Their discovery and stratigraphical context were described by Shiloh in a number of publications (see especially Shiloh 1984: 17-20; 1985: 73-79; 1986a: 16-25; 1986b: 2-8); the final excavation report of Area G is currently being prepared for publication. The building complex of Stratum 10 was apparently built in King Josiah's reign and was destroyed with the fall of Jerusalem in 587/6 BCE. The complex extended over two terrace levels, the upper one some five meters higher than the lower, which were divided by a massive retaining wall, W. 753 (for plans and sections see Shiloh 1984: Figs. 19-22, 25; 1986a: Figs. 1-5). On the upper terrace, to the west of the retaining wall, several dwellings were uncovered, including the "House of Ahiel" and the "Burnt Room." In all these buildings, remains from the final stage of the First Temple period were found (Shiloh 1984: 18-19). The "House of the Bullae" (L. 967) was located on the lower terrace, with the retaining wall (W. 753) serving as its western wall. Because of the limited extent of the excavation at this spot, no other walls of this structure were found and only a narrow strip measuring 7 x 1 m was exposed. In this area were found two superimposed floor levels, made of earth and packed plaster. The earlier level, L. 1110 of Stratum 10C, apparently dates from the second half of the 7th century. Some time before the destruction of the city, the floor was renovated and an additional thick layer of plaster was laid. On this floor (L. 967 of Stratum 10B) were scattered remains of the destruction, among them the bullae, in a layer some 0.70 m thick. The debris also contained pottery, stone vessels, metal objects and arrowheads; among approximately 25 pottery ves- sels were burnished bowls, cooking pots, jars and decanters, a typical Judean assemblage of the late First Temple period (Shiloh 1984: 18-19, PL 34:2; 1986a: 23-25, Fig. 6). The bullae were thus discovered in an assemblage which may be independently dated to the late 7th and early 6th centuries BCE. Among the stone vessels in the "House of the Bullae" were four square stands, 0.20 m high, made of hewn white limestone. Each had a shallow round depression on top. Their appearance suggests a cultic use (Shiloh 1984: 18-19, PL 34:2; 1986a: 23; for an alternative suggestion, see Herzog 1987: 126). Close to the stands were found two deep pottery kraters with high bases and drainage holes underneath. Above the base, the entire surface of each krater was wheel burnished to a high standard. Kraters such as these are exceedingly rare in the City of David and in the Jerusalem area. The discovery of these unusual vessels alongside the bullae attests to the unique character of the "House of the Bullae": it was apparently a public building which was also used for the storage of written documents. The first bullae came to light on August 3rd, 1982 during routine sieving of the destruction level 30</page><page sequence="38">in the "House of the Bullae." The rest were exposed during the following days. With the discovery of the first bullae, the pace of work was slowed and excavation was restricted to small tools. Each bucket of soil was examined meticulously. As work continued, the excavators were able to establish that most of the bullae were concentrated in the northwestern corner of the "House of the Bullae," in an area no larger than one square meter (Shiloh 1986a: 22-23, Fig. 5).

Two fragments were so small and badly damaged that they were totally illegible; they were ultimately put to use as samples in Instru- mental Neutron Activation Analysis tests carried out by the archaeometry laboratory of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Several other fragments could be joined to form two complete bullae (our B 24 and 38). Four of the bullae (B 46-49) bear figurative decoration; these are published separately by B. Brandl (this volume, Chapter IV). The 45 remaining bullae, and the names appearing on them, are treated in detail here. Bullae were used to seal scrolls and written documents. A lump of clay was affixed to the string tying the scroll in order to prevent the document from being opened by the wrong hands. The reverse sides of the bullae from the City of David still bear the imprints of strings and papyrus fibers. The bulla was stamped as soon as the document was sealed, while the clay was still soft. Over time the clay dried and hardened. In order to open the scroll, the bulla had to be detached from the string, sometimes by breaking it; the detachment of the bulla was a sign that the document had been opened. On bullae and their use, see Aharoni 1975: 19-20; Avigad 1976: 3; 1986: 18-19, 120-30; Shiloh 1985: 78-80, 84; 1986a: 25-27, 34-36; 1986b: 5-6. The average size of the bullae is approximately 12 X 14 mm. The largest (B 12) measures 16 x 19 mm, and the smallest (B 17) 10 x 11 mm. The seal impressions on the bullae measure 9x11 mm on average. The dimensions of all the bullae and seal impressions appear in Table 1. Most of the bullae can be read with ease. The conflagration which destroyed the City of David, though it burned all the scrolls, fired the clay of the bullae, thereby helping to preserve the seal impressions on them. Missing or unclear letters could be restored with reasonable accuracy. Only two impressions (B 22 and 43) were so totally illegible that neither of the names was decipherable. On four bullae (B 6, 11, 38, 40) only one of the two names could be read. All the rest were clear and the writing could be read with a high degree of certainty. II. THE BULLAE B 1. G 11600. i (Belonging) to Bilgai h]n&gt;tn ì son of Delayah[u] This bulla is complete but damaged along the edges, especially on the left side. The impression is incomplete. The script is careless. The letter w aw at the end of the second line is illegible because of the damage to the bulla. The two lines of the inscription are separated by two parallel lines and the seal impression is surrounded by an oval linear frame. The name Bilgai appears in the Bible (Neh. 10:9 MT; Neh. 10:8 RSV) and on other seals (Avigad 1970b: 307, No. 5). It occurs on two other bullae from the City of David, B 20 and 21. The name Delayahu appears on B 25 as well as in the Bible and in other inscriptions (Aharoni 1975: 22-24; Tur-Sinai 1987: 244-46, No. 22). Variations on this name are also known: ydlyhw , dlh, dlyw (Yadin et al. 1960: 74-75, Pl. CLXXII; Avigad 1969: 2, Nos. 3^). All these names are derived from the root dlh , meaning "to raise, to elevate, to rescue." 32</page><page sequence="40">B 2. G 11601. irmoab (Belonging) to Gemaryahu pvy ļ[n] [s]on of Shaphan Both the bulla and its impression are broken. The script, which is clear and fine, was incised by a skilled engraver, as one would expect for the seal of a high-ranking official (see below). At the end of the second line is a tiny raised dot filling the remaining space. The impression is framed by a double line. The name Gemaryahu appears on one seal (Avigad 1989: 95, No. 15) and in inscriptions from Arad and Lachish (Torczyner 1938: 22-25, No. 1; Aharoni 1981: 56-58, 65, 67, 71, Nos. 31, 35, 38, 40; Tur-Sinai 1987: 1-3). At the City of David, it also appears on B 19 and perhaps on B 11. The name Shaphan is known from the Bible and from Phoenician inscriptions (Benz 1972: 184, 424). Prof. Shiloh proposed the identification of the man whose name appears on this bulla with the biblical scribe Gemaryahu son of Shaphan, a contemporary of Jeremiah (Jer. 36:9 ff.). According to this suggestion, the bulla was impressed with the seal of the scribe Gemaryahu son of Shaphan, who was active at the royal court of Jehoiakim in Jerusalem shortly before the destruction of the First Temple (Shiloh 1985: 83-85; 1986a: 33-34). It should be borne in mind, however, that the names found on the bullae were popular in ancient times and it is equally possible that there is no connection between the names found on the bullae and the person mentioned in the Bible. Still at issue is the question whether the Gemaryahu son of Shaphan mentioned in the book of Jeremiah was in fact a scribe. Shiloh was of the opinion that he was both a scribe and an official at the court of Jehoiakim (Shiloh 1986a: 34; Shiloh and Tarier 1986: 204-205; see also Yeivin 1971: 548). Avigad took a different view, that Gemaryahu son of Shaphan was merely an official and not a scribe at all (Avigad 1986: 29, 129, n. 164). In support of his view, he notes the absence of the title "scribe" from the City of David bulla: "It is very unlikely that a royal scribe would omit his title from his own seal." However, the absence of the title "scribe" on the bulla does not constitute evidence that Gemaryahu was not a scribe. First, it may merely indicate that the person named on the bulla is not the individual mentioned in the Bible. If the identification is accepted, it is generally agreed that the Gemaryahu son of Shaphan of the Bible was, at the very least, a royal minister; yet this title is also missing from his bulla from the City of David. Moreover, if we are correct in our assumption that B 4-6 from the City of David all refer to the same man (see the discussion of B 6), then we have another individual whose title - "the healer" - does not occur on all his seals. It would seem, therefore, that office-holders or members of professions did not always insist that their titles appear on all their seals. The absence of a title is not necessarily a decisive argument. B 3. G 11602. (Belonging) to hnmlk twym» (son of) Yishma"el This bulla is complete but slightly damaged. The impression is incomplete: its upper section is slightly damaged and the kaf at the end of the first line is incomplete. The lamed is tilted to one side in order to fit it into the frame of the seal. Two parallel lines separate the two lines of script. 33</page><page sequence="41">The name hnmlk is known from Phoenician and Punic inscriptions (Benz 1972: 125, 313-15). The element hn is common in Phoenician names, for example Haniba'al and Hanimelqart. It also appears in the biblical name Hanni'el and in the name hrib of the Samaria ostraca (Reisner et al. 1924: 235, No. 30). This name should probably therefore be pronounced Hannimelek, parallel to the biblical Hanni'el. Another possible pronun- ciation is Hinimelek, from the root hen , meaning "beauty." The name Yishma"el is frequently found in the Bible and in seals (Diringer 1934: 203, 210, Nos. 45, 53; Hestrin and Dayagi 1979: 81, 101, Nos. 57, 77; Lemaire 1985: 29, No. 1; Avigad 1986: 64-66, 74, Nos. 78-82, 101-102). B 4. G 11653. o (Belonging) to tbšlm Ttt p son of zkr This bulla is damaged and its impression is incomplete and very shallow. The last letter in the upper line is incomplete but is probably a mem. The lines are separated by a floral pattern. The name tbšlm also appears in B 5 and is restored in B 6. It was found in the Lachish ostraca, on a seal from 'En Gedi and in an Aramaic inscription from Arad (Torczyner 1938: 23-26, 123-24, 182-83, Nos. 1, 7, 18; Mazar 1976: 375; Naveh 1981: 167, No. 39; Tur-Sinai 1987: 1, 9-11, 173, 193-94). Tbšlm should apparently be pro- nounced Tobshillem, meaning "[God] has paid well" (Torczyner 1938: 26; Tur-Sinai 1987: 9-11). Tobshalom is another possible pronunciation. The name zkr appears repeatedly on seals and ostraca (Diringer 1934: 204-206, Nos. 46-47; Avigad 1975: 67-68; 1986: 52-53, Nos. 50-51; Aharoni 1981: 67, 79, 93, Nos. 38, 48, 67). In the Bible, Zekher (~D') is found together with Zakkur ("ïDt), the plene spelling of the name, both being derived from the root zkr , meaning "remember." The name on the City of David bulla may be pronounced either way as well. For further possibilities, see B 5. B 5. G 11621. ļi ob'yioÎ7 (Belonging) to tbšlm son of "Dm bnzkr This bulla is complete. The impression is incom- plete, though all of its letters may be read. The two lines of script are separated by three thin lines; one line frames the impression. The name tbšlm' is discussed in B 4. The word bn (son [of]) is written twice, once in each line. It is possible that this is a rare error and that the reading should be " tbšlm son of zkr" as in B 4. However, it is more likely that the element bn in the lower line is part of the name and that the father of tbšlm was Ben-Zekher or Ben-Zakkur. The reading Ben- Zakhar Corp) proposed by Prof. Naveh is also a possibility; this name celebrates the birth of a male child and seems to be analogous with the biblical name Re'uben and the Phoenician Ben Hodesh (-p win) (Benz 1972: 89, 287, 308). The man named Ben Hodesh was apparently born at the beginning of 34</page><page sequence="42">the month, a fact that his parents wished to be expressed in his name. Another possibility is that bnzkr is a nickname and that tbšlm' s father had a given name besides bnzkr. Many epithets introduced by the element bn are found in the Bible, the Mishnah and other inscriptions (Clines 1972: 282-87; Naveh 1990: 108- 23). A well-known example is the list of Solomon's officials in 1 Kings. 4:8 ff., where some officers have nicknames, such as Ben-Deker, Ben-Hesed and Ben- Geber, rather than given names. Of the fifteen custodians appointed to serve in the Temple named in Mishnah Sheqalim 5:1, four are listed by their patronymic rather than their own name: Ben- 'Ahiyah, Ben-Geber, Ben-Babai and Ben-'Arzah. Other instances are found in the Lachish and Arad inscriptions (Aharoni 1981: 80-82, No. 49; Tur- Sinai 1987: 200, 243, No. 19). This kind of name, it would seem, is not exceptional. Some scholars believe that these names were common among royal functionaries, whose occupations and names were passed down from father to son (Alt 1950: 9-24; Loewenstamm 1954: 154). Others contend that these were informal names used only in the presence of family and friends, and bearing no relationship to public offices (Naveh 1990: 116-23). The combination bn-zkr or bnzkr appears three times on City of David bullae (B 4-6); it was restored on B 6 because of the faulty impression (Shiloh 1986a: 32). In all cases it refers to the father of the seal's owner, while only the owner's given name ( tbšlm ) appears. Probably, as Shiloh proposed, all three seals belonged to the same person, tbšlm son of bnzkr , "the healer" of B 6. If this is correct, it is noteworthy that the name or epithet bnzkr appears on the seal of someone who held a title, "the healer" (see B 6). Perhaps the use of the epithet was meant to underscore the importance of its owner and to emphasize that the healer tbšlm belonged to a prominent family {bnzkr) whose members entered the medical profession. B 6. G 11603. [obvnoî?] [(Belonging) to tbšlm ] "Dt yi son of zkr N£nn the healer This bulla is complete, though its impression is incomplete. The exceptional three registers of the impression are separated by two sets of two parallel lines. The upper register is badly damaged and totally illegible, while on the remaining two the writing is clear. A star decoration, similar to that on B 39, fills the space at the end of the middle line. The name zkr was discussed above (B 4); as was pointed out there, the name could be read as either Zekher or Zakkur. The title "the healer" ( hrp ') is the title or profession of the seal's owner (Shiloh 1986a: 32). Rapha' is known as a personal name, but here the definite article he converts this name into a title. This is the only known occurrence of the title "the healer" in Hebrew glyptics. The Bible seldom refers to this profession (Jer. 8:22; 2 Chr. 16:12, and elsewhere). Healers practicing in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia were apparently public officials (Leibovitch 1976: 407-11), and it is more than likely that the healer on this City of David bulla was one as well. Other titles have been found on bullae and seals (Hestrin and Dayagi 1979: 16-24, Nos. 1-9; Avigad 1981: 303-305; 1986: 21-29, Nos. 1-9; 1988: 9-12). The best known are "the Scribe," "Governor of the City" and "Royal Steward"; all are titles of officials (Mazar 1986: 131-33). The missing name in the upper line may be restored by analogy with the names on B 4-5. The common denominator linking these bullae is the combination bn-zkr , giving rise to the proposal that all three seals belonged to the same person (Shiloh 35</page><page sequence="43">1986a: 32). If this is correct, then the upper line can be restored as "(Belonging) to tbšlm ," just as on B 4-5. Moreover, as with B 5, we may propose that the element bn in the second line is an integral part of the name of the father of the seal's owner, who was known as bnzkr. Working on the hypothesis (and it is no more than that) that all three seals belonged to the same person, B 6 could be read: "[Belonging to tbšlm] &lt;sonof&gt; bnzkr the healer." B 7. G 11606. i vnvybNb (Belonging) to 'Elishama' [iJrVDQü 1 son of Semakhyah[u] This bulla and its impression are slightly damaged at the bottom. The script is clear and fine. In the lower line, the words bn and smkyhw are separated by a dot. The letter waw, at the end of the line, is incorporated in the line of the frame. The inscription is framed by a double line. The name 'Elishama' is common in the Bible and on seals (Lemaire 1985: 31, No. 6; Avigad 1986: 23- 24, 59, 101, Nos. 4, 66, 158-60). It is also known from Ammonite seals (Vattioni 1978: Nos. 352, 386; Hestrin and Dayagi 1979: 138, No. 111). It appears on three other bullae from the City of David, B 18, 26 and 35. The name Semakhyahu is found in the Bible, on seals and in the Lachish letters (Torczyner 1938: 79- 86, 147, 153, Nos. 4, 11, 13; Hestrin and Dayagi 1979: 112, 120, Nos. 88, 96; Avigad 1986: 71, 81-82, Nos. 93, 119; Tur-Sinai 1987: 106-12, 183, 185-87). B 8. G 11607. (Belonging) to Mikhaya[hu] p son of hsy This bulla and its impression are broken. The impression is incomplete. The three first letters of the upper register are clearly visible, followed by the lower half of the letter yod. There remains room for two letters to complete the upper line, which can be restored as "(Belonging) to Mikhafyahu]." Other names such as Makhi or Makhir, which are found in the Bible, cannot be ruled out but are less likely, since they would leave a space at the end of the line. The name Mikhayahu appears on B 32 as well. In the Bible, it is written in plene spelling and pronounced Mikhayehu or Mikhayahu. This name appears on other seals and on an ostracon from Jerusalem's Jewish Quarter (Avigad 1980: 41; 1983: 41; 1986: 70-73, Nos. 90-92, 94-97). The name hsy appears on one Hebrew seal and perhaps in an inscription from Arad (Avigad 1954: 149; Aharoni 1981: 114, No. 101). The names Yahs'el (břom&gt;) (Gen. 46:24) and Yahasi'el (twsrv) (1 Chr. 7:13) appear in the Bible, while yhs was found on a seal (Diringer 1934: 171-72, No. 10). All these names derive from the Arabic root hzy , apparently meaning "good will" (Avigad 1954: 149). B 9. G 11608. mûNb (Belonging) to 'Ephrah in&gt;HN (son of) 'Ahiyahu This bulla and its impression are complete, with large, clear letters. The two lines of the inscription are separated by two parallel lines. The name 'Ephrah (son of) 'Ahiyahu also appears on B 10. Both bullae were impressed by the same seal. 36</page><page sequence="44">The name 'Ephrah has been found on other bullae and seals (Hestrin and Dayagi 1979: 75, 112, Nos. 51, 88; Avigad 1986: 37-39, Nos. 19-23). It also occurs on B 17. The name can be pronounced either 'Ephroah or 'Ephrah; the latter is apparently preferable (Avigad 1986: 37). The name 'Ahiyahu appears in the Bible, seals and Hebrew inscriptions (Torczyner 1938: 51-59, No. 3; Aharoni 1962: 15-16; Avigad 1986: 34, 103, Nos. 13, 166; Tur-Sinai 1987: 53, 83). On one seal, the name 'hyw was found (Avigad 1975: 70, No. 16). B 10. G 11617. mûNt? (Belonging) to 'Ephrah irvñtN] (son of) ['A]hiyahu This bulla is complete. The impression is incomplete, with damage in its lower part; it is identical to B 9. B 11. G 11610. [inMwnrfr (Belonging) to Hosha'ya[hu] h]fp[ ] (son of) [ 1 yah[u] This bulla is broken on the upper right. The impression is incomplete, with the lower part missing entirely. The script is careless and difficult to read. The two lines of the inscription are separated by two parallel lines. Above the lines are two round knobs. The upper register can be read tentatively as "(Belonging) to Hosha'ya[hu]." The letter 'ayin is very blurred but its rounded shape makes it recognizable. If this reconstruction is correct, the last two letters in the line had to be squeezed into place, and the letter waw is either incomplete or incorporated into the line of the frame encircling the impression. The name Hosha'yahu is frequent in the Bible, on seals and in inscriptions from Lachish, Mesad Hashavyahu and Hurvat 'Uza (Torczyner 1938: 51- 52, No. 3; Naveh 1964: 158; Hestrin and Dayagi 1979: 77, 96-97, Nos. 53, 72-73; Avigad 1986: 42, 48, 49-51, Nos. 28, 41, 43-48 and others; Beit-Arieh 1986-87: 32-35; Tur-Sinai 1987: 53, 56). This name also appears on two other bullae from the City of David, B 25 and 31. In the lower line, the letters are fragmentary. The only letter that can be identified with certainty is a 37</page><page sequence="45">yod on the left side of the line. It is followed by a he. Preceding these are four barely discernible letters. The first is probably a nun , the last letter of the word bn. Next are perhaps a gime I, a mem and a res h whose head is missing. If this reading is correct, the lower line can be restored as [b]n gmryhw (for the name Gemaryahu, see B 2). B 12. G 11611. in&gt;y*T&gt;b (Belonging) to Yeda'yahu ot?vyn p son of Meshullam This large bulla is complete, and its impression is almost complete. The script is crude and careless, executed by an unskilled engraver. The last letter of each line is incomplete owing to lack of space. A round knob fills the space at the beginning of the lower line. The name Yeda'yahu is known from seals and inscriptions (Avigad 1970b: 305, No. 1; 1986: 60-61, Nos. 68-69; Aharoni 1981: 56-58, 68, Nos. 31, 39). In the Bible the name is written in its defective form, Yeda'yah, while in the Samaria ostraca the form yďyw is used (Reisner et al. 1924: 233, 236, 237, Nos. 1, 42, 48) Meshullam is a common name in the Bible, seals and inscriptions (Vattioni 1969: 366, 379, Nos. 55- 56, 189-90; 1978: No. 358; Aharoni 1981: 68, No. 39; Rainey 1981: 122-23, No. 110; Avigad 1986: 63, 70-71, 77-78, Nos. 75, 92, 110-11). B 13. G 11612. (Belonging) to Gaddiyahu nty p son of 'Ezer This bulla and its impression are complete. The lower line is very clear, while the upper line is somewhat more difficult to read. The letter z ay in in the lower line has the unusual shape of three lines emerging from the same point. The two registers are separated by a strip of net decoration. The name Gaddiyahu appears on other bullae (Avigad 1986: 39-41, 104-105, Nos. 23-24, 26, 169). It is the equivalent of the biblical name Gaddi'el. A similar name, gdyw , was found in the Samaria ostraca (Reisner et al. 1924: 233-36, Nos. 2, 4, 6, 16- 18 ff.). The name 'Ezer, too, is common on Hebrew seals (Vattioni 1978: Nos. 340, 355, 369-70; Avigad 1979: 126; 1986: 56, 90, Nos. 57, 135). In the Bible, it is pronounced 'Ezer (1 Chr. 7:21, 12:9 and elsewhere) and it appears once as 'Azzur (Ezek. 11:1). B 14. G 11613. (Belonging) to Shema'ya[hu] hn]&gt;t?nň (son of) Mahseya[hu] This bulla is broken. The impression is incomplete, with a script that is blurred and hard to read. The last letters of each register are not visible, and even the enclosing frame is lacking. The name Shema'yahu appears on two other bullae from the City of David (B 15 and 23); for the name, see B 15. 38</page><page sequence="46">The name Mahseyahu appears in the Bible only in its shortened form, Mahseyah. On this bulla, the longer form is preferable because of the ample space at the end of the lower line. This name is also known from other bullae (Avigad 1986: 65, 67-68, Nos. 80, 85-86). B 15. G 11604. [(Belonging) to] Shema'yahu hn]&gt;MN&gt; p son of Ya'azanya[hu] This bulla is damaged along the edges and its impression is incomplete. The writing of the lower line is so crowded that the letters of the word bn have been forced onto their sides. The last two letters of this line cannot easily be read because of the poor impression: with great difficulty, it is possible to discern what might be the tip of the horizontal line of the letter he. The lines are separated by a stylized motif of a flower flanked by two leaves, a recurring design on the bullae of the City of David. The name Shema'yahu is common in the Bible, on seals and in Hebrew inscriptions (Torczyner 1938: 76-81, No. 4; Aharoni 1981: 53, 56-58, Nos. 27, 1; Avigad 1986: 42, 44, 47, Nos. 29, 33, 38 ff.; Tur-Sinai 1987: 106-12, 200-13, Nos. 4, 19). It appears on two other bullae from the City of David (B 14 and 23). The name Ya'azanyahu occurs on seals and in inscriptions (Torczyner 1938: 23-26, No. 1; Hestrin and Dayagi 1979: 20, No. 5; Tur-Sinai 1987: 8-9). It also appears on B 41. B 16. G 11615. hrpbntó (Belonging) to Netanfyahu] [o]m ļ[n] [s]on of rh[m ] This bulla is damaged. The impression is incomplete: several letters are damaged as a result of pressure from fingers along the edges. The undamaged letters are very clear and the restoration of the missing letters is reasonably certain. The name Netanyahu is found in the Bible, on seals and in inscriptions (Diringer 1934: 190-92, Nos. 31-32; Avigad 1979: 126, No. 11; Aharoni 1981: 45, 87, Nos. 23, 56). The name rhm appears in the later books of the Bible, once as Raham (om) (1 Chr. 2:44) and several times as Rehum (oim) in plene spelling (e.g. 39</page><page sequence="47">Ezra 4:8 ff.; Neh. 3:17). The latter pronunciation of the name also appears once in defective spelling in Neh. 12:3, but this is probably a corruption ( Enc . Biblica 1976: 352-53). Though our bulla can be read as Raham or Rehum, Raham is preferable, since Rehum is apparently an Aramaic name. The root rhm is part of other biblical names, such as Yeroham and Yerahme'el. B 17. G 11616. irpNínt? (Belonging) to Repha'yahu m£)N p son of 'Ephrah This bulla and its impression are complete, with a clear and fine script. The two lines of the inscription are separated by a stylized floral motif. The name Repha'yahu appears on bullae and seals (Avigad 1986: 78, 82, Nos. Ill, 121). It also appears in the shortened form Rapha' (Vattioni 1978: Nos. 377-78; Avigad 1986: 49, 93-94, Nos. 42, 141). For the name 'Ephrah see B 9; it also appears on B 10. B 18. G 11609. ynwbNt? (Belonging) to 'Elishama' iNim p son of Yeho'ab This bulla is complete. The impression is incomplete. The letters are large but crowded, particularly in the lower line. Here, the letter nun stands out because of the curve of its downstroke, an uncommon form in the script of seals. The head of the w aw also has an unusual shape. A large and attractive floral motif separates the two registers. The name 'Elishama' occurs on three other bullae from the City of David (B 7, 26 and 35); for the name, see B 7. In the initial publications of the bullae, the name in the second line was read as either Yeho'ab or Yeho'ar (iNim), since the last letter is not at all clear. However, a closer examination of this letter indicates that, since the bottom stroke un- mistakably bends to the left, it can only be a bet. The name should therefore be read Yeho'ab, a name that appears on seals and bullae and in the Arad inscriptions (Aharoni 1981: 68-69, 80-82, 89, Nos. 39, 49, 59; Avigad 1986: 43, No. 31; Avigad 1989: 93, No. 8), as well as on B 37. In the Bible, the name appears only in its shortened form, Yo'ab. B 19. G 11618. [ilňno^ (Belonging) to Gemaryah[u] ym p son of Magen 40</page><page sequence="48">This bulla is complete. The impression is incomplete. The script is coarse. The he at the end of the first line is incomplete and no space remained for the waw following it, which may have been incorporated in the line of the frame. The space left at the end of the lower line is filled by a branch. The name Gemaryahu also appears on B 2 and perhaps on B 11; for the name, see B 2. The name Magen is known from the seal impressions of Tanhum son of Magen, which have turned up at Lachish, Gibeon and Ramat Rahel (Aharoni 1964: 32; Vattioni 1969: 379, No. 192). B 20. G 11619. [(Belonging)] to 'Elnatan ļi son of Bilgai This bulla is damaged and its impression is incomplete. The script is fine. All the letters are clear except for the lamed at the beginning of the upper line. The registers are separated by two parallel lines ending in a rounded geometric design. The name 'Elnatan appears in the Bible, on bullae and on seals, including several Aramaic seals (Avigad 1976: 5-6, 11, Nos. 5, 14; 1986: 42-43, No. 30; 1989: 95, No. 15; Hestrin and Dayagi 1979: 104, 170, Nos. 80, 133). For the name Bilgai, see B 1. The inscription 'Elnatan son of Bilgai also occurs on B 21. The bullae, however, are not identical, the main difference being the design separating the two lines of writing. The script on both bullae is very much alike, and it is evident that both seals were made by the same craftsman. This similarity upholds the view that 'Elnatan son of Bilgai had two different seals (Shiloh 1986a: 29), apparently an indication of his importance. B 21. G 11687. (Belonging) to 'Elnatan ļ[n] [s]on of Bilgai This bulla is complete. The impression is incomplete. The script is clear and fine. The first letter of the lower line is missing, owing to a chip on the bulla and a defect on the seal. The two lines are separated by a stylized flower. The name 'Elnatan son of Bilgai also appears on B 20; the name 'Elnatan is discussed there, and Bilgai under B 1. As stated above, although B 20 and 21 refer to the same person, they are not identical. B 22. G 11620. [ ]b (Belonging) to [ ] I ] [ ] 41</page><page sequence="49">This bulla is damaged and broken. The impression is incomplete. The letter lamed is seen at the beginning of the upper line, apparently followed by a pe. The third letter is relatively tall and may be a samekh. Prof. J. Naveh suggested that the upper line be read: "(Itelonging) to Paseah." This name is known from the Bible and seals (Avigad 1969: 1, No. 1). The letters of the lower line are very blurred. The third letter could be a dalet , the fourth a bet or resh followed by, possibly, a taw. This could be a title of some sort, but the reading is not at all certain. B 23. G 11622. irvvBwt? (Belonging) to Shema'yahu irwbo ļh] [s]on of Pelatyahu This bulla is broken in its lower part. The impression is incomplete. The script is careless. The letter bet is missing at the beginning of the lower line, apparently owing to faulty impressing. The letter waw at the end of the lower line is incorporated into the double lines of the frame. The impression is framed by two parallel lines. The name Shema'yahu appears on two other City of David bullae (B 14 and 15); for the name, see B 15. The name Pelatyahu is found in the Bible and on seals and bullae (Vattioni 1978: No. 379; Avigad 1986: 67-68, 72, 79-81, Nos. 86, 94, 114-16 and elsewhere; 1989: 92, Nos. 5-6). B 24. G 11623. [l]ñ[&gt;7]DVb (Belonging) to Tmma[diya]h[u] irPWN (son of) 'Ashyahu This damaged bulla was joined from two parts which were found separately, rendering it essentially complete. The impression is incomplete. In the first line the letters lamed and mem can clearly be seen. Between them, an 'ayin can just be made out, and at the end of the line, a he. The first line can therefore safely be restored as "(Belonging) to Tmmadiyahu." The name Tmmadiyahu has been found on seals and on an ostracon from Hurvat 'Uza; it is occasionally used as a woman's name (Diringer 1934: 218, No. 61; Avigad 1986: 71, No. 93; Lemaire 1986: 309, No. 3; Beit-Arieh 1986-87: 34-35). At Tel Dan, two impressions bearing the similar name Tmmadiyo were discovered (Biran 1988: 16). The lower line clearly reads 'Ashyahu, a familiar name on bullae and seals (Aharoni 1975: 22-23; 1981: 32-33, 85, 119, Nos. 17, 51, 105-107; Avigad 1986: 44, 75-76, 77-78, Nos. 33, 105, 110). It is possible to pronounce this name as 'Eshyahu, equivalent to the biblical 'Eshba'al (bynwN) (Aharoni 1981: 32-33). A greater similarity is evident in the biblical name Yeho'ash (wNin&gt;), which uses the same components in reverse order (Avigad 1986: 44); the pronunciation 'Ashyahu is thus preferable. B 25. G 11624. p (Belonging) to Delaya[hu] son of in win Hosha'yahu This bulla is damaged and broken. The impression is incomplete. At least two letters are missing from the upper line, but from those that are preserved, it is possible to restore "(Belonging) to Delaya[hu]." 42</page><page sequence="50">At the end of the line, only the lower part of a nun is visible. In the second line, the writing is clear. The name Delayahu also appears on B 1 and is discussed there. Hosha'yahu also occurs on B 11 and 31; for this name, see B 11. B 26. G 11644. inňfcO [(Belonging) to 'U]ziyahu VDvyfcN (son of) ['Elijshama' This bulla and its impression are broken, with the right side missing. In the first line four letters are preserved. The first seems to be the letter zayin. Directly below it in the lower line, a shin is just visible. All the other letters are clear. The two lines of the inscription are separated by a double line ending with a round geometric motif, similar to that in B 20. The inscription can be restored as "[(Belonging to) 'Ujziyahu (son of) ['Elijshama'." The name 'Uziyahu is known from the Bible and seals (Diringer 1934: 196-97, No. 37; Hestrin and Dayagi 1979: 89, No. 65; Avigad 1986: 58, 106, Nos. 63, 177). The name 'Elishama' also appears on B 7, 18 and 35; see B 7 for more on this name. B 27. G 11652. i inntyb (Belonging) to 'Azaryahu irppbn ì son of Hilqiyahu This bulla and its impression are complete. The script is clear and fine. The letters at both ends of each line are either incorporated in the line framing the impression or cross it. The frame probably had a second line, but this is not visible. The name 'Azaryahu occurs frequently in the Bible and on seals (Diringer 1934: 184, 199, Nos. 24, 40; Hestrin and Dayagi 1979: 38-39, 90, Nos. 23-24, 66; Avigad 1986: 91, Nos. 136-37). It also appears on B 38 and 42. Hilqiyahu is also a popular name (Hestrin and Dayagi 1979: 19, 42, 79-81, Nos. 4, 27, 55-57; Avigad 1986: 56-57, 76-77, Nos. 58-59, 107). The inscription "'Azaryahu son of Hilqiyahu" was found on a seal apparently discovered somewhere in Judah (Avigad 1970b: 307, No. 4). Our bulla was stamped by a different seal, but this needs not rule out the possibility that the name refers to the same individual. It has also been suggested that 'Azaryahu son of Hilqiyahu of the bulla from the City of David should be identified with one of the high priests who officiated in Jerusalem towards the end of the First Temple Period (Schneider 1988: 139^1). 43</page><page sequence="51">B 28. G 11686. îiD&gt;nNt? (Belonging) to 'hymh rrän (son of) Hananyah This bulla was joined from two fragments which were found separately. It is damaged and broken. Because of the poor, incomplete impression, the last letters of each line are blurred. It is difficult to make out a waw at the end of the lower line; thus the name Hananyah may have been spelled in its shortened form, without a waw. It must be stressed, however, that this bulla is damaged, especially around the edges, and no frame is in evidence. The name ' hymh is unknown either in the Bible or on seals. It should perhaps be pronounced 'Ahimah, similar to 'Ahiman (p&gt;nN) of the Bible. The name could also be an unknown hypo- coristicon of another name, such as 'Ahima'as or 'Ahimelekh, or a similar name. However, in the Bible it is very unusual for hypocoristica to end in a letter other than alef. It is also possible that this is a woman's name, similar to 'Ahino'am, though it is unlikely that in this case the word bt (daughter of) would have been left out. This name recalls another which appears on seals and on an Edomite ostracon from Hurvat 'Uza: 'h'mh (Bordreuil and Lemaire 1976: 48, No. 8; Beit- Arieh and Cresson 1985: 96-98; Avigad 1986: 97, No. 151). This name is a combination of the elements 'h (brother) and 'm (mother). Our name 'Ahimoh probably has a similar meaning and is a contraction or corruption of the name 'Ahi'imoh. This is a theophoric name, in the class of 'Ah'ab and 'Ahi'ab. The name Hananyah also appears on B 34; for the name, see there. B 29. G 11654. òp^tò (Belonging) to 'Elyaqim tmiN p son of 'Ohel This bulla and its impression are complete. The script is fine. The mem at the end of the first line is incomplete owing to lack of space, but all the other letters are clear. The two lines of the inscription are separated by a stylized flower motif. B 30 is an exact duplicate of this bulla; both were stamped by the same seal. The name 'Elyaqim is known from the Bible and seals (Shoham, this volume, Chapter VI, P 1; Diringer 1934: 247-48, No. 93; Hestrin and Dayagi 1979: 23-24, 41, 115, Nos. 8-9, 26, 91). The name 'Ohel appears infrequently on seals and in other epigraphic sources. It was the name of a descendant of the House of David (1 Chr. 3:20). In the Bible it is written in defective spelling, but on our bulla the plene spelling is used, with the waw serving as a mater lectionis (see below for a discussion of the orthography of the bullae). The root ' hi occurs in other biblical names such as 'Ohli'ab and 'Ohlibah, and also in the name Hami'ohel daughter of Menahem, whose seal was 44</page><page sequence="52">found in Jerusalem (Hirschberg 1955: 126-28; Hestrin and Dayagi 1979: 51, No. 34). This root also appears in the Phoenician names 'Ohelba'al and 'Ohelmelekh (Benz 1972: 60, 262). B 30. G 11655. (Belonging) to 'Elyaqim Î7D1N p son of 'Ohel This bulla is complete. The impression, though incomplete, is identical to B 29. B 31. G 11656. i mmi? (Belonging) to Benayahu inwin i son of Hosha'yahu This bulla and its impression are complete. The script is large and clear. Only the waw, the last letter of the lower line, is incomplete owing to lack of space. The name Benayahu occurs frequently in the Bible and on seals (Diringer 1934: 177, No. 18; Vattioni 1969: 361, No. 18; 1978: Nos. 299, 361, 407; Avigad 1986: 45, No. 35). The name Hosha'yahu also appears on B 11 and 25; for this name, see B 11. B 32. G 11657. (Belonging) to 'Azriqam (son of) Mikhayahu This bulla and its impression are complete. The script is crude and careless, obviously executed by an unskilled engraver. Despite ample space, the waw at the end of the lower line was not written in full. In the Bible, the name 'Azriqam appears only in plene spelling, while on bullae it is generally written in its defective form (Avigad 1986: 91-93, Nos. 138- 39). For the name Mikhayahu, see above, B 8. 45</page><page sequence="53">B 33. G 11658. irprňib (Belonging) to Berekhyahu p son of Malki This bulla is complete. The impression is incom- plete. The script is careless, with several letters formed inaccurately. In the lower line, the third letter is more likely a mem than a pe , owing to the vertical stroke at the top of the letter. The yod at the end of this line is perhaps missing its lower horizontal stroke. The two lines of the inscription are separated by a large floral motif. The name Berekhyahu is found in the Bible and on seals (Aharoni 1981: 120-21, No. 108; Avigad 1986: 28-29, 47, Nos. 9, 38). It also appears on B 40. The name Malki is a hypocoristicon of Malki'el or Malkiyahu; the former appears in the Bible, the latter in the Bible and epigraphic sources such as the Arad inscriptions (Aharoni 1981: 46-49, 68-69, 70- 74, Nos. 24, 39, 40). Shortened forms are known for other names, for example the biblical Gaddi and Palti. B 34. G 11659. [linoni? (Belonging) to Hananyah[u] NHN yi son of 'Aha' This bulla is complete. The impression is blemished on its left side by finger impressions. The bottom half of the letter he is discernible at the end of the upper line. The script is crude and uneven. In the lower line, several outsized letters stand out. The name Hananyahu is common in the Bible, on seals and in inscriptions (Pritchard 1959: 5-7; Aharoni 1981: 17-18, 30, 65, Nos. 3, 16, 36; Avigad 1986: 57-58, 74, Nos. 61-62, 100). It also appears on B 28. The name 'Aha' is the shortened form of the name 'Ahiyahu. Such short forms are often found in the Hebrew onomasticon, e.g. Nera' for Neriyahu, Rapha' for Repha'yahu, Shebna' for Shebnayahu. The name 'Aha' appears on seal impressions, in the Samaria ostraca and in the Arad inscriptions (Reisner et al. 1924: 237, No. 51; Hestrin and Dayagi 1979: 30, No. 15; Aharoni 1981: 80-82, 93, 97, Nos. 49, 67, 74; Shoham, this volume, Chapter VI, P 3), as well as on B 42. B 35. G 11660. i tò*&gt;tb (Belonging) to Silla' i son of 'Elishama' This bulla is complete. The impression is in- complete: several letters are unclear owing to defects in the clay. The second letter in the upper register appears to be a samekh , but this is not certain. The name Silla' appears on a seal in the Israel Museum (Hestrin and Dayagi 1979: 93, No. 69). This name has been found in defective spelling on 46</page><page sequence="54">other seals (Avigad 1986: 88-89, No. 132); thus the pronunciation Sallu', as in the Bible, is also possible. Silla' is the name of a place in the vicinity of Jerusalem: "in the house of Millo, on the way that goes down to Silla" (2 Kings 12:21 MT; 2 Kings 12:20 RSV). The name 'Elishama' also appears on B 7, 18 and 26; see B 7 for more on this name. B 36. G 11661. innDb (Belonging) to Neriyahu irpbm (son of) dmlhw This bulla is complete. The impression is incomplete. The script is fine, though the letters are cramped. The lamed at the beginning of the upper line is especially small owing to lack of space. The dalet in the lower line is incomplete. The lines separating the upper from the lower register end in the shape of a bud, a motif which also appears on B 40. The name Neriyahu appears in the Bible and is common on bullae and seals (Aharoni 1979: 21, No. 3; Hestrin and Dayagi 1979: 88-89, Nos. 64-65; Avigad 1986: 26, 28-29, 35, Nos. 7, 9, 15 ff.). The name dmlyhw appears on several seals (Diringer 1934: 178-79, Nos. 19, 60; Avigad 1986: 49-51, 170, Nos. 42-46, 170) and on B 44. It should be pronounced Demalyahu or Domlyahu. The names dmV and dml'l , which have the same meaning, are also known (Pritchard 1959: 3-4, Nos. 21, 26-29; Porten 1971: 47^9; Vattioni 1969: 384, No. 233). A seal allegedly discovered in the City of David bears the inscription "(Belonging) to dmlyhw son of Neriyahu" (Avigad and Sass 1997: 70, No. 130) - the same names as those on the City of David bulla, but in reverse order. We cannot rule out a connection between the people mentioned on the seal and the bulla, both found in Jerusalem. B 37. G 11662. iwnřO (Belonging) to 'Ahi'ab iNirv ļi son of Yeho'ab This bulla is damaged. The impression is incomplete. The script is careless: the vertical strokes are sometimes too long. The registers are separated by only one line, which is thick and crooked. 47</page><page sequence="55">The name 'Ahi'ab is unknown in the Bible and is uncommon in epigraphic sources. On this bulla, it is written in plene spelling, with the yod as a mater lectionis. The name is similar in meaning to the biblical 'Ah'ab, also found on seals (Hestrin and Dayagi 1979: 113, 133, Nos. 89, 106; Avigad 1986: 35-37, 57, Nos. 16-19, 60). For the name Yeho'ab, see B 18. B 38. G 11663. [ ]&gt;b (Belonging) to Y[ ] Mnnty p son of 4Azaryah[u] This bulla was joined from two fragments which were found separately. The impression is incom- plete. The upper part is missing, and only the two first letters of the upper register are clearly visible. The third letter seems to be a resh , while the next may be a het or an alef. At the end of the lower register, room remains for one more letter, which was probably a waw. The lines are separated by a rather large floral motif. The name 'Azaryahu appears on two other City of David bullae (B 27, 42); for the name, see B 27. B 39. G 11664. irwûvyb (Belonging) to Shephatyahu ps p son of spn This bulla is complete. The impression is in- complete. All the letters are clear except for an incomplete waw at the end of the upper register. A decorative star fills the space left at the end of the lower register. The name Shephatyahu is frequent in the Bible and on seals (Vattioni 1969: 371, No. 109; 1978: No. 372; Avigad 1986: 55, 103, 106, Nos. 56, 165, 180). It also appears on B 44. The name spn is known from seals (Hestrin and Dayagi 1979: 37-38, 114, Nos. 22-23, 90; Avigad 1986: 98-99, No. 154). It was found in the excavations of Jerusalem's Jewish Quarter on a seal impression (Saphan/'Abima'as) and in an incised inscription on a pottery jug (Prignaud 1978: 136-37, Fig. 1; Avigad 1980: 44-45; 1983: 44-45). Spn is the shortened form of Sephanyahu and should apparently be pronounced Saphan. A member of the tribe of Gad is called Sephon (lias) (Num. 26:15), and the name on our bulla could be pronounced this way as well, were it not for the defective spelling. B 40. G 11665. hri]&gt;Dnib (Belonging) to Berekhya[hu] [ ])) p son of '[ ] This bulla is broken and only the right half is preserved. The script is clear. The two registers are separated by three parallel lines ending in a bud motif. The whole impression is framed by a double line. 48</page><page sequence="56">At the beginning of the upper register the letter lamed crosses the double line of the frame. From the surviving letters the reading can be restored as "(Belonging) to Berekhyahu," a name that appears in B 33 as well (see there). Of the name in the lower line, only the first letter {'ay in) remains. B 41. G 11691. (Belonging) to Ya'azanyahu in&gt;wn ļb] [s]on of Ma'aseyahu This bulla is damaged and its impression is incomplete. The script is crowded and careless. This is especially evident in the upper line, where the letter zayin is written with three parallel strokes. A similarly drawn letter occurs in B 13. The first letter of the lower line, a bet , is missing entirely, owing to a defect in the impression. The lines are separated by a stylized flower motif. The name Ya'azanyahu also appears on B 15; for the name, see there. The name Ma'aseyahu is well known from the Bible and seals (Diringer 1934: 208-209, 212, Nos. 51, 55; Hestrin and Dayagi 1979: 41, 101, Nos. 26, 77; Avigad 1986: 68, 75-77, Nos. 87, 105, 107). B 42. G 11667. hrdnul (Belonging) to 'Azarya[hu] MnN p son of 'Ah[a'] This bulla is broken. In the upper register, only the letters lamed and zayin are clearly visible, and the lower part of a he can be made out at the end. After the he , little room remained for additional letters, and only the hint of a waw appears. The name 'Azaryahu also appears on B 27 and 38; for the name, see B 27. The name on the lower register may be restored as 'Aha', as on B 34; for the name, see there. B 43. G 11693. [ (Belonging) to yh[ ] [ ]i p son of b[ ] This bulla is broken; only part of its right side is preserved. The word bn can be read clearly at the beginning of the lower register. Restoration of the names themselves is impossible. 49</page><page sequence="57">B 44. G 11711. irwûvyt? (Belonging) to Shephatyahu ļi son of dmly[hw' This bulla is complete. Its lower part is poorly impressed. The script is careless. The letters of the upper line are clear, except for the waw , which is incomplete. The registers are separated by two parallel lines with a circle in the center, a motif similar to that of B 45. The lower line is more difficult to read. At the end, the top of a yod can be seen, followed by another letter, probably a he. The lack of space forced the maker of the seal to raise the last letters above the others, as with the first letters of this line. Both names appear on other bullae from the City of David, Shephatyahu on B 39 and dmlyhw on B 36; for the names, see there. B 45. G 11712. p orofc] (Belonging) to Nahum son of TÙHV slh This bulla is complete. The impression is incomplete, though almost all the letters can be clearly read. The registers are separated by two parallel lines with two circles. The name Nahum is well known from the Bible, bullae and seals (Vattioni 1969: 377, 380, 385, Nos. 175, 202, 244; 1978: Nos. 254, 373; Hestrin and Dayagi 1979: 32, 95, Nos. 17, 71; Avigad 1986: 64, 82, Nos. 77, 121 ff.). The name slh appears on another bulla and in the inscriptions from Wadi ed-Daliyeh (Cross 1985: 8-9, 11; Avigad 1986: 99-100, No. 155). Prof. Avigad believed that the name, constructed from "question" or "request," should be pronounced She'ila. The similar name She'al C?nw) is mentioned in Ezra 10:29 and on a post-Exilic period bulla reading "Belonging to si son of Nahum" (Avigad 1976: 32, No. 10). The City of David bulla has similar names but in reverse order. 50</page><page sequence="58">III. DISCUSSION 1. The Names and the People Fifty-four individual names were found on the City of David bullae. The most popular is 'Elishama', which appears four times. 'Azaryahu, Hosha'yahu and Shema'yahu appear three times each. The rest occur once or twice. One person, 'Elnatan son of Bilgai, apparently had two different seals (B 20 and 21). If our hypothesis that B 4, 5 and 6 refer to the same individual is correct, then tbšlm son of bnzkr owned three seals; B 6 even mentions the title of the man: "the healer." Both 'Ephrah son of 'Ahiyahu and 'Elyaqim son of 'Ohel left two bullae, but each pair (B 9-10, 29-30) was impressed by the same seal. Most of the names on the bullae are known from the Bible. However, almost one third, 17 names, do not appear in the Bible at all: 'Aha', 'Ahi'ab, ' hymh , 'Ephrah, 'Ashyahu, bnzkr , Gaddiyahu, dmlyhw, hnmlk , hsy , tbšlm , Magen, Malki, Silla', Tm- madiyahu, Repha'yahu and š'lh. Virtually none of these names is a stranger to the Hebrew onomasticon: they are also found in inscriptions and seals. Some of the names are very similar to biblical names, for instance, 'Ashyahu and Yeho'ash, 'Ahi'ab and 'Ah'ab, Gaddiyahu and Gad or Gaddi'el. Most of the names are theophoric, which is to be expected from an onomasticon dating from the late First Temple period. The predominant theophoric element is the suffix - yahu , which provides the ending for 26 names. In at least one name (Yeho'ab, and probably also the name on B 43), yahu- is a prefix. Four names use the theophoric element 'el' 'Elyaqim, 'Elnatan, 'Elishama' and Yishma"el. Other theophoric elements are ' ah , 'ab and 'em, found in the names 'Ahi'ab, 'hymh, and 'Aha'. The shortened suffix -yah appears only once in this collection, in the name Hananyah (B 28), though it should be borne in mind that this bulla was damaged at both ends and that the names on it could not be read clearly. Despite the truncated form of the name here, its usual spelling was Hananyahu, as in B 34. In other bullae the letter waw could be discerned only with difficulty at the ends of the names, since the elliptical shape of the seals left little room for the final letters. The lack of space occasionally obliged the engraver of the seal to settle for an incomplete waw or to incorporate it into the frame encircling the seal. In the most extreme cases, as in B 28, the engraver apparently omitted the letter entirely. In the onomasticon of the City of David, therefore, there is a clear preference for names ending with -yahu: there are 26 such names, some recurring two or three times. Despite some isolated exceptions (Zevit 1983: 1-16; Avigad 1987: 18-19), it would appear that the suffix -yah was not yet in common use at the time of the City of David bullae. This conclusion is in accord with the evidence from other contemporary onomastica, particularly the Lachish letters, the Arad inscriptions and the group of bullae published by Avigad (Aharoni 1981: 141; Avigad 1986: 116-17; Tur-Sinai 1987: 2-4, 14). The contracted suffix -yah did not enter common usage until after the destruction of the Temple. 2. The Script and the Letters The bullae were found in situ in Stratum 10B of the City of David. Consequently, the bullae could be securely dated on independent stratigraphie and ceramic grounds to late 7th and the early 6th centuries BCE (Shiloh 1984: 19-20; 1986a: 18-25). The firm dating of their stratigraphie context establishes the script of the City of David bullae as an important paléographie standard. The script is not uniform (see the chart of letter forms in Fig. 1). On some bullae the script is clear and skillfully rendered, on others it is careless, while on the majority it is moderate (cf. Avigad 1986: 113- 15). The quality of the script was determined, first and foremost, by the competence of the engraver. The importance and character of the seal's owner were certainly additional factors; for instance, the script on B 2, probably made for the royal official Gemaryahu son of Shaphan (if the identification is correct), is of excellent quality. The bullae with the best-executed script are B 2, 7, 17, 20, 21, 27, 29, 30 and 40. Some of the characteristics of the script are as follows. The alef has two horizontal parallel lines. The bet has a triangular head and a bent or rounded downstroke. The gimeP s top stroke extends to the left. The he has three horizontal strokes, of which the upper one crosses the downstroke. The het has three horizontal strokes enclosed by two downstrokes; the left downstroke is higher than the right. The yod resembles an English Z, with the addition of a 51</page><page sequence="59">ó JŠ 3 £ &lt;D &lt;D X c o &lt;*&gt; «§ ł-l &lt;U -t-» «4-!

The kaf has a symmetrical head of three lines. The head of the mem consists of one horizontal stroke and three short downstrokes. The samekh is relatively tall and the horizontal strokes have a sharp downward bend on the right; such additions are widespread in the script used on ostraca and are characteristic of cursive script. The head of the qof is an open circle. The shin is like an English W. The taw is like an English X. The script on the remaining bullae, which constitute the majority, is similar but less formal. The writing is irregular and the letters are not uniform in shape. For instance, the horizontal strokes of the alef are not always parallel and sometimes meet to the left of the downstroke (B 9, 13). The zayin appears in several variations, sometimes without the vertical stroke which joins the two parallel horizontal ones; in B 13, this letter even appears as three strokes emerging from one point. The horizontal stroke of the mem is not always included (B 18). The sade sometimes has a short vertical stroke from which a zigzag stroke branches out to the right (B 8, 39). These differences in the form and quality of the letters appear to lack chronological significance. All the bullae were impressed and placed together during a short period at the end of the First Temple period. They should be viewed as a single assemblage of the second half of the 7th and the early 6th centuries BCE. 3. The Orthography In the City of David bullae, the usual practice is defective spelling in the middle of the word and plene spelling at the end. This practice is common in Hebrew inscriptions from this time (Torczyner 1938: 17; Cross and Freedman 1952: 56-60; Naveh 1982: 76-77; Avigad 1986: 115; I thank Prof. J. Naveh for his help and pertinent suggestions). Defective spelling occurs in the middle of many names: 'Azriqam, Bilgai, 'Elishama', 'Elyaqim, Meshullam, Mikhayahu, Nahum, tbšlm, 'Uziyahu and others. The title hrp' ("the healer") on B 6 also uses defective spelling. Some of these names, e.g. 'Azriqam, 'Elishama', 'Elyaqim and Nahum, appear in plene spelling in the Bible. However, ancient Hebrew seals and inscriptions generally use defective spelling, as do the bullae. Exceptional cases of the use of medial maires lectionis are 'Ahi'ab, 'hymh and 'Ohel. This practice is known from other inscriptions. For example, in the Arad inscriptions, yod is used as a mater lectionis in the words h'ys, h'yr and 'hyqm (Aharoni 1981: 46- 48, 56-58, 70-72, 142, Nos. 24, 31, 40). These words appear in other inscriptions and seals without yod , leading to the conclusion that medial matres lectionis were still the exception rather than the rule. The letter waw is occasionally used as a medial mater lectionis in inscriptions to indicate the vowel sound "Ū," e.g. qrb'wr , ' wryhw , 'rwr (Avigad 1953: 143; Aharoni 1981: 46, 56, Nos. 24, 31). The use of waw to denote the vowel sound "õ" in the name 'Ohel on B 29 and 30 is of special interest. In the Bible the name is written only in defective spelling, as are other names based on the root 'hi such as 'Ohli'ab, Hami'ohel, and Phoenician names like 'Ohelba'al and 'Ohelmelekh (Benz 1972: 60, 262; Hestrin and Dayagi 1979: 51, No. 34). Such defective spellings reinforce the conclusion that the waw of the name 'Ohel at the City of David is neither part of the root nor the residue of a contracted diphthong, but functions solely as a mater lectionis denoting the vowel sound "õ" (Naveh 1983: 140). Very few additional examples of this phenomenon are known; among them are the names hwrs and hwnn from Hebrew seals, the name šwhr from an Ammonite seal, and the inscription discovered in the Temple Mount excavations and tentatively read as Iśr h'w[pm] (Diringer 1934: 180- 82, Nos. 21-22; Avigad 1970a: 286-87; Mazar 1989: 46-47; Mazar and Mazar 1989: 44-47; Nadelman 1989: 128-29). The rarity of medial plene spelling makes these names all the more exceptional, though the practice was becoming more common towards the end of the First Temple period, mostly in personal names (Zarfati 1975: 107-10; Zevit 1980: 25, 27, 31). Nevertheless, despite rare exceptions, defective spelling in mid-word was the rule. The names on the City of David bullae attest to this: while 13 names, some of them recurring, were written with medial defective spelling, only three names had plene spelling. At the end of the word plene spelling was always used, as in 'hymh, š'lh and others. There is not a single example of defective spelling at the end of the word. In the discussion of B 28, it was suggested that 'hymh should be pronounced 'Ahimoh rather than 'Ahimah; if this is the case, the letter he served as a mater lectionis representing the vowel sound "Õ." This was a common practice in Hebrew inscriptions, occurring in words such as 'mth in 53</page><page sequence="61">the yahu who is over the house" inscription from Jerusalem, 'bdh in the Mesad Hashavyahu and Lachish inscriptions, and šlhh and Iqhh , also from Lachish (Torczyner 1938: 33, 51, 79, Nos. 2 -4ģ, Cross and Freedman 1952: 56-57; Avigad 1953: 142-43; Naveh 1960: 130-31; Tur-Sinai 1987: 33-36, 88-90, 111, 125). 4. The Decorative Motifs The ornamental repertoire of the City of David bullae is limited (Figs. 2-3). Most of them are simple and schematic in appearance, consisting of two lines of writing separated by two straight parallel lines. In rare instances, one (B 37) or three (B 5) lines separate the two registers. The impressions usually have an elliptical frame of single or double lines. Twenty-eight bullae, almost two-thirds of the assemblage, correspond to this simple formula. When ornamentation does occur, it performs one of two functions: to add variety to the lines between the registers or to fill an empty space. The most common motif used on the dividing lines was the stylized plant, appearing as a round flower between two small leaves. Variations of this motif appear on nine bullae (e.g. B 15, B 18). Another plant motif is the bud, which is used on B 36 and B 40. Also occurring occasionally are a net pattern (B 13) and simple geometric designs (B 20, 26, 44, 45). All of these motifs are common on seals and bullae. Various designs were used as space fillers: dot or round knob, schematically drawn star and branch (B 2, 6, 11, 12, 19, 39). In B 7, a dot separates the words in the lower line. Similar decorative motifs adorn other bullae and seals (e.g. Avigad 1969: 3, No. 6; 1986: 38, 68, 76, 84, Nos. 20, 87, 105, 126; Hestrin and Dayagi 1979: 82, 101, Nos. 58, 77). The main features of the ornamentation on the bullae from the City of David presented here are simplicity and functionality. All are geometric or plant motifs. Figurative art is strikingly rare on Judean seals dating from the 7th and early 6th centuries BCE (Naveh 1982: 71; Avigad 1986: 118- 19; Shiloh 1986a: 27-28). In the City of David and throughout Judah, the ban on graven images was generally observed. This, however, was not an ironclad rule: bullae bearing figurative decoration were found together with the bullae described here (Brandl, this volume, Chapter IV). Fig. 2.

They are included among the group of 53 bullae found in L. 967, Stratum 10B in Area G in the City of David excavations. These bullae have been named here after their motifs, since each of them has a different decoration. The original bulla numbers given by Shiloh (e.g. No. 15 for the Bird Bulla) were revised by Shoham (1994: 57, n. 2). The inscribed bullae were numbered B 1^45, and we have therefore numbered the figurative bullae B 46-49. During the study of these objects, some new aspects of the method of manufacture of bullae were discerned. Since these derive from observations made on all four bullae, a detailed explanation is given in the "Discussion" section. The bullae exhibit features that point to the shapes of the seals that stamped them, assisting in the determination of their origins. An attempt has been made to list all excavated parallels of the seals as a basis for future studies. Parallels from collections have been used only when they are essential to the discussion. The directions given in the descriptions of these finds refer to the impressions; obviously, they were the opposite on the seals used to impress the bullae. The arrows in the illustrations indicate the direction of the pressure used to form the bullae. The archaeological context of these bullae should not be considered a chronological criterion, since the date of the destruction serves only as a terminus ad quem. DESCRIPTION B 46. The Bird Bulla. Reg. No. 11614, Shiloh bulla No. 15. Figs. 4-7. Material : Light brown clay. Dimensions'. Bulla: L 14.5 mm, W 12.5 mm, T 5.5- 4 mm. Impression: L 9 mm, W 8 mm. Method of manufacture (Figs. 6-7): A strap of clay was attached to a rolled papyrus, and to the string that encircled it five times, near the knot. The knot's loops were attached to the temporary external face of the clay strap. Half of the clay strap was folded over the loops, which formed four closely spaced strings. The whole lump of clay was then pressed from the sides by one or two fingers and shaped into a truncated cone. Finally, the bulla's face was impressed by a seal in the direction of the strings. In this case the bulla was pressed even after the making of the impression, causing damage to the upper and right edges of the impression. Workmanship : Bulla: mediocre. Impression: excellent. Seal: excellent. Technical details (Fig. 4): Fingerprints and seal impression on the face. Impressions of papyrus and five strings on the back, with negatives left by four strings on the left edge. Four string holes in the center of the left long side. Fingerprints on all other sides, some made after the act of impression. Preservation : Complete. 58</page><page sequence="66">Fig. 4. B 46: the Bird Bulla. Seal impression (Figs. 4-5): A standing bird, probably a dove, looking to the left, with its wings raised. The rest of the space is filled by two different-sized plants. The larger plant starts in front of the dove's legs and rises in a concave shape Fig. 5. Reconstructions of the scaraboid that stamped B 46. that follows the bird's profile. The small plant is located behind the dove's legs and below its tail. The style is completely naturalistic. The scene apparently had no border line. The fine lines of the feathers point to the possibility that the seal was made of bone. Iconography : The dove is, in general, the attribute of mother and love goddesses in the ancient Near East (Winter 1977; Ziffer 1998: 37*-52*). Seal shape (Fig. 5): From the shape of the frame of the seal impression, consisting of four convex edges, it seems that the seal was a scaraboid. Typology : There are no exact parallels to this impression or the seal that stamped it, but it is clear from its suggested material that it belongs to a well-known Judean group of scaraboids made of bone. The dove appears in Judah as a central motif on a scarab, on a jar-handle impression and on a scaraboid. The scarab was found in Tomb 106 at 59</page><page sequence="67">Fig. 6. Suggested steps of the process of making B 46. 60</page><page sequence="68">Fig. 7. Suggested steps in section of the process of making B 46. Lachish (Murray 1953: 369, PL 43 [No. 58] = Keel 1992: 146-47, 155, 160, 111. 114 = Keel and Uehlinger 1992: 369-71, 111. 319; 1998: 323-24, 111. 319). It is made of paste and its dove is more schematic than our example. The jar-handle impression is in a private collection (Avigad 1981: 304-305, 85* [No. 3] = Sass 1993: 218-19, Fig. 101 = Avigad and Sass 1997: No. 693). 1 The scaraboid was purchased in Jerusalem (Keel-Leu 1991: No. 137 = Keel 1992: 146-47, 160, 111. 113). On the basis of the two latter items, though they derive from illicit excavations, it seems that the motif of the dove was common in Judah as early as the end of the 8th century BCE. Date : The seal that sealed B 46 should be dated to the 7th century BCE on the basis of the excavated parallel (the scarab from Lachish).2 Previous publications : Shiloh 1984: 19; 1985: 78, PL 18:4-5 [bulla No. 15]; 1986a: 27, PL 7:A-B [bulla No. 15]; 1986b: [6], 7:4^5 [bulla No. 15]; Shiloh and Tarier 1986: 202, including two photographs; Shoham 1994: 60; two photographs and description, 61; Avigad and Sass 1997: 167. B 47. The Sphinx Bulla. Reg. No. 11688, Shiloh bulla No. 47. Figs. 8-9. Material : Dark brown clay. Dimensions'. Bulla: L 16 mm, W 12.5 mm, T 7.5- 4 mm. Impression: L 12 mm, W 9.5 mm. Method of manufacture (Figs. 6-7, 9): A strap of clay was attached to a rolled papyrus, and to the string that encircled it only once, near the knot and to one of the string ends. The knot's loops were attached to the temporary external face of the clay strap. Half of the clay strap was folded over the loops, which formed four closely spaced strings. The whole lump of clay was then pressed from its sides by one or two fingers and shaped into a truncated cone. Finally, the bulla's face was impressed by a seal in a perpendicular direction to the string. Workmanship : Bulla: good. Impression: mediocre. Seal: good. Technical details (Fig. 8): Fingerprints and seal impression on the face. Impressions of papyrus, a string and a string end on the back. Negatives left by four strings in the center of one of the long sides, and at the base of the other. Preservation: Complete. Seal impression (Fig. 8): In a horizontal frame with four convex edges are depicted two creatures. On the left is a seated bearded winged sphinx facing right. It wears the Red Crown and a kilt on the front legs.3 The wings are bent backwards.4 On the right is a beetle. No identification was initially proposed for the decorative components of this bulla (Shiloh 1984: 19). The left-hand creature was later identified as a griffin (?) (Shiloh 1985: 80; 1986a: 27; 1986b: 6; Shiloh and Tarier 1986: 202). Iconography : The sphinx was a popular symbol in the ancient world and appears in the art and glyptics of many cultures (Dessenne 1957). In Egypt it represented Harmakhis or "Horus on the Horizon" (Ions 1968: 70-71). The Egyptian Pharaoh is frequently shown as the victorious sphinx trampling 61</page><page sequence="69">Fig. 8. B 47: the Sphinx Bulla. 62</page><page sequence="70">Fig. 9. Reconstruction of the scaraboid that stamped B 47 and the way in which the bulla was attached to the papyrus. on his foes (Lurker 1982: 114-16). The Pharaoh wears one of his crowns and the false beard. Some- times the lion's forelegs are clothed in a kilt and he is winged, as on B 47. The winged sphinx is quite rare in Northwest Semitic glyptics (Sass 1993: 226). Seal shape (Figs. 8-9): From the shape of the frame of the seal impression, consisting of four convex edges, it seems that the seal was a scaraboid. Typology : The seal from which our impression was made belongs to the category of "scarabs bearing names and figures of gods" (Newberry 1906: PI. 41). The closest parallel is a scarab with a falcon (Horus) and a beetle (Kheper) found at Tell Abu Saļima/ Sheikh Zuweid (Petrie and Ellis 1937: PL 6:42). 5 On the basis of that scarab, the scaraboid that stamped B 47 should be considered as Egyptian, or alternatively as a Philistine seal displaying Egyptian influence. Date : The seal that sealed B 47 should be dated to the 8th-7th centuries BCE on the basis of the date of the above-mentioned typological parallel.

B 48. The Bulla of the Symbol of the God Sin. Reg. No. 11668, Shiloh bulla No. 43. Figs. 10-11. Material : Light brown clay. Dimensions'. Bulla: L 17 mm, W 15.5 mm, T 5- 2.5 mm. Impression: L 14+ mm, W 11+ mm. Method of manufacture (Figs. 6-7): A strap of clay was attached to a rolled papyrus and to the string that tied it, near the knot. The knot's loops were attached to the temporary external face of the clay strap. Half of the clay strap was folded over the loops, which formed four closely spaced strings. The whole lump of clay was then pressed from the sides by one or two fingers and shaped into a truncated cone. Finally, the bulla's face was impressed by part of a seal in the direction of the strings. Workmanship : Bulla: mediocre. Impression: good. Seal: excellent. Technical details (Fig. 10): Fingerprints and seal impression on the face. Impressions of papyrus and one string on the back. A knot impression on one of the sides. Negatives left by four strings running through the width. Preservation : Complete, though the impression shows only part of the motif. Seal impression (Figs. 10-11): The impression shows only part of the seal's face, and there is no sign of a frame. It contains one symbol: in the upper part is a double crescent lying on a column decorated with diagonal lines. Instead of the usual single tassels hanging diagonally on both sides of the column, here they are depicted as right-angled triangles with their hypotenuses attached to the column. Their longer perpendicular sides, turning down, are decorated with seven fringes each. 63</page><page sequence="71">Fig. 10. B 48: the Bulla of the Symbol of the God Sin. Iconography : Despite its uncommon shape, it seems that the motif depicted on B 48 is the upper part of the symbol of the moon-god Sin from Harran (Spycket 1973; 1974; Keel 1977: 284-303; Weippert 1978; Beck 1986; Keel and Uehlinger 1992: 335-61; 1998: 294-3 16).6 This shape of the "clothed crescent standard" was apparently taken for the moon-god himself (Wiseman 1959: 42 and No. 95; Collon 1987: 82-83, No. 377). Some additional seals and other objects with this variant are known: a bronze medallion from Sendschirli in northern Syria (von Luschan and Andrae 1943: 98, Pis. 44:f, 46:f = Merhav 1991: 175, Fig. 14 = Bernett and Keel 1998: 114, 111. 38); a faience scarab from Nimrud (Parker 1955: 107, PL 18:1 [ND 858] = Spycket 1973: 385, Fig. 7, 390 = Herbordt 1992: 197 [mentioned in her Nimrud 100]); and a black limestone rectangular seal from Nimrud (Parker 1955: 108, PL 18:5 [ND 772] = Spycket 1973: 385, Fig. 8, 390-91 = Herbordt 1992: 197 [mentioned in her Nimrud 100]). Our reconstruction of the missing lower part of the symbol (Fig. 11) is based on the first and second of these parallels. Seal shape (Fig. 11): From the asymmetrical concavity of the stamped area it seems that the bulla was impressed by one of the two decorated sides (rather than the decorated base) of a conical seal with an elliptical or rounded horizontal section.7 Typology : The conical seal from which our impression was made seems to be analogous to the one found at Tell Keisan (Keel 1977: 287-88, 111. 211; 1980: 279-81, Pis. 89, 136 [No. 24] = 1990: 238-42, PL 9 [No. 24]), and as such should be considered a Neo-Assyrian product. Moreover, the designs of both seals are linear and seem to belong 64</page><page sequence="72">Fig. 11. Reconstructions of the conical seal that stamped B 48. to Edith Porada's "Neo-Assyrian Linear-Style Stamp Seals" (Porada 1948: 96-98, Pl. 120 [No. 789]). 8 Both the seal from Tell Keisan and the seal from the collection of the Pierpont Morgan Library are made of serpentine.9 There seems to be a correspondence between the carving style and material of these seals. If this observation is correct, we may suggest that the conical seal that stamped B 48 was also made of black or brown serpentine. Date : On the basis of the parallels mentioned above, the seal that stamped B 48 was manufactured in the late 8th or more probably during the 7th century BCE.

B 49. The Grazing Doe Bulla. Reg. No. 11666, Shiloh bulla No. 41. Figs. 12-15. Material : Light brown clay with stone grits. Dimensions'. Bulla: L 8+ mm, W 10+ mm, T 5- 3 mm. Impression: L 7.5+ mm, W 9+ mm. Method of manufacture : Since the bulla was found in such a fragmentary condition, we may demonstrate that it was made in the same way as the other three bullae only by showing its sections (Fig. 14). These prove that the bulla was made from a folded clay strap. From its back (Fig. 12) it is clear that the bulla was impressed perpendicular to the string(s) (see reconstruction in Fig. 13). Workmanship : Bulla: excellent. Impression: excellent. Seal: excellent. Technical details : From the impression it is obvious that the decoration of the seal was made by both incision and drilling. 65</page><page sequence="73">Fig. 12. B 49: the Grazing Doe Bulla. Preservation : Fragmentary: only the upper part has survived, with a missing portion on the right (Figs. 12-13). Seal impression (Figs. 12-13): From the surviving fragment of the impression a number of the features of its seal may be deduced. The seal's base had a vertical oval frame. The seal was divided into horizontal registers that were marked by a double line. The upper register was filled exclusively by a decorative motif. The lower part of the seal was most probably occupied by an inscription. From the curve of the frame it is clear that the lower part of the seal was of the same height as its upper part. As a result of the previous observation, it seems likely that the lower part of the seal had two rows of letters, with an additional double border line in between. The motif was originally identified, on the basis of its linear appearance, as "a balance" (Shiloh Fig. 13. Suggested reconstruction of B 49. 1984: 19), "a pair of scales" (Shiloh 1985: 80; 1986a: 27; 1986b: 6), or "weight scales" (Shiloh and Tarier 1986: 202). However, this suggestion should be rejected on the basis of the following considerations. A second weight scale would protrude from the projected line of the frame on the right. The distance between the central "string" and those on its sides is unequal. The left side of the existing "scale" extends beyond the left "string." The left "string" does not reach the "scale." The left "string" has two short horizontal strokes in its lower part. It seems to me that the remaining part of the motif is in fact the forepart of a grazing doe facing to the left. The left diagonal line is her neck and head, and the two horizontal strokes are her ears. It is possible that under the double border line and in the same direction of the doe's mouth is the uppermost edge of a Hebrew letter. A grazing doe appears on a scarab from an unknown source dated to the New Kingdom (Matouk 1977: 113, 387 [No. 737], and on an excavated scarab from the Protocorinthian deposit in Perachora (Payne and Dunbabin 1962: 503, Fig. 36 [No. 545]). Six or seven inscribed seals with the grazing doe are known, but unfortunately all are from illicit excavations (Avigad and Sass 1997: Nos. 144, 181, 204, 240, 263, 301 and 346). In addition, three bullae impressed by seals belonging to the same type, also from illicit excavations, have been published (Avigad 1986: Nos. 125, 169 = Keel and Uehlinger 1992: 210, Ills. 200c-d = Avigad and Sass 1997: Nos. 578, 649 = Keel and Uehlinger 1998: 185-86, Ills. 200c-d; Avigad and Sass 1997: No. 606). 66</page><page sequence="74">Fig. 14. Reconstruction of the face of the seal that stamped B 49. Shoham's statement (1994: 61) that "... not one of the inscribed bullae has human or animal figures" should now be revised. That statement misled Sass (1998: 9, n. 5), who was earlier aware of the combination of decoration and inscription in this bulla (Sass 1993: 224, n. 70). Fig. 15. Suggested reconstruction of the seal that stamped B 49 as a biconvex scaraboid. Iconography : According to Keel, the grazing deer, especially when depicted as lapping (water), symbolizes the longing of the believer's soul for his god (Keel 1978: 322, Fig. 433; Keel and Uehlinger 1992: 210, Ills. 200a-d; Uehlinger 1993: 274-75; Keel and Uehlinger 1998: 185-86, Ills. 200a- d). Seal shape (Figs. 14-15): From the concavity of the stamped area, it is clear that the seal was a biconvex scaraboid, since the usual pattern comprises a convex back and a flat decorated or inscribed base.10 Typology : The seal from which the impression was made clearly belongs to the Judean glyptic repertoire. Date : The paléographie dates given to the parallels range between the 8th and 7th centuries BCE. However, on the basis of the schematic appearance of the doe, a date in the 7th century BCE for the seal's manufacture seems more likely. Previous publications'.

The clays: The bullae (except for B 47) are made of unlevigated clays that seem to be local and are sometimes mixed with limestone grits. Where grits have fallen out, their existence can be deduced by cavities left in the bullae. The same was observed both for the inscribed bullae from the City of David and for the bullae found in the juglet at Lachish.11 2. The use of anepigraphic seals for stamping bullae: The bullae from the City of David were stamped by both epigraphic and anepigraphic seals.12 3. The origins of the seals: The four bullae with figurative decoration, unlike the 45 inscribed bullae, show that the origin of those who stamped them is not homogeneous. Two of the bullae (B 46 and B 49) were stamped by seals that originated in Judah. B 47 was stamped by a seal that originated in Egypt or the Philistine coast. B 48 was stamped by a seal that originated in the Neo-Assyrian Empire; it may perhaps have belonged to an Aramean who served in the Assyrian administration.13 4. The technique used for the attachment of the bullae to their papyri: The bullae were secured from detachment from their papyri by a technical innovation that differs from the older system of attaching them directly to the string's knot.14 In our bullae the knot is not discernible in the center of the back, and the clay was apparently attached on the string beside the knot. Moreover, in addition to the string impressions on their backs, the bullae display negatives left by strings on two opposing sides (as on B 48, Fig. 10) or on one side and the edge of the back (as on B 46 and B 47, Figs. 4, 9). 15 While the number of the string impressions on the back varies from one (B 47-48, Figs. 8, 10) to five (B 46, Fig. 4), the number of holes left by strings is a constant four. This phenomenon can be explained only by relating the holes to the two loops of the knot made during the tying of the papyrus (Fig. 6, 9). The process of the securing of the knot's loops has been described in detail above (Figs. 6-7). It should be emphasized that this reconstruction of the folding over of half of the clay strap is confirmed by the sections shown for the fragmentary B 49 (Fig. 14). It is possible that the biblical quotation at the head of this chapter, taken from the book of Job, refers to such a technique rather than the traditional explanations given to it (e.g. Dhorme 1923). This technique was subsequently observed on the other bullae from the City of David excavations16 as well as on those found in a juglet at Lachish.17 Two isolated finds exhibited in the Rockefeller Museum show the same technique: the bulla "Belonging to Ge'alyahu son of the king" from Beth Zur and the bulla "Belonging to Hilqiyahu son of m's " from Lachish (Avigad and Sass 1997: 174 [No. 412], 199 [No. 498] respectively, with previous bibliographies). During the Persian period this technique was adopted in a vast area (for an example at Elephantine, see Driver 1954: PI. 23). Among the published material four variants could be discerned: The first variant, which follows the Iron Age tradition, is seen in the bullae from Samaria (Crowfoot 1957: 88, PI. 15 [No. 42]) and Wadi Daliyeh (Cross 1974: PI. 36:1-3 = Leith 1997: Pis. 6, 1 1 and 20 respectively). In the second variant, instead of half of the clay strap being folded in one direction, two quarters of it were folded from the ends towards the center. This technique was observed for the first time on the bullae from Carthage (Vercoutter 1952: Figs. 2-3 = Berges 1993: 247, Ills. 1-2 = 1996: 342, Ills. A-B = 1997a: 408^09, Ills. 3^ = 1997b: 14-15, 111. I).18 In the third variant the folded half strap is replaced by an additional thick clay layer designed like a gabled roof (for two stamps), as on one of the Wadi Daliyeh bullae (Cross 1974: PI. 36:4 = Leith 1997: PL 10). In the fourth variant the "gabled roof' is attached at a perpendicular angle. This was noticed by the author among the Persian period bullae from Tel Michal (Barak and Amorai-Stark 1989: 334, Fig. 28.1.6; 336-338, PL 74:3) kept in the Israel Antiquities Authority storerooms. 5. The shape of the papyri during sealing: From the shapes of the backs of all the four bullae (Figs. 44, 8-10, 14), it is clear that their papyri were rolled into scrolls without the folding that is so typical of the Persian period and later (Sachau 1911: PL 28 [Papyrus 28]; Cooney 1953: 125-26, PL 21). An alternative reconstruction is that only part of the papyrus was rolled and tied in the technique known as "double document" (Minns 1915: 22-24; Gressmann 1927: 61, PL 83 [No. 192] = Berges 68</page><page sequence="76">1993: 247, 251, Pl. 61:2; Benoit et al. 1961: 140-44, Fig. 28 bis, Pl. 41a-c [Mur 29]; Kaiser 1967: Nos. 1128, 1179; Avigad 1986: 109-11, Fig. 3; Avigad and Sass 1997: 35, Fig. 3). 6. The origin of the new attachment system: The new system of securing the bullae to their papyri seems to be of Egyptian origin,19 dated to the Saitic (or 26th) Dynasty and before the Persian conquest of Egypt (Zivie 1978). CONCLUSIONS 1 . The bullae from the City of David excavations demonstrate that not only the faces and backs of such objects should be examined;20 the other sides can also contribute valuable information. 2. If the new technique for making bullae was indeed adopted from the Egyptians, it joins other administrative techniques that the Judeans learned from the Egyptians, mainly during the 7th century BCE: writing on papyrus;21 the use of hieratic signs for numerals (Aharoni 1966; 1971; Lemaire and Vernus 1980: 342^44); standardized dome-shaped weights (Kletter 1991: 122); and the symbol for the shekel (Lemaire and Vernus 1978; Kletter 1991: 123-24). 3. The appearance of bullae stamped by seals of different origins in one "context of administrative nature" is an additional demonstration of economic activities carried out by a mixed population during the 7th century BCE in Jerusalem, as at Gezer (Giveon 1972; Becking 1983; Reich and Brandl 1985: 4M2; Beck 1986: 41). ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The late Y. Shiloh suggested that I work on the glyptic material from his excavations in the City of David. I am most grateful for this opportunity. I would also like to thank D.T. Ariel for his encouragement and comments. M. Dayagi- Mendels and S. Cohen of the Israel Museum enabled me to examine the material from the City of David and Lachish exhibited there. O. Ilan of the Rockefeller Museum enabled me to examine the material from Beth Zur and Lachish exhibited there. Most of the photographs accompanying this chapter were taken by M. Salzberger; a few faces and backs were photographed by Z. Radovan. Drawings and reconstructions were made by C. Hersch, under the author's guidance. NOTES 1. Avigad's suggested identification of the bird as a crow, in conformity with the name of the seal's owner ('Oreb), is rejected by Sass, who identifies the bird as a pigeon (Avigad and Sass 1997: No. 693). 2. The scarab was dated to "Dynasty 23-26 (?)" (Murray 1953: 369). Two periods of use were observed for the tomb: "c. 670-580 B.C." and "Fourth century A.D. intrusions" (Tufnell 1953: 179). The date of "c. 670-580 B.C." is supported by the material of the scarab, paste (or composition), which is common among the Saitic seals (compare also with Brandl 1997: 62-67, 70-71, 74-77 [Achsib Nos. 120-24, 129, 133, 143, 158, 161]). 3. Two alternative interpretations of such a dress, as a tunic or an apron (schürt), were given in descriptions of a scarab found by Petrie in Tomb 1170 at Tell el- Ajjul (respectively, Rowe 1936: 151 [No. 635]; Keel 1997: 204-205 [Tell el-cAgul, No. 305]). 4. The sphinx with wings bent backwards is quite rare on scarabs. It appears, in my opinion, on a Late Bronze Age IIB scarab from the recent excavations at Lachish (Giveon 1988: 88-89, PL 7 [No. 102]). Such wings also exist on two scarabs from the former Matouk Collection (Matouk 1977: 106, 343 [No. 506], 385 [No. 623] and Matouk 1977: 187, 403 [No. 1699], where the wings were erroneously identified as a flagellum = Wiese 1990: 25-26, Fig. 40, 165, PL 16 [No. 3271]). 5. This scarab was attributed to MV253. This is a problematic location: the top levels of Stratum M walls here are 225 and 238, while it seems that the North-East Wall of Stratum L at this location was cut down from 265 to 246 (Petrie and Ellis 1937: PL 14). In fact, this location lacks any architecture in Strata K-H and is sealed by the Stratum G structure (Petrie and Ellis 1937: Pis. 10-13). Consequently, the terminus ad quem for this scarab should be the building date of Stratum G. Reich has reconstructed this stratum as an Assyrian fortress and attributed to it elements of the fortifications from Strata F and H. He has suggested that this fortress should be identified as the "Sealed kāru of Egypt" opened by Sargon II at the end of the 8th century BCE, and found support for his suggestion in the resemblance 69</page><page sequence="77">of its temple to the Nabu Temple at Khorsabad (Reich 1981; 1984). 6. Contrary to the statement that this is "a dubious example of a lunar crescent standard" (Holloway 1995: 306), I believe that the symbol of Sin of Harran existed in several variations, including the simple crescent itself (Homès-Fredericq 1996). 7. For excavated parallels see Delaporte 1920: 74, PI. 54 [D.82 and D.86]; Jakob-Rost 1975: Nos. 192-94, 360 = 1997: Nos. 192-94, 360. 8. Another conical seal bearing the symbol of Sin on one of its sides was found at the city of Assur (Jakob- Rost 1975: No. 360 = 1997: No. 360). 9. According to Keel, the conical seal from Tell Keisan is made of "calcaire brun clair avec grains de quartz, patina très foncée" (Keel 1980: 279; 1990: 238). The seal (IAA No. 79-342) was examined by the author and seems to be made of brown serpentine. 10. For a biconvex scaraboid dated to the 7th century BCE see Avigad 1954: 147, Fig. 6, 151-52 [No. 6]. In some cases this permitted the heir of the first owner to add his name on the second convex face (Schroeder 1914: 174-76 = Avigad and Sass 1997: No. 63). 11. Several cavities could be recognized in the publica- tions of the Lachish bullae (Aharoni 1968: PI. 11 [Nos. 7, 14, 15, 16]; 1975: Pis. 20 [No. 7A], 21 [Nos. 14A, 15 A, 16A]). 12. Bullae made with anepigraphic seals or even blank bullae are known from the excavations at Lachish (Brandl 1995: 149, nn. 89-90). 13. Another bulla from Jerusalem that contains, in my view, the symbol of the god Sin and belonged to a person of the same type is Bulla No. 205 in Avigad's publication (Avigad 1986: 100), which may be compared with a faience scarab found at Nimrud (Parker 1955: 107, PI. 18:1 [ND. 858] = Spycket 1973: 385, Fig. 7, 390 = Herbordt 1992: 197 [mentioned in Nimrud 100]). 14. This technique is also shown in an Egyptian hieroglyph (Newberry 1906: 22-24, Fig. 14; Gardiner 1973: 533 [Sign-list Y 1]). 15. Some royal Assyrian seal impressions are published as having string holes (usually only one) running through the clay in addition to string marks on their undersides; however, they were attached to sacks or cloths (Millard 1965; Herbordt 1992: 58, 111. 9:2, 67; 60-61, 111. 10:4). 16. In a special visit to the Israel Museum made by the author and D.T. Ariel. 17. This was first observed on the photographs of the backs of two of the bullae found in the Lachish juglet (Aharoni 1975: Pis. 20:2B, 21:12B). The best photo- graph was published in a later catalogue (Hestrin 1973: 24-25 and photograph on p. 37 of the Hebrew section). This was later confirmed in an additional visit by the author to the Israel Museum. 18. The securing of the knot's loops was not discerned, and the suggested reconstruction shows random coiling rather than the four strings formed by the two loops. 19. This innovation is absent in Neo-Assyrian bullae that were attached to papyri and dated to the 7th century BCE, such as those found at the rab ekallťs house at Nimrud (Parker 1962: 36-37, PI. 13:2, 4-5 [ND 7049, 7037 and 7039]; Buchanan and Moorey 1988: 8, PI. 1 1 [Nos. 64-66]). 20. As recommended by Ferioli and Fiandra (1990: 221). 21. The earliest Judean papyrus that has survived was found in Wadi Murabba'at. It was initially dated to the 8th-7th centuries BCE (Benoit et al. 1961: 93-100, Pl. 28 [Mur. 17]) and subsequently to the mid-7th century BCE (Hestrin 1973: 25; photograph on p. 39 of the Hebrew section).

All the handles belonged to storage jars of the type classified at Lachish as Type 484 (Tufnell 1953: 315- 16, PL 95:484). Seven of the impressions are of the four-winged type and 39 of the two-winged type. The name hbrn is the most common and appears on 13 of the impressions; zf appears nine times, mmšt four times and śwkh only once. Most of the handles were discovered out of context in late strata. Only a few were found in assemblages dated to the Iron Age, in Strata 12-11: Stratum 12 is assigned to the reign of King Hezekiah, at the end of the 8th century BCE, and Stratum 11 is dated to the first half of the 7th century BCE (Shiloh 1984: 3). It is noteworthy that the impressions found in Stratum 12 include some of the two-winged type, lending stratigraphie support to the claim that the use of this type began during the reign of King Hezekiah (Ussishkin 1977: 54-57; Aharoni 1978: 223-24). A summary of Imlk stamp types appears in Table 1; the classification of the stamps follows that of Lemaire (1981). Incised concentric circles appear on 31 handles. The circles, which were incised with a compass after firing, are not of uniform size: the diameter of the outer one varies from 12 to 20 mm. On 11 of the handles the circles appear together with a Imlk seal impression of the two-winged type. In a number of cases the circles have damaged the Imlk impression and seem to cancel it. In two instances concentric circles appear on the same handle as a "private" seal impression. The drawings and photographs in Pis. 1-3 are at the scale of 1:1. Table 1.

They are illustrated here at the scale of 2:1. All are in the Hebrew script characteristic of the 8th century BCE and up to the end of the First Temple period. The seal is of ivory. The seal impressions were made on ceramic storage jar handles; although the handles were found broken, it is clear that they belonged to jars of the Imlk type. On two of the handles there were also incised concentric circles, a common symbol on the handles of Imlk jars. The seal and most of the seal impressions were found in fills of late periods; only one seal impression (P 3) was found in a stratigraphie context of the Iron Age in Stratum IOC, dated to the late 7th century BCE. The individuals mentioned in the seal and the seal impressions join a long list of people whose names appear at the City of David in bullae, ostraca and other inscriptions. P 1. E3/15751; L. 1924; Str. 6-5. op&gt;l7řO (Belonging) to 'Elyaqim NDD (son of) Mikha' This ivory scaraboid seal is 22 mm long, 16 mm wide and approximately 10 mm thick. A round perforation runs through its length. The seal was found in the late dumps that cover the city wall of the City of David in Area E3. On the face of the seal are two lines of writing with a single thick dividing line between them. The script is careless but legible. In the upper line can be read without difficulty 'Elyaqim, a name well known in the Bible, on seals (Diringer 1934: 247-48, No. 93; Hestrin and Dayagi- Mendels 1979: 23, 24, 41, 115, Nos. 8, 9, 26, 91) and on bullae from the City of David (Shoham, this volume, Chapter III, B 29, 30). At the beginning of the lower line the letters mem , kaf and alef can clearly be discerned. After the alef the seal is badly damaged and it is impossible to determine whether there was an additional letter. At the end of the line is some kind of a design, perhaps an ' ankh , the Egyptian symbol of life, carelessly executed like the entire seal. The 'ankh design decorates other seals that are contemporary with our seal from the City of David (Tufnell 1953: 348, No. 170, PL 45:170; Avigad 1975a: 69, No. 12; 1989: 91, No. 2). If there was another letter after the first three letters in the lower line, it was probably a lamed , giving the reading Mikha'el. However, since there is no trace of such a letter, the reading Mikha' is preferable. This name is found in the Bible and on seals (Bliss and Macalister 1902: 120-21, PL 56:26; Diringer 1934: 141, No. 22; Avigad 1975b: 101-102); it is a hypocoristicon of the more common Mikhayahu, which appears on bullae from the City of David (Shoham, this volume, Chapter III, B8, 32). 81</page><page sequence="89">P 2. Dl/12526; L. 421; Str. 7B. &gt;'ynC?] [(Belonging) to] Hushai (son of) 'Elisham[a'] This seal impression, on the handle of a storage jar, is round and approximately 14 mm in diameter. It was found in a fill of Stratum 7B, dated to the Hellenistic period. The right-hand and left-hand margins of the impression are missing. The letter lamed in the lower line is extremely tall and almost touches the letters in the upper line. The mem in the lower line is incomplete; after it was apparently another letter, probably an 'ayin, giving the reading 'Elishama'. This name is common in the Bible, on seals (Aharoni 1962: 18-19, PL 6:1; Vattioni 1969: 367-85, Nos. 59, 72, 100, 224, 244; Lemaire 1985: 31*, No. 6; Avigad 1986: 23-24, 59, 101, Nos. 4, 66, 158-60) and on bullae from the City of David (Shoham, this volume, Chapter III, B 7, 18, 26, 35). In the upper line, the letters het , shin and yod are clearly visible. It is possible that this line too lacks a final letter, a mem , enabling a restored reading of Hushim. However, it seems unlikely that this name was written in plene spelling, since on seals the spelling is usually defective. In the Bible too this name occasionally appears in defective spelling (1 Chron. 17:12). Thus the reading Hushai seems preferable to Hushim. The name Hushai is known from the Bible, for instance Hushai the Archite, the friend of King David (2 Sam. 15:32-37; 2 Chron. 27:33). This is also the name of the father of one of the officers of King Solomon (1 Kings 4:16). The meaning of the name is unclear, though some explain it as a hypocoristicon of &gt;vy&gt;nN ('Ahishai) or ('Ahushai) - names composed of the elements hn and &gt;vy (Liver 1958: 64-65). On the handle, to the right of the seal impression, are concentric circles that were incised after firing (see Shoham, this volume, Chapter V, CC 1). This symbol is common on the handles of Imlk jars and sometimes appears with "private" seal impressions (Avigad 1983: 44-45); see also P 5 below. P 3. G 11088; L. 908; Str. 10C. obvyfr] [(Belonging) to] Shallum NtnN] (son of) ['Ah]a' A seal impression on a storage jar handle, found in Area G on the floor of a building of Stratum 10C. The impression is in the form of an elongated triangle with its short base on the right and its apex on the left. Four identical impressions, made with the same seal, were previously found at other Judean sites (Ben-Dor 1947: 66-67; Kochavi 1973: 57-58; Hestrin and Dayagi-Mendels 1979: 30, No. 15). The impression from the City of David is damaged and its right-hand part is entirely missing. However, one may clearly discern the two lines of script and the vertical dot after the letter alef at the end of the lower line. From the other impressions we know that there was an identical dot at the end of the upper line too. The name Shallum is well known from the Bible and from seals and inscriptions (Torczyner 1938: 61-62; Moscati 1951: 60, 63, Nos. 27, 37; Aharoni 1981: 65, 77, No. 35.44; Avigad 1986: 77, 101-102, 109, Nos. 108, 158-161, 196; Tur-Sinai 1987: 53, 88- 89). Since the spelling is defective, one may also read Shillem, as is sometimes the case in the Bible (Gen. 46:24; Num. 26:49). The name 'Aha' appears in inscriptions from Samaria and Arad (Reisner 1924: 237, No. 51; 82</page><page sequence="90">Aharoni 1981: 80-82, 93, 97, Nos. 49, 67, 74) and on two bullae from the City of David (Shoham, this volume, Chapter III, B 34, 42). P 4. D2/20207; Surf.; Unstr. [ ]Î7 (Belonging) to [ ] in&gt;D£)3 (son of) Sephanyahu A seal impression on a storage jar handle, measuring approximately 13 x 14 mm. The upper part of the impression is missing and the personal name of the owner of the seal has not been preserved. In the center of the impression appears a winged serpent (uraeus) with four wings, an Egyptian-Phoenician motif sometimes used to decorate Hebrew seals (Diringer 1934: 208, 232, 245, Nos. 51, 72, 89, Pis. XX:21, XXI:9, XXII:2; Avigad 1969: 7, No. 16; 1986: 110, Nos. 200-201; 1989: 91, No. 2). Above this motif is the letter lamed , and after this was presumably the name of the seal's owner. In the lower line of script, below two parallel dividing lines, one may clearly read Sephanyahu, a name known from the Bible and also from bullae and seals (Diringer 1934: 198, No. 39; Aharoni 1975: 21, Nos. 6-7; Avigad 1986: 53, 99, Nos. 53-54, 155). Two similar seal impressions were found at Lachish (Diringer 1941: 54-56, Nos. 21-22; Tufnell 1953: PI. 47:8-9). For one of them (No. 21), Diringer suggested the reading iri&gt;}33 (p) "(Belonging) to Sa[m]ki (son of) Sephanyahu." It is possible that the two impressions from Lachish and that from the City of David were made with the same seal. P 5. G 4733; Surf.; Unstr. A seal impression on a storage jar handle, only part of which is visible, a small section (7x4 mm.) of the lower line of the two-line inscription. As in P 2, concentric circles are also incised on the handle (see Shoham, this volume, Chapter V, CC 2). On the preserved part three letters may be seen beneath two parallel dividing lines. The first letter is nun and the third probably alef. The second letter is badly damaged and only the long downstroke is discernible. It may be the letter resh , and if so the name may be read Nera', a hypocoristicon of the Biblical inna (Neriyahu), known from Hebrew seals and inscriptions (Pritchard 1959: 3-6, 11; Aharoni 1962: 16-17, PI. 6:2; Avigad 1983: 44-45). However, this reading is tentative. There appears to be a small space between the nun and the letter after it; it is possible that the nun is actually the second letter of the word bn , "son of," and that the letters after it are the two first letters of the name of the seal owner's father. 83</page><page sequence="91">BIBLIOGRAPHY Aharoni, Y. 1962.

Cahill INTRODUCTION Thirty-seven ceramic jar handles bearing rosette stamp seal impressions have been found at the City of David in loci ascribable to the Iron Age II and later periods.1 These 37 handles and their impres- sions are individually described within the frame- work of the following typological discussion. The description of each handle includes its typological classification, the area in which it was found, registration number, locus number, locus descrip- tion and stratigraphie designation. The state of preservation and measurements in centimeters for the rosette diameter (RD), petal length (PL), petal width (PW), diameter of the central dot (CD) and stamp diameter (SD) are noted for each impression, as are Munsell soil color chart descriptions for fabric and core, and size and color of inclusions. Identical impressions, possibly identical impres- sions, identical jars and possibly identical jars are indicated. Drawings and photographs of the im- pressions appear at the scale of 1 : 1 . TYPOLOGY Rosette impressions appearing on ceramic handles were made with stamp seals applied to the clay while it was still wet and plastic, before the vessel was fired in a kiln. Although these rosette motifs are very basic, consisting simply of a varying number of petals evenly spaced around a central dot, variant stylistic features are readily visible on most impres- sions. These features allow the rosette impressions Examples of the stylistic classes of rosette-stamped handles. 85</page><page sequence="93">to be categorized into five stylistic classes, each of which can in turn be subdivided into various types and subtypes (Cahill 1995: 231-39). Class I, Fancy Style impressions are characterized by a raised ridge framing the petals of the rosette; Class II, Plain Style impressions lack the ridged frame enclosing the petals; Class III, Crude Style impressions bear short petals that never reach the central dot; Class IV, Schematic Style impressions carry petals formed by straight lines reminiscent of the spokes in a wheel; and Class V, Intaglio Style impressions bear depressed rather than raised features (Cahill 1995: 231-39). All of the five stylistic classes of rosette motif are represented within the City of David corpus. Impressions that cannot be classified, either because they are too poorly impressed or because they have not been examined by the author, are referred to as Class VI, Undetermined Style, impressions (Cahill 1995: 240). Class I, Fancy Style Class I, Fancy Style impressions consist of circum- scribed rosettes stamped in low relief whose petals are individually fashioned of two components: an inner core forming the body of the petal and an outer frame enclosing the inner core. The inner cores consist of tear-shaped figures with sloping sides and sharp middle ridges that meet the central dot at their narrow, pointed ends. The outer frames consist of narrow ridges framing the inner core. The frames surrounding the inner parts of the petals are the most characteristic feature of the Class I impressions and four types (A-D) of Class I rosette motif are distinguishable on this basis. Three of these types (A-C) have been subtyped according to the number of petals used to form the rosette motifs (Cahill 1995: 231-34). All four types of Class I rosette motif are represented in the City of David corpus. Type A Class I, Type A impressions are characterized by petals with a shared outline which, along with the inner cores of the petals, is connected to the central dot. These impressions exhibit five subtypes with five, eight, twelve, fifteen and sixteen petals (Cahill 1995: 231). 2 The present corpus includes impres- sions with eight, twelve and sixteen petals. I.A. 8. Eight handles from the City of David (R 1-8) bear Class I, Type A impressions with eight petals and are, therefore, classified as I.A. 8 impressions. R 1.

Three handles from the City of David (R 9- 11) bear Class I, Type A impressions with twelve petals and are, therefore, classified as I.A. 12 impressions. R 9. I.A. 12 (D2/13568, L. 1863, Dumps, Str. 9 - Persian period). All twelve petals easily discernible. RD: 1.15; PL: 0.5; PW: 0.2; CD: 0.15; SD: 1.3.

I.A.12 (G 4298, L. 760, Fill, Str. 9 - Persian period). The outer edges of the petals are well stamped, but the central area of the impression is worn away. RD: 1.6; PL: 0.6-0.7; PW: 0.2; CD: ?; SD: 1.8. Reddish brown fabric (2.5YR 5/4); gray core (5YR 5/1); small to medium white and small glistening inclusions. Class I, Type A impressions with twelve petals like those from the City of David appear on at least five other handles from four sites: Jerusalem (2); Lachish (1); Ramat Rahel (1); and Socoh (l).5 I.A. 16. One handle from the City of David (R 12) bears a Class I, Type A impression with sixteen petals and is, therefore, classified as a I.A. 16 impression. R 12. I.A. 16 (G 11018, L. 804, Structural collapse, Str. 10B - Iron Age II). All sixteen petals easily discernible; outer edges of three left-hand petals worn away. RD: 1.5; PL: 0.6; PW: 0.2; CD: 0.3; SD: 1.7. Exterior fabric, light reddish brown (5YR 6/3); interior fabric, red (2.5YR 5/8); gray core, (2.5YR N5/); small to large white and small glistening inclusions. Class I, Type A impressions with sixteen petals like those from the City of David appear on at least four other handles from four sites: Arad (1); En-Gedi (1); Jerusalem (1); and Ramat Rahel (l).6 Type B Class I, Type B impressions are characterized by petals with a shared outline that end at a raised circular ridge surrounding the central dot. These impressions exhibit two subtypes: those with seven and twelve petals (Cahill 1995: 231). The present corpus includes only Class I, Type B impressions with twelve petals. LB. 12. Two handles from the City of David (R 13- 14) bear Class I Type B impressions with twelve petals and are, therefore, classified as I.B.12 impressions. 88</page><page sequence="96">89</page><page sequence="97">R 13. I.B. 12 (E3/7686, L. 1540, Wall fill, Str. 7 - Hellenistic period). All twelve petals easily discernible; outer edge of impression worn away in places. RD: 1.4; PL: 0.55; PW: 0.2; CD: 0.3; SD: 1.5. Weak red fabric (10R 5/4); gray core (7.5YR N5/); small to large white and small glistening inclusions. R 14. I.B.12 (El/9309, L. 695, Pebbles, Str. 9 - Persian period). Parts of all twelve petals discernible; part of impression stamped on double ridges of handle not well impressed. RD: 1.6; PL: 0.6; PW: 0.3-0.4; CD: 0.4; SD: 1.8. Pinkish gray fabric (7.5YR 6/2); gray core (7.5YR N5/); small to medium white, medium to large red, and small glistening inclusions. Class I, Type B impressions with twelve petals like those from the City of David appear on at least three other handles from two sites: Jerusalem's Jewish Quarter (1); and Ramat Rahel (2). 7 Type C Class I, Type C impressions are characterized by petals that are individually outlined. Both the petal cores and their frames are connected to the central dot. These impressions exhibit three subtypes: those with six, seven and eight petals (Cahill 1995: 231). The present corpus includes only a single Class I, Type C impression with six petals. 1.C. 6. The single handle from the City of David bearing a Class I, Type C impression (R 15) has a rosette motif with six petals and is, therefore, classified as a LC.6 impression. R 15. I.C. 6 (El/16365, L. 2038, context undefined, Str. 7 - Hellenistic period). Interior cores of all six petals and their decorative frames easily discernible and well-stamped; outer edges worn away. RD: 1.2; PL: 0.55; PW: 0.3; CD: 0.1; SD: 1.4. Exterior fabric, light reddish brown (5YR 6/3); interior fabric, red (2.5YR 5/8); gray core (2.5YR N5/); small to large white inclusions. At least three additional examples of I.C. 6 impressions have been found on handles from two sites: Tell el-Ful (1); and Ramat Rahel (2). 8 Type D The only example of a Class I, Type D impression comes from Area G in the City of David (R 16) and bears a rosette motif fashioned from six individually outlined petals that are separated from the central dot by a circular depression. R 16. I.D. 6 (G 4854/1, L. 792, Structural collapse to floor, Str. 10B - Iron Age II). Impression stamped at base of decanter handle; all six petals discernible; traces of double stamping. RD: 1.3; PL: 0.5; PW: 0.3; CD: 0.3; SD: 1.5. Pinkish gray fabric (7.5YR 7/2); small to large white and black inclusions. Class II, Plain Style Class II, Plain Style impressions consist of circumscribed rosettes stamped in low relief. They are designated "plain" as opposed to "fancy" because their petals lack the outer ridge found framing the inner cores of their Class I counterparts. Their petals consist of single figures varying in shape, form and compositional relation to their other features. Four types (A-D) of Class II impressions are distinguishable on the basis of these variant features (Cahill 1995: 234-36). Two of these types (A and C) have been subtyped according to the number of petals used to form the rosette motifs (Cahill 1995: 235). Two types (A and B) of Class II rosette motif are represented in the City of David corpus. Type A Class II, Type A impressions are characterized by narrow, lozenge-shaped petals with sloping sides and sharp ridges that are connected to a raised central dot. These impressions exhibit three subtypes: those with eight, ten and twelve petals (Cahill 1995: 235). The present corpus includes Class II, Type A impressions with eight and twelve petals. II.A.8. Six handles from the City of David (R 17-22) bear Class II, Type A impressions with eight petals and are, therefore, classified as II.A.8 impressions. R 17. II.A.8 (D2/14064, L. 1819, Dumps, Str. 7B - Hellenistic period). Parts of all eight petals discernible; right lower side of impression poorly stamped due to high ridge of handle.

Class II, Type A impressions with twelve petals like that from the City of David appear on at least thirteen other handles from five sites: Tel Burna (1); En-Gedi (4); Jerusalem (1); Nebi Daniel (1); and Ramat Rahel (5). 10 Another II.A.12 impression at the IAA comes from an unknown provenance.11 Type B Class II, Type B impressions bear Class II.A type rosettes inscribed within a border formed by two raised, circular ridges enclosing a series of raised dots evenly spaced around the rosette motif. All of the impressions known to belong to this category have eight-petaled rosettes (Cahill 1995: 232, 235). II.B.8. One handle from the City of David (R 24) bears a Class II, Type B impression with eight petals and is, therefore, classified as a II.B.8 impression. R 24. II.B.8 (G 4721, L. 798, Structural collapse down to floor, Str. 10B - Iron Age II).

Class II, Type B impressions with eight petals like that from the City of David appear on at least six other handles from five sites: Tel Azekah (1); Jerusalem (1); Lachish (2); M anahat (1); and Socoh (l).12 Class III, Crude Style Class III, Crude Style impressions consist of circumscribed rosettes stamped in low relief. They are designated "crude" as opposed to "fancy" or 92</page><page sequence="100">93</page><page sequence="101">"plain" because their petals are shorter than those of their Class I or Class II counterparts and end before reaching the central dot. The petals, which are either lozenge or wedge-shaped, slope down toward a central dot which lies below the petals opening around it. The entire motif is thus concave, rather than flat, in profile. Although Class III impressions exhibit three distinct types (A-C) based on the variant ways in which the petals and central dot are expressed (Cahill 1995: 237-38), only Type A is represented in the City of David corpus. Type A Class III, Type A impressions bear short, lozenge or tear-shaped petals separated from a small central dot by a broad furrow. These impressions exhibit four subtypes: those with eight, ten, twelve and sixteen petals (Cahill 1995: 232, 237). The present corpus includes Class III, Type A impressions with eight and twelve petals. III. A. 8. One handle from the City of David (R 25) bears a Class III, Type A impression with eight petals and is, therefore, classified as a III.A.8 impression. R 25.

Although Class IV impressions exhibit two types (A and B) based on the variant ways in which the central dot is expressed, only Type A is represented at the City of David (Cahill 1995: 232, 238). Type A Class IV, Type A impressions have stick-like petals that simply cross at the center of the design like spokes in a wheel. The entire motif is inscribed within a raised circular ridge executed close to the outer edge of the seal. Only two impressions of this type have been identified, each with eight petals. Although both impressions come from the City of David, only one (R 32) was found during the excavations directed by Shiloh. The other was found and published by Macalister and Duncan (1926: 190, Fig. 204 bottom row, second from left). R 32. IV.A.8 (G 1 1454, L. 950, Fill, Str. 9 - Persian period).

Class V, Intaglio Style Class V Intaglio Style rosette stamp seal impressions have rosette motifs composed of sunken rather than raised petals. The Class V impressions exhibit two distinct types (A and B), both of which are represented in the City of David corpus (Cahill 1995: 232, 239). Type A Class V, Type A impressions have wedge-shaped sunken petals surrounding a similarly sunken central dot. The petals are bordered by a ridge or raised outline which also encircles the central dot, separating it from the petals. The known examples of Class V, Type A impressions all have eight petals (Cahill 1995: 232, 239). V.A.8. Two handles from the City of David (R 33- 34) bear Class V, Type A impressions with eight petals and are, therefore, classified as V.A.8 impressions. R 33. V.A.8 (El/10311, Unstratified surface debris). All eight petals easily discernible; upper portion of impression broken away. RD: 1.4; PL: 0.4; PW: 0.3; CD: 0.3; SD: 1.6.

All eight petals easily discernible. RD: 1.5; PL: 0.3-0.5; PW: 0.3; CD: 0.4; SD: 1.7. White fabric (5YR 8/1); small to large black and small to medium white inclusions. Class V, Type A impressions with eight petals like those from the City of David appear on at least eight other handles from three, and possibly four, sites: En-Gedi (1); Jerusalem (2); Ramat Rahel (5) and possibly Tel Miqne/Ekron (l).15 Type B The only known example of a Class V, Type B impression (R 35) consists simply of six wedge- shaped sunken petals arranged with their pointed ends facing the center. It has no outer border and no central dot. R 35. V.B.6 (El/16857, L. 2078, Fill, Str. 9 - Persian period). All six petals easily discernible.

Class VI, Undetermined Style Class VI, Undetermined Style impressions are those handles with rosette stamp seal impressions that could not be classified stylistically. These handles fall into two categories: Type A handles that have been examined but on which the rosette motif is either too poorly stamped or too poorly preserved to define stylistically; and Type B handles that have not been examined and on which the published information is inadequate for stylistic classification (Cahill 1995: 240). Two VI. A impressions (R 36-37) are included in the present corpus. 96</page><page sequence="104">R 36. VI.A (D2/21055, L. 2703, Terrace fill, Str. 7B - Hellenistic period).

Two handles (R 3 and R 33), representing 5.4% of the corpus, derive from unstratified contexts. Twenty-eight handles (R 1-2, R 5-11, R 13-15, R 17, R 19-23, R 25-29, R 32, R 34- 37), representing 75.7% of the corpus, derive from fills, dumps or debris containing chronologically mixed cultural assemblages ascribed to Strata 9-5 (Persian through Early Roman periods) on the basis of the latest datable pottery and other artifacts found within them. Seven handles (R 4, R 12, R 16, R 18, R 24, R 30-31), representing 18.9% of the corpus, derive from sealed archaeological contexts yielding homogeneous assemblages of pottery and artifacts ascribable to the final phase of the Iron Age II (ca. 7th-6th centuries BCE). Six well-stratified handles (R 4, R 12, R 16, R 24, R 30-31) come from Stratum 10B in Area G, where they were found sealed in the burnt debris and structural collapse found on top of floors destroyed by the Babylonians in 587/6 BCE (Cahill 1995: 246; forthcoming a). Handle R 4 was recovered from L. 773, a massive structural collapse accumulated above Area G's "northwest corner." Handle R 12 was uncovered during the excavation of L. 804, the structural collapse found covering an exterior staircase and landing which yielded an indicative assemblage of late Iron Age II pottery. Handle R 16 derives from L. 792, the structural collapse cleared from a small cell found adjacent to storeroom L. 818 located in the three-room addition to the "House of Ahiel" (Cahill 1997: 50-51). It, too, was found together with an indicative assemblage of late Iron Age II pottery. Handle R 24 was discovered in L. 798, the debris found covering the cobble-paved, northwestern portion of the floor in the back room of the "House of Ahiel." Handles R 30 and R 31 are opposing handles of a technically complete storage jar recovered from L. 818, a storeroom located in the three-room addition to the "House of Ahiel" which yielded the crushed remains of 45 restorable ceramic vessels (Cahill 1997: 50; Shiloh 1984: PI. 30:2). The one remaining handle from a late Iron Age II context, R 18, comes from L. 1679 excavated in Area El. This locus has been defined by its excavator, A. De Groot, as an "earth layer" provisionally ascribed to Stratum 1 1 . As, however, this locus does not appear to have been sealed from above, and does not appear to have contained any chronologically indicative material other than the rosette-stamped handle, it should probably be attributed to Stratum 10 rather than Stratum 11. Each of the seven well-stratified rosette stamp seal impressions from the City of David can be dated on the basis of the accompanying pottery and artifacts to the final phase of the Iron Age II. The chronological peg to which these cultural assemblages may be linked is 587/6 BCE, the year in which the Babylonian army of Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the fortified cities of Azekah, Lachish and Jerusalem (Malamat 1968; Tadmor 1976: 157). The six stratified impressions from Area G were all found in this destruction level and the vessels on which they were stamped all went out of use in 587/6 BCE. The date at which the rosette-impressed vessels were introduced is more difficult to determine, for the development of ceramic typology from the early to mid-7th century BCE is not well known due, primarily, to the fact that no Judean site has produced a ceramic assemblage securely dated to the period between the Assyrian conquest of the late 8th century BCE and the Babylonian conquest of the early 6th century BCE (Zimhoni 1990: 3-52). The City of David excavations have, however, largely filled this gap by producing two ceramic assemblages which illustrate and define the cultural horizon of the early to mid-7th century BCE. These assemblages belong to Stratum 1 1 in Areas B, D2, El and E3 (Shiloh 1984: 3-4) and to Stratum 10C in Area G.16 Each of these assemblages has been found in good stratigraphie context, above the 8th century BCE assemblages of Stratum 12 and below the 587/6 BCE destruction levels of Stratum 10B in Area G and Stratum 10 in the other areas. Although one of the 37 rosette stamp seal impressions found during these excavations (R 18) comes from a locus (1679) in Area E ascribed to Stratum 11, the amorphous designation of the locus as an "earth layer," coupled with its lack of pottery or other artifacts characteristic of the mid-7th century BCE, argue against its ascription to Stratum 11 rather than Stratum 10. Thus these two strata, Stratum 11 in Area E and Stratum 10C in Area G, appear to provide an upper stratigraphie limit for the appearance of the rosette-impressed vessels. 98</page><page sequence="106">Well-stratified rosette impressions from other sites also derive exclusively from destruction levels marking the end of the Iron Age II (Cahill 1995: 244-A6). In addition to those from the City of David, 26 rosette-impressed handles have been found in well-stratified contexts at the following seven sites (Cahill 1995: 245-46): six from Tel Batash; two from Tell el-Ful; three from En-Gedi; four from Tel Ira; four from Lachish; one from Tel Malhata; and six from Ramat Rahel. Analysis of the stratigraphie settings of these rosette impressions suggests that they were introduced during the reign of Jehoiakim and that, although closely contemporary, the various classes of rosette motif were chronologically distinct (Cahill 1995: 247-50). TECHNICAL DATA Seals Rosette impressions appearing on ceramic handles were made with stamp seals applied to the clay while wet and plastic before firing in a kiln. Although close to 250 rosette-impressed handles are known, none of the seals used to stamp them has yet been recovered.17 The impressions themselves thus comprise the only data available for the study of the seals from which they were made. Comparison of the measurements of the diameter of the rosette motif, the petal length, the petal width, the diameter of the central dot and the diameter of the stamp appearing on each handle from the City of David indicate that the 37 impressions comprising this corpus were stamped with 32 different stamp seals. Vessel Types All but one of the rosette impressions from the City of David appear on the upper portions of double- ridged handles from large, ovoid storage jars.18 Although the fabric of the rosette-stamped handles varies slightly in color as a result of the atmospheric conditions in which they were fired, the fabric of the handles bearing Class I-IV impressions closely resembles that of handles bearing Imlk impressions. Twelve handles bearing Class I-IV impressions from the City of David (R 2, R 5, R 10, R 12, R 15, R 19- 20, R 27, R 29-32) are identical in fabric to handles bearing Imlk impressions and exhibit a three-color scheme consisting of a gray core, a central zone surrounding the core that varies in color from light red to reddish brown, and a dark exterior of various shades of gray and brown. The remaining Class I-IV impressions exhibit a two-color scheme con- sisting of a gray core and an exterior varying from weak red to pinkish gray to reddish brown. The fabric of the Class V, Intaglio Style impressions is either white or light pink in color. Various quantities of small, medium and large white, black, red and/or glistening inclusions are present in each handle. All of the storage jar handles bearing Class I-IV impressions derive from a type of jar that the excavators of Lachish classed as Type 483 (Tufnell 1953: PL 95) or SJ 190 (Aharoni 1975: 18, PL 54). Type 483 (or SJ 190) is a taller, narrower derivative of the Imlk jars classed as Type 484 (Tufnell 1953: PL 95) or SJ 180 (Aharoni 1975: PL 54) which, like the Imlk jars, has four loop handles placed close to the center of the vessel's body. Impressions R 30-31 appear on opposing handles of a technically complete jar recovered from storeroom L. 818 appended to the "House of Ahiel" (Shiloh 1984: Fig. 25). Five other morphologically similar, complete or nearly complete storage jars with rosette-stamped handles have been found in contexts ascribable to the final phase of the Iron Age II at the following three sites: one at Tel Malhata (Kochavi 1970: 24; 1993: 936); one at Lachish (Aharoni 1975: 18, PL 49: 15); and three at Tel Ira (Cahill forthcoming c). Only the City of David jar has been measured for liquid capacity; it was found to hold 36.8 liters. Although the capacities of the other jars are not yet known, 15 jars of the same type but lacking rosette- stamped handles that were found together with the measured jar range in capacity from 31.7 to 42.0 liters (Cahill forthcoming a).19 The 36 storage jar handles from the City of David appear to have come from 32 ovoid storage jars similar to the complete ones found at the sites listed above. In addition to the pair of handles belonging to the restorable jar from storeroom L. 818, three pairs of handles fashioned from similar- looking fabric and stamped with the same seals may cautiously be identified as having come from three rather than six different jars. These are handles R 7- 8 from Area G, R 17-18 from Areas D2 and El, and R 26 and R 28 from Areas El and E3. Handle R 7 comes from L. 778, a soil fill attributed to Stratum 9 excavated in Square D3. Handle R 8 comes from L. 99</page><page sequence="107">R 30 and 31 100</page><page sequence="108">718, an identical soil fill excavated in the adjacent Square D4 and also attributed to Stratum 9 (Cahill forthcoming a). Handles R 17-18, R 26 and R 28 derive from loci excavated in different (but adjacent) areas and attributed to different strata; however, the identical impressions and similarities of ware exhibited by them strongly suggest that each pair of handles originated from a single storage jar.20 The only rosette impression not occurring on a storage jar is R 16, which was stamped at the base of a double-ridged handle belonging to a large decanter. The fabric from which the decanter was fashioned is pinkish gray in color and contains many small, medium and large white and black inclusions. Like the storage jars bearing rosette impressions, this decanter is a vessel type known from late Iron Age II levels at many Judean sites: Lachish, Stratum II (Tufnell 1953: PL 87, 264; Aharoni 1975: Pis. 49: 5; 50: 4, 14, 55, decanter 30); En-Gedi, Stratum V (Mazar et al. 1966: Fig. 20: 1- 3); Arad, Stratum VI (Herzog et al. 1984: 28, Fig. 29:8). Another decanter bearing a rosette seal impression was recently discovered during excavations conducted in the Jerusalem suburb of Motzah (A. De Groot, oral communication). DISTRIBUTION In addition to the 37 impressions reported here from Shiloh's excavations, at least 49 rosette-stamped handles are known from earlier excavations in the City of David and other sites in Jerusalem. These include six found in the City of David by Macalister and Duncan;21 seven from the Armenian Garden;22 three from excavations conducted by M. Broshi outside the western wall of the Old City;23 two from salvage excavations conducted by A. Maeir west of the Jaffa Gate in the Mamilla neighborhood;24 four from excavations conducted by M. Broshi at the House of Caiaphas;25 six from excavations in the Jewish Quarter (Cahill forthcoming d); three from B. Mazar's excavations outside the Temple Mount (Nadelman 1989: 140, Nos. 170-72); one from excavations beneath the Church of the Redeemer in the Christian Quarter (Lux 1972: 191); one from Jason's Tomb (Rahmani 1967: 65, Fig. 2); one from a tomb excavated by L.Y. Rahmani on Shmuel Hanavi Street;26 and at least 13 from unspecified areas excavated by K.M. Kenyon.27 In addition, two rosette-stamped handles housed in the Spaer Collection are said to have been found in Jerusalem (Barkay 1985: 23/384 and 23/385). Outside Jerusalem, ceramic handles bearing rosette stamp seal impressions have been found at 25 different sites (Fig. 16): Arad; Tel Azekah; Tel Batash; Tell el-Beidha; Beth-Zur; Tel Burna; Tell el- Ful; En-Gedi; Er-Ras; Tel Erani; Gezer; Gibeon; Tel Ira; Manahat; Tel Miqne; Motzah; Lachish; Tel Malhata; Ramat Beth Shemesh, site No. 94/21; Tell en-Nasbeh; Nebi Daniel; Ramat Rahel; Tell es-Safi; Socoh; and an unnamed farmstead located in the Shephelah, site 15-12/02/5 (Cahill 1995: 24445).28 101</page><page sequence="109">Fig 16. Distribution of rosette stamp seal impressions. PROVENANCE Handle R 8 from the City of David was included in the corpus of "material connected with the royal jars" that Mommsen et al. (1984) subjected to instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) together with 120 samples from Imlk stamped jars. Mommsen and his colleagues concluded that handle R 8, together with another rosette-stamped handle from Tel Batash and all but two of the Imlk handles tested, "showed a degree of homogeneity of compo- sition which is normally associated with pottery made at a single place" (Mommsen et al. 1984: 1 12). Although the authors of the Imlk study were unable to identify the site at which these vessels had been produced, they concluded that the site was located somewhere in the Judean Shephelah (Mommsen et al. 1984: 112). 29 Preliminary results of the INAA recently performed on an additional 89 rosette- stamped handles corroborate this conclusion (Cahill and Yellin 1998). 102</page><page sequence="110">SYMBOLIC SIGNIFICANCE The rosette motif was employed as a royal insignia by members of the ruling houses of the ancient Near East from at least as early as the time of the Hittite empire in Asia Minor; from there it passed to the Neo-Hittite kingdoms in northern Syria, the Assyr- ian empire, the Transjordanian kingdom of Ammon and, eventually, to Judah (Cahill 1995: 250-52; 1997). The chronological proximity of the Judean rosette-stamped handles to the period of the Assyrian empire suggests that the Judean adapta- tion of the rosette motif is attributable to Assyrian influence. Moreover, the archaeological contexts in which the well-stratified impressions are found indicate that the Judean monarchs employed the rosette motif as their own royal emblem only after the resurgence of Judean independence following the end of the Assyrian period. The rosette motif appears to have represented the ideal expression of kingship to the Judean rulers for two reasons. First, as a result of its popularity in Assyrian iconogra- phy, the significance of the rosette motif as a royal symbol was well known and needed no written explanation. Second, in iconographie terms, the rosette motif was simply an artistic variation of an earlier emblem used by the Judean monarchy: the winged disc. Its appearance in Judah at the end of the Iron Age represents, therefore, a good example of both the Assyrian impact on Judean culture and the continuity of Judean culture from the 8th to the 6th centuries BCE (Cahill 1995: 250-52; 1997). SUMMARY Thirty-seven ceramic jar handles bearing rosette stamp seal impressions have been found in four areas of excavation at the City of David. Although the rosette motifs appearing on these and other handles like them are very basic, consisting simply of a varying number of petals evenly spaced around a central dot, variant stylistic features allow them to be categorized into five stylistic classes, which can in turn be subdivided into 15 different types and 30 subtypes. Each of the five stylistic classes, as well as nine different types and 14 subtypes, are represented within the City of David corpus. Comparison of the measurements exhibited by their individual features indicates that the 37 impressions comprising this corpus were stamped with 32 different seals. Six of the City of David impressions were recovered from destruction debris and structural collapse accumu- lated on top of floors and buildings destroyed by the Babylonians in 587/6 BCE. Another was found in an "earth layer" provisionally ascribed to Stratum 11, though this author believes that it should be reassigned to Stratum 10, the occupational phase that immediately preceded the Babylonian destruc- tion. Twenty-eight impressions were found in fills, dumps and debris ascribed variously to the Persian, Hellenistic or Early Roman periods on the basis of the latest datable material recovered from them. Two others derive from unstratified surface debris. All but one of the impressions in this corpus appear on the upper portions of double-ridged handles deriving from large, ovoid storage jars identified as taller, narrower derivatives of the Imlk jars. The 36 storage jar handles from the City of David appear to represent 32 individual jars. The only rosette impression not appearing on a storage jar handle appears at the base of a handle belonging to a large decanter. The rosette motif enjoyed a long history in the realm of ancient Near Eastern art, where it became a popular manifestation of divine kingship. The royal significance of the rosette motif indicates that the vessels on which they appear were manufactured under royal sponsorship and intended for official use. The stratigraphie analysis of the well-stratified impressions from the City of David and elsewhere leads to the conclusion that the rosette-impressed vessels date to the very last phase of the Iron Age II. They appear to have been introduced during the reign of Jehoiakim, possibly in response to the threat of Babylonian invasion that followed Egypt's defeat at the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BCE (Cahill 1995: 247-50). 103</page><page sequence="111">NOTES 1. The present study would not have been possible without the help and cooperation of many others, to all of whom the author owes a great debt of gratitude. S. Eisenstein made the line drawings of the impressions and the handles on which they appear; S. Avriel, S. Krapiwko and W. Schleicher each prepared earlier versions of the distribution map; Z. Radovan and I. Sztulman photographed the handles and their impressions and M. Cohen printed them for publication. D.T. Ariel incorporated the handles bearing rosette stamp seal impressions into the concordance of finds accompanying this volume. The following area supervisors provided the locus descriptions and stratigraphie attributions for the impressions found in their areas: the late Y. Shoham, Area D2; A. De Groot, Area El; E. Mazar, Area E3; J.M. Cahill and D. Tarler, Area G. Finally, the comparative analysis of these impressions would not have been possible without the help and cooperation of the many excavators, surveyors and curators responsible for the rosette-impressed handles from other sites. The author expresses her gratitude to the following individuals for allowing her to study and refer to the material in their care: M. Aharoni, Z. Herzog and L. Singer-Avitz (Arad); H.

In addition to the four subtypes with five, eight, twelve and sixteen petals discussed in Cahill 1995, a subtype with fifteen petals was recently discovered at Ramat Beth Shemesh in the excavations conducted by I. Milevski under the direction of Y. Dagan (Cahill forthcoming f). 3. One of the two handles from Arad is at the IAA (No. 64-319); the other is being prepared for publication by M. Aharoni (Reg. No. 10018). The two handles from Tel Azekah appear in Bliss and Macalister 1902 (PI. 56:36z, 38z). The six handles from Tel Batash have been prepared for publication by the author (Cahill forthcoming b). The single handle from Beth- Zur appears in Sellers 1933 (Fig. 44:4) and is held by the IAA at the Rockefeller Museum (No. PAM 31- 28).

The handle from Gibeon appears in Pritchard 1961 (Fig. 46:77). One of the five additional handles from Jerusalem comes from B. Mazar's excavations south of the Temple Mount (Nadelman 1989: 132, 134, 140, No. 171). Two were found in the Armenian Garden: one during excavations directed by K.M. Kenyon (Tushingham 1985: 23, 361, Fig. 9:40) which is now at the IAA (No. 68-1214) and one during excavations directed by M. Broshi (Reg. No. 1048/1). One was discovered in the Jewish Quarter in Area R (Cahill forthcoming d). One was found in the Mamilla neighborhood during salvage excavations conducted by A. Maeir (Reg. No. 4006). Of the four handles from Ramat Rahel, one was published by Aharoni (1964: PI. 41:9); this handle, as well as another I.A. 8 handle from Ramat Rahel, is now part of the study collection of the HU (Nos. 8542/9 and 7428). Two other I.A. 8 handles from Ramat Rahel are at the IAA (Nos. 54-362 and 64-1739). The handle from Tell es-Safi was discovered during excavations directed by A. Maeir and A. Boas. The handle from the farmstead in the Shephelah was discovered during a survey conducted by Y. Dagan. 4. The two handles of unknown provenance are held by the IAA at the Rockefeller Museum (Nos. PAM 547, 45-259). 5. One of the I.A. 12 handles from Jerusalem was found in the Jewish Quarter in Area T2 (Cahill forthcoming d). The other one was found in a tomb ascribed to the Second Temple period excavated by L.Y. Rahmani on Shmuel Hanavi Street; it is currently at the IAA (No. 61-769). The handle from Lachish appears in Tufnell 1953 (PL 53:2). The handle from Ramat Rahel is housed in the study collection of the HU (No. 8542/12). The handle from Socoh was discovered during a survey conducted by A. Ofer. 6. The handle from Arad is being prepared for 104</page><page sequence="112">publication by M. Aharoni (Reg. No. 1543/1). The handle from En-Gedi appears in Mazar et al. 1966 (Pl. 19:4, 6) and is currently at the IAA (No. 67- 2024). The handle from Jerusalem was found in the Mamilla neighborhood during salvage excavations conducted by A. Maeir (Mamilla Reg. No. 661). The handle from Ramat Rahel appears in Aharoni 1964 (PI. 41:1) and is housed in the study collection of the HU (No. 7432). 7. The I.B.12 handle from Jerusalem's Jewish Quarter was found in Area F3 (Cahill forthcoming d). One of the two handles from Ramat Rahel appears in Aharoni 1964 (PI. 41:2) and is housed, together with another I.B.12 handle from Ramat Rahel, in the study collection of the HU (Nos. 8542/4 and 8542/ 10). 8. The handle from Tell el-Ful appears in Sinclair 1960 (PI. 16B:7). The two I.C.6 impressions from Ramat Rahel are housed in the study collection of the HU (Nos. 7295 and 7431). 9. The handle from Beth-Zur appears in Sellers 1933 (Fig. 44:3). The handle from Tell el-Ful appears in Sinclair 1960 (PI. 16B:9). The handle from Tel Ira has been prepared for publication by the author (Cahill forthcoming c). Two stamped handles that seem to have H.A. 8 impressions were found during earlier excavations in the City of David conducted by Macalister and Duncan (1926: Fig. 202:6; Fig. 205, bottom row, second from right; one of these appears to be held by the IAA at the Rockefeller Museum, No. PAM 3647). Two additional II. A. 8 handles were found in excavations conducted along the western wall of Jerusalem's Old City by M. Broshi (Reg. Nos. 290/8 and 2003/1). At Lachish, two II. A. 8 impressions were found on opposing handles of a single storage jar found by Aharoni (1975: Pis. 19:16, 35:5, 49:15). Two other reportedly similar impressions were found in the renewed excavations at Lachish directed by Ussishkin (1983: 163). Two of the six II.A. 8 handles from Ramat Rahel appear in Aharoni 1964 (PI. 41:10-11). They, and two others like them, are at the IAA (Nos. 64-1736, 64-1734, 62- 71, 62-73). The remaining two ILA. 8 impressions from Ramat Rahel are housed in the study collection of the HU (Nos. 8542/3 and 8542/7). 10. The handle from Tel Burna was found during a survey conducted by Y. Dagan. The four II.A. 12 impressions from En-Gedi are Reg. Nos. 94/30, 80/7, 80/9 and 901/2; the first three of these are published in Mazar et al. 1966 (Pl. 19:1, 2, 5 respectively) and the last three are at the IAA (Nos. 67-2022, 67-2025 and 67-480 respectively). The handle from Jerusa- lem's Armenian Garden appears in Tushingham 1985 (Fig. 9:41); although it is identified here as a II.A. 12 impression, the small scale at which it is published precludes a positive classification. The handle from Nebi Daniel was discovered during a survey con- ducted by students of the HU; it is held in the study collection there (No. 7460). Two of the five II.A. 12 handles from Ramat Rahel appear in Aharoni 1964 (PI. 41:3-4). The first of these two, together with two others like it, is at the IAA (Nos. 64-1741, 54-390 and 62-69). The fifth handle from Ramat Rahel is housed in the study collection of the HU (No. 8542/14). 11. The II.A. 12 impression of unknown provenance is held by the IAA at the Rockefeller Museum (No. PAM 3561). 12. The impression from Tel Azekah appears in Bliss and Macalister 1902 (PI. 56:4 lz); it is held by the IAA at the Rockefeller Museum (No. PAM 1 1 17). A rosette- stamped handle with eight petals and a "pearl- studded" frame was reportedly found in Jerusalem during excavations directed by K.M. Kenyon (Reg. No. 288; Barkay 1985: 416-18, H/77). At least one and possibly two ILB.8 handles were found at Lachish and published by Tufnell (1953: PI. 53:1 and possibly 53:4). The impression from Manahat was found during excavations directed by G. Edelstein (Edelstein et al. 1998: 55, Fig. 4.11:23); it is at the IAA (No. 90-1030). The impression from Socoh was found during a survey conducted by A. Ofer. 13. The handle from Tel Azekah appears in Bliss and Macalister 1902 (PI. 56:40z). The two impressions from Tel Ira, on opposing handles of a single storage jar, have been prepared for publication by the author (Cahill forthcoming c). The handle from Lachish (Reg. No. 15537/1) was referred to by Ussishkin (1983: 163). The two III.A.8 impressions from Ramat Rahel are housed in the study collection of the HU (Nos. 8542/2 and 8542/11). 14. The impression from Tel Azekah appears in Bliss and Macalister 1902 (PI. 56:42z). The two impressions from En-Gedi bear Reg. Nos. 111/70 and 426/18; the first of these appears in Mazar et al. 1966 (Pl. 19:3) and is at the IAA (No. 67-2023). One of the four III.A.12 impressions from Jerusalem was found in B. Mazar's excavations outside the Temple Mount (Nadelman 1989: 132, 134, 140, No. 172). Another was found during excavations in the Armenian Garden directed by M. Broshi (Reg. No. 1098/1). Two others were found during excavations conducted in the Jewish Quarter (Avigad 1983: 45, Photo 27; Cahill forthcoming d). The handle from Tel Malhata is being prepared for publication by I. Beit-Arieh (Reg. No. 347/2). One of the seven III.A.12 handles from Ramat Rahel appears in Aharoni 1964 (PI. 41:5); it is held in the study collection of the HU (No. 8542/15). The other six are at the IAA (Nos. 54-349, 54-360, 54-397, 54-406, 64-1740, 64-2284). 105</page><page sequence="113">15. The handle from En-Gedi, a surface find that has no registration number, is held by E. Mazar. Two handles possibly bearing V.A.8 impressions were discovered in earlier excavations at the City of David (Macalister and Duncan 1926: 190, Fig. 205, top row center and bottom row center). Two of the five handles from Ramat Rahel were published by Aharoni (1956: PI. 27:4; 1964: PI. 19:11) and are now at the IAA (Nos. 54-376 and 64-1742). Two additional V.A.8 impressions from Ramat Rahel are also at the IAA (Nos. 64-2278 and 64-2299). One V.A.8 impression from Ramat Rahel is housed in the study collection of the HU (No. 8542/6). Finally, a handle that may bear a poorly stamped V.A.8 impression was found at Tel Miqne (Reg. No. 534). 16. In Area G, unlike the other areas investigated under Shiloh's direction, Stratum 10 has been divided into two occupational phases, 10C and 10B. This division of phases was prompted by the observation of minor architectural changes carried out primarily in the northern half of the area. Stratum 10C represents the earlier of the two phases; in it, architectural features of previous strata were incorporated into a new organization of the area which included both the redistribution of space and the addition of new features. Stratum 10B represents the later of the two phases; in it, floor levels rose and new walls were added. Stratum 10B also represents the occupational phase burnt by the Babylonians in 587/6 BCE (Cahill forthcoming a). 17. Mazar and Dunayevsky (1964: 123) reported that a lead seal bearing a rosette motif which may have been used for stamping these impressions was found in the 1964 season of excavations at En-Gedi: "Among the few finds attributed to stratum V, mention should be made of the lead seal on which a twelve-petaled rosette is depicted; possibly it was used to stamp rosettes on the handles of store-jars." The location of this seal is presently unknown. E. Stern, who served as a staff member at the En-Gedi excavations, is of the opinion that this "lead seal" was actually a coin (oral communication). A seal possibly used for stamping the I. A. 8 impressions was found in Tomb 106 at Lachish (Tufnell 1953: 372, PI. 45:137). This is a paste seal, round and flat, with an eight-petaled rosette on one side and a nfr-ma'at hieroglyph on the other side. 18. Although some of the impressions occur on handles that are apparently ovoid in section, these handles are always broken close to the impression which was stamped very close to the vessel's body. Had larger portions of these handles been preserved, they would probably exhibit the central rib or double ridges characteristic of their more complete counterparts. 19. Ussishkin (1978: 77-80) has shown that the liquid capacity of six complete Imlk jars ranged from 43.00 to 51.80 liters and that, although the capacity of most of the jars was close to the average of around 45 liters, the difference in volume between the largest and the smallest measured jars was a significant 8.80 liters. 20. Either one or two handles may be stamped on any given jar. Two jars from Tel Ira, as well as the single jar from Tel Malhata, bear rosette impressions on only one handle. Like the complete jar from the City of David, the jar from Lachish and a third complete jar from Tel Ira bear rosette impressions on two opposing handles. In each of these cases, both impressions were stamped with the same seal. Moreover, impressions R 30 and R 31 from the City of David appear to have been stamped with the seal used to stamp the single impression on the jar from Tel Malhata. 21. These six impressions include five that are published (Macalister and Duncan 1926: Fig. 202:6, Fig. 204, bottom row, second from left; Fig. 205, top row, center; bottom row, center; bottom row, second from right) and one apparently unpublished example held by the IAA at the Rockefeller Museum (No. PAM 3647). 22. These include four impressions found during excavations directed by K.M. Kenyon and published by Tushingham (1985: Fig. 9:23, 40-42) and three unpublished impressions found during excavations conducted by M. Broshi (Reg. Nos. 267/431, 1048/1 and 1098/1). 23. Reg. Nos. 290/8, 1075/2 and 2003/1. 24. Ree. Nos. B2-661 and A-4006. 25. Reg. Nos. 1342/1, 1891/1, 2499/1 and 2508/1. 26. IAA No. 61-769. 27. The 13 unpublished impressions from Kenyon's excavations in Jerusalem are listed by Barkay (1985: 416-18), who states that they are represented by plaster casts housed at the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem. 28. The sites of Motzah, Ramat Beth Shemesh and Tell es-Safi can now be added to the distribution map published by Cahill (1995: 245). 29. An archaeometric analysis of the rosette-stamped jars, using instrumental neutron activation analysis and petrography, is currently being conducted by the author under the direction of Profs. J. Yellin and P. Goldberg. 106</page><page sequence="114">BIBLIOGRAPHY Aharoni, Y. 1956. Excavations at Ramath Rahel, 1954: Preliminary Report. Israel Exploration Journal 6: 102- 11, 137-57.

The handles belonged to utilitarian vessels such as storage jars, jugs, kraters and especially cooking pots. The few handles that were found attached to at least part of a vessel could be dated by the vessel's typology. However, in most of the samples nothing of the vessel belonging to the incised handle was found; such handles were dated wherever possible by their stratigraphy or by comparing them with the handles on complete and partially preserved vessels. The vast majority of the incised handles (Groups A-E) belong to the later phases of the Iron Age, the 8th-6th centuries BCE. Other groups of incised handles belong to later periods (Group F) and the Middle Bronze Age II (Group G). Table 1 summarizes the stratigraphie distribution of the groups. The incisions were made by one of the following three techniques: 1. Using a sharp pointed instrument on the soft clay prior to firing. This method was used mainly on cooking pots. 2. Using a sharp pointed instrument after the vessel was fired. This method was used mainly on storage jars. 3. Using a chisel after firing. This method was used mainly on storage jars. Incised handles, mostly dating from the later phases of the Iron Age, have been found at many sites, such as Tell Beit Mirsim (Albright 1932: 88, Fig. 1:4, 6, Pis. 55:3-6, 10; 56:3), Beersheba (Aharoni 1973: Pis. 56:14; 61:96, 97; 66:13; 67:8, 11; 68:4, 16; 71:14), Ramat Rahel (Aharoni 1964: Figs. 13:12; 14:42), Lachish (Aharoni 1975: PI. 35:6- 8) and Tell Keisan (Briend and Humbert 1980: Pis. 92:25-26; 93:44, 46-48, 51). From its earliest archaeological investigations, Jerusalem too has been a source of these handles (Warren and Conder 1884: 156; Crowfoot and Fitzgerald 1929: PI. XI:32; Mazar 1971: Fig. 16:9; Broshi and Barkay 1985: 11, Fig. 3:18; Tushingham 1985: Figs. 4:9; 5:10; 9:21-22; Nadelman 1989: 132-36, Photos 173- 82, 184-86, 188). Despite the abundance of material available, scholars have not been able to arrive at a satisfactory explanation of the purposes of the various incised designs. Among the many proposals put forward, it has been sugggested that they were signs to indicate quantity or contents, various letters, commercial symbols or potters' Table 1.

It should be pointed out that the widely used term "potter's mark" contributes little to our understanding of the purpose of the incised symbols. It may even be incorrect; while incisions made before firing were probably made by the potter, those made after firing could have been made by the owner or user of the vessel well after it had left the potter's workshop. An important step in determining the purpose of these signs is to distinguish between incisions made before and after firing. Other significant elements are the different designs and the various techniques of incision. The following description of the different types of incisions found in the City of David is divided into groups according to incision technique, vessel types and period. A catalogue of the incisions follows the description. A. "X"-SHAPED INCISIONS MADE BEFORE FIRING ON COOKING POT HANDLES (8TH-6TH CENTURIES BCE) This is the largest group in the collection, numbering 163 incised handles (IH A1-A163; Figs. 17-19; 20:1-12). The incisions are in the shape of the letter "X" or a cross whose arms are of equal length, but whose shape and size vary. All were made by a sharp point in the soft clay before firing on the upper part of the handle, close to the join with the rim of the vessel. In most cases the vessel rim was not preserved, making it impossible to identify the vessel with precision and thereby date it. Nevertheless, comparison with the handles on complete and partially preserved vessels indicated that all of the handles in this group belonged to cooking pots of the Iron Age II, of the types found in Strata 12-10 in the City of David. The fact that most of the handles were in fact discovered in contexts of these strata supports this dating. The incisions on complete or partially preserved vessels are of special importance. This group numbered 52 incisions (IH A112-A163) on vessels that can be dated by their typology. The incisions appear on all the known types of cooking pots from Strata 12-10: 1. Pots with stepped or ridged rims (IH Al 12- A128, Figs. 17:30-34; 18:1-7). 2. Deep pots with tall necks and ridges of various types (IH A129-A160, Figs. 18:8-13; 19; 20:1-9). 3. Pots with folded and ridged rims (IH A161- A163, Fig. 20:10-12). Thirty-two of the incisions, constituting over 60% of this group, appeared on the second of the above types, which was very common in Strata 12- 10 in the City of David. Seventeen others were on the first type, and only three incisions were found on the third, later type. There is no doubt that incisions on cooking pot handles were widespread during the 8th and first half of the 7th centuries BCE. This custom apparently declined but did not cease towards the end of the Iron Age. It should be kept in mind, however, that extensively built-up extramural areas of the City of David, particularly Areas B, Dl, D2 and E2, were abandoned during the 7th century, providing a further explanation of the smaller numbers of finds dated to the end of the Iron Age. B. OTHER INCISIONS MADE BEFORE FIRING ON COOKING POT AND JUG HANDLES (8TH-6TH CENTURIES BCE) Seventeen incisions made before firing on cooking pot or jug handles were not "X"-shaped but consisted of parallel lines and various geometric shapes formed by 2-4 lines (IH B1-B17; Fig. 20:13- 23). Nine incisions were discovered in Strata 13-12 and three in Stratum 10, while the remainder were found out of context in later strata. All seem to belong to the later part of the Iron Age, 8th-6th centuries BCE. The majority of the handles in this group were from cooking pots, though a few were perhaps from jugs. These symbols must have been different in meaning from the "X"-shaped incisions. Their relatively small number suggests a special purpose and, since the incisions were made before firing, their significance may be related to the production process. 110</page><page sequence="118">C. CHISELED INCISIONS MADE AFTER FIRING (8TH-6TH CENTURIES BCE) On 49 of the City of David handles incisions were made after firing by the use of a chisel (IH C1-C49; Figs. 21-22). Most of these handles belonged to storage jars, while the others were from kraters, cooking pots and a jug. They too were discovered in the assemblages of Strata 12-10 of the City of David, dating from the 8th century to the end of the Iron Age. No handles with this kind of incision were found in earlier levels, and those found in later levels were out of context. Moreover, some of the vessels could be identified typologically as burnished kraters (IH C2, C14-C15; Figs. 21:2, 10-11) and storage jars with three handles and a juglet rest (IH C42, C45; Fig. 22:10, 13), which were typical of this period. It can be concluded, therefore, that the technique of using a chisel to make incisions was confined to the later phases of the Iron Age. Among these incisions are several pairs of similarly shaped incisions, which suggested that an identical pattern was incised on two different handles of a vessel. Two handles from Area D2 have identical "X"-shaped incisions (IH C24-C25; Fig. 21:20-21); a pair from Area E2 has crosses with arms of equal length (IH C26-C27; Fig. 21:22-23); and a third pair from Area E3 has incisions in the shape of a square with a dot in the center (IH C40-C41; Fig. 22:8-9). However, comparison of the handles revealed that the members of each pair belonged to different vessels, though the fact that each pair was discovered in a single excavation area implies that there was some connection between them. The human figure incised on the handle of a storage jar from Stratum 12 (IH C30; Fig. 22:1) is unique in character. This design requires discussion beyond the confines of the present report. Chiseled inscriptions on pottery are known from other sites, mostly in Judah (Avigad 1972: 1-9; Prignaud 1978: 136-48; Shiloh 1987: 12-14; Nadelman 1990: 31-36). In the City of David alone, a score of chiseled inscriptions were found, including South Arabian inscriptions (Naveh, this volume, Chapter I, IN 8-10; Shoham, this volume, Chapter II, IP 1-2, 8, 11-14, 18-20, 32; Höfner, this volume, Chapter II, Appendix, IP 46-49; others were too fragmentary for publication). All testify to the large numbers of this type of find in the City of David. D. INCISIONS MADE AFTER FIRING ON COOKING POT HANDLES (8TH-6TH CENTURIES BCE) There are eight examples in this group (IH D1-D8; Fig. 23:1-5). The incisions were made by a sharp instrument that was not a chisel. The designs are simple geometric shapes: one resembling a cross, two parallel lines, and others. The dating of the incisions was assisted by the presence of two complete cooking pots of types that were common in the later part of the Iron Age II in the City of David (IH D5-6; Fig. 23:3-4). The other handles seem to belong to vessels of this period. One of the complete cooking pots (Fig. 23:4) is of particular interest; it has an incision on each of its handles, one made after firing (IH D5) and one before (IH A122). The incision made after firing was probably intended to cancel the existing incision on the same vessel. The small number of incisions made on cooking pots after firing is striking in comparison to the 180 incisions of Groups A and B. It was apparently the normal practice to incise on cooking pot handles when the clay was soft, and only rarely were incisions made after firing. The latter incisions evidently had different purposes from those made in the potter's workshop. E. INCISIONS (NOT CHISELED) MADE ON STORAGE JAR HANDLES (8TH-6TH CENTURIES BCE) The 42 incised storage jar handles in this category (IH E1-E42; Figs. 23:6-22; 24:1-9) also date from the last phases of the Iron Age. In sharp contrast to the cooking pots, which were almost always incised before firing, these incisions were generally made after firing. Only four incisions were made before the vessel was fired. The most common design, on 17 storage jar handles, consisted of two crossing lines. Others were parallel horizontal or perpendicular lines. One handle (Fig. 23:21) has an incision in the shape of a "W" lying on its side. Incised storage jar handles like these have been found at other Iron Age sites in both Judah and Israel, and abroad as well (Lamon and Shipton 1939: PL 41:3, 5-6, 8, 10, 12-19, 21, 23; Yadin et al. 1958: Pl. CII: 1-17, 19; Yadin et al 1961: Pl. CCLVL5-6; Goldman 1963: Pis. 110:1661-64, 111</page><page sequence="119">1666-67, 1670; 142:1341; Aharoni 1973: Pl. 57:16; 1975: Pis. 35:6-8; 45:8; 46:13; 49:13; Bikai 1978: Pl. XXI:2; Briend and Humbert 1980: Pl. 92:26-34). F. INCISIONS FROM LATER PERIODS (PERSIAN PERIOD AND LATER) Fourteen incised handles dating from periods later than the Iron Age were discovered at the City of David (IH F1-F14; Fig. 24:10-20). All of the incisions were made by a sharp instrument, all but three before firing. Eleven of the handles belonged to storage jars, two to cooking pots and one to a jug. All were found detached and broken, precluding accurate dating. The conclusion that these vessels dated from the later periods is based on the shape of the handle and the quality of the clay, clearly not strong evidence. Only a few handles could be more accurately dated: 1. A storage jar handle which also bears a yh stamp impression (IH F14; Fig. 24:18); see also Ariel and Shoham, this volume, Chapter IX, L 74. An "X"-shaped incision was added after firing. This handle was found in a context of Stratum 9 of the Persian period. 2. A storage jar handle with a round, illegible, stamp impression (IH F7; Fig. 24:17); see also Ariel and Shoham, this volume, Chapter IX, L 148. An "X"-shaped incision was added to this handle after firing. It probably dates from the Persian period, or at the latest the start of the Hellenistic period, though it was found in a context of dumps of Stratum 5. 3. A cooking pot handle of the Roman period with an incision made before firing (IH F12; Fig. 24:15). It too was found in a Stratum 5 context. 4. A storage jar handle of the Byzantine period with an incision made before firing (IH Fil; Fig. 24:16). It was found in a context of Stratum 3. All the other handles of Group F derived from Strata 9-3 of the City of David, ranging from the 5th century BCE to the 6th century CE. G. INCISIONS FROM THE MIDDLE BRONZE AGE II This group consists of 11 incised handles (IH GI- GU; Fig. 24:21-29). Six of them were found in contexts of Strata 18-17, dated to the 1 8th-l 7th centuries BCE or the Middle Bronze Age II. All of these incisions were made on storage jar handles, apart from one (IH G9) on a jug handle. Six were incised before firing and the remaining five after firing. The most common design resembled a cross in several variations, indicating that there were no significant changes in motifs between the Middle Bronze Age and later periods. Other incisions from this period on sherds other than handles were found in the City of David. It should be noted that in the early periods too the making of incisions on clay was not an unusual practice, either at the City of David or at other sites (Yadin et al. 1958: Pl. CXVIL9; 1960: Pl. CXIV:4; 1961: Pis. CXCVIL23; CCXIV: 19-20; Dever et al 1974: Pl. 12:33; Kenyon and Holland 1983: 458, Fig. 202:2; Seger 1983: 477-95). 112</page><page sequence="120">CATALOGUE A.

Ariel and Yair Shoham A total of 171 stamped pottery handles and body fragments found in Strata 9-5 in the 1978-1985 seasons of the City of David excavations are understood to be local in origin (Table 1). Other handles bearing stamp types that are known to antedate Stratum 9 (the Persian period) are published by Shoham and Cahill (this volume, Chapters V-VII). All but two of the handles published in this chapter (L 123, 167) belong to storage jars. For 109 of them, or 64% of the total, datings have already been proposed for the stamps. However, many stamps have not previously been dated or are unidentified; for example, one "private" seal impression (L 1) has no known parallels, and hence it is not clear if the Persian period level in which it was found provides an Table 1.

Of the stamped handles for which datings have been proposed, 50 (or 46%) come from contexts appropriate to these dates. While the locally stamped handles from the City of David are much smaller in number than the finds from nearby Ramat Rahel, they do approach the variety of types found there. As at Ramat Rahel, few of the handles are from homogeneous loci (Aharoni 1962: 43). The overall number of stamps is nevertheless interesting, considering the fact that Jerusalem was the administrative center of the region in most if not all of the periods represented by the handles. Consequently, many of the storage jars stamped with these impressions were probably produced in or "for" Jerusalem. It should be noted that even within groups of similar types, a variety of wares is observed (in contrast to the uniformity of ware of the Iron Age Imlk type, for example). This may indicate several centers of production for a number of types. The number of handles must also be considered in conjunction with the even larger number of stamped handles of imported commercial amphoras in periods roughly contemporary with those of these locally stamped handles (see Ariel 1990). Most of the local and imported stamped handles were found in fills on the eastern slope of the City of David. The large numbers of handles found, in comparison to the smaller quantities of similar finds uncovered elsewhere in Jerusalem, are evidence of the intensity of occupation in the areas along and above the slope from the Persian period through at least the 2nd century BCE. Finds of stamped handles from earlier excavations higher up on the crest of the City of David provide similar evidence. As has been noted, a significant number of stamped handles derived from fills roughly corresponding to earlier proposed datings for the types. This is generally of little help in determining more exactly the relative chronology of the types. However, in one restricted area comprising parts of three excavation squares in Area E, a series of at least three phases of the Persian period Stratum 9 was found (details of the finds in this spot will be presented in the stratigraphie report, in preparation by A. De Groot). A clear stratigraphie relationship between five loci that yielded stamped handles is proposed by A. De Groot and shown in Table 2. It must be noted that the clearly stratified loci in which these stamped handles were found are all fills and pits. Since absolute dates for the loci are not Table 2. Stratigraphie relationship between five loci in Area E with stamped handles.

However, two comments seem justified. First, the relative positions of the msh and I'hzy/phw' types in the chronological scheme proposed by Naveh (1970: 59-60) gain support from their distribution in the localized phasing found in Area E. Second, it may be that the yh type has an earlier place in the chronological scheme than that assigned by Naveh (1970: 59-60). Many of the stamp types found in the City of David excavations are known from earlier excavations in Jerusalem (Bliss 1898: PL 27:45, 47; Cook 1924: 180-88; 1925: 91-95; Crowfoot and Fitzgerald 1929: 67-68; Duncan 1931: II, 139^6; Amiran and Eitan 1970: 13; Avigad 1974: 52-58; 1976: 27; Broshi 1976: 82). In view of the growing literature on stamps of these types, it is unnecessary to discuss all of the historical and paléographie problems relating to them (see generally Cross 1969a: 20*-27* for relevant stamps with inscriptions; Naveh 1970: 59- 60; Stern 1971 for the lion stamps; Avigad 1976: 21- 28; Kochman 1982; Bianchi 1989; Carter 1992; 1994; Herr 1992; Christoph 1993). The literature up to 1978 was summarized by Stern (1982: 199-213), who added analysis and opinions as to readings, dating and function. Most of the earlier bibliogra- phy may be found there. Recent historical treat- ments of the Persian period (Williamson 1988; Lemaire 1990) have also discussed these stamps. Additional bibliography is included in the discus- sion of the various types and in the catalogue entries below. One interest in presenting this large number of stamps is to see whether the total quantities found relate to issues regarding the position of Jerusalem 138</page><page sequence="146">as an administrative or commercial capital in the Persian and Hellenistic periods (Carter 1994: 127). For this, James Christoph's research has been instructive. Christoph has studied the distribution of categories and groups of categories of the locally stamped handles and body fragments of Judea. Our first question therefore is: disregarding the question of the production sites of the vessels, do the quantities indicate the centrality of Jerusalem as the administrative capital of Judea? Christoph contends that the relatively restricted distribution of the stamped handles rules out the idea that the stamping of the storage jars was a taxation mechanism (Christoph 1993: 195). Rather, the distribution in a number of large centers (Jericho, Jerusalem, Ramat Rahel, Tell en-Nasbeh), with few being found in small sites, indicates that the stamps functioned as (albeit official) trade symbols. The stamped handle finds are concentrated at points of trade and/or production. If this understanding is correct, there is a functional connection with the stamped Greek amphoras, which were traded into Judea, at least in the Hellenistic period (Ariel 1990). The main contribution of this assemblage is to present new types and add weight to types that were previously less well represented in the classical repertoire of yehud stamps: yh , yh ligature (?), "wheel," cross, tet-symbol. The multiplicity of types supports the suggestion that the stamping of storage jars had more of a commercial than an adminis- trative function, and reinforces the possibility that the use of two or more types overlapped. A second interest in presenting this material is to examine the contribution, if any, of the relative and absolute chronological positions of the contexts of these handles. We shall present known types, new types and variants with the relevant stratigraphie data. The stamped handles are presented according to the rough framework given by Stern (1982), and types not found in that framework are interpolated. This framework conforms to the arrangement of Williamson (1988) and Lemaire (1990: 35-36), and to the position of the msh stamps suggested by Zorn, Yellin and Hayes (1994). However, it is not in accord with Zorn (1995) regarding the cross and tet- symbol types. The types of stamped handles and body fragments are thus presented in the following order: I. Anepigraphic "private" (L 1). II. Lion (L 2-24). III. msh (L 25-28). IV. Stamped body fragments (L 29-33). V. yhwd/yhw'zr/phw' (L 34). VI. l'hzylphw' (L 35-43) VII. yhwd (L 44). VIII. yhwd-t (L 45). IX. yhd (L 46-55). X. yh (L 56-77). XI. yh ligature (?) (L 78-97) XII. "Wheel" (L 98-100) XIII. Cross and tet- symbol (L 101-110). XIV. yhd-t (L 111-122). XV. yršlm (L 123-144). XVI. Gem (L 145). XVII. Unclassified (L 146-170). An analysis of the various types found in the City of David, concentrating on their stratigraphie contri- bution vis-à-vis earlier finds, is presented here. More specific descriptions of context, readings, descrip- tions of ware and identity of impressions are included in the catalogue entries that appear after the discussion of each type. The arrangement of the catalogue entries follows that of the imported stamped handles (Ariel 1990). After the catalogue number, the registration, locus and stratum num- bers are given, separated by commas. Stratum designations follow the conventions described in the Preface; some of these designations may be revised in the forthcoming stratigraphie reports. After the stratum designation, a description of the ware is given (consisting of ware color, core color in parentheses, and size, color and type of grits, together with a Munsell color reading). After that may appear a reference to Fig. 25, if a profile is shown, and/or the letters INAA, indicating that an instrumental neutron activation analysis sample was taken. Drawings and photographs of the impres- sions are given at the scale of 1:1. 139</page><page sequence="147">140 I. Handle with an Anepigraphic "Private" Stamp (L 1) An anepigraphic stamped handle was found in a fill in Area G (L. 736), the pottery from which was predominantly of the Persian period. The type of vessel from which the stamped handle had broken has not been identified; the ware is somewhat different from that of the other stamped handles. The stamp is oval in shape and contains an insect in clear relief, identified by Prof. E. Tchernov of the Department of Zoology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem as an ant. The fact that this stamped handle is dissimilar to any of the stamped handles presented here does not contradict its dating to the Persian period; such anepigraphic unofficial stamps depicting animal life have been found in this region on imported Greek vessels and their local imitations of the Persian period (see Stern 1982: 200-10; however, Prof. Stern, who examined this handle, considers it to be of Iron Age II date). Anepigraphic seals of ants are known from the Greco- Roman period (e.g. Richter 1956: 113, No. 539), some from nearby locales (Henig and Whiting 1987: 37, No. 387) and "sometimes in earlier periods" (McDowell 1935: 126). "The ant, symbol of diligence and industry, and so of plenty ... was a favorite subject of gems" (Boardman and Vollenweider 1978: 99; see Macalister 1912: III, PI. 200:41). The use of a locust as a family emblem is known from an inscribed seal of the 7th century BCE published by Avigad (1966: 50-53). Avigad pointed to the appearance of insects in literary sources in connection with personal and family names, though the element nmlh (Hebrew: ant) is unknown in ancient Hebrew proper names. This seal, if it could be shown to belong to the Iron Age, might perhaps be an anepigraphic personal or family seal. Six identical stamped handles dated to the Iron Age II and depicting a galloping horse were discussed by Barkay (1992); an identical impression without stated provenience in the Rockefeller Museum, PAM P.3554, is either a seventh exemplar or may be the handle from Tel 'Azekah discussed by Barkay. Brandl (this volume, Chapter IV) publishes a bulla depicting a bird (B 46) that may also be a personal emblem. Despite the ant stamp's stratigraphie context among predominantly Persian period pottery, its origin and function thus remain uncertain. L 1. G 2216, L. 736, 9.

Handles with Lion Stamps (L 2-24) Twenty-three storage jar handles stamped with an animal understood to be a lion were found in the current excavations. Twelve bear lions facing right, roaring with upturned tail, in circular impressions. These twelve stamps</page><page sequence="148">may have been made with three different seals: one with a diameter of approximately 2.7 cm (L 2-4); one with a diameter of approximately 2.0 cm (L 5-11); and one with a diameter of approximately 2.0 cm and a dot above the lion (L 12-13). Six other impressions (L 14-19) bear lions facing left. Their diameter is approximately 2.5 cm. In a third category of four stamps (L 20-23), humped (?) lions facing right appear in square impressions with rounded corners. The fourth and last category comprises one stamp (L 24) of Stern's type B, a lion standing on its hind legs with its two front legs outstretched, beside an altar (?). Sixty-six animal stamps have been published to date (Stern 1971: 10; see also two impressions of animals in Sellers 1933: 53, Fig. 45 and two in Tushingham 1985: 37, Fig. 19:11-12; none of the latter appear to belong to this group). The 23 handles published here add significantly to the six (or eight including Tushingham 1985) found thus far in Jerusalem, but they are still fewer than the 45 found at Ramat Rahel. The findspots and number of these stamped handles therefore give credence to Stern's view that they are Judean. Visual examination of the handles indicates that while there appeared to be uniformity of ware within subgroups, there was no uniformity between subgroups; some unusual specimens (e.g. L 11) did not conform to any subgroup. The location in Judea where the vessels were made and stamped cannot therefore be established. A further point of interest is the stratigraphie contexts of the lion type handles found in the current excavations. Seven handles were excavated in the Persian period Stratum 9; the others were found in Strata 8-5 and on the surface. This supports Stern's Persian period date for the lion stamps but casts doubt on Duncan's claim for his excavation in our Area G that six seal impressions of the lion type were found in a layer lower than one containing stamps of the "Yahu" ( = yhd) type (Duncan 1931: 42; see Stern 1971: 7-8). Stern's conclusion that the animal motif belongs to the late 6th and 5th centuries BCE is upheld (see, however, Williamson 1988: 60-64). With regard to the stamped handles themselves, the four square impressions L 20-23 appear to have been stamped with the same seal. The other, round impressions yielded no certain identifications, even within the categories noted above. L 2. E2/1877, L. 519, 7-6. Bf (Gy), Sg W. 7.5YR 7/4. Lion type A, to right, circular seal.

In the field above the lion's mane is a faint but visible dot. This may resemble the sundisk of Stern's type C (1971: 10), on which the sundisk appears between the horns of an animal (a bull?). The possible appearance of a sundisk on stamps of type A raises the question of whether the horned animal of type C and the lion of type A are one and the same. Looking back at earlier published round impressions of type A-2, there may be one other impression with a faint sundisk in the field (Duncan 1931: II, plate facing p. 140, No. 5, upper left). L 13.

Handles with Stamps Inscribed in Aramaic: msh (L 25-28) Three or possibly four stamped handles reading msh were found in the City of David and are the first of this type found in Jerusalem. All are oval seal impressions located close to the handle's join with the body of the vessel. Of the three subtypes noted by Naveh (1970: 61), these are of type 1, with archaic mem , peculiar sade and oblique he (see Stern 1982: 208-209). They are type A2 in Zorn; Yellin; Hayes 1994. The City of David impressions are too poorly preserved to yield any seal identifications with those from other sites. L 25 and L 26, however, are identical. L 27 is definitely not identical to them. L 28 is not sufficiently clear to be compared for identity to the others and appears to be of a different ware. Two of the four handles were found in Stratum 9 (Persian period) contexts. The other two are from later contexts. With regard to the origin of the type, one reading of the impression (McCown 1947: 166), as well as the proportionally large number of finds at Tell en-Nasbeh, suggested a northern origin (see, however, Avigad 1958). In a reexamination of the distribution of these stamps (Zorn; Yellin; Hayes 1994: 166), a Neo-Babylonian date was proposed for the stamps, with the suggestion that the finds at Tell en-Nasbeh relate to the short period in the 6th century BCE when the site (Biblical Mizpah) served as the capital of the Neo-Babylonian province of Judea. However, it is now clear that the type has a wide geographical distribution similar to the other more common types (yhd) for which there is no suggested connection with Mizpah. It is likely that when they were being stamped the capital had already been moved to Jerusalem; one need not therefore suppose a different origin for the msh type on the basis of their findspots alone. Christoph (1993) reached the same conclusion. He applied statistical tests to geographical distribution: for example, the lion types versus the Aramaic stamps, or one Aramaic type as opposed to all the other Aramaic types. A chi-square test of the msh type versus the Aramaic types suggested that the two types derived from different statistical populations (Christoph 1993: 133, including the City of David data published here). This is essentially the conclusion of Zorn, Yellin and Hayes (1994). However, almost all the individual comparisons were significant. When all of the individual comparisons were taken together, one could conclude that 143</page><page sequence="151">they were of no significance (Christoph 1993: 178). In other words, if the different distribution of the msh stamps from all the other Aramaic stamps meant that the msh stamps relate to a capital of the Neo-Babylonian province in Tell en- Nasbeh, then we would expect the other individual-to-group comparisons to be insignificant, implying that they belong to the relocated capital of Jerusalem in the later Persian period. However, this is not the case. L 25. El/17188, L. 2115, 9. Lt Bn, Mg Bk &amp; W, Sg W. 7.5YR 7/4. Profile: Fig. 25. msh. The impression was found in a Persian period fill above an Iron Age II floor.

Stamped Body Fragments (L 29-33) According to Stern (1982: 203, Table A; 207), four types of stamps have been found on body fragments of vessels: yhwd j ' wryw , yhwd/hnnh, yh/wd and mw/sh. Only the second type occurs in the City of David excavations. The first known seal impression of the types occurring on the walls of vessels, found at Jericho, was attributed to an Iron Age II context (Hammond 1957: 69), though that contextual association was rejected by Bartlett (1982: 540). The readings for L 30-31, yhwd/hnnh , are restored on the basis of two similar oval seal impressions found at Ramat Rahel (Aharoni 1956: 146, PL 26:4, without restored reading; Aharoni 1964: 46, Fig. 37:10, PL 20:7). The two impressions from the City of David were found together in a Stratum 9 fill. L 29 is similar to L 32 in ware, style and paleography. Though unstratified, L 29 appears to date from the Persian period. The seal impression is poorly preserved, causing considerable difficulty in its decipherment. The best reconstruction, worked out with the kind assistance of J. Naveh and A. Yardeni, seems to be: [y]hwd zy (?)/.. .dny... 144</page><page sequence="152">The yod is restored where a repair (?) hole pierced the sherd. The Aramaic word zy, "[belonging] to," is a tentative reading of the end of the first line, the letters zayin and yod appearing in their cursive forms. A barely visible letter before the dalet in the second line may be an ' ayin , but other readings are possible. L 32 is both broken and poorly preserved. The following reading is suggested: [yhwjdj ...wyw. Part of the letter preceding the penultimate waw may be seen; possible readings are lamed , dalet , resh , ' ayin and tet. Although other alternatives for restoring the name in the second line may exist, Hodavyo appears the most likely, being related to the biblical Hodaviah ; these names combine the verbal imperative with a theophoric suffix. It is probable that any restoration of the name in the second line would entail such a rare combination (see Porten 1971: 47-48). Our thanks to Prof. Naveh for his comments on the above two stamps. Several names of satraps (governors) are known from the Persian period (Williamson 1988; Lemaire 1990: 34-36). L 29 and L 32, though uncertain as to their readings (as Dempsey 1996: 76-77), appear to name two more satraps. L 33 is a circular stamp bearing a cross and what may be letters in each of the four quadrants. It was found in Stratum 9; it too has no published parallels. However, its ware and the size and shape of the stamp are very similar to a published stamp reading yh/wd (Aharoni 1964: 44, Fig. 37:7, PL 39:9 [IAA 64-1793]) and an unpublished stamp with the same reading from Kenyon's excavations in Jerusalem (IAA 71- 344), not identical to L 33.

When the fragmentary stamp is oriented correctly for reading, the beginning of the attachment of a handle is apparent in the left corner of the sherd. The stamp is rectangular with two rounded sides. The lower left corner is broken off, while the upper right corner of the stamp is pierced by a (repair?) hole, damaging the first letter of the upper line. In addition the stamp is poorly impressed. The readings of the he , waw, zayin and the last two yods are uncertain. L 30. El/9228, L. 1364, 9. Bf (Gy), Lg W, Sg W. 7.5YR 7/4. [yhwd] /hnnh.

Handle with Stamp Inscribed in Aramaic: yhwd/yh'zr/phw' (L 34) One handle of this type, the first occurrence in Jerusalem, was found in the excavations. The type was previously known only on four handles from Ramat Rahel (Aharoni 1962: 7, 33; 1964: 21-22, 44-45). All known impressions of this type derive from the same seal. The City of David handle is the first to originate in a homogeneous Persian period level (Stratum 9), thus confirming its universally accepted dating to the Persian period.

Handles with Stamps Inscribed in Aramaic: l'hzy/phw' (L 35-43) Of the earliest handle type containing a two-line inscription, only one clear group of impressions was found in the City of David. Incidentally, this is the first appearance of two-line impressions on handles in Jerusalem. These are seven seal impressions reading l'hzy/phw' (L 35-37, 39-42); on two further impressions (L 38, 43), the reading of the personal name is uncertain. This group more than doubles the number of known impressions with the name ' hzy . It is interesting that all of the readable stamps from the City of David apparently contain the name Ahzai , the most common personal name occurring in the type. As for the date of these stamps, Avigad (1976: 22, 35) suggested the early 5th century BCE. This conforms with the fact that six of the nine stamps come from the Persian period Stratum 9 in Areas El and G. The stamps have a characteristic slightly concave impression made by a large, slightly convex seal. The outline of the seal is consequently rarely visible and it is difficult to determine whether the seal was round or slightly oval. Where the stamping is poor, letters near the edge are not visible. For two impressions of this type found in Ramat Rahel, Aharoni (1962: 33) suggested that the same seal was employed. We have been unable to establish with any certainty whether there are identical impressions in any of the City of David stamps. Their ware appears quite uniform. 146</page><page sequence="154">L 35.

Handle with Stamp Inscribed in Aramaic: yhwd (L 44) One handle of this plene type was found in the excavation, another first appearance in Jerusalem. Twenty-eight impressions of this type were identified at Ramat Rahel (Aharoni 1964: 44), while another was published from Gezer (Macalister 1912: II, 225, Fig. 377). An unpublished specimen may have been found at Tell en-Nasbeh (see Aharoni 1962: 31, n. 22). It seems that more than one seal was employed to make these impressions (Aharoni 1962: 32), though one seal may have produced all but two (Aharoni 1964: 21, 44). The City of David impression appears identical to one of the latter two impressions at Ramat Rahel (Aharoni 1962: PI. 31:10). The handle is the first of its type to be found in a clear Persian period context (Stratum 9), confirming its accepted dating. L 44. El/16774, L. 2066, 9. Bn (Dk Bn), Lg W, Mg Rd, Sg W. 5YR 6/2. Profile: Fig. 25. yhwd. VIII. Handle with Stamp Inscribed in Aramaic: yhwd-t (L 45) This seal impression is identical to one found at Tell en- Nasbeh and published by Cross (1969a: 23, PI. 5:1-2). The only other seal impression with this (Aramaic) reading is from a rectangular seal (Cross 1969b: 19-20, Fig. 1). It is interesting that the single known seal impression with the 147</page><page sequence="155">same reading but in paleo-Hebrew script was found in the City of David by Macalister and Duncan (1926: Fig. 202:10; see Cook 1925: PL 4:20, and newly photographed and read in Avigad 1960: 27, Figs. 17-18). Because of their plene spelling, the Aramaic stamps are believed by Naveh (1970: 60-61) to fall chronologically between the plene two-line impressions and the yhd impressions with defective spelling, i.e., in the 4th century BCE. On the ^¿-symbol, see below, type XIII, "Handles with Cross and 7e¿-symbol Stamps." L 45. El/3749, L. 625, 5. Bf (Bn), Mg W &amp; Rd, Sg W. 7.5YR 7/4. yhwd-t. The seal impression is oval, though the seal itself may have been circular. IX. Handles with Stamps Inscribed in Aramaic: yhd (L 46-55) Ten stamped handles of this type were excavated. This type is thought to come after the yhwd types because of its defective spelling (Naveh 1970: 60-61). An archaeological context at 'En Gedi has already placed the yhd type in the 5th century BCE (Avigad 1976: 26-27), though it may continue into the 4th century. Additional evidence for the Persian period date of this type comes from the contexts of L 47 and L 54, found in the Persian period Stratum 9. At least four seal impression with this reading were already known from Jerusalem. (We have been unable to reconstruct Stern's total of 107 stamps of this group [Stern 1982: 203]; apparently a large number are unpublished. Christoph [1993: 235] counted 66, excluding the ten from the City of David excavations.) The 14 stamps now known from Jerusalem compare with the one from 'En Gedi noted above, one from Battir (Fulco 1978: 265), one from Kh. 'Almit (Dinur 1986: 19), three from Tell en-Nasbeh (McCown 1947: 165, PI. 57:1-3), three from Jericho (Sellin and Watzinger 1913: 159, Pl. 42:m-m) and 49 from Ramat Rahel (Aharoni 1964: 44 and references there). An unspecified number of this type were also found in recent excavations at Nabi Samuel (Magen and Dadon 1995: 16). The stamps from Ramat Rahel include at least ten with symbols above the inscriptions. No symbol is visible on any of the stamps from the excavations at the City of David, but such a symbol may be restored on L 52 on the basis of its similarity to published specimens from Ramat Rahel (Aharoni 1964: 21, PI. 19:6), particularly the "empty" space above the inscription (Aharoni 1962: 31). Aharoni mentioned the impossibility of discerning identical stamps (Aharoni 1962: 31), and elsewhere the use of at least four seals (Aharoni 1964: 21). The same difficulty is found in the stamped handles from the City of David. Avigad (1976: 21- 22) recognized the use of two seals for both bullae and stamped handles of this type. We discerned six different seals; 148</page><page sequence="156">five impressions (L 46-50) were made with the same seal on handles possibly of the same ware. Other possible seal identifications are noted in the catalogue entries below. L 46. E2/1724, L. 536, 7A-6. Bf (Bn), Sg W. 7.5YR 7/2. yhdą This seal impression is possibly identical to impressions on two handles from Jerusalem, two from Tell en-Nasbeh, two (?) from Jericho, and at least three from Ramat Rahel (Avigad 1976: 22, nn. 55-58; the impression from Tell en- Nasbeh, PL 57:2, was probably mistakenly included there), and is similar to the yhd seal from the archive (Avigad 1976: 10, No. 13, PL 5).

Aharoni (1962: 6) considered this particular impression, because of its different shape (of the hel), to be a possible connecting link to the yh stamps. No impressions of this seal occurred on the bullae that Avigad dated to the late 6th and early 5th centuries BCE (see Avigad 1976: 21-22). Possibly identical stamps were found in Jerusalem by Macalister and Duncan (1926: 189, Fig. 203:2 = Cook 1924: PL 5:2 = Sukenik 1934: 183, PL 3), as well as at Tell en- Nasbeh (McCown 1947: 165, PL 57:2).

The yod and dalet are retrograde, while the he is on its side and upside down. We know of no published impression that is identical to this particular one, though many of its 149</page><page sequence="157">individual elements are known on other impressions. The peculiar yod and the retrograde dalet are visible on L 53. X. Handles with Stamps Inscribed in Aramaic: yh (L 56-77) As many as twenty-two impressions reading yh in Aramaic were found in the current excavations. According to Stern (1982: 203, Table A), 105 stamps of this type were hitherto counted: by our calculation, fourteen from Jerusalem, ten from Jericho, eight from Tell en-Nasbeh, one from 'En Gedi, 69 from Ramat Rahel, and the remaining three (from Mosa?) unpublished. Two additional specimens from Jericho were more recently published by Bartlett (1982: 337, Nos. 2-3), and one comes from Kadesh Barnea (Cohen 1983: xx, Photo 22). Christoph (1993: 235) adds one from Tell Jemmeh. This is "the commonest of all the stamps from the Persian period," not only at Ramat Rahel (Aharoni 1964: 20) but also in the whole region. The type is now generally dated to the Persian period (Avigad 1976: 23), and thought by some (Cross 1969a: 23; Naveh 1970: 61) to be late in that period (but see Avigad 1976: 26-27 for a 5th-century date). The impressions from the City of David attest to the use of at least five different seals: 1 . The most common is a circular impression with a double frame whose diameter is approximately 2.4 cm. In it, the yod has a rounded head and the he has only one horizontal bar, hanging from the left line. This seal is represented by four impressions (L 57-60); seven additional examples (L 61-67) are uncertain. With regard to ware, L 57 definitely appears to be different from L 58-60. 2. A circular impression, approximately 2.0 cm in diameter (L 68-69). Its letters are similar to those of the first type. Its ware may be uniform. 3. A circular impression, approximately 2.7 cm in diameter (L 70-72). The letter yod has sharp angles and appears similar to the Latin Z. The letter he has two horizontal bars. The ware of these three handles appears uniform. 4. An apparently elliptical impression (L 73-74). The letter yod is long, with relatively short horizontal lines. The letter he is inverted. 5. An elliptical impression 3.6 cm long (L 56). Both yod and he are correspondingly large and well-formed. Nine impressions were found in the Persian period Stratum 9; the remainder were found in later contexts (Strata 8-5). It is worth noting that at least one example of each subtype was found in Stratum 9. All five, therefore, were in use in the Persian period. An oval stamp from Carthage, quite similar in appearance to the series, has been published (Ferron and Pinard 1963: 150</page><page sequence="158">119-20, No. 304). From the photograph the handle's profile also appears similar. Only one letter, resembling the yod , is preserved on the poorly impressed stamp, which was not identified as Judean or even Levantine.

The poorly preserved impression is probably but not definitely of this type. XI. Handles with Stamps Inscribed with y h Ligature (?) (L 78-96) Nineteen stamped handles bearing a single sign were excavated; a twentieth handle (L 97) is incised. The published impressions of this type number more than Stern's five (1982: 203, Table A). Beside the two from Ramat Rahel and one from Husan, three variations come from what is now Area G (Macalister and Duncan 1926: 189, Fig. 202:8 and Cook 1925: 91-92, PL 4:1-3; Stern 1982: 204, Photo 328, apparently reversed; see Stern 1973: 200, Photo 325), and another that may be of the same type was found in Jerusalem (Bliss and Dickie 1898: PL 27:47). Tushingham (1985: 37, Fig. 17:18-23) published another six. "Several" were found at Gezer (Macalister 1912: II, 233; III, PL 200:38). A possibly related impression (of subtype 1?) was found at Salamis in Cyprus (Calvet 1978: 229, No. 62). Another three impressions of this type were found in the Jewish Quarter of Jerusalem; though unpublished, they are noted here since their findspots are relevant to the dating of the type. Duncan read this symbol as a yod , while Cook (1925: 92) thought it might also be a waw or an alef. Diringer (1934: 128, PL 14:13-15) associated such stamps from the Ophel with the yhd and yh types and read them as yod. Aharoni (1956: 149) suggested that the symbol was a ligature of yod and he , while parallels with the alef on coins were drawn by Garbini (in Aharoni 1962: 68, n. 43, where he claimed that the sign corresponds exactly to the alef on coins of Mattathias Antigonus and Bar Kokhba; the sign is in fact a precise retrograde of the alef on those coins). Stern lists the stamp as a he , though without supporting this reading or noting the disagreement on the symbol's meaning. Cross, Naveh and 152</page><page sequence="160">Avigad did not include this type of stamp in their discussions, apparently excluding the type from the group of official Judean stamps of the Persian and Hellenistic periods. Considering the number of sites with these impressions (as many as 26 occurring in Jerusalem alone), and their tentative dating to the Persian period (Aharoni 1964: 18), their exclusion from the group of official stamps seems unjustified, particularly since readings of yod , he and yh have been suggested. In terms of technique the stamps form a clearly defined group. They are all intaglio and are probably framed on a rectangular seal. Garbini believed them to be unframed, since in the two impressions from Ramat Rahel and in two of the three from Macalister and Duncan's excavations the impression was not deep enough to show any of the frame around the sign. It is difficult to distinguish between the different types of seals that made these impressions. Nevertheless, we may divide the impressions into five subtypes: 1. A square or rectangular impression with a relatively small symbol no higher than 0.9-1.0 cm. The symbol (t) is similar to a retrograde Latin F in which the upper horizontal bar protrudes beyond the vertical to the right. This is the most common group, comprising eleven impressions (L 78- 88) and possibly a twelfth (L 89). 2. A rectangular impression with a larger symbol, approximately 1.2 cm in height (L 90-93). The symbol is the same as in subtype 1. 3. An unframed impression with an especially large symbol like that of subtype 1, at least 1.8 cm high (L 94, not completely preserved). 4. A rectangular impression (L 95) with what may be considered a carelessly executed symbol (=i). The upper horizontal bar does not protrude beyond the vertical. 5. A square impression (L 96) with a unique symbol (^n). An additional handle (L 97) bears an incised symbol ("^). Subtype 1 appears to have been stamped on vessels of at least four wares and subtype 2 on at least two wares. All the stamped handles apparently belong to storage jars, though there is a wide range of size in the handles. The illustrated profiles of L 84 and L 96 are of large and medium size, respectively. L 83 (profile not illustrated) is the smallest. Seven handles of this type from the current excavations come from the Hellenistic Stratum 7, while the others are from Strata 6-5 or the surface. The context of the vessel type that bore this stamp at Ramat Rahel (though not the stamp itself; Aharoni 1964: 18) indicated a Persian or early Hellenistic date. By including this type in his study, Stern advocates a Persian period date. However, the very appearance of this type in the Jewish Quarter supports a later dating. Though early Hellenistic finds are reported 153</page><page sequence="161">there, most of the finds date to the second half of the 2nd century BCE (H. Geva, personal communication). Moreover, this was the only stamp type found there apart from the yhd-t and yršlm types. L 78. El/16034, W. 642-W. 618, 0. Bf (Gy), Sg W. 7.5YR 7/4. yh ligature (?), subtype 1, rectangular frame.

Handles with "Wheel" Stamps (L 98-100) Three "wheel" impressions were found in the City of David. One (L 98) is very clear. It is composed of two concentric circles with radial lines connecting them to the center. Its diameter is 1.1 cm. The other two impressions are so poorly executed that it is difficult to discern any details within the circular frame. It could not be determined whether all three impressions were made with the same seal. The stamped handles with radial decoration are considered to be degenerate imitations of the rosette stamps of the Iron Age II or Persian period (see Sinclair 1960: 32-33; Aharoni 1964: 22; Stern 1982: 206). It is, however, impossible to classify the three stamps of this type found in the current excavations as rosettes. The definition of "wheels" (Mendelsohn 1940: 21) is preferable, since while the origin of these stamps is not disputed, the shape of the six spaces (in L 98) around the central dot has lost any semblance of petals. Unfortunately, the City of David handles can contribute little to the dating of the "wheel" type. Two of the three handles come from the same locus (L. 519), defined as dumps that antedate the post-70 CE dumps (Stratum 5), and the third was a surface find. Small stamps (1.1-1.2 cm in diameter) with radial designs have been published from Jerusalem (Macalister and Duncan 1926: 189-92, Fig. 202:1 1 = Fig. 205, lower row, second from left; from the shape of the handle appearing in the photograph, this stamp is more likely to be imported than local in origin; Fig. 204 upper right, with better photograph in Duncan 1931: plate facing p. 141, upper right; Fig. 205, upper middle; see also Duncan 1931: plate facing p. 141, below handle mentioned above). This latter stamp from Jerusalem is the most similar to the City of David specimens. It is described as "a circle containing a dot, from the circumference of which there are rays with a dot between each pair of rays" (Macalister and Duncan 1926: 189). Other related stamps were found at Gezer (Macalister 1912: II, 223- 24; III, PI. 200:35) and Bethany (Sailer 1957: 195, PI. 3d). These various stamps have the same distribution as other Persian-Hellenistic Judean types. Their relatively simple execution and the small number of preserved specimens may indicate that they did not serve an official function. Sailer (1957: 195) dated the Bethany stamp to the Persian period, while Macalister dated the Gezer stamp to the Hellenistic period. Given that some rosette stamps of 155</page><page sequence="163">possibly "transitional" types from Ramat Rahel and the City of David may be of the Persian period, these "wheel" stamps may date from later in the period or may even be Hellenistic in date. Similar stamps are also published from Byblos (Dunand 1939: 21, No. 1075; 43, No. 1239; 94, No. 1443; 96, No. 1454; 112, No. 1678; 168, No. 2452; Dunand 1954: 210, No. 8661; 226, No. 8902; 421, No. 1 1 143; 474, No. 1 1800; our thanks to the late Virginia Grace for these references).

Handles with Cross and Tčř-symbol Stamps (L 101-110) Eleven stamps of a different radial design, crosses sometimes inscribed in circles, were also found in the current excavations in the City of David. At least sixteen of this type have previously been published from the region, six from Jerusalem (Duncan 1931: plate facing p. 141; see Macalister and Duncan 1926: 189, Figs. 202:7, 203:8, 204: upper left and lower right; Zorn 1995: 100 counted seven, apparently including one of the uncertain items noted below), one from Kh. 'Almit (Dinur 1986: 19), two from Lachish (Diringer 1941: 101 = Diringer 1953: 346), three from Tell en-Nasbeh (Zorn 1995) and six from Ramat Rahel (Aharoni 1956: 148, PI. 27:5; Aharoni 1962: 35; Aharoni 1964: 22, 46). Zorn (1995: 100) included a seventh stamp excavated at Ramat Rahel, identified as "a kind of intertwined double cross (taw)" (Aharoni 1964: 22, PI. 20:12; see also Duncan 1931: plate facing p. 141, fourth row, second from left, and Tushingham 1985: 36-37, Fig. 17:17). A stamp apparently of a cross type not appearing at the City of David may come from Jerusalem (Stern 1982: 207, Photo 343). One of the stamps from Tell en-Nasbeh was found in Cistern 127; the ceramic assemblage there, though not certainly sealed, is quite homogeneous and belongs to the late 7th and 6th centuries BCE (Zorn 1995: 104). Five of the City of David impressions (L 101, 104, 107, 108, 108A) were found in the Hellenistic Strata 8-7; one (L 105) was found in the Early Roman Stratum 6; and three (L 102, 103, 109) derive from post-70 CE dumps (Stratum 5). There are no identities between the stamps from Tell en-Nasbeh and those 156</page><page sequence="164">from the City of David; the Tell en-Nasbeh stamps have more pronounced circular frames enclosing the crosses. The cross symbol is also found on stamped handles outside the region. Published examples are from Byblos (Dunand 1939: 94, No. 1447; 104, No. 1553; Dunand 1954: 204, No. 8600; 232, No. 8960) and from Kenchreai, the port of Corinth (Adamsheck 1979: 39, GR 110). Our thanks to the late Virginia Grace for these references. Aharoni, following Albright (in Mendelsohn 1940: 21, n. 51), viewed the stamps as dating from the Persian period, placing them after the rosette type (Aharoni 1956: 148). A Persian period date is possible, as these stamps appear to be similar to the "wheel" type, possibly deriving ultimately from the winged sundisk, rosette or ^¿-symbol (see Macalister and Duncan 1926: 189; Duncan 1931: 142; Mendelsohn 1940: 21, n. 51). After reviewing the proposed interpretations of the symbol, and considering the context at Tell en-Nasbeh, Zorn (1995: 104) suggests a date in the 6th century BCE, if not earlier. Zorn believes that the limited geographical distribution of the type suggests a historical context in the second half of the 6th century, with storage jars bearing these stamps deriving from Jerusalem. Zorn noted only stamps from Tell en-Nasbeh, Jerusalem and Ramat Rahel, and was unaware of the City of David finds. In fact, the distribution of these stamps does not differ essentially from that of the other groups. Although Christoph did not subject this type to statistical analysis, there is little doubt that the results would be similar, for example, to those described above for the msh stamps. Considering the simplicity of the cross and the variety of stamps, wares and profiles of handles, generalizations about their identification, date and origin are hazardous. Albright, who considered the type to derive from the rosette stamps, himself published two such stamps (not mentioned in the list above) from Tell Beit Mirsim, which by virtue of the site's history must date from the end of the Iron Age II at the latest (Albright 1932: 80, Fig. 15:7, 11), or, according to Aharoni, 701 BCE (Aharoni and Aharoni 1977: 73). Duncan (1931: II, 146) also viewed the cross type as "pre-exilic." The handles from the current excavations at the City of David do not appear to be so early. They may in fact belong in the Hellenistic period on the basis of their wares and profiles. Perhaps significantly, no such stamped handles were found in the Persian period Stratum 9. These conclusions suggest caution regarding Zorn's dating to the early Persian period, or may at least imply that the group from Tell en-Nasbeh is unrelated to the City of David stamps. The first nine stamps of this type (L 101-108A) are described as crosses rather than Albright's and Aharoni's " taw " (Albright 1932: 88; Aharoni 1956: 148), Avigad's tet or ^/-symbol (1974: 52-54) or even Stern's "monogram" (1982: 157</page><page sequence="165">206), as despite all the suggested identifications and derivations they remain symbols "of unknown meaning" (Avigad 1974: 52). Since Avigad concluded that the time was not ripe for a conclusive explanation of the meaning of the íeř-symbol, it should be noted that Lemaire (1991: 140) more recently interprets the ^/-symbol as standing for the word tb (good), indicating the good quality of the amphora's contents rather than guaranteeing the capacity of the vessel. He bases this (among other evidence) on stamps on amphora handles found in excavations in Shechem (Tell Balata; Lapp 1963: 27- 28). In connection with the appearance of the symbol on scale weights from the second half of the 8th century BCE and inscribed in Phoenician, Bordreuil has suggested the symbol stands for the word tb' (stamped/impressed), indicating that the weight in question is in accordance with a specific (stamped) standard (Bordreuil and Gubel 1990: 489). The tenth stamp (L 109) contains a cross surrounded by an ellipse (see Stern 1982: 207). The eleventh stamp is undoubtedly a tet- symbol (L 110), similar to those appearing on the yhd-t stamps (L 111-122). A similar type was found by Macalister and Duncan (1926: Fig. 204, lower left = Duncan 1931: II, PL facing p. 141, second row, fourth from left). If it is necessary to point to a prototype for such a heterogeneous group, it appears to us that the same rationale that generated the variegated incisions (mostly crosses) on cooking pots and other vessels in the Iron Age is at work here (see Shoham, this volume, Chapter VIII). 7ei-symbols also appear alone as incisions made before firing on Iron Age pithoi and storage jars (see Shoham, this volume, Chapter II, IP 34-39).

A very similar but apparently not identical stamp was found in Jerusalem by Macalister and Duncan 1926: 189, Fig. 203:8, where it was described as a cross within an imperfect oval. Stern (1982: 207, Fig. 342) published a drawing, calling it a monogram. L 110. El/10858, L. 1660, 6. Bf (Lt Or), Lg Rd, Mg Rd &amp; W, Sg W. ÌOYR 7/4. Profile: Fig. 25. Tet- symbol type. A similar stamp, identified as the Greek letter theta , was seen by D.T. Ariel among finds from the Athenian Agora, there identified as "late Knidian." Our thanks to the late Virginia Grace and Carolyn Koehler for permission to mention this find. No comparison of wares or profile of handles was made between these items. Fragments of "Oriental" type jars are found in Greece (Grace 1956: 97), as are Knidian fragments in Jerusalem (Ariel 1990: 83). These facts cast some doubt on the local origin of L 110. XIV. Handles with Stamps Inscribed in Paleo-Hebrew: yhd-t (L 111-122) Twelve stamped handles inscribed with yhd-t were found in the current excavations. These are generally round impressions from a variety of seals ranging from 1.3 to 2.3 cm in diameter. Thirty-three of the more than 63 previously published handles come from Jerusalem proper, with 21 deriving from nearby Ramat Rahel (Stern 1982: 203, Table A, and additionally in Mazar 1969: Pl. 11:3; Avigad 1976: 27 and 25, n. 77, mentioning unpublished seal impressions from the Citadel [Amiran and Eitan 1970: 13] and Mount Zion [Broshi 1976: 82]; Lemaire 1985: 251; Dinur 1986: 19; Christoph 1993: 237; Bilig 1995: 71). Another as yet unpublished stamp was found in the American excavations at Gezer (IAA 7^126). Since 1960, the reading of these seal impressions as yhd-t has been generally accepted (Avigad 1960: 23-27). Their date is currently defined as the 3rd-2nd centuries BCE (Avigad 1976: 25). This date finds support in the current excavations from the appearance of six handles of this type in the Hellenistic Stratum 7. Aharoni noted that at least four seals were used to make the impressions from Ramat Rahel. One of the seal impressions from the City of David excavations (L 115) may be identical with one of those published from Ramat Rahel, while only three impressions from the City of 159</page><page sequence="167">David excavations are identical (L 120-122). The number of seals of this type was therefore probably quite large. Visual examination suggests that at least three wares were employed for the handles, and even the wares of the identical impressions do not appear uniform. An interesting phenomenon is the appearance of this type together with stamped handles reading yršlm (Aharoni 1962: 30; 1964: 20, 43; Avigad 1974: 56; 1976: 27; Cross 1981: 67*, n.; Mazar 1981: 4; Bianchi 1989). In the City of David the two types were found together in two loci, L. 408 and L. 1804 (L 111, 116, 120, 123, 130, 137, 140). Christoph's research, again, is instructive regarding this phenomenon. Chi-square tests showed that the two paleo- Hebrew stamps, yhd-t and yršlm , did not differ significantly in their geographical distribution (Christoph 1993: 166-68, Tables 4.25-4.27, and p. 178). As noted above, Christoph's findings of statistical significance between individual groups of Aramaic stamps proved to be insignificant when considered together. Here the opposite is the case: the fact that the distribution of the yhd-t and yršlm stamps is the only comparison conducted by Christoph that is not significant is in fact significant. The similarity of their distribution probably indicates that their chronological parameters were close, if not overlapping. In other words, the geopolitical framework of both types, Hellenistic Judea, is the probable reason for their similar geographical distribution. This is reinforced by another of Christoph's findings, that the distribution of the Aramaic as opposed to the paleo- Hebrew types is generally significantly different (Christoph 1993: 160-62, Tables 4.21-4.23, and p. 179). Christoph concludes that the difference between these two categories was either regional (i.e. a different origin for each group) or chronological. Our understanding that Jerusalem was the administrative and commercial center of Judea throughout most if not all of the period suggests that the chronological explanation (Aramaic = Persian period versus paleo-Hebrew = Hellenistic period) is the more likely one.

Handles with Stamps Inscribed in Paleo-Hebrew: yršlm (L 123-144) Twenty- two stamped handles with a five-pointed star and the paleo-Hebrew inscription yršlm between the points were found. The impressions are poorly preserved and range from 1.4 to 2.6 cm in diameter. With one exception (L 144), the impressions are retrograde and the letters read in a clockwise direction; L 144 is also intaglio. Of the approximately 63 impressions previously published (55 listed by Stern 1982: 209; Avigad 1974: 56; 1976: 27; 1983: 77-78; Cross 1981: 67*, n.; Dinur 1986: 19; Christoph 1993: 238), 31 derived from Jerusalem and 23 from nearby Ramat Rahel. This distribution is very similar to that of the yhd-t impressions (see, however, Stern 1982: 209), with which the yršlm stamps are often found (see above). The latter, however, mention not a province but the city of Jerusalem, and so can be said with greater certainty to have been impressed in or for this city. The date of these impressions is well established as the 3rd- 2nd centuries BCE (Avigad 1974: 57-58; 1976: 27). Most of the yršlm impressions at the City of David were in fact found in the Hellenistic Stratum 7. The others were found in Early Roman fills and dumps (Strata 6-5). Lapp claimed that only two seals were responsible for the 44 stamps then known (Lapp 1963: 28; but see Richardson 1968: 13-14). The stamps from the current City of David excavations are too poorly impressed for seal identifications. All but one were impressed on storage jar handles. The one exceptional impression on a jug handle (L 123) has a parallel in a stamped jug from the Jewish Quarter, except that the 161</page><page sequence="169">City of David specimen bears an unusually large impression (2.6 cm) (Avigad 1974: 56; 1983: 78, Photos 54-55; see also Richardson 1968: 12-16, a yršlm stamp on a cooking pot handle; Macalister and Duncan 1926: Fig. 205, lower left, an unclear stamp on a cooking pot handle). One interesting piece is a large body fragment (L 143) with two impressions, most likely (but not definitely) of this type, on one handle. A double stamping of a yršlm impression on one handle was found in earlier excavations in Jerusalem (Duncan 1931: II, plate facing p. 140; Stern 1973: 207, Photo 335). Another double stamping on one handle, this one of a yhd-t impression, is found in the collection of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (our thanks to G. Hurvitz for permission to note this unprovenanced find, whose inventory number is HU 738). A great variety of wares characterizes the stamped handles of this type too. It appears that the range of wares increases with distance from the clearly Persian period types of locally stamped handles. With regard to the origin of the pentagram symbol, the revised late date of the yršlm type makes a connection with pentagrams on ceramic stoppers of Persian period Chian amphoras extremely unlikely (Stern 1973: 207). A somewhat closer parallel may be an anepigraphic stamped handle with a pentagram within a square found in Rhodes and thought to originate in Thasos (Bon and Bon 1957: 492, No. 2145) and now dated perhaps to ca. 340-330 BCE (Grace 1986: 563, under*No. 13).

Handle with Gem Impression (L 145) Eighteen stamped handles with gem impressions have been published from Palestine: Beth Zur (six items; Sellers 1933: 62, Fig. 56:6-11), Bethel (three items; Kelso 1968: 82, section 326), 'En Gedi (one item; photograph in Stern 1982: 198, Photo 319), Ramat Rahel (six items; Aharoni 1956: 150, PL 26:7; Aharoni 1964: 48, PL 18: 1-2) and Samaria (two items; Reisner; Fisher; Lyon 1924: 285, I.b; 310, II.l, 3; 379, V.2-3; PL 57f:2). An unpublished similarly stamped handle was found by the Joint Expedition to Samaria in 1933 (excavation No. E207, No. 1158, PAM 33.320). A glass gem similar in style to our impression was found in the second Persian period phase at Shikmona (Elgavish 1968: 56, No. 198). Another gem was found at Bab el-Hawa in the Golan (Hartal 1991: 7). More significantly, similar gem impressions appear on bullae found in Wadi ed-Daliyeh and dated to the mid-4th century BCE (Leith 1997). To this last group should also be added a "hoard" of Persian period bullae from the vicinity of Samaria published by Stern (1992); these bullae may have been taken from the Wadi ed-Daliyeh cave prior to its excavation. Of the above, besides the Wadi ed-Daliyeh bullae (which were not archaeologically stratified), only the 'En Gedi impression and the Shikmona gem were found in Persian period contexts. The Beth Zur and Bethel impressions, as well as one impression from Ramat Rahel, were designated Hellenistic. The City of David stamped handle comes from a Persian period layer with Hellenistic intrusions. 163</page><page sequence="171">At a site where no local tradition of stamping storage jar handles were known, this handle would most likely be considered non-local. However, the large number of stamped handles with gem impressions from the region, and the fact that this handle was found in Jerusalem, where a local tradition does exist, make the question of its origin more complex. The tradition of impressing gems on handles is also found in Samos (Grace 1971: 59; for other ring and gem impressions on amphoras, see Boardman 1970: 406; Grace 1979a; 1979b). In the same phase as the Shikmona gem, two Samian amphoras have been identified (Elgavish 1968: PL 61:147-48; Grace 1979b: 183). Nevertheless, the City of David handle should probably be considered local in origin, if local is understood to mean Levantine or non-Greek. The best discussion relating to this group of stamped handles with gem impressions is by Leith (1997). Though Leith was not aware of all the examples cited above, her largest category of impressions on bullae found in the important Wadi ed-Daliyeh material consists of lone standing youths or warriors. Their poses are reminiscent of vase-painting from the late 5th and early 4th centuries BCE, in which gods and heroes assume graceful attitudes (Leith 1997: 30). The date of the bullae, however, is the mid-4th century BCE. Leith's closest comparanda lead her to suggest Phoenicia as the probable source for many of the seals employed on the Wadi ed-Daliyeh (originally Samarían) bullae. Before the conquest of Alexander the Great, both Phoenicia and Samaria were receptive, if not attracted, to Greek culture (Leith 1997: 35). For Leith, the appearance of the Ramat Rahel impressions may indicate that some of that receptiveness was also to be found in Judea (Leith 1997: 2, n. 37). The impression depicts a naked male figure standing to the left. Protruding from his left shoulder is a very faint device. Falling from that shoulder, or perhaps only from his left hand that rests on his hip, is what appears to be a chlamys. In his right hand is another unclear object. The well-executed head (showing signs of a double impression) looks slightly upwards. As the attributes that this figure is holding are unclear, we cannot be sure whether the depiction is simply of a youth, of a warrior (on the basis of his musculature; cf. Waggoner 1984: 263, No. 3), or of any one of a variety of possible mythological figures. It may be Apollo, as it is possible to see a quiver in the unclear object over the shoulder (cf. Henig and Whiting 1987: 11, Nos. 50-52). However, from what remains of the attribute behind the shoulder it is more likely that a caduceus is depicted, supporting an identification as Hermes. Hermes is the most common of the gods found in the comparanda from the region, being identified at Bethel (Hermes-Mercury?; Kelso 1968: 82, section 326), Samaria (Reisner; Fisher; Lyon 1924: 310) and Wadi ed-Daliyeh 164</page><page sequence="172">(Leith 1997: 42-46, WD 14). The "hoard" of bullae, perhaps also from Wadi ed-Daliyeh, includes many impressions with lone youths. Stern (1992: 15) identifies at least one as Hermes, though we can see a caduceus in none of the illustrations. Hermes also appears on seals in the de Clercq collection, cited by Leith as mostly deriving from Phoenicia (e.g. de Ridder 1911: 577, No. 2812). WD 14 was the only bulla from Wadi ed-Daliyeh still attached to a papyrus, which was dated 350/ 349 BCE. The way in which Hermes holds the caduceus in this bullae (just as a drum major holds his baton) is also the best way to understand the unclear object over the shoulder on the City of David impression. In a clay bulla from Carthage with a similar figure, dated to the 4th/3rd centuries BCE, the object is equally unclear; however, it is unequivocally interpreted as a caduceus, identifying the figure as Hermes (Berges 1997: 165, No. 543).

Ariel This concordance provides an area/locus/ registration no. listing of all objects noted individually in Volumes V-VI, thus continuing the cross-referencing of published finds found in the concordance in Vol. II (Ariel 1990 = Qedem 30) and Vol. IV (Ariel and De Groot 1996 = Qedem 35). The categories of the objects are abbreviated according to the list given below. Besides the value in organizing finds published by category according to their archaeological context, a major additional element in these lists is that they provide Israel Antiquity Authority (IAA) numbers for objects that have already been registered, allowing examination of them in their permanent storage location. The same column also includes the inventory numbers (prefixed by HU) of objects in the collection of the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The concordance does not include references to finds noted only in the indices of loci found in Volume V, except when these items have already received IAA numbers. As stated in the preface to Vol. II (p. XII), the locus lists provided after the stratigraphical reports are to be considered the ultimate arbiters of stratum designations. For objects that are presented in catalogue form, the catalogue number or type is given and the reader is referred to the catalogue in the relevant volume. Reference is made to figure number, or to plate number where the object is illustrated only in a plate. Note, however, that for many categories illustrations are presented integrally within the text; no specific reference to such illustrations is given. For objects that are mentioned only in the text or in a table rather than in a catalogue, the page number is given.
