<plain_text><page sequence="1">DEVELOPMENT OF HINDU ICONOGRAPHY I propose here to examine the points in the preceding rejoinder that seem to me to require discussion. 1. As one who has studied such matters critically for many years I am prepared not only to assert decisively that none of the passages of the RV. quoted above contain any explicit reference to images of gods, but to prove that it is only by forced interpretations that even obscure allusions to such images could be discovered in them. Such proof would, however, take up much more space than could be allowed here. I maj', however, remark that no weight can be attached to the translations of Wilson and Hal Ianty nc, which are worthless in such passages because, though they were first-rate classical Sanskrit scholars, they</page><page sequence="2">THE DEVELOPMENT OF HINDU ICONOGRAPHY 527 neither did, nor could at the time when they wrote, possess the philological equipment necessary to furnish critical renderings of obscure Vedic verses. 2. Judging by the remarks that he makes, I think Professor Arehkate?vara cannot have made a study of Vedic mythologj'. The individuality of a god of the Rigveda depends?a point which I have emphasized throughout my Vedic Mythology ? on the attributes exclusively or predominantly applied to him, and not at all on the attributes applicable to the gods in general. How, for instance, could a term so vague in itself as darsata, " worthy to look upon," " handsome," be used to differ entiate V?yu (JRAS. 1917, p. 588), when it is applied to five other deities oftener than to him ? And how could such an epithet as " handsome " be utilized in producing an image by which V?yu was meant to be distinguished from other gods ? I am still unable to understand how the A?vins* epithet n?satya, even if Y?ska's absurd etymology of " nose-born " were accepted, could suggest to the mind of an artist any physical appearance capable of representation in stone. Nor can I see how " the obscurity in the meaning of the word is cleared up by taking n?satya in the same way as satya and nitya". Does this mean that the word is formed from n?sa with the same suffix as those adjectives ? But the latter arc not derived with the same suffix : their analysis is sat-ya and ni-tya. 3. We must be on our guard against relying for definite chronological evidence on conjectural literary dates like those of the Bhagavad-git? and the R?m?yana, more especially as proving the existence of a particular word at a given time in the early centuries of our era. The texts of the epics even now, owing to their many recensions, lack fixity of readings.1 In the Bhagarad glt? the word catnr-bhuja, " four-armed," occurs only once 1 See my History of Sanskrit Literature, pp. 282 and 303, to which I could add a good deal more regarding the variations of the text of tho</page><page sequence="3">528 THE DEVELOPMENT OF HINDU iconography (xi, 46), and is, curiously enough, rather a good example of a doubtful reading. Arjuna, who has just seen Krsna in his glorified form, here calls upon him to resume his " four-armed form ", which means his " human " form, as it is called immediately after (verse 61). Now a " four armed " form is certainly not a human form. There is therefore something wrong about the reading catnr bhuja here. Of the Rdmdyana we know, that the first book was a later addition dating from the time when the epic was Vishnuized. When, therefore, the word catur-bhnja, " four-armed," is quoted as occurring in that book, we can only say that it was introduced into the poem at a late period, though how late exactly we do not know. Chronological uncertainty is still greater in regard to the text of the Pur?nas ; and the approximate date, in its extant form, of the Artha sdstra itself, which refers to Pur?nas, is subject to considerable doubt.1 We may be sure, however, in a general way, that all the Pur?nas in their present form date from three or more centuries after the beginning of our era.2 To them many-armed images of the gods were well known. But when, with reference to the* four mythical ages of the world, they make the statement that Ganesa in the Kali, or present, age had two arms, in the Dv?para four, in the Treta six, in the Krta eight,3 such a fanciful observation cannot possibly be taken to mean that the composers of the Pur?nas intended to say that figures of that deity originally had eight arms which in their time had been reduced to two. For Gane?a, as epics ; but this is not the place to do so. The text of oven the lihagavad-git? is not fully guaranteed till the ninth century A.c. by the commentary of Saukara. 1 Cf. Keith, JRAS. 191?, pp. 130-7; Jolly, ZDMG. Ixviii, 355-9. a Sanskrit. Literature, pp. 299-302. 3 Cf. H. Krishna Sastri, South Indian Images of Gods and Goddesses, p. 101. where the Kafyapa-eilpa is quoted as describing the Chande?a form of Siva as having sixteen arms in the Krta, eight in the Treta, four in the Dvapara age, while he has only two in the Kali (p. 163).</page><page sequence="4">THE DEVELOPMENT OF HINDU ICONOGRAPHY 529 known to them, must have been typically four-armed, as he has been ever since,1 and being a comparatively late figure, he was probably never actually represented as two armed. Such a statement is simply an instance of the well-known practice, in employing numbers connected with earlier cosmic ages, of increasing them symmetrically iii order to emphasize the relatively greater importance of each respectively antecedent period.2 4. The mention of a probable instance of an Indra image at S?rn?th which, without being seated on an elephant, holds a vajra or thunderbolt, is interesting. But it is a pity Professor Ve?kate?vara gives no detailed and definite description of it, as we might then be able to ascertain that it is a Hindu Indra and not a Buddhist figure.' For Vedic scholars at least it is unnecessary to state that " India's thunderbolt?and not the elephant?is mentioned in some of the earliest Vedic hymns". As I remark in my Vedic Mythology (p. 55) with reference to the Rig veda, "the thunderbolt (vajra,) is the weapon exclusively appropriate to Indra." Not only is the epithet vajrin, " holder of the bolt," applied to him alone about eighty times, but other derivatives and compounds of vajra about fifty times as well. On the other hand, it is well known that the elephant is a post-Vedic v?hana or "vehicle" of Indra, being characteristic of him in that period, while the Vedic3 vajra fell into disuse as distinctive of him by itself, probably because of the confusion caused by its use in Buddhist sculpture. 1 Cf. op. cit., p. loi). 3 Thus the Pur?nas state that Dharma had four lejrs for its support in the Krta ago, three in tho Trot?, two in the Dv?para, and has only one in the Kali age. Again, they say that tho Krta age lasts 1,440,000 human years, the Tret? 1,080,000 years, the Dv?para 720,000, and the Kali 360,000. 3 The Silpasdra does not even mention the vajra among his weapons or symbols, see Krishna Sastri, p. 241 ; but it is referred to in H?m?dri, ibid.</page><page sequence="5">530 THE DEVELOPMENT OF HINDU ICONOGRAPHY When Professor Venkatesvara said that S?rya's seven steeds are not found in the images,1 he was evidently misled by their general absence in South India.2 This shows how important it is to include the whole of India when generalizing on iconographie features. The four-armed figure of S?rya at S?rn?th is evidently exceptional, for it is accompanied by only three steeds instead of seven. The foui'-armed bronze of S?rya is no doubt quite a modern figure, in which this particular variation is probably due to the general absence of the characteristic steeds in South India. In dealing with the vast development of modifications and variations in modern Indian iconography, it is hardly possible to make an\' statement of universal application: we can seldom go beyond asserting what is typical and characteristic. When it is said in a single verse of the ItV. that Agni has two heads and three feet3 this description is quite abnormal, whereas it is characteristic of him to be " three headed " (trimxirdhan) in a figurative sense as burning on three altars,4 while he never has the epithet " two-headed ".6 Such a variation is not surprising in an obscure and mystical hymn like iv, 58. In what is said about the four-armed and two-armed images of Visnu recumbent on the serpent Sesa, I can sec nothing to invalidate my general statement6 that a genetically earlier form may be chronologically subsequent to a later development, because an anterior type often persists beside a posterior one. Archaeological evidence proves that four arms are later than two, and six, eight, 1 JRAS. 1917, p. 588. 2 Even here they are not entirely absent ; see Krishna Sastri, op. cit., p. 423S. 5 These abnormal features are actually represented in a South Indian image ; sec Krishna Sastri, op. cit., p. 244. * See Vedic Mythology, p. 93.

DEVELOPMENT OF HINDU ICONOGRAPHY 531 etc., are later than four. But even at the present day some images of gods are made with two arms. The date c. 200 A.c. assigned to the Tamil romance Silappadhik?ram, in which the twelve hands of Skanda are referred to, seems to be valueless because in the com panion romance mention is made of the Gurjjaras, who do not seem to have entered India before the middle of the fifth century. Again, Professor Julien Vinson ascribes the early period of Tamil literature to between the ninth and twelfth centuries A.c.1 That goddesses who have only two arms when beside their spouses sometimes also appear with two only when represented alone, is doubt less due to the artist regarding them as sufficiently individualized to dispense with additional arms holding their symbols. But the omission may result in doubt. Thus one such two-armed figure is described as repre senting P?rvati in Mr. Vincent Smith's History of Fine Art in India (p. 254), while a quite similar figure is labelled Laksmi in the Mus?e Guimet. The only form of the Goddess Laksmi represented in tho oldest sculptures is that in which she appears seated between two elephants that are pouring water over her (Gaja-laksmi). This goddess next appears on the Gupta coins2 with the elephants left out. But that this figure was regarded as derived from the elephant group may be concluded from the fact that the elephants reappear on a coin of the seventh century.3 No special evidence is required for the conclusion that the eight modern forms of Laksmi4 are all descended from this original beyond the reasonable inference that the many differentiated forms in which a common type appears, though the details vary, are all derived from the single oldest form of that type. 1 Malabar Quarterly, March, 1904. * JRAS. 1917, p. 597. 3 Ibid. 4 See Krishna Sastri, op. cit., p. 187.</page><page sequence="7">532 THE DEVELOPMENT OF HINDU ICONOGRAPHY The same remark applies to the various iconographie forms of Brahma, to the sixteen or twenty-five of ?iva,1 or the thirty-two of Gane?a.2 All these modern divergences are the result of the tendency to develop in the course of ages a number of different forms of a single original type. They are only another illustration of the evolution which, in the sphere of nature, has produced the in numerable species of plants and animals from single early types, and in the sphere of man the immense multiplicity of dialects from one language, of sects from one religion, and, in India, of castes and sub-castes from the four original Vedic classes. 5. I cannot see how these remarks disprove my theory that the two additional hands were introduced for the purpose of holding the weapons or symbols by which the deity might be recognized. In early times, when gods first began to be represented in a simple passive attitude, and were conceived as having but very few distinctive weapons, two arms were sufficient. Thus a two-armed Siva could be made recognizable by a trident in one hand alone, or by two different weapons, one in each hand. But when the artist wished to go further and to represent the god performing some action with both hands, the necessity of introducing the symbols of identity would have to be met in some other way. To the early Hindu artist, to whom the conception of a plurality of arms as well as of heads (attributed to certain gods in the Rigveda occasionally in a figurative sense) was not unknown, the expedient could easily suggest itself of adding another pair of arms for the purpose of holding the sj'inbols. When the possession of four arms was once recognized as a divine characteristic, much variety would easily arise in the use of the hands : either all of them 1 Op. cit., pp. 76 (footnote 1) and 89. Some ?gamas refer to 1C8 dancing forms of Siva alone ; see op. cit., p. 88. 2 Op. cit., p. 173.</page><page sequence="8">THE DEVELOPMENT OF HINDU ICONOGRAPHY 533 might be occupied with symbols, or only the two additional ones, or these as well as one of natural (lower) ones. But if gestures or actions were to be expressed it was always the natural (lower) hands that did so, while the additional (upper) hands held up the symbols, generally in a quite obtrusi ve manner.1 This restricted use of the natural hands in my opinion strongly confirms my explanation of the additional arms. It has persisted as typical from the earliest times down to the present day. The plurality of arms, when the start had once been made with four, pretty rapidly increased, in accordance with the tendency I have already alluded to, till it reached sixteen or twenty, and, if we include literary references.2 even thirty-two and fifty, a number which, however, probably no image-maker has actually attained. The original type of two arms persisted beside the later many armed forms, and has in some cases survived even to the present day. Hence, though the general order of development from two arms to four, and then to six, eight, etc., can be established by evidence from the earliest period, at a later time the number of arms affords little or no chronological argument, because earlier forms persist beside later ones and are not ousted by them. For instance, a particular image with two arms may have been produced at a later date than one with four, or one with four later than one with eight ; but the two-armed type is older than the four-armed, and the four-armed than the eight-armed. The number of symbols belonging to a god would tend to increase in course of time and would in turn conduce to raise the number of arms required to hold them. Thus, 1 Resides Gangoly's South Indian Bronzes and CSopin?tha Uao's Elements, I may hero further refer to II. Krishna Sastri's South Indian Cods and Goddesses, which is full of illustrations of this point, e.g., pp. 16, 18, 19, 26, 27, 54, 80, 87, 98, 109, 117, 119, 134, 139, 14?, 150, 157, 164, 179, 200,242. 2 Skanda Purdna, quoted by Krishna Sastri, p. 77 ; cf. p. 151.</page><page sequence="9">534 THE DEVELOPMENT OF HINDU ICONOGRAPHY no fewer than ten weapons and symbols are attributed to the Mahfiganapati form of Ganosa; and this list, as Krishna Sastri says, "indicates that the god must have ten hands."l 6. As regards the bewildering variety of iconographie detail which Professor Venkate?vara enumerates and is doubtful how to explain, it is doubtless due to the evolu tionary multiplication, in modern times and especially in South India, of forms of what were originally single gods, and to the consequent necessity of differentiating these forms by modifications and additions of distinctive features. Thus, all the twenty-four forms of Visnu, the twenty-five of Siva, and the thirty-two of Ganesa have to be distinguished. All the mass of modern detail involved in this process can throw little or no light on the early modifications of the original god, except in so far as they may help to extract the typical form from the later developments ; and certain features, such as the use of thfe natural hands, may prove to be persistent survivals from tho earliest times. 7. I am unable to follow Professor Venkate?vara in attributing to the Hindu2 artist of nearly 2,000 years ago the symbolic conceptions that have grown up in South India during the present century. . That artist was confronted with the definite concrete problem of ex pressing in metal3 and stone the forms of anthropomorphic gods as differentiated by symbols from men and from one another. 8. My conclusions as compared with Professor Venkatesvara's are the following :? 1 Op. cit., p. 173. 2 The Buddhist artist, his predecessor or contemporary, represented (he gods in purely human shape, as exemplified by Laksmi at S?tichi &lt;sdccm:l century b.c.), and Indra in the Qaudh?ra sculptures of the north west (first century A.c.). 3 I do not understand what is meant by saying that "the art of a nation ... is due to an overflow ... of thoughts too definite to be put into words ".</page><page sequence="10">THE DEVELOPMENT OF HINDU ICONOGRAPHY 535 (1) There is no evidence to show that the gods were iconographically represented in the earliest Vedic age; but there is clear evidence of the use of images from the latest Vedic age onwards. (2) Gods begin to be represented on coins from the first century A.C. onwards, the earliest being two-armed and soon after four-armed. Eight-armed and twelve armed images of gods can be dated as far back as the sixth century A.c. The date of the earliest literary mention of gods with four, eight, or twelve arms is uncertain. (3) The intention of the ancient Hindu artist was to represent the gods in concrete form in accordance with the account of their appearance given in religious tradition. ' In the earliest extant specimens, both Buddhist and Hindu, the gods are represented in purely human shape, with two arms and one head. In the first century two more arms were added for the purpose of holding weapons or symbols of identification when the natural hands were occupied with action or gesture. (4) When the possession of four arms had become established as a divine characteristic, the number of arms was increased in accordance with a natural tendency of development, and the various forms of the same god that were gradually evolved were differentiated by the re-arrangement, omission, or addition of details. The origin and evolution of characteristic features in iconography should be studied historically, mainly on the basis of concrete evidence, while the employment of a priori arguments should be avoided as much as possible.
