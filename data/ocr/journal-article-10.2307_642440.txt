<plain_text><page sequence="1">Greece &amp; Rome, Vol. XXXII, No. 2, October 1985 IN DEFENCE OF CATULLUS' DIRTY SPARROW By RICHARD W. HOOPER Poliziano's theory that the sparrow of Lesbia in Catullus 2 and 3 is none other than the phallus of the poet has not fared well in recent years.' H. D. Jocelyn has mounted a spirited attack against it, taking most effective aim against the arguments of E. N. Genovese and G. Giangrande, whose articles, as he points out, 'seem to have no nineteenth or twentieth-century predecessors'.2 This attack has been facilitated by the tendency of both Genovese and Giangrande to dilute their arguments with extravagant claims. Thus Genovese would have the passer stand not only for the poet's phallus, but for an actual pet of Lesbia, a fascinum charm around her neck (with bells on it!), and a human rival, possibly named Passer, as well.3 Similarly, Giangrande spends too much of his time attempting to attach poem 2b to 2 by means of a tortuous interpretation of the Atalanta myth, just as he develops a convoluted argument about the tension between topoi of Totenklage um Tiere and impotence at the end of 3.4 Even Jocelyn gets too far away from the poems themselves with detailed examinations of masturbation and fellatio among the ancients (pp. 429-33) and a careful footnote on the missionary position (pp. 433 n. 65). There are only two ways to establish the probability of an obscene allegorical interpretation of Catullus 2 and 3: to examine the usage of passer in the poems themselves, and to see whether Catullus' imitators in antiquity - especially Martial5 - were aware of and exploited Catullus' double entendre. In defending Poliziano's theory, this paper will argue these two points in more detail than they have been treated in the past. In considering Catullus 2 and 3 commentators have ignored what should be an important fact: these are the first poems preserved in antiquity specifically about a sparrow. Certainly laments over dead pets had become a Hellenistic topos,6 but those preserved are about locusts, grasshoppers, rabbits, nightingales, partridges, and other pets - but never about sparrows, nor indeed have any actual inscriptions to birds or insects been found. Eric Havelock seems to have sensed something amiss with the picture of a sparrow as a pet, dead or otherwise, when he said, '... that grubby little bird belongs to the backyard, not to the boudoir. Lesbia's playmate was both tender, precious and pathetic.' C. J. Fordyce similarly called the sparrow 'not only notoriously dowdy and stiff-feathered' but also 'practically untrainable', having 'none of the qualities of a pet'.' I know of no evidence prior to Catullus that the Romans or anyone else tried keeping these wild birds as pets.8 Even assuming this is a real sparrow, it acts in a particularly</page><page sequence="2">IN DEFENCE OF CATULLUS' DIRTY SPARROW 163 un-sparrow-like way. The picture at 2.2-4 is, for instance, most strange: quicum ludere, quem in sinu tenere, cui primum digitum dare adpetenti et acris solet incitare morsus. E. T. Merrill in his commentary (Cambridge, 1893) gives the only possible literal interpretation of these lines: pressing the sparrow to her bosom with one hand, she holds him confined while teasing him with, and provoking him to peck at the extended forefinger of the other hand. I have myself enjoyed the company of a pet parrot named Epaminondas for thirteen years, and I can assure the reader that although he is far more intelligent than any small-brained, wild field bird, and consider- ably more used to humans, he would never put up with being hugged to my bosom as I bopped him playfully on the beak. Furthermore, at 3.8-10 we are told that the sparrow simultaneously stays on his mistress' lap and leaps about hither and thither, peeping all the way. Apparently Lesbia's lap was as ample as her hospitality. The inevitable response to such nit-picking as this is to say that, of course, a poem is not meant to be a photograph, and that Catullus is aiming at images and symbols of his deep affection for Lesbia, not at realism. Even so, if Catullus has chosen to paint a real picture, then why has he settled upon the specific and unusual image of a sparrow? Why not a nightingale, or a locust, or a lap dog? If the only answer is that Catullus wrote about a sparrow because Clodia owned one, then criticism has a right to ask why the details in the poems are not as realistic as the motivation. The connotations of 'sparrow' are well known. Even in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics the determinative for 'little, evil, bad' was gerau, the sparrow.9 It is of course sparrows who pull Aphrodite's chariot in Sappho 191 (Page), 9-10, where they are called KAot with seeming incongruity by the poetess. This picture was so familiar that Apuleius could burlesque it at Met. 6.6, where the chariot is borne this time by four doves (columbae) and followed by a crowd of chattering passeres who 'frolic' (lasciviunt) behind the chariot. Sparrows and doves were frequently associated, as, for instance, at Pliny Nat. Hist. 10.52.107: columbae et turtures octonis annis vivunt. contra passeri minimum vitae, cui salacitas par. In addition to such circumstantial evidence for the general salaciousness of sparrows, Festus (p. 410 Lindsay) provides straightforward testimony for the sparrow's con- nection with the meaning phallus: strutheum in mimis praecipue vocant obscenam partem virilem, a salacitate videlicet passeris, qui Graece orpovOe dicitur.10</page><page sequence="3">164 IN DEFENCE OF CATULLUS' DIRTY SPARROW The fact that these poems could function as allegories - or at least have an allegorical level - should not be thought of as an isolated case. Niall Rudd has demonstrated that the bridge at Colonna in Catullus 17 has been strangely personified - he calls it an 'oddly human bridge' - in order to bring unity to the poem by connecting the personalities of the rickity bridge and the stupid municeps Catullus would like to throw off it. S. L. Richardson has suggested, even more apropos, that the mullets in Catullus 15.18-19 are actually euphemisms for the phallus of the poet. P. G. Maxwell-Stuart similarly interprets the book roll fondled by Straton's boyfriend in Anth. Pal. 12.208.1 Within the sparrow poems themselves, and still denying any special significance for passer, even Jocelyn admits the sexually charged atmosphere of such words as sinus, noscere, and devorare, to which of course should be added Catullus' own use ofgremium at 45.1-2 and especially 67.30.12 Having established the fact that passer did have sexual overtones and could take on the meaning of phallus, and that a poem - especially one by Catullus - that allowed its vocabulary to function allegorically would not be an oddity, we have still to see how an obscene interpreta- tion of passer would operate within poems 2 and 3. It is, however, at precisely this point that a value judgement becomes necessary. Are we to join the traditionalists and speak of 'the exquisite grace of the two sparrow-songs of Catullus' and say that 'equal artlessness of spirit marks his grief over the sparrow, lamented because it was her pet, but also because he felt the pitifulness of beauty dead', or do we ask instead, Quid denique frigidius eo Tecum ludere sicut ipse possem et quae sequuntur si haec simpliciter et ad litteram, ut loquuntur, intelligi debeant?13 I naturally tend towards the second view and feel that the poems, if taken literally, offer a skillful but rather tired arrangement of traditional Hellenistic themes, made mildly amusing by an ironic sense of exaggeration.14 What new meaning, then, do the poems take on if the passer can also stand for the poet's phallus? Starting with 2, we find that the obscene allegory renders the poem's imagery more complex, amusing, and sophisticated, and that its other- wise irritating inconsistencies begin to make sense. While the sexual picture which thus emerges from 2.2-4 never approaches vulgarity (for it is never openly expressed), the connection between 3-4 and 9-10 is now obvious and, to anticipate a bit, the seeming inconsistency of movement in place at 3.8-10 is removed. The poem becomes an intimate metaphor rather than a precious conceit. What Catullus is getting at in 2.9-13 requires special attention. The basic meaning has to be that he wished masturbation were as pleasant</page><page sequence="4">IN DEFENCE OF CATULLUS' DIRTY SPARROW 165 as sexual intercourse with Lesbia. That interpretation has been a bit too rough for most commentators to handle,s1 and the strange shift in mood from possem to est as well as the seemingly pointless reference to the Atalanta myth have caused serious problems. Indeed, the mood change does not work grammatically, and the reference to Atalanta, who after all supposedly did not want to lose the footrace and thus would not have welcomed the golden apples, seems to go against the context of the passage. It certainly does not make sense to say, 'Would that I could play with the sparrow just as Lesbia does! That's as welcome as the hateful apples were to Atalanta!' The easiest way to get rid of both the mood change and the difficult allusion to Atalanta is to print lines 11-13 as a separate poem.16 I would prefer to accept Voss's emendation at 2.9 of posse for possem, which Kenneth Quinn called 'a brilliant effort to weld 1-10 to 11-13', but 'rather too good to be true'." Furthermore, the sense of the Atalanta reference should cause no particular problem if we follow Merrill in recalling the interesting psychological twist which Ovid put on the Atalanta story in Met. 10.560-680. In that version the maiden is depicted as falling in love with Hippomenes against her will, and thus secretly wishing his victory: o quotiens, cum iam posset transire, morata est spectatosque diu vultus invita reliquit! (661-662). It fits the ironic tone of the whole poem for Catullus to imply that Atalanta wanted to be caught and that she welcomed the sight of the tricky apples.18 The passage would then mean: 'To be able to play with myself as skillfully as Lesbia does is an idea as welcome to me as, in reality (this, I take it, being the sense of ferunt), Hippomenes' golden apple was to Atalanta.' I would agree with Jocelyn that Voss went too far in further proposing an obscene sense to malum.19 The third poem of Catullus must be thought of as a particularly sophisticated combination of two genre poems: the lament over a dead pet, and the lament over impotence.20 There is a similar joke in the Satyricon of Petronius 137.1-2 when the priestess Oenothea upbraids Encolpius for having killed the sacred goose of Priapus: at illa complosis manibus 'scelerata' inquit 'etiam loqueris? nescis quam magnum flagitium admiseris: occidisti Priapi delicias, anserem omnibus matronis acceptissmum . . .' The double entendre here is obvious, since that part of Priapus which is also matronis acceptissimum is well known. In the case of Catullus</page><page sequence="5">166 IN DEFENCE OF CATULLUS' DIRTY SPARROW 3, the mood is immediately set in the first two verses: Lugete, o Veneres Cupidinesque et quantum est hominum venustiorum! Havelock expressed well the feeling created by these opening lines when he wrote: 'The lines reflect that urban, sophisticated idiom which composed such an important ingredient in the Catullan temper.'21 The clue, as David O. Ross, Jr. has pointed out,22 is in the word venustus, which belongs especially to the urbanitas of the polymetrics. There was a whole vocabulary used by the country club set to which Catullus and his friends aspired, and it is in the polymetrics that they are most consistently employed. The most famous example is basium,23 the special word employed by this jet set for kiss, and it is within this overcharged atmosphere that we should expect the double meaning of passer to be appreciated. Such word plays would be unsuitable to the epigrams, which stem from traditional Roman origins, and in the longer poems, which aspire after the technical polish of the neoterics; in the polymetrics, however, sophisticated, urbane style was the thing, even in poems of real sorrow like 11, with its learned geographical excursus, or 30, with the characteristic diminutive amiculus in the second line and the trope of winds blowing away words and oaths at lines 9-10. It is in this context as well that the reference to masturbation, so troubling to Giangrande and Jocelyn, must be interpreted. Investiga- tions into the masturbatory practices of the ancients are out of place here; Catullus is making a risque reference to masturbation with the same self-deprecating shrug as the god Priapus in Priap. 33.5-6, and with as little concern for public scandal as the Cynic Diogenes in the famous story in Diogenes Laertius 6.46. Most jokes are, after all, more appropriate at a cocktail party than in the market place. Besides, the whole point of posse (or for that matter, possem) at 2.9 is that the poet's wish cannot be fulfilled. In sexual technique Lesbia ipsa is without peer. It is in the same context that the unusual double diminutive turgiduli ... ocelli is to be understood. As Hermann Trinkle has pointed out, diminutives were especially characteristic of the neoterics, and are con- sequently used most heavily by Propertius and Ovid in those earlier works - the first two books of Propertius and the Amores of Ovid - which are still under neoteric influence. Trainkle especially picks out ocellus as 'geradezu ein Kennwort der Liebeselegie'. Concerning diminutives in general, he remarks: Die poetae novi haben diese Ausdriicke, die in die Sprache der Liebenden geh6ren und Zirtlichkeit offenbaren, aus der lebendigen Umgangssprache iibernommen, als sie Liebende in ihren Werken reden liessen.24 The double use of diminutive for both adjective and noun occurs only again at 25,2 imula auricilla,</page><page sequence="6">IN DEFENCE OF CATULLUS' DIRTY SPARROW 167 where it is meant to produce an effete, homosexual atmosphere, and in the great neoteric epyllion at 64.316 aridulis labellis, referring to the Parcae sisters. The use of diminutives at 3.18 reemphasizes the rarified atmosphere of the upper-class, over-educated soiree, the haunt of the venustiores, where Catullus' sophisticated witticisms would form part of the stylish banter of the day. Jocelyn has trouble with the tua of 3-17 because the sparrow, who is dead, is blamed, rather than the fates (see pp. 440-1). He feels that Scaliger's defence of the manuscript reading tua does not work, and that vestra would be better supported by his parallel of Juvenal 6.7-8: Cynthia ... cuius turbavit nitidos extinctus passer ocellos. Giangrande seems to share the problem (pp. 143-4), and he removes it by saying that a reproach is never addressed to the dead pet in the Hellenistic topos 'Totenklage um Tiere', but that it is typical in poems on the 'death' of a mentula. Both of these solutions are, I think, made unneces- sary by G. P. Goold's reading of quod at 3.16.25 Goold properly calls this poem a 'mock elergy'. In exploding the corrupt reading of 3.16 with its irritating hiatus - o factum male o miselle passer - he points out (p. 200) that o factum male is not meant as a lament over the sparrow's death, but rather as a lament over Lesbia's sorrow. Since that is the point of the poem, a 'signpost', as he puts it, is needed between o factum male and tua nunc opera, which he supplies by conjecturing quod for the second exclamation o: o factum male, quod, miselle passer tua nunc opera meae puellae flendo turgiduli rubent ocelli! The sense therefore becomes, 'O calamity that the sparrow made my sweetheart weep!'26 This is a very pretty poetic conceit, which works particularly well with the double meaning of passer. The outburst against malae tenebrae Orci at 13-14 no longer disrupts the forward movement of the poem, but returns to its proper place as a momentary, ironic exaggeration, while Lesbia's sorrow emerges as the final point of the poem and the only real tragedy attendant upon the poet's (we assume temporary) impotence. If we can therefore assume, at least temporarily, that Catullus' sparrow poems were composed as an obscene allegory, we should naturally expect to see that fact reflected in subsequent poems inspired by them. The most important of these imitations are Ovid Am. 2.6, Statius Silv. 2.4, and Martial 1.7,109; 4.14; 7.14; and 11.6. Of these Ovid's poem is perhaps the most interesting since it is not only the earliest variation on Catullus' poem we have, but also goes out of its way in the first verse to show its dependence: Psittacus, Eois imitatrix</page><page sequence="7">168 IN DEFENCE OF CATULLUS' DIRTY SPARROW ales ab Indis. Ovid started his poem with the word psittacus just as Catullus began his first sparrow poem with the word passer, and then underscored his reference with the phrase Eois ... ab Indis. By Ovid's time this had already become a commonplace in elegy,27 but it began with Cat. 11.2-4: sive in extremos penetrabit Indos, litus ut longe resonante Eoa tunditur unda... It would, however, be unreasonable to look for obvious confirmation of the allegorical level of Catullus' poem in Ovid's, for the Augustan poet is deliberately burlesquing the surface imagery of the sparrow poems. He is, in effect, taking the literal interpretation of the passer poems and exaggerating it ad absurdum. The Venuses, Cupids, and beautiful people who are told by Catullus to come and mourn are transformed by Ovid into a flock of the parrot's feathered friends and lovers (2-16), and the sparrow's journey down the dark road whence none return is changed into an exaggerated picture of a bird's paradise (49-62) peopled, or perhaps we should say birded, with noble aves of the past. Corinna is not the centre of Ovid's poem as Lesbia was of Catullus', however, for the catalogue of virtues at the centre of the poem focuses our attention on the parrot; we briefly see Corinna praying for her pet (43), but our emotions - such as they are - go out to the loyal little fellow whose last words are Corinna, vale! (48). We should also not forget that this was apparently the first epitaph ever written for a parrot, a choice prompted no doubt not only because of the opportunities it offered for rhetorical expansion, but also because of the exaggerated and humorous contrast in sound between passer, deliciae, and psittacus imitatrix. There may, however, have been one more joke implied by this choice. Statius' elegy to Atedius Melior's parrot is similarly unsuitable as a test case, for it was obviously inspired more by Ovid's elegy than by Catullus' lament and can thus only be considered an imitation of an imitation. Fordyce rightly called it 'an orgy of erudition'.28 If there is to be proof that the ancients recognized this secondary level of meaning, it must therefore come from Martial, and indeed it was his poem 11.6 which first suggested the obscene symbolism to Poliziano.29 In this poem, which is set on the Saturnalia (3-4), Martial addresses his cup-bearer Dindymus: misce dimidios, puer, trientes, quales Pythagoras dabat Neroni, misce, Dindyme, sed frequentiores: possum nil ego sobrius; bibenti</page><page sequence="8">IN DEFENCE OF CATULLUS' DIRTY SPARROW 169 succurrent mihi quindecim poetae. da nunc basia, sed Catulliana: quae si tot fuerint quot ille dixit, donabo tibi Passerem Catulli. The only possible alternative to an obscene interpretation for the last line is that a collection of Catullus' poems, beginning with and therefore called the Passer after our number 2, is meant as the present which Martial will give his cup-bearer.30 There is certainly nothing wrong with this theory, but there is no need for us to go into it any further, nor to consider the question whether or not the supposed Passer collection was the one we have now, or a shorter collection, or indeed in what form the poems of Catullus were most probably published,31 for the most that any ancillary meaning of passer could do for the poem of Martial is to turn it from a double into a triple entendre. There is certainly a play on words, but however extensive it is, the basic obscenity of the joke is painfully obvious. Indeed, the obscenity is not only obvious, it is very carefully pre- pared. We are deliberately placed in the Saturnalia, a festival of ac- knowledged licence. Martial's cup-bearer is named Dindymus after Mt. Dindymus, the Phrygian mountain sacred to the goddess Cybele, whose influence on the young priest Attis of Catullus 63 was and is famous. Indeed, Catullus twice (at 35.14 and 63.91) calls Cybele domina Dindymi. Martial calls for more wine. He compares his cup-bearer with Pythagoras, the infamous cup-bearer of Nero. Lest there be any misunderstanding about what the reference to Pythagoras implied, here is the information which Tacitus supplies about him at Ann. 15.37.4: ipse per licita atque inlicita foedatus nihil flagitii reliquerat, quo corruptiro ageret, nisi paucos post dies uni ex illo contaminatorum grege (nomen Pythagorae fuit) in modum sollemnium coniugiorum denupsisset. inditum imperatori flammeum, missi auspices; dos et genialis torus et faces nuptiales, cuncta denique spectata, quae etiam in femina nox operit. This Pythagoras may be the same as the 'spear-chucker' Doryphorus whose marriage to Nero is also mentioned at Suetonius Nero 29, where further scandalous details about their relationship are listed. The boy is then told to give Catullan kisses, a line which obviously refers to 5.7.32 To sum up, then, Martial says: 'It's Saturnalia! Boy, mix the wine and get me drunker than Pythagoras got his "wife" Nero. Then give me a thousand kisses, and then a hundred, then another thousand, then a second hundred, then another thousand, then a hundred and I'll give you -' What? A book of poetry? A pet bird in a gilded cage? If that's all the boy can expect then the seduction is certainly working backwards.</page><page sequence="9">170 IN DEFENCE OF CATULLUS' DIRTY SPARROW Jocelyn objects (pp. 423-4) that 'the pretty boys of Antiquity did not welcome anal penetration'. That is not at all surprising, but then the pederasts of antiquity were no more concerned with their victims' consent than was Ballio with the complaints of his little catamite (Plautus, Pseud. 3.1). That sodomy was the preferred activity is evident enough from such passages as Juvenal 2.10-13 and 9.43-44, Priap. (pseudo-Tib.) 83.21-23, Apul. Met. 9.28, or Petronius, Sat. 23.3. Jocelyn also says, 'One has only to put the alleged second meaning of vv. 14-16 into plain Latin, e.g. si multa mihi milia basiorum dederis, te paedicabo, for its absurdity to become manifest' - apparently without realizing that he has composed a perfectly respectable prose Priapeum, with which one could compare Priap. 38.3-4: pedicare volo, tu vis decerpere poma; quod peto, si dederis, quod petis accipies. Closely related to 11.6 is Martial's 4.14, a poem addressed to Martial's friend the epic poet Silius Italicus, asking him to put aside his serious themes of Hannibal and the Punic Wars and listen instead to Martial's lascivis madidos iocis libellos (12). As in 11.6, we are celebrating the Saturnalia (7-9), and the last line clearly refers to the passer of Catullus: sic forsan tener ausus est Catullus magno mittere Passerem Maroni. This certainly increases the probability that a collection of Catullus' poems called the Passer existed, for the libellos of Martial are deliber- ately compared with the Passerem of Catullus. At the end of the poem, however, comes a seeming contradiction, or perhaps even a mistake on Martial's part. Catullus, it has been noted,33 could not have sent Virgil a copy of his poem, for Virgil was only 15 or 16 years old at the probable time of Catullus' death. To blame this situation on con- fusion, however, overlooks two important considerations. First of all, by equating Silius Italicus with Virgil and himself with Catullus, Martial has managed to pay himself and his friend a great compliment.34 Second, by linking up Virgil and Catullus at the time of Virgil's adolescence, Martial has been able to use Virgil's unfortunate reputa- tion in antiquity35 as an opportunity once again to exploit the double meaning of passer. If this seems forced, perhaps a modern parallel will make it clearer. Assumng that Hemingway had been as addicted to the cock pit as he was to the bull ring and that instead of The Sun Also Rises he had called his novel The Cock and the Bull, could we read with a straight face a later author's dedication which stated: 'Dear friend, I send you this novel just as Hemingway sent his Cock to the</page><page sequence="10">IN DEFENCE OF CATULLUS' DIRTY SPARROW 171 great F. Scott Fitzgerald'? At any rate, in the case of this poem we must decide if Martial settled for a compliment that was clumsy and forced because of an historical falsification, or else wrote a sophisticated, literary joke. If it is to be objected to the above interpretation that the same intimacy is implied between Martial and Silius Italicus as is implied for Catullus and the young Virgil, then the bantering nature of the humour in these epigrams has been misunderstood. This becomes especially clear from the two poems, 1.7 and 7.14, which are linked both to Catullus' passer poems and to Martial's patron L. Arruntius Stella. It is, first of all, obvious that Stella wrote a poem about the death of his wife's dove in imitation of Catullus 3. This is stated in the first 3 lines of Martial 1.7: Stellae delicium mei columba Verona licet audiente dicam, vicit, Maxime, passerem Catulli. - an obvious parody of the opening of the first passer poem. The fact is stated again in 7.14, wherein Martial sings of a woman of his acquaintance who has lost delicias not of the paltry type over which lamented Catullus' Lesbia, vel Stellae cantata meo quas flevit Ianthis, cuius in Elysio nigra columba volat... Ianthis being Martial's name for Violentilla, the wife of his patron. That Stella should have transferred Catullus' theme from a sparrow to a doJe is not at all surprising, for we have seen the two birds linked together both by Pliny the Elder (Nat. Hist. 10.52.107) and by Apuleius (Met. 6.6). Indeed Pliny's nephew referred to his own lusus and ineptiae as passerculi et columbuli (9.25.2 and 3), their bantering nature being quite evident from the sample he supplies at 7.4.6. We do not have to agree with Wheeler's contention that these proposed titles were sug- gested by the respective poetry books of Catullus and Stella36 to recognize the natural association of these love birds and the erotic nature of this kind of poetry. That Stella meant the same thing by his columba as Catullus had meant by his sparrow follows inevitably from the argument of 7.14. How remarks ad loc. that this conclusion 'looks too good to be true, in view of the final joke', a qualification resulting, I think, from failing to see the logical progression of the poem. Picking up the poem where we left off above, Martial continues:</page><page sequence="11">172 IN DEFENCE OF CATULLUS' DIRTY SPARROW lux mea non capitur nugis neque moribus istis nec dominae pectus talia damna movent: bis senos puerum numerantem perdidit annos, mentula cui nondum sesquipedalis erat. Martial's girl, he says, does not waste tears over the loss of something as inconsequential as a sparrow or a dove, but rather - and here we would expect as a conclusion to see her dearly departed slave boy put in opposition to the two silly pets. Instead of that, however, Martial goes on to show that the dearly departed is the slave boy's mentula which had not yet reached its allotted length of one and a half feet! The progression has not been from sparrow to dove to human being, but rather from 5 inches to 10 inches to 18 inches! And that, of course, is precisely the same point made at the conclusion of 1.7: tanto Stella meus tuo Catullo quanto passere maior est columba. 'My Stella is as much greater than your Catullus as his dove is bigger than Catullus' sparrow.' Once having recognized this interpretation we return inevitably to the uncomfortable feeling, already mentioned in relation to 4.14, that we are watching these poets air their scandalous linen in public. Martial seems to be joking about sodomizing Silius Italicus while Stella, if he wrote a poem about his wife's grief at the death of her dove, has admitted publically his own impotence! Rather than attempt to argue this difficulty away, we should accept it as an inevitable ingredient of this kind of poetry. It does seem to have bothered Pliny the Prude, who saw fit to quote Catullus 16.5-8 in a letter to a relative about his hendecasyllabi, just as he attempted to exculpate himself from the appro- brium of indulging in his versiculos severos parum by ticking off a long list of illustrious predecessors (5.3.5). In the poem to which we referred above Pliny traces his inspiration to the great Cicero himself, who wrote an epigram about stealing kisses from the faithful Tiro. 'Cur post haec,' sings Pliny, 'nostros celamus amores... ?' (7.4.6 line 10) - a sentiment which both Catullus and Stella apparently shared. As Peter How remarks, If Stella had composed jocular epigrams on the size and decline of his own mentula, just as Catullus had done, there was no reason why Martial should have deemed it necessary to keep quiet about them ... such epigrams were intended for public circulation as jocular pieces.37 In the case of Martial 1.109 we have the advantage of a 'scientific control' - a real epitaph from the Roman equivalent of a Beverly Hills Pet Cemetery about a real dog named Myia. It has already been men- tioned in connection with the text of Catullus 3.16:</page><page sequence="12">IN DEFENCE OF CATULLUS' DIRTY SPARROW 173 quam dulcis fuit ista, quam benigna quae cum viveret in sinu iacebat somni conscia semper et cubilis. o factum male, Myia, quod peristi. latrares modo, si quis adcubaret rivalis dominae, licentiosa: o factum male, Myia, quod peristi. altum iam tenet insciam sepulcrum, nec saevire putes nec insilire, nec blandis mihi morsibus renides. This is a particularly useful control, for the dependence on Catullus is obvious. The in sinu iacebat occupies the same position in the line as Catullus' in sinu tenere (2.2) and the blandis ... morsibus of the last line owes as much to the acris ... morsus of Cat. 2.4 as to Myia's temperament. Nonetheless the picture which emerges is completely consistent. Although sparrows do not snuggle up to bosoms lapdogs do; they also bark, nibble, and act jealous of their mistresses. When we turn to the more sophisticated world of Martial, however, no such realistically consistent picture emerges. Martial reminds us of Catullus in the first line: Issa est passere nequior Catulli and of Stella in the second: Issa est purior osculo columbae, but his poem suffers from inconsistency as the result of this contaminatio. How can the dog be naughtier than one and purer than the other? Are we supposed to take an average? Further on the purior image is strangely developed: castae tantus inest pudor catellae, ignorat Venerem; nec invenimus dignum tam tenera virum puella. First of all, castus is never applied to an animal except, of course, to sacrificial victims.38 Even the exemplary Myia was not said to be ignorant of Venus - a most unusual complement for a bitch; and the sudden anthropomorphism of catella into puella and of her intended catellus into vir comes as a complete surprise. I am sure the reader has anticipated my solution to these problems, but let us look a bit further before stating it. At 2.57.3 Martial refers again to his friend Publius - this time in terms that make it clear the fellow was a fop. Furthermore in epigram 10.98 Martial is irritated that Publius' minister is Idaeo resolutior cinaedo, more elegant indeed than Publius' wife, daughter, mother, and sister combined. As he warns his friend at the end of the poem: Perdet te dolor hic: habere, Publi, mores non potes hos et hos ministros. Publius seems a lot like his little dog Issa. The implied relationship with his minister / cinaedus shows that he is passere nequior Catulli</page><page sequence="13">174 IN DEFENCE OF CATULLUS' DIRTY SPARROW while, at least as far as women are concerned, he is purior osculo columbae. Assuming, as is often the case, that his wife and daughter are so much window dressing, Publius undoubtedly is as ignorant of Aphrodite as he is familiar with Eros. Mario Citroni has already sensed something going on behind the picture of Issa: Marziale ha sentito l'allusivita erotica dei giochi del passero catulliano (colombi, passeri, ecc., rientravano comunemente in un gioco di simologia erotica.. .): Issa non e da meno. 39 It is, however, necessary to state openly what Citroni seems only to hint at: In writing 1.109 Martial has not only imitated the theme of Cat. 2, he has also adapted its double entendre by having the dog Issa stand for the phallus of Publius. There are, of course, differences. For the first time the animal does not stand for the phallus of the poet, and the allegory is not maintained throughout the poem. The dog Issa certainly existed - the dog's name, a form ipsa implying 'mistress',40 is perfect, and the dog is referred to again at 7.87 - and the double entendre is most effective in lines 1-4, where the identity of Issa is tantalizingly withheld. In Greek KVwv could of course take on the extended meaning 'phal- lus', just as K;vva dvacUTv meant 'to have an erection'. Theodor Hopfner links the obscene meaning of both sparrow and dog, saying that they arise 'wegen der bekannten Geilheit dieser Tiere'.41 Besides the entry in Hesychius, the clearest evidence of dog's secondary meaning is Marcus Argentarius' unflattering portrait of the whore Menophile, A.P. 5.105, where the last line makes an obvious reference to fellatio: AAAog ' MqjvoplAas AyE'yETaL apa iaxAdaU KOU/LOS , &amp;AAo0 97TEL '7Tcflg 7EyVETa daKpaau7s. dAA'"TE XaAXaLot, KE(Vr)S r7TEAag. 1j yap O TaT7)S otpav EvTOS EV XL KatL KVa KLat Vss1tOUVg. Vincens Buchheit has furthermore seized upon this double meaning of KVwv as an explanation for the inclusion of the otherwise uncharac- teristically bucolic poem 62 among the Priapea: Securi dormite, canes: custodiet hortum cum sibi dilecta Sirius Erigone.42 As a further instance of dog symbolizing phallus we have an amazing tintinnabulum found in Pompeii. It depicts a gladiator hacking away at his own huge phallus, the head of which snarls back at him in the shape of a dog.43 By this time a consistency of double meaning has emerged both in the sparrow poems of Catullus and in the cycle of their imitations by</page><page sequence="14">IN DEFENCE OF CATULLUS' DIRTY SPARROW 175 Martial. Indeed, Martial has so expanded on the double meaning that its original force can no longer, I think, seriously be doubted. For the venustiores, the people 'in the know', passer meant phallus just as surely as basium meant kiss, and for Catullus the use of a double entendre was as stylish as diminutives or compound adjectives. This sophisti- cated badinage seems to have gone over the head of Statius, and it certainly made no impression upon Myia's amateur panegyrist. In the case of Ovid, however, we should not be so sure and in retrospect may even suggest that he anticipated the joke of Martial 1.7. Compared with the sparrow the parrot is, after all, a considerably bigger bird. NOTES 1. See Julia Haig Gaisser, TAPA 112 (1982), 102-3, where the relevant sixth chapter of Poliziano's Miscellanea (1489) is quoted and discussed. 2. Jocelyn, AJP 101 (1980), 421-41, hereafter cited as Jocelyn; Genovese, Maia 26 (1974), 121-5, hereafter Genovese; Giangrande, Museum Philologum Londiniense 1 (1976), 137-46, here- after Giangrande. Jocelyn provides a useful summary of scholarly interpretations of Catullus' bird on pp. 422-6, to which should be added the generally sympathetic remarks of Peter Howell, A Commentary on Book One of the Epigrams of Martial (London, 1980), to which Professor Giangrande has contributed two pages of commentary (pp. 122-3), considerably less extravagant in their claims than his above cited article. Kenneth Quinn, Catullus an Interpretation (London, 1972), p. 85 has called the obscene interpretation of these poems 'a persistent minority opinion', but goes on to say: 'One cannot rule that component of meaning out entirely; Catullus, perhaps, was not displeased if it added a hint of mockery to two complex poems. But I doubt if it is an important component: Poems 2 and 3 were hardly written to perpetrate a double entendre.' Such a statement differs only in degree from the position of this paper. As an indication of the popularity of Poliziano's theory throughout the Renaissance I can also point out George Gascoigne's lyric 'Philip My Sparrow' set to music in 1606 by the Elizabethan lutenist John Bartlet. See Noah Greenberg, An Elizabethan Song Book (New York, 1955), p. 10. 3. Genovese, pp. 123-5. 4. Giangrande, pp. 145-6 and 140-4. Jocelyn disposes of Giangrande's interpretation of the Atalanta myth quite effectively, pp. 430-3. 5. A comparison with Martial 11.6 is the only evidence offered by Poliziano. See Gaisser (n. 1). 6. These were collected in the seventh book of the Anthology (189-216). The standard study is G. Herrlinger, Totenklage um Tiere (Stuttgart, 1930), especially pp. 39-51. 7. Havelock, The Lyric Genius of Catullus (New York, 1929), p. 147; Fordyce, Catullus, a Commentary (Oxford, 1973), p. 88. Fordyce prefers to think of the passer in the poem as the blue rock-thrush, Montisola solitarius, which he said is still commonly called passero in Italy. Jocelyn lets that remark pass without comment, though Giangrande's remark (p. 137) that passero and pipere have obscene connotations in modem Italian brings the stinging remark (p. 426) that 'Native English speakers could cite similar and similarly irrelevant items from the coarser registers of their language'. 8. Frequently cited is Apuleius Met. 8.15 which describes the moving of a household: gerebamus infantulos et mulieres, gerebamus pullos, passeres, aedos, catellos ... Given its late, post- Catullan date, however, such a passage should be thought of as life imitating art. In a similar fashion countless Americans were willing to invest thousands of dollars in a sulphur crested cockatoo after the success of Robert Blake's 'Baretta' series on television. The animals in the Anthology, unlike sparrows (and like cockatoos, by the way), do make delightful pets. That is even true of caged crickets which, one is reminded, were kept by the Okinawans in John Patrick's play The Teahouse of the August Moon (New York, 1952), pp. 45-6. 9. E. A.

The Festus quote was noted as early as Voss's commentary (Utrecht, 1691), p. 6, and is also cited by Genovese, pp. 121-2. Jocelyn (p. 426 n. 33) passes it over without any real consideration, merely remarking (p. 427) that 'there is no Latin evidence at all of the alleged usage'. 11. Rudd, TAPA 90 (1959), 238-42; Richardson, CP 58 (1963), 101, concerning which point Vincent J. Rosivach, TAPA 108 (1978), 214 n. 57, remarked: 'Richardson does not prove his case, but to my mind he does present enough evidence that the possibility must be left open.' For the article by Maxwell-Stuart, Hermes 100 (1972), 222, see the remarks in Felix Buffiere, Eros adolescent: la peddrastie dans la Grace antique (Paris, 1980), pp. 316-17 n. 95. Buffiere sounds much like Jocelyn in rejecting Maxwell-Stuart's theory - 'Libre a chacun de donner des poetes un exegese "allegorique"' - but with more justification, for book rolls lack the literary tradition of 'slaciousness' long associated with sparrows. 12. Jocelyn, pp. 427-8. In making this citation I fulfill Jocelyn's fear that he may be 'supplying ammunition for untrustworthy hands'. 13. The first two are by Merrill, Catullus, p. xxvii, and J. Wight Duff, A Literary History of Rome (New York, 1960), p. 236; the next by Voss (above, n. 10), p. 6. 14. The always perceptive Dorothy Parker offers an interesting corroboration of Voss's viewpoint in the following lines written, as far as I know, without knowledge of Poliziano's theory: That thing he wrote, the time the sparrow died - (Oh, most unpleasant - gloomy, tedious words!) I called it sweet, and made believe I cried; That stupid fool! I've always hated birds... 'From a Letter From Lesbia', The Viking Portable Library Dorothy Parker (New York, 1944), p. 452. 15. Most keep silent about the possibility, which is the least embarrassing solution. Of those that deal with the problem, we have already seen Voss's reaction to the traditional, literalist interpretation that would have Catullus consoling himself over Lesbia's heartlessness by playing with a pet sparrow. M. Lenchantin de Gubernatis in his commentary (Torino, 1928) at least takes the bull by the horns when he says, 'Non mette conto di ricordare che il Poliziano ed altri umanisti nel passer volevano trovare un'allusione che il v. 9 sg. esclude'. Giangrande (pp. 144-5) counters by saying that, on the contrary, it is these very lines which make his interpretation work. 16. See Jocelyn, p. 422 n. 5, who attributes this solution to Alessandro Guarini (Venice, 1520). It has been followed most recently by D. F. S. Thomson in his critical edition (Chapel Hill, 1978) and was also taken up by Kroll (Berlin, 1923), Mynors (Oxford, 1958), and Fordyce (Oxford, 1973). Merrill (Cambridge, 1893) and Ellis (Oxford, 1904) indicate a lacuna after 2.10. Baehrens (Leipzig, 1876) followed the manuscripts in printing 2 as a unit. 17. Voss (above, n. 10), p. 7; Quinn, Catullus, The Poems (New York, 1970), p. 95. 18. This is certainly preferable to the tortuous double negative developed by Giangrande (pp. 145-6): 'I wish I could, but I cannot (possem) indulge in masturbation: I cannot, because such a practice is just as agreeable to me (tam gratumst) as was the apple to Atalanta, which caused her to lose the race, wherefore she had to abandon her beloved unnatural practices and endure the fututiones which she hated.' This interpretation has been most effectively dismantled by Jocelyn, pp. 430-3. 19. Voss, p. 7 and Jocelyn, p. 426 n. 34 and p. 427. The emendation bracchica mala at Priap. 72.4 offered up as evidence for the obscene sense of malum is clearly weak: it is not included in the Biicheler-Heraeus edition of the Priapea (Berlin, 1912), and is rejected by Richard Clairmont in his recent critical edition (Diss. Loyola University of Chicago, 1983) for the manuscripts' bracchia macra, which is clearly meant to balance grandia mala. 20. Thus Giangrande, p. 140, with which cf. Jocelyn, p. 434 n. 71. Voss, p. 8 was the first openly to state this sexual interpretation of Catullus 3: Nihilominus flagitiosum est hoc carmen quam praecedens. Non me fugit viros eruditos longe aliter sentire, et credere nihil hic esse quod non castissimae matronae mitti possit, sed vero si existimemus Catullum confectum et exhaustum lucta venerea et funerata, ut cum Petronio loquar, ea parte quae virum facit, Lesbiae suae hoc epigramma scripsisse, tanto utique plus leporis hoc versiculos habituros existimo, quanto fuerint nequiores. Et sane quid passeri cum gremio puellae, si nihil dictu turpe hic subintelligi debeat? For parallels with the lament over a dead pet, see Herrlinger, above, n. 6. Both Jocelyn and</page><page sequence="16">IN DEFENCE OF CATULLUS' DIRTY SPARROW 177 Giangrande give several parallels for lamented impotence, from which lists Ovid Am. 3.7 and Priap. 83 should especially be stressed. 21. Havelock (above, n. 7), p. 20. Giangrande's interpretation of hominum venustiorum as 'men luckier in love than Catullus' (see, pp. 141-5) is strange and forced, and has been well disposed of by Jocelyn, pp. 434-9. 22. Style and Tradition in Catullus (Cambridge, 1969), p. 106. Mr Ross discusses 'Urbanitas and the vocabulary of the Polymetrics' at length, pp. 104-12. 23. Ibid. p. 105. 24.

The manuscripts read bonum factum male bonus ille passer, which was corrected to o factum male o miselle passer under the influence of Cicero, Att. 15.1.1: o factum male de Alexione ... Among the commentators, Kroll, Fordyce, Mynors, and Thomson (see above, n. 16) print o factum male! o miselle passer! although Thomson does mention Goold's emendation in his appendix. Baehrens and Merrill adopt Lachmann's emendation o factum male! io miselle passer, while Ellis goes out on a limb with vae factum male! vae miselle passer! The double o is almost universally admired, and indeed O. Skutsch in his review of Goold's edition of Catullus in CP 69 (1974), 126-7 says the proposed reading' ... seems to me to deflate the pathos of the passage'. In support of the favourite reading I can cite Priap. 83.19, in a context virtually identical to the one we are suggesting for Catullus 3: at o sceleste penis, o meum malum. I can also point out a similar passage in Tymnes' lament for his dead songbird (A.P. 7.199.1-2): OpvEov G Xaptatv /tE/LEA7/L/EVov, w 7rapo/Lotov aAKv'oaLv aroy UOV POyyOV lWaoa/LEvov. For the first half of his article Goold attacks the possibility of a hiatus in Catullus such as the proposed line contains; he then demonstrates most skillfully that the two o's usually proposed at Catullus 3.16 do not present a balance, as can indeed be found in the two parallels I have suggested above, but rather prevent one, for the two halves in the Catullan line are not equal. The corrupt text would translate, 'O calamity, o sparrow, you have made me weep', which wrongly separates the sense of sparrow and you. Goold's final citation of Carm. Epig. 1512 Biich., a real inscription and an obvious imitation of Catullus 3, with its line o factum male, Myia, quod peristi is, I think, conclusive, despite O. Skutsch's objection that the proposed vocative after quod is not paralleled. 27. Cf. Tib. 2.2.15-16, Prop. 3.13.5-15, and pseudo-Tib. 3.8.20. 28. Fordyce (above, n. 7), p. 92. 29. See above, n. 1. 30. For the very popular theory that a collection of poems by Catullus called the Passer was in circulation, see Arthur Leslie Wheeler, Catullus and the Traditions of Ancient Poetry (Berkley, 1964), pp. 19-20, 21, and n. 24 p. 251; Havelock (above, n. 7), pp. 185 n. 3 and 187 n. 28; Quinn (above, n. 2), p. 13; Voss (above, n. 10), pp. 5-6, who traces the theory to Parthenius and suggests its popularity is due to the fact that it offers the only alternative to an obscene interpretation of the lines under discussion! See also Jocelyn, p. 424, who cites T. Birt, Das antike Buchwesen (Berlin, 1882), p. 407. 31. For a convenient discussion of these problems, see Fordyce (above, n. 7), pp. 409-10. 32. Poliziano obviously thought so as well, for in Misc. 6 he misquotes Martial to read 'Da mihi basia, sed Catulliana', which of course, intentionally or unintentionally, makes the connection with Catullus 5.7 more obvious.
