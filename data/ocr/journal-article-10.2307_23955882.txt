Ontological Relativity Revisited Jacques Derrida's essay 'The Supplement of Copula' contains some of the most detailed and convincing anii-relativist arguments to be found anywhere in the recent philosophie literature. (') I have stated the case thus baldly — and italicized the crucial prefix — since my claim is likely to conjure scepticism (or outright disbelief) among many readers. After all, it is well known that Derrida espouses an extreme version of the current Nietzschean/poststructuralist doxa according to which 'truth' and 'reality' are wholly linguistic (or textual) constructs. Moreover we have it on good authority — not only from hostile sources but also from admiring commentators such as Richard Rorty — that Derrida subscribes to a range of kindred anti realist and cultural-relativist beliefs. (2) On a quick reckoning these include: (1) the Nietzsche-inspired thesis that 'ail concepts are subli mated metaphors', ail truth-claims a species of rhetorical imposition; (1) Jacques Derrida, 'The Supplement of Copula', in Margins of Philosophy, trans.

No matter that Derrida has gone out of his way to reject or disown items (1) to (5) above — along with a range of kindred idées reçues — as bearing not the least resemblance to anything he has written during three decades of immensely productive authorship. (3) No matter that they owe more to hearsay than to first-hand acquaintance with his texts, having gained currency chiefly through the influence of Rorty's oft-cited essay 'Philosophy as a Kind of Writing'. (4) For this is what many Anglo-American philosophers want to think about Derrida, representing as he does a convenient target in the current round of renewed inter-faculty ('philosophy versus literary theory') and intercultural ('analytic' versus 'continental') sectarian strife. My main purpose here is to challenge this widespread and damaging misperception of Derrida's work. But I shall also argue that certain of his texts — notably 'The Supplement of Copula' and 'White Mythology' — have a strong and distinctive contribution to make in the context of recent analytical debate. More specifically : they offer an alternative approach to issues of truth, meaning, and interprétation that have driven some philosophers — Stephen Schiffer among them — to despair of achieving any further constructive advance. (5) Then again there is Donald Davidson's conspicuous retreat from a truth (3) See for instance Derrida, 'Afterword: toward an ethic of discussion', in Limited lnc (2nd edn., ed. Gerald Graff, Evanston, 111. : Northwestern University Press, 1989) ; also 'Letter to a Japanese Friend', trans.

(6) Thus, according to Davidson, there is 'no such thing as a language' if by 'language' is meant what philosophers and linguists have usually understood by that term. And there is no such thing as defining the conditions for adequate intra- or inter-linguistic understanding if those conditions are thought to entail something more than a localized, chance convergence on some 'theory' arrived at by intuitive guess work. Davidson nevertheless remains quite sanguine about the prospects for our everyday, practica! communicative grasp, in contrast to Schiffer who is hard put to explain why his argument is neither 'defeatist' nor 'despairing'. At any rate they both now occupy the sort of 'post-analytic' position that Rorty can welcome as yet another pointer to philosophy's decently scaled-down rôle in the 'cultural conversation of mankind'. (7) Moreover, they are united in no longer seeing any hope for a strong truth-conditional theory — in Schiffer's case, a theory of intention-based propositional semantics — that would counter the sceptical-relativist trend. It is against this background of failed endeavour in a certain branch of the analytic enterprise (more specifically: of logical empiricism and various successor movements) that I shall here focus on Derrida's approach to a range of kindred topics. Of course I am not the first to attempt such a bridge-building exercise. There are, for instance, well-versed commentators who perceive a close affinity between Derrida's treat ment of issues in Austinian speech-act theory and Davidson's late (6) Donald Davidson, Inquiries into Truth and Interpretation (Oxford : Clarendon Press, 1984); Ά Nice Dérangement of Epitaphs', in Ernest Lepore (ed.), Truth and Interpretation', perspectives on the work of Donald Davidson (Oxford: Blackwell, 1986), pp. 433-46.

(8) Thus they have each come around — so the argument runs — to a broadly pragmatic or holistic view according to which there can exist no necessary and sufficient criteria — much less any generalized theo ry — as regards what shall count as a proper intention or a validating context for genuine ('felicitous') speech-act utterance. On this view there is no great différence between Derrida's talk of speech-act 'iterability' — the capacity of performatives to function across a vast (potentially limitless) range of contexts — and Davidson's notion of 'passing theories' as likewise all that is required in order to explain how people manage to communicate from one context to the next. (9) However, the purpose of these comparisons is usually to argue for the kind of entente cordiale that would bring Derrida out on the side of recent developments in 'post-analytic' philosophy. That is to say, they would treat him as having travelled much the same path — and to much the same sceptical terminus — as thinkers like Davidson and Schiffer. It seems to me that this gets Derrida wrong as regards both his reading of Austin and his général approach to issues in the area of truth, meaning, and interprétation. Worst of ail it ignores what his work has to offer by way of counter-argument to the presently wide spread cultural-relativist trend. II. Derrida on Benveniste In 'The Supplement of Copula' Derrida takes issue with some claims advanced by the linguist Emile Benveniste concerning Aristotle's doctrine of the catégories or modes of predicative judge ment. (10) According to Benveniste these had their origin in a certain natural language (the ancient Greek) whose lexical resources and grammatical structures are everywhere drawn upon in Aristotle's (8) See for instance Shekhar Pradhan, 'Minimalist Semantics : Davidson and Derrida on meaning, use, and convention', Diacritics, Vol. 16, No. 1 (1986), pp. 66-77 ; Samuel C. Wheeler, 'Indeterminacy of French Translation : Derrida and Davidson', in Lepore, Truth and. Interpretation (op. cit.), pp. 477-94. (9) Derrida, Limited Inc (op. cit.).

(") Thus: 'Aristotle, reasoning in the absolute, is simply identifying certain fundamental catégories of the language in which he thought'. (12) And the same would apply to those thinkers after Aristotle (Kant among them) who criticized his table of the catégories but who sought to overcome its limitations through a further, more rigorous exercise of reason. For in their case also, as Benveniste contends, there is a failure to grasp that any such claim must rest upon this unconscious transfer of attributes from language to the putative laws of thought or a priori conditions for valid reasoning. Nor is it in any way remarkable that this certain 'small document' (Benveniste's phrase) concerning the catégories should have come to exert such an influence not only on later philosophical thought but across a wide range of cognate disciplines, linguistics and philology included. For those disciplines have themselves grown up within the matrix of various natural languages that exhibit a close kinship with the ancient Greek in respect of both their lexico-grammatical structures and — as follows necessarily on Benveniste's account — their associated range of logico-semantic or predicative functions. Thus: 'while granting absolutely that thought cannot be grasped except as formed and made a reality in language, have we any means to recognize in thought such characteristics as would belong to it alone and owe nothing to linguistic expression ?' (13) For Benveniste this question is purely rhetorical since it posits a thesis (the existence of language independent structures of thought) whose impossibility is granted in the opening clause. After all, such a thesis would have to be expressed — to achieve articulate form — in one or another natural language whose surface (grammatical) features were assumed to reflect, embody, or exemplify its deeper (logical) structure. But there could then be no possible argument to establish the priority of 'thought' over 'language', or as Benveniste tends to view the issue — of 'philosophy' over 'linguistics'. For such an argument would always be constrained to ignore the fact of its own dependence upon language as the precondi tion for expressing any claim whatsoever with regard to this thesis. (11) The passages of Aristotle here referred to are to be found in the Catégories, Chapter Four and Metaphysics, Chapter Six. (12) Benveniste, Problems (op. cit.), p. 57. (13) Ibid., p. 56.</page><page sequence="6">416 CHRISTOPHER NORRIS Rather than summarize Derrida's lengthy and complex response, I shall begin by examining one crucial passage from 'The Supplement of Copula'. It is devoted to a single sentence in Benveniste's text, the only place — so Derrida maintains — where the issue cornes clearly (if not perhaps consciously) into focus. This question of conscious ness is crucial to his argument since it is Benveniste's claim that Aristotle, in his treatment of the catégories, was unconscious of the fact that these supposedly absolute (non-language-relative) necessities of thought were themselves the product of a merely contingent, 'empirical' set of lexico-grammatical constraints pertaining to the Greek language. Thus Benveniste : 'Unconsciously he [Aristotle] took as a criterion the empirical necessity of a distinct expression for each of his prédications'. (14) But what can 'empirical' mean here? Derrida asks. 'Taken literally, this explanation would suppose that Aristotle, having at his disposition, moreover, and outside of language, pre dicates, or conceivable classes of predicates, and faced with the empirical necessity of expressing these contents, ... confused the distinction of predicates and the distinction of expressions'. ('Supplement of Copula', p. 190) In short Benveniste is here invoking a range of categorical distinc tions, as between 'empirical' and 'conceivable' orders of thought, or natural-language expressions on the one hand and, on the other, those classes of predicates 'outside of language' whose very possibility he seeks to deny. Thus : Is it not stränge to qualify as empirical the necessity of an expression, the necessity to bring the conceivable to Statement in a given lan guage? In the last analysis, the value of empiricity has never been related to anything but the variability of sensory and individual givens, and by extension to every passivity or activity without concept. ... Above ail, how can one affirm the empiricity of the movement which leads to signifying in général and to signifying within a language, and that does so with recourse to an Organization of forms, a distribution of classes, etc. ? Finally, on the basis of what system, and also from whence historically, do we receive and under stand — before even positing the empiricity of signification — the signification of empiricity? On this matter no analysis will either (14) Ibid., p. 61</page><page sequence="7">DECONSTRUCTION, ONTOLOGY, AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE : DERRIDA ON ARISTOTLE 417 circumvent or exclude the tribunal of Aristotelianism. This does not imply that Aristotle is the author or origin of the concept of empiri city, even if the opposition of the empirical and the theoretical (the a priori, the scientific, the objective, the systematic, etc.) in one way or another envelops Aristotle's metaphysics. Even if such a concept is not fixed once and for all in an 'origin', one cannot comprehend the history and system of its mutations or transformations without taking into account the général code of metaphysics, and within this code, the decisive mark of Aristotelianism. (p. 192) This passage evokes a whole range of related issues within current analytic (or 'post-analytic') philosophy, issues which have Struck some commentators (Schiffer among them) as beyond hope of adequate treatment. (I5) It also exemplifies the distinctive mode of transcendental argument — reasoning from the conditions of possi bility for thought about truth, meaning, and interprétation — that plays such a prominent rôle in Derrida's earlier writings. ()6) Thus my aim in what follows is to suggest a more promising way forward from the post-analytical fix to which, as it seems, the only solutions are either (1) an all-but avowedly 'defeatist' outlook like Schiffer's, (2) the Davidsonian recourse to meaning-holism or minimalist semantics as a 'theory to end ail theories', or (3) a Rortian neopragmatist approach that cornes out (supposedly) on the far side of ail that misguided 'metaphysical' or truth-fixated talk. At least there is a case for suspending those habits of ingrained prejudice that have so far prevented most analytic philosophers from attending seriously to Derrida's work. I shall now return to the above-cited passage from 'The Supplement of Copula' where Derrida examines the difficulties encountered with Benveniste's reading of Aristotle. For that passage has an obvious bearing on the problems of logical empiricism and the subséquent his tory of likewise problematical attempts to escape such an overly rigid dualism of empirical matters-of-fact on the one hand and conceptual truths-of-reason on the other. This history is familiar enough, from (15) Schiffer, Remnants of Meaning (op. cit.); see also Rorty, Conséquences of Pragmatism and other citations in note 7, above. (16) On this aspect of Derrida's work see especially Rodolphe Gasché, The Tain ofthe Mirror : Derrida and the philosophy of reflection (Cambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1986).</page><page sequence="8">418 CHRISTOPHER NORRIS Quine's 'Two Dogmas of Empiricism' to the various present-day schools of thought which endorse ontological relativity and meaning holism as the only means of avoiding that particular philosophical dead-end. (I7) And from here it is a short distance to those post-analyt ical viewpoints — whether sadly disillusioned like Schiffer's or vaguely hopeful like Davidson's — which give up the attempt to spec ify truth-conditions or criteria for meaningful utterance beyond those provided by a pragmatist appeal to what is 'good in the way of belief'. That Schiffer still professes to find this outcome deeply disturbing bears witness more to the strength of his residual analytic attachment than to anything in his theory — or what little now remains of it — that could offer a genuine or workable alternative. Hence Rorty's con fident prédiction that all these thinkers must at last corne around to a pragmatist view of philosophy's rôle as just one more (strictly non privileged) participant voice in the 'cultural conversation of mankind'. Derrida is often cited — by disciples and detractors alike — as a thinker who has pushed a long way in the direction of mininalist semantics, meaning-holism, ontological relativity, and suchlike (cur rently fashionable) doctrines. (18) However the above passage should be enough to discountenance any reading of his work that entertains this mistaken view. What it brings out very clearly is Derrida's refusai of that reductive logical-empiricist approach together with the various alternatives proposed by post-analytical philosophers. Thus when (17) W.V.

It is best understood in connection with his other main points about the relationship between 'conscious' and 'unconscious' elements in the discourse of (or on) philosophy and the 'value of empiricity' as that which 'has never been related to anything but the variability of sensory and individual givens, and by extension to every passivity or activity without concept'. ('Supplement of Copula', p. 192) For it is precisely this latter assump tion that finds its most dogmatic (uncritical) expression in the doctrine of logical empiricism, i.e. the intransigent dichotomy between truths-of-fact or matters of observational warrant and truths of-reason or those whose validity is a matter of purely definitional (analytic) self-evidence. And this connects in turn with Benveniste's charge against Aristotle: that he remained 'unconcious' of those empirical elements in his own thinking — namely the contingent lexico-grammatical resources of the Greek language — which he mistook for categorical necessities pertaining to language and thought in général. Thus, according to Benveniste, 'unconsciously and without wanting to, he [Aristotle] has taken the "class of forms", such as the system of language offers it, for the system of the expressed or the expressible'. ('Supplement of Copula', p. 190) But as Derrida shows this charge applies more aptly to Benveniste himself, resorting as he does — at whatever 'unconscious' or involuntary level — to various strictly categorical distinctions (like those between thought and language, conscious and unconscious, the conceptual and the empiri cal, the 'distinction of predicates' and the 'distinction of expressions') without which he could not have advanced a single proposition on this topic. Ail of which suggests that there is 'in the practice of a lan guage, in the belonging to a language, a structural necessity for this 'unconscious' to be produced, such that what is pointed out in Aristotle would be but the confirmation of the général law of uncon sciousness'. (p. 190) As should hardly need saying this 'unconsciousness' has nothing to do with a Freudian or depth-psychological account of sublimated motives and desires. It is a 'structural necessity' in the Kantian sense that the conditions of possibility for knowledge — both for self knowledge and epistemological enquiry — are such as must always</page><page sequence="10">420 CHRISTOPHER NORR1S remain in some degree opaque or résistant to the philosophie quest for clear and distinct ideas. Indeed, some of Derrida's most closely argued analytical work — including his several early books on Husserl — is devoted to uncovering the blind-spots, the structural limits or aporias encountered by philosophy in its repeated attempts to make good on that Cartesian ambition. (19) But this does not lead him, as it does Rorty, to dismiss the entire enterprise as an ultimately failed or useless endeavour, a project hung up on certain otiose metaphors — like the mind as a 'mirror of nature' — which philo sophers have taken as a pretext for vainly attempting to explain how it is that our language 'matches up' with the world through this or that currently favoured candidate-theory. (20) On the contrary, Derrida insists: such notions of simply 'turning the page' on philo sophy as hitherto practised always amount to just 'philosophizing badly' or in ignorance of questions — such as those raised in Benveniste's reading of Aristotle — whose out-of-hand dismissal opens the way to all manner of naive or uncritical prejudice. (21) (One is reminded of J.M. Keynes' canny remark that those who profess to have no 'theory' are usually working on a bad old theory which they can't or won't acknowledge.) For there is a différence — a crucial différence — between that order of 'structural' unconsciousness which attends even the most critical or reflective exercise of thought and, on the other hand, that demonstrable lack of awareness (the phrase seems more appropriate here) which leads Benveniste to charge Aristotle with 'unconsciously' mistaking some empirical facts about the Greek language for categorical necessities of thought. As Derrida puts it : '[i]f one wished to use the word 'empirical' in a sense totally foreign to Aristotle's, or to its sense in the history of philo sophy, one explicitly would have to undertake the labour of this trans formation. Nothing in Benveniste's text signais or announces such a displacement'. ('Supplement of Copula', p. 192) Derrida's point is that the word 'empirical' cannot be used in a (19) Derrida, 'Speech and Phenomena' and Other Essays on Husserl's Theory of Signs, trans. David B.

What is none the less possible, Derrida suggests, is a certain specific 'labour of transformation' through which empiricism may acquire a différent, perhaps a more productive (causal or depth explanatory) yield, and through which those catégories may them selves be subject to a process of ongoing criticism, refinement, and modification. It is precisely this possibility that Derrida explores in some pages of his essay 'White Mythology : metaphor in the text of philosophy' devoted to Canguilhem's and Bachelard's work on the rôle of metaphor in scientific discourse and its 'rectification' by way of more advanced (conceptual and empirical) research. (22) Nothing could be further from the Rortian idea that science — like philosophy — cornes down to just a sériés of Optative metaphors or periodic shifts in the kinds of language-game that set the agenda for current debate. (23) It might seem merely perverse on my part to present Derrida as a transcendental realist, one who cornes out in agreement with philo sophers of science like Roy Bhaskar in seeking to maintain the vital distinction between ontological and epistemological issues. (24) In fact one could instance quite a number of passages, especially from recent interviews, where Derrida protests against the widespread misreading of his work that has taken certain sentences out of context (most notoriously, 'il n'y a pas de hors-texte' : 'there is no "outside" to the text') and used them to portray him as some sort of fargone trans cendental idealist. (25) Still it might be said that these passages are part of a rearguard defensive campaign and should therefore not be granted any special credence merely on account of their outraged tone. More to the point is the evidence of those earlier texts — 'White (22) Derrida, 'White Mythology : metaphor in the text of philosophy', in Margins of Philosophy (op. cit.), pp. 207-71. (23) Rorty, 'Science as Solidarity', 'Is Natural Science a Natural Kind?', and 'Texts and Lumps', in Objectivity, Relativism, and Truth {op. cit.), pp. 35-45, 46-62 and 78-92.

What they bring out rather is the impossibility (the 'rigorous and principled' impossibility) of relativizing thought to language as Benveniste would have it, or of treating concepts — scientific or philosophical concepts — as so many repressed, forgotten, or sublimated metaphors, entirely on a par as regards their delusory truth-content. Thus there is simply no way that the relativist case can be pro pounded without running into the kinds of performative and logical contradiction that Derrida detects in Benveniste's reading of Aristotle. And the same would apply to any version of the wholesale anti-realist doctrine which urges — most often with reference to Nietzsche — that we abandon the old 'metaphysical' idea of a real world whose objects, processes, and events are to be thought of as existing indepen dently of our own (arbitrarily-imposed) catégories, language-games, social constructions, conceptual schemes, metaphorical preferences, and so forth. (26) This reading of Nietzsche is itself highly question able, given his express désire to distinguish between Wissenschaft as a genuinely truth-seeking enterprise and those various pseudo-sciences that merely adopt a rhetoric of truth as a means to dissimulate their own power-seeking interests. (27) But even taking Nietzsche on the terms favoured by his current post-structuralist disciples — that is, as an all-out epistemological sceptic — there still remains the question of whether such a doctrine is intelligible as construed from his own texts or as applied to issues in those various related fields (episte mology, philosophy of language, history and philosophy of science) where its conséquences would have the most decisive and unsettling impact. It is in this context that Derrida turns to Bachelard and Canghuilhem for a sériés of well-documented cases where scientific enquiry can be shown to have started out from some image-complex (26) Nietzsche, 'On Truth and Falsity in their Ultramoral Sense', in Oscar Levy (ed.), The Complété Works of Friedrich Nietzsche, Vol. 2 (New York : Russell &amp; Russell, 1964). (27) See Maudemarie Clark, Nietzsche on Truth and Philosophy (Cambridge : Cambridge University Press, 1990); also Malcolm Pasley (ed.), Nietzsche : imagery and thought (London : Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1978) and - from a Heideggerian/post modernist Standpoint - Babette Ε.

(28) Thus Canguilhem cites a very pertinent passage from Bichat's Treatise on Membranes (1880) : The term 'tissue' deserves to give us pause. Tissue cornes, as is well known, from tistre, an archaic form of the verb tisser, to weave. If the word 'cell' has appeared to be overburdened with implicit significa tions of an affective and social order, the word 'tissue' appears no less burdened with extra-theoretical implications. 'Cell' makes us think of the bee, and not of man. 'Tissue' makes us think of man, and not of the spider. Tissue, a weave, is the human product par excellence. (29) Of course there is a sense in which scientific discourse cannot do without metaphor, that is, without resorting to figures of thought which enable some analogy to be drawn between familiar modes of knowledge or perception and novel (as yet inadequately theorized) domains of research. This is why Derrida questions the idea of conceptual 'rectification' in so far as it might be taken to imply that science could pass altogether beyond the realm of metaphorical expression into a realm of clear and distinct concepts redeemed from such archaic or primitive residues. Thus 'clear' and 'distinct' are themselves metaphorical terms, along with many others — 'idea' and 'theory' among them — whose sense points back (chiefly via Descartes) to the Greek association between accurate conceptual knowledge and accurate visual or ocular représentation. 'Concept' is another such metaphor, this time drawn from the tactile range — 'grasping together', as of complex ideas in a single act of thought — whose members would include such cognate words as 'grasp' and 'compréhension'. So there is reason enough for Derrida's doubt that this process of epistemo-critical 'rectification' must always move (28) See for instance Georges Canguilhem, La connaissance de la vie (Paris : Vrin, 1969) ; Etudes d'histoire et de philosophie des sciences (Vrin, 1968) ; Gaston Bachelard, The Philosophy of No: a philosophy of the new scientific mind (New York: Orion Press, 1968); La formation de l'esprit scientifique (Paris: Corti, 1938); The New Scientific Spirit (Boston : Beacon Press, 1984) ; also Mary Tiles, Bachelard : science end objectivity (Camb ridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984) and Dominique Lecourt, Marxism and Epistemology : Bachelard, Canguilhem and Foucault (London : New Left Books, 1975).

(30) However he is just as far from endorsing the opposite — currently widespread — fallacy which rejects the very notions of scientific truth, knowledge, or progress on account of their belonging to that sheerly rhetorical will-to-power that Nietzsche was the first to diagnose and which Derrida (supposedly) has 'deconstructed' to the point where only a naive realist could find them in the least degree plausible. (3I) After all, as Derrida very pertinently remarks, 'there is also a concept of metaphor : it too has a history, yields knowledge, demands from the epistemologist construction, rectification, critical rules of importation and exportation'. ('White Mythology', p. 224) More than that : there could be no accounting either for science or the history and philosophy of science were it not for (1) the existence of a real-world, mind-independent domain of which knowledge is nonetheless attainable ; (2) the capacity to 'rectify' naive or hitherto unnoticed metaphors, analogies, anthropomorphisms, etc. ; and (3) the résultant possibility of advancing 'from an inefficient tropic-concept that is poorly constructed, to an operative tropic-concept that is more refined and more powerful in a given field and at a determined phase of the scientific process'. (p. 264) It would, I acknowledge, be some what absurd to present Derrida as a full-fledged scientific realist seeking to réfuté any version of that sceptical-relativist doctrine whose sources include Nietzsche, Saussure, and — as rumour would have it — Derrida himself. But it is equally the case that this orthodoxy rests on a partial and distorted reading of his texts and one that is demonstrably wide of the mark when set against the relevant passages in 'White Mythology' and 'The Supplement ofCopula'. However, beyond that, there is the prior question as to whether such doctrines are scientifically and philosophically justified, quite aside from the issue of exegetical fidelity to Nietzsche's or (indeed) to Derrida's text. I would argue that a realist and causal-explanatory approach is alone among present-day candidate-theories in offering an (30) Derrida, 'White Mythology', p. 264.

Most importantly, it insists upon respecting the différence — the ontological différence though not (I should stress) in anything like Heidegger's sense — between the order of real-world (physically instantiated) objects, process and events and the order of conceptual explanatory thought that affords our best current knowledge regarding that ontic domain. For a great deal of the confusion that surrounds this issue of scientific truth can be seen as resulting from a failure to observe what is surely one of the most basic lessons of all human thought and experience. Bertrand Russell made much the same point — and with similar relativist doctrines in view — in a typically vigorous and plain-speaking passage from his 1912 book The Problems of Philosophy. Minds do not create truth or falsehood. They create beliefs, but when once the beliefs are created, the mind cannot make them true or false, except in the special case where they concern future things which are within the power of the person believing, such as catching trains. What makes a belief true is a fact, and and this fact does not (except in exceptional cases) in any way involve the mind of the person who has the belief. (32) For 'mind' and 'belief read 'language-game', 'discourse', 'text', 'paradigm', 'conceptual scheme', or cultural 'form of life' — in short, ail the various substitute-terms that are nowadays common coin among relativist thinkers who have taken the 'linguistic turn' after Nietzsche, Saussure, Foucault, late Witttgenstein, or (as these exegetes are fond of putting it) 'a certain' Derrida. (33) What they share is a total rejection of Russell's argument that truth may indeed be 'relative', but relative precisely to those real-world (mind-indepen dent) states of affairs that determine what shall count as a veridical (32) Bertrand Russell, The Problems of Philosophy (London : Oxford University Press, 1912), p. 130.

Let us once again take Benveniste as an advocate for the relativist view, albeit a linguist of immense érudition who advances his case — unlike so many of the above Company — through a highly detailed and articulate process of critical argument. 'Now it seems to us\ Benveniste writes, 'that these distinctions are primarily catégories of language and that, in fact, Aristotle, reasoning in the absolute, is simply identifying certain fundamental catégories of the language in which he thought'. (34) And again: this language has a configuration in all its parts and as a totality. It is in addition organized as an arrangement of distinct and distinguishing 'signs', capable themselves of being broken down into interior units or of being grouped into complex units. This great structure, which includes substructures of several levels, gives its form to the content of thought. (35) What we recognise in this passage — expressed with great clarity and précision — is the structuralist model of language (la langue) con ceived under its synchronie aspect as a system of interdependent relationships and différences, a network or economy of signifying elements hierarchically ordered for the purpose of more adequate conceptualization. (36) Whatever his criticisms of it elsewhere that project is one that Derrida has often acknowledged as a crucial and indeed a formative influence on his own thinking. That 'a certain structuralism has always been philosophy's most spontaneous gesture' — as he cryptically declared in one early essay — is by no means to be taken as a wholly negative verdict either on structuralism or philosophy. (37) Nevertheless, there are problems about Benveniste's confident extension of the structuralist programme to a point where it claims to establish a priori the precedence of 'language' over 'thought', or — (Ithaca, N.Y. : Cornell University Press, 1987); Steve Woolgar, Science: the very idea (London : Tavistock, 1988).

For as Derrida pointedly remarks : The notion of a linguistic system, even if opposed to the notions of logical system, or system of catégories, and even if one attempted to reduce the latter to the former, would never have been possible outside the history (and) of the concepts of metaphysics as theory, episteme, etc. Whatever the displacements, breaks, and secondary discontinuities of every kind (and they surely have to be taken very strictly into account), this affiliation has never been absolutely inter rupted. ('Supplement of Copula', p. 180) This argument is precisely analogous to Derrida's point about the relationship between concept and metaphor: that any simple (quasi Nietzschean) attempt to invert their received 'logocentric' order of priority will always have recourse to a philosophie schéma that has already provided the working définition of both those cardinal terms. Moreover, it is from Aristotle's fourth (and 'best') type of metaphor — the type that operates through proportion-schemes or complex analogies of the form Ά is to Β as C is to D' — that most subséquent discussions have taken their lead. The best-known statement of this theory is that which appears in the Poetics, but it is also implicit — as Derrida remarks — in a great many passages from Aristotle's texts on rhetoric, linguistics, inter pretation-theory, metaphysics, ontology, and the natural sciences. In its canonical version : Metaphor (metaphora) consists in giving (epiphora) the thing a name (&lt;onomatos) that belongs to something eise (allotriou), the trans ference being either from genus to species (apo tou genous eidos), or from species to genus (apo tou eidous epi to genos), or from species to species (apo tou eidous epi eidos), or on the grounds of analogy (e kata to analog on). (38) Derrida makes two (apparently contradictory) points about this passage. On the one hand 'it is a philosophical thesis about metaphor', a thesis that occupies its proper place within the 'great immobile chain' of Aristotelian ontology whose structure comprehends the entire range of natural and human sciences. Thus it belongs to a (38) Aristotle, Poetics, trans. I. Bayswater, in W.D. Ross (ed. ), The Works of Aristotle (London: Oxford University Press, 1924), 1457b6-9).</page><page sequence="18">428 CHRISTOPHER NORRIS system of interprétation where metaphor is construed (in Derrida's words) as a 'provisional loss of meaning, an economy of the proper without irreparable damage'. ('White Mythology', p. 270) On the other hand it is also 'a philosophical discourse whose entire surface is worked by a metaphorics'. (p. 232) That is to say, Aristotle's défini tion of the various types of metaphor — his attempt to speeify just how they départ from the proper or literal norm — itself has recourse to a range of figurai expressions (metaphors of movement, transfer, kinship, biological species and généra) which bear the main bürden of his argument. As might be expected, given that the very term 'metaphor' dérivés from the Greek verb metapherein ('to carry across'), thus suggesting the transfer of sense by analogy from one term to another and constituting an instance of catachresis, i.e. a metaphorical expression for which there exists no literal équivalent. Moreover, literal is likewise catachrestic since its meaning — what is nowadays its 'literal' meaning — goes back to the idea that one can somehow establish the proper (non-metaphoric) sense of a word by attending closely to the letter rather than the spirit or the gist of what is written. So one can see why Derrida describes the above passage from Aristotle as a discourse 'whose entire surface is worked by a metaphorics'. Still it is unwise to follow those readers of 'White Mythology' — literary theorists for the most part — who opt for the giddying mise-en-abîme that opens up (or so they think) on the far side of the concept/metaphor distinction. (39) I have noted already that Derrida provides plentiful cautions against such a reading, arguments in the strictly transcendental mode which demonstrate the impossibility of holding (or consistently maintaining) this pseudo deconstructive view-from-nowhere. (40) Still it would be just as myopie to ignore those many and better-known passages in the essay which have offered a pretext for blanket déclarations of the type: 'all concepts are metaphors', 'all truth-claims a species of fiction', 'all philosophy a "kind of writing"', and so forth. Thus for instance: (39) See for instance J. Hillis Miller, 'Remembering and Disremembering in Nietzsche's "On Truth and Lies in a Non-Moral Sense'", Boundary 2, Vol. 9 (1981), pp. 41-54. (40) See Gasché, The Tain ofthe Mirror (op. cit.) for a detailed and authoritative treat ment.</page><page sequence="19">DECONSTRUCTION, ONTOLOGY, AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE : DERRIDA ON ARISTOTLE 429 'there is no properly philosophical category to qualify a certain number of tropes that have conditioned the so-called "fundamental", "structuring", "original" philosophical oppositions ; they are so many "metaphors" that would constitute the rubrics of such a tropology, the words "turn" or "trope" or "metaphor" being no exception to this rule'. ('White Mythology', p. 229) However, one must set against this Derrida's equally insistent reminders that any such radical-sounding thesis on metaphor will itself take for granted much of what Aristotle had to say on this topic, even (or especially) where it seeks to overturn that entire 'logocentric' tradition of thought that has subordinated metaphor to concept. Clearly Derrida is in some sense 'paraphrasing' Aristotle — not propounding a thesis of his own — when he writes: '[t]he condition for metaphor (for good and true metaphor) is the condition for truth'. (p. 237) Or again, that 'metaphor, as an effect of mimesis and homoio sis, the manifestation of analogy, will be a means of knowledge, a means that is subordinate, but certain', (p. 238) Yet neither can these passages be simply set aside in favour of a reading that takes the text at its word when the theme is that of philosophy's ultimate undoing through metaphor, its powerlessness to contain or control its own metaphorical productions. For one will still have to reckon with the demonstrable truth that '[t]he concept of metaphor, along with ail the predicates that allow its ordered extension and compréhension, is a philosopheme\ (p. 228) Here at least Derrida may be taken as writing in the assertoric mode, presenting a case that is rigorously borne out by the entire structure and logic of his argument in 'White Mythology'. And one should bear this in mind when one encounters other, more ambivalent passages where the issue of attribution (crude ly speaking : Aristotle or Derrida?) is harder to décidé. Thus : A noun is proper when it has but a single sense. Better, it is only in this case that it is properly a noun. Univocity is the essence, or better, the telos of language. No philosophy, as such, has ever renounced this Aristotelian ideal. This ideal is philosophy ... Each time that poly semia is irreducible, when no unity of meaning is even promised to it, one is outside language. And consequently, outside humanity. (pp. 247-8) There is a possible reading of this passage — say a composite Nietzschean-Heideggerian-poststructuralist-neopragmatist reading —</page><page sequence="20">430 christopher NORRIS that would have no difficulty in deciding the issue. To the extent that philosophy has pursued such ideals (truth, proper meaning, univocity, clear and distinct ideas, the 'rectifying' movement from 'bad' to 'good' metaphors, from doxa to episteme, from nominal to real essences, and so forth) it has always been embarked upon a hopeless quest and one that Derrida does well to renounce. Furthermore, if this leads 'outside language' and even (in some sense) 'outside humanity' then the price is still worth paying since we are thereby encouraged — as Rorty would argue — to explore more varied and inventive possibilities of metaphorical self-redescription. III. Metaphor, Truth, and Ontology : Derrida on Aristotle I hope I have said enough to indicate what is wrong with all this, not only as a reading of Derrida but also as an argument on its own account. For those standards of assessment are in no way distinct, as tends to be assumed by hostile commentators who accuse him of mischievously blurring the line between 'genuine' philosophical argument and textual close-reading in the 'literary' mode. (41) This ignores the clear insistence on Derrida's part that getting things right through rigorous attentiveness to the texts of (say) Aristotle and Benveniste, even if it means controverting some of their express philosophical theses, is also — and inseparably — the means of arriving at a more adequate philosophical grasp of issues in ontology, epistemology, and philosophy of language. Thus it is the virtue of Benveniste's essay, as Derrida reads it, to raise the question of the relationship (the order of priority) between 'thought' and 'language' to a point where that question is susceptible of treatment in terms that involve nothing less than the truth or falsehood of Benveniste's proposai as a matter of demonstrative argument. What Benveniste 'discovers' — despite and against his overt linguistic-relativist Claims — is 'the absolutely unique relationship between the transcendental and language', taking the term transcendental 'in its most rigorously (41) See for instance John R. Searle, 'Reiterating the Différences', Glyph, Vol. 1 (1977), pp. 198-208; also - at a far higher level of philosophie grasp - J. Claude Evans, Stratégies of Deconstruction : Derrida and the myth of the voice (Minneapolis : University of Minnesota Press, 1991.</page><page sequence="21">DECONSTRUCTION, ONTOLOGY, AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE : DERRIDA ON ARISTOTLE 431 accepted sense, in its most avowed "technicalness', precisely as it was fixed in the course of the development of the Aristotelian problematic of the catégories'. ('Supplement of Copula', p. 195) And that deve lopment would include not only Aristotle's discussion but also, for instance, Kant's attempt to establish his own (somewhat modified) doctrine of the catégories on the basis of an argument from the conditions of possibility for thought and judgment in général. (42) It may be said — and quite rightly — that Derrida évincés a high degree of scepticism with regard to such claims, or at any rate a refusai to accept them as a priori valid on the terms and conditions proposed by philosophers from Aristotle to Kant and Husserl. (43) But it would none the less be wrong to conclude that he regards this whole enterprise as inherently deluded or (after Nietzsche) as the 'history of an error', that which consists in mistaking metaphors for concepts, or in failing to perceive how ail our concepts, catégories, and truth claims are merely the products of an epistemic will-to-power and a conséquent need to repress or dissimulate their own rhetorical consti tution. (44) For it is just this argument — albeit proposed in more moderate form — that also finds expression in Benveniste's claim for the priority of 'language' over 'thought' and hence (implicitly) of linguistics over philosophy as the discipline best qualified to establish that fact. 'What is not examined at any time', Derrida writes, 'is the common category of the category, the categoriality in général on the basis of which the catégories of language and the catégories of thought may be dissociated'. ('Supplement of Copula', p. 182) Moreover, it can be shown that this concept 'systematically cornes into play in the history of philosophy and of science (in Aristotle's Organon and Catégories) at the point where the opposition of lan guage to thought is impossible, or has only a very derivative sense'. (ibid.) So the issue of priority between thought and language cannot even be raised — or intelligibly discussed — in terms which take that (42) Immanuel Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, trans. N.

Parent (London : Oxford University Press, 1989).</page><page sequence="22">432 CHRISTOPHER NORRIS opposition for granted without enquiring further into its own (strictly prior) metaphysical or conceptual conditions of possibility. All of which requires that any adequate address to this topic will have to start out from that passage in Aristotle's Metaphysics where his listing of the catégories is preceded by what Derrida calls 'a kind of principial définition', one that présents them as an answer to the question 'of knowing in what ways Being is said, since it is said pollakos, in many ways'. This science, Aristotle argues, will be prior to physics, and will be primary philosophy and universal in this sense, that it is primary. And it will be the province of this science to study Being qua Being ; what it is (ti esti), and what the attributes are which belong to it qua Being. But the simple term 'being' (to haplos legomenon : Haplos: simply, frankly, in a word, without détour) is used in various senses {pollakos legetai), of which we saw that one was accidentai (kata sumbebekos) and another true 0os alethes), not-being being used in the sense of false (kai to me on os to pseudos) ; and besides these there are the catégories (ta skhe mata tes kategorias), e.g. the 'what' (ti), quality (poion), quantity (poson), place (pou), time (pote), and any other meanings. (45) Interprétations of Aristotle nowadays divide into two sharply opposed readings of this and other passages like it. On the one hand is that Heideggerian interprétation which treats Aristotle as having raised the primordial 'question of Being' — of a 'science' that would précédé physics, metaphysics, and all such merely 'ontic' or 'factical' con cerns — but as falling back into a mode of epistemological (subject based representationalist) thought which attempts to bring Being under the various catégories of knowledge and judgment. (46) Whence — so it is argued — that epochal 'forgetfulness of Being' whose history is coterminous with 'Western metaphysics' and whose stages would include all those later claims to refine or improve upon Aristotle's system, or to provide such knowledge with a transcenden tal grounding in the manner of Descartes, Kant, or Husserl. However, as I have said, there is another depth-ontological reading of Aristotle that regards him as the first thinker to have espoused a causal-realist (45) Aristotle, Metaphysics, trans. Hugh Tredenick (Cambridge, Mass. : Harvard University Press, 1933, p. 299. (Cited in Derrida, 'White Mythology' [op. cit.], p. 183). (46) Martin Heidegger, Being and Time, trans. John Macquarrie and Edward Robinson (Oxford: Blackwell, 1962).</page><page sequence="23">DECONSTRUCTION, ONTOLOGY, AND PHILOSOPH Y OF SCIENCE : DERRIDA ON ARISTOTLE 433 approach to the natural sciences and an epistemology that respected the différence — the knowledge-constitutive différence — between our beliefs and whatever it is about the world that makes those beliefs either true or false. (47) On this view much of Aristotle's thinking — including his doctrine of the catégories — has had to be revised as a resuit of later scientific advances, among them (most recently) relativity-theory and quantum mechanics. But in so far as metaphysics is 'prior to physics' it is in the sense of providing a more adequate account of those necessary presuppositions which explain how it is — through what process of deepening explanatory grasp — that such advances in knowledge corne about. (48) And if one thing is clear at every stage in the process it is the impossibility that science and philosophy should ever have embarked upon this path were it not for the various elaborations and refinements carried out upon Aristotle's doctrine of the catégories. Of course there is no denying that Derrida has been deeply in fluenced by Heidegger and that his reading of Aristotle bears the mark of that influence. (49) Ail the same one can trace the clear outlines of a counter-argument in Derrida's work — especially in 'White Mythology' and 'The Supplement of Copula' — which would tend to support that other kind of depth-ontological approach, one that accepts both the necessity of categorical judgement (in more Kantian terms: of bringing intuitions under adequate concepts) and the requirement that such concepts answer to something in the nature of physical reality. I shall now cite some further passages to just this (47) See for instance Rom Harré's excellent brief account of Aristotle as natural scientist in his book Great Scientific Experiments (London : Oxford University Press, 1983). (48) See Imre Lakatos and Alan Musgrave (eds. ), Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1970); Nicholas Rescher, Scientific Progress (Oxford: Blackwell, 1979): Rescher, Scientific Realism: a critical reappraisal (Dordrecht: D.

My point is that these passages présupposé the existence of a real-world, ontologically prior domain in the absence of which there could be no thinking to any purpose about issues in science, epistemology, or philosophy of mind and language. For there are indeed 'good' and 'bad' metaphors as judged from the Standpoint of particular disciplines or branches of knowledge. That is to say, some metaphors prove themselves capable of progressive 'rectification' through a process of jointly conceptual and empirical research, a process whose stages are well described in Canguilhem's account of the cellular metaphor in biology or Bachelard's analysis of the way that figures of the circle and the ellipse functioned in astro nomical thinking from Aristotle to Newton. (50) What is involved here is undoubtedly a question of propriety, of the extent to which apt, Atting or productive metaphors can be distinguished from others that resist such forms of conceptual élaboration or critique and which thus belong more to the realm of imaginative 'reverie', as Bachelard terms it. (5') Indeed there may be cases where this process operates in reverse, where a good metaphor 'can work for the critical rectification of a concept, reveal a concept as a bad metaphor, or finally "illustrate" a new concept'. (52) To this extent the metaphor/concept dichotomy is one that requires deconstruction, not only as a resuit of those com plications that can be shown to arise in the various (mostly philo sophical) texts devoted to this topic, but also as a matter of explaining how it is that science achieves such conceptual advances. On the other hand metaphors may 'seduce reason' or constitute a kind of 'verbal (50) See Canguilhem, La connaissance de la vie and Bachelard, La formation de l'esprit scientifique (note 28, above); also - on this topic more generally - Max Black, Models and Metaphors (Ithaca, N.Y. : Cornell University Press, 1962) ; Eva Feder Kitay, Metaphor: its cognitive force and linguistic structure (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1987); W.H.

Thus, according to Bache lard, 'the danger of immediate metaphors in the formation of the scientific spirit is that they are not always passing images ; they push toward an autonomous kind of thought ; they tend to completion and fulfilment in the domain of the image'. (53) Again it might be coun tered that Derrida is not so much propounding this argument as citing Bachelard's use of it in order to mark off his own, more sceptical or anti-realist position. Nor can this rejoinder be lightly dismissed given the many passages in Derrida's work where he makes very conscious and deliberate play with forms of intertextual allusion or variants of the distinction between 'use' and 'mention' invoked by analytic philosophers. (54) Nevertheless I would put the case that the logic of his argument in 'White Mythology' requires that we should under stand Derrida (like Bachelard) as accepting the distinction between 'good' and 'bad' metaphors, along with the necessity of applying that distinction to issues in the history and philosophy of science. This case finds support in his reading of Aristotle, a reading that encompasses Aristotle's treatment of physics, biology, metaphysics, ontology, epistemology, and — not least — the rôle of metaphor as a heuristic device in these and other fields of enquiry. In Derrida's words: '[t]he ideal of every language, and in particular of metaphor, being to bring to knowledge the thing itself, the turn of speech will be better if it brings us closer to the thing's essential or proper truth'. ('White Mythology', p. 238) Again, it would be precipitate to read this passage as a straightforward endorsement, on Derrida's part, of the thesis that language either can or should aim toward the said ideal. But there are, it seems to me, much greater (indeed insuperable) Problems with any reading that would treat it purely as oratio obliqua, as a Statement whose Aristotelian provenance is sufficient to signal its belonging to the realm of a naively realist metaphysics or ontology. For this is to forget what Derrida remarks in his commentary on Bachelard and Canguilhem : that to 'deconstruct' the concept/ metaphor distinction is not for one moment to deny that metaphors — (53) Bachelard, La formation de l'esprit scientifique (op. cit.), p. 81. (54) See for instance Derrida, 'Signature Event Context' (op. cit.)', also 'Envois', in The Postcard : from Socrates to Freud and beyond, trans. Alan Bass (Chicago : University of Chicago Press, 1987), pp. 1-256 passim.</page><page sequence="26">436 CHRISTOPHER NORRIS 'good' metaphors — can themselves play a formative or decisive role in the production of scientific knowledge. Nor should it be taken as read that when Derrida describes such good metaphors as 'bringing us closer to the thing's essential or proper truth' he must be paraphrasing Aristotle with the purpose of emphatically marking his distance from any such (nowadays discredited) essentialist conception. For in fact that conception has enjoyed an impressive revival in recent philo sophical semantics, a development largely owing to work on modal logic by Kripke, Putnam, Evans, Donnellan, and others. (55) This has done much to vindicate the claim that there exists an order of a poste riori necessary truths, that is to say, items of knowledge — such as 'water = H2O' or 'gold is the metallic element with atomic number 79' — whose standing is contingent on discovery-procedures or the results of empirical enquiry, but whose truth-value is fixed by their reference and therefore holds as a matter of necessity for denizens of this and physically congruent (epistemically accessible) worlds. It has also gone along with a kindred revival of causal-realist theories in pre sent-day philosophy of science, developed very often in response to the perceived shortcomings of logical empiricism. (56) Again we might recall what Derrida establishes (I think beyond reasonable doubt) in 'The Supplement of Copula' : that 'on this matter no analysis will either circumvent or exclude the tribunal of Aristotelianism'. Here it is a question of the catégories — the forms or modalities of predicative judgment — and of Aristotle's claim to distinguish a priori between substance and attribute (or essence and accident) by application of those same catégories. Thus Derrida puts the case (to recapitulate briefly) that Benveniste cannot be right — that his argument runs into manifest self-contradiction — when he (55) See Saul Kripke, Naming and Necessity (Oxford: Blackwell, 1980); Stephen Schwartz (ed.), Naming, Necessity, and Natural Kinds (Ithaca, N.Y. : Cornell University Press, 1977); Gareth Evans, The Varieties of Reference, ed.

But it is equally clear that the doctrine of the catégories (along with ail its subséquent refine ments, elaborations, science-led revisions, etc.) stands or falls with the realist argument for regarding them not as mere conceptual schemes devoid of determinate reference but rather as providing veridical knowledge of that to which they properly apply. For otherwise Benveniste could simply point out — with ample support from the recent philosophical literature — that 'conceptual scheme' is just a place-filling Substitute for 'language', and that his charge against Aristotle (of purporting to 'reason in the absolute' while in fact reasoning in terms supplied by the Greek language) still holds good no matter which of these alternative idioms one chooses to deploy. In short, Derrida's entire argument would collapse — here as in 'White Mythology' — were it taken to exclude those components of Aristotle's theory that link the categorical nature of judgment to the nature of a 'thing's essential or proper truth'. And this applies also to 'good' metaphors, principally those which Aristotle defines as belonging to the fourth type, the kind whose meaning is best explained by the double analogy or proportion-scheme model. Their particular virtue, as Aristotle sees it, is to 'bring us knowledge of something new' through a complex transfer of significations from things already known or terms that possess some familiar range of reference. Thus (from Book III of the Rhetoric)·. '[m]etaphors must be drawn ... from things that are related to the original thing, and y et not obviously so related — just as in philosophy also an acute mind will perceive resemblances even in things far apart'. (57) But such knowledge will count for nothing, in Aristotle's view, if it is a knowledge only of nominal définitions or of the meanings that attach to this or that term by virtue of linguistic convention. Derrida's immense respect for Aristotle is evident in many of his writings, most often when he shows how later philosophers — Hegel and Heidegger among them — have thought to go 'beyond' some limitation or unresolved issue in Aristotle's thought, only to produce another (less perspicuous) rehearsal of the same dilemma. (58) Such (57) Aristotle, Rhetoric III, ii, 1412a9-12 ; cited by Derrida, 'White Mythology, p. 238n.</page><page sequence="28">438 CHRISTOPHER NORRIS (as we have seen) is his argument in the essay on Benveniste, where Aristotle's doctrine of the catégories is taken as possessing absolute (transcategorial) validity with respect to any thesis conceming the order of relationship between thought and language. With 'White Mythology' the case is more complex — or Derrida's attitude more ambivalent — since here the argument comes into tension with a Nietzsche-derived emphasis on the ubiquity of metaphor in the texts of philosophy which exerts a strong countervailing influence. This tension is perhaps most obvious in a passage where Derrida asks us to imagine what might be involved — or what conditions would need to be satisfied — in any project that attempted 'a simultaneously historié and systematic sampling of philosophical metaphors'. First, he writes, it would have to be governed by a rigorous concept of metaphor, a concept to be carefully distinguished, within a général tropology, from all the other turns of speech with which metaphor is too often confused. Provisionally, let us take such a définition for granted. One would then have to acknowledge the importation into so-called philosophical discourse of exogenous metaphors, or rather of signifi cations that become metaphorical in being transported out of their own habitat. Thus, one would classify the places they come from: there would be metaphors that are biological, organic, mechanical, technical, economic, historical, mathematical — géométrie, topo logic, arithmetical — (supposing that in the strict sense there might be mathematical metaphors, a problem to be held in reserve for now). This classification, which supposes an indigenous population and a migration, is usually adopted by those, not numerous, who have studied the metaphorics of a single philosopher or a particular body of work. ('White Mythology', p. 220) Of the many points that could made about this passage let me offer the following as most relevant here. (1) Whatever his Nietzschean réser vations with respect to that idea of 'a rigorous concept of metaphor' Derrida has striven to articulate just such a concept throughout 'White Mythology'. (2) It is only on this basis that one can make adequate sense of Derrida's requirement that metaphor ('good' or well-defined metaphor) be distinguished from those other less rigorously specified (58) See for instance Derrida, 'Ousia and Gramme' (op. cit.).</page><page sequence="29">DECONSTRUCTION, ONTOLOGY, AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE : DERRIDA ON ARISTOTLE 439 'turns of speech' with which it is ail too often confused. (3) Any attempted 'classification' of the various types of metaphor — biolo gical, organic, mechanical, etc. — will need to take account of the various knowledge-constitutive domains to which those metaphors properly apply. (4) One could list Bachelard, Canguilhem and Derrida himself among those thinkers ('not very numerous') who have in fact carried this analysis into various particular 'bodies of thought'. (5) The resuit, in Derrida's case, is to show that any over-generalized or indiscriminate notion of metaphor is incapable of explaining the fit ness criteria — the standards of truth and falsehood — that ultimately distinguish 'good' from 'bad' metaphors in this or that specific région of enquiry. And (6) those régions are themselves to be distinguished in virtue of the defining properties — the constitutive features, causal mechanisms, real as distinct from nominal attributes — which consti tute their appropriate object-domain. For (7) it is impossible that metaphors should yield knowledge except through the kinds of com plex analogy that involve both categorical (predicative) judgments and the ability to 'perceive resemblances' on the basis of a genuine — de re and not merely de dicto — affinity between terms in the implied structure of comparison. As I say, there are many indications in 'White Mythology' that Derrida would resist such a reading of his argument, or at any rate direct us to those other passages where it is affirmed (categorically) that no theory of metaphor can ever be fully adequate to the task of concep tual exegesis and categorization. Still I should venture that this reading is called for as a matter of conceptual necessity if that argument is to be treated at anything like its own high level of sustained analytical grasp. After all, Derrida would be the last to require that we should read so slavishly or uncritically as to take his every utterance on trust. His critique of Benveniste is a much better model here, along with those other essays — on Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Husserl, Levinas, or J.L. Austin — where Derrida is true to his own principle (stated most succinctly in a well-known passage from Of Grammatology) : that while a deconstructive reading cannot dispense with the strictest proto cols of fidelity to the text in hand it is none the less at some point bound to raise issues that go beyond this most elementary of requirements. (59) (59) See Derrida, Of Grammatology, trans. Gayatri C. Spivak (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1974), p. 158.</page><page sequence="30">440 CHRISTOPHER NORRIS And in his dealing with the question of metaphor it seems to me that there is a whole dimension of Derrida's thought which présupposés a critical-realist ontology at odds with some of his more sceptical (or overtly Nietzschean) pronouncements. I shall instance one last passage from 'White Mythology' where this question is posed with oblique but unmistakable force. If we went back to each term in the définition proposed by the Poetics, we could recognise in it the mark of a figure (metaphora or epiphora is also a movement of spatial translation; eidos is also a visible figure, a contour and a form, the space of an aspect of a species ; genos is also an affiliation, the base of a birth, of an origin, of a family, etc.)· All that these tropes maintain and sediment in the entangling of their roots is apparent. However, the issue is not to take the function of the concept back to the etymology of the noun along a straight line. We have been attentive to the internai, systematic, and synchronie articulation of the Aristotelian concepts in order to avoid this etymologism. Nevertheless, none of their names being a conven tional and arbitrary X, the historical or genealogical (let us not say etymological) tie of the signified concept to its signifier (to language) is not contingent, (pp. 252-3) First we should note the caution against naive 'etymologism', against the fallacy — as Derrida thinks it — of tracing 'the concept back to the etymology of the noun' along a path whose (surely Heideggerian) end-point is the appeal to some primordial truth-content obscured by the subséquent history of 'metaphysical' or technologico-scientific accretions. To think in these terms is to ignore the possibility that metaphors may acquire cognitive or epistemological yield in virtue of their appropriateness to the topic in hand and their capacity for criti cal 'rectification' through the process described by Bachelard and Canguilhem. It is also — I would argue — to open the way for ail manner of irrationalist pseudo-profundities and a resultantly confused idea of the relation between science, epistemology, and ethical issues. Derrida would never go so far in his criticism of Heidegger. But the above passage does at least suggest how thinking can be led astray through an over-reliance on etymologies (genuine or false) that sup posedly give access to a truth beyond reach of analysis or conceptual understanding. It is in order to avoid such confusion, Derrida writes, that his essay has been duly attentive to 'the internai, systematic, and synchronie</page><page sequence="31">DECONSTRUCTION, ONTOLOGY, AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE : DERRIDA ON ARISTOTLE 441 articulation of the Aristotelian concepts'. By so doing it prevents any prématuré recourse to a generalized notion of metaphor, one that would give no hold for the sorts of distinction that Aristotle draws between simple and complex, vague and précisé, or routine and inno vatory (i.e., heuristically productive) examples of the kind. Still one may doubt whether this structural-synchronie approach — derived from the working methodology of Saussurean linguistics — is in itself fully adequate to explain the fact that some metaphors (like those of the cellular structure of living tissue, the 'circulation' of blood, or the ellipse as a figure for planetary motion) have attained the status of scientific concepts and thus proved amenable to further élaboration, criticism, and investigative research. (60) For it is among the most basic axioms of structural linguistics — and likewise of any method in the human or the natural sciences which takes its bearings from that pilot discipline — that language is preeminently a system of relation ships and différences 'without positive terms'. (61) Thus in order for linguistics to become a genuine science it must bracket or suspend any concern with the referent (the putative object of discourse) and focus in stead on those two dimensions of language — the orders of the signifier and the signified — where meaning is solely and exclu sively a product of the differential interplay or network of contrastive relations that constitute the proper (theoretically specified) object of any such linguistic science. (62) No doubt there is a sense — an everyday, practical sense — in which speakers manage to refer to certain objects, states of affairs, items of shared perceptual or concep tual acquaintance, etc. But from the strictly linguistic (structural synchronie) Standpoint such observations are beside the point. For only by excluding any extra-linguistic ground of appeal can this disci pline achieve the status of a mature science, one whose theoretical apparatus is nowhere compromised by the dependence on assump tions drawn from outside its own disciplinary domain. This is not the place for a detailed account of the various problems that structuralism encountered in its attempt to extend Saussure's model to other régions of enquiry. Sufficient to say that it often pro duced an outlook of de rigueur epistemological scepticism whose (60) See references to Canguilhem and Bachelard, note 28, above. (61) Saussure, Course in General Linguistics (op. cit.). (62) See especially Roy Harris, Reading Saussure (London : Duckworth, 1987).</page><page sequence="32">442 CHRISTOPHER NORRIS damaging results — especially in historiography, political theory, and philosophy of science — are still very much with us. (63) (In justice to Saussure it should perhaps be pointed out that this whole later chapter of developments went far beyond anything explicitly projected in the Course in General Linguistics.) However, my main concern here is with Derrida's invocation of this model as a means of bringing adequate rigour to the discussion of metaphor as a philosophie topos and — more speeifieally — as a means of conceptual advance in the natural and human sciences. Consider his Statement, with reference to Aristotle, that 'none of their names being a conventional and arbitrary X, the historical and genealogical (let us not say etymological) tie of the signified concept to its signifier (to language) is not contingent'. ('White Mythology', p. 253) That the argument is distinctly under strain at this point is suggested by the tortuous grammar, the multi plied negatives, and the somewhat wiredrawn terminological distinc tions. For Derrida is not only implying a criticism of Heidegger — elsewhere such a powerful presence in 'White Mythology' — as having fallen prey to a species of naive 'etymologism' that confuses the issue with regard to metaphor. (M) He is also rejecting any version of the linguistic-conventionalist thesis which would have it that 'names' attach to 'concepts' only through an 'arbitrary' order of rela tionship, one which is therefore purely 'contingent' upon the way that language happens to distribute its twofold economy of signifiers and signifieds. For when Aristotle sets out to define metaphor it is not just a matter of some 'conventional and arbitrary X' — some particular one among a range of possible signifiers — which occupies that role. Rather it is the case that Aristotle's chosen terms of analysis (his language of genus and species, of resemblance, analogy, proportion schemes and so forth) are terms peculiarly fitted to the purpose in virtue of their proven descriptive, conceptual, and explanatory yield. (63) For criticism of this overly generalized use of Saussure's linguistic model, see for instance Perry Anderson, In the Tracks of Historical Materialism (London : Verso, 1983) ; Valentine Cunningham, In the Reading Gaol : postmodernity, texts and history (Oxford : Blackwell, 1994); Terry Eagleton, Ideology: an introduction (London: Verso, 1991); Thomas Pavel, The Feud of Language : a history of structuralist thought (Oxford : Blackwell, 1990) ; Raymond Talus, Not Saussure (London : Macmillan, 1988). (64) See also Derrida, 'The Retrait of Metaphor', enclitic, Vol. 2, No. 2 (1978), pp. 5 34</page><page sequence="33">DECONSTRUCTION, ONTOLOGY, AND PHILOSOPH Y OF SCIENCE : DERRIDA ON ARISTOTLE 443 This is why Derrida can argue — despite his own just-previous appeal to a conventionalist or structural-synchronie paradigm — that 'the tie of the signified concept to its signifier (to language) is not contingent'. On the contrary : it is a given and necessary tie in so far as certain terms are definitionally équivalent to certain operative concepts, and in so far as those concepts have their rightful applica tion (their determinate validity-conditions) in certain specific areas of enquiry. Thus Aristotle's four chief types of metaphor — together with the (no doubt metaphoric) terms that Aristotle uses to define them — cannot be viewed as so many 'arbitrary' constructs out of a language, the ancient Greek, whose conceptual resources were 'con tingent' on its lexico-grammatical structure, and which hence merely chanced to throw up those particular quasi-universal définitions. It is just this kind of relativizing argument that Derrida finds strictly unin telligible when Benveniste applies it to Aristotle's doctrine of the catégories. And the same difficulty arises with metaphor since here also the proffered définitions are categorical in so far as they have to do with judgments — of space, form, 'visible figure', resemblance, analogy, species- or genus-inclusion, etc. — without which there could be no purposeful thinking about any topic whatsoever. Such is the transcendental argument in its weak (highly generalized but essentially negative) 'condition of impossibility' form. 'Weak', that is to say, in the sense that it goes no further than theorists like Davidson toward offering an adequate (substantive) set of truth conditions or validity-criteria applicable to metaphoric discourse. (65) What is further required is a realist ontology of the kind that Derrida nowhere explicitly endorses, but which none the less figures as a necessary presupposition if his arguments are to hold good. To this extent one is justified, I think, in reading 'White Mythology' as Derrida reads Benveniste in 'The Supplement of Copula'. That is to say, where Derrida establishes (contra Benveniste) the 'rigorous and principled impossibility' of relativizing Aristotle's catégories to lan guage in the manner proposed, so again it can be shown (contra Derrida) that this argument would lack demonstrative force were it not that some such catégories possess a real-world ontological grounding. Hence the fact that certain metaphors — those which involve the (65) Donald Davidson, 'What Metaphors Mean', in Inquiries into Truth and Interpretation (op. cit.), pp. 245-64.</page><page sequence="34">444 CHRISTOPHER NORRIS analogical transfer of attributes from one category or kind of object to another — are able to provide genuine knowledge or even (on occa sion) a decisive advance in scientific understanding. Such, I take it, is the chief lesson to be learned from those studies in the history and philosophy of science that stress the role of metaphor as a heuristic device subject to critical évaluation in terms of its cognitive or episte mological yield. (66) Whatever his express réservations in this regard — his reading of Bachelard and Canguilhem very largely through the lens of a structural-synchronic analysis of language joined to a scepti cal (Nietzschean) 'genealogy' of truth-related concepts and values — Derrida none the less makes it clear that such concepts and values are strictly indissociable from the project of epistemo-critical thought. What is indeed so impressive about 'White Mythology' is this readi ness to place its own more programmatical claims in question through a rigorous process of immanent critique that holds those claims to sci entific and philosophical account. Only thus — it seems to me — can we make adequate sense of his Statement with regard to Aristotle's paradigm instances of metaphor : namely, that 'none of their names being a conventional or arbitrary X, the ... tie of the signified concept to its signifier (to language) is not contingent', (p. 253) This may perchance remind us of some of Davidson's more casual or throwaway assertions, such as his claim (from Ά Nice Dérangement of Epitaphs') that there is 'no such thing as a language', or — from 'The Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme' — that 'in giving up the dualism of scheme and world we do not give up the world, but re-establish unmediated touch with the familiar objects whose antics make our sentences true or false'. (67) However, they arrive at these conclusions by very différent routes and with a very différent sense of what it means to give up thinking in linguistic conventionalist terms. Davidson's is a kind of flat, no-nonsense empiricism which rejects the dichotomy of 'scheme and world' — along with all its conséquent problems — but can offer nothing in its place bar the vague appeal to 'passing theories' as an adhoc (scarcely adequate) solution. Derrida's approach, conversely, is one that goes a (66) See note 50, above. (67) Donald Davidson, Ά Nice Dérangement of Epitaphs' (note 6, above), p. 446 and 'On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme', in lnquiries into Truth and Interpretation (op. cit.), pp. 183-98 ; p. 198.</page><page sequence="35">DECONSTRUCTION, ONTOLOGY, AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE : DERRIDA ON ARISTOTLE 445 long and complicated way around and which — true to its Saussurean lights — eschews any overt talk of the extra-linguistic referent in favour of a dualist (signifier/signified) model of discursive représenta tion. And yet, despite this, 'White Mythology' offers a far more cogent analysis of metaphor, of its rôle in scientific, philosophical and other sorts of discourse, than anything available from Davidson's minimalist account. For when Derrida concludes that the tie between signifier and signified cannot be thought of as 'arbitrary', 'conven tional', or 'contingent' this is not just a matter — as with Davidson — of adopting that crypto-pragmatist line of least résistance which equates meaning and truth with whatever works best for our current interpretive purposes. Rather it is a position that his essay has achieved through a detailed and meticulous treatment of issues in ontology, epistemology, metaphysics, linguistics, and the history and philosophy of science. What this analysis reveals — among other things — is the fact that such a project cannot elude the critical 'tribunal' of Aristotelian thought, whether as concerns the categorical nature of thinking and judgment in général, or as concerns its neces sary grounding in a real-world (mind- and language-independent) ontical domain. IV. Metaphor, Mimesis, and the Growth of Knowledge 'Meaning and référencé', Derrida writes: 'that is, the possibility of signifying by means of a noun'. And, continuing in this Aristotelian mode: What is proper to nouns is to signify something, an independent being identical to itself, conceived as such. It is at this point that the theory of the name, such as it is implied by the concept of metaphor, is articulated with ontology ... The définition of metaphor is in its place in the Poetics, which opens as a treatise on mimesis. Mimesis is never without the theoretical perception of resemblance or similarity, that is, of that which will always be posited as the condition for metaphor. Homoiosis ['adéquation' or 'correspondence'] is not only constitutive of the value of truth (aletheia) which governs the entire chain ; it is that without which the metaphorical opération is impossible ... The condition for metaphor (for good and true metaphor) is the condition for truth ... Mimesis thus determined belongs to logos ... ; it is tied to</page><page sequence="36">446 CHRISTOPHER NORRIS the possibility of meaning and truth in discourse ... Metaphor, thus, as an effect of mimesis and homoiosis, the manifestation of analogy, will be a means of knowledge, a means that is subordinate, but certain. ('White Mythology', pp. 237-8) We are now better placed to assess the status — the 'enunciative modality', as post-structuralists would phrase it, but also the consta tée or assertoric status — of passages like this where Derrida is in some sense rehearsing Aristotle's arguments. I hope to have shown that they cannot be regarded as mere rehearsals, offered up (so to speak) as handy material for knock-down deconstructive treatment on the familiar (quasi-Derridean) lines: 'all concepts are metaphors', 'all truth-claims rhetorical', 'all philosophy a species of poetry or fiction', etc. Such is no doubt the most tempting construal for literary theorists keen to exploit any chance of reversing the received (philosophical) order of priority between truth-related terms — logos, homoiosis, aletheia — and those, like mimesis, that philosophers since Plato have often treated as belonging to an inferior realm of fictive or poetic représentation. But this approach simply won't work for 'White Mythology', unless by excising whole portions of Derrida's argument and reading what remains with a scant regard for its précisé articula tions of detail. To be sure it may be said that the above passage evokes (via Aristotle) a systematic linkage between, on the one hand, truth and its various associated values and, on the other, a concept like mimesis whose primary application is to poetry, drama, and the visual arts. However, this gives no warrant for the idea that Derrida has 'decon structed' those values to the point where they figure as purely rheto rical or fictive constructs. For it is exactly Derrida's point that mimesis for Aristotle has a truth-content — a relationship (through metaphor) to logos and homoiosis — whereby it assumes an essential and productive rôle in the process of human knowledge-acquisition. Such was of course the chief ground of Aristotle's quarrel with Plato over the value of mimetic représentation in the verbal and visual domains. For Plato this could only be a source of error and illusion, a making-do with false appearances that were twice removed from ultimate reality. Thus the artist imitated those objects of sensuous (phénoménal) Cognition which were themselves mere copies of 'forms' or 'ideas' that belonged to a realm beyond the reach of</page><page sequence="37">DECONSTRUCTION, ONTOLOGY, AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE : DERRIDA ON ARISTOTLE 447 quotidian experience. (6S) When the carpenter constructed a table he was at least applying his artisanal skills — his practical or workaday knowledge — to the production of an object with genuine use-value, albeit one whose 'true' nature (whose participation in the form 'table') was such as could only be grasped by an intellect capable of rising above such mundane concerns. But when the artist set out to 'imitate' a table — to portray it in painting or describe it in words — he possessed neither the carpenter's skill in matters of craft and design nor the philosopher's wisdom to seek true knowledge in that higher (suprasensible) realm. Like the sophists or rhetoricians his only skill was in offering a mere semblance of knowledge, a claim to all purpose expertise — in the arts, sciences, history, politics, military matters, and so forth — which enabled him to deceive those credulous types who failed to see beyond appearances. Ail this is of course familiar enough from standard scholarly and philosophical accounts of what Plato was already describing as the 'ancient quarrel' between philosophy and poetry. It is also well known that Aristotle defended the claims of poetic mimesis against Plato's charge by linking it to the most basic of human cognitive powers, the capacity for acquiring knowledge through those various forms of imitation — perceptual, behavioral, linguistic, practical, ethico-political, etc. — ail of which had a vital part to play in the process of educative character-formation. (69) Thus he rejected Plato's other-worldly idealist ontology in favour of a strongly empirical commitment to knowledge as the product of human interaction with those real-world objects, processes, and events whose nature could best be understood through the methods of the physical sciences and not through the contemplation of abstract Forms or Essences. Hence Aristotle's very différent view of mimesis, metaphor and rhetoric, each taken as a valid means of advancing or communicating knowledge just so long as their truth-claims were carefully distin guished from those of the more rigorous sciences or modes of induc tive reasoning. Even so these latter could scarcely have developed — or continued to make progress — were it not for the rôle of mimesis and metaphor in opening up new and productive régions of enquiry. (68) Plato, The Republic, ed. James Adam (2 vols., Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1902). (69) Aristotle, The Poetics (op. cit.).</page><page sequence="38">448 CHRISTOPHER NORRIS For it is precisely the virtue of 'good' metaphors to provide a basis for analogical reasoning from things already known to things whose properties can best be inferred through the perception of resemblance or natural-kind affinity. In other words there is always a mimetic component in the process of knowledge-acquisition, whatever those subséquent stages of advance that enable thinking to reduce its depen dence on 'naive' or 'unrectified' images, metaphors, and modes of perceptual-intuitive grasp. This is why Aristotle can turn the tables on Plato in a passage from Book III of the Metaphysics (cited by Derrida) where it is very much a question of 'good' versus 'bad' or truthful as opposed to specious uses of metaphor. Thus 'Aristotle reproaches Plato for being satisfied with "poetic" metaphors (metaphoras legein poietikas) and for keeping to hollow language (kenologein) when he says that Ideas are the paradigms within which other things participate'. ('White Mythology', p. 238) It is not that such 'poetic' figures are inherently false, misleading, or deceptive ; rather that Plato — himself elsewhere such a stern opponent of metaphor — has here fallen prey to the kind of ontological confusion which results from taking those metaphors at face value and erecting an entire metaphysics upon them. (70) Aristotle's criticism marks him out very clearly as a precursor of those recent movements in philosophy of language and science which still represent the most developed alternative to idealist, conventionalist, or anti-realist views. Roy Bhaskar makes the point with admirable suc cinctness when he asks which constitutes the better explanation of the colour blue : the idea that blue objects are those which 'participate' in the Form or the Essence of blueness, or the fact that their surfaces are such as to absorb or reflect light-waves within a certain (experimental ly determined) frequency-range. (71) Of course there is a sense in which this latter explanation might itself be described as 'metaphori cal', relying as it does on a wave-theory of light which happens to work very well in this context — hence its intuitive appeal — but which would need to be 'rectified' in view of more advanced (e.g. quantum-mechanical or wave/particle dualist) accounts. But this does nothing to diminish the force of Aristotle's argument against Plato, (70) See also Derrida, 'Plato's Pharmacy', in Dissémination, trans.
