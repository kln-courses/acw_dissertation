<plain_text><page sequence="1">G. B. CAiRD, The Language and Imagery of the Bible (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1980). Pp. viii + 280. S20. Students of Scripture may safely ignore this book; it is difficult to imagine any reader who would get much out of it. It is tempting to blame this disappointing outcome on the author's overly ambi- tious aims, and indeed there is something grandiose in a title that proposes to deal with the literal and figurative language of both Testaments, and in a table of contents which further heightens expectations by announcing as topics: "The Meaning of Meaning," "Changes of Meaning," ". . . Ambiguity," "Hebrew Idiom and Hebrew Thought," "The Septuagint"(!), "Anthropomorphism," "Language and History" and "The Language of Myth." As if to raise the stakes, the book is for the common reader: "written for those who read the Bible in English." Yet it is not the ambitious professed aim which is at fault. It would have been exhilarating to see someone seriously undertake a book on such topics, eschewing the professional jargon which so often disfigures writing about the Bible. But Caird is not actually so daring. In the preface he disarmingly styles himself an "amateur," and early on he calls his book, "... a text book of elementary semantics with illustrations from the Old and New Testaments." This is a let-down from the title and contents, but a fair description. The material on linguistic theory, semantics, myth, and so on, is all second-hand. Worse yet, this material is often a mere frame for inclusion of the author's random exegetical and homiletical bits. Thus the book is timid and tired rather than bold. The author seems uncertain or overly hopeful as to his potential readers, their identity and education. The conception of the book as a textbook in semantics with exclusively Bible illustrations invites us to imagine a layman who reads nothing but the Bible and has never been to school, but is now seeking instruction in the meaning of meaning and the varieties of ambiguity. This hypothetical creature knows no Hebrew or Greek but is willing to sit still for several hundred pages of little lectures turning, as often as not, on peculiarities of those languages. (Here and there Greek script is retained.) Much of this material touching on the biblical languages is of very doubtful utility, e.g. the discourse of the name of Yahweh (p. 45-46). Some of it is hypothetical in the extreme, e.g. the reconstructed Aramaic pun supposed to lie behind Matt 3:9, whose conjectural character is not even pointed out. Some changes are wrong: the derivation of Naphtali from npl (a slip?); the old jape about the kid in its mother's</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 119 milk in a Ras Shamra text (it's not); a dubious etymology of Baal-zebul; a mistaken capsule history of early Aramaic. But these lapses pale in significance beside the more fundamental faults in the plan of the book, noted above. Delbert R.
