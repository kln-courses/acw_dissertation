These essays sometimes clarify my work, sometimes scramble it, sometimes carry it forward, sometimes sideways, sometimes backward. To all seven authors and to the editors of this Journal, I am grateful for the attention they have paid to my work. 1. JAMES ACKERMAN'S essay often shows an understanding of my work uncommon among writers who are not professional phi- losophers. For example, while even philoso- phers have often fumbled the notion of ex- emplification, Ackerman not only sees and accepts the main point but provides a perti- nent illustration of his own (see his note 3). His main worry is that I do not sufficiently stress the role of the viewer-the audience- in art, and that I therefore underrate the subjectivity of art and the drastic difference, on this score, between art and science. He writes that science unlike art is primarily a matter of experimentation and proof; that in art unlike science the observer cannot be counted on to act consistently, and con- cludes: I cannot accept the concept of autonomous aes- thetic objects. The aesthetic experience can occur only when an observer is on hand to have it; it is compounded not only of emanations from the ob- ject but also of the mode of receptivity of the observer. The event differs a little or a lot for different observers. Our disagreement, I think, is less about the nature of art than about the nature of science. Whereas Ackerman looks upon sci- ence as "concerned primarily with the proc- esses of experimentation and proof," I think of it, in the words of Lewis Thomas,1 as a mobile unsteady structure . . . with all the bits always moving about, fitting together in different ways, adding new bits to themselves with flour- ishes of adornment as though consulting a mirror, giving the whole arrangement something like the unpredictability and unreliability of living flesh. . .. The endeavor is not, as is sometimes thought, a way of building a solid, indestructible body of immutable truth, fact laid precisely upon fact.... Science is not like this at all. Despite Ackerman's early remark concerning Ways of Worldmaking that Insofar as it deals with art, it struck me as stand- ing in relation to classical aesthetics as relativity theory does to classical physics he seems sometimes to forget that my rejection of the usual contrasting of the scientific-objective-cognitive with the ar- tistic-subjective-emo,tive depends as much </page><page sequence="2">GOODM A N on the artificiality of fact as on the factuality of aesthetic rightness, and as much on the variety and dynamics of worldmaking and the pervasive role of the worldmaker as upon the difference of right from wrong in the arts. I do not deny that our experience of art is highly variable but rather insist that so also is our experience of everything else. I do not hold that there are "autonomous aesthetic objects" but rath- er deny that there are any "autonomous ob- jects" at all. I do not suppose that judg- ments of art can be established by proof from observational premisses certified by confrontation with a fixed and found world, but neither do I suppose that any other judgments can be so established. Standards of rightness in science do not rest on uniformity and constancy of particu- lar judgments. Inductive validity, fairness of sample, relevance of categorization, all of them essential elements in judging the cor- rectness of observations and theories, do de- pend upon conformity with practice-but a tenuous conformity hard won by give-and- take adjustment involving extensive revision of both observations and theories. Standards of rightness in the arts are likewise arrived at, tentatively and imperfectly, by a codifi- cation founded upon but also amending a ragged practice. Our ways of seeing may test and be tested against a way shown in a painting. My insistence on the cognitive aspect of art makes Ackerman and others fear that 1 am bent on anaesthetizing the aesthetic. What I want to emphasize is that pleasure or even ecstasy alone, without insight or inquiry, without recognition of significant distinctions and relationships, without effect on the way we see and understand a world including the object itself, can hardly be considered aesthetic. And I am sure that Ackerman does not regard as aesthetic the pleasure derived from family albums and centerfolds. No doubt he is urging rather that the cognitive aspect alone, understanding with- out love, is not enough. Here I must first point out that, even granting that emotion is required for aesthetic experience, the emo- tion surely need not be love. Boredom, dis- taste, disgust aroused by bad works of art are no less aesthetic; and revulsion, depres- sion, horror, and hate are more prominently and appropriately involved than love in our experience of some great tragic dramas and paintings of bloody martyrdoms. Emotions and feelings are, I agree, re- quired for aesthetic experience; but they are not separable from or in addition to the cognitive aspect of that experience. They are among the primary means of making the discriminations and the connections that enter into an understanding of art. Emotion and feeling, I must repeat once more, func- tion cognitively in aesthetic and in much other experience. We do not discern stylistic affinities and differences, for example, by "rational analysis" but by sensations, per- ceptions, feelings, emotions, sharpened in practice like the eye of a gemologist or the fingers of an inspector of machined parts. Far from wanting to desensitize aesthetic experience, I want to sensitize cognition. In art-and I think in science too-emotion and cognition are interdependent: feeling with- out understanding is blind, and understand- ing without feeling is empty. 2. JENS KULENKAMPFF, I am glad to see, focusses on some crucial topics that are likely to be overlooked or misunderstood by read- ers of my work. These topics have to do primarily with music as art and as a way of worldmaking. Since he and I are in general agreement, his paper gives me an opportu- nity to clarify further, and in one case slight- ly modify, what I have written. In the development of my theory of sym- bols, notation occupies a prominent place, and in music we find the most familiar ex- amples of notation in the arts. As a result, much of what I say about music happens to be about notation, and this may easily create a false impression. Kulenkampff does well to point out that in my view notation is not music, a musical score is not a musical work, and the major aesthetic characteristics of music are not to be understood in terms of the characteristics of notational symbols. The musical work consists of performances, and these usually function in art and in worldmaking quite differently from a score. 274</page><page sequence="3">Aesthetics and Worldmaking Kulenkampff quotes and discusses a para- graph in Languages of Art where I say that a performance of a musical work under standard notation, if denotative at all, is descriptive rather than representational be- cause it is in a syntactically differentiated system. As a result of conversations with Vernon Howard and further thought, I see that this needs some modification. Consid- ered solely with respect to properties pre- scribed in the score-the properties that are common to all (correct) performances of the work-a performance does belong to a syn- tactically and semantically articulate system wherein certain sounds or ranges of sound are uniquely correlated with the characters in the score. But while compliance with a score identifies a performance as of a given work, a performance ordinarily functions within the full spectra of sound; that is within a dense system such that every dif- ference in sound-whether between correct performances or between correct and incor- rect performances-makes a difference. If a performance functioning in this way denotes, it is thus representational rather than de- scriptive. Of course it often also or instead exemplifies or expresses in other systems. Kulenkampff is also concerned to bring out the way music participates in worldmak- ing. How representational painting makes worlds is strikingly clear to anyone who has stepped into a new world after seeing an exhibition of works that work. Abstract paintings, by exemplification and expres- sion, recombine and reweight properties and can make everything we see "square off into geometric patches or swirl in circles or weave into textural arabesques" (p. 105), etc. Non- denotational music operates in similar fash- ion with auditory properties, but not with auditory properties exclusively; for what we hear may exemplify properties of what we see. An auditory and a visual event may both literally exemplify a pattern of highly contrasting multiple elements, or metaphori- cally exemplify conflict; and a "poem, a painting, and a piano sonata may literally and metaphorically exemplify some of the same features" (p. 106). Like Howard Gardner in a recent paper,2 Kulenkampff stresses the importance in 275 Ways of Worldmaking of the view of works of art as "samples from the sea", and of the conception of rightness in the arts as com- parable to validity of projections in science in that both are species of fairness of sample. Kulenkampff's final remark relating this view to Kant's is intriguing and I hope he will develop it further. 3. RICHARD MARTIN, beginning with what seems a purely terminological dispute, ends with total rejection of most of the major theses of Languages of Art and Ways of Worldmaking. He opposes using "denota- tion" to cover both verbal description (predi- cation, naming) and pictorial representation, writing . . .there is a long tradition that 'denotation' be taken more narrowly to stand for a relation only between word and object, and not between a non- linguistic entity and an object.... The behavior of 'denotes' is subject to exact semantical rules just as 'truth' is. At this stage, it would seem un- wise to run counter to such well-entrenched usage and rules. Very well, use whatever words you like so long as you make clear how you are using them. But that will not satisfy him. He ob- jects not merely to the use of "denotation" for a relation that embraces description and representation but to the very idea of such a generic relation and to the very idea of a still broader relation of reference or sym- bolization. In a passage amazing from one so devoted to formal systematization he writes ... it is not clear that the relations of represent- ing, expressing, and exemplifying are symbolic re- lations in any strict sense. Rather they are sui generis, each having its own structure. and later . . the work of art does not stand for [the relata of these relations] or "take the place of them".... To symbolize is to take the place of for some pur- pose or other. A painting does not take the place of whatever it represents, expresses, or exemplifies. To work backwards, how can a word "take the place of" a denoted nonverbal object? Neither within language, where the nonverbal object cannot have occurred, nor outside language, where the word as word does not occur, can the word replace the</page><page sequence="4">GOODMAN object. But that a portrait does stand for or refer to its subject and that any pictorial representation stands for or is a label for or refers to what it represents seems to me quite clear. The real issue is not over termi- nology but over whether description, rep- resentation, etc. are all sui generis. To say that several relations are sui generis cannot mean that they do not have exactly the same structure; difference in structure does not preclude their having significant common properties, or their logical sum from having important properties of its own. That rela- tions are sui generis can only mean that their common properties and the properties of any more general relations including them are not significant but are rather, in effect, misbegotten products of ad hoc couplings. I maintain that, on the contrary, descrip- tion and representation have evident and important affinities, and that these relations together with exemplification and expression and many another relation have important properties common and peculiar to refer- ential relations, where something does stand for, refer to, symbolize something else, or even itself.3 I am by no means suggesting that the specific differences between these relations be overlooked; rather, recognition of genera that embrace several relations invites ex- amination of the differentia among the spe- cies, with the goal an organized basis for a general theory of symbols. Martin's denial that there are any nonverbal symbols and that the relations I call symbolic have any- thing important in common strikes me as a backward step in the understanding of the nature of the arts, the sciences, and language. Such a stance blocks, for example, the rec- ognition that exemplification and expres- sion are alike in running in the opposite direction from denotation, and that their difference from each other depends upon the difference between the literal and the metaphorical. Incidentally, when Martin wants to speak generally of the relations I call referential he calls them aesthetic relations. That is a highly inappropriate description since they are as common in nonaesthetic as in aes- thetic contexts.4 Early in his discussion, Martin writes that exemplification involves no parameter for the painter or viewer, "exemplification be- ing independent of such". But if which things a given label labels involves such a parameter, how can which labels label a given thing be independent of such? Fur- thermore, since which of the labels among those that label x are exemplified by x ob- viously varies with context and person, ex- emplification might be said to be doubly dependent thereon. Later, an especially curious passage ap- pears: Nothing has been said thus far concerning the referential character of this relation. The various aesthetic relations here are not subsumed under reference or denotation, as with Goodman . . . To handle the referentiality of 'Exmpl' we need to consider another representation-relation, that be- tween pictures and properties (or as here, predi- cates). This representation-relation is of course very different from that above, which is of objects or events. To handle this we may use (4) 'a Reprpa'. In other words exemplification, though not subsumed under reference, is subsumed un- der representation, so that depiction and expression are species of representation in general! But how can this abnormal use of "representation" be reconciled either with the little sermon on sticking to entrenched usage (quoted in the first paragraph of this comment) or with the dictum that each of the "aesthetic" relations be considered "on its own"? And if we are willing, as I am, to modify ordinary usage for technical pur- poses, still the grouping of depiction and exemplification under "representation" is surely unfortunate; for this obscures the dif- ference in direction of reference between a relation that runs from label to labelled and another that runs from labelled to label (or correlated feature)-the difference between a relation R and another that is a subrela- tion of the converse of R. In Martin's discussion of expression, two further faults appear. He supposes that ex- pression is always of feelings or emotions possessed by the observer of a work; for example, by a person who "gains a feeling of grandeur . . . from a painting." In the first place, expression is not always of feel- ings or emotions; a black-and-white drawing 276</page><page sequence="5">Aesthetics and Worldmaking may express motion, weight, or even color. In the second place, a feeling expressed by a work cannot be identified with the feeling aroused in the viewer; a painting expressing pain may arouse pity, a sculpture expressing ferocity may arouse fear, and a rhapsody expressing maudlin sentiment may arouse disgust. A feeling expressed by a work need not be experienced or literally possessed by the observer but must be metaphorically possessed by the work itself. Martin remarks in closing that "we must lay the foundations for aesthetic analysis more firmly." Indeed. 4. ALAN NAGEL raises some pertinent ques- tions about my choice of symptoms of the aesthetic. At the start, I must emphasize that the choice is tentative. In general, a symp- tom is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition but rather a feature that we think may, in conjunction with others, make more probable the presence of a given disease or other notable state. And I do not even claim that the symptoms of the aesthetic I list are conjunctively sufficient or disjunctively nec- essary, though I doubt that what is aesthetic often lacks all of them. Choice of the symp- toms perhaps belongs to an early stage in a search for a definition that will derive from and yet must drastically reform an es- pecially chaotic usage. Thus discussion of symptoms of the aesthetic cannot be carried on in terms of proofs of adequacy and con- clusive counterexamples. All I can do is to indicate some of the considerations that led to my choice. The question why referentiality of any and every sort does not count as a symptom is easily answered. The features selected are those thought to be helpful in differentiat- ing aesthetic from other symbolic function- ing and symbols; that is, as Nagel conjec- tures, "referentiality names the field itself" wherein the aesthetic is to be distinguished. But this, as he points out, raises acutely the question: ". . is exemplification as a symp- tom so clearly any more to the point than denotation or expression?" Since expression involves exemplification, however, albeit of a property metaphorically rather than liter- ally possessed, the question narrows to why 277 exemplification but not denotation is taken as a symptom. The answer is that exemplification is often the most striking feature distinguishing lit- erary from nonliterary texts: poems, novels, short stories, from scientific treatises, cook- books, and annual reports. In a literary work what usually counts is not only a story told but also how it is told. Much the same is true of the difference among representa- tional pictures between serviceable illustra- tions and works of art. Rhyme, rhythm, and other patterns exemplified, and feelings and other properties expressed, count for much in most works of art, but for little in scien- tific or practical discourse, whether verbal or pictorial. Of course, exemplification oc- curs in many a nonaesthetic context-we use examples all the time; and I am not denying that expert revelatory description or depic- tion or exposition can constitute art. Never- theless exemplification qualifies as a symp- tom in that its presence is often the most marked difference between the aesthetic and the nonaesthetic. Relative repleteness is listed among the symptoms of the aesthetic because it draws the crucial and delicate distinction illus- trated in Languages of Art by the difference between a stock market chart and a Hokusai drawing of Mt. Fujiyama. The lines may match exactly; but in the chart, variations in the thickness and shading of the line do not matter, while in the drawing every var- iation in every aspect of the line does matter. The premium in a work of art seems to be on repleteness; in a diagram, on attenuation. The rationale for taking syntactic and semantic density as symptoms is somewhat different. They may seem unpromising as signs of the aesthetic since, for example, no text whether literary or not is syntactically dense, while all are semantically dense. Thus choice of these symptoms cannot be based on any supposition that the aesthetic is more often than not syntactically dense or that the nonaesthetic more often than not lacks semantic density. Rather the thought is that the syntactically and semantically dense symbols and systems we encounter and use are more often than not aesthetic; that within the aesthetic more often than else-</page><page sequence="6">G OO D M A N where we find the dense. Thus density, es- pecially when combined with other symp- toms, suggests the aesthetic. Multiple and complex reference, the fifth symptom, was added after Languages of Art was written.5 Scientific and practical dis- course, verbal or pictorial, normally aims at singularity and directness, avoiding ambigu- ity and complicated routes of reference. But in the arts, multiple and complex reference of all sorts-from simple ambiguity of deno- tation to reference through one or more straight or tortuous chains traversing several levels-is common and is often a powerful instrument. Though not a universal or ex- clusive feature, it is a symptom of the aes- thetic. Other features, such as figurativeness and fictiveness, have sometimes been proposed as additional symptoms. But metaphor in some stage of decay so permeates almost all lan- guage that figurativeness strikes me as hav- ing little symptomatic value. As for fictive- ness, not only are many nonfictive texts works of art; but abstract works, not denot- ing at all, are not fictive. This of itself would not necessarily rule out fictiveness as a symptom. What does seem to me to dis- qualify it is that a fictive work always refers by exemplification or expression or through a referential chain. Fictiveness would thus add nothing to a list of symptoms that al- ready includes exemplification and complex reference. Looking over all these symptoms, I notice certain interesting affinities among them. Three are properties required to be absent from what I have defined as a notation, and the other two would be extraneous and usu- ally troublesome in a notation. All five are features that tend to reduce transparency, that tend to require concentration upon the symbol to determine what it is and what it refers to. Where exemplification occurs, we have to inhibit our habit of passing at once from symbol to what is denoted. Replete- ness requires attention to comparatively many features of the symbol. Dense systems, where every difference in a feature makes a difference, call for an endless search to find what symbol we have and what it symbol- izes. Have we here then a neat, complete, in- evitable, and inviolable set of symptoms? Of course not. None is always present in the aesthetic or always absent from the non- aesthetic; and even presence or absence of all gives no guarantee either way. Nor do the symptoms offer a way of measuring to what degree a symbol or function is aes- thetic; to have more of the symptoms is not to be more aesthetic. All we have here are the hesitant results of groping towards a more adequate characterization of the aes- thetic; and the symptoms stand in somewhat the same relation to such a characterization as lines drawn in the mud to a surveyor's plan. 5. JOSEPH MARGOLIS now agrees that exem- plification is a form of reference and that normally an object exemplifies only some of the properties it possesses. Yet he still wants to deny that a work of art as such may exemplify some but not others of its properties. He holds that it would be "more economical" just to say that the work pos- sesses such properties. But there are many properties of a work that have nothing to do with its being, or functioning as, a work. The properties that count are properties it refers to; and reference to a literally pos- sessed property constitutes exemplification. A musical performance may possess the property of occurring in New York while rain was falling in Timbuktu but the per- formance of the work does not refer to that property as it may to certain rhythmic pat- terns. And of two paintings that are alike square in shape, an Albers may exemplify squareness while a Rubens does not. Only a false economy can be achieved by ignoring so important a difference. Margolis makes much of my saying that a work of art selects the properties it exem- plifies, calling this anthropomorphic; but this is no more anthropomorphic than say- ing that a colored surface selects the light rays it reflects. Indeed, an object might be said to select all the properties it possesses, and then from these to select those it exem- plifies. I find Margolis's final paragraph puzzling. In the course of it, he writes: 278</page><page sequence="7">Aesthetics and Worldmaking . . why not concede that work of art may merely possess properties that it does not exemplify? Thus exemplification seems to be a necessary property-something rather more than a symp- tom-of art. I not only concede but have always insisted that a work never exemplifies all the prop- erties it possesses. I cannot follow the argu- ment preceding the "Thus"; and while ex- emplification is a rather common feature of the aesthetic, the burden is upon those who claim that it is a universal one. (See further §4 above.) 6. ANITA SILVERS'S paper calls attention to some questions that I did not consider in my chapter on style. I was concerned only with what is meant by saying that a work is in a given style. Such questions as whether a work may have more style than another or be very stylish or without style did not arise. In order not to infuriate Professor Silvers, I shall refrain from suggesting that these are peculiarly feminine questions. Before I discuss them, two matters need clarification. Readers of the Silvers paper should be warned that she uses "signature" here differently from the way I ordinarily use it in Ways of Worldmaking. She uses it metaphorically as equivalent to "style." I use it literally for the artist's name and, by extension, for all other features that con- tribute to the placing of a work (as to artist, style, period, etc.) that are not features of style. Second, she somewhat misinterprets my too brief explication of style when I write that "a property . . . counts as stylistic only when it associates a work with one rather than another artist, period, region, school, etc." (p. 34). I should have written ". when it associates a work with the other works of one rather than another artist ..." A stylistic feature, in my view, is a feature that is exemplified by the work and that contributes to the placing of the work in one among certain significant bodies of work. Characteristic features of such bodies of work-not features of an artist or his per- sonality, or a place or period or its character -constitute style. Most works are in many styles, varying in specificity and intersecting in various ways: 279 a given painting may be at once in Picasso's style, in his Blue Period style, in the French style, in the twentieth-century style, in West- ern style, and so on. Silvers suggests that some works, such as television productions, are in no style at all. If so, that is because significant bodies of work have not been picked out and dignified as style classes. But is there any general measure of degree of stylishness? What is meant by saying that one work has more style than another? The difference can hardly lie in the number of style-classes the works belong to. It lies rath- er, I think, in the comparative prominence that the stylistic features take on in relation to other features and functions of the works. In a routine picture illustrating an exposi- tory text, what counts is what is represented; any stylistic features such a picture may have are inconspicuous, and its exemplification of them matters little. On the other hand, in some inferior mannerist paintings, exempli- fication of a style may be about all that mat- ters. Underemphasis and overemphasis of style alike are both aesthetic faults. A great- er work, such as an El Greco painting, may no less powerfully exemplify a notable style while functioning equally effectively in other aesthetically significant ways. Incidentally, to be stylish in the context of fashion in clothing is of course to be in the latest style. This comes under our gen- eral formula; for in fashion, being up-to- date is the measure of the transient impor- tance of a style. 7. PAUL HERNADI raises questions about quo- tation that lead quickly to tough problems about the nature of thought. A direct quotation must contain a replica of what is quoted, either spoken or written, or of a translation thereof. The words Juanita said, "He's caught" directly quote what Juanita said even though they are written in English and she spoke in Spanish. But what if Juanita did not speak or write of her conquest but only thought of it? Do the words Juanita thought, "He's caught"</page><page sequence="8">GOODMAN directly quote her thought? That may seem an innocent and easy question; but when Hernadi first raised it in conversation with me, and wondered if the answer would be positive on the ground that thoughts are in words, I began to worry. Since then I have ruminated on the question from time to time, and I am presently on the verge of working harder on it; but all I can offer here are some preliminary reflections. The conviction that thoughts are always in words has thrived on the recent philo- sophical focus on language, but has been primarily sustained by the incredibility of or incomprehensibility of the most familiar alternatives: looking upon the mind as a sort of cinema theatre, or upon thoughts as ideas couched neither in words nor pictures nor any other symbols. Yet the view of thinking as purely verbal leaves many an open question. What of the difference we do perceive, and describe how- ever inadequately as between "having and not having a picture in the mind" of a per- son or place? What happens when we "have a thought we cannot put into words"? Fur- thermore, since we do work and communi- cate overtly with symbols of all kinds, can thinking be with words alone? And do we have in the mind images of words but no images of anything else? Or if a thought of a word is not an image, what is it? To such questions, I can respond only with some tentative and conditional guesses or counterquestions: (1) We can obviously think of pictures, but can we think in pic- tures?-Yes, if we can think in words. (2) Are there thoughts without words?-Yes, if there are thoughts without pictures. (3) Are there pictures in the mind?-Yes, if there are words in the mind? (4) How can a picture be in the mind?-Well, how can a word be in the mind? All this doesn't answer Hernadi's ques- tion, but may attest to its significance. Does Juanita thought, "He's caught" directly quote her thought? Hmm .... NELSON GOODMAN Harvard University 1 Harvard Magazine, vol. 83 (1980), 19-20. 2"Gifted Worldmakers", Psychology Today (Sep- tember 1980), pp. 93-96. 3I do not, as Martin implies in one place, "sub- sume [these] relations under denotation" but rather under the broader relation of reference. Exemplifi- cation and expression are nondenotational but ref- erential relations. 4This holds even for exemplification, although it is a symptom of the aesthetic.
