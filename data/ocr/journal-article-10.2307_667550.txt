Six chapters at the close, of which we had an earlier direct translation into French and German by Eduard Seler, report the craft techniques of the Aztec gold workers and lapidaries. The joining of the two themes of the merchants with the jewelry craftsmen provides a clear indication that Aztec society attained the splendor with which its name is usually associated only after 1450, and that the economic activities of the merchants were a principal factor in the sudden prosperity of the Tenochca people. The most complete recent study of the pre-Conquest Mexican merchant class is by Miguel Acosta Saignes, entitled, "Los Pochteca" (Acta Anthropologica 1, 1945). Acosta's work discusses the spread of Aztec commerce and its relation to Mesoamerican society, as well as the ritual traits of the behavior of the merchant class. Acosta, how- ever, overlooked the clear indications of an economic history outlined above. To be sure, the Spanish text by Sahagun is more compact than the Nahuatl sources. The historical awareness of his native informants, which comes through to us with insistent clarity in Dibble and Anderson's translation, is muted and reduced in the Spanish versions. On this point as on so many others, we now can see that two versions of Sahagun's record of Indian society were available. One is the uncondensed native text as put down from the speakers' mouths, and the other is a Spanish version, directed by Sahagun and intended to edify European readers without offering great difficulties to 16th century understanding. It is still unclear how much Sahagun understood the things his Indian associates told him. In the present case we may wonder whether Sahagun himself followed the drift of the economic history so boldly outlined in the first chapters of Book Nine, when we see how little of it survived in his Spanish text. Teotl and Ixiptlatli: Some Central Conceptions in Ancient Mexican Religion. ARILD HVIDTFELDT. Copenhagen, Denmark: Ejnar Munksgaard, 1958. 182 pp. d.kr. 24,-. Reviewed by CHARLES E. DIBBLE, University of Utah In a section on cult and myth, Hvidtfeldt presents the views of Robertson Smith. He further accepts Smith's view that cult or ritual is primary and myth is secondary or accessory. Whereas Smith was not familiar with the concept of mana, Hvidtfeldt dis- cusses the concept at great length and considers an understanding of the nature of mana as vital to the problem of cult and myth. In the discussion of mana, the dancing mask or masked dancer is a concentration of mana, i.e., "the mask is mana-bearing." Turning to the writings of his teacher, Dr. Svend Pallis, the author sees a course of historical development in which the mana of hunting peoples develops toward fixed dieties, anthropomorphic dieties, in urban agricultural communities. Basic to his thesis is a quotation from Pallis: "Presumably the primitive agriculturist introduced anthro- pomorphism; he thought of everything in the cosmos as human, and all the manas of the cosmos assumed human characteristics.... In urban culture... the idea of a deity becomes firmly established. . . the relation between the god and his image is one of identity.... " Hvidtfeldt turns to Aztec religion to illustrate his theoretical considerations, utiliz- ing the Mexican text materials of Bernardino de Sahagun. One of his reasons for select- ing the Mexican material is that he considers the Aztecs at "the stage which is charac- terized by agriculture and an incipient urbanization." The word teotl is to be translated as god or mana. He concludes: "From a linguistic point of view the word has not been thoroughly investigated, but from a factual point of view we have established usages which must be supposed to be based on concepts of 'mana,' and in such a way that the word teotl itself must be assumed still to have-or at least to have had-a meaning of</page><page sequence="2">408 A merican A nthropologist [63, 19611 'mana'." Ixiptlatli is not translated but its meaning is given as deputy, representa- tive, image colored by the meaning of mask. After translating selected texts, Hvidtfeldt questions the use of deputy in ritual texts and concludes, "It is the image itself, the Teixiptla which constitutes the god." This is because "things with the same 'mana' are identical." The conclusion supports the earlier quotation from Pallis. The translation of the Mexican texts is difficult to assess, since the rendition of many passages is offered as provisional or suggestive. However, in the reviewer's opinion, Hvidtfeldt's translation forces the Mexican material to fit the thoeries he outlines. Headhunter's Heritage: Social and Economic Change among the Mundurucu Indians. ROBERT F. MURPHY. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1960. xi, 202 pp., bibliography, index, 2 maps. $5.00. Reviewed by WILLIAM D. HOHENTHAL, San Francisco State College The essence of this book is the relationship between the Mundurucu and the White man after 150 years of culture contact. A simple people was attracted by the manufac- tured goods of civilization, and in the process of acquiring these the nature of Mun- durucu society was altered to the point where now it has neither important goals nor a future to offer its members. These people are fully aware of the situation but, tragi- cally, cannot free themselves from their economic shackles, which are largely self- imposed. The Indians straddle two worlds, their own and that of the White man, but their position is not stable. They are pushed into the general Brazilian caboclo society of the Amazon by their own desires for material goods and because of disturbances in Mun- durucu society fomented by those desires; they are pulled into the same milieu by the chronic demand for cheap labor in the Amazon Valley. The result is the disap- pearance of the traditional Mundurucu social system and culture, the Indians relent- lessly being moved into the position of increasing dependency, both economic and social, to the Brazilians. The author analyzes very well the processes of change, historical and contemporary, in the economy and social structure of two separate types of Mundurucu settlements for the purpose of ascertaining how cultures do change (theory) as well as how cultures have changed (description). The traditional sort of Mundurucu settlement lies in the savanna and preserves a number of aboriginal ways; the other kind is more recent, is situated along rivers, and is dependent on outside markets for its very existence. At the time of White contact, the Mundurucu were patrilineal and patrilocal. When trade with the Brazilians in manioc flour made by the Indian women was established, a greater premium was placed on female labor and, as continuity of the female work group had to be assured, matrilocality of residence developed. The incongruity of descent and residence made for instability of the social system, as a man had no clan role to perform in the village of residence after marriage where the hereditary population consisted of women, and former clan participation in reli- gious ceremonies shifted to village participation in these rites, thus destroying their symbolic value and undermining the bases for social action. As a consequence, in- group hostilities were produced which, in the absence of an outlet, could result in social fission. Paradoxically, this development was a source of strength to the Mundurucu during initial contact with the Whites because the cross-cutting ties of residence and descent</page></plain_text>
