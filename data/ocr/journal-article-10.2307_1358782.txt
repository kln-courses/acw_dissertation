Farrington O 'c " ooking into the mirror, the black woman asked, 'Mirror, Mirror, on the wall, who's the finest of them all?' The Mirror answered, 'Snow White, you black bitch, and don't you forget it!' " These telling words, inscribed on a 1987 silver print by the African-American artist Carrie Mae Weems (b.1953), encapsulate the debilitating circumstance of being a woman of African descent in a society whose standards of beauty have always excluded her. Porcelain skin, long, silken hair, and delicate, ta- pered features are characteristics that at once identify the so- called "ideal" Western beauty and insist upon the unattractiveness of women of color, whose body image has been much maligned over the centuries. The paucity of images of the black female nude in the history of Western "high" art attests to this deplorable cir- cumstance. Similarly the abundance of these images in 19th- and 20th-century ethnographic and pornographic photography, well- documented in The Black Female Body: A Photographic History by Deborah Willis and Carla Williams attests, paradoxically, to the intense fascination and attraction that the black female body has held for the West for much of the Common Era.' The aesthetic history of the female nude is, in and of itself, fas- cinating and socially charged. In many ways, the evolution of the nude functions as a narrative, revealing the accepted, and thus cul- turally constructed, roles of women in Western society. The chron- icle of the black female nude is even more complex and carries with it cultural ramifications that are both sexual and racial. Un- derstanding the iconography of the female nude and its relation- ship to social psychology and gender roles is essential to an analysis of contemporary African-American art on the subject, particularly given the imaginative ways in which artists of color have reconfigured and deconstructed age-old archetypes associ- ated with the woman's body. Since antiquity, the nude female has been understood, by and large, as a passive creature. She reclines or poses placidly in a pas- toral setting or in a domestic interior for the benefit of an often unseen but invariably assumed male viewer. Her eyes are either modestly averted or shyly welcoming, and she offers herself up as a feast for the male gaze. Passive, receptive, and available, she is presented as sexual spectacle-an invitation to voyeurism, lacking individuality, cognition, or the ability to act decisively. Conversely, the male nude is readily depicted as energetic and active, exempli- fying vigorous pursuits such as athleticism, heroism, and violence. The persistence of male action and female inaction in much of Western art reflects the male artist's belief (and the belief of the patriarchal society of which he is a product) that the social, eco- nomic, and political mobility of women should be limited, and cer- tainly should not exceed that of men.2 Although exceptions to the passive female paradigm do occur in Western art, they are rare and usually associated with evil or with allegorical creatures of legend.3 The ancient Greek artists, for example, while most often reserving active representations of the nude for male figures, allowed limited exceptions in female hunter and warrior characters such as Diana, Athena, and the Amazons. The ability of these women to "act" (as did male nudes) hinged, however, upon their status as superhumans or as goddesses, ele- vated above the realm of ordinary women. In the case of the leg- endary Amazon, the quintessential hunter/warrior, her identity as a woman was all but replaced by masculinity, which was consid- ered more compatible with her active nature. Amazons, who surgi- cally removed one breast so that they might hold their bows flush against their chests for better aim, were quite literally transformed into men. Historian Abby Kleinbaum has even suggested an ele- ment of misogyny in the persistence of Amazon imagery in West- ern artistic traditions. She argues that the Amazon figure, being notoriously masculine, functioned to give men free reign to fan- tasies in which they might harm women with impunity, and within a socially accepted context.4 Allegorical figures and femmes fatales represent further cate- gories of nudes that do not conform to the traditional passive mod- el. Allegorical representations of ideas such as Victory, Justice, Liberty, Virtue, and Revolution, as substitutes for abstract con- cepts rather than as actual women, are allowed both literal and metaphorical mobility.5 Femme fatale figures, popularized in fin- de-siecle art, are evil or predatory and, as such, are portrayed as especially powerful and definitive in their actions. Femme fatale figures use their sexuality as a weapon and thus present a special danger to men. The unleashed sexuality or power of personae such as the Sphinx, Eve, or Salom6 menaces and engulfs male victims without mercy. Their combination of sexuality and physical prowess makes these women quite literally lethal. Thus, on those rare occasions when female nudes are not either reclining in the landscape or draped over a velvet divan-when they actually ap- pear to have a will and thoughts of their own-they are portrayed as either potentially dangerous or conceptually abstract.6 Since the 1970s, with the advent of the Women's Art Movement, these paradigms have changed. Many women artists now infuse the female nude with integrity, wit, and dynamism.7 African-American women artists add, as well, the elusive attribute of beauty. Faith Ringgold (b. 1930), for example, began featuring nude women in her work as early as 1972, when she developed a series entitled Slave Rape. Utilizing a Pop art idiom, which had been a part of her vernacular since the early 1960s, Ringgold created cartoonlike nude women in landscape settings. The humorous facial expres- sions and body configurations are adaptations from popular black stereotypes such as the "Happy Darkie" and the "Mammy"--images that had proliferated in American culture since post-Reconstruction and the age of Jim Crow." Yet, beyond the Pop art caricature and familiar stereotypes lies an extraordinary combination of elements. For example, in Help (P1. 9) from the series, Ringgold has juxta- posed playful nude figures frolicking in the landscape with the bit- ter theme of slave rape. She portrays women of sexual maturity 0P FALL 2003 / WINTER 2004</page><page sequence="2">-, ~gi~i ??5 ln~ /;~~i~ ?I?~ ~? *"~~ ~ A -:.: i~?l? I I*? Fig. 1.

(indeed, several are pregnant) who are active rather than passive, and who, despite their wildly animated gestures, are neither alle- gorical symbols nor sexual predators. Finally, Ringgold's women are warriors, some even armed with axes. Yet, they are not mas- culinized Amazons. Indeed, everything about these black nudes contradicts the conventions of this genre. Ringgold's highly idiosyncratic conception of the nude in the Slave Rape series is the outcome of complex motivations. In the artist's own words, "Slave Rape was...like going back and trying to understand some of the roots of black women [who came] here. What were we doing here?...and what were we like before we got here? I wanted to be in touch with that."' Contained within this in- quiry is the artist's expression of a need to understand the women who survived their enslavement and sexual abuse. Indeed, the stereotype of the sexually promiscuous black "Jezebel" has its roots in the history of the sexual abuse of African women by slave traders and slave owners. In particular, Ringgold sought to explore this history and to deconstruct the myth of the black Jezebel. Mistaken beliefs that African women were sexually promiscuous and, like animals, fit only for breeding, formed the foundation of the Jezebel myth. This fiction began the moment African women were taken as prisoners by slave traders-the very moment Ringgold has chosen to capture on canvas. The torment of rape was re- served primarily for enslaved women who, during the grueling voyage across the Atlantic, were brought above deck for this ordeal. Refusal to submit often meant death. This posed a terrible moral dilemma for the African women: submission to the slave traders and sailors, however abhorrent, meant possible survival and even some measure of protection from the worst horrors of the voyage. Before even arriving in the New World, African women were labeled promiscuous and lacking in morals by the very men who had raped them.'0 Once on American soil, slave women were subjected to further punishment if they did not submit passively to the sexual advances of their owners. Their victimization was thus indefinitely perpetu- ated, and they became part of a "passive yet insidious breeding .~?? ''?? ?* I; .1 system" that required them to become pregnant at an early age and produce as many children as possible. In this way, the slave system ensured that the sexuality of African-American women would be devalued and society saw them as deserving of their fate." In the Slave Rape series, Ringgold attempts to alter the history of "those brave African women who survived the horror of being uprooted and carried off to slavery in America.'"12 The artist metaphorically travels back in time to alter the future, arming her ancestors so that they might defend themselves against male sexual aggression. In Help Ringgold empowered her women, while si- multaneously disempowering the slave catcher, who is symbolical- ly castrated, center left, by the edge of the canvas. His entire body above the thighs has been cut off, leaving only a glimpse of re- treating black boots and white pants. In Ringgold's configuration, rape becomes impossible and history is rewritten. Integral to an understanding of Ringgold's re-formation of the African woman as an innocent victim of sexual and physical ag- gression is the phenomenon of the Hottentot Venus (Saartje Baartman) (c. 1815; Fig. 1), the 22-year old South African woman brought to Europe as an indentured servant and placed on display in Paris and London over a period of five years, until her death from small pox in 1815. She caused a medical and popular sensa- tion due to her so-called "Hottentot apron" or enlarged clitoris and her steatopyga or large buttocks. A satirical depiction of a naked Baartman standing upon a pedestal before several well-at- tired European men and women was accompanied by the follow- ing caption in a popular French publication: "La belle Hottentote. Oh! Goddam, what roast beef;...Ah! How comical is nature; how strangely beautiful."'3 Baartman's full-figured form inspired medical treatises by George Cuvier and J. J. Virey who, by studying the so-called "primitive" sexuality and genitalia of Hottentot women, sought to obtain deeper insights into female sexuality in general.'4 Once the sexual excessiveness and deviance of African women had been es- tablished, however falsely, connections were then made between African women and European prostitutes, including pseudo-scientific 0 WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL</page><page sequence="3">am'v ..............

National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne. comparisons between buttocks size and the formation of the labia.'5 African women became synonymous with sexual deviance, and European woman who exercised sexual freedom were marked as degenerates, no better than their animalistic African counter- parts-an evaluation designed to regulate female behavior. The stereotype of the Jezebel is closely linked to the image of the Hottentot, as are other common stereotypes such as the bux- om and masculinized "Mammy" and the "Sapphire" or emasculat- ing matriarch (Weems's "black bitch"). Each of these clich6s served to justify white fears and self-loathing by projecting what was loathed or feared onto others.'6 In the case of the Jezebel and the Hottentot, the white male attribute that was projected upon the black women was uncontrollable sexual desire. Although there is little doubt that the sexual aggressors in interactions between women of color and white men were males, women were nonethe- less classified as the wanton and licentious ones. Images of African women as sexual animals, which first began to appear in scientific and popular journals in the 1700s, increased just prior to the Civil War when anti-abolitionist sentiment was at its strongest, and reached a fever pitch in the United States during post-Reconstruction.'7 The degrading images of African Americans that proliferated beginning in the 1890s were intended (as were the period's "Jim Crow" laws) to undermine the social status and mobility afforded to people of color after the Civil War. Stereotypes of African- Americans became part of the popular consciousness, with per- sons of African descent depicted as subservient, subhuman, and powerless, often with grossly exaggerated features. African-Ameri- can men were stereotyped as stupid, shiftless, lazy, irresponsible, and dangerous. African-American women endured the same racist stereotypes, but to these were added others, which were grounded in sexual bias. The impact of these stereotypes on the African- American image and psyche was devastating."' The African-American author and activist Frances Beale de- scribes the crushing effects of the mythology assigned to African- American women: Her physical image has been maliciously maligned; she has been sexually molested and abused by the white colonizer; she has suf- fered the worst kind of economic exploitation, having been forced to serve as the white woman's maid and wet nurse for white offspring while her own children were more often than not starving and ne- glected. It is the depth of degradation to be socially manipulated, physically raped, used to undermine your own household, and to be powerless to reverse the syndrome.19 Yet, are African-American women truly powerless? Although racism and sexism have worked together to create for African- American women a "hell of a history to live down,", the false para- digms that portray women of color as both physically unattractive and sexually promiscuous, passive and aggressive, good care-givers to white children and bad mothers to their own children, have all been challenged by African-American artists." The photographer Renee Cox (b. 1958), for example, has dedi- cated her career to deconstructing stereotypes and to reconfigur- ing the black woman's body, using her own nude form as a subject. In her nude self-portraits of the 1990s, such as Liberty in the South Bronx and Yo Mama and the Statue (Fig. 2), Cox uses her body to comment on race and gender issues. In Liberty in the South Bronx, she depicts a powerful and youthful twist on the alle- gorical figure of Liberty. As in Bartholdi's Statue of Liberty, Delacroix's Liberty Leading the People, and numerous similar rep- resentations, Cox's Liberty raises her arm high above her head in a gesture designed to uplift the spirit and motivate action. She does not, however, hold a light or a weapon in her hand, but rather bro- ken chains, and she stands amidst the detritus of a deserted Bronx crack yard. The monumental nude figure in this portrait redresses the American notion of "liberty and justice for all" and its applica- bility to the disenfranchised inhabitants of poor inner city neigh- borhoods such as the South Bronx. In Yo Mama and the Statue, Cox poses nude and pregnant be- side a life-sized cast of her own body. Her luminous dark skin pro- vides an effective counterpoint to the stark whiteness of the plas- ter cast and alludes to a period when Cox, while enrolled in the Whitney Museum Independent Studies Program, attempted to reconcile her persona as a pregnant black woman artist with the white male conventions of museum study and classical statuary. The flesh and blood Cox embraces the plaster statue and rests her head upon its shoulder. The statue, while not in fact larger than Cox, appears more monumental because of the towering African- inspired headdress that it wears. The statue's rigidity and verticali- ty are juxtaposed to the soft, fluid contours of the artist's body. The resulting image suggests a "sisterhood" in which the totemlike form of an African ancestor provides physical, psychological, and spiritual support for her contemporary heir. Even the title of the piece suggests a duality. The phrase "yo mama" references the ver- nacular present and the cultural complexities associated with African-American life and motherhood, while the word "statue" suggests both a European and an African art-historical past. In Hottentot 2000, Cox directly addressed the issue of the Hot- tentot Venus and the sexual stereotypes that contemporary African-American women have inherited as a result of that image. To replicate the body of Saartje Baartman, the artist attached en- larged prosthetic breasts and buttocks to her own body and posed, in profile, in front of a red, black, and green velvet backdrop, which references the colors of black nationalism. Her silhouette provides the viewer with the best possible angle of vision, and her deliberate stare "invites-almost dares--onlookers to take a closer look."21 COX's direct gaze pays homage to Manet's Olympia, which shocked visitors to the Paris Salon of 1863 because the nude "Olympia," like Cox, dared to look back at those who were looking at her." What viewers observe upon closer examination of Hotten- tot 2000 are "the careful application of make-up [and] neatly kept dreadlocks"-in other words, an icon of African beauty that chal- FALL 2003 / WINTER 2004</page><page sequence="4">ii i"td '' ??., , ? o.,. lenges Western tenets.' To use historian Andrea Barnwell's well- chosen words, Hottentot 2000 "addresses complex issues of voyeurism, fantasy, memory, disguise, and the gaze," and unlike her objectified and victimized Hottentot predecessor, Cox is an ac- tive participant in this examination of the black female form, which she has cleverly re-made into a prototype of beauty for the third millennium.24 Another artist who has recontextualized the black female nude is Alison Saar (b. 1956). Drawing upon neo-African sources such as the Vodou religion of Haiti, Saar creates multimedia works in both two- and three-dimensions. She utilizes "found" or "ready-made" objects conceptually derived from early-20th century Dada art, but unlike the Dadaists, who embraced nihilism, Saar's works are in- fused with logic and meaning. Her women, in particular, are com- plex expressions of the artist's personal experiences and knowledge of art historical traditions, visualized with intellectual depth, wit, and emotional intensity. In Mamba Mambo (1985; P1. 10), Saar cre- ated the secular equivalent to the sequined Vodou drapeau or flag, complete with tassels. Drapeaux are normally made of satin fabric covered painstakingly by hand with sequins and beads. The flags depict anthropomorphic images of the Vodou loas or spirits; or they depict vev--diagrammatic symbols for the various loas. They are waved by members of the congregation to call the spirits to the Vodou ceremony.5 In Saar's interpretation of the theme (configured in her signa- ture neovernacular style inspired by the bold, reductive forms of African-American folk art), a nude black woman dances in bright red high heels, sporting equally vivid lipstick and long fingernails. The title of the work suggests a Vodou mamba, or priestess, as well as the African-derived Cuban dance, the mambo. In Haitian cul- ture, the Vodou priestess is a powerful and revered community leader, and the mambo dance is known for its energetic move- :ii" ii Fig. 5.

Thus, even in titling the piece, Saar identifies her nude fig- ure with authority and action, reinforcing both attributes by hav- ing her figure grasp a coiling snake in each fist. Within the neo- African ontology of this work, the snake represents the positive life force of the serpent deity, Damballah, whose undulating move- ments are echoed by the figure's swaying body. The nude figure's physical prowess is further signified by the vicelike grip with which she holds and controls the writhing serpents so close to her. Indeed, the word "mamba" (from the Zulu im-amba) describes a poisonous and hoodless green cobra found in southern Africa, the reference further asserting the figure's physical strength and courage. The nude figure is flanked by two palm trees; their trunks writhe like snakes. The palm tree signifies not only Damballah, who as a serpent makes his home in trees, but also the Vodou spirit Aizan, a revered divinity and patron of market places, public spaces, doors, and barriers. As the eldest of all the loas, she is entitled to the first offerings at Vodou ceremonies and considered a spirit of great rank. She derives from a Dahomian or Benin goddess of West Africa, who bears the same name, and is in turn associated with azan or palm leaves (from which the name Aizan derives). In Vodou belief, the palm tree and this powerful goddess are synonymous.2 Saar's palimpsest approach to symbolism is a hallmark of her work. As each hermetic layer of meaning is peeled away, we find the message of female empowerment repeated. For example, the only clothing that Saar allows her figure to wear are high-heeled shoes. In traditional art and in popular culture, a nude figure that wears shoes conjures up ideas of the "street walker" or prostitute. (A quintessential example of this occurs in Manet's Olympia, which depicts a reclining figure wearing little more than shoes, whose identity was further sexualized by the presence of a black maid and whose apparent vulgarity horrified 19th-century view- 0 WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL</page><page sequence="5">ers.27) For Saar, however, high heels symbolize the female ele- ment in a universal and more positive sense, and can be found as motifs in many of her works.2s The artist's personal iconogra- phy also manifests itself in the two hieroglyphlike symbols at the base of the composition, which are similar to the linear designs that represent Vodou loa. During a ceremony the Vodou priest or priestess draws a series of sym- bols or veves on the floor of the temple, using flour or cornmeal. Each drawing, abstract and dia- grammatic, calls a particular loa to the ceremony, and, once the loa is present, the drawing is erased (often by the dancing feet of the ceremonial participants). Appropriately, Saar places her veve on the ground," but they are not the marks of any spirit; rather, they are the symbols for the artist's own name-Alison Saar-in the form of the initials "A" and "S." The presence of these emblems makes Mamba Mambo self-ref- erential and identifies Saar as both the subject and the creator of her image. When a woman paints the fe- male nude, whether it be her own body or that of a model, there often exists a self-referential fluency that allows for a more expansive and less trivialized "gaze." The artist becomes the object of her own self-reflexive desires as well as an active surveyor of her own body (in the case of a self-portrait), or of a cognate body with which she identifies. This creative act contradicts and counteracts the presence of the male artist-viewer. Women artists of recent decades have mostly refrained from imitating male artists in their representation of the nude. Instead, they record an experience that empowers females with mythic qualities, such as the physical might and intrepid persona of Saar's Vodou goddess, or the ability of Ringgold's 17th-century African women to triumph over their would-be slave catchers. Depictions such as these enhance self- discovery and promote a sense of well being and self-worth. In fact, the very nature of women artists painting the female nude implies a contradiction of terms, since the male gaze is replaced with a female one. Feminist art historian Carol Duncan believes that male representations of the female body assert the artist's sex- ual domination over his subject. If this assessment is correct, then it would follow that when women paint female bodies, they are re- claiming dominion over them." What then of the black female nude, whose racial "otherness" compounds the issues of gender normally associated with the nude form? Despite the abundance of nude figures in Western art, the black body has been virtually invisible within this context. Accord- ing to the social historian Sander Gilman, "It could be said, there- fore, that the political issues involved in the representation of the "* .e I 9. i~l~5;r~s~~~P ?i s "'' pi .r: C~L I U ~7 ;~14 ~ i: yr t-. pi I:iji?:?l?:8~F~ i :i:i :~??:?? ..i :;r ???:'"' ?s*ii -..i . * : ?.i;? ....:, female body by black women artists are even more complex than those faced by white women."" This being the case, the value of the African-Ameri- can woman artist's endeavor to represent her own body cannot be overstated. Writing in 1973, Judy Chica- go and Miriam Schapiro assert- ed that the woman artist, "see- ing herself as loathed, takes the very mark of her otherness and by asserting it as the hallmark of her iconography, establishes a vehicle by which to state the truth and beauty of her identi- ty. "3' This statement, a refer- ence to the "otherness" and "loathsomeness" of female gen- italia (a motif embraced by many feminist artists) under- scores the complexities of imag- ing the black woman's body, whose "otherness" lies with both her gender and ethnici- ty-in her dark skin, her broad features, and her curly hair- attributes that, for much of Western history since the 1700s, undoubtedly have been "loathed." One artist who has attempted to deconstruct the perception of black female "otherness" is the ceramic Fig. 6. Archibald J. Motley, Jr., Brown Girl After the Bath (1931), oil on canvas, 48'/4" x 36". @ Archie Motley. Courtesy Michael Rosenfeld Gallery, New York. sculptor Winnie Owens-Hart (b. 1949). In the autobiographical Trimesters (1990; P1l. 11), Owens-Hart treats the brown skin, curling pubic hair, and swelling abdomen of a woman of color as natural and beautiful. A multiple-part sculp- ture, it depicts two hands holding a water jar, two segments of blue water, and three representations of a woman's abdominal and vagi- nal area. These components are aligned vertically, with increasing intervals between each. In the last two large segments, the figure's hands hold its own abdomen. The work is life-sized and commem- orates the birth of the artist's daughter.32 The references to water have multiple allusions: to the moment when a pregnant mother's uterine membrane ruptures (that is, when her "water breaks") and the birth of her child is imminent; to the prenatal fluid in which the unborn child "swims" prior to birth; and, finally, to the artist's creative endeavors as a sculptor and potter, who uses water as a vehicle to mold clay. Furthermore, in Trimesters Owens-Hart relates the artistic creative process of "making" sculpture to the biological creative process of "making" a child. The artist achieves this by placing two hands on the water jar as if to shape it, and by placing the same hands (now darker and illuminated by glaze) on the figure's abdomen. Trimesters bears comparison to a wide range of conventional nudes such as those featured in the recent Tate Gallery/Brooklyn Museum exhibit Exposed: The Victorian Nude. The idealized figures featured there have flawless skin and no body hair. In contrast, the skin of Owens-Hart's figure exhibits creases, folds, depressions, FALL 2003/ WIMNTER 2004</page><page sequence="6">and uneven coloring; and the pubic hair is not only evident but emphasized by the use of glazing techniques. In his History of the Black in Western Art, Hugh Honour examines the reason why tra- ditional nude figures were "deprived of pubic hair, which men rec- ognize as the first symptom of their own sexuality." The intention was to deny women active sexual prowess and empowerment, thus making them as passive as prepubescent girls. "This denial of fe- male sexuality," states Honour, "is paralleled by the denial of virility in images of black [slave men], eunuchs, or literally dead men," and it allowed viewers to construct an image of women and blacks as powerless.33 In light of this, Owens-Hart's insistence on a thick cropping of pubic hair can be construed as an insistence on the power of her own maternal sexuality. Even on those rare occasions when black women have been portrayed as objects of beauty, femininity, and veneration, they in- variably fall prey to stereotypes of gender. For example, in St. George Hare's The Victory of Faith (1891; Fig. 3) and in Fernand Le Quesne's Les deux perles (1889), white and black women are paired to emphasize their respective charms. Despite their racial differences, the African and European women in these paintings are presented as ideals of beauty-soft, shapely, and feminine. In- cluded in the Hare composition is a deliberately titillating hint of lesbianism, observed in the way the women's hands touch and in the manner in which the black woman's hand rests upon her com- panion's thigh. Both women recline passively (indeed, they are asleep and therefore incapable of returning the viewer's gaze), and are frontally exposed. They embody both the erotic, in their de- fenseless nudity and proximity to one another, and the exotic, in that they portray Christian slaves from antiquity (note that they sleep on a stone floor atop a makeshift straw palette and are chained to a wall, upon which a Christian cross has been etched).m By situating the nude figures in the far removed past, Hare allows his viewers (again, quintessentially 19th-century male Salon visi- tors) to observe the nude bodies without experiencing any of the social discomfort inspired by the directness and perceived im- morality of Manet's Olympia, exhibited some 30 years earlier. Le Quesne's Les deux perles is quite literally that-two women, one African and one European, emerging like pearls from an over- sized oyster shell on a rocky seashore. The women are presented without historical pretext, as pure erotica. One reclines in the con- cave form of the shell, as if waking from a deep sleep. She is ex- posed frontally to reveal a flawless expanse of milky white skin de- nuded of all body hair. Furthermore, both women turn away from the viewer. In fact, the African woman's entire body faces into the picture space, completely obscuring her pubic area as an emblem of her sexuality and her face as the mark of her personality. Despite her unusually active, though not especially aggressive pose (the African woman stands and is gesturing to something, perhaps a boat, on the distant horizon), she and her companion are ultimately passive creatures who are not even allowed to "look" at the viewer. Denied individuality and personality in favor of what Honour de- scribes as "soft-core" erotic personae, the women's sole function was to delight and arouse a white male viewer without threatening his sense of social control or status. Canadian historian Charmaine Nelson explains that "the power of the gaze [denied the women in both the Hare and Le Quesne paintings] has historically been a white male heterosexual prerogative." Nevertheless, an examina- tion of images painted by white women artists reveals, in Nelson's words, "white women's participation within, and collusion with, the colonial and patriarchal precepts of Western culture."35 For instance, in 1800 Marie-Guilhelmine Benoist (1768-1826) painted a sensitive and masterful portrayal of an African woman ti- tled Portrait of a Negress (1800; Fig. 4). Despite her grace and loveliness, the seated figure, here gazing out at the viewer, can hardly be considered empowered. Rather, she sits swathed in white drapery (designed to contrast with her mahogany complexion), ap- pearing both sad and submissive. Her hands are folded across her lap and the cloth that covers her body has been pulled aside to re- veal her right breast, as if for the viewer's inspection and enjoy- ment. Her dark skin, seminudity, and the bandana she wears on her stately head define this African woman as Moorish erotica-a pop- ular genre in colonial European painting that depicted Africans in Arabic costume and embodied both the erotic and the exotic ele- ments common to academic French painting of the period.36 This attitude continued well into the 20th century. For exam- ple, the Canadian portrait and figure painter Prudence Heward's (1896-1947) Dark Girl (1935; Fig. 5) identifies the sitter only by her race and presents her, arms folded, shoulders slouched, amidst a thick tropical garden, recalling "colonial perceptions of Africa as the 'dark continent,' a mysterious and impenetrable place teeming with moral and sexual vice.""37 Although more than a century sepa- rates the Benoist and Heward portrayals, the women's expressions are similar; both appear helpless, vulnerable, and submissive. As Nelson rightly observes, "within Heward's [and Benoit's] colonial fantas[ies], the utter servility and uncomfortable surrender of the black subject activates the power and sexual potency of the white artist/viewer."38 Images of the black female nude made by 20th-century African-American men echo many of the same stereotypes ob- served in the works of white artists, for example, the languid Sea Island-inspired nudes of Eldzier Cortor, the sexualized fantasy im- ages of Romare Bearden, and the sculptural reclining nudes of William H. Johnson. Archibald Motley Jr.'s Brown Girl After the Bath (1931; Fig. 6) offers a captivating variation on the theme.39 A nude woman whose brown skin seems to glow in the soft interior light sits before a mirrored vanity. She holds a container of powder and a puff and she wears only shoes, suggesting that the subject of the work is the proverbial "harlot performing her toilet."40 Indeed, Motley's known interest in this 17th-century Dutch theme sug- gests precisely that (articulated in two Jan Steen paintings entitled Morning Toilet-one from 1663 in the Royal Collection, London, the other, c. 1665, in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, both of which resemble Motley's composition).41 However, Motley's figure is neither conspicuously idealized, overly eroticized, nor tractable. On the contrary, the woman's fleshy torso and rounded buttocks are portrayed with apparent fi- delity, and Motley directs her reflected gaze toward the viewer. This nude woman is relaxed, at ease with the implied presence of the male viewer and with her own body despite that presence. She has much more in common with the historian John Berger's defin- ition of "nakedness" than with more traditional conceptions of nu- dity. Whereas the conventional nude is perhaps best described as an unclothed body that is "clothed in art," Berger's "naked" body refers to a "real" woman whose prosaic form has been exalted by the artist's depiction." Thus, while Motley replicates certain classic stereotypes of gender-the woman as passive sexual spectacle-he deconstructs others, allowing his model personality, beauty, and some small measure of authority. Motley's painting bears comparison to Ringgold's French Col- lection Series (1991-97) of painted "story quilts" in which the artist introduces black characters into traditionally and specifically French settings, such as the Louvre or Matisse's chapel in Vence. Q WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL</page><page sequence="7">In several of the paintings, Ringgold also replaces the white fe- male nude with a black one. Picasso's Studio (1991; P1. 12), for ex- ample, situates a slim, youthful black woman (the artist's alter-ego, Willia Marie Simone*) on a chaise longue in the Spanish painter's studio. As is typical of Ringgold's story quilts, she has bordered the acrylic painting with quilted fabric, printed with a fictional story. Novel in its conceptualization is the introduction of a black nude into Picasso's inner sanctum, whose figure upstages Les Desmoi- selles d'Avignon (1907), depicted on the rear studio wall. Ring- gold's Willia Marie usurps the crown of the ideal Western beauty, traditionally reserved for women with fair skin and flowing hair, displaying with confidence her own short, curly hair and dark skin for the artist to paint. However, one would be wrong to suggest that Willia Marie's pose, echoing that of the nudes in Les Desmoi- selles, merely presents a black woman, instead of a white one, as passive and disempowered. For instance, note that Ringgold has reproduced several African masks into the painting. Picasso, a known collector of African masks, incorporated their forms into Les Desmoiselles. The masks take on new meaning within the con- text of Ringgold's imagery and her carefully constructed narrative. In fact, they speak to Willia Marie as she poses for Picasso, en- couraging her empowerment: "Don't be disturbed by the power of the artist....The power he has is available to you," reads Ringgold's narrative. Willia Marie also receives whispered encouragement from the women in Les Desmoiselles, who remind her of her sexual power, and from her Aunt Melissa, who advises her to follow her dream to become an artist and to paint art that is important to her. To pass the time while posing, Willia Marie muses about her African ancestry, the beauty of black women, and the importance of artistic freedom. Ringgold's scripted narrative provides the nor- mally mindless female nude with rare cognitive powers. This insis- tence on personality and individuation sets Ringgold's nude figures apart from virtually all conventional nude imagery and, despite the seeming passivity of Willia Marie's pose, she does not recline lan- guidly but rather sits upright with her back straight and her lower legs criss-crossed, in a walking position, strikingly similar to the pose of the woman in Motley's painting. Furthermore, Willia Marie is smiling warmly and confidently (though not seductively), and she looks directly at the artist whose large eyes engage her own. Active, thinking women such as Willia Marie are rarely repre- sented in art because they have been perceived as both a physical and an emotional threat.44 In a late-1980s study of career women, the psychiatrist Joseph Natterson discussed the persistence of this thinking in contemporary society: The current ideal of an aggressive and competitive woman repre- sents a constructive variation from the traditional [passive] norm, but since such women are still regarded (and therefore regard themselves) as deviant, they continue to experience excessive guilt, anxiety, and depression for their deviation from the [passive] stereotype." As Natterson suggests, society continues to respond negatively to women who are as socially, professionally, or politically empow- ered as men. In turn, women who choose career paths traditional- ly reserved for men (such as an artist) must cope with a certain amount of social rejection and censorship. Ringgold's awareness of the dangers of being a woman in a man's profession is revealed in the narrative of Picasso's Studio: "My art is my freedom to say what I please....They may not like it or buy it or even let you show it, but they can't stop you from doing it...if they throw your art back at you...don't worry." Ring- gold's words, spoken in the voice of Willia Marie and indicative of the very anxiety Natterson describes, express the artist's fear (de- spite her professional success) that the art world might reject her and her depictions of empowered and beautiful black nude women. Yet, despite her concerns, Ringgold advises Willia Marie (and thus herself) to remain true to her creative vision. Skeptical attitudes toward assertive women are particularly problematic for African-American women, who have historically been linked with contentiousness and masculinity. Embodied in such stereotypes as the "Sapphire" and the "Matriarch," images of the domineering black woman manifested themselves in popular thinking as early as the late-19th century, and continued to take shape as the 20th century progressed. Implicit in these stereotypes was the notion that women "wore the pants" in African-American families and that African-American men were demeaned by the secondary status to which they had been relegated in their own homes. The character of "Sapphire" in the popular postwar radio and television series "Amos 'n' Andy" provided the definitive in- carnation of the black shrew. Sapphire was a "bossy black bitch" who, while remaining a faithful "mammy" or servant to a white family, ruled her own home with an iron hand and simultaneously made a fool of her husband." By the 1960s, widespread patriarchal disapproval was being di- Fig. 7. Renbe Stout, Fetish No. 2 (1988), mixed media, 64" high. Dallas Museum of Art. Courtesy of the Artist.

Signs of authority, acumen, or au- tonomy on the part of African-American women were perceived as subversive and detrimental to the healthy socialization of the black male. This perspective found official voice in the government- sponsored Moynihan Report, released in 1967. In brief, the au- thors of the report inferred a baseless causal relationship between the perceived high educational and professional achievements of African-American women and opposing phenomena, including criminal behavior, in African-American men. The philosophical basis of the report manifested itself in what has since become known as "the Myth of Black Matriarchy," which categorizes African-American women as "Sapphires" or "castrators" who con- trol and dominate their men. The widely publicized report essen- tially blamed African-American women for the ills of their men and families, ignoring the true culprits of centuries of slavery, racism, and economic and social discrimination.47 Stereotypes of the domineering African-American woman af- fected not only the way these women were perceived by others but also the way they viewed themselves. In light of this, it is not surprising to find an element of consternation in Ringgold's narra- tive for Picasso's Studio, which voices a concern that society will reject or disapprove of her strong female character. Nor is it espe- cially remarkable that Ringgold has camouflaged Willia Marie's provocative, feminist thinking behind an equally provocative nude body and within two narrow bands of written text, discernable only upon close and labored examination. As the art historian Moira Roth notes, despite the introduction of text, viewers see rather than read Ringgold's works, which function much like the Trojan Horse of Greek mythology.48 Ringgold's audiences are initially en- chanted by the seeming naivet6 of her imagery, her vibrant palette, varied textures, and lively visual narrative. Once the view- er digests Ringgold's written messages (often words of social cri- tique), it is too late-the impact of her discourse hits home even as the imagery continues to delight. Female empowerment masquerading as apparent passivity can also be found in the works of Rene Stout (b. 1958), particularly in her 1988 mixed media sculpture Fetish No. 2 (Fig. 7). Inspired by nkisi nkondi or "power figures" from the Kongo, Stout created a body cast of herself and "empowered" it, as might a Kongo shaman, with medicinal sacks or bilongo that protect the wearer, cowrie-shell eyes that thwart the male (or any) gaze, and monkey hair and beaded braid extensions that allude to both the artist's African and Western cultural realities.49 Mounted on the stomach of the figure is a glass-covered box reminiscent of the raised con- tainers found on the bellies of Kongo figures. Like its African counterparts, the container on Stout's figure holds symbolic mate- rials-a weathered photograph of a baby, representative of inno- cence and of the future, dried flowers that allude to the ephemeral nature of life and to memories, and a postage stamp from Niger, emblematic of the artist's long-distant African past. The life-size plaster cast of the artist's body has been painted with several layers of rich, dark paint and stands immobile and silent like an ancient sentinel. The figure is nude except for the beaded and metal jewelry that adorns its ears, neck, wrists, and hips, and its mesh mantle of medicine packets. Yet, despite its nu- dity and passivity, Stout's nude form bears only a vague and super- ficial resemblance to the inactive nudes that decorate the walls of so many museums. "This is ritual nudity, not the available female nude of Western art," the historian Michael Harris assures us, and its function is neither to titillate nor to reinforce any racial or gen- der status quo.? Rather, through visual affirmation, Stout's Fetish No. 2 and Ringgold's Picasso's Studio provide their respective artists with, in Stout's words, "the strength to deal with the things you have to deal with every day."51 The works of Weems, Cox, Saar, Owens-Hart, Stout, and Ring- gold examined herein are the results of women artists reclaiming what was always theirs but had been usurped from them--control over their own bodies and a voice with which to speak about it.52 Historian Gill Saunders explains that "women artists who wish to challenge the existing stereotypes of the female nude as erotic spectacle are using a variety of techniques: the reworking of myths, the deconstruction of dominant visual codes, parody, [and] role reversal."53 Stout and her contemporaries take advantage of virtually all of these strategies and depict for us new women who have eluded the limiting framework of the conventional (mostly male-produced) Western nude. Carrie Mae Weems's words bear repeating, as they describe the intensity with which the black woman's image has been maligned: "Looking into the mirror, the black woman asked, 'Mirror, Mirror, on the wall, who's the finest of them all?' The Mirror answered, 'Snow White, you black bitch, and don't you forget it!"' Indeed, African-American women artists have not forgotten. They relent- lessly battle the imagery and the attitudes that have refused to let them forget. As weapons, they use new visual archetypes designed to dispel society's resolute insistence upon their ugliness, their ac- quiescence, and their silence. African-American women artists have retrieved the nude and infused it with personal and universal meanings. They have discovered ways to remake and re-present their own naked images free from patriarchal and imperial associa- tions and, as makers of their own bodies, they have created com- manding exemplars, not of the "other" but of the "self."5~A NOTES 1. The continued invisibility of the black female body in Western sur- veys of the nude is evident in the recent exhibition and catalogue, Ex- posed: The Victorian Nude (London: Tate Gallery, 2001), which toured London, Munich, New York, and Japan between 2001 and 2003. Of nearly 200 catalogue illustrations, only two feature women of color. See al- so Hugh Honour and Jean Devisse, The Image of the Black in Western Art, 4 vols.
