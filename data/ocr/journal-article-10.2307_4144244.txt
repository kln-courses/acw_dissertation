<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sixteenth Century Journal XXXIII/1 (2002) Constructing a Peaceful Imperialism: Manipulating Gender Identity in the Comentarios reales de los Incas Patricia Heid Wake Forest University The Inca Garcilaso de laVega was the first mixed-blood, or mestizo, author to publish in Spanish. In his 1609 Comentarios reales de los Incas (Royal commentaries of the Incas), he describes the Incas' extended campaign of conquest and colonization of the other so-called barbarous indigenous groups of Peru. The Comentarios depicts the Incas as exemplary conquerors, who practiced an ideology of peaceful imperialism, characterized by constant dialogue and interaction with their conquered subjects. This ideology contrasted with the dominant ideology of Spanish histories, based on the epic model. Garcilaso specifically manipulates the binary paradigm of gender identities inherent in epic, which legitimizes conquest by force as the natural domi- nance of a male-gendered, civilized conqueror over a female-gendered, barbarian subject. Garcilaso took as his model the paradigm of gender relations elaborated by Leone Ebreo in his treatise on Neoplatonic love, the Dialoghi d'amore, which Gar- cilaso had translated into Spanish and published in 1590.

The Spanish histories of conquest, such as Cortes's Cartas de relaci6n (1522) and L6pez de G6mara's Historia natural y moral de las Indias (1554), were quickly translated into other languages and distributed among the European reading public in multiple editions.' These histories did men- tion the Spaniards' admiration for the Amerindian cultures and societies they encountered. However, they primarily narrated an epic tale of civilized, heroic conquerors who had triumphed over the darkness of barbarism.

The first of these mestizo historians to publish in Spanish for a European audience was G6mez Suirez de Figueroa, who as an adult, assumed the name Inca Garcilaso de laVega. By taking the name of his father, a conquistador and descendant of a preeminent Spanish family, and preceding it with the label of "Inca," the heritage of his mother, an Incan palla or princess, Garcilaso reaffirmed his complex cultural identity. This identity configured his own unique perspective on the cultural history of the Incas and the more recent events of the Spanish conquest, which he had witnessed first- hand growing up in Peru.2 Garcilaso elaborated this perspective in what is the most famous of his four published works, the Comentarios reales de los Incas (Royal commentaries of the Incas) (1609). In the Comentarios, Garcilaso described the Incas' culture and society, and their rise as an imperial power before the Spaniards' arrival in Peru in 1532. He intended the Comentarios to be read as a "history of conquest" (a "cr6nica de Indias"), but with the Incas, not the Spaniards, as its heroic protagonists who had civilized and evangelized the other indigenous groups of Peru, who were helplessly trapped in their barbarism.3 This narrative of Inca conquest encouraged the Renaissance reader to make constant comparisons between the Incas and the Spaniards in their respective roles as conquerors. Like the classical and humanist historians he had read, Garcilaso intended this narrative to function as exemplum.4 Historians used exemplum to teach their readers a lesson from history and to incite those readers to act on that lesson.5 Garcilaso portrayed the Incas as exemplary conquerors, who primarily had 2For a full account of Garcilaso's life, see John GrierVarner, El Inca: The Life and Times of Garcilaso de la Vega (Austin: University ofTexas Press, 1968). 3Garcilaso's description of the Comentarios in his "Preface to the Reader" corresponds to the contents normally covered by a "history of conquest" (cr6nica de Indias): "everything in the Peruvian empire before the arrival of the Spaniards will be clearly and distinctly set down, from the rites of their vain religion to the government of their kings in time of peace and war...." Moreover, Garcilaso positions the Comentarios as an expanded and enlarged version of the Spanish histories of conquest, many of which included descriptions, albeit brief, of the Incas' civilization: "I have fuller and more accurate information than that provided by previous writers .... My purpose is not to contradict them, but to furnish them with a commentary and a gloss."

Garcilaso intended his exemplum to make an implicit contrast with the Spanish methods of conquest, largely based on the epic model, which privileged the immediate exercise of power by means of military force. In contrast with the peaceful Incas, the Spanish epic heroes took pride in their ability to threaten, inspire fear in, and punish the enemy if necessary.6 To represent his very different model of conquest and colonization, Garcilaso manipulated the conventions of humanist historiography, and specifically those of the "history of conquest" genre, which were inherited largely from the epic. Epic narratives in historiography acquired meaning by demonstrating the hero or pro- tagonist's superiority over those he had encountered, thus legitimizing his right to exercise power over them.7 This superiority was often signified by means of con- ceptual binaries, which revolved around the fundamental concept of civilized versus barbarian. One of these conceptual binaries consisted of gender categories, conventional notions of the male as superior, rational, and civilized, and the female as passionate, uncivilized, and hence inferior.8 Histories of conquest, like the epic, often implicitly legitimized conquest by representing it as the natural dominance of male over female.9 To legitimize his alternative model of peaceful conquest in the Comentarios, Garcilaso manipulated the gendered filter, and specifically the conventional male and female subjectivities, by which the "history of conquest" genre generated meaning.1' Garcilaso appropriated his altered paradigm of gender relations from Renaissance Neoplatonic discourse, and specifically Leone Ebreo's treatise on Neoplatonic love, the Dialoghi d'amore (1535). Garcilaso was intimately familiar with this work, having translated it into Spanish and published it in 1590.11 6'Beatriz Pastor, Discursos narrativos de la conquista: Mitificaci6n y emergencia, 2d ed.

Leone conceived of the ideal interaction in a loving relationship between male and female as a constant dialogue, which both persons actively influenced and deter- mined. In his many exempla of Inca conquest in the Comentarios, Garcilaso simi- larly emphasized how the Inca conquerors and the other indigenous groups they had conquered engaged in an ongoing process of dialogue. Garcilaso carefully demonstrated how dialogue not only resulted in successful initial conquests, but also facilitated the long-term loyalty and obedience of the Incas' newly conquered subjects. Garcilaso showed how the Inca conquerors paradoxically exercised con- siderable power over their subjects by treating them as equals, respecting their autonomy, and taking their specific needs into account. This model of conquest directly contradicted the dominant model of epic, in which the male-gendered conqueror exercised power at the expense-by destruction or forceful control-of the female-gendered conquered. The epic model depended upon fixed categories of representation organized in a clearly delineated hierarchy to generate meaning. In contrast, Garcilaso's model of conquest portrayed the constantly evolving dynamic of dialogue between two speaking subjects, in which the boundaries between self and other, male and female, civilized and barbarian were blurred. Garcilaso most likely intended his exemplum of Inca conquest to be read by an educated male Spaniard, one of the many letrados (men of letters) trained in rhetoric and in the studia humanitatis, who often worked within Spain's burgeon- ing imperial bureaucracy.12 The letrados were in the best position to influence the political and economic policies being established by the king and the Council of Indies with respect to Spain's overseas possessions during the course of the six- teenth century.13 Like other humanist historians, Garcilaso expected the Renais- sance reader not simply to read the exemplum, but to identify with its protagonists, and by doing so, vicariously to experience the narrative.14 Garcilaso could assume that his educated reader was familiar with the most widely read Spanish histories of conquest as well as with the classical and Italian humanist histories, which were popular reading in the sixteenth century.15 He knew that this reader was accus- 12Margarita Zamora, Language, Authority, and Indigenous History in the "Comentarios reales de los Incas" (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1988), 9, has this same idea of Garcilaso's intended reader. 13For an explanation of the letrados' role in the Spanish imperial bureaucracy, see Roberto Gonzilez Echevarria, Myth and Archive: A Theory of Latin American Narrative (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), 46-49; and "Imperio y estilo en el Inca Garcilaso," Discurso Literario: Revista de Temas Hispinicos 3, no. 1 (1985): 76-77. 14See Struever, Language of History, 77. 150n the popularity of the classical and Renaissance histories among literate Italians in the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, see Eric W. Cochrane, Historians and Historiography in the Italian Renaissance (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981), 256-58. Editions of these histories similarly multiplied in Spain during the sixteenth century. Moreover, the Spanish histories of conquest were read widely in Spain, and throughout Europe in translation. The ones which Garcilaso had in mind as he wrote the Comentarios included: Hernin Cort&amp;s, Cartas de relaci6n (Letters of report) (1522-25); Pedro de Cieza de Le6n, Crdnica del Peri (Chronicle of Peru) (1553); Francisco L6pez de G6mara, Historia</page><page sequence="5">Heid / Manipulating Gender Identity in the "comentarios reales de los Incas" 97 tomed to identifying with the male protagonists or heroes of these histories. Their identities were configured according to epic conventions, which portrayed the hero as an agent exercising power at will and moving history forward.16 By manip- ulating concepts of gender within his exemplum, Garcilaso provided his intended reader with the experience of identifying with a different kind of male identity, constructed in dialogue and negotiation with another, gendered female. Despite its unconventional nature, this identity would prove satisfying to the Renaissance reader, insofar as it would still allow him to identify with the Inca conqueror's suc- cess in exercising power and acting as an agent. By means of this very subjective experience, Garcilaso made his alternative model of peaceful conquest compelling to his Spanish reader on a personal level.At the same time, he intended to motivate that reader to act on that belief, by promoting this model in discussions about Spain's legal and political policy in the New World, in which the reader likely participated.17 The Incas' conquest of another indigenous group, the Musus, is narrated in book 7, chapter 14, and is one of the many exempla which occur in the Commentarios. In its detailed narrative of the interaction between conqueror and conquered, this exemplum demonstrates the subtle mechanics of Garcilaso's manipulation of gender categories. The narrative displays the typical characteristics of exemplary conquest, one of which is that the Incas conquered not by using force or arms, but rather by rhetorical persuasion: "[The Incas] took the bold step of persuading the Musus to submit and serve the Inca.... And finding that the Musus listened to them willingly, the Incas gave them a fuller account of their laws, privileges, and customs, and told them of the great deeds performed by their kings in past conquests..." (7.14). In Garcilaso's exemplum, the Inca conquerors were consummate orators, whose skillful rhetoric impressed the Musus and persuaded them to voluntarily accept Inca rule: "All this astonished the Musus, who were delighted to receive the friendship of the Incas and to embrace their idolatry, laws, and customs, which they thought good, and promised to be governed by them..." (7.14). The Musus' exercise of free will is a consistent characteristic of Garcilaso's model of exemplary conquest. He depicts conquest as a contract between con- queror and conquered that depends on an active negotiation of power between the two parties. This is explicitly emphasized in this episode; the Musus agreed to general de las Indias (General history of the Indies) (1554);Agustin de Zirate, Historia del descubrimiento y conquista de la provincia del Peru (History of the discovery and conquest of the province of Peru) (1555); and Jose de Acosta, Historia natural y moral de las Indias (Natural and moral history of the Indies) (1590). See Aurelio Mir6 Quesada Sosa, El Inca Garcilaso y otros estudios garcilasistas (Madrid: Ediciones Cultura Hispinica, 1971), 380-84. 16See Quint, Epic and Empire, 29. 17For the connection between exemplum and concrete action, see Struever, Language of History, 77-78.</page><page sequence="6">98 Sixteenth CenturyJournal XXXIII/1 (2002) accept Inca rule, but they actively spoke up to specify the terms of the contract: "[The Musus] did not wish to be recognized as the Inca's vassals, for he had not conquered them and subjected them by force of arms. Rather they were delighted to be his friends and partners, and under the terms of friendship they would do everything incumbent upon them to serve the Inca, but not as vassals, since they wanted to be free as their ancestors had been" (7.14).The Musus not only insisted upon a more equal relationship with the Incas, but they insisted upon a proper sig- nifier of that relationship, the terms "friends and partners" (amigos y confederados) instead of the term "vassalage" (vassallaje). They seemed well aware that words- the labels and rhetoric used to represent actual relationships-were as important as the relationships themselves. Let us pause at this point in the narrative to consider it within the larger con- text of its genre, the history of conquest. Unlike typical Spanish histories, Gar- cilaso's narrative lacks the traditional gendered encoding that would make the action of conquest recognizable to the early-seventeenth-century reader. In the conquest he describes, the site of agency does not reside in a self-directed, male-gendered subject acting upon a passive, female-gendered object. In contrast, that agency only develops as the narrative progresses, in a dialogue between two speaking subjects, where the boundaries between self and other, male and female, civilized and barbarian are blurred. Although the narrative seems somewhat atypi- cal at this point, in the following passage, it concludes in a typical way, with a suc- cessful conquest, which is easily identifiable as such: "Under the terms of this friendship, the Musus let the Incas populate their land... and the Musus gave to them their daughters to be the Incas' wives and they took pleasure in this union, and still today they hold the Incas in much reverence and they allow themselves to be governed by them in both times of war and peace..." (7.14). Here Garcilaso makes clear that the Musus were unmistakably conquered. As Richard Trexler explains, throughout Western history, conquest was often signified by seizing the property of the vanquished and by taking and engaging in sexual relations with the females of the vanquished, who were also considered property.18 Garcilaso makes both of these aspects explicit, and in doing so, highlights the sexual dimension of conquest, which many colonial scholars have ignored in their readings of these his- tories. AsVerena Stolcke explains, "As in all wars, [indigenous] women formed part of the booty coveted by the conquerors.The assault on indigenous women was not simply a matter of pleasure forced from the women of the vanquished; it was a definitive way of sealing the Spaniards' victory through the appropriation of that which, in the conqueror's reasoning, constituted the most valuable possession of the defeated."19 Like many Spanish histories of conquest, the Incas' conquest ends 18See Richard C.Trexler, Sex and Conquest: Gendered Violence, Political Order, and the European Conquest of the Americas (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1995), 15-21. 19Verena Stolcke, "Invaded Women: Gender, Race, and Class in the Formation of Colonial Society," in Women, "Race," and Writing in the Early Modern Period, ed.

The conclusion of Garcilaso's exemplum seems to collapse back into the epic model of conquest. However, a closer examination of the last passage reveals a sig- nificant difference: the subject of the sentence is "the Musus," not "the Incas."The Incas took action only indirectly, because the Musus allowed them to do so. In real- ity, it was the Musus who initiated the union (both legal and sexual) with the Incas. Moreover, Garcilaso reiterates in the final sentence that despite the appearance of the typical relationship between male-gendered conqueror and female-gendered conquered, the Musus and Incas united under the terms of a "friendship," a much more equal power relationship, which seemed to resist the traditional gendered hierarchy otherwise implied. Garcilaso's exemplum posits a paradoxical relationship between conqueror and conquered, which consists of a hierarchy, and yet presumes a more balanced dynamic of power negotiated between them. At the root of this dynamic lies a notion of difference-the difference between conqueror and conquered, which constitutes the former's superiority-distinct from the difference that propels epic narrative forward, and more complicated than the binary conceptual paradigms inherent in epic can adequately represent. We can understand this concept of dif- ference more thoroughly by examining a primary source for Garcilaso's exemplum of conquest, Leone Ebreo's Neoplatonic theory contained in his Dialoghi d'amore (1535). Garcilaso translated this work from Italian into Spanish, and published it as his first work, entitled the Dialogos de amor, in 1590. -k t In the Dialoghi, Leone elaborates a cosmology in which all phenomena-from nat- ural forces such as rain to the biological systems composing the microcosmos of the human body-are based on anthropomorphic interactions between two elements or forces, gendered male and female.20 In every case, Leone, following Aristotle, emphasizes the inherent superiority of the male element over the female, and describes their relationship as a hierarchy. At the same time, however, he empha- sizes their interdependence, and describes the interaction between them as a sym- biosis in which each one perfects the other by providing what she or he is lacking.21 200On the anthropomorphic structure of the cosmos in Leone, see Naomi Yavneh, "The Spiritual Eroticism of Leone's Hermaphrodite," in Playing wuith Gender: A Renaissance Pursuit, ed.

Even more importantly, Filone and Sofia, as literary characters in the work, enact this very dynamic based on hierarchy and symbiosis. At first glance, Filone seems like the dominant interlocutor, the teacher or expert who provides answers to Sofia, the seemingly passive student. However, one soon real- izes that Sofia's thought-provoking questions and articulate objections largely determine the direction and content of their conversation. Moreover, Filone, who is in love with Sofia, uses the dialogue not simply as a means of expressing abstract ideas about love, but as the very mode of interaction by which he hopes to become Sofia's lover. He uses his theory of love to legitimize his own personal amorous pas- sion for Sofia and his attempt to court her within the dialogue. Sofia's intelligent responses allow her to hold her ground in this interaction of courting, resist Filone's verbal advances, and maintain her separate identity.Yet she never rejects Filone as a lover, but continues to engage in dialogue with him, thus fueling his hopes that she may reciprocate his love at some point in the future.22 As literary characters, Filone and Sofia enact an exemplum of the ideal rela- tionship, a dialogic interaction between two people separated by inherent differ- ence, the immutable difference between male and female.23 Garcilaso appropriates their interaction as a model for his exemplum of Inca conquest, which is especially evident in the Musu episode. The notion of conquest as dialogue began to take shape in the narrative when the Inca conquerors did not violently invade the Musu territory, but rather took their first steps toward conquest in a hesitant, respectful way: "The Incas say that when their forces reached this place, they were reduced to only a few, as a result of the many wars they had fought. Nevertheless they took the bold step of persuading the Musus to submit and serve the Inca..." (7.14, my emphasis). Garcilaso continues to describe this process as an interaction, in which the Musus participated as equally active interlocutors. After the Incas' initial speech, in which they explained the myth of their origins, the Incas waited for the Musus' response. Only when they saw that the Musus willingly listened, did they proceed to make their case in more detail: "And finding that the Musus listened to them willingly, the Incas gave them a fuller account of their laws, privileges, and customs..." (7.14). Like Sofia, who poses intelligent objections to Filone's theory, the Musus then objected to the assumption that, in submitting to Inca rule, they would assume the inferior position of vassals. Instead the Musus actively negotiated 220n the balanced, interactive dynamic between Filone and Sofia, see Doris Sommer, "At Home Abroad: El Inca Shuttles with Hebreo," in Exile and Creativity: Signposts, Travelers, Outsiders, Backward Glances, ed.

The Incas could have responded to the Musus' asser- tiveness by using force to conquer them-in sexualized terms, enacting a violent rape-but they refrained from doing this. In contrast, they conceded to them a social and political status, a "friendship," which granted them more freedom and autonomy as Inca subjects.This liberal attitude did not compromise the integrity of the Incas' conquest, which is represented in conventional epic terms as their acquiring both property and women. However, Garcilaso domesticates these terms by emphasizing the Musus as agents, who willingly gave both land and women to form a political (and sexual) union, which they perceived to be beneficial to them. Garcilaso describes this perception on the part of the Musus as an experience of"pleasure," a term he must certainly have adopted from Leone.24 Leone reiterates that pleasure is the binding force in a truly loving relationship.25 The person who is in love and seeks the other's love, usually described by Leone as the male, attracts the female to him by presenting to her his qualities, and essentially reasoning with her. He hopes that, in that interaction, she will be able to perceive his goodness, which will be a pleasurable experience for her. This pleasure, in turn, will ideally cause her to love him.26 Moreover, pleasure precludes the need for the lover to use force or manipulate her, which would compromise the essence of the true dialogue established between them. Only true dialogue, in which each person can freely be him or herself, actively participate from that position, and experience pleasure, will likely lead to uniting the two in a love relationship.27 This relationship, in turn, will provide the two lovers with more pleasure, and cause them to want to interact with one another repeatedly. Leone expresses this cycle of dialogue-pleasure-sexual union-pleasure in the most vivid way possible for the Renaissance reader, in terms of the process of courting or flirtatious interaction between male and female, which leads to heterosexual union.28 The dialogue between the Incas and Musus is similarly characterized by plea- sure. Garcilaso uses the verb "to please" (holgar) three times in the narrative to describe the Musus' experience of being conquered by the Incas--"[the Musus] were delighted (holgaron) to receive the friendship of the Incas"; "[the Musus] were delighted (holgaban) to be his friends and partners"; "[the Musus] took plea- sure (holgaron) in this union." He also makes two other references to the Musus' pleasure: after they listened to the first part of the Incas' speech, "the Musus listened to them willingly" (de buena gana; my emphasis), and after meeting with the Inca ruler himself in Cuzco, "the Musus returned to their own country with great con- 241n DA, variations of the words "delight (deleite)," "enjoyment (gozo)," and "happiness (alegria)" occur repeatedly throughout the work, more times than one could count. 25Filone states in DA, 2:69: "enjoyment and pleasure is the end and the cause of love and desire" (el gozo y la delectaci6n es fin y causa del amor y del deseo). 26Filone outlines this process in DA, 1:103-5. 27Filone describes the dialogue as ideally, but not necessarily, leading to a union of lovers. In his own case, that union depends upon the reciprocal love of Sofia, who resists him throughout the work. He constantly chides her and complains about that resistance, but never advocates forcing the beloved's will, nor does he do that himself. See DA, 2:386. 28See DA, 1:101-2.</page><page sequence="10">102 Sixteenth Century ournal XXXIII/1 (2002) tent" (muy contentos; my emphasis). The Incas' process of conquest was an inter- action based on reasoning and characterized by pleasure, which in turn fueled repeated interaction. In Leone, pleasure allows the love relationship between male and female to develop and continue indefinitely into the future.After two lovers experience plea- sure in sexual union, they will hold a memory of that pleasure, which will cause them to not only repeat that experience, but to strive for even greater intimacy, and thus, more intense pleasure. Leone views the love relationship as a closed cycle of separateness-dialogue-sexual union-separateness, but he views that cycle as repeat- ing itself endlessly because of the experience of pleasure it provides.29 Garcilaso appropriated Leone's never-ending cycle of repeated amorous union as a model of conquest to contest the model based on epic, which was character- ized by closure. Epic narrative relied on closure after the hero's triumph precisely to justify the events, usually a military battle of force, which led to that triumphant conclusion in a linear narrative of causality. In this way, epic forcefully promoted imperialist ideology, which it portrayed as the necessary conclusion, determined by destiny, to a coherent and closed narrative. According to Thomas Quint, authors of "losers' epics" attempted to contest imperialist ideology by emphasizing the open-endedness and contingency of the story they were telling. In contrast to this, Garcilaso proposed a model of conquest which combined the closure typical of epic and the open-endedness normally associated with romance.30 As we have seen, in the Comentarios, Garcilaso portrays the Incas' conquest of the Musus as reaching closure in conventional epic terms. However, this is not the conclusion to his story. Once the Musus became Inca subjects, the Incas main- tained an ongoing dialogue and relationship with them. After the initial conquest, the Musus sent ambassadors to Cuzco to worship the sun-god and to "confirm the friendship and bond of blood between his people and theirs" (7.14). In return, the Inca ruler received the Musu delegates with honor and dignity, and bestowed favors and gifts upon them. Moreover, he educated the Musus in more depth about the Inca laws, religion, and social customs. The initial interaction between conqueror and conquered as a dialogue, characterized by making speeches, teaching, listening, and giving, becomes the pattern for the ongoing relationship between the ruler and his subjects. Garcilaso advocated a model of conquest based on pleasurable dialogic inter- action not simply because that model was more ethical than the epic model of con- quest, based on use of force, but because that model was more pragmatic, insofar as it was more likely to be successful. In the Comentarios, Garcilaso logically presents the links between cause and effect, between specific methods of conquest and the results they produced. His exemplum of the Incas' conquest of the Musus shows how the Incas' liberal treatment of the Musus, which at first glance would seem to 29See DA, 1:93-94, 1:103-4, 2:73-74. 30For more detailed explanation and examples of winners' and losers' epics, see Quint, Epic and Empire, 8-12, 39-41, 45-46, 99.</page><page sequence="11">Heid / Manipulating Gender Identity in the "comentarios reales de los Incas" 103 have compromised their ability to exercise power, in fact produced the opposite effect. According to Garcilaso, the Incas did indeed exercise considerable power over the Musus. Moreover, the model of conquest and colonization as constant, repeated dialogue between a ruler and his subjects guaranteed the Musus' loyalty over the long term. Garcilaso describes how, even after the Spaniards entered Peru, the Musus were still loyal to their Inca rulers (and he uses the present tense to emphasize this): "the Incas say that... [the descendants of the Incas who settled among the Musus] heard that Inca Huaina Capac was dead, that the Spaniards had won the country, and that the empire and sovereignty of the Incas was at an end....and that the Musus still hold [the Incas] in great veneration, and are gov- erned by them in peace and war, as we have said" (7.14). In the next two chapters, Garcilaso continues to emphasize the Musus' long-term loyalty to the Incas by citing the testimony of two Spaniards, who trav- eled toward the Musu territory with a group of conquistadores intending to con- quer them, but failed miserably in their encounters with neighboring indigenous groups on the way there. These two Spaniards, having been taken prisoner by these Indians, learned from them how the Musus had lived under Inca rule.Their version of the story reaffirms Garcilaso's portrayal of the Incas' model of conquest and rule as constant interaction: "[the Spaniards] told how the Incas had settled among the Musus, who had recognized the Inca as their overlord, serving him and sending him many presents of their country's products every year. The sending of these presents continued until the death of Inca Tufpac Amaru..." (7.16). Garcilaso uses the eyewitness authority of Spaniards to emphasize the long-term stability of Inca rule. He tells us how the Musus continued to bring gifts to the Inca ruler, up until the death of Tdpac Amaru, the last Inca to officially ascend the throne, who was executed by the Spaniards in 1572. Although the Spaniards had conquered the Incas in 1532, and had made incursions into the Musu territory, the Musus suppos- edly remained unswervingly loyal to the Incas for forty years, until all hope of a renewed Inca dynasty was extinguished. In her anthropological study, Irene Silverblatt confirms the description of Inca con- quest, colonization, and rule outlined by Garcilaso in the Comentarios. As she explains, the Incas were extremely skillful conquerors, insofar as they maintained considerable control over their subjects precisely by appearing to grant those sub- jects autonomy. By superimposing their own political and economic structures onto existing indigenous structures, the Incas masterfully naturalized their domi- nance over their subjects. As Silverblatt explains, the Incas' manipulation of gender roles was crucial to this process. They subtly established political and economic hierarchies, which motivated subject-peoples to give the daughters of nobles as wives for Inca nobility, concubines for the Inca ruler, or as women destined to live a cloistered life. The giving of women symbolized the subjects' complete submis- sion to the Incas, and yet, at the same time, created the idea of a political relation-</page><page sequence="12">104 Sixteenth CenturyJournal XXXIII/1 (2002) ship based on kinship. The Incas, in turn, capitalized on the idea of kinship to disguise their political and economic hierarchies as a kind of natural family struc- ture. In this way, they represented their exercise of power by means of these struc- tures as altruistic gestures done by a father figure for the benefit of his childlike subjects.31 Garcilaso, fluent in the native language of the Incas, Quechua, most certainly heard descriptions of Inca conquest and rule from his Inca relatives.32 Garcilaso was undoubtedly aware that the Incas' seemingly exemplary model of conquest could merely have been a cover for what was, in reality, a brute-force exercise of power. The many ironic exempla of conquest in the Comentarios, examples of how not to conquer by means of deceit and manipulation, demonstrate this awareness. More- over, Garcilaso had seen the Spanish conquerors enact precisely this kind of con- quest. They disguised their violent and brutal methods, motivated by greed, in the rhetoric of loftier goals, namely civilizing and evangelizing the "barbarians."33 However, Garcilaso, like so many of the clergy involved in Spain's project of evan- gelization, believed that an exemplary conquest based on true dialogue and nego- tiation could be achieved. The Inca Garcilaso did not have an anti-imperialist agenda. He did not call into question the value of the Spanish conquest, which, he believed, had advanced the Incas on the continuum of civilized existence by providing them with a written lan- guage and by converting them to Christianity. Garcilaso, however, did take issue with the specific means and methods by which the conquest was carried out. In this respect, he followed in the footsteps of the most vocal clergyman to protest these methods, the Dominican friar Bartolom&amp; de las Casas.34 Like Las Casas, Garcilaso believed that the Spaniards were both unethical and immoral in their treatment of the Amerindians. He felt this most acutely with regard to his ancestors, the Incas, much of whose advanced civilization the Spaniards had either destroyed or ignored.35 Las Casas primarily argued for change by drawing the Spaniards' atten- tion to ethical and moral principles. In contrast, Garcilaso constructed an even more persuasive argument for his Spanish reader; he advocated an ethical conquest based on dialogue precisely as a means for realizing the imperialist ambitions of many 31See Irene Silverblatt, Moon, Sun and Witches: Gender Ideologies and Class in Inca and Colonial Peru (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1987), xviii-xxix, 40-41, 45-47, 51-52, 72, 86-94, 107-8. 32Garcilaso attests to this himself in RC, 1.15. 33Examples of ironic exempla occur in RC, 2.19, 3.1, 6.30, and they construct a more critical perspective on the Inca conquerors. By means of the resemblances between Inca and Spanish conquerors, Garcilaso uses these exempla to criticize the Spaniards indirectly. 34Las Casa, Brevissima relacidn de la destruccidn de las Indias (Brief description of the destruction of the Indies) (1542), articulated a virulent critique of the Spaniards' methods of conquest of the Amerindians and denounced their false rhetoric of higher purpose. 35In the RC, Garcilaso rarely articulates this critique explicitly, probably for fear that the text would not pass the censors. However, he provides numerous examples of the way in which the Spaniards destroyed all traces of Inca civilization, and encourages his reader to take a critical perspective of these events. A good example is his description of the fortress of Cuzco, in RC, 7.29.</page><page sequence="13">Heid / Manipulatinn Gender Identity in the "comentarios reales de los Incas" 105 Spaniards, who occupied positions of power within the Spanish imperial bureau- cracy. These Spaniards were increasingly concerned with the problems and difficul- ties of the Spanish conquest and colonization as that project matured during the sixteenth century. Because of the Spaniards' mistreatment and exaction of labor, the native populations consistently rebelled against their rule. In his Historia de las Indias, Bartolom6 de las Casas emphasized the amount of money and men waste- fully expended by the Spanish crown to respond to indigenous rebellions in the Caribbean, which, in his opinion, could have been prevented by better treatment of the native population.36 Growing up in Peru, Garcilaso witnessed Inca rebellions against the Spaniards, and constant civil war among the Spaniards themselves as they fought for their fair share of land and riches.37 In the Comentarios, Garcilaso also described in detail the Spaniards' consistent, failed attempts to conquer Chile.38 The Spaniards' method of terrorizing the natives through violence, and after conquest, harshly exploiting them in manual labor, caused the embittered Araucanian Indians there to resist and rebel.The Araucanians executed many Span- iards, including the distinguished Captain Pedro de Valdivia, and greatly frustrated Spanish plans to colonize the area.39 All of these testimonies to failure demon- strated that, although Spain had rapidly dominated large numbers of indigenous peoples by their superiority in military confrontations, they were far less successful as rulers governing those populations over the long term.Their conquests were not substantial, insofar as they never really had conquered the will of those they had forced to live under Spanish rule.40 Garcilaso's readers, well-educated Spanish males, were undoubtedly familiar with these problems. Moreover, many of these readers, Spaniards educated in law, philosophy, and theology, likely held opinions similar to those of Garcilaso with respect to Spain's imperial project. Most defended the conquest and colonization of the indigenous peoples as justifiable goals, but were beginning to question the violent means used to achieve these goals both on ethical and practical grounds.41 Garcilaso offered the many exempla of Inca conquest in the Comentarios, includ- ing the Musu episode, to an early-seventeenth-century reader receptive to alterna- tive methods of conquest. Garcilaso's challenge was to make his exemplary model 36See the popular episode of the Caribbean cacique, Enriquillo, in Bartolome de las Casas, Historia de las Indias, vol. 2 of Obras escogidas de Fray Bartolomd de las Casas, ed. Juan Perez de Tudela Bueso, Biblioteca de Autores Espafioles, 96 (Madrid: Ediciones Atlas, 1957), 480-82. 37See Mark A. Burkholder and Lyman L. Johnson, Colonial Latin America, 3d ed. (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998), 55-58. 38See RC, 7.20-25. 39See Burkholder and Johnson, Colonial Latin America, 61-62. 41/The Musus are one example of several which Garcilaso offers as proof that although the Spaniards may have subdued a group of Indians, they did not necessarily make them into loyal subjects. 41Lewis Hanke, La lucha poer la justicia en la Conquista de Amdrica, trans. Ramon Iglesia (Buenos Aires: Editorial Sudamericana, 1949), 16, describes this growing concern among Spaniards during the sixteenth century as "una lucha por la justicia" (a struggle for justice), and he describes its manifestations throughout his book.</page><page sequence="14">106 Sixteenth Century ournal XXXIII/1 (2002) compelling to that reader. Garcilaso wanted his reader not only to believe that peaceful conquest was an achievable goal, but to act on that belief by influencing legal and political policy with respect to Peru. Focusing on gender categories in Garcilaso's exemplum brings to light the differ- ence between the model of conquest he advocated and that legitimized by other sixteenth-century accounts of the conquest written within the epic mold. More- over, it links us to the probable source of that model of conquest, Leone Ebreo's Neoplatonic philosophy of gender relations. Finally, gender analysis serves as a point of entry for theorizing the pragmatics of Garcilaso's discourse, how his exem- plum might have been interpreted by the early-seventeenth-century reader, and how, in turn, that reader might have responded to it. Garcilaso, like other humanist historians, used exemplum with the assumption that his intended reader would play a very active role in following its inherent nar- rative and extracting the implicit message intended by its author.42 These historians knew that the narrative aspect of exemplum not only maintained the reader's inter- est, but also approximated the sense of real, lived time, creating the illusion that, in reading the narrative, the reader was living the experiences described. They used exemplum to provoke in the reader what Struever calls a "mimetic impulse,"43 whereby the reader would identify with the protagonist or hero, his successes and failures. Moreover, humanist historians assumed that this mimetic experience would change the reader by affecting his real-life perspective and actions, and on a larger scale, would influence the course of real, lived history. As Struever explains: "Following the 'movement' of the narrative engenders movement, moral change in the reader, for who, with such exemplary deeds before his eyes, 'titillante quasi quodam pruritu, ad idem audendum non animetur?' Thus the Humanists are con- vinced that the use of rhetorically instead of logically oriented discourse leads one to reality through illusion...."44 As I have indicated, Garcilaso's intended reader was a Spaniard, who was well educated, and therefore, most likely a male. That reader was undoubtedly well read in the dominant forms of sixteenth-century discourse, not only the histories of conquest, the prose best-sellers of the period, but also lyrical forms such as the Petrarchan sonnet and the blazon. As Louis Montrose explains, in these forms "a masculine writer shares with his readers the verbal construction/observation of a woman or a feminized object or matter; in doing so, he constructs a masculine sub- ject position for his readers to occupy and share."45 We can assume this process also occurred with respect to historical narrative. Garcilaso's intended reader would have been trained and accustomed to reading historical narrative by identifying 42This discussion of exemplum is based on Struever, Language of History, 76-78. 43Struever, Language of History, 77. 44Struever, Language of History, 77-78. 45Montrose, "The Work of Gender," 155.</page><page sequence="15">Heid / Manipulating Gender Identity in the "comentarios reales de los Incas" 107 with the male hero or protagonist, and by mimetically experiencing his trials and triumphs. By means of this process, that reader would come to accept as valid the imperialist ideology represented in the narrative. By mimetically experiencing what seemed to be a "natural" construction of masculine subjectivity, the early-sev- enteenth-century reader would come to believe that the events of the narrative he was reading were similarly natural, ordained by destiny, and hence, legitimate. Tra- ditional gender subjectivities and the reader's tendency to identify with them served as the heuristic vehicle by which imperial ideology was represented and legitimized in historical narrative and epic in the sixteenth century, and by which its problematic ethical and moral aspects were concealed from view. Garcilaso's reader, then, approached the Incas' history of conquest by assuming a masculine subject-position, which he expected to be reaffirmed in a triumphant conclusion. This would be the primary source of the reader's satisfaction, a factor in what initially attracted him to read the text, and what motivated him to continue reading. This is where the Musu narrative led him. In the narrative's conclusion, the early-seventeenth-century reader would have felt gratified to mimetically experience the triumph of the Inca hero. However, as we have seen, Garcilaso modified the process leading toward that conclusion. The reader ultimately would identify with an exercise of power based not on the forceful domination of a fem- inine other, but rather on an interaction with that other, which led to her eventual incorporation into the male conqueror's identity. The conqueror or protagonist established himself not as an all-powerful ruler, as he initially desired, but rather as a friend and partner. The narrative would lead the reader through the construction of an alternative masculine identity, which was inherently paradoxical in its defini- tion. That new male identity signified both the active exercise of power and the restraint from exercising that power at the female other's expense. On the level of pragmatics, the narratives of Inca conquest in the Comentarios pro- vided the early-seventeenth-century reader with an experience of a different kind of male identity. Correspondingly, these narratives modified that reader's concep- tion of the ground from which a male protagonist in history could exercise power and act as an agent. On the level of narrative, Garcilaso redefined successful con- quest as a process based not on inspiring fear in the conquered, but rather on obtaining their consent to be conquered. Moreover, he reiterates this narrative in the many exempla interspersed throughout the Comentarios.Thus, we must inter- pret its meaning as a key to Garcilaso's larger ideological perspective, which ori- ented his discursive project as a whole. On this level, Garcilaso attempted to completely redefine imperialist ideology as an ethical exercise of power based upon mutual negotiation, compromise, and cooperation. As a writer of history, the Inca Garcilaso seemed intuitively to understand the linkage between gendered constructs of subjectivity, historical narrative, and the larger ideology guiding Spain's imperial project. Drawing upon Leone Ebreo's</page><page sequence="16">108 Sixteenth Century ournal XXXIII/1 (2002) Neoplatonic philosophy of love in the Dialoghi d'amore, Garcilaso blurred the boundaries of gender identity within his exempla of conquest as dialogue. In doing so, he allowed the early-seventeenth-century reader to experience a dynamic in which other boundaries-between conqueror and conquered, civilized and bar- barian, superior and inferior-were similarly blurred and rendered meaningless. Garcilaso intended this very different mimetic experience of identity and conquest to compete with those represented in Spanish histories written within the epic mold. Moreover, Garcilaso's intended reader was a letrado, and thus was likely active in the social and political hierarchies of power of Spain's imperial bureau- cracy. Garcilaso intended to exercise influence where it mattered most, in the deci- sion-making processes of educated men like these, who could actively promote and concretely reorient the practices of Spaniards in the New World.The Comentarios urged these readers to promote a peaceful imperialism, in which Spaniards and their indigenous subjects, like Neoplatonic lovers, would engage in an ongoing dialogue and interaction to their mutual benefit and pleasure.</page></plain_text>
