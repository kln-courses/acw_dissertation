Even now, after three centuries of debate on the matter—whether they are noble, bestial, or even as you and I [... ] whether they are bound and we are free, or we are bound and they are free—after all this, we still don't know. —Geertz, The Interpretation of Cultures} One could say that savages are not wicked precisely because they do not know what it is to be good, for it is neither the development of intelligence nor the restraints of laws, but the calm of the passions and their ignorance of vice which prevents them from doing evil. —Rousseau, Discourse on the Origin of Inequality.2 In September 1908, the amateur Czech ethnographer and "adventurer" Alberto Vojtëch Fric (1882-1944) precipitated a furor in German anthropology. Despite hailing from a prominent Prague family,3 Fric had no formal training in ethnography or anthropology, and had long been considered an eccentric, a blowhard, and a conman. But he stoked the anger of his cridcs to new heights when he dared, at the 16th International Congress of Americanists in Vienna, in an era when "colonial expansion expedited the very act of going into 'the field' and provided the very structures for anthropologists' experiences,"4 to speak out against German colonialist abuses of the indigenous peoples of Brazil. As described by H. Glenn Penny, Fric "exposed the degree to which financial limitations and professional goals often guided [ethnographers'] decisions as much as their concerns with 'dying cultures' or their 1 Clifford Geertz, The Interpretation of Cultures (New York: Basic Books, 1973), 345. 2 Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Discourse on the Origin of Inequality (New York: Penguin, 1984), 99. 3 His uncle Antoni'n Fric had served as curator of natural history collections at the Prague National Museum, while his father Vojtëch Fric was deputy mayor of the city.

For present as well at that 1908 congress was a first-time visitor to Europe, a guest Fric had brought back with him from his third trip to South America: a Chamacoco Indian from the Gran Chaco region of Paraguay, named Cerwuis Pioshad Mendoza. In Lomovâ's telling, Cerwuis subverts Fric's very serious speech denouncing German atrocities against Indians in Brazil simply by announcing his presence to the audience. 5 Ibid., 259. Fric took part in what came to be called "salvage anthropology," defined by Penny as "the frenzied effort among anthropologists to acquire as much material culture as possible from areas that they believed would soon succumb to the tide of colonial modernity" (253). 6 Nancy Scheper-Hughes, "Ishi's Brain, Ishi's Ashes," Anthropology Today 17, No. 1 (February 2001): 12. She goes on: "A basic premise guiding 20th-century ethnographic research was, quite simply, to see, hear, and report no evil after returning from the field" (12). For an example of a Westerner contemporaneous with Fric who also reported abuses against South American indigenous populations (for which he was also derogated), see Taussig's account of Roger Casement and his 1911 Putumayo report (Michael Taussig, "Culture of Terror - Space of Death: Roger Casement's Putumayo Report and the Explanation of Torture," Comparative Studies in Society and History 26, vol. 3 [1984]: 467-497). 7 On the latter charge, see Penny, "The Politics of Anthropology in the Age of Empire," 270. It seems clear from multiple sources that Fric mismanaged funds; occasionally disappointed the museums that had sponsored his artifact-gathering forays to South America; and enjoyed attracting attention not only to his causes but also to himself; he fathered a child out of wedlock (possibly without his knowledge) with a Paraguayan woman in 1906. Penny argues, on the other hand, that Fric's outspoken views on the mistreatment of Brazil's indigenous probably influenced debates in that country which liberalized its Indian policies.</page><page sequence="3">History in Czech Comics 83 Over the course of four panels, Lomovâ depicts a bored Cerwuis sitting in the wings, fidgeting, finally looking out on stage as Fric delivers his harangue: and so the German colonists from Blumenau constantly organized new punitive expeditions in which the Indians were brutally slaughtered. In the best case they spared the women and children, whom they dragged to town and gave over for "re-education" in the cloister or with rich families. In honor of the crusaders' return, banquets were held, votive masses were celebrated and they were glorified as heroes.8 Panel five then shows Cerwuis's point of view of Fric's back at the lectern, a hall full of delegates respectfully listening. In the seventh panel, Cerwuis is waving at the audience, which laughs at the absurd spectacle— as an oblivious Fric can only wonder: "I wish I knew what was so funny" (ibid).9 The speaker thanks the audience, as the interloper is led away in the background by an attendant. In this way, the impact of Fric's attack on German colonialism is blunted by a bit of comic stage business, ironically by a representative of the very South American populations under threat. The only vestige of the post-congress furor comes in some dialogue at a reception after Fric's speech—someone says, "He dragged an Indian here with him. This Fric always has to draw attention to himself."—to which the mayor replies, "Yes, well, he's Czech ... Isn't he also a Jew?" (39).10 The story of Cerwuis' (or Cervicek, "little worm," as he was dubbed by Fric's friends), who spent a year in Prague, and had various advenmres and cultural misunderstandings (famously chronicled by Jaroslav Hasek), has gained fresh attention since the 1990s thanks to the re-publication of Fric's writings and the promotion of his life and work by his 8 Lucie Lomovâ, Divost (Prague: Labyrint, 2011), 38. In the original: "a tak nëmecti' osadmci z Blumenau porâdali stale nove' a nove' trestne' vypravy, ktere' indiâny brutâlnë vyvrazd'ovaly.

"No, je to Cech...Neni on taky Zid?" The novel also references Fric's anti-colonialist discourse when, later on, a journal refuses his article due to his "anti-German" attitudes (72) and audience members at a lecture deride his Vienna speech (82).</page><page sequence="4">84 José Alaniz descendants.11 Lomovâ's own treatment of Cerwuis's tragicomic series of events underscores issues of modernity, colonialism and race, yet as demonstrated by the Vienna congress episode, she often smoothes over the more painful aspects of the story to emphasize humor and Cerwuis's humanity, his agency as a subject in a land predisposed to see him as a completely objectified alien. Over and over, Divosi depicts cultural judgment as a two-way street—yet at the same time, it highlights Cerwuis's otherness, particularly when he "performs" the part of primidve tribesman, in full Chamacoco regalia, before awed crowds. As we shall see, these episodes disconcertingly recall the Euro-American practice of displaying exodc "primidves" throughout the 19th century in a bid to explicidy police the borders between "savagery" and "civilization." This paper examines Lomovâ's comics engagement with this fraught historical terrain, seeking to make plain the stakes—historiographical, aesthetic, commercial, comicsological—in play when a "kids'" medium (at least, one long popularly regarded so in the Czech lands) addresses a very adult subject in the process of its own post-Communist bid to "grow up." What do graphic novels12 reveal about the limits of historical writing in comics form and its consumption by a 21st-century Czech readership? To attempt an answer, we must first take a brief excursus into the development of this medium on Czech soil. COMICS IN THE CZECH LANDS: A BRIEF HISTORY13 Despite an anarchic, satirical streak in much of its culture, the country today known as the Czech Republic has historically suffered through a— to say the least—problematic relationship with the medium of comics. Only very recently have Czech comics gradually come onto their own in terms of mainstream acceptance as anything other than a children's diversion. 11 In 2004 Pavel Fric, his grandson, and his wife Yvonna Fricovâ established a charity to benefit the modern-day Chamacoco; see the charity's website at http://www.checomacoco.cz/ . 12 Called kreslené romany or komiksové romany in Czech. 13 This portion of the essay incorporates and reworks portions of José Alaniz, "Introduction: A Czech Patchwork" (Czech Comics: A Symposium), International journal of Comic Art 11, No. 1 (Spring, 2009): 7-20.

Though since the Velvet Revolution, that echo has grown steadily, reassuringly fainter; witness post-communist Czech translations (for a relatively small population of 10 million) of such classics as the American Art Spiegelman's Maus (1986-1991), the British Alan Moore/Dave Gibbons' Watchmen (1986) and even the French semiotician and comics theorist Thierry Groensteen's Système de la bande dessinée (1999); festivals such as the annual Komiksfest in the capital, Prague (since 2006); museum and gallery exhibits of such well-loved authors and artists of the 20rh-century as Jaroslav Foglar (writer of the boy's adventure comics The Sudft Arrows [Rychlé sipy]) and Bohumil Konecny;14 and—not least—a growth in publications, from anthology series such as Crew (launched 1997) and Aargh! (2000), to smaller fanzines and collections (some defunct) like Zkrat and Sweat (Pot). Many classic communist-era works have also been reprinted in the last decade, including Karel "Kâja" Saudek's landmark Muriel and the Orange Death (Muriel a oranzovâ smrt, 1969-70) and Ups Tullian (1972) by Albatros Plus Press. Add to this a variety of independent, self-published and major press original material, from series (Filip Novak/Jan Bazant's Timemaster [Pan casu], the Slovak Branko Jelinek's Oskar Ed) to graphic novels (most auspiciously Jaroslav Rudis/Jaromir 99's Alois Nebel, 2003-2005) to academic studies15 such as Helena Diesing's Saudek! (2009), to such bona fide mainstays of Czech popular culture as the cult political satire strip Green Raoul (Zeleny Raoul) with art by Stëpân Mares and idol-smashing scripts by HRUTEBA (Dan Hruby, Milan Tesar and Tomâs Baldynsky), appearing in the weekly Reflex; and on top of that, a healthy proliferation of websites, forums and blogs, where professional and self-styled critics debate the merits of every new work—and it becomes exceedingly clear that a patchwork Czech comics culture, with many diverse elements, has emerged in all its colorful post-communist splendor. For all that, the public as a whole has hardly embraced the medium (it remains primarily 14 For example, the exhibit "Bimba: Bohumil Konecny's Adventures" was held in 2008-9 at Prague's prestigious Municipal House Exhibition Halls. On a 2007 Brno exhibit devoted to Jaroslav Foglar's 100th anniversary, see José Alaniz, '"Where the White Clouds Sail (100 Years Since the Birth of Jaroslav Foglar)," International journal of Comic Art 10 (Spring 2008): 583-586. 15 The first Czech comics studies conference, "Studia Komiksu, Moznosti a Perspektivy," took place in Olomouc in April, 2011, and was co-organized by the Institute of Czech Literature and funded in part by a state grant for comics scholarship.</page><page sequence="6">86 J osé Alaniz the province of a particular sort of young person) even as the industry has grown.16 Czech comics have a rich history which long predates the communist takeover in 1948, the Nazi occupation of 1939, and even the establishment of the first Czechoslovak Republic in 1918. Readers interested in the details of that history, stretching back to at least the mid 19th century, should turn to the work of Tomâs Prokupek (particularly 2003). Suffice it to say that Josef Lada's strips devoted to childish scalawags, such as The Adventures of Tonda the Kicker (Dobrodruzstvi Tondy Cutala), started in the 1920s; Ondrej Sekora's Ferda the Ant (Ferda Mravenec) (as well as his edgier satirical work for Udové novinj) dating from the 1930s; the aforementioned Foglar and Konecny, whose works extend across the century; and the more adult-oriented "underground" sensibility of Saudek (spawned in the 1960s) all form major constellations in that firmament. Reigniting a sense of pride in that stellar line-up of national talent (as well as all the other shining lights I am leaving out here) seems a central task for a comics culture recently emerged from decades of suppression into a new era of relative freedom and possibility. Though never as suppressed as their Russo-Soviet counterpart,17 Czech' comics in the 20th century fell into disfavor during the communist era, but since 1989 have consistently added to their share of the country's publishing market, even as the form itself has only slowly gained sociocultural "legitimacy." One important approach to establishing comics as a literary form has been through the treatment of historical topics; the locus classicus of this style is Rudis/Jaromir 99's Alois Nebel, which among other things seeks to legitimize the form by linking it quite explicitly to recognizable Czech literary tropes and in particular the historical novel. The trilogy's eponymous hero, a train station attendant (the series' setting, in fact, recalls that of Bohumil Flrabal's 1965 novel Closely Watched Trains [Ostre sledované vlaky]) is consigned to witness the various traumas of 20th 16 Moreover, even boosters of the form don't always do its Czech variant any great favors: Milan Kruml's 2007 Comics: A Concise History (Comics: Strucne' dëjiny) was apparendy too concise; it devotes many pages to American, Western European and Japanese comics, but barely mentions the local fare—and that only in passing, in a discussion of the faux Russian comics Octobriana (a monumental 1970s hoax). For an account of the Octobriana scandal and subsequent communist attacks on comics in Czechoslovakia, see Tomâs Pospiszyl, Octobriana a Rusky underground: Neuvëfitelny pfibëh Petra Sadeckébo (Prague: Labyrint, 2004). 17 For a history of comics in Soviet Russia, see José Alaniz, "Comics During the Soviet Era," chap. 2 in Komiks: Comic Art in Russia (Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2010).</page><page sequence="7">History in Czech Comics 87 century Czech history. As Martha Kuhlman notes, "Rudis' understated protagonist speaks to a new generation of adult Czech comics readers by drawing upon the tradition of folksy anti-heroes (smutné hrdiny) of Czech literature from the works of writers such as Bohumil Hrabal and Jaroslav Hasek."18 The more recent anthology We Are Still At War (Jestë Jsme ve Vâlce [Post Bellum, 2011]), continues this trend, with 13 true stories produced by top industry talents in collaboration with eyewitnesses to various 20th-century traumas, such as World War II and the Communist era.19 In her two graphic novels, Lomovâ as well has chosen to depict Czech history and the current era in terms a contemporary Czech reader will find familiar and "comfortable." Though known for most of her career as an author of children's stories (such as the series Anca a Pepi'k),20 Lomovâ, one of the country's most successful comics artists, in recent years has turned more prominently to mature themes.21 She nonetheless retains a humorous, slyly subversive lightness of tone, enhanced by her accessible artwork (a combination of photorealism and ligne claire)}1 Her first graphic novel, Anna Wants to jump (Anna Chce Skocit, 2006) was the first Czech comics work to receive its initial publication abroad (in France, through Groensteen's Editions de l'an 2; a Czech edition appeared in 2007). In this work, Lomovâ explores modern Czech and Czech-American identity in an age of globalization; the 18 Martha Kuhlman, "Time Machine: Rudis/Jaromir 99's Wilson Main Train Station,"' International journal of Comic Art 11, No. 1 (2009): 63. Rudis elucidates: "I like Hrabal, I like Hasek, and 1 like the idea of these 'small' guys impacting the 'big' world, or being destroyed by this huge world they cannot understand. It's true that Alois Nebel is this small guy, but on the other hand he knows a lot about Czech history" (quoted in Kuhlman, "Time Machine," 70). 19 This book comprises part of Stories of the 2ffb Century (Pnbéhy 20. Stoleti), an ongoing series devoted to the chronicling of eyewitness testimony to major events in Czech history in comics and oral form. 20 Lomovâ began her comics career in 1990 in the children's journal Four-Leaf Clover (Ctyrlfstek). Launched in 1969, with writer Ljuba Stîplovâ and artist Jaroslav Nëmecek, Four-Leaf Clover was the only children's comics approved by the communists after 1968's rollback of liberal reforms. Its naïve art style and straightforward tales of four animal friends who always stand by each other inspired a thousand parodies. 21 See, for example, her story Tyl's Watch (Tylova hh'dka), a satire on modern theater: Lucie Lomovâ, "Tyl's Watch," 3triphurger 52 (November 2009): 17-31. 22 Ligne claire, pioneered by the Belgian artist Georges Remi in the first third of the 20th century, is characterized by, among other things, lines of equal width, minimal or no shadows, simplified facial expressions and detailed backgrounds. Its contemporary practitioners (and adapters) include the Israeli Rutu Modan, the American Chris Ware and the Dutch Joost Swarte.

DIVOSI AND HISTORY In Comic Books as History, Joseph Witek outlines some of the representational peculiarities inherent to comics storytelling, whether fictional or facts-based: An individual comic-book panel conventionally depicts an emblematic moment in time from a representative point in space; one of the principal skills of comic-book narration lies in selecting among the nearly infinite potential choices the effective points and moments to match the thematic movement of the story. Much of the action of a comic-book story takes place between the panels, in the gutters, so to speak, which separate the panels. The pace of the narrative flow depends upon the difficulty of the transitions we are asked, or rather forced, to make, on the amount of bridging material we as readers must supply in moving from panel to panel.25 23 We can profitably compare Anna Wants to jump to a number of recent Czech films that cover similar ground (and share some of its flaws): Uttle Girl Blue (Tajnosti, d. Alice Nellis, 2007) and Up and Down (Horem pâdem, d. Jan Hrebejk, 2004). But Lomovâ's novel departs sharply from those cinematic works in several respects, such as its whimsical tone; transatlantic scene changes; and streak of magical realism. It also has a surreal "cameo" by Vaclav Havel himself. 24 A member of the arts group Fred Brunold's Monster Cabaret [Monstrkabaretu Freda Brunolda], Masek collaborated with the cultural anthropologist Markéta Hajskâ and Romany linguist Mâsa Borkovcova on "Negotiated Stories" (Vyjednâvané Pribëhy, 2008-2010), a project organized by the civic organization Asta smé and supported by the European Cultural Foundation, to recount the comics-biographies of three Romany living in the Czech Republic.

Comics carries with it an additional visual layer (panels, gutters, page design) along with its textual-rhetorical mode, but to a degree the ideological or "moralizing" dimension mentioned by Witek applies to all historical narratives (historical events told as stories, or stories based on historically-grounded material), as argued by Hayden T. White: [Njarrativity, certainly in factual storytelling and probably in fictional storytelling as well, is intimately related to, if not a function of, the impulse to moralize reality, that is, to identify with the social system that is the source of any morality we can imagine.26 In other words, narratives about the past (i.e., the past narrativized) reconstruct historical material (however haphazardly recorded or preserved) so that it makes sense based on pre-set narratival or plot based structures. By "makes sense" I mean not only that—like a Hollywood historical epic—they tell a pleasing, stream-lined and well balanced story, but that in addition they starkly reflect a particular and coherent ideological point of view recognized (and condoned) by their readers. Witek and White's arguments about the constructedness of historical narratives (including in comics form) are important reminders of how readers are all but wired, as it were, to see the past as a story, i.e., in terms that make ideological sense to them, and that they respond the most favorably and unexaminedly27 to constructed historical narratives that present familiar or at least unobjectionable moral values.28 26 Hayden T. White, "The Value of Narrativity in the Representation of Reality," in On Narrative, ed. W. J. T. Mitchell (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981), 14. 27 Emphasizing the unconscious, presumed nature of ideology's consumption, Slavoj Zizek expounds on the matter this way: "[0]ne of the fundamental stratagems of ideology is the reference to some self-evidence—'Look, you can see for yourself how things are!' 'Let the facts speak for themselves' is perhaps the arch-statement of ideology—the point being, precisely, that facts never 'speak for themselves' but are always made to speak by a network of discursive devices" (Slavoj Zizek, introduction to Mapping Ideology, ed. Slavoj Zizek (New York: Verso, 1995], 11, emphasis in original). 28 As White further argues: "[T]he very distinction between real and imaginary events, basic to modern discussions of both history and fiction, presupposes a notion of reality in which 'the true' is identified with 'the real' only insofar as it can be shown to possess the character of narrativity" (White, "The Value of Narrativity," 6).</page><page sequence="10">90 José Alaniz Lomovâ's Divosi, published at the beginning of the second decade of the 21st century, tells its story (must tell its story) very differendy from what would have been possible (and welcomed) some 100 years before, when the events it describes actually took place. First and foremost, the very disdnct atdtudes in modern Europe to such issues as race, colonialism and white privilege (compared to what they were a century ago, in the age of empire) colors Lomovâ's entire aesthedc and ethical approach to her subject. Further-more, Lomovâ's adherence to a recognizable Franco-Belgian model of comics storytelling (aimed at a mainstream Francophone audience with a long bandes dessinées tradition) governs not only her decisions regarding pacing, panel size, page design, even the thickness of lines, but also the representation of racial otherness with what seems a studied "neutrality," the avoidance of offense. These and other factors make Lomovâ's graphic novel very much of its era: ethnically sensitive, politically liberal, meticulously researched, complacently even-handed to a fault. This does not mean the work lacks politically problematic elements in its treatment of the past, even as it tries very hard to render its white and non-white protagonists fundamentally "equal" as human beings. What interests me most is how this semi-fictional graphic novel—in Lomovâ's words, a "kind of hypothesis, how it all could had happened"29—rearranges, compresses, redacts the historical record, and on what basis. Divosi begins in 1908, with Fric's third trip to Gran Chaco, where he discovers that the Chamococo are enduring a deadly epidemic which has already killed several of their number. He quickly sets out to cure the disease, and at a fireside meeting gives tribal elders common-sense advice on hygiene practices to contain the epidemic. Unable to cure Cerwuis, he brings him along to the South American cities that form stops for his eventual return home to Europe. Ultimately, with no medical help available in Buenos Aires, Fric elects to take Cerwuis back to Prague with him. The rest of the novel shows the two men as the paradigmatic odd couple: Fric the scientist and statesman, trying to accommodate his guest's needs and assuage his confusion in an alien culture; Cerwuis as the superstitious but wily "primitive" who, despite some hilarious misapprehensions of the law, comes to understand and even exploit "civilized" European mores. These two "opposites" converge in collaboration during Fric's lectures on South American natives, in which Cerwuis in full Chamacoco regalia appears as Exhibit A. After a year, Fric returns Cerwuis to his homeland, where his far-fetched claims about 29 Lucie Lomovâ, e-mail message to the author, April 23, 2011.</page><page sequence="11">History in Czech Comics 91 the Old World tragically lead not to notoriety but to his expulsion from Chamacoco society. Lomovâ tells this story through a stately ligne claire style that adheres to three-tier modular layouts throughout. The relatively minor variation in panel size lends the work a respectful, if rather homogenizing, tone; for example, panels on facing pages, one showing Fric in bed, recovering from pneumonia, in medium shot (102) and another showing Cerwuis in long shot on the frozen Vltava river (103) are roughly the same size. In part the minimal panel variation owes to the enormous amount of material Lomovâ fits into the novel's 140 pages; stylistically and politically, it also happens to reflect a familiar type of mainstream Franco-Belgian graphic narrative.30 For similar reasons, and with similar effect on the reading experience, action-to-action panel transitions predominate; only occasionally do we see moment-to-moment panel sequences, as when Cerwuis espies his home after a year away (132) or the aforementioned episode when Cerwuis fidgets in his chair offstage.3' The tranquil "evenness" of time is enhanced, again, by the work's architectonic design: repeated events (lectures, fisticuffs, receptions, museum visits, dinner table conversations) all seem to last about the same amount of panels or pages; most strikingly, Cerwuis's journey away from home and his return trip both consume exactly 15 pages. Finally, Lomovâ seems to intuitively avoid a common trap that can beset historically-based comics stories. As described by Witek: The placement of words and dialogue on the page is one of the inescapable problematics of sequential art narration, and in the creator's rush to present information in a history comic the words can get out of hand. Comic pages which attempt to present a great deal of verbiage in a limited space can deteriorate into panel after panel of talking heads intoning blocks of exposition at each other.32 This never happens in Divosï, instead, the word balloons contain fairly concise dialogue tailored to the event at hand (rather than delivering plot exposition), while captions are almost always limited to announcing the 30 As contrasted, for example, with the formal experimentation of David В., Lewis Trondheim and other artists at one point linked with the independent French publisher L'Association. 31 For definitions of action-to-action and moment-to-moment panel transitions and their impact on the comics reading experience and reading speed, see Scott McCloud, Understanding Comics (Northampton, MA: Kitchen Sink Press, 1993), 70-81. 32 Witek, Comic Books as History, 79.</page><page sequence="12">92 José Alaniz place or year of action.33 Only on the final page does a set of capdons announce details of Cerwuis and Fric's deaths, in the most neutral language. For all its "docudrama" poetics, however, Divosi picks and chooses the content and manner of representation, shaping the reader's understanding of the past along ideological lines. In what follows I trace some of the novel's chief themes and sites of emphasis, keeping in mind White's assertion that, "every narrative, however seemingly 'full,' is constructed on the basis of a set of events which might have been included but tvere left out."M Firstly, Lomovâ takes as one of her main concerns the notion of white privilege, often expressed by Fric and others as paternalism or simply racism, whether in presuming the superiority of European customs and culture to those of South America, or in making major decisions for Cerwuis without his input. For example, when Fric originally tries to book passage on a steamer to return Cerwuis back to his tribe by himself, the vessel's corpulent captain objects, insisting he can allow the Indian aboard unsupervised "only in a cage." Fric replies (with Cerwuis behind him but silent), "When I meet people like you, I feel ashamed to be white. It's you who belong behind bars!"35 Yet Fric himself sees nothing untoward in telling his companion, "Don't worry, Cerwuis. I've already decided. You're coming with me to Europe!" (29, my emphasis).36 Such casual, unexamined paternalism, while less overtly repugnant than the captain's blatant racism, operates in more insidious and pervasive ways throughout the novel: in deciding what and how Cerwuis can eat, whether or not he can beg on the streets, and how in general to deport himself. Cerwuis mostly accepts his passive role, deferring to his hosts in areas related to the social customs of Europeans—but worse than this, the times when he does seek to exert his own agency the novel depicts him as a disruptive force, whether scuffling with the Viennese mayor and openly questioning the sexual probity of a duchess (40-41), or growling 33 Lomovâ also avoid another potential pitfall of history comics, as described by Bert Hansen in his survey of American comics medical histories from the 1940s: "By the very nature of comic strip art, the heroism had to be dramatized. We were presented with people in action and were given striking tableaux. Even when sitting alone and still, a person in a comic frame could be undergoing a change."

In other words, Divosi depicts its one main non-white character as in need of policing, "for his own good." Mosdy, such episodes form the main motif for the novel's humor— and in a recognizable formula at that. Cerwuis often appears in sharp contrast to his serious-minded, goal-oriented European "handlers" as a rogue element consumed with his own business in the periphery of the frame. For example, while an enraged Fric seeks out his nemesis Enrique Stanko Vrâz on a Prague street, Cerwuis examines a button he has purloined from a tram attendant (90). (Fie maintains a collection of stolen "souvenirs.") Such episodes recall nothing so much as the very similar antics between Tintin and his canine companion Snowy, the immortal heroes of Georges "Hergé" Remi (1907-1983), father of the Franco Belgian comics school. To pick one of many such instances from the Tintin series (itself known for stereotypical treatment of non-white races), early in the story "The Broken Ear" (1935-37), our boy detective hero focuses on finding clues in a murdered man's room so as to advance the plot, while Snowy the dog independendy stumbles on a memento mori skull, wincing back in fright—an "extraneous" piece of stage business aimed at eliciting a laugh.37 Divosi similarly constructs Fric as the radonal, driven agent and Cerwuis as the "second class" figure easily distracted by his environment.38 Despite such disparities, Lomovâ seeks to maintain a measured equality between her two main figures, through parallelism in their adventures or outright doubling of their portraits on the page. The very tide Divosi ("Savages") is a facet of this theme; as the French edition's back cover puts it, "neither one nor the other can any longer find his proper place, having become inassimilable, 'savages' in their respective * &gt;&gt;39 societies. Moreover, the two protagonists' identifies "overlap," something visually marked throughout the plot. Early in the story, as Cerwuis is taking his first steps into Western civilization in Asuncion, he cowers in fear at an unfamiliar structure, a staircase, as Fric encourages him (24). 37 Hergé [Georges Remi], The Adventures of Tintin: The Broken Ear (London: Mammoth, 1998), 4. 38 At one point, as Fric, Cerwuis and others sleigh through the streets of a provincial town advertising an upcoming lecture, a brown dog—a haunting association with Snowy—mns alongside (94). 39 "[N]i l'un ni l'autre ne pourront plus trouver leur juste place, devenus inassimilables, 'sauvages' par rapport à leurs tribus respectives."</page><page sequence="14">94 José Alaniz Exactly 100 pages later, a deathly ill Fric struggles up the same stairs as Cerwuis urges him on, this time on the pair's journey back to Paraguay (124). In Prague, Cerwuis lances a fish in a river and howls in triumph, his ecstatic face in close-up. Juxtaposed with this panel is a close-up portrait of Fric, who has just gotten some good news related to the acceptance of his artifacts by a museum (108). In such moments, Lomovâ portrays the pair as complements no less than "doubles" of each other: in the aforementioned example, Cerwuis is bare-chested, wearing white underwear as he sloshes in the water, while Fric wears a white shirt; Cerwuis has wide-open eyes, Fric's eyes are closed; Cerwuis bursts with a native "Uââââ!!!" as Fric belts out a Czech/pan-European "Hurâ!!!!", and so on. More importantly, these double-portraits across panels, which appear with some frequency, cement the novel's theme of a basic humanity—even more, a shared sense of self—between the New and Old World heroes, made visible through the medium's sequential pictorial language, its simultaneous mapping of time onto space (plot progression) and over-arching graphic design (visual elaboration of theme, among other uses); not for nothing has Charles Hatfield termed comics an "art of tensions": [Tjhere is always the potential to choose: between seeing the single image as a moment in sequence and seeing it in more holistic fashion, as a design element that contributes to the overall balance (or in some cases the meaningful imbalance) of the layout.40 Lomovâ exploits this double-valence of the form to further her 21st century vision of two men who, in their own time and cultures, would have been seen as anything but equal. Humor in a Hasekian vein also serves as a means for bridging this gap between worlds—or at least laughing at it. Thus cultural misunderstanding, how Fric and Cerwuis make out the blind spots in each other's societies, emerges as another major theme, one obviously rich in comic potential. As mentioned, Divosi goes so far as to provide its own version of the events on which Hasek based his story "The Indian and the Prague Police" (Indian a prazskâ policie):41 Cerwuis mistakes a toll-taker at a tunnel near Vysehrad for a beggar and refuses to pay him a second time on his way back. A fight 40 Hatfield, Alternative Comics, 52, emphasis in original. 41 Hasek himself, a friend of Fric, also appears in the novel, in a brief cameo. The author also wrote another story based on Cerwuis's visit to Prague, "Story About an Indian" ("Indiânskâ povidka").</page><page sequence="15">History in Czech Comics 95 ensues, and when police officers intervene, wearing Austro-Hungarian era hats decorated with black feathers, Cerwuis takes them for "wizards" (kouzelnici). They overpower and arrest him, but the Chamacoco takes their feeding him as a sign of his victory over them; when Fric comes to retrieve him, he sings a victory song that drives the officers mad, so they release him.42 Though Lomovâ's version of this episode differs little in its details from Hasek's—in which Cerwuis extols the "luxury" of his jail cell and the "silver bracelets" (handcuffs) they give him; he calls the policemen "great chiefs" (kabâty), not wizards; and the "red-skinned" foreigner in general seems much more "hot-blooded" and aggressive—her choice to make Cerwuis tell it from his perspective (in a "cartoony" flashback) makes him both more and less sympathetic. More, because the reader comes to understand how he views the alien world of Prague, through words and pictures that ironize each other; less, because the "cutesy" cartoon exposition (with no panel borders) renders the events trivial and buffoonish; Lomovâ exaggerates the effect with excessive motion lines, as if the action were taking place during an earthquake (69). Furthermore, Cerwuis does not get to tell his story entirely by himself; in word balloons extending from off-panel, Fric provides annotations to his companion's more obscure distortions, for the benefit of the police (ibid). Fric, in other words, serves as a mediator (and, if you will, colonizer) of Cerwuis's speech. This approach, in effect, reproduces Hasek's Eurocentric—and slighdy racist—portrait of Cerwuis as a sort of clueless "redman" clown who loves the "great chiefs" who incarcerated him: "The Prague police has, in that Indian, their greatest fan" (580).43 The final theme of Divosi I wish to examine is performance. This seems by far the most ideologically freighted, given the troubling European history of dehumanizing, pseudo-scientific displays of "primitive" peoples, as discussed below. But intriguingly, Lomovâ presents Cerwuis from his first appearance (long before he and Fric go on the scientific lecture circuit in Bohemia) as a specifically theatrical spectacle; performance of one sort or another appears built into his character. (Even the flashbacks he narrates, like the one referenced above, have a very "stagy" quality.) Cerwuis initially approaches Fric at Gran Chaco, to propose that he go with him down the river to see the "mighty white magicians" (mocni 42 Jaroslav Hasek, Milan Jankovic, and Radko Pytlik.

Yet, like so often in this graphic novel, the manner in which Cerwuis is visually portrayed appears to undermine his agency as a fully empowered subject. He first appears in the third of a series of panels, as a silhouette in the morning light outside Fric's tent. (Fric is wakened; the logic and direction of the art in these panels almost suggests that the European has "dreamed" the South American into existence. Cerwuis's shadow is in fact seen through Fric's point of view.) In the fourth panel, we see Fric's hand draw back the tent flap to reveal Cerwuis,44 in his native dress (grass skirt, feathered head-dress) (19). All these details elicit a theatrical effect.45 The dramaturgic tenor of Cerwuis and Fric's relationship is carried through in their interactions in public, as when they scuffle on a Prague street over Cerwuis's desire to beg and busk for a living before crowds of onlookers (46-47; 51-52). Cerwuis's cunning when he plays the "role" of exotic alien is made plain by the song he sings before his paying audiences; while they remain ignorant of its lyrics, the Paraguayan's up tempo ditty in fact says, in his native Chamacoco, "So give me some money / money for sausages / they must be delicious / and I'm so hungry." Cerwuis sings this beggar's tune with a smile and a dance, as unknowing Czechs drop coins before him (51). (We already know Cerwuis can entertain a crowd, from his impromptu European "premiere" on stage in Vienna.) Moreover, much of Divosi consists of Fric and Cerwuis on the lecture circuit, anticipating their ticket sales, worrying about the advertising for their presentations and sabotage by rivals, and counting up their takings after the events. We thus have repeated glimpses of their performances, which become decidedly less scientific and more "edutainment"-friendly as the novel progresses. Cerwuis even develops some preferred "laugh lines": when asked by audience members what he likes most about the Czech lands, he invariably answers, in his elaborate native dress and to the delight of the crowd, "Your pork knuckles" (93). 44 This exact action and angle is repeated some 70 pages later, when Fric parts a curtain to see Cerwuis on the street outside, astounded by his first glimpse of snow (92). 45 Tellingly, Fric immediately forgets Cerwuis's name (he has to ask him again, even though the latter already introduced himself) and once he agrees to take on the native, Fric's first line is, "Well, Cerwuis, it's not a bad idea. But you must promise me that you will, in everything, absolutely everything and at all times, obey me!" (No, Cerwuisi, neni to spatny napad. Ale musel bys mi slibit, ze më budeS ve vsem, uplnë ve vsem a vzdycky poslouchat!) (19). Apart from the colonialist overtones, the dialogue has the tone of a director giving instructions to an actor.</page><page sequence="17">History in Czech Comics 97 No scene better illustrates Lomovâ's "theatrical" approach to this material than the climactic episode in which Cerwuis enacts a batde with the Chamacoco's rival tribe, the Tumraha, for a sold-out lecture hall. As Cerwuis speaks and the plot thickens over four pages, the entire color scheme changes from the red of the curtains to varying shades of blue of the South American night, and Lomovâ deviates from the novel's accustomed three-der layout to one of four ders, with up to nine panels of varying shapes per page. This considerably speeds up the tempo and builds suspense. Though one wonders how Cerwuis could have learned to speak Czech so well so quickly, the native's words seem to actually bring the Paraguayan jungle into the space, along with his fellow tribal warriors, their enemies, their batde implements, the moon. One image even shows a Chamacoco violendy felled by a Tumraha spear, the background suddenly burning blood red (113). As the batde crescendoes, a panel shows Cerwuis's face as an iconic mask not dissimilar to those seen earlier at the Naprstek Museum's ethnographic collection, as he spies, in the middle of some phantasmagoric bush, Fric's nemesis, Vrâz. (Vrâz is in fact attending the performance, intent on mischief.) In an extraordinary, time-and-space warping series of panels, Cerwuis seizes the pordy, middle-aged Vrâz, holds him up over his head as the Chamacoco-Tumraha war rages on all around him. At last, Cerwuis, with a sneer, gives in to Vrâz's panicked entreaties to put him down—he crudely plants him back in his seat. "And that's the war with the Tumraha," he tells the audience, once more in front of the red curtain, lights up, to thunderous applause. Vrâz, humiliated, leaves in a huff (114—115).46 The "tribal war" scene is Lomovâ's most formally inventive, for the subtle and exhilarating way it elevates the power of oral storytelling; Cerwuis "literally" brings an alien world to life in all its richness and danger, through nothing but his speech and body language. It is in a very potent way the heart of the novel: the part that proves Cerwuis's fundamental humanity as an artist and human being. All of which makes more disconcerting how this scene smoothes over and normalizes the vexed history of "indigenous peoples" displays in Europe. As noted by Nigel Rothfels, the popularity of "people shows" (as they were sometimes called) accelerated in the latter half of the 19th century, with one 1881 Paris exhibit of "Tierra del Fuegians" drawing more than 50,000 visitors on one Sunday alone. A blend of scientific and 46 Lo mo va's rearrangement of historical chronology has Vraz in Prague in 1908 1909, whereas the real Vrâz was in fact on a South American expedition at this time.</page><page sequence="18">98 José Alaniz prurient display, the best-attended shows focused on "primitive peoples" who could be presented as "evolutionary ancestors of modern Europeans," a view promoted at one time by, among others, Rudolf Virchow, chair of the Berlin Anthropological Society.47 A number of these shows had a strong dramatic component, whereby the native peoples would enact their daily life rituals and habits—the more exotic and "shocking" the better to confirm their otherness, reinforcing the boundaries of European civilization. In one 1853 London show, a group of "Zulu Kaffirs" acted out nuptial ceremonies, a hunt and a war party "with great fervor." As one reviewer remarked, "the whole ends with a general conflict between rival tribes," to the delight of the crowd.48 These dramatic spectacles, in short, enacted in flesh and blood the colonialist worldview and cultural/racial hierarchy of the age of imperialism. Cerwuis's performance should be understood in this context; his delight in amazing the audience, in recreating the South American jungle on a Prague stage, amounts to a kind of minstrelsy confirming colonialist preconceptions of "the savage." As in the then-novel technology of cinema, the paying audience could gaze at the "primitive" from the safety of its cushioned seats; the native dances for you, tells jokes, transports you, might even lift you up over his feathered head—only to plant you safely back in your chair. Divos?s 21 "-century refusal to problematize the nature of Cerwuis's performances—in fact, to make his most dramatically appealing one the heart of the novel, because after all Cerwuis "chooses" to do all this willingly—reaffirms more than it should the old, antiquated, familiar structures of imperialism. Conclusion: Doing Your Duty As Hillary Chute argues in her discussion of Art Spiegelman's holocaust comics memoir Maus, "(T]he graphic narrative is a contemporary form that is helping to expand the cultural map of historical representation. Its expansive visual-verbal grammar can offer a space for ethical 47 Nigel Rothfels, "Aztecs, Aborigines and Ape-People: Science and Freaks in Germany, 1850-1900," in Freakeiy: Cultural Spectacles of the Extraordinary Body, ed.

The question, as always, depends largely on what an author chooses to emphasize, what to ignore, and the values governing such aesthetic and politically-charged decisions. In a recent article on a still-understudied aspect of the medium, Suzanne Keen speculates on how narrative empathy might be most effectively communicated, even accepted as a call to altruistic action, by comics readers: Narrative empathy may enhance the illusion of immersion in a fictional world by deepening the felt connection of the reader with the imaginary denizens of the narrative, without persuading that reader to take action in the real world. It is not yet known whether these possibilities, the immersive and the other-directed responses, constitute alternatives that rarely coexist, or complementary effects that enhance narrative impact. We may hypothesize that the deeper the immersion and the stronger the empathetic connection, the greater the chance of prosocial responding. Or, we may predict the opposite—the deeper the immersion in a fictional world and the stronger the empathy for the characters, the weaker the connection to any real-world situation may be.51 It seems very much the case that Divosi, part of a larger trend to recuperate and retell the story of Alberto Vojtëch Fric and Cerwuis Pioshad Mendoza for a new generation of Czech and European readers, is intended to sensitize those readers to some degree to the troubling aspects of that history (the racism, colonialism, power asymmetry of empire), as well as celebrate ethnic and racial differences previously 49 Hillary L. Chute, '"The Shadow of a Past Time': History and Graphic Representation in Mans" in A Comics Studies Reader, ed. Jeet Heer and Kent Worcester (Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 2009), 352. 50 Hillary L. Chute, Graphic Women: Life Narrative and Contemporary Comics (New York: Columbia University Press, 2010), 5. 51 Suzanne Keen, "Fast Tracks to Narrative Empathy: Anthropomorphism and Dehumanization in Graphic Narratives," Suh-stance 40, no. 1 (2011), 144.</page><page sequence="20">100 José Alaniz devalued, in part by depicting Cerwuis as a mostly inoffensive, smiling Chamacoco who never really challenges the categories in which history has placed him.52 Cerwuis, in other words, appears as one of Homi Bhabha's "authorized versions of otherness": a colonized figure who returns to the colonizer's gaze what the latter expects and demands to see. Despite the morally ambiguous nature of such a figure, it may indeed further raise awareness, inspire some readers to learn more, donate to the Fries' charity for the current denizens of the Gran Chaco. Alternadvely, as Keen surmises, the reader might go no further than enjoy the immersive pleasure of Lomovâ's text, feel he has "done his duty" as a compassionate person, and place the book back on the shelf. I submit that the latter outcome is more likely if the portrayal of sameness/otherness follows a familiar (by now trite) Rousseauan dichotomy, whereby "the savage man lives within himself, whereas the citizen, constantly beside himself, knows only how to live in the opinion of others."53 To the extent that "the savage" in the work behaves precisely as we expect him to, based on our legacy of Western imperialism but, even more so, on our current values informed by an enlightened racial sensitivity, the reader is never dislodged from a certain comfort zone beyond which he might be moved to "prosocial responding." On the other hand, a "savage" portrayed as a complex, unpredictable figure—and here comics, with its dual discursive mode for effecting complex fictional selves can serve a valuable function—has a greater chance of effecting the "altruistic" empathetic response Keen would seem to welcome. Divosi's Cerwuis in this sense recalls the "noble savage" portraits of indigenous peoples and Native Americans produced by the Czech illustrator Zdenëk Burian (1905-1981). They are beautiful, meticulously researched, pleasing to the eye; Burian was conscientious and hardly without talent. My problem with them is not that they are a white man's vision of non-white peoples (though they certainly are that). Rather, it is that they are respectful, ennobling, idealized, stiff. Like the figures in his Bushmen (Krzovâci, 1975), they resemble posed mannequins on a diorama 52 We can compare this approach (negatively, I believe) to the aforementioned 0 pfibjehi trilogy by Markéta Hajskâ, Misa Borkovcovâ a Vojtëch Masek, focused on telling the first-person accounts of various members of the Roma community in the Czech Republic as a means of addressing contemporary racism, xenophobia and stereotypes. 53 Rousseau, Discourse on the Origin of Inequality, 136.</page><page sequence="21">History in Czech Comics 101 stage: legible and hollow.
