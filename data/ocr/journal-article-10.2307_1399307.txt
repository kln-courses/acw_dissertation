But a name is not only the challenge to act in conformity with a social paradigm, it is also the imperative to follow the social limitation expressed by the name. Names create both bondage and duty. During Confucius' lifetime, Chinese society was faced with the decay of the old social hierarchy, by the appearance of usurpers and despots. As a consequence, names were abused through the actions of corrupt individuals. Thus a discrepancy between name and prescribed role arose. This is why Confucius postulated cheng ming as the rectification of names/designations. Ch'eng ming is described as the pre-stage of cheng ming. Turning to the second of the questions mentioned above, Gassmann points out the congeniality of Confucius' cheng ming postulate with the Ch'un-ch'iu annals. Defining the position of the Ch'un-ch'iu in the Con- fucian tradition, he explains this work as a codified postulate for ch'eng ming (realizing the name). Thus it should be taken as much more than a mere composition of event descriptions. Assuming the existence of various other Ch'un-ch'iu works besides the Confucian Ch'un-ch'iu, Gassmann compares the Tso-chuan, Kung-yang, and Ku-liang commen- taries with respect to the different degree of ritual-name codification included or expressed by them. The Book of Theodicy: Translation and Commentary on the Book of Job. By Saadiah ben Joseph AI-Fayyumi. Translated from the Arabic with a Philosophic Commentary by L. E. Goodman. Yale Judaica Series, volume 25. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1988. Pp. xvii + 481. $75.00. Reviewed by Michael Myers Washington State University Philosophy East &amp; West If comparative philosophy is at its best when it addresses relevant philo- sophical issues within a context of tradition, especially a tradition of text and commentary, then The Book of Theodicy is comparative philosophy most excellent. This is so whether or not it succeeds in its argument. The context of The Book of Theodicy is the Book of Job as it is found in the Biblical, and especially the Jewish, tradition. The medieval philoso- pher Saadiah ben Joseph (882-942) translated Job into Arabic and pro- vided a commentary for his audience at Sura, Babylon. Philosopher and Arabist L. E. Goodman translates Saadiah's work into English for the mod- ern reader and provides his own notes and "philosophic commentary." The route of the translations is extremely interesting, for there is evidence for parallel, rather than simply branching, traditions of the story of Job. There is a verse tradition in Swahili, for example, as well as eight Koranic references. (See J. W. T. Allen, Tendi (New York: Africana Pub- 370</page><page sequence="2">lishing Corporation, 1971), and Marvin H. Pope, The Anchor Bible: Job (New York: Doubleday, 1973). Both the Swahili and the Koranic versions are probably branches of an ancient Semitic version; but Sumerian, Akkadian, and Babylonian versions have also been found. Job is one of the oldest of stories. Goodman borrows Saadiah's method of providing a running exegeti- cal commentary on the text. His synthetic approach is at once the source of the major strength and the major weakness of the book. The attempt to elicit a meaning from the Book of Job as a whole makes possible the enterprise of theodicy. As philosophy, the theses of God's omnipotence and omnibenevolence must be seen as consistent with the suffering of innocents. But Goodman's theodicean argument fails, because the mean- ing elicited is too narrow. Goodman takes pains to argue for the importance of the poetic dia- logue of Job over against the prose prologue and resolution of the story. At the same time, Goodman, after Saadiah, attempts to "resolve" the poetical figures, presuming that "the plain referential sense ... will stand on its own, independent of the poetic element, which is construed as an embellishment rather than as constitutive to the core of meaning" (p. 171). This means that, in practice, the entire system of associations built up through divine metaphor is jettisoned. Goodman's hermeneutic pre- sumes divine attributes and activities to be either vacuous or literal. If literal, they are rightly attacked as "anthropomorphic." But the conclu- sion that they are vacuous leads to a Spinozistic monism. Hence, Good- man parts company with Saadiah and rabbinic tradition and refuses to provide for even the possibility of an afterlife. For Goodman, theodicy is achieved, not through what he pejoratively refers to as "restitution," but through the attempt to show that nature must provide for acceptable goodness in this life. If this sounds familiar, it is, for it is an echo of the arguments of Job's "comforters." But the question of the goodness of human life vis-a-vis life's suffering cannot be begged. It is precisely the question at stake in the theodicean problematic. Goodman gives too much importance to the poetic dialogue. He writes, "The prose of Job is no more than the proscenium arch, a setting of the scene at the beginning and a breaking of the tension and the set at the end" (pp. 97-98) But in the Swahili version, which lacks the poetic dialogue altogether, the prose is extended with larger roles for Job, his wife, and the devil. The events of this version bear importantly on themes of theodicy not contained in the poetic dialogue-for example, free will. Job's wife makes a number of moral choices in both the Swahili and Koranic versions. If one is to elicit a meaning for theodicy from the text as a whole, the exegesis ought not to be confined to the poetic dialogue of the Biblical book. In fact, as both Saadiah and Goodman rightly acknowledge, theodicy Book Reviews 371</page><page sequence="3">is a universal philosophical problem. For this reason, any and all philo- sophic tools ought to be brought to bear on the problem. Recent devel- opments in modal logic recast the problem in terms of necessity and possibility. The atheodicists' claim that theodicy's propositions are neces- sarily inconsistent (that is, that God cannot be both omnipotent and omnibenevolent while there is yet suffering) has been shown to be false by Nelson Pike, Alvin Plantinga, John Hick, and others. Goodman's reli- ance on Saadiah's Aristotelian logic forces him to draw the problem too tightly, seeing the propositions as logically inconsistent. The result is an ambivalent response to the content of the propositions-especially God's omnibenevolence. Goodman is at his best when he is explicating Saadiah and the Biblical passages. He draws on a rich fund of knowledge both philosophic and philologic. The Book of Theodicy is an achievement which makes possible conversation about theodicy in a new vein of comparative philosophy. Goodman is not at his best when on the attack, however, as in his polemics against "the forays of dilettante philosophers" (p. 97). His meta- phor of modern theodicy as "built of clapboard and chicken wire" longs for a great "original structure" and its builders. The problems of theodicy are too important to pine for an original structure or even to search for a "plain sense" in the texts of tradition. Like Locke's famous passage against the rhetoricians in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Goodman argues against figures of speech by eloquently using one. The Philosophy of Sadhana: With Special Reference to the Trika Philoso- phy of Kashmir. By Deba Brata SenSharma. Foreword by Paul Eduardo Muller-Ortega. Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, 1990. Pp. xx + 196. Paper $12.95. Reviewed by Elisabeth Benard University of Hawaii Philosophy East &amp; West The Philosophy of Sadhana is a meticulously detailed explanation of the philosophy of spiritual practice (sJdhana) according to the Trika tradition of nondual Kashmir Saivism. Kashmir Saivism has been researched rigor- ously in India and Europe for many years, but its study in the United States is still in its infancy. A notable effort to this cause is the SUNY Series in the Saiva Traditions of Kashmir, originally edited by the late Harvey P. Alper and presently edited by Paul Muller-Ortega. The Philosophy of Sadhana is the third in this series. I applaud this pioneering effort in providing well-researched books on Kashmir Saivism. As SenSharma explains in his introduction, Kashmir Saivism is fre- quently the name applied to the Trika school, but there are actually four Saiva schools which developed in Kashmir. Trika means triad, and the school propounds various triads. One of these triads is the source of everything, namely Siva, the development of creation from Siva, and the 372</page></plain_text>
