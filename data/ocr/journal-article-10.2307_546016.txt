<plain_text><page sequence="1">SAUSGA AND THE HITTITE IVORY FROM MEGIDDO ROBERT L. ALEXANDER, University of Iowa, Iowa City EXCAVATIONS in 1937 at Megiddo in Palestine revealed a cache of ivories that included a small plaque of great interest to Hittitologists (figs. 1 and 2). Although its subject matter and style immediately linked it with the Hittite world, discovery in an area outside Hittite rule provoked serious questions concerning its artistic as well as geographical origins. Its possessor, in any case, was continually reminded of the Hittites, for the well-preserved portions of the plaque show extensive wear. Perhaps an attach- ment to a piece of furniture or the cover of a box, it was constantly fingered and rubbed, as the abrasion goes beyond outer surfaces, and details on the sides of the relief forms are worn smooth. Additional physical deterioration occurring underground added to the excavator's difficulties in restoring its original appearance. The composition has attracted much attention, so that the piece has been mentioned in many studies and the first restoration drawing frequently reproduced.1 The small ivory is crowded with figures. Along the bottom two pairs of affronted bulls stand on mounds of earth and stone, while the two broad winged disks of the Sun-god hover across the top. In between are four rows of eight to eleven figures, each supporting those above in an atlantid composition. A few multi-leaved plants and pomegranates provide additional support, and numerous rosettes fill vacant areas. Three figures- Mountain-god, bull-man, and a damaged figure-form a central axis of symmetry that helps organize and clarify the tightly packed composition. Despite some early questioning of the nature of the plaque-ivory panels are far more numerous in the Syro-Palestinian world than the Hittite-now it is generally recognized as a product of the late Hittite Empire (thirteenth century B.C.). Undoubted Hittite examples authenticate the extensive atlantid organization, including figures with arms raised in support, and the emphatic symmetry that was a great aid in restoring the composition. Add the rhythmic disposition of parts, here vertical as well as horizontal, and the self-containment resulting from figures turning inward toward the central axis, and the panel exhibits the design practices characteristic of thirteenth-century Hittite artists. By purposefully alternating the figural accents from row to row, the designer I Gordon Loud, The Megiddo Ivories (Chicago, 1939), pp. 10-11 and 14, pl. 11; idem, "The Hittites at Megiddo?," in Mlanges syriens offerts a Mon- sieur Rend Dussaud, 2 vols.

The whole array establishes an overall visual texture punctuated by the V-shaped pattern of upraised arms, and the few figures not in that pose-animals, Sun-gods at the top, and the third figure in the central column-stand out in contrast. Another kind of texture arises from use of the craftman's blade to score and shape the surface areas. Most figures are enriched, not in a realistic representation (except perhaps in some of the feathering), but with abstract textures.2 2 Arguments for the Hittite identification and date were effectively presented by Helene J.

Drawing by D. Alvarado The style of the figures, on comparison with large and small representations in stone and bronze, shows a Hittite emphasis on broad surfaces, forms enclosed by long continuous lines, exaggeration of the globular heads and muscular limbs, and diminu- tion of the torso. These forms are owed in part to a technical procedure suggested by prick marks still visible along the outlines of the top Mountain-god and the lion-man to the far right. Rather than a pointed, needle-like implement, however, the marks suggest that a fine, narrow blade was used to silhouette the figure, following a design drawn on the original surface. (While the craftsman was detailing the sides of the robe of the upper Mountain-god and the kilt of the neighboring lion-man, his knife slipped and made some of the prick marks in the background.) Material between the figures was then shaved down to the background. The artisan cut in at a slant around the contours to increase the height and bulk of the figures; although several forms have broken away, their shapes have survived owing to the degree of relief. This procedure resulted in the</page><page sequence="4">164 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES bold forms resembling monumental Hittite rock sculpture. Then the craftsman rounded the edges and modeled the forms to achieve the high degree of plasticity evident in, for example, the Sun-god, a parallel to the plasticity of figure 64 at Yazilikaya, the portrait of Great King Tudhaliya IV. The head, shoulders, and arms are massive, and carefully delineated spatial relationships distinguish the multiple layers of the garments in their fall over the body and from the outstretched arm. Such profile figures as the bull-man in the central column and the bulls along the bottom show great care in the shaping of near and far legs and the mass of the intervening body. Yet, at the same time, the thin raised wall of ivory forming the tail of the two-headed winged lion (at the ends of the row above the bulls) attests to the delicacy of the worker's miniaturist technique. Finally, the artisan worked the small features and details and the surface textures.3 Modeling is assertively three-dimensional, with rounded masses as well as overlap- ping forms rising two to three millimeters above the background. Individual figures are very consciously modeled, the waistline slightly lower in relief and the adjacent surfaces rising outward to the chest and abdomen. The locks of the Hathor-headed sphinx show different degrees of relief as they move back and forth in space, following the levels of the head, neck, and body. Forms are conceived in three dimensions; the eye, nose, and mouth are correctly represented on profile heads, for example, Sun-god, two-headed lion, lower Mountain-god. The concern for achieving three dimensions appears in such details as the kilt, where the outer end is raised above the inner layers wrapped around the body, and in wings, where the tips of a range of feathers rise to overlap the next range. Subject matter, too, provides evidence of Hittite origins. Some elements are purely Hittite, for example, the mantled figure topped by a winged disk, identified by the hieroglyphs over his hand as the Sun-god of Heaven, and the winged two-headed lion, its leonine head worn to an almost featureless boss above the breast but the upper, human head with the conical tiara of a Hittite deity still very clear. The seated wingless sphinx with Hathor locks probably is a Hittite creation, and while the bull-man and kneeling bull-demon appear throughout the ancient Near East, the bull-man in the central column is a virtual duplicate of those in the imperial sanctuary at Yazilikaya. Other figures occur in the larger Syro-Hittite world, for example, the bulls with lowered heads, although the decorative markings on their flanks are Hittite, and the Mountain- god wearing a robe decorated by overlapping scales, located at the top of the central axis and as the third figure from each side in the row just above the bulls. The Janus- headed lion-man, appearing on either side of the Sun-god, is unknown in other Hittite works, but does occur in Syrian glyptic, especially seals of the Hurrian people, during the sixteenth to fourteenth centuries B.C. Rosettes, plants, and pomegranates appear frequently in the arts of the Hittite Empire.4 3 For the portrait of Tudhaliya IV, see Kurt Bittel et al., Das hethitische Felsheiligtum Yazihkaya (Ber- lin, 1975), pl. 39. 4 For the sphinx with Hathor locks, see A.

Though winged, these lion-men are associated with the sun standard and thus are the best antecedents for the</page><page sequence="5">SAUSGA AND THE HITTITE IVORY FROM MEGIDDO 165 Perhaps the most individual of these images is the winged two-headed lion, so striking an image that it survived with little change through the Neo-Hittite centuries. A composite beast, its basis is the body of a lion with its head held low (markedly different from the type with elongated neck and leonine head held high). The addition of wings parallels Near Eastern use of wings on the sphinx acquired from Egypt and makes the animal more than an ordinary lion. Above the neck is added a divinizing element, the human head with the tall, conical, Hittite tiara. Representations from later centuries stress the continuity of the body, neck, and animal head, and show that the divine head was understood as an addition either by its relation to the contour of the neck or by its placement on the animal (occasionally above the head). One other example from the Empire is known, on the gold seal ring from Konya, where the animal carries the goddess Sausga. In both of these imperial examples, the mane has been carried upward to fuse the upper elongated neck with the body and simulate a naturalistic appearance. A parallel alteration occurs in the one other known use of the divinizing head, on figure 81 at Yazilikaya, the Sword-god. Here addossed lion protomes carry the neck and head, and the partial animal bodies have been anthropomorphized as the upper part of a human torso. The notch of the sternum and the vertical division of the rib-cage are clear and represent the artist's attempt to endow the unusual creation with credibility; similar attempts can be seen in other composite beings such as the sphinx and bull-man. Nevertheless, Neo-Hittite sculptors recognized the leonine body and head as the basic form for the two-headed lion; at Carchemish the heavy outline separates the neck and the tiaraed head, while at Tell Halaf, the sculptors placed the divinizing head over the leonine one.5 wingless lion-men supporting the winged sun disk on the Megiddo plaque. Several examples of the lion-man appear in Neo-Hittite art, most of them supporting the disk; only one, from Tell Halaf, is two-headed; Winfried Orthmann, Untersuchungen zur spdthethitischen Kunst (Bonn, 1971), pp. 310- 16, and pl. 11, T. Halaf A3/162. On the image of the Mountain-god, see Kurt Bittel et al., Bogazkdy III (Berlin, 1957), pp. 25-28; and U. Bahadir Alkim, Yesemek (Ankara, 1974), pp. 94-104. The use of overlapping scales in hori- zontal rows to mark the robe of the Mountain-god developed in Mesopotamia. Triangular scales in de- fined horizontal rows, as on the god at the top of the center column of the ivory, are rare; the only parallel is Mesopotamian, of the Old Babylonian period, in Edith Porada, ed., Corpus of Ancient Near Eastern Seals in North American Collections, 2 vols., The Collection of the Pierpont Morgan Library, Bollingen Series 14 (Washington, 1948), vol. 1, no. 391. I believe the triangular form on the ivory resulted from the craftsman's technique. He marked out the scales by a series of crossing diago- nal incisions over the robe, then he rounded them so that the original geometrical shape became less ob- vious, and later wear has rounded them still more. The triangular incisions are partially visible in the Mountain-god in the bottom row of figures, but the rounding of the shapes predominates. Representa- tion of the Mountain-god as a torso emerging from a conical pile of less regular scales, more like a pile of rocks, occasionally appears in Syria. The seal Louvre AO 20138 shows the two forms of the scale in the same composition; see my article "The Tyskiewicz Group of Stamp-Cylinders," Anatolica 5 (1973-76): 159-60 and pls. 1-2. Of other costume elements represented on the plaque, the robe of the Sun-god and the kilt occur frequently in Hittite art. A few figures wear a long mantle covering the back leg, a type occurring also at Yazilikaya and Eflatun Pinar. Close inspection suggests that the tiaras were not spiked but essen- tially conical and later much worn. Loud's drawing of the tiara (minus the tassel) worn by the two- headed lion is a reliable reconstruction of a very difficult passage. The headdress of the Mountain- god at the top, however, is lost above the headband; it probably was a conical tiara. Rosettes, plants, and pomegranates occur fre- quently in late imperial works. Seals are among the objects showing all three; D. G. Hogarth, Hittite Seals (Oxford, 1920), no. 191, and Rainer M. Boeh- mer and H. G.

Texts describe two statues of Saugga, with a supporting lion in one and the awiti in the other. In both, the animal has wings, but neither text mentions two heads. On the Konya ring the beast lacks wings, and it seems reasonable to assume that the engraver wished to avoid concealing part of the deity. Because the goddess, herself winged, stands over the supportive animal attribute, it does not need them for identification. Characteristic details are omitted in many circum- stances; for example, of all the known representations of Saulga-and there are not many for so popular a deity-not one has all the signs and attributes that identify her. On the Megiddo ivory, and in all later examples, the animal's separation from the deity requires that both the divinizing head and the wings be present for clear and specific identification, a necessity for effective use of symbols.6 No one seems to have called the animal an attribute of gaulga. Yet, because she holds a leash to the collar of the animal on the Konya ring and is described with an unusual animal as support in the two texts, a close relationship exists between the deity and the animal mount. The same relationship-restraining the animal attribute by a leash- appears frequently in images of the Storm-god over a bull, beginning as early as the Assyrian Colony period and continuing in the Empire period. Although garruma's animal attribute is not certain, in Yazlihkaya figure 44, the earliest anthropomorphic representation of the god, he stands on a leashed lion, a group repeated at Darende and, without the leash, at Malatya. It seems probable that, as a parallel, the two-headed lion was an attribute of Sau'ga.7 She concludes that the beast was created in the Hittite Empire, a conclusion accepted by Dessenne (Le Sphinx, p. 96) and confirmed by the limitation of the later spread of the motif to the Neo-Hittite world.

For the Sword-god, see Bittel, Yazihkaya, pp. 163-64, 191- 92, and pls. 50-51; the representation of the sternum can be compared with that on the leonine guardians (figures 67-68), ibid., pl. 43. Use of the tiaraed head as a method of indicating a deity has long been recognized; see E. Meyer, Reich und Kultur der Chetiter (Berlin, 1914), p. 100, for the Sword-god, and for the two-headed lion, Dessenne, Le Sphinx, p. 95. The conical tiara alone was used to indicate that animals were deities; see examples in Canby, "The Walters Gallery Cappadocian Tablet," pp. 240- 42, to which add the two calves at Yazilikaya (figures 42a-43a) symbolizing Sarruma (Bittel, Yazihkaya, pp. 150-52, 170-71, and pls. 27-29); the long-necked bull of the Storm-god on a seal in the Oriental Institute (Hans Henning von der Osten, Ancient Oriental Seals in the Collection of Mrs. Agnes Baldwin Brett [Chicago, 1936], no. 89); and perhaps the lion of Hepat (?) on an impression excavated at Bogazk6y (Boehmer and Gilterbock, Glyptik aus dem Stadtgebiet, no. 182). 6 For the descriptions of the images, see Liane Rost, "Zu den hethitischen Bildbeschreibungen," Mitteilungen des Instituts fuir Orientforschung 8 (1961): 174-76.

The figures in the center offered special difficulties because they lacked symmetrical duplicates. On the basis of understanding gained from more recent studies, a new identification is presented here for the most deteriorated of the central figures (fig. 3). Below the Mountain-god and bull-man are remnants of a frontal figure, the shoulders, arms, and torso certain, but legs and feet and the head severely damaged. Because the arms are not raised, the shoulder structure is more fully modeled than that of other figures. Rather than another Mountain-god as first restored, the relief of the breast and the roundness of the belly suggest a nude female. Although the area is worn smooth, the breast has an abrupt high relief rather than rising gradually from the waistline as it does in all the other figures, and there certainly is no beard. Thus the figure is markedly different from others on the plaque, and positive signs denote it as female. The nude female is a common figure in the art of Anatolia and Syria during the second millennium B.C., often as a form of Ishtar, goddess of fecundity. In the Hittite Empire she bears the Hurrian name Saugga, and, like Ishtar, she may also be a bellicose deity. Hittite representations customarily show her nude or partially covered, the clothing pulled aside to reveal her female nature. The shoulder remnants on the plaque are not clear enough to certify partial nudity, and the upper torso has been rubbed smooth. Nevertheless, the long history of this unusual frontal image not only supports the identification and restoration of the figure on the Megiddo ivory as Saugga, but offers also a key to an explanation of the program carved into the tiny plaque.8 26, 29-30; for the Darende and Malatya repetitions, E.

Mitanni and Syrian examples have been pointed out by Edith Porada, "Of Professional Seal Cutters and Non- professionally Made Seals," in M. Gibson and</page><page sequence="8">168 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Some aspects of the form and meaning of the goddess are present in Syria and Anatolia at the beginning of the second millennium B.c., although the name of the figure is uncertain. Frontal, her nudity often receives emphasis from the representation of her last garment held in one hand or still covering one leg. At times the figure has wings, and a large foliate wreath may surround her. This form of the nude goddess may be a Syrian and Hurrian tradition, for the presence of the garment shown inside the wreath is documented on Syrian seal impressions of the Assyrian Colony period in the early second millennium. She occurs with other figures, frequently with the Storm-god and thus pairing the powers of fertility and water. In reduced versions, she faces the Storm- god, holding the garment stretched out to either side to reveal her nude body; and she may stand over a bull. In one example, dated to the sixteenth century B.C., both deities stand over bulls, an image from a seal impression that probably was made in south- eastern Anatolia and sent to Hattuga, where it was excavated.9 The representation of the frontal nude holding garment and wreath had a long life, appearing much later in a molded terracotta plaque and a stone mold for casting metal plaques, indications of the popularity of the image. The plaque is dated by its excava- tion from Level III at Alalakh to the fourteenth century B.C. (fig. 4); the mold lacks provenance and date. In both, the figure stands in an almond-shaped wreath of vegeta- tion that rises beside her feet from a mound that has additional vegetation growing to either side; the wreath rises to a winged sun-disk over the figure's head, and where she grasps it on either side she also holds birds (doves?). Each hand also holds the outspread robe, the edges of which descend toward her knees and curl out at the bottom. The two differ greatly in style and technique, but the most significant difference is in the conical R. D.

For the identification of this figure on the ivory as Saugga, I am much indebted to Roberta J. M. Olson, of Wheaton College, Norton, Massachusetts, who made a study of the piece for a class in 1970. She suggested also the restoration of pomegranates instead of boucrania below the lowest row of figures and rosettes instead of boxes in the uppermost row; these parts of the ivory are very worn.

Adjacent to the goddess is another attribute, a flying bird. The second example is in the upper frieze of the stamp-cylinder Louvre AO 20138 where the frontal nude female holds a vase close to her body. Although she is wingless, her robe spreads out beside her body and legs. Instead of vegetal abundance, water accompanies her and emphasizes her fertility symbolism. Streams descend from a guilloche and a cup at the top of the frieze to fill the vase, and overflowing water spills to the ground. In these two examples some details have been changed so that the basic image might acquire more specific meanings, perhaps on the demand of the patrons. Both show the robe behind the body, and a similar robe is here restored on the Megiddo plaque.1" By mid-millennium the early, partially nude form was converted into figures in the round, and the name Saulga is linked with this goddess.

Erosion and some flaking of the stone obscure many details of the Imamkulu relief, for example, the feet of the god- dess. Numerous fragments of relief flank the edges of the robe of the goddess; we restore them as vege- tation. When a cast was made about fifteen years ago, lichens were removed, so that the surface of the stone is clearly visible; many details, however, re- main difficult to interpret in both the original and the cast (in the museum at Kayseri).

In both, the upper torso remains clothed while the dress has been pulled up to reveal the rounded belly and legs and thus the female nature of the figure. The Nuzi figurine has, in addition, elements of both masculine and feminine clothing, a battle ax in one hand, and over the other a triangle, the Hittite hieroglyph for "health" or greeting. Thus, a complex tradition, including some degree of nudity, sexual ambivalence, a military weapon, and other attributes, emerges from several centuries of representation in various media.12 12 Mellink, in "Hittite Figurine," pp. 155-64, dis- cusses both of these figurines. I would like to thank her for providing the photograph of the Nuzi figu- rine and to Gebr. Mann Verlag, publisher of Vor- derasiatische Archiiologie, for permission to use it here.

Alp (Karah'yiiuk, p. 119, fig. 8, and pl. 35) excavated a Colony age seal impression showing the garment raised in front of the body, thus estab- lishing the existence of this conception long before the two figurines were made. By the middle of the second millennium, both forms were well known (cf. Porada, Corpus, nos. 937-44). Use of elements of male costume and emphasis on the military as- pect of Ishtar also was ancient; see the eighteenth- century seal from Mari in Porada, "Professional</page><page sequence="12">172 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Two Hittite temple images of Saugga, perhaps of the fourteenth century B.C., are known from inventory texts made after the middle of the thirteenth century. One showed the goddess seated, the other standing; both figures were winged and accom- panied by the triangle sign, and one carried an ax. One was so masculinized that the scribe described it as the figure of a man. Two Hurrian handmaidens, Ninatta and Kulitta, accompanied both figures, and one group had a winged lion supporting the goddess, the other the beast called the awiti. In the Hittite Empire, therefore, the Hurrian sexual ambivalence and (perhaps Hurrian) weapon were combined with the frontal winged figure, nude or partly clothed, accompanied now by handmaidens and a symbolic animal in three-dimensional compositions. Whether in two or three dimen- sions, this frontal image was well established in the Hittite Empire, and it did not require all the attributes for proper identification."3 In a new image created in the mid-thirteenth century, a large number of these elements and qualities are retained. On the walls of the imperial sanctuary at Yazilikaya Sausga, as figure 38, appears near the head of the procession of male deities (fig. 7). Winged, she wears a male tiara, but a female robe that is pulled up to display the lower torso and one leg, and she has been converted into a processional figure. The artist who designed this figure had limited guidance from craft traditions in composing these representations of many different deities in profile. For Saulga he probably worked from small sculptures familiar to him, such a one as the Nuzi figurine or those described in the inventories. He retained the full frontal torso, and to show the garment raised above her belly, then falling over the hip and back leg, he adapted the folds of the dress worn by the goddesses on the opposite wall of the sanctuary. The folds have been converted into a decorative, archaic, curvilinear pattern, and thus suggest the sculptor's difficulties in transforming the three-dimensional statue into the relief image. To make the figure conform with the others in the procession, he turned her head and legs and feet in profile and adjusted the arms to the forward movement. Another adaptation of the model appears in the unusual treatment of the pubic triangle; its asymmetry results from the sculptor's concern with showing the lower contour of the torso, the back of the leading leg, and the drapery that covers the trailing leg and disappears behind the front one. Inasmuch as damage to the belly of the figure follows the curving line of the innermost fold of theidress, perhaps it is natural flaking of the stone.14 This winged Saulga has neither weapon nor animal attribute, but Ninatta and Kulitta (figures 37-36) accompany her. The accident of the shape and size of the rock face places her in a group with three deities of approximately equal rank, the Water-god (39) who precedes her, and the Moon- and Sun-gods (35-34) who follow. This prominent place among the gods is credited to the special interest of the Great King Hattu'ili III (1275- 1250 B.c.), under whom the sanctuary reliefs were undertaken, who revered Saulga for her aid at critical junctures in his life and who raised a sanctuary for her in another city.

For Laroche the Hurrian nature of the deities represented as figures 40-34 at Yazlhkaya was a strong point in his argument that tablets from Kizzuwatna (brought presumably by Puduhepa) were important sources in the organi- zation of this pantheon; see Laroche, "Les Dieux de Yazlhkaya," RHA 8 (1969): 70-75.</page><page sequence="14">174 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES 1 4 ::ii/ii:i :::::.::::::i: ilwill - -- :: a"- k" -i, 4 - nx ,iiiiii~-ii ::.:ii:i_:: : -_i::_ - :-~ ' , - ,- 4-: : kMZ4dJ FIG. 8.-Saugga relief from CAin Dara, National Museum, Aleppo Many details of the new type of winged Sausga appear in a Neo-Hittite relief (broken at the top) from the North Syrian site of CAin Dara (fig. 8). Her forms, especially the face, are well modeled, and she wears elaborately worked garments, the careful textur- ing of which highlights the fine quality of the piece. Different from figure 38 at Yazilikaya, however, she bears arms, one shouldered and one (spear?) in her out- stretched hand. In addition, the pubic triangle is emphasized by its large size. Evidently the patron sought absolute certainty in this presentation of the goddess's dual symbol- ism. Despite these variations, the cAin Dara relief remains close to figure 38 and testifies to the essential characteristics of the second type of aulga image, striding pose,</page><page sequence="15">?AUSGA AND THE HITTITE IVORY FROM MEGIDDO 175 frontality of the partly nude torso, profile view of head and limbs, wings, and disposi- tion of the garment over and under legs.16 The considerable impact of the imperial sanctuary during the half century remaining to the Empire can be recognized in the six known replicas of the striking new image of Saugga. Tiny figurines of lapis lazuli and gold, once forming an elaborate inlay, were found at Carchemish in a Neo-Hittite stratum. After many years of question concerning the date, these have now been firmly attributed to the late thirteenth century as a reduced version of the pantheon at Yazilikaya. Along with Saugga, one female has been recognized as perhaps the surviving figure of the pair of handmaidens.'7 The upper frieze of the Louvre stamp-cylinder seal shows the goddess a second time, in the new image and in company with the gods of water, moon, and sun-thus the group is adapted from the section at Yazilikaya comprising figures 34-39. In addition, the stamp-cylinder employs the idea of two balanced processions with the Storm-god and a goddess meeting in the center, again a device known from the imperial sanctuary. Here she holds a cup and thus shares with the central Saugga the symbolism of water and fertility. Despite the Mitannian style and technique which place the manufacture of this seal in northern Syria, some Hittite artistic elements and content are derived from Yazlhkaya, so that it follows the sanctuary and its date is late thirteenth century B.C.18 Four more seal designs, in unquestionable Hittite style, make use of the new Sausga image, in each case confronting a male figure, a common pattern of the late Empire. Impressions excavated at Ugarit record a ring-type seal on which Saugga faces a figure with a bow. Hieroglyphs fill the spaces and name the owner, Prince Taki-Sarruma. On an uninscribed cylinder seal in Geneva, Saugga faces a figure with a spear. On the Konya gold signet ring of a prince, Sauwga is mounted on a wingless two-headed lion (com- pared earlier with the one on the Megiddo ivory), and hieroglyphs, including a lion, 16 Ali Abu Assaf, "Ein Relief der kriegerischen G6ttin Ischtar," Damaszener Mitteilungen 1 (1983): 7-8, pl. 1; idem, "'Ain Dara-Eine neu entdeckte Residenzstadt," in Land des Baal: Syrien-Forum der V61ker und Kulturen (Mainz am Rhein, 1982), p. 351, fig. 66. Excavated in 1980, this relief is now in the National Museum, Aleppo. The reliefs of this site offer another example close to the sculpture of Yazilikaya, the "bull mastered by a giant"; Faisal Seirafi and Agob Kirichian with the assistance of Maurice Dunand, "Recherches archeologiques h Ayin-Dara," Annales Archdologiques de Syrie 15 (1965): 10, pl. 8 c; Orthmann, Untersuchungen zur spiithethitischen Kunst, cAin Dara Cb/ 1. This depic- tion recalls figure 42 at Yazihkaya, Tegub and the calf symbolizing Sarruma. Representation of figures overlapping in space was extremely rare; figure 42 was invented for use in the imperial sanctuary, and it almost certainly was the source for the CAin Dara relief. Thus, the links between Yazilikaya 38 and the Saugga of CAin Dara are strengthened. One other detail has imperial tradition behind it. The toes of Saugga's shoes turn completely back to the tops of the feet, so that they resemble those on the two Sauggas of the Louvre stamp-cylinder AO 20138, the queens and seated goddess of Alaca Hiiyiik (Helmut Th. Bossert, Altanatolien [Berlin, 1942], figs. 505, 507, 516), and several figures of the Schimmel rhyton (Oscar W. Muscarella, Ancient Art: The Norbert Schimmel Collection [New York, 1974], no. 123). This detail appears earlier, however, in the Nuzi figurine (fig. 5). 17 Ursula Seidl, "Lapisreliefs und ihre Goldfas- sungen aus Karkamig," Istanbuler Mitteilungen 22 (1972): 15-43. 18 Concerning the place of manufacture of Louvre AO 20138, see my "Stamp-Cylinders," pp. 163-64. Saugga in a procession and holding a cup(?) appears on another Hittite cylinder seal of the thirteenth century; see Porada, "Cylinder Seals Found at Thebes," pp. 40-43, no. 25. She accompanies three gods, one of them the Sun-god, the others uncertain. Her form and elaborate garment hark back to the Syrian type of the early second millennium (cf. Porada, "Syrian Seals," fig. 19, and Porada, "Cylin- der Seals Found at Thebes," no. 23), and in combi- nation with the diverse forms, garments, and sizes of the gods indicate that the designer of this seal used a variety of sources for the imagery.</page><page sequence="16">176 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES appear on either side. In all three representations, the triangle hieroglyph is over the hand. In the Geneva and Ugarit examples, the edge of her garment falls below the outstretched arm as it does at Yazilikaya, and on the Konya ring she holds her animal mount by a leash, another motif known also at Yazilikaya. The find-spot of the Ugaritic impressions offers a late imperial date, while the Geneva and Konya seals lack dating evidence beyond the presence of the new image. Several thirteenth-century impressions of still another seal, excavated at Mesk6n6, a North Syrian city dependent on Carche- mish, show Sau'ga with a tall object in her outstretched hand and her mantle falling below the elbow; the image is altered, however, as the dress covers the figure from waist to ankles. Thus, archaeological and artistic evidence supports the conclusion that these six works date from the late thirteenth century B.C. and that they derive from the processional reliefs of Yazilikaya. Furthermore, they exemplify the operation of an art historical principle, that a new exemplar sets an artistic evolution on a new path and leads to a congeries of variations and adaptations.19 One development related to the imagery of Saulga has already been mentioned. This is the motif of the lion bearing a second head rising from the top of its neck, and it links the old and new images of Sau'ga. She mounts this animal on the Konya ring, restraining it with a leash; on the Megiddo plaque this animal appears twice, closing the row of figures surrounding Saulga. Whether an older motif or a thirteenth-century addition to the artist's repertoire, the two-headed lion was used with both old and new types of the goddess. Its striking form distinguished it from lions supporting and symbolic of other deities, such as the lion of Sarruma, and helped it survive for use in Neo-Hittite sculpture.20 In several works, for example, the Konya ring, little reference is made to Sausga as goddess of fertility, whereas at Yazilikaya her position next to the Water-god, figure 39, seems to relate fertility to the power of water, as is clearly the case in the Imamkulu relief and the Louvre stamp-cylinder. The latter two works, both using the older frontal image of the goddess, are even more closely linked by the larger compositional similarity and meaning. In both, Saugga turns her head and feet toward the Storm-god who appears in a complex and new image as he steps onto a chariot drawn by his attributive animals, two bulls. No longer is she the diminutive accompanying figure seen in Anatolian seal designs of the Assyrian Colony period. In Syrian seals of the mid- millennium, her size and importance increase, and she gains a clear equality which she 19 Taki-Sarruma impression: Schaeffer, Ugaritica III, figs. 54-57.

For the Mesk6n6 design, see Beyer, "Les Empreintes de sceaux," p. 67, figs. 3, 11. Half of the silhouette of a winged figure survives on fragments of a worked sheet of gold found with the lapis and gold figurines; Seidl, "Lapisreliefs," fig. 1, and Leonard Woolley, Carchemish, pt. 3 (London, 1952), pl. 64, a 1. This figure may be another adapta- tion of the new Saugga image. It resembles the Mesk6n6 figure in holding out a tall object grasped near the base. For a possible parallel, see an old drawing of a Neo-Hittite relief of Carchemish which shows a goddess (directly behind the Storm-god) holding out a tall object identified by Woolley as a sistrum or stalks of grain; ibid., p. 165, pl. B. 38, c. 20 The surviving half of a small Hittite bone plaque from Alalakh shows two similar animals; see Wool- ley, Alalakh, p. 291, pl. 77. In the quadrant at the top a lion is dominated by a winged, long-necked animal with a conical tiara, but the head seems more animal (lion?) than human, and there is no leonine head at the breast. The left quadrant con- tains a caprid attacked by a winged beast with two heads (one at the breast), but they both have the form of a falcon or eagle head, and neither has a tiara. They share with the two-headed lion of the Megiddo plaque a distinction in textures between the small tufted forms of the breast and front of the neck and the striations on the mane and back; the wings are remarkably similar on both pieces.</page><page sequence="17">SAUSGA AND THE HITTITE IVORY FROM MEGIDDO 177 maintains in these two works. On the seal she heads a procession as does the Storm-god, and in the relief her support is as extraordinary as that of the Storm-god, an unusual tree or perhaps a bird with four pairs of wings, while the god and his chariot and bulls rest on three Mountain-gods who, in turn, are supported by three animal-headed beings with raised arms. The goddess seems now to be his partner in a sacred marriage, certainly in an aura of procreative abundance dependent on water. The geographical circumstances indicate that Saulga's new prominence in Hittite art develops from Hurrian practices, for both of these works may be linked with southeastern regions of the Hittite world; the relief at Imamkulu marked the border of the province of Kizzuwatna on an important route to the Hittite capital, Hattula, and the stamp- cylinder, on the basis of its Mitannian style and technique, probably originated in northern Syria. These two works, furthermore, become evidence of the importance of the Hurrians in stimulating the artistic efflorescence of the last century of the Hittite Empire. Yet, paradoxically, the pairing of Saugga and the Storm-god did not become established in Anatolia.21 Despite the dependence of the seal frieze on Yazilikaya, its import contradicts a significant aspect of the sanctuary reliefs where it is Hepat/ Sun-goddess of Arinna (figure 43) who heads the procession of goddesses and meets the Storm-god. This dominant rank was owed to Great Queen Puduhepa, priestess of Hepat in the south- eastern province of Kizzuwatna and reorganizer of the pantheon at the Hittite capital. In fusing the Hurrian Hepat with the ancient Anatolian Sun-goddess of Arinna, Puduhepa hittitized her own goddess for use at the center of the Empire and preempted for her the place of Saugga opposite the Storm-god. Such a drastic change in a wide- spread, centuries-old tradition testifies to the great power of the imperial patrons. The stamp-cylinder, on the other hand, testifies to its owner's preference for the traditional grouping.22 That Saugga appears twice at Yazlihkaya and on the stamp-cylinder is not only a measure of her importance, but a suggestion that the two types have variant meanings. The new type probably conveys the idea of fertility, but it appears also in places where the fertility symbolism seems to play little part, for example, the Konya ring, Geneva seal, and seal of Taki-Sarruma. As the central figure on the stamp-cylinder seal, the older type lacks military significance and symbolizes the relationship between fertility and water, as is the case at Imamkulu also, and perhaps this would be the import of the putative Yazilhkaya 55b. The appearance of both images in a single composition, then, is not simply duplication; rather, they supplement each other, perhaps when the patron demanded clear statements of the two sides of Saugga's nature.23 21 For Syrian cylinder seals of the mid-millennium in which the goddess has equal prominence with the Storm-god, see Porada, Corpus, nos. 967-68. Be- hind the compositions of Imamkulu and the stamp- cylinder lay the motif of the sixteenth-century impression from southeastern Anatolia (see above, n. 9). For the geographical relationships of the relief at Imamkulu, see the map in Wafler, "Imamkulu," fig. 1. 22 In representing Hattugili III with the Storm- god and Puduhepa with Hepat, the Fraktin reliefs show this new preference slightly earlier than Yazi- likaya. For religious activities of Puduhepa, see Laroche, "Le Pantheon de Yazlihkaya," JCS 6 (1952): 121-22. 23 Two forms of augga seem to appear on a cylinder seal now in the Oriental Institute (von der Osten, Brett, no. 89). They approach the Storm-god who holds both a mace and a spear with its point down and who stands on a bull with a similar conical tiara with one large horn at the brim. The farther figure is a frontal nude female with head and feet turned toward the Storm-god, and she stands on a long-horned caprid. The nearer one, stepping toward the Storm-god, wears a long garment that covers the trailing leg, while the torso and leading</page><page sequence="18">178 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES Only the older type of Saugga appears in the Megiddo plaque, where it probably refers to the agricultural value of water. This figure provides a key to interpretation of the overall program, for the rich atlantid composition recognizes the basic necessities of an agricultural economy. At the bottom, mounds of earth support four bulls, attributes of the Storm-god and thus symbols of water. The power of the earth is further personified by Mountain-gods, and of water by Saugga and her symbolic animals, the divinized lions. Monkeys (behind the Sun-gods), a long recognized symbol, add strong reference to fertility, and plant elements specify an agricultural content. The Mountain- god and Sauiga in the central column refer to the qualities of earth and water, and the third figure, the bull-man who often guards the sun-disk, may be interpreted as evoking the power of the sun, a function echoed by the numerous rosettes and the uppermost figures. In the bottom row, the bull-demons and Mountain-gods refer again to the sun and the earth, and the female sphinxes may refer to water. With its repetition of symbols, this richly interwoven composition exemplifies the principle of redundancy, which is by no means unusual in religious expression. Repeated for the sake of symmetry, the image of the Sun-god of Heaven is enhanced by its large size, winged sun-disk, and flanking Janus-headed lion-men. Middle Bronze Age speculation, at the beginning of the second millennium, recognized the necessary pairing of earth and water for agricultural success. Now, Late Bronze thinking enlarges the group by incorporating the sun. This new understanding of the sun is evident in imagery of the Syro-Hittite world, and it continues to be strong in Neo-Hittite art of the first millennium B.C. In Syrian cities of the Hittite Empire, seals and other works represent the Sun-god above or show him equal to the Storm-god, and this conception traveled back to the Anatolian Hittite world. Clearly, the Sun-god dominates in the ivory, and the Storm-god is present only in his attributive animals, while some of his watery symbolism is assumed by Saulga. Water, like earth, is subordinated to the power of the sun.24 leg are nude, a variant on another type of the unveiling goddess (cf. Porada, Seal Impressions, vol. 1, nos. 945-46, 968); she stands on a lion and wears a spiked helmet with a large horn at the brim and thus may represent the bellicose side of the goddess, and she holds a small animal. Both god- desses shoulder a weapon with a curved end, and all three supporting animals have unnaturally long necks, perhaps another means of divinizing animal attributes. Although the deities on animals, the op- posing bull and lion separated by a plant, and the conical tiaras are all Hittite aspects, the Mitanni technique and the cylinder seal form suggest manu- facture in northern Syria. If figure no. 19 of the lapis and gold figurines of Carchemish (see Seidl, "Lapisreliefs," p. 26, pl. 7) represents another Saugga, then again the goddess appears twice in one composition. 24 See Kantor, "A 'Syro-Hittite' Treasure," pp. 145- 55, for discussion of the gold disk formerly in the Oriental Institute. Sun symbolism appears in the winged disk supported by a tree and bull-men in the largest zone of the disk as well as in the rosettes at the center and distributed lavishly in the circular zones. Only in the bull with lowered head and Hittite body markings is there a possible reference to the Storm-god. Kantor gives other Hittite ex- amples of the winged disk supported by bull-men and concludes that the disk was made in northern Syria. For discussions of the image of the Sun-god, see P. E. Pecorella, "Una stele neoetea da Malatya," Athenaeum n.s. 18 (1969): 226-35; Gary Beckman, "A Hittite Cylinder Seal in the Yale Babylonian Collection," Anatolian Studies 31 (1981): 129-35, with a list of imperial examples of the image; to which add Beyer, "Sceau-cylindre de Shahurunuwa," pp. 70-77, fig. 7; idem, "Quelques observations," pp. 29-44, fig. 1, e-h; and Thebes 25 (Porada, "Cylinder Seals Found at Thebes," no. 25). The representations probably date from the end of the fourteenth through the thirteenth centuries B.C. (with the exception of the Neo-Hittite stela), and most come from southeastern Anatolia and northern Syria. A very old form of the Sun-god appears once in the late Empire, in the group of four deities on Louvre AO 20138; Alexander, "Stamp-Cylinders," p. 157. The invention and rapid acceptance of the new image obviously responded to a newly felt need. As</page><page sequence="19">SAUSGA AND THE HITTITE IVORY FROM MEGIDDO 179 Relationships between elements are expressed through the composition of the plaque and reveal that the atlantid formation itself conveys a religious understanding. At the top, heaven is identified by hieroglyphs and images of large size that state the dominant power of the Sun-god of Heaven, a parallel to the position of the great king in Hittite political affairs. Terrestrial manifestations of earth and water occur at the bottom. In between are the elevated mountain peaks, divinized essence of earthly fertility, and the upper atmosphere, where water originates in rainstorms. The composition thus reflects the experience of natural and supernatural worlds and parallels contemporary Baby- lonian imagery where, on the Kassite kudurru, sky-gods occur at the top, separated by intermediate earthly levels from underground deities at the bottom. Within Hittite art, moreover, similar concerns with agricultural fertility are evident in other compositions. In the central panel at Yazilhkaya (figures 40-46), symbols of earth and water commingle with the produce of fertility in the Vegetation-god (40), and the offspring of the two main deities occupy places near the head of the processions, Sarruma and the daughter and granddaughter of the Storm-god (44-46), as well as the calves (42a-43a), symbols of Sarruma. The prominence in Anatolia of the Storm-god and consequent emphasis on water along with earth as responsible for creation and growth reappear in the upper frieze of Louvre AO 20138, with the Sun-god to one side as he is at Yazilikaya. In the related lower frieze, animal life and success in the hunt also are attributed to the Storm-god. Emphasis on the sun, on the other hand, occurs in some other works. The bronze plaque excavated at Alaca Huiytik shows a large winged disk, with a second disk superposed, supported by a tree and two bull-men; all rest on two affronted bulls standing on a series of conical mountain peaks. The whole seems to be a variation on the ivory plaque composition. One large winged disk and two smaller ones top the late imperial monument at Eflatun Pinar. Its relationships with the Megiddo ivory are many-atlantid composition, animal- and bird-headed figures, figural poses and cos- tumes, and the frontality of the two large seated deities. Topped by strong references to the sun and rising from actual water and earth, it may well have had meanings similar to those of the ivory. Along with the lapis and gold 'figurines of Carchemish, which included a Sun-god, was found a second Sun-god larger than the other and cast in gold, a technique different from that of the other figurines.25 In addition to the presence of Saugga (figure 38) at Yazilikaya, further evidence of the late imperial date for the newly developed imagery along with the religious speculation comes from the fact that several repetitions appeared in the Neo-Hittite and Aramaic kingdoms of the early Iron Age and not in other parts of the ancient Near East. From Malatya, for example, in eastern Anatolia and close to the eastern edge of Kizzuwatna, the world position of the Hittite Empire developed, contacts with Egypt increased along with an aware- ness of how Egyptian art was used to magnify the pharaoh (Kurt Bittel, Hattusha [Oxford, 1970], pp. 113-31). An old relationship between the Sun- god and the king facilitated the development of an image that could represent the deity and at the same time enhance the stature of the ruler. This relation- ship was understood earlier in the rosette as a sun symbol used also for the king in Hittite seals of the fifteenth and fourteenth centuries (Giiterbock, Siegel aus Boazkdy, pt. 1. AfO Beiheft 5 [1940; repr. Osnabruck, 1967]: 45-46; see also Oliver R. Gurney, "Hittite Kingship," in Sidney H. Hooke, ed., Myth, Ritual, and Kingship [Oxford, 1958], pp. 116-18). 25 For the bronze plaque, see Bittel, Les Hittites, fig. 246. For Eflatun Pinar, ibid., fig. 257. Both Sun- gods among the Carchemish figurines appear in ibid., figs. 242-43.</page><page sequence="20">180 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES come reliefs generally considered among the earliest after the empire. ?augga occurs as a separate figure in the new image, receiving a libation while supported by two birds, and in another relief her striking form appears twice in figures, one winged, who carry arms and wear the garment with curvilinear folds pulled back from the front leg. The Moon- and Sun-gods, receiving libations, are closely related to their antecedents at Yazilhkaya as the Moon-god is winged and his tiara is crossed by a crescent, a form developed for figure 35 at the sanctuary. There are also a relief of the Sun-god in the imperial form and one of the local king greeting the Storm-god who mounts a chariot drawn by bulls, a motif seen earlier in the neighboring Kizzuwatna. Malatya thus makes use of several images created late in the Empire, but numerous variations already indicate some changes in meaning.26 Three of the reliefs of Carchemish continue these imperial traditions. The Moon- and Sun-gods, standing on a lion, possess the same distinguishing features and stand in the same sequence as at Yazilhkaya and Malatya. Saugga, on the other hand, resembles the frontal goddess on the Imamkulu relief and the Louvre stamp-cylinder, as her garment hangs down both sides of her body; instead of a globular flask of water, she holds her breasts. In a relief of the two-headed winged lion, the contour of the neck indicates that the tiaraed head is added over the neck of the animal, a suggestion that the designer understood the divinizing head as functioning symbolically. Owing to the different materials (basalt and limestone) and variations in sizes of these reliefs, their original relationships are not clear.27 At other sites, the importance of the sun was paramount, and the imperial art traditions consequently much altered. At Yesemek, groups of two and three frontal Mountain-gods are overarched by the rising sun, its passage overhead, and the setting of the sun, symbolized as a series of rosettes. Numerous reliefs from cAin Dara in northern Syria each show a Mountain-god flanked by bull-men and other beings, all with arms raised to support a now missing element, perhaps a winged sun-disk. Water symbolism plays a smaller part at these two places.28 Tell Halaf, on the other hand, an Aramaic site in North Syria where a monumental sculptured portal and more than two hundred stone reliefs were found, produced an unusual glazed terracotta structure with the three elements in balance (fig. 9). Instead of representations, only symbols appear, as specially molded bricks create rows of rosettes, guilloche, and imbrications, signifying sun, water, and earth. Located in the plaza before the palace, the object was not a podium for sculpture or standards but was itself an ensign.29 26 Orthmann, Untersuchungen zur spdthethitischen Kunst, Malatya A/6, 7, 1 I1, and 5a in which the two goddesses, one wearing the male tiara, may represent the two aspects of Saugga, and D/ 1 as a representa- tion of the Sun-god alone. For a question on the representation of two Sauggas in the one relief, see Nolle Willemaers, "Une Identification contest6e d'Igtar-Saugga," Le Musion 56 (1973): 467-73. It is worth noting that, in the face of the long Bronze Age tradition of unabashed nudity, the Malatya sculptors covered the torso and upper leg of the female figure, a distinct change from the image at Yazilikaya. A similar reserve appears in the full- length garment worn by Saugga in the Mesk6n6 seal design as well as both nos. 19 and 23 of the Carchemish lapis and gold figurines. An explanation for this change would go far beyond the limits of the present study. 27 Orthmann, Untersuchungen zur spdthethitischen Kunst, Karkemish Bb/1, C/4, and E/8. 28 Ibid., cAin Dara D/ 1, 5, and 6; Yesemek 102; see also Alkim, Yesemek, pls. 33-37. The profusion of rosettes at Yesemek parallels their generous dis- tribution over the Megiddo plaque and the substitu- tion of rosettes for proper disks in the winged sun-disks. 29 Max Frhr. von Oppenheim et al., Tell Halaf 4 vols.

Certainly one center of innovation was at the capital city, Hattuga, and the imperial religious sanctuary, and one or more additional centers were in southeastern Anatolia and northern Syria. Special circum- stances brought into being a new image of Saugga. The uses of the new image and the old one reflected the development of religious speculation and regional iconographic preferences. Differences appeared as the models were adapted for other uses, and with greater distance in space or time diversity increased. We may generalize that water symbolism remained strong in Anatolia while the sun assumed greater importance farther south; yet the diversity was so great that other factors must have played a large role in determining the compositional variety that resulted from demands by different patrons according to beliefs prevalent in different regions. Several aspects of the composition of the Megiddo plaque referred less to Anatolia proper and more to Hittite northern Syria where the Sun-god dominated. Doubled, his image looms over the whole composition, and his presence is seen everywhere in the profligately distributed rosettes, like those on the reliefs of Yesemek. The bull-demon, too, appears in each of the rows of lesser figures, and his well-made horns provide support in a Syrian fashion. Prominent as supporter of the winged disk, the Janus- headed lion-man seems a purely Hurrian motif, probably reaching the Hittite world</page><page sequence="22">182 JOURNAL OF NEAR EASTERN STUDIES through Syria. Arms with abbreviated hands raised in support, while occurring at Eflatun Pinar and Imamkulu on the edges of the Hittite heartland, seem to be most common in Carchemish, a major Hittite court in North Syria. No doubt the ivory is Hittite in style, but its designer was steeped in the Hurro-Hittite traditions of south- eastern Anatolia and northern Syria.30 The plaque may have reached Palestine as booty of war, an item of trade, or as a diplomatic gift. A luxury piece of ivory, its religious-economic message was up-to-date in conveying best wishes for well-being. It may have conveyed a political message; because the Sun-god image was a variant of the Hittite king's, having the winged disk superposed, the ivory plaque would be a constant reminder to local rulers in Syria and Palestine of the power of their neighbor to the north, the Hittite great king. Yet it may have reached its final destination in Megiddo after the fall of the Hittite Empire. It was but one, and the only Anatolian, piece in a hoard of some three hundred ivories, gold, and other valuables in the treasure room of a palace. Despite previous wear from handling, it was no longer an object of daily use, and perhaps it was separated from its mounting with some care rather than by destructive force. Its value no longer lay in its religious, economic, and political messages, but in its material-ivory." 30 For supporters with raised arms, see the cylin- der seal designs of Ini-Tegub (Schaeffer, Ugaritica III, figs. 32, 34), Amanmashu (ibid., fig. 68), and Hilmi- Tegub and Shahurunuwa (Beyer, "Sceau-cylindre de Shahurunuwa," figs. 7, 10). These examples, all originating in Carchemish, present a chronological range from the end of the fourteenth to the late thirteenth centuries B.C. See also my article "A Hittite Cylinder Seal in the Fitzwilliam Museum," Anatolian Studies 25 (1975): fig. 4. 31 Barnett has suggested that during the uncertain times at the end of the Bronze Age, a ruler at Megiddo acquired and hoarded pieces of ivory as a form of wealth, without regard for the representa- tions and explicit or implied messages; see Barnett, Ancient Ivories, p. 25.</page></plain_text>
