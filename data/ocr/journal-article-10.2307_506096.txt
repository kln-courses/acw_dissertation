<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Program of the Palace of Assurnasirpal II at Nimrud: Issues in the Research and Presentation of Assyrian Art JOHN MALCOLM RUSSELL Abstract In this study I propose two hypotheses about the palace of Assurnasirpal II at Nimrud: first, that the re- lief decoration of Assurnasirpal's palace expresses a four- fold Assyrian ideology of military success, service to the gods, divine protection, and Assyrian prosperity; and second, that the subject of the decoration in each suite of rooms was influenced by the function of that suite. In order to test these hypotheses, I draw on two theo- retical approaches to understanding the meaning of architecture: Trigger's principle of monumental archi- tecture as conspicuous consumption, and Rapoport's phenomenon of the redundancy of cues in the architec- ture of complex societies. I conclude that the subjects of the reliefs may be identified with considerable con- fidence, that the architectural evidence and relief sub- jects reinforce one another in suggesting specific func- tions for each suite of rooms, and that relief carving served as an expression of conspicuous consumption by being carved in conspicuous locations.* INTRODUCTION Assurnasirpal II (reigned 883-859 B.C.), one of the most powerful kings of the ninth century, pur- sued a successful policy of territorial expansion and also carried out substantial building projects in the traditional capital cities of Assur and Nineveh. His primary architectural and artistic activity, however, was lavished on a new capital city, the former Mid- dle Assyrian provincial capital of Kalhu (modern Nimrud, biblical Calah, Xenophon's "Larissa"), on the east bank of an ancient bed of the Tigris River, some 35 km south of Mosul. Around his fifth year, Assurnasirpal moved the chief royal residence and administrative center of the realm from Assur to Kalhu and began rebuilding it on a massive scale, constructing a new city wall some 7.5 km in circum- ference, a palace, and nine temples. The most elab- orate of these structures was the palace- called the Northwest Palace in the modern literature-which filled most of the northwest quarter of the citadel mound. With the fall of Assyria in 612 B.C., the palace fell into ruins and became completely covered with earth and overgrown. It lay forgotten for 2,500 years, until it was rediscovered by a young British adventurer, Austen Henry Layard, in 1845. Layard excavated the state apartments, four large suites of rooms deco- rated with human-headed bull and lion colossi in the major doorways and slabs sculptured in low re- lief covering the walls. Some of these reliefs were sent to the British Museum. Many others found their way to collections in Europe and North America, and the remainder stayed in the palace, where they were eventually reburied. The palace was reexcavated by M.E.L. Mallowan (1949-1957) and the Iraq De- partment of Antiquities and Heritage (1956-present). The known area of the palace measures 200 m north-south and 120 m east-west, and it may orig- inally have extended further to the south and east * Versions of this study were delivered at the Metropol- itan Museum of Art, Bryn Mawr College, the University of Minnesota, the Society of Mesopotamian Studies in Toronto, Harvard University, Dartmouth College, and in my classes at Columbia University and Massachusetts College of Art- my research benefited greatly from the discussion generated on each of these occasions.

Plan of the state apartments, drawn by R.P. Sobolewski. (After Paley and Sobolewski 1987, plan 2; courtesy R.P. Sobolewski) (fig. 1). Its northern third was a large outer courtyard, the south side of which was the throne-room facade (marked D, ED, and E on the plan). This facade, along with several other major entrances to the palace, was decorated with human-headed bull and lion colossi. The walls to either side of the two preserved en- trances in the throne-room facade were lined with stone slabs carved in relief with foreigners bringing tribute before the king. Also carved on each slab, and on every other wall slab in the palace, was a text that we call the "Standard Inscription," which gave the name, titles, and epithets of the king, recorded his relationship with the gods, summarized his mili- tary achievements, and described the founding of Kalhu and the appearance of the palace. Beyond this was the throne-room suite, rooms B and F, which opened onto a smaller inner courtyard, Y (fig. 2). This courtyard was lined on its other three sides with suites of large state apartments, each en- tered through a large doorway flanked by human- headed bull or lion colossi: G and H to the east, S and X to the south, and WG, WH, and WK to the west. The walls of all the rooms in this part of the palace were lined with stone slabs, most of which were carved with relief images. STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM In the practice of scholarship, the conclusions we reach are strongly affected, if not largely predeter- mined, by the organization and form of presentation of the data, and the questions/hypotheses it occurs to us to formulate. Each of these factors is heavily influenced by the other. In the case of the Assyrian palaces, the ways scholars have organized the source</page><page sequence="4">658 JOHN MALCOLM RUSSELL [AJA 102 data have created perceptual hurdles that in turn have led to conceptual hurdles. In most university slide cataloguing systems, for example, the reliefs from the Northwest Palace are organized typologi- cally. This system is well suited to the user who de- sires images of "winged genii" or "king performing ritual," but provides no clue for someone who wants a relief from room S or room G. Likewise, until fairly recently the only publications of the Northwest Pal- ace reliefs were picture books and surveys that em- phasized specific slabs and details out of context. Apart from the historical reliefs in the throne room, the palace was not sufficiently well published as a whole to permit known reliefs to be grouped together by rooms. These existing categories both defined and restricted the available parameters for investigation. Specifically, this system was not suited to questions of meaning in context and precluded such investi- gation. As context was not available, scholars were limited primarily to iconographic and typological investigations. Important early studies of pictorial sequence in Assurnasirpal's palace focused exclu- sively on the historical narrative reliefs in the throne room, as these were the only complete sequences that had been published.' This situation began to change with the pioneer- ing work of Gadd and Weidner, who undertook the monumental task of tracking down Assurnasirpal reliefs all over the world, and ascertaining the orig- inal position of each of these reliefs in the palace. The primary source for such identifications was the appendix in Layard's Nineveh and Its Remains, which included a brief description of every relief Layard excavated.2 This task was continued by Stearns, Reade, Paley, and Meuszynski.3 Stearns published numerous additional reliefs and used rough draw- ings to reconstruct the decoration of entire walls in several rooms. Reade also published new reliefs and refined the previous reconstructions through the im- portant observation that all the slabs in a given room have the same number of lines of inscription, and that the number of lines varies from room to room. Paley contributed further observations on the ar- rangement of the reliefs and studied the textual vari- ants in the Standard Inscription. Meuszynski further augmented and refined this work, in part by draw- ing on data from new excavations in the palace, which uncovered many reliefs still in situ, as well as the bases of slabs that had been sawn off and removed, and which could then be matched up with known reliefs on the basis of their dimensions. He also pub- lished accurate reconstruction drawings of the sculp- tures in entire rooms. The culmination of this work was the three-volume publication of Assurnasirpal's sculptured rooms by Meuszynski, and Paley and Sobolewski, which allows us to look at the palace as a whole in a way not possible since Layard began to dismantle it in the mid-19th century.4 Here, every sculptured slab known from the palace is presented in catalogue fash- ion, with excellent reconstruction drawings that show the sequence of the reliefs in every room (e.g., fig. 3). There are also new plans of the entire palace, as well as detailed plans of each room (figs. 1-2). For all their indispensable utility, however, these volumes con- strain the data in certain ways as well. Their presenta- tion is ordered by Layard's system of alphabetical designation, which was determined by the sequence of his excavation, so that rooms are arranged in al- phabetical order as in the appendix to Nineveh and Its Remains, with slabs ordered according to Layard's similarly arbitrary numbering sequence. Further- more, the publication format of Meuszynski's vol- ume (but not those of Paley and Sobolewski) divided the reliefs from long walls into short sections to fit the width of the page. These subdivisions are usu- ally independent of architectural or compositional breaks in the images, and can seem quite disruptive, I A.

The reliefs are thereby presented in segmented se- quences, room by room, in an order that reflects the sequence of Layard's excavations and the state of Meuszynski's manuscript at his untimely death, but not the experience of a visitor to the palace. Similarly, the excellent new ground plans of the palace, while giving a good sense of its overall plan- ning scheme, conceal the impact and limits of in- dividual suites. Information that would have been readily available to a visitor moving from room to room is obscured by formal relationships that are visible only in the plan, such as wall thickness and the alignment of unconnected rooms. A notable example is the thick wall between rooms B and F (fig. 2). In plan, this wall has the visual effect of iso- lating B from F, and seems to associate F with rooms A, WJ, WI, and courtyard Y. In fact, a closer look shows that B and F form a single suite that is a consider- able walking distance from rooms A, WJ, and WI, spatial relationships that are immediately clear to someone walking through the building. Similarly, a glance at the plan (fig. 1) suggests that the palace was organized around a central courtyard, with two long parallel rooms on each side. This pattern of similarity obscures differences among the individ- ual suites, differences that become immediately clear when the palace is disassembled and each suite is viewed in isolation (fig. 4).

Finally, the convention of presenting reliefs sep- arate from their architectural context discourages the formation of intuitions concerning the relation- ship between relief subject and architectural place- ment. An example of the response one may have to these perceptual hurdles is in Irene Winter's exem- plary article on the throne room (room B) of Assur- nasirpal II, when she describes the decoration of the other rooms in the palace: "The same repetitive ap- proach was used in the decoration of most reliefs, as whole rooms were devoted to alternations of griffin- or human-headed 'genii' shown individually or flanking the 'sacred tree' Occasionally standing or seated figures of the king were included, often flanked by attendants, as in rooms G and H of the palace."5 I had a similar perception of these rooms when I wrote: "A different subject was depicted in rooms G and H, on the east side of the inner court, where the king accompanied by attendants was shown sitting or standing holding a bowl, engaged in an activity that may most plausibly be identified as pouring libations. The remaining sculptured rooms were all decorated with variations of a single subject: the 'sacred tree' flanked by winged deities, some with human heads and others with heads of birds."'6 Both of us seem to have been working from an im- pression derived from the repetitive effect of the reliefs as they are published, with the varied "narrative" reliefs from room B presented (alphabetically) first, followed by page after page of genii and kings. We did not consider these latter reliefs in their archi- tectural context. Such perceptual hurdles were overcome in two important articles, each of which focused on a sin- gle room of the palace. In Brandes's 1970 study of room G, his juxtaposition of plan with sculptures suggested an interpretation of the specific function of the room, namely as a venue for ceremonial ablu- tions.7 In 1981, Winter presented room B as a unified ensemble of architecture, sculpture, and in- scriptions, addressing issues of program for the first time in the literature on Assyrian art.8 In addition to overcoming limitations imposed by the state of the source material, Brandes and Winter also faced a series of difficult practical problems in making a visual case for their arguments. In simplest terms, the problem can be stated as follows: what visual con- ventions are adequate for the representation of sculp- tures in three-dimensional architectural spaces, that is, how can we allow our reader to see what we are talking about, given the constraints imposed by the two-dimensional, relatively small format of the printed page? This problem exists at several levels. First is the difficulty of conveying a view of an entire three-dimensional room on a flat page. Second is the difficulty of reconciling the convention of show- ing ground plans at relatively small scale, in order to emphasize overall planning, with the convention of showing drawings of reliefs at a much larger scale, in order to convey adequate pictorial detail. Present- ing sculptures in the context of plan requires a com- mon scale, which results either in a cumbersomely large plan or vanishingly small detail in the reliefs. Add to this the relatively small size of a standard printed page, and the constraints are serious. Brandes and Winter made their visual points with different conventions. Brandes used a complex sche- matic diagram9 consisting of an outline plan of room G with the positions and orientation of the relief subjects indicated by letters and arrows: R King facing right (a backward "R" shows the king - facing left!) G Genie facing right ("G" also shown backward for - a figure facing left) H Courtier facing right (it is not clear if the "H" - is reversed for a figure facing left) This sort of scheme is very useful for conveying the general arrangement of subjects, but in reducing every figure to one of three general symbols, it pro- vides no information about the variations in figure types or their attributes. Brandes's diagram is suit- able for making his own points, but the information it presents is so limited that it is useful only for that purpose. It does not lend itself to further contem- 5 I.J.

Winter's solution to this problem was both more direct and more evocative of the original effect of the sculptures in context. Starting, like Brandes, from an outline plan of the room, Winter placed scale reproductions of Meuszynski's excellent drawings of the reliefs in their appropriate positions along each wall, as if a bomb had gone off in the center of the room, tipping every slab outward. It is very easy with this diagram to place oneself either outside or in- side the room, and from that vantage point see the relief subjects in considerable detail. This form of reconstruction has two significant limitations: First, it is not able to diagram convex corners, as in door- ways, and so is not well suited to showing the tran- sitions between rooms. Second, when a scale diagram of a room the size of the throne room is reduced to the size of a printed page, the detail, and even subject, of individual relief slabs becomes difficult to distinguish. This was not a problem when the di- agram was reproduced across two pages in Winter's first publication of this material, but when reduced to a single page in her second publication, the two- register reliefs are at the margin of legibility."' If one wishes to go beyond a single room to pre- sent the decoration of an entire suite of rooms, the difficulties become increasingly severe, as one must deal both with the challenge of showing the tran- sitions between rooms, and with the necessity of either further increasing the page size or decreas- ing the scale of the illustrations. One possible solu- tion is to construct a model, either physical or vir- tual, and use images of this as the basis for analysis, as was done very effectively by Bergmann with the House of the Tragic Poet at Pompeii." This can be a very compelling tool for approximating the orig- inal effect of a structure on the viewer. The problem with a model is that it is difficult to translate its three- dimensional form into the two-dimensional format of a traditional publication. One is reduced to presenting the model as a series of snapshots, which gives the reader only a very selective portion of the total information contained in the model. In order for a model to convey the amount of information available in a schematic plan such as Winter's, a con- siderable number of discrete snapshots are required, and the relationship between one view and the next is not necessarily intuitively obvious. It will soon be possible to create and publish de- tailed computer models that users will be able to explore freely in virtual space, thereby duplicating the paths and vistas available to viewers in antiquity, and Assurnasirpal's palace would be an ideal subject for such a project.'2 For the moment, though, a more immediate solution to the problem of presenta- tion is required. My solution in this study is to jux- tapose the full plan of the palace with plans of the four individual suites and with full reconstructions of the decoration of each room, following the con- vention used by Winter. These latter were assembled with a computer, using the overall plan of the palace published by Paley and Sobolewski as the basis for the plan of each room, and using Adobe Photoshop to paste the relief slabs into position. In this way, wall slabs are juxtaposed with related features on the floors, and the reconstructions may easily be reduced, combined, and otherwise manipulated with- out loss of detail. This seems to me to be the best available way to present the maximum amount of information within a format that encourages the for- mation of independent hypotheses by the reader. My aim in employing this approach is to offer an interpretation of the relationship between the dec- oration and the function of various parts of the pal- ace, based on my reading of the layout of the relief decoration and a variety of other clues present in the architecture. I considered only the ground floor level, which is all that is preserved. It should be re- membered, however, that some activities may have been carried out in an upper story, if one was pres- ent, and may therefore not be reflected in the pre- served architecture.'3 I arrived at my interpretations 10 Winter (supra n. 8) fig. 2; Winter (supra n. 5) fig. 2. EA. Cooper, The Temple ofApollo Bassitas IV (Princeton 1992) pl. 58, solved the problem of scale when he used a similar convention in his reconstruction of the layout of the sculp- tures on the interior frieze of the Temple of Apollo at Bas- sae, but the 61 x 51 cm triple folio format of his publi- cation (with 100-cm foldouts!) is not a widely available publication option.

Following Brandes, Paley, and Winter, but expand- ing my investigation to all of the state apartments, I hypothesized that the relief decoration of the en- tire palace is a visual expression of Assurnasirpal's royal ideology.14 The palace reliefs suggest that the main points of such an ideology might be military success, service to the gods, divine protection, and Assyrian prosperity. Within this overall scheme, the subjects vary from suite to suite. This may perhaps be explained in part by proposing different primary functions for each suite. In testing this hypothesis, my approach is essentially art historical, based on close analysis of the imagery, heavy reliance on texts, and comparisons with other Assyrian palaces. I also utilize two theoretical approaches to understanding the meaning of architecture: Trigger's principle of monumental architecture as conspicuous consump- tion, and Rapoport's observation of the redundancy of cues in the architecture of complex societies. Clearly, Assurnasirpal's palace at Kalhu exemplifies what Trigger calls the principle of "conspicuous con- sumption"' that is, the excessive expenditure of energy (natural resources and other people's labor) as an expression of royal power. Palaces such as this one "become symbols of power because they are seen as embodiments of large amounts of human energy and hence symbolize the ability of those for whom they were made to control such energy to an unusual de- gree.15 While the palace building itself was perhaps the single most conspicuous public embodiment of this excessive consumption, its massive walls and ele- vation on the citadel simultaneously served to ex- clude the great mass of common Assyrians from par- ticipating in the royal activities that took place therein.'" These activities--royal audiences, enter- tainment, rituals, ceremonies, record-keeping- were often also characterized by conspicuous consump- tion of labor and resources, but in the private set- ting of the palace, the message was directed largely at the elite who participated in these activities with the king. Outsiders, by contrast, would readily have per- ceived the message of power and exclusion embodied in the architecture. Although we do not know what Assurnasirpal's palace looked like from the outside, in the later palaces of Sargon II and Sennacherib, the largest sculptures, including human-headed bull colossi and colossal human figures grasping lions, were placed on the exterior facade overlooking the city or landscape, and were probably easily visible from a distance." These extreme examples of con- spicuous consumption are the only palace sculptures that most people would have seen, thereby establish- ing a very high level of imagined expectation for the grandeur within. Indeed, it is exactly this aspect of Sennacherib's palace-viewed from afar with the city wall rising above the river, the citadel wall above that, and the colossus-lined facade of the palace at the top-that is depicted in a view of Nineveh carved on a wall relief in Assurbanipal's palace.' Sennacherib described the intended effect of his pal- ace: "for the astonishment of all people I raised aloft its head"' and Winter has argued that the effect of the palace on subjects and foreigners was there- fore a crucial part of its function.'9 For most people, however, as Bachelot observed, the inner workings of the palace could only be known secondhand, through reports and rumor, and these would inevi- tably be exaggerated, so that the message of the highly conspicuous exterior is reinforced by the imagined conspicuous consumption within.21 On the one hand, therefore, the king participated in a system of royal activities, at least some of which were characterized by conspicuous consumption, and on the other, the setting for at least some of these royal activities - the palace - is preserved in part in the archaeological record. But how are we today to recover these activities from the archaeological record, that is to say, how are we to locate royal ac- tions in their architectural context? This question is the focus of an article by Rapoport, in which he summarizes some 20 years of his research on the relationship between activities and settings.

The situation, the rules, and the ongoing and ap- propriate behavior are communicated by cues in the setting ... [which], if they are noticed and under- stood, act as mnemonics- they remind those enter- ing the setting of the situation it defines, of which rules apply and hence of how to act.'21 Rapoport observes that the study of individual ac- tivities and settings provides only part of the picture- activities and settings are parts of larger systems. Only some royal activities will take place in the palace. Royal authority is exercised through a system of activities, which may include activities such as processions, worship, and military command, and these are carried out in a system of settings. The palace is only a part of this system of settings, which may also include a range of public, sacred, and re- mote settings, some outside the palace, some outside the capital. In general, activities appropriate to the palace might be expected to be those that involve a considerable degree of exclusion or seclusion. In analyzing a system of settings such as that exemplified by a series of rooms in a palace, we need to consider such factors as who is included or excluded, which groups may enter which rooms, "the nature of the boundaries (e.g. closed, semi-permeable, permeable, open),' the arrangement and sequence of spaces, the reasons for or meaning of such sequences, and the linkages and barriers between settings.22 According to Rapoport, the activity environment consists of "fixed-feature elements (buildings, floors, walls, etc.), semi-fixed-feature elements ('furnishings', interior and exterior, of all sorts), and non-fixed- feature elements (people and their activities and be- haviors). Settings guide behavior (i.e. the non-fixed- feature elements) not only, or even principally, through the fixed-feature elements of architecture but through semi-fixed-feature elements which pro- vide essential cues; other people present and their activities and behaviors are also most important cues."23 Nonfixed features (people and their behav- ior) are, of course, not preserved in the archaeolog- ical record. Semifixed features may or may not be preserved. In Rapoport's terminology, architecture contains activities only loosely. In theory, a great range of ac- tivities may take place within a single setting, even so formal a setting as a room in a palace. The use of a given space may be influenced by factors such as its location within the palace, the time of day or season of year, the nature and requirements of the audience being accommodated, and the number and availability of spaces required by the system of ac- tivities (i.e., if there are more activities than discrete spaces for their performance, then some spaces will serve multiple purposes). The function of the room under these different conditions may be altered by the placement of movable furnishings or may sim- ply be determined by the consensus of those pres- ent. In interpreting the archaeological record, the possibility of multiple uses combined with the ab- sence of the living actors "makes analysis of semi-fixed cues critical'"24 But what if original semifixed cues are not pre- served? What if, as was the case with Assurnasirpal's palace, the building stood for centuries, outlived its original function, and was eventually used as a store- house? How then can we recover the original func- tion of palace rooms? For that matter, what about the loss even of fixed cues, such as the paintings that originally covered the walls above the reliefs in many of the rooms, but of which only a few fragments have survived?25 Fortunately, a ray of hope is provided here by the phenomenon of redundancy of cues. Rap- oport observes that "as scale, size, complexity, and heterogeneity (cultural pluralism) of a society go up, more cues as well as stronger cues are needed to com- municate effectively."26 This in turn leads to an in- crease in the number of specialized settings intended for specific activities, and these are clearly differen- tiated from one another. The Assyrian state was a complex, heterogenous society indeed, and we may suspect that the activity settings in its royal palace would therefore exhibit a high degree of differen- tiation among settings and redundancy of cues. Given the degree of conspicuous consumption evident in the palace, we may also hope that some of these cues were expressed in a conspicuously permanent form in the architecture itself. My goal in this study is to look beyond the edge of the individual relief slab to try to identify sculp- tural and architectural cues in Assurnasirpal's palace 21 A.

Sobolewski) that are clues to the nature of the activities that took place therein, and by extension, to determine the primary function of the rooms. I believe that even though the palace furnishings are missing, there are still enough permanent cues present to generate hy- potheses about function. The analysis that follows commences with the suites of rooms around the inner court of the palace, moving from west to east to south, from relief subjects that would have been readily understandable to a general audience, to more esoteric subjects that would probably only have been fully understood by the king and his court. It concludes with the throne-room suite, where all of these subjects come together, and the throne-room facade, which introduces another relief subject that would have been meaningful to a broad audience. WEST SUITE The relief decoration in the principal rooms of the west suite (rooms WG and WK/BB, figs. 2, 5) was poorly preserved, largely because many of its wall slabs had been removed in the seventh century B.C. for use in the nearby palace of Esarhaddon. If the evidence of its successor palaces is a valid guide, then this suite of rooms was second in importance only to the throne-room suite (fig. 6). Similar suites - three parallel long rooms, opening onto a terrace or courtyard at both sides, and projecting perpendic- ularly from and connected directly to the throne- room suite-occurred in each of the next three Assyrian royal palaces.27 In the arsenal ("Fort Shal- maneser") at Nimrud, built by Assurnasirpal's suc- cessor, Shalmaneser III, this suite was copied almost exactly (rooms T22-27), augmented by the addition of three rooms in between (T10, 20-21; fig. 7). Here, however, the suite projects onto an open terrace with no further rooms beyond. It is not certain how Shal- maneser used this building, which his texts call sim- ply a "palace," but his successors used it as an arsenal- a place to muster troops and to store and maintain military equipment. Nevertheless, the pres- ence of a monumental throne-room suite suggests the palace's use as a venue for royal audiences, and it is probably significant that this and the project- ing wing were the only parts copied directly from Assurnasirpal's palace. In other words, these two suites were the only ones necessary for this building to function as a royal palace. The next new palace for which the plan is pre- served is that of Sargon II at Dur Sharrukin (Khor- sabad), where this suite of three parallel rooms oc- curred twice: rooms IV, 19, and 20, which directly copy the plan and location of the west suite of Assurnasirpal's palace, and rooms 1-9, 11, and 12, 27 G.

Sobolewski) a wing that projected northward from the main body of the palace onto an open terrace in the manner of the comparable suite at Fort Shalmaneser (fig. 8). One room in this latter suite, room 8, was fitted with a throne base and was clearly a subsidiary throne room, while the wall reliefs in another large room, room 2, included scenes of banqueting, suggesting one possible use for this room. Also in the arsenal at Dur Sharrukin (Palace F), the plan of the two prin- cipal reception suites follows that of Fort Shalma- neser, with the suite of three parallel rooms project- ing out from the throne-room suite onto a terrace (fig. 9). Again, these two distinctive suites were the only ones that seemed to be considered essential. In addition to their physical proximity to one an- other, the throne-room suite and west suite in Assurnasirpal's palace were directly connected by a doorway in room E These two suites were also di- rectly connected in Fort Shalmaneser (by room T21) and Sargon's palace (by room V) (figs. 7-8). In all three cases, communication between these two suites was convenient and private. By contrast, there was apparently no interior connection between the throne-room suite and the projecting wing in Palace F or Sargon's palace, which suggests a greater degree of functional independence. The Assyrian designation of this distinctive group of three parallel rooms in Assurnasirpal's palace may be preserved in a set of threshold slabs labeled as "from the Second House"' published by Paley.28 They were found in a secondary context and their orig- inal placement is unknown. On the basis of the com- bined width of the three slabs, Paley suggested that the ensemble was the right size for one of the major doorways in the west suite, and in their latest pub- lication, Paley and Sobolewski opt for room WK, door e.2 If these slabs are indeed from the west suite, then the name they preserve supports the impres- 28 S.M.

Mallowan, Nimrud and Its Remains [London 1966] plan 8) sion given by the architecture that this was the sec- ond most important suite in the palace- the "First House" would presumably be the throne-room suite, though no such designation survives. There may be textual evidence for one function of the "Second House;' whatever it might have been. A group of court officials called the sa bUti zani, "men of the Second House," served the king and his high officials at feasts in the palace. It is not clear from the texts, however, whether their title derived from where they worked, in which case "Second House" might mean "banquet hall," or from where they lived, in which case it might mean simply "servant quar- ters," which would presumably have nothing to do with the west suite.3s That the first translation may be correct is suggested by the banqueting scenes on the upper register of the reliefs in room 2 of the projecting wing of Sargon's palace, which is archi- tecturally similar to Assurnasirpal's west suite. I will return to this similarity shortly. The west suite is the only part of the palace be- sides the throne room in which two-register reliefs with military and hunting subjects were found (fig. 10). Because of its proximity to the edge of the mound, the wall slabs from this suite could easily be removed for use in the construction of Esarhad- don's palace, and a number of reliefs that were ap- parently from this area were found in that palace. Several others were found either still in place or on the ground in the west suite, and most of these seem to have originated at the north and south ends of the suite. In 1852, Hormuzd Rassam found a num- ber of fragmentary slabs that show bull and lion hunts in the area west of room A. In this area, the unsculp- tured bases of five slabs still survive in room WI, a small paved bathroom or ablution room, and it is 3o K.E Miiller, "Das assyrische Ritual. Teil 1.

A number of similarly appointed rooms occurred in the east suite (J, K, M, O, R) and another one (U) was adjacent to the south suite. Their function is un- known, but as I suggest below, their lack of sculptural decoration suggests limited access; they may have been storerooms for portable furnishings.33 ' WFL-10, 11, 13, 16, 28, 29.

Indeed, one Assurnasirpal relief that shows a bull hunt and several that show military sub- jects were found reused in Esarhaddon's palace, and these must have originated in the west suite.36 By contrast, only two examples of single-register reliefs are known from the west suite: a slab showing a winged deity from the south wall of room WJ, and the lower part of a deity on a slab that originally stood by a doorway in room WK.37 In addition, Paley and Sobolewski restored a winged deity on the west jamb of door b in room WG.38 Rassam also re- ported a (two-register?) slab with small figures of bird- headed and anthropomorphic deities, perhaps in or near the niche in the west wall of room WI.39 The picture of the relief decoration of the west suite that emerges from this is certainly not as de- tailed as one would wish, but the general organiza- tion seems fairly clear. Of the three small rooms at the north end of the suite, room A was lined with unsculptured slabs carved with the Standard Inscrip- tion, room WJ was decorated with winged deities in one register, and room WI may have been dec- orated with hunts in two registers. Of the three large rooms, room WG, the reception room that opened from court Y, was decorated with military narrative reliefs and perhaps also hunting scenes, while room WK, the large reception room that opened onto the west terrace, may have displayed hunting scenes, with protective deities at the doors. Of the two center rooms, WM may have contained hunting scenes and there is no record for the decoration of WH. The most interesting conclusion to be drawn from this is that though there may be some doubt concerning the precise original location of the reliefs from this suite, there is no doubt that the great majority of the known reliefs that originated in this suite dis- played narrative subjects of a type that occurred otherwise only in the throne room. If this sample is representative of the decoration of the entire suite, then the theme in these rooms was evidently royal power: the king's ability to con- trol Assyria's expanding territory and subdue the en- emies of Assyrian order. In the case of human ad- versaries, these images show the king, in the words of the Standard Inscription, as "the one who by his lordly conflict has brought under one authority fe- rocious [and] merciless kings from east to west."''4 The theme of the hunts is arguably similar-by "conquering" wild lions, which kill livestock, and wild bulls, which trample and eat crops, he subdues territory for Assyrian economic development by de- stroying the enemies of husbandry and agriculture. Tribute from the periphery and the control of agricul- tural resources both insure Assyrian prosperity. Since this was the only suite in the palace that over- looked the Tigris, and was therefore well ventilated and scenically sited, these may have been the rooms of choice for court activities that did not require the formal setting of the main throne room, possibly being used as a secondary throne room and for such occasions as state banquets. This suggestion is sup- ported by a comparison with the apparent functions of rooms 8 and 2, the two principal reception rooms in the architecturally similar, scenically located pro- jecting wing of Sargon's palace at Khorsabad. Room 8 was fitted with a throne dais, a strong architectural cue that it served as a secondary throne room. No fixed fittings were reported in room 2, but the im- agery on the two-register wall reliefs combined scenes of banqueting in part of the upper register, with mili- tary campaigns in the lower and the remainder of the upper. If the reliefs are read as fixed cues, then we may hypothesize that room 2 served in part as a banquet hall, and that military imagery was also considered appropriate decoration for such a setting. The plans of Assurnasirpal's rooms WK and WG are very similar to the plans of rooms 8 and 2 at Khor- sabad, and since the Khorsabad suite ultimately de- rives from the one at Nimrud, the functions of these rooms in the two palaces may well have been similar. If the west suite at Nimrud should prove to be the "Second House,' as suggested above, this would pro- vide further support for the idea that its functions included royal entertaining.

Sobolewski) feature elements that can clearly be identified with banqueting is not in itself surprising; a text that de- scribes the protocol for a royal banquet specifies that all of the banquet furnishings were brought into the room at the beginning of the meal, and were re- moved after it was over, confirming Rapoport's ob- servation on the possibility of multiple uses for a space.41 Whatever the function of the rooms, the narrative relief images on the walls of the west suite would have served their occupants both as reminders of the effectiveness of the power at the disposal of the king and as statements of the king's tireless ac- tivity as protector of Assyria from its enemies. The subjects of these reliefs would also have been much more readily understandable to visitors than the sub- jects of the east and south suites, which would seem to make this the suite of choice, along with the throne room, for entertaining and impressing visiting for- eign dignitaries. EAST SUITE The east suite (rooms G-O, R) was apparently a ceremonial complex devoted to liquid offerings, and may even have housed the palace shrines. Mallowan, Paley, and Reade suggested that the decoration of room G, where some images show the king holding a cup, may depict royal banqueting, and Stronach also identified this subject as wine drinking.42 The cup is never shown held to the king's mouth, how- ever, and as I show below, a closer examination of the details of these images makes banqueting an un- likely interpretation. By contrast, also on the basis of the relief decoration, Brandes suggested that room G was a space for ceremonial libation or lustration in which the king's weapons were either consecrated or purified of the blood of slain foes.43 This seems to me to be closer to the meaning of the images, but for a clearer understanding it is necessary to go be- yond room G and consider the decoration and ar- chitecture of the entire suite. The plan of this suite is distinctive (figs. 2, 11). In- stead of being open to the outside on both sides, as were the throne-room suite and the west suite, only the outer reception room, G, and its southern exten- sion, N, were accessible from the rest of the palace. The interior location of the remaining rooms is em- phasized in the plan by the presence of one or more ventilation shafts in the walls of each of them.44 Such shafts, which occur only in rooms that lack an outside entrance, served to ventilate otherwise en- closed spaces and may also have admitted a limited 41 Miiller (supra n. 30). 42 M.E.L.

The outer room (G) is comparable in plan and location to rooms B, WG, WK, and S, large rooms that open onto a courtyard or terrace, of a type that Turner refers to as "reception rooms." The second room (H) is comparable in location to rooms F, X, and WH, large inner rooms that Turner calls "retiring rooms," though in the case of room F there is access also to the outside. The west, south, and throne-room suites are each planned around one or more recep- tion rooms, a retiring room, and perhaps a few small side rooms, and none of the large rooms are far re- moved from an outside door. The east suite, by con- trast, adds a third row of rooms (I-M) deep inside the palace, far from the air and light of the courtyard. Two of these rooms, I and L, are relatively large and, like G, H, and N, are decorated with wall reliefs. What could be the purpose of these deeply recessed rooms? The archaeological remains from room I were plentiful but unhelpful. This was one of the few rooms for which Layard reported the contents: con- siderable quantities of pieces of armor in iron and copper, including several helmets, a number of stone vases, some of which were inscribed, and an inscribed vase of glass.46 Unfortunately for our purposes, all of the inscribed vases bore the name of Sargon II, who restored the palace and used parts of it as store- rooms. The excavated contents of room I, therefore, relate to its evident function as a storeroom in the late eighth century, and probably provide no indi- cation of its use at the time of its construction in the early ninth century. The architecture itself may be more helpful. One suggestive indicator is the floors in this suite - seven of the nine rooms here are paved either with stone slabs (J, K, M, O, R) or baked bricks and stone slabs (I, L), a much larger concentration of paved rooms than in any other suite in the palace. Since pave- ment is apparently reserved for rooms that are ex- posed to flowing liquids, and as there was no evi- dence that these rooms were open to the sky, the implication here is that there was intensive use of liquids in this suite.47 In addition, four of the five back rooms (I, J, L, M) are furnished with a niche in the wall. In room L and probably I, there was a drain in the floor in front of this niche, while in J and M there was not.48 I and L also each had a large stone slab carved with a shallow U-shaped basin on the floor against both their north and west walls. The plans of rooms I and L are unusual- "L'- shaped, with a narrow unpaved corridor giving ac- cess to a separate stone-paved room with a niche (J and M) and then opening into a broader stone- and brick-paved space equipped with a niche and drain. To my knowledge, there is no parallel for the plan of these rooms or for such a concentration of paved rooms in any other Assyrian palace. In the throne- room suites of later Assyrian palaces, however, a door- way next to the throne base opens into a paved room with niche and drain, for example, room 25 in Pal- ace F at Khorsabad. This innovation may be a sim- plification of the arrangement in the Northwest Pal- ace, where an entire suite of paved rooms is located adjacent to the throne base, directly accessible from the throne room via doors b and a in room F (fig. 12). The direct internal access between the east end of the throne room and the east suite, which is iso- lated from the other suites, suggests that the activ- 45 For mirrors, including large mirrors, in ancient Meso- potamia, see CAD, NIl (1980) 219-20. Any evidence for the use of reflective surfaces as a means of directing sunlight into interior rooms has disappeared, as any object with a large polished surface would have been carried off or corroded away. The principle is simple and easily put into practice, however. Our perception of windowless Assyrian reception rooms as dimly lighted may be incorrect if a few strategically placed servants with large mirrors, or even polished shields, could have directed bright sunlight into their remotest corners. With mirrors, the supposedly dimly lighted palace reliefs could have been illuminated for vis- itors in the same manner as Egyptian tomb reliefs are to- day, and the gilded and brightly painted architectural fittings in the upper part of the rooms could have been made to shine, as Sennacherib says, "as bright as the day- light" (CAD, NIl [1980] 218). 46 Layard (supra n. 2) 341-43. 47 It is possible that all of the rooms were originally paved, and that the pavements in the large reception rooms were completely robbed away, while those in the inner rooms were untouched. In that case, however, we would expect the pavement bricks from the central court Y to have been robbed as well, but most of them are still in place, suggesting that the pavements in the palace are pre- served much as they were in antiquity. 48 Room L: Layard (supra n. 2) vol. 2, 5-6. Layard did not report a drain in the niche in room I, but that does not mean one was not there. The deep niches in the south wall of room J and the north wall of room M appear to be doorways into room H that were blocked off when slabs 10 and 27 were erected in room H. I do not know if this represents the original plan or an alteration at the time the wall slabs were erected, but the relief sculpture on slabs 10 and 27 is evidently contemporary with that on the neigh- boring slabs.</page><page sequence="19">1998] THE PROGRAM OF THE PALACE OF ASSURNASIRPAL II 673 b C E- E ED D 2524 20 23 22 21 0 5 10 15 20 25 30m Fig. 12. Comparison of the layout of the throne room and east suite of Assurnasirpal's palace with that of the throne room and ablution room (25) of Sargon's arsenal. (After Paley and Sobolewski 1987, plan 2, and G. Loud and C.B. Altman, Khorsabad, Pt. II [Chicago 1938] pl. 75) ities in the east suite may have been closely connected to those carried out in the throne room. One final fixed feature may provide a clue to the importance of this suite. The wall reliefs in room I differ in two respects from those elsewhere in the palace. First, room I is the only room known to have been decorated entirely with reliefs of apotropaic figures in two registers. Everywhere else, such figures occupy a single register the full height of the slab. Second, room I is the only sculptured room in the palace in which the wall reliefs are inscribed with a variety of texts. In the remainder of the palace, wall slabs in unsculptured rooms carry a text called "Standard Inscription Type A," in combination with a shorter text originally composed for burial in the palace walls. Wall slabs in sculptured rooms all carry a later text called "Standard Inscription Type B." In room I, however, all three of these texts were used</page><page sequence="20">674 JOHN MALCOLM RUSSELL [AJA 102 interchangeably.49 The implication here is that this was the first sculptured room to be completed, before the standard text and relief format for the other sculptured rooms had been finalized. If this is true, then this suggests that, as it is the closest room with a niche and drain to the throne room, the function of room I was so important that it had to be finished first. To summarize the fixed architectural features, the east suite displays a unique arrangement and con- centration of paved rooms, one or two of which were equipped with drains. It is adjacent to and connected with the end of the throne room with the throne, and one of its rooms seems to have been the first decorated room in the palace to be finished. All of this suggests that this suite served a critical and spe- cialized function that involved liquids. These archi- tectural cues are reinforced by the arrangement and subjects of the relief decoration in the east suite.50 Doorway Figures Before describing the doorways of the east suite, it will be helpful to have some idea of the repertoire of supernatural figure types that are used.5' Apart from the bull and lion colossi in major doorways, there are three general types of apotropaic figures in Assurnasirpal's palace: a winged anthropomor- phic figure wearing the horned crown of divinity, a winged anthropomorphic figure wearing a head- band decorated with rosettes, and a winged human figure with the head of a bird. Occasionally the wings are omitted from anthropomorphic figures carved in narrow spaces, but as the attributes of these wing- less figures are identical to those of their winged counterparts, this omission is probably solely a func- tion of available space, and is not meant to designate a different type of figure. Occasionally the figure with the horned crown is depicted with four wings, in- stead of the usual two. I suggest below that this extra pair of wings may designate an especially powerful figure. Bird-headed figures are never shown wingless or with four wings. In order to identify these apotropaic figure types, we must turn to texts that describe the uses of such figures to protect houses and their occupants. Wig- germann has collected and edited a series of texts that prescribe the rituals for the production and placement of protective figurines "to block the en- try of the enemy in someone's house? Though the dated examples were written in 750 B.C. and later, well after the construction of Assurnasirpal's palace, they describe figure types that apparently occur in the palace reliefs, and it seems reasonable to sup- pose that such figures served the same function a century earlier. Although the best-preserved texts deal with protective statuettes that were buried un- der the floors, there are references in other texts to similar figures "drawn in the corners" or "drawn in the gate:' which indicates that the figure could ex- ercise its apotropaic function whether it was executed in two dimensions or three.52 Unfortunately, the various anthropomorphic figures, both with and without the horned crown of divinity, in the palace reliefs cannot be identified specifically with the numerous anthropomorphic figures listed in the figurine texts. The texts do, how- ever, list an apkallu ("sage"), described as a "guardian" with the face and wings of a bird, holding in its right hand a mullilu, or "purifier," and in its left a banduddi2, or "bucket." This must be the bird-headed guardian figure in the doorways of Assurnasirpal's palace, which always holds a bucket in his left hand and a pinecone-shaped object, evidently the purifier, in his right. Wiggermann has plausibly identified the ac- 4. Paley (supra n. 3) 145-47 was the first to note that Types A and B both occur in room I, and to suggest that room I was the first of the decorated rooms to be com- pleted. I was able to refine this chronology based on study of Layard's hand copies of the Standard Inscription from most of the slabs in this room (Russell, supra n. 6). 51 In addition, two types of fixed-feature cues associated with doorways are preserved archaeologically in Assur- nasirpal's palace: the wear patterns on the threshold slabs, and the number of door leaves and the direction they open in each door. I did not consider these here, as it was not clear to me how they might be relevant, but others may be able to do so. The wear patterns we see today are the result of the usage of the building over its entire history, and it is not possible to distinguish those created when it was a palace from those created when it was a storehouse. Doors may be fastened from either side, so the direction they open does not necessarily allow us to distinguish which side was less or more secure. 51 My analysis of the apotropaic figures in the doorways was inspired by the excellent work of Mary M. Fulghum, a graduate student in the Department of Fine Arts at Har- vard University, whom I acknowledge with gratitude and thanks ("The Double Duty of Doorway Figures in the North- west Palace of Assurnasirpal at Nimrud," unpublished sem- inar paper, Neo-Assyrian Seminar, Harvard University, spring 1996). Although we focus largely on different as- pects of these figures, several of her observations are cited here. 52 Drawn figures: Wiggermann (supra n. 30) 90, 110, 121. One apotropaic wall relief figure in a door ofAssurbanipal's palace, a lion-centaur, was even inscribed with the same magical incantation prescribed for statuettes of the same figure, further proof that it was an active presence and not mere decoration (Barnett [supra n. 18] 40, pl. XX).</page><page sequence="21">1998] THE PROGRAM OF THE PALACE OF ASSURNASIRPAL II 675 tion depicted here as sprinkling-the purifier is dipped in the bucket, which contains holy water, and then held aloft and flipped forward with a sharp snap of the arm and wrist, throwing a shower of droplets outward onto whatever is to be purified.53 In Assurnasirpal's palace, the bird-headed figure always holds the bucket and purifier. The anthropo- morphic figure with horned crown may be repre- sented in a variety of ways: holding the bucket and purifier, making a gesture of greeting or blessing (karibu) with the upraised right hand and holding a stalk of flowers or a mace in the lowered left hand,54 holding a stalk of pomegranates (?) in the upraised right hand and a mace in the lowered left hand, or touching a stylized tree with both hands. He never holds an animal. The anthropomorphic figure with headband is usually shown making the gesture of blessing with his raised right hand while holding a stalk of flowers, a mace, or a bucket in his lowered left. A few examples hold a goat or deer in one hand and a stalk of palmettes or a palm frond (?) in the other. This figure never holds the purifier. Al- though the attributes he holds all have apotropaic powers, the manner in which this figure deploys those powers is generally passive, allowing the mere pres- ence of the bucket, mace, or flower to block evil from the door, rather than actively projecting its power forward, as do the figures with sprinklers. Turning now to the doorway reliefs of the east suite, the principal entrance to the suite from courtyard Y was through door b, which was lined with a pair of colossal human-headed winged lions whose func- tion was evidently both to guard the door and to draw attention to it (pl. I and fig. 13). The other ex- terior entrance to room G, door c, displayed two pairs of apotropaic figures -a pair of wingless deities hold- ing purifiers and buckets facing out into the courtyard, and a pair of wingless figures with head- bands facing into the room, holding maces in their left hands and making a gesture of blessing with their right. This door was further guarded by a pair of bird-headed winged human figures carrying the purifier and bucket on the wall slabs (21 and 22) in- side the room adjacent to the door. It appears that such figures were originally planned for the two wall slabs (26 and 27) flanking the center door as well, but only one was carved, perhaps due to lack of space. From the architectural placement of these vari- ous figure types, it seems clear that the figures with the purifier and bucket were purely apotropaic, as they were positioned in doorways oriented so that they provided active protection from threats outside the room, purifying whatever passed through. The figures that make the gesture of blessing, by contrast, seem not to have been primarily apotropaic, but rather served to greet or bless the legitimate occu- pants of the room, primarily the king, as they passed through these doorways to other parts of the palace. Nevertheless, this figure has apotropaic potential as well, as the mace held in his left hand is one of the tools used by the exorcist to drive away evil.55 The other exterior entrance to the east suite was from passage P into room N (figs. 2, 14-15). The out- side wall adjacent to this door was carved with a pair of deities holding the purifier and bucket, protect- ing room N from outside intruders. The example east of the door is winged, and that to the west wing- less, evidently due to lack of space on the narrow slab. There is a second figure at the east side, a winged deity facing away from the door, holding a mace and making the gesture of blessing. The doorjambs here were also carved with a pair of winged deities mak- ing the gesture of blessing and holding the mace, oriented to greet the king as he passed out of room N into passage P. The three other entrances to room G were from other rooms. Door a from room F in the throne-room suite was protected only by a pair of wingless hu- man figures with headbands, holding a stalk of flowers and making the gesture of blessing, carved on the slabs of the outer jamb facing outward into room E There was room for a second pair of figures on the innerjamb slabs, but these were left uncarved except for the Standard Inscription. The absence of figures with purifiers in this door suggests that those entering from room F did not require purifi- cation. Rather, this door's architectural proximity to the throne-room suite and its relief subject are redundant cues that these figures greeted the king, who would presumably have used this door in pass- ing between these two suites. The identity and func- tion of the plant in this figure's left hand are uncer- tain.56 The only textual mention of a flower held by apotropaic figures is later, in a text of Sennacherib, 5 Anthropomorphic: Wiggermann (supra n. 30) 73-79.

Door d from room N was well protected, with a pair of bird-headed winged figures with purifier and bucket on thejamb, and a pair of winged deities with purifier and bucket on the wall adjacent to the door both in room N and G. The last door, e, connects room G with room H in the interior of the suite (fig. 16). The jambs on the room G side of this door were carved with a pair of winged deities with purifier and bucket facing toward room G. The jambs near- est room H, by contrast, were plain except for the Standard Inscription, though again they could eas- ily have accommodated a second pair of figures. There were three more sculptured doorways in the east suite, all on the east wall of room H, which gave access to the innermost group of rooms (I, K, L; figs. 17-18). The jambs in each of these doors (b, c, d) were carved with a winged deity with purifier and bucket, but all of these figures have four wings, unlike all but one of the other winged figures in the suite, which have only two.58 Likewise, though doz- ens of two-winged figures occur throughout the rest of the palace, four-winged figures are found in only a few other locations-- on the wall of the niche in room L of the east suite (L-20), on the throne-room facade (E-5, D-1), and beside door c of the throne room next to the throne base (B-26, 26a)- and in each case the location seems to be particularly strategic. Four-winged figures seem to be fairly common, by contrast, in temples, at least as far as can be de- termined from the limited evidence. In the Ninurta temple at Nimrud, a pair of slabs that showed a thunderbolt-wielding four-winged deity driving out a demon was found in door 2, and two more pairs of four-winged figures may have been in door 3.59 In the Assurnasirpal II building in the center of the Nimrud citadel, evidently also a temple, a four- winged human figure carrying a fawn and plant was found between a colossal bull and lion on the en- trance facade, and a pair of four-winged scorpion- men flanked door b, probably the door to the sanctu- ary, while a four-winged figure between two rampant 57 CAD, I-J (1960) 88. 58 I am grateful to Leigh-Ann Bedal, a graduate student in anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania, for draw- ing my attention to these four-winged figures. 5,J A.H.

To summarize the evidence of the doors, the outer doors to the east suite were protected by a combi- nation of wingless and two-winged figures, the doors between room G and rooms H and N were guarded only by two-winged figures, and the doors between room H and the back rooms were guarded only by four-winged figures. The pattern here seems to be an increase in the number of wings the further into the suite one moves. A figure with purifier and bucket stands in every door, except the one from room E When they are on a jamb, these figures always face outward, while figures with a mace face inward. This distribution of figures gives the strong impression that every door except the one communicating with the throne-room suite was felt to need whatever sort of protection the purifier afforded. Furthermore, the frequency with which four-winged figures occur in Assurnasirpal's temples, in contrast to their scar- city in his palace, may be cues that the inner rooms 60 R.D. Barnett and M.

King Holding a Bowl The decoration on the interior walls of the rooms in the east suite is more varied than one might sup- pose from a glance. The first images one would see upon entering room G through its central door are the pair of subjects on the east wall directly oppo- site, on slabs 9-12 (fig. 13). At left, on slabs 9-10, is the standing king facing right, holding a bowl in his upraised right hand and a bow in his left. Before him is a courtier with flywhisk and towel, while a courtier with mace, sword, bow, and quiver stands behind. At right, on slabs 11-12, is the king facing right, holding a pair of arrows in his upraised right hand and again a bow in his left. He is flanked by a pair of winged deities who hold the purifier and bucket. The same pair of subjects is repeated, with minor variations, along the entire length of the east wall. The group of the king with bowl occurs three more times here, and in all three cases the courtier who faces him carries a ladle in addition to the towel and flywhisk. On the southern part of this wall, from slabs 12-16, the subjects alternate, so that there are two more images of the king with bowl and one more of the king with arrows. At the northern end of the east wall, on slabs 6-8, the same pair of sub- jects is shown, but their order is reversed. This dis- tribution of these two subjects has three results, any or none of which may have been deliberate. First, images of the king with bowl flank door e, which leads to the interior of the suite. Second, the other two "outer" doors to room G, doors a and c, each afford a different initial view, the king with arrows opposite a and the king with bowl opposite c. And third, the east wall gives a slight emphasis to the king with bowl, which occurs four times, over the king with arrows, which occurs only three. I will re- turn to these points shortly. The other long wall of room G, the west wall, is decorated with nearly the same subjects, but with at least one significant difference. This may be seen on slabs 29-30, which are directly opposite door e, and therefore the scene visible to someone entering from room H. Here we see the standing king, now facing left, again with a bowl in his right hand, but now with his left hand resting on the hilt of his sword (he does not wear a sword on the east wall). He is flanked by the same two courtiers, but the one in front lacks the ladle. It is probably no accident that on the floor directly in front of this image of the king is a large rectangular stone ablution or libation slab. The viewer from door e, therefore, sees an im- age of the king holding up a bowl directly above a furnishing designed to receive liquids. A similar slab, but apparently without the central depression, is in the southwest corner of room G, and another is in the northwest corner of room N. The same group of the king with bowl and sword is repeated on the wall to the south of door b, so that this door too is flanked by a pair of images of the king with bowl. The remainder of the west wall is occupied by two images of the king with bow and arrows flanked by winged deities, similar to the ex- amples on the east wall, but with the king facing left. Both long walls, therefore, feature alternating groups of the king with bowl and a weapon, and the king with bow and arrows. The arrangement of these groups emphasizes the king with bowl, which is placed directly opposite three of the four doors in the long walls (the exception being the door from the throne-room suite, possibly the king's personal entrance), flanking both sides of the two main doors in the long walls (b and e), and directly above the ablution/libation slab opposite door e. This image, therefore, is the first thing one sees upon entering and the last thing one sees on exiting through these main doors. A similar situation exists with the view from door d, which connects rooms N and G. Again the reliefs opposite the door, slabs 2-4 at the far end of the room on the north wall, show the king with a bowl, but in this case a single unique composition occu- pies the entire wall. Here the king sits on a deco- rated chair and footstool, weaponless, a bowl in his raised right hand, the courtier with towel, ladle, and flywhisk in front, two courtiers behind-one with a flywhisk and the other with a mace - both with bow, quiver, and sword, all bracketed by a pair of winged deities with purifier and bucket, one at either end. This dominant image confirms the emphasis in this room on the king with bowl. The equivalent wall in the throne room is where the throne base is located. In room G, therefore, this image of the enthroned king marks his place in this room, and when the king was present, the image would have reinforced the impact of his enthroned person. This also explains why all of the images of the king on the east and west walls face south, the same direction as the en- throned king himself. At this point, we should consider the question of</page><page sequence="29">1998] THE PROGRAM OF THE PALACE OF ASSURNASIRPAL II 683 what the king is doing in these images in which he holds a bowl.61 Certainly it is possible to suggest that the king is about to drink from the bowl, but the prominence of weapons in these scenes would seem to argue against this being a banquet scene, as does their alternation with scenes of the armed king with deities. Less decisive, but still noteworthy, the bowl is never held near the lips of the king and no other banqueters are shown. In fact, there is considerable textual and visual evidence that the king is shown here pouring a wine libation, a suggestion made ten- tatively by Brandes, but dropped in favor of purifi- cation through lustration.62 I have already noted the juxtaposition of one such scene with an actual ablution/libation slab in room G. In a text that de- scribes the building of Nimrud, Assurnasirpal states: "I pressed wine and gave the best to Assur my lord, and the temples of my land."63 This statement finds support in the Nimrud Wine Lists, a series of wine ration texts found in Fort Shalmaneser, the Nimrud arsenal. Though the earliest of these lists dates to 784, nearly a century after the beginning of Assur- nasirpal's reign, the types of rations remain consis- tent for the 50-year span covered by the dated lists, and it seems likely that the same types of rations would apply in Assurnasirpal's reign as well. The first entry on all the lists is a substantial wine ration for ginu2, "the regular offering" for the gods and for cer- emonial purposes.64 The lists include additional ra- tions for ceremonial purposes as well: suratri, "liba- tion offering," for specific deities, sa qaqqiri, "for li- bations" (lit. "for the ground"), and ina nubatti, "for the evening ceremonies"; perhaps the rations sa W.rti, "for the morning ceremonies" (?), and sa ka-sa-te (GIS.GU.ZI.MES), "for cups," are for ceremonial pur- poses too."65 Unmistakable visual evidence for the king pouring wine libations is found on the so-called White Obe- lisk, probably dating either to the reign of Assur- nasirpal I (1049-1031 B.C.) or to the second year of Assurnasirpal II, which includes an image of the king standing before a cauldron, incense stand, and offer- ing table in front of a temple. His pose is identical to that of the king with bowl in room G, with the bowl in his raised right hand, except that there is no bow in his left hand and the bowl is tipped slightly outward. The image is accompanied by an epigraph: "The Bit-nathi of the city Nineveh: I perform the wine libations (and) sacrifices of the temple of the exalted goddess."66 In the throne room, two relief images of the king with bowl leave little doubt that he is shown in the act of pouring libations (B-19, 20). Both images show the aftermath of a hunt, with the slain bull and lion at the king's feet. He stands in exactly the pose of the room G reliefs, with the upright bow in his left hand and the upraised bowl in his right. While he is neither shown drinking nor pouring, a comparable image found fallen into room S of the palace of the seventh-century king Assurbanipal at Nineveh actu- ally shows the libation being poured over the dead lions. To erase any doubt, the Assurbanipal relief includes a caption: "I, Assurbanipal, king of the world, king of Assyria, whom Assur and Mullissu have granted exalted strength. The lions that I killed: I held the fierce bow of Ishtar, lady of battle, over them, I set up an offering over them, [and] I made a liba- tion over them."' Admittedly Assurbanipal is a later king, but the identical subjects and the very similar mode of depiction strongly suggest that both kings are performing the same action in these hunting scenes. Because the pose of the king in the hunt 61 The images are unlikely to show oil divination, as there is no evidence for this practice in the Neo-Assyrian period (CAD, Sh/1 [1989] 326-27). 62 Brandes (supra n. 7) 153-54. 6 3 Nimrud Monolith, Grayson (supra n. 16) 252, lines v.9-10. 64J.V.K.

Examples include the White Obelisk, directly adjacent to the temple libation scene, band N of the bronze doors of Shalmaneser III, a ninth-century ivory panel from Nimrud, the upper registers of the reliefs in rooms 2 and 7 from the palace of Sargon II at Khorsabad, and the garden banquet relief found fallen into room S of Assurbanipal's palace at Nineveh.6- In all of these examples the drinkers are seated, and in all but one (Shalmaneser III), the king is accompanied by other drinkers. Based on this comparison, only the relief of the seated king on the north wall of room G could represent tne king drinking, and surrounded by so many apparent images of libation, even that seems uncertain. King Holding Arrows As Assurnasirpal sat enthroned at the north end of room G, the image facing him at the other end of the room was that on slabs 5-7 in room N, which shows the king with a bow and a pair of ar- rows (fig. 15). As we have seen, the same image is placed opposite the door into room G from the throne-room suite, shared space with the king and bowl opposite the central door, and was also placed to either side of the king, on slabs 6-7 and 30-31, as he sat enthroned. The placement of these images gives the impression that while the motif of the king with bowl is emphasized for anyone entering or stand- ing anywhere except at the throne end, from the king's perspective the image of the king with bow and ar- rows is paramount. The king's personal identification with this image is even stressed in the decoration on the tunic of the enthroned king in room G, which includes two images of the king with bow and arrows flanked by a pair of winged deities-- the same image that is on the walls.7? Similarly, in at'least one im- age of the king with bow and arrows on the long walls, his garment decoration includes this motif (G-11), and it is likely that it occurred on royal garments throughout the room.7' Once again, the meaning of this representation is not self-evident, but there is ample comparative material from which to propose suggestions. The mo- tif of the king with a bow and a pair of arrows is popular in Neo-Assyrian art, but does not seem to be attested much earlier. The earliest example I know is on a stele of the Babylonian king Marduk-nadin- ahhe (1099-1082 B.C.), where the king is shown alone with the bow in his upraised left hand and the pair of arrows in his lowered right hand.72 The major difference between this figure and the ones of As- surnasirpal II in room G is that the Babylonian king's pose would allow him to fire the bow easily, whereas the reversed bow resting on the ground in the As- surnasirpal images presents no immediate threat. In Assurnasirpal's own reliefs outside of room G, the king with bow and two arrows occurs in three general contexts. The first is the lion hunt, for which there are two reliefs that show the king hunting lions from his chariot, with bow drawn and arrows at the ready in his right fist (B-19-a, WFL-13). An Assyrian eunuch archer is shown in the same pose in a battle scene (WFL-21), but the king himself is not shown this way in battle--the closest comparable images show the king shooting the bow from his chariot with a single arrow in reserve in his hand (WFL-21), and the king with drawn bow and an attendant holding the two arrows ready for him (B-18-a), a pose that is also used for an Assyrian eunuch archer (WFL- 22). In the same relief, an Assyrian eunuch with his bow at rest and a pair of arrows held up in his right hand leads a procession of prisoners out of a defeated city. There are also two instances of enemy archers shown holding the bow and two arrows, but not shoot- ing, in one case because he is mortally wounded, and in the other perhaps due to fear (B-4-b, B-17-a). In most of these cases, the intent seems primarily to show the reality of archers in action, with the first and second rounds in hand ready for quick firing, even if, in the case of the enemy, they will never have the chance to shoot.

There are three such images. In one, the triumphant king is shown returning to his fortified camp after a battle. His bow is held low- ered horizontally in his left hand, with its string down, and a pair of arrows is held up in his right hand (B-5-a). Above him, a deity in a winged disk assumes the same pose, with a bow in the same position but no arrows in the raised right hand. A second relief shows the king traversing mountainous country in his chariot (WFL-19). He holds his bow and arrows in the same position as in the previous relief, except that the bow string is up, so that the weapon is ready for use. In a third relief, the king crosses a river stand- ing in his chariot, which is on a boat (B-9-b). His bow and arrows are held in the same position as in the mountainous image. In reference to the second im- age, Reade interpreted the position of the bow and arrows as symbolizing victory.73 This could certainly be the case with the first image, but in the other two, the moment depicted seems to be the approach of the king and his army, not the aftermath of battle. It may be preferable therefore to interpret this im- age in all three cases as a reference to royal might, and specifically the might of the king. The pair of arrows upraised, then, would be both an attribute of kingship and a symbol of power. The third context for images of the king with bow and two arrows is in booty and tribute processions. Examples occur on both the single- and double- register wall reliefs, and in garment decoration. Two examples of booty processions were found in the throne room (B-7-b, B-18-b). In both cases, the king holds the bow and arrows the same way as he does in his chariot, with the bow gripped in his hand as if ready for action. In one of these he is accompanied by the god in the winged disk, who again mimics his pose, but holds a ring instead of a bow and has no arrows. In a relief from room WG (WFL-24) that shows the king reviewing either booty or tribute (the procession itself is lost), the king's left hand holds the top of the bow, which rests vertically on the ground, the string facing outward, with a pair of ar- rows in the upraised right hand, in the same pose as in the reliefs in room G. The king is in this same pose in the large-scale tribute procession on the throne-room facade (D-2), and in an apparent trib- ute procession on the garment decoration of an apo- tropaic figure on a relief beside the outer door to room N (P-2).74 As in room G, the bow in these rep- resentations is not readily usable, which gives the sense that its role here is mainly symbolic. Once again, in the case of the booty reviews the bow and arrows could symbolize victory, but for the tribute processions the more general interpretation of royal might seems preferable. In the art of Assurnasirpal's successors, the recur- rence of the motif of the king with his bow resting on the ground and a pair of arrows held high lends support to the idea that it is an emblem of royal might. In the reliefs of Shalmaneser III, this is the standard pose for the king receiving tribute and booty on the bronze doors from Balawat, in the trib- ute processions on the sides of his throne base, and in the tribute processions on the Black Obelisk.75 Only a few of these images represent military vic- tory; the great majority depict acknowledgment of the king's power through delivery of tribute. On the Black Obelisk, which dates to the end of the king's reign, five tribute processions from far-flung regions are depicted converging on the king, who only ap- pears twice, once in each of the top two registers. Interestingly, he is depicted in two different ways: holding the bow and two arrows in the top register, and holding a bowl and resting his hand on his sword hilt in the second. In both images, a winged disk and star are in the field before his face, evidence of divine sanction. This pair of images, the same two that are shown in room G, evidently suffices to ex- press the essential aspects of kingship, which here seem to be military might and divine service. The motif is much less common in reliefs of the eighth and seventh centuries. It recurs in the reliefs of Tiglath-pileser III in the context of a booty pro- cession, in which the king holds the bow up as if ready for use, serving as a threat as well as an em- blem of power, and in an image of the king standing before an apotropaic figure, where the bow and arrows are held in the same position as in room G.76 In the relief series that depicts Sennacherib's victory at Lachish, the king reviews the booty while en- throned, holding the bow and arrows in the same position as in Assurnasirpal's room G.77 And in a lion hunt relief fallen into room S of the North Pal- 73J.E.

In addition, in the As- surbanipal relief, the bow and arrows are combined with the bowl, juxtaposing the physical and divine aspects of kingship even more closely than in the Black Obelisk. Returning now to room G, we find the king dis- playing the bow and two arrows in the same pose as in tribute processions, but here he is flanked by winged deities with the purifier and bucket. The formal similarity between the figures of the king and the deities is noteworthy- the king's pose is very sim- ilar to that of the deity who stands behind him, they both wear crowns and similar garments, and their faces and jewelry are identical.79 Although not shown as a god, he is in their likeness. By contrast, in the neighboring images where he holds a bowl, the king's visage is clearly distinguished from those of his beardless courtiers. This recalls a claim by Assurnasirpal's grandfather, Adad-nirari II, that when the gods created him, "they altered my stature to lordly stature, they rightly made perfect my features, and filled my lordly body with wisdom.'8" In these images the king and his weapons, the su- preme manifestation of terrestrial royal might, are purified by protective deities. This serves as a re- minder that the king's weapons are very special. In the Standard Inscription carved on every wall slab and in the text carved on the colossi and throne base, Assurnasirpal gives the source of his weapons: "As- sur, the lord who called me by name (and) made my sovereignty supreme, placed his merciless weapon in my lordly arms."81' The weapon of Assur is not specifically identified here, but in the palace reliefs the weapon used by the king in battle is always the bow. Furthermore, the bow is also the weapon used by the gods who accompany the king in battle: it is held by the god in the winged disk, probably Assur or Shamash, who hovers above the king in battle (B-3-a, B-5-a, B-11-a), and also by the god Adad, who is represented on royal standards as charging into battle standing on the back of his bull with bow drawn (B-4-a, B-6-a, B-8-b, B-10-a).82 The bow is also one of the martial attributes of Ishtar, as in a late eighth- century British Museum cylinder seal where she holds a bow and pair of arrows vertically in her left hand in a pose that recalls that of the king in room G.8` Finally, in the Middle Assyrian "Broken Obe- lisk;' probably dating to the reign of Assur-bel-kala (1073-1056 B.C.), the Assyrian king holds tethered foreign captives while a god in the form of a winged disk offers him a bow, evidently a literal represen- tation of the descent of the divine weapon from god to king.84 What are we to make of the alternation of images of the king with bowl and king with bow in the re- liefs in room G? Brandes noted that the king here appears in the roles of priest and military leader, and that in both roles the focus of activity seems to be on his weapons. He suggested that the cere- monies represented here may have recorded cer- emonies actually held in room G, ceremonies that involved invocations for divine favor and purifying lustration. The reliefs, therefore, would be highly visible fixed-feature cues to the function of the room. Furthermore, he noted the curious fact that the king as priest is shown in human company, while the mili- tary leader is accompanied by divinities.85 Both of these groupings stress the king's role as a link between humans and gods - the human high priest who tran- scends his fellows by reaching out to the gods, and the human commander-in-chief whom the gods have singled out from his fellows to receive their favor. These two aspects of kingship are explicitly linked in the text on the Nimrud Monolith, a large stone stele that commemorates the foundation of the Northwest Palace: "[Assurnasirpal], provider of offer- ings for the great gods, legitimate prince, to whom is perpetually entrusted the proper administration of the rites of the temples of his land, whose deeds and offerings the great gods of heaven and under- world love so that they (therefore) established for- ever his priesthood in the temples, granted to his dominion their fierce weapons, (and) made him more marvellous than (any of) the kings of the four quar- ters with respect to the splendour of his weapons (and) the radiance of his dominion286 This text establishes service to the gods as the pre- 78 Barnett (supra n. 18) pl. 59. 79 Budge (supra n. 56) pl. 33. 80 Grayson (supra n. 16) 147; cited in I.J.

The king's reliance on this divine support is stressed repeatedly in the lan- guage of the Standard Inscription, carved on each of these relief slabs. This text begins not with the usual royal titles and genealogy, but rather by invok- ing the gods of Assyria: "Palace of Ashurnasirpal, vice-regent of Assur, chosen of the gods Enlil and Dagan, destructive weapon of the great gods" The same theme recurs at the beginning of each new sec- tion of the text: "valiant man who acts with the sup- port of Assur, his lord, ... the king who acts with the support of the great gods, his lords. . . . Assur, the lord who called me by name (and) made my sov- ereignty supreme, placed his merciless weapon in my lordly arms. ... With the help of the gods Sha- mash and Adad, the gods my supporters, I thundered like the god Adad, the devastator, against [enemy] troops. . . . Pious prince, worshipper of the great gods"'87 Seen in this light, the numerically and publicly predominant images of the king with bowl establish the fact of the king's service to the gods. He holds his bow or sword in these images to draw attention to the desired reward, which is then granted in the reliefs that show the king in the presence of deities who purify these god-given weapons. The importance of the libation ritual for the power of the weapons is made explicit on slab 8, an image of the king with bowl, where the scabbard of the king's sword is dec- orated with a miniature image of this very scene, sug- gesting that the power of the sword derives from the offerings to the gods.88 What we see in room G, therefore, are not so much vignettes of royalty, "the king as priest" or "the king as military leader," but rather images of divine service and divine sanction as the legitimation of royal might. The king as priest and military leader makes offerings to the gods, who reward his service by granting their power to the weapons in his hands. The more publicly positioned images of the king libating account for the images of divinely sanctioned royal might that are directly juxtaposed and identified with the person of the king himself. Stylized Tree There is one further subject on the walls of room G, a subject that, like the apotropaic figures, occurs in nearly every sculptured room in the palace. This is a stylized palm tree, carved on each of the four monolithic corner slabs in the room. There are ap- parently no references to such a tree in Assyrian texts, but in the modern literature the motif is referred to either as the "tree of life," or by the ostensibly more neutral designation "sacred tree." Clearly, a consid- erable amount of interpretation, if not preconcep- tion, is embedded in either designation. "Tree of life" evokes biblical associations, while "sacred tree" pre- supposes that the tree is an emblem that is either associated with a deity or is itself an object of ven- eration. Both terms promote certain interpretations at the expense of others. In fact, there is no consen- sus either on the meaning of the motif for the As- syrians, nor on its function in the decorative pro- grams of Assyrian palaces. In a recent volume of the Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Parpola advanced the controversial hypothe- sis that the Assyrian "tree of life" is a complex eso- teric emblem of the Assyrian pantheon and religion, and that its full meaning would have been trans- mitted only orally to a "few select initiates." Parpola assumed that in the reliefs of Assurnasirpal II the tree represents the "divine world order." He observed that in Assurnasirpal's reliefs apotropaic figures "usu- ally flank the tree" and sprinkle it with holy water. He also noted that "in some reliefs the king takes the place of the Tree" between these apotropaic figures, which he felt is evidence that the king here is the human personification of the "Tree."89 In the same volume, Porter argued that the "sacred tree" of Assurnasirpal II was a symbol of"agricultural abundance" She identified a "tree scene," which con- sists of two winged figures, each of which holds a bucket and extends "an oval object toward a stylized tree-like object between them"' The elements of this tree scene may also occur separately- the tree by itself may serve as a "spacer" between tree scenes, and the winged figures with their "characteristic ap- paratus and gesture" may also stand on their own. The implication here seems to be that the "tree scene" is the fullest statement of an idea that may also be evoked by the representation of any of its constit- uent elements, that is to say, the part may stand for the whole. Porter persuasively demonstrated that the oval object in the hand of the winged figure resem- bles the male flower cluster of the date palm, and that what is depicted is the process of date palm pol- 7 Grayson (supra n. 16) 275-76.

She countered the objection that date palms will not bear fruit and are prone to die from frost in Assyria by making that the very basis of the tree's appeal. The Assyrians chose to represent the date palm, she argued, "precisely because it was not part of their daily agricultural life, but was already at one remove from it and was thus readily transformed in their art into an emblem of agricultural abun- dance as a divine gift"'90 Furthermore, Porter suggested, the palm image may have been popular in Assyria because of its occasional association with Ishtar, the "goddess of sexual fertility," and Albenda arrived at a similar conclusion in her discussion of "sacred trees" on As- surnasirpal reliefs in the Brooklyn Museum. Albenda then argued that if the "sacred tree" is a divine sym- bol of Ishtar, "the so-called pollination scene must then portray the Assyrian king and genies as receiv- ing energy and powerfrom the tree, rather than fer- tilizing it." Because of their highly stylized appear- ance, Albenda assumed that "the model for the sacred tree on the stone reliefs was an object of concrete form," that is, an artificial tree that was used as a piece of cult furniture.91 The trees in the reliefs ap- pear stylized, therefore, not because they themselves are idealizations, but rather because they are literal copies of concrete pieces of furniture. This is not a new idea. Some years ago Paley observed that the notion that "sacred trees" are images of actual cult furniture was based on a misunderstanding of texts that refer to the decoration of doorposts. In fact, there is neither textual nor archaeological evidence to support the existence of "sacred trees" as cult furniture.92 These and most other interpretations of the tree fall into three general categories, roughly correspond- ing to Peirce's semiotic classification of sign types: icon, index, and symbol.93 The most common read- ing of the tree, exemplified by Parpola, is as a symbol, variously equated with the Assyrian pantheon, agri- cultural abundance, fertility, or Assyrian prosperity. The minor deities that often flank the tree contrib- ute to its symbolism, either by fertilizing it with a male pollen cluster or by cleansing it with a purifier. Alternatively, Porter saw the tree essentially as an index for what she designated the "tree scene," con- sisting of the tree together with its attending deities. Wherever the tree occurs alone, it refers to this "com- plete" image, which she interpreted as literal fertil- ization, and by extension, symbolic fertility of the land. The isolated tree, therefore, is an index for the tree scene, which in turn is a symbol of fertility. Fi- nally, Albenda suggested that the stylized palm tree was to be read as an icon--a visual replica of an ac- tual cult object having this form. While it is not possible to disprove any of these interesting hypotheses, it should be noted that there is no compelling evidence in their favor either. In- deed, on the basis of the available visual, textual, and contextual evidence, the stylized palm tree in Assurnasirpal's palace serves a basic function that is quite different from the interpretations offered by Parpola, Porter, and Albenda. Part of the prob- lem with their hypotheses, and with most current interpretations of the stylized tree, is that they focus on only a selection of the total number of such images in the palace. For purposes of interpretation, these studies consider only the group that consists of the stylized tree flanked by a pair of winged figures with oval object and bucket. Parpola considered this to be the standard arrangement, which permitted him to observe that when the image of the king ap- pears between winged figures, then the king must be identified with the tree. Porter characterized this group as her "tree scene" and consigned trees with- out figures, and figures without trees, to the cate- gory of tree scene elements, which refer to the tree scene without actually participating in it. This state of affairs does not seem entirely satis- factory.

Why would their winged deities be shown carrying out an agricultural pro- cedure that would have no meaning for Assyrians? If the tree scene is meant to function as a unit, then why is it not represented complete every time? How can some trees be the emblem of divine maintenance of agricultural abundance, while others are mere spacers? What purpose can be served by the polli- nation of the king, or of Ishtar, by winged divinities? If the tree symbolizes fertility, then how does it re- late to Ishtar, the goddess of sex, who has little to do with agricultural fertility? If the tree symbolizes Ishtar, then what is her role in this context? While these reservations do not necessarily disqualify the interpretations of Porter, Parpola, and Albenda, they do suggest that the question of the meaning of the tree deserves yet another look. Part of the problem here seems to be too narrow a concentration on certain relief scenes, without tak- ing into account their surroundings. Both Parpola and Porter follow the usual practice of reproducing images of the tree flanked by winged figures, with- out looking at these scenes in context. Neither con- siders the context of images of the tree shown with- out winged figures. In fact, my survey of all 190 large-scale images of the stylized tree published in Meuszynski's and Paley and Sobolewski's volumes showed that the majority of trees (54%) were depicted without attendant winged figures, and only 41% be- longed to the supposedly typical group with two winged figures (table 1). The most obvious implication of this numerical survey is that the stylized tree does not require winged attendants in order to perform its function, a point made already by Stearns some time ago.94 The illu- sion to the contrary is fostered by the publishing practice of showing primarily images of trees flanked by deities. Similarly, winged figures holding the pu- rifier do not require the stylized tree in order to per- form their function; as we have seen, they are fre- quently depicted separately from the stylized tree, whether in doorways or in compositions that include the king. In these contexts, the role of the winged figures is clearly apotropaic, and this function is confirmed by the inclusion of apparently identical figures in texts that prescribe the rituals for the protection of a house.

In Shalmaneser's palace at Nimrud, "Fort Shalmaneser," there was a 4-m-high decorated arched panel of glazed bricks above the rear entrance to the throne-room suite. The central element of this composition was a stylized tree, consisting of a cen- tral trunk surmounted by a palmette, surrounded by tendrils tipped with alternating palmettes, pome- granates, and pinecones. No winged figures were present-instead the tree was flanked by a pair of rampant bulls.95 The only place stylized trees are known to have occurred in Tiglath-pileser's palace is in corners. One example is similar to those in Assurnasirpal's reliefs, with a palmette-topped trunk framed by a contin- uous row of palmettes, while one or two other ex- amples had the same central trunk, but framed by a row of alternating cones and pomegranates.96 The images adjacent to the tree are preserved in two of these examples, and in both cases they show not winged figures facing the tree, but rather the end of battle scenes in two registers. Layard reported finding winged figures on two different slabs in Tiglath-pileser's palace. Only one of these slabs has been illustrated, in a rough sketch that shows only the inscribed part, from which it appears that it pre- ceded a figure in a fringed robe. Layard did not say 94 Stearns (supra n. 3) 70-71. "5J.E. Reade, "A Glazed-Brick Panel from Nimrud," Iraq 25 (1963) 38-47. 96 E.

Here, stylized trees occurred without attendant figures in the cor- ners of three rooms that were decorated with single- register reliefs (rooms 4, 8, and 14). A group consist- ing of the stylized tree flanked by two wingless figures holding pomegranate stalks was found on thejambs of door 1 in room 13 and on the wall near a corner in monument X. Botta observed that this group was not found elsewhere in the palace.98 Winged human and bird-headed figures with the purifier and bucket, by contrast, always occur in or flanking doorways in Sargon's palace: colossal examples on doorjambs and on the buttresses and facades to either side of doorways, and small examples stacked two or three high - sometimes all human, sometimes with a bird- headed figure at the top and human figures below- on the wall beside gateway bull colossi.99 These figures never occur together with the stylized tree, so it is clear that they are meant to function inde- pendently of one another. Similarly, colossal human figures with the purifier and bucket were placed behind the bull colossi in the gates of the city and citadel.'00 In City Gate 3, the facade of the arched gateway was faced with glazed bricks decorated also with the same type of figure, either pointing his purifier toward the door or toward rosettes, which alternate with the winged figures in the same position that the stylized trees occupy in Assurnasirpal's reliefs.10' A similar ar- rangement was found in the wall painting in the prin- cipal reception room of Residence K at Khorsabad, where winged figures above point their purifiers toward the image of the king, while those below point theirs toward rosettes.102 To my knowledge, no one has suggested that the winged figures in these images are pollinating the rosettes. This repertoire of winged figures, stylized palms, and rosettes, so well established in imperial Assyr- ian architectural decoration of the ninth and eighth centuries, is even reflected in the "figures of cher- ubim, palm-trees, and open flowers" reportedly carved on the walls of Solomon's temple (1 Kings 6:29). The date of composition of this passage is un- certain, and therefore it is not known whether this description was influenced by knowledge of Assyr- ian buildings or whether it represents a separate oc- currence of these types in Israel. It is nevertheless suggestive that "cherub" is evidently an Akkadian loan word. Its root, krb, is otherwise unattested in Hebrew, but we have already encountered it in the Akkadian verb (karabu), which Wiggermann identified with the gesture of greeting or blessing made by many of the apotropaic figures in Assurnasirpal's palace. "Cher- ub" may also be related to protective figures of un- certain form called kdribu and kurTbu, evidently gen- eral terms for "blessing figure.""103 In addition, in the Assyrian-style ivories from Nim- rud, there are numerous panels decorated with winged human and bird-headed figures holding the purifier and bucket. Sometimes these are associated with the figure of the king, but never with a stylized tree. By contrast, there are very few examples of a stylized tree on Assyrian-style ivories.1"4 The evi- dence of Assurnasirpal II, therefore, suggests that the stylized tree and winged figures with purifier and bucket could function independently of one another, and in the examples of Shalmaneser III, Tiglath- pileser III, and Sargon II, as well as in the ivories, the two were always separate. In reconsidering the function of the stylized tree, therefore, I propose to ignore previous interpreta- 97 A.H.

In so doing, I follow Barbara Parker Mal- lowan, whose brief essays on the apotropaic figures in Assurnasirpal's palace are the best studies of this subject to date.")5 Her fundamental contributions to the understanding of these figures may now be augmented by the wealth of textual material assem- bled by Wiggermann in his study of protective figures. On the basis of this evidence, I concur with her suggestion that the stylized tree should not be seen as the recipient of beneficial attention, but rather as a powerful apotropaic agency in its own right. In room G, and in most of the other sculptured rooms in the palace, the stylized tree is carved on the slabs in the corners of the room. Trees in this location may be accompanied by winged figures with purifier and bucket, but usually they are not. Com- positionally, this is an ideal location for the tree - as the only Assyrian motif that displays perfect axial symmetry, it fits the awkward angle of the corner per- fectly. But that does not seem to be a sufficient ex- planation for its presence in the corners of a room such as G, where each corner slab could just as easily have been carved with a pair of figures back to back, more in keeping with the subject of the rest of the reliefs there. The selection of the tree for this par- ticular location suggests that it served a specific purpose. The eighth-century figurine texts indicate where each type of figure is to be placed in the building in order to provide the desired protection, and the locations specified in this way are presumably those that are vulnerable to demonic penetration. One such location is corners, both in the courtyard and in rooms adjacent to courtyards.106 If this holds true for Assurnasirpal's palace as well, then the stylized palm trees in the corners of the rooms must be per- forming an apotropaic function. Indeed, with the exception of the king, courtiers, and historical sub- jects, every figure type represented in the palace is apotropaic. As Rapoport's theory predicts, the place- ment of different figure types is context-specific, sug- gesting that the selection was determined by the char- acteristics both of the location and the figure. As we will see, images of the tree and deity with purifier are concentrated in particularly sensitive rooms in the palace- in what are probably bathing rooms and the king's private apartment- suggesting an apotro- paic rather than symbolic function. The most radical interpretation of the tree has been offered by Parker Mallowan, who suggested that the image of the stylized palm tree was to be read as a stylized palm tree.1"7 Parker Mallowan has been the only scholar to introduce external evidence for her interpretation. She questioned the tree's value as a symbol of agricultural abundance or fer- tility, observing that the date palm is of no agricul- tural value in Assyria, as it will not bear fruit and tends to die in the cold climate. Instead, she observed that palm fronds and offshoots occur in Assyrian texts as apotropaic instruments for exorcism, and that the stylized tree was carved in the corners of rooms, a liminal zone vulnerable to demonic entry. The function of the stylized tree therefore, she ar- gued, should be apotropaic. Parker Mallowan's inter- pretation has generally been ignored, apparently because it contradicts the evidence of our eyes: the long ancient Near Eastern visual tradition for fig- ures flanking a tree (though not these figures or this tree), and the apparently clear interaction between this stylized tree and the figures who flank it. My own analysis, however, strongly supports Parker Mallowan's interpretation. In Babylonian texts, palms occur in a variety of contexts, primarily agricultural, reflecting the fact that the date palm is of major economic importance in Babylonia. By contrast, in Assyrian texts, virtually all of the references to palms are in apotropaic con- texts or relate to exorcism. For these purposes, both the palm frond and the palm offshoot are prescribed, either held by protective figures, or placed on the sick person by the exorcist."' In both of these con- texts, the function of the palm frond is to repel evil, and thereby to purify or protect whatever is in its vicinity. The Babylonian origin of these exorcism texts is clear from their liberal utilization of the palm frond and offshoot, which are common waste prod- ucts of date culture and easily available there. In As- syria, by contrast, palm by-products would either have to be imported or harvested from the limited stock of immature local trees, which may have made them less generally accessible and hence more desirable. Interestingly, Wiggermann observes that the pine- 10 B.

This suggests that the object that looks like a pinecone in the hands of apotropaic figures probably is in fact a pine- cone.'09 The male pollen cluster of the palm, by con- trast, is never mentioned in Assyrian texts. Therefore, the activity depicted here is purification rather than pollination. Based on these textually attested uses of the date palm and pinecone, it would appear that Assurnasir- pal's "sacred tree" is to be identified with the palm offshoot or frond, and that the primary function of both the tree and cone is apotropaic, defending vul- nerable spots such as doors and corners from evil intrusions, protecting the image and person of the king, and through multiple repetition, creating highly secure spaces within the palace. Indeed, in Assurnasirpal's palace, the stylized tree looks very much like a palm tree surmounted by its character- istic plume of fronds forming the central axis, sur- rounded by an arc of smaller offshoots (the palm- ettes), called "suckers" by growers, which sprout near the base of real trees.110 Since both the fronds and offshoots are apotropaic, this combination should provide powerful protection indeed. To return briefly to Peirce's typology of signs, it appears that Parker Mallowan also conceives of the tree as an icon - not a literal likeness, but a repre- sentation of a palm tree nonetheless. In fact, how- ever, -what she is describing here is not primarily a sign at all, but rather an object- a potent apotro- paic object that itself has the power to banish evil. As with the figurines, the tree as object empowers the Assyrians by giving them a permanent way to control the security of their environment. The rep- resentation of the tree, therefore, would be analo- gous to the Assyrian sciences of divination and ex- orcism, placing them in control of, rather than being prey to, the forces of chaos. This hypothesis receives further support in the relief decoration of room H. Here the sole occur- rences of the stylized tree are in the corners and be- neath the four air shaft openings, where they are depicted together with a pair of bird-headed apkallu holding the purifier and bucket. Though this is Porter's archetypical "tree scene," it now appears that the relationship between the figures and the tree is not one of mutual dependence, but rather func- tional similarity. The tree and apkallu are actually both performing the same function, namely ward- ing off evil. The primary difference between the two, it seems, is directional. The power of the apkallu is focused in the direction the figure faces, and pro- tects against threats from that quarter. This makes it ideal for direction-sensitive locations such as door- ways, where the image frequently occurs. The power of the symmetrical stylized palm, by contrast, should emanate in all directions, making it suitable for centralized locations such as corners and under the center of air shafts. The actual explanation for the "tree scene" group beneath the air shafts in room H, therefore, is not that this potential entrance for demonic intruders was decorated with an emblem of agricultural abundance, but rather that the tree protects the center of this vulnerable space, while the two apkallu face inward toward the opening from either side, performing the same function. The ap- parent interaction between the figures and the tree, as Parker Mallowan observed, is due only to the ar- tistic decision to crowd these independent apotro- paic elements together in order to fill the available space."' Elsewhere in room H, a single subject predomi- nates: the king, with or without his sword, holding the bow in his left hand and a cup in his upraised right hand. He is flanked by a pair of winged anthro- pomorphic figures with headbands, each of which holds the bucket in his left hand and makes the ges- ture of blessing toward the king with his right. As when the king is paired with deities in room G, here too his pose and aspect are almost identical to theirs, a ruler divinely endowed in aspect as in power."' The images of the king on the long walls in the north half of the room face south, and those in the south half face north, that is, they all face toward the central doors, e and c. In this inner room, therefore, the emphasis in the reliefs is entirely on libations, and these offerings are now made before divine or semidivine figures. The emphasis on the king as a priest acting on behalf of humans, as shown in room G, is replaced here by images that appar- ently show divine sanction for his offerings. Room N seems to function architecturally both as a niche at the south end of room G and as a passageway to room O and corridor P.

The relief slabs to either side of the door to room O are carved with blessing figures facing away from the door, as if to welcome or bless visitors approaching from either direction. The opposite wall, by contrast, is carved with alternating images of the stylized palm and winged figures with the purifier and bucket. Again, the winged figures appear to be tending the tree, but it seems much more likely that they are shown alternately facing left and right so that their protective power may be most effectively distributed in both directions along the wall. The stylized trees presumably direct their protective power outward into the room. They also mask the joints between slabs, and perhaps help to insure that nothing un- welcome will slip into the room through these cracks. The effect of the west wall of room N, therefore, is of a space charged with protective power in every direction: left, right, in front, and behind. That said, it is undeniable that the pair of winged figures with purifier and bucket flanking the stylized tree forms a distinct compositional group, and we may wonder if this arrangement of figures and tree was viewed as a distinct motif with a meaning be- yond, or in addition to, the purely apotropaic. Both the stylized tree and winged figures have a long tra- dition in ancient Near Eastern representation. Al- though the distinctive combination that interests us here-- Porter's "tree scene"- apparently first appeared in Assurnasirpal's palace, it is likely that previous representational conventions influenced the com- position of Assurnasirpal's images, while at the same time serving as a set of tradition-based expectations with which to view and interpret, perhaps errone- ously, these new images. Indeed, examination of ear- lier representations suggests that Mitannian and Mid- dle Assyrian conventions served as the source for the elements and composition of Assurnasirpal's apotropaic images, but not for their meaning. Stylized trees are a common motif on Syrian cyl- inder seals as early as the 18th century B.C., as well as on Kassite, Mitannian, Middle Assyrian, and Cyp- riot cylinder seals of the second half of the second millennium.3" When the tree is flanked by figures, these are usually animals, heroes, or a king facing a god. Mitannian seals that probably date to the 14th century occasionally show a wingless human or bird- headed man holding a palm frond and bucket near a Mitannian stylized tree or standard, which is very unlike the Assyrian stylized palm (fig. 19a).114 In this context, the palm frond presumably serves as a sprinkler, perhaps an earlier form of the purifier. This type of figure does not seem to occur in Assyr- ian representations, however, until the palace of As- surnasirpal II. Other Mitannian sealings show a pair of winged humans or bird-men kneeling and touch- ing a standard surmounted by a winged disk, in a composition that is very similar to the upper register of the reliefs in Assurnasirpal's room I, where, how- ever, the kneeling figures touch a stylized palm tree (fig. 19b).'15 Already in the 14th century, therefore, the compositional type of a pair of winged figures flanking an emblem was well established in north- ern Mesopotamia. Middle Assyrian seals of the 14th century show heavy Mitannian influence, a reflection of increas- ing Assyrian dominance in a previously Mitannian region. Ancient seal impressions (sealings) on tablets from Assur, probably from the time of Eriba-Adad I and Assur-uballit I, show the earliest Assyrian ex- amples of a pair of bird-headed men, usually winged but in one case wingless, flanking a stylized tree (fig. 19c). The figures hold no attributes, and either make the blessing gesture or touch the tree with one hand. The tree itself is still Mitannian in appearance and the compositions all include other figures that do not interact with the tree. In another sealing from Assur of this period, however, the tree is represented in a way that anticipates the Assurnasirpal examples, with a central trunk surrounded by flowers on ten- drils, but it is flanked by a gazelle, who nibbles at it, and a fox (fig. 19d).116 The same motifs continue in Assyrian seals and wall painting from the time of Tukulti-Ninurta I in the 13th century. An ancient sealing from Assur shows a pair of winged bird-men, apparently empty-handed and with one arm lowered and the other raised, flanking a naturalistic palm tree (fig. 19e). Two other Assur sealings of the same date again anticipate the 3" Collon (supra n. 83) 54-74. For a general survey, see H.

These figures do not seem to hold the purifier and bucket, however, and this together with their very small scale and juxtaposition with other motifs familiar from the seals (kneeling and rearing ani- mals) suggests that they may not play the same sort of crucial apotropaic role here as do their large-scale counterparts in the Neo-Assyrian palaces. The larger- scale motifs in these wall paintings are mostly floral, including rosettes, lotus blossoms, and a stylized palm tree consisting of a central trunk surrounded by palmettes connected by tendrils, again anticipating the form of Assurnasirpal's tree.""

Similar forms and compositions were found on seals from Assur from the 12th century, mainly from the time of Tiglath-pileser I. One ancient sealing shows a pair of winged bird-men with one empty hand raised and the other lowered (fig. 19g). Behind them is some tendrilly object, perhaps a floral mo- tif. They presumably both face a central object, prob- ably a tree, but the seal was rolled so that the central element was omitted and the two figures face out- ward back to back. The figures are complete, giving the impression that the sealing was rolled this way deliberately; perhaps it was felt that the figures would provide more protection for the tablet if they faced outward rather than inward. Two other sealings of this time from Assur show a pair of figures flanking a tree. Only one figure of each pair is a winged bird- man, while the others are a griffin and a man. One of these seals was rolled in the manner of the pre- vious one, with the figures facing outward and the tree omitted. On the other one, and on another ex- ample of the same date (fig. 19h), the form of the tree prefigures that of Assurnasirpal II, though it is not clear if the tree is actually a palm."19 In the late Middle Assyrian period, therefore, prior to the historical lacunae of the 11th and 10th cen- turies, the form of the stylized tree and the motif of bird-headed men flanking a tree were well estab- lished in Assyrian glyptic and painting. There is no evidence for the meaning of such a composition in the Middle Assyrian period, however, and the preva- lence of numerous other types of mythic, human, and animal figures in tree scenes suggests that the image of the tree flanked by two bird-men was no more desirable than any of the other possible com- binations. Certainly, there is nothing in the Middle Assyrian examples to suggest the prominence that this particular combination of figures attained in Assurnasirpal's palace. Nor is the figure with purifier and bucket known to occur in northern Mesopota- mian representations prior to Assurnasirpal, apart from the Mitannian examples of uncertain rele- vance.120 In Middle Assyrian imagery, the figures that flank the tree interact with it either by touching it or by raising one arm in front of it in a gesture similar to the blessing gesture of doorway figures in Assurnasirpal's palace. On the one hand, then, there is a clear Middle Assyrian visual tradition for figures flanking a tree, and on the other, in the palaces of Shalmaneser III, Tiglath-pileser III, and Sargon II, the tree almost al- ways stands on its own. In between is the palace of Assurnasirpal II, in which trees and figures with a purifier and bucket may be either grouped together or stand alone, and where there seems to be no evi- dence for an iconographic relationship between winged figures and trees. The image of two figures flanking the stylized tree occurs frequently as part of a continuous frieze of such figures, but only rarely as a discrete, self-contained composition, as they do beneath the air shafts in room H. The motif does occur frequently, however, in the small-scale images engraved on the garments in Assurnasirpal's wall reliefs, evidently representing embroidery or incised metal appliques. Here we find a stylized tree flanked by images of the king, by hu- man and bird-headed figures with the purifier and bucket, as well as by a variety of other mythical and animal types. But although the imagery of the garment decorations includes a number of motifs and subjects seen also in the large-scale reliefs, it nevertheless appears to belong to a different dec- orative system. In the tree represented in the gar- ment decorations, for example, the outer border of palmettes is always replaced with a border of pine- cones, as in the garment decorations on the stele of the earlier Babylonian king Marduk-nadin-ahhe (1099-1082 B.C.).'2' Similarly, the range of mythical and animal figures and the variety of poses shown in the garment decorations are much greater than those of the large-scale reliefs, recalling the variety of inter- actions and figures seen in Middle Assyrian glyptic.

Jahrhunderts," ZA 48 (1944) figs. 29-31. 120 Also of uncertain relevance is an ancient cylinder seal impression from Hasanlu that shows a pair of winged bird-legged scorpion-tailed anthropomorphic deities hold- ing a round object and bucket, flanking a naturalistic tree on a mountain with a winged disk above: M.I.

Commentary and Catalog (University Museum Mono- graphs 84, Hasanlu Special Studies III, Philadelphia 1996) 55-56, no. 81. Because the seal combines Middle Assyrian and Neo-Assyrian features, Marcus dates it to the stylis- tically undocumented transitional period of the 11th- 10th centuries. The closest parallel for the figures is a garment decoration on the reliefs ofAssurnasirpal II (Layard [supra n. 70] pl. 44.2), however, so in the absence of dated com- paranda from the preceding period, it seems safer to place it provisionally in the ninth century, and to ascribe the earlier features to archaizing or experimentation. 121 Strommenger (supra n. 72) pl. 271.</page><page sequence="42">696 JOHN MALCOLM RUSSELL [AJA 102 What we seem to have in the Assurnasirpal gar- ment decorations is an existing system of decorative forms, into which has been integrated a new group of stock images taken directly from the large-scale relief images on which the small-scale ones are en- graved. This process of integration apparently did not involve merely the appropriation of new motifs, but rather the synthesis of new motifs with existing forms and conventions. An example is the image of the king shown twice flanking the tree, with the winged disk above, which was incised on the tunic of the seated king on slab 3 in room G. While it is possible that this composition was copied from ac- tual garments, and therefore records a potential lost source for the large-scale reliefs, it seems more likely that the small-scale image is based on the central part of the similar large-scale scene carved on slabs 13 and 23 in the throne room, B. In the version on the garment, the overall composition, as well as the pose and dress of the king, is drawn from the large- scale prototype, but the tree is surrounded by pine- cones, the winged disk lacks the human figure in its center, and the group stands on a pattern that evidently represents a mountainous landscape, fea- tures that are all foreign to the large-scale images. In the garment decorations, therefore, groups in- cluding the king, winged deities, and the tree were evidently lifted from the large-scale reliefs and in- tegrated into a world that, as Stearns observed, is "radically different from that in which the reliefs exist"- a world where winged figures not only stand or kneel stiffly to either side of the tree, but also dem- onstrate their powers by actively subduing wild myth- ical creatures, while neighboring scenes show the king similarly engaged hunting wild beasts.'22 This difference from the large-scale reliefs may be because Assurnasirpal's garment decorations actually looked this way, but this is unverifiable. Or the garment dec- orations may have been carved by artists drawing on several different traditions of small-scale engrav- ing, including the Middle Assyrian glyptic tradition and foreign traditions such as engraved works from contemporary northwest Iran and ivory carving from Late Bronze Age Phoenicia.'12 Whatever the explanation, in the garment deco- rations, the stylized tree flanked by winged figures with the purifier and bucket so closely fits the exist- ing Middle Assyrian template of two figures flanking a tree that the group apparently became just another stock motif, with the result that the original mean- ing of these figures as powerful independent apo- tropaic entities was subordinated to an older Middle Assyrian compositional ideal of an eternal struggle between monsters and deities in a mythic realm. In the large-scale reliefs, by contrast, the relationship between the stylized tree and winged figures with purifier and bucket is apparently a purely formal arrangement that, like the garment decorations, may have been heavily influenced by Middle Assyrian compositional formulas. Inner Rooms The two inner rooms of the east suite, I and L, are similarly decorated and, presumably, similarly charged with protective power. Every slab except one in each of these rooms is decorated with the stylized tree alternating with winged figures. Whether these rooms served for ablutions or offerings or both, their occupants would have been mightily protected against evil and impurity. In room L, the winged figures are anthropomorphic and all but one carry the purifier and bucket. As already noted, the atyp- ical figure was depicted on slab 20, in the niche be- side the drain: a beardless human, possibly female, with four wings, wearing a flounced garment, the horned crown of divinity, a pectoral composed of disks decorated with stars and rosettes, a string of beads in the lowered left hand, and the right hand held up in the gesture of greeting or bless- ing.124 Elsewhere in the palace, the flounced gar- ment occurs only in room I, on a pair of beardless figures similar to these, and on kneeling deities who touch the stylized tree. Meuszynski observed that a similar garment was depicted on divine figures in Assurnasirpal's Ninurta temple and his Central Build- ing at Nimrud, and suggested that it characterized temple or cult locations.125 Rosettes, stars, and a string of beads all can be attributes of Ishtar, and as I have already suggested, the four wings may de- note an especially powerful figure. This may, there- fore, be an image of Ishtar, in which case, the niche and drain could be for cult offerings. Ishtar's most distinctive attributes, weapons and a lion, are absent from this image, however, so this is more likely to 122 Stearns (supra n. 3) 69. 123 For parallels with Iran, see Canby (supra n. 71).

The reliefs in room I are also devoted wholly to apotropaic imagery, but with several differences. As already noted, the reliefs in this room are divided into two registers. The stylized palm alternates with the bird-headed apkallu with purifier and bucket in the lower register, and with kneeling anthropomor- phic deities wearing the flounced garment in the upper. In the upper register, however, only those figures who flank doorways hold the purifier and bucket. The remaining anthropomorphic figures touch or hold the tree itself with both hands. These figures do, therefore, appear to be interacting directly with the tree in some fashion - their kneeling pose and special dress suggest that they may be engaged in a ritual that utilizes the power of the palm. Per- haps the palm is their attribute, as it is for some of the apotropaic figures described in the ritual texts, and the kneeling figures effect the release of its pro- tective power.126 If so, then the palm held in the hands of the upper figures might be the equivalent of the purifier and bucket held by the figures directly below, in both cases dispensing apotropaic power throughout the room. Slab 16, in the niche beside the presumed drain in room I, is decorated with the usual kneeling figures touching the stylized tree in the upper register, and with a pair of female deities- identical to the one in room L, but with two wings instead of four- flanking a stylized tree in the lower register.'27 The doubling of this figure here and the placement of the tree in the center suggest that these are not cult images of Ishtar herself, but rather female apotro- paic deities charged with guarding the drain and protecting those who use it. Overall, the theme of the relief decoration in the east suite seems to be divine legitimation of Assur- nasirpal's royal authority. In the outer room, G, the king is shown making offerings to the gods and re- ceiving divine purification of his person and his weapons. In the middle room, H, the two previous subjects are conflated, as the offerings of the king are rewarded with divine blessing. The inner rooms, I and L, are entirely lined with apotropaic figures, which insure that the occupants and activities therein will be immune from evil influences. This would be a very secure location, for example, for rituals such as those depicted in the two outer rooms. It would also be an ideal venue for bathing, ritual or other- wise, during which time the king, possibly weapon- less and disrobed, would be particularly vulnerable to both demonic and physical threats. Turner sug- gested that such a room may have been associated with the bathing rituals described in a series of texts concerning the bit rimki, a house for ritual purifica- tion through bathing. Although a true bit rimki should be outdoors away from the city, so that any demons washed away will be unable to find refuge indoors in the palace, the texts also describe ablutions that take place in the palace, and rooms I and L seem well fitted for this purpose."28 If this is indeed the case, then both the architecture and sculpture in these rooms provide redundant cues to function. In sum, then, the architectural and sculptural fixed features of the entire east wing seem to be cues for an overall function of purification, both of the implements of royal power and of the person of the king himself. Perhaps it is not too farfetched to imagine the king and members of his court making a ceremonial procession through this wing, begin- ning in room G with relatively public offerings to the gods and the presentation of his arms in the presence of his courtiers, proceeding with a selected company into room H for the blessing of his weap- ons, and culminating with the purification of his person in rooms I and L, attended by only his most trusted retainers. SOUTH SUITE The south suite has the smallest rooms of the four suites grouped around court Y (figs. 2, 4, and 20). Its plan is also simpler than those of the west and east suites, and is comparable to that of the throne- room suite, though on a much smaller scale: a large outer room (S) opening from court Y, with an alcove (T) at its west end, and a large inner room (X), with a pair of small rooms also at its west end, V and W, the latter a paved room with niche and drain. Turner has shown that this plan, which consists of a large outer "reception room," a smaller inner "retiring room," and small subsidiary chambers, is the most frequently occurring type of suite in Assyrian palaces.'29 This plan should therefore exemplify the standard Assyrian residential suite, and more com- plex suites presumably represent modifications of the standard plan for specialized functions.

Sobolewski) identified the south suite as the king's "residential suite," though without enumerating his reasons, and I believe that the architectural and decorative cues support this identification.'13 As with the east suite, the finds excavated in the south suite provide no assistance in identifying its function. In this area Layard reported "copper vessels of peculiar shape," all of which disintegrated during excavation. He also found a considerable number of carved ivories near door a in room V, and Mal- lowan found further examples, apparently at the west end of room X.'31 The ivories presumably originally served as decoration on pieces of furniture, but they cannot be dated with certainty. Even if some of them date to the ninth century, this would not tell us when the furniture they adorned was placed in these rooms. The doorjambs of room U in this same area carry inscriptions of Sargon II, which report that he restored this room or suite of rooms and used it as a storehouse for booty from Carchemish.'32 Therefore, it seems probable that, as with the east suite, the finds in these rooms date to the time of Sargon or later. Architecturally, the south suite displays several suggestive features. As with the throne room (B), the principal outside entrances to room S face north, so that in the summer it would have been cooler than the large reception rooms in the east and west suites. It is the innermost of the decorated reception suites, furthest from the throne room and outer courtyard. Unlike rooms G and WG, each of which is directly accessible from room F via a single door- way, room S is separated from the other decorated suites by corridor Z. The only inside access to the south suite is from room WG, probably the second- ary throne room, by crossing corridor Z via doors a and b. This suite is therefore isolated from, rather than connected with, the remaining reception suites. This is also the only suite with direct access to the private wing of the palace, through door b into court AJ (fig. 2). The function of these small undecorated inner rooms is unknown, but this would be a good location for the palace domestic services, as suggested by the presence of wells. In addition, vaulted tombs, at least two of which contained rich grave goods, were found beneath the floors of several rooms in the area directly south of room X. According to the inscrip- tions found in the tombs in rooms 60 and 61, one of them belonged to a queen of Assurnasirpal, and the other to queens of Tiglath-pileser III, Shalma- neser V, and Sargon II.133 At Assur, Neo-Assyrian kings were buried in tombs adjacent to the residen- tial suites, so it may well be that the area around the tombs in the palace at Nimrud was the residence of Assurnasirpal's queen and palace women.134 All of this architectural evidence suggests that the south suite was the most private and comfortable of the decorated suites, and it is tempting to spec- ulate that this was the king's private suite, which would also be consistent with its direct access to the pro- posed women's quarters. In keeping with Rapoport's observation on the redundancy of cues, this hypothe- 130 Reade (supra n. 42) 84.

The only image of the king in the entire suite is on the east wall of room S, in the same location as the enthroned king in room G (figs. 13, 22). The composition is less com- plex in room S, however, consisting of the king stand- ing in the center of the wall, a staff in his right hand and his sword hilt in his left, flanked by two courtiers, each holding a bow, quiver, and mace. The group is framed by a pair of stylized palm trees, placed not in the corners, as would be expected, but directly behind the courtiers, as close as possible to the figures whom their apotropaic powers protect. As in room G, the placement of the image of the king in this particular location on the reliefs strongly suggests that this is the spot the king himself would have oc- cupied when he was in this room. The two outside doorways, a and b, would have ensured a good source of natural light for this end of the room, highlight- ing the king's person, while much of the rest of the room would have been in comparative shadow. The remainder of the reliefs in room S, as well as those in the adjoining alcove T, show only apo- tropaic subjects. On the walls, the stylized palm tree alternates with the winged deity with purifier and bucket. The same subjects are depicted even on slabs 7 and 8 in room T, which are visible from room S and which, by analogy with room N in the east suite and room C in the throne-room suite, might be ex- pected to show royal subjects (figs. 21, 23). This over- whelming emphasis on the apotropaic, as in rooms I and L, suggests that this was meant to be a very secure room. The doorways receive a different treatment, but again the emphasis is on the apotropaic, as is true for all of the palace doorways. The main entrance to room S, door e, is guarded by human-headed bull colossi in thejambs, and small figures of a deity with purifier and bucket and a blessing figure with plant, placed vertically above one another on the slabs to either side of the door inside the room. Each jamb of door a, which also opens from courtyard Y, is carved with a large-scale pair of the same figures, with the deity with purifier and bucket facing out- ward and the blessing figure facing inward, as in door c to room G. The reliefs in the other outer door, b, which con- nects with the back part of the palace, are somewhat surprising, as there are no figures with purifiers at this door, but rather four blessing figures with plants in their left hands. Interestingly, the pair of these figures on the doorjambs here face into room S, not outward into AJ, so that only the figures on the inte- rior slabs that flank the door confront any threat from outside. If I am correct in attributing less apo- tropaic power to this type of figure than to those with the purifier and bucket, then this doorway was not considered as vulnerable to unwanted intruders as were the other outer doors in this suite. Door c, by contrast, the only entrance to the large inner room, X, is protected both by blessing figures and by bird-headed figures with the purifier and bucket. The selection of bird-headed figures here instead of the anthropomorphic figures that line the remainder of the walls in room S, suggests that there may be some qualitative or quantitative difference in the type or amount of apotropaic power that these two figure types afford. There is some slight evidence in the miniature representations of the garment dec- orations on the palace reliefs that the bird-headed figure is more aggressive than the anthropomorphic one.'35 If this is true for the large-scale reliefs as well, then the door to room X may have been thought to need a measure of extra protection. The other interior doorway, d, which connects rooms S and T, is flanked by a pair of winged deities with purifier and bucket on the walls in both S and T, while each jamb is carved with a winged anthro- pomorphic figure facing into room S, with a mace in his lowered left hand and a stalk of pomegran- ates (?) in his raised right. As with all of the other objects carried by such figures, the pomegranate, which this form most likely represents, is attributed apotropaic power in exorcism texts.136 Finally, door a, through which one enters the suite from corridor Z, is carved with a pair of unusual figures, as well as some familiar ones (fig. 24). On the wall of corridor Z to either side of this door are two pairs of small figures: a deity with purifier and bucket and a blessing figure with plant, arranged vertically one above the other as in door e of room S. Large-scale figures with the purifier and bucket are also placed on the walls of room T facing the ' A point made by Fulghum (supra n. 51); for exam- ples, see Canby (supra n. 71) 37; and Layard (supra n. 70) pls. 45.1, 48.3, and 49.4. 1:6 Parker Mallowan 1983 (supra n. 105) 38; CAD, N/2 (1980) 346, s.v. nurmui, 2b.

The unusual figures here are on the doorjambs, each of which is carved with a single anthropomor- phic winged figure with a headband, facing outward toward the corridor.'37 Unlike the other pairs of apotropaic figures in the palace, for whom one type of attribute is held consistently in the right hand and another type consistently in the left, this figure holds his attributes in different hands, depending on which side of the door he is on. With the near hand he holds a small goat against his side, and in the upraised far hand he holds what appears to be a palm frond. Following Barnett, Parker Mallowan identified the goat here as a maghultuppui, or scapegoat, used in As- syrian rituals to avert evil, presumably by serving as a host for wandering demons that might other- wise possess the human inhabitants of the palace.'38 The deer in the arms of the figures in the compara- ble location beside throne-room door a probably served a similar purpose, though there is no known textual reference to deer in this role.'39 Mallowan found the skeleton of a similar small quadruped, tentatively identified as a gazelle, under the pave- ment of the floor in corridor P; this animal may also have served as a scapegoat.140 The plant in the up- raised hand of these figures has generally been iden- tified as an ear of grain ever since Layard's initial description of the slabs, but Parker Mallowan iden- tified it instead as a palm frond, and this would be much more consistent with this figure's apparent apotropaic function.141 Indeed, the comparable figures beside throne-room door a carry stalks of palmettes, which I have already suggested are stylized representations of palm offshoots. Both offshoots and fronds of the palm possess great apotropaic power, while there is no evidence that this is the case for an ear of grain. The goat-bearing figures that stand facing outward in this entrance to the south suite, therefore, are almost certainly apotropaic in function, and their occurrence elsewhere only in an entrance to the throne room suggests that they may be a particularly powerful type. The walls of room X were paneled with unsculp- tured stone slabs, each of which was carved with the Standard Inscription, as were the walls of rooms V and W (fig. 25). Room X was by far the largest room in the palace to be treated this way, and the absence of sculptures here seems particularly surprising since it is clearly one of the two major rooms in the south suite. Furthermore, the absence even of apotropaic imagery seems surprising in view of the overwhelm- ing apotropaic emphasis in the adjacent room S. It may be that room X was not considered to be par- ticularly vulnerable to evil infiltration, as its only outside entrance was from the well-protected room S, but there would still be the potential for super- 37 Budge (supra n. 56) pl. 27. 138 R.D.

Alternatively, it may be that in this rel- atively safe interior location, the gods invoked by name in every copy of the Standard Inscription- Assur, Enlil, Ninurta, Anu, Dagan, Shamash, and Adad -would have provided sufficient protection. Or possibly room X was originally decorated with painted images on the slabs, on the wall above, or both, or perhaps its walls were covered with hangings that could also have carried images.'42 However that may be, it appears that room X was considered to be a private room with only limited access, as it lacks the relief sculptures that are one of the hallmarks of conspicuous consumption in the other large rooms. All of the features enumerated above seem to sup- port Reade's identification of the south suite as Assurnasirpal's private residential suite. The overall emphasis on apotropaic imagery in rooms S and T and the particularly potent protective figures in the outer doors are readily understandable if this suite was the location in which the king conducted his private affairs: receiving high court officials, enter- taining palace women, eating, bathing, and, espe- cially, sleeping. While the king was engaged in these pursuits, the protective images carved all around the walls of the outer rooms would have provided a mea- sure of magical protection, and at the same time would have reminded those closest to the king (and therefore potentially the most dangerous to him) that the king rules by the will of the gods and enjoys their protection. The absence of sculptures in room X becomes less anomalous if that room was in fact the king's private retiring room, as it would then presumably have been inaccessible to all but his most trusted servants. A message of conspicuous consumption in that con- text would have been largely wasted, and magical protection could have been afforded through less costly means. In this respect, room X is like the other small interior rooms in the palace--A, J, K, M, O, R, U, V, and W- all of which were lined with slabs carved only with the Standard Inscription, which may have been felt to provide adequate magical pro- tection. Whatever else the function of carved figures may have been, they seem to have been considered necessary only where there was the potential for a more general human audience, emphasizing fore- most their role as emblems of consumption. Thus by focusing attention on the audience, Trigger's ob- servations on the role of conspicuous consumption in monumental architecture help to account not only for the presence but also for the absence of sculp- tural decoration - rooms with limited access are un- sculptured because conspicuous consumption is wasted if it is not conspicuous. THRONE-ROOM SUITE In the three suites that face court Y the decora- tion seems to emphasize three different aspects of Assurnasirpal's rule: military success in the west suite, service to the gods in the east suite, and divine pro- tection of the king in the south suite. In the relief decoration of the throne-room suite, all three of these themes were brought together. The suite comprises three rooms (fig. 26). The throne room itself, room B, which is by far the largest enclosed space in the palace, opens via three monumental entrances onto the great outer court, ED. At the west end of the throne room is an alcove, room C, which gives ac- cess through door b to a ramp or stairway to the roof. The third room, F, is the inner "retiring room," and connects the throne room with the east and west suites and the central court. Unlike the other rooms in the palace, there is no uncertainty about the func- tion of room B. Its identification as the principal throne room is confirmed by its size, by its location between the outer and inner courtyards, by its sim- ilarity in plan to the throne rooms of later Assyrian palaces, and by the presence of a large inscribed throne base at its east end."43 As the principal audience hall of the king and the room through which access was gained to the inte- rior of the palace, the doors of room B were very well guarded by apotropaic figures (pl. II). Of the three outer doors, door c, directly beside the throne base, was protected by a pair of winged lion-centaurs with folded hands, which form the doorjambs, and by a pair of four-winged deities, making the gesture of blessing with their right hands and holding maces in their left hands, on the wall just inside the door (pls. III-IV). Door d, at the far end of the room, was again protected by a pair of winged lion-centaurs as doorjambs, but each of these figures holds a small hoofed quadruped clasped to his chest with his left hand, and a stalk with three tufted rosettes in his 142 Although no paintings have been reported in room X, extensive remains of wall paintings were found on the floor of the neighboring room S during the Iraqi resto- ration work in the room.

On the wall just inside the door was a pair of winged figures with headbands, each of whom holds a deer to his chest with the near hand and a stalk of palmettes in his upraised far hand. The fact that the three-dimensional doorjamb figures both hold the animal in the left hand suggests that their two-dimensional counterparts just inside this door, and in door a of room T, hold the animal in different arms on either side of the door only be- cause of the compositional difficulty of satisfactorily representing an animal in the left arm of a two- dimensional figure shown from the right. The inside jamb slabs in doors c and d were all carved with the Standard Inscription. Since these slabs would have been obscured when the double doors were open, it may have been thought unnecessary to decorate these inconspicuous slabs with sculptures. Doors c and d were each also protected by an ad- ditional pair of figures on the adjacent buttress: a human-headed winged bull with fish-head crown fac- ing toward the door on the front of the buttress, and a four-winged deity with purifier and bucket facing outward on the side of the buttress. Except for the foot of a lion colossus, the center sculptures on the buttresses and those in door e are lost. Inspired by the pairing of bull with lion colossi on Assurna- sirpal's temple facade in the center of the Nimrud citadel, Paley and Sobolewski have proposed a very plausible reconstruction starting from the lion frag- ment, from which they deduced a pair of human- headed lion colossi facing the central door on the front of the buttresses. The four-winged figure carry- ing a kid and stalk of tufted rosettes, which they re- store between each pair of facade colossi, is hypo- thetical but was actually found in this location on Assurnasirpal's central building facade, so the pres- ence of some such figure here seems very likely.144 The second pair of four-winged deities with purifier and bucket on the door e sides of the facade but- tresses seems self-evident, as does the pair of human- headed bull or lion colossi in the door itself.145 The three stacked figures, consisting of bird-headed figure with purifier and bucket, blessing figure with sprig, and deity with purifier and bucket, were taken di- rectly from the main entrance to Assurnasirpal's Ni- nurta temple at Nimrud, where they occupied this same position. Whatever the details of the center door, it is clear that all three outer doors of the throne room were amply provided with apotropaic figures. The differ- ent selection of figures in the east and west doors is interesting. Perhaps it is not too farfetched to spec- ulate that the emphasis of the figures in the east door is to guard the door by fending off evil, while the emphasis of those in the west door is to intercept and disable it. In the east door, the lion colossi and the four-winged deities both convey an impression of vigilance. Indeed, the pains that the designer took to fit four-winged deities on the relatively narrow slabs 26 and 26a, where two-winged figures would 144 Barnett and Falkner (supra n. 60) pls. 126-27; Meus- zynski (supra n. 60). 145 A slightly different reconstruction was proposed by Albenda, who suggested switching the positions of the lost bull and lion colossi, with bulls only on the buttresses and lions only in the doors: P.

This door is much more likely to have provided illumination on the king rather than physical access to his person, and to have served as an exit for those who had concluded their audience with the king. The apotropaic figures in the west door, by contrast, all hold scapegoats, which would have served to intercept evil forces as they passed through a door that, by virtue of its dis- tance from the enthroned king, may well have been the customary entrance for visitors.147 The throne room is the only room in the palace in which colossal statues were placed in the interior doorways, a and b. Presumably these giant figures provided an additional measure of protection to the doors in which they were located, which would be appropriate given the relatively public nature and outer location of this room. They also draw atten- tion to the doors and look very impressive, which would likewise be appropriate for this vast and rela- tively public space, a perfect venue for conspicuous consumption. In addition to colossal human-headed lions in the jambs, door a to room C was flanked by bird-headed figures with the purifier and bucket on the outer wall and winged deities with purifier and bucket on the wall inside (pl. II, fig. 27). The placement of figures with purifiers both inside and outside this door, including the only pair of bird- headed figures in the throne room, suggests that this may have been reckoned a vulnerable entrance, per- haps because of the stairway to the roofjust beyond. The presence of a pair of winged blessing figures with buckets in door b of room C suggests that this was the door that led to the stairway. The stairs would have wrapped around the central pier until they reached roof level in the area of the adjacent door c, which presumably opened into a storage space under the stairs. Finally, door b, which connected the throne room with the "retiring room," F, also had bull colossi as doorjambs (pl. II, fig. 28). In addition, the slabs to either side of the door on the room B side were carved with a pair of winged figures with headbands, each of whom holds a bucket in his lowered left hand and a stalk of alternating tufted rosettes and pine- cones in his upraised right. This curious plant ap- parently combines the apotropaic powers of the ro- sette, often associated with Ishtar, and the pinecone, and the resulting hybrid may have been considered to possess particularly potent protective powers. The slabs to either side of door b on the room F side display bird-headed figures with the purifier and bucket, which is also the subject on most of the other reliefs in that room. The jamb slabs behind the co- lossi are again carved only with the Standard Inscrip- tion, which would have been partially obscured when the double doors were open. Of the other doors in room F, the blessing figures in door a, which leads to the east suite, have already been discussed, and whatever figures might have been in door c to the west suite are lost. The remaining door, f, opened from courtyard Y and was also lined with a pair of winged human-headed bull colossi, with bird-headed figures on the walls inside the door. The slabs to either side of the door in the courtyard were carved only with the Standard Inscription, as were all of the wall slabs in courtyard Y. For what- ever reason, the courtyard was apparently not an ap- propriate location for relief images of any sort. All of the corner slabs in the throne room and room C were carved with the stylized palm tree. In one case, the northwest corner of the throne room, a winged deity with purifier and bucket faces the tree; the remainder stand alone. In the two surviv- ing corners in room F, by contrast, the stylized tree is placed next to the corner, as in room I, but not centered on the corner itself. The reason for this variation from the apparent norm is not clear. Building on the observations of Reade, Winter ar- gued that the relief decoration on the walls of the throne room has two powerful visual foci.148 Slab 13, directly opposite the central entrance, and slab 23, directly behind the throne base, were both treated in a unique fashion. Each slab was twice the width of the standard wall slabs, and the upper two-thirds of each slab were cut back to form a shallow niche. 46 As suggested by Fulghum (supra n. 51). 147 This traffic pattern was first suggested by Mallowan (supra n. 42) 103, although his interpretation was based on the assumption that there were only two exterior doors, and was developed further by S.M.

The slab opposite the main door is framed by a pair of slabs, each carved to its full height with an image of the king holding a staff, behind whom is a courtier with bow, quiver, and fly whisk, all of whom face the image in the niche. The slab behind the throne base, by contrast, is framed by a pair of winged deities who probably held the purifier and bucket; their attri- butes were chiseled away during a subsequent re- modeling, but enough remains of the left figure to show that he did not carry a mace. For both of these distinctive slabs, the framing figures focus attention on the image in the niche.'49 The meaning of the images in the niches has been 149 Stearns (supra n. 3) pl. 23; S.M.

Winter considered it "a statement of the king's role in maintaining ritual fertility, and thus the balance of the state in relationship to divine principles2"'51 Porter linked the king with the standing deities, ob- serving that here it is "the gods who reach out to fertilize the tree, but the king is now represented as the link between them. The scene becomes a vi- sual metaphor for the king's role as the gods' regent on earth, the conduit through whose actions their gift of abundance could reach Assyria and her em- pire"151 Parpola instead linked the king with the god in the winged disk, arguing that "clearly, the Tree here represents the divine world order maintained by the king as the representative of the god Assur, embodied in the winged disk hovering over the Tree"152 Though these three interpretations differ significantly in detail, they all see the stylized tree as the key to the meaning of the composition. Based on the functional interpretations I have proposed for the stylized tree and winged deities with purifier and bucket, a very different interpretation of this scene may be offered. It would seem that the best place to start is with the architectural context of these two distinctive slabs. The only apparent reason for placing the niche above the floor at the east end of the room is to raise it above the throne base, which would otherwise block the lower part of the image. Similarly, the only ap- parent reason for cutting a niche in this location is to provide a clear architectural setting for the throne base. The same reasoning probably holds true as well for the similar niched slab opposite the cen- tral door. Though no throne base was found here, this is the traditional and logical location for the king to sit in order to observe, and be observed from, the outer courtyard. On such occasions, it seems probable that a portable throne dais was used. Fur- thermore, Winter has observed that when the king was enthroned on the permanent throne base at the east end of the room, the niche in slab 13 opposite the central door would serve to draw the visitor's attention to the nearly identical niche on the end wall, before which sat the king himself.'53 It also di- rects the movement of a visitor who enters the room through the central door, serving as a visual cue that defines the path to the king. What we must imagine, therefore, is a meaning for the image that comple- ments the actual person of the king seated in front of it. If we suppose that the function of the tree and standing deities here is the same as has been pro- posed for these figures in other contexts in the pal- ace, i.e., purely apotropaic, then their sole function here too should be to safeguard the king, as repre- sented by his two images as well as by his actual per- son, seated directly in front of the tree. The tree and standing deities, then, are not themselves the focus of the scene, but rather protect its principal subject, the king. The primary meaning of the image is ex- pressed by the relationship depicted between the two figures of the king and the deity in the winged disk above. Indeed, what is shown here is a variation of the standard subject of Assurnasirpal's royal stelae, which depict the king paying homage to his gods. This is evident from the position of the king's clenched right hand, which is raised toward the god in the winged disk in a distinctive gesture in which the thumb is placed below the pointing forefinger, the same gesture that is used by the king in the pres- ence of his gods on the stelae.154 The god in the disk, most probably Assur or Sha- mash, extends a ring toward the king. The ring, else- where often shown with a rod reflecting its original form as a measuring rod and line, is a common at- tribute of godhood in Assyrian art. When offered to a king, it represents the bestowal of authority by the god. In the compositions in the throne room, the king is shown twice so that the person of the king does not obstruct the image of the king, de- picted in the act of receiving the authority that he exercises by dispensing decisions from his throne. As in rooms G and H, the face and figure of the images of the king here are virtually identical to those of the deities, physical proof of his divine favor, while in turn these two inward-facing royal likenesses fo- cus our gaze on the physical king in between, their perfect form ennobling and reinforcing the royal aspects of his person. While this is the central mes- sage of the scene in the niche, the presence of apo- 150 Winter (supra n. 5) 16. 151 Porter (supra n. 90) 138-39. 152 Parpola (supra n. 89) 167. 153 Winter (supra n. 5) 17. 154 Budge (supra n. 56) pl. 2. Strabo described a similar gesture on an Assyrian stele in Anatolia, which he iden- tified as the tomb of Sardanapallus: "a stone figure which represents the fingers of the right hand as snapping to- gether, and the following inscription in Assyrian letters: 'Sardanapallus, the son of Anacyndaraxes, built Anchial&amp; and Tarsus in one day. Eat, drink, be merry, because all things else are not worth this,' meaning the snapping of the fingers" (The Geography of Strabo 6, H.L.Jones ed. [Cam- bridge, Mass. 1924] 14.5.9, cited from hydra.perseus.tufts. edu).</page><page sequence="70">1998] THE PROGRAM OF THE PALACE OF ASSURNASIRPAL II 711 tropaic divinities and the tree affirm that the king enjoys divine protection, as well as divine authority, and at the same time, these apotropaic elements pu- rify the space in front of the slab that is occupied by the physical king himself. In essence, therefore, this composition combines the axially focused apotropaic group that is deployed in centralized locations such as air shafts with the imagery of the royal stelae, inserting figures of the pious king into the protected spaces between the winged deity and stylized palm tree, which simultane- ously extend their protection outward to encompass the throne itself. Brentjes has plausibly argued that the two kings on each of these slabs are Assurna- sirpal's predecessors, Tukulti-Ninurta II and Adad- nirari II, who also comprise the genealogy at the be- ginning of the Standard Inscription.'55 If so, then these royal forebears placed to either side of the throne emphasize Assurnasirpal's legitimacy through recognition of his royal lineage. The relief behind the throne, therefore, would be a visual equivalent to the introduction of the Standard Inscription, iden- tifying Assurnasirpal as chosen of the gods and the son of great kings, and like the Standard Inscription, conferring authority, legitimacy, and protection on the throne's occupant. The remainder of the preserved reliefs in the throne room depict scenes of battle and the hunt in two registers separated by the Standard Inscrip- tion. The two slabs closest to the throne base (19 and 20) are decorated with scenes of the royal hunt. Winter has suggested that this subject therefore had special significance for the king. This view receives support from the subjects of the garment decorations on the reliefs; the robes of the king as well as the figures that accompany him are often decorated with scenes of royal hunts, but never with battle scenes.'56 As already noted, in the garment decorations these hunt scenes appear together with images of deities and winged mythic figures subduing monsters and demons, and it may be that images of the hunt had a similar significance, as the king emulates the ac- tion of the deities by subduing the wild forces of nature in his realm. The other historical reliefs represent royal mili- tary campaigns. In the short span afforded by slabs 17-18, the sequence of a single battle is divided be- tween the upper and lower registers, with the assault above and the booty procession below. On the longer stretch of slabs 3-11, by contrast, each sequence is worked out fully in a single register, and several such sequences are depicted. One interesting feature of the location of the hunt and battle scenes is that each of the three outside doorways affords a view of a different subject: as already noted, the central door opens onto the scene of the king receiving divine recognition, the east door presents images of royal hunts, and the west door presents royal military campaigns.''57 This observation supports the idea that door d might have been the principal entrance for visitors, as this would have afforded the fullest view of the battle scenes, images that were probably intended to bolster the loyalty of both friend and potential foe. A considerable part of the north wall of the throne room was evidently paneled with his- torical reliefs also, as evidenced by the subjects of the surviving slabs 27-28 at the west end, but these reliefs are lost. The reliefs on the west wall of room C, a shallow alcove at the west end of the throne room, introduce a subject that is already familiar to us from the east suite: the standing king with bowl and bow, flanked by a pair of courtiers and a pair of winged figures with purifier and bucket.' 58Clearly visible from the throne room through the wide door a, this image is effectively part of the decorative scheme of the throne room. The subject of this relief is the same as those in room G, the king making offerings to the gods, but here he is accompanied by both human and divine attendants. As with the images opposite one another on the long axis of rooms G and N, the images at the east end of the throne room and the west end of room C complement one another. From the king's perspective on the throne, the im- age visible at the farthest end of the room depicts his service to the gods, while on the wall directly behind him, that service is rewarded with the divine gift of royal authority. From the perspective of any- one else in the room, these two images justify the king's presence on the throne in that room. The large- scale static representations of the king at the cen- ters of the south, east, and west walls also serve to 155 B. Brentjes, "Selbstverherrlichung oder Legitimitits- anspruch?

Russell, From Nineveh to New York: The Strange Story of the Assyrian Reliefs in the Metropolitan Museum and the Hidden Masterpiece at Canford School (London 1997).</page><page sequence="71">712 JOHN MALCOLM RUSSELL [AJA 102 fix his image in the eye of the viewer, allowing that image to be readily identified in the smaller-scale dynamic battle and hunting scenes. The reliefs on the side walls of room C depict the stylized tree and deities with purifier and bucket, as was the case also in the comparable rooms N and T. As each of these rooms contains a back door to the suite, they may have been thought to require spe- cial protection. Apotropaic figures are also the pri- mary relief subject in room F, the "retiring room" behind the throne room. The only nonapotropaic image in the preserved part of the room is the king himself, depicted standing between a pair of bird- headed figures with purifier and bucket at the east end of the room. His left hand rests on his sword hilt while his right hand is raised in the gesture of blessing that is elsewhere only used by the apotro- paic figures with headband.'59 I do not know if the king's image in this familiar location on an end wall marks a spot from which he presided over activities in the room, as seems to have been the case in the throne room and rooms G and S, or whether it in- stead or in addition marks the route he followed be- tween the throne room and room G. The remaining slabs in room F are carved exclu- sively with the stylized palm tree alternating with the bird-headed figure with purifier and bucket. As with rooms I, L, and S, this suggests an intent to create a very well protected space. I can suggest three rea- sons for the choice of apotropaic subjects for this room. First, the king might desire to have a secure retiring room close to the more vulnerable outer space of the throne room. Passing into this room after leaving the throne room might serve to purify the king of any unwanted pollution that he had accidentally picked up. Second, this room served as both the antechamber to the throne room and the gate chamber to the rest of the palace. Since one must pass through room F to reach any part of the palace interior, the apotropaic imagery on its walls would have served as a sort of filter, protect- ing the inside of the palace from undesirable intrud- ers, while at the same time protecting the inner door to the throne room from intrusions from the interior."16 Finally, of the three types of decorative subjects that were featured in the reception rooms of the inner suites in Assurnasirpal's palace, the reliefs in room F exemplify the apotropaic imagery that was the principal subject in the south suite. The other two primary subjects, of course, were historical nar- ratives and ritual offerings, featured respectively in the west and east suites, and also in rooms B and C of the throne-room suite. The decoration of the throne-room suite, therefore, expresses the same ide- ology of power, piety, and protection that was de- veloped individually in each of the three inner suites of rooms. To this mixture, the throne-room facade (D and E) adds the further ideal of prosperity, in the form of the peaceful delivery of tribute from subject peoples at the extremity of the empire. At the west- ern door, a procession of western tributaries bear- ing jewelry and monkeys approaches the image of the king from the right (fig. 29). Paley and Sobolew- ski have observed that these are powerful visual cues for the emissaries and tributaries who presumably actually congregated in the outer court while await- ing a royal audience; these reliefs simultaneously direct them toward the entrance door and illustrate correct deportment in the presence of the king.'6' At the eastern door, tribute processions approach from both sides, converging not on the image, but rather on the person of the king, enthroned just in- side. The message of these tribute processions in the outer court seems to be that the maintenance of or- der, as shown inside the throne room and in the inner suites of the palace, will assure prosperity in the form of the flow of wealth from the outer reaches of the empire into its capital. CONCLUSIONS At the beginning of this study I ventured two hy- potheses: first, that the relief decoration of Assur- nasirpal's palace expresses a fourfold Assyrian ideol- ogy comprising military success, service to the gods, divine protection, and Assyrian prosperity; and sec- ond, that the subject and placement of the decora- tion in each suite of rooms was influenced by the function of that suite. In order to test these hypoth- eses, I drew on two theoretical approaches to under- standing the meaning of architecture: Trigger's prin- ciple of monumental architecture as conspicuous consumption, and Rapoport's phenomenon of the redundancy of cues in the architecture of complex societies. My source material was the architecture and sculpture of the palace itself, as well as com- parative architectural, visual, and textual sources from the general Assyrian milieu. While I cannot claim to have proven these hypotheses - others look- ing at the same data have drawn, and will doubtless continue to draw, different conclusions-I believe 159 Budge (supra n. 56) pl. 46. 160 This excellent point was made by Fulghum (supra n. 51). 161 Paley and Sobolewski (supra n. 147) 334.</page><page sequence="72">1998] THE PROGRAM OF THE PALACE OF ASSURNASIRPAL II 713 0' 0 . , 0 0 0 00. ..00 0 0 ..1 H I Fig. 29.

On the basis of my analysis, I determined that the subjects of the reliefs may be identified with considerable confidence, that the architectural cues suggest a specific primary function for each suite of rooms and the relief subjects in those rooms re- inforce the likelihood of that function, and that relief carving served as an expression of conspicu- ous consumption by being carved in conspicuous locations. To conclude, let us take a quick tour through the palace, moving this time from outside to inside, view- ing it in light of the cues that have been considered in this study. For these purposes, it is useful to think of the palace in terms of outer and inner areas, with the throne room as the interface between the two. A visitor to the palace who had been ushered into the outer court, ED, would have stood before the mon- umental throne-room facade, the most public part of the state apartments and the most dramatic ex- ample of conspicuous consumption in the palace. Confronted by this concentration of colossal divin- ities and subservient tributaries, the visitor is invited to contemplate the resources at the disposal of the king and to conjure up mental images of comparable splendors hidden within. This highly conspicuous facade framed three en- trances, each of which offered a different visual ex- perience. The great central door was apparently flanked by every type of figure in the Assyrian apo- tropaic arsenal-bull and lion colossi, four-winged deities with the purifier and bucket, figures with a scapegoat and plant, and two-winged anthropomor- phic and bird-headed figures with purifier and bucket or plants. This formidable concentration of mon- umental figures framed an image of kings, deities, and a tree, enclosed within its own frame on the op- posite wall inside the room. This image was a virtual duplicate of the one behind the throne base, which suggests that on occasion the king could sit here as well, as was the case in the throne rooms of the ear- lier palace at Mari and the later palace at Babylon. I suspect that this door was not used as an entrance when the king was enthroned at the end of the room, but rather only when the king positioned himself opposite it. This might have happened on occasions when the king wished to receive visitors directly from the courtyard, or to review activities in the courtyard or be viewed from the courtyard. The reliefs flanking the west door, d, by contrast, present the spectacle of foreigners bringing tribute before the image of the king. The door itself is lined with colossi with scapegoats, beyond which is a vista of royal battles on the opposite wall inside. The se- quence of images here, therefore, moves from instruc- tion in proper behavior outside, to instruction in the perils of noncompliance inside, with cleansing apotropaic images in between. The apparent mes- sage of these reliefs, combined with the distance of this door from the throne base, would seem to make this an ideal entrance for outsiders seeking an audi- ence with the king. The reliefs flanking the east door, c, again depict tribute processions, but now converg- ing from both sides toward the door itself, just be- yond which sat the person of the king. It is difficult to imagine visitors approaching the king from his side - if this door was used at all when the king was present, it probably served as the exit for those who had finished their audience. The splendor exhibited by the throne-room facade is carried to the inside of the throne room as well,</page><page sequence="73">714 JOHN MALCOLM RUSSELL [AJA 102 the only room in the palace in which every door con- tains a pair of bull or lion-headed colossi. For vis- itors whose business carried them only as far as the throne room, presumably the great majority, the oc- currence of such figures in every door would have fostered the impression that every other doorway in the palace also contained such figures, another example of conspicuous consumption in a relatively public location serving to increase the imagined mag- nificence of the private areas. The opulence of the room is further enhanced by the wall reliefs, which include examples of nearly every relief subject in the remainder of the palace. A look around the throne room would have given a visitor a full sense of the range of subjects within. The throne room evidently represents both the innermost zone of the Assyrian empire- the place where Assyrian subjects come before the "king of the world"- and the outermost zone of the royal apart- ments. The king and court entered this room from within, the rest of the world from without. We do not know how large a public was granted admittance to the throne room, but on the evidence of the for- eigners depicted on the facade reliefs, it was very likely a larger and more diverse public than would usually have been admitted to the rooms beyond. The interior of the palace was accessible only through the "back" door of the throne room, door b, which led to room E While the triple portal of the facade invites admittance, the single back door bespeaks exclusion. To move beyond the throne room and gain access to the inner suites of the state apartments, one must pass through room F, the walls of which were lined entirely with apotropaic figures. This space served as the retiring room and antechamber of the throne room, and as the gate chamber to the inner court and east and west suites. Door f, the principal ex- terior door of this room, provided indirect access to the three inner reception suites via the inner courtyard, Y, from which one could approach the monumental exterior portals of the other three suites. The scale of the four monumental doorways in court Y suggests that they were intended as the primary entrances, but this may be misleading. Rather, as suggested also for the central door of the throne room, they may have been used mainly when the king sat opposite them. Room F also provided direct access to the east and west suites through two interior doors, a and c. These doors, however, have the appearance of small private entrances tucked away in a corner directly adjacent to the short wall where the king would have customarily been en- throned. Their scale and location suggest that these were the king's personal entrances to the east and west suites. Each of the three inner suites was decorated with a different subject, and each of them seems to have had a different function. The east suite was the one closest to the throne end of the throne room, roughly in the same position as the ablution room in the throne-room suites of later Assyrian palaces. The wall reliefs in the large outer and middle rooms of this suite show the king as a priest pouring libations and as a ruler having his weapons blessed. The presence of stone ablution slabs on the floor of the outer room, and stone and brick pavements in the inner rooms, suggests that this suite may have been used for li- bations, as shown in the images. In addition, the wall reliefs of the innermost rooms, I and L, depicted only apotropaic figures, suggesting that these paved rooms with niche, drain, and ample magical protec- tion may also have been used for ablutions, ritual or personal. The west suite, by contrast, has large outer rooms on both sides. Each of these rooms is fitted with at least three exterior doors and wall re- liefs that depict royal conquests and hunts. These features are also characteristic of the throne room, and it is likely that the west suite was likewise used for royal reception and perhaps also for banquet- ing. The south suite is isolated from the others. Un- like the other suites, which were decorated with wall reliefs throughout, only the outer room of the south suite had wall reliefs, and these showed only apo- tropaic figures. The emphasis on protection in the outer room, the lack of emphasis on conspicuous consumption in the inner rooms, and the direct access from this suite to the back part of the palace all suggest that this was the king's private residential suite, with access restricted only to the outer room. We now see that Assurnasirpal stood on the brink of the greatest empire the world had ever seen, but Assurnasirpal himself could see only the past, not the future. What he could see was how precarious Assyria's position had been during the previous two centuries, which had been characterized by Aramae- an incursions and Assyrian contractions and re- trenchments.'62 From Assurnasirpal's perspective, Assyria's claim to greatness may have been a given, but the implementation of that greatness lay solely 162 An observation made by Seth Richardson ("E.GAL Ashurnasirpal: Palace of the'fraidy-cat," unpublished sem- inar paper, Neo-Assyrian Seminar, Columbia University, fall 1996), a graduate student in the Middle East Languages program at Columbia University.</page><page sequence="74">1998] THE PROGRAM OF THE PALACE OF ASSURNASIRPAL II 715 in his hands. The relief program of Assurnasirpal's palace lays out a recipe for Assyrian security and prosperity, displaying each of the ingredients in the location where it would have the greatest effect on the groups who could assure his success. This pro- gram communicated with its audiences at two levels: the overt level of meaning expressed through relief images in architectural context, and the more covert message of conspicuous consumption embodied in the profusion of sculpture within a monumental architectural setting. The fact that relief sculptures were apparently confined to the most accessible rooms suggests that, whatever magical power the images may have been thought to possess, the choice to depict such images through the medium of sculp- ture in public rooms reflects an intention to influ- ence human, as well as divine and demonic, occu- pants of the palace.
