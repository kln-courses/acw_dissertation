Some of these claims Professor Hill regards as legal and to them he devotes one chapter only, but a somewhat long one (pp. 143-164). The rest are non-legal, "strategic, geographic, historic, economic, ethnic and miscellaneous" and the discussion of these constitutes the body of the book. He gives abundant illustrations, in most instances from well-known terri- torial disputes in relatively recent times, and analyzes them in terms of the classification he adopts. As he fully admits, the classification cannot be precise since in most instances different types of claims are made simultaneously and are, as often as not, mere assertions, supported, if at all, by evidence which will not bear too close a scrutiny. We may take it to be the rule that the reasons advanced are not the real reasons and that the real reason is the international version of what among individuals is the unpleasant vice of avarice, properly listed as mortal sin in Catholic theology. This may be said to be the psychological background of territorial claims, and it involves no anthropomorphism of the nation itself. Nations are per- sons only by metaphor, but nations are composed of real persons who are living human beings and have the impulses of ordinary men. They are prone enough to find a vicarious expansion of their personality in being members of a powerful community, and from time immemorial power in a commu- nity has been measured by the territory controlled, whether that control is direct government or a recognized supremacy. Social tradition and educa- tion impress on people the pride of their imperial position as a nation. Little boys in Holland spoke with exalted fervor of the great Asiatic territories which "we Dutch" had acquired, and British children babbled of their "far-flung" dominions on which the sun never sets, innocent of the fact that they were quoting a boastful Spanish king when they used this stimulating phrase. Professor Hill in his introductory chapters does not do this factor jus- tice. Nor does he give an adequate presentation of the historic growth of the desire for territorial expansions. Indeed, he accepts uncritically what are little more than historical platitudes such as one statement (p. 144) that Egbert of Wessex "brought the several kingdoms of the island of Britain under the single government of England," or when he refers to the famous papal division of the New World between Spain and Portugal. This was not based on any "general authority over things temporal" (p. 145) but on the Pope's feudal position as lord paramount over the "islands of the sea." In 1493 when the line was drawn by Alexander VI and in 1494, when with- out any disregard of the grant, the line was moved two hundred and seventy leagues west, the newly discovered lands were all islands, and even the lands reached by Columbus in 1498 were assumed to be islands. (Cf. the statement of Pope Urban (1091) Migne, Patrologia Latina, vol. 151, pp. 350-351). It may be further noted that the Spanish Kings in their official cedulas</page><page sequence="3">466 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 33 rarely used the Bull Inter Caetera as the foundation of their authority. They preferred to put it on the basis of conquest which from the earliest days has given an apparently indisputable title. Whether it can be said that the Kellogg-Briand pact has for most nations ended this ancient source of po- litical title (p. 162) is somewhat doubtful. It is however clear that under the San Francisco Charter conquest as a reason for annexation of territory is obsolete, so long as the Charter remains in effect. In a sense, discovery or occupation or both (pp. 143-146) which once loomed so large in the history of rival claims to American territory, is a form of conquest, since the lands were almost never empty. That they were res nullius, because the inhabitants were pagans who had no rights against Christians, was asserted in its most brutal form by Coke, but the idea had long before been repudiated by Spanish Dominicans, like de Victoria and Covarrubias, and later not only by Grotius and Pufendorf, but by common- lawyers who had a stronger sense of moral obligation than Coke. It must be remembered, however, that as late as the early nineteenth century, some English manuals of international law still asserted the doctrine that the rules of international law had no application to non-Christian nations. Claims to territory on all the various grounds asserted at different times have a long history. It is here that Professor Hill's presentation may be found somewhat defective. In general, concept of land in its relation to feudal tenure does not seem clear in the writer's mind, and yet this concept had a great deal to do with the development of claims to territory in modern times. Similarly, there was no such vagueness as he states in the notion of boundaries during the Roman empire. The very word fines suggests the oppositel and for the units with which the Romans were specially concerned, city states, and colonies, they had a professional group of technical sur- veyors in the gromatici or agrimensores. On a more modern point, Professor Hill fails to apprize us in his two references to the Chamizal controversy between the United States and Mexico (pp. 157 and 163) that the arbitration award was rejected by the United States and that the question is still a seething one which will doubt- less be revived after peace is fully established. A serious gap in Professor Hill's presentation is his omission to list con- formity or disparity of religion among the powerful factors which determine where lines of territorial demarcation shall be drawn. It is a delicate and thorny question, not to be approached lightly, but it has played a notable part in the territorial disputes of Europe, Asia and Africa. Professor Hill apparently chooses to ignore it. The only reference is found not in the text, but in the third point of the Report of the Committee on Polish Affairs (cited pp. 176-178) to the effect that "due weight be at- tached to lines of religious cleavage, as for example in Maguria,2 where a 1The ritual of the fetiales implied a precise knowledge of the enemy boundary, and the limitation of the provincial imperium to a specific territory required a fairly definite understanding of where the territory ended. We still speak of "crossing the Rubicon," which was the boundary line between Cis-Alpine Gaul and Italy.</page><page sequence="4">19451 BOOK REVIEWS 467 Protestant population exists which is Polish in speech and race." In the same way religious antagonisms between the Eastern and the Roman Cath- olic churches have made Jugoslavia a difficult country to manage as a single territorial unit, and has added to the complications of the settlement of the Polish eastern frontiers, since the Ruthenians and White Russians in the territory beyond the Curzon line profess a religion different from that of the Poles. Perhaps the most dishonest of the many kinds of claims are those which are made to depend on such doctrines as "manifest destiny" or "Lebens- raum." We hear little of the former now, although it was a potent phrase in the United States from the beginning of our national history till just before the World War. It is odd that Carl Schurz who used it to advocate the annexaation of Canada in 1893 (p. 12) opposed it with vehemence and ridicule when it was employed to justify the annexation of the Spanish colonies. Although it has disappeared as a set phrase, its implication of a divine right, or a natural right, on the part of a superior people was the basis of the Nazi theory of international relations. The pseudo-science of Geopolitics has been built on this quicksand. It is elaborately and destructively exam- ined in Edward Bristler's, Die Vilkerrechtslehre des Nationalsozialismus, (Ziirich 1938), and it is not likely to be seriously advanced, even in its most disguised form, by any of the countries that will appear before the Security Council of the United Nations. But we shall certainly hear some form of the equally disingenous doc- trine of Lebensraum. Professor Hill discusses it pp. 7-8 but both he and Lord Halifax whom he quotes (p. 7) seem to me to miss the fundamental fallacy. This is the old and long discredited notion that a nation cannot be safe unless all possible sources of its livelihood are under its political con- trol. Unless this is expressed in the unabashed terminology of the right of the stronger, it is in direct contradiction with history or common sense, since autarchy-this incorrect spelling has pretty well crowded out the more cor- rect "autarky"-is non-existent even for nations like the United States or Russia. Perhaps the Economic Council of the new organization set up at San Francisco will find some means of making effective the economic co- operation between nations. Professor Hill's book was written in June 1944 when the end of the European war could be called "in sight," only if our vision was exception- ally keen and our confidence exceptionally firm. He very properly refrains from speculating on what the governing ideas in regard to territories would be, if, as he doubtless was fundamentally convinced, the war ended in a complete victory over the Axis powers. He could not be expected to foresee the deliberations at Yalta, Dumbarton Oaks and San Francisco, nor the overwhelming demonstration in the air-war on Germany and Japan that the most strategically effective frontiers cannot prevent wholesale destruc- tion and can at best delay invasion, not protect against it. These facts, not 2 This is an obvious misprint for Mazuria.</page><page sequence="5">468 CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 33 to mention the atomic bomb, will completely change the discussion of the "strategic" claims, fully presented in Chapter IV, and at various other places in the book. And, of course, the system of "trusteeships" differs in many particulars from the "mandate" system of the League of Nations. There is scarcely any one of the many topics with which Professor Hill deals with which could not have been made the subject of a substantial book, indeed, which has not already been made the subjects of many substantial books. He gives us a brief resume of much patient and careful research and his book will be a valuable reference manual for many who wish to go more fully into the numerous questions it raised. The style is somewhat dry and the divisions and subdivisions slightly too numerous. The book has something of the air of an expanded academic syllabus, a statement which will not be taken as an attempt at disparage- ment from the lips of an academic reviewer. It is so full of names and dates and subjects, that one might wish that the index were fuller, but index- making is the most thankless and treacherous parts of book-making and any index is better than none. With the Conference of Foreign Ministers now sitting in London and determining the fate of extensive territories, we shall have many new and superseding illustrations of the claims which Professor Hill classifies and analyzes. Whether the new system under the San Francisco Charter will be more effective and final than the older methods, remains to be seen.
