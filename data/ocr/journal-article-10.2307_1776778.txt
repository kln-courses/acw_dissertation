He also speaks of "the sound of drums, flutes, lutes," etc. A volcano is also a "hill," or seat, of punishment for the wicked. OBITUARY. Dr. Alfred Kirchhoff. Dis. ALFRED KIRCRHOFF, one of the best known and most stwcessful workers in the cause of eographical education in Germany, died on February 8, 1907, at the age of sixty-nine years. Towards the end of 1904 he had been forced, by failing eye- sight, to resign the professorship at Halle University, which he had held for thirty- one years, and his powers had since gradually declined, the end being, perhaps, hastened by the results of a fall in the autumn of last year. Kitchhoff will be remembered, side by side with llatzel and Richthofen, as one of the band of successful teachers to whom the present satisfactory position of geography in Germany has been mainly due. During his whole career as professor his stimulating influence had been felt by a constant succession of pupils, who have themselves become centres for the propagation of his ideals and methods in many diterent parts of Germany; and the universal regard and affection which they have constantly testified towards him supply one of the best testimonials to the impor- tance of his work. His competence as a geographer was due in great measure to the many-sided character of his interests, which well qualified him to deal with a subject which forms, like ,eography, a link between the sciences of nature and man. Born at Erfurt in 1838, he completed his education at the universities of Jena and Bonn, where he paid attention alike to natural science, history, philology, and other subjects. For some years he worked as a teacher in various schools, and the experience so gained no doubt did much to qualify him in later years to deal with the needs of geographical education in all grades. Among his most important services to this cause were the various educational works which came from his pen, especially the 'School Geography,' which first appeared in 1882; while his con- tributions to a clearer understanding of the scope and possibilities of the subject as an educational instrument were no less valuable. It was to the regional side of geography-the presentation of a complete picture of a given country under all its aspects-that he attached especial importance, as was evidenced by his zealous furthering of regional studies in Germany, which hd its outcome in the excellent work of the "Centralkommission fur wissenschaftliche Landeskunde von Deutschland For twenty years Kirchhoff edited the well-known collection of monographs, brought out under the auspices of this body, with the title 'Forsehungen zur deutschen Landes- und Volkskunde.' He was also responsible, with others, for the periodical reports on the literature of German geography. A work of wider scope was the series of monographs on the geography of Europe, written by various experts under his general editorship, and originally planned, under the title, 'Unser Wissen von der Erde,' to form part of a descriptive geography of the whole world. Among Kirchhoff's shorter writings were various papers on the geographical and political relations of mankind, which bore witness to great insight and breadth of view. Among these were a study entitled 'Das Meer im Leben der V3lker' No. 1Y.-APBIL, 1907j</page><page sequence="2">CORRESPONDENCE.

Fall in Level of Central African Lakes: Lake Nyasa. IN the Journal for December, 1906, there appeared a letter from Mr. William Piercy on this interesting subject, in which he pointed out the fact that Lake Nyasa has been falling for a period of ten years, and enclosed a photograph of the marks painted on the rocks at Monkey bay, showing the level of the lake in different years since 1897. The level of Lake Nyasa has been more or less steadily falling for a much longer period than ten years. My own experience of it goes back twenty-to 1887; and for some eight or ten years before that, the lake and upper Shire river was navigated by the Scotch Free Church Mission steamer llala. With regard to the twenty-years period of which I have personal knowledge, the level of the lake in 1887 was considerably higher than that registered on the rocks at Monkey bay in 1897. The fall for some years previous to 1887 appears to have been more or less steady. In Livingstone's time a steamer drawkng 6 feet of water could travel up the Zambezi and Shire rivers as far as Chiromo, and the level of the Shire river depends entirely upon the level of Lake Nyasa. At the present date the Shire at Chiromo has almost ceased running. Mr. Piercy speaks of "a period of desiccation." This, I think, is a misleading description of the present climatic conditions in British Central Africa. There is nothing which could be described as " desiccation." The basin of Lake Nyasa (as in the case of all other Rift lakes of Central Africa) is an extremely limited one; con- sequently, if the rainfall within that limited area happens be in any year a low one, the result is that the lake fails to have its normal rise. The great bulk of water entering Lake Nyasa comes in at the north end. On the east there is no river ot consequence, and on the west the few comparatively large streams, such as the Rukuru, Bua, Loangwa, and Lilongwe, are mostly dry by the month of August, and remain in that condition until December. Rainfall records kept at Zomba, in the southern portion of the British Central Africa Protectorate, distant 60 miles from the south end of Lake Nyasa (outside the Nyasa basin) are as follows, for the past twelve years :- 1895 ... ... . 49-92 1896 ... ... ... ... ... ... 63-34 1897 ... ... ... ... ... ... 46-36 1898 ... ..... ... ...... 63-83 1899 ... ... ... ..... .. 6089 1900 . ....... ... ..... 42-87 1901 ......... ... ...... 50-41 1902 ...... ......... ... 48-52 1903 ... ... ... ... .... 49-35 1904 ... ... ... ... ... ... 74-13 1905 ... ... ... .. ...... 57-78 1906 ... ... ... ... ... ... 39-46 From this it will be seen that immediately south of the Nyasa basin there 466</page></plain_text>
