<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS 175 Marija Gimbutas THE LANGUAGE OF THE GODDESS Harper and Row, San Francisco, 1989. xxiii + 388 pp, US$49.95 This is a book about the religious personality of ancient Europe. In particular it is a catalogue of art and architecture interpreted as the iconography of an ancient belief system at whose heart pulses the concept of the Great Goddess. The bulk of the material derives from neolithic contexts but the myth is traced back to the Upper Palaeolithic and there are references to its survival up to relatively modern times. The Great Goddess has been a central theme of Professor Gimbutas's publications over many years. In earlier works she forged a particular link between the Great Goddess mythology and the pre-Indo-European Neolithic of the Balkans and Anatolia. The pre-eminence of a male deity, which forms a backdrop to later belief systems including Judaism and Christianity, is seen by Gimbutas as an Indo-European imposition on a pre-existing Great Goddess belief system extending back to the upper Palaeolithic at least. The transformation occurred around the fourth millennium BC. Her publications go beyond that to argue that the Goddess-worshipping pre-Indo-European world was woman-oriented, egalitarian and peaceful in contrast to the subsequent Indo-European world which is characterised as patriarchal, stratified and war-oriented. Until recently, Marija Gimbutas taught European archaeology at the University of California at Los Angeles and was curator of Old World Archaeology at the university's Cultural History Museum. Apart from its value to students of the ancient past, her work has had a considerable impact on recent feminist thinking and is also in line with modern concerns about the relationship between people and the environment. The purpose of this book is to present the pictorial imagery behind which Professor Gimbutas sees a Goddess tradition of great longevity. The author characterises the volume as a study in archaeomythology, a discipline which incorporates archaeology, mythology and folklore. The volume itself is a magnificent production. The text is illustrated with 24 colour plates and almost five hundred monochrome illustrations, each of which is accompanied by a generous explanatory legend. In addition there are summarising charts and maps at the end of the book. The main body of the text and associated illustrations is arranged in accordance with the four principal iconographical themes identified by Gimbutas: The Goddess as Life-Giver, the Renewing and Eternal Earth, Death and Regeneration, Energy and Unfolding. The text is not so much argumentation as explanation. Nevertheless the reader is left with an inclination to accept that Gimbutas has touched on a fundamental aspect of prehistoric religious experience. This is not diminished by the political dimension of her work. The world of the Great Goddess is represented as a kind of gylanic Garden of Eden (a gylany is explained in the book as a social structure where both sexes were equal). Although overtaken by the implicitly less desirable ideology of the Indo-European world the Goddess myth and its symbols live on to modern times in various dimension of our existence. In a somewhat missionary final sentence we see the Goddess re-emerging, "bringing us hope for the future, returning us to our most ancient human roots". The book sheds an interesting light on megalithic art and architecture which it sees as part of the visual imagery deriving from the myth of the Great Goddess. Here the work of Gimbutas interacts in an interesting way with archaeological research in Atlantic Europe, for it is becoming increasingly clear that many individual stones and applied designs in Irish and continental megalithic tombs are intended to represent an anthropomorphic image. The author interprets these anthropomorphic designs as owl-like representations and notes that in mythology the owl is closely associated with death. This in turn leads to the conclusion that the famous anthropomorphic stone in the western tomb at Knowth is a representation of the Goddess. If this interpretation could be sustained archaeologically it would enrich our understanding of megalithic art beyond measure. Owl-like designs occur on C6 at Sess Kilgreen and on C3 in Cairn U at Loughcrew, the former a backstone in the tomb and the other the backstone of a recess, while a curious owl-like design looks down on the chamber from a position just under the central capstone in the eastern tomb at Knowth. Whether by an extraordinary coincidence or in support of Gimbutas's explanatory scheme, orthostat C5 beside</page><page sequence="2">176 BOOK RECEIVED the 'owl' design at Sess Kilgreen bears a design which has parallels in the repertoire illustrated by Gimbutas. In fact, if the reader is happy to accept the language scheme presented by Gimbutas, a ready-made interpretation is available in this book for many of the elements and combinations that occur in Irish megalithic art. There is even an explanation for the standard plan of Court Tombs: they represent a standing or seated Goddess. Confidence in the overall scheme is undermined slightly when one sees that the science fiction linking megalithic art with lunar cycles is adopted with as much confidence as more carefully established archaeological deductions. Similarly the comments which associate foot-symbols with standard Breton and Irish/British megalithic art motifs at Le Petit Mont and the Calderstones respectively fail to take account of the strong archaeological arguments which seem to separate the foot-marks contextually from the other motifs in both cases. And this, of course, reminds one that archaeological rules of observation and inference do not necessarily apply here because this is a book of archaeomythology. The Language of the Goddess provides a stimulating read. Its informative and challenging text is recommended to anyone who wishes to gain an insight into the deeper meaning of the prehistoric past. It casts a distinctive hue over the meaning of megalithic art and architecture. A work of this nature, because it takes mythology seriously, carries the danger of being cast aside from mainstream archaeology. The study of prehistory would be impoverished significantly by such an occurrence. Muiris O'Sullivan</page></plain_text>
