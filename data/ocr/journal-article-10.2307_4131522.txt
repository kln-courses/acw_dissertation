INTRODUCTION: THE MANUSCRIPT Back in 1993, as senior librarian at the Vernadsky Library in Kiev, Ukraine, in charge of cataloguing a newly uncovered Judaica collection, I came across an enig- matic manuscript entitled Sefer ha-heshek. It did not match the bulk of the Judaica holdings.' Nor did it fit in Abraham Harkavy's collection of medieval manu- scripts.2 It was too Ashkenazic for Abraham Firkovich's Karaite papers,3 and too I am grateful to Arthur Green and Jonathan Sarna, who have read previous drafts of this paper and generously shared with me their criticism. I am especially grateful to Ze'ev Gries and Moshe Ros- man, whose invaluable comments helped me to improve the final draft. 1.

The only in-depth description of the collection, together with a preliminary list of some two hundred manuscripts, is given in Dov Walfish, "'Osef ha-sefarim ve-kitvei ha-yad be-sifriyat vernadsky be- kiev," Mada'ei ha-yahadut 34 (1994): 68-86. 2. Abraham Harkavy (Abram lakovlevich Garkavi, 1835-1919), the founder of Russian Ju- daica and Hebraica, was in charge of the Department of Oriental Manuscripts at the St. Petersburg Im- perial Library, responsible for cataloguing and acquisitions. A follower of Wissenschaft des Judentums, Harkavy overlooked kabbalistic works, concentrating chiefly on Spanish-Jewish literature of the Gold- en Age. On Harkavy's manuscript collection, see Yohanan Petrovsky, "The Lost Chapter of Russian Judaica: Abraham Harkavy's MSS in The Vernadsky Library collection," Jews and Slavs 5 (Jerusalem: Hebrew University, 1996), 157-168. 3. Abraham Firkovich (1786-1874), a Karaite communal leader, traveler, sui generis historian of Karaism and author of the most well-known ninteenth-century manuscript forgeries, amassed a sig- nificant collection of Genizah fragments and Karaite manuscripts, which he sold shortly before his death to the St. Petersburg Imperial Library.

Ansky's nineteenth-century folkloric materials.4 The manu- script had a wooden cover, separate from the text, with a copper monogram Sefer ha-heshek in Hebrew (hereafter-SH). SH's title appears randomly as a running head; the author occasionally refers to the title of the manuscript.5 Primarily be- cause of its size-411 folios, 23 of them blank, some 760 filled pages altogeth- er-and due to its magical contents, I discarded any attempts to identify the manuscript as a version of the well-known Sefer ha-heshek, a twenty-or-so-page kabbalistic treatise on the names of the archangel Metatron attributed to Isaac Luria.6 Also, since the manuscript is not a commentary on the book of Isaiah or Proverbs, it could neither be Solomon Duran's nor Solomon ha-Levi's Heshek she- lomoh.7 The manuscript is strongly reminiscent of a lost Yiddish book on practical Kabbalah and folk medicine entitled Sefer heshek, apparently written at the be- ginning of the eighteenth century by the doctor Wolf Binyamin ben Zevi Hirsch from Posen, who studied medicine at the University of Frankfurt am Oder and pur- portedly published his composition in 1727 in Hanau.8 Like the Hanau book, the newly discovered SH drew heavily from popular Kabbalah and folk medicine. Yet, unlike the Hanau one, it was Hebrew, not Yiddish; it claimed a different authorship (not Wolf Binyamin); it was composed in East Europe and not in Germany; and it seemed much more complex than its Hanau prototype. In addition, nobody has seen the Hanau book since the early eighteenth century,9 if indeed it ever existed as a book. Shatzky, who himself never saw the Hanau SH, which is not listed ei- ther in the Friedberg, Benjacob, or Vinograd catalogues, reconstructed its contents through oblique references to its sources mentioned in Steinschneider, who did not see the book either. Though it is possible that the newly discovered SH in terms of its title and genre is somehow related to the lost Yiddish medical tractate, the com- 4. Semion Ansky (Shloyme Zanvl Rapoport, 1863-1920), a Russian-Jewish and Yiddish writer, populist, Kulturtreger, and ethnographer, amassed several hundred Judaica manuscripts during his ex- pedition to the Pale of Jewish Settlement in Russia between 1911 and 1914.

This SH is an in quarto manuscript written on a plain paper without water- marks. It has a leather spine and no back cover. The worn, greasy edges of the pa- per signify that the manuscript had been not only in use, but in intensive use. The author's consistent yet awkward early-eighteenth-century Ashkenazic semicursive script, different from the contemporary rabbinic script,' along with his occasion- al Hebrew misspellings, is telling. " Apparently, he was not a learned rabbi and not a rabbinical scholar (talmid hakham), although he had access to an amazingly broad gamut of books both known and unknown to us. The name of the author- Hillel Ba'al Shem-appears throughout the manuscript.12 The dates scattered in the text did not go beyond 1739 or 1740. According to the quality of the paper, the ink, and the script, SH was written most likely ca. 1740-1741, since at that time a regular consumer purchased paper in order to use it, not stock it, and the last date mentioned in SH is 1739/1740. The manuscript is complete. It opens with the words "And these are 32 rules against 32 paths of wisdom""3 and ends with the words "these are the words of Hillel."14 Hillel wrote mostly in Hebrew, rarely in Yiddish, inserting clumsy Slavic (Polish and Ukrainian) incantations, which he transliterated in Hebrew characters. In addition, Hillel illuminated his manuscript with some ninety drawings of kabbalistic amulets and anthropomorphic and tra- ditional Jewish symbols, as well as diagrams, tables, and series of magical signs.'5 Some of them were copies from contemporary books on practical Kabbalah al- ready published, whereas others were unique.16 10. For the mid-eighteenth-century calligraphy, see the facsimile reproduction from the manu- script written by one of the colleagues of the Besht: Dov Baer mi-Mezrich, Magid devarav le-yaakov, ed.

The most amazing are the anthropomorphic amulets that establish the links between kab- balistic abbreviations and members of the human body; see f. 215b and 217b. The amulets and dia- grams that appear in SH as well as the linguistic strategies of Hillel will be discussed elsewhere. 16.

A number of books illustrating practices of ba'alei shem were pub- lished before and after SH was written, yet SH exceeds all of them in terms of the historical, social, cultural, and theological data it contains. 20 More astonishing was tic abbreviations, see Eli Davis and David Frenkel, Ha-kameya' ha-'ivri (Jerusalem: Makhon le- mada'ei ha-yahadut, 1995). 17.

Aronson, 1994); Michal Oron analyzed the sab- batean context of one of the most prominent ba'alei shem in her "Dr. Samuel Falk and the Eibeschuetz-Emden Controversy," in Mysticism, Magic and Kabbalah in Ashkenazi Judaism: Interna- tional Symposium held in Frankfurt A.M. 1991, ed. Karl Grrzinger and Joseph Dan (Berlin and New York: Walter de Gruyter, 1995), 242-256. Oron also published important documents on and of the Ba- Sal Shem from London.

Ze'ev Gries contextualized popular Kabbalah books written by East European ba'alei shem integrating them into the genre of regimen vitae (conduct) literature that regulates every- day behavioral patterns, prescribes attitudes and remedies, and establishes links between the tradition and popular customs. Gries also connected the popularization of practical Kabbalah with the rise of in- terest in hermeneutic studies and medicine triggered by the Florentine renaissance neoplatonic acade- my.

Thus, the portrayal of Hillel Ba'al Shem against the backdrop of early-eighteenth-century East European itinerant healers, the comparison and the differentiation between the kabbalistic practices of Hillel Ba'al Shem and those of the Ba'al Shem Tov, and a discussion of the re- lations between Hillel and his own clientele are in order. Methodologically, this pa- per represents a slow reading of this eighteenth-century Kabbalah manuscript from the vantage point of the history of culture with special emphasis on the behavioral patterns of a ba'al shem vis-a-vis a Jewish community. This paper echoes the re- cent appeals to "reconsider the meaning of the ba'al shem tradition in the devel- opment of early Hasidism"21 and to reassess such pivotal facets of the premodern East European cultural history as its popular kabbalistic subculture.22 II. HILLEL'S CURRICULUM VITAE SH, our only source on Hillel, is a complex document. In it, first and fore- most, Hillel is trying to demonstrate his expertise in practical Kabbalah. He spends hundreds of pages discussing how to use holy names (shemot ha-kedushah) and impure names (shemot ha-tum'ah) in order to stop epidemics (14a, 20a); treat a sick child (23b); prevent epilepsy, dizziness, craziness, headache, and night fear (24a-b, 159b, 279b); treat fever, wounds, pollution, diarrhea, insomnia and bad smell from the mouth (117a, 145b, 254a, 255b, 260a-b, 295a,); expel evil forces from the house (31 b, 296b-297b); protect a feeding (32a-b, 267a); cure a barren woman (166a, 178a-b), regulate menstruation (168b- 169a, 262b-264b) and heart- beating (274b-275a, 278a); prevent evil forces from harming a newly born child (270a); keep healthy dietary laws (107b); stop girls' hair from growing (145b); pro- tect an individual and his habitat from an evil eye (156b, 293b, 385b), thieves (174a-b), fire (188b), bandits (293b), Lilith (329b); identify a thief through talk- ing to a homunculus in a bottle (163a-164a); and other things indispensable in u-refuot be-civrit" (Ph.D.diss., Hebrew University, Jerusalem, 1997) and Haviva Pedaya, "Le-hitpathuto shel ha-degem ha-hevrati-dati-kalkali ba-hasidut: ha-pidyon, ha-havurah, veha-caliyah le-regel," in Dat ve-kalkalah: yahasei gomlin, ed. Menahem Ben-Sasson (Jerusalem: Zalman Shazar, 1995), 311- 373. Most recent discoveries corroborate the fact that SH occupies a unique place among seventeenth- and eighteenth-century East European writings on practical Kabbalah. Thus, for instance, in 1996, Moshe Rosenfeld from Jerusalem (the author of a number of book catalogues on early Hebrew print) briefly introduced me to an untitled manuscript apparently written by the ba'al shem from Tomashpol (Ukraine). The size of the manuscript did not exceed 80 pages. Its content to some extent resembled the content of SH. However, unlike the often used SH, the clean white paper and the overall physical condition of that manuscript (especially edges and corners of the pages), testified to its rare use by the owner or its readers. In addition, the amount of practical Kabbalah information included in the manu- script of the ba'al shem from Tomashpol falls short in comparison with SH. 21.

Also, Hillel shows his profound knowledge of chiromancy and meto- poscopy (70b-73a, 200b-201a); exorcism (192b, 197a-198b); witchcraft (194a- 197b); origins of evil (302b-3 10a); levitation (312a); and horoscopy (247b-251 a). Proving he is a pious and observant Jew, Hillel demonstrates his knowledge of ma- jor kabbalistic concepts, which he consistently tries to connect to various Jewish practices such as daily prayer (168b), confessional prayer (169b), healing prayer (347b-348a), bed-time prayer (369b-370a), philanthropy (150a), family purity (174a-b), observing Shabbat laws (305a), celebrating secondary holidays such as Hanukah (247b-250a), giving oaths (314b) and Torah study (181 a, 184b, 186a- 187b). Particularly significant is that in SH Hillel provides-though not abun- dantly and not consistently-the details of his life, his career and its ups and downs, his modus operandi, his connections to the world of rabbis and doctors, his attitudes to colleagues, his feedback to the popularization of Kabbalah and kab- balistic bookprint, his personal modus vivendi, and the attitude of his contempo- raries toward him. What follows is a tentative reconstruction of Hillel's life based on data scattered throughout the manuscript. Slavic words in his lexicon23 as well as Yiddish permeated with Slavicisms24 would suggest that perhaps the author of SH was born in Eastern or Central Poland. Since he started to be active as a practical kabbalist and a healer around the 1730s, I assume he was either five to ten years older or younger than the Besht, born ca. 1700, or was of his age and was born most likely between 1690 and 1705. SH con- tains no reference to his birthplace or to the name of his father. Given Hillel's at- tempt to tell his own life story and demonstrate his mastery of kabbalistic arts, his reticence in regard to his origins is noteworthy. Perhaps Hillel was trying to, as Os- car Wilde put it, "reveal the art and conceal the artist." Apparently, Hillel had good reasons to do this. Perhaps at the end of the 1720s and in the early 1730s, when he began his career as a professional healer, magician, and Kabbalist, Hillel called himself the Ba'al Shem, the Master of Name (I doubt he needed the name, indicative of his pro- fession, before that time). Apparently he came from a lower-middle-class Polish- Jewish family unable to provide him with full-time rabbinic education. Unlike the famous Jewish doctor and kabbalist Tobias ha-Cohen (ca. 1652-1729)25 and the scions of prominent Polish Jewish families,26 Hillel did not study medicine at 23. He refers to Slavic, mostly to Ukrainian and Polish, to describe herbs (polny tablan, 7a; ma- jevy borsch, 9a; krapiva, 147a; gorchitsa, 182a), birds or reptiles (voroni, 22b; piavke, 147b; zozuli, 204a). He also uses lengthy Polish-Ukrainian incantations transcribed in Hebrew letters, see 362a- 364b. See, for instance, the following incantation in Polish (I retain Hebrew spelling): Zive boze, po- mozni, pomohi ten ohon ohniski i otruski, od silaiu, od glovi, ochi i od beloho kosti, od chervoni krev (Living God, [my Helper], help [to take out] that poisoning fire of fires, out of [his/her] strength, out of [his/her] head, out of [his/her] eyes and white bones, 368a-369a). 24.

Yet, avid for the knowledge of medicine, he apprenticed with various professional doctors in Poland. Among his teachers Hillel refers once to Dr. Simhah,27 twice to the great sage and doctor Rabbi Yadakov Zilon [Zahalon],28 and more than a dozen times to Isaac Fortis, "the great Rabbi and a great sage in all the countries of Poland."29 Abraham Isaac Fortis (dubbed also Hazak), a professional doctor from an Italian and Polish family of doctors and rabbis, probably studied at the University of Mantua.30 He also spent some time learning Kabbalah under the famous Moshe Zakut (1620-1697).31 He returned to Poland in the last decade of the seventeenth century, settled first in Lw6w and later in Rzesz6w, and established himself as a court doctor to two of the five wealthiest Polish noble families, Lubomirski and Potocki. Between 1726 and 1730 he held a position of the highest prestige when electedparnas at the Council of the Four Lands.32 Hillel claimed he had learnt un- der Fortis, consulted his books and manuscripts, and copied Fortis's amulets and remedies.33 He learned from Fortis rules of hygiene, both personal and public, par- ticularly important in the context of the late 1730s epidemic of cholera in Podo- 27. Simhah Menahem ben Yohanan Barukh de Yona (known as Emanuel de Jona, d. 1702)-a court doctor of the king Jan III Sobieski. Between 1664 and 1668, he studied medicine at the Univer- sity of Padua, lived in Z61kiew and Lw6w, and helped to solve communal disputes. He was accused of allegedly poisoning Jan III, but was found not guilty. His name, as well as remedies and amulets as- cribed to him, are mentioned in a number of practical Kabbalah books, including Ma'aseh tuvyah, Toldot 'adam, Mif'alot 'elokim and Zevah pesah. See, for example, Mif alot 'elokim, simanim 9, 51, 52, 169, 297, 337, 346, 410, and 416.

This is yet an- other mysterious pattern of Hillel's writings. It appears as if he wanted to conceal their names. The 1720s were the years of a fierce battle against crypto-sabbateans from Altona to Prague and Z61kiew.38 As a number of scholars have demonstrat- ed, sometimes it was not feasible to draw the line separating regular kabbalists from crypto-sabbateans.39 Was Hillel hinting at his proximity to the sublime mystical 34. Recommendations on public hygiene appear in SH on f. 13a-15b, 20a-22b. See the story about the 1654 (in fact, 1656-see Ruderman, Jewish Thought and Scientific Discovery, 232) epidemic in Rome which Hillel ascribed to Fortis, SH, f. 12b. Some primary knowledge of medical Latin, which Hillel demonstrates, may also have come from Fortis. 35. For example, when Hillel discusses different ways of preparing amulets or herbal remedies to treat melancholy (marah shehorah) he says that he learned this is from "professional doctors in the country of Poland," 6a-b; when he explains what should be done to a sick person, he recommends en- ema with milk and sugar and makes a double reference to Doctor Simhah and Doctor Zilon [Zahalon], 23b; he claims he learned from Doctor Fortis how to protect human body from evil spirits, 25a; he says that Doctor Zalnik (?) taught him what measures to take in order to completely recover after having drunk a poison (sam mavet), 108a. 36. In the second half of the seventeenth century, Italy became a paramount European center of Kabbalah learning. It suffices to mention Moshe Zakut and his circle.

Be this as it may, before Hillel became a practicing ba'al shem, he traveled through Bohemia, Romania, and Bukovina. He claims to have visited Tiraspol,40 Vissa,41 and Rozhnu.42 He recollects his sporadic meet- ings with an anonymous kabbalist from Rozhnu and claims he studied the manu- scripts of a certain Efraim, a renowned preacher (maggid mesharim) and prominent kabbalist from Vissa (Bessarabia).43 Hillel was lucky to land under the wings of his tutor, Z.evi Hirsh from Meze- rich (Miqdzyrzec Podliaski).44 Rabbi Zevi Hirsch (d. 1724), the head of the rab- binical court in Mezerich, could boast an impressive pedigree and learning. He was the son of R. Alexander and the grandson of Zevi Hirsch, the head of the rabbinic court in the same locality, who is mentioned in seventeenth-century response and who himself is the author of the volume of responsa Torat hayim (Lublin, 1708 and 1724); R. Zevi Hirsch was also the son-in-law of Rabbi Mordekhay, the head of the rabbinic court in Brisk (Brest of Lithuania) and the father of Mordekhay and Avishal, who eventually became rabbis of Lissa and Frankfurt, respectively.45 Hil- lel asserts that he spent a certain period of time under Zevi Hirsch copying his man- uscripts, talking to him, and learning from him the secrets of amulets and holy names.46 Hillel's assertion is revealing from two perspectives. First, even if he did not mention how long he stayed in Mezerich, the mere fact that he studied under such an authority as Zevi Hirsch-in addition to Fortis-testifies to his thorough 40.

Perhaps the travels of Hillel Bacal Shem were part of a larger phenomenon of Jewish wan- derers salient among East European Jews in the late-seventeenth-century and first half of the eighteenth century. Ze'ev Gries brings important references to the records of the council of Jews in Lithuania that specified types of beggars and vagabonds who were a burden for the Jewish communities in eastern Poland (Pinkas medinat lita, p. 33 sect. 130, p. 38 sect. 164, p. 53 sect. 250; p. 76 sect. 378; p. 133 sect. 559; p. 144 sect. 596). Depicting itinerant Jews, Gries includes in his list regular beggars as well as sab- batean and hasidic preachers and "prophets," regular vagabond teachers, fundraisers for Erets Yisrael, preachers of penitence (rebukers, mokhihim), and exorcists. See his review essay of Marc Saperstein, Jewish Preaching 1200-1800, An Anthology (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1989), in The Jour- nal ofJewish Thought and Philosophy 4 no. 1 (1994): 113-122, esp. 117-119. 44. Hillel identifies him as ha-rav ha-gadol he-hasid ha-mefursam u-mekubal kavod moreynu ve-rabeinu zevi hirsh ben ha-rayv ha-gadol moreynu ha-rayv avram hu avraham av bet din be kehillah kedoshah mezirich be-medinat podlasye ha-samukh brisk de-lita ve-kehillah kedoshah tiktin ve-hu hatan mi-rav ha-gadol de-brisk kavod moreynu ha-rayv mordekhay. Hillel claims that Rabbi Zevi Hirsch was the highest authority in both revealed and esoteric law in the whole Podlasie area. In addition, Hil- lel refers to him as often as to Fortis. See, for example, SH, f 63b, 107a, 174a, 358a-b. Hillel is accu- rate even in the way he refers to R. Zevi Hirsch's father, R. Abraham, the author of Torat hayim: the latter signed his endorsement of 'Olat yizhak (Frankfurt a/Main, 1692) with the following formula: avram hu avraham. See Meir Edelboym, Di yidn-shtot Mezrich (Buenos-Aires: Mezricher-lanslayt- farayn in Argentina, 1957), 295. 45. For the discussion of R. Zevi Hirsch (Junior, Hillel's mentor) pedigree, see Edelboym, Di yidn-shtot Argentina, 294-297. 46. Hillel repeatedly cites his learning under Rabbi Zevi Hirsh: "And I stayed with him and in my thirst I drank the words of the great Rabbi until I understood little by little the smaller face [of God] (mi-z'eyr "anpin) of his sacred writings and copied them." SH, f. 118a. 225</page><page sequence="10">Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern preparation for his career. Second, Hillel's claim that he had copied amulets and remedies from Zevi Hirsch implies that practical Kabbalah had already become part and parcel of general Jewish culture-even prominent rabbis were engaged in it, to say nothing of itinerant healers, well-established doctors, and ba'alei shem.47 Thus, with medical and kabbalistic experiences gained under Fortis and Zevi Hirsch, in the 1730s Hillel took to the road. From Mezerich he moved to Podolia and Volynia, and, at the end of the 1730s, to Lithuania.48 It was in Galicia and Vol- hynia that he started his career of a ba'al shem. In 1731 he performed an exorcism in the town of Shinove (Pol.: Sieniawa, near Przemys'l).49 Between 1731 and 1733 he was active as ba'al shem in Olik (Olyka), and in 1733 he came to Ostrah (Os- tr6g) and later to Tutchin.50 During his trip to the north, Hillel came to Shklov.51 In 1739 he reached Keidan.52 Apparently, at that time he was married and had at least two daughters.53 Between 1739 and 1741 he moved westward, heading prob- ably to Posen (Poznani), where he started writing his manuscript, which, he be- lieved, would change his life for the better.54 III. HILLEL BAcAL SHEM AND THE JEWISH COMMUNITY The beginning of Hillel's career was promising. He visited important Jew- ish communities in Volynia and Podolia and was commissioned as bacal shem. His success in Ostrah, the third place he visited in his itinerary, was pivotal. In the 1730s, Ostrah was an important private Polish town. It boasted a huge Polish palace and fortress, one of the busiest annual fairs in Poland, a beautiful, big sixteenth- century, fortress-shaped synagogue, more than 20 smaller synagogues and prayer houses, and illustrious rabbis, some of them descendants of the disciples of Ma- haral (Rabbi Yehudah L6we ben Bezalel of Prague, 1525-1609).55 Hillel came to 47. Thus SH provides additional support to the argument that by the 1720s Kabbalah captured minds of East European Jews, see Etkes, Bacal ha-shem, chap. 1; Hundert, Jews in Poland-Lithuania, chap. 6; Rosman, Founder of Hasidism, chap. 1.

This assumption is based on Hillel's attempts to please German Jews (yehudei Ashkenaz) at the expense of Polish Jews (yehudei Polin). Hillel refers to the former as to his potential readers and, he hopes, his future employers: "As I have observed in different communities in Poland, Podol, and Vol- hyn, they [the Jews] pray in their houses of learning (batei midrash) in such a loose way, that only some of them will go to Paradise. It is because of that [loose prayer] that the Redemption is not coming. How- ever, I praise the [Jews in the] countries of Ashkenaz, let them see the Redemption!" SH, f 80a. 55.

Either Hillel could not prove his pedigree and learning and was not allowed into the kloyz, an elitist prayer house of East Euro- pean kabbalists, or the kloyz did not fit Hillel's immediate interests.56 At any rate, Hillel spent two or three days in a special room of the local bet midrash. Indeed, he learned that there was an incident in the community-a woman had an evil spir- it (dybbuk) who refused to leave her body-and he waited until the elders of the city commissioned him to perform the exorcism. Apparently, there was some con- sternation among the elders, who were either reluctant to rely on the powers of an itinerant ba'al shem or mistrusted Hillel personally, or both. This is how Hillel de- scribes the episode: One evening the evil spirit [ruah] sent for the honorable man, the former bea- dle [shamash] of the Rabbi, a great hasid and the Kabbalist Naftali Kohen Zedek, of blessed memory.57 The spirit instructed him that he should immedi- ately find Reb Hillel BaCal Shem, who had just come to their community. "He [Reb Hillel BaCal Shem] will put an end to my days with the help of holy names in the synagogue. He might be able to find a kind of remedy for me." And that man [the beadle] did not want to listen to the spirit and started to talk in pub- lic. Later, the demon told the beadle from the body of the woman: "If you do not go to the BaCal Shem, you will be sorry, for it will definitely be too late."58 From this episode one may learn, first, that Hillel was not a famous bacal shem. Second, he did his best to prove he was well known-if not among local Jews, than at least among the otherworldly inhabitants. Hillel used the dybbuk, a representa- tive of the evil powers, to establish his reputation. Third, local dwellers treated Hil- lel harshly despite his desire to help them.59 They mistrusted Hillel and in all likelihood mocked him in public-hence the reluctance of the beadle to resort to Hillel's help. The case Hillel encountered in Ostrah was not an easy one.60 The confes- 56. In connection to the individual mystics active before the Ba'al Shem Tov, Hundert mentions that "[i]n some towns, there were groups of Hasidim who prayed separately in their own kloyzen ("prayer rooms"), or study halls, and were thought to benefit the community that supported them by their special ties to Heaven." See Hundert, Jews in Poland-Lithuania, 120 and references he brings in n. 5. The importance of the kloyz (and not bet midrash) as the center of study of East European kab- balists before the Besht has been in the focus of Joseph Weiss's fundamental essay, "A Circle of Pneu- matics in Pre-Hasidism," in Studies in East European Jewish Mysticism and Hasidism (London and Portland: The Littman Library of Jewish Civilization, 1997), 27-42. 57. To some extent the details provided in the text corroborate the veracity of the whole story. The late Naftali Cohen Zedek, mentioned by Hillel Ba al Shem, was most likely Rabbi Naftali ben Yizhak Kaz, the head of the rabbinical court and the chief rabbi of the province. After Ostrah he held the position of a chief rabbi in Posen and Frankfurt am Main. He passed away in Turkey while travel- ing to the Land of Israel. See Sefer ostrah, 38. 58. SH, 126a. 59. Hillel thus describes the treatment he received in Ostrah: "They brought me [by force] from the ritual bath before the morning prayer," "they opened their mouths against me.. ." SH, f. 126a-b. 60. My analysis of the socio-psychological reality of exorcism is based on the methodology 227</page><page sequence="12">Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern sion obtained from the woman/dybbuk under the threat of excommunication re- vealed that a certain Jew took a non-Jewish concubine and had children with her. For unknown reasons he was later involved in a murder case. Jews tried to arrest and prosecute him but he converted to Greek Orthodoxy (be-'emunat yavan) and circumvented punishment. Finally, he died a terrible death. Since he was possibly not buried properly (a posthumous punishment for a criminal and an apostate), af- ter several years he apparently became an evil spirit (ruah). He settled in a tree in Ostrah, not far from the town's big synagogue, waiting for a victim.61 Once on Shabbat, when a pregnant woman was sitting under the tree inhabited by the spir- it, the latter entered her body through her right eye, thus becoming a dybbuk.62 She lost sight in that eye. The same night the dybbuk tortured the woman's husband un- til he died. Soon the woman gave birth to a baby girl. Although the girl was healthy, the dybbuk spent some seven years within the woman's body, growing stronger and causing her bitter sufferings until she became completely blind. At this point the community decided to search for a remedy. Further details of the story make us think that Hillel uses "evil spirit" (he avoids the word "dybbuk") as a substitute for the issues of promiscuity and het- erodoxy. A certain woman from Ostrah had intimate relations with a convert out- side her wedlock. Her lover killed her Jewish husband but did not harm the daughter. Blindness was either metaphorical (she was the only one who did not un- derstand the results of her sickness) or real, inflicted by the harsh treatment of the Jewish woman by the convert. Perhaps the implications of heterodoxy made Hil- lel subsequently transfer the exorcism to outside the center of the town.63 The prox- elaborated by Marion Gibson in "Witchcraft trials-how to read them" and "Deconstructing generic stories," in Reading Witchcraft: Stories of Early European Witches (London and New York: Routledge, 1999), 50-109. It is also supported by Christine Worobec's statement that certain types of possession "represent a socially understood illness as opposed to a medical disease," see Christine D. Worobec, Possessed: Women, Witches, and Demons in Imperial Russia (DeKalb: Northern Illinois University Press, 2001), 17. My approach finds support also in Yoram Bilu's statement: "The validation of the moral ascendancy of religious leaders through the dybbuk idiom contributed to social control ... The exorcistic ritual constituted a conservative mechanism that facilitated the perpetuation of the traditional status hierarchy in the community." See Yoram Bilu, "The Taming of the Deviants and Beyond: An Analysis of Dybbuk Possession and Excorcism in Judaism," in Spirit Posession in Judaism: Cases and Context from the Middle Ages to the Present, ed. Matt Goldish (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 2003), 64. 61. The motif of an evil spirit or a spirit of a deceased person sitting on a tree and addressing the vagabonds appears already in Sefer hasidim. See Jehuda Wistinetzki and Jacob Freimann, ed., Se- fer hasidim (Frankfurt a/M: Warhmann Verlag, 1924), 37 (siman 35); this book is based on Parma MS. Cf.

According to the evidence meticulously collected by Nigal, evil spirits and dibbukim pre- fer to enter homes either through doors not protected by mezuzot or through any part of the body of a sick person, in particular pregnant women.

On a very similar case involving a Jewish woman and her husband, Jan Serafinowicz, who converted to Catholicism after being attended to by a ba'al shem, see Meir Balaban, Le-toldot ha- tenu'ah ha-frankit (Tel Aviv: Devir, 1934), 57-58.

On the other hand, exorcism led to confessions on the part of the woman that were offensive to the Jewish community at large. Nobody liked the fact that Hil- lel made the Ostrah Jews wash their dirty laundry in public.66 Hillel portrays the exorcism in great detail. If SH presents it accurately, at least in regard to Hillel's modus operandi, one feature of Hillel's practices becomes particularly salient. It was the dybbuk that instructed Hillel about the methods of exorcism, its time and place, the preparation it required, and its possible out- come.67 The dybbuk allegedly told Hillel to bring seven Torah scrolls and seven pristine boys ("who have not sinned"). He advised Hillel to take the boys, before the procedure, to the ritual bath and to the morning prayer. He purportedly indi- cated that Hillel should go to the town of Tutchin, not far from Ostrah (samukh le-k ik ostrah), and finish the ceremony there. Finally, the dybbuk encouraged Hillel: "And you, Rabbi, should not be scared and do not run away from me."68 In terms of endorsement of his activities, Hillel briefly mentions the amulets of R. Zevi Hirsch ben Avraham, which he used for the exorcism, yet, when it came to the proce- dure itself, his only spiritual instructor-his personal maggid-was the dybbuk.69 the Jews in Russia and Poland (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1916-1920), 1:173; Israel Halpern, ed., Pinkas va'ad 'arb'a 'arazot (Jerusalem: Mosad Bialik, 1948) p. 265 par. 549; Hundert, Jews in Poland-Lithuania, 75 and 141; Rosman, Lords'Jews, 206-207. 64. Hillel resorted to the dybbuk ' assistance to explain the reason for his own weakness: "You are the Rabbi who has been acting for already six days. You have pronounced oaths against me and have tried to exorcise me using holy names. However, although you did not manage to do anything (shum pe'ulah) against me, you have somewhat weakened the wicked forces which surround my soul, and you have harmed my members, sinews, and bones. However, this is not the right place that allows applying the holy names, because the stronghold of evil stands next to-distinguish!-the holy synagogue. If you like to accomplish your work, you should better try a different place" SH, f. 125a. 65. The woman/dybbuk warned Hillel about the possible impact of local priests: "These are the priests who give their bad advice that they derive from the powers of their tradition. Their advice comes from their mouths [in the form of] fire and flames, and their words are not true. They will surrender to you, if God wants it" SH, 125b. Like ba'alei shem, both Eastern and Western Christian Churches re- sorted to exorcism as to an effective ecclesiastical ritual aimed at obtaining confession. See Stuart Clark, Thinking with Demons: The Idea of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1997), 428-434; Worobec, Possessed, 23-25, 45-48. 66. Hillel discovered outrageous and by no means flattering facts about the community: "And he [the evil spirit] revealed publicly horrible and nasty things which had happened in that town among the Jews. And the Jews understood that the bird from heaven raised its voice, the time had come, and the end of all ends. All the secrets became known due to the powers of heavenly and earthly oaths. All the secrets impossible to convey here that happened in that town were finally disclosed" SH, f. 127a. 67. In addition, Hillel a priori relinquished any responsibility for the operation and burdens the dybbuk with it: "The only thing which I do not know is whether I will leave her body without her soul or with it," confesses the dybbuk. SH, f. 127a. 68. SH, f. 125b. 69. On the dichotomy dybbuk-maggid, see the groundbreaking article by Yoram Bilu, "Dybbuk 229</page><page sequence="14">Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern Due to the "instructions" of the dybbuk, who wanted the ba'al shem to banish him, Hillel was a success, and socio-psychological order was restored: I pronounced one great oath and one great petition in the presence of ten ap- propriate people and the Torah scrolls. Thursday, Elul, 5493 [1733], the spirit left the body of that woman through the little toe of her left leg from under her little nail so that some blood came out of her toe.70 After that she began see- ing a little bit and she started going to the synagogue, to the cemetery, and to all other places as she found fit. However, she could not see at all through the only eye by which the spirit had entered her body.71 The Ostrah case suggests a clear-cut pattern of relations between the bacal shem, the communal (kehillah) authority, the ordinary Jews of the town, and the spirit. The ba'al shem performed exorcism in the atmosphere of public contempt. Although mistreated by the inhabitants of the town, Hillel was still respected by the kahal. He depended completely on the decision of the local authority. He start- ed to operate only when he obtained the official consent of the kahal elders.72 The difference in attitudes to Hillel Ba'al Shem manifests the interests of the commu- nal leaders who employed the ba'al shem as an instrument to strengthen their pow- er. While the kahal used Hillel to instill fear of promiscuity and restore social and psychological order in the community, Hillel used the dybbuk to instruct his audi- ence and instill some awe toward, if not belief in, the ba'al shem's magic. As we will see, this pragmatic usage of the dybbuk for self-promotion was not atypical for Hillel's modus operandi. Paradoxically, the only creature in SH that acknowledged the wisdom and high status of Hillel Ba'al Shem was the evil spirit, Hillel's alter ego.73 The Ostrah dybbuk not only "helped" Hillel to understand the situation in the community but and Maggid: Two Cultural Patterns of Altered Consciousness in Judaism," AJS Review 21 no. 2 (1996): 341-366. 70. In this case Hillel Bacal Shem closely follows the advise of Haim Vital who in his Shacar ruah ha-kadesh in the name of Isaac Luria strongly recommended that practical kabbalists make the evil spirit leave human body through a toe so that it does not harm the body. Eventually, the little toe on the left foot became a "classical" place for the exit of an evil spirit. For a comprehensive list of the "preferred exits" of the dibbukim, see Nigal, Sipurei 'dibbuk'be-sifrut yisrael, 54-60. 71. SH, f. 127a. 72. "And that man [beadle] went to the parnas ha-hodesh and related to him the words of the spirit. And the parnas ha-hodesh sent the beadle for me and asked me on behalf of the whole commu- nity to do some good for that woman," SH, f. 126b. Generally, the Jewish community of Ostrah (Os- trog) is mentioned several times in Shivhei ha-besht. For instance, in story no. 26, a certain doctor from this town is referred to as a staunch opponent of the Besht who mocks his magic powers. Similarly, in SH the holy community of Ostrah does not seem very hospitable to Hillel Ba'al Shem. They also mock him. They openly mistrust him while he is working out ways to banish the dybbuk. They start to hate him even more so when the community learns a lot of nasty and revealing things about itself during the exorcism. The general commotion caused by Hillel Ba'al Shem in the community is also quite obvi- ous. Cf. Bilu, "Taming of the Deviants," 55-59. 73. SH, f. 125a. 230</page><page sequence="15">The Master of an Evil Name also taught the Jews how to behave and serve God.74 Hillel's assumption is clear: if the community did not trust Hillel Bacal Shem, let them listen to a dybbuk. In the Os- trah episode only the dybbuk, the spirit of a dead Jewish convert, addressed Hillel as "ha-rav" It is inappropriate here to discuss the reliability of the evidence of early- eighteenth-century demons, yet SH clearly indicates that there was nobody else who respected Hillel: after the dybbuk "revelations" and successful exorcism, Hillel seems to have been left alone. Had there been some benign arrangement between him and the local kahal, Hillel, who looked for a stable position in a community, would have mentioned it. His reticence implies that, again, he was doomed to lone- liness, solitude, and wandering. Indeed, to make evil powers his only advocate was Hillel's clever ploy in the face of his situation. But the magician who was at home with dybbuks and evil powers was balancing on the brink of the permitted. Hillel did not realize he was causing his own failure-which was around the corner. IV BAcAL SHEM AMONG HIS COLLEAGUES Three factors caused Hillel's downfall: first, competition in the market of East European itinerant Kabbalists; second, the rise of publications of practical Kabbalah books; and third, the crisis of the profession of ba'alei shem. His per- sonal failures, which caused his distress and depression, were simply the results of these overarching reasons.75 Hillel suffered mostly because of his colleagues, pseudo-ba'alei shem, al- leged impostors, troublemakers, and unscrupulous competitors, who exacerbated the constraints in the market of practical Kabbalah. Hillel depicted them as "rob- bers" and "false hasidim" (hasidim shakranim) who sacrilegiously introduced themselves as experienced kabbalists to the communal leadership.76 Hillel com- plained that they never used Kabbalah for its own sake (li-shemah); whatever they did, they did only for money. They obtained falsified endorsements from insignif- icant rabbis and produced bogus miracles that had nothing to do with the honest opera sacra of a genuine ba'al shem.77 They caused skepticism among Jews to- wards amulets and holy names and subsequently towards all those healers who earned their living honestly.78 As a result, when a real ba'al shem arrived in a com- munity and provided valid endorsements from renowned rabbis, nobody would trust him.79 Therefore, from Hillel's vantage point, it was absolutely pivotal to 74. "The only thing I would tell you-through my stories and the deeds of my wicked hands- is that people should learn from me and through me how to serve the blessed Name," SH, f. 125b. 75. Hillel complains: "I should not say more in the time of my distress and distress of my daugh- ters, yet I failed and got up and not let my foes rejoice over me [Ps. 30]. I failed several times in sev- eral nasty places involved with evil forces ... ." See SH, f. 74b. 76. SH, f. 319b. 77. For Hillel's repeated complaints of pseudo-ba'alei-shem, see SH, f. 95a, 172b, 276b-277a, 321b. 78. SH, f. 299b-300a. 79. Kahana provides a number of cases proving that at the beginning of the eighteenth century the itinerant ba'alei shem or practical kabbalists were often identified with and treated as crypto-sab- bateans. See David Kahana, Toldot ha-mekubalim, ha-shabta'im ve-ha-hasidim (Odessa: Moriyah, 1914), 18 - 19. Kahana seems to follow Ya akov Emden's sharp criticism of ba'alei shem, most of whom 231</page><page sequence="16">Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern distinguish between a real bacal shem and a charlatan. Hillel suggested that the community should investigate, if not interrogate, any ba'al shem to verify his knowledge of Kabbalah books, his understanding of holy names, his haskamot (whether they were written by ordinary or well-known rabbis), and finally, his per- sonal behavior (how he prays, fasts, performs ritual ablutions, etc.).80 Hillel was deeply concerned that charlatans had undermined the trust of com- mon folk in the magic of the ba'al shem. Skepticism and disbelief of the ordinary Jews towards the kabbalists, according to Hillel's oblique references, had sabbatean implications. Hillel illustrated the spiritual damage caused by itinerant sabbateans through a peculiar incident that happened in the county of Pokuta in Bukovina Province in the town of Tismenits (Tysmienica), some 70 miles west of Chernovitz: A wicked man who was a scribe and renowned Kabbalist came into town. He stayed there for several weeks until he entered the house of the great hasid and Kabbalist Yosef Hols, of blessed memory, who passed away leaving behind a kosher and sacred Torah scroll. The above man went to [Rabbi Hols's] widow to [inspect] the scroll and found it perfect. Later he forged a cut (hakikah) [in the scroll] and demonstrated it in public. Then he demonstrated the mistake of the [late] Rabbi to the most illustrious people in the town. The next night Rab- bi [Hols] appeared [to someone] in a dream and revealed everything that this scribe had committed, including the time, the book, the chapter, and the col- umn in which the scribe had made his forgery, prohibiting him to disclose this information to the scribe. Soon afterwards the scribe stepped on a slippery path. He was banished and went to another country, to Little Poland.81 In this peculiar episode, a scribe and kabbalist whose reputation was in good standing abused the credibility of the community. He inserted certain misspellings into a Torah scroll with the aim of denigrating the former spiritual authority. The forgery was not a simple misspelling (hisaron or yeter); otherwise it would have been easy to correct. The scribe demonstrated the mistake in public because it was impossible to correct it according to Judaic scribal laws (hilkhot STAM).82 For rea- sons of self-censorship, Hillel preferred to make oblique allusions without actual- ly spelling out the "mistake." But in the context of early-eighteenth-century East Emden, by no means unbiased, identified as sabbateans. See, for example, the treatment of Eliyahu Ulianov, Shmuel Essingen, and Moshe Prager in Ya'akov Emden Sefer hit'abkut 28; idem. Torat ha- kin'aot 118-119. However, Scholem convincingly proves the sabbatean origin of these practical heal- ers, see Gershom Scholem, Mehkarim u-mekorot le-toldot ha-shabta'ut, ed. Yehuda Liebes (Jerusalem: Zalman Shazar, 1994), 110-111. However, assessing the spread of pietistic doctrines and mystical ideas in eighteenth-century Poland, Hundert notes that some of the pietists "were undoubtedly also adher- ents of Shabbateanism, but others were not." He also argues that the border separating old-style (pre- Beshtian) pietists and crypto-sabbateans was blurred. See Hundert, Jews in Poland-Lithuania, 121- 122, 152. 80. SH, f. 173a. 81. SH, f. 94b. 82. See Kuntres Mishnat sofrim on Mishnah Berurah, 36 and Mishnah Berurah on Shulhan ;Arukh 'Orakh Hayim 32:20. On the scribal laws related to mistakes in the Torah scroll, see Yizhak Shteiner and Yizhak Goldshtein, Dinei sefer torah she-nimzah bo taut (Jerusalem: OT, 1984). 232</page><page sequence="17">The Master of an Evil Name European crypto-Sabbateanism an uncorrectable "mistake" implied perhaps one and the same notorious trick: The followers of Sabbatai Tsevi, scribes in the first place, were known to insert the name of the pseudo-Messiah instead of the tetra- grammaton into sifrei STAM-phylacteries, mezuzas, and Torah scrolls. One may want to compare Hillel's description with the following testimony of Rabbi Moshe Hagiz, Hillel's contemporary, known as a persecutor of crypto- sabbateans par excellence. The text is taken from his Gebiat 'edut, translated by Elisheva Carlebach: In Poland one witness testified to a different sort of profanation of the sacred: R. Nathan, head of the study hall, had a Torah scroll from which the name of God was omitted. Instead, he inscribed the name of Sabbatai Zebi. There were ap- proximately fifty souls who knew of this, R. Hayyim of Zholkiew among them, and they did the same with phylacteries. When they investigated them, he tear- fully confessed; when it was all found to be true, they burned the scroll and the phylacteries. The communal scribe had contaminated many people with these phylacteries, and the communal leaders exposed him and whipped him ... 83 Apparently Moshe Hagiz and Hillel Ba'al Shem depict identical behavioral pat- terns, which Hagiz traced to crypto-sabbateans and Hillel to false bacalei shem. It would be tempting to reinterpret Hillel's references to the predominance of char- latans among Jewish East European healers in the context of the crypto-sabbatean schism.84 This might be particularly important in view of the parallel Hillel traced between pseudo-magicians and the dybbuks. As if sharing common knowledge, sometimes the contemporary Jewish community did perceive crypto-sabbateans as possessed by dybbuks.85 In this context, the rapid explosion of the population of itinerant ba'alei shem was perhaps a response not only to the growing number of those possessed by dybbuks and needing exorcism, but also to the expansion of crypto-Sabbateanism into Poland and the necessity to identify, neutralize, or ex- communicate the harbingers of heresy.86 83.

See Marijke Gijswijt-Hofstra, Brian Levack, and Roy Porter, Witchcraft and Magic in Europe: 233</page><page sequence="18">Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern Hillel was not unaware of the righteous healers among his colleagues. He describes them with one of his favorite words, zanua' (modest), which in SH indi- cates the highest level of spiritual purity and personal righteousness."7 Only zanuaC, a modest person, is able to produce a truly effective amulet (kameyac mumheh).88 Among the real wonder-workers Hillel mentions a number of righ- teous magicians89 such as Eli[yahu] Bacal Shem,90 Joel Bacal Shem,91 Naftali Kaz,92 Rabbi Yekovsky [possibly Jenowski] BaCal Shem,93 Perez Bacal Shem,94 The Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries (London: Athlone Press, 1997), 42. On the other hand, in eighteenth-century Russia, due to the Nikon schism and persecutions of the Old Believers (perceived as witches), witch-hunting cases were on the rise, especially between 1690 and 1739. See, for exam- ple, the fundamental research by Aleksandr Lavrov, Koldovstvo i religiia v Rossii, 1700-1740 (Mos- cow: Drevlekhranilishche, 2000), 347-354. 87. In Judaic tradition the usage of the notion zanua' is inseparable from the secret knowledge. The twelve-letter Name of God, for example, was transmitted by the sages to zenudim she-bi-kehunah, that is, the "discrete (modest) among the priests." Also, the secret forty-two-letter Name of God, ac- cording to R. Yehuda ha-Nasi, was transmitted only to a "discrete (modest) one:" ein mosrim oto ela le-mi she zanua'. See B. Kiddushin 71 a. 88. SH, f. 153a. Razi'el ha-mal'akh makes the same claim and uses the same word, zanuad. See Sefer Razi'el ha-mal'akh, 8a and 33a (Medzhybozh, 1819). 89.

Joel ben Uri Heilperin (Hilpern) from Zamogc, the famous ba'al shem and grandson of Joel bar Izhak Ayzik Heilperin, Bacal Shem from Zamoic (ca. 1690-ca. 1755), was one of the most well- known practical kabbalists of his time. He endorsed and penned a number of famous books on practi- cal Kabbalah, among them Zevah pesah (1722), Mif ~alot 'elokim (1710), and Toldot 'adam (1720). See a detailed discussion of him in Moshe Hillel, Ba'alei shem (Jerusalem: Makhon Bney Issakhar, 1993), 54-64, 90-179; Etkes, Bacal ha-shem, 41-50; Matras, "Sifrei segulot," 141-143; and Hundert, Jews in Poland-Lithuania, 150-152.

Rabbi Naftali ben Yizhak ha-Kohen (Kaz) from Posen (Pozna, 1649-1719), one of the lead- ing authorities in practical Kabbalah, was known for his wonderful amulets and successful exorcisms. He endorsed many books on practical Kabbalah, including Mif 'alot 'elokim (sometimes even ascribed to him-see, for example, Lemberg edition, 1872). He personally knew the famous bacal shem Bin- yamin Beinish of Krotoszyn and endorsed his Amtahat binyamin (Wilhelmsdorf, 1716).

Hil- lel did not hesitate to copy from their books and reproduce their amulets. To use his own parlance, these wonder-workers and experts in practical Kabbalah were true hasidim-in contrast with the false hasidim, charlatans, and fake ba'alei shem. However, even these righteous baCalei shem troubled Hillel. Their immacu- late conduct notwithstanding, Hillel felt deeply hurt by the fact that they began to publicize secret mystical knowledge and put their books on practical Kabbalah to press. There is nothing else in SH that troubles him as much as the publication of books of ba'alei shem.96 A number of prominent eighteenth-century rabbis, among them Yonatan Eybeschuetz and Ya'akov Emden, did not welcome the dissemination of books on practical Kabbalah and opposed the whole idea of their publication.97 It does not seem strange that Hillel Ba'al Shem was also unhappy, even deeply depressed, be- cause of their publication. Hillel's own reasons, however, were different from those ofYaCakov Emden. First, being published, esoteric secrets lost their secrecy; any- one was able to copy an amulet from a newly published kabbalistic book and use it at his own discretion. Second, published books nullified the importance of Hil- lel's knowledge of the secret techniques he used to write and apply the amulets. Third, Hillel cites an authoritative warning against publishing books on Kabbalah: Mystical books should not be published, and if published, should not be used for the sacred work of a ba'al shem.98 Hence, Hillel's indignation: In our generation, many books with holy names and amulets, all of them se- cret, were published. Do not use them-not in this world nor in the world to come, for they help the wicked. Someone purchases a book for himself 95. It is tempting to identify Heshel Bacal Shem from SH with Heschel Zoref, a crypto-sab- batean, whom Gershom Scholem identified with Rabbi Adam, the mystical teacher of the Besht. See In Praise of the Bacal Shem Towv The Earliest Collection of Legends about the Founder of Hasidism, trans. and ed. Dan Ben-Amos and Jerome Mintz (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1970), 15- 18, 31-32; the discussion of Rabbi Adam as Heschel Zoref in Gershom Scholem, "Ha-navi ha-shab- tayi r. heshel zoref-r. 'adam bacal shem," in his Mehkerei shabtaut, ed. Yehuda Liebes (Jerusalem: Am Coved, 1991), 579-599; for criticism of Scholem's identification see Moshe Hillel, Ba'alei shem, 305- 316. Rosman rejects Scholem's identification and strongly supports the viewpoint of Chone Shmeruk, who identified Rabbi Adam as the legendary late-sixteenth-century figure from Prague, rejecting thus any connection between him and Heshel Zoref. See Rosman, Founder ofHasidism, 144-145. For bet- ter understanding of Hillel Ba'al Shem it is important that despite his sabbatean reputation, Heschel Zoref was tolerated by such kabbalists as Zevi Hirsch Kaidanover, see Hundert, Jews in Poland-Lithu- ania, 125. 96. For a list of books on practical Kabbalah printed in Z61kiew, see Yeshayahu Vinograd, 'Ozar ha-sefer ha-civri. 2 vols. (Jerusalem: ha-makhon le-bibliografia memuhshevet, 1993), 2:306-308. 97.

Hillel constantly reiterates his criticism: "I have found in several books of great Kabbalists of previous generations who warned against the usage of mystical books," SH, f. 172a-b. And again, "In a couple of small books published in Zholkva they issued several amulets (segulot) and lots of names (shemot) yet everything was printed without any sense (bli ta am); one should not rely on them," SH, f. 188a. 235</page><page sequence="20">Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern [such as] Toldot,99 Zevah pesah,'00 and Po'el gevurot'0' printed in Zholkva [Z6lkiew]. These books never reveal secrets but only confuse people. One should reveal secrets only to the modest (zanua'). 102 According to Hillel, the unscrupulousness of certain ba'alei shem is the most im- portant reason against the publication of books on practical Kabbalah. Printed books found their way easily into the hands of impostors who did not behave them- selves in accord with the pietistic requirements, thus obtaining an easy opportuni- ty to cheat.103 That is why, claims Hillel, the publication of practical Kabbalah books has corrupted his generation.104 In addition, Hillel stresses the intellectual problem: The recipients of the newly published Kabbalah books do not understand the intrinsic mechanisms of the amulets and do not know how to produce new amulets on the basis of the published ones. Indeed, implies Hillel Ba'al Shem, the printed Kabbalah kills while the oral revives. Further, in order to understand how to use a handwritten or published amulet, what its connection with the Torah is, and in what cases it might be effective, one needs Hillel's oral explanation or clarifica- tion. Ultimately, Hillel is trying ex post facto to win a lost battle: He fights against publication of practical Kabbalah books and democratization of the kabbalistic knowledge since real knowledge for him is oral, elitist, and manuscript-based.'05 99. Toldot 'adam (Z6?kiew, 1720). 100. Z61kiew, 1722. 101. There was no such book published in Z61kiew or elsewhere.

Zevah pesah in- dicates this characteristic on its title page. The publication of small-size books allowed Z61kiew, first, to produce a cheap product and reach out to a wider Jewish audience, and, second, to put to press more books than the maximum 700 annual kuntrasim (in this case, book copies), permitted to Z6lkiew print- ing press by the Council of Four Lands as a result of the fierce competition between Lublin, Z61kiew, and Cracow printing presses at the very end of the seventeenth century. For the decisions of the Coun- cil, see Shlomo Buber, Kiryah nisgavah: hi ha-cir Zolkiv (Cracow: Bi-defuso shel Y. Fisher, 1903), 104- 105.

"In our generation everyone buys a book Toldot 'adam for himself. The book, which is a waste of ink and paper, everyone buys very cheap and becomes ba'al shemot. Yet, those who buy it, do not know anything about this world and about the world to come. They even do not behave according to the good behavior described in that small book Toldot 'adam." SH, f. 155a-b. 105. Mention should be made of the similarity between Hillel's, Jonathan Eybeschuetz's, and Jacob Emden's criticism of the publicizing of the Kabbalah books, see Idel, Hasidism, 35-36.

Com- mon disbelief in the ba'al shem contradicted the very core of the healing process, which, according to Hillel, required strong belief in the magical powers of the ba- Cal shem. Even a professionally made amulet would not operate if one did not be- lieve in it, argues Hillel.107 Hillel provides dreadful stories that illuminate the fatality of such disbelief. In one case, which took place in Keidan, Lithuania, in 1739, a woman refused to follow the advice of her relatives to get rid of the amulet. She kept it and managed to save herself from the evil Lilith.'08 Her husband took his amulet off, but Hillel does not share with his reader what happened next. In an- other case, which took place in Wilkowysk, Grodno Province, the dybbuk had been banished from a body of a woman, yet, because she had taken her protecting amulet from her neck and allowed skeptical relatives to open it, the spirit returned and destroyed all the efforts of the ba'al shem.109 It is very likely that one or both of these episodes depict the failures of Hillel. The chronological juxtaposition of Hillel's failures with the beginning of his work on the SHmanuscript (around 1739) makes one surmise that Hillel decided to restore his reputation demonstrating that he is a knowledgeable, well-connected, reputed, and pious ba'al shem. His so- cioeconomic position was precarious. Hillel considered writing a book as his last chance. Hillel makes it clear that on several occasions his performance as ba'al shem was a complete failure.011 As the result of his failure he was either banished from a number of localities or put under temporary herem. It is evident, however, that he could not continue practicing as ba'al shem." ' He had lost his reputation.

Perhaps the origin of this amulet is to be found among the popular medieval tales of Ben Sira that connect the destructive functions of Lilith to the circumstances of the creation of the first woman and that require from a healer responsible for writing the amulet special spiritual and physical qualities. See EliYassif, Sipurei ben sira be-yemei ha-beynayim (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1985), 231- 234. 109. SH, f. 34b, 54b-55a. This episode happened after the 1725 incident when an amulet on a woman was discovered containing sabbatean symbols purportedly written by R. Eybeschuetz. The sim- ilarity of these episodes suggests that the Jewish community mistrusted the production of baCalei shem on the grounds of their alleged involvement in heresy.

Hence, he conceived SH as an encyclopedia of practical Kabbalah in general and as his expanded resum6 in particular." Due to this twofold purpose, SH combined the vademecum of a practical kabbalist and a personal confession. V. HILLEL'S VADEMECUM Following the tradition of Sefer ha-zohar and Razi'el ha-mal'akh, Hillel claims that SH is a holy book.114 He identifies two reasons for this. First, SH com- prises a wealth of holy names, quotations from sacred kabbalistic sources, and amulets-in fact, SH itself may be regarded as a talisman, the holiness and effec- tiveness of which is undeniable. Second, Hillel argues that essentially SH is much older than any printed book on practical Kabbalah. He claims that all the printed books had been merely copied from SH, which remained unknown until Hillel Ba'al Shem obtained the privilege to disclose it. However, Hillel did not have a maggid-a mystical teacher; a double, like Yosef Karo's maggid mesharim"115 to secretly convey to him the contents of the book. Instead of cleaving to esoteric celestial wisdom through the maggid, Hillel reaches out to it through pseu- doepigrapic mediators--secret kabbalistic books and teachings.116 Two legends cover the origins of SH. According to the first, Ashmodai, king of demons, revealed secret knowledge to King Solomon, who recorded it, titled it SH, and hid it in the Western Wall of the Temple."7 It was uncovered in the times 112. It was Yosef Weiss who put forward and elaborated the concept of "secondary intelli- gentsia" (he called it ha-nodedet, vagabond; me-madregah shniyah, second-rank, and ha-bilti-rashmit, non-official) that comprised wandering ethical teachers, preachers, healers, etc. and that socially ce- mented the rising hasidic movement. See his "Reshit zemihatah shel ha-derekh ha-hasidit," Zion 16 (1951): 49-56. For the critique of Weiss, see Haim Lieberman, Ohel rahe "I (New York: H. Lieberman, 1980), 3-5. 113. Hillel perceives his writing of SH as a pious act and his perception resembles the attitude to writing among hasidei ashkenaz. See Colette Sirat et al., La conception du livre chez les pietistes ashkenazes au moyen age (Genbve: Droz, 1996), 144. 114. "Sefer ha-kadosh ha-zeh," SH, f 194a, 314a, and throughout. Cf. "ba-sefer ha-kadosh ha- zeh," "mi-hokhmat ha-sefer ha-kadosh ha-zeh," reiterated ten times at the beginning of Sefer razi'el (Amsterdam, 1701), f. 3a-4b. On tradition of a sacred book in the European Jewish pietistic tradition, see Sirat, La conception du livre, 37-63. 115. See R. J. Zwi Werblowsky, Joseph Karo: Lawyer and Mystic (London: Oxford University Press, 1962). 116. In addition to pseudoepigraphic sources, SH contains references to such well-known kab- balistic sources as Seferyeszirah (34b, 318a); Sodot ofNachmanides ( 15b, 32a-b); Sefer ha-zohar( 171 a, 187a-Pekudei; 302a, 302b, 303b, 305b, 306b-Bereshit); Tikkunei zohar (84a); Lurianic Kabbalah (14a, 16b, 23b, 30a, 70ff); Natan Neta Hannover's Lurianic siddur Sha arei zion (73b, 186a-187b); Sefer ha-pardes (20a); 'Emek ha-melekh (20a); Ma'aseh 'elokim (35b); Sefer razi'el [ha-mal'akh] (62b, 117a); Toldot 'adam (74b, 105b, 155a-b); Korban shabat (327a); Zevah pesah (both 172a). 117. SH, f. 117b-119b. Apparently the literary roots of this legend date back to the encounter between King Solomon and Ashmodai, King of Demons, whom Solomon captured, incarcerated, and made reveal the secrets of shamir, a wondrous worm instrumental in cutting the stones indispensable for the building of the Temple, depicted in B. Gittin. However, the idea of a secret book is absent from 238</page><page sequence="23">The Master of an Evil Name of the Sanhedrin and transferred through generations until it came into the hands of Hillel. According to the second legend, Hillel himself discovered "the old book SH" and drew heavily from it.11is Yet, Hillel's legend is not consistent: In a num- ber of places, for example, Hillel notes SH and the writings of his mentor Tsevi Hirsch as two different texts, whereas elsewhere he claims that SH was either writ- ten by Zevi Hirsch or belonged to him."19 By the same token Hillel also attributes SHto his friend Rabbi Efraim from Vissa.120 Evidently Hillel does not have a clear- cut version of his own versus the esoteric tradition. Intellectually he is too shy. In a similar situation, the Besht also maintains that he was in possession of unique manuscripts-in his case, of an enigmatic Rabbi Adam Ba'al Shem. However, the Besht takes the decisive step towards spiritual appropriation of his mystical man- uscript. He claims that besides him and the Patriarchs perhaps nobody else ever knew the contents of the manuscript: "They were in the hands of Abraham the Pa- triarch, may he rest in piece, and in the hands of Joshua, the son of Nun, but I do not know who are the others."'21 Hillel Ba'al Shem would not dare make such a bold statement. Direct connection to the secret celestial library (Liebes) is some- thing he cannot afford. The gravity of his magic grounded him.'22 SH depicts a world split into two parts. Living beings inhabit its first part; spiritual powers inhabit the second. Each part is divided into two subsequent realms. This world, ha-'olam ha-zeh, has a border separating Jews from gentiles. The other world is split into the realm of holy names and angels, shemot ha- kedushah, and evil names and powers, shemot ha-tum'ah. Each of these four parts has a pronounced hierarchy of values and is integral per se. That is why SH starts with the extensive explanation of this parallelism: And here are 32 rules that match 32 paths of wisdom as front and back. As they operate, thank God, in the upper [spheres]-we will be able to operate in the lower ones. As there are ten evil sephirot matching ten holy sephirot, there are holy names and there are foul names, there are celestial angels and there are angels of the earth (mal'akhey de-'ara).123 this source. See B. Gittin 68a-b. It appears only in Sefer ha-zohar, which lists four books that Solomon received from Ashmodai, namely: the book containing magical material, the book of the wisdom of Solomon, the book on physiognomy, and the book on the knowledge of precious stones. See Sefer ha- zohar 3:194b, 3:193b, 2:70a, 1:225b. For more detail, see Louis Ginzberg, The Legends of the Jews, 6 vols.

For example, he says "Thus I heard from the great rabbi and he showed to me in his book Sefer ha-heshek and I copied several pages." SH, f. 173b. 120. For example, Hillel recollects seeing an amulet in the book "Sefer ha-heshek [written] by the great rabbi, renowned hasid and kabbalist Efraim, maggid mesharim from Vissa." 121.

It is interesting to compare Hillel's manipulations with the holy names and the interpreta- tion of magic/mystical in Yosef Karo: "The difference between legitimate and illegitimate use of Holy Names is therefore not of pure (spiritual) versus selfish (magical) intentions..,. but between formulae of ascent and formulae of descent." See Werblowsky, Joseph Karo, 73. 123. SH, f. Ib. 239</page><page sequence="24">Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern The same reflection characterizes both realms: Ten heavenly emanations are repeat- ed in ten impure emanations, whereas the angels of heavens are negatively paralleled by the angels of earth. All elements oppose each other and mirror each other. Holy sefirah keter (the Crown) is paralleled by an abominable sefirah karet (literally "cut off by God"); good angel Katriel (literally "the Crowned Lord") is overshadowed by a corrupt angel Kartiel (the Destroyed Lord).124 However, the dividing borders be- tween them are not impenetrable. A Jew can become an apostate; a demon can ap- pear to the Jews disguised as a scribe or even as a ba'al shem; good angels become evil as a result of a mere change of the order of letters in their names. SH is full of antitheses and, to use the parlance of Roman Jacobson, negative parallelism.125 The permeability of the antithetical realms represents a constant threat to simple folk. As in the case of Macbeth's witches, it is difficult, if at all possible, to distinguish between fair and foul in Hillel's shamanic beliefs. The threat of an erup- tion of evil powers into the matters of this world makes life dangerous and people suspicious. Hence, the importance of the ba'al shem. He functions as a mediator between the four realms. He controls them semiotically through their signs and names. He knows how to differentiate between them and how to transform the pow- ers of one into the powers of another. Finally, the ba'al shem reestablishes the bal- ance between them. Who, if not the bacal shem, is able to identify evil powers in the guise of a kabbalist or a scribe? And who can exorcise these powers, if not the ba'al shem? In the language of social anthropology, SH introduces the ba'al shem as a shaman with a pronounced mediatory function to restore cosmic, theological, societal, and psychological order. 126 Thus, the ultimate goal of SH, informing its style and genre, is to clarify to a reader-whether communal authority or wealthy protector-the indispensability of the ba'al shem. To justify his mission, Hillel de- picts the complexity and danger of the spiritual worlds. According to Hillel, sitra' 'ahra' (the evil power) and its wicked heirs, the demons, are ubiquitous.127 The number of amulets prescribed in SH testifies to the astonishing ability of sitra' 'ahra to adapt to any environment.128 To keep it under 124. SH, f. 298a. In the traditional kabbalistic texts, Katriel (Akhtariel) is part of the celestial dichotomy Katriel/Metatron, and not of the Manichean dichotomy Katriel/Kartiel. See the discussion in Arthur Green, Keter: the Crown of God in Early Jewish Mysticism (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1997), 62-65. 125. See Roman Jacobson, Selected Works (The Hague: Mouton, 1979), 5:311-312. 126. Rosman was the first to insightfully place ba'alei shem in the context of shamanism, which he explained in the terms of Mircea Eliade's social anthropology and which has become standard since his 1996 book on the historical Besht. See Rosman, Founder ofHasidism, 13-15, 17-19. 127. Demons follow the commandment to multiply much better than do human beings (83b). They are not afraid of and cannot be stopped by sifrei STAM (94b). Neither the great rabbinic author- ity such as the head of a rabbinical court and rosh yeshivah, nor the learning fervor of the lomdim can stop them (107a). They prefer newly built houses (293b). A special prayer is required to prevent their appearance (46b-47a). If the prayer does not help, special secret names have to be pronounced to ban- ish the evil (341b). Sometimes damnation is required to put evil under control (344b). 128. Hillel prescribes protective amulets that should be placed on the front door (since a mezuza would not help, 188a, 297b), above the threshold (103b), and over each of the doors of the house (297a), and still additional amulets are required against fire (188b, 317a), thieves (156b, 173b), evil eye (41b), demons (291a), evildoers (194b-195a), and dybbuks (198b, 132b-135a). 240</page><page sequence="25">The Master of an Evil Name control, Hillel extensively employs the names of abomination (shemot ha-tum'ah) that cover in SH a separate chapter; he even establishes an immediate dialogue with evil powers.129 Hillel not only designs amulets against the powers of kelipah (here: evil), but also makes kelipah instrumental in achieving practical purposes. SH in- cludes amulets that allow observing evil powers in corpore (316a). It offers amulets that disable people (195b), induce sleep (196a), interrupt rest (212b, 293b), bring evil powers into a house (196b), prevent successful copulation between a husband and a wife (197b), and revive the dead in a dream (310a). It also offers effective imprecations against enemies. SH offers one of these curses among its amend- ments to the Eighteen Benedictions prayer, including it, quite surprisingly, in the petition of health and recovery (refa'eni): May the name of Ploni ben Ploni be cursed according to the words of the Holy One, blessed be he, due to the permission to fight the Christians.130 God of Yisrael, may the sons of this man become orphans and his wife a widow and may all the diseases and punishments recorded in this Torah befall him. For he is the trustworthy and merciful King ....'31 Therefore SH is not only a kabbalistic book but also a witchcraft primer. It is ob- sessed with kelipot, forces of evil, and it seems not to be interested in nezozot, di- vine sparks. Hillel is ready to use his magic to protect an individual or individuals from evil, but he is not ready to uplift an individual or individuals resorting to his mystical worldview. To paraphrase Moshe Idel, SH oscillates between mysticism and magic, but gravitates towards magic.132 Hence SH sharply contrasts with the bulk of Central European books of practical Kabbalah and resembles East Euro- pean ones such as Zevah pesah, Toldot 'adam or Mifadalot 'elokim. Yet its unpar- alleled necromantic nuances, absent in Zevah pesah or Mifacalot 'elokim, firmly place the book in the context of eighteenth-century Polish and Russian koldovstvo (witchcraft).

He interacts with the dybbuks (125a-127b, 135b-138b, 235a, 238a, 239b). In his interactions with evil powers, Hillel was not particularly innovative: evil names appeared in the kab- balistic literature long before the spread of Lurianic Kabbalah. Written ca. 1488 and 1504 in Moroc- co, Sefer ha-meshiv contained descriptions of evil names (shemot ha-tumah), demonologic references, as well as description of methods to neutralize evil power. See Gershom Scholem, "Le-ma'ase r yosef della reina," Meassefziyon 5 (1933): 126-127; idem., "Le-ma'aseh r' yosefdella reina," in Studies in Jewish Religious and Intellectual History, Presented to AlexanderAltmann on the Occasion of His Sev- entieth Birthday, ed.

Idel discusses differences and similarity between mystical and magic elements in Hasidism and argues that mystical-magic model is prevalent in the entire corpus of the hasidic literature. See Idel, Hasidism, 82-112. For Hillel, however, magical and mystical are two poles of the dichotomy that can- not be synthesized: Mysticism is a privilege of a kabbalist, whereas magic is for the popular con- sumption. 241</page><page sequence="26">Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern ic incantations and imprecations in SH, to be discussed elsewhere, testify to the fundamental commonality between the practices and worldview of a Slavic znakhar' (herbal healer) and a Jewish ba'al shem.133 VI. HILLEL'S ID Who was Hillel Bacal Shem? Obviously, he was not a charlatan who cyni- cally exploited and preyed on the most pagan prejudices of simple folk, like ba'alei shem depicted by Joshua Trachtenberg.134 Suffice to mention that the ba'al shem and large segments of the community shared the same values and beliefs. Nor was Hillel a halakhic authority, a rabbinic scholar, or a rabbi, as those ba aley shem portrayed by Immanuel Etkes.135 Rather, Hillel's worldview and his tragic fate re- semble those itinerant bacalei shem, vagabond shamans, members of the com- munal "secondary intelligentsia" and practical kabbalists, thirsty for some social leadership and a permanent position in the community, as described by Gedalyah Nigal,136 Michal Oron,'37 and Moshe Rosman.138 Hillel could do nothing but dream of the status of Rabbi Jonathan Eybeschuetz or Joel Heilperin-junior. The former practiced the art of ba'al shem and occupied the lucrative position of a town rabbi in Prague, and the latter was a community-sponsored practical kabbal- ist in Zamos~. Hillel could not claim, like the charismatic and very authoritative Naftali Kaz from Pozna, that he personally had met the Angel of Death; he did not have the necessary positive charisma to counterbalance this encounter. Rather, Hillel must be compared to Binyamin Beinish from Krotoszyn: both Hil- lel and Binyamin Beinish complained of the vicissitudes of an itinerant life; they both were self-taught kabbalists who knew Lurianic sources and the Zohar, but both failed to establish themselves in the community. Indeed, striking stylistic and 133. This commonality is manifested in the significance for both the Slavic znakhar' and the Jewish ba'al shem alike of the phenomena of "popular religion," that is, magical manuscripts combin- ing prayers and healing remedies (Rus.: "Travnik " and "Trebnik "), black magic, and the unity of prayer and incantation. See Lavrov, Koldovstvo i religiia v Rossii, 75 ff., 92-93, 127. I use here the Slavic no- tion znakhar only to give an additional East European flavor to Moshe Rosman's shrewd definition of the ba'al shem as shaman. See Rosman, Founder of Hasidism, 13-19. 134. Trachtenberg, Jewish Magic and Superstition, 79, 144, 196, 200. 135.

Nigal, Magic, Mysticism, and Hasidism, 10-12. Nigal highlights the dualistic function of a ba'al shem: "two personalities are capable of dwelling within the same person: the personality of the Rav-Philosopher-Leader (and even posek) and the personality of a wonder-working ba'al-shem. Ap- parently, no one in that period thought that these two personalities were in any way contradictory; to the contrary, all believed that they could exist harmoniously within the same person," ibid., 20-21. 137. In her article on Rabbi Samuel Falk known as Bacal Shem from London, Oron accurately highlights the ba'al shem's constant strive for social leadership and his desire to use his magic prac- tices with the aim of establishing himself socially. See Michal Oron, "Dr. Samuel Falk and the Eibeschuetz-Emden Controversy," 242-245. Also see Oron, Mi- "ba'al shed " le- "ba'al shem." 138. Rosman defines the common denominator ofbaalei shem as their "ability to employ mag- ical techniques for manipulating the name or names of God to achieve practical effects in everyday life" and of their practice of "what was termed practical kabbalah." Rosman demonstrates the presence of ba'alei shem at various levels of society. See Rosman, Founder ofHasidism, 13-15, 17-19. 242</page><page sequence="27">The Master of an Evil Name thematic parallels exist between Binyamin Beinish's Sefer shem tov katan and Hil- lel's Sefer ha-heshek that deserve separate discussion. On the other hand, although he was not a town rabbi, Hillel resembles Hirsh Frankl from Shwabach (1662- 1740). Like Frankl, Hillel suffered from persecutions and was deprived of the right to operate as ba'al shem. Frankl's book did not survive persecution, yet from its German rendering it is obvious that both Hillel and Frankl shared Manichean worldviews, were at home with evil powers, and were inclined to black magic and witchcraft.139 Ultimately, Hillel resembles Israel ben Eliezer, the Besht, before the latter settled down ca. 1740 in Miqdzyboz as a kahal-supported mystic and ma- gician.140 Hillel and Israel Besht both were itinerant healers and practical kab- balists, neither was a rabbinic figure, and both were looking for a tenured position. We will speculate later whether the differences between them stemmed only from the fact that one (the Besht) was more successful in the communal market than the other (Hillel). Like most of the East European kabbalists, referred to in SH as hasidim, Hil- lel Ba'al Shem was a classical pre-Beshtian hasid. He belonged to the generation of late- seventeenth and early-eighteenth-century mystics, who, as Gershom Scholem indicates, combined learning Kabbalah and practicing asceticism. Nei- ther the Kuty kabbalistic circle nor the kloiz of Brody were mentioned in SH, yet Hillel's rigorous behavioral requirements seem to correspond fully with the pat- terns of personal conduct adopted by hasidim in Kuty, Brody, and other groups of East European pietists.141 Moreover, SH may be used as a source for the pre-Besht- ian Hasidism that provides detailed descriptions of hasidic mystical practices (hanhagot).142 Hillel reiterates that ritual purity (tevilah, tefilah ve-taharah) is indispensable for a kabbalist engaged in holy work. Hillel meticulously describes when it is forbidden or allowed to write amulets. He introduces his peculiar cal- endar of "clean" and "unclean" days for those who are "modest." He designs a spe- cial calendar for oaths and damnations. He stresses that a person cannot be a true healer, ba'al shem, unless he is a true kabbalist, ba'al sod.143 According to Hillel's rites, a healer should pray with profound kavanah, alone, not necessarily with a quorum.144 A week of abstinence and daily ritual 139.

Mention should be made of the dramatic dif- ference between Hillel's Manichean usage of the evil powers and the idea of the transcended evil in Lurianic Kabbalah. See Isaiah Tishby, Torat ha-rac ve-ha-kelipah be-kabalat ha-'ari (Jerusalem: Mifal ha-shikhpul, 1962). 140. Rosman, Founder ofHasidism, 63-82, 159-170. 141.

Writing the amulet requires pietistic conduct and a tranquil environment. The kabbalist should prepare an amulet in a clean room. He must be alone in this room. He should write an amulet on a fine parchment. There should be nobody else in the house: no ritually unclean women, no charlatans suspected of making forgeries, and, amazingly, no repentant sinners, ba'alei teshuvah.145 Indeed, deliberate self-restraint from physical pleasures, the application of kavvanot and fasting before and after the performance make Hillel's conduct particularly close to the members of the pneumatic circles, predecessors of the Beshtian Hasidism.'46 However, in vain would one look in SH for such no- tions of the Beshtian Hasidism as devekut.147 Nor does SH require concentration on the letters of the amulets.148 Nor does one find in SH-except in traditional formulaic statements-an indication of its author's strong concern with commu- nal redemption. Divine sparks have no place in the dark realms of SH-perhaps this is one of the reasons that in SH there are no traces of a joyous spirituality so characteristic of Beshtian Hasidism. VII. CONCLUSIONS Hillel was both a typical and an atypical ba'al shem. He was deeply im- mersed in a Manichean universe inhabited by powerful demons, evil spirits, dyb- buks, and devils.'49 In his mind, these powers were ubiquitous, as in the Weltanschauung of the famous kabbalist Shimshon of Ostropolie (d. 1648), to whom Hillel refers, and in his nephew YaCakov ben Pesah's Zevah pesah. (26lkiew, ness of the Carpathian woods. See Shivhei ha-besht, stories nos. 8 and 9; Ben-Amos and Mintz, In Praise of the Ba'al Shem Tov, 18-23. 145. SH, f. 154a, 226b-227a, 331 b. Hillel interprets literally the famous statement "in the place of the ba'alei teshuvah the righteous zaddikim are not able to stand." His interpretation follows R. Yohanan and not R. Avahu, see Berakhot 34b and Rashi ad loc. Interestingly enough, as in a number of other cases, here, too, Hillel seems to be arguing against crypto-sabbatean reading of classical sources, in this case, of the gemara. See, for instance, the sabbatean interpretation of Berakhot 34b that em- phasizes the superiority of a ba'al teshuvah over zaddik gamur, in Naor, Post Sabbatian Sabbatianism, 22-25. However, in other cases Hillel inclines toward sabbatean ideas. Thus, for instance, he resorts to a sabbatean interpretation of the planet Saturn, which for the sixteenth-century kabbalist symbolized six profane days of the week and not Shabbat but for Shabbetai Tsevi and his followers came to sym- bolize Shabbat and Jubilee Year. See Elliot K. Ginsburg, The Shabbat in the Classical Kabbalah (State University of New York Press, 1989), 198 and 240-241; Moshe Idel, Messianic Mystics (Yale: Yale University, 1998), 192-196; Scholem, Sabbatai Sevi, 430. At this point I think the question of Hillel's inconsistent crypto-Sabbateanism has to be left open. 146. The Besht was also stringent about rules of writing amulets. Cf. Shivhei ha-besht, no. 187; Ben-Amos and Mintz, In Praise of the Ba'al Shem Tov, 196-197. 147. On the importance of devekut in Hasidism, see Gershom Scholem, "Devekut as Commu- nion with God," in The Messianic Idea in Judaism (New York: Schocken Books, 1971), 186-191, 206- 211. 148. On the importance of contemplative and ecstatic practices in Hasidism, see Idel, Hasidism, 45 and 75. 149. It will be fruitful to compare (and differentiate) the worldview of Hillel and that of Abra- ham Yagel (1552-ca. 1623), an Italian-Jewish doctor, magician, and kabbalist who resorted to the work of Aristotle to prove the physical reality of demons. See David B. Ruderman, Kabbalah, Magic, and Science (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1988), 43-58. 244</page><page sequence="29">The Master of an Evil Name 1722), which Hillel often quotes.'50 Hillel's familiarity with and closeness to this world informs the second meaning of his title that I propose: the Master of an Evil Name. Hillel starts with making a dybbuk his only respectable interlocutor and ends by making evil powers predominant in his thinking. Hillel says, for instance, that any operation (pe'ulah) that resembles a burnt offering (ketoret) should be for- bidden because burnt offerings nurture demons; any imitation of the burnt offer- ing will benefit evil powers.'5' To be on the safe side, one should not disturb evil, Hillel seems to argue. But should evil appear, Hillel's knowledge of how to con- trol its advance would be crucial. Again, the contrast with the Besht is illuminating. Having been rebuked for smoking his pipe, the Besht is reported to have replied that while smoking he thinks about the incense (ketoret) in the Temple. Through a kavanah mechanism he spir- itualizes a suspicious habit, imagining himself serving God in the Temple and thus achieving a higher status of devekut (cleaving to God).152 Besht came to be per- ceived as a pietist who mystically transforms evil, elevating human souls trapped in it. 53 In contrast, Hillel either engages with evil or keeps it at bay, but always is bound by evil names or an Evil Name, with which he magisterially operates and, perhaps, whose victim he becomes.154 150.

For instance, in a Yiddish text on Yosef de la Reyna written in Amsterdam by crypto-Sabbatian Leib ben Ozer Rosenkrantz (d. 1727), the incense is depicted as a powerful remedy that helps demons to acquire additional power, break the chains that bind them, and liberate themselves. See Zalman Rubashov (Shazar), "Ma'aseh r. yosef de la reyna be-masoret ha-shabtait," in Eder ha- yekar: divrei sifrut u-mehkar mukdashim le-shmuel aba gorodetsky, ed. Emanuel Bin-Gorion (Tel Aviv: Devir, 1947), 110-114. An episode in Sefer ha-zohar, Parashat Terumah depicts burnt offerings, the smell of which helps demons to cause nocturnal pollution to men. Although the Zoharic motif does not emphasize the direct impact of the incense on demons, it is functionally close to the incense/demon motif since it demonstrates the ability of evil angels to nurture themselves from the smell of the offer- ings (korbanot). See Zohar 2:130a. 152. For the Beshtian concept of the spiritual meaning and theurgical power of burnt offerings, see the discussion in Rosman, Founder ofHasidism, I 11. Sabbatians considered smoking tobacco one of the ways to neutralize evil powers. This behavioral pattern was later inherited by the Hasidim, who considered smoking the way to substitute incense offerings in the Temple. Mitnagdim, authors of anti- hasidic writings such as Zamir arizim and Shever poshim, were quick to depict and mock this hasidic custom. For a comprehensive list of sources on tobacco smoking among sabbatians and hasidim, see Gries, Sifrut ha-hanhagot, 205 n. 109. Louis Jacobs, however, considers smoking tobacco "peripher- al" for the hasidim, see his "Tobacco and the Hasidim," Polin 11 (1998): 25-30. 153. See, e.g., the story about the Besht uplifting the soul of a man turned into a frog for dis- obeying Jewish legal practices and trapped by Satan, see Ben-Amos and Mintz, In Praise of the Bacal Shem Tov, par. 12, p. 24-26; also see a story about the Besht neutralizing evil and uplifting the soul of a divorced and "loose" woman ready to convert out of Judaism, ibid., 245-247 par. 238. It is signifi- cant that the Besht made an attempt (though unsuccessful) to make a tikkun (correction) and uplift the spark of Shabbetai Tsevi, see ibid., par. 66, p. 86-87. 154. As far as the further development of Hillel's healing methods and the usage of the "holy and impure names" (shemot ha-kedushah and shemot ha-tum'ah), the eighteenth-century hasidic liter- ature moved far away from "magic" to "mysticism," insisting on the predominance of spiritual rather 245</page><page sequence="30">Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern Hillel's life story and his book furnish a number of tricky questions. If one takes into consideration the crypto-sabbatean overtones of the notion "modest" in eighteenth-century East Europe, one might ask whether Hillel was only a pre- Beshtian Hasid, zanuac, or also a repentant crypto-sabbatean.155 Hillel mentions a number of times that he is "repenting." His repentance, teshuvah, could have been the confession not only of a ba'al shem who has had some spectacular failures but also of a crypto-sabbatean trying to come to grips with the Jewish community.156 Indeed, for the purpose of exorcising dybbuks, that is to say, schismatics, there was nobody better than a former crypto-sabbatean: he knew the disease and was able to take care of it. From this vantage point it would be tempting to reassess the early-eighteenth-century dybbuks as schismatics and to reconsider exorcisms in the Polish-Jewish community in the context of the communal struggle against the crypto-sabbatean heresy and its ramifications. For example, before he left for the Land of Israel, R. Naftali Kaz from Posen, named in SH among prominent ba'alei shem, was reported to have met the Angel of Death in the disguise of a beggar.157 But it is well-known that the "Angel of Death," Mal'akh ha-mavet, was the eu- phemism for the notorious sabbatean Hayyim Malakh used in all the bans of ex- communications pronounced, repeated, and enforced in Central and East Europe against him and his followers.158 Was R. Naftali Kaz using the language that was transparent for his contemporaries but obscure only for us? When Z61kiew, this un- crowned capital of the crypto-sabbateans, started an unparalleled publication of books by ba'alei shem, was that an attempt to combat the heresy or to disseminate it? At any rate, these speculations are particularly pivotal in view of the dramatic than natural types of medicine. For example, analyzing the Degel mahaneh efraim by Moshe Ephraim of Sudylk6w, the grandson of the Besht, Alan Brill observes that "In contrast to bacalei shem literature, the Degel does not discuss demons or natural cures. Instead, the spiritual status of the zaddik is based on his connection to the inner light of the Torah and his sense of the Divine vitality within objects that cures and gives power over nature." See Brill's "The Spiritual World of the Master of Awe: Divine, Vi- tality, Theosis, and Healing in Degel Mahaneh Ephraim," Jewish Studies Quarterly 8 (2001): 27-65; the quotation is on p. 31. 155. While I leave this question open, I need to mention that one does not find in SH traces of a prophetic fervor, which, according to the recent research, was pivotal for the sabbateans. See Matt Goldish, The Sabbatean Prophets (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2004). 156. This is not to rule out the possibility of placing Hillel's teshuvah in the context of pietistic practices that were established by hasidei ashkenaz and subsequently informed much of pre-Beshtian hasidic rites. Cf. Yosef Dan, HasidutAshkenaz (Tel Aviv: Misrad ha-bitahon, 1992), 72-76.

One should not forget that it was an abundance, and not scarcity, of various types of ba'alei shem that irritated the author of Sefer ha-heshek and made his ordeals bit- ter. Hillel could have been irritated and even intimidated because he constantly felt the pressure from another type of his competitors, the so-calledfeldshers (orig- inally, former barbers hired by the army to attend to the wounded soldiers and pro- vide primary medical assistance, who at a later stage became paramedics). These semiprofessional doctors "with below university level education" rapidly grew in numbers in the late-seventeenth and early-eighteenth centuries. Perhaps some of them turned to private practice in Eastern and Central Poland as soon as they left Jan Sobieski's army, which boasted quite a number of Jewish feldshers. Others could have migrated westward from Russia and left-bank Ukraine, where, in the 1710s, Peter the Great established at least fifty military garrison hospitals staffed withfeldshers as well as special institutions for training them. Finally, some doc- tors could come from German lands where Jews, starting from 1721, were grant- ed the right to study medicine at universities. 59 Hillel was one of the last early-modern itinerant kabbalists involved, to use Moshe Idel's parlance, in mag- ic and mysticism; as such he was challenged from the one side by the rapid pro- fessionalization of the field of popular Kabbalah and from the other by the rising professionalization of popular medicine. Feldshers and doctors, and, late in the eighteenth century, new Beshtian Hasidim were slowly but steadily pushing old- fashioned healers such as Hillel out of the East European marketplace by making them altogether redundant. Another reason that caused so many grievances to Hillel was perhaps the fact that Hillel was not a learned Talmudic scholar (talmid hakham). Hillel does not seem to have received a consistent rabbinic (yeshivah) education. He could hard- ly compete with rabbis and scholars who, in addition to their main occupation, practiced as exorcists and healers.160 From this viewpoint, Hillel's failure oblique- ly explains the success of the Besht, who was no talmid hakham either. Yet the Besht, despite the attempts of the editors of Shivhei ha-Besht to emphasize his di- vinely inspired knowledge and diminish his reputation as a rabbinic scholar, man- aged to set and accomplish a task the traces of which we do not find in SH. In his letter the Besht wrote to Gershon Kutover, his brother-in-law, the Besht attempted synthesizing midrashic references, Kabbalah, popular Judaic beliefs, theurgy, and magic in the framework of a mystically shaped prophetic vision. We are not able to look at the prose written by the Besht or at the letters composed by Hillel, but 159. See Edward Kossoy and Abraham Ohry, The Feldshers: Medical, Sociological and His- toricalAspects of Practitioners of Medicine with Below University Level Education (Jerusalem: Mag- ness Press, 1992), 68-71, 135-36, 144-45; John M. Efron, Medicine and the German Jews: a History (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2001), 60-61. 160. In his review of Rosman's book on the Baal Shem Tov, Gries mentioned that the status of talmid hakham was pivotal for a practicing ba'al shem eager to sell his amulets and healing remedies to his clientele. See his "Demuto ha-historit shel-ha-besht: bein sakin ha-minatehim shel ha-historiyon le-makhelo shel hoker ha-sifrut," Kabbalah 5 (2000): 423. 247</page><page sequence="32">Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern in comparison with the somewhat clumsy and sometimes not very articulate Hil- lel, one may want to observe that from a literary perspective the Besht is more tal- ented: he does look like a talmid hakham who is proficient in classical Hebrew sources and who mastered the style of a rabbinic epistle. Finally, in the vein of a pure speculation, let us consider differences between Hillel Ba'al Shem and the Ba'al Shem Tov. Unlike Hillel, Israel ben Eliezer "was a ba'al shem par excellence, offering the promise of collective security for the en- tire House of Israel and not just magical defense for individuals or his own com- munity."161 Perhaps due to this strong commitment to the mystical, communal, and salvific-which we do not find in SH-Israel ben Eliezer became a charismatic personality, a sedentary ba'al shem supported by the community, and eventually, in the hasidic memory, the founder of the movement. This appraisal of the Besht has been further substantiated by the career of Hillel, who apparently never tried to transform magic, failed to establish himself in a Jewish community, and fell into oblivion. Yohanan Petrovsky-Shtern, Northwestern University Evanston, Illinois 161. Rosman, Founder of Hasidism, 181. Rosman is right arguing that "[t]his was apparently one of the features of his activity that singled him out as a ba'al shem par excellence."
