Gallup Biokinetics and Associates Ltd. ABSTRACT A Seat Belt Fit Test Device was developed to enable the measurement of belt fit of any vehicle seat/belt restraint system. A summary of the early development of this device is presented here with the results of more recent work. Belt fit measurements for human subjects is compared to measurements obtained with the Belt Fit Test Device. Recommendations are made for further validation testing. Finally, the regulatory potential of the belt test device is considered in terms of present Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations. THE BELT FIT TEST DEVICE was developed to provide a quantitative measure of belt fit. This new device is based on the SAE Standard three-dimensional H-point machine. The following paper describes the developmental history of the belt deployment test device, recent refinements, the results of recent validation testing, and the relevance of the device to Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Regulations. Abdominal injuries to restrained occupants of automobiles in collisions are not a frequent occurrence. When abdominal injuries do occur, however, they are often severe (1-4). The mechanism of such injuries is attributed to either submarining (5-8) or simply misdeployment of the belt over the iliac spines prior to collision. In an analysis of data collected by Transport Canada's field accident investigation teams, Gallup et al described poor initial belt deployment as the major contributory factor of serious abdominal injuries sustained by a sample of front and rear car seat occupants (9, 10). Efforts to date to minimize the likelihood of the seat belt impinging upon the abdomen have largely focused on the reduction of belt slack through the use of belt webbing retractors. The use of load sensors above the pelvis of an anthropomorphic test dummy to assess abdominal injury potential in a dynamic test environment has also been suggested and is the subject of on-going research. Very little consideration has been given, however, to the more fundamental issue of what, quantitatively, constitutes proper belt fit or to the means by which the quality of belt fit can actually be measured in an in-vehicle test. Belt restraint systems are designed to reduce the likelihood of occupant contact with the interior of the vehicle and to prevent ejection during impact. To prevent seat belt induced injuries to the internal organs of the body, the belts should be located over strong bony features. In particular, the lap belt should be located over the pelvis bone, below the iliac crests, and not impinge on the soft abdominal viscera. The Belt Fit Test Device, BTD, was developed to enable the measurement of belt fit of any vehicle seat/belt system. EARLY DEVELOPMENT The early development of the BTD is described in detail by Newman et al (11). A brief summary of the pertinent points is presented here with an update of recent developments. As the most promising design concept, the standard 3-dimensional H-point machine was utilized as the base for the BTD. Initially, a pelvic shape or lap form was designed as an add- on device for use in lap belt fit measurements, whilst retaining the capability of normal H- 1.1415 0096-736X/88/9601 -1 41 5$02.50 Copyright 1 988 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">point machine operations. The pelvic shape was determined from anthropometric data for Canadian, British and U.S. military and civilian populations. Scales were marked on the moulded lap form in a longitudinal direction, relative to the thighs, through the left and right ASIS. The scales were marked in 0.5cm increments, negative and positive respectively above and below an origin approximating the location of the anterior superior iliac spines of a 50th percentile Canadian person. It was determined that the hip angle quadrant, buttock weights, back angle quadrant, back angle level and headroom probe would interfere with any lap form, as would the standard seat pan. Since the design strategy was to retain the capability of a normal H-point machine operation, these components were removed and new components were fabricated to support the back pan and to locate the buttock weights. The new components were used to convert an H-point machine to the first prototype belt deployment test device. INITIAL EVALUATION To evaluate the performance of the BTD, belt fit was determined for six human subjects and compared to the BTD measurements in 11 vehicle configurations. The results are summarized in Figure 1. The total belt fit score was the sum of the 4 mean BTD measurements, i.e. inboard and outboard lap belt scores with the front seat in the foremost and rearmost position. The BTD measurements show a similar trend to the belt fit scores of the human subjects. ' - - - - Human Subj.oŁ. (-1. 57 Ov.r-aga) ! V BDTD (-3. 39 ov.ra3.) l ì X N. X» li !

To address these problems, a torso shape representative of an average adult was developed. A measurement scale, comprising a vertical and horizontal line from the top central position of the manubrium was fixed to the torso form as a potential means of quantifying torso belt fit. To date, no comprehensive analysis of the upper torso belt fit has been undertaken. The original prototype lap form cracked during preliminary evaluation tests. To increase durability, a new lap form was fabricated using a high strength aluminum alloy with a chromium surface finish. During initial tests, it was noted that certain inboard seat belt buckle stanchions fouled with the bottom edge of the BTD seat back pan. The interaction of the inboard seat belt unit with the backpan prevented the seat belt adopting its normal position. The bottom corners of the back pan were cut away to alleviate this problem. The capability of normal H-point machine operation has been retained. The H-point position does not show significant difference when determined with the BTD or the H-point machine. The new BTD in its test environment is illustrated in Figure 2. MEASURING PROCEDURES The purpose of the BTD is to enable the measurement of lap belt fit of any belt restraint system in a range of passenger cars. To this end, the original BTD measuring procedures were refined and formalized to ensure that different investigators could reliably use the BTD in a repeatable and consistent fashion in the full range of car seat/restraint systems. Using the refined procedures, overall repeatability for the lap belt scores was good with an average standard deviation of 0.54 for measurements taken by 3 investigators of 6 different belt restraint systems. Torso belt scores showed greater variation both during individual trials and between investigators. An average standard deviation of 1.0 was recorded for torso belt measurements of 4 different seat/belt systems. The main problem seems to lie in the non-continuous shape of the torso form. On some occasions, the torso belt 'snags' on the pectoral muscle shapes. As there is no indication that this relatively small torso belt position shift affects lap belt geometry, the repeatability of the BTD kits was considered good in terms of the original design criteria. The formalization of the measuring procedures, however, resulted in BTD scores 1.1416</page><page sequence="3">870327 FIGURE 2: THE REFINED BTD UNDERGOING MEASUREMENT IN A SIMULATED VEHICLE different from those reported with the first prototype BTD. The difference was most pronounced for torso/lap belt systems and reflected a higher positioning of the lap belt on the BTD pelvic shape. ONGOING DEVELOPMENTS As part of the on-going BTD development work, six kits to convert a standard SAE H-point machine to a BTD have been produced. These kits were prepared for review and assessment by car manufacturers and other interested groups. The six kits have demonstrated good reproducibility for the lap forms with an overall difference in average scores no greater than 0.5 cm. Belt scores for the upper torso forms showed greater variation. The greatest difference between means was 1 cm which was recorded for the sternum score in the foremost seating position. One manufacturing problem, namely the difficulty of etching on the multi-curved lap forms resulted in misalignment of the lap form scales. The origins were moved approximately 1 cm below their original position, and the negative and positive scales did not always meet. In the worst case, there was a gap of 3.5 mm between the two scales. It is anticipated that the use of a continuous scale and more rigorous alignment procedures will rectify this problem in future kit fabrication. COMPARISON OF PRESENT BTD WITH PREVIOUS DATA Direct comparison of the results of the present study with the previous BTD data is difficult. The refinements to the BTD, in particular, the positioning of the etched scales on the lap form and changes in procedure have caused a change in belt fit scores. HUMAN SUBJECT MEASUREMENT The refined BTD was used to measure belt fit scores in a range of vehicles. Belt fit measurements were made in both front and rear passenger car seats. As a comparison belt fit was also determined for two human subjects approximating average body types. Subject one was a female, 170.2 cm tall, weighing 54.5 kg. Subject two was male, 179.5 cm tall, weighing 77.3 kg. The body type of the male subject approximated a 50th percentile male in accordance with U.S. anthropometric 1.1417</page><page sequence="4">measurements. Each subject fitted and secured the belt themselves. In accordance with BTD procedures, a total of 12 measurements were taken with the front seat alternately in the rearmost and foremost position. The lap belt position on the human subjects was determined from the position of the subject's ASIS to the top of the belt. Measurements followed the profile of the subject's lap. Any measurements above the ASIS were recorded as negative and values below the ASIS were recorded as positive. This was to conform to the scales on the BTD. The lap belt fit measurements using the BTD were determined from the position of the top of the belt relative to the origin of the lap form scales. If the top of the belt went off the scales, i.e. more than 6 cm from the origin, a maximum score of negative 6 was recorded. RESULTS OF HUMAN SUBJECT MEASUREMENTS Belt fit was determined with the two human subjects and the BTD in eleven front car passenger seats and nine rear seats. The results of this testing are presented in Figures 3 and 4. Complete scores are given in Tables 1 and 2. Mean scores were employed for comparative purposes. The BTD scores have been corrected by positive 1 cm to adjust for the scale misalignment on the prototype BTD. The overall trends of the belt fit scores measured with the BTD are the same as those for the human subjects with one exception, the front seat of vehicle number 10. In this vehicle, the BTD score was acceptable with the seat positioned in the rearmost position. In the foremost position, however, the lap belt slipped off the top of the lap form, resulting in a maximum negative 6 value, indicating poor belt geometry. In contrast the human subject measurements indicated good belt geometry in both seating positions. The human subjects appear to be more accommodating of the limited leg space than the BTD. Further testing, however, is essential. Excluding those vehicles which allowed the belt to slip off the lap form, the differences between the BTD and subject one for any given score was 3.7 cm for the front seat and 3.5 cm for the rear seat. This contrasts with test results with the first prototype BTD in which the BTD scores and human subject measurements were similar. This could be due to the body type differences of the test subjects, formalization of the measuring procedures, the addition of a torso shape and changes to both the shape and coefficient of friction of the lap form. The presence of soft tissue (and clothing) on the human subjects is not reproduced by the BTD. To examine human subject variance, measurements were taken with a sonic digitizer on six human subjects to evaluate the fit of three simulated restraint systems. The scores represent linear distances from the top of the belt to the ASIS, determined by palpation. The differences in any individual mean score between the foremost and rearmost seating positions varied between 3.4 cm and 14.4 cm for any one vehicle. The wide range of scores is an indication of the diversity in the ASIS location of human subjects. This diversity results from differences in obesity, sex, shape of the iliac spines and seated position of the pelvis. A program to evaluate a wide range of vehicles with a larger sample of human subjects is indicated. In five of the seats, the secured belt buckle rested on the pelvis of the human test subjects. This is considered an undesirable and hazardous feature. In these same vehicles, the buckle rested directly over the scales of the BTD, thereby identifying the same event. REGULATORY POTENTIAL The geometric design of seat belts has been regulated in the past by establishing zones into which a manufacturer must place seat belt anchorages. In addition, the angle at which a lap belt rests on a simulated occupant has been controlled. These are very broad restrictions on design and would only result in eliminating the most ineffective designs. Restraint system effectiveness involves seat design and location as well as belt geometry. Regulating by anchorage location also tends to be highly restrictive. Efforts to maintain safety while promoting improvements in comfort and convenience are impractical. For example, requiring that the ends of a seat belt be accessible could result in retainers which cause the belt to be deployed across the stomach. A restraint system designer requires as much flexibility as possible to accommodate the large selection of occupant spaces encountered in the modern automobile and the diversity of seat belt components available. At the same time, improvements in seat belt wearing rates and the desire to encourage this trend, dictates an increased emphasis on the comfort and convenience of seat belts. More sophisticated test devices require greater control over the placement of the upper torso belt if measurements of chest deflection are to be meaningful. The ability to maximize seat belt safety by improvements in fit is of great concern to government and industry. Clearly, a better method of measuring and controlling seat belt fit would benefit everyone concerned with automotive safety. The development of the belt fit device is one result of a larger effort to develop better criteria for assessing the effectiveness of restraint systems. The seat belt wearing rate in Canada has been and continues to be sufficiently high to 1.1418</page><page sequence="5">870327 MEAN BELT SCORE 6 r BTD CORRECTED 5 1 MEAN SCORE O 4 - SUBJECT 1 V.Î ° a 1 - A Û ° A SUBJECT 2 ° • ° H ū A A -2: - "3: 0 o 0 o -4 - A a -5 - _g [_J 1 1 1 1 1 ý è è - 1 23456789 VEHICLE FIGURE 3: BTD AND HUMAN MEAN BELT FIT SCORES IN 9 VEHICLES (REAR SEAT) MEAN BELT SCORE 6 r BTD CORRECTED MEAN SCORE 5 - O 4 - SUBJECT 1 3 - o ■ A 2 - û a 1 - A SUBJECT 2 .

It has not been considered necessary to require automatic occupant protection. Methods to improve active three- point seat belts are of great interest to road safety experts in Canada. It has also not been considered wise to relax the anchorage location requirements of CMVSS 210 to allow the increased design flexibility necessary for automatic seat belts. Some means must be retained to ensure that seat belt systems, active or automatic, are designed to meet fundamental geometric fit considerations. It is possible that the belt fit device could provide the tool to adequately control belt geometry, ensuring that active or automatic seat belts fit the vehicle occupant in a safe and comfortable way. The belt fit device allows a repeatable, quantitative measurement to be taken regarding the fit of both the pelvic and torso portions of a seat belt. Users have found that familiarity with the device builds confidence in its discriminatory capability and it has been shown to be vastly more consistent than human subjects in assessing belt geometry. The device is relatively simple to use and measurements of one vehicle per hour in two seating positions by two technicians are possible. Further experience with a wide range of vehicles must be gained and some further validation is necessary, but the primary effort now will be in the direction of establishing reasonable safety criteria. As a measuring tool, the device needs only minor refinements. A measure of torso belt fit is relative to the mechanical load-bearing ability of the chest structure and clavicle. The belt should cross the centerline of the sternum at some point below a mid-clavicle line and above the bottom of the sternum. The belt should touch a mid- clavicle line sufficiently far from center to prevent loading the neck and yet still remain on the clavicle. It must touch the line to allow early loading in a crash event. To define these limits for a sufficiently large segment of the population and to determine if the measurements taken on the device can be interpreted for more than the average Canadian which it represents will require further work. A measure of lap belt fit is relative to the location of the ASIS, the shape of the iliac spine and the ability of the pelvic structure to accept loads in certain directions. The top of the belt should pass below the ASIS and no hardware should be located over an ASIS. Relating these statements, which are evidently true for a human, to the representative device presents possibly more uncertainty than in the case of the torso belt. Humans have soft tissue instead of the aluminum lap form. The position and shape of the ASIS shows wide variation in humans. This is evident by the measurements taken of the two different human subjects. Limits which may ensure an adequate fit for the average body shape may not sufficiently protect the wide variations found in the general population. However, indications are that the device is conservative on the side of safety and that highly effective criteria will be established to assist designers in developing safe seat belt systems. SUMMARY In terms of the present work certain points have been demonstrated. 1. The wide range of belt fit scores is undoubtably representative of the variation in belt geometry which is experienced in the real world. 2. The extreme variation in belt fit scores for the human subjects highlights the need for a device to quantify belt fit in a repeatable and reliable manner, and thereby identify belt systems which would encourage correct belt deployment. 3. Six complete BTD kits have been fabricated for evaluation by car manufacturers and other interested groups. The reproducibility of the six kits has been demonstrated. 4. The repeatability of the lap belt fit scores obtained during individual trials and for different investigators is good. 5. No in-depth work has been undertaken in evaluating the chest scores, however, preliminary work indicates that criteria can be developed to ensure torso belt deployment is near the mid sternum location and is not off the shoulder or on the neck. It may be possible to ensure the upper anchorage location does not result in excessive torso movement. 6. The BTD must undergo further ver if ication/calibration testing. REFERENCES 1.
