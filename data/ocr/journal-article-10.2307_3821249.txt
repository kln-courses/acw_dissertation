<plain_text><page sequence="1">Realizing the Sacred: Power and Meaning in Chinua Achebe's Arrow of God Mark Mathuray Sidney Sussex College, University of Cambridge Like nationalist discourses, African literary criticism revolves around the question of authenticity. The distinctiveness of the African text and its distance from or subversion of European literary forms consti- tutes, it seems, its authentic quality. Thus, the "Africanness" ofthe African text is elaborated and celebrated through positing its appropriation of, on the one hand, the oral tradition, both in terms of form and content, and on the other, myth and ritual. Within African literary criticism, these considerations often provide the impetus for political judgments, prescrip- tive and proscriptive. This ideological move establishes the primacy of the political in the discipline. This is not surprising as African postcolonial cultural praxis has, from its beginning, allied itself in varied ways to the process of decolonization and social critique. The relation between the text and the world was pre-eminent. Writers like Chinua Achebe, Wole Soyinka, Ngugi wa Thiong'o, and Ayi Kwei Armah engaged with the extratextual world through different narrative strategies that were often oppositional and disjunctive. If we agree with Jonathan Culler that "the novel serves as the model by which society conceives of itself, the discourse through which it articulates the world" (189), then the African world presented to us was one rent by conflicts and contradictions: the scatological and the sublime, the demonic and the utopian, the mythical and the historical. Yet, at the same time it was also a world of profound unity. In both the "mythical" and "realist" writers, early postcolonial literary production aims towards a sense of totality?an idea of the interconnectedness of the African world. In dealing with the political imperative, Chinua Achebe employs a strategy of metonymic recuperation, of substituting his specific traditional framework for an elaboration of African culture in the pan-Africanist agenda. He mobilizes Igbo history and culture to articulate the upheav- als and dislocations of colonial and postcolonial existence. Implicit in this procedure is the belief in the unity and certain homogeneity, both political and metaphysical, of Africa. Similarly, Wole Soyinka offers Yoruba myths as a basis for the understanding of African religious, political, and philosophi? cal thought and practice. This "primal phenomenon" posits a cosmological order in which "man exists in a cosmic totality" (3). The reciprocal porosity of the natural, social, and supernatural spheres derives from an animistic religious framework. Soyinka's appropriation of the term "myth" and its institutionalization through his theoretical writings have come to deter- mine the terms in which his work and those who share similar aesthetic strategies have been analyzed. "Myth," which minimally refers to a narrative about gods or mythic per- sonalities, in common usage, often indicates error, fiction, make-believe, Research in African Literatures Vol. 34, No. 3 Fall 2003: 46-65</page><page sequence="2">Mark Mathuray 47 and superstition. The co-incidence of myth and falsity may be traced back to a Platonic privileging of reason over narrative, transcendent truth over myth. Plato warns the citizens of the Republic that "pleasure and pain will be enthroned in your city instead of law and the principles which the com? munity accepts as best in any given situation," if they fall under the spell of myth (74). In his conceptualization, myth and narrative are opposed to rationality and truth. The dominant strand in African literary criticism that opposes myth to truth, be it historical or political, partakes of a movement that began with the birth of Western metaphysics and, as Jean-Pierre Ver- nant explains, is specific to Western thought: "The concept of myth that we have inherited from the Greeks belongs, by reason of its origins and history, to a tradition of thought peculiar to Western Civilization in which myth is defined in terms of what is not myth, being opposed to reality (myth is fiction) and, secondly, to what is rational (myth is absurd)" (186). This con- ception inaugurated in classical Antiquity "became clearly defined through the setting up of an opposition between mythos and logos, henceforth seen as separate and contrasting terms" (187). For Vernant, this opposition between mythos and logos came to dominate the various attempts to con- ceptualize myth. Myth, for Soyinka, however, is both real and rational. The "primal reality" that is myth is not a regression into a subconscious world of fantasy but rather the "essentialization of a rational world-view, one which is elicited from the reality of social and natural experience and from the integrated reality of racial myth, into a living reality" (34). "Myth," there? fore, is a problematic term to house the process representing this complex African reality, at least in its conceptualization within the Western episteme. Although modernity, as Max Weber would have it, has completed the pro? cess of disenchanting the Western world that began with Greek speculative philosophy, the recent history of the term from the Romantics to the Mod? ernists has tended to invert the hierarchization of mythos and logos. The modernism associated with T. S. Eliot has accorded myth the perspective of transcendence, perfection and order. Myth, for Eliot, is opposed to "the immense panorama of futility and anarchy which is contemporary history" (177); it is an escape from history. Soyinka's positing ofthe mythical as an ideal order and his privileging of the mythical method to the narrative method seem to derive from Eliot's modernist articulation of the mythical, and is necessarily implicated in the abrogation of history. However, we have noted that Soyinka's "mythical" is also inextricably linked to the "historical." This suggests that Soyinka's view may be associated with the ancient Greeks, for whom myth was foremost a religious epiphenomenon. This allusion to the ancient Greeks serves to introduce what was central to their religious symbolic order, and it is that which I will tentatively and provisionally offer as an alternate category to the "mythical," i.e., the idea of the sacred. The mythical will however not be abandoned but will be used in a very specific manner, in its reference to narratives of divinity. Emile Benveniste identifies two words in Latin that denote the idea of the sacred: sacer (which corresponds to the Greek hieros) is a thing or person consecrated to the gods; and sanctus (the Greek hagios) applies to a person who as a result of the attribution of divine favor, possesses a quality that</page><page sequence="3">48 Research in African Literatures raises him above other men. However, sacer has an ambiguous character. Not only is homo sacer animated by a divine force, he is also affected with "an ineradicable pollution." He is both "august and accursed, worthy of veneration and evoking horror" (Benveniste 452). Sacer incorporates both the mythic hero and the sacrificial victim. Mary Douglas observes that there is "little difference between sacredness and uncleanness" (3) and Mircea Eliade notes that the sacred is at once sacred and defiled (15). Therefore, divine energy, e.g., the Polynesian mana, which can be both sanctifying and polluting, is associated with danger. This association includes those invested with divine favor, i.e., the pure is also absolutely impure. Martin Heidegger writes of the sacred that it is "the violence of chaos that offers no pause, the terror ofthe immediate that thwarts all access" (cited in Hill 89). The sacred presents the universe as a mysterium tremendum, dreadful and ambiguous. The sacred is also intimately related to power. The noumen, Dudley Young points out, derives from neu, the Greek word for nod?the nod of the god that "unleashes power that brings order or disorder" (313). The sacred, then, establishes the gods' sovereignty over the domain of power and demands mortals' submission to the will of the gods. Within this sym? bolic framework, the gods can act as destroyers or preservers. However, Karl Kerenyi reminds us, as Johannes Kleinstuck argues, that for the ancient Greeks and Romans, submission to the power of the gods did not mean a blind belief in or willing submission to the will of the gods; they were as much antagonists to the gods as dependents. The anthropomorphic nature of the gods means that antagonism, rivalry, and conflict between the gods themselves and between gods and humans define the ambit of the mythic narratives of ancient Greek religious thought. By proposing the use of the term "sacred" to analyze what was previously termed the "mythical" in Achebe's Arrow of God, I wish to preserve both the religious charge of the mythical and the original ambiguity of the sacred as both divine and defiled, as evoking horror and reverence, as that which animates and that which puts to death {sacer-sacrificium). I aim to show that, as both a moral and cognitive category, the sacred, in those societies determined by it, places a structure of indeterminacy at the heart of political and epistemologi- cal questions. The idea of a god who saves and destroys (like Soyinka's paradigmatic essence, Ogun) is central to Achebe's rendering of Ulu, the chief deity and protector of Umuaro in Arrow of God. Ezeulu, his chief priest, asks the assembly of elders: "Is there any man or woman in Umuaro who does not know Ulu, the deity that destroys a man when his life is sweetest to him?" (Arrow 27). Moreover, in an essay on the significance of chi to Igbo religious thought, Achebe writes that "a man may worship Ogwugwu to perfection and yet be killed by Udo" {Morning94), pointing to both the sovereignty and inscrutability ofthe motives ofthe deities. However, the primary concern of this paper, the articulation ofthe sacred, will not be explored by proceeding to identify the traces of myth per se and mythic personalities in the text. Rather, I seek to interrogate the conceptual underpinnings ofthe symbolic order ofthe world created by the text, i.e., the political and epistemological implications ofa specific articulation ofthe sacred.</page><page sequence="4">Mark Mathuray 49 Chinua Achebe's Arrow of God has drawn much critical attention, per? haps the most of all his novels. Interpretive activity seems to flounder in the face of the preponderance of the representation of myth, ritual and religious beliefs and practices in the realist novel. In dealing with the ques? tion of power, there is a tendency to foreground both "the colonial factor" and the opposition ofthe power-hungry individual to his "republican" soci? ety. Focusing on the resultant conflict from the cultural contact between Igbo traditional society and the colonial authority, Emmanuel Obiechina argues that Nwaka is able to subvert Ezeulu's power because "the colonial authority has taken away from the traditional authority and the peoples the right to exercise judicial or even non-legal violence. The exercise of judicial coercion and violence belongs solely to the colonial regime from now onwards" (235). David Carroll, C. L. Innes, and Simon Gikandi hold, to a greater or lesser extent, to this view. The assumption that underlies their readings is the Weberian-derived specification of power and political community as necessarily coercive and violent. Through a consideration of South American "stateless" societies, Pierre Clastres argues that it is pos? sible for societies to exist and develop without a division between coercers and coerced structuring the sphere of the political (4). Notwithstanding a certain idealization involved in Clastres's argument, it does problematize a reading centralizing a conceptualization of power that is appropriate only to the modern European state, thus allowing us to read more critically a novel principally concerned with elaborating the religious and political dimension of an "acephalous" society. Moreover, in Arrow of God, it is this particular approach to power that informs the colonial characterization of Igbo society as lacking in "natural rulers," which becomes the justification for instituting warrant chieftaincy; an approach that Achebe is at pains to destabilize. Another strategy in critical analyses of Arrow of God attempts to deal directly with the sacred elements in the text. Representative of this tendency is Gikandi's reading that suppresses the mythico-religious dimension ofthe text by claiming that "the conflicts in Umuaro are not a rivalry between two gods Ulu and Idemili" but "actually a struggle between two conflicting ideological interests and authorities," represented by Nwaka and Ezeulu {Reading the African Novel 153). Following Roland Barthes, he posits myth and ideology as coincidental myth, and suggests the need to historicize myth because they "become instruments of domination when historical events are presented as manifestations of an ahistorical and natural order" (154). However Barthes, contra Gikandi, makes an important distinction between ritual and ideology/myth. Ritual emphasizes its own artificiality (its arbitrariness) rather than concealing it behind an appearance of natu- ralness {Mythologies 95-97). This distinction is fundamental for any critique of a novel that abounds in painstakingly detailed descriptions of events consecrated and regulated through ritual activity. On the question of meaning, Simon Gikandi's analyses share with almost every other reading a preoccupation with the 'crisis of meaning' in the novel, what G. D. Killam in an early analysis called "the problem of knowing" (60). Gikandi notes that Ezeulu's "drive for monological mean? ings" is opposed to "the plurality of perspectives insisted on by the novel</page><page sequence="5">50 Research in African Literatures and the authorial representation of traditional Igbo system of knowledge" {Reading Chinua Achebe 57-59; emphasis added). Critics attribute this her- meneutical indeterminacy, in every instance, to authorial intentionality. For example, David Carroll claims that Achebe is "unwilling to commit him? self finally on the precise relationship between inner and outer, between Ezeulu's need for power and the god he worships" (123). On the one hand, this argument reveals a belief in the transparency ofthe realist text to offer itself up with interpretive ease, for it suggests that it is authorial intervention that deliberately creates this indeterminacy. On the other hand, it betrays a refusal on the part of the critics to relate this "crisis of meaning" to the symbolic order of a society regulated by the sacred. By treating myth as ideology, and by raising the fallacy of intentionality, the readings occlude the ambivalences and antinomies of the sacred. In S/Z, Roland Barthes argues that antithesis is the most stable figure in the art of rhetoric: "Its apparent function is to consecrate (and domesticate) by a name, by a metalinguistic object, the division between opposites and the very irreducibility of this division" (26-27). Ofthe five "codes" ofthe text, under which all textual signifiers are grouped, the symbolic is based on antithesis, which allows for "a whole space of substitution and variation" to be opened up (127).! These oppositions are "separated by the most inflexible of barriers: that of meaning" and it is precisely this barrier that is exploited by the text?exposing, manipulating and transgressing it. This manifestation and deployment ofthe play of signification draws attention to the symbolic processes of "condensation" ("the paroxysm of transgression") and "transference." For Claude Levi-Strauss, these processes involve the opposition and conjuncture of terms by a shared quality, which is followed by a redeployment of their oppositionality in relation to the shared quality, signifying either its absence or presence. Levi-Strauss is keen to demon- strate that the principal opposition in any symbolic system is that between nature and culture, and it is this opposition that brings to a halt both the movement ofthe narrative and the potentialities of metaphor (28). This privileging ofthe systemic denies the dynamics of narrative and as Jacques Derrida (291) has pointed out, continues the project of Western metaphys- ics, i.e., the abrogation of mythos in favor ofa logocentricism. Therefore, I suggest that a consideration ofthe deployment of antithesis in literary texts must not only involve the structuralist assertion that meaning is generated not through the terms themselves but by their relationality, but must also engage the processes by which these oppositions are generated by the nar? rative; more specifically, how they function to institute crises that propel the flow of events. This approach seeks to de-prioritize the symbolic insofar as its meanings are inextricably linked to the logic of narrative, although not fully exhausted by it. Like Things Fall Apart, Arrow of God charts the downfall of a figure of central importance to his society. In the novel, the temporal movement between co-ordinate elements along the temporal axis of the text, which corresponds to Barthes's proairetic code, is crossed both by the elaboration of specific oppositions organized around the principal antagonists of the chief priest and detailed descriptions of rituals, sacred or otherwise. Ofthe</page><page sequence="6">Mark Mathuray 51 latter, one may note a certain archival tendency in Achebe's "historical" texts?and in African literary realism in general?to collect, catalogue, and store within the realm of fiction those aspects of culture that have been obliterated or are under threat of being engulfed by the tides of history. As such, archival realism is a genre of loss. In European realism, these "digres- sions" and anecdotes, might be attributed to the signaling of the Veffet du reel, of constituting the realistic texture of the novel and assimilating it to the contingent details of reality itself. This affirmation of an objective refer- ent is always potentially refused in Achebe's texts as a result ofa disjuncture in the code through which narrator and reader are signified. The world that Achebe communicates is a world that is potentially alien or forever lost to the reader. Archival realism is, therefore, also a genre of alienation. Of the elaboration of symbolic oppositions in Arrow of God, one can note the pre-eminence of a continuity/change opposition, one that nar- rates both loss and alienation, specifying the ambit of archival realism. The symbolic code ofthe novel proceeds through a series of antagonisms: Winterbottom/Ezeulu (colonial power/traditional power); Nwaka/Ezeulu (political power/sacred power); John Goodcountry/Moses Unachukwu (desacralization/retaining the sacred); Oduche/Nwafo (conversion/fidelity). The left side of these oppositions represents change to the sociopolitical and religious framework of Umuaro and metonymically to actual Igbo society, while the right side asserts the importance of continuity. It must be remembered that although Ezeulu is open to change, he is ultimately inter- ested in preserving the religious order of his society. These oppositions may be translated jfozctfLevi-Srauss to an opposition between the prioritization of autochthony and its refusal. By focusing on the symbolic oppositions of the text, the relationship between power and the sacred makes itself more manifest. Ezeulu, as the chief priest of Umuaro, a confederacy of six villages, is central to his society. He mediates between Ulu, the deity who offers protection and security, and the clan; keeps the calendar; and calls and performs Umuaro's two main planting and harvesting festivals. As the axis of Umuaro's socioreligious relations, Ezeulu represents their collective soli- darity. His power over the lives of the people arises from his mediation of the forces of nature, which are also sources of destiny. The reciprocal poros- ity of the natural and supernatural, the visible and invisible, means that power in African social systems, as many anthropologists have suggested, is linked to the ability to access the supernatural realm through nature: "The exercise of political influence derives from access to and work upon the natural and supernatural spheres, both as source of power to control others and the legitimization of actions" (Arens and Karp xvii). Modern power, on the other hand, abrogates the supernatural. In fact, the condi? tion governing the possibility of modernity is the divorce of the political from the theological. The textual strategy of establishing antagonisms, around which differ? ent sets of values are elaborated, sets up Nwaka in a homologically similar position to Winterbottom. However, the narrative registers Nwaka as a more significant antagonist as it is his actions that propel, and to some extent</page><page sequence="7">52 Research in African Literatures determine, the teleology of the narrative. With the Okperi land dispute, it is his rhetorical prowess that convinces the council of elders and men of title (the ndichie) to set aside Ezeulu's advice twice, and his argument about the putative friendship between Winterbottom and Ezeulu, which brings about the "rite of passage" sequence in the text. Both instances are linked to significant moments in the text and the development of the narrative. The first, through analeptic narration, precipitates Ezeulu's separation of Ulu from the fate ofthe clan, i.e., he reveals a desire to set up Ulu above, beyond, and against the clan. The second facilitates, for Ezeulu, the identification of Nwaka's perspective with that of the clan. This identification provides the justification for Ezeulu's desire for revenge. Often, in critical analyses of Arrow of God, Nwaka's opposition to Ezeulu is seen as a commendable attempt to curb the autocratic impulses of the chief priest and Nwaka's insistence on the epistemological validity of a plurality of perspectives is admired (see Gikandi, Reading Chinua Achebe 70-71). In elaborating this opposition, Victor Turner's distinction between communitas and "structure" is helpful. Turner, in The Ritual Process: Structure and Anti-Structure, deploys Arnold Van Gennep's rites de passage, which are marked by three phases: separation, limen (or margin), and aggregation, to constitute the notion of communitas. Communitas is aligned to the limen, and opposed to "structure."2 "Liminal entities are neither here nor there; they are betwixt and between the position assigned and arrayed by law, custom, convention and ceremonial" (196). "Structure" relates to a model of society as differentiated, often hierarchical, and whose politico-legal positions are involved in forms of evaluation, of "separating men in terms of more or less" (96). Communitas is everywhere held to be sacred and is often regarded as dangerous and polluting, Turner argues, as a result of the threat unstruc- tured communitas represents to the maintenance of "structure" both in "stateless" societies and in more hierarchically organized ones. This can be seen as Turner's attempt to deal with the double value of the sacred along sociostructuralist lines. Although Turner's categories are important for my reading, a more detailed consideration of the opposition (and rela? tion) between "structure" and communitas reveals that Turner, rather than opposing structure to antistructure, as the title of his book suggests, dis- tinguishes rather between two types of structure, one hierarchical and the other egalitarian, thus restricting the radical potentiality of communitas. If power is understood as "the probability that one actor within a social relationship will be in a position to carry out his own will despite resistance, regardless of the basis on which the probability rests" and authority, as the acceptance of this process without reflection (Weber, Theory 152), then the problem of universalizing a Western-specific becomes apparent, in relation to Ezeulu. From the Weberian-derived specification, Ezeulu has neither power nor authority, as Nwaka is able to subvert his power through the ndichie. Turner's distinction between communitas and social "structure" proves more appropriate. Nwaka's speeches to the assembly of elders reveal a series of rhetorical moves that qualify the opposition of structure to com? munitas {Arrow 27-28). He often seeks to distinguish Ezeulu's religious func? tion from his political role: "The man who carries a deity is not a king. He</page><page sequence="8">Mark Mathuray 53 is there to perform the god's rituals and to carry sacrifice to him" {Arrow 27). This asserts the autonomy ofthe ndichie in the sphere ofthe political. This autonomy, if it is to be that, must oppose the claims of the sovereignty of the sacred. Another important strategy Nwaka employs is to oppose the personal to the sacred. By asserting that if a man says yes his chi also says yes {Arrow 28), Nwaka opposes and privileges free will to the determinism implied in the sovereignty of the sacred. Nwaka, who functions as a rep- resentative of "structure," opposes communitas, which demands humans' submission to the will of the gods, a will that is beyond the knowledge of mortals. The claims made on behalf of "structure" are properly ideological, as it aims to maintain the power of the differentiated ruling body. It is the threat to his position, as one ofthe wealthiest men and one ofthe two men with four titles, that motivates the attack against Ezeulu whose ascendancy would challenge his power. Nwaka's rhetoric, too, is problematized by the text as this rhetoric is also rhetoric for and about war. However, in the communitas/structure divide, Ezeulu is not unproblematically aligned in the text with communitas. Achebe says of Ezeulu that he has a sense for "ultimate things." This sense is registered in the narrative through Ezeulu's framing of the crises in Umuaro in apocalyptic terms. The clan's refusal to hear the "truth" represents for him "an augury of the world's ruin" {Arrow 7). Turner identifies the apocalyptic vision with communitas. Certain millenar- ian religious movements attempt to institutionalize communitas by opposing the structured inequality of their societies with an alternate form of social structure. This institutionalization is antithetical to the notion of communi? tas (111). Ezeulu likewise attempts, and this may be the crucial point in his downfall, to convert communitas, the radical potentiality of antistructure, into structure itself, to constitute the sacred as the unique bearer of truth, holding sway over the political. A consideration of the constitution of the ndichie reveals a more nuanced approach to the question of the sacred and power. In acephalous societies, Robert M. Wren notes, title investiture is an in-built mechanism preventing the excessive concentration of power in any single individual. Ozo, the first title of significance that a man took, not only entailed par- ticipation in communal deliberations but also an induction into mmo, the world of ancestors (Wren 57-59). The ndichie, the representative body ofthe clan, were made of "men" (we are told in Things Fall Apart that those without titles were regarded as agbala, women) and ancestors. This connection to the ancestors proclaims, "the divine authority ofthe Earth," the earth, Ani, being the home ofthe ancestors, guardian of moral values and protectress ofthe clan (Wren 61). The political function ofthe ndichie \s authorized by the religious. What Nwaka opposes in his rhetoric is not the religious and the political, but two different forms of divine authority, which structure the organization of power relations within "structure." Ezidemili, the chief priest of Idemili and mentor to Nwaka, specifies his relation to the earth and the structurally homologous position in which Ezeulu locates himself. Ezidemili says to Nwaka: "Idemili belongs to the sky and that is why I, his priest, cannot sit on bare earth. [. . .] And that is why when I die I am not buried in the earth, because the earth and the sky are</page><page sequence="9">54 Research in African Literatures two different things" {Arrow 41). In discussing the antipathy to rigid social structures in various African social systems, Dennis Duerden claims that an important distinction is made between that which is consecrated to the sky and that which is consecrated to the earth, which is both superior and senior to the former (55). This translates into a political philosophy that insists on the deference of the king to the will of the assembly of elders. In fact, Ezeulu fulfils the function of most kings south of the Sahara, as Duerden suggests: he fixes the calendar, foretells the seasons and is bearer of the sky spirit. As with most African kings, his closeness to the sources of sacred power means that he needs to be kept in check by the ndichie who assert both the authority of the clan and the earth. The social-structural- ist distinction between communitas and social structure, and the symbolic opposition within "structure" of those institutions consecrated to the sky and the earth (a theologico-political construct) provide the basis for a detailed interrogation of the function of the sacred in the text, and it specification of the limits of power. In the oppositions (symbolic and material) so far elaborated, Ezeulu transgresses the divide, e.g., both accepting change and being a representa- tive of continuity, and simultaneously participating in communitas and struc? ture. Both the institution of oppositions and its transgression finds their apotheosis in the central ritual of the novel, and it is through this ritual that Ezeulu's power is signified. For the Romans and throughout the Middle Ages, of central significance to political authority was the concept of auto- critas. Steven Lukes defines autocritas as signifying "the possession by some of some special status or quality or claim that added a compelling ground for trust and obedience" (642). This was often related to a founding act or sacred being. Autocritas, the basis for obligatory belief, is created through the rituals symbolizing the unity and the creation of that unity during the two major festivals in Umuaro?the festival of the Pumpkin Leaves and the feast ofthe NewYam. The festivals also have an instrumental function to produce the appropriate ritual conditions for planting and harvesting. During the Pumpkin Leaves ritual, "Ezeulu re-enacted the First Coming of Ulu and how each of the four Days put obstacles in his way" {Arrow 72). He re-enacts and relates to all of Umuaro his epic mythical journey where, having been called upon by the clan, he encounters, names, and offers sacrifices, to the four Days. In terms of mythic discourse, this represents a setting in order of the world, a process of classification, a naming of the world. Encounters with deities are fraught with peril for the mythic hero. As in most renewal ceremonies, the priest-king, by demonstrating his control over the encounter with the sacred, emerges as a source of power himself, legitimizing his exercise of power. This encounter with the sacred also necessarily pollutes the subject of the ritual. Hence, the epic heroism of Ezeulu's journey has as its counterpoint the pathos of his symbolic func? tion as scapegoat. By taking the place ofthe first victim that makes possible the creation of Ulu, Ezeulu cleanses the villagers of their sins before the planting season. Ezeulu races around the center of the marketplace as the women of Umuaro fling their pumpkin leaves, "containing" (in a magical manner) the sins of their household, at him.</page><page sequence="10">Mark Mathuray 55 This dual inscription of the sacred subject, as hero and victim, cor- relates closely with other African rituals of renewal and royal installation. Richard N. Henderson describes how the Onitsha Eze re-enacts both his installation and his funeral during his public appearances (298-304). Before each new yam festival, he must also prove himself guiltless of the deaths ofthe previous year, i.e., of not being a witch (396). T. O. Beidel- man describes how, as far south as Swaziland, the Swazi king is thought to annually regenerate the cosmos itself at the moment "that he takes on the filth ofthe nation on himself" (373). The ambiguities of Benveniste's onto-etymology of sacer become apparent. The double articulation ofthe sacred subject, glorified and accursed, venerated and despised, demands the creation of the subject and its destruction in the self-same moment. The ritual, in an important sense, is subjectless, or more precisely its sub? ject is the clan, the clan's social cohesion and functional unity, i.e., the sacred subject is effaced so that the clan may reveal itself to be the true subject. Throughout the narration of the Pumpkin Leaves ritual, Achebe constantly signifies the unity of Umuaro, whereas the preceding part ofthe text had emphasized the rivalries, conflicts, and disunity, among the six villages comprising Umuaro. The beat of the Ikolo becomes the heartbeat of the clan. The symbolic transference from the epic hero to sacrificial victim and back again manifests the danger that is often associated with the exercise of power within traditional African social systems. Divine power can either sanctify or pollute. Durkheim, in extending Robertson Smith's theorizing of the ambiguity of the sacred, argues that "the pure and the impure are not two separate genera but two varieties ofthe same genus that includes all sacred things" (306); the pure and impure transform into and substitute for one another. In political terms this translates into a distrust of power itself as power belongs to the realm of the divine and ambivalence to those who exercise power. Through his fieldwork on witchcraft among the Maka in southeast Cameroon, Peter Geschiere notes that "discourses on witchcraft reveal a profound distrust of power. They are subtended by the firm belief that all forms of power can easily degenerate" (133). This ambivalence is registered in the text through a number of semic and symbolic signifi- cances. The first articulates the belief that authorized power may degener? ate into its opposite. Before Ezeulu goes to visit a sick man, Akuebue warns him: "If you go there on your way home say nothing that might make them think you wish their kinsman evil" {Arrow 113). Implicit in this warning is the assumption that Ezeulu's power may be used for injurious action that is not sanctioned by the clan, action that would constitute him as a witch, like the Onitsha Eze in Henderson's study. Often Ezeulu's power is signified through the discourse of witchcraft. For the people of Okperi and Umuaro, Winterbottom's sudden illness is related to Ezeulu's power. The policemen who come to arrest him seek protection from a medicine man. He tells them that they had indeed "walked into the mouth of a leopard" {Arrow 158). This points to the aforementioned distinction between power within African social systems and the concept of power generated through Western modernity. Power, thus, is also closely aligned to witchcraft.</page><page sequence="11">56 Research in African Literatures Another level is generated through the process of symbolic condensa- tion. It is around ajoke that the ambivalences of sacred power coalesce. Nwaka, in pointing out that it is Ezeulu's friendship with Winterbottom that removes the district officer's summons from the involvement of the ndichie says, "It seems to me that Ezeulu has shaken hands with a man of white body." The narrator informs the reader "this brought low murmurs of applause and even some laughter. Like many potent things from which people shrunk in fear of leprosy is nearly always called by its more polite and appeasing name?white body" {Arrow 113-14). The symbolic co-inci- dence of the colonial and the leper through the relationship to whiteness has been foregrounded in the text through an emphatic symbolic transfer- ence and substitution of one for the other. The first time the white man is referred to in the text, outside the internally focalized episode of Ezeulu, is by Akukalia. He tells his companion of the white man: "It was once said that he had no toes." This creates a link with the figure of the leper. This figure represents the outcast, the marginal who, being diseased, is defiled and defiling. In Nwaka's recounting of his mythical journey in the place Beyond Knowing, he claims, "I made friends with a leper from whom even a prisoner flees" {Arrow 39). His power is manifested by his ability to assimilate the inassimilable. The Agaba, the mask that Obika's age-group presents to the clan, warns that those who ignored its advice would become outcasts with no fingers and toes, lepers {Arrow 199). The worst punishment imaginable within the symbolic order of the Umuaroans is to become like a leper. However, the leper, from Nwaka's account, is also socialized in the religious framework, and accords with Turner's communitas where the marginal represents the sacred and its powers. The power ofthe colonials, which is undisputed by the clan, is established through their destruction of Abame, through brute might. Translating this military power into sacred power, Moses Unachukwu claims: "The white man has a power which comes from the true God and it burns like fire" {Arrow 84). The symbolic conden- sation, therefore, ofthe white man and the leper symbolically links a power that burns like fire with sacred marginality. Akuebue describes Ezeulu: "He is tall as an iroko tree and his skin is white like the sun" {Arrow 153). Apart from the metaphorical implications of Ezeulu's connection with the sky ("tallness" and the sun) as opposed to the earth (see Duerden's argument above), this statement implicates Ezeulu in the symbolics of whiteness. Within the conceptual framework of communitas, and as sacrificial victim in the cleansing ritual, the chief priest's location within the symbolic order of the Igbo society depicted in the text is structurally the same as that ofthe leper. The symbol ofthe clan's unity and exclusiveness, Ezeulu, it has been noted, is central to their political and reli? gious relations. At the same time, the transgression of the divide between the sacred and secular through the symbolic enactment of sacrifice casts the chief priest as potentially polluting; hence his liminal status and isolation: But the heaviest load was on Ezeulu's mind. He was used to loneli- ness. As Chief Priest he had often walked alone in front of Umuaro. But without looking back he had always been able to hear the flute</page><page sequence="12">Mark Mathuray 57 and song, which shook the earth because it came from a multitude of voices and the stamping of countless feet. [...] But although he would not for any reason now see the present trend reversed he carried more punishment and more suffering than all his fellows {Arrow 218-19). His role as solitary leader is balanced by his function as scapegoat, or more precisely, he is leader because he is also the victim of the sacrificium. The dual articulation of the sacred invites a dialectical reading. In con- sidering the elaboration of the sacred in the text, one detects a separation and dispersal of the double value of sacer. On the one hand, the claims to leadership in the novel are articulated through narratives ofthe "mythical" journey; and on the other, the narrative registers sacrifice as its most signifi- cant structuring device. Various characters recount journeys into "foreign" lands, where they undergo certain ordeals and return communicating new strength to their societies. Soyinka describes the epic as arising from the need of mankind to confront and attempt to initiate a rapport with the immovable immensity, the realm of the supernatural, in which being is located (2). This unknowable void needs to be breached periodically by a human challenger who journeys to this "primal reality" and returns trium- phant with a moral code for that society. Nwaka parallels Ezeulu's mythic journey of the Pumpkin Leaves ritual in the land Beyond Knowing, where he confronts and befriends, a wizard, a poisoner, and a leper {Arrow 39). By asserting his power over these liminal and dangerous figures on the mythical plane, he legitimizes his claim to authority. Moses Unachukwu adopts the name of Moses because he sees his sojourn in Onitsha, where he is converted, as a parallel to the Old Testament Moses in Egypt. In this "alien" land he confronts the terror of colonial power: "The white man has a gun, a matchet, a bow and carries fire in his mouth" {Arrow 84). He returns to Umuaro and "protects" the people from the excessive zeal of his antagonist, John Goodcountry (who desires to desecrate the totemic animal; Unachukwu thus acts as liaison between the colonial authority and the clan. Achebe imbricates even religious conversion within the dynamics ofthe traditional epic and the processes ofthe rites of passage (separation, liminality and aggregation). Ezeulu also repeats his mythical journey ofthe ritual through his sepa? ration from Umuaro, his incarceration in Okperi, and his reintegration into the community. On his return, Ezeulu realizes that "it was right that the Chief Priest should go ahead and confront danger before it reached his people" {Arrow 189). Ezeulu's reintegration has a further significance. Where previously he desired to "wrestle" with his people, on his return, and for the first time in the narrative, he is able to separate the people of Umuaro (the clan itself) from his political adversaries (those representative of "structure"). "Ezeulu continued his division of Umuaro into ordinary people who had nothing but goodwill for him and those whose ambition sought to destroy the central unity of the six villages" {Arrow 187). This distinction that arises out of the awareness achieved after the "rite of pas? sage" sequence marks the important distinction between communitas (the</page><page sequence="13">58 Research in African Literatures clan) and "structure" (Nwaka's position), a distinction that Ezeulu both transgresses and initially confuses. In the communitas/structure divide, it is Akuebue that represents, in the text, the voice of the clan. Significantly, the clan speaks the language of the sacred. Akuebue warns Ezeulu: "And they [the clan] will say that you are betraying them again today by sending your son to join in desecrating the land" {Arrow 131; emphasis added). The structure of journey, ordeal, survival, and social or individual purgation places these episodes firmly within the ambit of the African tradition of the epic, which itself repeats the social category of rites of passage. It is, therefore, through the narrative of the epic and the structure of the rites of passage that authority is established, i.e., the concepts and processes that legitimize the exercise of power. The other series of repetitions in the narrative, which forms a counter- point to the "epic" chain, revolves around the invocation of effective sacri? fice. The crisis that confronts Umuaro, the upheaval caused by a radically altered state of affairs, is from the perspective ofthe central interpreter in the novel, Ezeulu, a sacrificial crisis. From his apocalyptic vision and from within the discourse of the sacred, the solution to the crisis is finding the appropriate sacrifice to set the world/cosmos in order again. Ezeulu explains to Akuebue why he sent Oduche to join the Christians: A disease that has never been seen before cannot be cured with everyday herbs. When we want to make a charm we look for the animal whose blood can match its power; if a chicken cannot do it we look for a goat or a ram, if that is not sufficient we send for a bull. But sometimes a bull does not suffice, then we must look for a human. {Arrow 133) The gradient of sacrificial value places plants at the lowest end and the human at the highest. The highest sacrifice is necessary when "they are pushed beyond the end of things." With the slave-raids of the Abame war- riors, the sacrifice of one of their own was necessary; the sacrifice that makes possible the creation of Ulu and whose position Ezeulu symbolically substitutes during the planting/cleansing ritual. Likewise, Ezeulu believes that sacrificing his son Oduche to the Christian god will protect Umuaro. However, the search for effective sacrifice is thwarted by a series of ritual lapses and desecrated sacrifices. A ritual lapse, as Durkheim points out, is always a threat to the collectivity, the collectivity that is sacred and moral. Ezeulu refuses to perform the appropriate propiatory rites after Oduche almost kills the totemic python, sacred to Idemili. The healer who performs Obika's bride's "covering-up" sacrifice does not sacrifice the hen, but makes off with it. At the presentation of the ancestral Mask, Obikwelu messes up the sacrifice of the ram. Wade, one of the colonial officers, desecrates a roadside sacrifice. This textual chain of inappropriate and desecrated sac? rifices parallels the deepening social crisis in Umuaro, the sense of things failing apart. When Ezeulu refuses to call the New Yam Festival at the expected time, the elders ask of Ulu: "Is there no sacrifice that would appease him?" This not only points to the clan's submission to the desire ofthe gods, but also to</page><page sequence="14">Mark Mathuray 59 the particular significance of sacrifice in establishing relations between the human and divine sphere. The sacrifice, Turner argues, is the "high spot" of the ritual, "where the visible and invisible components of the cosmic order interpenetrate and exchange qualities" {Drums 276). Turner argues further that in cyclical social systems, it is only through sacrifice that the develop? ment cycle can get going again. Thus, Arrow ofGod may be seen as a search for the appropriate sacrifice to facilitate the shift to a new cycle. In the Pumpkin Leaves ritual, Ezeulu functions as a symbolic sacrifice, taking on, as the scapegoat, the sins of Umuaro. Believing that his society is beyond the end of things, in that space outside temporal determinants, Ezeulu attempts to recuperate the figure of the victim through a metonymic displacement to Oduche, substituting his son for the role that is originally and crucially his. Through another act of metonymic displacement, the gods, it seems, substitute another of Ezeulu's sons, Obika, for the role of sacrificial victim. But it is at the New Yam feast, the festival that should inaugurate the new cycle and the New Year, that the sacrificial victim is absent. It is here that the text identifies the pre-eminence of Ezeulu's role as victim and, through the demands of narrative closure, accomplishes the fulfillment of that role. Narrative closure and the beginning of the new cycle are achieved through Ezeulu textually enacting his most significant function in Umuaro and the novel. The dialectical opposition of the dual series of epic heroism and sacrifice is superceded by the text's ritualistic closure, revealing the text's desire for ritual status. In the preface to the second edition of Arrow ofGod, Achebe writes: "For had he been spared Ezeulu might have come to see his fate as perfectly consistent with his high historic destiny as victim, con- secrating by his agony?thus raising to the stature of ritual passage?the defection of his people." The "triumph" ofthe Christian religion does not represent a rupture, a rending of the world; rather, the "defection" rein- forces the symbolic order of traditional Igbo (and African) society, through the formal "totality" of the text. This is achieved, it has been noted, through the text's sacrificing of Ezeulu, of not "sparing" him. Therefore, by revealing its desire for ritual closure, the text marks itself as always already inadequate, as necessarily narrating the loss of the immediacy of the ritual. In the central ritual of the text, Ezeulu relates and re-enacts both his roles as hero and scapegoat, i.e., through words and gestures he creates order and control (as hero) and expiation (as victim). In a fundamental sense, words in a ritual are perfor- mative. J. L Austin distinguishes between illocutionary and perlocutionary speech acts: the former performs what it says at the moment of its utterance, and the latter achieves its effects as a consequence of its utterance. In this "enactive" mode, speech, in the ritual, achieves pure mimesis, i.e., collapses the distinction between utterance and event, image and significance. Mean? ing, in the ritual, is always immanent and asserts both the power ofthe word and the primacy of language. A symbolic chain running through the text repeatedly substitutes a specification of power with the power of words, or metaphorically displaces this power to the "mouth." Nwaka's subversion of Ezeulu's authority succeeds partly, the narrator suggests, as a result of his rhetorical prowess, the perlocutionary force of his words. He is called the</page><page sequence="15">60 Research in African Literatures "Owner of Words." The white man, Moses Unachukwu claims, "carries fire in his mouth." Ezeulu proclaims his power over the white man: "If I did nothing else I would pronounce a few words on him and he would know the power of my mouth" {Arrow 99). Thus, power, sacred and political, is associated with the instrumentality of words. Their performativity and materiality derive from the enactive nature of words in the ritual context. The co-incidence of utterance and action, the self-presence ofthe subject (as the community) and the originary fullness of social unity in the ritual correspond to Lukacs's "social totality" (55). It is this totality, represented by Homeric Greece in Lukacs's account, which makes possible mimetic literature. In the era when mimetic literature becomes impossible, the successor of the epic, the novel, recuperates this social totality through its formal totality: "The novel is the epic of the age in which the extensive totality of life is no longer directly given, in which the immanence of meaning in life has become a problem, yet which still thinks in terms of totality" (Lukacs 56). The novel is ineluctably involved in narrating the loss ofthe social totality ofthe historico-philosophical reality ofthe epic. Strictly speaking, the subject ofthe epic can never be the indi? vidual: "Its theme is not a personal destiny but the destiny of the commu? nity" (Lukacs 66). This correlation ofthe "subjectless" organic totality with the sacred ritual reveals the Pumpkin Leaves ritual as the ultimate basis of Arrow of God. It holds the work together insofar as the text aspires for the immediacy and the immanence of meaning of the ritual. Arrow of God is a ritual writ large. Determined by its form, however, the realist novel, can only narrate the loss of this totality. Its hero always is already alienated from the world, an alienation that makes interiority the regulative idea of narration and the narrative biographical: "The gods are silent and neither sacrifice nor the ecstatic gifts of tongues can solve the riddle" (Lukacs 66). The African realist novel that attempts to recreate the "precolonial" past is a paradox, an impossible project. This is not the well-worn dictum ofthe impossibility of recuperating the past, but an assertion ofthe impos- sibility of actualizing/representing an organic totality within a form that necessarily excludes it. The depiction of the Pumpkin Leaves ritual also makes clear that it is not only through the sacred that the alienated interior- ized subject ofthe novel is destroyed, but that through the ritual he becomes the bearer of the destiny of his people, or more precisely the community becomes the subject; communitas is made manifest. Consequently, we see the dual inscription of Ezeulu's functions on both a symbolic and a formal level. Symbolically, he acts as epic hero and scapegoat. On the formal level he is the epic individual, the hero of the realist text, and epic hero, the bearer ofthe fate ofthe community. The latter duality manifests itself in the text's own ambivalence. In the first half ofthe novel, its mythical dimension subtends the rationalist-realist rhetoric ofthe text. The narrative is princi- pally focused around a "problematic individual," who wants to imprint his desires on the world; it is a narration of self-contemplation. The text holds open the possibility of rationalist interpretation; e.g., the significance of Winterbottom's sudden illness is left ambiguous:</page><page sequence="16">Mark Mathuray 61 Perhaps it was Captain Winterbottom's rage and frenzy that brought it on; perhaps his steward was right about its cause [Ezeu? lu's power]. But on the very morning when two policeman set out to arrest Ezeulu in Umuaro, Captain Winterbottom suddenly col- lapsed and went into a delirium. {Arrow 149) However, in the latter part of the novel, the hierarchy of the rationalist- realist and mythical is destabilized. The figure that had remained hidden for the most part ofthe novel reveals itself. The appearance of Ulujolts the realist mode ofthe text. This most literal deus ex machina breaks down the realistic verisimilitude that the text had tried to maintain and shifts the narrative to the mythic mode. It is this "magical realist" moment in the text that is also the moment of bifurcation in which the realist rhetoric of the alienated individual gives way to the mythical articulation of the subject. This moment, which poses a problem of classification, is resolved through thematic recuperation implied by the title of the novel. Titles, as Barthes points out {S/Z), tend to arrest the play of signification by organizing the novel in terms ofa specific theme. It would seem, therefore, that as an arrow of god, Ezeulu functions less as the interiorized and interiorizing subject than as a structural element in the mythical narrative. We, thus, have a divided text?the realist narrative comes up against its own impossibility, enacts its own demise, and gives way to the mythical imperative. This formal division resists the Lukacsian "totality," resulting in an alienated realism. At the end of the novel, Achebe offers the reader a series of possible interpretations for the outcome of the narrative, each relating to a differ? ent level ofthe narrative: unanswered and unanswerable questions leading to Ezeulu's madness; "an implacable assailant," one of the gods, Ulu or Idemili, had crushed him; or his demise reflects the fact that the wisdom of the clan is upheld?"no man however great was greater than his people; that no man ever won judgment against his clan" {Arrow 230). The latter two interpretations are oppositional and contradictory. The first may be related to the mythical battle of the gods in which Ezeulu is entirely innocent, and the second to the priority of communitas, the sacred over structure, in which Ezeulu is guilty of attempting to convert one into the other. However, by the narrational offering of a variety of meanings, the text reveals, apart from a desire for totality stemming from it, also a desire for meaning. Inasmuch as the exercise of power is delimited by the sacred, epistemological deter- minacy is also constrained by it. Ezeulu claims: "I can see things where other men are blind. That is why I am Known and at the same time I am Unknowable" {Arrow 132). The part that is unknowable even to himself is the spirit half of his being. The great tragedy of Ezeulu lies in his belief that he had access to this unknowable side. When the ancestral Mask, the Agaba, asks the chief priest if he knows who he is, Ezeulu replies, "How can a man know you who are beyond human knowledge?" {Arrow 199). The realm of the supernatural is essentially opaque, and as that realm is ultimately deter- minate of socioreligious relations in a society organized around the sacred, then this is necessarily a society that posits epistemological indeterminacy</page><page sequence="17">62 Research in African Literatures as the fundamental basis of its processes of the production of meaning. This is still relevant to the African postcolony. Adam Ashforth attempts to explicate the symbolic and political significance of Nkosi ya Manzi (Lord of the Waters) for a group of people living in a highly urbanized area in Soweto, South Africa. He suggests that the subjects possess a worldview in which an immense transcendental power exists that seems unconstrained by any ethical principle or anything resembling law; where the distinctions between private and public, natural and supernatural, are not respected; where there is a fundamental indeterminacy (the theological problem of "unknowing") in relation to unseen powers and their motives (39). Ash? forth therefore concludes that this openness to the transcendental leads to great spiritual insecurity and "epistemic anxiety" (68). These societies are thus also ones with an overabundance of meaning, which amounts to the same thing. A number of interpretations may be possible for any single event; these are not mutually exclusive as they refer to different levels of meaning. By offering a variety of meanings to the text, the narrator par- takes of the symbolic order of the world he has created. Yet this offering also divides the text from itself?a self-reflexive narrative that comments on itself and its own process of producing meaning. Arrow of God is not only divided in itself, but also from itself, producing a peculiarly modernist form of realism, a realism of alienation. It is through the central character that the text makes visible its own processes of the production of meaning. This does not refer to the often- noted opposition between a society that demands a plurality of perspec? tives and an individual who insists on a single meaning. Rather it points to the mirroring of the text's desire for totality, its attempts to give form and meaning to the experience it has organized, as the essence of its central personality. Ezeulu is therefore not a problematic individual because he insists on a single meaning; he is the force of Meaning itself. Meaning, Barthes, suggests is "a force that tries to subjugate other forces, other mean? ings of language itself" {S/Z 160). It is therefore both an act of violence and exclusion, of subjugation and brutal single-mindedness. Ezeulu is the philosopher and artist par excellence. He searches the skies for signs from the heavens and communicates their message to his people. He articulates Heidegger's "median space" that separates, while thereby connecting, gods and humans. He is the Lukacsian "seeker," testing and theorizing both the limits of knowledge and power. What was power if it could not be used? Could he discern the wishes of the gods? These are the two central ques- tions that he tests as the narrative unfolds. However, it is at the moment of the bifurcation of the narrative that the text problematizes Ezeulu's and its own quest for meaning. After being chastised by Ulu for his presumptu- ousness in the deus ex machina sequence, Ezeulu realizes that the "truth" of the crises of Umuaro had little to do with Umuaro and even less to do with Nwaka: "It was a fight of the gods. He was no more than an arrow in the bow of his god" {Arrow 192). He begins to retrospectively attribute meaning to a sequence of events: " [P]ast events took on a new and exciting significance" {Arrow 192). Oduche, the sacred python, and Winterbottom are all subjugated to the force of meaning; all events are abstracted and</page><page sequence="18">Mark Mathuray 63 made to serve a single pattern, a single meaning. Being the arrow of god, Meaning is revealed and structures the process of decoding meaning. Even if this borders on the sacrilegious, what Soyinka calls "religious treachery" (36): "Ezeulu was now in the mood to follow things through." The revela- tion of meaning analeptically and proleptically recuperates the entire text, arranging the proairetic sequence in a single indisputable symbolic order. Referring to the title ofthe novel, a pre-eminence is given to Ezeulu's inter? pretation. However, Ezeulu's demise destabilizes Meaning. It is the pursuit of meaning that the narrator provisionally offers as one of the possible meanings ofthe text: "Perhaps it was the constant, futile throbbing of those thoughts that finally left a crack in Ezeulu's mind" {Arrow 229). Violent and brutal, Meaning is also the voice of madness. Thus, Ezeulu is an assigned impossibility, the locus of incompatible processes. As the representative of the symbolic order of his community, he is the vector of indeterminacy, the abrogation of Meaning; in mirroring the process of writing he is the force of Meaning itself. Tragedy is the only possible outcome. Through a reading of Achebe's Arrow ofGod, I have attempted to make a case for the use of the concept of the sacred in the analysis of myth and ritual in African literary texts. This approach has been premised on the belief of the persistence of the sacred in contemporary African society, structuring and delimiting the sphere of political relations and epistemo? logical concerns. The double value of the sacred and its relative opacity places indeterminacy at the heart of these relations/concerns, an indeter? minacy that institutes a specific form of morality. Power and Meaning (both in capital letters) are placed outside the sphere of humans in the symbolic order ofthe sacred; thus the exercise of power and the search for meaning is always constrained by this belief. The concept of the sacred may prove invaluable to the analysis of "African" texts that deal with questions of power and meaning, which is another way of saying that it may prove crucial to the analysis of most of African cultural production. NOTES 1. The five codes described in S/Z form a topos through which the text "passes." It is a "mirage of structure," a structuration rather than a structure, Barthes suggests. The five codes are: the hermeneutic code (in which enigmas are posed and resolved); the symbolic code (which informs the reading of thematic concerns); the semic code (the elements related to character and that ofthe connotative signified); the proairetic code (action and events ofthe plot); and the cultural or referential code (defined by the extra-textual world's bodies of knowledge) (see Barthes, S/Z18-20). 2. Turner distinguishes communitas from "community." The Latin word implies a "modality of social relationship" rather than the more restrictive and particu? lar "area of common living" implied in community (96).</page><page sequence="19">64 Research in African Literatures WORKS CITED Achebe, Chinua.
