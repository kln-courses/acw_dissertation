From May 17 to August 15, 1988, the Mus&amp;e d'Orsay and Tokyo's Mus&amp;e National d'Art Occidental mounted a joint exhibit of some 452 works examining the impact of Japan on Western art in the late nineteenth century. After filling both floors of the Grand Palais with paintings, drawings, sculpture, decorative arts, architectural drawings and models, photographs, and costumes, the show moved on to Tokyo, leaving behind a large, scholarly, densely illustrated catalogue of markedly Japoniste design. Arranged after the tri-partite scheme repeated in the catalogue-Japanese ob- jects early available for viewing; the "exotic" vogue following Japan's opening to the West; the penetration of the Japoniste aesthetic that fueled the modernist movement in art-the entire exhibit was a mise en abyme of the ongoing dialogue</page><page sequence="2">388 FRENCH REVIEW between art history and the aesthetic evidence. Not all the confrontations were convincing, not all the Western Japoniste art works clearly the result of the posited cultural interpenetration. Not all, but so many that a retrospective tour of the catalogue makes a strong case for broadly reading all non-official art of the 1860s, '70s, '80s, '90s as a drive toward renewed vision largely shaped by the cleansing restructuring of space, the non-anthropomorphic attention to nature, the integra- tion of art-objects with function derived from Japanese art. The dates all hang together, from the opening of Japan to the West in the 1850s, to the arrival of Japanese objects, prints, books among the booty of commercial travelers and diplomat-collectors, to the blossoming of interest in Japan with the 1867 Exposition Universelle and the broad penetration of public taste in the Exposition of 1879. And the wave kept on growing, seeping into the very marrow of art nouveau in the 1890s and capped by the public showcase of the 1900 Exposition. Is all significant art of the early modernist period to some degree Japoniste? That is the siren song of this beautiful, absorbing book, more convincing than was the show itself. It is hard not to be seduced by what the eye takes in. Perhaps the very same seduction was exercised by things and "ideas" from Japan over Western artists faced with an exhausted tradition. How fresh, strong, liberating Hokusai, Yoshi- tora, Hiroshige looked compared to Carolus-Duran and Bouguergeau. Simple pa- vilions with straw mats and sliding walls; drawings with few, strong lines; the clear, bright colors of Japanese prints; clothing beautiful enough to hang on the walls; high-horizon compositions with spare, calligraphic foregrounds; genre episodes tucked into suggestive, limitless landscapes; a newly revealed world in which the artist's eye takes things as they appear to come, with a rhythm, grace, and sensual pleasure in pure vision that seemed the antithesis of narrative painting, grandilo- quent portraiture, tufted decoration, salon machines. A liberation waiting to happen, flicked into life by some lightly sketched flowers, insects, drifts of snow. Le Japonisme includes several splendid essays-Shuiji Takashina's "Problkmes du Japonisme," Akiko Mabuchi's "Japonisme et naturalisme"-as well as Genevieve Lacambre's masterful illustrated chronology of 100 years of cultural penetration, and a biographical directory of principal Japonisant Western artists and manufactur- ers. But the scholar/art-lover will be most moved by the catalogue's visual argu- ment. From the obvious exoticism of Monet's Japonnerie (Mme Monet in an incredible red kimono), through Japanese-style works such as Manet's portrait of Zola, to convincingly Japoniste images-Van Gogh's Pare Tanguy, Gauguin's Belle Angele, Bonnard's screen with rabbits, Lacombe's Marine bleue painted on tile (the exhibition's poster icon), Riviere's Trente-six vues de la tour Eiffel (in the spirit of Hokusai's views of Mount Fuji), Redon's malevolent spider-and decorative mas- terpieces such as Mucha's bronze peacock with colored pots-de-verre inserts and Guimard's hand-painted wallpaper, emerges a newly revealed, or created, context that makes it impossible to see familiar things in the old way again.
