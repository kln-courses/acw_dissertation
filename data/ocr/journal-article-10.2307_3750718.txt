<plain_text><page sequence="1">Forethoughts for Carnivores STEWART RICHARDS Philosophers have taken some salutary exercise in recent years-notably in this journall-on the question of the rights of non-human animals and the obligations of human to non-human individuals and species. In so contentious an area there has been striking unanimity on two aspects. One of these is that, irrespective of the merits of the arguments on specific issues, this is a matter which is bound to affect the conduct of our lives. The other is that, other things being equal, it is prima facie wrong to be cruel to animals. Now if it is accepted that cruelty to animals is wrong, and if it is agreed that such cruelty is present, then it is presumably clear that the effect on our conduct should be in the form of opposition to the cruel practice. The form that this opposition might take is a matter for detailed discussion and this is not the main purpose of my present comments. Rather, I am concerned here to consider these two widely accepted premises-that it is wrong to cause unnecessary suffering to animals and that we are obliged to oppose unnecessary suffering where it exists-against the background of the many partial views expounded by philosophers and, more especially, with a view to identifying the practical conclusions that may be drawn. My particular justification for adding further to a protracted theoretical debate is that I write from a perspective a good deal closer to the primary sources of empirical evidence than has hitherto been the case.2 I take it as axiomatic that some of the most pertinent questions (for example: Do animals have interests? Do animals have consciousness? Does suffering actually occur?) cannot satisfactorily be resolved in isolation from the data of physiology, psychology and related disciplines. By this I mean that if the conceptual elements in these questions are answered unequivocally for human beings, they should also be so answered for the 'higher' animals (certainly for mammals and birds); but the degree of practical significance to be attached to the answers will then be for the appropriate empirical evidence to determine. At this point I should make it clear that I accept as valid the form of I See in particular Philosophy 53, No. 206 (October 1978). 2 As a zoologist I have performed physiological and behavioural experiments on animals of all vertebrate classes within two medical schools, where such work is taken for granted as a basis for teaching and research, and, of more immediate relevance, in a school of agriculture, where it is seen as an integral part of the science of 'animal husbandry and production'. Philosophy 56 i98i 73</page><page sequence="2">Stewart Richards Peter Singer's argument3 concerning the equal consideration of equal interests, regardless of species, and that this consideration must be applied to all animals which, as a matter of fact, can be shown to have interests in the normally accepted sense of concern for what befalls them.4 But the question of which species share equal interests is less straightforward than Singer suggests. In arguing that our consideration of interests should reflect the best biological assessment currently available as to a given species' evolutionary development, I am obviously accepting that some interests are 'weaker' than others, but I do not acknowledge that this acceptance provides general licence for the indulgence of human self- interest. On the contrary, in the majority of cases where there is conflict of interests, there are strong utilitarian grounds for the assertion that the particular animal interest at stake weighs more heavily than the particular conflicting human interest. However, there are also non-utilitarian con- siderations which are of at least equal importance and these we should briefly examine first. I 'It is good to maintain and cherish life; it is evil to destroy and to check life'5 The dominant paradigms of scientific rationalism provide some illuminating insights into the current received wisdom on the differences between human nature and animal nature. This question is at the very heart of the different treatment thought fit for human and non-human animals. The modern speciesist6 is anxious to maintain that there is a fundamental difference between human and non-human animals, and that this difference is of a morally relevant kind. He thus postulates an ontological discontinuity but, as a good evolutionist, recognizes that it is difficult to say whether this is really a difference of degree or of kind. Some arbitrary line-drawing will be inevitable, and he may be grateful for Whitehead's dictum that 3 See Peter Singer, Animal Liberation (London: Jonathan Cape, 1976) and 'All Animals are Equal' in T. Regan and P. Singer (eds), Animal Rights and Human Obligations (Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey; Prentice Hall, I976). 4 I am aware that on this definition it can plausibly be maintained that all living organisms have interests. 5 Albert Schweitzer.

But the extent of the degree makes all the difference. The Rubicon has been crossed.'7 This difficulty is well illustrated by recent studies in psychology and ethology. Few, if any, of the characteristics listed by philosophers since the time of Aristotle as indicators of the uniqueness of man now stand unchallenged. Biologists no longer dispute that there are non-human animals capable of learning, of conceptualizing and of planning ahead. Many animals use tools and a few make them. Birds and mammals can count, and so far as language is concerned there no longer appears to be any single criterion which can be used infallibly to distinguish human from non-human animals. 'Although no animal appears to have a language which is propositional, fully syntactic, and at the same time clearly ex- pressive of intention, all these features can be found separately (to at least some degree) in the animal kingdom.'8 Even the aesthetic apprecia- tion of 'significant form' in visual and auditory patterns seems to be within the capacity of certain creatures when our judgment is not wholly anthro- pocentric. And yet . .. Despite the bridges which are everywhere, we all sense that the chasm which remains raises problems that are as fundamental as ever. How much do these studies tell us about what it is to be human and what are we to make of the whole question if it is to have moral implications for the treatment of animals? A recent solution is the proposal of John Benson that Singer's claim that 'all animals are equal' be rejected 'because of the relationships with other individuals which are inseparable from belonging to the same species'.9 Leslie Francis and Richard Norman10 also follow this line (independently), but by adopting characteristics which are relational and intra-specific they conveniently ensure the fulfilment of their initial objective and generate the notion of the 'human community' as a community of a morally significant kind. On this basis, human interests are seen as having a degree of moral importance for human beings which the interests of non-human animals cannot have. If we consistently apply these same arguments to the 'porcine community' and the 'bovine community' we find that a distinction along these lines is inadequate for it is based on nothing more than the biological uniqueness of all species. Of course there are differences in the relations of individuals within and between any species, but if this is the only sort of distinction 7 From Modes of Thought, I938; quoted by W. H.

Man will be subject to the so-called 'laws of the jungle' just like any other species, his concern being self-interested dominion over his 'prey'. But if we feel instinctively unhappy with this, as we assuredly do, it is because man is unique with respect to all other species in a way which is qualitatively distinct from their own uniqueness with respect to each other. The empirical evidence defines the biological continuity of all life and tells us what is animal in man; but it cannot detect the human poten- tialities in animals simply because the essence of humanity is not itself a biological conception but is, in Cora Diamond's phrase, 'more an object of contemplation than of observation'.11 Man is unique because of the unique emergent properties that he shares with no other species. In his degree of self-awareness, and in his progressive apprehension of a profounder awareness through this pursuit of the Good, he transcends the non-human animals and his own animal self. It is in this transcendence that he achieves his status as the 'ethical animal', the creature who uniquely is apart from and above the law of the jungle. Darwin's meditation upon his hypothetical 'anthropomorphous apes' is as relevant today as it ever was: no matter how much they impress us by their extraordinary abilities, by their altruism and their compassion, 'they would be forced to acknowledge that disinterested love of all living creatures, the most noble attribute of man, was quite beyond their com- prehension'.12 In summary then, I am in this section following Schopenhauer in arguing that 'boundless compassion for all living beings is the firmest and surest guarantee of pure moral conduct, and needs no casuistry'.13 This principle of morality, in contrast to that of Kant, resolves the factitious problem of 'rational beings' as well as that of the observational evidence purporting to demonstrate the uniqueness of man. It is not that this evidence is irrelevant but rather that it cannot, by its nature, get to the core of the problem, in much the same way as physics cannot fun- damentally answer the question, What is gravity? or biology, What is life? If man were no more different from apes than apes are from monkeys, then there might be no good reason for him to treat other species differently than they treat each other. But vegetarians should unite with speciesists 11 Cora Diamond, 'Eating Meat and Eating People', Philosophy 53, No, 206 (October 1978), 470. 12 Charles Darwin, 'Outline of the Evidence' in The Descent of Man; re- printed in The Darwin Reader, M.

This principle is a good deal closer to the moral imperatives of Buddhism and Hinduism than of Christianity, but it nevertheless does not forbid the taking of life in all circumstances, as for example to spare a creature (perhaps a human creature) from excruciating and intractable pain. Rather, it is a part of the One-ness with all life that Man feels in his profounder contemplation of nature. If he respects his fellow living beings in so far only as he will otherwise be inconvenienced, then he will be concerned solely with their use for man. If he transcends this view, he will perceive the intrinsic value of life as something which ought not to be destroyed because it cannot be created.14 II 'Where life ranks highest, there it can suffer most'15 Whatever view may be taken on the naive argument of the first section- and I am aware that it will be rejected by many as 'religiose', that is, contrary to the dogmas of the dominant religions of scientism and rational- ism-perhaps few philosophers will wish to disillusion the layman who clings to the belief that the function of ethics is, after all, to guide us in doing what is right. On the question of the relations of human and non-human animals it is widely agreed not only that gratuitous cruelty to animals is wrong but also that such cruelty is widespread in modern intensive systems of animal husbandry. This conviction is held equally by those philosophers not altogether well disposed towards the idea of 'animal liberation' and by those who are. For instance, Donald Vandeveer says 'the claim that animals are frequently and significantly harmed in serious ways by captivity... and in the case of factory farming, is, I think, incontrovertible','6 while Francis and Norman recognize that 'modern techniques of intensive farming are quite disgracefully and unnecessarily cruel'.'7 If, therefore, the cruel practices that are agreed to exist, are also agreed to be morally 14 Biologists may, of course, soon be able to put together the vehicle that carries life. 15 Charles Sherrington, Man on His Nature (London: Pelican reprint, I955), 286. 16 Donald Vandeveer, 'Defending Animals by Appeal to Rights', in Regan and Singer, op. Cit., 227. 17 Francis and Norman, op. cit., 527. 77</page><page sequence="6">Stewart Richards wrong and if-as is surely right-what is morally wrong must be opposed, then it is our duty to take appropriate action. Even those individuals who decline to accept that animals have a 'right to life',18 and who have no objection to eating them, nevertheless have a clear moral duty to refrain from eating those animals which have been the objects of cruel practices during their lives. This is not merely because it is generally wrong to benefit by utilizing the products of a cruel practice, but more simply because the only support this particular practice needs is our money. It is to be regretted that some writers have tried to confuse a moral position that is perfectly clear-cut by asking us to balance the admitted suffering of the food animals against the alleged economic and gustatory deprivation of human beings fulfilling what otherwise would be their agreed moral obligation. This attitude simply ignores the alternative systems of husbandry which, as a demonstrable matter of fact, cause significantly less suffering in the shape of frustration and deprivation. Its advocates are not being asked to abandon the eating of animals, but merely the eating of those animals which have been the cruelly exploited means to economic ends. The opposition to cruelty in farming does not itself imply vegetarianism; what it does involve is inconvenience (for example in searching for 'free-range' meat and eggs), but this is the small price that must be paid by honest individuals who are opposed to cruelty and agree that cruelty is present. Of course, it may always be claimed that there is no evidence that intensive animal husbandry is cruel. This, not surprisingly, is the position of those closest to modern agribusiness, for no one proclaims that it is good to be cruel. It is my experience that the strength of this conviction is directly proportional to the extent of (commercial) involvement in the practice, and I shall have more to say about this in section IV. For the moment, I want merely to repeat that those who are satisfied that there is unjusti- fiable and unnecessary cruelty in animal production are obliged, in practice, to boycott its products. I do not think that the question of whether non-human animals can suffer need detain us long. Despite the influence of Descartes, the position originally taken by Aristotle has been corroborated beyond all reasonable doubt by physiological and psychological studies during the present century. Pain was not one of the five senses enumerated by Aristotle, but he laid great stress upon its importance in human and animal life. He realized that the sense of touch is among the earliest to appear in animals and that the hierarchy of animal forms reflects an increasing sensitivity to touch 18 See in particular Tom Regan, 'The Moral Basis of Vegetarianism', Canadian Journal of Philosophy 5, No. 2 (October I975), 205-214. 78</page><page sequence="7">Forethoughts for Carnivores and to pain.19 When we encounter Charles Sherrington, one of the giants of modern neurophysiology, saying that 'human life has among its privileges that of pre-eminence in pain',20 we think quite naturally of a conscious awareness of pain, fully dissociated from a simple behavioural reflex, and return to Aristotle's conception of the Idea as the form of sensations deprived of matter. Thus, in both the ancient and the modern contexts we arrive at the notion of two kinds of pain, one the direct consequence of some physical insult, the other indirect and more akin to 'psychological suffering' (although the Idea of a painful experience may be very close to the experience itself). The first kind poses no significant problem, for animal 'models' have long served as the physiological basis of our understand- ing of human pain. The second is another matter. It is on this kind of pain that many of the practical issues are centred and on which I am advocating assessment in terms of evolutionary development. Sherrington emphasized the importance of the awareness of pain in the context of altruism which 'amounts to sharing suffering as though another's suffering were its own. When we sense pain it is that our awareness is that pain. A great gift some might say divine-comes to the "self" when perceiving certain suffering external to itself it so reacts to it that the suffering becomes its own.'21 To dismiss as anthropomorphic the extension of these sentiments to all sentient creatures is to fulfil the nightmare of Isaac Singer's character Herman: 'In their behaviour towards creatures, all men [are] Nazis'.22 Just as it is more wicked to take the life of a man than of an ox, of an ox than of a fowl, or of a fowl than of a fish, because we can recognize an evolutionary continuum of development of sensibilities and potentialities, so is it more wicked to cause pain or suffering to a 'higher' than to a 'lower' creature. Equally it is not irrelevant to make comparisons between like conditions of deprivation in different species in the hierarchy, for example between the gross overcrowding and imprisonment of chickens and of men. That the former is a lesser crime than the latter (for we do recognize significant differences in brain, behaviour and 'sensitivity', between birds and men) does not make the former not a crime; if we accept that the latter is wrong, we must accept that the former is wrong also. 19 The neurophysiological evidence indicates that the sensation of pain is mediated by a distinct type of nerve fibre; i.e. pain does not seem to result from the over-stimulation of fibres that normally transmit other sorts of sensation, such as touch or temperature. This, however, in no way undermines the general validity and relevance of Aristotle's interpretation. 20 Sherrington, op. cit., 286. 21 Sherrington, op. cit., 29I. 22 Isaac Bashevis Singer, Enemies, A Love Story (New York: Farrar, Strauss and Giroux, I97I), 256-257. (First quoted in this context by Tom Regan, op. cit., i8i.) 79</page><page sequence="8">Stewart Richards The practical implication is clear: the 'conditional vegetarian' will be unwilling to eat the flesh or eggs of the imprisoned chickens because the interest of the chickens in being free (to scratch, dust-bath, build nests and so on), though weaker than the human interest in being free (to express equivalent human 'drives') is nevertheless stronger than the particular human interest in question, namely that of not being inconveni- enced (at having to find free-range animal foods). Even if a boycott of the products of factory farming is not widespread, the conditional vegetarian cannot in good conscious eat them himself, because it is only for himself that, ultimately, he can have responsibility. The notion of moral progress has been discussed surprisingly little in connection with animal suffering and I think it worth a brief comment. It is commonly said that 'progress' implies movement towards a desirable goal, in this case the movement of our moral attitudes towards what is good for animals. But if what is good is a matter of contention then so likewise will be the moral value of our evolving opinions. However, with animals this is hardly a problem because it is almost universally accepted that to cause them unnecessary suffering is intrinsically evil. The direction of progress is therefore that which minimizes suffering, and it is only hypocrisy which pretends that this direction is any more elusive in the case of farm animals than in the case of bears or cocks, the baiting and fighting of which we long ago outlawed in recognition of their cruelty. These pastimes, incidentally, were banned not only out of concern for the animals but also out of guilt experienced by the legislators at the sadistic pleasure of the audience. For battery hens, veal calves and 'barley beef' there is no audience, and it is tempting to conclude that where the source of the guilt is hidden and the guilt itself accordingly repressed, the suffering alone is not a sufficient condition for legal action. This is precisely why the whole concept of intensive farming needs to be opened up to public scrutiny. Only when its practices are seen to be cruel can public guilt motivate legal action. Moral progress has occurred in respect of our treatment of animals (both human and non-human) through the centuries, and factory farming is tolerated by a humane society only because its immoral practices operate behind closed doors and windowless walls. Finally, I close this section with a comment on recent discussions of the utilitarian problem which, at least since the time of Bentham and MIill, has quite rightly been at the centre of the animal rights debate. The utilitarian who will not eat the flesh of intensively reared animals, whatever the detailed inputs to his own particular calculus, adopts this stance solely because he wishes to minimize animal suffering. This is a motive that should neither be scorned nor lightly dismissed, for what is wrong with compassion, affection and sympathy? The critics who are concerned logically to refute this position do not present an edifying spectacle when 80</page><page sequence="9">Forethoughts for Carnivores they neglect to acknowledge its well-intentioned motivation in their scramble to score negatively on minor points of detail. Naive our condi- tional vegetarian may be, but at least he is acting in good faith, is unlikely to be doing any significant harm, and is attempting to establish moral principles by which to live. In essentials, he is asking only that we provide for farm animals conditions as near the optimum for the realization of their potentialities for enjoyment of their short lives as is consistent with their captivity. His ground for objecting to the severe confinement of intensive systems of husbandry is that the best evidence available indicates that these frustrate basic biological interests of the animals and thus cause significant, unnecessary and unjustifiable suffering. Where uncertainty arises (for example as to the level of awareness and hence the strength of a particular interest) the animal should in all cases be given the benefit of the doubt. If these precepts were followed, the physical and psychological suffering would be minimized and much of the weight taken out of the utilitarian argument against factory farming which, indeed, would be abolished. Of course, the animals would still have to be killed (and the expression 'painless killing', while it might arguably have meaning for the perfect marksman in the wild, is a sickening euphemism in the context of modern mass slaughter), but at least the utilitarian who did not object to this per se would be satisfied. For the great majority of people who are informed about cruelty to animals, it is this issue which is so clear-cut and which could be resolved so simply. If the necessary reforms will not come from within the animal production establishment (for fear of loss of profit) they can come only from without. And this is why any individual who reflects honestly on this question will be obliged, for utilitarian reasons alone, to cease eating factory farmed flesh. III 'Four legs good, two legs better'23 Pigs are not more equal than people. In the previous section I argued that while we are obliged to give equal consideration to equal interests, regardless of species, this is not inconsistent with the view that, other things being equal, particular human interests (say the interest in enjoying a 'decent' life) do have a moral relevance that is greater than the equivalent animal interests. The ground offered was that the strength of a given interest is a function, not of difference of species, but of level of development (which, of course, is not necessarily the same thing). This section considers the plight of the meat eater on this basis. 23 George Orwell, Animal Farm (London: Penguin reprint, i963), I14. 6</page><page sequence="10">Stewart Richards In the affluent countries of the world much of the cereal crop is being fed to cattle, pigs and poultry in order to produce animal protein for the rich minority, rather than being made available directly as plant protein for the poor, undernourished and malnourished majority of mankind. It takes approximately 2o kg of cereal to produce i kg of beef, or about 8 kg for i kg of pork. About three and a half times as much grain is consumed per person in the United States (somewhat less in Europe) as in the Third World countries, 90 per cent of it as meat. The world's (human) require- ment for protein could, in theory, be met from the cereal production alone, yet this of course neglects the vast protein resources of the pulses and oil seeds. But these too are grown increasingly for animal feeds, so much so that European pig and poultry production is already dependent upon processed meals such as those made from soya and imported from the United States. The individual who rejects the previous argument against factory farming on the ground that no particular animal interest can be shown to carry greater weight than any particular conflicting human interest, is nevertheless obliged to consider whether he is justified in continuing to give his support to a system that feeds animals in preference to human beings. If he judges this to be morally wrong, but still wishes to eat meat, then the onus will be on him to verify that the animals that he eats were fed on material unfit or unsuitable for human consumption as, for example, is the case with free-ranging animals grazing pasture. (This would pose an insuperable problem for most American consumers, although in Britain the majority of beef and lamb presently on the market would still pass the test. Most pork and poultry would, however, have to be ruled out.) It might be argued that discrimination along these lines would be ineffective because, even if a selective boycott resulted in surplus stocks of grain, the capitalist system would never sanction the shipping of these stocks free, or even at below market value, to the Third World, but would instead establish a temporary 'grain mountain' to be consumed during a period when farmers would be subsidized not to plant their usual acreage. In practical terms there is no doubt that this is a possible response, but the moral point is surely that an uncertain bad result of a good action cannot be used as a reason for not acting ethically. After all, this particular out- come of a selective boycott would not make the conditions of the world's poor any worse, but it would always have a potential for reducing human suffering. Furthermore, since a widespread boycott has never been tried, it is by no means certain that the cynical outcome would, in fact, be realized. Since words (at North-South UN Conferences and the like) appear to have little impact, it may be that action would. In any case, to understand fully the horrifying dimensions of world-wide starvation and to be aware that this starvation could be eliminated rapidly given a 82</page><page sequence="11">Forethoughts for Carnivores redistribution of world grain supplies-and cannot be eliminated without it is reason enough to promote at least a reduction in meat consumption sufficient to allow a significant redistribution to be tried. To continue the same eating habits as before the possession of this knowledge would be morally reprehensible. IV 'Only connect'24 Aquinas and Kant held that we should not be cruel to animals because this would be liable to make us act cruelly also to people. Nowhere do they say that it is good to be cruel but only that we have no direct obligations to 'irrational' creatures. Now even leaving aside the problem of what the empirical evidence since their time indicates about which animals may be said to act rationally, it seems clear-apparently to vegetarian and non- vegetarian philosophers alike that this is advocating the right action for the wrong reason. Almost everyone agrees that it is wrong, in itself, to cause animals unnecessary suffering. Nevertheless, the question of the influence on human beings of contact with suffering in animals is important. It is demonstrably evident that in a society where familiarity with cruel practices is a part of the enculturation process, only a tiny minority of people ever protest. This is the more so when the majority of the dominant group gain as a result of the practice as, for example, with slavery or apartheid, where they gain free or cheap labour, or with bull fighting or stag hunting, where they gain excitement and 'glamour'. No one would pretend that unconcern for animal suffering is the cause of unconcern for human suffering but some might speculate on whether the conditions that promote the acceptance of the one are likely to be the common cause that promotes also the acceptance of the other. No answer is available on this question, although the notorious ability of men to think within compartments of self-interest (of species, sex, race, caste and so on) suggests that it would be affirmative. One who causes suffering to animals in the name of commerce or recreation is quite possibly no more likely to promote suffering within his own (human) group than is one who does not;25 but let someone dissent from his views to threaten his position and (as with anti-hunt saboteurs) he may expect to receive treatment of a kind not wholly unlike that inflicted on the oppressed species. This at least has the merit of being a consistent response and if there is a point to be made here at all it is that violence 24 E. M. Forster, Howards End (London: Edward Arnold, i9io), title page. 25 But whether society has the right to ask of an individual that he gain his livelihood working, for example, in a slaughterhouse, is another matter. 83</page><page sequence="12">Stewart Richards (which causes suffering) will not unnaturally be seen as a logical way of protecting one's right to be violent, whereas it would not be a consistent way of protecting one's right to dissent from violence. In this limited sense it is therefore perhaps a reasonable fear that the observation of or participation in practices that cause suffering may increase the sum total of suffering and of those who suffer. Aquinas notwithstanding, it is in the broader context obviously difficult to show that those who are cruel to animals are likely also to be cruel to people. (There are many instances of human beings who are cruel to animals yet kind to people, and some who are kind to animals and cruel to people, but I know of no evidence of any causal connection in these cases.) But is it possible that prolonged participation in the practices of the factory farm (or the slaughterhouse) might desensitize human beings to animal suffering and therefore contribute to a vicious cycle in which, as the relentless 'advance' of technological innovations on the farm seems to suggest, the practices become ever more extreme? Most people, including non-vegetarian philosophers, when actually shown the conditions under which animals live on factory farms, unhesitatingly accept that they are cruel and cause unnecessary and unjustifiable suffering. Many hold that the cruelty and the suffering are 'self-evident', that is, that these are judgments quite without need of 'proof' in terms of empirical evidence and of the kind that any unbiased person is bound to make. But of course they are not made by those involved in factory farming. This is not to imply that such people are themselves knowingly cruel but only that they have become 'brainwashed' by familiarization into accepting cruelty or to 'seeing through' it when cruelty is before their eyes. One contentious problem here is that judgments as to when animal suffering is or is not present are generally entrusted to the veterinary profession. But veterin- arians have been conditioned by protracted exposure and indoctrination, not to say by vested interest, in much the same way as agriculturists. Their verdicts are delivered in the parochial terms of scientific rationalism from which all 'emotive' considerations are excluded in order to conform with the ideology. A balanced view can be achieved only from an alliance between rationalism and compassion, for the data relevant to the decision- making process range far more widely than the myopic mentality of the scientific conspiracy pretends. Short-sightedness seems also to underlie the extraordinary dichotomy in our thinking on 'pets' and on farm animals. We are said to be a nation of animal lovers on the ground that we keep in our homes countless millions of cats and dogs. Instances of cruelty to these creatures make bold head- lines and there is constant correspondence in the newspapers on the immensely complex problem of laboratory experiments on animals, the bulk of it consistently expressing general disapproval. Yet these same protesters are, in the main, continuing to eat the flesh of factory-farmed 84</page><page sequence="13">Forethoughts for Carnivores animals apparently unconcerned about or unaware of the cruelty to them. This is a form of speciesism that cannot be defended by any of the arguments used to dissociate human from non-human species; the person opposed to cruelty to dogs, cats and budgerigars must also oppose cruelty to cattle, pigs and poultry. That he does not do so appears to be because we have established barriers to meaningful communications with those animals that we happen to exploit for our food. These are not biological barriers of the sort that undoubtedly do exist between us and the in- vertebrates or the 'cold-blooded' vertebrates, but contrived barriers of convenience established to assuage our collective guilt. Communication leads to 'identification' and we identify with our fellow human and non- human creatures in proportion to the quality of the contacts we enjoy. Biologically there is no reason why we should not enjoy at least the same relations with a pig as with a dog (as in the child's story, 'The Peppermint Pig'); Orwell was well aware that pigs are animals of quite exceptional intelligence. The 'filthy pig' stereotypes are fulfilled by the nature of the conditions in which these animals are forced to live; the conditions are as unjust and as unrevealing of the natural characteristics of pigs as the stench from the hold of a slave ship was of the characteristics of people. As Benson puts it: 'our remoteness from animals encourages indifference and indifference removes moderation' ;26 by assiduously maintaining our remoteness from the husbandry and the slaughter we ensure that our guilt and 'natural' inhibitions are suppressed, much as they are when we drop anti-personnel fragmentation bombs from high-flying aircraft in modern war. There is also inconsistency in our concern for wild animals by comparison with that for those of the table. When we see the slogan 'Save the Whales', we know that it reflects concern for endangered species; we recognize that the extinction of whales would in some important way impoverish the world and our lives (even though few people could ever expect to see one). We may also believe that the sign protests at the suffering inflicted on a fellow mammal when it is harpooned and dragged to its death. But when we see the slogan 'Save the Seals', we know that it reflects a concern, not for a species whose numbers are seriously in decline, but for one that is sufficiently numerous to endanger the interests of the fishing industry. The slogan in respect of seals is concerned chiefly with individuals whereas that in respect of whales is concerned chiefly with species. When we speak of cruelty we are referring to actions which cause suffering to individuals; it makes little sense to speak of cruelty to a species. Consequently, those people who are concerned to save the seals (from being clubbed to death) must, if they are to avoid falling into the most indefensible of speciesist traps, be concerned also to save those individual animals which are sub- 26 Benson, op. cit., 545. 85</page><page sequence="14">Stewart Richards jected to far longer periods of suffering, ending in death, in the course of being 'produced' for meat, We now come briefly to a word on the most vexed questions of all; namely those concerning the extent to which people's moral attitudes on animals are prejudiced by their having been conditioned to a flesh diet; by their simple moral laziness; by their wish to be morally superior; or by their hostility at being considered morally weak. There can be no doubt that almost all people in W~estern countries have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo because they are strongly identified with the taste for meat. This identification (which is not instinc- tive but is the result of a particular upbringing) is reinforced daily by custom, not to say by the specific pressures of the food industry. Consciously or unconsciously, the identification promotes a stream of self-supporting arguments to the effect that we have every right to exploit animals in any way we wish. Ritual obeisance is paid to the notion that we should always minimize their suffering, although in practice the 'unavoidable' suffering will never outweigh the human interest in a flesh diet. Although philoso- phers in particular are careful to express themselves in impressively rational language, it must be considered possible that the strength of their convictions on the eating of flesh derives from sources other than reason. (We need not here explore what these sources might be, although if philosophers were less fond of the antique reductionism that stresses man's rationality it would be intriguing to see the whole debate construed in terms of conflict between moral and biological imperatives.) A good deal of energy is expended not only in advocating the flesh diet but also in refuting vegetarianism, or, it might be more accurate to say, in refuting vegetarians. The significance of this distinction is to be found in the personal dimension. To confront a series of reassuringly fallible arguments as to why it is wrong to eat flesh is little more than a temporary diversion, but to confront an individual who implements the arguments is intolerably provocative. But why? Why should the vegetarian arouse hostility-except, perhaps understandably, in those who depend for their livelihood directly on the meat industry? Could it be, after all, that moral philosophy operates in a self-sufficient compartment and has little to do with the affairs of daily life? If so, then it is less surprising that the call for even a modest self-sacrifice soon separates the ethical sheep from the goats, and that a sophisticated rational defence must be found for a position that is not grounded on reason at all. Whichever way he turns the vegetarian is in a difficult position. If he campaigns overtly he can expect little support and, what is more important, little success. He has no way of proving that he is not indulging a self- righteous ego-trip, and in any case is quickly ridiculed as an eccentric. This relieves his opponents (thankfully, not his philosophical opponents) of the necessity to refute his arguments. If he abjures all proselytizing 86</page><page sequence="15">Forethoughts for Carnivores zeal and follows what, for him, is a personal path of 'Right Action' then he has to live with the fact that his example will be ignored and will have negligible impact on the evil to which he is opposed. The assertive path may all too easily be counter-productive by further digging-in an already entrenched opposition. At least the role of passive exemplar is unlikely to do harm to man or beast; at best it might even serve as well as any other means of enhancing our ethical sensibilities. Indeed, the optimist may contrive to find hope in the burgeoning movement for 'eco-holism', in the naive idea that respect for nature and for life is somehow intrinsically more moral than lack of respect for nature and for life. But in any event the vegetarian should not feel unduly immodest in putting to his flesh-eating neighbour the following simple questions before he sits down to the ritual of the Sunday roast: (i) Does he not feel that it is morally preferable not to kill than to kill, when the death of an animal is unnecessary for the fulfilment of his own life? If he does then he will be obliged to refrain from being party to the killing of animals. (ii) If not, but if he is nevertheless opposed to cruelty to animals, does he not feel morally unjustified in eating the flesh of animals which have suffered cruelly throughout their lives while being exploited as 'things' in the massive machinery of 'meat production'? (iii) If not, but if he is nevertheless opposed to cruelty to people, does he not feel morally unjustified in eating the flesh of intensively reared animals fed on plant protein from the lack of which millions of his fellow human beings are dying cruel deaths? If he does then he will be obliged to refrain from eating animals fed on food fit for human consumption. (iv) If not, will he look into his heart of hearts and consider whether his own moral judgment is being impaired by custom, convenience or ignorance ?27 Wye College, University of London 27 I am grateful to Chris Cherry and Richard Norman for their generous advice and comments. 87</page></plain_text>
