<plain_text><page sequence="1">A COE VOLUTION ARY REVISION OF DECISION MAKING PROCESSES: AN ANALYSIS OF PORT EXTENSIONS IN GERMANY, BELGIUM AND THE NETHERLANDS LASSE GERRITTS Erasmus University ABSTRACT This article aims to develop an alternative framework for analyzing public decision making processes. It uses a complex systems approach that revolves around the coevolutionary principle of reciprocal selection between policy systems and their environment. The framework is applied to two case studies about port extensions in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands in order to explain the outcomes of decisions that were unintended, unobserved, unexpected, and unwanted. It is argued that this approach helps detecting the causal relationships between decision making and the consequences for the system being governed and how this causality that is often badly understood can backfire on public decision makers. INTRODUCTION Decision making is often embedded in the implicit or explicit assumption that human decision makers have considerable freedom to steer the system they want to change. This type of thinking is dominant in decision making over physical systems such as rivers, coastal zones, nature parks, etc. Considerable resources are spent on research and planning procedures in order to develop a comprehensive plan for an area. As long as the physical system responds in predictable ways, there are no obvious reasons to challenge this assumption. But often, the responses are erratic and, sometimes, unfavorable (cf. Gunderson, 2001).</page><page sequence="2">310 PAQ FALL 2011 Although unfavorable consequences are often attributed to poor planning strategies and faulty decision making, they are not a proof that decision makers have made intentional errors. Rather, it shows that decision making take place in a capricious world that is prone to ignore steering incentives. This is manifestly so in the case of decision making over physical systems such as ports and their maritime access. From the case studies presented in this article, it appears that decision makers are often surprised by the outcomes of their decisions, sometimes unpleasantly. The first step in understanding how seemingly sound decisions can lead to unintended or even unwanted effects on physical systems is to understand that decisions and the actors who make these decisions are an integral part of a chain of causes and consequences that drives physical change (cf. Hook, 1999; Turner 2000). This calls for a contingent analysis of the dynamics of steering physical systems. The purpose of this article is to analyze that chain of causes and consequences in order to explain unexpected outcomes in decision making over physical systems. Central to this analysis is the concept of coevolution. This concept forms the heart of a conceptual model of decision making processes that is presented in the following section. This model is then used to analyze two case studies about decision making over seaport extensions in fragile estuaries in Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. The longitudinal analysis of the cases shows that decisions made under pressure backfire in the long run. This analysis leads to the formulation of five propositions about complex decision making processes in the final section of this article.</page><page sequence="3">PAQ FALL 2011 311 A COMPLEX SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE There is ample research about the workings of physical systems such as the estuaries discussed in this article. However, public decision making is still generally regarded as a black box from the perspective of natural sciences as little is understood about the dynamics of decision making and the impact of those dynamics on physical systems. On the other hand, while the dynamics of decision making are the core subjects in Public Administration, less is known from that perspective about the physical effects of decisions on the systems and how these effects in turn influence decision makers. In Public Administration, it is the physical system that is the black box. A number of authors identify the need to understand the connections and dynamic interactions between physical systems and public decision making processes but a thorough empirical understanding of these relationships has hitherto been lacking (Folke, 2006; Gual &amp; Norgaard, 2010; Kalis &amp; Norgaard, 2010; Kotchen &amp; Young, 2007; O' Sullivan, Manson, Messina, &amp; Crawford, 2006). In order to understand these relations, one has first to assume a systemic point of departure for analysis. Unintended changes may occur as a result of an incorrect decision but could also be caused by a (physical) development elsewhere in the environment or a combination of factors. Isolating the object of research from its context is unhelpful as this context is necessary for a better understanding of the relationships. Secondly, such an analysis should take into account that the causal relationships between systems are circular as systems respond to changes from other systems, i.e. the physical system responds to decisions but in doing so creates a new situation to which decision makers are compelled to respond. Thirdly, the complexity of causality does not stem only from the multiple causes and effects but</page><page sequence="4">312 PAQ FALL 2011 also from an erratic relationship between those causes and effects. This means that causal relationships could be altered through the occurrence of events or could lead to different development pathways if repeated elsewhere in time and / or location (cf. Byrne, 2005). These three provisions provide the basic components a complex systems approach to the interaction between physical systems and decision makers in social systems (cf. Flood &amp; Jackson, 1991; Hartvigsen, Kinzig &amp; Peterson, 1998; Levin, 1998). Systemic thinking in itself is not new (Francis, 1999) but thinking in terms of complex adaptive systems is a relative new addition to the class of systemic theories (Goldstein, 1999). As a perspective, it is increasingly gaining attention because it has considerable potential for explanatory power in complex public decision making processes (see e.g. Mor9ol earlier in Public Administration Quarterly, 2005; 2008). Theoretical models of complexity are always imperfect because models require simplification and abstraction. This could mean that what is retrospectively seen as important has been inadvertently left out because it was unforeseen (Cilliers, 2001). Byrne (2005) argues that empirical research conducted through a conceptual model is inevitably constrained by the structure and limited set of variables, but that this is not insurmountable if it is kept in mind that the variables do not represent the full complexity but rather the tangible traces of it. Bearing this proviso in mind, a conceptual model embedded in the complex adaptive systems approach is developed in the next section. COEVOLUTIONARY DECISION MAKING PROCESSES If the disposition of two or more systems, such as a policy system and a physical system evolve through time because of mutual influence, this is a form of coevolution.</page><page sequence="5">PAQ FALL 2011 313 The concept of coevolution is rooted in evolutionary biology and was coined by Erhlich and Raven (1964), who observed that groups of organisms evolved through reciprocal selective interaction (Odum, 1971). Although it is rooted in biology, the coevolutionary principle has emerged in other domains (Norgaard, 1984; Sanderson, 1990). An explicit attempt to abandon the development of a physical or a social system as a parallel or analogue one and to replace it with a coevolutionary perspective can be attributed to Norgaard (1984; 1994). He states that coevolutionary development has been occurring for millennia as people attempt to use physical systems to their benefit. In doing this people engage in a pattern of feedback loops. In order to deal with the ensuing feedback from the physical system, people are pushed to create increasingly individualized task specifications and more complex institutional and cultural contingencies. Thus, while physical systems respond to anthropomorphic changes, social systems respond to the ensuing changes from the physical system, which the physical system then responds to with yet another set of changes. These feedback loops can be considered to be selection pressures as they can have a determining impact on future possibilities of systems. Public decision makers have the ability to select and manage the selection pressures that feedback loops exert on systems deliberately and to decide on the pool of resources. They have the ability to forecast, plan, anticipate and respond and as such can give shape to the direction of coevolution. Coevolution is more than just 'mutual influence'. It has multiple mechanisms that can be named and used to understand how connected systems evolve, and this is explanatory for the occurrence of unforeseen and unintended effects from decisions. These mechanisms are presented in the following sections.</page><page sequence="6">314 PAQ FALL 2011 RECIPROCAL SELECTION AS FORMS OF FEEDBACK Coevolution is driven by reciprocal selection. Selection pressures provoke adaptation and thus it becomes feedback. This poses two questions: what is being selected and how is it selected? Imagine the decision maker walking a path through a cloud of points. Each point represents a possible future state of the system that the decision maker wants to govern. The decision maker will try to exert pressure in order to change the system from the current state to the next desired state. However, the route towards a new point is not static, nor is the composition of the cloud. The adaptation to a certain pressure from the decision maker means a change in the systems' states but, given path-dependency and lock-in, this in turn means that certain future trajectories or sequences of future systems' states become possible while others are relegated outside the range of what is feasible. Choices made by decision makers lead to changes within the system that rule out other possible directions of development. Conversely, a system change as a response to decisions pushes decision makers into a reactive role as they face a new situation that could be different from their previous intentions (cf. Diehl &amp; Sterman, 1995). Reciprocal selection therefore means that the future state of systems is mutually determined by selection pressures from the decision makers and the systems they want to govern. Selecting future states happens in two ways: perceptible and blind. Perceptible selection occurs when decision makers assess the current situation, define a desired state of the system they attempt to govern and draw up a solution to change the current situation into the desired situation. The outcome of this determines a renewed system state from which decision makers can continue to work. Since there is causal relationship between a decision at one</page><page sequence="7">PAQ FALL 2011 315 point in time and a change and consequent availability of system states at a later point, variation and selection of future states is part of the same feedback loop (cf. Foster &amp; Holz, 2004; Hrebiniak &amp; Joyce, 1985). Although systems could change to the new desired state, it is also possible that, given the complexity of the environment, a certain decision may lead to no changes or unintended changes. Because of the complex causation and resilience of systems, not every selection pressure sets off a change in the future states of systems and it can take multiple selection pressures that mount system pressure for a change to take place (Bruijn, 2004). Similarly, a system could respond disproportionally to the selection pressure. The consequences of these changes could be erratic: sometimes the results appear immediately, sometimes there are long delays between pressure and outcomes. In short: the consequences of a particular action may appear to be detached from that action because of the complex causation. Because this action results in changes to a situation and determines variation of a system at a later stage, this is considered blind selection, i.e. variation that is seemingly detached from the act of selecting by the decision maker but, in fact, is not. Decision making in such cases is very much like stepping in an uncertain world (cf. Flood, 1999) as explained by Koppenjan and Klijn in the context of network governance (2004). In order to structure and give meaning that inform actors how to respond to such (perceptible and blind) selection pressures, decision makers apply selection mechanisms. SELECTION MECHANISMS Decision makers in the public realm seldom act alone. They are part of a governance network or system that concerns itself with certain issues (cf. Koppenjan &amp; Klijn, 2004). Groups of public decision makers are treated</page><page sequence="8">316 PAQ FALL 2011 as policy systems in this research. Policy systems demarcate the members of society that have a direct influence on the physical system. This resembles governance networks (cf. Klijn &amp; Snellen, 2009) but it is different in that it is not formal membership but actual x influence on other systems that shapes the boundaries of the system. Moreover, it accepts that policy systems are inherently more dynamic regarding to their boundaries than the "relative stability" (Kickert, Klijn &amp; Koppenjan, 1997: xvii) attributed to governance networks (Morfol &amp; Wachhaus, 2009). The composition and connections of policy systems are part of the selection mechanisms that are employed. A circular relationship between perceptible and blind reciprocal selection and the policy system's responses exists. The stance of decision makers and the consequent selection pressures that are exerted alter their stance in response to the selection pressures. The information that is carried in the feedback loops is assessed by decision makers and then they decide to change their strategies, or not. Obviously, physical systems such as the ones presented in the case studies below can not decide deliberately, but human decision makers can. There are two main ways of coping with the information from feedback loops: through boundary judgments and through diversity of information. Through Simon's work (e.g. 1991) it is understood that the capacity to process information in the public realm is limited and that representations through boundary settings can help to enhance this capacity. Boundary judgments are important responses in the confrontation to selection pressures from an erratic environment and diffuse information (Churchman, 1979; Diehl &amp; Sterman, 1995; Flood, 1999; Hrebiniak &amp; Joyce, 1985; Luhmann, 1990; 1995; Pel, 2009). Boundary judgments made by decision makers simultaneously define the policy system from the societal environment, i.e. those actors that are accepted in</page><page sequence="9">PAQ FALL 2011 317 the decision making, and the physical system that this policy system attempts to manage. The decision makers do so through connections (who are informed and listened to?) and composition (who are allowed a voice in the decision making?). This can be done by, for example, engaging with other actors and enlarging the pool of information to use for informed decisions (Gerrits &amp; Edelenbos, 2004). For example, the case studies discussed below show that the composition of the policy system could change when stakeholders were allowed to influence the decision or when communication strategies were altered. In other words: boundary judgments define the area of action in terms of inclusion and exclusion from the decision making process. The boundaries of systems are local in time and space and are subject to change if the decision makers defining the boundaries decide to do so (Flood, 1999). Boundary judgments also demarcate which information is not taken into consideration, as decision makers find it difficult to cope with the multiplicity and complexity of information (Allen &amp; Strathern, 2003; Teisman, 2005). There is, then, a relationship between the boundary judgments and the diversity of information available against which selection pressures can be assessed, as the inclusion of more actors in the policy system has the potential to introduce more diversity into the policy system and that could in turn harness the system against complexity (Axelrod &amp; Cohen, 1999). This enables actors to cope with these selection pressures, but they are likely to explore a limited degree of diversity, i.e. the diversity that exists locally and that falls within the set boundaries (Bergh, 2004). Reductionism is inevitably as it is impossible to fully determine the state of unlimited complex systems (Richardson, 2007). Instinctively, actors preserve information that lasts and discard information that is unique because repetition is a sign of stability and may point at something important. The inherent risk is that</page><page sequence="10">318 PAQ FALL 2011 information that is initially considered to be white noise and not taken into account may later prove to be vital. Actors are therefore under pressure to locate the thresholds between reductionism that remains informative and holism that is manageable. They do so through research (what is being investigated?) and scope (what is considered and included in the project?). All four types of selection mechanisms are non-hierarchically related and dependent on one another (cf. Hisschemoller, Tol &amp; Vellinga, 2001). For example, the case studies showed that research was sometimes used to explore options whereas at other times it was used to provide foundations for earlier decisions. The scope of the project altered accordingly. WALKING THROUGH THE ATTRACTOR BASIN Returning to the analogy used before: a decision maker can chose from a cloud of future stable states but the likelihood of his choice becoming reality differs. The systems being governed move from one stable state to the other through time but the next state may not be the desired one according to the decision makers. Attempts can be made to alter that stable state. In the nomenclature of complexity theory, this cloud is called the attractor basin, and the stable states are attractors within that basin. These concepts help to explain the connections between perceptible and blind reciprocal selection, selection mechanisms and coevolution. An attractor (i.e. the current state of a system) is marked by its relative stability which indicates that it has certain resilience against perturbation and therefore does not always change whenever pressure is exerted on it (Marion, 1999). System shifts to new attractors only occurs when enough system pressure is built up (cf. Walker &amp; Meyers, 2004). An example of such punctuated change is found in the agenda-setting research by Baumgartner and Jones (1993) but it extends to other</page><page sequence="11">PAQ FALL 2011 319 types of social and physical systems. Selection pressures that change systems could stem from perceptible and blind selection made by decision makers. The simplest type of attractor is the fixed point attractor, which constitutes a single stable state that keeps a system in that situation regardless of the pressure it is subject to. If a system moves between a limited set of attractors this is called the torus attractor (cf. Otter, 2000) However, successive attractors in social reality are mutually different and seldom fully recurring over time (Byrne, 2005), which is why the term strange attractor is used (Arthur &amp; Durlauf, 1997; Martin &amp; Sunley, 2006). The trajectory between different strange attractors in the attractor basin describes the evolution of a system over time because of selection pressures. The start of any case is marked by initial selection pressures: the state of a particular system (e.g. a physical system such as in the cases presented below) requires action from the policy system. The degree of freedom available is limited by what is deemed feasible both physically and socially. This presents a difficult task to the decision maker. He has to make decisions regarding the system but some demands, wishes and practical possibilities are not compatible. In order to structure the information from the selection pressures it is subject to and to develop an assessment it can act upon, the policy system applies selection mechanisms. These mechanisms determine which parts of the full attractor basin is actually observed and taken into account. This is called the projected attractor basin. It forms the point of reference from which the required policy measures are designed. Shaping the projected attractor basin is a relatively uncertain act for decision makers because of the inherent capriciousness of physical system. Having determined this, the policy system executes the measures it has developed. In other words: it exerts</page><page sequence="12">320 PAQ FALL 2011 selection pressures on the physical system. These have a two-fold impact. They affect the physical system because of physical changes, but indirectly also affect the societal environment because of these physical changes as wishes are fulfilled or not. For example, port authorities are happy with a deeper waterway but environmental pressure groups are not and they will act accordingly. The responses to the policy system determine the attractor basin available to the latter as the new situation, i.e. the new stable states of the systems, limits the attractor basin because path-dependency renders certain future trajectories through the attractor basin impossible. Coming full circle, the policy system then faces a new situation through a myriad of feedback loops. Upon assessing this, it decides between embarking on change or not. The selection mechanisms are applied again to structure the new information. The circular process of mutual selection then begins anew, but with changed conditions in all systems concerned. This conceptual model suggests a sequential process. However, since the work of Cohen, March and Olsen (1978), Kingdon (1982), Hogwood (1987) and March (1994), among others, it is understood that, empirically, decision making is seldom a well-structured, sequential process. Parson's suggestion (1995) that these models are at least superficially evolutionist-informed further indicates that decision making should not be treated as a sequential process from a coevolutionary process. This model is therefore a hybrid perspective that acknowledges that decision making does not take place in fixed sequential stages but that, at the same time, it has a longitudinal character consisting of consecutive events. The cycle of reciprocal selection is not considered to be a sequential process but a simultaneous process that consists of continuous feedback loops between the systems. Demarcations in time in the process of reciprocal selection are formed by perceived systems' shifts from one attractor</page><page sequence="13">PAQ FALL 2011 321 to another as a result of the reciprocal selections. The sequence of systems' shift through the attractor basin constitutes coevolution between physical systems and policy systems. METHODOLOGY Researching complexity and coevolution is embedded in a specific ontology and requires a specific methodological approach. This approach has to deal with two issues: the fact that coevolution is essentially a process that can only be understood longitudinally, and the fact that complexity and actors' representation of complexity are similar things (Gerrits, 2008). These issues have practical consequences for empirical research. Longitudinal research must be continuous as coevolution is a continuous process Taking snapshots at regular moments may miss out the erratic development of the process as periods of stability are punctuated with periods of swift change. This could go unnoticed. Longitudinal research must therefore be highly detailed as the non-linear emergence of structures and processes can not be traced back to its root mechanically through pure reductionism. Central to complexity-informed data collection is agents' representation and achieving inter-subjective understanding of the empirical cases (Buijs, Eshuis &amp; Byrne, 2009; Cilliers, 2005). Qualitative interviews allow respondents to provide a full and detailed account of their experience of the complexity and their subsequent responses. It enables the researcher to understand the social construction of boundaries (cf. Uprichard &amp; Byrne, 2006). This in turn allows for the reconstruction of how boundary judgments converge, diverge or intersect and how this influences the process of coevolution between systems. The process of decision making by humans is pivotal in the</page><page sequence="14">322 PAQFALL2011 analysis of coevolution between social and physical systems as they investigate the physical system and derive directions for management from research results. In doing this, they interpret (most often quantitative) data. Of importance is the observation by Williams (2007) that social and physical objects are not clearly separated. This introduces quantitative data into the qualitative analysis of coevolution (cf. Byrne, 2002). The continuous longitudinal empirical approach with its high resolution in order to meet the demands of complexity informed research is labor-intensive and therefore the number of cases is restricted. Two cases were investigated. The first case concerns the plans to deepen the Unterelbe estuary near Hamburg (Germany). This case study covers the period between 1996 and 2007 and follows the attempts of the policy system to prepare a deepening operation in order to facilitate the movement of bigger ships, how it decides to deal with physical changes following that operation while at the same time preparing for another deepening. The Westerschelde case (Belgium and The Netherlands) runs from 1993 as the policy system prepares a deepening of the estuary, to 2007 when a new deepening operation is prepared while actors attempt to understand what happened after the earlier deepening. These two cases are treated as unique cases, whose uniqueness can be made more explicit through comparison. Between 2004 and 2008, data was collected through document analysis and interviews in both cases. Document analysis covered over 350 newspaper articles, policy documents and scientific publications published about these cases. Newspaper articles from each case were triangulated using multiple sources. Forty-nine respondents were interviewed during semi-structured in-depth interviews that typically lasted 90 minutes. These interviews were recorded and transcribed. Upon request, three respondents took the opportunity to review the transcript and to correct factual</page><page sequence="15">PAQ FALL 2011 323 errors. Full lists of the documents and respondents are available from the author. Using the document analysis, a chronological series of events was reconstructed for each case. This provided the backbone for the case studies. The personal accounts of the respondents were then used to give meaning to the events and to retrieve events that had remained outside the public domain. These accounts were merged to form a single hybrid account of each case. Once the case descriptions were finalized they were sent to a number of experts involved in the cases for a peer review. The full case studies are too large to be published entirely in this article so they are mostly summarized in tables in the next section. The disadvantage of this compact method of presenting is that not all details of the case studies can be shown but this is offset against the overview offered by this compactness. CASE STUDIES The Unterelbe estuary is important for Hamburg and the entire northwestern region of Germany, as it provides maritime access to one of Europe's largest ports and as such facilitates logistics, industries and jobs. It is a heavily modified estuary. Its geometry has become fixed between dykes, its floodplains have become confined behind these dykes and its tributaries have been closed off to suit agriculture or the construction of dockyards. The Unterelbe was deepened continuously from approximately 8 meters around 1900 to 14,50 meters in 1999 in order to facilitate larger cargo ships. The case study starts when the City of Hamburg and the port authorities announce plans to initiate another deepening operation in 1996. The Westerschelde estuary is located on Dutch territory and provides the sole maritime access to the port of Antwerpen in Belgium, a port of approximately the same</page><page sequence="16">324 PAQ FALL 2011 size and importance as the port of Hamburg. Similarly to the Unterelbe, the Westerschelde has been heavily modified with dykes and groynes, the disappearance of most of the floodplains and the closing off of tributaries. It was deepened continuously but reluctantly at the request from the port authorities of Antwerpen. Since the Westerschelde is on different territory, the port authorities have to request a deepening operation with the Dutch government. The case study starts in 1993, when negotiations over a deepening operation come to a conclusion. The negations lasted thirty years, much to the dismay of the Belgian authorities. During the first phase, the Unterelbe case shows that decision makers press for quick deepening operation, which translates into a narrow scope, research aimed at justifying decisions and complete exclusion of opponents, i.e. singular decision making. The main motive for this is that the current complexity is perceived as being already overwhelming, and taking into account more variables is experienced as a threat to the progress of the project. This means that the decision makers are not aware of the contextual development of the estuary and the need for compensating measures to avoid the estuary from changing drastically. After the deepening, and around the time that a new deepening was planned, the amount of sediments accumulating in the port doubled, and then doubled again a year later. The deepening operation had toppled the estuary in a new stable state in which the fresh water discharge was replaced by flood dominance, i.e. a reverse of the net water flow in the estuary and with that a reverse in sediment transport. As a consequence, the new stable state is, indeed, deeper but also features considerable unfavorable changes that, because of the increase of sediment accumulation, cross the goal of the deepening operation. The funds spent on dredging the harbor skyrocketed in the new situation</page><page sequence="17">PAQ FALL 2011 325 Table 1 Brief overview of the characteristics of the case studies Case Unterelbe Case Westerschelde Geographical ■ North-west Germany ■ Belgium and The location Netherlands Issue ■ Deepening of the estuary ■ Deepening of the estuary to improve maritime to improve maritime access of the port access of the port Initiators ■ Hamburg Port ■ Antwerp Port Authorities, Authorities, government municipality of Antwerp, of Hamburg, Flemish government Opponents ■ Environmental pressure ■ Dutch local and regional groups, farmers, government, fishermen, concerned environmental pressure citizens living next to the groups, farmers, Dutch estuary, neighboring concerned citizens living federal states next to the estuary Niedersachsen and Schleswig-Holstein Time frame case ■ June 1 996 - December ■ July 1993 - July 2005 study 2006 Before case study ■ Trouble-free deepening ■ A history of conflict and operations in the past slow negotiations promise another swift between Belgium and deepening operation.

The Belgian actors express an urgent pressure to deepen the estuary. However, the policy system accepts that the deepening is potentially harmful and it embarks on a two-fold strategy: a quick, singular deepening operation for now, and developing a long-term vision for the future. In doing so, it connects with both supporters of the deepening, and opponents who favor the restoration of the Westerschelde as a more 'natural' system. This introduces creative tension in the policy system. The actual deepening does not lead to immediate clear physical trends. In the Unterelbe case it becomes clear that the policy system has maneuvered itself into a position in which its regime is increasingly challenged by the pressures, both physically and socially, it has attempted to divert away in the previous years. The selections made by the policy systems backfire in several ways. In an attempt to deal with this increased pressure, some of the decision makers now start to work on a plan that looks at the development of the Unterelbe as part of a long-term, contingent development rather than solely focusing on the deepening itself. A mediation process is started in order to deal with societal resistance and in order to make plans failure proof. As a result, decision makers learn to appreciate the arguments by opponents of the deepening. However, the pressure to deepen the Unterelbe again as a quick means to economic gain remains dominant in the policy system.</page><page sequence="19">PAQ FALL 2011 327 Table 2 First cycle of coevolution in the cases Case Unterelbe Case Westerschelde Initial pressures ■ A deeper estuary for ■ A deeper estuary for economic economic competitiveness; competitiveness; ■ Possible damage to nature ■ Possible damage to nature because of deeper estuary because of deeper estuary ■ Increasing excess of ■ Need to restore the sediments and increasing estuary as a more 'natural' tidal range system; Selection ■ Connections: strong ■ Connections: ambiguous mechanisms demarcations between stance between supporters supporters and opponents and opponents of the of deepening; deepening; ■ Composition: ■ Composition: joining assimilation of supporters both supporting and of deepening; opposing groups; ■ Research: mostly absent ■ Research: mainly used to and mainly used to justify investigate how deepening; deepening should be ■ Scope: narrow and not done; changeable; ■ Scope: narrow and barely changeable; Projected ■ Quick deepening is ■ Quick deepening without attractor possible without much focus on context; contextual measures; ■ Compensation measures ■ Simple deepening deemed necessary but operation good enough; toned down; ■ Compensation measures ■ Establishment of long- perhaps necessary but term working group for suppressed in pressure to the future development; deepen; Consequences ■ Physical shift from fresh ■ A deeper Westerschelde; water discharge to flood- ■ No clear physical trends, domination; possibly sand export; ■ Doubled sediment ■ Uneasiness about possible accumulation in the ecological damage; harbor basin; ■ Strong increase of tidal range in estuary; Actual attractor ■ A changed physical ■ A changed physical system with significant system with unclear unfavorable effects; consequences; - ■ Societal resistance high; ■ Societal resistance high; The Westerschelde case shows that the deepening takes place but that dissatisfaction over the way it was done</page><page sequence="20">328 PAQ FALL 20 11 leads to a search for a comprehensive development of the estuary and its region. The openness of the policy system means that many ideas that challenge the dominant way of thinking are channeled into the decision making process, thereby altering the policy system. It leads to the establishment of a joint decision making process in which all actors, even those with contradictory goals, are allowed to deliver input. The idea that a deepening can be coupled to regeneration of the natural state of the estuary is fueled by the Port of Antwerp that establishes its own research group. Consequently, multiple researches are pitched against each other and used to explore the number of options available. The result of this, and of the attempts to grant everyone something from further development, results in a package deal that links a new deepening to extensive measures to regenerate the natural state of the estuary. Both cases show that decisions that are made define the future options available, either through expected change or through unexpected, and sometimes unwanted, effects. These are not diverted away but return to the policy system and alter their routines. In the case of the Unterelbe, the quick and singular deepening brought the physical system in a new, and unfavorable, equilibrium associated with high costs and planning setbacks. This crossed the initial intentions and pushed the decision makers in a reactive role. Part of a possible solution was to develop a long-term plan for the Unterelbe.</page><page sequence="21">PAQ FALL 2011 329 Table 3 Second cycle of coevolution in the cases Case Unterelbe Case Westerschelde Selection ■ Physical severely ■ Continuous pressure to pressures unfavorable situation; deepen more for ■ Continuous pressure to economic gains; deepen more for ■ Increasing societal economic gains; resistance against ■ Increasing societal economic utilization; resistance against ■ Ideas about combining a economic utilization; deepening with ecological regeneration; Selection ■ Connections: some minor ■ Connections: continuous mechanisms cracks in the strong debate between demarcations; supporters and opponents; ■ Composition: decision ■ Composition: making closed to establishment of a opponents but inclusion sophisticated joint of more diverse decision making process researchers; with all actors involved; ■ Research: trying to find ■ Research: aimed at solutions for the exploration but restricted unfavorable situation; by resources; ■ Scope: first signs for a ■ Scope: clear aim for a more comprehensive comprehensive development; development; Projected ■ Volatile under selection ■ A deepening without attractor pressures; extensive nature ■ Focus on a even deeper development is out of the Unterelbe; question; ■ Understanding that ■ Need to combine a additional measures are deepening with ecological necessary; restoration; ■ Balancing all interests involved; Consequences ■ Establishment of a ■ Agreement over a more mediation process; comprehensive, balanced ■ Establishment of a broad development; working group; ■ No physical changes; ■ No physical improvement ■ Clash of interests; of the Unterelbe; ■ Continuous societal ■ Continuous societal resistance; resistance; Actual attractor ■ New stable state of ■ Renewed resistance after physical system proves agreeing to deepen and to resistant to change; develop nature; ■ Societal resistance grows, ■ Stalling of all operations; despite attempts at mediation</page><page sequence="22">330 PAQ FALL 2011 The Westerschelde case shows that the policy system was already less inclined towards a singular operation. From the onset, it was clear that the decision makers felt uneasy about the decision to deepen. Therefore, they established a joint decision making process. By giving access to contradictory ideas, they channeled new ideas into the decision making process. This is different from the Unterelbe case, where the decision making process was hermetically closed. This could point at a link between openness of the decision making process and avoiding unforeseen and unwanted effects. However, an update after the conclusions of the case studies shows that the package deal that was carefully crafted in the Westerschelde case has been postponed as farmers and politicians at the national level protested against it. The case therefore came to a halt. CONCLUSIONS This research began with the observation that seemingly sound decisions could backfire somewhere else in time and space and asked the question why this happens. Common explanations cannot capture the complexity of the situation to its full extent so an alternative framework that connects decision making and its contingency in a continuous feedback loop was proposed. This coevolutionary framework shows that decision making processes are prone to patterns of reciprocal selection and that decision makers can be both architects of new stable states and victims of their own decisions. Because they are tasked to design and build the desired future of the physical system, e.g. a deeper estuary, the decision makers attempt to steer the physical system towards a new stable state. When the measures required to achieve that desired state are carried out, the physical system responds in a particular way and this response is then processed by the policy</page><page sequence="23">PAQ FALL 2011 331 systems that, pending the assessment, decides whether or not to act again. Empirically, however, it appears that the physical system does not necessarily comply with the ideals of the decision makers. Consequently, they may be subjected to multiple pressures that they can only partially control. There are, then, five aspects of decision making in coevolving systems. Firstly, it appears that although decision makers expect to make perceptible selections regarding the desired future attractor of the physical system, they are also subjected to blind selection stemming from earlier decisions that have adverse effects, and chance events outside their control. The actual physical changes bring and keep the estuaries in an attractor that yields unfavorable results or the threat that this could happen soon. In both case studies, the decision makers had to respond to these problems rather than remaining unrestrained and able to steer as they desired. In other words, the attractor basin is limited not by only by perceptible and deliberate choices made by the policy systems but, above all, by the actual physical developments - especially because the new stable states prove to be persistent. Secondly, there appears to be an erratic relationship between the selections made by the policy system and the subsequent responses by the physical systems. These responses do not evolve gradually and regularly with the actions from the policy system but instead, display a punctuated nature with changes taking place elsewhere in time and with erratic results. Therefore, the policy system could face a new situation relatively unexpectedly, especially when the new situation is unintended. The relationship between these decisions and the actual outcomes can be obscured because of the complexity of causation. Together, this often renders change unintended, unobserved and unexpected.</page><page sequence="24">332 PAQ FALL 2011 Thirdly, upon facing this uncertainty, the decision makers respond to the selection pressures stemming from these situations by altering their selection mechanisms and with that, the disposition of their policy system. By and large, there are two types of responses. Singular policy systems respond to selection pressures by connecting with those actors who support their goals and by shielding the process from those who oppose it. This results in a narrow scope of the project and consequently, in research aimed exclusively at finding the means to that end . The main reason for this approach is an attempt to keep the project under control as it is considered complex enough as it is without distracting factors or white noise. Any perceived threat to the original goal is actively diverted away. However, such an approach can be rendered intolerable if the selection pressures that were diverted backfire on the policy system in such way that it is then forced to alter its regime. The second type of policy system is characterized by a composite nature. It connects with other actors in order to expand the diversity of ideas and goals in the process. This results in a debate that questions the scope, subsequently taking into account more than one aspect of the physical system. Consequently, research is also aimed at exploring options rather than simply finding the means to an already given end. Fourthly, while the classification into singular and composite policy systems may suggest a stable dichotomy, empirically it has been observed that composite characteristics are enclosed within the singular policy system but not always unlocked. The policy systems discussed here always consist of multiple actors who create the potential for more diversity. A more composite nature is also not the final state of a policy system as it can relapse (back) into singularity, as shown in the Westerschelde case. Change or consolidation of regime is induced by actual unfavorable events or by the perceived imminent risk of</page><page sequence="25">PAQ FALL 2011 333 such changes. While a change or consolidation of a given state may be a deliberate response to the selection pressures (that could stem from earlier decisions) it has also been observed that both types of responses have the capacity to reinforce their nature unintentionally. The singular policy system is driven by its self-referential nature that reconfirms its workings while the composite policy system is driven by further dissipation in an attempt to be comprehensive. Both methods have their advantages and disadvantages with regard to the selection pressures the policy system is subjected to. However, the nature of the policy system can change partly uncontrollably as a singular policy system may not be aware of its singularity and a composite policy system may not be able to keep its diversification under control. Fifthly, when taking all points together it appears that selections and selection pressures of coevolving systems have a reciprocal quality insofar as the degree of freedom of the policy system is limited by events and developments outside the direct, perceivable and intended control of the actors within the system. Not only can the attractor basin containing the possible future states of the systems be compromised through adverse, unintended results and events, the policy systems are also only partially in control of their regime in handling the ensuing pressures. However, although the degrees of freedom of steering are limited outside its intentional control, it still is able to have an impact on the physical system. Singular policy systems have less of a chance of taking into account most of the possible future attractors of the physical system than composite systems. However, composite systems are still subjected to the characteristics that are inherent in coevolution and their composite nature does not allow them to avoid the fact that unfavorable developments can take place - it can only reduce the probability of such developments.</page><page sequence="26">334 PAQ FALL 2011 Table 4 Central features of a coevolu tionary revision of public decision making processes 1 . Public decision makers assume that they are in control of the system they want to govern. However, the future of the system is also determined by blind selection, i.e. consequences of earlier decisions that are not obvious to the decision makers, and the occurrence of chance events. 2. The relationship between decisions and outcomes in the system is erratic with changes taking place elsewhere in time and with erratic results. Together with [1] this often renders change unintended, unobserved and unexpected. 3. Decision makers respond to the pressures from [2] through singularity or composition in their decision making process, i.e. they either shield the process away from outside influences or they incorporate these influences in the process. 4. The choice between the responses in [3] is only partially intentional and controllable: the singular response is driven by its self-referential nature whilst the composite response is driven by further dissipation. 5. Taking [1-4] together: decision making has a reciprocal quality insofar that the freedom to steer is limited by events and developments outside the direct, perceivable and intended control of the decision makers; and that decision makers are only partially in control of the way they deal with the new situation. In answering the main question of this research, it seems that actors within the policy system and the dynamics of the decision making process do have an influence over the physical system but this influence is limited or distorted because of the five aspects described above. Decision makers are subjected to selection pressures from the physical system and the societal environment as much as they can exert selective pressures on them. Coevolution between the systems is therefore a matter of reciprocal selection, with the results not being fully</page><page sequence="27">PAQ FALL 2011 335 determined by intended selections made by decision makers but rather, emerging from the entire complex process of reciprocal selections.
