<plain_text><page sequence="1">68 Approaches to Passage Tomb Art Muiris O'Sullivan The approach to the study of Irish Passage Tomb art which is adopted in the recent books by O'Kelly (1982) and Eogan (1986) is set in a historical context. An independent perspective is offered, which distinguishes two principal styles of art in the Boyne Valley. Two recent publications in the Thames and Hudson series New Aspects of Antiquity represent an important milestone in the study of Boyne Valley Passage Tombs, summarizing the evidence unearthed in the large-scale excavations at Newgrange and Knowth over the past quarter of a century. One, Professor O'Kelly's Newgrange: Archaeology, Art and Legend (1982), appeared at the end of O'Kelly's excavation programme, being the definitive account of his work at Newgrange, on which it focuses exclusively. The other, Professor Eogan's Knowth and the Passage Tombs of Ireland (1986), has appeared while the Knowth excavations are still in progress and has a wider focus. The Knowth excavations have already been the subject of two interim reports (Eogan 1968; 1974) and the final report is to be a series of three monographs, one of which has already appeared (1984). The Thames and Hudson book, in summarizing what has been discovered, is ancillary to the full scientific report. However, it is more than that because, as the title implies, it also presents a review of the Irish Passage Tomb series. Hence there is a distinction in overall aim between O'Kelly (1982) and Eogan (1986). The two volumes are ideal companions on the archaeological shelf, being similar in size and layout, and complementary in general content. Just as there are distinctions in the overall aims and content of the two volumes, so there is also a distinction in the treatment of individual topics. Of these topics, megalithic art is the one with which this paper is concerned. The Newgrange book presents a corpus of the art with a survey of its principal features, both technical and formal. The Knowth book, by contrast, is mainly concerned with identifying individual 'styles' in the ornament and with exploring the significance of the location of particular motifs. While many of the decorated stones from the large tumulus are illustrated in support of points being made in the text, they do not add up to a complete corpus of the art that is known to exist there. Thus, each book presents and discusses the art according to its own purposes. Nevertheless, a broadly similar approach to Passage Tomb art informs both treatments. That approach, it will be argued here, focuses on the identification and classification of individual 'motifs'. This paper aims to place the approach in its historical context, to outline its influence on the analytical treatment of the art and to conduct a case-study which suggests that a broader approach, more sensitive to the art itself and less exclusively focused on individual elements, may be the key to a deeper understanding of Passage Tomb art.

A more complete survey of the ornament in Irish Passage Tombs, excluding the Kiltierney evidence (Wakeman 1881, 545-51), was compiled by Coffey (1912). Throughout this period, analysis and interpretation of the ornament continued apace. The individual geometric elements of the art were considered by some to be representations of the sun and of other heavenly bodies (Du Noyer 1865; Coffey 1912, 76, 88-90). An observation to which many of the nineteenth-century antiquarians referred was the apparent decoration of some stones before they were incorporated in the megalithic structures (Wakeman 1848, 27; Ferguson 1863, 403; Conwell 1872, 97-8; Wood-Martin 1895, 285). Pownall had previously suggested that C4 at Newgrange 'is a mere frag ment . . . [which] ... is of a more ancient date than the building wherein it is found', basing this suggestion on his theory that the ornamental arrangement in the lower left quadrant of the orthostat represented Phoenician numerals (1773, 259). There appears to be no independent evidence from the position of C4 in the tomb or from the position of the ornamental device on the stone to support Pownall's inference, while his ascription of the device to a system of numbers is at best speculative. On the other hand, the evidence on which the nineteenth-century antiquarians based their suggestion that some stones were decorated prior to being incorporated in the structure was the observation, frequently confirmed in the modern excavations at Newgrange and Knowth, that some of the ornament occurs in positions that are now inaccessible (Conwell 1872, 97-8). The subject was brought a step further by George Coffey who, in a series of papers published during the last decade of the century (1894; 1895a; 1895b; 1896; 1897), set out to establish the origin and development of Irish megalithic ornament. He constructed an argument for deriving Irish Passage Tomb art from Scandinavia and ultimately from the east Mediterranean area. He placed Newgrange at the beginning of the Irish series, ahead of Dowth and Loughcrew, basing this sequence on the quality of their respective spirals. The grounds on which Coffey's arguments were based have been superseded by subsequent scholarship and by the evidence of scientific dating techniques. For instance, the Scandinavian ornament from which he derived the Irish art occurred in Bronze Age contexts. This did not present any difficulty for Coffey, who dated Newgrange to the period 800-500 BC (1896, 65), but it would present insuperable difficulties today when Newgrange is perceived as a monument of the third millennium BC. It was not therefore so much his theory of development that significantly advanced the subject. Nor was it his effort to envisage Irish megalithic ornament as part of a wider tradition, for others had already observed parallels in Brittany (Ferguson 1863; Healy 1892). What set Coffey apart was his wide scholarship and, especially in his book Newgrange and Other Incised Tumuli in Ireland (1912), his ability to combine scientific description with explanatory argument without serious compromise to either. Joseph Dechelette, whose outstanding work of archaeological synthesis, the Manuel d'Archeologie (1908-13), was appearing at this time, wrote a paper on neolithic art in Europe which, while indebted to Coffey (1912) for much of the Irish evidence, proposed a different evolutionary scheme interwoven with an anthropomorphic interpretation of the ornament (Dechelette 1912). He postulated the existence of a funerary goddess, la</page><page sequence="3">70 MUIRIS O'SULLIVAN figure humaine feminine, in the neolithic ornament of western Europe. According to his scheme, the cult derived ultimately from the Aegean region and spread northwards via Iberia and the Atlantic coast of Europe including Ireland. The representations of this goddess were mainly confined to facial images and he constructed evolutionary schemes proposing to show these images becoming increasing schematized (1912, 43, Fig. 15), culminating in a 'face' at Gavrinis that consists of apparently abstract forms (1912, 47, Fig. 18). To an extent, D6chelette's theory had been foreshadowed by Borlase, when he referred to the conjoined lozenges recorded from Kiltierney as 'probably intended for human eyes' (1897, 220). In D6chelette's scheme, Irish Passage Tomb ornament belonged to a broad west European tradition incorporating the art mobilier of Iberia and Britain and the structural ornament of Brittany. Coffey, whose own evolutionary model was brought into question by this view, nevertheless referred to Dechelette's theory as 'a very probable one for the origin of the markings', while noting the difficulty which the theory posed for his own chronological scheme (1913, 103). The careful balance which Coffey attempted to retain between description and explanation is less evident in the literature of the 1920s and 1930s. During that time, the dominant personalities in the study of Irish megalithic art were M. l'Abbe Breuil and Professor R. A. S. Macalister. Principally concerned with explanation, they dealt with rock art and megalithic art as one complex. A chronological scheme was proposed, varying slightly from one publication to another, and the ornament was seen as replete with anthropomorphic imagery (Breuil and Macalister 1921; Breuil 1934). The chronological scheme was based principally on Breuil's view that the various techniques in the art followed each other sequentially. Anthropomorphic images were 'identified' on subjective grounds and, particularly in the case of Breuil, the desire to interpret led to gross inaccuracies in illustrating the art (1934, 307). The chronological scheme proposed by Breuil and Macalister did not stand the test of time. Mac White (1946) cautioned against the scheme and Crawford (1955) not only demonstrated its inconsistency on technical grounds but went on to question the validity of basing extensive chronological and cultural inferences on such a scheme. However, Breuil's anthropomorphic interpretation had a more long-term impact. Mac White (1946) did not question it, and the tables of motifs proposed by Piggott (1954, 211) and Eogan (1968, 350) derive ultimately from Breuil's 'anthropomorphic patterns' (1934). Like Breuil, Crawford (1957) and Herity (1974) were strong advocates of the anthropomorphic theory, their advocacy, like that of D6chelette, being based on an observed comparison between the motifs used in the Irish ornament and the motifs used in continental Passage Tomb designs that were considered to be anthropomorphic. The descriptive record has been greatly advanced during the past half century by the publication of decorated stones from Dowth (Leask 1933), Knowth (Macalister 1943; Eogan 1968; 1974; 1984; 1986), Baltinglass (Walshe 1941), Lyles Hill (Evans 1953), Millin Bay (Collins and Waterman 1955), Fourknocks (Hartnett 1957), Barclodiad y Gawres (Powell and Daniel 1956), the Calderstones (Forde-Johnston 1957), and Newgrange (O'Kelly, Lynch and O'Kelly 1978; O'Kelly 1982). The wealth of Passage Tomb art unearthed during the recent Newgrange and Knowth excavations and the pristine freshness of the newly excavated ornament have enabled researchers to engage in detailed studies of the techniques employed by the artists (O'Kelly, C, 1973, 9-12; Shee 1973). Shee Twohig's comprehensive survey of megalithic art in western Europe, in particular the drawings and descriptive catalogue, was a major contribution towards comparative analysis of the ornament (1981).</page><page sequence="4">APPROACHES TO PASSAGE TOMB ART 71 In general, during the past few decades, a clinical approach has been adopted in studying Passage Tomb ornament. Particularly in the case of the O'Kelly and Shee Twohig publications, attention has centred on issues like the techniques and basic forms that were employed by the artists. Non-technical and non-tangible issues, such as the artistic ideals of the tradition and the meaning of the art, have in general not been seriously probed. The standard procedure in analysing the ornament has been to propose a table of basic motifs (Piggott 1954, 211, Fig. 33; Eogan 1968, 335, Fig. 22; O'Kelly, C, 1973, 373, Fig. 11; Shee Twohig 1981, 107, Fig. 11). The difficulty with this approach is that it reduces megalithic ornament to a collection of elementary forms (formal ornament) such as circles or spirals. Non-formal ornament, such as extensive picking of the surface, is consequently excluded from such schemes of motifs and is treated merely as another picking technique rather than as an ornamental approach in its own right. As a result, such ornament tends to be considered as peripheral to what is considered the 'real' ornament. In the publication of the Newgrange art, for instance, 'areas of pick-dressing are shown as a rule only when they are integral to the ornament, as in L 19, or where they partially obliterate it, as in R8' (O'Kelly 1982, 153). Similarly, Eogan's count of decorated stones at Knowth is confined to those 'bearing recognized shapes or motifs' (1986, 148). The clinical approach, taken to extremes in these cases, has led to an observer-imposed selection of what may be accepted as Passage Tomb art. The reduction of the ornament to identifiable forms runs the added risk of dominating all discussion of the ornament. Comparisons between major centres of megalithic art in Shee Twohig (1981), for instance, are based primarily on an analysis of the basic forms that are recognized in the different centres. While such an analysis has the value of emphasising similarities and differences in the formal content of the art from one region to another, as Shee Twohig graphically demonstrated (1981, 137, Fig. 13), it need not be the only or even the major basis of comparison. It is conceivable that inter-regional contacts might equally manifest themselves in the manner of positioning and displaying the ornament in a tomb or in the actual treatment of the stone. Where compositional factors are introduced by Shee Twohig, as in distinguishing between the 'Fourknocks style' and 'Loughcrew style' in Ireland, attention focuses almost exclusively on the arrangement of individual geometrical elements. Thus in her Fourknocks style, 'the motifs are integrated to form a coherent design and are arranged to give a pleasing overall effect', while in her Loughcrew style, 'there does not appear to have been any real attempt to achieve an overall artistic effect' (1981, 106). Eogan (1986, 153-65), in his analysis of 'styles' at Knowth, was even more concerned with identifiable forms, explaining style in terms of motifs (identifiable forms) and equating 'style' with 'composition': At Knowth, some stones are decorated with the same motif or a closely similar one, which is either the sole or the predominant motif and, thus, constitutes a style or a composition. A style can consist of one motif, or there may be more than one example but occurring in a balanced manner (1986, 153). While this explanation is somewhat confusing, it nevertheless seems that Eogan's Knowth 'styles' are distinguished for the most part on the basis of the elementary forms that are used. Thus, his Style 6 is the spiral style and his Style 7 is the circular style, but there is no essential difference between Styles 6 and 7 in the manner of arranging the elements, as the author concedes (1986, 161). The 'styles' which Eogan proposed to distinguish at</page><page sequence="5">72 MUIRIS O'SULLIVAN Knowth are not styles in the usual art-historical sense as defined by, for instance, Sporre (1981) or Reynolds and Seddon (1981). For them, style is that body of characteristics that identifies an artwork with an individual, a historical period, a school of artists, or a nation (Sporre 1981, 13). Eogan does not make such claims for his styles. In his scheme, each 'style' refers to a group of designs which have compositional similarities. These similarities are chiefly identified in the elements that are used and sometimes in the manner of arranging the elements. In the chapter following his analysis of 'styles', he engaged in a most promising exercise: an analysis of the positions occupied by particular motifs, both elemental and compositional, in the structure of Passage Tombs. The results which he presented (1986, 187-95) are striking and the pattern of occurrence which they suggest in the case of selected Boyne tombs establishes a special relationship between the structures and the art. Some of the designs illustrated by Eogan, especially those on the corbels of the eastern tomb at Knowth (1986, 182, Fig. 73), would not have been visible in the normal course of events, which suggests that their function was primarily symbolic. Hence, his positional analysis is an important contribution towards explaining Passage Tomb art and it emphasises the continuing value of focusing on individual motifs. Lynch (1967), dealing with the art from Barclodiad y Gawres, blended a close technical scrutiny of the ornament with a broader appreciation of its artistic expressiveness. The relationship between individual element and overall composition was explored (1967, 2) and a distinction was drawn between architectural embellishment and religious symbolism (1967,12). However, her treatment of these variables was not always assured and some of her inferences are uncomfortable. Thus to suggest, as she did, that the art at Fourknocks seemed to indicate 'architectural embellishment rather than religious fervour' (1967, 12) is to overlook the point that such embellishment of a megalithic structure might itself be a symbol of deep religious fervour. Similarly, her conclusion that the design on Stone 5 was composed by two craftsmen, one working from the top and the other from the bottom, overstretches the evidence. But these criticisms relate to her inferences, not to her approach, and it is her approach that is important in the present context. Herity (1974, 91-115), in his treatment of Passage Tomb art, adopted an approach that is similar to that of Lynch, though more assured in its expression. Sensitive to the visual impact of the ornament, he was particularly concerned with the interaction between megalithic art and megalithic architecture. His discussion of the art is coloured by his overall thesis: that the Passage Tomb tradition arrived on the east coast of Ireland, achieved a primary flowering in the Boyne Valley, and reached inland where a further insular expression developed. Again, his treatment of the art is influenced by his leaning towards an anthropomorphic interpretation of many motifs. However, as with Lynch, it is his approach that is important here. By adopting a less inhibited attitude to the art, he was open to its compositional and symbolic complexities. Even his handling of motifs (1974, 104-5) goes beyond a technical classification. He proposed a three-tier scheme of designs, ranging from simple symbols or elements, such as circles or spirals, to developed compositions, often combining the simple elements, which he considered might be used decoratively or might have an intrinsic symbolism. Like Lynch (1967), he attempted to probe the meaning of the ornament by exploring qualities other than the basic forms that seemed manifest in it. Finally, reference to one unpublished work is desirable, the writer's MA thesis, entitled The Megalithic Art of Site 1 at Knowth and its Context in Ireland (O'Sullivan 1981a). It became apparent, in the course of preparing this work at UCD, that a large</page><page sequence="6">APPROACHES TO PASSAGE TOMB ART 73 proportion of the decoration in the western tomb did not lend itself to analysis in terms of the standard individual elements (1981a, vol. 11, 142-3). While its significance was not appreciated at the time, that observation was later to become the basis for the differentiation between styles which is to be proposed in this paper. A further problem associated with the statistical analysis of motifs was stated in a review of Dr. Shee Twohig's book (O'Sullivan 1981b, 128): it is one thing to establish that a particular element has been identified on x% of the decorated stones in Ireland, on y% of those in Brittany, and on z% of those in Iberia, but it is something else to explain what such statistics mean, if anything. No published discussion of this question has yet appeared. In concluding this brief survey of approaches, attention is drawn to the tension that has usually existed between recording the art, analysing it, and explaining it. While analysis, to be reliable, depends on accurate recording of the ornament, yet, as has been shown in the case of Newgrange, the particular analytical method being employed can influence the selection of what is to be recorded. Similarly, analysis leads towards explanation, but the form of explanation which is envisaged has an important bearing on the analytical approach. Thus, Mrs O'Kelly has stated that her scheme of motifs, that is her method of analysis, is based on the premise 'that the motifs are geometrical and non-representational' (1978, 14), which is her explanation of the ornament. The Need for a New Perspective To attempt an explanation of Irish Passage Tomb art is to focus both on the meaning of the art and on its origins and development. The foregoing survey indicates that the meaning of the art has usually been discussed in terms either of the meaning of individual elements (Du Noyer 1865; Coffey 1912, 88-90; Crawford 1957, 76) or of the meaning of particular combinations of elements (Dechelette 1912, 43, Fig. 15; Breuil 1934, 299, Fig. 12; Crawford 1957, 74; Herity 1974, 186). Recent publications have been cautious about the interpretation of the ornament (O'Kelly, C, 1973, 361; Shee Twohig 1981, 120-1; Eogan 1986, 169), possibly reacting to the impact during the middle part of this century of the excessively speculative and inherently unfounded explanations which had been offered by Breuil. Efforts to trace the origins and development of the ornament have tended to revolve around comparisons with an ornamental tradition that is perceived to have flourished along the western and north-western seaboard of mainland Europe at about the same time (Ferguson 1863, 403; Coffey 1912, 68, 112; Breuil 1934, 305; Herity 1974, 109-12; Shee Twohig 1981, 139). The review of the literature suggests that discussion both of the meaning and of the origins and development of Irish Passage Tomb art still revolves around issues which have been discussed since the early part of this century and the second half of the last. In spite of the rapid accumulation of evidence through the publication of a large body of hitherto unpublished art since the 1950s, there has been little progress towards explaining the art (O'Sullivan 1981b, 128). It seems to me that, barring unforeseen circumstances, the traditional approaches to the ornament are not likely to significantly advance our present understanding of it. The interpretative approach of Breuil and Macalister has been shown to be unreliable and the modern approach which focuses almost exclusively on an analysis of individual elements appears to be over-restrictive. It is proposed here that the way forward is not just to analyse the individual elements that are depicted on the stones and the techniques that are used in the ornamentation, as has become the standard practice, but also to</page><page sequence="7">74 MUIRIS O'SULLIVAN examine the stones as decorated objects and to be sensitive to the relationship that exists between each decorated stone and the decoration that occurs on it. The case-study which follows illustrates the possibilities of this approach towards understanding not just the development of the Irish ornament and its relationships with that of mainland Europe but also the nature of its meaning. Case-Study: A Question of Styles In the course of this study, I propose to focus in particular on the identification of artistic styles as a key towards understanding the art at Knowth and as a guide towards establishing a sequence in the Passage Tomb art of the Boyne Valley. The proposition begins with the identification of two basic styles of ornament at Knowth: a depictive style and a plastic style. It will be argued that the depictive ornament was contemporary with the construction of the large tumulus and the smaller passage tombs at Knowth. The plastic art, it will be suggested, was added, sometimes superimposed on the earlier ornament, after the megalithic structures beneath the large tumulus had been completed. Attention will be drawn to the existence of a similar sequential arrangement in the art of the large tumuli at Newgrange and Dowth. The significance of this observation will be briefly explored. However, before proceeding to the identification of styles, it seems desirable to briefly review the background to the proposition. When I first studied the decorated kerbstones at Knowth in an MA thesis, I proposed a scheme of six compositional groups (1981a, vol. 1, 170-4): Group 1: designs dominated by a large single circular motif; Group 2: designs dominated by one or more serpentiform figures; Group 3: designs based on a simple display of large-scale parallel lines or arcs; Group 4: designs based on an arrangement of circles and/or spirals, with other forms occasionally added; Group 5: designs in which various separate motifs are combined into a single com position; Group 6: designs that are distinctive and unique. I further suggested that no apparent compositional arrangement could be discerned on some of the decorated kerbstones and that the ornament on others was minimal, precluding discussion about its compositional features. The scheme which I proposed was concerned with composition, not with style, as I emphasised at the time: If the majority of compositions were not produced by one artist they evolved under the influence of a dominant unifying force or personality (1981a, vol. I, 175). This scheme retains its value as a way of ordering the decorated kerbstones, but subsequent research has revealed a more fundamental, stylistic, division in the ornament at Knowth. The nature of the relationship between the compositional scheme outlined above and the stylistic scheme which is to be proposed in this paper has not yet been fully resolved. However, it will emerge in subsequent paragraphs that compositional groups 2 and 3, at least, refer to designs which are examples of the plastic style. In 1981, the decorated stones in the western tomb proved more difficult to classify than those along the kerb (O'Sullivan 1981a, vol. I, 143-53). While conventional Irish Passage Tomb ornament was encountered throughout the tomb, it was noted that there</page><page sequence="8">APPROACHES TO PASSAGE TOMB ART 75 was something distinctive about some of the art in the inner part of the tomb. This distinctive ornament conveyed a marked sensitivity on the part of the artist to the physical form of the stone on which it was displayed. On the right side of the passage, it was manifested as unified linear designs which tended to reflect the outline of the stone and the general configuration of its surface. On the left side, this ornament usually consisted of solid picking which sometimes concentrated into identifiable lines or bands, but which more often simply followed the form of the stone along shoulders or edges. This distinctive ornament on both sides of the passage is the plastic art to which further reference will be made. Eogan has also proposed a scheme for grouping the decorated stones at Knowth. Notwithstanding the fact that his groups are termed 'styles' and that he incorporates decorated stones from elsewhere in his classificatory plan, there is more than a little similarity between his scheme of fifteen styles and my scheme of compositional groups (Eogan 1986, 153-65; O'Sullivan 1981a, vol. I, 143-50, 171-3). It has already been suggested in this paper that Eogan uses style in an unusual sense and this is emphasised by the contradiction whereby one of his 'styles' [style 15] consists of motifs which 'do not constitute a style' (1986,165) and by ambiguous statements such as 'the layout of the style is perfect' (1986,155). It was suggested in an earlier paragraph that Eogan's classificatory scheme is more concerned with the formal content than with the style of the ornament. For that reason and also for the reason that a more meaningful alternative scheme of Knowth styles is being suggested here, it may be better to regard his classification, like my earlier one, as a scheme of compositional groups rather than as a collection of styles. As Eogan has indicated, decoration occurs on surfaces that would not have been accessible after the tumulus at Knowth had been completed (1986, 150). The backs of some kerbstones, capstones, and orthostats bear ornament which cannot be distinguished in design or motif-content from what we have come to expect in Irish Passage Tomb art (Eogan 1986, PI. 56). Similar ornament also occurs on surfaces that would have been accessible after the monument had been completed (Eogan 1986, 156, Fig. 62) and on both hidden and accessible surfaces in the satellite tombs (1984, 184, Fig. 68: 2, 3). It seems acceptable to conclude that this is the ornamental tradition that pertained at the time when the tombs were being built. Because this mode of ornamentation can usually be described as the depiction of individual motifs or elements, such as spirals, circles, chevrons, or lozenges, on the surfaces of stones, frequently without any obvious attempt to produce an overall design (Eogan 1984,173, Fig. 65), I propose to term it the depictive style in order to distinguish it from the plastic style to be discussed below. Besides the standard Irish Passage Tomb depictive ornament which occurs throughout the Knowth complex, a distinctive mode of ornamentation occurs on certain stones in the eastern and western tombs and on certain kerbstones of the large tumulus. In this mode of ornamentation, the sculpturing is executed with particular sensitivity to the profile and surface configuration of the stone (Eogan 1986, PI. 11: Orthostat 49). The standard decorative vocabulary of Irish Passage Tomb art is sometimes preserved, but in many cases it is dissolved (Eogan 1986, PI. 49). The lines of the design are boldly displayed and the ornament appears to fill the face of the stone, focusing particularly on its upper half (Eogan 1986, PI. 16). This mode of ornamentation is termed the plastic style. The distinction between the styles is emphasised by the fact that, in contrast to the depictive ornament which occurs on accessible and inaccessible surfaces alike, the plastic ornament at Knowth appears to be exclusively found on surfaces which were</page><page sequence="9">76 MUIRIS O'SULLIVAN still accessible after the structure had been completed. In the case of the orthostats, it occurs on surfaces which face the tomb and passage and it appears never to extend onto areas of the surface that are inaccessible. Similarly, it occurs only on the front and occasionally on the top of the kerbstones. Any ornament that has been found on the backs of the kerbstones belongs to the depictive style. The most clearcut example of the plastic ornament in the Knowth satellite tombs occurs on a sillstone in the satellite tomb, Knowth 4, which arguably would have been accessible after the tomb had been constructed (Eogan 1984, 161, PI. 43b). There may well be some significance in the fact that this tomb, of all the satellites at Knowth, has a stone setting outside the entrance just as the two tombs in the main tumulus have. In many instances, the plastic ornament occurs on the same stone as the depictive ornament, in which cases it is invariably superimposed on the depictive ornament. That the plastic ornament is the later imposition can be inferred from the fact that the application in bold lines of the plastic ornament usually interrupted the lines of the depictive ornament, leaving them visible only in the surface between the lines of the plastic ornament. For instance, the application of the plastic ornament on Kerbstone 11 at the entrance to the eastern tomb has partially obliterated the line of a pre-existing spiral in the lower left-hand quadrant (Eogan 1986, PI. 16; 194, Fig. 83). Similarly the depictive ornament on Orthostats 41, 44, 48 and 49 in the western tomb can be seen to have been partially removed by the application of the plastic ornament (Eogan 1986, PI. 49). The plastic ornament is usually more prominent in scale and in general display, so that the depictive ornament tends to recede and blend into the surface. Close scrutiny of the plastic ornament has revealed that it seldom extends to within 30cm of the bottom of the stone, which is consistent with the suggestion that it was applied after the orthostats and kerbstones had been placed in position. When the plastic ornament is presented as a two-dimensional drawing, it may sometimes seem to be compositionally incomplete, especially on the lower part of the stone (Eogan 1986, Fig. 83, 84). This observation emphasises the plasticity of the ornament: it is not simply a depiction of something on a stone but the enhancement of a three-dimensional form, and it cannot be fully appreciated in two dimensions. It seems clear that visual impact was an important factor in the application of this plastic ornament. In the passages of both the eastern and western tombs, for instance, the plastic ornament tends to focus towards the side of the orthostat which is visible as one enters along the passage. The drawings show that the designs along the right side of the passage, especially in the western tomb, tend to gravitate towards the right side of the stone and even onto the right-hand side face (Eogan 1986, Fig. 83, 84). The plastic designs vary in sophistication from developed curvilinear compositions such as those on Or. 44 and Or. 49 in the western tomb and on Or. 69 in the eastern tomb to simple repeating lines as on Or. 34 in the western tomb and Or. 47 in the eastern tomb (Eogan 1986, Fig. 83, 84). The western entrance stone bears a design of boxed sub-rectangles, which echoes the outline of its obverse face, the central vertical line being technically and compositionally intrusive (Eogan 1986, PI. 8). The eastern entrance stone has a similar design which focuses around two prominent bulges on the surface (Eogan 1986, PI. 16). The decoration on the backstone in the eastern tomb is similarly centred on a swelling in the surface, a feature which can also be noted in the case of Or. 44 in the western tomb (Eogan 1986, Fig. 84). Nonetheless, the layout of the ornament on these two stones, as on the western entrance stone and on the decorated sillstone, reflects the general outline of the face.</page><page sequence="10">APPROACHES TO PASSAGE TOMB ART 77 Some of the designs which belong to the plastic style retain vestiges of the standard Passage Tomb motifs. Others seem to reflect an abandonment of these individual motifs. Orthostat 41, standing in the chamber of the western tomb, has a design based on picking away extensive parts of the surface over the upper part of the face, taking due account of features such as the cupmark and hollow at the top. This particular design emphasises an interplay of picked and unpicked surfaces (Eogan 1986, PI. 49). The more extreme expressions of the style lead to statistical problems in counting the occurrence of decorated stones. For instance, many orthostats in the eastern and western tombs and some of the kerbstones bear concentrated picking which is similar to that on Orthostat 41 but which is confined to the edges between surfaces (e.g., between the obverse and upper face) or which cannot be classified as either a line or a geometric shape. Understandably, in the light of the traditional approach to Passage Tomb ornament, Eogan excludes some of these from his count of decorated stones. But such picking is integral to the plastic style and can no longer be excluded from an analysis of the art at Knowth. A further development of the ornament occurs in the western tomb where virtually every stone in the chamber area has been modified by dispersed picking of the surface (Eogan 1986, PI. 48). The picking may be dispersed but it is not haphazard and, in the case of some stones, it is spread evenly over the surface. Close scrutiny reveals that this picking, like the superimposed ornament which has already been discussed, does not extend onto inaccessible surfaces, from which it may be inferred that it was applied after the structure had been completed. This dispersed picking attempts to 'decorate' the whole wall space of the tomb, which represents a significant development from ornament which focuses on individual stones. The distinction between a depictive style and a plastic style of ornamentation is not as clearly established on the kerbstones as it is on the structural stones of the tomb interiors. This is so partly because the ornament on the kerbstones is largely based on the standard vocabulary of elements such as serpentiform lines and other curvilinear devices, whereas these elements seldom occur in the superimposed ornament of the tomb interiors. Nevertheless, it is possible to distinguish a certain superimposition of ornament on many decorated kerbstones (Eogan 1986, PI. 45, 59, 70). The superimposed ornament dominates the pre-existing ornament in its scale, in the technique by which it is applied, and in the attitude towards the stone that it seems to imply. By contrast with the pre-existing ornament, it tends to take account of the configuration of the stone, to be on a scale which is commensurate with the size of the stone itself, and to be applied using the same repertoire of techniques that is characteristic of the plastic ornament in the tombs. Kerbstone 17 provides a good example of the superimposed ornament, in this case a boldly depicted serpentiform line wending its way across the belly of the stone and cutting through a spiral which is applied in the depictive style (1986, PI. 59). The serpentiform figure on Kerbstone 13 provides another example (1986, PI. 70). Boldly displayed large-scale ornamentation is superimposed on smaller-scale ornament on at least Kerbstones 11, 13, 29, 73, 79, and 84. In addition, ornamentation which consists of concentrated picking along surface features rather than the depiction of particular motifs occurs on at least Kerbstones 1, 7, 8, 10, 12, 73, and 75. Furthermore, the disposition of the ornament on some of the kerbstones is closely related to the contours and outline of the decorated face (Eogan 1986, PI. 8, 16, 57, 73). From these observations it seems that much of the superimposed ornament on the kerbstones has plastic qualities while the pre-existing ornament seems to lack such qualities, indicating that the plastic ornament on the kerbstones may be part of the superimposed tradition. In contrast to</page><page sequence="11">78 MUIRIS O'SULLIVAN the standard depictive ornament, neither superimposition of ornament nor a plastic style of ornamentation has been found on surfaces that became inaccessible when the tumulus was completed. It is conceivable, therefore, that all of the large-scale designs which can be seen to dominate the kerbstones on which they occur may belong to a superimposed phase during which a plastic style of ornamentation evolved. However, this question must be left open pending further investigation. All of the designs which Eogan assigned to the 'rectilinear' class, his Style 3 (1986, 156-7), belong to the plastic style, though his concern was with the two-dimensional structure of the ornament and not with its plastic qualities. Similarly, most of the designs in his Style 4, 'large nested arcs', are examples of the plastic style. This is clearly evident in the case of Kerbstone 2 (1986, PI. 57), where the large arcs are slung across the belly of the stone almost like contours, filling the available surface, in contrast to the smaller scale of the depictive art which can also be seen on the same stone. Some of the ornament which, because it cannot be described in terms of 'recognised shapes or motifs', is excluded from his analysis of the art (1986, 148), can be considered a part of the plastic ornament on the basis that it is inseparable in style, location and aspect from the established examples of plastic decoration. Orthostats 28,29,31, and 39 in the eastern tomb may be cited as examples. Besides occurring on the structural stones as discussed above, the plastic ornament also occurs on a number of non-structural stones. The decorated sandstone block which was found near the entrance to Site 12 is an example of the plastic style applied in the round (1986, 147). One of the stones that occur in front of the entrance to the western tomb is extensively picked in the plastic mode. The basin in the right-hand recess of the eastern tomb is another example which is decorated in the round. While it would appear that this stone was placed in the recess before the chamber was completed, a small area of undecorated surface is visible underneath the basin suggesting that the basin may well have been decorated in situ. The other basins at Knowth and, with less confidence, isolated stone number 7 (Eogan 1984, 201, PI. 64b) may also be examples of the plastic style of decoration. Elsewhere in the Boyne Valley, plastic ornament occurs in the large tumuli at Newgrange and Dowth. At Newgrange, as at Knowth, large-scale designs which utilise standard decorative motifs occur on the kerb, but, in contrast to Knowth, they are confined to three kerbstones, Kl, K52 and K67. These designs manifest a respect for the stones on which they occur. For instance, the integrated spiral designs, one covering the whole front of Kl and the other occupying one facet of K52, occur on the stones which have rounded surfaces, while the panels of lozenges on K52 and K67 occur on flat surfaces. Again, the design on the right side of K52 focuses around natural cupmarks in a manner which is reminiscent of the design on K83 at Knowth (Eogan 1986,164, Fig. 71). The comparisons with Knowth are emphasised by the occurrence of the central vertical line on Kl and K52 at Newgrange and on Kll and K74 at Knowth. Perhaps the strongest indication that these designs at Newgrange correspond to the bold ornament which was superimposed over the small-scale pictorial ornament on the Knowth kerbstones is the fact that they are considered to have been applied in situ, the extensive 'dressing' of the surface and the geometric design both ending along a horizontal line some distance from the bottom of both Kl and K52. The picking of the surface enhances rather than ignores the appearance of the elements that are depicted, which is consistent with the conclusion that it was part of the ornamentation rather than a superimposition. On K52 and on K67, there appears to have been, in addition to the boldly displayed and</page><page sequence="12">APPROACHES TO PASSAGE TOMB ART 79 large-scale plastic ornament, a lighter application of depictive ornament. The sequential arrangement seems to be somewhat ambiguous in the case of K67, where the two small serpentiform figures appear to be framed in the lozenges of the plastic ornament, but it is possible that the plastic ornament was arranged around the depictive ornament. In addition to the plastic designs which are based on standard motifs and which were further enhanced by extensive picking of the surface, there are some stones at Newgrange on which all-over picking seems to have been applied. This form of picking is particularly common on the kerbstones in the vicinity of the entrance and on the orthostats along the passage. That it was associated with the application of the all-over design on the entrance stone has already been suggested. As in the case of the plastic ornament at Knowth, this picking tends to end about 30cm from the floor. The application of the extensive picking sometimes partially obliterated pre-existing depictive ornament (O'Kelly 1982, PI. 76) and in a few cases it seems to have deliberately avoided the depictive ornament (O'Kelly 1982, PI. 74). When it does not extend over the greater part of the face, the picking tends to focus along natural edges (O'Kelly 1982, Fig. 41: L22). Finally, the extensive picking appears to be confined to surfaces that were accessible when the megalithic structure had been completed, as has already been noted (O'Kelly 1982, 150). From these obser vations, therefore, it appears that concentrated non-formal picking of the surface was an extension of the plastic style at Newgrange as at Knowth. A similar superimposition of extensive picking over pre-existing depictive ornament occurs on the stones forming the walls of the recess of the smaller Passage Tomb at Dowth. It is suggested therefore that, at all three large tumuli, a two-phase sequence of ornamentation can be inferred: an initial application of depictive ornament which was contemporary with the building of the monuments and a subsequent application of plastic ornament, apparently when the structures were complete. In proposing that two styles can be identified and that one of them tends to precede the other, I am not suggesting that the two styles are mutually exclusive. On the contrary, the evidence from the Knowth and Newgrange kerbstones, where it is not possible clearly to differentiate one from the other except on the basis that one is superimposed and tends to be plastic in character, is that the plastic style may well have evolved from the depictive style. That such a development might have taken place in the Boyne area need not surprise when it is taken into consideration that there are almost as many decorated stones along the kerb of the large Knowth tumulus as there are in the whole cemetery at Loughcrew and that the total of decorated stones in the Boyne Valley exceeds the Iberian and Breton totals added together. The decoration of the kerbstones and of the interiors of the tombs would have required an intensive input of artistic endeavour, providing opportunity for developments in the style of the art. Secondly, a strong case can be made for contacts between the builders of the Boyne tombs and their counterparts in Iberia (Eogan 1979, 5-6) and Brittany (Herity 1974,192-8). Such contacts would presumably have generated fresh artistic ideas. In fact, it will be suggested in a later paragraph that the developed or plastic Knowth style has close affinities with the continent,especially Brittany. While it is not easy to assign every individual design unambiguously to one style or the other, a large percentage of the designs can be so assigned and strong arguments can be proposed for assigning others. For instance, in the chambers of both large Knowth tombs and of Dowth South, there are designs consisting of a panel of lozenges combined with other elements which cover the whole front of the stone (O'Kelly, C. 1973, 360, Fig. 4; Eogan 1986, PL 52). The surface of the lozenges may be picked away or, where</page><page sequence="13">80 MUIRIS O'SULLIVAN the design consists of interlocking lozenges, alternate lozenges may be left unpicked to bring out the texture on the picked ones. Such designs have properties that relate to the depictive style. There is some evidence, however, that they are part of the superimposed tradition. In the first instance, they tend to spread over the whole face of the stone. Furthermore, the pattern of lozenges and triangles on Orthostat 40 in the western tomb at Knowth seems to have been superimposed on a circle and some chevrons in the upper left quadrant. Besides, extensive picking of the surface occurs in addition to the picking within the geometric shapes (Eogan 1986, 189, Fig. 77). Further evidence for assigning these stones to the superimposed style occurs on stone A, a sillstone, from the satellite tomb, Knowth 4. On one face of this sillstone, there is ornament which has been assigned to the plastic style. The reverse face has a panel of alternating picked and unpicked lozenges which occupies the upper part of the face. There is also a line of picking which is evidently an extension of the design that occurs on the opposite face and on the top of the stone. The application of the panel of lozenges partially obliterated a pre-existing incised design. Neither the panel of lozenges with their interiors alternatively picked away, which occurs on one face, nor the composition of arcs which extends over three of the faces can be satisfactorily paralleled in the decoration from any of the other satellite tombs. It seems, therefore, that the large panel of lozenges can also be assigned to the superimposed style (Eogan 1984, Fig. 62, PI. 43). By analogy, C6 and C7 in the chamber of Dowth South may well belong to the superimposed style also. There is one further decorated stone which can, with some justification, be assigned to this plastic style. I refer to the macehead unearthed in the chamber of the eastern tomb at Knowth (Eogan and Richardson 1982). This macehead, though on a much smaller scale than the structural stones, is decorated in the intermediate idiom in which identifiable geometric forms are represented and displayed with great sensitivity to the shape of the object on which they are applied. The ornament consists of spirals and lozenges integrated into a single design which extends over all six faces of the object. Even the perforation through the body of the macehead is incorporated into the design. The integration of spirals and lozenges into a unified design can be paralleled in the art on Kl, K52 and K67 at Newgrange which has already been assigned to the plastic style. This macehead provides further evidence for international contacts. The connection of two spirals, spectacle fashion, is a motif which is distinctive of the Calderstones art and the ornament on the Scottish passage tombs rather than of the standard Irish tradition. In discussing the macehead, Eogan and Richardson (1986,125-31) noted that maceheads were a feature of the Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age in Britain. Finally, the ornament on the macehead is somewhat anthropomorphic in appearance. The lozenges might be interpreted to represent hair, the pair of conjoined spirals the eyes, the perforation a mouth, and possibly the lateral spirals ears. The anthropomorphic images on the cylinders in Iberia are represented in a similarly schematic form, using slightly different geometric elements (Almagro 1973, Fig. 22-4). That there may be some connection between the decoration on the Knowth macehead and the anthropomorphic decoration on objects from the Iberian tombs is not necessarily a far-fetched theory, as Eogan's excavations have discovered objects at Knowth which can be closely paralleled in south-western Iberia (1979, 5-6). It must also be emphasised, however, that the most distinctly plastic ornament at Knowth, the decoration on the orthostats in the inner part of both long passages, is closely similar to the ornament on the angled Passage Tombs in Brittany. In particular, it can be compared with the ornament from Goerem (Shee Twohig 1981, Fig. 134-6), from</page><page sequence="14">APPROACHES TO PASSAGE TOMB ART 81 Les Pierres Plates (1981, Fig. 143-8), and from Poulguen (1981, Fig. 161-3). At these sites, as at Knowth, the ornament is boldly depicted and it tends to fill the upper part of the stone. There are also more detailed points of comparison. On stone C29 at Goerem (Shee Twohig 1981, Fig. 135), for instance, a curved motif is drawn across under a pair of oculus-like arcs in a manner which is closely paralleled on Orthostat 49 in the western tomb at Knowth, on Orthostat 69 in the eastern tomb at Knowth, and incidentally on Orthostat Lll at Gavrinis. Similarly, the ornament on L6 at Poulguen (Shee Twohig 1981, Fig. 162) is closely paralleled on Orthostat 50 and 68 and on the decorated jamb-stone in the eastern tomb at Knowth. Even the inverted U occurs in each case. Finally, there is an aspect of the art which, with the exception of Herity (1974, 91-103), is usually neglected: the manner of presenting the ornament on the stone. Some of the shields at Les Pierres Plates are arranged in positions where they have a particularly striking effect. For instance, in the case of L2 at Les Pierres Plates, two shields occur on a particularly smooth facet which faces towards the entrance of the tomb rather than across the passage, but they only become visible as one passes LI which lies slightly forward of L2. Since this feature recurs elsewhere in the tomb, for instance on Lll, it is presumably not coincidental (Shee Twohig 1981, Figs. 143, 144). Sometimes, as in the case of Mane Bras, the architecture of the tomb is designed to focus attention on the decorated stone. At Mane Bras (Shee Twohig 1981, Fig. 83), subtle architectural promptings at the entrance to the chamber direct the attention of anyone entering along the passage towards the left side of the chamber where the only piece of ornamentation in the tomb is found: a shield-like element on the front of a pillar which stands in the chamber. A similar architectural focusing, sometimes on decorated stones and sometimes on stones which have significantly distinctive shapes, occurs in other Breton tombs. There is also a relationship between the art and the architecture at Knowth, Newgrange, and Fourknocks (Eogan 1986, 182). Attention has already been drawn to the manner in which the plastic ornament in the Knowth tombs appears to have been designed for visual effect in relation to its structural location, to which it may be added that Orthostat 49 in the western tomb occurs in a structurally significant place, on the right side just inside the outer sillstone. Orthostat 69 in the eastern tomb, which is comparable in ornamentation, occupies an almost identical position. C29 at Goerem, which has already been compared with these two in its ornament, is identically placed. If the comparisons with Brittany are as close as they seem, the old theory of anthropomorphism has to be resurrected. Shee Twohig has suggested that the ornamental motifs on the angled passage tombs are developed versions of the so-called anthropomorphic bucklers which occur in the earlier tombs (1981, 60-3). The plastic ornament in the Boyne Valley, if the arguments relating it to the ornament of the angled passage tombs in Brittany are valid, presumably participates in the anthropomorphic imagery. Herity had already suggested this (1974, 112). It presents an interesting situation. A tentative case has now been made for considering two separate expressions of the plastic style at Knowth as anthropomorphic in their imagery. One, the decoration on the macehead, utilises standard Passage Tomb elements to suggest the image of a head and face in a manner which can be paralleled in Iberia. The other, the plastic ornament on the orthostats in the tombs, is marked by the dissolution of such motifs and it can be compared with the anthropomorphic ornament of the angled Passage Tombs in Brittany. It is almost as if new artistic ideas and an enriched, or from another viewpoint a disintegrating anthropomorphic symbolism began to appear in the superimposed ornament of the Boyne Valley. This observation has</page><page sequence="15">82 MUIRIS O'SULLIVAN implications for our understanding of the development of Irish Passage Tomb art, but it requires a more extensive explication than is possible within the confines of this paper. If the observations and arguments which have been cited in this section are sustainable, they suggest that Irish Passage Tomb art need not always remain unexplained, provided that the study of the subject does not become too narrow in its focus. On the other hand, it would be premature to claim that the full subtlety of the relationship between what I have termed the depictive and plastic styles has been completely developed here, as many of the issues which have been raised require further development. Nevertheless, by identifying two significantly distinct styles and by going some way towards establishing a sequential relationship between them, this paper may have begun to provide another perspective on Passage Tomb art.
