<plain_text><page sequence="1">From the Romance Tradition to Modernist Writing: F. Scott Fitzgerald's "More Than Just a House" Pascale Antolin Ours is a world of words. - Edgar Allan Poe, "Al Aaraaf" (1223) One writes to make a home for oneself on paper. - Alfred Kazin (qtd. in Chandler 2) !P ublished in the Saturday Evening Post on 24 June 1933, "More Than Just a House" is not one of Fitzgerald's most popular stories, though it is said to be the "last important story he wrote for the maga- zine" ( Stories 714). It is a traditional Post story, with all the conventional ingredients: ambition and success, youth and love, and, above all, a happy ending. However, the title is unusual, even somewhat puzzling, insofar as - beyond the referent, namely, the house - it seems to suggest some additional meaning that the reader is expected to discover. The question is, therefore, if it is not "just a house," what is it then? Or, to put it differently, to what else does the house refer? It soon appears that the Gunther house is not merely a setting for the story but the cornerstone, in that Fitzgerald pursues some of the experiments - in the field of symbolism particularly - that he conducted in previous works such as The Great Gatsby. The symbolic role played by The F. Scott Fitzgerald Review 2004 72</page><page sequence="2">From Romance to Modernist Writing: "More Than Just a House" 73 the house is reminiscent of a powerful tradition in American literature that dates back to Puritan theology in which the home was regarded as a moral and spiritual center. That tradition is embodied by writers as diverse as Hawthorne, James,1 Cather, Wharton, Faulkner, and, more recently, Toni Morrison in Beloved, to mention only a few. In her book Dwelling in the Text, Marilyn R. Chandler writes that "in many of our major novels, a house stands at stage center as a unifying symbolic structure that represents and defines the relationships of the central characters to one another, to themselves, and to the world" ( 1 ). However, it is not a tradition that readers usually associate with Fitzgerald, since, as Chandler further explains, it is in fact "a conflation of two traditions, the puritanical and the gothic, the one essentially moral or religious, the other psychological and secular" (18).2 Fitzgerald is not considered part of either of these traditions. How- ever, I would argue that his inspiration for "More Than Just a House" comes from the romance tradition - Edgar Allan Poe's "The Fall of the House of Usher" (1839) and Nathaniel Hawthorne's The House of the Seven Gables ( 1 85 1 ), in particular - which involves, as Hawthorne wrote in the preface to The House of the Seven Gables, "a certain latitude, both as to . . . fashion and material, which [the writer] would not have felt himself entitled to assume, had he professed to be writing a Novel" (1). The romance writers concern with "latitude"3 can be paralleled with Fitzgerald's effort to free himself from pure referentiality,4 even though the ultimate purpose of each artist is widely different. Fitzgerald is not keen on "representing another world," to quote Melville.5 There is no transcendental or metaphysical dimension to his work; he is simply intent on suggesting that the real can hardly be reached or represented by fic- tion. The most reliable anchoring for fiction, therefore, is fiction itself6 and, despite its romantic inspiration, Fitzgerald's writing is essentially modernist. "More Than Just a House" is divided into three different episodes corresponding to three different periods in the life of Lew Lowrie, the hero, and four different visits he pays to the Gunther house - first in 1925 (in June, then in September) when he is twenty-six, next during the summer of 1929, and then during the summer of 1933 - each mo- ment in time being devoted to one of the three Gunther sisters. Both the chronological evolution and the hero's shift from one sister to another</page><page sequence="3">74 Pascale Antolin stand in sharp contrast to, and in this way put the stress on, the unity of place. However, while all three episodes take place at the Gunther house in Maryland, the hero appears to go through a process of discovery of the place and its inhabitants. His first visit is mostly set on the Gunthers' veranda and in their garden, which is somehow on the threshold of their bright universe since "the ten thousand a year that Lew had come to command did not permit an indiscriminate crossing of social frontiers" ( Stories 717). Note the space metaphor used significantly here as if to direct the readers attention to the main focus of the story. It is on the occasion of the hero's second visit in September that he is allowed in, but to talk to Amanda he takes her to his "chosen segment of the porch" (718). His mostly exterior position at this stage exempli- fies the social gap between himself and the Gunthers. Though Lew is a promising young man, he does not belong in their world of wealth and leisure, a world embodied by a house to which he hardly has access. As he says, "the Gunthers were a haughty family - haughty beyond all logic, because Mr. Gunther had once been presented at the Court of St. James's" (716). This is confirmed by Amanda's attitude, since, initially at least, she looks down on him. As a consequence, Lew Lowrie, as his name suggests, finds himself in an inferior position and on the sidelines. It is not until his third visit, when he is seeing Jean, that he is given full access to the house and is ironically accommodated in Amanda's old room. By then the young man has become "a serious businessman" (72 1) who can afford to "hire a limousine for the long ride out to Car- roll County" (723). In contrast, Mrs. Gunther is dead, Mr. Gunther is "not well," and "there [is] a rather intangible neglect about [the house]" (723). In other words, there seems to be some kind of inverted evolution between the young man and the Gunther family. While he is on his way up and stands for the future, they represent an irretrievable past and are on their way down, as is confirmed by a series of significant events during the night Lew spends in the house. A violent thunderstorm destroys the lean-to, nearly killing the black butler, which may be a sign that the old (Southern) order is under threat. Then Lew realizes that Mr. Gunther is losing his mind, learns of Amanda's death in childbirth, and eventually discovers that Jean has been drinking. The degradation experienced by the family is not only economic, therefore; it is also physical, mental, and, above all, moral. At the end of the episode, though Lew has at last</page><page sequence="4">From Romance to Modernist Writing: "More Than Just a House" 75 kissed a Gunther girl and could easily win her, he is happy to leave the place and its inhabitants. His fourth visit to the Gunther house marks the ultimate stage in the degradation experienced by the family. This time Lew discovers "a desperately forlorn house" and "a jungled garden" (731). The place is now empty; only Bess lives there. In fact, because the family has nearly disappeared, the house is not just in ruins; it hardly belongs to the Gun- thers any more. The house then is not simply the main setting for the story; it mirrors the Gunther family and its dissolution. Freud has pointed out that, in dreams, universally, "the one typical . . . representation of the human figure as a whole is a house" (196), while Bachelard in The Poet- ics of Space writes that "there is ground for taking the house as a tool for analysis of the human soul" since "our soul is an abode" (xxxvii; emphasis in original). It is not the first time that Fitzgerald has used the house as a symbol this way. In The Great Gatsby, in particular, the eponymous hero's mansion "is in [him] as much as [he is] in [it]" (Bachelard xxxvii). Right from the beginning, the anthropomorphic dimension of the house is underlined metaphorically by "a thin beard of raw ivy." The "colossal" mansion stands for Gatsby s wealth and power, though it also suggests his situation as a déclassé parvenu - it is only a "factual imitation" (11), while the metaphoric beard calls to mind disguise and illusion. In fact, all the houses in the novel speak of their inhabitants, in particular of their position on the social scale.7 However, later in chapter 8, Gatsby s house turns into a premonition of his coming defeat and death,8 while, at the end, when Gatsby is dead and Nick is about to leave West Egg, he refers to it as "that huge incoherent failure of a house" (171). At this point not only has the house metonymically turned into an abstraction, "a failure" (that is, Gatsby s), the adjective "incoherent" further suggests that it does not make sense any longer. A signifier deprived of its signi- fied, it has become meaningless. Similarly, in "More Than Just a House," the identification between the house and its inhabitants is underlined by anthropomorphic adjectives. In a passage that comes immediately after a reference to Bess, who is said to look like her sister Amanda, Lew describes the "fickle gables" ( Stories 716) (an interesting adjective since it suggests instability, inconstancy), thus suggesting that the place also can be regarded as an extension of the girls - and of the family in general.</page><page sequence="5">76 Pascale Antolin However, things soon turn out to be more complex when it ap- pears that the Gunther house does not shelter a truly united family. For Amanda, the house stands more for imprisonment than for paradise: "I'll get away from this old barn. . . . This - shack," she says (719). The house is the main reason why she marries; her marriage is therefore mostly a means of escape: "This old tomb! That's the chief reason I'm marrying George Horton. Haven't I stood it for twenty years? Haven't I begged mother and father on my knees to move into tpwn?" (719). The house is not just a complex sign; it can also be considered to be a kind of mask, which conceals and reveals simultaneously. For Jean, the second Gunther sister, similarly, it is a "mouse trap" (720) more than a house.9 What emerges is a discrepancy between the older generation and the younger one: "[I] t was the house of a childhood from which the three girls were breaking away, the house of an older generation, sufficient unto them" (720). And yet the hero "fe[els] a kinship with it" (721). Thus the house not only stands for the Gunthers, their differences, and the process of degradation they experience. It also provides a mirror image of Lew's progress. The subjective value of the place is emphasized on the oc- casion of his third visit in 1929, when Fitzgerald uses the oxymoronic phrase, "a small, big house" (723). But as early as his first visit, Lew says on leaving that it seemed to him "one of the finest houses he had ever known" (716), and, later, "It was more than just a house" (717), as if it meant something special to him. Soon he discovers the reason for that: "[H]e did not tell her that he had analyzed the spell which the Gunther house exerted upon him - his father had been gardener on a similar Maryland estate when he was a boy of five" (717). In other words, the Gunther house brings him back to his own past, or, as Bachelard puts it, to his own "cradle"10 - hence his attachment both to the place and its inhabitants. But the Gunther house also reminds him that he was a poor man's son in a rich man's residence. From this point of view, the ultimate degradation of the house may be regarded as a signal that Lew has now outgrown, or overcome, the past, represented in the story by the Gunthers and their possessions - Mr. Gunthers collection of old spoons, for instance (7 1 6) - all the more as the hero can now afford both the house and the third Gunther girl. Indeed, from beginning to end, in the eyes of Lew, the house is</page><page sequence="6">From Romance to Modernist Writing: "More Than Just a House" 77 closely associated with the girls, who seem not just to belong to it but to be part of it - Amanda first, whose name clearly refers to love, and then Bess, the second best, who seems to be a sort of double of her sister. No sooner has he mentioned his fathers job as a gardener than Lew evokes the Gunther garden "with Amanda one of its own flowers in her flowered dress" (71 7). This underlines, even exposes, the métonymie link between the house and the girls. It is unnecessary here to note either Fitzgerald's habit of associating most of his heroines with flowers or the fact that the garden is one of his most recurrent representations of femininity. Suffice it to say that the garden is mentioned both at the beginning of the story, associated with Amanda, and at the end, when Lew and Bess leave: "Backing through the clogging weeds of the garden, Lew looked at the house over his shoulder" (733), as if to suggest a circular pattern.11 In fact, from the opening flowers to the closing weeds,12 Lew seems to have made a journey from innocence to experience, with the Gunther house as a key stage in his learning process. Nevertheless, at the end, the house and the past it stands for are clearly behind him, hence his somewhat derogatory last sentence: "Next week or so we'll decide what to do about that" (733). The Gunther house is not just the focal point in the story, therefore; it is also an entirely malleable sign, whose significance changes from one time period and from one character to another. This semantic flexibility is all the more perceptible as Fitzgerald displays his effects - "Amanda one of its own flowers in her flowered dress" (717) being a good example of this quasi-systematic process of emphasis. It is as if Fitzgerald not only overindulged in his power to manipulate words and multiply mean- ings - flowers commonly suggesting the feminine sex as well as an artist's production - but also wanted every reader to be fully aware of his doing so. Note the number of allusions to houses and apartments; each of the three parts begins with such a reference - part 2: "although the apart- ment, or rather the string of apartments and penthouses pressed into service for the affair" ( 7 2 1 ) . 1 3 The semantic instability that characterizes the story is emphasized both by the dynamic process to which it runs parallel (the social and emotional progress of the hero), by a recurrent pattern of repetition (the three years, the three sisters, the three parts that make up the story), and even by doubling effects (the resemblance between Amanda and Bess, the two rescues, as well as the return of</page><page sequence="7">78 Pascale Antolin Lew's past). All these effects ultimately result in a sense of confusion as to identity, as to time, and, above all, as to meaning. § One way to clarify the meaning of Fitzgerald's story is to draw a parallel with "The Fall of the House of Usher," since Poe's tale appears to have been a major source of inspiration for the novelist. In both cases, not only are the houses at the very center of the stories, they are also emblematic of their inhabitants. Moreover, each is concerned with the evocation of a hero's "journey." However, while Roderick Usher's is what Richard Wilbur calls "a journey into the depths of the self' (qtd. in Regan 108) 14 - that is, a psychological and spiritual journey - Lew Lowrie's is a journey toward wealth and love, a discovery of the material world. More specifically, both stories are characterized by close metaphorical relationships that connect the house with the characters and with the text itself. From this point of view, "More Than Just a House" also calls to mind The House of the Seven Gables in that, in Hawthorne's work too, the house is a symbolic space. It is particularly significant that Fitzgerald might have been influenced by Poe and Hawthorne, as both writers at- tempted to turn their backs on mere referentiality, or rather privileged fiction over pure fact, invention over imitation. As Chandler writes, "Hawthorne warned readers against literal-minded comparisons between the fictional house and its prototype or between Salem and the old New England town' of his story by insisting on the term romance to describe his literary objectives" (65; emphasis in original). Hawthorne used to his own advantage the common notion at the time that the world was a text demanding to be deciphered.15 As in Poe's tale, this explains the striking analogies between the structure of his story and the structure of the house represented in the story, the three sections corresponding to the three-story house (note the interesting ambiguity of the word "story"), and also to the three inhabitants. Hawthorne's fore- grounding of the text, however, also exemplifies the doubts and questions experienced by most writers at the time concerning their medium, the source of its power, and its place in society. Being a "romancer" indeed meant, as Michael D. Bell explains, "cross [ing] the boundaries of official nineteenth century orthodoxy" (30), which privileged the actual over</page><page sequence="8">From Romance to Modernist Writing: "More Than Just a House" 79 the imaginary. In the case of Hawthorne, it consisted of trying to find some middle ground between the two - "a neutral territory, somewhere between the real world and fairy-land," as he wrote in the preface to The Scarlet Letter, "The Custom-House" (66). Fitzgerald also tried to find a middle ground between referentiality and self-referentiality. Although referentiality always seems to prevail in his fiction, it is also undermined by self-referentiality. It should not surprise us that Fitzgerald might have turned to romancers for inspiration. He too lived in a period when writers were confronted with questions as to the possibility that language could rep- resent reality16 - hence, in the story, he expresses a continual tension between highly referential details (such as time, place, or food [715]) and a visible debunking of referentiality, such as "This was back in 1925, before the Spanish-American . No, before whatever it was that has happened since then" (715). Similarly, when he describes the Gunther house, Fitzgerald often resorts to metaphors that draw the readers at- tention to the semantic ambiguity of the place: "This was on the very wide, vine-curtained veranda ['The first thing I'd do would be tear off that monstrosity said a visiting architect] which almost completely bounded the big square box of the house, circa 1880" (715; emphasis added; brackets in original). Here we have three metaphors in a couple of lines while the only real detail mentioned is the curtains, which, like a screen, conceal and reveal.17 Further down the "L-shaped space" (7 1 8) is another image stressing the link between the house and writing.18 Significantly, the only furniture mentioned on this occasion are the "bookshelves" and the "oil portraits" (718), which draw attention to two different modes of representation and thus confirm that the description cannot be taken at face value - what is at stake is definitely the question of representation. Furthermore, Bess's allusion to Perraulťs Cinderella confirms that the referent is not the real, or not just the real, but possibly another work of fiction as well. And when she mentions Cinderella, she also refers to the latter's "two wicked sisters" (718), thus suggesting the three Fates from Roman mythology, another type of fiction. On more than one occasion the Gunther house is associated with books: "The house itself, designed for reading long Victorian novels around an open fire of the evening" (720). There is also the suggestive location Fitzgerald has chosen, namely "Carroll County," with "Maryland" not far from "Wonderland" no doubt.</page><page sequence="9">80 Pascale Antolin Although "More Than Just a House" could be regarded, at first reading, as just another Post story, on close inspection it soon turns out to be neither casual nor simple. Fitzgerald constantly foregrounds the fictional, even metatextual, dimension of his tale, which indicates that in this short piece he is definitely pursuing the linguistic experiments that are the hallmark of his best novels. From this point of view, his choice of a house as a focal point is all the more meaningful since architecture is a traditional metaphor for language and literary construction. As Philippe Hamon observes, It is as if the artifice of literature (an articulated semiotic ensemble that produces meaning) possessed a structural complicity or deep preestablished homology with that very thing whose existence in reality is already artificial, namely the building (an articulated semiotic ensemble that produces space). (6; emphasis in original) Allusions to houses and architecture are to be found on nearly every page in the story, first to houses that Lew would like to get - "[H]e had his eye on a very modern bachelor apartment full of wrought-iron swinging gates - as if he were a baby inclined to topple downstairs" (715). Not only does the presence of a comparison (between dashes, as an afterthought) cast a doubt over the description, but this comparison with "a baby toppling downstairs" suggests no less than a double story, while the "wrought-iron" and "swinging gates" (both characterized by holes) indicate the possibility of a passage from one level to the next, or from the surface to what is concealed below. Then, on the occasion of his third visit, Lew mentions houses he lived in: "[H]e had occupied a twelve-room apartment in New York, rented a summer mansion on Long Island, but his spirit, warped by loneliness and grown gypsy with change, turned back persistently to this house" (723). 19 Here, the Gunther house appears to be an archetypal house rather than an actual dwelling. Other allusions to housing and architecture, however, are more unexpected. The story begins metaphorically with Lew stepping into a new house and meeting new people: "You came into an entrance hall, sometimes narrow New England Colonial, sometimes cautiously spa- cious" (7 1 4). Once again, the uncertainty emphasized by the repetition of "sometimes" shows that here too the house has no single, clearly identi-</page><page sequence="10">From Romance to Modernist Writing: "More Than Just a House" 81 fied referent. A parallel seems to be drawn between the reader entering the story and the character entering a new house; this is confirmed by the use of the second-person pronoun. "You" somehow forces the reader into the story, confirming that this opening is meant especially for him/her to understand what is going on and what is at stake. This strategy sheds light on the link between the house in the story and the story itself. Similarly, no sooner has the hero rescued Amanda from a train than the narrator unexpectedly says, "Lew's taste was changed in regard to architecture and interior decoration" (715). Or again, at the close of his very first visit, "Lew was never again quite so impressed by the suburban houses whose children lived upon rolling platforms in the street" (717). These hints seem to be dropped in order to give the reader clues to the mean- ing of the semantically volatile Gunther house. Indeed, all significantly evoke a change in Lew's approach - as if to suggest a necessary change in the readers approach as well. The Gunther house is not to be taken at face value, so to speak, hence the initial discrepancy between the dwelling as Lew perceives it and as it is perceived by its inhabitants. Then, as the story unfolds, another discrepancy appears between the house Lew has in mind and the "real" Gunther house. From beginning to end, therefore, the reader is confronted with the instability of the sign, the illusions of the hero, and with uncertainty as to the "real" meaning of the place. Hence Lew's last sentence: "Next week or so we'll decide what to do about that" (733). It is no casual detail that uncertainty should prevail at the close of the story or that Fitzgerald should have used a substitute for the signi- fier. At this stage even the signifier has disappeared. A similar device is used in describing the hero of The Great Gatsby. Not only are there hardly any details given of his physical appearance, but, with respect to his identity, the reader is provided with nothing but multiple, often unreliable, testimonies (even lies from Gatsby himself), vague rumors, and snatches of telephone conversations. It is only in chapter 7 that Daisy first and then Tom try and "define" Gatsby. But, significantly, Daisy cannot find the word she is looking for, and the reader is left with a mere dash - '"You resemble the advertisement of the man,' she went on innocently. 'You know the advertisement of the man - '" ( 1 14) - that is, a hole in the fabric of the text, a question mark on the white page. Tom in turn comes up with a signifier without any signified, "Mr. Nobody from</page><page sequence="11">82 Pascale Antolin Nowhere" - ironically emphasized by the capital letters, another blank therefore. Similarly, the Gunthers house turns out to be "more than just a house" indeed. It is a metaphor for both Fitzgerald's text and for the way this text must be interpreted - not only by referring to the real (as he shows, it tends to be out of reach), but also by relying on fiction as well,20 and on the text itself in particular. Thus, at the end of the story, the narrator says, "the purpose of the house was achieved," and he adds as an afterthought, between dashes, "finished and folded" (733). The verb "to fold" is usually used to refer to a page or a piece of fabric, both common metaphorical representations of a text. Fitzgerald appears to deny the possibility of a stable meaning and metaphorically makes a case for an open, flexible meaning instead. Or, as Virginia Woolf wrote in To the Lighthouse , "nothing [is] simply one thing" (172). Even in such an apparently minor story as "More Than Just a House," Fitzgerald proves that he did not consider story writing simply to be an easy means of making money. Not only does he pursue the lin- guistic experiments that characterize his major works, but he does so in a so-called "potboiler," a Post story, with all its constraints, including the need to please a readership eager for "romantic" stories. Once again, he appears not just as an heir to the romance tradition but as a modernist, and a far more innovative author than he has often been considered to be. By asserting the power of fiction over the real, he asserts his own power as a fiction writer21 - hence the adverb "more" in the title. From beginning to end, Fitzgerald overexposes his effects as if both to display and delight in his power as a manipulator of words and meanings. Notes 1 . In the preface to The Portrait of a Lady ; Henry James coined the famous phrase "the house of fiction" (45) and referred to his novel as "a square and spacious house" (47). 2. Fitzgerald made a few forays into the supernatural tradition, as in "The Cut-Glass Bowl" (1920) and the so-called Devil episode in This Side of Paradise. 3. See Chandler: Romance refuses, in a sense, what one critic has called "the social responsibilities" of the novel by shifting the ground of</page><page sequence="12">From Romance to Modernist Writing: "More Than Just a House" 83 language and undermining its referential function in favor of enhancing its symbolic possibilities. (65) 4. Interestingly, Tender Is the Night, which was published only a year after "More Than Just a House," is subtitled "A Romance." 5. See Melville: "It is with fiction as with religion: it should present another world, and yet one to which we feel the tie" (qtd. in Bell v). 6. See John Fletcher and Malcolm Bradbury's essay "The Introverted Novel": The process of making not only becomes part of the significant logic of the story: it can, indeed, become the story. As a result, novels come to seem more and more to approximate to their character as verbal constructs, form being not simply an en- abling means for handling the content, but in some essential sense heing the content. . . . One result is a progressive fading of that realism which has long been associated with the novel; language ceases to be what we see through, and becomes what we see. The novel hangs on the border between the mimetic and the autotelic species of literature, between an art made by imitating things outside itself, and an art that is an internally coherent making. (qtd. in Bradbury and McFarlane 401; emphasis in original) 7. Other houses in Fitzgerald's work are no less significant, though their anthropomorphic dimension may not be as explicit as it is in The Great Gatshy or in "More Than Just a House." In The Beautiful and Damned, the house at Marietta seems to become increasingly malevolent as An- thony and Gloria experience increasing moral and economic decay. The second time they sign the lease, "to their utter horror they signed it and sent it, and immediately it seemed as though they heard the gray house, drably malevolent at last, licking its white chops and waiting to devour them" (192). Here Fitzgerald relies on images to suggest personification and threat, a technique borrowed from the gothic tradition. In Tender Is the Night, the most unexpected house is no doubt to be found on "rue Monsieur" in Paris, where Dick and Rosemary attend a party given by female homosexuals, "cobra women" (82-85). The threat of castration is perceptible everywhere: [I] t was a house hewn from the frame of Cardinal de Retz's palace in the rue Monsieur. ... it was an electric-like shock, a</page><page sequence="13">84 Pascale Antolin definite nervous experience perverted as a breakfast of oatmeal and hashish, to cross that threshold, if it could be so called, into the long hall of blue steel, silver-gilt, and myriad facets of many oddly bevelled mirrors. (82) For a thorough analysis of the houses and their significance in the novel, see Dahl, Le Vot in Poli et al. 19-212, Chandler 216-43, and Antolin. Though houses and space are not the main concerns of the novel, both through the analysis of images and through a thorough study of the analogi- cal dimension of objects, there are numerous references to them. 8. "There was an inexplicable amount of dust everywhere, and the rooms were musty, as though they hadn't been aired for many days" ( Gatsby 140). This beginning of chapter 8 has often been quoted as evidence of the influence of Poe s "The Fall of the House of Usher" and as one of the few passages in his work in which the gothic tradition is clearly perceptible. 9. Bess is the only one of the three sisters who seems to be attached to the family house: "Its a nice place. ... Of course, we re miles from town, but there's always plenty of people" (716-17), she says when she leads Lew to his car after his first visit. This may be the reason why she is the only one he can actually marry. 10. See Bachelard: "And always, in our daydreams, the house is a large cradle. . . . Life begins well, it begins enclosed, protected, all warm in the bosom of the house" (7). 1 1. Other details in the story confirm this circular pattern: for instance, Bess's "I'm going to be the Cinderella, Mr. Lowrie" (718) in the opening section, which is taken up again at the end when she says, "I told you years ago that I had the makings of a Cinderella" (732). 1 2. Cf. the end of The House of the Seven Gables: "The growth of the garden seemed to have got quite out of bounds; the weeds had taken advantage of Phoebe's absence" (299). 13. This technique is reminiscent of the endless lists of things and words in Tender Is the Night and indicates Fitzgerald's intense enjoyment of his mastery of the language. It also expresses his desire, even his need maybe, in such a period of doubts and difficulty, to prove to himself - and to oth- ers - that he is still in control. 14. Wilbur adds: I have said that all journeys in Poe are allegories of the process</page><page sequence="14">From Romance to Modernist Writing: "More Than Just a House" 85 of dreaming, and we must understand [it] as a dream of the narrator's, in which he leaves behind him the waking physical world and journeys inward toward his moi intérieur ř, toward his inner and spiritual self. (qtd. in Regan 108) 15. Cf. Feidelson: "The Puritans saw the world as instinct with meaning by reason of God's concurrence and susceptible of interpretation by reason of God's salient acts" (82). 16. See Alan Bullock: [Modernism] is the art of a world from which many traditional certainties had departed, and a certain sort of Victorian con- fidence not only in the onward progress of mankind but in the very solidity and visibility of reality itself has evaporated. It contains within itself that tendency, so apparent at the end of the nineteenth century, for knowledge to become both pluralistic and ambiguous, for surface certainties no longer to be taken on trust, for experience to outrun, as it seemed to many to be outrunning, the orderly control of the mind, (qtd. in Bradbury and McFarlane 57) Bullock mentions, among the major factors that contributed to this new situation, Einstein's work on the theory of relativity, the development of psychoanalysis, and Marxism. One could add to these the growing influ- ence of the consumer society (with publicity one of its main features) that Fitzgerald both took advantage of and bitterly denounced in The Great Gatsby. 17. The syntactic structure of the passage is also worthy of attention. An outside testimony or comment is inserted and exposed, within brackets, in the description, without any specific justification except showing the reader that the description conceals something. Thus the description becomes a prescription telling the reader how to read the text. 18. On the other hand, Hamon remarks that literature depends on other arts to define itself. Comparison, metaphor, and analogy are therefore necessarily inscribed at the core of the very act of definition - not as mere decorative practices, but as indispensable tools. (17) 19. Cf. The Great Gatsby : My house was at the very tip of the egg, only fifty yards from</page><page sequence="15">86 Pascale Antolin the Sound, and squeezed between two huge places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on my right was a colossal affair by any standard. ... It was Gatsby's man- sion. (10-11) 20. Recurrent allusions to The Great Gatsby in the story suggest that Gats- by's mansion, too, can be regarded as a referent for the Gunther house. 21.
