<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philosophy and Phenomenological Research Vol. XLIII, No. 4, June I983 Merleau-Ponty and the Nature of Philosophy ADRIAN MICHAEL MIRVISH California State University, Chico In his work "Eye and Mind" Merleau-Ponty writes: [t]he entire modern history of painting, with its efforts to detach itself from illusionism and to acquire its own dimensions, has a metaphysical significance.' Although this may appear so strong as to be an overstatement on his part, Merleau-Ponty does indeed take this assertion quite seriously; to the extent in fact that he feels that certain modern painters have a cru- cial contribution to make to philosophy. The issue here becomes clear when we look at Merleau-Ponty's notions of being in the world, and those historical forces which influenced him in their development. For what we wish to show in what follows is how, given his background and his formulations of being in the world, Merleau-Ponty is led to the conclusion that philosophy as a discipline has arrived at an impasse. We will also show how Merleau-Ponty is at this juncture presented with two possible answers in his attempt to solve this problem, one of which would have involved his pursuing an experimental line of research, and the other of which did in fact involve him in turning to the painter's works in an attempt to deal with this impasse. In order to develop this theme, what follows will be divided into four sections. In Section One, two schools of thought that had a profound effect on Merleau-Ponty will be dealt with. We will see how he reacts against them, returning to their themes in a constant refrain as to what philosophy should not do. Section Two will deal with those aspects of Gestalt psychology which were important to Merleau-Ponty in his for- mulation of the notion of being in the world. A criticism which he makes of Gestalt practice will also be dealt with. In Section Three we will look at the notion of the lived body in Max Scheler's philosophy, and see how this profoundly influenced Merleau-Ponty's own work. Finally, in Section Four, we will use the preceding material to show how I Maurice Merleau-Ponty, "Eye and Mind," The Primacy of Perception, translated by James M.

MERLEAU-PONTY AND THE NATURE OF PHILOSOPHY 449</page><page sequence="2">Merleau-Ponty was led to the above-mentioned impasse, which he attempted to deal with by turning to the work of the painter. Here we shall refer to the work of Cezanne in particular.' Section One The French Intellectualists can be counted among those philosophers who played an important role in shaping Merleau-Ponty's own thought. For our purposes, what can be said to characterize them is that they postulate a form of dualism and claim that knowledge is obtained by the mind as objective imposing an order or "form" on the "content" given by the senses. We can elaborate briefly on these points by turning to the work of a well-known Intellectualist, Alain, which is entitled Quatre-vingt-un chapitres sur l'esprit et les passions.3 Given the influence of Kant on the Intellectualists, it would be wrong to suppose that they posit a Cartesian type of mind-body dualism. Thus it is that Alain tells us, ". . . I perceive things only after what I sense due to their physical action on my body; and this primary given without which I would not perceive anything is what is called sensation."4 It should be noted, however, that when we try to delineate what exactly this primary datum is, it turns out to be ineffable since it is only possible in theory to separate the ordering or judging component of the mind from the content of the bodily senses which it judges. That is, in Alain's terms, the form and matter of our consciousness cannot be separated.' The task of philosophy should nevertheless consist, among other things, in determining, as far as possible, the complex relation that obtains between the form of the understanding or judgment and the matter of the senses. Thus Alain writes that, "[a]ll of our effort will now be con- cerned with recognizing the understanding in sensation . . . always distinguishing matter and form, but refusing to separate them."6 In order to better grasp what role the understanding or judgment plays in sensation, let us look at an example from Alain when he writes: In what follows, we need to note two qualifications. First, we shall restrict ourselves to cases involving the perception of ordinary, inanimate, and solid objects only. Any fur- ther discussion of, for example, dreams, hallucinations, etc., would involve us in too extensive a task. Second, we shall not attempt to defend the soundness of any positions that follow. Our purpose will rather be solely expository and exegetical in nature. Alain, Quatre-vingt-un chapitres sur l'esprit et les passions (Paris: Bloch, I9I7), my translations following. Merleau-Ponty cites this work himself. Thus, see Maurice Mer- leau-Ponty, Phenomenology of Perception, translated by Colin Smith (New York: Humanities Press, i967). Note, for example, pp. 33-34.

Rather, I judge that it is far away accord- ing to its colour, the relative size of the things that I see there, according to the vagueness of the details and by virtue of the interposition of other objects which partially hide it from me.7 Thus, as is to be expected from what has been said above, judgment orders the material given in sensation to allow one to conclude that the horizon is far away. Now as it turns out, Alain not only uses the notion of judgment as above, i.e., as a faculty operating spontaneously and prereflectively, but also insofar as it operates at a more reflective level.8 What is important for us to note, however, is that judgment is in both cases distinctly a function of the mind as opposed to the matter of the senses which is associated with the body. We can then conclude this brief presentation of the Intellectualists by noting that they posit a form of dualism and take the notion of knowledge in a cognitivist sense. In what follows, we will have. occasion to see Merleau-Ponty reacting against both of these assertions. There is a second group of thinkers which we need to deal with in this section, viz., the Empiricist psychologists. As with the Intellectualists, Merleau-Ponty spends quite some time in an attempt to refute certain of their claims. Given that I have dealt fully with such Empiricist claims elsewhere, however, it would be more convenient now to simply state those pertinent to the enquiry at hand.9 What characterizes the Empiricists is that they believe there is exper- imental evidence for the existence of what they term "pure sensations." These, philosophically speaking, are private and atomic experiences which correspond to discrete stimulants in the organism's environment. It is these pure sensations, moreover, which form the basis for our per- ception of ordinary, everyday objects. That is, it is not the case that there really exist such ordinary objects, but rather that they are consti- tuted by the mind, i.e., the brain, from the primary data of our experi- ence, viz., sensations. In this regard, the Empiricists postulate a theory of learning, according to which the organism learns to combine sensa- tions into particular patterns which then appear in the form of what we normally take to be independently existing objects. ft follows from this that not only are objects constituted by the mind, but that in general, for the Empiricist, our entire external world is similarly built up due to the mind's ability to learn to constitute it as such. That is, the external 7 Ibid., p. 14. 8 Ibid. See, for example, p. 24. 9 Thus see Adrian Mirvish, "Sartre and the Gestaltists: Demystifying (Part of) Being and Nothingness," The Journal of the British Society for Phenomenology, Volume ii, Number 3 (October i980). Strictly speaking one should be concerned with two groups here, viz., the Introspectionist and Empiricist psychologists. For our purposes, how- ever, when Merleau-Ponty talks of "Empiricist psychologists" he is referring to people such as Helmholz and Hering. MERLEAU-PONTY AND THE NATURE OF PHILOSOPHY 45I</page><page sequence="4">world is to be understood as a product of learning and is, in this sense, a derived or secondary notion. It is clear that, given his philosophical and psychological back- ground, Merleau-Ponty was very much influenced by both of the above sets of thinkers, if only to the extent that he devoted so much time in an attempt to refute their positions.'0 In particular, he is confronted with two main sets of problems. For, on the one hand, he has to overcome the dualism of the Intellectualists along with their concomitant asser- tion that knowledge, given by the form of understanding and judgment, is purely cognitive, i.e., a function of the mind. On the other hand, he also has to overcome the conclusion of the Empiricists that the sup- posedly independent existence of what we experience as our external reality or world, is in fact due to learning, via which we use the mind to combine private and atomic sensations. How exactly Merleau-Ponty sets about dealing with these problems will become clear as we proceed through the following sections. Section Two Merleau-Ponty is quite explicit about the debt which he owes to the Gestaltists. Thus, for example, towards the end of The Primacy of Per- ception, he summarizes his position and notes that there are psychologists who have described the perceived world as I did above, the Gestalt psychologists . . ."" Let us then start our treat- ment of this section with a quotation from Phenomenologie de la per- ception in which Merleau-Ponty notes that: . . .as Gestalt theory has shown, there are privileged forms for me which are the same for all others, and which are able to give rise to a science of psychology and rigorous laws. The collection of points: is always perceived as 'six pairs of points spaced at two millimeters from each other . . What exactly is meant by "privileged forms" above? The issue at stake here is important, so let us turn to a work of the well-known Gestaltist Wolfgang K6hler for reference and start by briefly describing three experiments mentioned by him. In the first of these, a tame bird, perched on a tree, was allowed to see how food was placed under a small pot. After a time, the bird would alight on the ground, lift up the pot and take the food. When, however, ? Thus see, for example, Merleau-Ponty, PP, "Introduction," especially sections z and 3. I Maurice Merleau-Ponty, The Primacy of Perception, translated by James M. Edie (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, i964), p. 23.

On the other hand, in the following three cases, the bird immediately picked the pot [x] - the only one containing the food: I) 0000000000 3) O 0R) VoIo cm 2)0 00D 6 cm z cm Note that in the following case, the bird picked the pot [x] at random: 0 00 3 cm z cm What Kdhler concludes from the above is that as soon "as in human vision the . . . pot [x] became something strikingly segregated from the rest, the bird selected the right object at once."'3 The next experiment concerns congenitally blind subjects who gain the use of their sight after an operation. It is usually the case in the first postoperative tests that they cannot recognize an object by sight alone, one which they knew previously by touch. Nevertheless, notes Kdhler, when such a subject is: ... asked about "that thing" which he has before him, he understands the question. Obviously, he has before him a specific entity to which he refers the question, and which he tries to name.... Elementary visual organization seems to be given to him at once.'4 Given the above, we should ask what the Gestalt example used by Mer- leau-Ponty and those mentioned by Kohler have in common. The answer is that humans, and it appears birds too for the matter, tend to organize sensory experience by grouping together as a "figure" or "form" a set of particular entities in the perceptual field over against the rest of the field as a "background" to this "figure." Moreover, these groupings are spontaneous and not at all learned, which is why we gave the examples of the previously blind patient and of the bird above. In addition to relying on this sort of evidence, K6hler, in fact, adduces a number of arguments to substantiate that these groupings are sponta- neous as opposed to being learned.'5 We cannot afford to elaborate on 3 Wolfgang Kdhler, Gestalt Psychology (New York: Liveright, I947), pp. I46-48. 14 Ibid., p. I 50. '5 Ibid., especially pp. I4I-44. MERLEAU-PONTY AND THE NATURE OF PHILOSOPHY 453</page><page sequence="6">these here, but it should be stressed that the type of experiments men- tioned plus concomitant arguments for natural grouping were among the factors which helped to sound the death knell for Empiricism. For whereas this latter theory posited discrete or atomic sensations as the basis for perception, and consequent constitution, via learning, of the world, Gestalt psychology gave empirical, or what Merleau-Ponty would call phenomenological, evidence that the basis for our perception of the world was the Gestalt. In contrast to atomic sensations, gestalten were said to be synthetic units or forms in which the grouping as a whole was greater than the sum of its parts. Moreover, to iterate, these sensory units were said to not be learned. Rather, they were the result of a natural or spontaneous organization on the part of the organism. Thus Gestalt psychology aided Merleau-Ponty in particular in his fight against the Empiricists. Indeed, we can see an instance in which Mer- leau-Ponty uses Gestalt against them when in PP he states that: If we return to the truly objective investigations themselves, we first of all discover that the conditions external to the sensory field do not govern it part for part, and that they exert an effect only to the extent of making possible a basic pattern - which is what Gestalt theory makes clear.'6 In addition to aiding him in his fight against the Empiricists, Gestalt psychology also provided Merleau-Ponty with evidence to counter Intellectualism. For it will be recalled that this latter theory postulated a clear-cut separation between "matter" and "form." This, however, is clearly going to be at odds with a Gestalt type theory, according to which the basic and synthetic units of perception automatically involve organization at a sensory level. Hence, knowledge, construed in the broad sense of the term, does not at all have the distinctively cognitive sense for the Gestaltist which it does for the Intellectualist, and so the findings of Gestalt theory help Merleau-Ponty in undermining the "matter-form" distinction which the Intellectualists wished to uphold. If Gestalt theory was thus instrumental in helping to undermine Empiricism and Intellectualism for Merleau-Ponty, we should now ask what it provided him in their place. There are two answers germane for our purposes. The first, to use Merleau-Ponty's own terms, is that it can provide us with the means by which we can "describe the privileged forms of human conduct...." '7 In order to elaborate on this point, we first recall Merleau-Ponty's point given at the beginning of this section which shows how all humans group the collection of twelve dots into six pairs. There are also, according to Gestalt theory, other types of universal groupings or i6 Maurice Merleau-Ponty, PP, p. i i. '7 Maurice Merleau-Ponty, "The Metaphysical in Man," Sense and Non-Sense, trans- lated by Hubert L. Dreyfus and Patricia Allen Dreyfus (Evanston: Northwestern Uni- versity Press, i964), p. 85. 454 ADRIAN MICHAEL MIRVISH</page><page sequence="7">forms. Thus, for example: . ... when in a dark room a bright spot in motion describes the pattern [below], we see certain forms of movement such as I, II, III. But we do not see other forms, not for exam- ple, a form which corresponds to a fraction of I, the next horizontal stretch, and a fraction of II, taken together.'8 I II III There are, however, other Gestalt forms which seem to be culturally relative. Thus, for example, whereas we are taken in by the Muller-Lyer illusion, members of the Zulu culture are not. It is also known that peo- ple such as Pygmies growing up in an environment with very close vistas, when exposed to open vistas with wide horizons, see them in what can best be described as a fish-eye lens manner.'9 The point of all this is to show that humans organize their experi- ences according to Gestalt forms. But these forms, once known, can then provide us with an extremely valuable set of at least relatively objective, and sometimes even universal, criteria out of which we will be able to partially determine how a person's overall world of experi- ence is structured. We use the term "partially" here since the structuring of many experiences is obviously enormously complicated. In fact, Mer- leau-Ponty, as we shall see later, does not suppose that it will ever be possible to totally delineate the structure of the world of experience on the basis of Gestalt forms. Rather, he is saying that they simply offer us an extremely valuable tool in terms of which we can, at least partially and methodically, map out the structure of a person's world. Moreover, and in the same vein as above, it is not only the human world whose structure can be partially explicated via the help of Gestalt forms. For, possible problems of anthropomorphism notwithstanding, Merleau-Ponty notes that on the basis of being able to infer that K6hler's apes, for example, have particular gestalten, it is possible to start to reconstruct ". . . the chimpanzee's behavioral universe as revealed by methodical interpretation of his conduct."20 It is then cer- tainly the case that if Gestalt data can help us reconstruct "the chim- panzee's behavioral universe," it is a fortiori so regarding the human i8 Kohler, pp. 15z and i89.

MERLEAU-PONTY AND THE NATURE OF PHILOSOPHY 455</page><page sequence="8">behavioral universe. In addition to the above, Gestalt psychology can tell us something new about the relation between person and world, according to Mer- leau-Ponty. In order to show how this is so, he compares it to the tran- scendental philosophies of Kant and Husserl in PP. As regards the world of our experience, we know that the Kantian categories serve as ". . . the condition of its possibility."' That is, there is a formal or empty set of conditions existing a priori, which determines the phenom- enal realm. In the case of Husserl, we can, in a sense, go even further than Kant. For via the phenomenological reduction, we can analyze and com- pletely explicate the actual structures of a given experience. Concomi- tant with such a reduction, however, and in Husserl's own terms: ... we . . . have an attitude above the universal conscious life (both individual-sub- jective and intersubjective) through which the world is "there" for those naively absorbed in ongoing life, as unquestionably present. In opposition to both of the above - the latter allowing us to go beyond or above our everyday experience, and the former postulating an a priori realm of categories - a Gestalt form cannot, in any sense, go beyond or be the condition for our experience. Rather, Gestalt forms are the very structure of our experience itself. Gestalt form, says Mer- leau-Ponty, ". . . is the very appearance of the world. ..."3 In this way it would, strictly speaking, be wrong to think of forms as determin- ing our experience, since this locution could imply that they somehow exist apart from such experience. What the above implies for Merleau-Ponty is that any philosophizing which we happen to do, will only be done on the basis of our already having structured our experience in prepredicative ways. That is, phi- losophy should recognize from the start that, insofar as it is a reflective discipline, it is presented with a subject already busy with and immersed in structuring a world of experience in terms of Gestalt forms. Hence, according to Merleau-Ponty, transcendental philosophy is wrong in supposing that it can step outside the human (structuring) condition to provide us with absolute criteria or conditions which our experience must conform to. Rather, ". . . philosophy is merely an elucidated experience."24 It is in this sense that Merleau-Ponty wishes to say that Gestalt psychology allows us to see that we are beings in the world, i.e., beings involved in structuring the world at a prepredicative and prereflective level. This, as we shall see, is the first of a series of argu- " Merleau-Ponty, PP, p. 6i. " Edmund Husserl, The Crisis of European Sciences, translated by David Carr (Evans- ton: Northwestern University Press, 1970), p. 150. 23 Merleau-Ponty, PP, p. 6i. 24 Ibid., p. 63. 456 ADRIAN MICHAEL MIRVISH</page><page sequence="9">ments showing that the activity of philosophizing is derivative or dependent on our already being in the world. Given the above, we can now turn to a criticism which Merleau- Ponty makes of the Gestaltists, and then describe what, in effect, could be taken as the response of the latter to his charge. This, in turn, will lead us to a discussion of aspects of Max Scheler's philosophy in Section Three. The criticism which Merleau-Ponty makes of the Gestaltists is that they were misled in their attempt to be strictly "scientific" and produce quantified results. The problem here stems from the fact that many of our experiences are so complicated that the Gestaltists were deterred from even trying to analyze them in terms of their constituent forms. In fact, says Merleau-Ponty, they tried to skirt the entire issue of such complex experiences by simply restricting their research to considering more particularized cases: [t]heir favorite subject of study was those forms whose appearances, especially in the lab- oratory, are more or less regular, given a certain number of external conditions: the anon- ymous sensory functions. They were willing to pay any price for precision in their formu- las, even if this meant abandoning to some extent the more complex forms which affect the entire personality, [and] are less simply dependent upon given external condi- tions. . . ... The problem with the above is that not only does it involve the Ges- taltists shying away from studying the human being as such, i.e., as a totality, but in addition, it undermines one of their fundamental tenets, viz., that it is really artificial to isolate particular sensory modalities.26 Thus, the Gestaltists were undermining their own principles in reverting to experiments which were "scientifically" viable to conduct. Now whereas we feel that the above criticism is well taken overall, it is simply not quite fair to all of the Gestaltists' work. For there were, in fact, experiments conducted whose subject matter was far more com- plicated than simply dealing with a particular sensory modality. Let us, therefore, turn to those experiments discussed by Gestaltist David Katz concerning what is called "Perception of the Bodily Self." Katz starts by noting that: Sensations from the muscles, tendons, joints, semicircular canals, and the eyes all play a part in structuring our subjective bodily impressions. If these sensations are not referred to the bodily self, but are objectified instead, they produce information about the envi- ronment . . . it should be noted that subjective referral of sensations involves Gestalt laws which are entirely different from those which operate when the same sensations are projected outward."7 25 Merleau-Ponty, "Metaphysical," p. 85. 26 Thus see, for example, Merleau-Ponty, PP, pp. 207-42. 27 David Katz, Gestalt Psychology, translated by Robert Tyson (New York: The Ronald Press Company, I950), p. 7I. MERLEAU-PONTY AND THE NATURE OF PHILOSOPHY 457</page><page sequence="10">Thus, Gestalt laws describing full, bodily experience, somehow involve a large number of sensory modalities. Moreover, these laws are very different according to whether the subject has the outside world or his own bodily sensations as objects of attention. Katz describes an experiment in order to illustrate this latter point of which we need only mention part. When a barefoot subject, x, stands on a scale and pulls or pushes on a horizontal bar, the change in weight registered on the scale varies con- siderably, whereas x perceives very little change in pressure on the soles of his feet. Thus, [i]f the subject bends his knees very suddenly pressure on his soles may decline to zero. On the other hand if an individual who weighs i 65 pounds rises quickly, the pressure may be as much as 330 pounds. It is surprising to discover that even with such extreme varia- tion . . . the subject perceives almost no change whatsoever.18 These results are to be contrasted to what occurs when x reclines and has pressure applied to the sole of the foot. In this case, x is acutely aware that pressure is being applied. In fact, [flor a reclining subject the pressure threshold is approximately 25 percent. However, according to [the above experiment], in which the circumstances are different, the thresh- old is seen to be 500 percent or even more.'9 One of the conclusions which Katz reaches from the above is that: There never are isolated stimuli. There are only those stimuli which, together with more stimuli of the same - or other - sense modalities, form organized total patterns. Hence there are no pressure stimuli on the soles, as such . . . total bodily experience is obvi- ously the most inclusive form connected with the bodily self. It is only with reference to that all-embracing form that its constituent, segmental forms receive their value.3" On his own principles Merleau-Ponty would undoubtedly have to applaud the above experiment. For it illustrates the Gestaltist principle, which he himself evoked earlier, that it is misleading when dealing with a human subject to try to isolate sensory modalities. Moreover, this experiment tells us something fascinating about the way in which the form of what we might term our "bodily being in the world" varies with variations in background. Note, however, that Katz never actually describes what exactly the various gestalten are in a way analogous to the visual examples we discussed above, in which a definite Gestalt pat- tern could be described. Rather, all he tells us is that there are stimuli which "form organized total patterns." Now even this failure on Katz's part should not cause the Gestaltist to despair. For after all, the case under consideration here is far more complex than those we initially discussed above. Thus, it should be expected that far more work would 28 Ibid., p. 73. 29 Ibid. 30 Ibid., pp. 73-74. 458 ADRIAN MICHAEL MIRVISH</page><page sequence="11">be necessary in order to delineate clear Gestalt patterns here. To use Merleau-Ponty's terms, the greater difficulty of the case under consider- ations should not mean that we have to abandon those forms ". . . more difficult to discover but also more valuable for the knowl- edge of human behavior."3' Meritorious as the above experiment may be, it still suffers from a certain error of description on Katz's part. Since, however, this has to do with what might be called our "bodily being in the world," a discus- sion of it will best be postponed until the following section. Thus, summarizing this section, Gestalt psychology is enormously important to Merleau-Ponty, for it helps him in overcoming certain problems raised by the Empiricists and Intellectualists, viz., those of atomism, the nature of the external world as being merely constituted, and the "matter-form" distinction. In addition, it provides what he feels is the phenomenological basis for a concrete and fruitful study of our "behavioral universe as revealed by methodical interpretation of [our] conduct." It is this latter point which helps to provide Merleau-Ponty with the basis on which to construct the argument examined above for our "being in the world." Section Three Although the Gestaltists did conduct Katz-type experiments, it is still the case for Merleau-Ponty that they do not have any fully fledged theory to offer regarding the nature of the body in its relation to the world. What we therefore wish to do in what follows is to examine an aspect of the work of Max Scheler and show how he provides an answer for this deficiency, one which is subsequently taken up by Mer- leau-Ponty. We might start by pointing out an immediately accessible common ground for both philosophers, viz., their concern to fight the Empiricist position. Thus Scheler, like Merleau-Ponty, is opposed to the idea of objects being constituted from private and atomic sensations." Rather, a theory is advocated according to which an independently existing reality is given to the subject via the resistance which it offers to his/her body considered as a living and holistic organism. We can elaborate on this theory by first noting Scheler writing: The actual experiences of heaviness do not change in simple proportion to the stimuli and our sensations of them. But, as Julius Pikler has shown, the experiences are dependent not only on the stimuli but also on the exertion and deployment of force by the person having the sensations. "Exertion," or the experience of exertion, is something completely differ- ent from the sensations of tension in the muscles and sinews. Exertion is the centrally 3I Merleau-Ponty, "Metaphysical," p. 85. 32 Thus see, for example, Scheler's criticism of Dilthey for accepting a thesis of Helmholz in Max Scheler, "Idealism and Realism," Selected Philosophical Essays, translated by David R. Lachterman (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1973), p. 322. MERLEAU-PONTY AND THE NATURE OF PHILOSOPHY 459</page><page sequence="12">experienced resistance offered by the heavy object. . .33 This quotation can be examined from two points of view, viz., that of the body and that of the object which it confronts. As regards the for- mer, what is crucial here is to note the result obtained by Pikler, accord- ing to which, not only stimuli and sensations but also the overall exer- tion of the subject, qua subject, has to be taken into account. What Scheler is thus saying is that merely to concentrate on stimuli and sensa- tions in the above case is to overlook experimental evidence, and what he would term a phenomenological given, viz., that it is the whole, liv- ing body which is experiencing a pressure, or resistance; where the resistance experienced will vary accordingly as the body - again taken as a whole - changes in the amount of force which it applies to what is resisting it. Empiricism, Scheler would thus presumably state, would have a hard time trying to account for the fact that experience of resis- tance changes as overall bodily exertion and bodily attention changes. As the reader may have already noted, this accords with the Katz exper- iment discussed above. For we saw that what could be concluded from Katz's findings was that pressure on the soles of the feet varied quite remarkably depending on overall bodily attention and concomitant change in position. Thus, both Katz's experiment and the conclusions of Pikler as used by Scheler can be seen as anti-Empiricist moves in which the body is taken as holistic and basic in explaining the relation which obtains between it and its environment. Scheler elaborates on this point when he notes that: A spatially ordered scheme of our whole "body" precedes the kinesthetic as well as the remaining organic sensations, and the latter change with changes in the whole of this schema. (In no way does this schema represent a simple addition of these sensations.)34 Thus, for Scheler there is the notion of what he calls a "lived body," which is conceived of as an integrated "scheme" or sensory field, in which any individual sensation is only to be understood in terms of the functioning of the entire organism. It is this notion which must be used as the basis in any philosophical endeavor which attempts to accurately describe the human world.35 3 Ibid., p. 32 2 (my italics). 34 Ibid., p. 330. For Scheler, the experiment of Pikler provides phenomenological evi- dence for the lived body. Thus, the relation between science and phenomenology for Scheler is very different when compared to that of Husserl, for the former is quite pre- pared to directly use scientific data as the basis for phenomenological studies. We can- not, however, afford to go into this issue now. " The above explanation of lived body (Leib) suffices for our purposes. Were it to be fully explained, however, we would have to elaborate on Scheler's notion of space in his later work, and "form" in his earlier work. Thus see, for example, "Idealism and Realism," pp. 327-50, and Formalism in Ethics and Non-Formal Ethics of Values, translated by Manfred Frings and Roger Funk (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1973), pp. 398-424. Scheler's vitalism would also have to be explained in some 460 ADRIAN MICHAEL MIRVISH</page><page sequence="13">Having dealt with the notion of the lived body and recalling what Scheler had to say about resistance at the beginning of this section, we should now briefly turn our attention to what it is that the body is said to encounter via resistance. Above, Scheler had noted that " exertionn is the centrally experienced resistance offered by the heavy object. . . ." Thus, Scheler is advocat- ing a theory that what is experienced by the lived body is not merely a set of sensations which is then constituted as an object. Rather, the object itself is that which is experienced in offering resistance to the body. This obviously goes completely contrary to the view of the Empir- icists who could, of course, criticize the above by saying that it only seems as though there is something beyond our sensations due to learn- ing, and that nothing said by Scheler above does actually militate against this objection. Scheler, however, does have an answer to such a charge as can be seen in terms of an example which he semiapprovingly talks about as being used by Dilthey. When a stick is picked up and placed against a wall, we should be careful not to confuse the sensations which we have in our hands and muscles, etc., with the actual experi- ence of what it is that offers resistance to being picked up. Thus, Scheler quotes Dilthey as saying that: It is unsatisfactory to assume that this objectification is brought about through the sensa- tions of touch and muscle tension, and in particular through the sensation of pres- sure . . . all of which are localized in the finger tips. The result of this would be only a lifeless, local sensation, having nothing to do with the experience of living force in resis- tance.36 Scheler criticizes Dilthey here for still talking about "sensation" since this is ultimately to fall back into the Empiricist trap of thinking that objects are nothing more than constructs from our sensations. To the extent that he does approve of the above example, however, Scheler in effect gives us a putative argument for our experiencing objects per se, as opposed to mere sensations. That is, in touching and seeing the stick, what we experience is an actual something other than, or over against the body. There is a thing of sorts which is there, whereas if we intro- spect, we simply will not find a set or collection of private and atomic sensations out of which the stick is constituted, as the Empiricists would have it.37 detail. It might also be noted here that Scheler associates lived body with environment and spirit or person with world. 36 Scheler, "Idealism and Realism," p. 3 20. 37 Scheler would not deny that sensations exist. It is rather that they have to be under- stood in terms of what he has called the overall "schema" of the lived body, and that they lack the state of ontological primacy granted them by the Empiricists. In this regard, it is interesting to note Scheler's criticism of Gestaltist David Katz in "Idealism and Realism," p. 3 20. MERLEAU-PONTY AND THE NATURE OF PHILOSOPHY 46i</page><page sequence="14">Thus, Scheler has given evidence for the existence of a lived body, and a putative argument that what this body experiences are actually objects themselves as opposed to mere sensations. From this a conclu- sion follows which is opposed to the tradition of German Idealism, which was part of Scheler's background. For given the nature of the lived body, the most basic experience which we have of our environ- ment is not cognitive but rather is given to us via the relation of resis- tance between lived body and environment. Thus, Scheler writes that, becomingig a matter of consciousness . . . is, in all the manifold lev- els and grades in which it occurs, always the result of our suffering the resistance of the world." And that " . . . the experience of reality is above all an ecstatic one, and not an ecstatic 'knowledge of' but an ecstatic 'having of' reality.""8 By "ecstatic" here Scheler is referring to the fact that it is the body as a holistic entity encountering resistance which gives us our primary experience of reality. Conscious knowledge of reality is thus derivative, in the sense that it depends on this more fundamental, bodily experience. The above suffices for our purposes and we can thus summarize Scheler's position by noting that reality - in the form of objects and not mere sensations - is given via resistance which is offered to the body as a dynamic and holistic organism. This, in turn, means that any knowledge, in the cognitive sense of the term, which we have of the world, is dependent on our more fundamental, lived bodily experiences. Although Merleau-Ponty differed from Scheler on certain fundamen- tal issues, we will show in what immediately follows that he accepted the above stated aspect of Scheler's philosophy wholeheartedly. A cer- tain conclusion can be drawn from this which will then put us in a posi- tion to tackle Section Four. Merleau-Ponty would, on reflection, surely agree with Scheler that the experiments of Katz and Pikler represent a major step forward in being able to refute Empiricism, insofar as they provide us with data for describing a lived body which experiences reality through resistance. That this is so can be seen when in PP he states that: [t]he pure quale would be given to us only if the world were a spectacle and one's own body a mechanism with which some impartial mind made itself acquainted. Sense experi- ence, on the other hand, invests the quality with vital value, grasping it . . . for that heavy mass which is our body, whence it comes about that it always involves a reference to the body. The problem is to understand these strange relationships which are woven between the parts of the landscape, or between it and me as incarnate subject. ...39 What Merleau-Ponty is doing at the beginning of the quotation is to state a criticism of none other than the Empiricists, for he is saying that their notion of what we earlier called a "pure sensation" could only be 38 Scheler,"Idealism and Realism," pp. 325 and 3 24. 39 Merleau-Ponty, PP, p. 52. 462 ADRIAN MICHAEL MIRVISH</page><page sequence="15">made sense of were there a spectator mind distanced from the effects of the world on its mechanical body. As opposed to this view, Merleau- Ponty advocates one according to which that which is sensed is done so via an "incarnate subject." Here we can then immediately notice a close similarity between this notion and that of Scheler's lived body. What is more, Merleau-Ponty has a footnote in the above quotation which states that his criticism of the Empiricists comes from none other than Scheler himself! In order to further substantiate Merleau-Ponty's dependence on Scheler for the notion of the lived body, let us also recall the latter's claim that: A spatially ordered scheme of our whole body precedes the kinesthetic as well as the remaining organic sensations, and the latter change with changes in this schema. (In no way does this schema represent a simple addition of these sensations.) This should be compared to a similar statement in PP where Merleau- Ponty writes: . . . my hand is not a collection of points . . . and the space of my hand is not a mosaic of spatial values. Similarly my whole body for me is not an assemblage of organs interposed in space. I am in individual possession of it and I know where each of my limbs is through a body image in which all are included.40 It should now be amply clear that Merleau-Ponty's "body image" and Scheler's "scheme of our whole body" are referring to the same notion, viz., that of the lived body. The next point of similarity which must be noted is that of the way in which reality is experienced by the body. We recall that, for Scheler, the emphasis here was on resistance to an object encountered by the lived body. Let us compare this with Merleau-Ponty's claiming that: The positing of the object . . . makes us go beyond the limits of our actual experience which is brought up against and halted by an alien being. . . . It is this ek-stase of expe- rience which causes all perception to be perception of something.4' Thus, although the higher level of intellectual positing of an object may require more than our immediate experience, what we initially encounter is "halted by an alien being" and given as an "ek-stase," i.e., it is given to the lived body via resistance. Finally, let us recall that, for Scheler, any cognitive knowledge which we have of the world is dependent on our lived-bodily experience of the world. Here, too, Merleau-Ponty agrees with Scheler as can be seen when he notes: 40 Ibid., p. 98. 41 Ibid., p. 7o. Recall, also, footnote i6 for Merleau-Ponty's rejection of the ontological primacy of sensations as postulated by the Empiricists. MERLEAU-PONTY AND THE NATURE OF PHILOSOPHY 463</page><page sequence="16">[Il]ike the body image, the fireplace is a system of equivalents not founded on the recogni- tion of some law, but on the experience of a bodily presence. . . . I join it in a kind of blind recognition which precedes the intellectual working out and clarification of the meaning.42 Hence summarizing, both Scheler and Merleau-Ponty adopt a view of the lived body as a dynamic and holistic entity which experiences the world via resistance in a bodily way, for which it follows that any cog- nitive knowledge which we may have of the world is dependent on such lived bodily experiences. The above allows us to arrive at a second formulation of the notion of being in the world. For, given his work with Gestalt psychology, it will be recalled that Merleau-Ponty came to the conclusion that our cognitive activity of philosophizing was dependent on a more funda- mental phenomenon, viz., that we are always immersed in structuring our world according to Gestalt forms. This phenomenon was termed "being in the world." What Scheler has now provided Merleau-Ponty with is material for a second formulation of this notion. For when the latter talks in the above quotations about "ek-stase," "bodily pres- ence," and about "a kind of blind recognition which precedes the intel- lectual working out . . .," he is stating that the human condition is such that our primary experience of reality does not occur at an intellec- tual level but rather, occurs via the resistance which objects in the envi- ronment offer the lived body. This implies, once again, that the activity of (traditional) philosophizing by which we cognitively or intellectually know or learn about reality depends on what has already been given to us at a lived-bodily level. It would be valuable, in concluding this section, to expand on the fol- lowing statement of Merleau-Ponty: The phenomenologists (Scheler and Heidegger) are right in pointing out this precompre- hension which precedes inductivity, for it is this which calls in question the ontological values of the Gegen-stand . . .43 The point which Merleau-Ponty is making, as applied to Scheler, should be clear from what has been said above. For we saw that accord- ing to Scheler our primary understanding of the world is a prepredica- tive one, and that moreover, at this level the object does indeed "stand out" insofar as it is apprehended via the resistance which it offers to the lived body. As regards Heidegger and the notion of "precomprehension" this point can be expanded on by showing how Merleau-Ponty has been influenced by him regarding the notion of being in the world. This topic, however, is an extremely complex one, and given that we are 42 Ibid., p. i85. 43 Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Working Notes, The Visible and the Invisible, translated by Alphonso Lingis (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, i968), p. I8z. 464 ADRIAN MICHAEL MIRVISH</page><page sequence="17">concerned with perception - an issue that is not a concern of Heideg- ger as such - the following brief discussion of the phenomena of object and world as they appear in Being and Time will suffice for our pur- poses. We can start by noting that for Heidegger: Being-in-the-world . . . amounts to a non-thematic circumspective absorption in refer- ences or assignments constitutive for the readiness-to-hand of a totality of equipment.44 It is easiest to understand the above if we note that for Heidegger tra- ditional ontology is wrong to the extent that it claims that there first exist entities individuated independently from human activity, which are subsequently categorized or classified according to a particular schema. Rather it is the case that humans are first involved in delineat- ing a world at a non-thematic, or prepredicative, level in terms of the objects that they are involved with in their day by day activity. Thus, for example, it is not that a hammer in the form of an extended piece of matter exists as more ontologically basic than the hammer as it is actu- ally used for knocking in nails. In fact for Heidegger the contrary is the case. We are most fundamentally involved with the hammer as an actual tool; as an instrument which we non-reflectively use in order to drive nails, for example, into a piece of wood. In this context the ham- mer is an integral part and center of a "referential totality" of equip- ment and is said to be revealed to us as "ready-to-hand."45 As opposed to this, the hammer as an extended piece of matter exist- ing apart from human activity, is merely an adumbrated entity obtained from the piece of equipment by a process of abstraction. The view of the non-thematic, or prepredicative, practical activity involving the use of entities as ready-to-hand is described by Heidegger when he notes: Equipment can genuinely show itself only in dealings cut to its own meas- ure(hammering with a hammer, for example); but in such dealings an entity of this kind is not grasped thematically as an occurring Thing, nor is the equipment-structure known as such even in the using. The hammering does not simply have knowledge about [um] the hammer's character as equipment, but it has appropriated this equipment in a way which could not possibly be more suitable. In dealings such as this, where something is put to use, our concern subordinates itself to the "in-order-to" which is constitutive for the equipment we are employing at the time; the less we just stare at the hammer-Thing, and the more we seize hold of it and use it, the more primordial does our relationship to it become, and the more unveiledly is it encountered as that which it is - as equipment. The hammering itself uncovers the specific 'manipulability' ["Handlichkeit"] of the hammer. The kind of Being which equipment possesses - in which it manifests itself in its own right - we call "readiness-to-hand" [Zuhandenheit].46 4 Martin Heidegger, Being and Time, translated by John Macquarrie and Edwin Robin- son (New York: Harper and Row, i962), p. 107. 41 Ibid., p. 98. 46 Ibid. MERLEAU-PONTY AND THE NATURE OF PHILOSOPHY 465</page><page sequence="18">Thus Heidegger has a view of objects being most truly revealed to us insofar as we are involved in practical activity. Given the notion of ready-to-hand, it would however be wrong to suppose that we now had the means by which objects - and the world insofar as objects refer to it as a ground - could be revealed to us in their true and ultimate nature. Heidegger emphasizes this point when he notes: That wherein [Worin] Dasein understands itself beforehand in the mode of assigning itself is that for which [das Woraufhin] it has let entities be encountered beforehand. The 'wherein' of an act of understanding which assigns or refers itself, is that for which one lets entities be encountered in the kind of Being that belongs to involvements; and this 'wherein' is the phenomenon of the world.47 For our purposes it is sufficient to note that when Heidegger talks of Dasein understanding itself "beforehand" he is talking about the fact that our primary involvement with objects in the world occurs at a non-thematic or prepredicative level. But there is not only one way in terms of which we can delineate our world with respect to any tool as the center of a referential totality of equipment. Thus, for example, a hammer may be used on, or refer to, nails and boards, which in turn refer to a house, so that the world ultimately referred to is that of a builder. But it could also be the case that a hammer refers to a head, which refers to an enemy, which refers to police, etc., in the case of a murderer. Indeed were we to suppose that there exists as fundamental a hammer independent of any world of practical activity, this would be to fall back into the trap of traditional ontology. Thus fundamentally the world is one of practical, non-thematic activity. A world in which objects are revealed to us, or "stand out" for us, as tools within a refer- ential totality of other instruments altogether making up a world. But the world can hence be delineated in an arbitrarily large number of ways depending on the type of activity in which Dasein is involved. It follows from this that not only would it be futile for Heidegger - who is concerned with the notion of Being in general - to stop with an anal- ysis of readiness-to-hand, but it is necessary to even go beyond the above analysis of the notion of world insofar as this is specifically task oriented. Thus Heidegger tells us: If we enquire ontologically about the 'world', we by no means abandon the analytic of Dasein as a field for thematic study. Ontologically, 'world' is not a way of characterizing those entities which Dasein essentially is not; it is rather a characteristic of Dasein itself.48 Thus in moving beyond an analysis of the notion of world as described above, Heidegger in Being and Time turns to a further analy- sis of Dasein itself in his quest ". . . that we should raise anew the question of the meaning of Being."49 47 Ibid, p. II9. 48 Ibid., p. 92. 49 Ibid., p. i9. 466 ADRIAN MICHAEL MIRVISH</page><page sequence="19">The above discussion of Heidegger suffices for our purposes for it enables us to see how Merleau-Ponty is indebted to him regarding the notion of being in the world. In particular, it is clear that Merleau- Ponty makes use of the notion of practical activity in a way which shows Heidegger's influence. This can, for example, be seen when Mer- leau-Ponty notes: . I understand the world because there are for me things near and far, foregrounds and horizons, and because in this way it forms a picture and acquires significance before me, and this finally is because I am situated in it and it understands me."0 One way to interpret Merleau-Ponty's claim that the world somehow understands me is to consider that for him, as for Heidegger, the subject is not one separate entity existing among a set of other separate entities all of which added together constitute the world. Rather the subject as the locus for any practical action is integrally related to the tools and utensils in terms of which a world is delineated for it. That is, there are for me utensils or "things near and far" and depending on the type of practical action performed at a prepredicative or non-thematic level, so correspondingly a world is revealed in terms of practical "foregrounds and horizons" as in the case of the builder and murderer above. Mer- leau-Ponty gives a specific example of my being situated in a practical world when he writes that, "if a picture has been removed from a living room, we may perceive that a change has taken place without being able to say what."5' Thus it seems reasonable to conclude that Merleau-Ponty has been influenced by Heidegger regarding the notion of being in the world insofar as this involves practical action. This similarity notwithstand- ing, there is however a major difference between the two thinkers regarding the place allotted to the body and perception. For on the one hand Heidegger pays scant attention to this topic indeed. This should not be surprising for, as was seen above, it is clear that for him, to con- cern oneself with "the question of the meaning of Being" is to move beyond a concern with the world qua world. On the other hand, for Merleau-Ponty it certainly seems to be the case from what has been said so far that to concern oneself with the same question is to automatically concern oneself with perception and the lived body, insofar as these delineate a world for the subject. That Merleau-Ponty does indeed exhibit such a concern, building as he does on what Scheler has to say, is something that will be substantiated in what follows. so Merleau-Ponty, PP, p. 408. SI Ibid., p. 3 2zI. It is interesting to note that this example comes out of a section of PP in which Merleau-Ponty is talking about Scheler. In fact Scheler's notion of "practical intelligence" corresponds to the notion of practical activity we have been discussing in connection with Heidegger. MERLEAU-PONTY AND THE NATURE OF PHILOSOPHY 467</page><page sequence="20">Section Four In this section, we will first examine another way of looking at the notion of being in the world, one described by Merleau-Ponty himself. This, in turn, will lead to the statement of a problem whose solution is seen as lying with the painter. Let us start by turning to a section of PP in which Merleau-Ponty shows how, as soon as we in any way reflect on what we take to be the concrete object of our experience, what we end up experiencing is not at all such an object but rather an abstraction. That we can indeed experi- ence what we think are objects but are only, in fact, abstractions, says Merleau-Ponty, is due to "the prejudices arising from objective think- ing." He continues by noting that: The function of objective thinking is to reduce all phenomena which bear witness to the union of subject and world, putting in their place the clear idea of the object as in itself and of the subject as pure consciousness. Although Merleau-Ponty does not use the following example, the notion of a volume generated by revolving a continuous function on a closed interval around the abscissa will serve as a good first illustration of the above. Thus, in the case where we are given f(x) continuous on [o,a], the volume V generated by revolving f(x) around the x axis is V = ,rr f~rdx. What happens here is that a "solid" S with volume V is said to be generated. Moreover, with f(x) continuous, S's boundaries can be exactly determined. Is S, however, a true object? According to Merleau- Ponty it certainly would not be so. For as a mathematical entity, S has no degree of hardness or smoothness, nor has it any color. In fact, Mer- leau-Ponty would hold that S is not an object at all, but rather a mere abstraction, and that in the process of generating S, one exemplifies the case in which one has "the clear idea of the object as in itself and . . . the subject as pure consciousness." This is not, of course, to suggest that only Merleau-Ponty would regard S as an abstraction, but rather, that S stands as diametrically opposed to what it is to truly expe- rience an object according to him. Thus, instead of being experienced, it would rather be the case for Merleau-Ponty that S is "posited."53 The next example to consider is one in which Merleau-Ponty dis- cusses how a die can be experienced in a number of ways, such that what may prima facie be taken as the experience of a concrete object, in fact, turns out to be only the experience of an abstraction. Moreover, abstraction here can occur at a number of levels. Thus, for example, Merleau-Ponty notes that as soon as I became (reflectively) aware that the die is presented to me as something visual, I am no longer experienc- ing a concrete object, but rather, I am left with a mere abstract entity. For, after all, as a visual entity, the die has no roughness or smoothness, s2 Merleau-Ponty, PP, P. 3 20 " Ibid., p. 3 2.6. 468 ADRIAN MICHAEL MIRVISH</page><page sequence="21">nor has it any weight. Thus, Merleau-Ponty writes that when I experi- ence the object as visual, ". . . I am left with nothing but the outer sur- face of the whole die: it loses its materiality, empties itself, and is reduced to a visual structure of form, color, light and shade."54 I go further and experience the die as yet a more abstract entity when I become (reflectively) aware that what is presented to me is always done so from a perspective. In Merleau-Ponty's terms, "I observe that the faces of the die cannot all fall beneath my gaze, and that certain of them undergo distortions."55 At this stage, says Merleau-Ponty, not only have I lost contact with a rough/smooth, hard/soft, etc., object before me - a contact which was already lost in the visual case - but I now tell myself that the visual entity will not accurately represent what I think the actual object itself should be like. Thus, I leave the visual entity per se, and in its place, deal with the die as a yet more abstract, perspectival entity. In fact, I am moving further and further towards "the clear idea of the object as in itself" and thus, more and more towards the mathematical type of entity S discussed above. What is clearly implied here is that the more we move "down the scale" from mathematical entity, to perspectival entity, to visual entity, the closer we are getting to what it is to truly experience an object. Moreover, we now know from the two previous sections that such an experience will be bodily and prepredicative. In general, it thus appears for Merleau-Ponty that the further from bodily contact we get vis-A-vis a particular object, the more abstract and adumbrated an entity we are left with. Given the above, we can now ask what picture emerges for Merleau- Ponty about what we might call the concrete or bodily experience of an object. We can start by noting that what we should expect from what has been said above is a bodily presence to an object which in some way resists the body as a holistic organism. Moreover, this presence is a prepredicative one which is organized and integrated in terms of Gestalt forms. But this means that any attempt to account for genuine experi- ence - as opposed to mere positing - is always going to involve a bod- ily presence correlative with that which is experienced; the two - lived body and that which is experienced - are inseparable except at the price of abstraction. Thus, Merleau-Ponty notes, ". . . the thing is correlative to my body and, in more general terms, to my existence, of which my body is merely the stabilized structure."56 54 Ibid., P. 32-4. " Ibid., p. 32 5. It is interesting to compare what Merleau-Ponty has to say of the die here with Alain's analysis of our perception of a die. Thus, c.f. Alain, Quatre-vingt-un cha- pitres, pp. 14-15. ,6 Merleau-Ponty, PP, P. 320 MERLEAU-PONTY AND THE NATURE OF PHILOSOPHY 469</page><page sequence="22">We would claim that Merleau-Ponty's using "correlative" above has a distinctly historical significance. For it was Husserl who, both in the stage of Ideas and in his later development made extensive use of this concept.57 Moreover, when Merleau-Ponty speaks about the various stages of abstraction from an object, he actually uses the term "reductions." What then is the significance of this? It seems as though Merleau-Ponty is deliberately using Husserlian terminology here in order to warn the reader not to go in Husserl's direction. For, according to the latter, the reductions were a philosophical necessity if we were to transcend the natural attitude and understand the true nature of things. For Merleau-Ponty, on the contrary, the reductions take us into yet another realm of mere abstraction. What philosophy, rather, needs to do is to go in the opposite direction of Husserl; away from abstraction and clearly delineated essences, with the assumption that this is what comprises genuine or scientific experience. Philosophy should, rather, attempt to deal with what we experience predicatively in a bodily fashion."8 The above discussion of the "reductions" can also serve as a third argument for what we have called being in the world. For if we "turn Husserl on his head" and realize that greater and greater degrees of abstraction are involved above in going from the seen cube to S, then by contraposition we can see that true experience of objects involves what has been called bodily presence to an object, an experience which 57 Thus, c.f., for example, (i) Edmund Husserl, Ideas, translated by W. R. Boyce Gibson (New York: Collier Books, 1972), sections 88 and go; (ii) Crisis, sections 46 and 48. 58 This, of course, does not mean to say that Merleau-Ponty wishes to extirpate all intel- lectual or "scientific" endeavor from philosophy as can be seen from a text such as the Primacy of Perception. Rather, he is saying, like Scheler, that any cognitive knowledge which we can have of the world is dependent on the experience of our lived body, and since philosophy has essentially ignored the latter issue, we must now turn to it. It should also be noted that Merleau-Ponty is criticizing the position of earlier Hus- serl in the section of PP under discussion. This is clear given that Merleau-Ponty him- self draws such a sharp distinction between earlier and later Husserl's work. Thus see, for example, "Philosophy as Interrogation. Themes from the Lectures," translated by John O'Neill (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, 1970), p. 105 ff. Here Mer- leau-Ponty makes it clear that for him, ". . . Husserl passed from 'philosophy as a strict science' to philosophy as pure interrogation . . ." In this light as he interprets the Husserlian concepts of Lebenswelt and Ineinander, Merleau-Ponty sees Husserl as eventually coming to adopt a position very close to that of Merleau-Ponty himself. In this light the interesting but complex issue arises as to the viability of Merleau-Ponty's interpretation of the later Husserl and to his concomitantly placing so much stress on this aspect of Husserl's work. Certainly it is clear that commentators such as Gur- witsch and F0llesdal who see the concept of the noema playing a central role in Hus- serl's overall philosophy would be at odds with what Merleau-Ponty has to say. For Gurwitsch's interpretation of Husserl see, for example, Aron Gurwitsch, Stud- ies in Phenomenology and Psychology (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, i966). For F0llesdal's interpretation of Husserl see, for example, Dagfinn F0llesdal's, "Husserl's Notion of Noema," Journal of Philosophy 66 (i969), pp. 680-87. 470 ADRIAN MICHAEL MIRVISH</page><page sequence="23">occurs at a prepredicative level. There is something distinctively ironic in what has been traced out so far. For, in effect, certain arguments have been developed over a good number of decades by the Gestaltists, Scheler, and Merleau-Ponty in reaction to the Empiricist and Intellectualist traditions. These argu- ments, of which we have seen three, all lead to the notion of being in the world which is said to be a prepredicative experience. Thus, in follow- ing out Merleau-Ponty's development, philosophy could be said to be moving in a strange direction. For insofar as it is a highly intellectual or cognitive discipline, it is told that it is a derivative activity and, more- over, is asked to turn its attention to a topic - being in the world which by its very nature is prepredicative. That this leads to various difficulties for Merleau-Ponty should hardly be surprising. In particular, the one which will concern us in what follows is how to further delineate the notion of being in the world. For even if we attempt to describe situations involving the lived body in as neutral and nontheory-laden terms as possible, it would still be all too easy to slip into tacitly making certain assumptions which Merleau-Ponty would find unacceptable. We can elaborate on this issue by noting the following passage in Eye and Mind: It is by lending his body to the world that the artist changes the world into paintings. To understand these transubstantiations, we might go back to the working, actual body not the body as a chunk of space or a bundle of functions... What Merleau-Ponty is thus saying we should not do in talking about the body is to refer to it in terms of the categories of "chunk of space" and "bundle of functions." Given the preceding text, it seems clear that by the latter Merleau-Ponty is referring to cybernetics; by the former he might mean behaviorism. But for that matter, if we substitute (contem- porary) functionalism for cybernetics, and neurophysiology for behav- iorism, the same criticism holds good, for both of these new categories, too, ignore the lived body. And moreover, even if we studiously try to avoid falling back on such categories, this would be hard to do. For given the present intellectual climate, one could well expect a philoso- pher to think of using mathematics or physiology, construed in the very broad senses of the terms, as paradigms to explain human behavior. In spite of these difficulties, Merleau-Ponty is convinced that it is pos- sible to go ahead and build a "methodical bridge" with which to further explicate the prepredicative notion of bodily presence to an object. In fact, he says of this "bridge" that, ". . . it is the making explicit or bringing to light of the prescientific life of consciousness. . . . It is . . . an intentional analysis."6, In attempting to give such an anal- ysis, however, at the same time-avoiding the above "bundle of func- 5 Merleau-Ponty, "Eye and Mind," p. 152. 6o Merleau-Ponty, PP, pp. 58-59. MERLEAU-PONTY AND THE NATURE OF PHILOSOPHY 471</page><page sequence="24">tions" and "chunk of space" pitfalls, Merleau-Ponty is led to make the following type of statements: Natural perception is not a science . . . it is the "opinion" or the "primary faith" which binds us to the world as to our native land, and the being of what is perceived is the antepredicative being towards which our whole existence is polarized. Visible and mobile, my body is a thing among things; it is caught in the fabric of the world, and its cohesion is that of a thing. But because it moves itself and sees, it holds things in a circle around itself. Things are an annex or prolongation of itself; they are incrusted into its flesh. *6I In order to further explicate these statements, it seems as though Merleau-Ponty has two possible alternatives at this point. First, it should be recalled that Gestalt psychology was said to be able to pro- vide us in principle with the phenomenological basis on which to study our "behavioral universe as revealed by methodical interpretation of [our] conduct." Thus, one could presumably further explicate the notion of being in the world by continuing with the type of work exem- plified by the Katz experiment discussed in Section Two, explicitly incorporating into it the notion of the lived body. Regrettably, this was simply not a major direction which Merleau-Ponty's work took, espe- cially after PP. The other alternative to the above challenge, one which Merleau-Ponty does take up, is to turn the work of the artist, and the painter in particular, in attempting to further explicate the notion of being in the world. In fact, in what follows we will show how, accord- ing to Merleau-Ponty, Cezanne makes use of the notions of Gestalt form and resistance, thereby presenting to the viewer of his paintings a direct expression of our bodily being in the world. In his article "Ce'zanne's Doubt," Merleau-Ponty talks about Cezanne's attempt to re-create nature on his canvases. This is to be con- trasted to the work of other painters: "He said of the old masters that they 'replaced reality by imagination and by the abstraction which accompanies it."'"6 The significance of the term "abstraction" should not be lost on us here. For we recall Merleau-Ponty showing above that what reflection lets us take as actual objects turn out to be nothing more than abstrac- tions: true objects, by contrast, are given to us bodily and prepredica- tively. Similarly, in what follows, it becomes clear that for Merleau- Ponty, Cezanne does not present us with mere abstractions, but rather gains the ability to present us bodily with what could be termed a re- creation of nature. We can elaborate on this point by noting the follow- 6i Ibid., pp. 3zi-zz; and "Eye and Mind," p. i63. 62 Maurice Merleau-Ponty, "Cezanne's Doubt," Sense and Non-Sense, translated by Hubert L. Dreyfus and Patricia Allen Dreyfus (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, i964), p. IL. 472 ADRIAN MICHAEL MIRVISH</page><page sequence="25">ing quotation: We live in the midst of man-made objects, among tools, in houses, streets, cities, and most of the time we see them only through the human actions which put them to use. We become used to thinking that all of this exists necessarily and unshakeably. Cezanne's painting suspends these habits of thought. ...63 What Merleau-Ponty is hence doing is to suggest that the apparently fixed and stable, mechanical objects of everyday use, and the world associated with them, do not really exist "necessarily and unshake- ably," and that Cezanne's painting provides a method enabling us to overcome such a static view of reality. We can elaborate on this by not- ing the following: [Cezanne] wanted to depict matter as it takes on form, the birth of order through sponta- neous organization. He makes a basic distinction . . . between the spontaneous organi- zation of the things which we perceive and the human organization of ideas and sci- ences. . . . Cezanne wanted to paint [the] primordial world. ...64 Thus beyond the difference between natural and mechanical or artificial objects, a more fundamental distinction which we have to note is between two aspects of the world. For on the one hand, there is our being in the world, which is characterized by the "spontaneous organi- zation" of our experience, where the reference here (it should by now be obvious), is to Gestalt forms. This is to be contrasted to the cultural or social world. The former is dynamic in the sense that Gestalt forms are, so to speak, constantly at work, organizing and delineating our imme- diate, bodily experience. The latter expresses the former in terms of phenomena such as language. But note that for Merleau-Ponty what is so valuable about the work of Cezanne is that it can somehow give us immediate access to the "primordial" and prelinguistic world of the lived body. It would be valuable in this context to now recall a distinc- tion between Merleau-Ponty and Heidegger made earlier. For Heideg- ger, we noted, saw himself having to move beyond an analysis of the phenomenon of the world in his search for "the question of the meaning of Being." For Merleau-Ponty quite the contrary is true insofar as this same question clearly necessitates his concerning himself with an analy- sis of perception and world, and hence in particular his concern with Cezanne. Merleau-Ponty talks specifically of Cezanne's ability to reveal the "primordial" world to us when he notes that "[c]ups and saucers on a table seen from the side should be elliptical, but Cezanne paints the two ends of the ellipse swollen and expanded."6' However, we should be careful not to suppose that our bodily or primordial world is simply one in which we experience "distorted" objects. For to take as literal what is 63 Ibid., p. i6. 64 Ibid., p. '3. 65 Ibid. MERLEAU-PONTY AND THE NATURE OF PHILOSOPHY 473</page><page sequence="26">meant by an "ellipse swollen and expanded" is already to have too static a picture of what it is that Merleau-Ponty, via Cezanne, is actually trying to convey to us. This point is one which Merleau-Ponty deals with when he notes that: . . . Cezanne discovered what recent psychologists have come to formulate: the lived perspective, that which we actually perceive, is not a geometric or photographic one. . . Gustave Geoffrey's table stretches into the bottom of the picture, and indeed, when our eye runs over a large surface, the images it successively receives are taken from different points of view, and the whole surface is warped."6 Thus, it is not merely that our experience is organized according to Ges- talt forms, a particular figure being given over against a specific back- ground, but rather, that the figure is quite literally changing constantly relative to its background. Now, says Merleau-Ponty, Cezanne is one who has the ability to re-create for us a figure as it actually changes rela- tive to a particular background. Thus, Cezanne is able to ". . . freeze these distortions in repainting them on the canvas . . ." and . . . stop the spontaneous movement in which they pile up in percep- 5567 tion. In addition to the above, that which Cezanne presents to us is not in any sense completely accessible. Quite to the contrary: ". . . the thing is not presented as spread out before us but is an inexhaustible reality full of reserves."68 Merleau-Ponty stresses this theme when he says of someone like Cezanne that he can portray reality as ". . . the imperi- ous unity, the presence, the insurpassable plenitude which is for us the definition of the real."69 Hence, in viewing Cezanne's paintings, one is never presented with an object or figure as fully given. There is always more to see, not only from the point of view of different perspectives, but also insofar as it literally takes work to see. That is, we have to expend effort in the attempt to view the "inexhaustible" subject mater which Cezanne presents to us. If we now recall the discussion at the end of Section Three of how, according to Merleau-Ponty, reality is pre- sented to us at a prepredicative level - viz., via the resistance which an "alien" object or "ek-stase" offers to the lived body - then we can understand that he is now using this same notion of resistance in explaining Cezanne's technique to us. For it takes effort to see, insofar as that which is seen resists our sight, and thus, we have a particular instance of the notion of resistance discussed above in more general terms. 66 Ibid., p. '4. 67 Ibid. 68 Ibid., p. i5. 69 Ibid. 474 ADRIAN MICHAEL MIRVISH</page><page sequence="27">We can summarize the above by noting that Merleau-Ponty uses both Gestaltist principles, and the notion of resistance which he gets from Scheler, in order to explain how it is that Cezanne can present us with a primordial world. For via his paintings, Cezanne can convey to us the dynamic nature of Gestalt forms and the intransigence or obduracy of that which is presented. In this way, says Merleau-Ponty, he has the power of being able to shake us into recognition of our fundamental bodily way of being in the world. For he is able to open up for us a dynamic and shifting world of immediate bodily experience whose exis- tence we were unaware of as long as we, in the "natural attitude," took our static, cultural and social world as more basic than it. If Merleau-Ponty's exposition of Cezanne is correct, then it is no wonder that the philosopher becomes indebted to the painter. For it will be recalled that we saw philosophy as an intellectual discipline placed in the dilemma of being forced to turn its attention to a phenomenon being in the world - which, by its very nature, is bodily and prepredi- cative. In this regard Merleau-Ponty suggests that Cezanne can help us in two ways. First, given the above, we can now see that he is able to show us, via the use of Gestalt forms and resistance, that we are indeed bodily in the world. Moreover, there is also the point that by viewing his painting often and seriously enough, we as philosophers will gradu- ally become aware of how our fundamental and basic presence in the world is a bodily and prepredicative one, rather than a cognitive and intellectual one. The point here is one touched on earlier, viz., that we have such a strong proclivity to see humans and the world in fixed and cognitive terms - for example, as "a chunk of space" or "a bundle of functions." But once we become aware of this fact, Cezanne's works offer us a remedy by contrast; one which will not only help to under- mine any Intellectualist type of assumptions which we make of the world, but at the same time, will allow us to become familiar with a rad- ically new and bodily way of experiencing, and hence subsequently explicating, our being in the world.70 We have thus seen Merleau-Ponty presented with two possible paths in an attempt to come to grips with problems raised by the notion of being in the world. One of these - which Merleau-Ponty did not follow in any great detail - would have involved him in pursuing work asso- ciated with the Katz type of experiment mentioned above. The other unusual path, which Merleau-Ponty did, in fact, follow, has been to look at the work of the artist in order to attempt to come to terms with the problem of what it means to be (prepredicatively) in the world. 70 We would claim that Merleau-Ponty uses the notions of form and resistance as a basis for his view of "seeing and been seen." This, in turn, further allows him to develop an answer to the problem of being in the world. Our purpose here, however, has merely been to show how, according to Merleau-Ponty, Cezanne's works, in particular, enable us to grasp this notion. MERLEAU-PONTY AND THE NATURE OF PHILOSOPHY 475</page><page sequence="28">Whether Merleau-Ponty has been entirely successful in this endeavor is a question yet to be answered. The above has, however, we hope, gone some way in helping to disabuse us of certain types of assumptions made by Intellectualists and Empiricists, and has offered us a promising alternative in their place. 476 ADRIAN MICHAEL MIRVISH</page></plain_text>
