<plain_text><page sequence="1">Siva as Dispenser of Royal Glory on Kushan Coins PRATAPADITYA PAL Among the various forms of the Hindu god Siva, referred to by the strange name Oesho, in Kushan coins, the most intriguing is a four-armed figure that appears first on a gold coin of the emperor Kanishka I (fig. 1). In this type the nimbated god, without his bull, stands imperiously facing to left. A tall, slim figure, he appears to be clad only in a dhoti and his hair is tied above his head in a top knot. His feet are splayed, as is common in Ku shan royal portraiture on coins, though not as con spicuously. He is given four arms which hold four or five different attributes with the hands. His lower-right arm is fully stretched, and the hand holds an elephant-goad and a vase of the Per sian type but clearly turned downwards. The upper-right hand clasps a thunderbolt, and the upper-left a trident. The remaining lower hand holds an animal whose form cannot be identified clearly, but it may be an antelope or a goat. It is certainly not a hide, and thus it may well be a live animal. In later Indian representations both ani mals are held by the god, although the antelope is a popular attribute in South Indian images. In at least one eighth-century bronze from Kashmir, Siva holds a goat in the same manner as in this Kushan coin type.1 Whether goat or antelope, the attribute may well emphasize Siva's important as pect as the lord of animals (pasupati). The trident, of course, is the most distinctive emblem of Siva, ,, , ., , , . , j 1 i ■ 1 i 1 i Ii Fig. 1.

In any event, that this specific iconography of Siva is the Indianized version of the Iranian royal investiture seems clear enough. Siva may also be proffering the elephant-goad to the monarch as a symbol of victory. It should be noted that in one of his coin types, Huvishka is shown seated on an elephant and holding an elephant-goad as a royal attribute.9 From Vedic times, the elephant has always signi fied royal pomp and might in India. .. , . , , It would be relevant to discuss here another at Fig. 4.

Buddha as well, by anthropomorphic Nikes, Tyches, "Amorini", and a variety of real or mythological birds and animals. All of these symbolize in some fashion the bestowal of heavenly victory upon heroes.12 Martha Carter goes on to suggest that this act of the gods, the profferment of the victory wreath or garland, symbolizes the second of George Du mezil's scheme of three functions in ancient Indo European mythology and society. Anointment by fire or water represents the first function for the royal-priestly stratum (brahman-räjan), while the victory garland "betokens the fulfillment of the destiny of the warrior-hero."13 By making Siva proffer water and the elephant-goad at the same time, the Kushan mintmaster may have intended to kill two birds with one stone, so to speak; whereas in those images where Siva offers a wreath or garland rather than a noose, the second function is being served.14 Notes 1. P. Pal, Bronzes of Kashmir (Graz, 1975), 56-57. 2. While I have not yet found an iconographie de scription of Siva specifically citing the thunderbolt, it is a weapon of the Vedic Rudra, the storm god who is frequently associated with lightning (see A. B. Keith, The Religion and Philosophy of the Veda and Upani shads, pt. 1 [Delhi, 1970], 143). In later puranic litera ture, Siva is often given the epithets Purandara, Ma ghavat, Sakra, etc., which are all synonyms of Indra, the wielder of the thunderbolt. 3. J. M.

After writing this paper, I sent the draft to my esteemed colleague and eminent numismatist, Martha L. Carter, for her comments. As some of these com ments (communicated in her letter) are pertinent to this discussion, I quote them below verbatim: It seems as though you have the Dumezilian first and second functions well covered with attributes. But, it might be pertinent to note that Siva himself is a third function deity par excellence, especially as Pasupati. Since the principal function of this class of deity is to maintain and promote plant and animal fertility, the animal attribute which he holds (not to mention his bull, nudity, ithyphallic attributes) make this clear. Again, I think a case can be made for the trifunctional character of Oesho as a divine supporter of Kushan royalty. To continue the relevance of the Dumezilian theory further, it may be pointed out that the three functions are well served by the trinity of the Hindu pantheon: Brahma (first), Vishnu (second), and Siva (third). 34</page></plain_text>
