<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE IDEA OF A «NEUTRAL» UNIVERSE IN THE FRENCH ENLIGHTENMENT By Lester G. Crocker Historians of the Enlightenment commonly assert, as if it were something that va de soi, that its thinkers found their moral values inscribed in a benevolent nature or cosmos. Thus Carl Becker found strange contradictoriness in the philosophes, who « ridiculed the idea that the universe had been erected in six days, but still believed it to be a beautifully articulated machine designed by the Supreme Being according to a rational plan as an abiding place for mankind. »! Speaking of nature, Paul Hazard wrote that for many, «EUe 6tait sagesse et elle 6tait bont6; que Thomme consentit &amp; Scouter la nature, et jamais plus il ne se tromperait. »2 Charles Frankel affirmed that in the minds of eighteenth-century thinkers, «Man was, or might be, at home in a universe devoted to his happiness. »3 Georges Gusdorf has written: «On peut meme penser que ce providentialisme incorrigible est Tun des points sur lesquels la pens6e des Lumieres nous est deve- nue etrangfcre, sinon meme incomprehensible. »4 Sir Isaiah Berlin contends that «the central doctrine of the Enlightenment, according to which the rules in accordance with which man should live and act and create, are pre-established, dictated by nature herself... One set of universal and unalterable principles governed inanimate and ani- mate nature. »5 Henry Steele Commager says of the philosophes: 1 The Heavenly City of the Eighteenth-Century Philosophers (New Haven, 1932), p. 25. There is no necessary contradiction involved, and the idea of finalism, even if true, is not necessarily Christian, as Becker apparently thinks. 2 La Penste europtenne au dix-huitfeme sfecle (Paris, 1946), I, 151. 3 The Faith of Reason (New York, 1948), p. 73. 4 «D6clin de la Providence?», Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Cen- tury, vol. 153 (Oxford, 1976), p. 982. 5 Against the Current (London, 1979), pp. 3, 18. 45</page><page sequence="2">LESTER G. CROCKER «They mixed up man and nature, nature and law.»6 Donald H. Meyer, in a book which carefully relates the American Enlight- enment to the French, notes the general view that «the study of nature and her wondrous design will prove the existence and the benevolent attributes of the divinity. . . Human striving does not take place in a morally indifferent universe. »7 Franklin's God (continues Meyer) «is also a moral governor and sustainer of virtue. He sees to it that virtue and happiness do indeed coincide » (p. 76). Only Charles C. Gillispie has gone so far as to find this view in the very character of eighteenth-century French scientific specula- tion, and most particularly in that of Diderot. «It is the basic theme of romanticism, composed by Diderot in the Enlightenment, » expressing «the aspirations of humanity to participate morally and through consciousness in the cosmic process. Those aspirations require a nature different from that described by post-Galilean science, » the nature of the Stoics: «its object is virtue rising out of nature, » cosmic personality «as the source of order... The sage... lays down rules of conduct from nature, and finds the correspon- dences and sympathies between cosmos personality, the great worlds and the little. » The eighteenth century, as Gillispie sees it, did not want a science describing a physical world « empty of morals and lessons. » Such was the perspective that « inspired Diderot's natu- ralistic and moralizing science. »8 I have selected quotations from scholars of recognized distinc- tion, with the conviction that the maxim of Polybius, who was refut- ing a predecessor, is appropriate: «But in my opinion, although the credit of the author is not to be esteemed lightly, one should not con- sider it as final; on the contrary, the reader should test the truth of his narrative from the facts themselves » {The Histories, Bk. Ill, Sec. 9). In this case, the facts are the texts; and we must at once admit that the preceding descriptions of a characteristic outlook have a solid foundation in many eighteenth-century texts - though not in those of Diderot or a number of important writers.

It is the very essence of the natural law tradition, which was continued in the eighteenth century by such writers as Burlamaqui and Volney. It was also exemplified in both France and England in the seventeenth and eighteenth-century tradition of religious apologetics, in such writers as Derham and Pluche, all the way to Bernardin de Saint-Pierre. And it was the vital faith of deism, the most conspicuous outlook of the period. Hume, who did not share it, summarized it well in his essay, «Of the Origi- nal Contract, » when he considers the relation between the contract theory and religion. Religion posits the deity as the ultimate author of all government, this being a part of a general providence which assures that «all events in the universe are conducted by a uniform plan and directed to wise purposes. »9 The basic thrust of deism was to have nature - God's nature - assume the normative functions traditionally performed in the Christian world by Revelation and Church dicta, in ethical, political and social problematics. In an age when critical rationalism, Biblical criticism, and the scientific spirit were together progressively under- mining the certainties of Christianity and its grip on the human intel- lectual enterprise, a major crisis in Western culture was developing. Its core was the validation of moral values. Their genesis, and their substantiation or refutation were problems that imposed themselves on minds of every shape. The deistic solution was beset with difficulties that were exploit- ed by both its Christian and atheistic opponents. The natural, for «pure» Christianity (as for Platonism) is a degradation. Human nature, at least, is eternally flawed though redemption is available through God's special dispensation for man, a relationship outside of nature. Yet Christian and deist agreed that nature is suffused with God and his providence, and that man is part of a cosmic order, which is a harmony and has a purpose and a meaning. Inevitably, problems arose. What is the relation between the two natures, cos- mic and human? Within each of the two, which facts become nor- 9 For a general discussion, see L.G. Crocker, An Age of Crisis (Baltimore, 1954) Chapter 1, «Man in the Universe. » It should be noted that there is another Christian tradition, represented by the Jansenists, which held that nature has nothing to teach man, corrupted by sin. 47</page><page sequence="4">LESTER G. CROCKER mative, which are to be repelled? The impossibility of answering such questions accounts for the subjectivism and confusion that plagued much but not all of eighteenth-century thinking. A further corollary of deism, according to Frankel (p. 68), was that «the implicit belief in the harmony of physical nature » led to the assumption «that human history followed a pattern that was both orderly and fortuitously adjusted to human interests. » This rash asseveration of Frankel's is one example among many of modern historians' drawing generalized conclusions from partial evi- dence. What he asserts is true for Turgot, Chastellux and Condor- cet. It is not true for Montesquieu, Voltaire, Rousseau, Diderot and other rather important thinkers. Henry Vyverberg's study, Histori- cal Pessimism in the French Enlightenment \ is an indispensable cor- rective. It is hoped that this essay will also be a corrective to similar kinds of partially founded generalizations on the subject I am treat- ing. The greatest predicament in which the deist, by attributing immanent value to cosmos, found himslef engulfed as in a quagmire was the problem of evil. It became the great intellectual scandal of the age. Max Weber has spoken of «the ineradicable demand for a theodicy. » Many of the best minds, from Leibniz to Rousseau, employed their keenest acumen to convince themselves and others that this circle could be squared. But Bayle had refuted every possi- ble argument, blocked all the avenues of escape. Nevertheless, the same tired arguments were reiterated over and again, as if repetition itself would ultimately impose conviction. Let us now summarize the foregoing. The concept of a non- neutral universe embodies several postulates. The universe is ration- al and harmonious - adjectives which correspond to human ideas or feelings. It is benevolent toward man. It contains and actualizes moral values, which we only reflect, values which are axiomatic and certain. The world is not empty of «ought.» It is not simply «is.» Human nature, it follows ineluctably, is definable, being a universal and unchangeable essence; or else the inscribed values would not have these characteristics, either. There is, then, a correspondence between nature-in-the-large and human needs, purposes and values. Whether one affirms that the cosmos recognizes and supports our valuational life, or whether the latter recognizes what exists outside 48</page><page sequence="5">THE IDEA OF A «NEUTRAL» UNIVERSE it - these are the two variations on a single article of faith. Finally, there is meaning (again an anthropomorphic term) in all there is, has been and will be. Consequently, when one uses the word «natural», it is possible to assign a meaning to it, and to bind or blend it into a value system - into, as it happened, whatever value system one pre- ferred. It was «natural» to be modest or to be immodest, as one chose; to help others or to hurt them, and so on. One writer claimed that the desire to recognize one's own children was a decadence from the natural, as is the desire for distinction.10 Of course, the oppo- nents of this metaphysical position (such as Diderot) pointed out that everything is natural. Nietzsche was later to mock the anthropo- morphic tradition: «Be natural! But how if one happens to be 'un- natural' ?»M It has been shown that there were two tendencies in Uto- pian fictions: a return to harmony with cosmic order, or the creation by rationality and will of a human order. However, the latter, too, was almost always designated as «natural.»12 We may use this contrast as a bridge, to cross from one mental shore, where specific, intrinsic meanings are attributed to «nature» and « natural, » to the other, less frequented but historically more significant shore, where it is held that there is no meaning outside of human meaning. Such a conclusion was a difficult one for mankind to come to and to accept. Jung described man as having «an intellect hungry for meaning, » unwilling to accept the fact that « nature simply is and 'means' nothing beyond that.»13 When the world is experienced as meaningless, Max Weber wrote, the demand surges up that «the world order in its totality is, could, and should some- how be a meaningful cosmos. »14 This is the core of religious rationalism. On the other hand, it would have been difficult for Enlightenment thinkers with critical minds to swallow a faith- inspired « explanation » or evasion and to be unaware of the possibi- 10 Tiphaigne de la Roche, quoted in Raymond Trousson, Voyages awe pays de nulle part (Bruxelles, 1975), p. 152. 11 The Will to Power, ed.

That sombre genius had asked us to make a leap to faith of another kind, in a purely divine rationality and justice unrelated to ours, forever hidden from men's eyes. But even if that were so (and how could we know?), what good was it to us? Did it make the world we do know, an enraged Voltaire demand- ed, any the less irrational and cruel? The men of the Enlightenment were scarcely in the mood for such a leap of faith. Thus while Christian and deist, each in his own way, persisted in seeing God's rational and moral fiats inscribed in cosmos and na- ture, the discrepancy between «is» and « ought » was written in let- ters too large to be ignored, yet too indecipherable to be explained. There was another factor. The scientific revolution had been slowly bearing its inevitable fruits. Although the clockmaker image persisted in deistic argumentation, it was clear to some that the uni- verse as a whole was not exactly a clock, with its ordered and orderly structure. The «rationality» of the Newtonian universe implied the essential stability and permanence of the rationally devised struc- ture, which excluded any real novelty, except by divine intervention. To this conception chance and more than superficial change were abhorrent. According to Gillispie, chance, change and development are notions that appertain to the Romantic idea of nature, which finds moral values or their support in nature. This is not necessarily so. In the eighteenth-century context, it was not necessarily so for two reasons. First, the assumed association of inscribed moral values with an ever-changing nature is, on the face of it, contrary to logic. The actual congeries of ideas then obtaining was stable nature, natu- ral law, objective moral law. The idea of a developing universe led instead, as in Diderot's mind, to that of a neutral universe. Second, Newton's mechanical cosmology, preceded by the mechanical cos- mologies of Galileo, Descartes, Gassendi and Huyghens, and hark- ing back to the speculative philosophy of Epicurus and Lucretius, could also produce the antithetical conception of motion, combina- tion and recombination as intrinsic to matter, and so to change, as nature's very essence.15 On this option, thinkers like Benoit de Mail- 15 For a summary of this question, see John C. Greene, «Objectives and Methods in Intellectual History,: The Mississippi Valley Historical Review y 44 (1957), 62-64. 50</page><page sequence="7">THE IDEA OF A «NEUTRAL» UNIVERSE let, La Mettrie and Diderot could conceive of matter itself producing life, sensitivity, and ultimately thought, but not at all in an orderly, designed or finalistic way. Living forms were not created, but devel- oped in a helted-skelter, trial and error process. «Monsters,» so much on the minds of speculators, were the proof of that. In Hume's eleventh of the Dialogues on Natural Religion, Philo de- clares: «Look round this universe... The whole presents nothing but the idea of a blind nature, impregnated by a great vivifying princi- ple, and pouring forth from her lap, without discernment or parent- al care, her maimed and abortive children !» In other words, univer- sal law was compatible with disorder as well as order, and God, as Philo says, has nothing to do with good or evil. This whole development may be summarized in Max Weber's phrase: the world was « disenchanted. » Disenchanted minds no longer needed to have recourse to « magical » means of explanation. One important aspect of the scientific enterprise was undergoing radical mutation. I do not wish to oversimplify. Seventeenth-century science, in England (Newton) and Germany (Leibniz), had the ideal end of showing the path to God, no longer in the medieval fashion, but by uncovering the traces of the divine plan in nature. In seven- teenth-century France, both the Cartesian dualistic and the Gassen- dist atomistic traditions did not seem to some critics to lead in this direction and so were accused of fostering atheism. Eighteenth- century astronomy gradually developed the idea of a mechanical, rigidly determined universe. In the life sciences, while many specula- tors, from Reaumur to Haller, remained providentialists, La Mettrie and Buffon were important exceptions. In sum, much of eighteenth- century science and speculation abandoned the pretension to know- ing the meaning of the world - or whether there is any. It tended rather to foster the elimination of references to «the meaning of the universe. »16 There was no way of ignoring the morally neutral philo- sophical conclusion - whether or not one sought ways of eluding it. 16 See Max Weber, «Science as a Vocation,» op. cit.t p. 142. Also, p. 351: «... science encounters the claims of the ethical postulate that the world is a God- ordained, and hence somehow meaningfully and ethically oriented cosmos. In prin- ciple, the empirical as well as the mathematically oriented view of the world devel- ops refutations of every intellectual approach which in any way asks for a 'mean- ing\..» 51</page><page sequence="8">LESTER G. CROCKER As Paul Hazard put it, «Etait-il certain que la nature finit toujours par sanctionner soit le bien, soit le mal?... En somme, la moralite veritable n'6tait-elle pas une protestation contre la nature brute, con- tre son indifference et son aveuglement?» (Op. cit., II, 185). Furthermore, if the world was a moral order emanating from divine creation (and if God created it, how could it be otherwise?), and if man was God's favored creation in whom its moral quality was actualized, why was human history, has Voltaire so eloquently lamented, an arena of disorder, crimes, and follies? Christians had their convenient explanation. But deists, who still sought for extra- human guarantees, had no recourse, as Frankel puts it in The Faith of Reason, but to postulate a hypothetical normative course of his- tory and to seek for the villains responsible for men's pathological deviations from it - priests, kings, prejudices or property, as one preferred. This was another form of the «bad faith » with which Hegel taxed the Enlightenment - some might say its willful self- delusion. The fault was man's, but Bayle had relentlessly demon- strated that it was ultimately God's, if there was a God. Man himself embodied disorder, and fomented it most particularly of all God's creation. The world had to be described as disorder, at the same time as order, whether God had put disorder into it, or whether, dismiss- ing God from the world, it was simply a fact of existence. How, then, could one look for guarantees «out there »? Advanced think- ers in the eighteenth century turned their eyes from the bright vacuity of the heavens to the turbid earth. Whether or not they were willing to declare it openly, there they saw that history is the experi- mental refutation of the theory of the so-called moral order of things; and they found disorder, as well as order, in the natural world. In the endless discussions of this web of thorny problems, careful semantic discriminations were usually ignored. If purpose, and so value, were intrinsic ontological elements, where was one supposed to look for them? The ultimate ground was God. But could God be distinguished from cosmos? The Christian and the deist said yes, and vituperated Spinoza for saying no. All was his creation, depen- dent on his ex nihilo fiat. And yet, as the relentless logician, Ber- trand Russell, was later to put it, to say that God is good «implies 52</page><page sequence="9">THE IDEA OF A «NEUTRAL» UNIVERSE that there is a standard of goodness which is independent of God's will.»17 The word « nature » was used even more often. Here the confu- sion was greater still. It was not only, as we have already pointed out, that the word, used normatively, meant anything and every- thing, and therefore ultimately nothing. The major confusion lay at a deeper level. What we discern in the texts, if we read them care- fully, is that the word is sometimes taken as signifying what I have called «Nature-in-the-large» - the actual world we perceive, ani- mate and inanimate, the entire phenomenal world, the universe as it is known to us. At other times, however, «nature» means only «human nature, » that which characterizes the species, and it alone. It would be difficult to exaggerate the importance of this distinction. To place the locus of value in Nature-in-the-large is one thing; to place it in human nature (a universal human nature was generally assumed), is quite another. The first assumption may be used to sup- port objective values, independent of human vagaries, individual or societal. This option would exclude a neutral or value- free universe. The second option, however, would not. The casual use of the word «nature» in eighteenth-century texts, with no attempt to make explic- it the concept implied, has led twentieth-century scholars, who also fail to make the distinction, astray. It accounts to a large degree for the faulty generalizations set forth at the outset of this article. It may not be possible to disentangle completely the entanglement we find in the texts, but to some extent we can and must do so. The notion that men delude themselves by looking for a friendly answer in a silent universe harks back to a long tradition in Western culture, a tradition stifled during the centuries of Christian intellec- tual hegemony. Eighteenth-century radical thought was in some ways close to that of the Sophists. There is a superior law of nature, which is not a moral law. It dictates survival and the pursuit of hap- piness, and is unrelated to human civil or moral laws. In Plato's dia- logues (Republic, Gorgias), we see that when Thrasymachus and 17 History of Western Philosophy (London, 1967), p. 133. Russell's argument recalls Plato and especially Malebranche: God must obey an order more powerful than his will, even if that order is inscribed in his wisdom. Eighteenth-century think- ers also found this idea in Grotius. 53</page><page sequence="10">LESTER G. CROCKER and Callicles put nature's law above social law, they are not appeal- ing to a higher moral authority, much less to one of universal or eter- nal validity, but to desire and power. Lucretius also challenged men's illusions about a friendly universe. Like Diderot, he rever- enced nature, but saw it as the undesigned and purposeless product of matter in motion. There is nothing else, but what man puts into it. However diversely Spinoza was understood (or misunderstood) by eighteenth-century philosophers, they agreed that he proclaimed an immutable order of law in nature, God's order; but as Richard H. Popkin has summarized it, Spinoza's God has no motives or pur- poses and favors no value properties.18 Man is impelled to self-affir- mation whithin an impersonal natural order, « whose processes and objects are forever in flux.»19 (It may be remarked that despite this, Spinoza was not a Romantic.) Justice Holmes valued Spinoza « pre- cisely because he regarded human good and evil as strictly human responses with no bearing on the meaning of the cosmos as a whole. »20 For Hobbes, too, the notions of right and wrong are extraneous to nature's functioning, which is reducible to matter and motion. Good and evil refer to no metaphysical essence, but only to our desires and aversions which, insofar as they are socially shared, acquire a prescriptive function. These are again understood as deriv- ing from the impulse to survival. Radical thinkers of the period we are discussing were familiar with these philosophers. They used them, found support in them, but their own thinking was independent of these forerunners and developed according to the exigencies of their own time. At the headwaters of the stream of radical thinking stands Pierre Bayle, who was one of the most acute logical minds France has known. Whether or not his destructive analytical criticism was exer- cised for the counter-purpose of demonstrating, like Pascal, the null results of reason and so to make fideism the only reasonable atti- 11 R.H.

Feuer, «Spinoza's Thought and Modern Perplexities, » ibid., p. 60. 20 Ibid., p. 53. 54</page><page sequence="11">THE IDEA OF A «NEUTRAL» UNIVERSE tude, is of minor historical import. What mattered was his legacy of erudite and critical shredding of any possible rationally based theo- dicy and of any metaphysics or ethics that presumed to justify itself on grounds of reason, nature, or supernatural epiphanies of value. If, to some thinkers, there is no eluding God's authorship of evil, the only escape-hatches are Manichaeism or accepting the fact that there is no analogy between the Creator and the creature. What Bayle makes clear is that while our moral axioms are inscribed in the human mind, there is no conceivable reason to attribute them to God, nor are they to be found in Nature. «Car, qu'est-ce, je vous prie, que la voix de la nature? Quels sont ses sermons? Qu'il faut bien manger et bien boire, bien jouir de tous les plaisirs des sens, pr6- f6rer ses interets k sa biens6ance, faire plut6t une injure que la souf- frir, se bien venger» (Continuation de Penstes diverses, n° 8). (Dide- rot's Rameau's nephew will only echo Bayle in his mockery of moral rules.) In fact, Bayle shuts nature out of the realm of moral phenom- ena, saying that the enthymeme, «this comes from nature, therefore this is good and right, » is false. Nature, he declares, «est un 6tat de maladie.»21 The universe is not made for man. How then to account for the «moral axioms»? Bayle gives us no answer. His role was not to supply answers but to demolish false answers. Many British and French philosophers will find their answer in utility and the social state. Bayle was a great dispeller of delusions and logical confusions. Implied in his reasoning is a repudiation of the careless, self-serving amalgamation of Nature and human nature as coincident and inter- changeable notions. It is true that materialists like La Mettrie deliber- ately blurred the distinctions, probably carried beyond their real opinion by the course of argument or anti-Christian polemics. Moralists and political philosophers, reformers and Utopians, writ- ers of treatises and of novels, counselled or exhorted men to live in conformity with nature and urged legislators to restructure institu- tions and laws to make them less contradictory to nature. They did not bother to ask themselves or to tell us which nature was to be our model, and which aspect of it. Bayle would have scathingly derided 21 Re*ponse awe questions d'un provincial, in CEuvres diverses (La Haye, 1737), I, 95 f. 55</page><page sequence="12">LESTER G. CROCKER their foolishness, their assurances of the happiness and harmony that would ensue from this airy nostrum.22 But later writers often found Bayle too inconvenient to be listened to. Even d'Holbach and Diderot, who knew what nature is in relation to morality, were victimized by the universal siren song. They did, however, draw the distinction when it came down to a fine point. Most often it was made implicitly by referring to specifically human motivations (e.g., Hume's sympathy and approbation), and then using the word « natural » without further ado. Vico unfortunately (for more rea- sons than this) was unread. He had expressed the essential idea, with clear brevity. Referring to incest, he cuts cleanly: «This is the infa- mous nefas of the outlaw world, which Socrates by rather inappro- priate physical reasons tried to prove was forbidden by nature, whereas it is human nature that forbids it.»23 La Mettrie was a doctor and scientific speculator who produced the most consistent system of materialism published in the eight- eenth century. He reduces mental and moral phenomena to motions of physical particles in which necessary law and blind chance are ultimately indistinguishable. He excludes finalities, purposes, mean- ings from nature; what we know as the. natural order is self- referring. He reiterates this belief in VHomme machine and Syst&amp;me d 'Epicure. «D6nu6e de connaissance et de sentiment, elle [la Nature] fait de la soie, comme le bourgeois gentilhomme fait de la prose, sans le savoir: aussi aveugle, lorsqu'elle donne la vie, qu'innocente lorsqu'elle la d6truit.»24 Since the universe is empty of moral value, there is no «problem of evil» for La Mettrie. The correspondence between man and nature also empties man of natural moral values. La Mettrie allows no special natural law for man. However, the identical laws of be- 22 «I1 n'y a guere de mots dont on se serve d'une maniere plus vague que celui de nature.

In this sense, remorse and conscience are natural. La Mettrie consid- ers them useless and regrettable, spoilers of pleasure. His overtly expressed intention in Anti-S4n$que was to be perfectly rephrased by Nietzsche: «To restore a good conscience to the evil man.» Nature prescribes no limit to the impulses of the ego except those of pru- dence. When the organic forces which drive us to seek happiness or pleasure do so in anti-social ways, there is no « wrong » involved, since nature compels, and in compelling, knows no moral distinc- tions. Society has the right to protect itself, that is, to use its force. Force is necessary because obligation is not a natural but a learned experience, and because moral distinctions are arbitrary (though socially useful) inventions, without any genuine moral content. Morals are then a form of politics and are not related in any way to nature-in-the-large. In a word, so-called moral phenomena are spe- cial results of the non-moral substratum which alone is natural. Unlike La Mettrie, Buffon was certainly not held to be a radical thinker, despite some brushes with orthodoxy. Since he was the most respected French naturalist of the age, his views on man's relation to the universe and to nature are of particular interest. First, Buffon eliminates God from both scientific and ethical dis- course. God did not launch the planets or create life, and he does not intervene in the course of phenomena. But he is the creator of nature's laws. A pure intelligence, he is unintelligible to us. He is utterly alien to human passions.25 In 1785 Buffon said to H6rault de S6chelles, « J'ai toujours nommS le Cr6ateur; mais il n'y a qu'4 oter ce mot et mettre naturellement k la place la puissance de la nature».26 Second, the universe is a rational order. However, it is an imper- sonal order. It is accessible to the human mind, but only as probabil- ities, with no metaphysical guarantees. First causes, essential reali- ties are inaccessible to us. We must especially beware of our natural 25 Buffon, De la Nature, «Premiere Vue, » in Corpus Ge'ne'ral des philosophes francais, ed. J. Piveteau, Paris, 1954, p. 31. See the essential studies of Jacques Roger: Buffon, Les Epoques de la nature (Paris, 1962); Les Sciences de la vie dans lapense'efrancaise du XVIIPsiecle (Paris, 1963), to which this brief discussion owes a great deal. 26 Roger, Sciences, p. 582 n. 57</page><page sequence="14">LESTER G. CROCKER tendency to project our ideas and feelings into the universe, and above all, avoid looking for moral causes («convenances morales») in sciencific study, since this can only «alterer la realite et confondre les objets de nos sensations, de nos perceptions et de nos connaissan- ces avec ceux de nos sentiments, de nos passions et de nos volontes.»27 Third, on the level of nature (that is, phenomena), we must never look for a divine order or providence. We are dealing only with an order of facts. What do these facts reveal? They reveal an order that is rigorous in its laws of cause-effect and its formal structures, and yet is «un mouvement de flux continuel» from which disorder is not excluded. In fact, according to Jacques Roger, chance takes the place of God in Buffon's thought.28 Finally, what is man's relation to the cosmos and to nature? «Un individu, de quelque espece qu'il soit, n'est rien dans l'Univers; cent individus, mille, ne sont encore rien: les especes sont les seuls etres de la Nature. »29 A man, like the rest of nature, responds to imperson- al forces. These forces (e.g. the reproductive urge) induce feelings in individuals, but in nature there is only destruction and renewal. Some things in it we experience as useful, others as harmful. «Ces variations, si sensibles pour Thomme, sont indifferentes &amp; la Nature... elle ne protege pas les unes aux depens des autres, elle les soutient toutes» (ibid., pp. 37-38). Our moral world is therefore ours alone. When Buffon speaks of the different kinds of truths, he makes no separate mention of moral truths, saying only, «l'exp6- rience est la base de nos connaissances physiques et morales » (pp. 456-57). Elsewhere he writes, « Je ne parlerai pas des autres ordres de verites, celles de la morale, par exemple, qui sont en partie r6elles et en partie arbitrages... d'autant plus qu'elles n'ont pour objet et pour fin que des convenances et des probability... Les v6rit6s physi- ques, au contraire, ne sont nullement arbitrages et ne dependent point de nous» (p. 24). The moral realm is thus divorced from other natural phenomena: «la convenance morale ne peut jamais devenir une raison physique » (p. 242). For Buffon, this conclusion does not 27 Corpus, p. 258; Roger, Sciences, pp. 541-42. 28 Epoques, p. cxi. 29 Corpus, p. 35. 58</page><page sequence="15">THE IDEA OF A «NEUTRAL» UNIVERSE exclude, in logic or in fact, belief in a universal human nature or a universal morality grounded in human nature. But it is a way of looking at things that is very different from the generalizations out- lined at the beginning of this paper, since it puts man - as Buffon always did - in a realm apart and leaves him on his own. The attitude of d'Alembert, also eminent and respected as scien- tist and philosopher, is surely significant. Like Buffon, he went to great pains to conceal his true opinions and to express himself deviously. His covert critique of deism rests on the problem of theo- dicy. In this he follows Bayle rather closely. In the course of his argument he says that the metaphysician «ne dira point avec d'autres, pour sauver la justice de Dieu, que cet Etre si bon, si par- fait et si sage, produit tout le physique des crimes sans en produire le moral... et se contente de leur [designated only as «d'autres»] demander pour leur fermer la bouche, comment Dieu apr&amp;s avoir produit tout le physique des crimes, punit ensuite le moral: effet nicessaire de ce physique. »30 If we are to look for God's existence, then we should look into the invariable laws of bodies, which «paraissent driver de l'existence meme de la mati£re» (pp. 148-149). These constitute an order. Clearly, it is only a physical order - value-free. D'Alembert upholds the existence - among men uniquely - of a universal morality or natural law, «les devoirs dont nous sommes tenus envers nos semblables.» These, too, have only one explana- tion: «ils tendent k nous procurer le plus sur moyen d'etre heureux, en nous montrant la liaison intime de notre veritable int6ret avec l'6tablissement des soci6t6s.» He agrees, pro forma, that the Creator made men social beings, but immediately adds, «I1 n'en faut pour- tant pas conclure avec quelques philosophes, que la connaissance de ces principes suppose necessairement la connaissance de Dieu... C'est done k des motifs purement humains que les soci&amp;6s ont du leur naissance» (pp. 179-82).

CROCKER tion de P esprit, pour nous donner Pid6e du mal physique, il est evi- dent que dans l'ordre de nos connaissances, c'est cette idee qui nous conduit k celle du mal moral. »31 In the Discours pr&amp;iminaire d'Alembert declares that nature knows only the law of force, the abuse of which leads men to ideas of right and wrong (p. 20). He adds one other crucial reservation. Moral virtue is actually unnatu- ral. No natural law impels us to sacrifice: «cet h6roi'sme, si on peut appeler ainsi un sentiment absurde, ne saurait etre dans le coeur humain» (p. 192). Only the enlightened love of our own happiness makes us want to be at peace with ourselves and win the esteem of others. It is obvious that for d'Alembert there is no ground for moral judgments and moral value in a supernatural Being, in cosmos, or in nature-in-the-large. Nor are they to be found in human nature as such, except derivatively, as a cultural development from the natural (survival) need for social existence. Such cultural creations, reduc- tively viewed, are essentially prudential considerations which become accepted as moral laws. Helv&amp;ius was more outspoken than d'Alembert. In De VEsprit (Chapter XXV, «De la probit6 par rapport k l'univers»), he cuts man off, on the decisive point at issue, from all else that is. Although he reintegrates man into the animal world by submitting him to a common law of sensation (hence pleasure and pain), he finds no hint or trace of moral values in the entire cosmos.32 And among men themselves, there is no universal (i.e., natural) morality. We live in a state of war. «Sans int6ret d'aimer la vertu, point de vertu» (p. 216). One cannot speak of good or evil as metaphysical realities; but men are aggressive toward each other and so, consider- ed socially, are evil by their nature. Fortunately, they can be molded. So-called virtues and vices are nothing more than responses of person- al interest according to the way men are « modified » (read: «condi- tioned»), and are value judgments related only to the public 31 In the Discours pr&amp;iminaire de I'Encycloptdie, he puts it slightly differ- ently: «I1 est Evident que nos notions purement intellectuelles du vice et de la vertu... sont le fruit des premieres idles r6fl£chies que nos sensations occasionnent» (Ed.

Outside of the context of society and its self-interest, one cannot speak of moral value (pp. 52-53). Chastened by the condemnation of his book, Helv6tius left much for his posthumous treatise, De VHomme}1 There he declares that nature knows no law except force. Yet the human moral experience is real. It is the work of culture; our nature merely supplies the raw elements out of which it is built. Outside of human beings the uni- verse is empty of moral value or meaning. We shall now turn to three important thinkers whose posture concerning neutral morality is doubtful or inconsistent. We must remember that the philosophes were moralists, men yearning for an incontestable ground for morals. Unable to find it in the absolute form they sought, they often indulged in self-delusion or the eva- sions of «bad faith, » striving to convince others and perhaps them- selves that virtue and happiness were like physical cause and effect, even while the only analogue they found was the law of pleasure and pain. Some, like d'Alembert and Diderot, had a « secret doctrine. » Infrequently did they have the courage to avow that the immoralist could not be refuted or judged in terms of metaphysics or existence itself, though such a position was sometimes consigned to unpub- lished works or exemplified in fictional writings (as was the case par- ticularly with Diderot). Voltaire's outlook strikes us as chaotic, largely because he under- went cyclothymic spells of pessimism and optimism. He clung to God as the guarantor of moral law and a rational universe; but he increasingly took positions which made that belief more difficult and more tenuous. His painful revolt against theodicies is well known. It culminated, in his middle period, that of the Potme sur le D&amp;astre de Lisbonne and Candide, with a divorce between God and man. God may at the outset have made provision for certain life- enhancing attributes; but then he abandoned men, caring no more about their fate than the ship's owner cares about the rats in its hold. Candide paints an absurd, chaotic and amoral world-view, immoral only for men, who alone have a moral experience. God's universe may be intrinsically rational, but if so, its rationality is hidden from 33 Londres, 1776, pp. 82, 201-209. 61</page><page sequence="18">LESTER G. CROCKER us except in physical phenomena. In Zadig (1747), Voltaire had already signalled the divorce by distinguishing, in an important pas- sage that opens the chapter «La Femme battue, » between the objec- tive view and the realm of subjectivity, in which man must live and which is his alone. From the Olympian viewpoint, that of «le n6ant de son etre» and «l'ordre immuable de l'univers,» Zadig's troubles approach a zero limit. As he experiences them, however, «il ne voyait dans la nature entidre qu'Astart6 mourante et Zadig infor- tun6.» He is alien to the world, which does not recognize him; but the human world has its own reality and in it we live. Although cosmos, nature, and God in historical time are all indifferent to man, there is a universal human nature, Voltaire be- lieved, hence a moral natural law, whose universal provisions he repeatedly lists. When he declares in L'A,B,C that nature does dis- tinguish between right and wrong («le juste et l'injuste»), and when ce makes this attribution to nature the only possible validation of moral distinctions («Si la nature ne discernait pas le juste et l'injuste, il n'y aurait point de difference morale dans nos actions »), it is per- fectly clear that he is referring to human nature only;34 and his ten- dency to coalesce natural law and social utility implies the derivation of moral values from man's natural sociability, which he always upheld against Rousseau's theory. This viewpoint is explicit in L'A,B,C for instance, where «natural law» is reduced to self- interest and reason (p. 272). The further implication of Voltaire's work is that nature-in-the-large justifies nothing, and that we must go beyond it in order to « justify. » Some of Voltaire's later writings signal a retreat from these posi- tions, and the Histoire de Jenni (1775) may even be regarded as a weak palinode. One must agree with Pierre R6tat that Voltaire's thinking was shadowed by the need to avoid a scandalous impasse, and that, as a result, «on le voit tomber successivement dans toutes les 'd6faites' dont Bayle avait montr6 la vanit6.»35 Rousseau's approach to this major problem of eighteenth- 34 Voltaire, Dialogues et anecdotes philosophiques, ed.

He repeated the hackneyed arguments of theodicy, but expressed them with emo- tion and poetical rhetoric. Rousseau's cosmos is suffused with God, whose eternal justice is revealed to men in their God-given con- science. When we look closer, however, we see that nature itself, though God-created, is devoid of anything resembling this direct relation between God and man. Rousseau's view really manifests a reversion to the primitive Christian outlook, the order of priority being God-man-nature, so contrary to post-Darwinian, or even to eighteenth-century transformist thinking, whose model is [God] - nature-man. We must regard this shift as a major reversal in the Weltanschauung of Western culture. Physical nature, for Rousseau, is indifferent, though benevo- lently designed. Animate nature is a value- free balance in which spe- cies live on each other. There is, then, no place to look for God's moral law except in human nature or conscience. It is present no- where else in nature or cosmos. But human nature, strictu sensu, is not at all moral. The natural or original man had no moral conscience, knew no distinction of right and wrong, only a feeling of compas- sion for his fellows when his own self-interest was not damaged by it. The moral realm - that of sacrifice or the suppression of natural impulses - was unknown to him. The moral realm is therefore unnatural. In political terminology - and Rousseau says that morals and politics cannot be dissociated - men are not naturally « citizens, » not naturally social animals. Yet Rousseau holds men to be naturally moral, referring to a potentiality which realizes itself inevitably as soon as history brings about social organizations. They then enter into the moral realm of right and wrong and moral natu- ral law. Because nature is faulty, because men are torn between conscience (moral and social obligation) and natural egocentric drives, exacerbated in social competition, because they live in a con- dition of internal and social strife in which the moral and social almost always lose out, Rousseau devised his political and education- al schemes. Their purpose was to heal this scission, to end .the various forms of alienation, to make men into social beings - to do through the work of culture, through will and raitonal planning, what nature had not done. In this way, nature and freedom may be 63</page><page sequence="20">LESTER G. CROCKER recovered in transmuted forms, unknown to nature herself.36 We may remark in passing that the interpretations and annotated edi- tions of Rousseau offered by political scientists of our day are flawed because they consider him a political philosopher. He was that, but he was much more than that: he was a philosopher. Our third and most marked case of inconsistency is that of the atheist, baron d'Holbach, whose Systeme de la nature (1770) sent shock waves through many lands. A thoroughgoing materialist in all matters that do not touch on morals, he was an incorrigible moralist who seems to attribute a mystery to nature, a finality unexplained and unexplainable in naturalistic terms. The contradic- toriness becomes rather startlingly apparent in the summations of two scholars. Allen Kors writes that d'Holbach « condemned the impulse to personify nature, to believe that nature cared for man, to call 'natural' the things man deemed good and 'unnatural' the things man deemed evil. This has been the error of the deists and their 'God of Nature', and it stemmed from an inability to face the amoral necessity of the world realistically, » a world which is only a vast chain of causes and effects.37 Pierre R&amp;at finds a different philos- ophy in d'Holbach. «I1 reconstruit un optimisme dont plusieurs aspects rappellent k s'y m6prendre les arguments de la th6odic6e classique que Bayle avait r6fut6s... Ainsi r6apparait subrepticement le finalisme naturel... Concept m&amp;aphysique, la 'nature' de d'Hol- bach est toute p6n6tr6e de valeur» (op. cit., p. 427). Both Kors and R6tat are correct. Each has co-opted one aspect of d'Holbach's contradictory positions. Since it is impossible to reconcile them, one must either assume a Janus-d'Holbach or accept Rousseau's accusation of a « doctrine secrete, » meaning that the 36 See L.G. Crocker, «Order and Disorder in Rousseau's Social Thought, » PMLA (1979), pp. 247-60. 37 Allen C. Kors, D'Holbach's Coterie. An Enlightenment in Paris (Prince- ton, 1976), p. 77. «D'Holbach's vision of the cosmic solitude, vulnerability and ultimate perishability of man, one which saw man as the sole source of his own gui- dance, was not, for example, an inherently cheering one... [but] only the sobering awareness that the universe was blind would allow man to alter that part of it which was, in fact, capable of his alteration» (p. 139). Boswell described d'Holbach's theme as «the supposition of an eternal necessity, without design, without a govern- ing mind.» (The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, ed. P.W. Chapman [Oxford, 1974], p. 189). 64</page><page sequence="21">THE IDEA OF A «NEUTRAL» UNIVERSE first position represents his real belief. Again one could justify both these propositions. What I should like to argue for here is a third alternative: d'Holbach's separation of human nature from nature- in-the-large. At the very outset of the Syst$me, he is at great pains to declare that while nature as such has no finalities or meanings, man has a distinctive « organization » which puts him in «une classe k part,» though remaining within the nature he conceives of as all- that-is.38 At the end of this opening chapter d'Holbach emphasizes the «neutrality» of his concept. «Ainsi quand je dis que la nature veut que Thomme travaille k son bonheur... j'entends par Ik qu'il est de Pessence d'un etre qui sent, qui pense, qui veut, qui agit, de tra- vailler k son bonheur. » In other words, the attribution of «will» to nature is a figure of speech, a personification, no more. The word « natural » denotes only what is in conformity with things as they are obliged to exist, according to their properties. Order and disorder are not to be found in the universe except as projections of our own minds; «comme toutes les idees abstraites et metaphysiques, [ils ne supposent] rien hors de nous» (p. 61). From this metaphysical basis of a neutral universe, d'Holbach will deduce a system of «natural» morality and the equivalence of virtue and happiness. At the same time, like Helvetius and the other materialists, he reduces all motiva- tion to self-interest, and moral judgments to education and habit, effectively excluding any ontological reality from moral experience. Most men do wrong things without being troubled, and whole nations may do abominable deeds. La conclusion s9 impose. What- ever the fallaciousness of d'Holbach's system, it does not support, taken as a whole, the generalizations outlined at the beginning of this paper. The centerpiece of C.C. Gillispie's argument is Diderot. His reading of the De V Interpretation de la nature convinces him that for Diderot the aim of science is « moral insight into nature » rather than « mathematical abstraction from nature » {pp. cit.9 p. 190). The texts, however, indicate a quite different meaning, neither one nor the other of these. Gillispie also reverses the sense of Diderot's state- ment in Jacques le fataliste that there is no meaningful distinction between the physical and the moral world, taking it to imply that the 38 Systeme de la nature (Londres, MDCCLXXI), 2 vols., I, 10. 65</page><page sequence="22">LESTER G. CROCKER physical world is moral. According to Gillispie, Diderot was one of «the romantics of the Enlightenment » because he believed in the dynamic unity of nature. He was also akin to the Stoics, because he gave ontological significance to « activity, » and not to matter. In fact, the two are indissociable or indistinguishable for Diderot. Gil- lispie taxes him for emphasizing « becoming » (like the Romantics), rather than being (p. 183). Yet the « becoming » known as evolution was to be rather important in late nineteenth-century and twentieth- century science.39 Metaphysically, the dichotomy of becoming and being may be considered as illusory, and one may hold that there is no being without becoming, just as there can be no becoming without being. Diderot's metaphysics is based on a fundamental reality, matter and process: The inherent and ceaseless activity that consists of mat- ter passing through a flux of impermanent stable forms resulting in emergence of more complex structures in which stability (or counter- entropy) is ever more tenuous.40 Jacques Chouillet affirms that for Diderot «le d6sordre figure dans la nature au meme titre que l'ordre... Une nature productrice de monstres est par definition aveugle et sourde &amp; nos postulations.»41 Chouillet summarizes: «s'il n'y avait pas la presence de l'homme pour donner un sens aux objets de la nature, ces objets n'en auraient par eux-memes aucun» (pp. 91- 91). He quotes a line from Diderot's article, « Encyclopedic »: «si on bannit l'homme ou l'Stre pensant et contemplateur de dessus la sur- face de la terre, ce spectacle path£tique et sublime de la nature n'est plus qu'une scdne triste et muette.» Diderot envisioned the universe as the self-development of a primal, non-rational force, as purpose- less, meaningless movement, an idea similar to Nietzsche's becom- ing aims at nothing. » In the Lettre sur les aveugles (1749), Diderot tells ut that morals are experiential contrivances for survival. The universe is not an orderly clock-mechanism, but a chaotic force in which everything is 39 This is also the opinion of John C. Greene, loc. cit. Among those who developed a notion of evolution before Darwin, La Mettrie and Diderot alone re- fused to attribute it to the teleological character of being God-directed. 40 L.G.

There is a cosmic order, but it is the transient outcome of trial and error in an endless process devoid of final causes. That we can never understand the essentials of being is implied here. It is made explicit in De I'lnter- pr&amp;ation de la nature (1753). Diderot rejects mathematics as ulti- mate explanation not for Gillespie's reasons, but because it does not correspond to an objective structure of reality, which we can only approximate through experimentation. The disprizement of mathe- matics is the repudiation of metaphysics (Pensees, II, III, VI) conse- quently, contrary to Gillespie, of any attempt to find meaning in the cosmos. Nature's order is a self-regulating system of transforma- tions (Pens6e XXXVI). When Diderot writes in De la Poteie drama- tique, «tout est bon dans la nature; et l'ouragan, qui s'61dve sur la fin de Tautomne, secoue les forets et frappant les arbres les uns con- tre les autres, en brise et separe les branches mortes,» etc.,42 the adjective «bon» does not imply any regard for human needs or notions, but only the impersonal and ruthless efficiency of natural processes. The dialogue between Diderot and the abb6 in the Salon de 1767 is decisive: Ce monde n'est qu'un amas de molecules pip6es en une infinite de manieres diver- ses. II y a une loi de n6cessit6 qui s'ex&amp;ute sans dessein, sans effort, sans intelli- gence, sans progres, sans resistance dans toutes les oeuvres de la nature... Ce bel ordre qui vous enchante dans l'univers ne peut etre autre qu'il est. Vous n'en con- naissez qu'un, et c'est celui que vous habitez; vous le trouvez alternativement beau ou laid, selon que vous coexistez avec lui d'une maniere agreable ou p£nible. J'en &amp;ais la, losrqu'un vent d'ouest, balayant la campagne, nous enveloppe d'un 6pais tourbillon de poussiere. L'abt&gt;6 en demeura longtemps aveugle; tandis qu'il se frottait les paupieres, j'ajoutai: «Ce tourbillon qui ne vous semble qu'un chaos de molecules dispers^es au hasard; eh bien! cher abb6, ce tourbillon est tout aussi parfaitement ordonne" que le monde. »43 Diderot never assumes (like the deists) that nature operates in ways particularly referential or beneficial to man. It is man (Lett re sur les aveugles) who has adapted himself to an indifferent nature. In Le Reve de d'Alembert (1769), Diderot writes poetically of the universe as an organic whole.44 His other writings show that by a 42 CEuvres esth&amp;iques, ed.

CROCKER whole he means that every event has an effect, which is in turn a cause, in linear sequence.45 Nature is the totality of what exists, i.e., phenomena. It is not the sum, but the series of these phenomena, since it cannot be properly considered in any way that abstracts it from time and change. At any chosen moment it may be considered as a sum; but that is precisely to abstract a moment and consider it as equivalent to the reality we call Nature, which, however, does not fit within that kind of extra-temporal framework. There is no cosmic organism, since for Diderot that word means an entity in which the parts act in concord toward the realization of a single, common pur- pose. The notion of organism is, however, irrelevant to the problem we are treating. In the same work in which he poetically speaks of the cosmos as an organism, he declares emphatically and repeatedly that the universe is void of values, that there is no ground for values in Nature; everything is equally natural and, from that viewpoint, equally valid - or more exactly, outside validation. It is impossible, he says, to «p6cher contre nature... Tout ce qui est ne peut etre ni contre nature, ni hors de nature. »46 The same ideas recur in Diderot's last words on this subject, in the Elements de physiologie (1774-80). «Mais l'ordre g6n6ral change sans cesse... sans qu'on puisse dire que le tout s'amende ou se d6t6- riore.»47 In a brief phrase, he epitomizes his conception of a value- free natural universe: «Le monde est la maison du plus fort» (p. 307). But men have their own finalities. It is well known that Diderot categorically distinguishes man from nature-in-the-large (though he is within its all-enfolding whole), and enphasizes the differentiae. We see this in De I9 Interpretation de la nature (Pens6e XL VIII), again in his outbursts against Helvetius («il me faut des causes pro- 45 My impression is that Diderot's view is essentially similar to that of Berke- ley (De Motu&gt; 1721), that the inertial properties of matter on a small scale are deter- mined by the behavior of matter on a cosmic scale. This was also, in our time, the idea of Einstein and of Ernst Mach, who put it this way: « When we say that a body preserves unchanged its direction and velocity in space, our assertion is nothing more or less than an abbreviated reference to the entire universe. » The Science of Mechanics, quoted by Sir Bernard Lovell, Man's Relation to the Universe (San Francisco, 1975), pp. 103-104. 46 QSuvres philosophiques, pp. 300, 311, 364-65, 375, 380. 47 Ed.

There is a universal human nature, because there is a universal human expe- rience and rational endowment. If there are universal moral judg- ments, they derive from uniformities of needs and structures, biological and social, and from nowhere outside of man, certainly not from a blind nature. But moral values cannot be established metaphysically, are repugnant to the constitution of many indivi- duals, contradict other natural drives, and are open to challenge.49 Diderot never doubts that man is naturally and necessarily moral in his reactions to experience. Human reason requires moral value.50 The welfare of society requires it. Therefore Diderot, in his public writings, proclaims virtue-happiness and vice-unhappiness as a cause-effect natural in human beings, though in his private writings he brings out the empirical falsity of this nostrum of «bad faith. »51 It must also be admitted that Diderot's «Trinity» of «the good, the true and the beautiful » expresses an idealist position. On the other hand, the aesthetic of evil and ugliness is an important element in his theory and in his fictional practice - before Baudelaire and other moderns. The inner meaning of his « Trinity » has no reference to value in the universe itself. It implies that for the human mind, there is a relationship with nature; as it apprehends phenomena and evaluates them, the three orders lose distinctness and coincide. But this (even if true), takes place, like the experience of beauty itself, in the mind. Outside of it, there are only neutral objective phenom- ena and relationships which the mind may or may not apprehend in this way.52 48 Refutation de I'Homme, CEuvres philosophiques, pp. 564 et passim. 49 «Droit naturel» (Encyclopedic), Le Neveu de Rameau, etc. 30 «Croire» (EncyclopMe), O.c, xiv, 243. 51 Such a relationship becomes meaningful only «by supposing a direction of things sub specie boni.» It presupposes that reward and punishment « reside in the essence of things. » (Nietzsche, op. cit., pp. 140, 417.) In his playful primitivist Uto- pia, Le Supplement au Voyage de Bougainville, Diderot pictures men as happy when they live according to «nature's laws» alone. But the Tahitians in Diderot's idyll do not live according to nature alone; and this work is riddled with contradic- tions which scholars have usually overlooked. 52 See the several discussions in Crocker, Two Diderot Studies (Baltimore, 1952). 69</page><page sequence="26">LESTER G. CROCKER Our discussion of Diderot may now be summarized under two headings. First, Diderot was of course aware of the traditional distinction between natura naturans and natura naturata. Even as his concep- tion of the latter (i.e., the phenomenal world) differed from the tra- ditional one in the ways we have seen, so also did his idea of the for- mer depart from it. Traditionally, natura naturans was taken to be the principle or ground explaining natura naturata. It was transcen- dent, even when considered to be also immanent - God the creator, or the Spinozist God. Diderot eliminates any element of transcen- dency. In fact, he eliminates the distinction, totally. «Natura natu- rans» is only matter and its processes - a description of causal dynamism. Whereas traditionally it indicated a purposeful, intelli- gent dynamism, the nature of «explanation» is transformed by him. We may take Diderot as the exemplar of Max Weber's remark: «The cosmos of natural causality and the postulated cosmos of ethical, compensatory causality have stood in irreconcilable opposition. »53 It is not in Diderot's nature that one would look for, or find, a ground for moral value. Second, and consequently, Diderot, like Spinoza, regarded good and evil as « strictly human responses with no bearing on the mean- ing of the cosmos as a whole. »54 Nothing was more alien to his mind than anthropomorphic cosmic animism. One may selectively analo- gize between certain of his cosmological ideas and those of the Stoics or the Romantics, but analogy is not identity, and from similar con- ceptions of cosmic process different conclusions are drawn. The reverberations of Diderot's way of thinking are not to be found pri- marily among the Romantics, with their metaphysical idealism and religiosity, but rather among the positivists, among many twentieth- century cosmological speculators, among ethical philosophers of the void and the absurd, from Nietzsche on, and among hmanists who find man's value creativity justified by his own existence, and see it as his own construction in an alien universe.

He picked up all the the rebellious threads in Enlightenment thought, wove them together and added his own malignancy to create an explosive charge with undiminishing reverbarations. «Dans la pen- see du siecle, le seul courant t6nu qui preserve, dans une certaine mesure, la vision sombre et sans illusion que Bayle se faisait de la nature, passe par La Mettrie pour aboutir au marquis de Sade. Bayle avait represent^ la nature comme une source 6pouvantable de d6sor- dres... la prosopopee que Sade prete &amp; la nature dans Justine r£pond exactement aux discours que Bayle lui faisait tenir dans la Continua- tion des Penstes diverses.»56 For Bayle and Sade, as for Diderot, there are in nature only indifferent events, and the weak are always « wrong ». I hope to have shown that the traditional generalizations so often used to characterize a supposititious monolithic Enlightenment have only a limited validity. The purpose of Sir Isaiah Berlin's essay is precisely to emphasize those limits, which he finds in a « counter- Enlightenment » exemplified in Vico, in «the ambivalent Montes- quieu, » Herder and some German pietists. Berlin accepts De Mais- tre's picture of the Enlightenment (p. 21). However, contrary to what de Maistre and Berlin both aver, some important eighteenth- century thinkers did know that « history and zoology are the most reliable guides to nature: they show her to be a field of unceasing slaughter. » And it was not only the Germans who realized that 53 They include M6h6gan, Thomas Morgan, Radicati di Passerano, Saint- Hyacinthe, Benoit de Maillet, d'Argens, Morelly, Robinet, Linguet, perhaps even Fontenelle. The position of Montesquier is not entirely clear. Robert Shackleton, in his authoritative discussion, point out that he goes from «is» to « ought »; the ought is a human development and does not exist as such in nature, in which there are necessary conditions for survival that are transformed in human society. (R. Shack- leton, Montesquieu [Oxford, 1961], pp. 247-61). Nevertheless, Montesquieu's liken- ing of moral law to geometric law as abstract verities (e.g., before a circle was even drawn or conceived, the radii were equal), point up the difference between him and Diderot. J. Roger suggests (in a personal communication) that the picture of a value-free universe, which foreshadows Malthus and Darwin, is also to be found in Linnaeus's Politia Naturae (1760) and Nemesis divina (posthumous), and in Lamarck's Recherches sur les causes des principaux f aits physiques (1794, written c. 1775). 56 R&amp;at, pp. 471-72. 71</page><page sequence="28">LESTER G. CROCKER moral freedom entails « resistance to nature and not harmonious col- lusion with her» (p. 16). The ideas implicated under the label « counter-Enlightenment » (setting aside the German pietists) were, in fact, part and parcel of the Enlightenment and can only be exclud- ed by a fallacious definitional approach, the kind used by Cobban and Gay as an arbitrary, inconsistent method of exclusion. Similarly, Gillispie's conclusion, «the noble eighteenth-century faith in natural law involved a fundamental confusion between the declarative and the normative cases of law, between 'is' and 'ought' » (p. 153) can only mean that the philosophes took their «ought» and read it as nature's law. The evidence I have presented shows that they did not always do this, or that they did it in a special sense not implied in the indiscriminate use of the word «nature.» There is no doubt that the widely received generalizations I have impugned are not devoid of truth; but they are unacceptable as over- all or categorical descriptions of Enlightenment thought. Their validity is severely limited; in some instances, they are invalid. It is certain that eighteenth-century thinkers, in their revolt against the Christian scheme and the alienation offered by Pascal, sought a rela- tion to nature. It was felt by many that the orderliness and rational- ity of the physical world could have an application to society and to individual life as well, at least to special problems. But others saw nature, as we experience it, as disorderly and irrational, and as different in essential ways from human nature. Where human nature resembles it is in our non-moral (or immoral) proclivities. It is cer- tain, too, that it was widely feared that without a universal law, a referrent, human law can only be arbitrary convention or something that each will ljudge for himself. Nevertheless, the doubts and denials were very much alive and persistent. It is again unacceptable to assimilate the Enlightenment view of nature to that of the Romantics - which itself, it should be noted, was in fact no more monolithic than the Enlightenment view that is proposed to us. Lamartine, Musset and Vigny represent different outlooks; that of Vigny, with his indifferent God and inhumane nature, prolongs the theme I have been developing. According to Morse Peckham, Romanticism is «the revolution in the European mind against thinking in terms of static mechanism and the redirec- 72</page><page sequence="29">THE IDEA OF A «NEUTRAL» UNIVERSE tion of the mind to thinking in terms of dynamic organism. »37 But one could say as much of Gassendi and of La Mettrie, neither of whom could be said to have thought like a « romantic. » Lamartine wrote: Mais la nature est la qui t'invite et qui t'aime; Plonge-toi dans son sein qu'elle t'ouvre toujours. (Le Vallori) O lac! rochers muets! grottes! foret obscure! Vous que le temps Spargne ou qu'il peut rajeunir, Gardez de cette nuit, gardez, belle nature, Au moins le souvenir . (Le Lac) But Diderot had written: «Le premier serment que se firent deux etres de chair, ce fut au pied d'un rocher qui tombait en poussie- re.»58 The Romantic « correspondences and sympathies» between cosmos or nature and the human are nowhere to be found in Dide- rot, who also wrote: «Le calcul qui se fait dans nos tetes, et celui qui est arrete sur le registre d'en haut, sont deux calculs bien diff6- rents.»59 Lamartine's lines belong to the cultural context of the 1820's. They could not have been written in the 1770's, and they were not, nor anything like them. The men of that time sometimes considered the power of nature abstractly, sometimes admired its beauties, and occasionally fused emotionally with it. They did not invent the pathetic fallacy. As we have seen throughout this discussion, many of the impor- tant thinkers in the Enlightenment found none of our values, and no ground for them, in God or cosmos, and none in nature taken as Nature. They took the desire for a rational world corresponding to our mind's rationality to be an illusion, excepting only physical laws. The irrational is natural. Diderot summarized the whole metaphysi- cal message of his novel, Jacques lefataliste, in five words: «Nous 57 Quoted from S.A. Zabouni, «Towards a Theory of Romanticism, » in «Rousseau and Romanticism, » Forum 16 (1978), 80. 58 Jacques le fataliste, in CEuvres romanesques, ed. Henri Benac (Paris, 1962), p. 604. Cf. Balzac: «... la profonde tristesse exprim£e par cette nature a la fois sauvage et ruinee...repondait a ses sentiments cache's... Quelle personne...dont le cceur a regu des blessures, peut se promener dans une foret sans que la foret lui parle? Insensiblement, il s'en eleve une voix ou consolante ou terrible, mais plus souvent consolante que terrible» (Le Cure* de village [Paris: Garnier], pp. 186-87). 59 Jacques le fataliste, p. 504. 73</page><page sequence="30">LESTER G. CROCKER marchons dans la nuit» (p. 573). And he added: «On ne sait jamais ce que le del veut ou ne veut pas, et il n'en sait peut-etre rien lui- meme» (p. 586). To say simply that the eighteenth century « looked to nature » for moral values is to fall into the same type of semantic error with which Carl Becker's Heavenly City is riddled. A radical change in the idea of nature was widespread. Nature was no longer associated by advanced thinkers with God or Creation or providence. It is just «what is,» and what is is everything. While values may have been called « natural, » they were not in nature in the same old way - a priori, self-subsistent - but empirically developed in the unique human experience. The objective or neutral law of nature is formu- lated unequivocally by Diderot: «tout dans la nature songe k soi et ne songe qu'i soi. Que cela fasse du mal aux autres, qu'importe, pourvu qu'on s'en trouve bien?))60 But if everything is natural, the distinction between right and wrong disappears - unless one trans- cends nature. If nature will answer Yes and No to any moral ques- tion (e.g., the legitimacy of suicide), then morality is a defence against nature's indifference. The philosophes we have discussed knew these two facts. Their weakness was not to have given any accurate description of what « human nature » is or of the elements that constitute its universality. But all knew that so-called «moral laws» do not have the necessity or compelling force of other natural laws; that they are variable in time and place, disregarded with impunity; and that the drives or impulses which it is their function to contain are more properly called the laws of nature. They knew that if moral values were inscribed in natural process itself, they would have a different kind of validity and authority. The distinctiveness and relative freedom of man: this was surely one of the great conquests of Enlightenment humanism, one which 60 Ibid., p. 756. Diderot's dilemma (nature-morals) is dramatically exhibited in the Neveu de Rameau. See Robert Niklaus, «Denis Diderot: Search for an Unat- tainable absolute of Truth, » in Ultimate Reality and Meaning, 3 (1980), p. 36. Hume had said no differently: «for as it is evident that every man loves himself bet- ter than any other person, he is naturally impelled to extend his requisitions as much as possible... His original inclination » is checked by «a subsequent judgment or observation » («On the Original Contract »). This complex of ideas was widespread; see Crocker, An Age of Crisis ', chapters 10, 11. 74</page><page sequence="31">THE IDEA OF A «NEUTRAL» UNIVERSE coexisted with its determinism. A great paradox is involved. A proc- ess without meaning has produced a being who creates meaning and lives by meaning. It followed, as A.C. Kors has put it, that «The universe was uncaring and amoral; in the midst of its flux man must make his own way» (p. 77). Another paradox: it was precisely the awareness of the «distinctiveness between ourselves and other parti- cles that tumble in space»61 that enabled these philosophes to defend the validity of moral obligation. In human societies the universal law of living nature - survival - is radically transformed and sublimat- ed. New ways of being in the world give a value to power for its own sake, to prestige, to pleasure in multiform shapes, to motives con- forming to objectification in a self-image, to happiness - just to mention some of the existential phenomena which compose a crucial difference between man and nature-in-the-large, and an equally cru- cial difference between saying that man looked to Nature for a sup- port for moral value and saying that there is none outside of man himself, man the only valuating being, set in a Nature that is indifferent, but really unfriendly to his wishes in vital ways. As Paul Valery later wrote, «It is the glory of man to waste his powers on the void.» In all this we see that the underlying crisis of Western thought, coming to a head in the eighteenth century, was the liberation of man from the prison of subjectivism, to which the generalizations and definitions I am contesting in this essay would precisely confine him: a meaning in the whole, a purpose and direction, a subsisting harmony, an answer «out there » to us humans. To say that man is the sole end-creating entity, the sole judging entity, was revolution- ary, liberating, and dangerous.62 Far from being all of a piece, the Age of Enlightenment was beset with perplexities. It was not a period that with light heart and super- ficial mind accepted the generalities we have seen attributed to it. 61 Alexander Bickel, The Morality of Consent (New Haven, London, 1978), p. 5. 62 Diderot's reticence about disclosing his secret perceptions may be explained on several grounds. I suspect that his highly intuitive mind cognized the ironic peri- peteia they contained. Rationalized as the solvent of an archaic world-view, the death of meaning (or its reduction to human contrivance) also held the seeds of the death of the whole «bourgeois» culture, ethical, aesthetic and political, to which he was so pro fondly committed. 75</page><page sequence="32">LESTER G. CROCKER Just as modern liberal democracy has its roots in eighteenth-century political theories, so does modern totalitarian democracy (so-called). Just as utilitarian ethics was born then, too was the countercurrent of moral nihilism and individual rebellion. Similarly, even as the uni- verse and nature were seen as orderly, purposeful and benevolent to man, as the ground that validated the harsh claims of the moral life, so did disenchanted thinkers see man as alien, as the creator of value in the void of a value-free world.
