<plain_text><page sequence="1">A POTTERY HEAD FROM VERA CRUZ , MEX/CO Much attention has been given to the spectacular cultures of the Aztecs and the Maya. Other cultures, contemporary or even earlier, have only lately received the notice commensurate with their artistic quality, their aesthetic value, or their historical significance. The very names of these cultures are poetic and evocative: Tarascan, Zapotee, Huastec, Totonac, Olmec, and Mixtee. Lying, as they did, across Mexico from sea to sea and up and down the east coast in Vera Cruz, these cultures show features of their own while sometimes transmitting or employing traits of the neighboring Aztec (and antecedent Toltec) and Maya cultures. In time it may be clear just what role these people played in the story POTTERY HEAD from the State of Vera Cruz, Mexico Totonac or Olmec, about 6th-7th century A.D. Gift of Mrs. Lillian Henkel Haass, 7955 6</page><page sequence="2">of Middle American history, whether as independent creators or as middlemen between other cultures. The chronological relations of these cultures are as yet by no means clear. The great day of the Maya had passed when the Spaniards came in the sixteenth century, and the invaders soon put an end to the cultural strength of the Aztecs. Other cultures were already defunct, awaiting present-day ethnologists, philolo- gists, and archaeologists to study the surviving peoples, their linguistic relation- ships, and the existing remains, above or below ground. It would appear that in Mexico and southward to the Isthmus of Panama, ceramic sculpture, that is modeled and moulded masks and figures in baked clay, preceded the great stone sculpture that is better preserved and generally better known. There seems no evidence that sculpture in wood preceded ceramic sculpture or taught the artist the methods and style used in stone sculpture, as can be shown to have been the case in Egypt and Greece. Enigmatic and impressive are two words evoked by this terra-cotta head, almost a mask, which has recently come to the collection of the Detroit Institute of Arts as a gift from Mrs. Lillian Henkel Haass, long an appreciative connoisseur of aboriginal American art, and many times a donor to the collections of ancient American and European art in the Institute. Little is known about the head, nothing of its history, nothing of the artist who made it, nothing of the true purpose for which it was intended, yet for all its anonymity it exists as a work of creative art, a masterful handling of its medium, and a moving portrayal that arouses ideas in the mind of the present-day beholder. The head is said to come from Vera Cruz, the modern Mexican state which lies along the Gulf Coast, rising from the shore to the highlands. Through this state Hernando Cortes and his Spanish conquistadors made their way in 1519, seeking the reported wealth of the Aztec king in the Valley of Mexico on its lofty plateau. As they passed, they may have seen the remains of cultures already ancient and decayed, pieces like the present terra cotta head, which appears to have been part of a complete figure, whether standing or seated cannot be determined, or part of an elaborate anthropomorphic vase, such as is most char- acteristic of the Zapotee regions of southwestern Mexico. Is this head a remnant of the Totonac culture of central Vera Cruz, celebrated for its stone carvings of palmate objects, yokes, and narrow masks, and for terra- cotta heads or masks of what appear to be smiling young people with slanting eyes that suggest Chinese types? Or is it the product of the mysterious Olmec people of southern Vera Cruz, ancient and almost forgotten? It is probable that it was already about 1000 years old when the Spaniards came. It has been dated in the sixth and seventh centuries. The head is broken off at the neck; the elaborate ear-plugs are only partially preserved, the nose and lower lip are missing; but much that is characteristic and unusual remains: the broad flat face (the head is actually flattened from front to back), the almond-shaped eyes (once probably enhanced in realism by painted pupils), and the bristling coiffure or headdress, made up of numerous 7</page><page sequence="3">barbs of clay. At the back of the head is a small square opening (about 1 Vi inches on a side) which presumably was intended to prevent the explosion of the hollow ceramic sculpture when it was fired. There is, however, the added possibility that incense or smoke was introduced through this opening to pour out of the open mouth of the face with dramatic effect. Were the piece complete, it might indeed have the appearance of a dead person with staring eyes and open mouth. This would not be out of keeping with many of the cult ideas of the ancient peoples of Middle America. Among the Aztecs to the west of Vera Cruz and the Maya to the south and east, the God of Death had a prominent place in the pantheon. FRANCIS W. ROBINSON Acc. no. 55.182. Height 7 Ys inches.
