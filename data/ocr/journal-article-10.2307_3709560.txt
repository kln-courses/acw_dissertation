As Heraclitus observed many years ago "all things are in a state of flux," for both mankind and all nature seem to be end- lessly passing from one stage or condition to another. As is well known, people on the less sophisticated levels of culture almost invariably mark every transition in human life by a rite or ceremony. Over fifty years ago van Gennep attempted in his Les rites de passage to give a systematic analysis of the cere- monies accompanying an individual's "life crises." Although he calculated that one and the same rite could be classified in six? teen different ways, he claimed that when all the activities that accompany these ceremonies are examined as to order and con? tent they can be divided into three major phases: separation, transition, and incorporation. Much of van Gennep's book is given over to the defense of this scheme. Thus he considers puberty rites to be mainly rites of separation from an asexual world which are then followed by rites of incorporation into a sexual world. There can be no doubt that van Gennep's scheme is of some help in clarifying and systematizing the mass of data in this area of human activity that had accumulated already in his time. It is also interesting to look back at the concept of "re? ciprocity" in ritual exchanges that he correctly analyzed and to see how later, both the Malinowski as well as the Radcliffe- Brown (functionalist) schools of social anthropology, developed this idea much further. Learning theory, deviancy, theories of change, and of course, symbolism, and many other matters of psycho-sociological interest in the behavioral sciences today were anticipated by van Gennep. The influence of Comte and the positivistic intellectual cli- mate in which he wrote and also the then still current evolution- istic theories have done much the mar the work of van Gennep. Many anthropologitys of his time (among them Andrew Lang and Wilhelm Schmidt) attacked his conf used ideas with regard to religion and magic. He divided religion into the dynamic and the animistic: By dynamism is to be understood the impersonal theory of mana; by animism, the personalistic theory, whether the power personified be a single or a multiple being, ani? mal or plant (e.g. a totem), anthropomorphic or amor- phous (e.g. God). These theories constitute religion, whose techniques (ceremonies, rites, services) I call</page><page sequence="2">364 THE american catholic sociological review magic. Since the practice and the theory are inseparable ?the theory without the practice becoming metaphysics, and the practice on the basis of a different theory becom? ing science?the term I will at all times use is the adjec- tive magico-religious. (p. 13). Animism comes in four varieties, magic in six. Even van Gennep himself gets all confused when he attempts to apply this classification to the examples he discusses. He was correct in assessing many rites as translating the initiates from a pro- fane to a sacred state. By the same token, however, he failed to recognize that some rites of passage are not religious at all. As Andrew Lang pointed out (Anthropos IV 1910 p. 825) "many persons in modern society, even persons wholly destitute of religion, invent rites by themselves." Many people concoct and regularly repeat all kinds of strange things "just for luck," who would be at an utter loss to explain why they thought them lucky. They surely would not call these rites "dynamist, contagious, and indirect," as van Gennep does. The secularization of modern urban society gives evidence of a great decline in sacred ceremonialism. Since the need for some observable ritualization of a human being's transition from one status to another has not lessened, man being the symbolizing agent that he is, man's ritual behavior and its con? sequence for life-cycle crises in a modern setting would be an excellent field of research. Despite its many deficinecies, perhaps the English translation of van Gennep's classic Les rites de pas? sage might perhaps stir up some scientific interest in this mat? ter among the social scientists. If it does, the book will have served a good purpose. Sylvester A. Sieber, S.V.D. Loyola University, Chicago 11, IU.</page></plain_text>
