There once were two cats of Kilkenny, Each thought there was one cat too many; So they fought and they fit, And they scratched and they bit, Till, excepting their nails And the tips of their tails, Instead of two cats, there weren't any. (Author Unknown) from Book of Humorous Verse, Garden City Publ., 1947. To be meaningful, knowledge must somehow relate to the "human predicament." It has often been said that one of the chief aims of biology is to help people "know themselves." In our comparative studies of structure and function, we come to a better understanding of man's needs and capa- bilities. In knowing something of the complex interactions of living things in the world, we see more clearly our own interrelationships and our dependency on the natural environment. In this well-written and fascinating book, it is Ardrey's thesis that we have for too long neglected to use the rapidly accumulating knowledge of animal be- havior in a comparative study of human nature. In a day when man's behavior will determine whether or not life persists upon the earth, we can no longer afford the luxury of this neglect. In the realms of morphology and physiology, biologists have never been reluctant to draw anal- ogies between man and other animals - a kind of "zoomorphism" of human structure and function. When it comes to behavior, however, quite the opposite is true. We have tended to interpret ani- mal behavior in terms of our own. Only in recent decades have we eliminated anthropomorphism from the study of animal behavior. It is due, per- haps, to the unhappy history of this anthropo- morphic emphasis, that ethologists have been re- luctant to apply their findings to the study of human behavior. Not inhibited by any such cau- tion, Ardrey treads boldly into this terra incognita. As the subtitle indicates, this is a popularly written and, to use the words of the author, "a personal investigation into the contemporary, little- known accomplishments of the natural sciences, and a personal interpretation of what these revolution- ary studies may bring to our knowledge of man. . . .It brings into focus a single aspect of human behavior which I believe to be characteristic of our species as a whole, to be shaped but not de- termined by environment and experience, and to be a consequence not of human choice but of evo- lutionary inheritance" (p. ix). It is Ardrey's conviction that man's behavior has its roots in the evolutionary past just as surely as does his anatomical make-up. He develops the dis- tinction between "closed" and "open" instincts in order to build a case for an inherited basis for human behavior, especially as this relates to ter- ritoriality. He sees territoriality as an "imperative"</page><page sequence="2">576 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY [VOLUME 42 in the sense that it is an inherited instinct. It is refreshing to see the word "instinct" applied to the human species, after so many doubts voiced by psychologists and others over the years. Many students of animal behavior believe that there is a foundation of instinctive patterns underlying human actions which greatly influence the cul- tural and social structure built upon it. Ardrey, a well-known playwright, turns many a fine phrase in this book. His early anthropological background -an interest rekindled in the 1950's and which resulted in his writing African Genesis - is an important influence in his writing. Some will find his easy extrapolation from flatworms and crickets to subhuman primates and man a little too much, but the logic of his reasoning is sound and his conclusions are couched in tentative terms. The book is dedicated to Eliot Howard, whose Territory in Bird Life, published in 1920, is, ac- cording to Ardrey, the only other book devoted solely to territoriality. Ardrey lists 245 references, mostly in the area of ethology and anthropology. He deals with territory as exhibited in arena be- havior, pair-bonding, and migration to and from "home" territories. He discusses at length the "society of inward antagonisms" (borrowing the term "noyau" of Petter), in comparison to the so- eiety of outward antagonisms, which he terms the "biological nation." It is in this section of the book that he is most provocative, if not contro- versial. The fact that he can find among Euro- pean nationalities human examples of both the noyau (Italy) and the nation (England) detracts somewhat from his thesis that human territorial behavior is at its roots instinctive. A most interesting idea is what he calls the "amity-enmity complex," the development of which is used as the occasion to spoof the tendency of some to reduce everything to mathematical equa- tions - in this case, A = E + h. As hazard (h) in- creases, our enmity (E) against the "enemy" need not be great to produce a certain level of intra- group amity (A). But as (h) decreases there may be the need for a corresponding rise in (E) toward the outsider to maintain the existing level of in- group A. Just as animals forget their differences in the face of flood or fire, but experience a rise in enmity as hazard wane, so in human affairs our outward antagonisms may wax as the threat of famine, pestilence, and disease diminishes. Ardrey firmly believes that, as Lorenz has argued, behavior establishes channels within which natural selection operates to bring about structural and physiological changes. It is his hope that an understanding of the instinctual bases of our be- havior may lead to more intelligent responses to the challenges which human behavior presents, and ultimately to the beneficial control of behavior. Perhaps from the general adoption of behavior pat- terns which have survival value will come cultural adaptations which will ritualize, and hence render harmless, our aggressive tendencies. There is un- doubtedly much that we can learn from herring gulls, ring-tailed lemurs -and even planaria. JOHN A. GuSTAFSON SOCIAL BEHAVIOR IN ANIMALS, WITH SPECIAL REFER- ENCE TO VERTEBRATES. By N.
