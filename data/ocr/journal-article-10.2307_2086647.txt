<plain_text><page sequence="1">SCIENCE AS EXPERIENCE: A GENETIC AND COMPARATIVE REVIEW* PAUL MEDOWS University of Nebraska THIS paper is an attempt at a psycho- cultural description and interpretation of science as a social enterprise. It will explore some of the implications of the proposition that science is a type of human experience. It starts with the postulate that as experience science can and should be studied scientifically. The procedure which will be followed is simply the application of the conventional methods of science, those of definition, classification, and generaliza- tion, to the study of science as a social ex- perience. Science is one of a number of such experi- ences. As human action, it differs, of course, from such other human actions as religion, *Read before faculty seminar, University of Nebraska, March ~8, I949. esthetics, politics, and so forth. The differ- ences may be summarized in the following definition. Science may, for present purposes, be regarded (a) as a growing body of knowl- edge, (b) arrived at by conventionalized methods of observation, (c) according to an accepted series of operations, (d) which in- tend to describe, explain, and predict events, (e) through the discovery of regular and uni- form patterns of resemblance, succession, variation, and caustion in events, (f) which are regarded as ocurring in a perceptual world displaying apparent orderliness. If science is action of this sort, there is necessarily an actor, the scientist. He may be regarded as a knower, working with the knowable (the subject matter of science), performing operations called knowing (nam- ing, classifying, experimenting, measuring, verifying), and thus producing the known or</page><page sequence="2">SCIENCE AS EXPERIENCE 593 knowledge (specific and generalized state- ments about reality: the sciences as symbolic systems)? The scientists as actor, then, moves along a continuum of experiences which range from the deafly given to the ob- scurely given. His task is the organization of reality through conceptualized relations link- ing the dearly with the obscurely given.2 Scientific activity, therefore, is a culti- vated search for experience, and it is a cul- tivation of experience. Reality occurs to hu- man beings in the form of events. Every event or occurrence is at the same time a concurrence, a "hierarchy" of events.8 Science is a highly patterned mode of experiencing event-structured reality. It is both a cogni- tive and an instrumental mode. In both cases, however, it is an organized mode, and as such it is certain to reflect the prevailing culture. Like the criminal or the psycopath whom he studies, the scientist must and can only be understood "as a speci- men in a cultural series.TM Here, then, is one very important motivation for the increas- ingly popular study of the social psychology of science, usually called the sociology of knowledge.5 The purpose of this paper is to follow out the lines of inquiry which start with the postulate of science as a type of organized experience. Four assertions will be made and examined: (a) science is a learned, trans- mitted behavior: science as culture; (b) sci- ence is a growing and changing enterprise: science as history; (c) science as experience is organized and mediated through habits: science as methodology; and (d) science as Cf.

Appleton-Century, x94o pp. 64ff: tested and organized experience is character- ized by relatively integrated symbolic sys- tems: science as rationale or organon. II "Adjustment" has become a strategic word in modem science, a major motif at least in the various life sciences, such as biology, ecology, psychology, and sociology. It refers to a continuum of experiences which extend from the passive extreme of acquiescence with, through conflict and hostility toward, to the positive extreme of control over real- ity. At the human level, thought in its vari- ous expressions and its various physiological levels is regarded as a process of organic ad- justment.? Science as a cognitive and instru- mental enterprise, then, may be thought of as having a biological significance? An evolutionary and cultural emergent, science at the prehistoric level was naturally enough quite rudimentary and specific, oc- curring in the folk and gestural arts of social living and, somewhat later, in mythology and ritual. Achieving mediation by symbols, it became, like all symbolic behavior, a part of the cultural process' it became, slowly and awkwardly, communicated and transmitted experience, a part and product of interactive living.8 Science apparently had it origins and its growth as an adaptive and interactive be- havior. Long ago William Graham Sumner called attention to its probable origin "in situations that demanded action to escape ex- tinction? It very likely began as magic. A world of hazards prompts a search for secu- rity, and magic was an early road? Magic, which seeks to coerce the invisible powers, is 6 Cf.

Science as experi- ence is necessarily a critical selection of events and instruments. In consequence, it moves back and forth from contemplation to manipulation, establishing modalities, se- quences and correlations among attributes and variables. Active curiosity, which sets in motion the instrumental operations, and idle curiosity, which systematizes the con- ceptualized problems and products, are the hinges of the door of science which is forever swinging open and out.~*~ As an adjustive and interactive behavior, science became and continues to be an ac- cretive culture complex. Internally viewed, it is composed of technics of knowing (methods of research), technology (logic), and techniques (art). The scientific man of knowledge is simultaneously a technician and a technologist: he is a craftsman with tools which he inherited and improves and in the use of which he must become skilled; and he is a systematizer, symbolizing and integrating his observation into a formal body of knowledge. Externally viewed, the culture complex of science is a social activity with selected personnel, social and behavior organization, habits of action and interest, cumulative patterns of equipment and sym- bols, and rationale or organon which justifies, motivates, and explains the activity.~8 Con- n Writes J. D. Bernal: Science "derives from the ordered speculations of the magician, priest, or philosopher, and from the practical operation and traditional lore of the craftsman."

Thorstein Veblen, The Place of Science in Modern Civilization, New York: B. W. Huebsch,. x9x9. Like religion, magic, mythology, or art, or any sidered, thus, as a variable, structured and changing enterprise, science in its character as a culture complex might easily become-- at least more so than it has--the subject- matter of such disciplines as history, anthro- pology, or sociology.x4 III It has been suggested that the scientific mode of observation and speculation becomes organized and expressed as a culture complex which is learned, varied and transmitted. This being the case, it is important to see how this particular complex not only reflects the prevailing culture of a given time and place but also how it changes through time. Two major propositions are asserted' that the culture complex of science arises and grows through the interaction of certain internal and external factors, and that in time there emerge great cultural traditions in science which serve as time-binding and selective forces in its interests and develop- ment. Internally, the variation and growth of science mirror the variations and growth of the philosophy and technology of a people. Science as a cultural process is linked to a set of social conditions which emancipate and motivate scientific activity. This fact is most clearly seen in the case of Western Civiliza- tion. The emergence and maturity of Greek thought, for example, had its social origins in the manner in which Greek culture pro- vided satisfactory collective arrangements' an expansive economic culture, the lack of a priesthood with political authority, and a cultural ethos which prized intellectual pur- suits. For them philosophical problems were "formulations of complications existing in the material of collective experience."x5 That collective experience was individually free, "exposed to change, and subjected to at- other human activity, science tends to develop its own self-corroborative fictions, a tender/cy which few scientists have cared to examine. ~' Cf. the suggestive article by J. B.

It therefore presented "in typical form the basic diffi- culties with which human thought has to reckon." Social change and conflict were mir- rored in the now familiar antitheses: stability vs. change, harmony vs. hostility, reason rs. force, experience vs. tradition, and so on. Historically, the Greek experience has been repeated in a variety of national contexts. Changes in philosophy, and therefore in science, have been "inherently bound up with problems that arise when new emphases and new redistributions in the significance of values take place.TM Like philosophy, science is particularly active "in periods of marked social change .... "For this reason, it is both inevitable and desirable that philos- ophy should be "the matrix within which the conceptions that have given direction in both the physical and human fields" are conceived and nourished? Technologically, the variations and growth of science seem to be linked to certain predisposing economic factors, such as the presence of an economic surplus, a social division of labor, and certain collective ar- rangements. Currently we are familiar with this fact from the manner in which private corporations, both commercial and academic, as well as government, organize and subsidize research in our own society. It has been no less true in earlier periods of western civiliza- tion. For example, the Royal Scientific Society of England was founded by the merchants of London.~s The social and eco- nomic demand for useful inventions was facilitated not only by organizations of capital but also by the trained activity of technicians and craftsmen?

The second proposition which seems to be relevant here refers to the emergence and significance of great cultural traditions in the growth and development of science as a cultural complex. A cultural tradition--its process of formation and formulation need not detain us at this point2?--becomes for a people an "acceptance frame," or "frame of reference."2x Each acceptance frame "en- rolls for 'action' in accordance with its par- ticular way of drawing lines .... Out of such we derive our vocabularies .... " The Comtean positivist tradition, itself a powerful acceptance frame in modern sci- ence, has made us familiar with the dialec- tical pattern of theological, metaphysical and scientific (or positive) stages of develop- ment.2~' The social psychology of this histori- cal dialectic, though perhaps not the dia- lectic itself, has been widely accepted among pragmatists and instrumentalists, indeed among most critical realists. Thought, it is held, originates in things used, felt, and enjoyed. The increase in human interests and skills brings a progressive extension of the realm of the given to include more and more remote and obscurely given objects and demonstrates the impossibility of exploring the obscure by anthropomorphic or analogic methods. The test of truth becomes the suc- cessive approximation of reality, the positi- vistic test. But, as Benjamin has observed, when a science has achieved this stage, "it has not reached maturity; on the contrary, it is only beginning to be a science.TM He ~0 Cf. Max Radin, "Tradition," Encydopoedia of the Social $dences, XV, pp. 62ff. The role of "tradi- tions" in science has not been adequately studied.

The empirical data may be found in the numerous works on the history of science and of philosophy. '~Kenneth Burke, Attitudes toward History, New York: New Republic, Inc., z927, I, p. x2o.

Presumably a science is mature when it reaches the last stage. However valid this thesis may prove to be, the indispensable fact is that the most im- portant tradition in modern science is positi- vism. This particular acceptance frame holds that the scientific symbol (s) is a function (f) of the data (D) and/or the operation (o). Unlike rationalism which argues that S = f(o), positivism, in the empirical man- ner, holds either that S--f(D) or that S = f(D, 0).24 Most of the philosophies of modern science seem to be variations of this theme. This emphasis on the role of cultural tradi- tions in the culture complex called science is likely to be distasteful to scientists who as- sume that they have no philosophical as- sumptions. Without belaboring this point, one might simply cite some of the most im- portant philosophic shifts in science in the last century' from materialism to dynamism, from determinism to indeterminism, from the universe-as-a-great-machine to the uni- verse-as-a-great-thought, from the part-to- whole relationship to the whole-to-part re- lationship problem. These shifts take place slowly. Indeed, the conceptual systems of a period seem to change more slowly than do its observational systems. As a matter of fact, perhaps the most disastrous culture lag in a society is the lag occurring between its observational and conceptual orders. A kind of social heredity fixes conceptual systems, creating for them a stubborn dominance.~-5 Methodologically, these invasions and suc- ~'A. C.

SBWhitehead has called attention to the im- munity of great cultural traditions in science in his brilliant treatment of the evolution of natural law concepts: the doctrinal succession of Imposed Na- tural Law, Natural Law as Immanent in Nature, Natural Law as Observed Order of Succession or Concomitance, or as Mere Description. Cf. A. N. Whitehead, The Adventure o] Ideas, New York: Macmillan Co., I933. cessions in the conceptual realm point to the necessity of a planned reduction by scien- tists of ideological tensions in their own fields. Modern science is still handicapped by a metaphysical fallacy that it has no metaphysics, just as it is hampered by the cultural fallacy that science is sui generis. IV Science as a particular type of experience consists, in part at least, of knowing through observing. As a learned behavior, therefore, it is basically comprised of observational skills. The latter may be classified into two groups, technic-skills and symbol-skills. In a sense, mastery of them is at least one index of scientific ability. Together, they form what is usually called the methodology of science. Superficially, the status of methodology in science appears highly confused.2? The usual discussions of methodology stress such obvi- ous elements as general principles derived or derivable from empirical studies, from studies of the psychological processes, from historical accounts of outstanding scientific developments, or from handbook guides on research. Most of these considerations posit the duality of observation and theory.2' More useful is the treatment which starts from the theory of observation, or from the role of theory in observation. This thesis requires, first of all, that tech- nic-skills always be suborbinated to and adapted to the service of symbol-skills. For example, statistical or laboratory routines alike receive whatever significance they have from symbolically-derived problems. Facts occur in science in a setting of theory; in mature science they always so occur. It is true, of course, that the historic advancement of a science tends primarily to be a function of its technic-skills, secondarily of its sym- bol-skills.~s Unfortunately, immature sci- ~e cf. R.

Such demands mis- read the history of science. The nature of the data, the nature of the situational limita- tions on observation of data in any given field, and especially the nature of the analyti- cal problem historically determine the nature and development of the technical and sym- bolic skills of a given science. Analogical fixations make pseudo-sciences. The source of the confusion over methodo- logy lies in the symbol-skills of the scientists. A traditional logic, formulated by the classic Greeks, has always sought to organize the already known or supposedly known. Its appeal to sense perception in this logic has always been in pursuit of particulars; its search of rational perception has been for universals; the good office of logic was to put the two "givens" together.8? Rationalism, as the modern inheritor of this ancient habit of learning, perpetuated this preoccupation with conceptual contructions and dialectic manipulations. Its supreme embodiment is in mathematics. Empiricism, appearing with the new social and economic movements of the rising nation-state and industrialism, radi- cally appealed to experience, or observation, usually at the expense of theory; and in so doing it proclaimed the supremacy of induction over deduction. The failure to see the deductive character of all induction, the extent of symbolization in all "fact," the concept in the datum, has been all the more tragic when the needs which lie behind the contemporary cry for integration and syn- thesis are considered. Just as there can be no body of scientific fact without conceptuali- zation, there can be no system of science without theory: concepts organize percepts, just as theory organizes science.8~ And just as the symbol selects and analyzes experi- 29For example, cf.

Herbert Blumer, "Science without Con- cepts," American Journal of Sociology, 37 (I93I), 5zSff. ence, so likewise theory provides a basis for its coherent organization.s2 The symbol-skills of science are cus- tomarily divided into those of description and explanation, the latter being later and more mature than the former. Symbol-skills at the descriptive level represent events in their most clearly given aspects, classify them, seriate and correlate them. Descriptive symbol-skills yield up not universals but "enumerative generalizations.TM They are at best loosely integrated or non-explanatory' they tend to form aggregates, not systems of knowledge; propositions follow one another but not from one another, and meanings are illustrative, not postulational. Explanatory symbol-skills either proceed from empirical propositions descriptively de- veloped or from hypothetical propositions which may refer backward or forward to empirical data. The search is for the system- atic interconnections of experience, and the accent is on the relations of fact, not the facts themselves, and on the logically neces- sary or invariant relations of facts.34 The symbol-skills of explanatory science establish the relations of co-implication, co-variance, and causation.35 Technic-skills of explana- tory science are those of hypothetico-deduc- tion (implication), whereas in the case of descriptive science they tend to be those of observed uniformity (resemblance, co-exis- tence, succession). The methodology of science, then, consists of interbehavioral--that is, communicated-- skills. It is in this sense, therefore, that one may hold that the "logic" and "methodology" of science are co-terminous. If logic be defined as "a series of organizational operations," there can be no difference between "the practical organization of objects and the most technical or abstract logical proce- dures.TM From this point of view, one can 8: Cf.

Unhappily, the persistence of this disjunc- tion accounts for the widespread pack-rat activities of scientific "collectionalists," on the one hand, and the closed system con- agery that 'locates' the various aspects of experience."~7 There appear to be two levels of systema- tization' aggregational and functional. Ag- gregational systems are descriptive, open, and relational. Functional systems are ex- planatory, closed, and interrelational.

Science as a logicizing operation inevit- ably tends toward system-building: to know is to systematize; to systematize is to pre- dict; to predict is to control. Knowing requires relating: all facts are sensed and conceived in a relationship with other facts; they are, in other words, "known" only through relations. Statements about reality--that is, "facts"--are relational expressions. To systematize is to extend this organizational behavior, which starts with the simplest approximations of reality. The word "system," according to Webster, de- rives in part from the French: syn, "with," and histanai, "to place"' to systematize is "to place together." Psychologically, sys- tematization seems to be a response to an emotional need for "symbolic tinkering," as Burke has styled it: the need for "a ra- tionale of imaginative and conceptual im- first brings together-"places together"-- relevant facts; the second, facts with vary- ing amounts of dependence on one another. Both types of systems are found in the sciences. Of the two, the functional, explanatory, and interrelational system represents the ul- timate ideal of science. For it embodies "a set of propositions arranged in a hierarchy, the lowest level of the hierarchy being con- cerned with particular facts, and the highest with some general law governing everything in the universe.TM An upward connection between the propositions is established by induction, a downward connection by deduc- tion. 'Systematization, therefore, represents a process of hierarchization. At the purely descriptive level, this activity requires ar- ranging data in classes and series; at the explanatory level, it means arranging them additively and, following Levine and Dorn- s, Kenneth Burke, op. cit., II, p. z. u Bertrand Russell, The Scientific Outlook, New York: W.

Historically, descriptive sys- tematization has come first in most if not all sciences, and unhappily some sciences have not yet achieved even this stage. Science apparently requires a process of maturation and socialization, the accumulation of a culture base, a tradition and spread of technic and symbol skills. Systematization must not be forced: but it is helpful to understand and anticipate that it is a func- tion of maturity. Analytically, the available systems of sci- ence appear, in diagram form, somewhat as shown on preceding page.</page></plain_text>
