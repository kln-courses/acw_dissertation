Geary Resume Les etudes anterieures sur l'art et le leadership dans le contexte africain ont ete dominees par l'approche fonctionaliste. Il en est resulte une vision sta- tique, donc necessairement a-historique, de l'art comme reflet et support du pouvoir. Cette contribution met plutot l'accent sur une analyse dynamique qui prend racine dans l'histoire pour saisir les rapports entre l'art et la poli- tique. Son objectif est de comprendre comment l'art contribue au processus historique des flux et reflux des institutions politiques. L'art y est analyse comme un language visuel capable de mouler et d'influencer les principes sur lesquels reposent les institutions. Les royaumes de Bamum et de Bali-Nyonga fournissent deux exemples qui mettent en lumiere sa signification et son r61le. Introduction In art historical research on Africa, one of the most widely acknowledged phenomena is the intimate relationship of art forms and leadership in a wide variety of polities. The socio-political structure of these polities may range from kingdoms to acephelous societies. Political leaders act as patrons com- missioning art works, control their distribution and use, employ them in their political strategies, and endow them with meaning. In the following, I shall examine this relationship of art and the political sphere and in exten- sion of art and history in the kingdoms of Bamum and Bali-Nyonga located in the Northwest and Western Provinces of Cameroon. The first part of this article will be devoted to a brief discussion of the theoretical background from which the study of African art in the leadership context arose. It will be shown that most analyses to date have grown out of functionalist theory developed by anthropologists. How this implicit framework affected research on art and leadership in the Cameroon Grassfields, the region in which Bali-Nyonga and Bamum are located, will be discussed in the follow- ing paragraphs. I suggest that the influence of the functionalist paradigm on studies of art and politics in the Cameroon Grassfields has led to the creation of a standard formula applied to the political structure of the numerous poli- ties located in this area, no matter what their actual socio-political</page><page sequence="2">I2 CJAS / RCEA XXII:I 1988 configuration might have been or is now. This rigid framework has prohi- bited sophisticated analyses and has precluded any exciting insights into dia in relationship to the political sphere in the Cameroon Grassfields. In the case study part of this essay, I shall demonstrate how a shift in emphasis away from a static view of political structure to a model taking historical and political process into consideration greatly enhances an understanding of the role and impact that art works may have in the political domain. In African art history it is commonly assumed that works of art reflect the level of complexity of the political and spiritual leadership and that works of art in some ways are central to its success (Sieber and Walker 1987, 86). This interpretation of art forms as reflective and expressive of political structure has been widely acknowledged and applied in art historical schol- arship since the i96os when African art history became established as an independent field in the American academe. Until recently, however, the origin of this conceptual framework in which studies of art and leadership are set remained unarticulated. Now, art historians and anthropologists of art have begun to evaluate critically and assess the implicit assumptions on which this interpretation of art in the realm of politics has been based. In a recent overview paper on art research in Africa from a social science per- spective, Paula Ben-Amos points to the origins of this type of analysis in functionalism, the mainstream theory current in British and American social anthropology during the i95os and i96os. As a matter of fact, the functionalist paradigm determines the questions which are posed in regards to art and the political domain to this day. Functionalists perceive art as emanating from the system of social relations which it reflects. Articulating in aesthetic form the nature of the social experience, art works are also per- ceived as affecting the system as such, mainly in terms of its maintenance (Ben-Amos 1987, 44f.). This approach favors an ahistorical synchronic view, which not only characterizes most functionalist analyses but also perme- ates art historical research - because of African art historians' heavy reliance on this particular anthropological paradigm and the impossibility to date most art works (Kasfir 1984, 164; Vansina 1984, 33ff.). This style of scholarship on the relationship of art and the political domain is best represented in the seminal book African Art and Leadership, edited by Douglas Fraser and Herbert M. Cole in 1972, which has set the tone for many later works. Fraser and Cole present a methodology for the study of arts of leadership and suggest to isolate three dimensions of African art which should be explored systematically (1972, 299ff.). Beginning with an analysis of "structure" which they understand as material, form and design, as well as style and iconography, they then proceed to the "func- tion." Function here is seen in the broadest possible sense and includes an examination of the art objects' purposes and uses, as well as the reactions</page><page sequence="3">I3 Christraud M. Geary: Bali-Nyonga and Bamum and responses of the viewers of the art forms. Finally, in what seems the least defined of the three dimensions, Fraser and Cole advocate the explora- tion of the "history" of art forms, their development, and their interrelated- ness. Among the essays in the volume are several pathbreaking treatises. One of them, Rene Bravmann's discussion of the diffusion of Ashanti politi- cal art is of particular relevance for the issues raised in this present study on Bali-Nyonga and Bamum (Bravmann 1972). Bravmann, digressing from the notion that political structure is static and undergoes little change over time, offers an interesting analysis of art forms linked with the process of state formation and examines the role of art forms in the establishment of the Asante hegemony. According to his findings, the Asante court gave gifts and bestowed regalia, such as ornately cast stools and elaborately carved swords, onto leaders of groups that had come under its domination. These art objects served as an integrative device, for they represented an aesthetic charter of relationships between those dominating and those subjugated. Bravmann's essay provides an excellent starting point for a more dynamic treatment of the arts in the political domain, but unfortunately this approach and other ideas for future directions of work contained in Fraser and Cole's book have not been taken up by scholars in the way one might have expected. At first glance, it may seem outdated to once more refer to these issues, but the treatment they have received thus far certainly legitim- izes a renewed evaluation and interest. With few exceptions, little has been done to broaden and deepen understanding of the complex relationship of art and politics, that is, little going beyond the insight that in this relationship art reflects political structure and alludes to it. How this relationship mani- fests itself in specific situations, and how intricate the processes can be, remains often unexplored. Thus, we need to look at particular themes, such as the arts associated with specific modes of political action. We should look at the role of art forms in political processes and dynamics over time, their embeddedness in ideology. Today, such an undertaking can draw on a much better and differentiated understanding of political structure, ideology, and notions of personhood gained by anthropologists in recent years. The Grassfields of Cameroon are well known for their arts. Figurative sculpture, often of large scale, masks, brass objects cast in the lost wax method, beadwork and fine pottery fill museums and private collections in Europe and in America. The Grassfields is an area in which art production was an integral part of the political and economic activities. Jean-Pierre Warnier has shown that one of the characteristics of art production was the specialization of polities in particular products, such as fine woven bags, expertly carved masks, and durable pottery (1985, 54ff). While the relation- ship of art and political domain in the Grassfields is, of course, widely acknowledged, one can become rather frustrated by the simplistic approach</page><page sequence="4">14 CJAS / RCEA XXII:I I 1988 to political structure in most art historical writing on this region. Precon- ceived notions of Grassfields political structure and the role of art forms in it have hindered a more sophisticated understanding of the proliferation of art in this region. Consistently, researchers tend to generalize their findings in their respective geographical area of research, and since in depth studies of material culture have only been carried out in large kingdoms, such as Kom and Bamum, the model of the centralized state predominates. The "blue- print" underlying studies of art is best summarized in Tamara Northern's catalogue The Art of Cameroon (1984, 26). According to the common view, ethnic groups of the Grassfields are divided into chiefdoms or kingdoms, with a chief or king at the apex and a pronounced social and political hierar- chy of ranked male title-holders and royal and commoner lineages. The chief / king governs the chiefdom / kingdom together with the male regula- tory society and the traditional council. The regulatory societies support the king, who is the source of secular and priestly authority, while at the same time they serve as an agency to protect and maintain the kingship. This static and synchronic model diverges from anthropologists' and his- torians' findings, who for many years now have stressed the diversity of political structure in the Grassfields, the variations over time, and regional dynamics and processes. Thus, the analysis of Grassfields political organiza- tion in a study of the Bamenda Plateau by Warnier (1985) puts different emphases on the variables in Grassfields polities. According to his and other scholars' findings, local groups are composites which have resulted from dis- junctive migrations. The cause for such migrations of often minuscule groups of people were numerous, among them most commonly warfare fol- lowed by dislocation, succession conflicts, and economic pressures and aspi- rations. These migrations put in geographical contact unrelated groups of filiation. The resulting local groups were distributed along a continuum of political types, which extended from so-called "acephalous" societies to states. All polities were founded on the alliances between groups of filiation, manifesting themselves in such fora as councils of notables, associations, and in a rich civil life balancing the organs of power. These groups congre- gate almost everywhere around a leader or fon, who more than holding the powers of government, symbolizes and incarnates the alliance between the groups of filiation. Social control and conflict resolution are assured by rit- ual and decentralized means (Warnier 1985, 5). All recent in-depth local socio-political and historical analyses confirm these findings, among them Warnier's study of Mankon (1975), Richard Dillon's research in Meta' (1975), Claude Tardits' book on Bamum (1980), and my own work on the for- mation of the chiefdom of Weh (1976). The resultant picture of temporal and geographical dynamics has major implications for the questions that should be raised about art in the political domain in the Grassfields.</page><page sequence="5">S5 Christraud M. Geary: Bali-Nyonga and Bamum The following case study of art in the states of Bali-Nyonga and Barnum will demonstrate the kind of insights that can be gained by shifting the emphasis towards an analysis of political and historical process. The materi- als for these case studies come mainly from German, Swiss, and Cam- eroonian archives containing written and pictorial records dating back to the German colonial period which lasted from I891 to 1916 in the Grassfields region. I make extensive use of historical photographs which represent a rather unexplored and underused source in historical and in art historical studies (Geary 1986).' The kingdoms of Bali-Nyonga and Bamum were founded on military expansion. In both instances, small, well-organized groups of warriors came to dominate large areas and to establish economically successful states. Both Bamum and Bali-Nyonga had a pronounced bellicose ideology, in which the activity of war was seen as essential to maintain the state. This ideology was, for example, articulated in how individuals saw themselves. Until recently, Bamum and Bali-Nyonga men perceived themselves in terms of warriorhood. A full adult was one who had killed another person in war and had undergone the rituals necessary to purify him after this act, which then allowed him to address other forms of pollution. As one who had killed, he could participate in key rituals. This bellicose ideology permeated all spheres of life and made Bali-Nyonga and Bamum greatly feared by their neighbors. Both states subdued and integrated numerous groups in their orbit. Art and domination in Bamum In Bamum, a centralized kingdom, one can distinguish two major phases of expansion corresponding to two different modes of dealing with defeated populations. The first one occurred when the kingdom was founded by migrants who had seceded from the mythical kingdom of Rifum, located northeast of the Bamum kingdom. Under the founder King Nshare Yen, the immigrants subjugated polities east of their present-day capital Fumban. Conquered leaders (fotie) lost their autonomy and became subject to the Bamum king. They were allowed to remain in their settlements and paid tribute (Tardits I980, 523f.). In the early to mid-nineteenth century, under King Mbuembue, a second major expansion took place. Now subjugated populations and their leaders were resettled by force. They became the work force supporting the Bamum elite. This second drive caused many groups to flee Bamum territory. As a result of their expansion, the Bamum controlled major long-distance trade routes and gained access to desirable prestige media, such as brass and glass beads, which figure prominently in Bamum art. Bamum power and dominance were articulated in the visual domain,</page><page sequence="6">16 CJAS / RCEA XXII:I 1988 Plate i: Royal drums displayed in front of one of the entrances of the palace at Fumban.

Geary: Bali-Nyonga and Bamum which the Bamum court masterfully manipulated. This virtuoso use of art becomes evident in several strategies. For example, the Bamum appropri- ated the regalia of subjugated leaders as well as fine objects in their state treasures and kept them in the palace. These objects served as visual reminders of Bamum supremacy and the historical development of the Bamum state. At the same time, new emblems were bestowed onto these rulers and the leaders of important patrilineages, visual reminders of the ties with the court. The display of these emblems, be they particular types of apparel, adornment, or insignia, visually expressed the owners' close link to the court, articulating integration. Thus, there was not only diffusion of objects as Bravmann observed in the Asante realm, but at the same time convergence of art works at the court, which had been forcefully removed from their owners. Perhaps the most fascinating strategy to achieve integration of the many different groups was the resettlement of artists at the court who were mem- bers of patrilineages belonging to the subjugated groups of the Nguot and the Megnam. In the nineteenth century, the Nguot, accomplished carvers and brass casters, formulated the typical Bamum court style. The Megnam were bead embroiderers, covering the wooden sculpture of the carvers with intri- cate beadwork in colorful designs.2 Some of the best known Bamum art works today, such as thrones and statues, were the works of these artists. The appropriation and integration of the artists, their production of the most outstanding objects being used and displayed at the Bamum court, point to art as enacting ties between the numerous groups that make up Bamum. The emphasis on warfare is, of course, obvious in the occurrence of a proliferation of icons in the Bamum artistic repertoire, which drew their meaning from warfare and conquest. Thus, the motif of the victorious war- rior is rendered in sculpture, for example, in brass figures of men holding an enemy head, or in the form of a carved equestrian figure made from wood and then covered with beadwork (Geary 1988). Among the most common Bamum icons is the multivalent motif of the single head (Plate I), which in many instances reminds of the common practice of trophy taking during battle (Geary 1980, 13 ff). A zigzag motif which may occur on beaded male figures as well in other contexts has been identified as the spear icon, another allusion to prowess in war. The manipulation of the visual domain was thus an integral part of politi- cal strategy of the Barnum court, be it through media, forms, and iconogra- phy of the art works themselves inspired by the ideology of permanent war- fare, through congregating and accumulating the art objects of defeated groups at the Barnum court, through the diffusion of emblems from the Barnum court, and through the production of court art by subjugated and "appropriated" artists.</page><page sequence="8">18 CJAS / RCEA XXII: I 1988 Art in Bali-Nyonga The Bali-Nyonga had a political agenda similar to that of the Bamum. The Bali-Nyonga state was a congregate of diverse groups of filiation and small polities. Its history is equally one of military exploits and conquests. As Bali-Nyonga oral traditions assert, the Bali-Nyonga were of Chamba origin and arrived in the area where they now live by the nineteenth century after having left their homelands on the Benue River in the eighteenth century. This in itself has interesting implications for art studies, as questions of con- tinuity of art forms arise. Did the Bali-Nyonga bring with them Chamba art? We know, for example, that the Bali-Nyonga preserved some festivals of Chamba origin, among them the voma and the lela. However, a discussion of these continuities is premature, because the lack of data prohibits the establishment of such connections. Little is known about Chamba art, but it is to be hoped that a major forthcoming art exhibit and catalogue on the arts of people living on the Benue River will answer some of the questions.3 Different from the Bamum, who shared the cultural habitus with those they subjugated, the Chamba / Bali raiders spoke a foreign language. They seemed to have emphasized sculptural arts less than those they conquered or drew into their orbit. Early sources on Bali only make reference to the existence of a local pottery industry in Bali, although obviously not of extraordinary quality (Ankermann 1910, 305; Hutter 1902, 404ff). Figurative wood sculpture lacked. Yet, it was a major form of artistic expression and was an essential part in the political and historical discourse in the Grassfields. The possession of splendid masquerades, of wood sculptures depicting high-ranking individuals or rulers, and of elaborate thrones were major prerogatives and privileges of Grassfields leaders. Such art works demonstrated the power and prosperity of the leaders and the state, and legi- timized their rule. If the Bali-Nyonga were to be successful competitors in the region, they had to become conversant in this local idiom, just as they ultimately adopted a local language.4 Which strategies did they employ? While such historical processes often cannot be traced, turn of the century German sources on Bali-Nyonga and evidence from historical photographs allow some conclusions about the Bali-Nyonga "Grassfields-ization" as far as the production and use of sculptural art are concerned. At the core of the Bali-Nyonga confederation were the Chamba / Bali lineages forming the warrior elite. They dominated defeated populations and had entered into various forms of alliances with neighboring and befriended groups. Bali-Nyonga's military and economic successes - the Bali actively participated in the internal slave trade - were impressive. However, the major expansion of the state was closely linked with the arrival of the Germans in the Cameroon Grassfields. The first German to reach Bali- Nyonga on i6 January 1889 was the explorer Eugen Zintgraff who made Bali</page><page sequence="9">I9 Christraud M. Geary: Bali-Nyonga and Barnum his headquarters and later established a military post there (Zintgraff 1895). The Bali-Nyonga became close allies of the Germans, and in I891 Zintgraff officially installed their chief Garega I as the paramount chief over the large territory, much larger than the actual Bali-Nyonga confederation. With Ger- man military support, Garega I successfully increased his sphere of influence, creating a Bali-Nyonga hegemony (Geary I980). This expansion of Bali-Nyonga set into motion two processes. Groups which originally had not been part of the Bali-Nyonga confederacy rejected and revolted against Bali-Nyonga domination. At the same time, Bali-Nyonga attracted allies who sought protection and support. Among the allies drawn into the Bali-Nyonga orbit, the Pati (in other spellings pa Ti, ba Ti, Banti, or Bati) had a most interesting role. In the course of their history, the Pati had several encounters with the Bali- Nyonga. According to the Bali-Nyonga and Pati oral traditions, the Pati were allies of Nyongpasi, when this Chamba warrior who led the Bali-Nyonga to their present territory sojourned with them in the region of Koupara, now in the Bamum kingdom southwest of Foumban. In the I840s the Bamum war- rior king Mbuembue drove the Chamba / Bali and the Pati across the Nun River, from where the Chamba / Bali migrated on to the region where they presently live (Tardits I980, I4I; Chilver and Kaberry 1970, 251). The Pati moved south towards Bansoa, a Bamileke chiefdom, and were allowed to stay, while pursuing their close connection with the Bali-Nyonga. In fact, a German observer mentions that the mother of Fonyonga II, who ruled Bali- Nyonga from 1901 to 1940, was a Pati woman. According to the same docu- ment, scarcity of land forced the Pati under their chief Fomben Nguigong to leave Bansoa and join the Bali in 1904 on invitation of King Fonyonga II who had succeeded Garega I in 1901 (Adametz 1912). Another small group joined the Bali-Nyonga after the Pati had arrived. The Bawok, Bamileke who originated from near Bangangte and fled because they were threatened by the Bangangte chief, arrived in Bali-Nyonga in 19o6 or i907 under their chief Nana. Chilver, who gives a detailed description of Bawok history, mentions that Nana's sister was a wife of the Pati chief Fom- ben Ngiugong (Chilver 1964, 121). Even before joining the Bali-Nyonga, both Pati and Bawok were known for their carving skills. The Bali-Nyonga desig- nated them as bako, the carvers (Chilver 1964, 122). The arrival of the Pati and the Bawok enabled the Bali to enlist their ser- vices and to participate in the regional discourse, relying on visualization of salient ideological concepts and having art forms articulate and enact the premises on which their state was built. But besides drawing on the skills of the carvers, the Bali used various other strategies to present themselves in appropriate ways in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. First, the kings themselves began to produce works of art in order to be equals to</page><page sequence="10">20 CJAS / RCEA XXII: I1988 Plate 2: Display of the royal treasure during the lela festival.

Geary: Bali-Nyonga and Bamum other rulers in the region. Second, the king and the Bali elite imported rega- lia and prestige objects from major carving centers known for their fine pro- duction. Perhaps the most striking effort by the Bali kings to create the objects necessary for legitimizing leadership occurred when Garega I, who ruled from 1870 to 1901, took up carving. In the catalogue on the Royal Art of Cameroon, Tamara Northern quotes an intriguing remark about some sculptures made by the Bali-Nyonga themselves. According to the collec- tion records of the Linden-Museum at Stuttgart, a beaded stool once in the museum's possession had been made by King Garega I. In 1904 Captain Hirtler collected it in Bamenda, the location of the German military station some miles northeast of Bali-Nyonga. As we know from other writings by Hirtler, he was a dependable observer. He also noted that Garega I had made a beaded throne, half-size figures, and like objects, which were always displayed during important ceremonies. Hirtler saw these objects on the occasion of very interesting festivities in December of 19o02, which would be the time when the lela festival was celebrated. He further reported that bead decoration was occasionally used in Bali-Nyonga and that Fonyonga II had been instructed in beadwork by his father Garega I (Northern 1973, 66). Northern was unable to trace the sculptures that Hirtler mentioned. How- ever, there are several photographs taken during official functions and dur- ing the annual lela celebration which allow further conclusions. Three images, among them the one shown here by the missionary Jonathan Striebel (Plate 2), were taken before 1909. They show the beaded throne and the figures mentioned by Hirtler. Like other similar thrones made in the Grassfields, most notable the Bamum two-figure thrones, it consists of a round stool part with a leopard caryatid and two identical figures carved on its back. The figures' attire consists of loincloths and beaded headdresses delineated by cowries. Around their necks, they wear necklaces, and bracelets adorn their wrists. Both have slightly protruding breasts and prominent belly buttons, the latter being perceived as a sign of beauty. One figure holds a drinking horn, the other the head of an enemy. The association with warfare is obvious here. The important role of enemy heads in Bali-Nyonga warfare and ritual is discussed in several early sources (Hutter 1902, 355ff; Baumann and Vajda 1959, 239). It is not clear, by the way, whether the figures represent two males or a male and a female, as they both wear the same apparel. This throne is supposedly still kept in the Bali palace, although I have never seen it. Two beaded figures, now lost, were placed next to the throne. The much larger figure, clearly a representation of a man, wears a cotton prestige cap with burls, which seems to have been added on, and a striped loincloth. A large geometric design decorates its torso probably alluding to cicatrization,</page><page sequence="12">22 CJAS / RCEA XXII: I1988 which was a common practice in Grassfields. It holds a pipe, while the other figure, perhaps a woman, carries a drinking horn in its right hand and a bowl in the left. This sculpture displays a cicatrization around its belly button. In the background hang two beaded leopard skins. Similar beaded skins were part of royal treasures in several other Bamileke states of the Grassfields (Harter 1986, 126). An indigo-dyed prestige cloth (ndop), imported from the area around Wukari on the Benue River, is draped onto the fence in the back- ground. Another photograph shows the same objects and two additional beaded stools with leopard caryatids, no doubt the work of Bali-Nyonga art- ists. Comparing these beaded carvings to others which were produced in some of the major carving centers in the northwestern part of the Grassfields, one is struck by their angularity, the "clumsiness" of form. These stylistic characteristics might well lend credence to the assumption that Garega I himself, an occasional carver, had made them. This raises an interesting issue in art historical research on the Grassfields - the chief as carver. In fact, Garega I was not the only ruler who carved. The oeuvre of fon Yu of Kom whose reign began c.I865 and ended with his death in 1912 is, of course, well known (Harter 1986, 2o8ff; Nkwi and Warnier 1982, 178ff; Northern 1984, 94ff). The chief Ase Puonchu of Babanki-Tungo who ruled from 19o9 to 1918 and had learned the skills from his father, was an equally accomplished carver (Emonts I922, i68ff; Harter 1986, 186). Carving skills enhanced a ruler's prestige, for creativity was a much cherished attribute in leaders. Beadwork, according to Hirtler's information, created by Garega I himself and also by his son Fonyonga II, was prominent in the palace and occurred as decorative element on carved posts and on walls. On the occasion of the lela festival, several beaded posts were placed at the entrance of the palace. Bernhard Ankermann photographed two posts, each with four robust anthropomorphic figures placed on top of each other and a leopard effigy as the finial (Plate 3). According to Ankermann's observations, two other poles permanently installed at palace entrance were always newly beaded on the occasion of the lela festival. Another photograph taken by the Basel mis- sionary Jonathan Striebel before 19o09, allows the analysis of the poles (Plate 4). They ended in four "horns" covered with blue and white beadwork in checkerboard design. Tubular red beads as background, alternating dark and white lizards and lozenge motifs covered the poles. According to Anker- mann, who gave a detailed description of these "cult poles," as he called them, they served as support for the spear bundles of visitors and as hangers of lela paraphernalia (Baumann and Vajda 1959, 244). Judging by several other descriptions, one of the poles' functions was in war ritual when war- riors returned from battle. They hung the heads of killed enemies onto these and similar poles (Hutter 1902, 349). The photograph shows elaborate spear</page><page sequence="13">23 Christraud M. Geary: Bali-Nyonga and Bamum bundles with covered tips next to the palace entrance on the left. High- ranking Bali-Nyonga men owned such prestigious spear bundles. Leopard skins, a horn, and a piece of cloth hang from the poles. In the background, a blue and white indigo-dyed cloth covers the fence surrounding the palace district. A unique use of beadwork occurred inside the Bali palace. The walls of a throne chamber, which was located in the first courtyard of the palace, were covered with cloth onto which highly valued (reddish?) tubular beads had been sown in a lozenge design (Plate 5). Large round beads and cowrie trim were added. The stone throne once belonged to Garega I and was originally located in front of the palace entrance (Zintgraff 1895; 215, see also Hutter 19o02, plate 46). Before 19o8, when this photograph was taken by Anker- mann, Fonyonga II had moved the throne into the palace, where he sat on it when he gave audiences. The proliferation of expensive tubular beads and their ostentatious display in this newly-created throne chamber demon- strate in visual form the immense wealth that the Bali-Nyonga accumulated at the turn of the twentieth century as successful warriors and middlemen in the internal slave trade and as a result of the cooperation with the Ger- mans. Besides trying to carve themselves and creating lavish bead displays, the Bali-Nyonga rulers imported wood sculptures, and again historical photo- graphs are excellent sources to capture the proliferation of these carvings. Among the earliest Bali-Nyonga images in the Basel Mission Archive is a stereograph showing Fonyonga II in 1903, when the first missionaries arrived (Plate 6). This image is remarkable in several respects. First of all, it pictures two imported stools. The stool on the left is common and can be attributed to carvers of either Big Babanki, also known as Babanki-Daso, or Babanki-Tungo, two chiefdoms located north of Bali-Nyonga. The stool on the right has hares as caryatids, a zoomorphic motif rare in Grassfields iconography (Harter 1986, 224). We know nothing about the meaning of this icon. This stool is elaborated with brass tacks. Franz Hutter mentions stools with hare caryatids occurring in the territory of the Bali-Nyonga (which implies in the region under Bali-Nyonga domination) and presents a line drawing of a very similar stool in his book (Hutter 1902, 371). Pierre Harter suggests that these stools were carved by the Meta', who were neighbors of the Bali-Nyonga (Harter 1986, 224). Indeed, some of the Meta' villages unwillingly had come under Bali-Nyonga rule, and it seems that the Bali appropriated some of these Meta' creations. The two Babankis provided the Bali-Nyonga state with carvings which were distributed through the channels of prestige exchange. Babanki works must have been numerous in Bali, because Ankermann states that the carv- ings he saw in the palace were all imported from Babanki (Ankermann 191 o,</page><page sequence="14">24 CJAS / RCEA XXII: I1988 Plate 3: Beaded pillars at the entrance of the palace district.

Among them were door frames and columns. Several Babanki architec- tural carvings from the Bali-Nyonga palace came to the Museum fiir V6lkerkunde in Berlin because Ankermann was able to purchase them dur- ing his stay in Bali-Nyonga. Thus, the two poles, with male and female figures in relief carving placed on top of each other, visible behind Fonyonga in Plate 6, are now in Berlin (Krieger 1969, 23). The arrival of the Pati, who were known for their fine carvings, had a major impact on Bali-Nyonga's ability to participate fully in the visual dis- course that characterized the region. The Pati numbered 945 men, I Io6 women, and 8o8 children in 1912 (Adametz 1912). To give a comparison, in 1913 the Bali-Nyonga were estimated at approximately 7 3Io men, 7 3Io women and 14 620 children, which included territories they had conquered (Unruh 1913).5 The chief of the Pati was the equal of Fonyonga II because, as mentioned earlier, the Bali and the Pati shared a common history. Fomben Nguigong maintained his own palace on Bali-Nyonga territory and had retainers and a regulatory society. The equality of both kings was clearly expressed by the spatial and seating arrangements during official functions, such as a reception of German missionaries in 1905 (Plate 7) and by the rega- lia of the Pati chief. Dressed in a high-status loincloth of indigo-dyed ndop and wearing an elaborate cotton cap, he sits on a beaded throne which is sup- ported by an elephant caryatid. He displays a prestige pipe.6 Among his other regalia, which Ankermann photographed in 1908, were two stools, one of which displayed the head motif, and a necklace with two carved ivory figures - one might assume that one is female and the other male - with prestigious tubular beads, small encrusted seed beads, and cowries, a cere- monial dance spear with rattles, a flywhisk made from a horse tail with a beaded handle, and a lance with rattles and an openwork finial. However, the relationship between Fonyonga II and Fomben Nguigong became some- what precarious when, during German assessments, the Bali-Nyonga king began to claim the Pati as his subordinates. Soon after the Pati had arrived, their artists began to work in the palace. They carved door frames and objects, many of them decorated with an abun- dance of single heads (Plate 8). I suggest that in the Bali-Nyonga context proliferation of this motif on door frames is an artistic rendering of a com- mon practice in the area, namely that the skulls of enemies were hung along the eaves of houses. Ankermann reports that some Bali-Nyonga men kept enemy skulls inside their house, while in one case the proud warrior had strung them on a rope and put them along a wall of his residence (Baumann and Vajda 1959, 239). A photograph taken in 19o06 by Lieutenant von Wenck- stern in Nso, a large kingdom north of Bali-Nyonga, is the only pictorial doc- ument showing this practice.7 Rendering the trophy as head with a prestige cap rather than in the form of an actual skull impresses the wealth and</page><page sequence="23">33 Christraud M. Geary: Bali-Nyonga and Bamum power of the defeated upon the viewer and makes the victory over such an enemy even more formidable (Geary 198I, I8). Thus, the constant repetition of this icon states in visual terms that permanent warfare was the salient characteristic of Bali-Nyonga. The Pati also produced other objects for the Bali court. Among the out- standing Pati works were huge drums, one of which shows up in several photographs of the first inner courtyard of the palace (Plate 9). The motifs represented on the body of the drum in relief carving are the lizard, the ser- pent, and once more the all-pervasive head motif. Both lizard and serpent which is a referent to the leader, are common motifs in the Grassfields iconography. These drums compare favorably to other drums carved in the Bamileke area where the Pati once lived and where the Pati carvers had for- mulated their style, which corresponds to the conventional style of other Bamileke artists in the region around Bangangte and Bansoa. The most striking Bali-Nyonga effort to become fully conversant in the visual idiom prominent in Grassfields polities was the construction of a meeting house for important notables and heads of lineages (Plate io). The building of this house coincided with the production of the carved posts for the royal palace in Bamum between 1908 and 1911 (Plate I), and its building may have been triggered by the competition between both states. Competi- tive relationships between leaders could often take the form of what War- nier has characterized as "one up-manship" (1985, 26I). If one considers that important chiefs of the Grassfields tried to outdo each other when it came to the splendid representation of their power and wealth and when one takes into account that Bali-Nyonga and Bamum competed for local influence, it seems not unlikely that the Bamum efforts raised Fonyonga's desire to pos- sess an equally impressive building. This rivalry was a result of colonial intervention. Before the arrival of the Germans, Bali-Nyonga and Bamum were not directly in contact with each other. However, they knew about each other's existence (Zintgraff 1895, 202). During the German presence, both Bamum and Bali-Nyonga had become allies of the Germans and com- peted for the attention and the support of the German military administra- tion. While Bali-Nyonga initially had the full backing of the German mili- tary and was perceived as the ideal ally through which administrative poli- cies could be implemented, this role was later increasingly filled by Bamum. The erection of the meeting house and the carving of the posts can be accurately dated to the time period from 1909 to 1914 (at the latest). Anker- mann, who left Bali-Nyonga in 19o9 where he and his wife had spent over a year doing ethnographic research, does not mention this structure in his writings, so it is unlikely that it existed then. On the other hand, Anna Wuhrmann, who was a missionary teacher in Bamum from late 1911 to 1915 took the only two photographs we have of the original building before</page><page sequence="24">34 CJAS / RCEA XXII:I I 1988 the end of the German colonial period (Plate io). Thus, the meeting house was finished at the earliest in 19II1 and at the latest in early 1914. There is considerable confusion about its history in literature. In November 1940 when Paul Gebauer, an American Baptist missionary who spent many years in Cameroon, visited Bali-Nyonga, the early structure shown in the Wuhrmann photographs had been demolished, although the carved pillars were used for another building in the market square, which served similar purposes (Plate II). In a 1971 article on Grassfields architecture, Gebauer assumed that the "clubhouse" he photographed in the market square was the same structure which Zintgraff had referred to in 1891 (Gebauer 1971, 44; Zintgraff 1895, 182). However, all early reference to a "meeting house" by Zintgraff, Hutter, and Ankermann referred to an old meeting house located to the right of the main palace entrance. The fate of the carvings and the 1940 "clubhouse" is typical for many ancient buildings in the Grassfields. It fell into disrepair and the pillars were removed to the palace where for a while they remained in one of the courtyards. As time went by, the Bali-Nyonga sold some of them, which came onto the art market. Harter explored the location of the remaining fragments of the pillars now in col- lection all over the world (1986, 230ff). According to oral traditions in Bali-Nyonga, both Bawok and Pati carved the numerous sculptural pillars (see for example Gebauer 1971, 44). Harter tried to trace individual artists who were involved in the carving (Harter 1986, 231). During a visit in Bali-Nyonga in 1985, an old Bali retainer gave him names of several carvers who supposedly participated in the creation of the pillars. However, I am somewhat hesitant to subscribe to Harter's identification of individually named carvers, knowing the pitfalls one may encounter when working with oral testimony. I agree with him that several hands can be isolated. For example, a door frame that used to be in the palace of the Pati king bears strong stylistic resemblance to at least two posts of the meeting house. Hauptmann Adametz, who collected the door frame in 1913, after the Pati had left Bali-Nyonga, stated that the post was about ten years old, which means that it was carved when the Pati king began constructing his palace after his arrival in Bali-Nyonga territory (Krieger 1969, 24, plate 5I). The meeting house with its abundance of figurative carvings collapsed historical experience, bellicose ideology, and political agenda into a "meta- statement." The carved posts resembled pictorial texts, which unfortu- nately are hard to decipher after so many years have past since their produc- tion. The figures, men and women, depicted historical personalities, among them supposedly Garega I, who according to testimony collected by R. Dick-Read in the 1950s, gives a drinking horn filled with palm wine to one of the twin children of princess Daiga, while the other twin sucks his thumb</page><page sequence="25">3 5 Christraud M. Geary: Bali-Nyonga and Bamum (Harter 1986, 231). One of the warrior figures depicts Fonyonga II with a defeated enemy at his feet and a sword in the right hand (Harter 1986, 23 If.).8 A report by Wilhelm Kemner who visited Bali-Nyonga at the begin- ning of 1935 equally alludes to portraiture of historical as well as of impor- tant individuals who lived at the period when the carvings were produced. He was told that one of the figures represented Adametz, the German com- mander of Bamenda Station from 1911 to 1914 (Kemner 1941, 266). Indeed, in several photographs by Paul Gebauer, a light figure with a pith helmet and a uniform and boots is visible - no doubt the image of a German (Plate 12, extreme left). Although the exact meaning of many of these art works may have been lost forever, one of the central themes is the depiction of the successful warrior (see a man with a gun in Plate 12 on the right), the visual manifestation of the ideological premises underlying the Bali confederation. The visual record is clearly a tool in political action, stating Bali-Nyonga supremacy and intimidating those who saw these awesome works. Considering the precarious political situation in which the Bali-Nyonga king found himself from 1909 to 1912, the building of the meeting house takes on an added significance. It coincided with the decline of Bali- Nyonga's role as a major political force in the region. As mentioned above, Bali-Nyonga's immense influence during the German presence in the Grassfields depended on the support of the German military (Chilver 1967). The Germans had seen Garega I and his successor Fonyonga II as valuable agents to help enforce German policy. They had believed Zintgraff's assess- ment and the Bali-Nyonga kings' exaggerated claims that they controlled a large territory. For many years the administration believed that the Bali- Nyonga dominated numerous groups, not knowing that they had never been part of the Bali-Nyonga state before the arrival of the Germans. The German military faced constant rebellions of these unwilling Bali-Nyonga subjects and often intervened on Bali-Nyonga's behalf. After several re-assessments of the political situation, the Germans realized that they had unwittingly created a veritable military force, because the Bali as allies of the Germans were also extremely well armed. They began to fear that the Bali-Nyonga would turn against them and in 19o8 and 19o09 requisitioned the firearms. At the same time, German military administrators became increasingly weary of Bali-Nyonga's "sub-imperialism" and freed many groups under Bali-Nyonga domination from the Bali "yoke." Bali-Nyonga's influence was greatly reduced. Seen in this historical context, the construction of the meeting house might be perceived as a visual assertion of Bali identity and supremacy and as a glorification of history and bellicose ideology in the face of adverse political circumstances. The relationship between the Pati and the Bali-Nyonga also came to an abrupt end. The Pati grew increasingly discontent with Fonyonga's efforts to</page><page sequence="26">36 CJAS / RCEA XXII: I1988 Plate i : Clubhouse in the market square. Bali-Nyonga, 1940.

For example, when the Germans assessed the Bali-Nyonga kingdom, he clearly stated that the Pati were his "vassals" (Adametz 1912). Fonyonga II and Fomben Nguigong had a falling out and the Pati contemplated moving on. In 1911 the military administration, pursuing a policy of reducing Bali- Nyonga's influence, encouraged the Pati to sever their alliance with the Bali-Nyonga and to relocate to an area near Galim on the Nun River, assigned to them by the military administration. The departure of the Pati dealt Fonyonga II a major blow, because the Pati king and his men had been Fonyonga's closest advisers (Keller 1912, 3). With the most prolific carvers gone, large-scale art production in Bali-Nyonga ceased. The Bawok stayed behind, but increasingly their carvings lacked refinement and were of medi- ocre quality. The Bali-Nyonga rulers' deliberate effort to articulate their political identity through artistic means had come to an end. It faltered with the loss of Bali influence and inability to command the resources in the form of artists who were necessary to create these art works. Conclusion Owing to a wealth of contemporary documentation on both Bali-Nyonga and Bamum, the role of art in political process could be explored in detail. A comparison of the two kingdoms shows that the Bamum and Bali-Nyonga kings pursued different strategies for producing and employing art in creat- ing a cohesive state. The Bamum "appropriated" foreign artists who created art works for the palace. They also removed art works and emblems of lead- ers once they had subjugated them. At the same time, in a reverse process, they endowed these leaders with new, Bamum-made emblems. The Bali- Nyonga scenario was different. During a period in Bali-Nyonga history when the state had achieved a highly influential position in the region because of German support, groups of foreign carvers were attracted to Bali-Nyonga and settled there. They began to work for the Bali-Nyonga elite. In addition, imported art works allowed Bali-Nyonga to project their power and wealth in visual terms. Finally, in a somewhat unique move, two kings, being the ultimate creators, produced carvings and beadwork themselves. Art produc- tion and use of art works at the Bali-Nyonga court, however, was closely linked with the state's political fortune. When it went into a decline after 19o09, prolific art production and consumption declined also. Both the Bamum and the Bali-Nyonga scenarios demonstrates the close link of art production and the use of art works with political and historical process. Manipulating the visual sphere was instrumental to the success of both states. In integrating conquered or allied populations, the expressive and often intimidating qualities of art works were fully exploited. From the detailed analysis of art and its involvement in historical and political</page><page sequence="29">39 Christraud M. Geary: Bali-Nyonga and Bamum processes emerges a more dynamic, subtle, and differentiated picture, going beyond the art historians' findings that art merely reflects a political situa- tion perceived as static. The analysis of art in process greatly enhances the comprehension of the meaning of visual arts in the political domain in Africa. Notes I. Research for this paper was carried out during three years of fieldwork in the Cameroon Grassfields. Furthermore, written records and photographs in numerous archives all over Europe and in Cameroon were consulted. Several institutions allowed me to use their photographs for this essay. My thanks go in particular to Paul Jenkins of the Basel Mission Archive in Switzerland, to Dr. Hans Joachim Koloss and Dr. Angelika Tunis of the Museum fiir V61kerkunde Berlin, to Dr. Wulf Lohse of the Hamburgisches Museum fiir Valkerkunde in the Federal Republic of Germany, and to Virginia Webb of the Goldwater Library at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. 2. Beads, in particular little round seed beads, were imported to the Grassfields from Europe. In order to apply bead embroidery to a sculpture, the artist would first cover it with raffia cloth or burlap. Then, he would stitch the beads onto the fabric. 3. The exhibit is presently organized by the Museum of Cultural History of the University of California at Los Angeles. 4. Tardits (1980, 141) states that the Bali-Nyonga adopted the language of the Pati, from which the Mungaka, that is, the Bali language is derived. Indeed, Mungaka is very close to Shiimom, the language the Bamum adopted when they settled around Foumban (see also Jeffreys 1962, 175). 5. The German station in Bamenda kept population statistics which were con- stantly adjusted estimates. They figured the ratio of men, women and children as 1:1:2. Certainly, these counts should be used with caution. However, they allow at least to assess the relative size of particular groups. 6. Large pipes were not smoked. Rather they would be displayed during state func- tions and, as we can see in the photograph, symbolically smoked. 7. This photograph which is in the archive of the Museum fir V61kerkunde Berlin (no. VIII A 1536) was taken during a German military campaign against the Nso king- dom. 8. Harter's dating of the post is incorrect, and I am somewhat hesitant to believe the information that he received 75 years after the work had been carved. Bibliography Adametz, Hauptmann. 1912.
