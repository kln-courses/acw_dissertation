<plain_text><page sequence="1">SIX SITES ON THE FORT SILL MILITARY RESERVATION James B. Shaeffer PIG FARM CROSSING SITE, CM-26 Background This site "was excavated during the- spring and summer .1960. During the spring, work was begun by an extension class of the University of Oklahoma consisting of military and civilian personnel enrolled from Fort Sill plus a few interested persons from Lawton and Chickasha. * Excavation during this period was limited to Saturdays and extended over a 10 week period. Later in the summer the additional 10 days spent on this site was supported by National Park Service funds. The Site The site is located among large oak trees along the east bank of East Cache Creek. This stream is a tributary of the Red River 40 miles to the south and is joined about a mile north of the site by Medicine Creek, the main east-west drainage of the Fort Sill area. At the present time the channel of the creek cuts deeply into the banks on both sides of the stream. The drop from the top of the bank to the stream channel is 15 to 20 feet. The area is well wooded, and the main vege tation consists of large oak trees interspersed among a very heavy secondary growth. A considerable amount of brush, and in summer vines, adds to the tangle. The oak trees which cover the site now are perhaps a hun dred years old. They are 4 to 5 feet in di ameter and had obviously grown in the site after its earlier occupation. The site derives its name from the nearby ford of East Cache Creek, a few hundred feet to the south of the site. This crossing is evidently an old one where a natuaral slope to the river, together with a firm bottom in the stream channel, permitted easy crossing of the high banks on either side. At this point on the east bank, a low ridge, probably much earlier a bluff along the creek, narrows the first terrace so that it is only several hundred feet wide. The bluff prehistorically must have offered both shelter from the wind and sun as well as an inconspicuous location for a camp site. The occupation area extends from the vi cinity of the ford on the south tc a distance of perhaps 300 feet to the north where the creek bends to the northwest. The occupation area follows a low ridge which parallels the slight meandering of the stream. It is probable that this slight rise on which the site occurs resulted from earlier flooding and washing when the stream was at high flood. The creek is still subject to such periodic flooding at approximately 20 year intervals. Excavation Procedure The occupation area indicated by surface evidence as probably having the best preser vation and the most intensive use was blocked off by stakes into a series of 20-foot squares. Four rows of these stakes were designated, A, B, C, and D. These extended north while rows 1 to 6 were extended east, thus griding the areas of most intense occupation which was located about 40 feet east of the creek bank. Four-foot square test pits were begun in the lower left or southwest corner of each block beginning with A/1. Further testing was done as indicated in Figure 14. Except for buffalo bone and flint scraps all of these test pits were negative. Concurrent with the organized test pitting, excavation was begun in areas where features projected above the surface. The most iThe Archaeological Field Class consisted of the following persons: Capt. Theodore L.Bradley, USA, Capt. Lewis W. Haskell, USA., Lt. Col. John T. Hoyne, USA., Mrs. Henry P. Lynch, Mrs. Helen Marjorie Marler, Capt. James F. Meade, Mr. David Modisett, Miss Elizabeth Anne Powell, Lt. Col. Philip M. Turner, USA, Mr. Clarence P. Wilson, and James A. Marler, Assistant Director of the U. S. Army Artillery and Guided Missile Center Museum. Mr. Gillette Griswold, Director of the Museum also materially aided the organization and conduct of this field program. 130</page><page sequence="2">^C^^ ^ ^ ^^^^^ LEGEND A 1-1 "~?

(Shaeffer 1960b; 7) Areas No. 2 and No. 3 were subsequently encountered in the widening of the original test trench. The first post holes were also picked up at the time when the trench was carried to the south. When the significance of the post holes was realized, digging was begun in that direction resulting in the grad ual uncovering of the house area. Random test pitting to the south of the dwelling proved fruitless, principally because frequent flood ing had eroded this area. The Living Area The area which was investigated had sur vived most of the effects of the military operations. It was located towards the north end of the occupation area. Here were con centrated the main features of the excavation, part of a circular house about 30 feet in diameter, an exterior stone hearth, a cooking and/or cache pit plus scattered buffalo bone debris. All of the latter were found outside and to the north of the house circle but within a radius of 20 feet of it. The artifacts listed in Figure 15 were all found in proxi mity to the structure either within 5 feet of the north exterior wall or just inside the circle within a foot or two of the inside wall. House Circle Approximately half of the house circle was uncovered at a depth of 6 to 8 inches below the surface. The evidence consisted of some 10 post holes arranged at irregular intervals over a diameter of 30 feet. The best pre served post hole pattern was obtained in the northwest section where 6 holes 3 to 4 inches in diameter were arranged at 2 to 2 1/2 foot intervals. These holes were from 1 to 4 feet in depth. A blank space of 12 to 14 feet on the north side of the circle intervened be tween the set of 6 post holes and the second set of 4 post holes. These latter were more ir regularly spaced, being a little over 5 feet from each other. These post holes were rather shallow and much more difficult to de fine. In addition several secondary interior post holes were located 2 to 3 feet within the circle wall of the house. No evidence of a fireplace was found but the other half of the house had been badly eroded and perhaps disturbed by military encampment. Obviously, this negative evidence is not con clusive. Since the greater number of artifacts came from the vicinity of the 2 post groupings, the break in the circle may be assumed to be some sort of entryway. Hearths Hearth #1. This consisted of a circle of very friable, flat, sandstone rocks 3 to 3 1/2 inches in diameter. The bottom of the hearth was formed of flat rock while the sides were formed of these stones layed up several layers thick around the edge. This type of hearth has also been noted on Medi cine Creek and as far west as Blue Beaver Creek. While a considerable amount of car bon was found mixed with the disintegrated sandstone in the fill,nothing except flint chips was found in proximity to the hearth. Hearth #2. This hearth showed originally as a discolored earth in the shallow trench 10 feet northwest of Hearth #1. As the excavation was carried deeper, the carbon became more pronounced. Definite pieces of charcoal and fire blackened and thermal factured rock were encountered at the bottom of the pit at a depth of 3 feet. The pit was slightly oval in shape, about 4 feet wide and 5 feet long, and with a bowl-shaped slope to the bottom. The pit fill contained some flint and occasional fragments of mussel shell. No artifact fragments were found in the fill. Buffalo Bone Concentrations As indicated on the site plan (Fig.13), 5 concentrations of buffalo bone were located. Concentrations Nos. 1, 2, and 3 were ap parently all parts of the same animal. They consisted of ribs, scapula, and forelegs. Concentrations Nos. 4 and 5 could have been from different animals. Small quantities of bone occurred everywhere but no large bones were encountered within the house circle. Material Culture Adze (1) Fig. 17 (3) Outline: Rectangular with slightly incurv ing sides; one end straight; cutting and slightly concave. Profile: Flat underside and turtle-back on top side; center relatively flat with slight slope at top and pronounced slope toward cutting edge at the blade end. Chipping: The rectangular blank was per cussion chipped and secondarily chipped on the concave blade end. There is also some secondary chipping along one side indicating possible secondary use as an unhafted scraper.

In any event this is not a local flint;the material, if not the implement, is intrusive. Function: With its flat face, curved back, and curved blade, this tool is similar in appearance to the metal adze blade fasten ed to the end of a V-shaped wooden handle which was used for defleshing buffalo hides during the historic period. However, this present implement, because of its thickness, could also have been used as an unhafted hide scraper. Dimensions: Length, 10.7 cm.; width, at top, 7. 7 cm.; width at blade, 7.0 cm.; minimum width at center, 8.6 cm.; average thickness, 2.5 cm. Chopper (2) Dark, natural-shaped river stones which have been split by percussion; one side has been percussion chipped on both edges, probably by use. This tool could also have been used as a scraper though the unground character of the percussion work would seem to indicate chopping as a primary function. Drill (1) Fig. 18 (2) This is a central fragment having an elon gated beveled shape with a flat back, rounded top surface and with unifacial secondary chipping along the sides. The size of the flint is small. Therefore, its use as a knife was possibly only secondary whereas in the specimens described under Knife, their larger size suggests cutting rather than drilling as the primary function. The material in this case, a type 22 flint (Shaeffer 1960b: 59) is a light grey or dark cream color and is probably of local origin. Knife (3) Fig. 17 (8) Type 1 Outline: Lozenge shaped with one end nar rowing to a point; the other end expanding and then narrowing to a rounded end. Profile: Flat on one side and the other side more irregular and thicker at both ends. Chipping: All-over chipping on both sides; secondary chipping on all edges; a pro nounced bevel at the pointed end; a slight bevel at the rounded end. Material: Appears to be a Texas flint, possibly Alibates variety, though the red mottling on the cream to grey background is more maroon than is found in flint from the Amarillo quarry. Dimensions: Length, 11.8 cm.; maximum width, 4.5 cm.; average thickness, . 5 to . 6 cm. Projectile Point (14identifiable)Fig. 18 (5-11) Type 1: Washita River type (Bell 1959: 98). Type 2: Fresno type (Kreiger 1956: 498). Type 3: Similar to Type 2 but upper third oLpoint serrated on edges. Type 4: Diamond shaped; fine all over flaking both sides; well made and well balanced; made of a dark, non-local flint. Length, 3.3 cm.; width, 1.0 cm.; thick ness, . 2 to .3 cm. Type 5: Base only; a small stemmed type of local flint. Width of stem, . 5 cm. Type 6: Dart type (Shaeffer 1960b 51); quartzite; thick, crude, percussion work and no secondary chipping. Dimensions, 4. 0 cm.; maximum width above stem, 2. 0 cm.; maximum thickness above stem, 1. 0 cm. Possibly intrusive as is scraper, Type 5 from nearby quartzite site to north along East Cache Creek.

Dimensions, length 2.1 cm. to 3.3 cm.; maximum width, 1.9 to 2. 3 cm.; thickness, . 5 cm. to . 6 cm. Type 2 - Fig. 18 (1) Outline: Triangular with flat edge at the wide end. This form is the natural shape of the flint splinter rather than arrived at by intention.

Chipping: Secondary chipping along two edges of lower 2/3 of splinter; opposite edges are roughly beveled. Material: A good quality, dark, smokey, local flint. Though this is the most com mon type found on all pottery horizon sites in this area, it appears to be similar to types of flint used in north central Texas. Function: The first impression is that of a drill. However, the size and the beveled edges make the form similar to the Type 2 knife. The additional function of a drill was probable. Dimensions: Length, 8.2 cm. (point mis sing); width at upper end (est.) 4.0 cm.; thickness along ridge, . 5 to .9 cm. Type 3 - Fig. 17 (7) Outline: Circular to leaf-shaped. Profile: An off-center ridge which results from beveling; however, there is no cor responding bevel on the opposite side; underside is flat but material has an upward curve at the pointed end. Chipping: Confined mostly to the ridges though there is some chipping on the flat underside. Material: Same as Type 2, a translucent, dark, greyish flint of the Texas type. Function: While the curved edge could have been used for cutting purposes, the straight edge could have functioned very well as a scraper because of the location of the bevel close to the edge of the blade. Dimensions: Length, 9.0 cm.; maximum width, 4.0 cm., thickness, .8 to 1.0 cm. Type 4 - Not Illustrated. A small, thick, circular-shaped, quartzite scraper with the thickest part to the rear of the blade instead over the blade as in Type 1. Since this specimen was a surface find, it may not be associated with this type of site but with an earlier horizon located 1/2 mile to the north on the east side of East Cache Creek. On these ear lier sites quartzite is the predominant material. (Shaeffer 1960b.) Type 5 (4) - Fig. 18 (4) Random flake scrapers; 3. 5 cm. to 5. 0 cm. in maximum dimensions and of variable thickness (.6 cm. to 1. 9 cm.). Materials; 3 of quartzite, 1 flint, Type 22. The latter specimen was found just northwest of the house circle. Ground Stone Handstone (5) Fig. 17 (2) A heavy, natural, ovoid boulder of rhyo litic sandstone; turtle-backed with under side only roughly flat but showing some use planes. Possibly used as a multi purpose tool, as a muller, chopper (some edges battered), hammer and pounder. Maul (1) - Fig. 18 (18) A small, full-grooved, oval-shaped sand stone with one end larger than the other. Both ends are rounded. However, from the extreme friability of this sandstone (it is sandy to the touch) this would appear to be a ceremonial rather than a functional implement. It is even possible that de spite the maul-like appearance, it was not so used. Mano (3) Type 1 - Fig. 17 (1) Flat, thin, and oval in shape, this is quite a symmetrical mano made of porous lime stone. One side is quite flat and the other has a very slight convexity. It is the lat ter side which shows wear. Dimensions: Length, 13.0 cm.; width 10. 5 cm. ; thick ness, 1.9 cm. Another fragment of the same type appears to be thicker (3. 0 cm. ) and -is made of a very friable sandstone. Type 2 - Fig. 17 (4) An elongated turtle-back shape of fine sand stone which is again very friable. Dimen sions: Length (est.), 12.0 cm.; width, 7. 0 cm.; thickness along ridge, 3. 4 cm. Metate (1) Fig.18 (19) Fragment of a thin, slab metate showing pecking on both surfaces. Thickness of 2. 8 cm.; the material is of a friable, fine grained,grey sandstone. Bone Bead (1) Fig. 18 (13) A short (1.3 cm.), small (.8 cm. thick), hollowed bone bead with rounded ends; well polished. Type of bone not determinable. Digging Stick Point (1) Fig. 18 (17) A heavy fragment of split buffalo bone which has been rounded at one end and secondarily worked; sides are parallel and show no signs of wear. There is a slight indentation on the upper, unfinished part where the bone was probably lashed to a stick. This implement fastened to a short stick could also have been used as a scrap er. Dimensions:Length, 10.4 cm. ;maximum width, 3. 4 cm. ;maximum thickness 1.0cm.</page><page sequence="9">138 18^^^^ 19 Fig. 18 - Artifacts from Cm-26.

The rim is outcurving and marked on the lip by a series of continuous cross-hatchings. Decoration on the exterior is a series of square punctations about 1. 0 cm. apart;rows are 1.0 cm. to 1.5 cm. apart. The temper is sand; small quartz grains glint on the surface under light; wall thickness varies from . 5 cm. to . 7 cm. Type 2 (2 sherds) Fig. 18 (15-16) A plainware with sand temper; in color varies from yellowish to reddish; temper is fine to coarse sand; thickness . 6 cm. to . 7 cm. Type 3 (1 sherd) - Not Illustrated A plain blackware; quite thin (. 4 cm. ) and hard; fine sand temper; exterior fairly smooth. Hematite (12) Hematite was found in fairly large chunks from 2. 5 cm. to 5. 5 cm. in largest dimen sions. In color the mineral varies from a brick to a maroon red. No pulverized or cake hematite was found. Most of the smaller pieces under 2.5 cm. show signs of wear from rubbing Shell (16) The mussel shell appears to be of a single type and probably collected for food pre historically from East Cache Creek. No specimens were found which showed per forations or other use as ornaments. Rock (154) Rock mostly concentrated in the 2 hearth areas was firecracked. Most material was predominantly limestone with some sandstone and occasional pieces of por phoritic rhyolite which compose the spine of the Wichita Mountains in this section. Animal Bone The great majority of the splintered and split bone found scattered about was buf falo. In addition a few bones were found of rabbit, deer, and rodents. White Culture (44) The material listed in the site inventory (Fig. 8) is of two general periods; the one in the late 1800's and early 1900's and the other after 1915. The first group includes Glass Type 4 and Porcelain Type 2 (Shaeffer 1960b: 29). The second group includes probably all of the metal objects as well as the wooden bead or fishing bob ber. BORROW PIT SITE, CM-127 Background This site was reported to the U.S. Army Artillery and Guided Missile Center Museum at Fort Sill in the spring of 1960 by a mem ber of the Museum staff who had collected, among other items, a large cordmarked sherd. This latter item was of immediate interest since only one small sherd of this type had been found during the survey of the reservation the previous spring. It was sur mised at that time that the cordmarked pot tery of the Washita Focus was virtually ab sent from this area due either to a time difference or lack of contact between the focii. Upon subsequent investigation, the cordmarked pottery site was found to be a part of a large materials pit in current use by the Army engineers as a source of fill material for various construction projects on the reservation. Location The borrow pit was located northeast of Key Gate, about 1/4 of a mile east of highway U. S. 277, and about 1/8 of a mile southeast of the bridge which crosses the highway north of the main gate. At this point, Medicine Creek joins East Cache Creek about 1/4 of a mile to the east of U.S. 277. The site itself is on the south bank of Medicine Creek and back from it, at present, about 100 yards. The Site The site appears to have extended for ap proximately 400 yards east-west and perhaps 50 to 100 yards north to south. It was very difficult to visualize the site as it had been buried under 4 to 5 feet of silt resulting from a shift in the creek channel. The occupation which was perhaps about 1 foot thick had been almost completely removed by machinery. What remained were occasional concentra tions of hearth stones, blackened areas, and places where mussel shells were exposed. While the occupation area probably extended beyond that uncovered by the engineers' ex cavation, this could not be exploited due to</page><page sequence="11">140 the depth of the overburden. However, in one instance, a hearth was excavated in the south east corner of the borrow pit. This hearth consisted simply of a circular pile of river boulders without a hearth depression and with out cultural association. Nothing of signifi cance was learned from this feature. Excavation An attempt was made initially to stake the area off into conventional 20 foot grid squares. However, this proved impractical as the routine operation of vehicles and machines continually destroyed the grid system. Con sequently, the only solution was to attempt to salvage a representative collection of material to accompany the cordmarked sherd which had been previously found. First, members of the University of Okla homa Extension class and, later, the Salvage Project operating with Park Service funds searched the bottom of the borrow pit for signs of hearth and other cultural material which was still imbedded in the pit floor. Ex cavation was commenced in the vicinity of such finds. As a result, sufficient material was recovered to establish the distinctiveness of this site from the Pig Farm Crossing site a little less than 3 miles to the southeast along East Cache Creek. Preservation of specimens, especially frag ile items, was very poor due to the weight of the excavation machinery and the fact that some of the material had been secondarily deposited by scrapers and bulldozers during the course of their operations. This would have been quite a valuable site had it been located before the borrow operation had reached the occupation level. As it was, no structural features at the site could be re corded. Even most of the existing hearths were residual by the time of the archaeologi cal excavation.

The straight edge is beveled on both sides and is blunted by percussion wear. One side is slightly smoothed as though second arily used for polishing; the other side is not. Dimensions: Length, (est.) 16.0 cm.; maximum width, 7.0 cm.; average thick ness, 1. 5 cm. Hammerstone (4) Roundish, heavy, homogeneous rocks of a tan quartz, sandstone, or flint boulders. Variation in maximum dimensions: 8. 5 cm. to 9. 5 cm. Mano (11) Type 1 (1) Oval"shaped manos with pecked edges of dark sandstone; both faces used for grind ing. Grinding faces double faceted with a ridge down the middle of both sides. Di mensions: Length, 13.5 cm.; maximum width, 8.5 cm.; average thickness, 4.2 cm. Type 2 (3) Outline is triangular; cross-section is wedge-shaped. One specimen has a rough, concave upper surface with a pecked de pression in the center. One side of the mano only was used for grinding. Another specimen had some pecking on its edge especially at its wider and thinner end. This specimen also showed pecking on the upper side as though it was secondarily used as a crushing implement. Dimensions: Length, 14.0 cm. to 14.1 cm.; maximum width, 11.0cm. to 11.2cm.; maximum thickness, 3.5 cm. to 5.5 cm. Type 3 (4) Heavy, fairly thick, irregular limestone blocks with rough top surface and flat grinding planes on the underside. Blanks were percussion outlines elongated or cir cular forms and then ground into final shape. Dimensions: Length, 11.5 cm. to 13.0 cm.; width, 8.1 to 9.1 cm. ; maxi mum thickness, 3.2 cm. to 3.5 cm. Type 4 (4) Large circular-shaped manos with pecked edges, concave upper surface, flat under side; edges often chipped and may have been secondarily used as choppers. Only one complete specimen. Dimensions: maximum diameter, 15.0 cm.; maximum thickness, 5.5 cm. Metate (1) Fragment of a slab type metate made of thin sandstone; rough finished on under side but with a smoothed and pecked upper grinding surface. Thickness, 1.6 cm. Pounder (6) Heavy, natural shaped, roundish boulders varying from 11.0cm. to 16.00 cm. in diameter and from 7.0 cm. to 10.0 cm. in thickness. These are evidently multi purpose, occasional tools. They show a few small grinding facets and are battered on the edges. Seemingly they were used primarily because of their weight and toughness for pounding; secondarily they were used as handstones. Some show more use in one function than the other. Polisher (1) Small, fine-grained, turtle-backed river pebble having a very flat under surface which shows polishing from use. Dimen sions: Length, 5.5 cm.; width, 4.5 cm., thickness, 2.5 cm. Chipped Stone Celt (1) This specimen is a small, thick, heavy, oval-shaped stone. Percussion work has shaped this stone on all sides but one end. There is a definite rounded bevel to all edges. However, there is no work on the large surfaces of the stone. Possibly this was blank for a celt rather than the tool itself. On the other hand, left unhafted this specimen could have had other func tions. Dimensions: Length, 7.6 cm.; width, 4.5 cm.; thickness, 3.2 cm. Scraper (1) A roughly rectangular piece of basalt with large, random percussion scars along all sides. Percussion work on both faces along one edge. Held along the unfinished back edge of this implement could have been used either as a flake scraper or a flake knife.</page><page sequence="13">142 Pottery Type 1 (1) Surface: Vertical cordmarking in neck region. Cords dominate pattern; little evidence of knots; average width between ridges .4 cm. to .5 cm.; cordmarking slightly obliterated. Temper: Bone with prominent grains of limestone and quartz sand. Color: Tan exterior and interior. Thickness: . 5 cm. near rim; further down on sherd . 8 cm. Affiliation: Initial impression that of Stamper Cordmarked but this type is thick er, of softer paste, and coarser temper. Type 2 (5) Surface: Cordmarking; cords almost com pletely obliterated; fingermarks very defi nite on interior of these sherds. Temper: Grains of sandstone and lime - stone prominent; also some bone temper. Color: Lighter than Type 1; one specimen burned black inside and out. Thickness: .8 cm. to 1.1 cm. Thicker softer paste than Type 4. Affiliation: Initial impression that of Safford Cordmarked. But this type differs from that of Washita River Focus in that paste is not so thick, coarse, or hard. This temper is of finer, more homo geneous type. Type 3 (1) Surface: Plainware, exterior bumpy and slightly sandy to touch; interior slightly porous appearance; quartz grains on sur face glitter in light. Temper: Small quartz grains and some bone temper; fine sand. Color: Grey splotched with black. Thickness: .5 cm. to .8 cm. Affiliation: Not a Caddoan type of smooth surface. This undulating, bumpy surface is distinctive. Type 4 (1) Surface: Plainware; surface flat but not polished. Temper: Large rock grains and some bone; light "feel" to sherd. Color: Dark tan with dark splotches; in terior black. Thickness: . 6 cm. to . 7 cm. Affiliation: Not early Caddoan type be cause of coarse temper. This type is thinner than Lindsay Plain of the Washita Focus and thicker than the Stamper plain ware of the Optima Focus. Bone (64) The majority of the bone found was well cracked deer bone. No buffalo bone was found at this site. In addition to deer bone, box turtle, soft-shelled turtle, cat fish, and rodent remains were found. Shell (35) 'In comparing this site to other sites on the military reservation, it is found that shell occurred fairly abundantly. The quantity listed in the inventory (Fig. 19 ) does not represent the total noted. A considerable number of very small pieces had been crushed and scattered about the borrow pit. The shell appears to be native mollusk of 2 types and similar to that found at the Pig Farm Crossing Site. Wattle Five burned pieces of clay were found in lumps oxidized to a brick red color. They were made of a very sandy clay contain ing a heavy temper of minute quartz grains similar to that described in the temper of pottery Type 3. The impressions of small sticks and reeds were visible. On some specimens, flat surfaces were noted indicating that the clay had been pressed against poles. Thickness of the pieces varies from 1.0 cm. to 2.0 cm. Lithic Debris The relatively small amount of lithic de bris found represented types previously described. (Shaeffer 1960b:). They are listed as follows: Quartzite 1 Porphortic 1 Basalt 1 Flint, Alibates 1 Flint, Type 2 2 Flint, Type 5 8 Flint, Type 6 1 Flint, Type 9 1 Flint, Type 12 1 Flint, Type 17 19 Rocks A few limestone rocks 5. 0 cm. to 6. 0 cm., in maximum dimensions were found. These were fire-blackened and thermal-fractured. They evidently represented the remains of hearths or cooking pits similar to those found at the Pig Farm Crossing Site.</page><page sequence="14">143 THE BOUNDARY SITE, CM-128 Background This site was located by James Marler, Assistant Director of the U. S. Army Artil lery and Guided Missile Center Museum, dur ing a week-end archaeological exploration on the reservation during the spring of 1960. This site was not investigated, however, until the summer of 1960. Assisting in the sub surface testing were those persons who had been in the spring archaeological class of the University of Oklahoma Extension Division. Location This site was exposed as a result of the cut ting of a firebreak along the north boundary fence of the Fort Sill Military Reservation. At the upper end of Crater Creek there are a number of intermittent streams which have their rise in the area north and northwest of the Cross Mountains which are southeast of Quannah Parker Lake. The site is on the south bank of one of those tributaries which skirt the north edge of Mount McKinley. This area is fairly rocky, but there is a nar row flood plain on either side of the stream bed. The latter is bordered by a series of small washes with steep banks. The site is located on the top of one of the rises formed by 2 of these north-south drainages entering the stream. The occupation is about 50 yards north of the creek bank. At present the boundary fence intervenes between the site and the stream bank. The Site The site was quite shallow due to its ex posed position on the knoll. The fire trail which extended over this knoll and down the other side was about 60 feet wide. Most of the site material, burned rock and a few animal bones, had been pushed aside by a road patrol. Efforts were made to locate the occupation area more fully but the tough ness of the clay and the shallowness of the site prevented the uncovering of any structur al features. Excavation A number of test pits were dug but except for the finding of several buffalo bones and miscellaneous flint chips, little was uncover ed by this method. Most of the material re ported upon was recovered from the surface and from explorations in the row of dirt left by the road machinery. About 10 persons were involved in the excavation to which 6 hours were devoted. At the end of that period, the results had become negative and further investigation was deemed fruitless.

At that time, it was recognized as the longest site which had been located. Material was exposed for at least a mile on the flat along the north bank of Medi cine Creek. It was supposed at that time that the material was from a Plains Indian camp site. (Shaeffer 1960b: 114). Location At the time of the 1959 survey, material was exposed in a truck trail which paralleled the edge of the second terrace along Medicine Creek. This road which was used by military vehicles on maneuvers was quite irregular and rough, and as a result, a considerable amount of material was collected in the road way, especially toward the west end of the large field which the road bordered. At the location of the site, in the middle of the east west length of the field, the stream is within 50 feet of the upper bank while at the extreme ends of the site, the stream is perhaps 100 feet to the south. The lower bank or first terrace is thickly covered with vegatation interspersed with larger trees, especially oaks which in summer give good shade. However, the lower bank is often marshy and rocky, due to flooding, and is therefore not too suitable for a village location. The Site In 1959, the site material occurred along the road and ended just beyond the small air strip which was located to the north of the truck trail and a main gravelled road. How ever, upon returning to the site in the summer of 1960, it was found that much of the winding truck trail had been replaced by a 60 foot wide fire break which had been bulldozed to a depth of several inches below the tall grass which normally covered the field. A swath had been cut through the grassed area which comprised the large flat to the north of the trail. This bulldozing had completely re moved all the loose material which had for merly been in the road section. Even in the parts of the road which remained, there was little evidence of site material. Presumably, this was due to rain action during the inter vening period. It was also difficult to find material by test ing in the cleared field. Therefore, it must be assumed that the material was spread very thinly over the area, despite the extent of the occupation. The previously found material probably represented a concentration and accumulation of material which was original ly more widespread. Despite considerable testing, it was not possible to establish any particular area as the center of the habita tion. One may suppose then that an irregular pattern of dwellings was arranged periodi cally in this location. To locate such a dif fuse area of occupation would have required more time and manpower than was available. Excavation Since both sufficient time and heavy equip ment were lacking, a survey of the fire break was made to ascertain a center of occupation. This proved fruitless due to the shallowness of the site. Such material as had existed had been piled in ridges along the south side of the road by the bulldozer. Very little lithic debris was apparent except for porphoritic rhyolite boulders which were either parts of hearths, tipi rings, or in many cases, un differentiated pounding and mulling tools. Several concentrations of these boulders still remained in the fire break. It was decided to expose these more fully to determine whether any pattern could be discovered in their arrangement. Cultural Associations Several days were spent uncovering the river stone feature subsequently described. During the course of this excavation, only 5 items were found among the boulders. These consisted of 2 pieces of quartzite,one of which showed percussion flaking, a small harness buckle, a "minnie" ball, and a . 30 caliber bullet.(Fig. 21 (6). It is not possible because of the shallowness of the site and the previous bulldozing to say whether these items were definitely associated with the feature in which they were found. Rock Feature As indicated by the accompanying photo graphs and plan, the feature consisted of a single layer of river rock formed in an ir regular pattern. This pattern vaguely sug gests an anthropomorphic form which had been previously disturbed. On the other hand, this may be an erroneous interpretation. To wards the center of the area,the stone stratum thickened and more than a single layer was found. In the center of the concentration, as the profile indicates, there was a stone-filled depression. The rock in this immediate area was darkened and oxidized by firing. It is as sumed the depression represented a hearth.</page><page sequence="18">147 It should be noted that around the outside of the stone concentration, there is an irregular pattern of widely spaced stones. This is similar to the plan later excavated at the Archery Range site, CM-41. Since the outside dimensions of the area are 10x13 feet and the general appearance is similar, it may be that the stone concentrations repre sent the interior area of a structure having a central hearth. In this case, the outside stones might be bases or supports near wall posts and the remaining stones part of a floor arrangement. On the other hand, they might be simply a result of the accumulative pulling of hearth stones from the fire over a long period. In any event, the stone concentrations such as these are man-made. They occur with sufficient frequency to suggest a cul tural trait. Their exact function remains to be determined by the uncovering of additional examples which are less disturbed. ARCHERY RANGE SITE, CM-41 Background This site, found during the 1959 survey by the discovery of shell, flint chips, and bone working out of a very eroded truck trail, is located southwest of Hands Hill on a second terrace opposite Medicine Bluffs. A child's femur was also found nearby at a depth of several feet in the profile of a sub terranean tank park less than 100 feet to the southwest of the site. Location The site extends along a small tributary on the north bank of Medicine Creek about op posite Medicine Bluff #2. In terms of the topography of the north bank, the site lies a few hundred feet to the southwest of Hands Hill, the dominating feature of the terrain. The ground slopes rapidly away from Hands Hill forming a relatively flat area at its base to the south. A slight tilt to the southwest connects this area with a small, well-wooded drainage which flows into Medicine Creek. There is surface evidence of occupation on both banks of the drainage just outside the wooded area. The west bank on which the site is located is now back from the dry drainage about 50 feet and at a point about 1/4 of a mile north of Medicine Creek. The Site Upon return to the site in 1960, it was found to be heavily overgrown. At this time, there was little material on the surface due, no doubt, to rains which had washed the ground clean during the interval. Again, as at the Medicine Creek Flat site, little debris was found within the area excavation. The latter centered in the middle of the truck trail at a point where the material of the previous spring had been collected from the surface. (Shaeffer 1960b: 103). Cultural Association Several days were spent at this site in un covering the stone concentration. During this time, a few items were found deposited among the top stones. However, these were limited to 2 items of White culture, a coil of bailing wire, and a rusted metal fragment. In addition, a dozen or so pieces of charcoal were recovered. Rock Feature As indicated on the accompanying plan (Fig. 23A)the dimensions of the rock concentration of river boulders was approximately 13 by 18 feet. In form it was somewhat similar to the feature uncovered at Medicine Creek Flat. However, the feature at this site differed mainly in the absence of a central depression. Instead, 2 or more layers of stone were concentrated in the 4 areas indicated on the plan. Again an intermittent and widely spaced perimeter of stones was found within a foot or two of the stone concentration. The purpose of this stone boulder feature remains enigmatic. Due to the lack of cultural associ ation and the fact that both areas are used for maneuvers, it may be that despite the Indian material in the immediate vicinity on the surface, the rock features described may be elements of white rather than Indian cul ture. This is a point which requires further clarification. MEDICINE BLUFF FIVE SITE, CM-45 Background When this site was located during the 1959 survey and was found to cover a large area with an extensive distribution of material showing on the surface, it was thought to be a Plains campsite. (Shaeffer 1960b: 104). However, it was recognized at the time that excavation would be difficult not only because of the shallowness of the site, but because of the unusual amount of disturbance caused by troops who had repeatedly bivouaced in the area, leaving behind such mementos as unfilled latrines, foxholes, and other entrench ments.</page><page sequence="19">148 0 ^ Q O CS^ kattucb man J I I U., Q_ Fig. 23, A - Stone Pattern, Archery Range Site, Cm-41 h * \J noli &lt;Q0Q A* " ^ . r-^ * A ' T 0 " * &lt;? .?... ? Fig. 23, B - Stone Circle, Medicine Bluff Site, Cm-45</page><page sequence="20">149 Location The site is located on the south bank of Medicine Creek just northwest of the end of the Medicine Bluffs, the most prominent ter rain feature of this part of the reservation. Medicine Bluff #5 lies just behind the camp area. From these residual bluffs, the ground slopes rapidly towards the north. The site is located at a point where the slope becomes less acute and the woods are somewhat thin ner than on the higher ground above. In extent the occupation area is perhaps 100 feet north to south and 200 feet east to west. Be yond the area of occupation there is a drop to the first terrace of Medicine Creek which lies about 1/4 of a mile to the north. The Site Occupational debris lies scattered on a bad ly eroded slope. Though this material is quite apparent on open eroded spots, it is also evident that the site is quite shallow.lt seems therefore that erosion has concentrated the scattered material from the higher ground above the eroded areas. The site lies be tween 2 local drainages which are about 300 feet apart. These mark the east-west boundaries of the site. Though there are a number of stones lying about which suggest the remains of hearths and structure, most of these features are in a very poor state of preservation. However, several better pre served features lie on small hillocks border ing the drainage on the west edge of the site. House Pattern The house ring indicated on the plan (Fig. 23B)is approximately 30 feet in diameter. It was in a very good state of preservation ex cept for the floor area. This was not com pacted and could not be followed. Only one bona fide post hole was found. This occurred near the entrance which was presumably the break in the ring opening to the west. Off to one side and within the circle was a concentration of flat rocks which could have been the house hearth, though it consisted of a single to double layer of rock without any depression. In passing, it might be noted that this type of hearth is quite common es pecially in the eastern section of the reserva tion whereas the boulder type described for the Archery Range and Medicine Creek Flat sites is less commonly seen exposed in the east. Outside the ring there was another rock concentration similar to that on the inside of the circle. It might be that these 2 features were not contemporaneous with the house ring, but were of later construction . Part of a similar ring was located about 20 feet away to the northeast on another small hillock which partially was washed away. This feature was too eroded for excavation. Site Material Unfortunately, no associated artifacts were found within the house ring or on the outside within the immediate vicinity due to the slope of ground in all directions, but a number of points and point fragments were found on the site. The nearest finds were located by test pitting at the edge of the nearby truck trail about 50 feet to the southeast. Here several small side-notched points of the Washita focus were found as well as those of the Fresno type and a small quartz end scraper. Lithic chips are of the following types: quartzite, basalt, flint Types 5, 6, 9, 10, 17, 18, 19, 22, and 28. One copper carbine shell was found bearing the mark S.A.E. and the number 79 (for 1879?) along the rim. TEMPORAL AND CULTURAL RELATIONS Pig Farm Crossing Site, CM-26 At the present time, it is difficult to place this site culturally. While there are many characteristics held in common between this site and those of the nearby Washita River complex to the north, the Pig Farm Crossing site appears to represent a differing tradition despite superficial resemblances. The site location is much closer to the stream than is common in sites of the Washita River focus; it lacks the characteristic de bris of the later type of site. Also missing are the numerous circular storage and refuse pits, as well as evidence of square or rec tangular dwellings. In the artifact assem blage the main lack is the great range and abundance of buffalo bone tools always pre sent on Washita River sites. Especially lack ing is the characteristic scapula hoe; and this, despite a fairly heavy occurrence of buffalo bone at the site. Another marked and major absence is cordmarked pottery. Minor absences are pottery discs, figurine remains, house wattle, and an abundance of flint side scrapers. In fact, chipped debris is relative ly rare. On the positive side, common characteris tics with the Washita River focus are the considerable amount of buffalo bone and mus sel shell food remains, a similar range of scraper forms, and roughly similar range of projectile point types.</page><page sequence="21">150 There are some distinctive traits which appear at the site which cannot be specific ally tied in distributionally at the present time, though one might suspect the general direction of their sources. For instance, the beveled trapezoidal knife is identical in form and material (Alibates flint) to one excavated at the Optima focus of the Oklahoma Pan handle (Watson 1950: 4). It is possible that the thin, 2 sided manos and the basally re touched Washita River type of point are simi lar in form and material to some found on Medicine Creek and at the Carter site, BK-6; the serrated type of Fresno point, and mica pottery temper are also from a northwestern or southwestern direction. On the other hand, the adze (or single-bitted axe) might, on the basis of material, come from a more easter ly source. Certainly punctate-decorated and shell-leached pottery is more at home in eastern Oklahoma. In short, none of the site's distinctive traits can be tied in speci fically to other sources outside of the area though they are obviously intrusive in form, material, and numbers. On the other hand, the site's major com plex traits of architecture, pottery, and bone tools do not tie into those of the nearby Washita River complex, even in a generalized way. In view of the very well defined traits of the Washita River focus, and the fact that these are lacking at this site, it must be assumed, especially with the absence of cord marked pottery, that either a time difference, a culture-tradition difference, or both is involved. If, at some other site of this type, a few cordmarked sherds of the Stafford variety show up, then we may establish a contemporaneity which the evidence at this site refutes. In either case, the basic dif ferences of architecture, pottery, and tool type would remain. So the choice is whether the differences are to be explained on the basis of time and a changing Washita River culture, or differing tradition entering the region. In view of the very few sites having cordmarked pottery on them (we found only one out of 123 sites in our Ft. Sill survey, (Shaeffer 1960b) the hypothesis of gradual change has no supporting evidence locally. Therefore, we are left with the conclusion that a different cultural tradition is involved despite some superficial similarities, most of an ecological sort. The other question which remains is whether the Washita River focus and this Upper Red River focus were contemporary. While, as it has been indicated, the lack of intrusive Lindsay cordmarked pot tery suggests that they were not, still this is only the first site of this type reported on and further excavation may change the picture. However, for the present and on the basis of this single site, this Upper Red River focus appears to have entered the Wichita Mountain area via East Cache Creek at a later period. In view of the above reasoning, the recon struction which is postulated is that the Pig Farm Crossing site represents a slightly later time period than sites of the Washita River focus and a cultural affiliation basi cally eastern with some southwestern con nections as opposed to the basically northerly and western affiliations of the Washita River focus. Whether this places the Pig Farm Crossing site at the beginning of the historic 18th century Wichita occupation of the Ft. Sill area is doubtful. It would seem more likely that this might represent an earlier 16th to 18th century Caddoan occupation. This reconstruction is, however, mere sup position. Considerably more fieldwork needs to be done in building up a better inventory of traits than now exists in the Oklahoma and Texas literature of the Red River Valley archaeology. Borrow Pit Site CM-27 While this site is located within a few miles of the previous site at Pig Farm Crossing, it is not closely related culturally. This site differs from the latter in the following respects. At this site, no bison bone was present, either as a tool material or as food remains. Deer was the principle source of animal bone. Mussel shell was more abundant than, at the other site, as were manos and handstones, while cordmarked pottery rather than plainware predominated. Wattle was also present, suggesting the usual wattle, daub, and thatch structure of the north which was rec tangular in shape. Except for the lack of bison bone, the above traits suggest affinities with the central Plains type of culture to the north, especially that of the Custer focus. The chief differences are the absence of such items as chipped tools. From the above, it would appear, even from the minimal material obtained by this salvage operation, that the Borrow Pit and Pig Farm Crossing sites represent cultur ally differing traditions. The latter as pre viously indicated, on the basis of its pottery and architecture, is probably eastern in origin and of a late date. The affiliations of the Borrow Pit site present a greater prob lem, not simply because of the inadequacy of the sample, but because of the difficulties arising from the definition of the Custer and Washita focii as they have been developed the past few years through +he addition of re ported sites. In this writer's view, the</page><page sequence="22">151 problem, instead of becoming clarified, has become increasingly obscure. We now have 11 reported sites ascribed to these manifestations, the sole common de nominator being cordmarked pottery of var ious sorts. For the present, these sites can not be seriated on any one basis without creat ing interpretive problems when the seried sites are considered as a whole. For exam ple, in the present case, the Borrow Pit site, despite its otherwise Southern Plains Aspect characteristics, lacks any indication, even fragmentary, of bison bone. One might ex plain this situation as caused by the disturbed condition of the borrow pit due to machine operations were it not for the fact that this negative aspect of cultural inventory is dupli cated at the Van Schuyver site (Sharrock 1959: 34-40) in Pottowatomie County, over 100 miles to the northeast. At this latter site, mussel shell food remains also were abundant, as they were at the Borrow Pit site. These sites were also similar in most respects, except for tempering in the pottery which appears to differ at the 2 locations. It is not the purpose of this discussion to analyze the larger problems involved, but merely to point out that the Borrow Pit paral lels a site previously described but so far re moved from it geographically that, in the present state of our investigations, the simi larities are difficult to explain in terms of the existing taxonomy. In regard to the taxonomy, either the time-scale which has been alloted for the development of the Custer and Washita focii is too conservative or the taxonomic framework is too simpli fied to accommodate all the variations in the pattern which are (jeveloping. In short, the difficulties surrounding the taxonomic assignment of these sites in the Ft. Sill area reveal a need for reconsideration of the previous definitions of the Southern Plains focii and for additional thought to be given to the general problem of Plains-Cad doan relationships in Central Oklahoma. Boundary Site, CM-28 The main characteristic of the tool assem blage from this site is the crudity of the workmanship. While there are a number of handstones of hard pink porphoritic rhyolite, there are no soft sandstone manos of the type found at the Pig Farm Crossing and Borrow Pit sites. The tools from this site are more amorphous in form, and grinding planes are less pronounced. These are multi-purpose tools battered by use as pounders and hammer stones. The only projectile point is a base of the Gary dart type and a fragment of a very early type knife found at the Nail site (Baker, et_al_ 1957) in the Oklahoma Panhandle and on middle phase sites of the Lawton Aspect. The one end-scraperfound has steep sides in the Lawton Aspect tradition but as indicated by its small size, is of a later type. Altogether, this assemblage is not com parable with others in the literature. The only clue we have to its temporal position, aside from the fact that it is earlier than the 2 previously-described sites because it lacks pottery, is the distinguishable type of material from which the dart point is fashioned. This is a dark, basalt-like flint with very prominent reddish sandstone in clusions. In the 1959 survey, this was designated as Stone Type 27. Its occurrence was limited to Site 69 on Blue Beaver Creek and to Site 83 on West Cache Creek. All these sites including the Boundary site are located in the central part of the reserva tion. At the other 2 sites small darts were also the characteristic projectile point types. It was mainly on the basis of the dart distribution at Sites 69 and 83 that both were assigned to Phase 2 (11-1200 A.D.) and Phase 3 (12-1300 A. D.). This is the period when the small dart point was coming into the Wichita Mountain area in Phase 2 and when it was just beginning to be supplanted by the bow in Phase 3. Thus though the evidence is thin, still it is dis tinctive. Since the combination of point type and tool material is repeated on other near by sites, it would indicate that the Boundary site is contemporaneous with them and should be assigned to the same temporal position between 11-1300 A.D. Medicine Creek Flat Site, CM-118 Despite the fact that no cultural associations were found in 1959 during the course of ex cavating the stone structure, on the basis of material collected during the 1959 survey from this site, a temporal position is assign able . Based mainly on the fact that dart point types are absent from this site and that the Fresno type of simple triangular point is characteristically present, the main occupa tion of the site was assigned to Phase 3 (guess dates 12-1300 A.D.) and Phase 4 (guess dates 13-1500 A.D.). In addition, there was a scattering of material from several historic phases. The unresolved question is whether the stone structure is associated with the pre historic or the historic phases. This, of course, is not determinable on the basis of cultural associations found as the result of</page><page sequence="23">152 excavation. This important point therefore remains to be answered by further excavation at other points on the reservation. Archery Range Site, CM-41 At both this site and the Medicine Creek Flat site we find the same situation - a combination of historic and prehistoric materials, a dearth of associated cultural materials, and an in ability to determine definitely to what phase the structures should be assigned. The struc tures at both sites are comparable in size and in the occurrence of possible post molds around the peripheries of the stone concen trations. The only marked differences are the definite fire-pit present at Medicine Creek and its absence at the Archery Range as well as the occurrence of possible post bases in the corners of the Archery Range structure and their absence at the Medicine Creek site. On the basis of the original surface survey, the following material was recovered from the Archery Range site: Glass, Type 2 (1), fragment of child's femur (1), Flint Type 25 (2), quartzite (1), and shell (10). The only other site where this particular flint type occurs is at the Medicine Creek Flat site where all chips found were of this type. Since, in addition, the only items found at the Archery Range site during excavation above the stones and within a few inches of the sur face were a coil of bailing wire and some metal (possibly can) fragments, it would seem possible that both structures were of the historic period, either Phase 7, the early reservation period of Plains tribe occupancy (1880-1895) or the later Phase 8 period (1895-1917) representing occupancy by the Chiricahua Apache prisoners-of-war. At the Archery Range site, material of the historic period in the excavation suggests that the focus of the prehistoric occupancy remains to be located. The present inclination, there fore, is to regard both structures as intru sive in what otherwise are prehistoric sites and to assign them to the historic period leaving in abeyance the matter of the origi nators -whether they were Plains tribes, southeastern Apaches, or white, either civi lian or military. Medicine Bluff Site CM-45 Despite the obvious use of this area for military bivouac, almost no European ma terial was recovered during the earlier sur vey of this site. In general, the material was quite consistent- a Fresno type point and fragment of other small points, a small end scraper, several manos or handstones of porphoritic rhyolite and a Type 13 flint,which also occurs on other small point sites. On the basis of the above characteristics the site was assigned at the time of survey to Phase 4 (guess date 12-1500 A.D.). The presence of the circular structure ex cavated at this site does present a problem as to whether it was intrusive (i. e., historic) in the prehistoric occupancy. This is sug gested by the rest of the cultural inventory. Pottery, for example, was not found at this site, though it should be found in time. Another absence was buffalo bone. But then no bone fragments of any kind were seen on the sur face, due probably to the shallowness of the site and its location on a badly eroded slope. On the other hand, a parallel between this site and, say, the Pig Farm Crossing site is the absence of quartzite on both sites even though it is very common in both areas on nearby sites. The connection with the latter site is seen further in the fact that at the time of the survey, stone rings were noted at the Medicine Bluff site, but no circular house plan was visible at the Pig Farm Cros sing site. Yet on the basis of the cultural inventory, both were assigned to the same Phase 4 (guess dates 13-1500 A.D.). The uncovering of a circular house plan at the Pig Farm Crossing site, albeit much larger, does seem to strengthen this original prog nosis. Therefore, it is felt that this site is in the same tradition as the Pig Farm Crossing site, though possibly somewhat earlier, and that both represent, at least in terms of non structural inventory, the Caddoan or Wichita occupancy. However, as regards the circular house plan, this conclusion can only be tenta tively applied because the known early his toric occupancy of the region by the Co manche has yet to be archaeologically defined. CONCLUSIONS Using the phase outline which was developed to tentatively organize the results of the 1959 survey, a summary of the present excavations show that they covered Phase 2(11-1200 A. D.) and Phase 3 (12-1300 A. D.) at the Boundary site; Phase 3 and 4 (13-1500 A. D.) at the Medicine Creek Flat site; Phase 4 at the Pig Farm Crossing and Medicine Bluff. 5 sites; and Phase 7 (1880-1895 A.D.) and Phase 8 (1895-1917) at the Archery Range and Medi cine Flat sites; that new phases have been added to the chronology; and the Phase 5 - Phase 6 (15-1870; 1870-1880 A.D.) "gap" which existed in the original chronology still remains.</page><page sequence="24">153 While it would be profitable to review this latter problem in detail, it would require such a lengthy re-analysis of both the 1959 survey material and the 1960 excavations that it could not be included here. Suffice it to say for the purposes of this paper, that it now appears likely, that the "missing" Phases 5 and 6 undoubtedly result from the incorpora tion under Phases 4, and possibly 7, of material from an intermediate time period. It is now felt, in light of the excavations, that material designated under Phase 4, is Caddoan but that more time was involved in this de velopment than has been assigned heretofore. Possibly a cordmarked phase precedes Phase 3, or is contemporary with it. Most of the Caddoan material may fall within the 14-1600 A. D. period. The difficulty which besets any such interpretation of chipped tools arises from their occurrence on so many sites de spite the fact that the literature does not re cord such material for the early contact period. Were the Wichitas using flint tools and weapons in the 16th and 17th centuries, or were they using them as late as the middle 19th century? The historical record does not answer either question definitely. The only point which does seem clear is that the reservation appears to be divided into 2 fairly definite east-west complexes. There is the East Cache Creek-Medicine Creek area of sites characterized by the oc currence of shell, small points, hematite, occasional pottery, and dominance of non local flint as a tool material. In the western portion of the reservation, the Blue Beaver Crater-West Cache-Post Oak Creek area is characterized by the absence of shell and pot tery and the presence of large projectile points, the common use of quartz, quartzites, and local river-source flints. It might be added, and this is merely suggested as an alternative hypothesis, that the western com plex beginning in Phase 3, represents the Comanche occupation and that the eastern complex may be Wichita. Now, of course, there is some overlapping of these sites in both areas; and in the east, the occurrence of the western type site might, under this hy pothesis, be assumed to be later and to represent the "missing" sites of Phase 5 and 6. However, this would imply that the Comanche occupation could be traced to an earlier period since the type of, western and central Oklahoma tool material seems to grade into Phase 2, which is material related to the Lawton Aspect. While the historical record is not clear on the point as to the precedence of the 2 tribes, it is clear that both occupied the region at the time of con tact and subsequently. The question remaining to be answered is how far back does this symbiotic pattern of ecological exploitation of the Wichita Mountain area go? Considerable work will have to be done in the Ft. Sill area, and some C 14 dates obtained to test the relative age of the western and eastern complexes in order to determine whether they represent successive or contemporaneous developments. It might be wise to point out that we are now just beginning to define the content of the phases in the Ft. Sill chronology. The recognition of this latter problem would seem to be the most important result of the present investi gations. Baker,Wm. E., T.
