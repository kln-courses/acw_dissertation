<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS The book has 73 photographic illustrations on 32 plates. The author includes a chronological table at the beginning of his book. In this one notices that he includes the whole of the 11th Dynasty in the First Intermediate Period. Many scholars, if they do not place the 11th Dynasty as a whole in the Middle Kingdom, as some do, at least consider King Neb-hepet-Re' Montu-hotpe as ushering in that great period. Wilson's own treatment of Montu-hotpe in his Chapter VI does not seem opposed to the latter view. In the same table Wilson does not admit the first five kings of the 18th Dynasty into his Empire Period (or New Kingdom). For him this only begins with Amun-botpe II. The reviewer finds it difficult to consider A'b-mose I, Amun-hotpe I and the first three Thut-moses as belonging in the Second Intermediate Period. It is a question when "empire" was attained. On this there could well be divergent views and Wilson could make a strong argument for his position. Perhaps the doubt on this point is an argument for using the term New Kingdom instead, and including in it the whole of the 18th Dynasty. The chapters of the book follow a chronological order. Chapter I deals with Geology and Topography, Chapter II with Prehistory, Chapter III with the earliest dynasties. Then follow chapters on the periods into which Egyptian history has been divided by modern historians: the Old Kingdom, First Intermediate Period, Middle Kingdom, Second Intermediate Period, the 18th Dynasty through Amun-hotpe III, the latter part of the 18th Dynasty, including the religious revolution of Akh-en-Aton and its collapse after his death and a chapter on the 19th and 20th Dynasties. There is a final chapter on the decline of Egypt through the Late Dynastic Period showing that some of the seeds of this decline were sown as early as the end of the 18th Dynasty. The work is philosophical in its approach. Much of the detailed recital of facts found in histories is omitted as being foreign to the author's purpose. However one feels that some data of importance have been slighted, such, for example, as the very large semitic element in the Egyptian language, both word-stems and grammatical features. The careful documentation referred to above permits the reader to evaluate the author's conclusions. Some are perhaps controversial and may not be universally accepted but the work as a whole is of high value and authority as an interpretation of ancient Egyptian culture. LUDLOW BULL The Birth of the Bible: a new approach, by Immanuel Lewy. New York: Bloch Publ. Co., 1950. Pp. 250, indexes. $3.50. The delayed appearance of this review is entirely the reviewer's fault, and the reviewer takes this opportunity to apologize to the author. Yet the reviewer had hoped that during the delay the author would publish evidence to support his startling thesis. None has been forthcoming, nor has it been adequately presented in the volume being reviewed. At the opening of his volume the author states that he has examined the contributions of modern biblical scholarship but has rejected them. Perhaps he omits 121</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE the evidence because, as he says, "my interest is not to write a scholarly book which would be understandable to a few experts only" (p. 8). The reviewer believes that it is not good procedure to present a popular treatment before having the evidence carefully examined by objective scholarship. After recognizing that Moses could not have written the Pentateuch, Dr. Lewy seeks to discover the person who is responsible for the basic document of the Pentateuch and of the Books of Samuel. Identifying Nathan with Jonathan of I Chron 27 32, the author develops the thesis that Nathan is the key literary genius of the early monarchical period. He was the author of Proto-Samuel, of Proto-Pentateuch, of Balaam's prophecies, of the Ten Commandments, and of the book of Ruth. He re-shaped the ten Prohibitions of Moses, "old draconic laws of a cruder age," into the Decalog "re-adapted... to the needs of a more enlightened age." Lewy says, "they became a classical document because they were written by Israel's greatest literary and ethical genius" (p. 66). Nathan wrote his first book, the Pentateuchal stories, in the years 980-973 for his pupil Solomon, when Nathan was 40-47 years old. His second book, the story of Saul and David, was written 972-970, at the age of 48-51 (p. 147), and his source material was drawn from the wives of David (p. 197). In the chapter entitled "Predecessors and Successors" Lewy identifies Samuel as the codifier of the old laws of Israel. Nathan then completed the work with his "Ethical Code." In turn the work of Nathan was amended by the prophetic guild under the leadership of Elisha and (?) the Northern Elohist (p. 210). About the same time the priest-ruler Jehoiada commented on the same document in the South. Thus we have the E and the J documents. The Deuteronomic Code came to Jerusalem after the fall of Samaria (p. 211). The Priestly Code came into the Pentateuch at the time of Josiah's reform. The author states that he sees the completion of the Pentateuch in about 400 years, not as a process of 1,000 years as modern critics insist. Dr. Lewy lists five psychological objections which he believes will be made to his theory. The chief objections are quite different and not as simple as the author would believe. First, the author has created a literary genius of the tenth century B.C. who is: an absolute monotheist, a pacifist, a "psychological realist," a teacher of wisdom to Solomon, a democrat, and a man who believed that God was "cosmic power" which was neither anthropomorphic nor a miracle-worker. Second, the author has been inconsistent in his own theory. While insisting that Nathan produced the "Proto-Pentateuch" he also talks of priests correcting the record in the light of already existing stories (p. 239). Third, he does not give adequate linguistic support to the substitution of his own theory for the generally accepted literary analysis of the Pentateuch. Dr. Lewy has challenged the long established positions of modern biblical scholar- ship. His book will call attention to two important matters. First, recognition having been given to Nathan, it is probable that greater appreciation will generally be held for this important historical figure. Second, this book is one of several written recently which insist that Israel, as well as Judah, made a significant contribution to the development of Hebrew religion. WALTER G.
