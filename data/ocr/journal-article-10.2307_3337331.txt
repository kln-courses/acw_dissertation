Included in this mandate are archi- tecture, arts of personal adornment, contemporary fine and popu- lar arts, and arts of the African diaspora. In addition the journal encourages dialogue on other forms of African expressive cul- ture: film, theater, dance, and music. Cover: Fabric coffin (niombo). Sundi-Kongo, Central Afri- ca, early 20th century, 180cm (70.9"). Etnografiska Museet, Gothenburg, 1938.27.1. This larger-than-life-size niombo was part of the africa95 exhibition 'The Art of African Textiles: Technology, Tradition and Lurex" at London's Barbican Art Gallery (reviewed on p. 73). The substructure is covered with tautly stretched import- ed red blankets, which the Kongo people associated with power and chieftaincy. Like other artworks in the Barbican exhibition, this towering sculpture represents an innovative approach to textiles that can be found throughout the conti- nent of Africa.
