<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Maladjusted Messenger: Rezeptionsdsthetik in Translation1 EUGENE EOYANG Indiana University In my essay, "Translation as Excommunication," which explored the ontological, phenomenological, and generic aspects of translation, I quoted Wolfgang Iser's comments about "the structure of the text" which "sets off a sequence of mental images which lead to the text translating itself into the reader's consciousness." I suggested that, because "the translator is a reader of an original, as well as the author of the translation," he "provides invaluable testimony.., on reader response, for he is an implied reader..." with the advantage that, unlike other implied readers, he was explicit, and provided tangible evidence of how he read the original.2 I argued that with the focus on the translator and his translation, there is accessible documentation on the reading of an entire text, where there is a possibility of examining every constituent in the whole. This comprehensive attention is necessary, because a prime factor in reader-response criticism is the "reader's role as a textual structure, and the reader's role as a structured act." Structure may be adduced in fragments and excerpts, but the objective consideration of structure must take in the whole, even when selected structural elements are adduced. In short, translation provides at least one reader's complete "reader's response" (Eoyang, p. 64).3 The present study is an exploration of the methodological perspectives suggested in those remarks, illustrating through an analysis of three examples of renderings from the Chinese the way translations and adaptations provide insights not only into the original and into the process of translation, but also into the "horizon of expectations" of each translator-reader-interpreter. The translation becomes a pivotal text, which comments on and interprets the original, and which in turn is commented upon and interpreted by the reader of the translation. The reader with access to both the original and the translator becomes, in fact, two readers: the interpreter of the original and the interpreter of the translation. Unlike the reader innocent of the original, however, the dual-perspective reader, i.e., one with access to both the language of the original and the language of the translation, interprets the translation not only by comparing it with an imagined original, he must also take into account his own interpretation of the 'Paper presented at the second Sino-American Symposium on Comparative Literature, October-November 1987, at Princeton University, Indiana University, and Stanford University. 2ISer, of course, reminds us that "the implied reader" has "his roots firmly planted in the structure of the text; he is a construct and in no way to be identified with any real reader" (Iser, p. 34). But surely a translator is a special case; he is an actual reader, and as the agent of meaning, a creator of the text structure in the target language, an implied (if often unacknowledged) author. 31 am, of course, not the first to notice the fruitfulness of examining translations from the perspective of reader-response theory. Andr6 Lefevere has written: "Translation seems.. to be an almost foolproof basis for the study of reception aesthetics" (in Rose, 1981, 58). 61</page><page sequence="2">62 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 10 (1988) original, which may differ significantly from the translator's. One might consider the reading of a translation by a dual-perspective reader, therefore, to be a specially interesting case of "intertextuality"-what might be called "concurrent textuality": the dual-language reader, consciously or not, subsumes a specific original in his reading of the translation, even as he might (though less obviously) be susceptible to the influences of a translation when returning to the original text. We take as our first instance James Legge's translation of the Analects, traditionally attributed to Confucius. Raised in Scotland, educated at King's College, Aberdeen, a staunch Presbyterian, Legge (1815-1897) traveled first to the London Missionary School in Malacca in 1839 where he became principal of the Anglo-Chinese College in 1840; later, he was instrumental in converting the Anglo-Chinese College into a Theological Seminary and arranging for its removal to Hong Kong in 1843. Legge translated many classics of Chinese literature and philosophy, including the "Four Books"-the Analects (Lun-yu j ); the Doctrine of the Mean (Zhong-yung rqz ); the Great Learning (Da Xue )&lt; ); and the Mencius (Meng-zi f- )-over a period of 56 years, from 1841 to 1897. His translations, which appeared in F. Max Miuller's familiar Sacred Books of the East series, were decisive in establishing for two generations of English-speaking readers a particular view not only of the Lun-yu, of Confucius, of ancient Chinese philosophy, but also of Chinese culture in general. Legge's version of the Lun-yu was first published under the title Confucian Analecta in 1861 (DNB, pp. 959-60). The publication of a translation of a Chinese classic under a Latin title in the nineteenth century was hardly unusual: works of learning or of science with some intellectual aspirations appeared either in Latin, or with a Latin title-the practice is a long-standing one: Newton's Principia, Leibniz's Novissima Sinica in the seventeenth century, Russell's Principia Mathematica and Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus in the twentieth century are but the most famous examples. Yet, familiar as "The Analects" has become as a translation of the Lun-yu, it gives a misleading impression of both the title and the text in Chinese. First, "analects" is a far less familiar and accessible word in English than "lun-yu" is in Chinese, which could be (and has been on occasion) rendered informally as "Sayings" or "Conversa- tions."4 On the surface, the word "analects" appears semantically accurate as a description of the contents of the Lun-yu: it refers to "the extracts from the classical authors."5 Yet, even in the nineteenth century, the "analects" sounded arcane and esoteric, in a way that Lun-yu in Chinese never has. This excursus on the onomastics of titles is directly relevant to the way Legge read the Lun-yu: he saw it as a classic in the Chinese tradition, and hence treated it in translation as if it were a classic in the Western tradition, adorning it with an aura of classical learning. Certainly, there can be no fault to be found in this strategy. Still, deferential as it is, there is something awry in conceiving of the Lun-yii as "The Analects." If one goes to the Lun-yu with "the horizon of expectations" redolent of Plato's Dialogues and Descartes' Discourse on Method and latinate learning in general, 4"Discourse" might also be suitable, since it denotes oral exchanges of a serious intellectual bent; "dialogues" might be even more appropriate, suggesting as it does philosophical conversations-although both words now carry strong connotations of structured and systematic argumentation, traits not found in the Lun-yu. It would appear from the Glossarum mediae et infimae latinitatis, however, that the word was not used as a title in classical Greek, classical Latin, or medieval Latin.</page><page sequence="3">Eoyang, The Maladjusted Messenger: Rezeptionsasthetic in Translation 63 one is bound to be disappointed: there appears to be no coherence, no logical develop- ment, no reasoned presentation of a point of view. The Lun-yu is nothing so much as a collection of unprepossessing, if profoundly insightful anecdotes and intuitive remarks on various subjects, arranged in no particularly conspicuous order, and governed by no discernible coherence.6 But what is misgiuided about Legge's rendering of the Lun-yu as a "sacred book," as we shall see, is that it misleads the reader of the translation (as no doubt Legge was himself misled) into seeing the Chinese text as a pale reflection of a truly sacred text, a repository of divine wisdom. Legge did not fully appreciate Confucius' resolute and emphatic refusal to speculate about the divine, or about the hereafter: "The topics the Master did not speak of were prodigies, force, disorder and gods" (7:21; Lau, p. 88), and when a disciple asked about death, the Master rebuked him with this admonishment: "You do not understand even life. How can you understand death?" (11:12; Lau, p. 107) . The Lun-yu is, above all, secular, this-worldly. That is why a phrase such as 3:13, M k MP t , though rendered with literal accuracy by Legge as "He who offends against Heaven has none to whom he can pray," is, nevertheless, "systematically misleading" (to use Gilbert Ryle's phrase). The Western reader cannot avoid reading this injunction except as an invocation to devoutness, a call to belief in the Almighty. "Heaven" in the Christian world is inextricably bound up in concepts of the hereafter, the dwelling place of God. In rendering this passage in what Legge must have thought as a self-evident reference to an omnipotent God ("Heaven" here is clearly a metonymy for God the Father), he was no doubt paying tribute to the Chinese by assuming that Confucius was a devout and profound, if unprofessed and unwitting, Christian. But this interpretation, inevitable as it was with Legge, cannot be justified by either the context of the passage or what we know about the secular mindset of Confucius. The dictum is in answer to the following question by Wang-sun Chia: What is the meaning of the saying, "Is it better to pay court to the furnace than to the southwest corner?" This translated version appears cryptic, whereas in the Chinese it is merely allusive: Wing-tsit Chan's rendering supplies the context: "What is meant by the common saying, 'It is better to be on good terms with the God of the Kitchen [who cooks our food] than with the spirits of the shrine (ancestors) at the southwest corner of the house'?" Confucius said, "It is not true. He who commits a sin against Heaven has no god to pray to" (Chan, p. 25). The question posed asks which is to be preferred, the "kitchen-gods" or the "ancestor- gods." There is no presumed monotheism. Here, though Chan also capitalizes the word "Heaven," it refers not to a divine and otherworldly empyrean, nor even to the sky above, but generically to "the natural order of things."' In other words, "Heaven" 6This is the one sense that is captured by "analects," which in its root meaning suggests miscellaneity. 7Legge, in a footnote, cites Chu Hsi's interpretation of "Heaven" as principle: JFill)] . But he rejects this interpretation and sees principle as divine immanence: "But why should Heaven mean principle," Legge writes, "if there were not in such a use of the term an instinctive recognition of a supreme government of intelligence and righteousness?" (Legge, 1894, p. 159).</page><page sequence="4">64 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 10 (1988) is the right translation for "tian" y, but it invokes the wrong theology and posits the wrong cosmology. And one notes that Chan refers to "god" with the lower case, as one of many, not "God," as the one and only, the Almighty.8 It is not altogether a trivial linguistic detail that the original text leaves the object of worship unspecified: ~Wr~-f ,9 something which would be as theologically inconceivable as it would be grammatically awkward in most if not all Western languages.'0 Book 17, Chapter 19 of the Lun-yu offers the following exchange: The Master said, "I would prefer not speaking." Tsze-kung said, "If you, Master, do not speak, what shall we, your disciples, have to record?" The Master said, "Does Heaven speak? The four seasons pursue their courses, and all things are continually being produced, but does Heaven say anything?" (Legge, p. 326) From the context, the word "Heaven" refers to the natural world, to the phenomena of existence, to all creation. In the text, the words tian k , "heaven," sishi V41W "the four seasons," and baiwu W W "all creation" (literally, "the hundred things") are metonymies for the phenomena of nature. Confucius is saying no more than, like the phenomena of nature, he is mute and cannot put into words the mystery of being." Wing-tsit Chan makes the distinction explicit in his version: Confucius said, "I do not wish to say anything." Tzu-kung said, "If you do not say anything, what can we little disciples ever learn to pass on to others?" Confucius said, "Does Heaven (Nature) say anything? The four seasons run their course and all things are produced. Does Heaven say anything?" (Chan, p. 47). Legge's translation is accurate except for one crucial syntagmatic detail: the insertion of the negative conjunction "but" in "but does Heaven say anything?" This simple addition radically changes the cosmological context of the passage, for it implies that the seasons, all creation, are but the manifest workings of a divine intelligence, and that this intelligence is metonymically referred to as "Heaven." The question for Legge is not whether there is an explanation, but whether Heaven chooses to divulge its explanation. Read in this way, Confucius appears to be playing the august and omniscient sage, suggesting to Legge that he claims the right to be silent, even as the Creator chooses to remain silent before his creations. Legge reads tian "Heaven" as metonymy 8There can be no doubt that Legge believed that the Chinese knew "the true God": cf. his treatise, The Notions of the Chinese Concerning God and Spirits (Hong Kong, 1852), chapter 1. 9The translation of the concepts of divinity was at the heart of the "Rites Controversy" which involved the question whether Chinese converts to Christianity should be allowed to observe the Confucian rituals. The controversy ended in 1742, when Pope Benedict XIV condemned the Confucian and ancestral rites: see George Minamiki, The Chinese Rites Controversy. '0oH. G. Creel, in his article "Was Confucius Agnostic?" (T'oung Pao, 29[1932]:55-99), argues that Confucius, like the Hebrews of the Old Testament, felt that "ethics, politics, and the whole of life were inseparable from their cosmic and religious background" (99). There can be no disagreement that Confucius harbored a reverence for life and an appreciation of its mysteries, or that he was "religious"--if being religious means being humbled by all creation. But this sense of reverence does not, by itself, predicate the personal anthropomorphic God that Legge imagined. "This passage mirrors the philosophy of language and the epistemology inherent in the first lines of the Dao De Jing: "That which can be said is not the universal/everlasting word; that which can be named is not the universal/everlasting name": L ' S</page><page sequence="5">Eoyang, The Maladjusted Messenger: Rezeptionsisthetic in Translation 65 for the Creator than for (His) Creation. That this was Legge's reading can be seen in a footnote he added to the translation of this passage: "it is not easy to defend Confucius from the charge of presumption in comparing himself to Heaven" (Legge, 326). But Legge has forgotten that, as Confucius has not speculated on the divine, positing neither the existence nor the non-existence of the Almighty, there is no One on whom to presume, and no One with Whom to compare himself. Confucius was merely alluding to the generally recognized muteness of phenomenon; he was not arrogating for himself the status of a supreme being.1 Legge's view of Confucius is reminiscent of the "virtuous pagans" in the first circle of Dante's Inferno, who "were born without the light of Christ's revelation and... cannot come into the light of God...they are not tormented. Their only pain is that they have no hope" (Ciardi, p. 49). Yet there is a profound ambivalence in Legge's attitude toward the Confucian tradition: to the texts themselves, so common-sensical and rational, Legge is passionately impatient; to the commentaries, so often intuitive and mystical, Legge is positivistic and skeptical. On the Confucian texts themselves, and the comprehensive wisdom of Confucius, Legge is condescending: The reader will be prepared...not to expect to find any light thrown by Confucius on the great problems of the human condition and destiny. He did not speculate on the creation of things or the end of them. He was not troubled to account for the origin of men, nor did he seek to know about his hereafter. He meddled neither with physics nor metaphysics.... (Legge, p. 98) Legge shows his largesse and views Confucius with the same indulgence and pity that Dante felt for the denizens of Limbo: ... these were sinless. And still their merits fail, for they lacked Baptism's grace, which is the door of the true faith you were born to. Their birth fell before the age of the Christian mysteries, and so they did not worship God's Trinity in fullest duty. (Ciardi, pp. 50-51) Legge's compassion for Confucius reflects the magnanimity of nineteenth-century Christianity to the less fortunate, to the unbaptized: Confucius is not to be blamed for his silence on the subjects here indicated. His ignorance of them was to a great extent his misfortune. He had not learned them. No report of them had come to him by the ear; no vision of them by the eye. And to his practical mind the toiling of thought and uncertainties seemed worse than useless. (Legge, p. 98) Yet, as benighted as Legge saw Confucius to be, he was no more receptive to neo- Confucian commentaries which did "meddle... with metaphysics." He quotes Chu Hsi's exegesis of Confucius, and rather than being inspired by it, or finding that it satisfied 120One cannot agree with Creel in his assertion that "Legge recognizes that the Chinese declare T'ien and Shang Ti to be two names for the same entity, but he refuses to admit their testimony." Creel assumes that Tfen does refer to a supreme being, and that it occurs four times as often as its synonym, Ti or Shang-Ti; cf. "Was Confucius Agnostic?" (T'oung Pao 29[1929], p. 74-75).</page><page sequence="6">66 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 10 (1988) his penchant for "revelation," or being impressed by its efforts to answer questions relating to "the human condition and destiny," Legge is sarcastic and derisive: "Let the states of equilibrium and harmony exist in perfection, and a happy order will prevail throughout heaven and earth, and all things will be nourished and flourish." Here we pass into the sphere of mystery and mysticism. The language, according to Chu Hsi, "describes the meritorious achievements and the transforming influence of sage and spiritual men in their highest extent." From the path of duty, where we tread on solid ground, the writer suddenly raises us aloft on wings of air, and will carry us we know not where, and to we know not what. (Legge, p. 46) One wonders if the commentator were Matthew and not Chu Hsi, and instead of such phrases as "equilibrium and harmony," Legge had read "the peace that passeth all understanding," he would have been quite so unsympathetic and unresponsive. It would be churlish and unfair to dismiss Legge as a callous and uninformed interpreter of Chinese culture. He was, after all, someone who devoted his entire life to a disciplined and productive study of the Chinese classics, and his translations and commentaries still meet the highest standards of philological research. Nor was he entirely oblivious to the possibility of bias in his view of the Chinese, whose culture occupied him for so long, and whose people he had, no doubt, identified with in a period of nearly thirty years residence in China. Indeed, an inkling of this awareness can be seen in his coda to the Introduction to his translation of the Four Books: But I must now leave the sage. I hope I have not done him injustice; the more I have studied his character and opinions, the more highly have I come to regard him. He was a very great man, and his influence has been on the whole a great benefit to the Chinese, while his teachings suggest important lessons to ourselves who profess to belong to the school of Christ. (Legge, p. 111) It is not Legge's own bias, but the bias inherent in a fundamentally Christian outlook which he could not escape, nor see objectively, that infuses his intemperate and incon- sistent critiques of the Confucian canon.'13 He saw Confucius as a false prophet, a Messiah manque, whose practical wisdom was useful in developing moral character, but whose thought would be forever mired in unbaptized and unredeemed faithlessness. Our second text is one of the lyrics of Gustav Mahler's late song cycle, Das Lied von der Erde (The Song of the Earth), adapted out of free renderings from the Chinese published in 1907 by Hans Bethge under the title Die chinesische Fliote. The genealogy of these lyrics, which can be traced from Mahler to Bethge, from Bethge to the original Chinese, through various translations,'4 constitutes a fascinating "source-study," but 13Creel cites Legge's 1867 statement, "I am unable to regard him as a great man" alongside his revision in 1893, "He was a very great man..." and concludes that this revision reflects virtue on both Legge and Confucius: "These passages are a striking evidence of the greatness, not only of Confucius, but of Dr. Legge as well" (T'oung Pao 29[1932], 58). 14"Bethge was no sinologist and had no direct access to Chinese poetry, and the models he used for his sensitive poems were not the original texts but existing versions in German, English, and French"- Kurt Blaukopf, Gustav Mahler, translated by Inge Goodwin (New York: Praeger, 1973), p. 235.</page><page sequence="7">Eoyang, The Maladjusted Messenger: Rezeptionsdsthetic in Translation 67 rather than focus on questions of originality or generic integrity, we shall go beyond the variant strands that make up the composite whole, to identify and to reconstruct first Mahler's reading of Bethge, and through Bethge, his reading of the Tang poets. Let us look at Der Abschied (The Farewell), which Mahler attributes to "Mong-Koo Yen and Wang Wei" (presumably Meng Hao-ran  ?- and Wang Wei IE ). The lyric runs some 39 lines. Despite Mahler's attribution, no poem was jointly written by Wang Wei and Meng Haoran.15 Mahler's Der Abschied derives from two translations in Bethge's collection: "In Erwartung des Freundes," by "Mong-Kao-Jen" and "Der Abschied des Freundes," by "Wang-Wei" (see Appendix A). Some lines, those cited below, are interpolated into the text by Mahler. Die Blumen blassen im Dammerschein (The flowers pale in the twilight glow) Um im schlaf vergess'nes Glaick (And in sleep forgotten joy Und Jugend neu zu lernen! And youth to learn anew) Es wehet kiihl im Schatten meiner Fichten (It blows cool in the shade of my pines) Ich harre sein zum letzten Lebewohl (I tarry for him until the last farewell) O Schbnheit! O ewigen Liebens- Lebens- Trunk'ne Welt! (O Beauty! O everlasting Love- Life-besotted World!) Ich wandle nach der Heimat, meiner Statte. (I wander toward my country, my homestead) Still ist mein Herz und harret seiner Stunde! (My heart is still and waits its hour) Blaht auf im Lenz und grant aufs neu! (Blooms in the spring and is green again) Allaberall und ewig blauen licht die Fernen! (Ever wherever and forever colors the horizon lambently blue) The Wang Wei translation is roughly comparable to Wang Wei's "Songbie" 2iJ . But one searches in vain for a counterpart to Bethge's "In Erwartung des Freundes," purportedly by "Mong-Kao-Jen." It turns out that Bethge also conflated two poems, this time by the same poet: Meng Haoran's "At the Mountain-Lodge of Ye, the Buddhist Priest, Waiting for My Friend Ding, Who Never Comes" M U-t- TRI? and "In Summer at the South Pavilion, Thinking of Xing"  H I' J (see Appendix B). We should not pass over Mahler's conflation of the work of two poets without first noting that the practice is not common, nor is it entirely scrupulous. Western familiarity with Mahler's masterwork blinds audiences-as, no doubt, Mahler's intense romantic and listenable piece is intended to do-to the inherent license being exercised with literary texts. For a comparably outlandish example, one must imagine a Chinese composer conflating two lyrics on love, one by Shakespeare, and the other by Ben Jonson; or, to use specific poems on similar subjects, Coleridge's "Ode: On Dejection" and Keats' "Ode on Melancholy." What would be unthinkable with poets viewed and valued as individual artists is inevitable with figures only dimly perceived in garbled 1SSequences of "answering" poems between poets were, of course, common.</page><page sequence="8">68 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 10 (1988) translations. Parting is, of course, a recurrent theme in Tang poetry, and Mahler can't be faulted for composing an all-purpose parting poem. That he is able to do so reflects two conclusions: one, that the poets were, to his mind, so devoid of a discernible and particular personality that they could be combined without stylistic disruptions; and the second, that his purpose was not to convey the sense of a specific experience, rooted in time and culture, but rather to define the essence of leavetaking as a universal experience. The haunting effect of his music, and its popularity among concertgoers, would seem to suggest that he has succeeded in creating an accessible experience aspiring to universality. Yet, this success does not critically depend on the listener's sense of the individual Chinese poets who ultimately inspired Mahler's work: one leaves Das Lied von der Erde with no greater sense of who Meng Haoran or Wang Wei was than before, however attentive the reader of program notes and of record jacket copy might be. Before such achievements, it would be captious to insist on scholarly scrupulous- ness, for it is doubtful if a more esoterically faithful rendering would be musically superior. But to the extent that he is representative of Western culture, and Wang Wei and Meng Haoran typify the Tang poet, Mahler's transformations of the Chinese poets raise interesting questions in general about the artistic tendencies in the West and in China. Mahler's tendency is to universalize personal moments, to abstract from a particular experience an elevated and grandiloquent gesture: O Schanheit! O ewigen Liebens- Lebens-Trunk'ne Welt! One might speak of the nominalization of reality, so strong a linguistic feature of German, as distinctly antithetical to the particularization, which stresses immanence rather than transcendence, in Chinese. "Oh, Beauty! Oh, everlasting Love- Life-besotted World!" There is a magnificent grandeur in these lines, which can easily turn to bathos and false emotion in bad poets, to the Egotistical Sublime, as critics have characterized it. Traditional Chinese poetry, on the other hand, conveys a modesty and a restraint, a hesitancy about grand claims, a discretion about feeling that can be disarming and heartening at its best, mundane and banal at its worst. Indeed, it was these qualities that attracted Bethge in the first place: "What graceful lyrical art confronted me here! I felt a shy, transient tenderness of lyrical utterance .... " (Blaukopf, pp. 235-236). Mahler's additions tend toward the grand romantic gesture: there is no shyness in such lines as: "Still ist mein Herz und harret seiner Stunde" Even Bethge's comprehensive "Die Erde ist die gleiche aiberall" is not capacious and breathtaking enough for Mahler, and he extrapolates it to virtually cosmic proportions: Die liebe Erde allaberall Bliiht auf im Lenz und grant aufs neu! Allaberall und ewig blauen licht die Fernen! And, where Bethge had written, simply, "Und ewig, ewig sind die weissen Wolken---" Mahler ends the lyric with portentous ellipsis: Ewig ... ewig ... In these additions and adjustments, one can see Mahler raising the philosophical and cosmic stakes in Bethge: he extends the discourse in time and space. Experience is global and comprehensive: O Schbnheit! O ewigen Liebens- Lebens-trunk'ne Welt!</page><page sequence="9">Eoyang, The Maladjusted Messenger: Rezeptionsisthetic in Translation 69 The self, the "I," is no longer a specific individual in history, bound in an age, or restricted by region, constrained by contemporaneity: the "I" becomes supernal, almost messianic and apocalyptic: Still ist mein Herz und harret seiner Stunde! A comparison of Bethge's translations with the originals shows the following interpola- tions (see Appendix B): O sieh, wie eine Silberbarke schwebt (Oh see, like a silver ship floats up Der Mond herauf hinter den dunkeln Fichten The moon behind the dark pines) Der Bach singt voller Wohllaut durch das Dunkel (The brook sings full of melody through the darkness) Wo bleibst du nur? Du ldsst mich lang allein! (Where then art thou? Thou hast left me alone for so long) Ich wandle auf und nieder mit der Laute (I wander up and down with my lute Auf Wegen, die von weichem Grase schwellen, On paths overgrown with tender grass) The additions are, with one exception, in the spirit of the original: the images are concrete, immediate, evocative. The "Silberbarke" is, of course, a nineteenth-century maritime European intrusion in a landlocked, eighth-century Chinese poem. The last line, which conveys the longing appropriate to the poem, yet expresses it in a way not to be found in the original: O kamst du, kdmst du, ungetreuer Freund! The imperative remonstrance in this line contrast sharply with the discretion of the last lines in both original poems, in Witker Bynner's rendering: "And so I think of you, old friend, O troubler of my midnight dreams!" and And still-because you promised-I am waiting for you, waiting, Playing my lonely lute under a wayside vine. Even the Bynner translation overdoes it: the original is much more succinct and restrained: Feeling like this, remembering you, old friend, I think of you in the midst of my dreams. Expecting you to return home, A lonely lute waits by the overgrown path. Both the German and the English versions make the emotion more explicit than it is in the Chinese. At the very center of Bethge's poem is a crucial modification of the original source-line: ... Die arbeitsamen Menschen Gehn heimwarts, voller sehnsuch nach dem Schlaf (... The laboring people Go homeward, longing deeply for sleep)</page><page sequence="10">70 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 10 (1988) The source-line in Meng Haoran's "At the Mountain-Lodge of the Buddhist Priest Ye" reads: : , (Nearly all the woodsmen have reached home) The next line is parallel: , (Birds have settled on their perches in the quiet mist) Actually, Bynner misses a nuance: the birds are "beginning &lt;J to settle on their perches"' 6 There is a sense of process and imminence, both in the chu "beginning" in this line and the adverbial yaX about to" or "almost" in the preceding line, which Bynner doesn't quite capture, the sense of which should be: "The woodsmen have almost all gone home." There is a strong contrast between the natural phenomena of life and immanent human experience, between, on the one hand, the woodsmen returning home and the birds roosting in their nests at evening, and, on the other, the friend who has not yet arrived. But these observations (it would be missing the point to call them metaphors) are inclusive as well as contrastive, for the sense of the previous lines is to suggest a near-completion of a process-the woodsmen almost all gone home, the birds are beginning to settle down. The reverse implication is thereby adduced as well: some woodsmen, a few, have not yet returned; the birds have not yet settled down. The end of the poem hangs fire, is inconclusive: it does not preclude either the possibility of the Buddhist Priest Ye showing up soon, or not at all. This anticipatory indefiniteness -combining apprehensiveness with hope-is the essence of waiting. The poem is a realization of an indicative moment, not a series of insights derived from experience reflected upon."7 The thrust of Bethge's poem is to abstract the experience, to generalize from it: instead of "woodsmen," we have "laboring people" ("Die arbeitsamen Menschen" which in Mahler becomes "made Menschen"). The specific events in the poem are hypostasized into general symbol: the familiar warrants of evening, woodsmen returning home, birds roosting, are summarily comprehended: "Die Welt schlift ein..." Our third example involves a comparison of two translations of the same poem from the Chinese Book of Songs, the Shijing, No. 143, one by Arthur Waley, the other by Ezra Pound (see Appendix C for original). Pound's version (1954): The erudite moon is up, less fair than she Who hath tied silk cords about a heart in agony She at such ease so all my work is vain. Waley's version (1937): A moon rising white Is the beauty of my lovely one, Ah, the tenderness, the grace! Heart's pain consumes me. 16"Birds...in the quiet mist" is an extrapolation of the simple compound yan-niao, which would be awkward to render as "misty bird". 171I have commented on this aspect of Tang poetry in an earlier essay (Eoyang, 1973, pp. 613-615).</page><page sequence="11">Eoyang, The Maladjusted Messenger: Rezeptionsasthetic in Translation 71 My heart is tinder, and steel plucks at my pain so all my work is vain, she at such ease as is the enquiring moon. A glittering moon comes out less bright than she the moon's colleague that is so fair, of yet such transient grace, as ease, undurable, so all my work is vain torn with this pain. A moon rising bright Is the fairness of my lovely one. Ah, the gentle softness! Heart's pain wounds me. A moon rising in splendour Is the beauty of my lovely one. Ah, the delicate yielding! Heart's pain torments me. As a guide to the original, Waley's rendering is certainly the more useful: he captures the formulaic structure of the ballad, the repetitions with programmed "improvised" variants, so familiar in orally composed and orally transmitted songs, the simplicity of diction. By the time Waley published these translations in 1937, entitled The Book of Songs, he was already an accomplished translator from the Chinese and the Japanese: A Hundred and Seventy Chinese Poems appeared in 1918; The No Plays of Japan in 1921; The Tale of Genji, in six volumes, from 1925 to 1933. Possibly because the Shijing had been the focus of anthropological study by Marcel Granet in his Fetes et chansons anciennes de la Chine, published in Paris in 1919, Waley arranged the 290 poems of the 305 poems in the Shijing,'8 not in their traditional order, but according to subject matter. The topics, "courtship," "marriage," "agriculture," "music and dancing," etc., would especially facilitate anthropological and thematic study. For these renderings, he consulted the scholarship of both Gustav Haloun, to whom the volume is dedicated, and to Bernhard Karlgren, whose annotated prose translations he recom- mends to the "specialist." But this translation of one of the folk-songs in the guo-feng, "airs of the country," section of the Shijing is somewhat typical of Waley's success with the pining love ballads that dominate this section: the chaste and modest demeanor, the controlled passion, the reflective discretion-all seem right. (Waley is less successful with political satire or bombast, such as 49, 52, 223 [Waley nos. 269, 270, 268].) Pound's rendering on the surface appears contrived and forced: it is certainly more "written up" than Waley's. There is no warrant in the original for "erudite" in "erudite moon," though the image is striking. There is nice paranomasia in "My heart is tinder." The phrase "steel plucks at my pain "-though an anachronism-is suggestive. And "transient grace," prompted by a line in the original that Karlgren interprets as "How easy and handsome" (Karlgren; Waley: "Ah, the delicate yielding"), is apt descriptor for both the moon and the beauty of the young. Pound conflates the sense of Karlgren's "easy" and Waley's "yielding" into a neologism that looks like a misprint: "at ease, undurable." Pound did not profess to know Chinese for his 1954 version, but he had the help and consultation of the Harvard sinologue Achilles Fang, who provided his version, published under the title of The Confucian Odes, with an introduction; he almost 'lHe omitted 15 poems "partly because they are much less interesting than the others and partly because in many passages the text is so corrupt that one would be obliged either to write nonsense or to leave many blanks"-Waley, p. 11. The "Finding List" at the end of the book is misleading, since it gives Waley's numbering for all 305 poems, including the 15 not presented.</page><page sequence="12">72 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 10 (1988) certainly had access to Waley's 1937 version of the Shijing.'9 Indeed, it is difficult to imagine some of Pound's versions as anything but extreme reactions to Waley. A comparison of the 290 Shijing translations to be found in both Pound and Waley reveal few if any versions that are even approximately similar, representing a high order of improbability when one considers that the same originals are involved. It may be that Pound translated not so much through Waley as against Waley. Sometimes he went to great lengths to avoid imitating the English poet-sinologue, not infrequently producing neither translations nor poems, but travesties of verbal reconstruction: Pound's versions of Shijing 40, 75, and 76 are particular disasters. Yet, the same strategy can produce an affecting imitation of a hillbilly folk ballad, even if it may sound very dated to urban audiences, as in his rendering of Shijing 187 ("Huang niao"); and his dirge inspired by Shijing 23 ("Lies a dead deer on yonder plain") is one of the loveliest laments for lost youth and the death of innocence in the English language. Pound's strategy is to create a literate text out of an oral song: as in other versions (cf. No. 40, 75, 90, 99), he modifies the balladic oral formulas into readable texts rather than singable scripts (although Waley's indifference to regular metrics precludes his translations being sung). He alters the vocative aspect of the original into a declarative, reflexive self-rumination on personal misery. He converts a syntactically simple ballad which could just as easily have been translated without verbs (the verbs in the poem are, if anything, only stative or participial) into dense contortions of syntax, as in "she at such ease / as is the enquiring moon" and "A glittering moon comes out / less bright than she the moon's colleague / that is so fair" (where one would expect the accusative "her" and not the nominative "she"). Pound's version also introduces a third voice: the implicit "I" of the narrator-speaker, the implied "you" of the reader- listener, and the explicit "she" of the text of the poem. Where, in the original, the sentiments are effusions addressed to no one in particular, a self soliloquizing to an absent lover, overheard by the reader-listener, in Pound there is discursiveness and narrativeness: the speaker refers to the object of love in the third person; the reader is actively invoked as witness to the narrator's plaint. This "narrativity" in the lyric undermines the "lyricism" in the original, converts it from an example of what Eliot, in defining the lyric, referred to as "that which is overheard," to a description which is directly communicated from one person (the poet or narrator) to another (the reader or listener). As such, the entire poem in Pound takes on a level of irony and sophistication absent in the original, which is, after all, a series of balladic apostrophes that could be expanded indefinitely with slight variation of a word or two in each of the four lines. The element of "narrativity" introduced into the Pound version elicits expectations of coherence and "argument" on the part of the reader. One senses a need of beginning, middle, and end. Pound tries to weight the poem toward a climax by using two techniques, one involving length of line and the other rhyme. His last stanza is the longest of the three (in the original they are all of equal length), and, unlike the previous stanzas, the final stanza ends with a rhyme. Pound's version of Shijing 143 indicates that he read it as a text to be reconstituted as text, not as script; he saw it as literate pretext for the expression of emotion (hence the words that smack of a study, such as "erudite," "enquiring" and "colleague," '9gThis order of publication reverses the order in which Pound's Cathay (1917) and Waley's One Hundred and Seventy Chinese Poems (1918) appeared.</page><page sequence="13">Eoyang, The Maladjusted Messenger: Rezeptionsisthetic in Translation 73 the coining of "undurable"). His perspective is at the antipodes of Waley's "anthropo- logical" approach: where, for Waley, these songs were verbal artifacts that preserved in ritual terms the generational experience of the people, for Pound, these are private expressions of unique and original emotion. The contrast is more than a matter of correct or incorrect translation; it is a reflection not only of how Pound read the poem, whether in the original, with the help of Achilles Fang and the aid of previous translations, but also of how we read these translations. Waley's approach is no less disingenuous than Pound's, for he presumes our interest to be research, not aesthetic enjoyment; he presumes on the reader's scholarly curiosity, and arranges the Shijing poems topically, as if their value or interest might be, thereby, enhanced. Pound sees the Shijing as the fount of private inspiration, not as public expression to be reconstructed. We read the three texts-the original and the two translations-with a sense of how variously distant they all are from us. The simplicity of the original seems charming, if a little innocent; the spareness of the Waley strikes us as bland and passionless; and the ingenuity of the Pound impresses us as dense and tortured. We have examined three different instances of what Robert Escarpit calls "trahison crdatrice" or what Harold Bloom would characterize, without pejorativeness, as "mis- prision." Each instance betrays the interpreter, who reads into the text his own predi- lections and presuppositions, even as the translations "betray" the original text. Each instance provides textual warrant for "an implied reader" that is far from "ideal," yet somehow apt and useful for us, their "implied readers," in deriving knowledge from the texts, whether originals or translations. In a memorable quote from his Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein wrote: The more narrowly we examine actual language, the sharper becomes the conflict between it and our requirements ... The conflict becomes intolerable; the requirement is now in danger of becoming empty. - We have got on to slippery ice where there is no friction and so in a certain sense the conditions are ideal, but also, just because of that, we are unable to walk. We want to walk: so we need friction. Back to the rough ground! (Wittgenstein, p. 46) It is some of this "rough ground" that we have tried to cover in this paper, but whereas Wittgenstein was speaking of the conflict between actual language and the requirements of logic, we have concentrated on the conflicts between the original text and its translations. The study of translations must break out of the anecdotal as well the merely lexical: translations provide too rich a study for reader interpretation to be left to linguistic pedants; they offer too many insights, not only on the target and source languages, but often on language itself, to be left to dilletantes. It may be, as George Steiner and others have argued, that the study of translation, so peripheral to the interests of national literatures, yet so central to a growing population of expatriates and exiles, may be one of the paradigms for human understanding and learning: for in understanding something new, isn't the first instinct to relate it to something old and familiar? And when the "false analogy" between the "new" and the "old' has been discovered, hasn't one then begun to appreciate the new on its own terms? And does this process not mirror the process of translation, in which one appropriates an unfamiliar source</page><page sequence="14">74 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 10 (1988) text into a familiar target language, always erroneously and fruitfully misinterpreting (even when the translation is accurate: for then the essential uniqueness of the original in the source language is thereby betrayed)? The progressive realization of the "errors" in translation restores for us the radical originality-not to mention the "radical historicity"--of the source text: they make us see the original more clearly, providing what anthropologists would call "emic" (insider's) knowledge as well as "etic" (outsider's) knowledge. Heinz Kohut character- izes this contrast as "experience-near" and "experience-distant," by which he means what might roughly understood as intuitive knowledge (riding a bicycle) and analytic knowledge (knowing the laws of motion, which explain how it is possible to ride a bicycle). I should like to borrow from current computer vocabulary by using the terms "native-friendly" and "stranger-friendly." Translations are generically predisposed to being "stranger-friendly" (though some academic translations are more inaccessible to the target-language reader than the original ever was to the source-language reader).20 The student of translation, however, needs to be sensitive to four typologies of inter- pretation: the strange made familiar (as in Fitzgerald's Omar Khayyam or the Hebrew Old Testament in English); the strange made strange (as in any of a number of bizarre transliteration systems of Chinese, not excluding pinyin); the native made familiar (which constitutes "emic" experience, by virtue of long acculturation); and the native made strange ("etic" experience, or "ostraenie," defamiliarization). Clifford Geertz's description of the process involved in anthropological analysis holds as true for translators and students of translation: "a continuous dialectical tacking between the most local of local detail and the most global of global structure in such a way as to bring them into simultaneous view" (Geertz, p. 134). There is a haunting entry in Wittgenstein's On Certainty which is relevant here not only because it mentions China: I ask someone "Have you ever been in China?" He replies "I don't know." Here one would surely say "You don't know?" (Wittgenstein, p. 42e) Of those we have studied in this paper, only Legge went to China: Mahler, Bethge, Pound and Waley never set foot in China. Yet extended residence did not remove from Legge the scales of Christianity from his eyes: he never saw the Confucian texts in their own light. In a sense, Legge didn't really know he was in China, despite his extended residence. The others imagined themselves, rightly or wrongly, in China: Mahler took the Chinese experience and derived from it transcendent, universalist musical expressions for friendship, parting and longing. Bethge discovered in the Chinese poems his own lyrical impulse, perhaps not so shy as that in the original, but haunting and evocative in its own right. Pound took the Chinese classics as sources 20A perfect pair of examples for the "stranger-friendly" and the "native-friendly" contrast can be seen in the Yugoslavian car imported to the United States called "Yugo", which is not only an apt abbreviation of the source of the car, but an inviting descriptor of the vehicle itself-"You go!" The obverse example is the insistence of General Motors in naming one of its Chevrolet models "Nova", which connotes in English "a constellation of stars" as well as newness, but which reads to Spanish-speaking peoples (including those in the United States) as "no-va", "it doesn't go." Both the Yugo in Yugoslavia and the Nova in the United States are "native-friendly" in the country of manufacture, the one appealing to native patriotism, the other to the American penchant for the novel. But the Yugo is "stranger-friendly", the Nova is not.</page><page sequence="15">Eoyang, The Maladjusted Messenger: Rezeptionsiisthetic in Translation 75 of inspiration, Waley as sources for study. If these "readers" of Chinese had never gone to China, their imaginations nevertheless persuaded them that they were in China. In an age when the mere physical fact of having been to China seems to confer knowledge (or at least the aura of knowing), it is important to remember that the majority of natives all over the world are ignorant, and that the truly knowledgeable people are those who command native knowledge of a subject with a stranger's perspective on that subject. To adopt Hirsch's polarity, if being a native is the only way to understand the meaning of what life is like in that culture, only a non-native perspective will yield its significance. This principle of epistemology is merely the more abstract version of the tourist's truism that one does not understand or appreciate one's own country until one leaves it. Neither the "naturalization" of the foreign, which erases the unique character of the original, nor the exploitation of the exotic, which exaggerates differ- ences,21 is sufficient for a truly global or scientific perspective in our "horizon of expectations." One must demystify the Other even as one defamiliarizes the Self. 21The notion of seeing translations as "naturalizations" or as "barbarianizations" is insightfully explored by James J. Y. Liu in his article "Polarity of Aims and Methods: Naturalization or Barbarization?" (Yearbook of Comparative and General Literatures 24[1975],60-67). "Naturalizations" render the strange familiar; "barbarizations" preserve the strangeness of the unfamiliar. These terms in the context of Liu's discussion are clear enough, but they have failed to be widely adopted because of the inherent ambivalence of the terms: "naturalizations" are unnatural processes by which immigrants gain citizenship in the United States; "barbarizations," on the other hand, suggest to the Chinese anyone who is not Chinese. The terms are, therefore, "loaded" in American English, and when translated, in Chinese.</page><page sequence="16">76 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 10 (1988) Sources cited Blaukopf, Kurt.
