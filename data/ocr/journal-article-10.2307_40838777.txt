Curiously enough another force which brought the Brahmin closer to the DMK was its anti-North separat- ism itself. At the time of its origin in the early forties the demand for a se- parate State for the Dravidian Tamils was both anti-North Indian and anti- Brahmin, the Brahmin being dubbed an Aryan interloper from the North. This questionable historical case for the movement was very soon overshadowed by a practical case based on the hea- vier Plan-spending in the North and on the infliction of Hindi, on the South. On both these counts, the Tamil Brah- min began to agree with DMK impli- citly at first and warmly and openly later. The agreement was based partly on the grounds publicly explained by DMK itself and partly on his own emo- tional experiences in the North. Indeed, DMK leaders and suppor- ters had little of the latter compared to the Tamil Brahmin who had sought work in the cities and towns of the North for about half a century. His early success therein in all fields from clerking to journalism and academic life was followed in due course by the inevitable local suspicion, rivalry and some enmity. This direct exposure made him more and more bitter about North Indian attitudes and more appre- ciative of the fighting stand taken by DMK even though he was not prepar- ed to go all their way in demanding a separate state. Crucial Alienation There were two other reasons which made him feel closer to DMK: The «ef- forts at reviving Hindu culture or Bha- ratiya Samskriti by the proletarian ised Aryayarta looked to the more sensitive souls from the South both ludicrous and dangerous. To legatees of a continu- ously evolving Hindu culture in the South, the efforts to convert the defen- sive, amorphous, anthropomorphic mass culture of UP into Bharatiya Sam- skriti looked ludicrous. They redis- covered the fact that DMK groups who criticised the Aryan Brahmin culture knew more about it than the Hindu proletariat or the Islamised «middle class of Aryavarta. The crucial alienation came with the serious efforts made to impose Hindi along with strident pro- paganda. In that regard most Tamil Brahmins threw their lot wholehearted- ly with DMK even without Rajaji's persuasion, whose contribution was 1136</page></plain_text>
