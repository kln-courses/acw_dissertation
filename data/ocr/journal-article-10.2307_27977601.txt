Introduction Although anthropomorphic figurines are known from many parts of Andean South America, very few have been reported from the northern provinces of Chile. Recent excavations along the Quebrada Tarapac? produced several figurines and led to a re-examination of the occurrences of figurines in northern Chile at large. This paper is a r?sum? of those specimens so far known for this region. All resources included, the sample is very small and forms an inadequate basis for any detailed typological or comparative analysis. However, the context and nature of some of the included specimens suggest that even a descriptive r?sum? would be of interest and importance. Based on the nature of the figurines and the associated cultural material, the sample can be subdivided into three categories: 1. Figurines associated with what has been termed the Chinchorro complex from the northern coastal regions of the Province of Tarapac?, Chile. 2. Figurines from a cemetery on the Quebrada Tarapac?, Province of Tarapac?, found in association with materials considered to be part of the Faldas del Morro complex, described originally on the basis of finds in the vicinity of Arica. 3. Figurines recovered from excavations in the Quebrada Tarapac? (1966-67), apart from those attributed to the Faldas del Morro complex. These figurines are believed to be more recent in time than those placed in categories 1 and 2, and they have not yet been identified as to cultural affiliation. Specimens similar to several of the figurines included in category 1 have been mentioned in print and are known at least casually to Chilean specialists. Those in categories 2 and 3 have not been described previously. Chinchorro The Chinchorro complex is believed to represent a fairly early cultural manifestation, seemingly limited to a few coastal locations in the extreme north of Chile and perhaps the southernmost province of Peru. The inventory of material remains includes elaborately prepared mummies early in the investigations of Chilean prehistory and have been recovered from several Chinchorro or Chinchorro-like sites. They have been desig nated momias estatuillas by Mart?nez and Munizaga (1961, p. 9). The</page><page sequence="2">66 Chinchorro complex was first described by Uhle under the designation Aborigines de Arica (Uhle, 1919, pp. 4-21). The term Chinchorro for the same material was proposed by Dauelsberg (1963, p. 201). Some Chinchorro artifacts were described, or at least mentioned, in the course of museum inventories of the Uhle collections made in the Museo Hist?rico Nacional de Santiago (Munizaga, 1957, p. 97). Skeletal materials associated with these collections, and especially the characteristics of the prepared mummies, are being studied by Juan Munizaga (personal communication, 1966). Alvarez (1961, p. 3), and N?fiez (1965, pp. 45-48) have published additional comments on Chinchorro materials. The very important Nielsen collection, presently located in the University of Chile Regional Museum, Iquique, is being processed for publication by Lautaro N?fiez. The eight figurines described below are from the Nielsen collection and were excavated from the site Patillos 2, located on the coast to the south of the town of Iquique (see fig. 1). In the descriptions that follow, the number after each heading represents the inventory number in the Nielsen catalog (University of Chile Regional Museum, Iquique). 1. Anthropomorphic head fragment (2552). This specimen represents a human head made by forming a paste over a fragmented skull of a human infant. Between the paste and the skull fragments there are occasional spaces containing evidence of melted resin or pitch. The resin here was probably derived from plants of the genus Prosopis which are indigenous on the Pampa de Tamarugal some 30 km. inland from the site at Patillos. The paste is unfired and has a dark gray color. Preliminary analysis indicated that it consists of wind blown sand, some small amounts of clay and substantial amounts of ash or ground carboniferous material. This carboniferous material, when mixed with sea water, appears to act as an adhesive and holds the paste together. Similar use of ash and sea water as a binding agent can be documented from more recent contexts in the same area, where such mixtures were used as mortar in wall construction. The combination produces a high-density paste that is easy to model and has considerable weight. It is possible that the paste also contained an organic binder such as the resin described above. A single oblique incision made after the paste was dry and hard may represent an eye. No other facial features are depicted. The entire facial area was painted with a red stain or wash. The dimensions of the fragment are: length 5.3 cm., width 5.5 cm., and thickness 2.8 cm. On the basis of these dimensions and those from other figurines in the series, it is suggested that the complete figurine was between 20 and 25 centimeters in length. 2. Complete anthropomorphic head (2553). A modeled head made of the same paste material described for figurine 1. The surface of the specimen was polished and smoothed and lacks obvious striations. Two incised points represent eyes, and a mouth is formed by a single punctate mark or incision. A nose and supraorbital ridge features have been</page><page sequence="3">67 modeled into the paste. The face was probably painted white and red, but the pigment has been badly eroded. Because the head is intact, it is not possible to examine its interior, and no internal features or construction can be described. The density of the paste material made X-ray examinations inconclusive. The dimensions of this specimen are: length 3.2 cm., width 2.5 cm., and thickness 2.5 cm. 3. Complete anthropomorphic figurine (2554) (see fig. 3a). The head on this specimen has a generally oval shape with a slightly jutting jaw or lower face. Facial features such as supraorbital arches and a nose are modeled, while mouth and nostrils are indicated by small perfor ations or punctate marks. The upper part of the head is marked by a shallow linear depression which may have served as a point of attachment for a hair piece or wig. The face was covered with red pigment of some kind. The body of the figurine is cylindrical with a tapering or conical termination. The section is slightly oval. No extremities or sex characteristics are indicated. Examination of the interior by means of cracks and joints in the paste indicate that this specimen does not contain skeletal material and was not formed over a bony frame of any kind. X-ray examination con firms this observation. As a result of the X-ray examination, however, it was possible to determine some interior details of construction. The core of the torso appears to be made of a light, not especially compact material marked by numerous cracks and interstices. This core was covered with a second layer of paste which was much more compacted and dense. The compaction probably resulted from the polishing and surface finishing operations. The paste is similar to that described for figurine 1 but is not quite as heavy and dense in texture. The dimensions are as follows: length 17.5 cm., width 6.2 cm., and thickness 5.5 cm. 4. Complete anthropomorphic figurine (2555) (see fig. 3b). The head of this specimen is slightly elongate with an oval face. The lower face projects in such a way as to form a marked jaw line. The nose and supraorbital arches are modeled. Eyes and a mouth were formed with punctate marks while the paste was still wet. Below the mouth it is possible to see small incised markings forming two horizontal rows of short vertical slashes. This design may represent a stylized beard or other facial adornment. In the area above the eyes, faint horizontal marks can be detected that may also represent facial adornment of some kind. The face has an undercoating of green pigment over which a second coat of white paint has been applied. On the back side of the head there are indications of a joint or seam where the paste layers come together. This joint seems to form a central demarcation line which divides the head into two sections. Along the joint it is possible to detect traces of vegetable resin near the upper part of the head. This resin may have been used to fasten a hairpiece or may have been a binder used in the construction of the head itself. The torso has a tapered termination with an oval section.</page><page sequence="4">68 No limbs or sex are indicated. Some fine striations are present on the paste surface as a result of the smoothing and finishing processes. The paste itself seems to be similar to that described for the specimens above. As with the others, this figurine is unfired. A thin slip or film of clay originally covered the surface, but this slip has eroded, and only a few small patches remain. X-ray examination reveals a central core of some kind made of a relatively dense material, surrounded by thin open areas between the core and an outer layer of paste. The nature of this central core has not been determined, and the material of which it is made cannot be identified without damaging the specimen. The dimensions of this figurine are as follows: length 13.5 cm., width 5.6 cm., thick ness 4.1 cm. 5. Complete anthropomorphic figurine (2556) (see fig. 3d). A specimen characterized by a roughly rectangular torso, a separate modeled head, and well-defined limbs. The head is small compared to the specimens described above but is proportional to the attached torso. The head is roughly oval in form and has a well-defined face with recog nizable features. The torso has clearly defined shoulders. Arms are modeled as part of the torso and not attached as appliqu? elements. The lower limbs appear to be separated from one another, but this effect may be due in part to some breakage in this area. The original configuration of the lower limbs is not clear. The paste is light brown in color and seemingly contains less of the carboniferous material present in all of the figurines so far described. The resinous material likewise seems to be lacking. The paste was not fired. It appears that the entire specimen was coated with a red clay slip, after which, the head was painted white with added decorative elements in green. For all practical purposes, this specimen is complete, but it is broken in several places and a portion of one leg is missing. Because of a break at the neckline where the head joins the torso, it was possible to examine the interior of the head as well as to see the paste in cross section. Examination disclosed that the cranium of a bird was enclosed within the paste forming the head. This observation was confirmed by R. Casamiquela who examined the remains and indicated that the enclosed skull was that of a sea swallow, Oceanites oceanicus (personal communica tion, 1967). The presence of this skull was also confirmed by X-ray photographs. The internal core construction described for the specimens above was missing in this figurine. Instead the figurine was modeled around a series of spines of quisco, a long-thorned cactus found in the region. Such spines were usually taken from cacti belonging to the genus Cerus. This core of spines appears to be an imitation of the Chinchorro practice of placing wooden sticks into the body cavities of both adults and children as part of the mortuary preparations. The dimensions of this specimen are: length 17.2 cm., width 5.0 cm., thickness 2.3 cm. 6. Complete anthropomorphic figurine (2514) (see fig. 4a). A complete figurine with an oval head and a tapering termination. The head has a flat face that projects out from the torso, with a clearly defined jaw. Facial features, including a nose, are modeled. Eyes are indicated by punctate holes. Small depressions beneath the nose may represent the</page><page sequence="5">69 remains of some kind of facial adornment. The face was originally covered with a thin white slip or wash. At the present time, most of this pigmentation is missing, and the remainder is in poor condition. The upper part of the head has a slightly depressed groove or seam, seemingly joining two sections of the modeled head. This groove may mark the point of attachment for a hair piece or wig. The torso, lacking extremities of any kind, is modeled around the lower jaw of a dolphin. The paste consists of sand and carboniferous material with possible vegetable resins as cementing agents or binders. The dimensions of this specimen are: length 22.7 cm., width 7.3 cm., thickness 5.3 cm. 7. Complete anthropomorphic figurine (2623) (see fig. 3c). This figurine differs somewhat from those described above. The head here is the dominant element, and the torso and appendages are minimized. The head is modeled in clay, while the torso and extremities are made of a fine wool yarn wrapped around a core of heavier cordage. The paste forming the head is light brown in color but has in part been tinted with a reddish-brown pigment. The most striking aspect of the head is the featureless mask of paste over the facial portions. This masklike treatment is typical of prepared mummies found in the Chinchorro complex. A miniature turban of finely finished wool covers the top of the head. This element, which is light brown in color, is twisted on both sides of the head. It is fastened with a cactus spine pin similar to those used to hold full-sized headpieces found on mummies taken from the same site. A swatch of human hair is exposed at the back of the turban and in some places where the facial mask has cracked. This hair piece appears to be fastened to the turban. It reaches to the level of a pubic cover or skirt. The skirtlike element itself is made of vari ous lengths of wool yarn pendent from a waistband. The skirt color is light brown. Both in color and manufacture the skirt is similar to garments found on the bodies of both adults and children recovered from the same site (Patilio 2). The skirt or pubic covering is fastened at the waist and extends to the lower end of the figurine, covering the lower extremities. These extremities consist of three skeins or coils of wool material twisted together to form a tapered termination intended only as a stylized sub stitute for limbs. The torso and extremities are clearly subordinate to the head. One arm is represented. The extremely fragile nature of the specimen precluded X-ray examination. However, after careful visual examination, all circumstances considered, it seems unlikely that the head portion contains any of the bony material reported for some of the specimens described above. The dimensions of this figurine are: length 12.H cm., width 5.1 cm., thickness 3.8 cm. 8. Anthropomorphic figurine fragment (2551). The fragmentary condition of this specimen makes any kind of detailed description impos sible. Based on the available fragments, it appears likely that the termination was tapered and the figurine was made of paste similar to that</page><page sequence="6">70 of the specimens described above. Comments Chinchorro figurines, as represented in the present sample, can be subdivided into several categories. Based on general configuration, two basic groups are represented: 1. Figurines with tapered terminations and large stylized faces. All specimens in this group lack limbs or other body features. 2. Figurines with essentially naturalistic proportions and limb configurations. In the present sample, all complete specimens except one fall into the first category. Within this grouping (category 1) at least three further subdivisions are represented: a. Figurines that contain elements of human skeletal material. b. Figurines that contain elements of nonhuman skeletal material. c. Figurines that do not seem to include any skeletal framework or inclusions of bone. One specimen in the latter category is unique in that the torso, normally fashioned in clay, is made of twisted coils of wool yarn. The significance of the differences cited above with respect to cultural practices, changes through time, or whatever, is not known. The nature of the sample, however, is such that there is no doubt that ail of the figurines so far examined were made as miniature copies of the prepared mummies typical of the Chinchorro complex. Although no ages are known for the figurines per se, the Chinchorro complex has been tentatively dated by two radiocarbon determinations on the same wood sample from the site at Pisagua Viejo, 5220 ? 170 radiocarbon years (3270 B.C.), and 4880 ? 320 radiocarbon years (2730 B.C.) (IVIC 170; N?fiez, 1966, p. 108). Chinchorro material is considered to be preceramic, and, so far at least, preagriculturai. All figurines found so far have been unfired. For more detailed discussion of Chinchorro cultural characteristics and descriptions of the complex in general, the reader should refer to the following works: Uhle, 1917, 1918, 1919; N?fiez, 1965, 1966; Mart?nez and Munizaga, 1961; Munizaga, 1964; and Alvarez, 1961. Faldas del Morro Material attributed to the Faldas del Morro Complex in this report was excavated by Lautaro N?fiez from the site designated TarapacS 40, located along the lower reaches of the Quebrada TarapacS in the district of Caserones (fig. 2).</page><page sequence="7">71 Faldas del Morro, as it is presently defined, is based on material recovered and studied by Dauelsberg (1963, p. 201). This com plex includes material designated "Per?odo contempor?neo con las ruinas de Chavin" by Uhle (1917, pp. 21-23), a terminology now superseded locally by the Dauelsberg designation. In addition to the type site in Arica, the Faldas del Morro complex has a coastal distribution at least as far south as Pisagua, and recent excavations inland along the Quebrada Tarapac? have produced similar materials. The figurines recovered at this site (Tr. 40) are the first reported for the Faldas del Morro complex. In general, this complex appears to be part of the earliest ceramic phase in this region. Indications at Tarapac? 40 tend to confirm this attribution. Here out of some 100 burials excavated, only three graves contained pottery. In contrast, other cemeteries in the region, believed to be later in time, have significant amounts of pottery in almost all graves. The ceramics usually associated with Faldas del Morro are described as generally crude (Dauelsberg, 1963, p. 201). A total of six figurines was recovered from the Tarapac? 40 cemetery. All were associated with a single burial (burial 88 in section Mf). The identification of the figurines with the Faldas del Morro com plex was based on the similarities of associated grave goods with materi als recovered from the coastal sites, as well as from the type site in Arica. 1. Anthropomorphic figurine (see fig. 4b). A complete figurine modeled in a fine-textured yellowish-brown clay paste that includes some occasional heavier inclusions. The clay can be obtained easily along the adjacent quebrada. The basic head form and torso were modeled from this paste, sun-dried, and at least partially polished or compacted by smoothing. The finish suggests the use of some instrument which left fine striations over the surface. The eyes and mouth are indicated by punctate incisions. A poorly defined nose was modeled in the original clay base. After the initial shaping, several distinctive applique elements were added. These include representations of a rather elaborate head dress or hair-do, and arms. The hair was shaped in clay and marked by incisions made while the paste was still soft. In addition the hair on each side of the head has incisions suggesting a wrapping of wool yarn around the braids or coils. These wrapped coils were modeled in clay and fastened to the head while still wet. The arms are pasted onto the torso and extend to the front of the figurine. Each arm terminates in a series of incisions representing fingers. The specimen has a receding forehead that appears to be the result of cranial deformation practices. Similar conformations have been noted on mummies found in the cemetery at Caserones (Tr. 40). It is likely that this shape is the result of head binding with a turbanlike - headpiece. The head and the hair piece appear to have been treated with</page><page sequence="8">72 a wash or sliplike material containing a red pigment. Part of the figurine was painted black. The painting or coloration, in both instances, is irregular and poorly applied. The red wash, for example, did not cover the back sides of the arms, head, or torso. Because of this, it was possible to examine the original uncolored paste in several parts of the specimen. The torso itself is conical, with a tapered termination and a slight suggestion of buttocks but lacking any indication of lower limbs. The hair styling and pubic cover suggest a female representa tion, although no clear indication of sex is present on the torso. The pubic cover or skirtlike garment is supported at the waist by a belt or girdle. This skirt is a miniature replica of pubic covers found on adult females in the TarapacS 4 0 cemetery. It is made of wool with varicolored yarns including yellow, red, light brown, and dark brown shades. The dimensions of the figurine are: length 13.6 cm., width 4.6 cm., thickness 2.7 cm. 2. Anthropomorphic figurine (see fig. 4e). As with figurine number one, the torso and head here were first modeled and partially finished, after which several appliqu? elements were added. These include a turban, hair, a collar of sorts, and arms. On the basis of what appear to be burned out inclusions in the paste, this figurine may have been partially fired, in contrast with specimen 1, which was sun-dried only. A nose was modeled on the face with nostrils indicated by two punctate marks. Eyes are formed by two punctations and the mouth by a slight line. The entire face was at one time painted red. The head has a turbanlike element wrapped around its upper portion, and, as with figurine 1 in this series, there is a suggestion of cranial deformation. Suspended from both sides of the turban are modeled elements made to represent hair. Around the neck there is another modeled coil marked by incisions that seems to represent some kind of collar. The turban was painted red, but the head itself was stained black. The paints used were water soluble and fugitive. Two arms are pasted to the torso at the shoulders and hang nearly vertically at the sides, resting against the body. Hands are indicated by crudely incised lines at the ends of the arms representing fingers. The torso has the same cylindrical section and tapered termina tion as figurine 1 above, but lacks the modeling suggesting buttocks. No lower extremities are indicated, and no sex suggested. Dimensions are: length 12.4 cm., width 4.1 cm., thickness 2.6 cm. 3. Anthropomorphic figurine (see fig. 4d). This specimen was modeled from a fine-textured dark gray-colored clay and was lightly fired. The firing was insufficient to alter the natural color of the clay. As with specimens in this series described above, the basic</page><page sequence="9">73 head and torso unit was modeled first, after which several appliqu? elements were added. These elements included a neck piece of some kind, hair, and some extra shaping or modification of the head itself. One arm was pasted on at the shoulder. The entire specimen was smoothed, but no attempt was made to apply a fine finish. Finger marks left from the modeling, as well as fine striations on the paste, are still visible. The surface is pitted, as a result of chemical action due to salts accumulated in the paste. This salt accumulation is common in the region. The configuration of the head suggests the cranial deformation common to all the figurines so far described in the Faldas del Morro series. The hair piece is complete with pendent coils or braidlike elements on both sides of the head covering the ears and reaching to the neckline. The neck itself is covered with a scarf or collarlike element. Both the hair and this collar are made of clay appliqu?s marked with crudely incised lines to indicate hair texture and textile characteris tics. A third element, possibly representing another hair coil, is suspended in the center of the head and hangs down over the nose and mouth. The scarf or neckpiece was added after the hair was placed and terminates with a pendent element down the back of the figurine. This element was painted black and white in an alternating pattern. The appliqu? representing hair was painted red in a somewhat haphazard manner. Slight swellings on the pectoral region of the torso probably represent breasts, and it is likely that this figurine was intended to be a female. The single surviving arm is fastened at the shoulder and hangs down the side of the torso with the lower arm and hand resting on the midsection of the body. Both arms were probably in place at the time the specimen was finished. The lower torso has the tapered termination typical of this series, with no suggestion of lower limbs or sex. When found, the lower portion of the figurine was wrapped in a wool garment or pubic covering. This miniature garment was made of red, white, brown and yellow yarn. The placement of this covering when found is indicated in fig. 4d by the dotted lines. The dimensions of this specimen are: length 10.3 cm., width 3.0 cm., thickness 2.7 cm. 4. Anthropomorphic figurine (see fig. 4c). This figurine is a well made specimen modeled from a local clay mixture containing some coarse inclusions. The paste color is a yellowish-white, and the specimen has been lightly fired. The surface is marked by some pitting due to the accumulation of salts. The eyes, nose, and mouth are indicated by punctate marks and a short incised line. Typically, the forehead is receding and suggests cranial deformation due to head-wrapping practices of some kind. Other features include hair, a crude scarf element, and arms. Hair is</page><page sequence="10">74 indicated by finely incised lines in modeled clay and was painted black. Two heavy locks are represented, one on each side, both reaching to the neckline. A third lock of hair hangs down over the center of the fore head, extending to the level of the eyes. There is a crudely fashioned scarflike element around the neck. The arms are pasted to the torso and are resting on the ventral midsection. The torso has a tapering termi nation and no indication of lower limbs or sex. The figurine in general was painted or stained in a rather haphazard manner with a fugitive red pigment. f A pubic cover, fashioned from twisted yarn, hangs pendent from a rather massive waistband or beltlike element. It has two skeins of wool yarn which serve to hold the pendent strands to the waistband by means of a simple knot. The skirt elements are colored red, brown, white and vermillion. The dimensions of this specimen are: length 7.0 cm., width 3.0 cm., thickness 2.0 cm. Specimens 5 and 6 are complete figurines, but are somewhat less elaborate than those described above (see figs. 5a and b). Both specimens were modeled in fine-textured clay and finished by smoothing. They are unfired and have cracks in several places. It is possible that they are unfinished, but this possibility seems unlikely. In any case, they are poorly made. There is no indication of painting and only minimal features are depicted. The central lock of hair described for figurines 3 and 4 is depicted in both of these specimens, but is crudely modeled and lack ing in detail. Hair texture on the other parts of the head is suggested by modeling, but again crudely executed and lacking in detail. In the case of specimens 5 and 6 in this series, evidence of cranial deformation is less obvious than in the figurines described above, but it seems clear that the same general head configuration is present. Arms are present on both specimens, with the hands resting on the ventral midsection. Terminations are tapered, and there is no suggestion of lower limbs or sex. For figurine 5 the dimensions are: length 7.2 cm., width 2.4 cm., thickness 1.1 cm. For figurine 6 the dimensions are: length 5.3 cm., width 1.7 cm., thickness 0.7 cm. Comments All of the Faldas del Morro figurines described above are solid and lack internal cavities. They are modeled in local clay and sun-dried. Minimal firing is suggested in only two instances. The basal terminations all are tapered, with no attempt to depict lower limbs. Burial number 88 in section ', the source of these figurines, was located some 55 centimeters beneath the surface in an area presently covered with dune sand. The body and grave goods had been placed in a pit excavated into the sand and in part into a decomposed rock base. This pit was then covered by a layer of branches from the tamarugo (Prosopis sp.) and by wind blown sand. A burial chamber was made by placing two large baskets face to face, and the mummy bundle and various grave goods were placed in it. The mummy bundle, containing the body of</page><page sequence="11">75 a small male child as well as grave goods, was enclosed within a series of nested baskets. In addition to the baskets, several other items were found, including a flat basketry tray containing quinoa and the two small figurines (5 and 6). The remainder of the figurines were located immediately above the mummy bundle in association with a pyroengraved gourd. The nature and general quality of the grave goods suggest that this child was of some importance. For example, the body was wrapped with the skin of an animal tentatively identified as vicu?a. The mummy bundle was then placed on the lower basket and covered with a robe made up of sewn strips of vicu?a skin. The grave goods and their cultural significance will be described in detail as part of the report on the cemetery in general. Studies of this material are in progress under the direction of Professor Lautaro N??ez. The material is presently located at the University of Chile Regional Museum at Iquique. A single C 14 determination from Burial 62 section M1 suggests an age of some 16-1800 years ago for the Faldas del Morro complex in this area: 1660 ? 90 (A.D. 290) (GaK 2206, 5570 year half life). Dis cussion of the possible range of time, or duration of the cultural pattern, and detailed comparisons with material from adjacent regions, must await completion of the studies in progress and many more C 14 determinations. Other Tarapac? Figurines of Unknown Cultural Affiliation Other figurines recovered in the course of excavations carried out under the auspices of the University of California/University of Chile Cooperative Program will be described below. Specimens recovered from each of four sites will be discussed separately, but the relation ships between specimens on any given site, and between sites in some cases, are not clear. Figurines were recovered from Tarapac? 6, Tarapac? 13A, Tarapac? 15, and from the prehistoric village of Caserones for which no number designation has been assigned. Tarapac? 6 is a sand dune site with mixed cultural constituents. Tarapac? 13A is an agricul tural village believed to have been occupied in late prehistoric times. Tarapac? 15 is likewise an agricultural village and may have been occu pied in late pre-Inca times. Caserones had an intermittent occupation beginning sometime prior to A.D. 1000. All of the dates suggested here are based on ceramics found in the various sites, and represent little more than educated guesses at the present time. Tarapac? 6 A total of eleven fragments representing anthropomorphic figurines was recovered from this location (see fig. 2). It is obvious from the nature of the artifacts found on this site that it was occupied by more than one group and at more than one period of time. Some of the artifact materials suggest considerable time depth, and others clearly represent an occupation during historic times. The figurines described</page><page sequence="12">76 here are believed to be representative of late prehistoric times, 1. (see figs, 5c and 6a). This specimen is crudely formed and poorly finished. It was modeled from light grayish-buff clay of local origin. The paste is fine-textured on the surface, but quite grainy and sandy in the interior. It is very fragile at the present time. A head has been shaped with a tall conical hat or hair-do indicated by vertical striations. The tip of this element is missing. Eyes, nostrils, and a mouth are indicated with incised lines and crescent shaped punctate marks. Rudimentary arms are present, but there are no lower limbs nor indication of sex. The basal termination is rounded and has an oval section. There is no paint or decoration on the torso. The head is set on the torso in such a manner as to suggest that the figure is looking to the side with the head twisted slightly. However, this effect may be nothing more than an indication of haphazard construction and modeling. Examination of the figurine under a microscope did not produce significant additional information other than the presence of salt accumulations in the paste. Since this specimen was found weathering out of a sand dune, it is impossible to discuss cultural associations or original provenience. The dimensions are as follows: length 5.1 cm., width of head at widest point 1.5 cm., width of figurine at widest point 3.0 cm., width of torso just below out-stretched arms 2.0 cm., and thickness 1.3 cm. 2. (see figs. 5f and 6e). A headless torso modeled from a fine textured local clay. It is light buff in color and has not been fired. No temper or additives are visible, but several small bits of unidentified organic material can be seen in the paste. Inclusion of this material is believed to have been accidental. The surface has been smoothed and compacted and is marked by a random patterning of fine striations, probably the result of the finishing process. This torso has rudimentary shoulders but no arms or lower limbs. No sex is indicated and there is no decoration of any kind. The termination has a rounded form, a slightly oval cross section, and some indication of pinching or roughening along the lower margins. It is possible that this specimen represents an early stage of construction of a more elaborate figurine such as those described above under the heading Faldas del Morro. The dimensions are: length 6.4 cm., width at shoulders 2.8 cm., width at termination 2.3 cm., thickness 2.0 cm. 3. (see figs. 5d and 6b). A hand-modeled figurine head made of a fine clay paste with few inclusions. It appears to have been lightly fired and is somewhat more durable and dense than the specimens from this site described above. The paste color is a light grayish-white. The surface was smoothed and covered with a gray pigment, most of which has</page><page sequence="13">77 now eroded away. The shape of the head is conical and seems to represent a hat or hair piece of some kind. Hair is suggested by crude incised lines running vertically to the eye level in front and to the neck line in the back. The face is modeled with slightly rounded puffy cheeks, and the eyes are steeply slanted slits, giving the face a catlike look. Three rounded punctate marks indicate nostrils and probably a mouth. The figurine was broken at the neck and the torso configuration is unknown. A series of small round holes with a wedge-shaped cross section form a kind of collar at the neck line. A cross section of these impressions, at the point where the head was broken from the torso, suggests that they were made by some small pointed object inserted while the clay was still wet. Cactus thorns, commonly used in the region, would have produced impressions of this shape. The holes are located only on the front side of the specimen. There are nine holes which range fron 2 to 3 mm. deep. Overall dimensions of the head are: length 3.1 cm., width 1.7 cm., thickness 1.3 cm. 4. (see figs. Se and 6c). A head which is similar to number 3 described above, although it is slightly smaller and not as well made. The paste is dark gray in color, with a fine texture and little indica tion of temper or inclusions. It may have been lightly fired, since it seems to be relatively durable. Facial features are poorly defined. The mouth, or nose, is represented by a circular punctate impression and a vertically incised line extending to the lower part of the face. Eyes are represented by slanted incised lines. All of the facial features here appear to have been abraded or worn through handling or other use. The head has a conical form representing a hair style or a deformed skull. Vertical incisions made while the paste was still wet probably represent hair. Low-power microscopic examination of the surface and paste reveals that part of this specimen is coated with a white translucent material. Under magnification this material has a crystalline structure and looks like fused glass. However, it is in fact quite soft and can be easily scratched. It is probably a natural wax or resin of some kind, although its function in this context is not known. The dimensions of this head are: length 2.3 cm., width 1.2 cm., and thickness 0.9 cm. 5. (see figs. 5i and 6g). A headless torso with a rounded elongate configuration and a slightly oval cross section. This specimen was modeled from a fine-textured local clay and appears to have been sun dried. It was not fired. The surface was smoothed, but it lacks indications of actual polishing or other finish. Examination under low power magnification reveals that the paste includes occasional strands of fiber similar to llama hair. Two other inclusions may represent fragments of algarrobo seeds (Prosopis sp.). At one time it may have been coated with a fugitive white paint or wash.</page><page sequence="14">78 Rudimentary lower limbs are present, but no other anatomical features are represented. One side, possibly the front, has a round punctate hole located near the junction of the rudimentary legs and the torso. This hole is off center and probably was not intended as an indi cation of sex. The dimensions of this specimen are: length 2.9 cm., width 1.6 cm., and thickness 1.2 cm. 6. (see fig. 6d). This small figurine is crudely modeled and shaped with little concern for finish or detail. It seems to have been fired, however, and is quite hard. The color is gray-brown with a reddish cast in places which may be due to remnants of fugitive paint. No features are represented in any definitive way, but an elongate element probably representing a head has been pinched out on top, and stubs suggesting rudimentary arms are present on the upper torso. No lower limbs are suggested, and the termination is tapered with a slightly bulging configuration. The dimensions for this specimen are: length 3.9 cm., width of head 0.5 cm., width at arm level 1.4 cm., width at center of torso 1.2 cm., thickness at the heaviest section 0.9 cm. 7. (see fig. 6f). A small fragment, which is seemingly a portion of a termination or base of a specimen similar to that described for figurine 2 above (this series). The fragmentary nature of this specimen precluded detailed description of either its form or features. It was hand-modeled of a fine clay paste, is whitish-gray in color and was sun dried and not fired. 8. A small head fragment with slight suggestions of facial features. Two punctate holes may represent eyes and a third may have been intended as a mouth. The third punctation is located in such a way that the entire cross section of the hole is exposed. The shape of the cast indicates that these holes were made with cactus thorns. Three spots of black paint are located on a diagonal line between the indicated eye holes. The paste here is fine-textured, grayish-white in color and obviously was not fired. Three other fragments recovered from Tarapaca 6 may represent figurines, but the identification is not certain. Two of the fragments seem to have been fired, the third was sun-dried only. Caserones Caserones - House 1 1. A head fragment recovered from the "wall rubble" within house 1 (see figs. 5j and 6k). This specimen was formed from a medium-fine clay paste of local origin. It was sun-dried and there is no indication of firing. Examination of the paste reveals only occasional inclusions which probably are accidental. No paint or decoration remains on the surface. The facial features appear to have been shaped after the basic</page><page sequence="15">79 head form had been modeled and dried. Two oval eyes are present as slightly raised elements. A similar raised surface along the lower part of the face suggests a mouth with full lips. This specimen is unique in the collection, and no other figurine described for this area has similar facial features. There is a small irregularity on the top of the head which may represent the remains of some kind of modeled hair or head gear. The dimensions of this specimen are: length 3.2 cm., width 2.8 cm., thickness 1.8 cm. Fig. 8 indicates the location of this specimen within the village of Caserones. Caserones - House 7 1. A nearly complete female figurine recovered from the refuse layer of house 7 (see figs. 5g and 6j). The head, which is the dominant element on this specimen, is roughly triangular in outline and lacks detailed facial features. It is stylized rather than naturalistic. Hair is indicated by some modeling and by black paint. A hair part is suggested by an incised line in the center of the forehead, and a large bell-shaped element extends from the side of the head. This element probably represents some kind of hair styling, although this interpretation is not certain. A similar element was probably located on the other side of the head as well. This part of the figurine was fastened to the head proper with some kind of resin, and a thin layer of a similar material was plastered over the surface, so that the appended element and the head blend into a single surface. The material used as a cementing agent here has not been identified. It is opaque, with a black color and a shiny cast. It looks somewhat like hardened asphalt but probably is a vegetable resin mixed with black paint. A portion of the face was painted with a red pattern, but the intent of this patterning is not clear. A mouth may be indicated by a circular punctate hole in the lower face. The torso is crudely modeled but naturalistic in intent. Two stubs represent lower limbs. Sex is indicated by the remains of two breasts and a vertical slit in the pubic region suggesting genitalia. The paste utilized was a fine-textured material of local origin. It is unfired. The dimensions of this specimen are: length 6.6 cm., width of torso at midsection 1.6 cm., diameter of bell-shaped hair element 1.8 cm., thickness of the torso 1.6 cm. Fig. 8 indicates the location of this specimen within the village of Caserones. Caserones - House 12 1. A modeled torso with rudimentary legs (see figs. 5h and 6i). This specimen was modeled from a fine-textured whitish-gray paste of local origin. It was not fired. The surface was smoothed and slightly compacted but not polished. The head is missing, and there are few diagnostic features to</page><page sequence="16">80 be described. No decoration is evident and no sex indicated. The dimensions are: length 5.5 cm., width 2.9 cm., and thickness 1.9 cm. Fig. 8 locates this find relative to the others found in Caserones. 2. A fragment which may be part of the specimen above (see fig. 6h). The two pieces do not fit together, but the paste and size match, and erosion could have eliminated previously matching edges. If this is part of specimen Caserones-12-1, it may be a head lacking any features or decoration. It could as well be a rounded base termination from a second specimen. Both were found in the same general location in the refuse (see fig. 8). The dimensions of this fragment are: length 3.0 cm., width 2.6 cm., and thickness 2.0 cm. Caserones?Test Trench A Test Trench A was an excavation unit located over a thin layer of refuse between House 7 and edge of the Quebrada. It was exca vated in 10 cm. levels with reasonable control. It was obvious, however, that the deposit was mixed, and cultural materials from at least one prehistoric occupation were mixed with sheep dung throughout all levels. No correlations between particular levels and any specific cultural pattern can be suggested. Two figurine fragments were recovered from this unit. 1. A crudely modeled fragment of the lower torso with an oval section and two rudimentary lower limbs (see fig. 61). The surface of this specimen was smoothed but not polished, and the figurine was not fired. It appears to have had some kind of organic coating over at least part of the surface. However, it is possible that this material is the result of being buried in organic refuse and was not part of the original finish. There is no other indication of surface modification or decora tion. No sex is suggested. The dimensions are: length 5.1 cm., width 3.2 cm., and thickness 2.3 cm. The location of test trench A is indicated in fig. 8. 2. A featureless modeled fragment of sun-dried clay that may be a figurine. Some shaping is present, but it is impossible to know what form was intended. The paste is essentially the same as that in the specimens described above. The dimensions of this fragment are: length 4.1 cm., width 3.7 cm., and thickness 1.8 cm. Tarapac? 15 Tarapaca 15 is a prehistoric agricultural village overlooking the Quebrada Tarapac?, located between the present town of Tarapac? and the village of Huaraci?a (see fig. 2). It has not yet been dated with carbon 14, but the ceramics suggest a late prehistoric occupation (pre Inca). A number of structures with masonry walls and several low refuse mounds are present on the site.</page><page sequence="17">81 A single figurine fragment was recovered from an exploratory strata trench in Mound 1 (not illustrated). The fragment was recovered from level 5 in the stratified refuse. It is crudely formed of fine textured local clay lacking obvious inclusions or temper, and it is unfired. Little effort was expended in the modeling or the surface treatment. It was smoothed in part, but not polished. No facial or body features are indicated, and there is no suggestion of sexual character istics. The dimensions of this fragment are: length 3.9 cm., width 4.2 cm., and thickness 2.7 cm. Tarapac? 13A Tarapaca 13A is a prehistoric village located on a ridge over looking the present town of Huaraci?a (see fig. 2). Excavations here were made in two test areas and parts of several houses were examined. Two figurines were recovered from a floor pocket (cache pit) in house 1. (House 1, Floor Pocket 3). 1. This specimen is modeled from a paste made of ground maize and baked like a small irregular loaf of bread. It is extremely fragile and must have been placed in the cache location soon after completion, (see figs. 51 and 7b). The torso is roughly cylindrical with a slightly flattened and modeled back. There is a decided twist to the body, so that the head looks off at a slight angle. The back is slightly arched and the torso terminates in two rudimentary legs. The back side is marked by a series of lateral creases or depressions. The head sits directly on the shoulders without a neck. A face was formed by pinching the unbaked paste to make a nose ridge. Eyes are marked by small bits of angular and unshaped copper ore or turquoise. A blue feather was stuck in the top of the head. Sex is indicated by male genitals. Dimensions for this specimen are: length of torso 6.7 cm., width of head at eye level 2.2 cm., width of torso at midsection 2.2 cm., width at lower torso 2.0 cm., thickness at eye level 2.0 cm., thickness at midsection 2.1 cm., thick ness at pubic region 2.5 cm. The stones inset for eyes are approximately 3 mm. in diameter. The feather plume is 7.0 cm. long, and 1.5 cm. wide. 2. A female figurine similar to that described above (see figs. 5k and 7a). Torso configuration is the same, except that this specimen has a greater curvature along the lengthwise axis. The head is nearly the same, except that a third bit of copper ore has been placed to indicate a mouth. Another fragment of copper ore on the lower torso probably represents a navel. Sex is indicated by female genitalia into which a yellow feather has been placed. The overall figurine is 7.0 cm. long, and 2.2 cm. wide at the midpoint of the torso. The two figurines here were found as a pair and must be</page><page sequence="18">82 considered as a unit. The use of ground maize to make figurines?to knowledge?has not been reported from the Andean area, and this find be unique. The function of these specimens is unknown. However, with* direct evidence to support the idea, we suggest that these figurines were utilized in some ritual activities related to crop fertility. A portion of the site, Tarapac? 13A, is still being used for ritual purposes by the people from Huaraci?a. Ceramics recovered from this site indicate a prehistoric occu pation probably ending just prior to contact. The possibility that the figurines themselves are post-contact must be considered, although the cache and circumstances of their placement do not indicate it. The pattern on the back of both specimens looks very much like that made by baking on an iron grill of some kind, but this comment is speculative, and the markings may well have some other origin. No clarification of this problem can be expected until detailed studies of the site refuse have been completed, and until C 14 determinations are available. The specimens are presently in storage at the University of Chile Regional Museum, Iquique, Chile. Comments A total of seventeen figurines and possible figurine fragments was recovered from four sites on the Quebrada Tarapac? (not including those from Tarapac? 40 described in a separate section). All are sites believed to be late prehistoric in time, although the occupation of Caserones may have extended over a considerably longer span than the others. Six of the specimens are too fragmentary to classify. Another is essentially complete, but lacks diagnostic features. For the remain der, at least four groupings can be made on the basis of configuration, material, and decorative detail. 1. Figurines with terminations marked by stubby, rudimentary lower limbs. For the most part specimens in this group appear to be poorly made. The single exception (Caserones, House 7-1) may belong with some other category. 2? All specimens in the second grouping were recovered from the same site (Tr. 6) and are identified by the tall pointed hair configura tions, slanted eyes and tapered terminations. 3. The third category is represented by only one example, which may be similar to the figurines described for the Faldas del Morro complex. The specimen here is lacking applique and decorative elements, but looks very much like the Faldas del Morro base element prior to the application of the applique, and may be unfinished. The site Tr. 6 is adjacent to the cemetery Tr. 40 in a similar sand dune situation. 4. Category four comprises the two figurines made of ground maize.</page><page sequence="19">83 So far these are unique, and no other figurines made of maize have been reported for this area. All specimens in this section were modeled in solid paste. No hollow figurines are known for this part of Chile. Except for the pair made of maize, all specimens are constructed of local clay and were sun dried. Two specimens may have been subjected to light firing in addition to the sun-drying, but this treatment is not certain. All are fragile and not suited for handling or use as playthings. Discussion On the basis of the sample examined as part of the present study, it is possible to suggest that figurines have been part of the local scene in northern Chile for some extended period of time. In some instances at least, they represent a well-developed and important part of the local culture. At least four differ?nt stylistic groupings can be recognized. In two cases (Chinchorro and Faldas del Morro) distinctive figurine styles can be attributed to each, although the two complexes may be historically related. Precise cultural placement and identification of the other forms is not possible, simply because the later phases for this specific region have not yet been worked out in sufficient detail. Both of the remaining styles were associated with material obviously different from that of the Faldas del Morro Complex, and it seems to make sense to suggest that figurines recovered from Tr. 6, 13A, 15 and Caserones, are significantly later in time than those from either the Faldas del Morro or the Chinchorro complex. A suggested date for the beginning of the occupation of Caserones based on ceramic evidence would be slightly earlier than A.D. 1000. Caserones probably has had a complex history, however, and may have supported several occupations, including one in colonial times. The other sites in the series are certainly late prehistoric. In addition to the suggested stylistic differences in the figurines described here, at least two functional classes are suggested: 1. Figurines made for mortuary use (to be placed in graves). 2. Figurines associated with occupational refuse on living sites, probably made for non-mortuary ritual functions. Chinchorro and Faldas del Morro figurines are clearly mortuary offerings and so far have been found only with human burials. The other figurines, except for those found on site Tarapaca 6 were all recovered in refuse deposits on living sites. The material from Tarapac? 6 was found weathering out of dune deposits which may include both occupational and mortuary remains.</page><page sequence="20">84 A ritual function is suggested for the refuse figurines, simply because they are too fragile to have functioned as toys or playthings. The obvious emphasis on sexual characteristics in the case of the corn meal figures suggests a concern with fertility. This concern may have been directed toward crops rather than human reproduction. Based on as yet incomplete data and analysis, it is possible to see either (1) a shift of emphasis in figurine function through time from funeral accompaniments to some kind of use within the villages not associated with mortuary rites, or (2) two different classes of figurines, more or less contemporaneous, one utilized in mortuary ritual, the other involved in secular affairs or some other ritual such as crop fertility. The time differences between the two categories suggest the first expla nation, but until living sites of the Chinchorro and Faldas del Morro complexes have been identified and studied, and until a number of cemeteries belonging to the later agricultural villages have been reported in detail, no final decision on this matter is possible. Ac knowledgement s The field research leading to the recovery of the figurines found in the Quebrada Tarapac? (all specimens except those classified as Chinchorro) was supported by the University of California/University of Chile Cooperative Program, with Ford Foundation funds. The C 14 age determination for the cemetery at Tarapac? 40 and incidental expenses resulting from the laboratory analysis were funded in part by a University of California Faculty Research Grant. The support in both instances is greatly appreciated.</page><page sequence="21">85 BIBLIOGRAPHY Alvarez, Lu?s 1961 Culturas precer?micas en la arqueolog?a de Arica.
