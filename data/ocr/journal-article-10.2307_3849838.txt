<plain_text><page sequence="1">JED RASULA AND MIKE ERWIN Interview with Peter Redgrove ERWIN: In many of your poems, I suppose in your more automatic surreal poems in The Hermaphrodite Album, there are very rapid shifts of image and metaphor and something verging through the poem; and I wonder if you have a sort of built-in sense of limitation about the repetitions and mutations of your energies and the metaphors you work with? What are the bounds of surrealism in your poetry? REDGROVE: Well, there isn't any surrealistic content. I mean, I don't understand what you mean by surrealistic content anyway. None of those poems are, in the sense of arbitrariness or of desire to shock, surrealistic. They're surrealistic in the sense that they ex- plore a world whose boundaries shift and change and transform. And they're surrealistic in the sense that they draw on this kind of dream-like life, or a world in which the limitations are only subjec- tive. But I think we need another word than surrealistic for this. I myself would prefer some word which had a notion of eroticism in it. Because those poems are really quite straightforward if you take the notion that in an erotic state of mind you are living in a state somewhere between dream and waking, where the imagination becomes literally true. This is the theme of In the Country of the Skin, too. Obviously within this world certain personages and events recur. In In the Country of the Skin this black woman and the death and the recovery of a child who is the man himself, this kind of process is an archetypal one. This is Isis re-growing her child, or the child of the black Sophia. These things, however, were dis- covered post-facto. This is an experience. The poems are supposed to be experienced, I would say, as in a light trance. That is to say in a trance of concentration. I like to use the Chinese or Japanese no- tion of mirror-mind for this. Or the Zen notion, though I got it from Judo where one is supposed to have mirror-mind as well. Nothing is held onto; things change. "Surrealistic" is the wrong notion, I think. I would say "pentecostal" if it didn't seem to recommend the worst. But perhaps in the existing categories "symbolist" is a better one.</page><page sequence="2">THE HUDSON REVIEW ERWIN: In that world of symbolism do you have a sense of limitation as to where you would stop the suggestiveness or something like it in your poem? REDGROVE: This would depend on my audience. The Hermaphrodite Album itself is written between us, to each other, in the attempt to recreate an erotic atmosphere which is also an intellectual one. The sense of limitation in that is I discovered that many people do not live in an erotic way. So many people seem to live in their heads. That's why the book is called In the Country of the Skin, because it's living in the skin. Limitation-no. The kind of activity in this world leads toward a transformation, a change, and new vistas of con- sciousness. There is the point where one falls back from this kind of state of mind, this incredibly capacious and sensitive state of mind. One falls back from this from time to time. And this is subject- matter of course. So in that sense limitation. There's also limitation in the sense of formal boundaries-well, yes, the vessel changes. The vessel changes. For instance, in The Hermaphrodite Album I think of the way it's become more formal and incantatory later on in the book, more patterned. Why this should be I don't know, except for increasing confidence, since the poems are more or less arranged in chronological order. What happens in that book is that the two kinds of poems, which are our own,Penelope's poems and my sorts of poems-at the beginning you can tell them apart, you know, each of our work. As you go on in the book it's not so easy to tell because they fuse and change, and then people make mistakes about who did what, you see. This is the point of the book, really. It's to say we have our own particular talents, and we're in- terchanging them and learning them. And I would hope in reading the book one gets this sensation. Few of the poems are overtly love poems. But the book itself, as one reads it, is about mingling and the exchange of abilities. Which is, you know, love in practice rather than love stated and depicted. So the word limitation is manifold, isn't it; there are four or five implications there. I think it's quite true to say we are intent on becoming each other. I'm quite sure I'd rather be her than myself. And I think she'd rather be me than herself. So we exchange in this way. But this is quite normal, isn't it, in any love affair. And it looks surrealistic because I suppose the surrealists were highly erotic men. ERWIN: What about the shift in your work in the last few books, 378</page><page sequence="3">JED RASULA AND MIKE ERWIN 379 more markedly from The Force, into this more pentecostal, if you like, world, this more exploratory world of the unconscious. Was this fairly deliberate on your part, or was it gradual? REDGROVE: Obviously it was a delightful gift. My first marriage wasn't very happy. Neither were the jobs I had to do for a living. I was in an office and so on and I believed that one should go to an office and earn one's living in this way and wear suits, etcetera. And I was lucky enough to get a three-year fellowship at Leeds, which required of me nothing except that I should do my own writing. And a great deal of unnecessary and obsessional formalism began to disappear at this point. Because, you know, I'd been taken on my own abilities, as it were, or my own interests, rather than doing somebody else's job for them in an office hierarchy. And I think this produced in The Force a relaxation in subject-matter, because it al- lowed me more time for contemplation. I mean, I could work all day if I wanted to, instead of working as I did in office jobs: I used to get up at five-thirty in the morning in order to work, you see, before going to the office. Spent some time on benzedrine doing that. This was about fifteen or so years ago. And then recently my marriage broke up. This is an English middle-class story. English middle-class men of my generation are rather liable to marry the first women they sleep with, do you see. I was born in 1932 and I would have come to sexual awareness just shortly after the war. Very austere time, when tribal values were paramount, really, because you couldn't allow the healing energies which were trying to put England together to leak at all. So there was no question of any kind of permissiveness. So the influences brought to bear on the young people were really very very strong, particularly in this English middle-class sort of thing. So if you slept with a woman you would probably want to marry her, and I did. I was faithful to her for thirteen years. When I got out of the office jobs and the nine to twelve sort of thing, which was part of the tribal values (one's woman expected one to work in this fashion, whatever it did to one), with the Leeds thing all sorts of other powers and interests started to arrive. Including the inevitable love-affair, which sepa- rated me from those tribal values, since they represented-this love affair-the things which my marriage had left out. My wife was quite forgiving about this, do you see, but she really wanted to re- turn to the old state. And so did I, I think. But this was impossible and the thing got wilder and wilder and I started being seventeen</page><page sequence="4">THE HUDSON REVIEW instead of whatever I was-thirty-six, something like that-and slept with a great many people, which she got fed up with so she went off. On the other hand, you see, this liberated very many percep- tions which had been trained into these middle-class shapes. So it's a little piece of social history which, I'm very interested to discover, is matched for instance by a lot of the lives of my colleagues here at the art school, who are artists, who made similar kinds of mar- riages, had similar kinds of trouble about the same age. I think you find this generally among middle-class people who have become artists in England. ERWIN: Also I'd like to ask you what kind of lasting effects you feel were made on your work by the insulin-shock comas? REDGROVE: Well, this is a very strange business. It's entirely dou- ble. As Empson says, "ambiguous gifts as what the gods give must be". Well, the exact equivalent is an acid trip, I think. You see, we didn't have LSD at that time, there was no LSD at all. There was no hash, no pot either, for that I had to go to Spain later on. I used to get a great deal of psychedelic adventure on liquor. Then I went into the army, I had this experience, and I was a very obsessionally tidy sort of person. The army was obviously too much, so I said I'd lost my memory, in order to get out of it. But I started telling the psychiatrist some of the things that had happened to me, which were no more than the distortions of ingrown virginity. And a doc- tor said, "I can't quite understand you, you must be schizophrenic or you must have incipient schizophrenia. Therefore we'll try on you this new treatment, insulin shock." I said, oh I don't care, if I get out. It was only very much later I realized how barbarous it was. Because they draw all the sugar out of your blood till you go into convulsions and then into a coma; then they bring you back again. Nobody knows why this works for schizophrenics, whoever they are. There's no diagnostic category of incipient schizophrenia. Nowadays they give you drugs instead, which is much more beastly, I think, really. It was quite unnecessary in my case. I mean, I meet students every day who suffered from little obses- sional fears like I had. And they gave me this thing. And the myth of it is that you die and are reborn. And that's exactly what hap- pened. I remember being taken to pieces and put together again. And subsequently I've learned that some such experience, when it happens to people, often liberates great tracts of their lives. When I 380</page><page sequence="5">JED RASULA AND MIKE ERWIN started writing poetry, for what reason I don't know . . . Oh yes, that was erotic too! The first time it happened was the first time I slept with the girl who became my wife. There was a great peace in my head and into it came the lines of a poem. So that was the first poem. When I was doing this, starting to write poetry, I thought to myself, "Who am I, with my middle-class background and no ex- perience of life or anything, to be writing poetry?"And then I said to myself, "But I've been dead fifty times. I have something to say." And, of course, later on one learns that many kinds of artists, adventurers of the mind, have had this sort of experience. Up there's the book on Shamanism by Eliade: the shaman always suffers an initiation of this kind. Graham Greene talks about his Russian roulette. I'm not comparing myself to these people. Herman Melville had this experience of falling on the deck, but the ship keeled over and he went in the water instead; but he saw the grain of the wood. And it was a reprieve made Dostoyevsky go out "queer and clear" I think Empson says. And younger people nowa- days, if they don't find a death and rebirth out of their family situa- tion or out of their adolescence threshold (society doesn't provide thresholds for us), they cut their wrists or go on an acid trip or many acid trips. They will have a time of such exploration. And this happened to me quite inadvertantly, you know, without my seeking. And it gave me a root in a kind of experience which was both of death and erotic in nature. So it had, I think, an important effect. But I still think it was a barbarous thing to do to a young man of eighteen. RASULA: There's an interesting level of anthropomorphism, I think, in In the Country of the Skin, which is suggestive to me of the organic nature of poetry and language. One of the passages is a description of crabs: They mate, with the sound of typewriters. The tide is returning, they retreat to their caves. They have written their page on the sand, as a pack of cards writes its game on the baize table. The tide is coming like hands to gather up the writing. And in another passage a description of a tree, where you say: A tree throws down its library of books every autumn, it throws out all these books, and it grows new ones. A tree takes off its brain, throws it to the ground. It shatters. A new brain grows. 381</page><page sequence="6">THE HUDSON REVIEW And in both cases there is an element of ritual, possibly, which I think is related to human activity. And I wonder if I'd be correct in thinking that you see poetry as having an actual organic relation to other creative forces and cycles? REDGROVE: Certainly. You're absolutely right. I do. It's the signature of all things, isn't it? I mean, this is God's handwriting or nature's handwriting that you read. What you write in a book is only one variety of organic growth, organic life. Poetry, insofar as it has to do with visionary matters as opposed to (well, I don't think it can be opposed to social matters), but directly in visionary matters, the visions are visions of matter. I'm a materialist, you see, but I'm a materialist in the Hindu tradition, which regards matter as a song. This is not so far from contemporary physics, of course. What we're made of is a complex vibration. Poetry does vibrate, it is a pattern of vibrations. I say I'm a materialist: for instance, I have great sympathy with the French neurophysiologists who maintain that dreams are a replay of the genetic code. I find the conceptual link between mind and matter a very easy one. I find no division between mind and body; I am not a Cartesian man. I find that it is very easy to think of matter as being conscious on a molecular level. All sorts of things come from this. It's to do with being originally trained as a scientist, I think. It's this notion that, for instance, you hold a golf ball in your hand: now, the relation in size between this golf ball and the earth is the same as that between the ball and a molecule in your body. In other words, your body is a world. How do the inhabitants of this world communicate with the anima mundi which you call your personality? Of course, they communicate by means of dreams and visions. There's a very strange experiment which I've written about in the new novel. The Terrors of Doctor Treviles, and which is completely authenticated and absolutely respectable. And it has to do with warts. Warts are a variety of benign cancer, of course, and probably a combination of allergic and viral disease, and there have always been legends about warts that they could be charmed away. You know, you could go to the chemist and have your name put in the wart book and they would disappear, you would pay a penny. And there are wart charmers here in Cornwall. My colleague here, Lionel Miskin, has taken his family to a wart charmer and the warts went-mind you, they came back again, but they went. And there is this man, this doctor, called Stephen Black; and I read this, many years ago when I used 382</page><page sequence="7">JED RASULA AND MIKE ERWIN to work in the offices, in the Lancet. It was part of my job to read the medical journals. And what he did was to get a considerable number of very warty patients in one hospital, and experiments properly supervised by doctors and nurses and so on. And some people have warts so badly that they're in agony from it, they can't move in their clothes without these things turning over on their skin. And he got a good deep-trance hypnotist there, and in full view of all these doctors and nurses he had the hypnotist say to the patients (perfectly controlled experiment), "The warts on the left hand side of your body will disappear and the ones on the right will remain." Lo and behold it happened. Properly supervised; it was written up in the Lancet, and there is nothing more respectable. The implications of this experiment are enormous. Later on he wrote a book called Mind and Body in which he explored these im- plications. What it amounts to is that the voice changes molecular structure; the voice, in trance, communicates down to the molecular level. Thus, the shapes of the proteins, which have to do with the antigen manufacture, which fit together like keys and locks, were altered by the voice of the hypnotist. Or by the body of the subject responding to the voice of the hypnotist. Therefore there is in certain states of mind-visionary states of mind-a com- munication between what you call the mesocosm, the size-scale of things we inhabit, and the scale of the very very small. This links up in a gratifying manner with Ouspensky's notion that when we look for God we look for Him in the wrong place. We look for him in the heavens-well, he's there as everywhere else. But where we should look for him is in the very small. It's in one of his discussions about further dimensions, one of his fourth dimension/fifth dimension discussions. He says that the freedom of other dimensions is at the level of the very very small. There is a paper by J.B.S. Haldane which I had the pleasure of bringing to the attention of Arthur Koestler (after reading his book Roots of Coincidence) in which Haldane maintains that the brain has its ability for apparent deci- sion of free will as sub-atomic particles seem to in a sense, because it is a magnifier of quantal events. We've got a very marvellous con- tinuum here. Koestler's own book The Roots of Coincidence, of course, was about the strange similarity between the science of ESP and psychic research and the science of sub-atomic physics. He didn't make the conceptual connection between the two, that in fact the scientists and the investigators were talking about the same worlds. But he might very well have done. I wrote to him about it and he 383</page><page sequence="8">THE HUDSON REVIEW said yes. Do you see how this means that when we are in a visionary state we are seeing the world? The shaman is not a man who doubts (this is a mistake made in later Greek thought), is not a man who separates his mind from his body and goes into the universe and flies away like an angel, as Blake knew very well. He's not that sort of man at all. He's a man that goes into the universe of his body, and in the universe of the body all the forces that make us are com- piled. That is, we are a focus of many many forces in the world. So if we investigate ourselves, we investigate the world. So I'm a materialist. I can't remember your question (laughing). RASULA: Well, that comes around to it in an interesting way. Do you think that poetry is a necessary focussing on the life of bodies and the components, the forces, that are centered there? REDGROVE: Poetry is life talking to itself in its own language. Said Novalis. RASULA: Yes, that's in In the Country of the Skin. REDGROVE: I think Novalis originally said it. But I certainly said it in In the Country of the Skin. This notion, incidentally, is in a very respectable tradition. You can read Wordsworth, you can read Shakespeare (Midsummer Night's Dream), you can read Rilke, you can read Novalis, I think HOlderlin, all in this tradition. There's a book which was a revelation to me when I read it after writing In the Country of the Skin, called The Orphic Voice, by Elizabeth Sewell. She talks about a line of poets, inherent in whose beliefs is that poetry is not mere ornamentation but is actually about something which is important to us and actually can affect not only the way we think, the way we feel, but the way we grow, and the way that things grow around us. Magic, in other words. For some reason Christianity doesn't like this sort of thing. Of course, Christianity has to separate itself from the world in order to bring about the rise of technology, for whatever purpose that was; personally I think it was to invent organic chemistry and thereby contrive the birth pill, which renders women independent creatures and their own mistresses in- stead of chattels of men. I could be wrong about this (laughing). Christianity, which is a male-oriented religion with a triple male in the sky, was perhaps invented by women in order that the birth pill 384</page><page sequence="9">JED RASULA AND MIKE ERWIN 385 might be discovered. And now, if that's true, we've got the birth pill: we don't need Christianity. RASULA: On the dust-jacket of In the Country of the Skin there's men- tion of a hope that your work might lead other people as well as yourself into what you call "a neurosis-free world." Do you feel this as a driving impulse behind the writing of your work or more as a hope for what you've already finished? REDGROVE: Well, I think poetry ought to have a healing function. I can't really hope that mine could do what I want in this respect, but it looks in this direction. I would think that somebody who had gone through the experience of In the Country of the Skin would have gone through what I went through in writing it, which was a very healing process. It's as simple as that. One goes through these things and one doesn't see them at a distance, one participates in them if it's a good book-if it's a strange book and a good book as well, which really draws you into it, it should have something of the same effect as the events it describes. Which for me were a trans- forming experience. I have, you see, through the years-partly through the practice of poetry and partly by the study of psychology-lost a lot of neuroses, I mean, lost a lot of quite gross clinical troubles. I had these two years of study with this old gentleman John Layard, which were extraordinarily revealing to me and liberating. And I believe that a lot of the baggage and hang- ups that people carry around with them are in fact dispensable. It's simply a matter of inhibition: there's something which is standing between them and their proper natures. I'm reminded of Eliot's re- mark in this respect. He said inspiration is not something which descends on you, he says it is more like an inhibition to inspiration being taken away; it's more like something being taken away which interferes with the proper state of your mind which is inspiration. The proper state of mind is inspiration. And having lived in a state of ec- stasy in writing that book-not by writing it, but living in a state of ecstasy and being a writer writing about it for this quite extended time-in a state of continued inspiration which, in my case, may be of a fairly archaic kind, but is open-ended-I believe that this state is available to people. It's a state in which the mind is not separated from the body; it's a state in fact of being in love with the world without ignoring anything about it. Many of the psychedelics give</page><page sequence="10">THE HUDSON REVIEW accounts of this sort of world. I think it's one's birthright, I think this is mankind's birthright. And what we call neurosis is the im- pediment to existence in this state. And of course neuroses can be external as well as internal-they can be social neuroses. They can be social habits which are unexplored abuses, doors in the mind which shut off avenues of exploration, because growth is painful. RASULA: There's something quite related to that from In the (Country of the Skin that I'd like to read and ask you about. You say there that: Poetry is the calculus of growth, and intuition is how we articulated ourselves through all those dangers, and the final shock-gate of growth, the birth, where most of us forget ourselves, forever. No one can deceive themselves, or be mad themselves, or become insane. They can be out of contact with it, shocked back into life which is too much for the grey shocked core called brain. And a few pages later you say: Not sex only, not magick only, not poetry only, not madness at all, but womb-talk, the first conversations of the growing spirit with the life that lives it and the death it will die into life with its bride the earth. And I'd like to explore a bit more this notion of poetry as the calculus of growth. And whether you think that is the way in which poetry has its most effective healing properties. REDGROVE: Of course, that passage has specifically to do with the sort of materialism I was talking about. There is something that must be here, and that is pre-natal experience. You see, I think poetry, the calculus of growth, art generally, is the reflection or the top end, as it were, of the processes that grew us. This is why I say that dreams or poetry are a replay of the genetic code. Something happens to us. We went through nine million years of evolution in nine months in our mothers' wombs, but we've forgotten it for the main part. It seems that in art quite often, particularly when the times are such that nothing seems to be declaring it outside, and people have to go within, that there is a capacity for remembering back into pre-natal experience, or into very fine physical detail. I think one of the first times I noticed this was when I was looking at the paintings of a student here, and he was drawing a cellular struc- ture, a muscular structure, at photo-micrographic enlargement. 386</page><page sequence="11">JED RASULA AND MIKE ERWIN And I happened to recognize this because I did a histology course at Cambridge. And I saw this thing and I said, "That's very in- teresting, where did you get this?" He was quite offended, he said, "It's an abstract." I said, "That's fine, but can I show you the book?" So I came up here and got the book of histology off the shelf and took it down to show him. He said, "My God, yes!" And this actually helped his drawing, you see, because we've got a microscope here and he looked at the tissues. What was amazing about this was that shortly afterwards he started suffering pains in his leg and his leg muscles started to wither for an unexplained reason. He couldn't get any treatment for this. It was shortly after painting this. Now, I think (there's other evidence for this too) I think that what he was drawing or painting was his leg going wrong, because those were the tissues that were affected. Now, this ability to see within in specific and exact ways, I mean, it's almost medical, isn't it! What a diagnostic instrument! I'm quite serious about this. Now Waddington, the embryologist, has written a book on modern art in which he gives a parallel (I don't think he goes quite as far as I just did), but he says that the organic forms that painters discover in much modern art may have to do with an ability to look into cellular structures. He's an embryologist. Why is he writing on modern art? Perhaps even further. We forget what hap- pens in the womb, and yet because of this recapitulation of evolu- tion, because of our own growth from molecular structures, because of the bringing together of the world in food and focussed in this womb we're grown in, there's a most extraordinary extent of magical knowledge possible. What we call magical knowledge, but it's only natural. This is lost at the birth trauma, only remembered by such explorations as art and poetry provide into the uncon- scious. You cannot understand people's dreams, you cannot go through a psychoanalytic session, without realizing that pre-natal experiences are being depicted in dreams, without realizing a change of scale which has to do with experience at a different level of size and intensity. And what is more, without understanding or allowing yourself to be open to the notion of telepathic and pre- cognitive experience also (which seems to happen at this womb- level, this molecular level). Now, what poetry does as a meditation instrument is to accustom one's mind to the mutations which are natural on these levels of being which our ordinary mental con- structs do not allow ourselves to consider. Many people, for in- stance the psychologist Otto Rank, believe that a hero was a person 387</page><page sequence="12">THE HUDSON REVIEW for whom the birth-trauma had not been amnesic, a person who had not forgotten his womb-life. I remember also reading a sugges- tion by one commentator about circumcision. He maintained (it was only a suggestion, he said) that the reason why God insisted so much on circumcision was because it was a trauma. The Jews are great poets and prophets. The beginning of their history started with God stamping his feet and shouting at Abraham, didn't he, that the sign of his covenant was circumcision. Why? Desert hygiene? The Arabs don't circumcise until puberty. The Jews are the only people who circumcise the baby at eight days. The only people. So, why was God so insistent about it? The suggestion here is that it sets up a trauma. If you cut the penis, you (as all wounds do) energize the nervous system appertaining to those organs before, of course, the reproductive organs are mature. So what you do is to set up an ego-structure. By means of this wound you awake very early. You set it up against the birth-trauma, which is a terrible nightmare we try to forget. But the circumcision sets up a memory, an ego, shortly after that time, only eight days. This com- mentator's suggestion was that people who were not circumcised were more susceptible to mob effects, you see, collective effects, than the Jews, who are individualists. The effect of circumcision is to set up an ego structure, so that you stand as an individual in rela- tion to the birth trauma, rather than there being an undifferen- tiated force in your psyche. RASULA: In In the Country of the Skin everything is alive, to my percep- tion of it, everything. And as you say, even on a molecular level. In fact, human life only seems to be finding itself in terms of the other life it's near to and often is. In your poetry also the sense of life isn't tied to the human orientation or human interpretation, by any means. Most of the work in Dr Faust's Sea-Spiral Spirit is like this, and even some poems in The Force ("The Young Forester Protests," "Really Gone," and "A Testament" are poems which I see in this way). And this really vigorous vitalistic approach to the world is very interesting in relation to a point made by Marie Peel in writing about your work, in which she notes a lack of social reference, and I'd like to ask what you feel about that? With regard to your work, what sorts of responsibilities do you feel, or pressures, to introduce a kind of articulated social awareness? REDGROVE: Well, I mean I'm only forty-one; you can't do 388</page><page sequence="13">JED RASULA AND MIKE ERWIN everything at once, can you? My attitude to that, really, is that you should get yourself right, before getting the rest right. Though, of course, you may have to sacrifice yourself in the interest of the revolution, but as an artist I don't think this is the priority. You see, over the years I've had to work from inside out; like many artists I'm haunted by certain images which stand between me and my proper life. They contain the life, but they stand in front of it. These images have to be gone through. The only way out is through in these cases. This is what I mean by neurosis. With an artist, he's not a neurotic; the neurosis gives him images: they are doorways, they are thresholds. It's only fairly recently that I've been able to understand how these images that have haunted and obsessed my life have arisen not only from my own psychic structures (if there is such a thing, as I think there is) but have also been socially con- ditioned. We were talking about the war and the English middle- classes. I can see how my life, as is the case with many of my friends and colleagues, is an image of society also. I have a growing and forward-looking sense of responsibility about this. I believe, for in- stance, that if in writing poetry I discover or depict anything of value it is my business to relate this as far as possible to what people understand in their usual lives. This is the reason why I made the novel The Terrors of Dr Treviles, which I've written with Penelope Shuttle, almost an explanatory novel. It is not, I trust, a lecture. But it's like In the Country of the Skin with explanations. I don't know whether it's more or less effective because of the explanations. But it seemed to me that people who understood In the (,ountry of the Skin understood it because of a sympathy of temperament. I would rather like people who do not have a sympathy of temperament to understand the matters that I was talking about and had ex- perienced myself. So that's a responsibility. For example, Freud says the root of neurosis is the refusal to die. My image bearing on this is the idea of the Eleusinian Mysteries. Now what exactly hap- pened in the Eleusinian Mysteries has been lost. It deteriorated and disappeared. But there was something in these rites that changed the people who went through them. This ceremony was at the heart of Greek culture, of Greek civilization, which is still with us. It was the thing that caused Greece to be the civilization that it was. Peo- ple went through it: they learned something about death which removed anxiety. There are contemporary hymns which say that the person who has been through the Mysteries is fortunate be- cause he doesn't evaporate like the other ghosts, but has learned 389</page><page sequence="14">THE HUDSON REVIEW something about death, about the other side. And what obviously happened is that anxiety was removed, to use contemporary terms. Therefore the people were free to grow into themselves. What was this thing that they learned? Something about death. Perhaps that death is more alive than what we call life. Something. Perhaps, I thought that In the Country of the Skin was a pale shadow of this, that it showed that everything was alive. This is what I mean, I think: that it is the poet's responsibility, perhaps, to discover and reproduce the kind of thing that was going on in the Eleusinian Mysteries. ERWIN: Do you think a relatively neurosis-free individual is pos- sible? REDGROVE: Yes. I've met them occasionally (laughing). ERWIN: Are there destructive things attached to not being neurotic? REDGROVE: Yes, because these people almost always involve others in their lives. I think they're people who give a great reflection. Omar Khayyam remarked (not, I think, in the Rubaiyat, but somewhere else) that, "I am he who gives a perfect reflection of you," and I think that neurosis-free people do tend to do this. And so if you see a reflection of yourself in this person, you want to fol- low it. You have a feeling that something can be changed. You have a feeling that they understand. Perhaps they don't. Perhaps it's only the reflection that you get. They can give this reflection because they have this mirror-mind, this ability to reflect without greed, without holding on. They seem to those of us who still have much attachment to ourselves and to usual things to be heartless, because wherever they are fills them, including you. But you need not necessarily be in their mind, as a portion of their being, if you're not there. In other words they don't hang on. Yes, I've met people like this. I think they're people clearly of a most extraordinary and rewarding kind to be with. The only thing is, they love, but you're not the only person they love. So they're inclined to produce jealousies. I mean, I'm describing something which is fairly rare among men but fairly common among women, I think. Mind you, this is a complex subject. The statement I think I'm properly mak- ing is that the mind, the psyche, is a very inventive place. It invents in the mode that we distinguish inappropriately as something 390</page><page sequence="15">JED RASULA AND MIKE ERWIN apart, as poetry- it invents in this mode. If a person is damaged or if a person has been rendered too vulnerable or had too bright a light shone on his psyche, he will have a stasis there. And this we call a neurosis or an obsession. He is less likely to suffer from this if he is accustomed to the way his mind, his psyche, works. One way of investigating this is called poetry. The corollary of this is that a study of poetry will cure by making the reactions more fluid. Dis- solving the scotoma, it will cure neurosis. It's a corollary. When I say poetry, it can be oral poetry, it can be a rite performed in some open place or in a church, or it can be the improvisation a gifted analyst gives on one's dreams. For instance, the man I've men- tioned, John Layard, when he interpreted dreams it was spoken poetry: he improvised on the dream, do you see. ERWIN: In talking about the involvement of the voice in poetry, what effect do you think conscious effort at control has, in writing the poem? REDGROVE: Well, I mean, the banal image is riding a bicycle, isn't it? I find, myself, that it's a condition that one musn't ask too hard because that's pre-judging the question; one musn't pull too hard on the strings, as they break; one musn't assume anything; one must be receptive but not yet critical-no, one is both receptive and critical. It's like holding a very good conversation with another person, and in a conversation you have to behave with manners. I mean, if I keep on interrupting you, we'll have no conversation. And vice versa. It's very much like that, I find. I think there are also three very interesting things that happen, stages as it were. There's the stage when you write with exhilaration. Now, the results of that may be very good or very bad. One is improvising with exhilaration or feels very good-there may be incidental beauties among a whole nonsense. This is the jungle that one can invent before one explores, or it may be complete nonsense. One writes with exhilara- tion, and the result has no necessary relation to the exhilaration. That is one way. And another way is that one can write in depres- sion, one can have something to write (perhaps something one has drafted) and one can feel very depressed about it. This is the con- trol, you see, one can say, "I will write this out. Maybe I'll not do anything with it. Let's see. Let's see what happens." And it's very depressing, but you just have to do it. You do that. Now, the curious thing about that is that the results are usually better than 391</page><page sequence="16">THE HUDSON REVIEW you'd expect. The depression is in fact, I think, your truly critical abilities at work. Your mental energy is withdrawn into itself for the purposes of work, and one musn't expect reward until the work is done. That's the second way. There is a third way, where all these processes of control and reception seem to be fused and become another person, and that person writes for you. The magi- cians call this (I think this is what they're talking about) the con- versation of the holy guardian angel. This is the title for the ex- perience. I think it's the same experience. But there questions of control and receptivity are quite irrelevant. There is somebody who is able to accomplish this work and does it. Now, these are mysteries of course, but what I'm saying about a neurosis-free state has something to do with what the magicians call conversations with the holy guardian angel. It's like supposing Rimbaud had decided not to turn his back on it, it's the "I is another," of course. I think the artist experiences all three ways. You know, whatever stage they may be, in various degrees, I think it's valuable to know what's happening. A lot of people get terribly excited in the writing, and they say "It must be all right because I'm excited about it" and that's a very bad kind, I think. If you're depressed in the writing that is a slightly better guide that something may be going on. Can't explain this. But the third experience is what I think is one's birthright, really. And it happens to many people in many ways, but is a very remarkable and superb experience. ERWIN: What particular elements in a poem or poetry do you feel are important, say, like rhythm or visual imagery or assonance? Particular elements that you find are really essential for your poetry. REDGROVE: It's something that John Castor calls the strength of the sentence. But this is begging the question, because the strength of a sentence may be rhythmical, it may be grammatical in for instance the way in which a sentence may be particularly declarative because it's relatively simple, or because it's complex in a way in which the clauses run against each other; you know, the cross- ways. But it is something very sculptural, I think. When I read a good poem the first sensation of pleasure that I have is of strength in the sentences. That is the first sensation. This is a thing that one can see very quickly, of course, in looking at poetry. It's not the final pleasure, it's the doorway into the other pleasures for me. 392</page><page sequence="17">JED RASULA AND MIKE ERWIN After this I distinguish. My pleasure expands and takes various forms within the poem. That's the first sensation, and it's the thing I want in my own poems. If I can see in my own poems that I have made sentences which are strong, then I feel I've done something. And when I look at a recent poem to see whether I've done it right, I don't look at whether I've got the thought right or whether I've got the rhythm right, I try to get that sensation of ah! it's there. So really, I'm substituting one terminology for another, but I can only say that: it's the strength of the sentences. And I don't quite know what that means. It's a position in space, it's as though the sentence is a space which is filled with dynamic energies which either hold still or interact. It's as though in the sentence there was a transac- tion which was taking place. As though there was in the poem an articulate energy (Donald Davie's words) transmitting itself from sentence to sentence and from one part of the sentence to another in various ways. Causing various pressures and lightenings and darkenings as it does so.-It's a very material, physical thing. It has to do with structure. And that's the only answer I can give without faking up a lot of remarks about beat and rhythm. I used to think it was something to do with a four- or three-beat line which didn't fuss about how many syllables it had in it. Which is of course sprung rhythm-Hopkins and more loosely Four Quartets, going back to Langland and the pre-Chaucerian things like Gawayne and so on. These kinds of sounds. I think it's important to me that poetry not sound Chaucerian; I'm a non-Chaucerian in this sense. RASULA: In the past few years you've branched out into a variety of forms that are developments beyond the short-poem form you used for your first three or four books. There's the novel, the pieces for voices, a radio-play, and The Hermaphrodite Album with Penelope Shuttle and now another novel with her. And I wonder if you see this development, this branching-out, as just occurring over a period of time out of the necessities of things that had to be said and were coming to be said in other than the short-poem form? Or whether this reflects an actual change in your thinking about what can be done in the various forms? REDGROVE: Well, I always believed that the short-poem form could say everything. In a sense I still do. There's a double answer to this, really, because I've always been afraid of all sorts of things-all of us are. One of the things I was afraid of was writing prose. The 393</page><page sequence="18">THE HUDSON REVIEW reason for this is for ten years I earned my living in advertising and journalism. And in order to keep my poetry going I had to separate off the kind of writing I used to earn my living from the real things which, for me at that time, could only be short poems. This was partly due to my idea of prose writing being connected with educational things like examinations and economic things like earning one's living. But poetry has nothing to do with earning one's living, nor with purposes related to that, related to the cor- rupt capitalist structure that we live in. So I separated off the prose. Now, when I finally was able to bring to mind some things like the insulin shock thing, which of course you're made terribly ashamed of-this is another of the middle-class things. If you do something like that, if you go mad for a short time or pretend to go mad for a short time, you are of course ostracized-if you come out with it. If you're quiet about it they'll tolerate you. Though it's an awfully useful weapon for one's relatives to use. If they happen to disagree with you they can always say "oh he's mad again" or something like this, you see. So I kept the insulin shock thing and various other preoccupations which occur in that book In the Country of the Skin very quietly to myself. And it was only as a result of meeting John Layard and meeting Penelope Shuttle that I ceased to be ashamed of these things. At the same time I ceased to be afraid of writing in prose. Thus writing in prose didn't seem to carry penalties and rewards of a monetary kind. So I was able to assimilate the prose thing to the poetry thing. So you see, once again my answer is rather than select one or two alternatives I have to give you both at once. Because both of your alternatives are true. It's both what I found it necessary to say and what I thought the poetry could talk about, or what my poetry could talk about. Both at once. RASULA: Another characteristic of your later work, I think, is its more directive-possibly moralistic-quality, or its willingness to make statements, definitions and judgements. In the poem "Direc- tive" in The Force you say "Attend to the outer world." And in terms of the Jonas/Silas dichotomy, the mud-world/magic world dualism, there is a tendency to favor Silas because, to quote from that book, "Jonas wanted to make maps of this, Silas wanted to live it." Do you agree that you have become, say, more directive in your work? And does this reflect an increasing sense of responsibility as a poet, or stronger convictions about the world which are now be- ing expressed in this way? 394</page><page sequence="19">JED RASULA AND MIKE ERWIN REDGROVE: Stronger convictions about the world, with which go some responsibilities as I tried to say earlier. This goes with the previous question also. One of the reasons for writing poetry is that, as I was saying about Dante last night-it doesn't matter if you're a Catholic when you read Dante. I mean, you may think its a pack of lies, but still it's marvellous. It's as though if you write a good poem nobody can argue with it. It's as though opinions and the relativity of human opinion from one person to another doesn't matter. And in writing those shorter earlier poems, I was finding an area among all the disagreements of life where there was no disagreement. And at that time I used to think that I had no opinions, no declaration to make. I thought this might be related to what Keats calls negative capability. I realize now that this is partly true, but it's partly an evasion. Since the things about which I should have had strong opin- ions were the things on which I was turning my back, such as the irrelevance and horror of the tribal social structure. And the reason why I didn't have opinions, or a direction in a general sense, was because I refused to consider these matters. I refused to consider, for instance, that marriage to one person and bringing up a family were not necessarily centrally important things, and that one could change them. That one's masters and employers were not always right. See, I'm very stupid, for a long time I believed everything that everybody told me. And I found in poetry that there was no sense in which these things might be important, and that there might be an unbearable conflict; that in poetry, in making the poems which were of course about all of this obliquely, is where there was a reconciliation. But I could not intellectually face the consequences of being alive in this country at this time. As a result of these various events I've mentioned I'm now better able to face this, and to understand that much of what I was about before, though true within its own terms, was also something of an evasion. I think that's about it. But of course this happens to everybody as they grow. At first you're in the family home, and if you write poetry because your father is always arguing with you or always trying to put you down and this poetry is a place where there's no question of argument, this is your business for the time. If you stay there and things start to putrefy, well then you stink. I certainly began to stink (laughing), I probably stink a bit differently now. I have a view of life, or a hypothesis of life now, which the evidence doesn't seem to contradict. And at that time I had a partial view of life which, had I opened myself to other evidence, would have been full of con- 395</page><page sequence="20">THE HUDSON REVIEW tradictions. I suffered many severe neurotic symptoms because of this evasion. And writing poetry of course was one of the ways in which I came in relation to these things. I mustn't say understand them-to come into relation with them rather than to avoid them, as I believe many of my contemporaries do. I don't wish to make it seem as if I bring myself above them in this respect: I'm an infant taking steps. But I mean, some people just don't get born at all, really. RASULA: I wonder what your sense of audience is, whether you write for a particular individual or a group of people or another aspect of yourself or what? Or how all these things revolve. Earlier you men- tioned that in The Hermaphrodite Album you and Penelope were writing these poems to each other, each partially in a process of becoming the other. And I wonder what other sense of a reader you may have? REDGROVE: I think my answer may once again appear to beg the question. I write for people who understand the language. I write for people who, in more banal terms perhaps, love the language and respond to it very profoundly. These are the people I write for, because writing for such people or such a person I learn myself. This is why feedback in relationship with the audience is impor- tant. Because you're learning all the time. I think in writing for such a person, if language is something that grows organically, one is writing for life itself. So one could say in that case that one is writing for the muse. This would be the direction that it takes; and this is true too, one way of putting it. But the simple one is for peo- ple who understand the language. Is it an educational purpose? I write to the best of my understanding. I think Graves puts this well-he says he writes for the muse, but he also says he sometimes writes for elder poets. He says that he writes for John Skelton. Now, you're perfectly sure John Skelton understands the language. That is, he won't-becuase he can't respond to a grammatical movement or an image-say the poem's no good. He will be able to see what the poem intends, because he loves and understands the language. And that's a good person to write for. I don't write for Bob Dylan, say, because I'm perfectly sure that Bob Dylan understands rather a narrow spectrum of the language. I don't write for people who don't read books or listen to each other but sit in a trance in front of television when they've finished their work at the office. I don't 396</page><page sequence="21">JED RASULA AND MIKE ERWIN 397 write for those people. I mean, I don't think I can write a television play, for instance. But I do write for people who listen to the radio, sometimes. I mean, it doesn't really beg the question, that answer. Have I a revolutionary notion of audience? A cultural unity in the world? Yes, but I find this a remote ideal, practically speaking. People I write for are also people from whom I can learn. Which is the feedback thing. Obviously some of the people I'm writing for are persons like yourself who are interested enough in my work to come and ask me about it. This is somebody I write for. I don't know them in advance. And how very excellent it is to discover that somebody is interested in what one has said! So it's a help. So I've been writing for you. I'd better write better. That's it, that's it, that's the answer-the question's like a dream (laughing), it's like a dream: and somebody says, "Who's your audience, who do you write for?" I should just roll in laughter and say you! (laughing). I once had a dream in which my parents were in the kitchen, and they were saying, "What's all this about the unconscious, then? What is the unconscious? Tell me what the unconscious is. Never heard of such a thing. What is it?" And I was very carefully ex- plaining to them all the theories from Charcot onwards, because I'd been lecturing on psychology rather foolishly-one shouldn't lec- ture on psychology. And I told this dream to somebody and he said, "That's nonsense, you should have rolled in laughter and pointed at them and said YOU, you're the unconscious!" You see, because one's mother and father were the people concerned. Now this is a different order of things: you are the conscious, I'm the un- conscious (laughter). But we turn and turn about here, this is the proper relationship. RASULA: Insofar as you can be aware of what effect you have on a reader, are you more interested in provoking thought and awareness-widening perceptions of the reader-or in conveying and provoking a sense of responsibility? Or do you think this is a false division? REDGROVE: I think it's a false division. I think awareness implies responsibility. To put it quite simply, I have experiences of wholeness and awareness which are brought about to me when I am in that area of things which has to do with my writing. It may be that I may achieve that in my writing, a sense that I am one and better than I usually am, more aware, more advanced, more able, a</page><page sequence="22">THE HUDSON REVIEW better person altogether. This is associated with my writing. When I read other people's poems it produces that state in me. So I think it's not unreasonable to suppose that if I write a good poem it will produce that state in other people. And I don't regard anything I've done as either final or my best work, because . .. Who would? I'd much rather be Shakespeare, but Shakespeare is done, he's done Shakespeare. I haven't done mine yet. ERWIN: What about the overall effect of the arts on the world? What kind of conditioning effects do you think art has had on time and man, any? REDGROVE: Yes. I think art-forms are responsible for the develop- ment of historical fact. I think societies take certain interior decisions-which may not appear to them to be decisions but rather insights-and the society develops accordingly. I hold an op- posite belief not to Marx himself, who would allow this, but to many Marxists. For instance, what I was saying about the Jews conceiving a God who requires a certain circumcision. If this is true, if the psychological notion is true, and it would be very sur- prising if circumcision did not have a profound psychological effect on a child, and since they're the only race to do this circumcision so early, it would account for (not so much account for as explain)- but it would be a seeding point of their history. But to decide to in- tuit this necessity is an artistic decision. I don't mean an aesthetic decision: I mean, you don't decide that a penis looks better without a foreskin. I mean an artistic decision, a decision by image, by an image which conflates thought, feeling, sensation and intuition, all four faculties at once, and appears as a vision. When the Greeks "invented" Zeus, who was originally the sound of the dawn arising, the sound of the dawn wind, the word "zeus" meant first light. This was a moment between darkness and light where there was insight, where a world was entered in which many consequences were glimpsed which could not be known by ordinary methods of going about the world, which are linear methods. This moment between darkness and light was where many things were seen, many things that the Greeks saw in their own natures that were seen in advance. You can put it as un-metaphysically as that, if you like, though I think more is involved. And these events being seen at this moment so far into the future could only be told in the figure of a god called Zeus, whose attributes and figure and emblem guided the develop- ment of Greek history. I think this is how art works. Now, you can't 398</page><page sequence="23">JED RASULA AND MIKE ERWIN 399 there make a difference between prophetic religion and the emblems which express it, which will require artists for their mak- ing. And only if you make a distinction between Aaron and Moses can you say that the prophet is not an artist. I'm talking about the Schoenberg thing where Moses can hardly speak and hears the in- sights, so Aaron speaks for him. I think this is very much a later division, this is a contemporary division between a person who is a person of insight and the person who expresses the insight. I think this is not what we want, if we can avoid it, not what we're working towards. ERWIN: You don't agree with Auden's comment, then, that the history of man would have been the same if Shakespeare and Mozart had never lived? REDGROVE: Well, it's a most arrogant remark, that. I mean, I don't know why he likes to shit on himself like this. How can he possibly know? And isn't it much more likely that it has altered as a result of these people seeing very deeply into the psyche? Isn't it much more likely that Goethe, discerning in his own psyche and the psyche of his culture the collective psyche, the myth of Faust, has enabled people to focus on their own desires and their own mistakes much more clearly than if he hadn't written? I think the evidence is all against Auden's remark. Certainly with the individual the proces- ses of development and growth into oneself are related, I believe, to what happens in poetry. The books one reads, the experiences one has, the shocks of recognition one has in seeing likenesses between a person who's written a long time ago and oneself. All these things affect the individual. What prevents them from affecting the collec- tive? Why should Auden make such a remark? I'm not aware that he justifies this view. I mean, a lot of writers on political history do attempt to maintain this, you know, that writers as individuals did not have much effect on the collective. But I don't think this is a view of history that can be maintained. One does have leaders and leaders who are poets. ERWIN: One last question. How does the idea of poetry as sacred ac- tivity accommodate you? Do you find it has often, say, surpassed or supplanted the role of traditional religion? REDGROVE: Poetry's clearly a branch of religion. For myself, all the things that official religion ought to be about is in poetry. If we had</page><page sequence="24">THE HUDSON REVIEW a proper religion, that is, a psychologically useful religion in this country, it would be of course highly poetic. Once again I seem to be begging the question, don't I? What poetry is about is what is commonly called sacred. One can use any number of terms for this sense of the sacramental in existence, that everything that one does is very very real, that either within or without one there are per- sonages who are full of knowledge and perhaps more than what we call human, or perhaps more truly human, personages in nature who suddenly appear and disappear. All these things poetry has to do with, which are not only true matters but absolutely necessary. I say "psychologically useful." You see, we've forgotten that religion is for anything. What it's for-religion is only the name of becom- ing ourselves. But in this country at any rate our official religion doesn't have anything to do with anything actually going on, nothing to do with actual discoveries about yourself or other peo- ple. Only a rather stolid mode of conduct and moral prohibition. A religion, any religion worth its name, has to have women in it. Because half the world is. This is clear, and poetry's about women. One of the things it's about, of course. And the official religions leave sex out of it. I mean, it's all very well to have the four Gospels, but where are the sayings of Mary? Once again, to go back to earlier religions about that: the religions of Greece not only talked about the Zeus cult a little, but there was a Hera cult too. Now, the Hera cult (I musn't confuse her with the goddess of the hearth)- this was the goddess of womanhood, of I think they say matronhood. But at any rate what the Hera cult studied was the female menstrual cycle. That is, in this religion of Hera the woman was allowed, not discouraged, was allowed to contemplate the cyclical form of her own nature and her different abilities at various times of her monthly period, which was always related in the cults of Hera to the phases of the moon. Now, in antiquity it was held as a commonplace that a woman would menstruate with some relationship to the moon. This has been mocked by Joyce, who says if that's the case why don't all women bleed at once? Of course, if they live in community they do. He didn't seem to realize that, he was afraid of the subject, it's a taboo subject-there's nothing writ- ten on it. Jung, writing about the Miller phantasies (Miller was a woman). But you don't get any sense that a certain vision hap- pened at a certain time of the month. In fact, over the month the dreams tell a certain story. Which has to do with these archetypal fears. Well, the statisticians can't decide whether a woman menstruates with the moon or against it or what relationships there 400</page><page sequence="25">JED RASULA AND MIKE ERWIN are. Though there are varying accounts of this. The Swedish chemist Arrhenius did a survey on this, he said yes, the majority of women menstruated on the new moon. A recent German study confirms this; a North American study contradicts it. There is a Yugoslavian physician who claims 98% contraceptive technique-I think the scheme is that the woman ovulates at the phase of the moon that obtained when she was born. An empirical thing. But you see if you avoid sex then, and just have sex at other times of the moon's phases, there won't be conception. This is cheaper than the pill. This is one of the things that must have been taught in the Hera cult. These people did not contemplate the moon because it was irrelevant to them, but because it was profoundly important. Not only for mental knowledge, visionary knowledge of yourself in relation to the pulses of the universe, but practical household knowledge-that is, will you have sex, do you want a child at this time. Perhaps more, because there are legends that modern physi- cians are only just beginning to approach. That the two ovaries give (of course the modern idea is that the sperm determine the sex, but there's some doubt about that)-but the eggs come from alter- native ovaries. And there is some suggestion that conception related to certain aspects of the moon's phases would give you a boy or a girl, depending on what you wanted. This is very important inter- nal knowledge. And it's a kind of knowledge which no woman in our culture is provided with. In talking to students a woman says, "Oh I can't work, what shall I do? I'm finished as an artist." I say, "Well, I'm terribly sorry about this. What week are you in?" And she said "oh." And I say, "What do you like doing at this time?" She says she likes cooking. "It's your time to cook. Simple, isn't it?" I've seen people have dreams in which the egg they are making ap- pears in the dream. One very beautiful one was of an earring which was unused, put aside, a sparkling thing, very beautiful. But, you know, this is true knowledge which is hardly touched. Now, it's poetic knowledge. It's also what's right in front of one's nose. I had the librarian here check out what had been written on the subject- does a woman's psychology change according to her time and period? There's one paper in 1932, another a bit later on, the authorities on woman's psychology mention it hardly at all. But it's true. So that's an example of a practical religion which is poetic- useful and which is quite gone. It's one of the things Women's Lib is about, what Robert Graves calls the return of the goddess. He touches on the subject once in The White Goddess, he actually manages to mention menstruation. It's the taboo subject. 401</page></plain_text>
