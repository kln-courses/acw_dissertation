<plain_text><page sequence="1">WILLIAM H. PRITCHARD D. H. Lawrence's Poetry and Its Critics With these two volumes of D. H. Lawrence's poems, the Cam- bridge edition of his works, begun in 1979, will be complete in thirty-nine volumes. Just short of 1400 pages, the two volumes constitute a sort of monument to academic superstition that somehow the project is worth doing; to provide scholars - perhaps even mere readers - with definitive, probably final (for who could surpass it in labor and scholarly scruple?) presentation of a body of poems whose publishing history was, to say the least, complicated. Making one's way through the volumes, especially the second one of notes and apparatus, is a formidable task that your reviewer has performed with less than unwavering attention. The "apparatus" for each poem is full and forbidding; the explanatory comment dutiful but unadventurous. If ever there were an edition to be placed on the shelf and never again consulted, this would be the one.1 At any rate, it will in no way contribute to the debate - is it still going on? - about how much Lawrence's poems matter to an estimation of his work overall. His reputation in general holds only a portion of the supreme regard it held five or six decades ago, after F. R. Leavis' D. H. Lawrence: Novelist had made a passionate case for his centrality in twentieth-century English imaginative writing. Leavis didn't treat Lawrence's poems, but A. Alvarez did in an essay in which he called Lawrence "the only native English poet to survive the First World War," and, more grandly, the "foremost emotional realist of the century." Concurrently with Leavis and Alvarez, Harold Bloom saluted Lawrence as occupying an important place in the romantic vision as found in Blake, Wordsworth, and Whitman; his poetry was "the embodiment of more than rational energy," for Bloom a virtue. In his pantheon of post- Romantic instances of such embodiment, Lawrence took his place along with Yeats, Wallace Stevens, and Hart Crane, romantic artists who served for Bloom as a needed rebuke to the by-then outmoded work of Pound, Eliot, and Auden, a "school" Bloom took every opportunity to patronize and disparage as etiolated. Both Alvarez and Bloom were responding to probably the first serious criticism of Lawrence's poetry, R. R Blackmur's "D. H. Lawrence and Expressive Form," published in 1935 a few years after Lawrence's 1 THE POEMS OF D. H. LAWRENCE, Vols. 1 and 2, ed. by Christopher Pollnitz. Cambridge University Press. $250.00.

PRITCHARD 575 death.2 Blackmur judged the poems to be written out of an "incom- plete, uncomposed mind" that lacked "rational structure" and demon- strated instead what he called the "fallacy of expressive form," the notion that "if a thing is only intensely enough felt its mere expression in words will give it satisfactory form." Lacking such structure, Lawrence's poems forced the reader to do the work the poet had failed to do: to "complete the poems of which [Lawrence] gave only the expressive outlines." Further, Lawrence, in Blackmur's judgment, and after his earlier rhyming poems, believed that the "radical imperfec- tion" of poetry was a fundamental virtue. In the foreword Lawrence wrote to his 1928 Collected Poems , two volumes divided between rhyming and unrhyming poems, he distin- guished two Lawrences present in his early poems; the "ordinary me," who was a "milder and nicer self," and the "demon" self, not easily lovable, but authentic and "fuming" under restrictions imposed by the nicer self. The result was often poetry in which that nicer self laid his hand on the poet's mouth, suppressing the demon. Rather than wel- coming the demon's performance, Blackmur declared it took the "obsessions" of Lawrence's experience and submitted them to "the heightening fires of hysteria, putting down the obsessions as they truly came." Although Blackmur didn't refer directly to Eliot's "Tradition and the Individual Talent," it's clear that Lawrence is being chastised for his un-Eliotic refusal to separate the man who suffered from the mind that creates. Another name for that necessary separation, in Eliot's and Blackmur's view, was the discipline of form, impersonal and "objective" in its working. Looking at Lawrence's poetry historically reminds one that his first volume, Love Poems and Others , was published a hundred years ago in 1913 at a time when "modern" poetry was about to burst into flower. Consider some of the now-familiar titles from that time: Frost's A Boy's Will and North of Boston (1913, 1914); Yeats's Responsibilities (1914); Hardy's Satires of Circumstances (1914), now most admired for the sequence of "Poems 1912-13" written about his recently dead wife Emma. Eliot's "Prufrock" would appear in 1915, also a truncated version of Wallace Stevens' "Sunday Morning." Pound, grandmaster of at least some of these writers, had entered his Imagist phase with the haiku-like "In a Station of the Metro" and his manifesto "A Few Don'ts by an Imagiste." Less noticed than any of these were the poems Edward Thomas began to write in November 1914, unnoticed because he would not publish them until a few years later. But Thomas was an accom- plished prose writer whose new friend, Frost, had inspired him to write verse. Thomas was also the best poetry reviewer in England, of Frost's first books among many others. One of the others was Lawrence, whose 2 In Form and Value in Modern Poetry (New York, 1957). The Alvarez essay, "Lawrence's Poetry: The Single State of Man," is in D. H. Laxvrence: Novelist, Poet, Prophet, ed. by Stephen Spender (London, 1973). The Bloom essay, "Lawrence, Eliot, Blackmur, and the Tortoise," is in The Ringers in the Tower (Chicago, 1971).</page><page sequence="3">576 THE HUDSON REVIEW Love Poems and Others Thomas reviewed not once but twice (this was a habit of his).3 Thomas called them "extraordinarily close-packed poems," noted their affiliations with Lawrence's first two novels, recent- ly published, and gave attention to the poems' "metrical changes"; their "broken and hesitating rhythms," Thomas noted, were "part of a per- sonality that will sink nothing of itself in what is common." Lawrence's separate phrases were "often of a prose type" that, compared to Whitman's rhymeless verses, "never runs loose." What Thomas had in mind to praise in Lawrence may be suggested by a poem easy to overlook but short enough to quote in full: A Winter's Tale Yesterday the fields were only grey with scattered snow, And now the longest grass-leaves hardly emerge; Yet her deep footsteps mark the snow, and go On towards the pines at the hill's white verge. I cannot see her, since the mist's pale scarf Obscures the dark wood and the dull orange sky; But she's waiting, I know, impatient and cold, half Sobs struggling into her frosty sigh. Why does she come so promptly, when she must know She's only the nearer to the inevitable farewell? The hill is steep, on the snow my steps are slow - Why does she come, when she knows what I have to tell? Here are the "hesitating rhythms" that Thomas praised, conveyed through what Frost liked to call "the speaking voice." The lines in stanza two, "But she's waiting, I know, impatient and cold, half / Sobs strug- gling into her frosty sigh," is a nice example of such a voice. But the speech rhythms Frost and Thomas were after, and the achieved success of such speech in some of Hardy's "Poems of 1912-13," not much noticed at the time, were not the road Lawrence chose to follow after his first book of verse. Instead Thomas' contrast of Lawrence with Whitman's "rhymeless lawlessness" is ironic since Lawrence would soon write (in his preface to New Poems , 1919) that Whitman's free verse was a major inspiration for what he called "poetry of the present," in which permanence lies in its "wind-like transit." Unlike the finished "poems of the past," it "vibrates unspeakably, it inhales the future, it exhales the past, it is the quick of both and yet it is neither." Not the products of literary modernism, nor the metrical speech rhythms of Frost and Edward Thomas - these were finished "poems of the past"; instead: 3 In A Language Not to Be Betrayed: Selected Prose of Edward Thomas , ed. by Edna Longley (Manchester, 1981).</page><page sequence="4">WILLIAM H. PRITCHARD 577 Not I, not I, but the wind that blows through me! A fine wind is blowing the new direction of Time. If only I let it hear me, carry me, if only it carry me! If only I am sensitive, subtle, oh, delicate, a winged gift! If only, most lovely of all, I yield myself and am borrowed By the fine, fine wind that takes its course through the chaos of the world Like a fine, an exquisite chisel, a wedge-blade inserted; If only I am keen and hard like the sheer tip of a wedge . . . These are the opening lines of "Song of a Man Who Has Come Through," one of the poems in Look! We Have Come Through /, a sequence (more or less) of poems about the coming together of Lawrence and Frieda von Richthofen, who left her husband and three children for Lawrence. In the opening short prose "argument" to the sequence we are told that the poems feature "the conflict of love and hate between the man and the woman, and between these two and the world around them till it reaches some sort of conclusion." That conclusion would never be reached in the marital life of Lawrence and Frieda, and it's hard to see one in the poems as well. When the book was published in 1917, the English reviews were mainly devastating, one of them suggesting that Lawrence's metrical ear was so deficient that he adopted perforce the easier alternative of free verse. More presciently a shrewd critic, Douglas Goldring, suggested that the alternating bathos and sublimity of the book was a result of Lawrence having "seen more than he can possibly express, perhaps more than is expressible." As with Shelley and Whitman, words would constantly fail to encompass the inexpressible. Yet more or less concurrently with Look ! We Have Come Through ! (one wag remarked that he was glad they had come through, but did we have to look?), Lawrence revised an early, unpublished poem that would eventually see the light in his collected poems of 1928. This was "Piano": Softly, in the dusk, a woman is singing to me; Taking me back down the vista of years, till I see A child sitting under the piano, in the boom of the tingling strings And pressing the small, poised feet of a mother who smiles as she sings. In spite of myself, the insidious mastery of song Betrays me back, till the heart of me weeps to belong To the old Sunday evenings at home, with winter outside And hymns in the cosy parlour, the tinkling piano our guide. So now it is vain for the singer to burst into clamour With the great black piano appassionato. The glamour Of childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast Down in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past.</page><page sequence="5">578 THE HUDSON REVIEW (Unfortunately, and unlike the previously mentioned edition of the poems by de Sola Pinto and Roberts, the new edition does not reproduce an earlier poem titled "The Piano," which is longer and more slack in its organization.) "Piano" achieved some recognition when I. A. Richards selected it as one of the poems handed out to students, without author or date, in an experiment that resulted in Practical Cńticism (1929). Interestingly, it was one of the most unpopular of the specimens, students finding it appallingly sentimental. In fact Richards had selected it as an instance in which "mawkish" sentiment is risked but also controlled through "nearness, concreteness, and coherence." Surely such control is aided by rhyme and rhythmic originality as in the end of stanza three: "The glamour / Of childish days is upon me, my manhood is cast / Down in the flood of remembrance, I weep like a child for the past." Here, after the perilous rhyme of "clamour" and "glamour," the latter is enjambed in a long sentence with a metrical turn in the final line ("Down" gets a strong stress) made strong through the precise awareness of what feelings are being yielded to. W. H. Auden, whose early poems were written as Lawrence's life and work drew to a close, and whose social and psychological observations in those poems may be compared, in their diagnostic ambitions, to Lawrence's, wrote an appreciative essay on him some years later.4 Auden dismissed Lawrence's rhyming poems wholly and judged Birds, Beasts and Flowers (1923) as the volume in which his good work was to be found. He compared Lawrence to William Blake as poets who were both artists and apostles, and he makes the claim for Lawrence that no matter how many faults his poems have, he never "puts on an act": his very distaste for humanity, for the men and women he mostly detested, made him all the more responsive and affectionate toward non-human life - toward birds, beasts, and flowers. Auden goes so far as to call him "an enchanting companion" when his attention is focused on a mosquito or a fish or a hummingbird - or especially a tortoise, about which he wrote more than one poem. Auden doesn't do much more than quote some lines from poems in the volume, declaring them, in their purity of feeling, "transparent." But that adjective does not fit the witty technique of my favorite animal poem of Lawrence's (not included in Birds , Beasts and Flowers , perhaps because it rhymes) , "The elephant is slow to mate - " The elephant, the huge old beast is slow to mate; he finds a female, they show no haste they wait for the sympathy in their vast shy hearts slowly, slowly to rouse 4 Auden 's essay is in The Dyer's Hand (London, 1963).</page><page sequence="6">WILLIAM H. PRITCHARD 579 as they loiter along the river-beds and drink and browse and dash in panic through the brake of forest with the herd, and sleep in massive silence, and wake together, without a word. So slowly the great hot elephant hearts grow full of desire, and the great beasts mate in secret at last, hiding their fire. Oldest they are and the wisest of beasts so they know at last how to wait for the loneliest of feasts for the full repast. They do not snatch, they do not tear; their massive blood moves as the moon-tides, near, more near till they touch in flood. There is to my mind a very attractive sympathy here for the imagined "vast shy hearts" the beasts possess, and the quality of feeling displayed is not without some humor; while absent is any trace of the "hysteria" that Blackmur perhaps too sweepingly attributed to Lawrence's poems. I can't think of any writer about whom the word "urbane" would be less likely to come to mind, but there is more than a touch of urbanity in "The elephant is slow to mate - ." Much more typical of Lawrence's animal poems is "Snake," which admirers of them rate high on the scale. Too long to quote, but the story is familiar: a "guest" comes to drink at Lawrence's water trough. The "voice" of the man's education tells him it must be killed, this venomous visitor from "the burning bowels of the earth"; but the man longs to talk to the visitor, feels honored by his presence. Yet when the snake looking "around like a god" prepares to climb up the broken wall face and depart, putting his head into the hole - "Deliberately going into the blackness, and slowly drawing himself after" - the man, overcome by "a sort of horror," picks up a log and throws it at the water trough. It doesn't hit the snake, but hastens his disappearance into the fissure in the wall-front. The final strophes of the poem are as follows: And immediately I regretted it. I thought how paltry, how vulgar, what a mean act! I despised myself and the voices of my accursed human education.</page><page sequence="7">580 THE HUDSON REVIEW And I thought of the albatross, And I wished he would come back, my snake. For he seemed to me again like a king, Like a king in exile, uncrowned in the underworld, Now due to be crowned again. And so, I missed my chance with one of the lords Of life. And I have something to expiate: A pettiness. This is presumably the opposite of, to recall Auden's phrase, putting on an act; there is nothing less than complete sincerity in the ring of Lawrence's confession of his human weakness. But how does it stand in relation to our own imperfect sense of human reality? Certainly it puts us in a morally inferior position, since, as is probably the case, we have never considered a snake "one of the lords of life." And who of us would be willing or able to present our abjectness (after we threw the stick) as "something to expiate: A pettiness"? (The portentousness is increased by ending the poem with that stark two-word final line.) Is it possible that Lawrence understands too much, is too unquali- fiedly right-minded in his apology to the snake? There are some pages in Wyndham Lewis' magazine The Enemy , published the year before Lawrence died, in which Lewis makes fun of Lawrence's reverence for the dark, "blood" consciousness.5 Lewis quotes some sentences from Lawrence's novel The Plumed Serpent in which an Indian woman/ wife is admired for "the putting forth of all herself in a delicate, marvellous sensitiveness, which draws forth all the wonder to herself." Lewis imagines what the woman's spouse might do if he heard Lawrence admiring his wife in such terms: "He would probably say, 'Chuck it, Archie!' in Hopl. At least he would be considerably surprised and probably squint very hard under his 'dark' brows, at Mr. Lawrence." If we let the snake stand in for the Indian woman, it may be salutary to imagine another possible response to Lawrence's reverence for "one of the lords of life," something analogous perhaps to "Chuck it, Archie!" This is ungenerous, and in the best, most sympathetic account of Lawrence's poems I know of - and indeed of his writing career in its entirety - Graham Hough praises "Snake" and some of the other "animal" poems.6 Hough finds "a profounder kind of natural piety in them, one that recognizes the strangeness, sometimes the real antagonism" between man and animal. But to claim that "Snake" is good because it doesn't reduce everything to the "anthropomorphic" and that it recognizes "otherness and difference" seems to me mistaken, 5 Reprinted in Paleface: The Philosophy of the "Melting Pot" (London, 1929). 6 Graham Hough, The Dark Sun: A Study ofD. H. Lawrence (London, 1956).</page><page sequence="8">WILLIAM H. PRITCHARD 581 insofar as Lawrence uses "recognition" to confirm his own status as a virtuous man, more virtuous than us ordinary mortals because more sensitive. One of Lawrence's late poems says with something like rough affection, "My mother was a superior soul / a superior soul was she." She passed along some of that superiority to her son, and it does not inevitably attract us. His very last poems, written as he was dying, bid to transcend superfi- ciality, superiority, anything that reeks of the merely human, by speak- ing in grave, repetitive utterances, pretty much all in one tone, about what is to come. "Now it is autumn and the falling fruit / and the long journey towards oblivion": that opening to "The Ship of Death" is unique in English poetry. The second section is as follows: Have you built your ship of death, O have you? O build your ship of death, for you will need it. The grim frost is at hand, when the apples will fall thick, almost thundrous, on the hardened earth. And death is on the air like a smell of ashes! Ah! can't you smell it? And in the bruised body, the frightened soul finds itself shrinking, wincing from the cold that blows upon it through the orifices. What to say in the face of lines such as these? Well, that they intimidate, making us wonder whether we have gone about our building in the right way, if at all. Certainly their homage is to something other than what Wordsworth proposed, speaking of poetry as "an homage ... to the grand elementary principle of pleasure." Graham Hough makes an enlightening comparison of Lawrence's final poems with those of his contemporary, W. B. Yeats (Yeats's The Tower appeared in 1928). He quotes Yeats's lines from the opening section of "The Tower": "Never had I more / Excited, passionate, fantastical / Imagination, nor an ear and eye / That more expected the impossible" as an example of Yeats's "oppositional" mode, death defied thorough the dramatic rhetoric of the aging, unreconciled man. With Lawrence, by contrast, "The whole direction of Last Poems is precisely to avoid the Yeatsian opposition, to refuse to make any volte face , to absorb the fact of death into the mode of consciousness that is already his own." This process of absorption, as it might be called, is non-dramatic rather than dramatic, and thus more difficult for a critic to say much about. I prefer to end where Auden does in his appreciation of Lawrence: that is, with the aggressive sardonic Lawrence of the short poems in Pansies and Nettles. Many if not most of these poems are short, what</page><page sequence="9">582 THE HUDSON REVIEW Auden perceptively calls "satiric doggerel." Such verse, he says, is "the weapon of the outsider, the anarchist rebel, who refuses to accept conventional laws and pieties as binding or worthy of respect." This is of course a Lawrence we have met before, especially present in St. Maxvr and some of the late stories. By no means the most noticeable of these poems, though my personal favorite, is a short untitled salute to an unfriendly critic of Lawrence's paintings, Thomas Earp. The de Sola Pinto/Roberts edition tells us that Earp, an art critic, had a "curious high-pitched voice" (the Cambridge edition is silent on this matter). At any rate Lawrence's piece of doggerel memorably does the job: I heard a little chicken chirp: My name is Thomas, Thomas Earp! and I can neither paint nor write I only can set other people right. All people that can write or paint do tremble under my complaint. For I am a chicken, and I can chirp, and my name is Thomas, Thomas Earp.</page></plain_text>
