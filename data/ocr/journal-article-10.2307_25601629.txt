<plain_text><page sequence="1">MICHEL CHAOULI The Politics of Permanent Parabasis THE MAIN DIFFICULTY IN COMING TO TERMS WITH THE POLITICS OF RO manticism has thus far been seen to lie in the discrepancy that opens between the manifest political claims of many of the romantics and the so cial and political implications of that part of their writings that does not overtly address political issues (most prominently, their poetry). These im plications, often murky and contradictory, maintain an uneasy relationship with the manifest political claims, an unease that critics have found difficult to tolerate; thus they have either pressed explicit and implicit claims into harmony, or, in more recent practice, insisted on their d/sharmony: we are shown how well-meaning political views are belied by a sinister aesthetic ideology that shows its true face in poetic practice, or?vice-versa?how sinister views are upended by a euphoric social model encoded in the poetry. Both of these strategies overlook the possibility that the link between ar tistic practice and political ideology may be weak or entirely absent; both strategies therefore find themselves unable either to consider or to test the hypothesis that one of the crucial accomplishments of romanticism may lie precisely in the weakening or breaking of this link. This is not to suggest that the romantics did not hold political views, nor that their poetic works do not engage important political questions. It does suggest that their most radical innovations in poetic practice and aesthetic theory can only be rec ognized and absorbed by later writers if those innovations are not con strained by the demands placed upon a political theory or social model. The line of reasoning I propose assumes that romanticism, far from further ing a mutual implication of art and politics (or art and religion, or art and philosophy), promotes their differentiation. With romanticism, art (and not politics, religion, or philosophy) increasingly decides what art should be. For the sake of legibility, I use English translations throughout; Schlegel's original appears in the notes. References to non-English sources and, where available, their published English translations are separated by a slash. I have often silently amended translations.

A close exam ination of intra-literary structures reveals to what an extent the literariness of literature forestalls an allegorical or metaphorical transfer of its terms to historical practices. I shall focus on an analysis of the writings of one mem ber of the so-called Romantic School, Friedrich Schlegel. His case prom ises to repay close scrutiny not only because he is, in Isaiah Berlin's excited words, "the greatest harbinger, the greatest herald and prophet of romanti cism that ever lived, "2 nor because of the impressive political somersault he performed in his lifetime (from fervent supporter of the French Revolution to Metternich's amanuensis, in less than two decades), but because his po etic and aesthetic writings do not shy away from establishing analogies with social theory. Yet I will argue that these analogies, followed with some rigor, threaten the very integrity of the political toward which they appear to point, for just those features that make the poetic theory rich and inno vative would, if pursued to their end, provoke a complete social break down. i "It would hardly be hyperbolic to say ..." Paul de Man has claimed, "that the whole discipline of Germanistik has developed for the single reason of dodging Friedrich Schlegel. "3 Though less sweeping in tone, Ernst Robert Curtius (like de Man not a Germanist) comes to a similar conclusion in an essay from 1932. He traces the deep and persistent suspicion with which Schlegel's life and work have been received by academic literary criticism to the awkward intersection of biography, poetics, and political program that I noted earlier: If one examines the reproaches directed at Friedrich Schlegel in the usual literary histories, one ends up with a strange collection. First of all, he is reproached for being lazy; second, for being impudent, be cause he defended laziness in writing and had written in praise of idle ness. . . .

Now, however, the same author had also presumed to write a novel celebrating the joys of love. For this the agencies supervising German literature took him severely to task. But it gets worse. Friedrich Schlegel was quite simply an epicure. He liked to eat and drink and in so doing acquired a comfortable corpulence. This fact, too, is held against him. . . . Strangest of all, many critics associate with this reproach the other one, that Friedrich Schlegel, together with his wife, was converted to Catholicism at the age of thirty-four. The same people for whom Schlegel is too immoral and insolent are not pleased when he becomes respectable and pious.4 It is not only dim critics who conflate the personal, the poetic, and the po litical: the astute Maurice Blanchot celebrates the young "atheist, radical, individualistic" Schlegel and complains that the older Schlegel, "converted to Catholicism, a diplomat and journalist in the service of Metternich ... is no longer anything but a fat philistine of unctuous speech, his mind on food, lazy, and empty."5 But Schlegel's girth, his growing piousness, and his gluttony are merely the magnets for a far more serious critique, namely the persistent and polit ically consequential charge of irrationalism. It depends for its efficacy on folding his work into a corporate entity called "early romanticism" (at times plain "romanticism"), with whom his fortunes are then permitted to wax and wane. Hegel's judgment holding Schlegel to be unfit for "specula tive thought"6 is an early instance of the way in which nineteenth-century critics, literary historians, and philosophers?with the important exceptions of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche?denigrate the so-called Romantic School. A long line of nineteenth-century writers?among them figures such as Heinrich Heine, the literary historian Georg Gottfried Gervinus, and Rudolf Haym, author of the influential study Die romantische Schule [The Romantic School, 1870]?dismiss with varying degrees of intensity the most innovative elements in Schlegel's poetological7 writings in favor of a broad 4.

After World War 11, the charge of irrationalism, by then firmly en trenched, is conflated?even made responsible for?the paroxysm of irra tionality and barbarity that had washed over Germany. Thomas Mann and Georg Lukacs, who otherwise agree on little, both take "romanticism" (an amorphous entity that dispenses with making a distinction between Schlegel and other romantics, let alone between the early and late Schlegel) to be the biotope in which Nazism could thrive.9 Their thesis shows little sign of losing acceptance. Thus Jiirgen Habermas criticizes romanticism for what he takes to be its messianic devotion to Dionysian mythology.10 More recently, the eminent historian of Germany Gordon Craig has identified "that peculiarly German sense of inwardness, or remoteness from reality" (that, in his view, typifies romanticism) as "the malaise allemand," holding it responsible for engendering "forces of terror and violence and death."11 By these he means not only Hitler12 but also violent extremism in postwar Germany, notably the terrorism of the Red Army Faction (210). In all these cases, the motivation to speak, as Craig does, of a "familiar Romantic antagonism ... to rationalism and progress" (206) may lie in part in the de sire to shelter rationalism and progress from any suspicion of complicity with the barbarities this century has wrought?to avoid confronting the mutual entanglement of rationality and barbarism that Max Horkheimer and T. W. Adorno have called the dialectic of enlightenment. Such readings depend not only on a failure to differentiate between Schlegel and "romanticism," but also, and more seriously, on a failure of reading.

If we are to gain a more nuanced understanding of the political thought embedded in Schlegers writings, his aesthetic concerns cannot be brushed aside. Quite the contrary: we would like to know what, if any, political thought might emerge from the aes thetic theory. 2 The young Schlegel's disregard for philosophical decorum, his syncretic ability to mix and match anything that interests him, his willingness to court paradox, contradiction, incoherence?all this would seem to predis pose, if not himself, than at least his writings to a strong version of anti authoritarianism. By holding up the side of his work that espouses differ ence against identity, dialogism against monologism, nonidentity against identity, have we not implicitly claimed him for emancipatory politics? In deed, even if Schlegel himself is reluctant to make those claims (and he often is), we could, with the assistance of semiological critique, help his writings accomplish the leap from experimentation with the signifier to what Barthes's S/Z has called "a liberatory theory of the signifier,"13 the leap, that is, from linguistic self-enclosure to political intervention. It has been one of the axioms of much (though by no means all) post structuralist writing that setting free the signifier is also and perhaps primar ily a political act. Since we can imagine a reading that would gather Schlegel's experiments with fragmentation, multiplicity, deferral, and un groundedness into an early version of post-structuralism14 (though such a reading might find it difficult to account for the prominent presence of ideas of systematicity, organicism, and coherence that earlier critics had tended to emphasize), it would almost follow by itself that his early work adds up to a "gay science of poetry," brimming with liberating political en ergy. In a suggestive book of this title, Jochen Horisch makes just this claim. He argues that, despite its "self-misunderstandings," "early romantic aesthetic absolutism is the model of political reason."15 And it performs this 13- Roland Barthes, S/Z (Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1970), back cover. 14. Winfried Menninghaus has offered the most rigorous version of such a reading. He maintains that the early romantic critique of idealism "anticipates . . . the post-structuralist metacritique and radicalization [of structuralism], as it has been performed above all by Jacques Derrida," Unendliche Verdopplung: Die fruhromantische Grundlegung der Kunsttheorie im Begriff absoluter Selbstreflexion (Frankfurt: Suhrkamp, 1987) 25, indeed that Derrida finally "re mains behind" the romantics (131). 15.

Poetry, then, as a Utopian counter-model to the negativity of social reality: it is not difficult to hear the murmurs of Adorno's aesthetic theory in the background. Such a judgment would find corroboration in the young Schlegel's sym pathetic view of the French Revolution, his engagement for the emancipa tion of women, and his violation of erotic taboos (for example in Lucinde), which have led some readers to celebrate his kind of romanticism as "a continuation of the bourgeois revolution in the field of ideology."16 That Schlegel at this point supports the French Revolution is well documented17: when reflecting on letters from Caroline Bohmer, a fierce supporter of both the Revolution and the short-lived Mainz Republic (who would marry, first, Schlegel's older brother, August Wilhelm, and later Schelling), the twenty-one-year-old Friedrich Schlegel confesses to be "drunk" with "this enthusiasm for a great public matter."18 A few years later, in 1796, he writes the deeply anti-republican August Wilhelm: "I don't want to deny that republicanism is still a bit closer to my heart than divine criticism and the most divine poetry."19 Friedrich Schlegel's most sustained reflection on (and defense of) repub licanism occurs in his 1796 "Versuch iiber den Begriff des Re publikanismus" ["Essay on the Concept of Republicanism"], a text that an nounces itself as a review of Kant's political treatise "Zum ewigen Frieden" ["Eternal Peace"], published a year earlier, but which has in fact far greater ambitions. Readers of the essay have tended to highlight a glaring and important point at which Schlegel distances himself from Kant.20 The latter embraces republicanism (defined as "the constitutional principle ac cording to which executive power ... is separated from legislative 16.

This cleavage between republicanism and democracy, which gives Kant leave to endorse monarchy in general and Frederick the Great in particular, is directly contradicted by Schlegel. He starts from different premises: given that the general will "exists only in the world of pure thoughts," given fur ther that the "particular and the general are separated by an infinite chasm, which can only be crossed by means of a somersault," all that remains for practical politics is to establish "an empirical will as the surrogate of the a priori and absolutely general will by means of a fiction."22 For the purposes of such a fiction, democracy seems the best approximation to the republi can ideal: "The will of the majority should be effective as the surrogate of the general will. Republicanism is thus necessarily democratic, and [Kant's] un proved paradox . . . that democratism must necessarily be despotic cannot be right."23 This is without a doubt an important engagement, for it not only makes plain Schlegel's sympathies with the ideals of the French Revolution, an act not without its perils at the time, but also establishes the far more serious theoretical connection between the idea of republicanism and a democratic form of government that should, as much as possible, approach radical de mocracy (where the fictional coincidence with the general will would be greatest). Yet for the purposes of our present argument it seems to me that a different point of divergence between the twenty-four-year-old upstart and the great Kant is of larger importance still. It concerns the principles? the founding fiction?of social organization as such. Kant's declaration that the "civil constitution in each state shall be republican" (349/437), i.e., that the republican is the sole legitimate form of constitution, is derived from the formalist premise of "the idea of an original contract upon which all rightful legislation of the state must be based" (350/437).

If what gives rise to poetry is also what gives rise to politics, then the two can hardly be divorced. If, furthermore, this common source consists in imparting or parting oneself, then the poetological project of fragmentation would seem to give expression to that original impulse with great precision. Schlegel's philosophical and anthropological arguments for republican ism and radical democracy have often been made light of as a romantic in fatuation not only with freedom and equality but also, and quite possibly primarily, with Caroline Bohmer, the activist for those causes.26 They have, in a more serious vein, been relativized as claims not primarily about Ger many but about ancient Greece.27 Though such a claim diverts our atten tion from Schlegel's present to a past that for all intents and purposes is imagined according to the logic of myth, the reference to the ancients calls to our mind passages that are valuable for the deep connection they estab lish between art and politics, specifically republican and hence (for Schlegel) democratic politics. In notes entitled "Charakteristik der griechischen Tragiker" ["Characteristics of Greek Tragedians"], written at around the same time as the essay on republicanism, in 1795, Schlegel at tempts to determine the relationship between Greek politics and Greek tragedy. One important element of what he calls the "republicanism of tragedy"28 is the fact that the chorus constitutes the "representation of the people."29 But crossing the barrier of the proscenium and placing the peo ple on both its sides?as members of the audience, as members of the cho rus?can become problematic in unfavorable political conditions: 24.

When for example higher estates or the will of the Few rules, then they will establish as law their conven tional and accidental concepts; their pettiness becomes the boundary of art. Limits of this kind would then be decency etc. These limits dis turb the freedom of art. But if the will were really public and if there were only the law that the representations should be civil, republican, public: that really imposes no limits on the poet.30 The connection, then, between politics and poetry is not only primordial (in their common source: communication) but immediate and empirical. Oligarchic forms of government constrain aesthetic communication be cause they constrain communication as such, while democratic ones impose no constraint, for all they require of the poet is to communicate publicly. Unpacking the political implications of Schlegel's aesthetic theory (if we may, for brevity's sake, call it that), far from being illegitimate, becomes an urgent task. He makes the connection explicit not only in Greek tragedy but in self-reflexive reference to his own work. Thus he imagines frag ments as members of a social system: "Some witty ideas"?and fragments certainly fall into this category?"are like the surprising meeting of two friendly thoughts after a long separation."31 Fragments are bound by "that free and equal fellowship in which the citizens of the perfect state . . . will at some point find themselves."32 Not only does Schlegel acknowledge that his poetic theory can extend into an allegory of social relations, that "exper imentation is very much in the spirit of revolutionary practice,"33 but he seems to suggest that the ensemble of fragments lends itself to progressive so 30.

"Poetry is republican speech," he writes in the journal Ly ceum, "a speech that is its own law and its own end, in which all parts are free citizens and have an equal say [or vote]."34 All the evidence seems to be in place for making the Barthesian leap from semiotics to politics: his poetico-theoretical practice certainly promotes the "liberation of the signifier"; Schlegel himself advocates the liberation that republicanism of fers against despotic monarchism; and he explicitly sanctions a connection between poetic practice and a democratic politics. One could hardly need more to establish a strong link between avant-garde poetics and avant garde politics. Yet it seems to me that the argument is flawed. For if we look more closely at what kind of social life can be said to emerge from such an aes thetic theory, then the inauguration of a "meta-discourse free of domina tion" will turn out to be far more disquieting than their endorsement by recent critics seems to acknowledge. Just as Schlegel's many organicist and stereotypically "romantic" statements about poetry are relativized, if not contravened, by the possibility of "error and of madness, or of obtuseness and of stupidity"35 implied by his combinatorial poetics, his right-thinking political sentiments are undercut by the ambiguous political values tacit in his aesthetic theory. This is as it should be. For if the verbal artwork is in deed undergoing in Schlegel's hands a development into the direction of greater autonomy, and if this development is caused inter alia by a recursive loop of self-reference and self-reflection, then the price exacted by the in creased autonomy of the literary text lies in the inevitably arising areas of hermeneutic bewilderment that just as inevitably undermine an unequivo cal moral reading. In this sense, there cannot be a neat relation between "lit erature" (in Foucault's sense of a discourse that draws "closer and closer to the very being of language"36) and political?and hence necessarily moral?models of social organization. To the degree that the verbal art work displays its self-confidence and stability by flaunting paradoxes and indeterminacies, it becomes an unfit carrier of political messages. 34- ["Poesie ist eine republikanische Rede; eine Rede, die ihr eignes Gesetz und ihr eigner Zweck ist, wo alle Teile freie Burger sind, und mitstimmen diirfen"] (KA 2: 155, No. 65/PF 8). 35.

While a claim like "revo lutions are universal, not organic but chemical movements" appears to align the chemical process with which poetry is so deeply infused with a progressive political agenda, the very notion of progression is hampered by the (poetic and chemical) model through which progress is announced. For the same logic that permits (poetic and chemical) experimentation to re main an essentially open-ended process requires constant interruptions in that very process. In the realm of poetic practice, this logic leads Schlegel to the notion of the fragment, a form whose very definition requires an inter ruption, a break ifragmentum derives from frangere = to break). The pro gression of poetic experiments (for instance, a collection of fragments) can be called "progressive universal poetry" only if that notion includes the breaks between and within each experiment. The idea of an interruption at the heart of poetic writing can be put in more familiar rhetorical terms. As everyone knows, Schlegel's work, as that of the Jena circle more generally, is shot through with irony, a term notori ously difficult to control. Irony, de Man has shown, is in Schlegel's writings nothing but an interruption, a parabasis, but not one that can be localized (Aesthetic Ideology 178?79).37 In Schlegel's own terms, irony is a "permanent parabasis"38 (my emphasis), which is to say a constant interruption. But what kind of a monstrosity is a movement that is interrupted at all times? How are we to image a process of writing?and a society modeled on it?that has a break at every point of its narrative? Schlegel provides us?or, more precisely, the four lone members of his audience at his lectures on The History of European Literature?with his own derivation of the trope of parabasis, which is worth attending to: The only difference [between Greek comedy and tragedy] consists in parabasis, a speech that in the midst of the play was held by the chorus in the name of the poet to the people. Yes, it was a complete interrup tion and dissolution of the play, during which (just as in the play it self) the greatest licentiousness reigned and the chorus, which had stepped out to the outer limits of the proscenium, said the grossest 37- See also Paul de Man, Allegories of Reading: Figural Language in Rousseau, Nietzsche, Rilke, and Proust (New Haven: Yale UP, 1979) 300-301. 38.

The name is derived from this stepping out (ekbasis).39 Schlegel does not consider this "complete interruption and dissolution" of the performance to have harmed the unity of the comedy. It lies in the very form of comedy, as "pure comedy," to "dissolve in itself all ends and all intention"; in comedy "nonform itself is . . . the highest art."40 Schlegel clearly registers the effect that this form of comedy has on the public. For this kind of joking [Witz], Schlegel solemnly tells his listeners, "an audience is necessary in which everyone is mature and does not abuse freedom."41 For "if there is to be a poem of wit"?which is to say: if there is to be romantic poetry? then wit must be boundlessly free. This freedom is to be permitted when it is meant for a small audience which has the right to take part in such freedom. Under no circumstances is this for the mixed crowd which is entirely unworthy of this freedom, where the most unpleas ant, the most pernicious consequences could be feared.42 Athens, where the highest form of comedy was available, is an example of such abuse. "The magistrate was really forced," Schlegel notes, "to ban both the personal satire and the chorus with parabasis. But this coincides with the decline of republicanism and democracy."43 The point is not whether at the time and place that he utters these sentences?Paris, 1803 04?Schlegel supports or condemns republicanism. What is crucial is that this line of reasoning reproduces the logic of the arguments from 1795 about the dependence of poetry for its freedom on democracy that I quoted ear 39- ["Der einzige Unterschied besteht in der Parekbasis, einer Rede, die in der Mitte des Stiicks vom Chor im Namen des Dichters an das Volk gehalten wurde.

While its evaluation may have changed, the basic point remains that a tight, indeed causal, link is assumed between political freedom (promoted by republicanism and democracy) and the boundless freedom required for the operations of parabasis and Witz, required, in short, for unrestrained irony. To understand its exact political consequences, we need to look more closely at the trope of parabasis. Elsewhere I have proposed reading Schlegel's experimental poetics together with the language of late eigh teenth-century chemistry, which furnishes Schlegel with countless meta phors and images.44 I have argued that the very precariousness of chemis try?a field perched between the phlogiston and oxygen theories, between magical and rational explanations, between the machine-like logic of combinatorics and the anthropomorphic theory of affinity?makes it into a particularly fitting allegory of the poetical model Schlegel develops. The chemical model has the further virtue of allowing him?and us?to think about poetic entities without immediately pinning them to particular psy chic or historical referents. We can thus avoid the temptation to think of the textual irony in mental terms, which would provide us with a second, "higher" consciousness "staging" the irony (even if permanent irony) for our benefit. Permanent parabasis is, so to speak, the inverse of the process of combinatorial coupling that yields poetic forms, for a recombination is only thinkable if we assume a momentary state of pure potential in which all valences are open and anything can happen. This chaotic state, in which substances are thrown into disarray (recall, in the Elective Affinities, the Cap tain's talk of A "flinging" itself at D) needs to occur before a new combina tion can form. Interruption is not an intrusion from outside (not a second voice), but rather a defining feature of the progression of the process itself. As Blanchot puts it, "[interrupted, it goes on."45 In such a state, distinguishing process from interruption is no trivial task. We could turn the usual understanding on its head and say that the chemi cal process consists of a long series of fluctuating states interrupted by the occasional stable compound. As in Wittgenstein's and Escher's famous drawings of Gestalt switches, we can flip the interruptions from the fore ground into the background. In this precise sense, they are permanent, a series of uninterrupted interruptions. When Schlegel writes that the poetry of Witz is "meant for a small audi 44- See my "Critical Mass, Fission, Fusion: Friedrich Schlegel's Volatile System," in Mar tha Heifer, ed., Rereading Romanticism (Amsterdamer Beitrage zur neueren Germanistik 47) (Am sterdam: Rodopi, 2000) 131-49, and, in greater detail, The Laboratory of Poetry: Chemistry and Poetics in the Work of Friedrich Schlegel (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 2002), esp. chapter 4. 45.

This gesture would certainly have the advantage of permitting us to congratulate ourselves on our great courage in standing on the side of re publicanism and democracy and against the limitations of freedom. It may, however, have the disadvantage of obscuring our view to the pitfalls of transferring the poetic project to the political realm, and hence of missing the most advanced features of the poetic theory. Schlegel does not confine permanent interruption to Witz or parabasis or irony, not, in other words, to written communication in philosophy and literature, but extends them to the life process itself. "Life is possible only by means of a continuous, constantly repeated disturbance," he declares.46 And if life itself comes into being by means of the permanent parabasis?if it, in fact, consists of nothing but the repetition of disturbance?then we have every reason to assume that mental life cannot exempt itself from this staccato of continuous interruption. Another notebook entry reads accord ingly: "On the inside of a human being who has achieved a certain height and universality of education there is a continuous chain of the most tre mendous revolutions. "47 The continuous chain of discontinuities does not occur in some primor dial past but is imagined to shake the subject after the process of educa tion?Bildung?has "achieved a certain height." Bildung here does not con sist of a developmental narrative resulting in a subject so well-rounded that it can only be conceived along the reposeful lines of a classical Greek statue; on the contrary: in this account, Bildung produces the very shaken subject that its standard account (as provided most influentially by Herder) is meant to thwart. Schlegel puts this insight about the constitutive frag mentation of the self in language that anticipates the Freudian theory of the soul a hundred years later: "we are only a piece of ourselves," and connects this fragmentation to the activity?more precisely, to the process?that I have been describing. "That activity," he continues, "through which conscious ness reveals itself most acutely as a fragment is wit; its essence consists in rivenness and in turn arises from the rivenness and derivativeness of con sciousness. "48 He then defines wit, as we might expect, by means of the very combinatorial wit of letter substitution: Witz is a Blitz, a bolt of light 46.

Wit is a bolt of lightning from the unconscious world, which for us always exists alongside the conscious world, and it thus accurately represents the fragmentary state of our consciousness. It is a combination and mixture of the conscious and the unconscious.49 It will immediately be pointed out that around 1800 "unconscious" does not mean the same thing it does around 1900. No doubt, but the general meaning of the word is not at issue here; I am rather concerned with a specific occurrence within a very particular conceptual network: wit, chemistry, parabasis, interruption, fragmentation. And in this context the structural?and now lexical?parallels with the psychoanalytic notion of the unconscious allow us to gauge the range and direction the concept can take in Schlegel's writing. As the agency that brings to consciousness what Schlegel has been designating with the metaphors of chemistry?the half willed, half-accidental process of combining and mixing elements that turn out to follow affinities of their own?Witz lies precisely between knowl edge and its lack, between sense and nonsense, between intention and chance. "Without all intention and consciousness something is found," Schlegel writes about wit, aptly in the passive voice, "that has no connec tion with what came before it; on the contrary: it always stands, as it were, in stark contradiction to it. "50 The expansion of the permanent interruption of chemical wit into con sciousness holds the key to why Schlegel was never able to turn his thou sands of fragmentary notebook entries into the coherent autobiographical Bildungsroman that, in allusion to Goethe's Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship, he planned to call Philosophical Apprenticeship}1 What genre, after all, could have been better suited to demonstrating?i.e., representing and present ing?the "continuous chain of the most tremendous revolutions," not to mention the "combination and mixture of the conscious and the uncon scious," than the non-genre of the fragments? In this sense, there is a logic to Schlegel's failure: the convoluted mess of the philosophical and literary notebooks is not an experimental stage towards the preparation of an or derly?and organic?work, but is itself already the Schlegelian version of 49- ["ein Blitz aus der unbewuBten Welt, die fiir uns immer neben der bewuBten besteht, und stellt auf diese Weise den fragmentarischen Zustand unseres BewuBtseins sehr treffend dar.

There is interesting textual evidence to support this idea: far from being documents of the immediacy of thinking, at least five of the twelve note books comprising the Philosophical Apprenticeship appear to have been cop ied by Schlegel (KA 18: xlvii-xlix); it seems puzzling that a text supposed to be raw material for a future project should have been copied in its raw ness, unless that form contained its own moment of completion. The idea that the life of a subject is nothing but a series of uninterrupted interruptions is repeated in the last of the Athenaum fragments, but instead of applying it to the Bildung of one individual, it is made to encompass the totality of consciousness, human and divine: "The life of the universal spirit is an uninterrupted chain of inner revolutions; all individuals, the original and eternal ones, live in the spirit. It is a genuine polytheist and harbors within itself all of Mount Olympus."52 Instead of the organic link between microcosm and macrocosm, the model employed here to unite the two re lies on systemic interruption. The divine order of "Mount Olympus" is it self comprised by the "universal spirit," as are "all individuals"; yet far from offering the comfort of a capacious, eternal, and omnipotent deity, this spirit consists of nothing but parabases. It surely ranks as one of the strang est theologies to have been dreamed up. Any social model we venture to extract from this radically non-teleolog ical, materialist model of system formation is likely to be strange. If the aes thetic work is indeed supposed to supply the model on which to imagine a society, if social communication is to aspire to the freedom of poetic com munication, then such a radically free social sphere has little in common with a progressive or liberal political Utopia. For this social sphere must al ways include its own interruption, i.e., it must always contend with the ap pearance of radically anti-social moments. "Even a friendly conversation," Schlegel writes, "that cannot freely break off at any moment, with absolute arbitrariness, has something illiberal."53 Interruption?irony, parabasis?is not the result of an agent intervening in a discourse but of the discourse, the speech act, the chemical process intervening into itself. If we think that the social model implied by the fragments offers the hope for a "meta-dis course free of domination," then we must also realize that the very lack of domination, in so far as it is an absolute lack, entails the possibility that communication may cease, that social relations may halt, that a sort of so cial psychosis may take hold at any moment. 52.

The political act of insurrection, he reasons, is justified when "its end is the organization of republicanism," yet "permanent insurrection" would be "inauthentic," "for authentic and politi cally possible [insurrection] is necessarily transitory."54 But on the implicit level, the essay registers this possibility of a permanent interruption by at tempting to prevent the possibility of its arising. It will be recalled from the brief discussion of the essay at the outset of this paper that, in Schlegel's ac count, a somersault [Salto mortale] is necessary to traverse the chasm be tween the theoretical?and unrealizable?idea of a general will and its em pirical surrogate in politics. The particular shape that this somersault takes is that of a "fiction," the fiction for example that one individual or a certain cabal or the majority of voters embodies the empirical surrogate of the ideal general will. It seems plausible to bring this notion of fiction into relation with poetry and poetological theory, yet that would seem to me to over look an important distinction. This fiction "is not only legitimate, but also practically necessary"55 precisely because it allows us to avert our gaze from the chasm between the ideal and the surrogate will. It is a shield, a con struction that blocks a certain form of knowledge in order to enable ac tion?in short, it is what Slavoj Zizek has termed an ideological fantasy.56 Why such a fantasy, as Zizek has argued, cannot simply be subtracted from our perception of the world to open our view to "the way things really are" becomes abundantly evident in Schlegel: social life would not be dif ferent without the fantasy construction, it simply would not be. Yet poetry, imagined in the freedom that Schlegel demands for it, does not operate in the register of fantasy, or at least not there alone; at its most unrestrained, it exceeds fiction and names and performs the truth, the truth of language and of linguistic communication and, since these are taken to be analogical, the impossible truth of politics. This is what I take Foucault's enigmatic phrase about literature "draw[ing] closer and closer to the very being of language" to suggest: not a mystical, cabalistic union with the Word or the Letter, but a precise record of the interruptions set off by the separating agents of poetic writing. By devoting itself to the logic of its ma terial, poetry?or, in Foucault's vocabulary, "literature"?manages at some points not to avert its eyes when it comes face to face with permanent in terruption. Thus the idea that a society modeled on Schlegel's poetological 54- ["deren Zweck die Organisation des Republikanismus ist (. . .) eine unechte und permanente Insurrektion: denn die echte und politisch mogliche ist notwendig transitorisch"] (KA 7: 25). 55.

It is embedded in the logic of any po litical order (whether despotic or democratic) just as the possibility of inter ruption at any moment is a necessary feature of every conversation. Certain rules of conduct require us to avert our eyes from this possibility most of the time, but, as Schlegel writes, "these rules of propriety and politeness are valid for life, never for art."57 In those moments, art affords us not with a positive Utopia of what social relations might ideally look like, but with a glance at the real possibility that social bonds might, at any moment, dis solve.
