<plain_text><page sequence="1">POINTS OF VIEW The Frog: A Respectful View JOSEPH WOOD KRUTCH whenever i feel that I would like to see a frog - and you would be surprised how often that is - I have only to open my living room door and walk the two or three steps to a little concrete pool shaded by a huge spirea. Before the fox got my two pet ducks one snowy day last winter, this pool was theirs. For a full decade since the time when they were ducklings they swam gravely about on its six-by-ten-foot surface, blissfully happy, and apparently unaware that water ever comes in larger pieces. Sometimes, also, they chased one another with dizzy playfulness round and round its narrow circumference; stood on their heads to search for the worms they never found in its concrete bottom; or splashed madly for the shower baths they loved to take. From them in their time, I got many lessons in gladness and much moral instruction. A little world, I learned, is as big as one thinks and makes it. To be a big duck in a small pond is not necessarily ignoble. One can have Lake Michigan in one's back yard if one wants to, for water is much the same everywhere. It is better to make use of what one has than to regret what one has not. Where ignorance is bliss - b When we are unhappy it is less often because we lack something than because we do not know how to use what we have. Ducks want but little here below. When, after a long and happy life - one had "become a mother" for the first time at the age of twelve - these ducks at last fed a fox and her cubs, I decided to keep frogs. I refur- bished the pool which had leaked and gone dry and being, I am afraid, a man of too little faith even in nature, I planned vaguely to col- lect from some pond specimens which I hoped might be persuaded to settle down with me. I should have known better. Two days after my pool had been filled, the first frog had discovered it and taken up per- manent residence. Within a week there was at least one individual of each of the four usual species of the region: the two spotted sorts, palustris and pipiens, which most people can- not tell apart; damit ans, the robust fellow with the green neck and head; and catesbiana, the huge double bass who alone has a right to the name "bullfrog." Sometimes they hide in the herbage or under a stone. Nearly always, however, at least one or two sit on the rough slab-topped rim of the pool - motionless, un- blinking, sublimely confident that sooner or later, but quite safely in time, some insect will pass by to be snatched with a lightning tongue. That tongue's unerring flashing speed is proof enough that the frogs are not unaware of the external world as they sit, seemingly absorbed in meditation. Yet, for all that effortless alert- ness, they are as exempt as the lily from the curse of Cain. They do not work for a living, 60 winter 1951</page><page sequence="2">they do not hunt for their food. They do not even sing for their supper. They merely wait confidently for it to pass by and they do their singing afterward. As the year rolls along I hope that I may learn something from them just as I did from their predecessors. But whatever they may have to teach me, it will not be as easily trans- latable into human terms as the lesson of the ducks. Because the latter were warm-blooded, they were much closer to me in situation and philosophy. Gladness and pain were recogniza- bly the same things for them and me. They could actually set me an example when they rejoiced so unmistakably in the little pool which had to serve them in lieu of a lake. But the frogs are antediluvian. Like me they are alive, and their protoplasm is very much like mine. But they seem cold-blooded in a figura- tive as well as in the literal sense. They doubt- less feel the difference between well-being and its reverse, indeed, and for all I know their satisfaction may be as deep as mine, or deeper. But these satisfactions are different. To them is possible some power merely to endure, some monumental quietism which neither the ducks nor I could ever hope to achieve. That is one of the reasons why I like to have them about, why I am so acutely aware of the strangeness of having almost at my door- step these creatures who can show me what it meant to be alive those millions of years ago when the amphibia were the most progressive and the most adventurous - one is almost tempted to say the most warm-blooded and passionate - of living creatures. at least one thing which I already knew, my frogs have taught several visitors who con- sented to inspect them. Part-time countrymen though all these visitors were, several saw for the first time that the frog, like the toad, is not "ugly and venomous," but "interesting looking" instead. And this, as I know, is half way to the truth that they are really beautiful in their own way, asking only that we enlarge our conception of beauty to include one more of nature's many kinds. They are as triumph- antly what they are as man has ever succeeded in becoming, and no human imagination could devise a new creature so completely "right" according to the laws of his own structure and his own being. They are the perfect em- bodiment of frogginess, both outwardly and inwardly, and nearly every individual achieves, as very, very few human beings do, what the Greeks would have called his entelechy - the complete realization of that possibility which he suggests. Frogs are not shadows of an ideal frog but the ideal itself. There is scarcely one which is not either a froggy Belvedere or a froggy de Milo. To see this one need only go to frogs as certain critics used to tell us we should go to works of art, asking first "What is its intention?" and then "How well was that in- tention realized?" I do not know what human being was the first to say that reptiles are not "vile" and toads not loathsome. I know that these adjec- tival cliches lingered in even the literature of natural history down almost to our own time and that perhaps most people still pick their way foppishly about the world rather proud of the distaste aroused by most of the living things which share the world with them and convinced, apparently, that nearly all things except themselves were mistakes on the part of the Creator. Most are still very far from catching up with Sir Thomas Browne who, three hundred years ago, wrote into his Religio Medici something for which I am very grate- ful: "I cannot tell by what logic we call a toad, a bear, or an elephant ugly; they being created in those outward shapes and figures which best express the actions of their inward forms. ... To speak yet more narrowly, there was never anything ugly or misshapen, but the chaos. . . . All things are artificial; for na- ture is the art of God." One of my lady visitors, after looking for a southwest Review 61</page><page sequence="3">while at Catesbiana, expressed the opinion that he was "cute" and I restrained myself because I recognized that she meant well, that this preposterous adjective was even, for her, the first faint beginning of wisdom. I did not ask her, as I fain would have done, if the prehis- toric saurians were "cute," if contemplating the stretches of geological time was amusing, and if the forests of the carboniferous age were "sweet." As my frog gazed at both of us with eyes which had seen the first mammalian dawn, looked straight ahead through thou- sands of milleniums before the first lowly pri- mate appeared, and so seen more of the world than all mankind put together, I asked him to forgive the impertinence of this latecomer. The orientals say that God made the cat in order that man might have the pleasure of petting a tiger. By that logic He must have made frogs so that we can commune safely with a brontosaur. during the last two centuries, more has been written about the attitude of man toward the animals than was written in two thousand years before. Very little has been said even yet about their attitude toward us , and I some- times wonder if that is a coming topic as its opposite was beginning to be when Alexander Pope wrote the "Essay on Man" - which is, as a matter of fact, almost as much about man's fellows as it is about man. Till at least dogs and cats begin to write books there is bound to be a rather large element of speculation in any treatment of the subject, but we can at least imagine what some of the domestic ani- mals might say. Miss Sylvia Townsend Warner made one disillusioned canine say to another: "The more I see of dogs the better I like men," but I am afraid that is a bit anthropomorphic - and so, I suppose, are the implications of my own frequent wish that I could hear the comment of some wise, tolerant collie on the conclusion concerning human nature to be deduced from the juxtaposition of the state- ment that "the dog is man's best friend" with the familiar remark: "I wouldn't treat a dog that way." It is not, however, in the spirit of such frivolity or such cynicism that I wonder what my frogs think of me. They think something, for they show some awareness of my existence which a grasshopper, for instance, does not. In a terrarium on my window is a huge, ten-inch salamander from Florida with whom I have had some relation for eight or nine years. At least when he is hungry he looks up if I pass by, and he will waddle toward me if I hand him a worm. Already my bullfrog will take beef from the end of a string when I offer it, but he has given no sign that he connects me with the bounty. Even if he comes at last to do so I still shall not know whether it is more than a quasi-mechanical association of a succession of events. My old housekeeper re- peatedly assures me that the salamander "knows" her, and while I think that probably a large overinterpretation I am nevertheless not convinced that the animal mind is the mere set of reflexes that the behaviorists confidently assert it to be. I admit that in eight years this salamander and I have got into no very intimate two-sided relationship, and so I wonder what the bud- ding acquaintance between me and the frog will come to. On his side, I imagine, it will not come to very much, and I will not mean much in his consciousness. He is nearer to me than a grasshopper would be, as our sun is nearer to us than Betelgeuse. But the distance is still vast as we measure things. The frog and I can actually look at one another, but we look across some gap as wide as the gap which separates his origins in impossibly remote time from mine only a few thousand years ago. Per- haps some Eddington who likes to think of Time in terms of an arrow which may point in one direction while other time-arrows point in another would say that the gap across which we gaze is actually a temporal gap. I am look- ing back at him and he is looking forward to- 62 winter 1951</page><page sequence="4">ward me across the interval which separates the age when he was the latest model and this present when I myself am thatģ whatever intercourse may ultimately be established between us, I am sure that it will be marked by considerable reserve on his part. He will never want to climb into my lap as a certain goose used to do, and a kind of calm mutual respect is the most I look forward to developing. Of one thing however I am, from experience, sure: whatever relations we may achieve will be on a basis of reciprocal toler- ance and good manners. The lower animals never bicker and at most usually suggest only that one should leave them alone. They may fight for self -protection if one insists, but they would prefer only to agree to differ. When my frog gets enough of my company he shows me a fine pair of hind legs, but he will hurl no insults and make no cutting remarks. He says only: "I should prefer to be alone." Perhaps that is in part because he can make a cleaner getaway than people can when some- one bores them, but I have noticed also that in general only the "higher animals" can be bad-tempered. I have seen a seal deliberately squirt a stream of water into a spectator's face - in fact the New York Aquarium used to have, many years ago, a notorious member of that species who did so regularly to the great delight of spectators in the know. But that was only rough humor, and I have never been deliberately insulted by any creature lower than a chimpanzee. When I set one of the lat- ter an example of bad manners by gazing steadily into his face as he looked out from behind bars, he turned his back to me with great deliberation, lowered his head until he peered out at me from behind his buttocks, and then gave what is known as a Bronx cheer, though the present use of it seemed to suggest that it had been invented before that borough was founded. I have never seen any other pri- mate do anything which seemed so completely human, and I never at any moment in my life had a more lively conviction that we and the anthropoids do really come of a common stock. I admit also that my intercourse with frogs will probably never be marked by many inci- dents. This is a price one must pay for escap- ing also the possibility of anything approach- ing a disturbing clash. Their sang-froid is lit- erally that - cold blood - and my blood is too warm not to want, often, a more lively and more dangerous intercourse - with ducks, with cats, and even with creatures as exasperating as the members of my own kind so frequently are. Much the same thing, moreover, I am com- pelled to say about the frogs' vocal observa- tions. The four species gathered around my pool are respectively soprano, tenor, contralto, and bass so far as the compass of their voices is concerned. But they croak at their various pitches the same thing, although it sounds wisest when Catesbiana gives it utterance. The whole philosophy of frogs, all the wisdom they have accumulated in millions of years of experience, is expressed in that "urrrr-unk" which is uttered with an air which seems to suggest that the speaker feels it completely adequate. The remark suggests nothing very passionate or aspiring, but it is contented and not cynical. Frogs have considered life and found it, if not exactly ecstatic, at least quite pleasant and satisfactory. Buddha is said to have made much the same comment after all those years of gazing at his navel, and though I do not wholly understand it I think I catch the drift. It is not, I realize, quite enough for me, whether it comes from the pond-side or from the mysterious East. I cannot live by it all the time. Not infrequently I find myself re- sponding instead to the more passionate ob- servations of Shakespeare or Mozart. But in that eclecticism which serves me as a phi- losophy of life it has its place. It is a basic southwest Review 63</page><page sequence="5">and a last resort. I like to hear it preached from time to time and to know that it is at least something one can sometimes fall back upon.</page></plain_text>
