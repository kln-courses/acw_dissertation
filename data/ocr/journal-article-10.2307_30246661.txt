COLE Utah Museum of Natural History University of Utah Salt Lake City, Utah ABSTRACT Rock art and analogous material culture of the Anasazi-Western Pueblo tra- dition on the Colorado Plateau are subjects of this paper. I argue that Anasazi and Pueblo imagery dating from approximately 500 B.C. to A.D. 1450 can be linked back to Basketmaker II times (approximately 500 B.C. to A.D. 450). Support for this premise lies in continuity of representations in material cul- ture over time. The continuity demonstrates conceptual consistencies in the face of cultural change. The subject imagery can be extended to traditional symbols of the Hopi, Zuni, and western Keresan of Acoma. RESUMEN El arte rupestre y materiales culturales andlogos de la tradici6n Anasazi- Western Pueblo en la cuenca del Rio Colorado son materia de este trabajo. Se sugiere que las imdgenes Anasazi y pueblefiasfechadas entre el 500 A.C. y el 1450 o.c. pueden estar correlacionadas a tempranas imdgenes del periodo Basketmaker II (aproximadamente entre el 500 A.C. y el 450 o.c.). Esta premisa estd sustentada en la aparente continuidad de representaciones en el mate- rial cultural a traves del tiempo. Esta continuidad demuestra las consisten- cias conceptuales dentro de la esfera de cambio cultural. Las imagenes subjetivas pueden ser extendidas a simbolos tradicionales de los Hopi, Zuni, y los Keresan occidentales de Acoma. It is proposed that distinctive imagery extends from Basketmaker II to the Anasazi-Western Pueblo tradition on the Colorado Plateau (Figures 1 and 2). The imagery is first recognized in Basketmaker II rock art styles and artifacts dating from approximately 500 B.C. to A.D. 450 (Nichols and Smiley 1984; Matson 1991). During the subsequent period, Basketmaker III to Pueblo IV (approximately A.D. 450-1450), the subject imagery may not be present in rock art styles but persists in the material culture record. Ethno- graphic records indicate that the archaeological imagery occurs as traditional and ceremonial symbols at Hopi, Zuni, and Acoma villages. Rock art and artifacts of the Basketmaker II to Pueblo IV stages, and probably into the historic period, are extensively described in the litera- ture (Guernsey and Kidder 1921; Turner 1963, 1971; Pilles 1975; Grant 1978; Schaafsma 1980; Burton 1990; Cole 1990; Adams 1991; Brody 1991; Matson 1991). Distinct rock art styles involving subject matter, forms, themes, and techniques of manufacture are proposed and ordered chrono- logically. These categories represent efforts to describe, organize, synthe- size, and interpret rock art within cultural contexts. 289</page><page sequence="2">290 COLE /T\ IDAHO 11 N o 0 100 e, MILES WYOMING Uintah Mtns.

The style of any subject is difficult to quantify, and rock art styles are especially problematic. Unlike imagery exhibited on a ceramic bowl or a kiva wall, marks on rocks in open air locations (more or less obvious or "public") may not be single-artist compositions or related to one social event nor a single cultural development. Individual images may not be temporally related to each other nor to nearby archaeological materials, and it may be difficult to determine patterns of weathering and other indications of relative age. Directly dated rock art elements are rare, and archaeological analysis continues to rely on field observations and use of comparative materials to estimate age and provide meaningful cultural associations for imagery and projected styles. In this paper, imagery is discussed within style contexts and is directly correlated to cultural materials to demonstrate age and continuity. LATE ARCHAIC AND BASKETMAKER II RELATIONSHIPS Early dates for Basketmaker II development overlap with late Archaic occupations identified with the Great Basin, Oshara, and Mountain tradi- tions (Buckles 1971; Irwin-Williams 1973; Jennings 1980; Black 1991; Mat- son 1991). Two rock art styles attributed to Archaic hunter-gatherers - the Glen Canyon Style 5 and the Barrier Canyon style (Turner 1963, 1971; Schaafsma 1971, 1980; Pilles 1975; Cole 1990; Christensen 1992) - are similar to each other and share attributes of Basketmaker II styles, which they may predate. The Glen Canyon Style 5 has been associated with Archaic and with Basketmaker populations in different areas of the Colorado Plateau (Turner 1971; Pilles 1975; Christensen 1992). These rock art styles support artifac- tual evidence that indicates complex relationships between Basketmaker II and late Archaic populations (Matson 1991). This paper does not examine Archaic rock art styles and artifacts as part of the Basketmaker II to Anasazi-Western Pueblo tradition. Possible Archaic contributions (ancestral or other) to the tradition are beyond the scope of this paper, and Archaic and Basketmaker II relationships do not contradict the existence of a tradition. ANASAZI-WESTERN PUEBLO ROCK ART STYLES Rock art styles on the Colorado Plateau exhibit regional variations. Re- gions discussed here include (1) the San Juan (including eastern and western</page><page sequence="5">Roots of Anasazi and Pueblo Imagery 293 San Juan River and upper Dolores River drainages); (2) the Little Colorado River; (3) the Canyonlands (including Colorado, Green, and lower Dolores River drainages); and (4) the Kanab (including the Virgin and Colorado River drainages) of Utah and Arizona. Various regional attributes appear to overlap or converge through time in the Glen Canyon, Utah, area. Anasazi-Western Pueblo styles belong to a rock art tradition that repre- sents anthropomorphs or humanlike images with heroic, supernatural, and generally, ceremonial attributes. The tradition is estimated to date from be- fore 1000 B.C. into the historic period and includes styles associated with Ar- chaic populations over much of the plateau, the Fremont in the north, and the Anasazi and Western Pueblo to the south (Turner 1963, 1971; Grant 1978; Schaafsma 1980; Cole 1990, 1992a). In the Anasazi-Western Pueblo area, regional rock art styles vary over time in the emphasis accorded "ceremo- nial" anthropomorphs, but the subject matter appears to have been continu- ously represented. The rock art of the San Juan region is the most thoroughly studied and described, and rock art of that region is central to this paper. San Juan Basketmaker II style rock art (particularly that in the west) includes realistic details that are identifiable by comparison to material culture. This situation distinguishes the San Juan from other regions where realistic details are less obvious, research has been more limited, and cultural and temporal asso- ciations more tenuous. For the purpose of demonstrating continuity, a bias toward the San Juan Anasazi is not viewed as a problem; however, knowl- edge of the way other groups may have participated in the use of imagery is clearly more limited. Basketmaker II Style Rock Art San Juan Basketmaker II style rock art includes the Canyon de Chelly Basketmaker style (Grant 1978) and the San Juan Anthropomorphic style (Schaafsma 1980) in the west, and Durango or Los Pinos style (Daniels 1954; Schaafsma 1963, 1975) in the east. The Abajo-La Sal style (Cole 1990) in the Canyonlands region and generalized Basketmaker styles of the Kanab and Little Colorado River regions (Cole 1992a) are thought to have Basketmaker II origins with possible representation into the Basketmaker III-Pueblo I period (A.D. 450 to 900). Similar rock art in the Glen Canyon area was classified as Style 4 by Turner (1963:Figs. 73, 80, 94). Obvious connections exist between Basketmaker II style rock art and styles assigned to the following Basketmaker III-Pueblo I period (Schaafsma 1963, 1975, 1980; Grant 1978; Cole 1990). Similarities in materials and deco- rative motifs from the two periods support this observation (Guernsey and Kidder 1921; E. Morris 1925; Morris and Burgh 1941, 1954; Lister and Lister</page><page sequence="6">294 COLE 1978; E. A. Morris 1980). A lack of directly dated rock art, and the fact that rock art regions and sites were occupied during both periods make it difficult to assign age with confidence. The long Basketmaker II period may have in- cluded more styles than researchers have identified. Variations attributed to major cultural change actually may reflect Basketmaker II developments. Four Basketmaker III-Pueblo I styles - (1) the Canyon de Chelly Late Basketmaker-Developmental Pueblo style (Grant 1978), (2) Chinle Repre- sentational style and (3) Rosa Representational style (Schaafsma 1980) in the San Juan region, and (4) the Cave Valley style (Schaafsma 1971, 1980) in the Kanab region - may include Basketmaker II imagery. Despite regional distinctions, Basketmaker II-III rock art styles share both general and specific traits. The dominant subject is broad-shouldered anthropomorphs with rounded, rectangular, trapezoidal, and helmet-shaped heads, which may be attached to long necks or sit directly on the shoulders. These figures range from approximately 20 cm to more than 1 m in length (Figures 3-6). Larger, more detailed, and embellished anthropomorphs generally have a b c Figure 3.

The western San Juan re- gion and the Kanab region appear to have a greater number of elaborate fig- ures, particularly those that are painted. Broad-shouldered anthropomorphs generally are static and face to the front, with arms out to the side and hanging down, although some have bent and curved arms. Figures with short arms straight out to the sides and arclike arms occur in the Canyonlands region (Figure 5). Hands, if present, may be large and shown with spread fingers. Legs and feet, often large if present, hang straight down, or the feet are pointed to one or both side(s). This last trait typically occurs outside the western San Juan region. Hands and feet may have only three claw- or talonlike digits repre- sented. Anthropomorphs hold or are attached to items such as two-prong, crooked, and straight "sticks," atlatls and darts, scalplike objects, and "bags" (Figures 3, 4, 6, and 7a). These types of figures are consistently depicted, and, if taken out of context, it can be difficult to distinguish the region of origin. The sharing of traits within the western San Juan region, north and south of the river, is particularly notable and includes similarities in petroglyph and painting techniques and shared imagery such as anthropomorphic dress and paraphernalia. The western San Juan and Kanab regions have outlined painted images (Figure 6c), and dot motifs and figures with "neck protru- sions" (Figure 6b) occur in both regions. Similarities between Canyonlands and eastern San Juan rock art include broad-shouldered figures with feet turned to the side, figures wearing single ..s .;\ ir,+ BI Figure 4.

Triangular-bodied forms are common in both regions (Figures 3c and 5). Broad-shouldered anthropomorphs may have facial features (usually eyes); headdresses (single and multiple lines or "feathers"; pointed or raised "caps"; vertical rows of dots; birds shown above, standing on, and as re- placements for heads; possible tablitas shown as single devices or as several stacked); masklike and decorated faces (solid enlarged heads with protru- sions; outlined and solid heads without features; "skeletal" heads; faces decorated by horizontal bands, with and without features; blocklike and other facial decorations); a specific hair style that features long "bobs" on the sides of the head; "fringed" clothing (possible belts or sashes, kilts, robes, and string aprons); plain belts; bandoliers (single and double); diaperlike clothing; jewelry and other adornment (necklaces, earrings, arm bands); and abstract interior-body decorations, including dots and ziz-zag lines that resemble textiles (Grant 1978; Schaafsma 1980; Cole 1990; Hays 1991; Patterson 1992) (Figures 3-6, 7a-b, and 8). Gender is indicated. Male phalluses frequently are shown; female geni- talia are rarely exhibited. In the San Juan and Canyonlands regions, females may be signified by fringed aprons and diaperlike clothing (probably a menstrual apron) that occur in Basketmaker material culture including Basketmaker II and III figurines (Kidder and Guernsey 1919; Guernsey and b a Figure 5.

Females of the two regions may, also, be signified by breasts, vulvas, pregnancy, and birth scenes (Schaafsma 1975:Fig. 4; Grant 1978:178-179, Fig. 4.34; Cole 1989:Figs. 3a, 5, 1990:Pls.41, 62, 1993:Figs. 9.9, 9.12-9.13, 9.19-9.20) (Figure 3c). "Hair-whorls" (bundles of hair on the sides of the head similar to those worn historically by unmarried Hopi and Zuni women) appear in rock art of the San Juan (Grant 1978:Fig. 4.28) and Little Colorado River regions (Cole 1992a:Fig. 6.1d). The imagery appears in pottery decoration of the Basketmaker III-Pueblo I period (Lister and Lister 1978:Fig. 4-9) but may date from the Basketmaker II period based on rock art depictions at exca- vated Basketmaker II sites (Kidder and Guernsey 1919:Pls. 90h, 96a; Guern- sey and Kidder 1921:Pl. 13c). b a c Figure 6.

They are static forms and are shown as if hunting, walking, running, dancing, playing flutes or whistles, copulating, and holding two-prong and crooked "sticks," disks, concentric circles, and spirals (Figures 3c, and 4-6). Similar representations, including figures in "processions," have been attributed to later styles (Grant 1978; Schaafsma 1980; Hays 1991) (Figure 7b and g). In the Canyonlands region, flute- or whistle-players are shown standing upright (often near broad-shouldered figures) and reclining (Cole 1990:68, 71) (Figure 5b). These flute-players generally are slender, and may wear "one-feather" headdresses and lack prominent hunched or humped backs (Grant 1978; Schaafsma 1980). Similar flute-players in standing, sitting, walking, and reclining positions are common in the San Juan region (Schaafsma 1980:Fig. 85, 93; Grant 1978:178) (Figure 7h). In the San Juan and Kanab regions, flute- or whistle-players are most closely associated with Basketmaker III-Pueblo I rock art styles (Grant 1978; Schaafsma 1975:Fig. 13, 1980), but the imagery may have earlier ori- gins as bone whistles and flutes date from the Basketmaker II period (Guern- sey and Kidder 1921:Pl.42; Morris and Burgh 1954; Brown 1967; Lindsay and others 1968:Fig. 36; Payne 1991). In addition to anthropomorphs, styles in the four regions include hand- prints and handprint representations; footprints and footprint representa- tions; snakes; bighorn sheep, deer, bears, and other quadrupeds; a variety of birds; feathers; masklike and decorated faces; probable scalp representations (faces with hair, necks, and handlelike loops and lines attached to the top); tablita-like forms; basketlike forms; possible wands; yucca plants; atlatls and darts; projectile points; keyhole-shaped devices (also called lobed circles); crooks (possible crooked sticks); birdlike tracks; bear and other quadruped tracks; spirals, concentric circles, and dots (Kidder and Guernsey 1919; Guernsey and Kidder 1921; Turner 1963; Grant 1978; Schaafsma 1980; Cole 1990; Patterson 1992) (Figures 3-9). Basketmaker II style rock art in the western San Juan region appears to have the greatest variety of subject matter. ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTINUITY Observation of Anasazi-Western Pueblo rock art styles and artifacts suggests that a variety of imagery may have had continuous representation beginning with the Basketmaker II period. Six image classes associated with Basketmaker II rock art styles and artifacts were examined: (1) birds-feath- ers; (2) crooks; (3) flutes-whistles; (4) masks-decorated faces; (5) hand- prints; and (6) scalps. Of the six, the first four listed were found to have con-</page><page sequence="12">300 COLE ee* b -e )) C h J</page><page sequence="13">Roots of Anasazi and Pueblo Imagery 301 tinuous representation in Basketmaker II to Pueblo IV material culture dating approximately 500 B.C. to A.D. 1450. The remaining two classes are represented in all but Basketmaker III-Pueblo I material culture dating from approximately A.D. 450 to 900. Additional research may provide explanations for gaps in the material culture record and serve to confirm or deny cultural continuity for handprint and scalp imagery. The problematical subjects are discussed following the description of continuous images. Continuous Imagery Four classes of imagery have continuous representation in material cul- ture dating from approximately 500 B.C. to A.D. 1450: (1) birds and feathers, (2) crooks, (3) flutes and whistles, (4) masks and decorated faces. Their oc- currence in Basketmaker II to Pueblo IV material culture and associated rock art styles is outlined below. While the subject imagery is found in Basketmaker II style rock art, it may not be included in later styles. Birds and Feathers At least 16 bird species are represented by feathers from the Basket- maker II occupation of Sand Dune Cave (Hargrave 1970:41). Basketmaker II to Pueblo IV materials include feather headdresses, bundles, boxes, and fans; feather robes and feather-string cloth; feather fleching; feathered wands and sticks; stuffed bird heads; birdbones; shaped wood with a carved bird design; shaped and painted wooden birds; bird designs on basketry, pot- 4 Figure 8.

Basketmaker II to Pueblo IV rock art styles include figures holding crooks and crooks as independent subjects (Schaafsma 1971:Fig. 127, 1980: Fig. 92; Grant 1978:Figs. 4.46g, 4.53, 4.54; Cole 1989:Figs. 3b, 9, 1990:Fig. 45, Pl. 46, 1992a:Fig. 5.16c) (Figures 7a, g, and 8b). Flutes and Whistles Basketmaker II to Pueblo IV materials include bone, wooden, and reed flutes and whistles. Also, flute- or whistle-players are shown as pottery decoration and as effigy vessels (Guernsey and Kidder 1921:Pl. 42; Morris 1925:293; Brown 1967; Lindsay and others 1968:Fig. 36; Lister and Lister 1978:Fig. 23; E.

Masks and Decorated Faces Basketmaker II burials include examples of individuals with facial paint (American Museum of Natural History field specimen catalog from the 1893-1894 Hyde Exploration Expedition to Grand Gulch, Utah). A possible deer head-skin mask from a Basketmaker II context has been reported by C. T. Hurst (1942:14, Pl. 3 no.1). Basketmaker III to Pueblo IV materials in- clude masklike and decorated faces and katsina mask iconography on pot- tery and stone, clay and stone figurines, and in kiva wall murals (Morris 1951:Figs. 24d, 26a, g; W.

A sparsity of actual masks is expected given the probable ceremonial nature of such items, which were not likely to have been abandoned, and the fact that masks may have been made of perishable materials. Basketmaker II scalp artifacts exhibit facial paint and braided facial decoration and are sus- pended from thongs. These may have been carried and otherwise used as masks (Kidder and Guernsey 1919:Pl. 87; Howard and Janetski 1992:125- 132). Scalps and scalplike rock art images are discussed in the following section. Masklike imagery appears in Basketmaker II to Pueblo IV rock art styles (Turner 1963:Figs. 22, 47; Grant 1978:Figs. 4.25b, d, 4.60; Schaafsma 1971:Figs. 50, 121, 1975:20, 1980:117, 252-260, Figs. 79a-c, 89; Pilles 1975; Schaafsma and Young 1983; Noxon and Marcus 1985; Tipps and Hewitt 1989; Burton 1990; Christensen 1988; Cole 1990:Figs. 40, 42-43, 52-53, 62, Pls. 40, 63, 1992a:Figs. 5.1-5.22, 6.1-6.3, 6.5, Pls. 7-8, 11, 3-4). Basketmaker II-Pueblo I rock art styles show figures with masklike heads and decorated faces and representations of animal-like masks and pos- sible masks (Figures 3a, c, 6a, c, and 8a-d). These include figures with trian- gular and rectangular heads possibly representing masks or tablitas (Figure 8d). Scalplike subjects in Basketmaker II style rock art, particularly those with decorated faces, have masklike qualities (Cole 1989:Figs. 7 and 8). Pueblo II-III styles show figures with masklike faces and representa- tions of possible masks as well as solid figures with faces in outline that may signify masks (similar to the manner in which katsina masks are represented in the following period) (Figure 8e-g).</page><page sequence="16">304 COLE In the Canyonlands region, Pueblo II-III masklike imagery appears re- lated to Fremont style rock art and figurine representations (Cole 1992b) (Figure 8f). Pueblo III-IV styles in the Little Colorado River region show katsina masks identifiable by comparison to historic Hopi and Zuni ex- amples (Figure 8i). Problematical Imagery Two image classes, handprints and scalps, are associated with Basket- maker II material culture and rock art and with Pueblo II to Pueblo IV mate- rial culture. Similar associations have not been made with Basketmaker III- Pueblo I artifacts, and the two image classes lack continuity with the Basketmaker II period. The material culture record for both image classes is very sparse, but the subjects appear to have long-term associations with the Anasazi-Western Pueblo tradition. Brief descriptions of the archaeological record follow. Handprints A yellow handprint was observed on a rock slab of a Basketmaker II cist at Painted Cave, Arizona (Haury 1945:66). Handprints (positive and nega- tive imprints and pictures) are represented in western San Juan and Canyonlands Basketmaker II-III style rock art (Kidder and Guernsey 1919:Pls. 92b, 96a; Grant 1978:Figs. 4.19, 4.24; Schaafsma 1980:Figs.99, 105, Pl.s 9-13; Noxon and Marcus 1985; Cole 1990:Pls. 41, 53, 58). During the Pueblo II to Pueblo IV period, handprints are located within and directly above cliff dwelling rooms, and pictures of handprints appear as ceramic decoration (Fewkes 1898:Pl. 137c; Kidder and Guernsey 1919:197, Grant 1978:Figs. 4.52, 4.24; Schaafsma 1980:148; Lange and Leonard 1985:16, 82: Noxon and Marcus 1985; Brody 1991:Pl. 24, Fig. 95). Scalps Basketmaker II scalps with facial skin, hair, and attached leather thongs and basketry disks have been reported from northeast Arizona and eastern Utah (Kidder and Guernsey 1919:190-192, P1. 87; Howard and Janetski 1992:125-132). Osteological data from southeast Utah indicate scalping dur- ing the Basketmaker II period (W. Hurst and Turner 1993:143-191). Basketmaker II style rock art from the western San Juan region includes scalplike subjects, including those with decorated faces, side "hair-bobs," and loops and lines (possibly representing thongs) on the tops of heads (Cole 1984, 1985, 1989, 1990, 1993:215-217). Osteological evidence of scalping from the Pueblo II to Pueblo IV period has been reported by France (1988), O'Neil (1988), Christy G. Turner</page><page sequence="17">Roots of Anasazi and Pueblo Imagery 305 II (Arizona State University, personal communication, 1989), and T.D. White (1992). IMAGERY AT HOPI, ZUNI, AND ACOMA VILLAGES At Hopi, Zuni, and Acoma villages, the four continuous image classes are part of oral traditions and religious ceremonies; and the significance of each is indicated by associations with ancestral or clan traditions and cer- emonial use that cuts across social and religious boundaries. The imagery is firmly integrated into historic socioreligious systems and probably has ori- gins in prehistory. Birds and feathers and images of both are extensively used by the Hopi, Zuni, and western Keresans (Fewkes 1903; Stevenson 1904; Bunzel 1932; L. A. White 1932, 1943; Stephen 1969; Tyler 1964). Birds and feathers fig- ure in oral traditions and associated ceremonies; feathers generally are asso- ciated with breath-life and prayer. Birds are viewed as messengers between the upper and lower worlds and relay messages for moisture. They are great hunters and have curing powers. Birds and feathers are part of katsina masks, headdresses, and clothing and are carried by katsinas and dancers. Painted bird images appear on kiva walls, altars, and tablitas, and carved birds occur as ceremonial puppets. Some clan appellations are the same as birds, and pictures of birds and bird tracks serve as clan "signatures." W. Smith (1952:173) has observed that "perhaps the most basic and widely used class of objects in the entire field of Pueblo ritual is that of feathers, which are used both independently as well as for appendages on al- most all the different objects used ceremonially." Feathers are part of cer- emonial clothing, headdresses, altars, and shields. Prayer feathers and prayer sticks with attached feathers are used by religious societies; feathers are at- tached to the heads of initiates. Wooden crooks of various sizes, plain and decorated, are used by Hopi, Zuni, and western Keresans (Fewkes 1898:703, 1903:Pls. 10, 12, 14, 25, 30, 36, 1927:Pl. 2; Bunzel 1932:942; L. A. White 1932:127, Pls. 1, 14; Stephen 1969:12, 17, 23, P1. 17). Crooked prayer sticks (with and without attached feathers) occur with ritual ears of corn and are planted at altars and shrines by religious societies. Chief altar at Acoma is constructed of crooks, and crooks are offered to those taking long trips and to give strength. Crooks serve to confirm priestly appointments at Hopi and Zuni villages and are held for runners to touch "for long life" (Parsons 1933:69). Katsinas at Hopi and Acoma carry crooks as do esoteric society members and initiates. Flutes are associated with traditions of the Flute Clan, Spider Clan, and the Blue Flute and Gray or Drab Flute societies of the Hopi. They are played during the Hopi Winter Solstice ceremony and the Flute ceremony (Turner</page><page sequence="18">306 COLE 1963:22, 25; Stephen 1969:11-12, 47, 153, 336, 805-807, 813-816, Figs. 31, 192, 425, 437, 441). Flutes are carried by the Flute katsina and Snow katsina (Stephen 1969:174). The humped-back Kokopolo katsina borrows a flute from Flute katsina during the Mixed Katsina Dance (Colton 1959:35). Tur- key bone whistles are used as aspergilla and to blow into medicine-water; eagle bone whistles occur at society altars (Stephen 1969:320-321, 172). Among the Hopi, masks are worn by personators of Maasaw, deity of Death and Fire and a force for fertility, and by katsinas (Fewkes 1901, 1903; Titiev 1944; Colton 1959; Stephen 1969). Masked katsinas also appear at Zuni and Acoma (Stevenson 1904; Bunzel 1932; L. A. White 1932, 1943). Masks include helmet or case-types that cover the head and face-only masks that usually are worn with a beard. Graphic representations of katsina masks occur as part of katsina dolls or tithu, altar decorations, kiva murals, manuscripts, official documents, and rock art where they serve as clan symbols and mark shrines and other places (Fewkes 1892:Pls. 1-2, 1897:Pls. 2-4, 1903, 1906, 1927; Stevenson 1904:Pls. 48, 74, 116, 122; L. A. White 1932, 1943; Colton and Colton 1931; Titiev 1937; Colton 1959; Stephen 1969:Fig. 314; Young 1985; Malotki and Lomatuway'ma 1987). In addition to masks, people of Hopi, Zuni, and Acoma use facial paint and powder (Stevenson 1904: 316; L. A. White 1943:322; Stephen 1969:8, 49, 17-18, 23, 27, 95, 126-128, 580-581, 647-654, 713, 796-797, 809-814, 852-853, 873-932, 925-990, Figs. 8, 274, 327). Specifically, paint and pow- der are used by priests, clowns, warriors, singers, social dancers, men and women participating in curing and other ceremonies, brides, the deceased, and medicine society initiates. At Acoma, the faces of males are painted when presented to the sun on the fourth day after birth and at the time of burial (L. A. White 1943:322). Stevenson (1904:316) has reported that the face of a Zuni Rain priest was painted at burial. CONCLUSION Roots of Anasazi and Western Pueblo imagery can be traced back to the Basketmaker II stage based on continuous representation of four image classes in material culture and associated rock art dating from approximately 500 B.C. tO A.D. 1450. The four classes include birds-feathers, crooks, flutes- whistles, and masks-decorated faces. Two additional image classes, hand- prints and scalps, lack evidence of continuity with the Basketmaker II pe- riod but have a long association with Anasazi-Western Pueblo material culture. The four continuous classes of imagery are used as traditional symbols by the Hopi, Zuni, and western Keresans. The integration and use of this im-</page><page sequence="19">Roots of Anasazi and Pueblo Imagery 307 agery by Pueblo peoples raises questions as to how ancient rock art and arti- facts may have been used and, in turn, contributed to cultural and social dy- namics in the Southwest.
