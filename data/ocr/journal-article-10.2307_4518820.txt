Seton's journal written while visiting the Fountain Hotel in Yellowstone National Park in August 1897. 46 MONTANA THE MAGAZINE OF WESTERN HISTORY</page><page sequence="2">in Yellowstone Country by H. Allen Anderson Ernest Thompson Seton was disappointed. He had not yet seen any bears in Yellowstone National Park, despite, as he later noted, "the reputation the Yellowstone has for bears." It was during the summer of 1897, and he had already been in the park for two months. Hearing that bears frequented the Lower Geyser Basin, Seton went to the Fountain Hotel, near the Firehole River. Just back of the Hotel I encountered an old black bear and two cubs. The cubs scrambled up a tree at their mother's command, and it being near sunset I could not photograph them so sketched them as herewith. On Saturday August 7 it was that I spent the whole day in and about the garbage heap making sketches and photos by the dozen. Here it was that I made the acquaintance of Old Grumpy and Little Johnny whose adventures are related in my "Lives of the Hunted."' The English-born Seton had been sketching animals and birds in the wild since the months he spent on the prairies of Manitoba in the 1880s. His first formal writings about the natural world were scientific observations of wildlife on the Canadian prairies, but by the \ 1890s he had diversified his interests and he was looking for new experiences. When G.O. Shields, editor of Recreation, asked Seton to do a series of articles on the West, particularly Yellowstone National Park, Seton eagerly said yes to the proposition. It gave Seton the opportunity to observe and sketch animals in a place he had never been before. In addition to observing the different species of wildlife and landscapes in the park, Seton also became acquainted with some of Yellowstone's characters, including "Uncle John" Yancey, Elwood Hofer, Dave Roberts, J.H. "Old Pike" Moore, and Adam "Horn" Miller, whose stories he recorded-in "Elkland," the series he wrote for Recreation.-His accounts of the Yellowstone country and elsewhere in the West further enhanced Seton's growing reputation as an imaginative story-teller and as an acute and sensitive observer of nature. SPRING 1984 47</page><page sequence="3">W H HEN ERNEST THOMPSON SETON published "King of Currumpaw: A Wolf Story" in Scribner's Magazine in 1894, he began a long and productive career as a naturalist who is still known for his books and magazine articles, his scientific works, and his paintings and sketches of the natural world. Most of Seton's writings focused on and promoted the beati- tudes of life in the great outdoors, while popularizing discoveries made by contemporary natural scien- tists. His animal tales, which usually featured an animal hero or heroine with anthropomorphic at- tributes, were written in a style that had gained great popularity. Much like Enos Mills, John Muir, John Burroughs, and Theodore Roosevelt, Seton was a student of nature who viewed the natural world as a laboratory. His attempts to promote a perspective that combined both science and humanity included taking an active part in the Camp Fire Club, organizing a popular youth movement that used the American Indian as its model, and helping to found the Boy Scouts of America.2 His writings and paintings also reflected this perspective. Seton wrote on a wide array of topics-from The Biography of a Grizzly and Two Little Savages, to the the first American edition of the Boy Scout Hand- book, to the Manual of Signs, which illustrated and explained Indian sign language. His painting was just as diverse-from a realistic portrayal of the meadowlark in song, to lively illustrations for his children's books, to detailed anatomical studies of wild animals. Seton had a deep regard for animals in the wild and was outspoken in his concern for preserving areas where they could thrive. But Seton was concerned with more than wildlife. He also became a champion of Indian rights and a chronicler of the stories told by the men and women-both Indian and white-who had ex- perienced the American frontier. Throughout this process, Seton began to see the West as a vanishing wilderness that was being drastically altered, often in ways that were detrimental to both the Indians and the wildlife. Indians were living on reservations where their freedom was being restricted, and the homes of wild animals were being obliterated in ef- forts to "civilize" the West.3 1. E.T.

Seton's trips to Yellowstone National Park and the Crow Indian Reservation in 1897 and 1912 played a large role in the development of his beliefs about nature, preservation, Indian rights, art, and politics. As a result, the Yellowstone River country, from its upper waters in the Yellowstone National Park to its confluence with the Missouri River in eastern Mon- tana, became the setting for several of Seton's works. S ETON WAS BORN in England on August 14, 1860. His parents were Scottish, and he was raised in the backwoods of Ontario, Canada. During the 1880s, he spent several fruitful years studying wildlife on the unspoiled prairies of Manitoba. He saw firsthand the sod house frontier while living at his brother's homestead near Carberry, Ontario, from 1882 to 1887. Seton began to receive public notice of his work after he sent scien- tific reports of his observations on the prairie to the Toronto Natural History Society, the American Or- nithologists Union, and the Smithsonian Institution. With his realistic sketches and paintings of animals, Seton also began to gain recognition as an artist. He received several commissions to illustrate publications, including the second edition of the Cen- tury Dictionary. In the early 1890s, Seton made two trips to Paris to attend the famed Julian Academy. Between those sojourns, he spent a memorable four months working as a wolf hunter in eastern New Mexico. He drew on his experiences there when he wrote "King of Currumpaw" in 1894.4 On June 1, 1896, Seton married Grace Gallatin, the daughter of a wealthy financier, and enjoyed a quick rise in New York City's social circles. Through his contacts with prominent publishers and his speaking engagements at various clubs, Seton became friendly with Theodore Roosevelt, George Bird Grinnell, William T. Hornaday, Hamlin Garland, and other noted personalities. He also became involved with local wildlife conservation groups and early in 1897 became a charter member of the Camp Fire Club of America, a liberal conservation organization found- ed by Hornaday.5 Through the auspices of the Camp Fire Club, Seton and his bride made their memorable outing to the Yellowstone country in the summer of 1897. George 0. Shields, editor of the club's publication, Recreation Magazine, made Seton a special cor- respondent whose assignment was to examine the condition of Yellowstone National Park's large game 4. E.T.

Grace looked forward to the adventure with mounting anticipation as she and her husband pur- chased camping gear and other necessities for "roughing it" in the wilderness.6 The Setons took the train to Chicago, where Seton's older brother George lived and worked as a printer. In his journal, Seton wrote: At Chicago, we were careful to conform to the custom of the street by buying bandless white felt hats. We have seen none of these un- til today. But it turned out that the wearer was a New York dude [perhaps referring to himself]. The Setons next stopped at West Salem, Wisconsin, to meet with Hamlin Garland, who was planning a western tour of his own, including a sojourn among the Sioux at the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota. Garland accompanied the Setons to Miles City, Montana, where they bade each other a fond farewell and promised to keep in touch.7 Seton had hoped that Garland would be able to accompany them to Yellowstone, but as Garland later wrote: ... as I had already arranged for a study of the Sioux, and as his own plans were equally definite, we reluctantly gave up all idea of camping together, but agreed to meet in New York City in October to compare notes.8 The Setons arrived in Livingston, Montana, on June 9, 1897, and breakfasted at the Albemarle Hotel, where they had their first view of the distant moun- tains that formed the northern gateway to Yellow- stone National Park. Seton wrote in his journal that he was disappointed at having seen "no game of any kind, large or small, excepting a prairie chicken." From Livingston, the Setons rode the Northern Pacific's branch line to the depot at Cinnabar, where they boarded one of the famous Tallyho stagecoaches for the five-mile journey to the National Hotel at Mammoth Hot Springs. Before leaving Cinnabar, Seton made a sketch in his journal of Electric Peak, a prominent landmark.Y 6. Julia M.

Y ELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK was under the supervision of the U.S. Army, a move made in 1886 to provide better law enforcement in the park. The administra- tive headquarters were located near Mammoth Hot Springs at Fort Yellowstone, which the army had established as a one-troop post in 1891. At the time of Seton's visit, the fort was being enlarged to accom- modate two troops of the Sixth Cavalry, whose detachments of two to fifteen men at various soldier stations in the park maintained a steady watch for poachers and highwaymen. The park superintendent was Captain George Smith Anderson, a West Pointer, veteran of the Indian wars in the Southwest, and commander of Troop 1, Sixth Cavalry. Anderson was faced with several problems, in- cluding the attempt to segregate park lands so that a railroad line could be built to Cooke City, Montana; poachers illegally hunting buffalo to take advantage of the high prices taxidermists offered for bison "scalps"; and the poor condition of the park's roads. But Anderson tackled all of these problems with en- thusiasm and became known locally as the "Czar of the Yellowstone." By 1897, then, the park's ad- ministration was in good shape.10 Anderson was more than happy to play host to the Recreation Magazine correspondent and his wife, who trooped into the lobby of the National Hotel with the other passengers in their linen dusters and shaker bonnets. The Setons spent the following day refreshing themselves and taking in the wonders of the hot springs terraces. In addition to the hot springs and other natural features near Mammoth, there was the store where, as journalist Ray Stannard Baker noted in 1903, one could buy a souvenir spoon to "convince the friends at home that no wonder has been missed" and F. Jay Haynes's photography studio, with its elkhorn fence, where one could buy stereopticon views or post card prints from Ger- many."1 But Seton was anxious to get away from the bustle of the resort and into the wilderness where he could sketch and photograph the park's wildlife. The Setons left Mammoth Hot Springs on June 11 in a military wagon provided by Captain Anderson. Accompanying them were T. Elwood Hofer, a noted park scout and guide, and Colonel Samuel Baldwin Marks Young of the Fourth Cavalry, who Aubrey Haines has described as a "large, blunt, rather positive man." In a few days Young would succeed 10. Aubrey L. Haines, The Yellowstone Story, vol. 2 (Boulder: Colorado Associated University Press, 1977), 162-165, 454-455. For further infor- mation, see H.

Anderson as acting park superintendent.12 The party followed the old Miners' Road, which ran south and east from Gardiner to Cooke City, to reach John F. Yancey's Pleasant Valley Hotel near present-day Tower Junction. Of all the characters Seton encountered on this trip, "Uncle John" Yancey clearly made a lasting im- pression. Yancey was from Kentucky, had traveled in the West since he was sixteen years old, and had among his roster of friends the famous mountain man and Crow chief, Jim Beckwourth.13 In 1882, after being a scout, guide, and prospector, Yancey had arrived at Pleasant Valley near the junction of the Lamar and Yellowstone rivers and had built a hostelry to accommodate teamsters and miners traveling between Gardiner and Cooke City. By 1897, he had leased ten acres of land and had expanded his operations to include a two-story log hotel with a kitchen addition, a saloon and stage station, and a large barn and cowshed. Yancey's Pleasant Valley Hotel was primitive, and even Captain Anderson considered it poorly suited for eastern guests. Nevertheless, Yancey had enjoyed the patronage of several notables, including author Owen Wister, Senator George Vest from Missouri, and Senator Boies Penrose from Pennsylvania. Historian Richard Bartlett has described Yancey as a man who would gladly accommodate all who "were men enough to stay and stomach the swill he served for food. Uncle John was particularly proud of his 12. Samuel B. M. Young, Report of the Acting Superintendent of the Yellowstone National Park to the Secretary of the Interior, 1897 (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1897); Haines, Yellowstone Story, vol. 2, 455. 13. According to Seton, Yancey claimed that the Sioux did not kill Beck- wourth but that he died in 1867 when he was more than seventy years old at his ranch near Denver. See E.T. Seton, "Elkland 3: Old Timers," Recreation 7 (November 1897): 370. own special brand of 'Kentucky tea,' which he served from two incredibly dirty glasses, neither of which, he boasted, had ever been tainted by a drop of water. ' 14 Elwood Hofer had arranged for the Setons to oc- cupy a tumbledown log shanty near the hotel. The abandoned cabin had fallen into disrepair, and with Yancey's permission, Seton began to make it habitable, using materials from a nearby pile of scrap lumber. They agreed on five dollars a week for room and board, plus extra for horses and laundry. The Setons stayed nearly two months in the shanty, and Grace found that life there was especially pleasant when other tourists and passersby were around for company, many of whom simply camped out around the cabin in tents.15 Seton wasted no time in exploring the area on horseback in search of wildlife. He was especially in- terested in checking out the numbers of elk, buffalo, and other large animals in the park. For guides on these excursions, Seton took along Elwood Hofer and another old-timer, Dave Roberts. Both of these men had spent many years working as cowboys, prospectors, and mail carriers in the mining towns of the Rocky Mountains.16 While a few buffalo and other animals were kept in corrals for the tourists' pleasure, nothing equaled the thrill of seeing a herd in the wild. Near Junction Butte, Seton encountered his first pronghorn antelopes with their white rump "heliographs" that flashed in the distance as tiny white specks. One of 14.

Once they came upon some elk graz- ing near Tower Falls, and as Seton later recalled: ... all would have been well but for a pair of mischievous little Chipmunks. They started a most noisy demonstration against my ap- proach, running back and forth across my path, twittering and flashing their tails about. In vain I prayed for a paralytic stroke to fall on my small tormentors. Their aggravating plan, if plan it was, they succeeded in fully carrying out. The Elk turned all their megaphone ears, their funnel noses and their blazing telescopic eyes my way. I lay like a log and waited; so did they. Then the mountain breeze veered sudden- ly and bore the taint of man to those watchful mothers. They sprang to their feet, some fifty head at least, half of them with calves by their sides, and away they dashed with a roaring sound, and a rattling and crashing of branches that is wonderfully impressive to hear, and nothing at all to tell about. Occasionally, the group saw buffalo skulls strewn along the meadows, and the guides recalled the time not so long ago when buffalo "abounded in every valley."18 M r OST VISITORS TO YANCEY'S em- phasized the crude conditions of their lodgings, but Seton concentrated on the animal life around the place. He studied the string of beaver ponds and dams on near- by Lost Creek, marvelling at the work of "nature's engineers," as he called them. Behind the hotel was a ridge of broken rocks inhabited by marmots, and Seton and his wife took what were among the first photographs of these "whistlers" in the wild. Seton once caught a skunk in a box trap and, without ex- citing his quarry, carried it to his makeshift studio to photograph it. No one but Grace was willing or dar- ing enough to help the naturalist, but the experiment 16. Hofer, long a favorite park guide, had been instrumental in the army's fight to save the park's buffalo herd from poachers. In 1885, Roberts was chosen to spread the word that the U.S. Senate had passed a bill allow- ing the Yellowstone Park Improvement Company and the Northern Pacific Railroad to run a railway from Gardiner to Cooke City. The report was premature, since the bill was defeated, and Roberts earned the nickname of "Fly-by-Night" for his ride. Haines, Yellowstone Story, vol. 1, 318; vol. 2, 50, 68-69. 17. E.T.

From that time on, the skunk and its mate made nightly visits to the shanty. Seton often left them food scraps and later pointed out that their scavenging habits helped to clean up the garbage.'E One of Seton's favorite stories from his sojourn at Yancey's hostelry concerned a half-grown mongrel pup named Chink, whose owner was a park employ- ee. Chink often amused the campers in his vain at- tempts to catch the picket-pin ground squirrels, whose mounds dotted the area, and in his encounters with a sly coyote that often lurked about the garbage pile. Seton featured Chink in several of his writings.20 During his stay at Yancey's, Seton kept lists of all the birds and mammals he saw in that area of the park and referred to them in the articles he was preparing for Recreation Magazine. At the same time, he had his first experience with oral history. In addi- tion to Yancey, he became acquainted with J.H. "Old Pike" Moore, Adam "Horn" Miller, and several pros- pectors, guides, and buffalo hunters who had been in Montana since the gold rush days of the 1860s, in- 19. E.T.

Also while he was in the park, he met Calamity Jane Canary, the legendary heroine of the dime novels he had read during his boyhood. In July, Colonel S.B.M. Young gave Calamity Jane permission to sell post card pictures of herself in the park, and Seton wanted to sketch her. But as he later recalled, "Jane wouldn't pose.'"22 Seton also enjoyed the company of wealthy por- trait painter A.A. Anderson, an old friend from his Paris days. A few years earlier, Anderson had established his Palette Ranch and hunting lodge on the Graybull River near Meeteetse, Wyoming. As a fellow Camp Fire Club member, Anderson was well aware of Seton's mission, and he made it a point to call on Seton and even furnished him with extra horses.23 Seton and Anderson spent many relaxing hours fishing and camping in the wild. On one outing, Anderson brought along his sister-in-law, Mrs. Mac- 21.

On July 6, Anderson and the Setons returned to Mam- moth Hot Springs to attend, by invitation, the farewell banquet for retiring Superintendent Ander- son. On the way back to Yancey's, they camped out for two days, and on the second evening Seton gleefully recorded that "a coyote sang his song.'"24 After Seton had satisfactorily completed his obser- vations in the northeastern areas of the park, he and his party left Yancey's on August 1. Although Seton had a few disagreements with Yancey over prices for meals, owing to their lengthy stay, Seton always held the crusty old proprietor in high regard.25 HE SETONS FOLLOWED the trail along the west bank of the Yellowstone River, passing above the spectacular Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone as they trav- eled south to the lake. On the way, they stopped at the Mud Volcano, a natural wonder that Seton con- sidered abominable. "They talk of the mouth of hell; this is the mouth with a severe fit of vomiting," he later wrote. Seton took little interest in geysers and "any of the abominable cavities of the earth that nature so plainly meant to keep hidden from our eyes." At Yellowstone Lake, where the Lake Hotel was being built, the Seton party stopped to fish and have a picnic.26 Seton was disappointed that he had not seen the bears for which the park had become famous, but Colonel Young assured him that they would find plenty at their next stop, the Fountain Hotel. The Fountain was built in 1891 to accommodate 350 guests and was noted for its hot springs baths and its formal dances. The hotel's most famous attraction, however, was the daily bear-feeding. At about six o'clock each evening, the hotel's employees dumped the kitchen garbage a hundred yards behind the building, where from ten to sixteen bears soon ar- rived for their supper.27 Like many thoughtful observers, Seton realized that such "entertainment" ultimately could be detrimental to both bears and people. Nevertheless, 23. A.A. Anderson, Experiences and Impressions: The Autobiography of Col- onel A.A. Anderson (New York: Macmillan, 1933), 6; Seton, "Yellowstone Bears. Crow Indians. 1897," 33. 24.

Seton later related an incident in which a female black bear bat- tled an old male grizzly in order to protect her young. Many of these bears came around so often that the hotel staff gave them names. It was here that Seton became acquainted with Old Grumpy and her sickly, lame cub, Little Johnny, whose story he later told. Grace later wrote that while her husband "spent the entire day in the garbage heap watching the bears,... I did the conventional thing and saw the sights.' 28 After a week at the Fountain Hotel, the Setons took a long day's ride north to Fort Yellowstone and Mammoth Hot Springs. On the way, at Golden Gate Canyon, the naturalist made his initial acquaintance with the small creatures known as conies, or "rock rabbits," that built their nests in the jumbled piles of boulders. Summing up his experiences in Yellow- stone National Park, Seton wrote that "it was solely the joy of being among animals that led me to spend all one summer ... in the Wonderland of the West."29 The trip was far from over for the Setons, how- ever. From Billings, they took the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad to the Crow Indian Reserva- tion in southeastern Montana. Ever since his earlier 28. Seton, "Yellowstone Bears.

It was mid August, and his schedule did not allow for a lengthy stay, so the visit lasted for less than two weeks. But those two weeks had a significant impact on Seton and affected the course of his life and his profession. A T CROW AGENCY HEADQUARTERS, the Setons were greeted by Lieutenant J.W. Watson, the acting agent, and by art- ist Elbridge Ayer Burbank. Burbank's un- cle, Edward E. Ayer, who was first president of the Field Columbian Museum of Chicago, had commis- sioned him to do a series of portraits of prominent In- dian chiefs.30 Burbank showed the Setons the rise above the Lit- tle Big Horn that was dotted with white markers where Custer and his men had fallen in 1876. Lieu- tenant Watson furnished horses for the three-mile ride to the site, and Grace's mount proved to be ex- ceedingly difficult to handle. Grace had learned to ride during her childhood; but as she later reported, her rawboned bay was a "great goer." When the par- ty began the return trip from the battlefield, the bay suddenly bolted and galloped back toward the stables. Grace managed to stay on until the animal stopped in its own pasture, at which point, "seeking to console myself as I got off, I murmured, 'Well, it was a sensation any way-an absolutely new one.`'31 31. G.G. Seton, A Woman Tenderfoot, 218-226. 53</page><page sequence="9">The next day, Burbank took the Setons on a five- mile bicycle ride to a grove of what he called "Dead- trees"-cottonwoods in which the Crow placed their dead. Coming upon one wrapped body that had fallen and been partially eaten by coyotes, Burbank removed some brass rings and a wooden armlet, which he presented to Grace. While Seton searched the grove for wildlife, Burbank climbed a tree to ex- amine other corpses. A few minutes later, two In- dians rode up and warned the trio not to "touch 'em." Realizing the Indians' sensitivity to such things, the party needed no further warning and bicycled back to the agency, as Grace remembered, "like spanked children."32 During the next few days, Seton interviewed some of the Crow scouts who had participated in the ill- fated Custer campaign. White Swan, who had been maimed as a result of wounds suffered while on a scouting mission for Custer, could not hear or speak and communicated in Indian sign language. Even though the federal government never pensioned White Swan for his services, he managed to eke out a living selling sketches of himself and of animals. White Swan patterned his animals after the figures that appear in Indian religious symbols. He drew himself with no arms and only one good leg to reflect the extent of his disabilities. Seton not only bought many of his art pieces, but he also became a willing student in the art of sign talk.33 Seton also added to his rapidly growing collection of Indian artifacts. After purchasing some buckskin from a local trader, he commissioned Lottie Shoe- string to make him a beaded war shirt. Lottie had made a similar shirt for General Nelson A. Miles, then U.S. Army Chief of Staff, who despite his many campaigns during the Indian Wars had long been sympathetic to the Indians. In Burbank's studio, Seton painted a portrait of Lottie's husband, a promi- nent Crow named Sharpnose. He also examined and sketched several tipi lodges and the various designs and symbols that decorated them.34 During his visit, Seton became outraged at the un- just way in which the United States government and its white representatives treated their Indian charges. While he was there, a company of troops from nearby Fort Custer surrounded the tipi of Gray Wolf (also called Hairy Wolf), a Crow subchief, and forcibly took two of his children to the agency board- 32.

During the next few days, tension filled the Crow camp as Gray Wolf and his friends staged a protest meeting to denounce the kidnapping and the white man's policy in general.35 Seton was further incensed at the pharisaical at- titudes and actions of the local missionary, the Reverend Mr. Burgess, a young Episcopalian minis- ter recently graduated from seminary, who was ap- palled at the Indians' dances and other "pagan orgies." Friction erupted after Clifford White-Shirt and Lottie Jack-Knife, a young Crow couple, asked Reverend Burgess to marry them in a Christian cere- mony. Halfway through the service, Burgess noticed the groom's long plaits of hair and refused to con- tinue until White-Shirt had shorn them in accor- dance with "the rules of our Church." Seton boldly intervened on the Indians' behalf, saying "Your church has no right to make any such rules .... Jesus Christ himself wore his hair long and Samson made the ruinous mistake of his life when he allowed them to cut his hair." The ceremony broke up, and the cou- 35.

It appears that Seton used the names Gray Wolf and Hairy Wolf interchangeably; the name in the Crow language translated either way. 54</page><page sequence="10">ple "eloped and were married Indian fashion in camp that night."36 Seton also met Plenty-Coups, the colorful Crow chief, who was a gifted speaker and was esteemed by both his own people and the white authorities. It was he who calmed Gray Wolf and his friends, dispelling any thoughts of open rebellion they might have had. He urged them to have patience, to fight their battles through legal channels, and to wait for things to im- prove. Seton witnessed this dramatic speech and perhaps it inspired him all the more to join the grow- ing roster of Indian sympathizers and reformers.37 Seton and Burbank later visited the country store that Plenty-Coups managed. Seton was intrigued with the chief's ingenious bookkeeping system, which consisted of a shoebox marked with one totem for each customer, under each of which was a pencil stroke for every dollar the customer owed. Seton bor- rowed the ledger and made a duplicate on another shoebox. He then gave the duplicate to Plenty-Coups and added the original to his collection of souvenirs.38 Before the Setons left the Crow Agency, Plenty- Coups invited them to be the guests of honor at a grand council in his tipi. At the ceremonial, Seton was welcomed as the distinguished stranger who loved the animals and understood the wild things. In sign language, Seton accepted the accolades and declared that he and his wife had traveled "for three sleeps" to meet the chief. An Indian woman then handed Plenty-Coups an elaborately decorated soap- stone pipe that had been lit with a coal, and he blew smoke in four directions to represent the Four Winds or Spirits. Plenty-Coups then handed the pipe to Gray Wolf on his right, who repeated the process, then to White Swan on his left, and so on down the line in a zigzag fashion. Despite the pipe's foul smell, Seton did his part dutifully. Finally, it was passed to Grace, who was seated near the tent door. She remembered the pipe as "the nastiest tasting and smelling thing that ever got into an unwilling mouth," but she per- formed the ceremony diplomatically. After all, it was an honor to have the Great Spirit "accept greeting from the paleface squaw." When their train left the agency on September 3, the Setons felt a new ap- preciation for Plenty-Coups and for Indians in general. Grace later stated: "Long may he couch on sage brush, talk in sign language, and write in pic- tograph! Civilization has nothing to teach him." 3 36. Seton, "The Yellowstone Trip," 5-6. 37. J.M.

B F EFORE RETURNING TO New York, the Setons stopped for a few days in Medora, North Dakota, as the guests of Badlands dude rancher Howard Eaton. Here Seton completed his reports and went on a three-day wolf hunt, which became the basis for his story, "Bad- lands Billy." When Seton returned to New York, he submitted his reports to G.O. Shields for publication as a six-part series entitled "Elkland," which ap- peared in Recreation from September through the following February. In these articles, Seton longed for a simpler past, but he knew that development was inevitable. Like a growing number of Americans, Seton looked forward to the future and thought of ways to preserve the remaining wilderness areas. He was especially interested in his colleagues' proposed creation of more national parks that would serve as wildlife sanctuaries.40 Seton also recognized the historical significance of events as remembered by the older Indians and whites he had encountered on his trip West. He con- sidered their oral histories to be "endangered species" and believed that historians should record their stories before they were lost forever. He criti- cized American magazines for being more con- cerned with "trifling diplomatic and political events overseas" than with what was happening to the na- tion's growth and development. In his "Old Timers" article, Seton wrote: This Westward march of the white race has at last been completed, and a vast empire final- ly wrested from a weaker race. Thus, though the fate of a continent of land, untold treasures of gold and millions of human beings have been decided within 2 generations-after thousands of battles and thousands of deeds of incredible heroism on both sides, it has not yet occurred to the average historian, that here is any event worth writing about.4' Perhaps Seton was attempting to create a new public awareness of the nation's pioneer past and of its effect on the present. Certainly Theodore Roosevelt and other colleagues of Seton's shared similar views and feelings. Much of what Seton ex- pressed in his "Old Timers" article was inspired in part by Roosevelt's multi-volumed history, The Win- ning of the West.42 Seton especially wanted the public to be aware of the Indians, their importance in history, and their 40.

Having earned the confidence of the Indians at the Crow Agency, Seton declared that he would one day publish their versions of the Indian wars. Seton hated Custer and his "noble hero" image and became particularly critical of the federal government's policy of removal and reservations. Responding to the white man's misunderstandings, Seton began to collect information to support his ad- miration of Indian customs and habits. At this point in his career, however, his interest in Indians did not translate as easily to the printed page as did his knowledge of animals. Reservations could never do for Indians as sanctuaries did for wildlife.43 Occa- sionally, Seton regretted that he had not lived during the days when the buffalo ran free and the Indians were unmolested. Seton's blending of nostalgia with the present and future of the American West is best stated in the concluding paragraph of his "Old Timers" article, which he extracted from a journal entry: Here by the campfire we sit. . . amid the historical scenes in this ancient land of the Crows.... Here I am gathering the fragments of their past history .., and while hearkening to the wild tales of the mountains and of the past there comes over me a strange feeling of sadness, that almost shapes itself into the ques- tion, "Why was I born too late?" Then common sense reminds me that the glamour of memory and romance is over it all; that 20 years from now the present will wear the same charm for the younger men, and that, after all, the best, the very best of all times, is the living present.44 Seton's trip to Yellowstone National Park and the Crow Agency helped to boost him into the limelight as a popular author and lecturer on wildlife conser- vation. His books, Wild Animals I Have Known, Biography of a Grizzly, Lives of the Hunted, and other collections of animal stories (some of which were set in the Yellowstone country) became best-sellers, en- couraging other writers and wildlife enthusiasts to pursue the realistic animal story genre. N 1903, THE SO-CALLED nature faker con- troversy erupted when John Burroughs pub- lished an article denouncing these authors as "sham naturalists." Seton quickly sought to prove the scientific credibility of his stories by publishing the data gathered from his observations and interviews. The two-volumed Life-Histories of Northern Animals (1909) featured many of the obser- vations he made in Yellowstone National Park, as 43. J.M. Seton, By a Thousand Fires, 119. 44. Seton, "Yellowstone Bears. Crow Indians. 1897," 39; "Old Timers," 371. well as those made on subsequent field trips to the Grand Tetons and the Wind River country in Wyo- ming, the Sierra Nevada in California, the Rockies in Colorado, the Bitterroots on the Montana-Idaho border, and the arctic barren grounds in Canada's Northwest Territories.45 At the same time, Seton's interest in Indian cul- ture and concern for the Indians' plight continued to grow. In 1902, he launched his Woodcraft Indian or- ganization in which he sought to teach America's youth how to camp and survive in the wild, to enjoy the outdoors, and to appreciate Indian values, in- cluding the Indians' spiritual relationship with nature. Through his lectures, manuals, and books, such as Two Little Savages, Seton attracted thousands of young people and their parents to his movement. Many scientists, authors, and educators endorsed Seton's program as a unique part of the ar- cadian movement so prevalent at the time.46 By 1910, the Woodcraft Indians had around 200,000 boys in its ranks. When the Boy Scout move- ment reached the United States, Seton tried to incor- porate his woodcraft principles into it. Although his philosophy and ideas were not shared by all mem- bers of the Boy Scout Executive Board, Seton was elected as the organization's "Chief Scout," an ex of- ficio position that mainly involved public relations.47 In late August 1912, during his tenure as Chief Scout, Seton and his wife returned to Yellowstone National Park and the Crow Agency. During the fif- teen years since their last visit, a hospital had been built at Mammoth Hot Springs; the Gallatin Road connecting Bozeman, Montana, with the West En- trance had been opened; and for the first time rail passengers could enter the park through the East En- trance from Cody, Wyoming. John Yancey had died of pneumonia in 1903, just days after he had attended President Roosevelt's dedication of the North En- trance arch. Yancey's nephew had sold the family's lease to the Pleasant Valley Hotel after the main building had burned. The Lake Hotel had been en- larged, and the Fountain Hotel now had a rival in the form of the rustic Old Faithful Inn.48 The park superintendent was Colonel Lloyd Mel- ton Brett of the First Cavalry.

Brett was the last army of- ficer to run the park, and he helped prepare it for two far-reaching changes: the use of automobiles and the establishment of a civilian administration. The col- onel took an immediate interest in Seton's work and was an accommodating host during his stay.49 Seton's main purpose in visiting Yellowstone Na- tional Park again was to compile an updated list of species found in the park for the U.S. Biological Survey. Thomas E. Newcomb was his trail guide. Newcomb was one of those rare individuals who had literally been on both sides of the law. Raised on a farm in Missouri, he had ridden for a short time with Frank and Jesse James before becoming a hunter and scout for the army. After he suffered a broken leg, the Sioux had befriended him and he had come to know Crazy Horse personally. But in 1876, Newcomb scouted for General George Crook and fought in the Battle of the Rosebud. During the peak of the Black Hills gold rush, Newcomb gained considerable noto- riety when he murdered the famous scout "Califor- nia Joe" Milner, and in 1896 he was fined fifty dollars for poaching elk in Yellowstone National Park. Nevertheless, he had served the park authorities well on at least two occasions as an extra scout and as a detective.50 In the company of this colorful outlaw-hero, Seton camped out in the wild areas of the park to observe and photograph the local fauna. Often on such trips, westerners told tall tales and played harmless tricks on their eastern guests. But once Seton turned the tables on Newcomb with his "hoodoo elk" joke. After encountering several skittish elk near the south shore of Yellowstone Lake, the naturalist singled out a doz- ing cow elk, crept up close enough to pet it, and "talked" it into making various poses for his camera. When the baffled guide asked how he did it, Seton replied that he had merely "made medicine" on his subject.51 Seton also tried stalking the bighorn sheep on the slopes of Mount Washburn and Mount Evarts. At Mammoth Hot Springs, he observed the bats in the noxious Devil's Kitchen and, with Colonel Brett's permission, secured a specimen for the U.S. Biologi- cal Survey. The Setons also spent one night at the Fountain Hotel, the setting for his story about Johnny Bear. After a bear cub was heard whining below their window in the morning, the hotel employees declared that "it was Little Johnny calling on his creator." Before leaving the park, Seton compiled his list of species and arranged to return in the winter 49. Haines, Yellowstone Story, 267-271, 458. 50. Seton, journal, vol. 21, 145; J.M.

Subsequently, he incor- porated many of his stories, observations, and photographs of the trip into Wild Animals at Home, which was published in 1913.52 A FTER LEAVING Yellowstone National Park in September, the Setons visited their friends at the Crow Agency. White Swan had died in 1910, but Plenty-Coups and several others were still around. When Seton learned that Curley, a Little Big Horn veteran, was sick with what he called a "boil over his kidneys," he went to Curley's lodge and used his sterilized hunt- ing knife to perform crude surgery on the sore spot. Curley was out riding his horse the next day, and the story goes that "Seton was the only man who stuck a knife into Curley and got away with it."53 52. L.M.

Seton also encountered Reverend Burgess, the missionary with whom he had locked horns years before. Once Burgess had chided two of his Crow charges for riding and hauling wood on Sunday, to which one allegedly replied, "Oh I see now, your God, he comes just one day a week. Our God is with us every day and all the time." Now, fifteen years later, the missionary's attitudes had mellowed to the point where he considered Indian dances to be a clean, healthy form of exercise and even argued that they should be introduced to the public schools.54 When they left the Crow Agency, Grace went to New York and Seton made a side trip to the Standing Rock Reservation in North Dakota. Seton traveled with Reverend A.M. Beede, the new resident mis- sionary, who shared Seton's concern about the government's treatment of its Indian "wards." Seton's winter trip to Yellowstone National Park was delayed until January 1914, when he was able to take several good photographs of elk, bighorn sheep, and other large animals in the snow. Some of these were later used to illustrate his four-volume scientific magnum opus, Lives of Game Animals (1925-28).55 These later trips to the Yellowstone country heightened Seton's devotion not only to wildlife con- servation, but to the Indian as well. While most of the nation primed itself and its youth for the escalating 54. J.M. Seton, Pulse of the Pueblo, 148-151. 55. Ibid., 197-202. See Seton, Game Animals, vol. 3.

His staunch opposition to the patriotic and military aspects of the Boy Scouts soon led to his unceremonious ouster from the organization's Executive Board in 1915. Afterward, he reorganized and expanded his Wood- craft Indians into the Woodcraft League of America and tried to make it a viable alternative to Scouting, an attempt that enjoyed only limited success.56 As part of his move, Seton carefully researched the work of leading ethnologists and continued mak- ing field trips to national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and Indian reservations. On one such excursion, in the fall of 1916, Seton, Grace, and their daughter Ann went to Glacier National Park, where Seton recorded in detail the animals that he saw. Before leaving Montana, the Setons visited the Blackfeet Indian Agency at Browning and talked with several promi- nent members of the tribe whom Seton had first met during a visit in 1901. Seton took several photo- graphs of the people and sketched their clothing, ceremonial pipes, shields, and other artifacts. In a special ceremony, the Blackfeet gave him the name of Ah-pas-to, "Sign Talker." Grace was named Ni-se- ta-pi-ak, which means "Good Squaw," and twelve- year-old Ann was named Ne-che-poi-e, or "Indian Talker.'"57 Such adventures continued to stimulate Seton's personal crusade on behalf of justice and dignity for Indians. Perhaps herein lay the key to his uncom- promising stand against the Boy Scouts' patriotism and militarism. After all, it was the U.S. Army's superiority and its weapons that had helped the whites triumph over the Indians in the first place. Blind duty to flag and government had caused some military men to campaign against the Indians whose struggle for honor and freedom they had once sup- ported. And was it not a sense of duty, plus the love of money, that had prompted Tom Newcomb to fight against his Sioux friends at the Battle of the Rose- bud?58 World War I and its aftermath caused Seton to be more at odds with current trends of thinking in the East. In reconstituting his Woodcraft program, he became closely identified with regional artists and 57. Seton, Journal, vol. 23, 138-169. 58. This argument was further reinforced on December 15, 1915, when Seton dined in Washington with "Buffalo Bill" Cody. During their con- versation, Cody allegedly remarked: "I never led an expedition against the Indians but that I was ashamed of myself, ashamed of my govern- ment and ashamed of my flag; for they were always in the right and we were always in the wrong. They never broke a treaty and we never kept one" (Tulsa Daily World, June 23, 1936). E.T. Seton and Julia M. Seton, The Gospel of the Redman (New York: Theo. Gaus and Sons, 1963), 30. 59.

O N THE EVE OF THE Great Depression, Seton severed his ties with the East and moved to the pinyon-covered foothills near Santa Fe, New Mexico, where he established his new home and the headquarters for the Woodcraft League. He continued to promote his woodcraft gospel and the Indian way of life. After a lengthy separation, he and Grace were divorced; and on January 23, 1935, Seton married Julia M. Buttree, 60.

Many of the game laws that he and his naturalist colleagues advocated, for example, now govern Yellowstone and other national parks. Many Indians in the West still speak of Seton with respect. Seton may have been called a nature faker and a "drugstore Indian," but he made considerable con- tributions to the development of modern ecological and ethnological studies.61 His sincere attempts to make a place for science, humanity, and art in the study of the natural world are still respected, and many naturalists, such as Roger Tory Peterson, still refer to and use his work.62 In addition, the accounts of Seton and his wife offer a vivid picture of the "vanishing" western wilderness and of how tourism at the turn of the century affected the Yellowstone country and other western "wonderlands." oW H.
