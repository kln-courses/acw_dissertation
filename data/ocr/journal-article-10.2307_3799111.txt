Perhaps in the second edition Professor Owen eould add other key photographs George Perkins Marsh, John Muir, Aldo Leopold, Paul Errington, Herbert Stod- dard, and Rachel Carson. This text is divided into 16 ehapters, two ap- pendices, a proper name index, and a subject in- dex. The 593 pages are of good quality paper, the print is easily read, and there are wide margins on each page to facilitate note-taking. This, I feel, is very important in a textbook. I personally believe that the single authorship approach is best, although some would argue that one man eannot possibly have sufficient expertise in all areas to write a well-balaneed, unified text. The author has, however, sueeessfully aeeomplished this feat. No book is without its faults, and this one is no exception. There is the normal number of faetual or typographieal errors, or both. For example, on page 281 (Figure 8 3), September 1, 1914, is eorrect (as stated on page 282), rather than Sep- tember 14, 1918. On page 282, the redhead duek should probably be referred to as Aythya americana rather than Nyroca americana. On page 357, the author mentions seventy-plus speeies of North Arnerican waterfowl, and it should be realized that there are only 48 anatid species that regularly frequent the North Ameriean eontinent. Of greater significance, however, is the omission of any in- formation on minerals and noise pollution. More information should also have been included on the biologieal ramifieations of mercury and other heavy metals. I sincerely hope that Owen will include information on these viable subjects in a revised edition of his text. In conclusion, this book is a valuable contribu- tion to the eonservation literature. This is particu- larly true due to the laek of good, up-to-date, single- authored texts in this field. I plan to adopt Pro- fessor Owen's text, and I urge others to earefully weigh its merits. The price tag of $9.95 is eertainly reasonable. JOHN N. KRULL, Department of Biol- ogy, Central Michigan University, Mt. Pleasant. The Natural History of the African Elephant. By Sylvia K. Sikes. Ameriean Elsevier Publish- ing Company, Ine., New York and Weidenfeld and Nieolson, London. 1971. 397pp. $30.00. For many years the elephant served as a spiri- tual, cultural, and eeonomie resouree in Afriea. Despite the innumerable eneounters between men and elephants during this long time, and the paehyderm's status as the largest living land mam- mal, there are surprisingly few seientifie reports of field or laboratory studies of the elephant. Until about the past 20 years, elephant literature was mostly of a popular nature and hearrily dominated by observations obtained in conneetion with ivory hunting. Some of these reports contain valid and worthwhile information, but most readers, particu- larly those outside Africa, have no way to identify the reliability of anecdotal accounts. Even among the current writings of scientists there are purely mythical projections of elephant behavior, for ex- ample, the highly variable accounts of elephant graveyards and the functional significance of musth. Obviously, there is need for a scientifically accurate account of the elephant, readable for everyone laymen, administrators, and investi- gators. The Natural History of the African Ele- phant has been written in an attempt to meet this need. As stated on the inside of the cover slip, "The first part of the book is technical, dealing with the functional anatomy and health of the African Elephant. Part two treats the ecology ( the natural environment) and the ethology (natural behaviour characteristics) of the species. The final section of the book is concerned with the more contro- versial issues of man's exploitation of the African Elephant past and present." The S4-page bibliog- raphy is divided into 14 sections, each giving references to the Introduction, the 12 chapters, and the Epilogue. Of qthe 115 plates (practically all excellent black and white photographs ), all except the Frontispiece are condensed into two sections (pages 102-103 and 24S247). There are eight good color plates between pages 158 and 159. The 54 figures ( including maps ) are distributed throughout the book. The lack of a List of Tables is an inconvenience. For example, readers will en- counter a reference to Tables 3 and 4 on page 45 but will have to search until pages 130 and 183, respectively, to find the tables. Both an Author Index and a Subject Index are practical and well done. A Foreword by Terence Morrison-Scott, Director of the British Museum, is followed by the Author's Preface and the Introduction, which is brief and generally good. Here the reader is brought up to date on the ancestry and taxonomy of the African elephant. After a brief discussion on the order Pro- boscidea, the reader is reminded that the pygmy elephant myth has been formally exploded. Then there is a brief discussion on geographical distri- bution and distinguishing characteristics of the two recognized races of African elephants: the bush or savannah elephant Loxodonta a. africana and the forest elephant Loxodonta a. cyclotis. A1- though published in New York, there are many non-American spellings throughout the text. Ex- amples from the Introduction are: "behaviour" and "fossilised" ( p. 1 ), "specialised" ( p. 6 ), "utilised" (p. 11), "recognised" (pp. 12, 13, 14), "sum- marised" ( pp. 13, 14 ), and "programmes" ( p. 17 ) . In Part I, following the Introduction, the writer is at her best, particularly in descriptive work on the framework of the body ( Chapter 1 ) and on the African elephant's diseases and health ( Chapter</page><page sequence="2">668 Journal of Wildlife Management, Vol. 36, No. 2, April 1972 7). This reflects her fieldwork for the Zoological Society of London conducted on cardiovascular disease in wild animals of East Africa from 1963 to 1967, studies for which she was awarded her doctorate. Between pages 34 and 38, where the function of the temporal gland is discussed, there is more speculation than fact. On page 37 the writer states, "Inevitably, this discussion must be partly specula- tive, but the difficulty may be simply a case of modern scientists failing 'to see the wood for the trees'." Some of the difficulty in interpretation of her discussion stems from her failure to separate speculation from actual observation. On page 35 she states "that elephants are indeed naturally territorial animals," but no definition of territorial is given. A definition would be very helpful, since she not only uses territorial as merely the tend- ency for individuals to stay in certain areas, but also for elephants to guard certain areas (p. 35). Regardless of definition, a statement such as "They used to exihibit seasonal territorial clan behaviour under the leadership of senior cow elephants in dry season periods...." (p. 35), and much of the material presented betoveen the middle of page 36 and the bottom of page 37 is hypothetical and confuses leadership with territorial behavior. Also, there is a tendency to formulate statements in terms that have preconceived conclusions, for example, "stress and aggressiveness resulting from ele- phantine toothache" ( p. 37 ) . In her defense, I submit that she presents some reasonable hy- potheses concerning temporal gland functions, her "most probable" statements notwithstanding. The difficulty is not so much of modern scientists fail- ing "to see the wood for the trees" but a lack of reliable information concerning the social behavior of the elephant. Until evidence exists that the temporal exudate actually produces effects on the behavior of other elephants, the matter of the exudate functioning as a pheromone in communica- tion remains entirely open. The caption under Fig. 3, page 26, states, "A healthy, pregnant African elephant cow with her yearling bull calf at foot, Uganda." Perhaps some African eleplhant cows are pregnant one year after parturition, but generally nolt in Uganda. On page 40 the writer states that, "The African elephant has been reported not to use the trunk in cooperation with the forefeet in manipulating logs and branches as does the Asiatic. The author has certainly never observed this type of co- ordinated movement in African elephants." Plate 75(b), however, clearly shows coordinated use of trunk and forefoot by an African elephant assisting its tiny calf to rise. Also, Wing and Buss (1970: 62. Wildl. Monographs 19. 92pp.) described the coordinated use of forefoot and trunk by four dif- ferent elephants removing smlall acacia trees from the ground. On page 42 the functional significance of ear pinnae movements are discussed, but no reference to this work is given. A discussion of declining tusk size and destruction of large and elderly bulls by trophy hunters is presented on page 85. Her statements imply but do not state that tusk size may be genetically influenced; a definite statement would have added considerably to this interesting discussion. On page 115 there is discussion on "the so-called tummy-rumbling." At least two reports have been published on these sounds, but neither reference is given. Chapter 4 on the energy exchange systems of the body is of a descriptive nature. The cardiovascular system and circulation as well as the arterial sys- tem are described carefully and illustrated with five excellent figures. Fig. 25 shows the relationship of heart to body weight in the African elephants both are valuable inclusions. In discussing cardiac rhythm (p. 128), there is reference to two electro- cardiograms of Asiatic elephants obtained by Jayasinghe et al. ( 1963 ). I was reminded of a graph shown to me at about this same time by Dr. James Metcalfe, cardiologist at the University of Oregon Medical School, who obtained an electro- cardiogram of a pregnant Asiatic elephant super- imposed over an electrocardiogram of the female's unborn calf. Chapter S on the control of the body describes the brain, pituitary gland, spinal cord including peripheral nerves, sense organs, and three endo- crine glands-the thyroid and parathyroid glands the islets of Langerhans ( pancreas ), and the adrenal glands. The descriptions are brief but good. The first part of Chapter 6 deals with the life history of the African elephant, including past knowledge of reproduction. Written description of both male and female reproductive tracts are supplemented with seven good sketches of anatomi- cal details. Discussion on reproduction follows the descriptive presentation, and on page 159 there is reference to inter-calf increment and the perioFd olf lactational anestrus after parturition. Begin- ning on line ;eight of page 159 one reads: "It has been noted in the past decade in some of the heavy elephant concentrations, such as those in the Uganda grasslands and Tsavo scrublands, that the inter-calf increment may be wider. Perry (1953) and Short (1966) therefore suggested as a result of their studies on elephants from these areas that a period of lactational anoestrus of two years' duration probably followed parturition. This would ensure a minimum inter-calf increment of not less than four years, an indication not supported by observations made on elephant herd structure in other areas, nor from the statistics of elephant population dynamics in which the increase rates necessitate a 2-21/2 year increment in protected populations to account for census findings, as in some parts of South and Central Africa." Perry's work in Uganda was conducted between 1947 and 1950, and Short's findings were obtained by piec-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 669 ing together the life history of one 18-19 year old female elephant. Buss and Smith (1966. J. Wildl. Mgmt. 30(2):375488) found 25 pregnant animals among 120 adult females collected near Murch- ison Falls National Park between 1958 and 1964 or a mean calving interval of 8.6 years. Laws and Parker (1968. Symp. Zool. Soc. London 21:319- 359 ) studied 400 elephants harvested from Murchison Falls National Park between 1965 and 1966 and found 46 pregnant females among 116 mature cows, giving a mean calving interval of 4-5 years; in Tsavo they found 25 pregnant females in 93 adult cows or a mean calving interval of S8 years. The rates of increase that necessitated a 2- to 2.S-year increment in protected South Africa (Kruger National Park) are based on census fig- ures that climbed unusually fast ( p. 21 ) . This rapid rise was initially attributed "to immigration from Mozambique" ( p. 240 ) . Actually, all the census figures probably include immigrant ele- phants and therefore do not reflect inter-calf increment. During the summer of 1971, Dr. Pienaar, Assistant Director, Kruger National Park, per- sonally informed me that "we are now convinced that our census figures include elephants that im- migrated into Kruger from Mozambique." Immediately after the quotation from page 159 is the statement: "In 1968 the author received news from Dr. G. von Opel of the birth on 15 April 1968 of a second calf a bull to Opeline. This unique event confirms the fact that the basic inter-calf increment is about 2-21/2 years in Opel- ine's case 123 weeks." One can certainly ac- cept her suggestion ( p. 159 ) that variations in inter-calf increments "may actually be related to naturally-operating population control mecha- nisms," but can one accept confirmation of such an increment based on calves born in a zoo, particu- larly when she emphasizes natural environmental conditions throughout the book (pp. 104, 105, 220, 227, 248, and 256 ) ? In the last part of Chapter 6, the writer presents original information contributing toward a valuable and practical field technique for estimating age of African elephants. As stated on p. 173, "it is not yet possible to estimate the year-ages of any wild African elephants with any accuracy above 25-30 years old." Nevertheless, Sikes' work has refined earlier studies on this phase of elephant research and has added materially to our current knowledge of growth and age in elephants. To further extend our knowledge of this subject, three kinds of infor- mation are of particular need: (1) more informa- tion on marked or known-age wild elephants, particularly animals above 25 years of age, ( 2 ) large series of jaws from a single population so that males and females can be treated separately; and ( 3 ) comparative data relating to age and growth from populations under different environ- ments to show inter-population variation. Circus and zoo elephants of known age are helpful, but in the older categolries, age characteristics of these elephants will surely vary among themselves and with those from wild populations. Ghapter 7 on the African elephant and its health presents qualitative information on para- sites, congenital abnozrm,alities, injuries and disease and mortality through misadventure. As indicated above, some of Sikes' best work is represented in this chapter. Eight excellent sketches add con- siderably to the section on parasites. As in other parts of the book, anthropomorphic statements are not wanting. For example, on p. 213 she states, "this nlay in part explain the irritable, apparently wanton and frustrated upward prodding at the trunks of the few remaining forest trees ...." Again (p. 266) she writes, "Since so many lone bulls not onlly have some physical defect, are sexually frustrated and also possess some degree of inferior- ity complex towards herd hierarchy, they may be expected to behave extremely aggressively if clis- turbed or aroused." Part II on the African elephant as a social ani- mal contains some of the weakest parts in the book partly indicating the paucity of reliable informa- tion on this very important phase of elephant ecology and also reflecting difficulty in separating speculation from observation. Early, in discussing the study olf elephant ecology (p. 227), she criti- cizes a yolung scientist who referred to " 'inaccurate and questionable anecdotal material'" in his Ph.D. thesis. Soon thereafter ( p. 242 ) she states that "These bull herds become very possessive of their selected old-age residences, marking them with temporin on the trees and bushes and guarding them fiercely." Unsupported by reliable observa- tions, this statement stands as a perfect example of questionable anecdotal m,aterial. Chapter 9 is on the African elephant and its natural community life. Here, on page 263, the reader first comes to her definitions olf family unit, clan, herd, congregation, bull herd, and loners although most of these terms were used in pre- ceding chapters. According to her definition, loners are "generally senile bulls." Buss and Johnson ( 1967. Anst. Record lS7(2):191-196 ), however included eight lone bulls in a study on relation- ships of Leydig cell characteristics and intratestos- terone levels to sexual activity in the African ele- phant and concluded that these bulls were gen- erally not senile and were observed searching out estrous females. Chapter 10 on the African elephant in man's history and culture is of considerable interest for certain readers. Most American scientists will prob- ably not appreciate the statement ( p. 301 ) that "Tangled though mythology and folk-lore may be and colourful its language, yet it enshrines the treasure of Africa's former real-life natural history with a vividness that no coldly scientific paper bedecked with regression curves and data tables,</page><page sequence="4">670 Journal of Wildlife Management, Vol. 36, No. 2, April 1972 can really be expected to emulate." Neither will they like the derogatory implications to foreign scientists on pages 221, 228, 223, 234, 327, and 328. Chapter 11 on hunting the African elephant obviously will be of interest to the layman and hunter fraternity. It deals with early forms of hunting, which in some instances were both cruel and violent, recent hunting techniques, firearms lethal shot, and successful stalking. I like the final brief chapter dealing with con- servation of the African elephant, particularly the reference (p. 328 ) to "serious damage t,o the park's forests and bush, endangering the natural habitat of other species." The crux of the problem is in- dicated in the following sentence that states "Game experts believe that several thousand eiephants may have to be shot in Tsavo, but other authorities say that the natural cycle will adjust matters." This is the biggest eleq?hant problem in Africa today. Some of the largest national parks in East Africa are vastly overpopulated with elephants. The gross imbalance between elephant populations and their park habitats has been indicated over and over by competent research, yet "Rome continues to burn" while the park directors and their com- missioners fiddle and argue for more investigations. Could anyone with knowledge of this problem conclude differently from Sikes, as in the final statement of her book: "The outlook is gloomy but man has such difficulty in maintaining his own populations within the carryzing capacity of his planet that it seems unrealistic to expect that there will be much room in the future for African ele- phants as well. The best that may be hoped is that Africa's own national governments will con- serve realistically as part of their own natural heritage at least a viable remnant of the finest elephant stock available within well-run ranch-type national parks." Kruger National Park in South Africa is such a well-run park. There the officials have conducted realistic reductions in eir ele- phants for 3 years. They are continliing research, aiming their efforts at ways of main!taining a di- verse and rich biota. Already, there is an initial floral response to the respite from overutilization, and some of the rare animals such as roan and sable are beginning to show increased reproductive gains. Twenty years hence, some of the other park administrators will probably wish they had done likewise.-IRVEN 0. Buss, Deparment of Zoology, Washington State University, Pullrnan. Squirrels of North America. By Dorcas McClin- tock. Van Nostrand Reinhold Co., New York. lD70. 184pp. $9.95. Itis interestingly-illustrated book is a popular summary of North American squirrels north of the Panama Canal. It summarizes much of the current literature in a way that is understandable for peo- ple 12 years of age and older. The general treat- ment for most species, starting with the woodchuck and ending with flyirlg squirrels, includes a short description, pattern of distribution (with a map for each species), and a section on habits. Since some species have been studied more than oiers, the treatment varies, ranging from 11 pages for the eastern gray squirrel down to two sentences for ie Sinaloan squirrel. There is much about squirrels packed between the covers oif dlis book. A few noticeably weak points include a virtual lack olf information on management or factors con- trolling sqliinel abundance. Sometimes the treat- ment of a particular species seems a bit disiointed but, aside from iis, Squirrels of North America is a handy work that should be useful in school libraries and to nonspeci-alist biologists and lay- men interested in squirrels. The pencil sketches by Walter Ferguson make the book especially at- tractive, and the 14-page list of references is a valuable cc?ntribution.-VAGN FLYGER Natural Re- sources Institate, University of Maryiand, Gollege Park, Maryland.

"Until recent tes man's exploitation and ma- nipulation of the temperate forest ecosystem was limited to harvesting its biological productivity by hunting and forestry. As the density and requirv ments of the hunan population living in these areas increased, the nature of man's exploitation changed to include the physical attributes ...." At present "the temperate forest is increasingly looked to as an important source of water and reereational space." This feature was stressed by Gerald Stan- hill (p. 242) in his paper on water flux in tem- perate forests given at a workshop-seminar in Gat- lirsburg, Tennessee, in July l968. The meeting was co-hosted by the Terrestrial Production Secffon of the International Biological Program and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory on behalf of the U.S. IBP Analysis of Ecosystems Project. The objectives of this meeting were to summarize much of the existing data and to establish a conceptual frame- work for the analysis of an ecesystem emphasizing the temperate deciduous forest.
