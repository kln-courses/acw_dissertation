C. BROWN University of Chicago Although in modern times the Sahib Hadith collections of Muhammad b. Isma'll al-Bukhari (d. 256/870) and Muslim b. al-Hajjaj (d. 261/875) have achieved canonical status in the Islamic world, Muslims studying the Prophetic legacy have a long and elaborate tradition of criticizing these authoritative compilations.1 The most salient and influential 1 Goldziher concluded that 'the veneration [of the Sahibs of al-Bukharl and Muslim] never went so far as to cause free criticism of the sayings and remarks incorporated in these collections to be considered impermissible or unseemly.. see Ignaz Goldziher, Muslim Studies II, ed. S. M. Stern (Chicago: Aldine Atherton, 1971), 236. Although Goldziher adduces ample proof for his conclusion from the pre-modern period, today only some senior scholars such as Shaykh Taha Jabir al-'Ulwanl (personal communication) and Salafl clerics such as Ibn 'Uthaymln (d. 2001) and the controversial Nasir al-Dln al-Albanl (d. 1999), dare to question some of the collections' contents (for more on this issue see Muhammad Abd al-Rauf, 'Hadith Literature - I: The Development of the Science of Hadith', in Cambridge History of Arabic Literature, i: Arabic Literature until the End of the Umayyad Period, eds. A. F. L. Beeston et al., 5 vols. (London: Cambridge University Press, 1983), i. 285; Nasir al-Dln al-Albanl (ed.), Mukhtasar sahib al-imdm al-Bukhari, 6 vols.

Shl'I scholars, of course, are not bound by SunnI consensus, and scholars like 'Abd al-Husayn al-MusawI have severely criticized the Sahihayn by discounting all of Abu Hurayra's hadiths as unreliable; see 'Abd al-Husayn Sharaf al-Dln al-Musawi, Abu Hurayra (Beirut: Dar al-Zahra', 1397/1977). Although in al-Daraqutnl's time the Hadith canon as we now understand it did not yet exist, the works of al-Bukhari and Muslim had already emerged as leading collections: see Goldziher, 240. We should therefore view al-Daraqutnl's criticisms as part of the canonization process and not a challenge to it. As such, I have selected the term 'proto-Hadith canon' for this emerging canonical literature. For more discussion on Hadith canonization, see Mohammad Fadel, 'Ibn Hajar's Hady al-Sdri: a Medieval Interpretation of the Structure of al-Bukhari's al-Jami' al-Sahlh: Introduction and Translation', Journal of Near Eastern Studies, 54 (1995), 162-3 and Bernard Weiss, The Search for God's Law (Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press, 1992), 259-60.</page><page sequence="2">2 JONATHAN A. C. BROWN critique has been the Kitdb al-ilzamat wa-l-tatabbn', 'The Book of Suggested Additions and Revisions', of cAll b. 'Umar al-Daraqutnl (d. 385/995). When Muslim scholars first pronounced the formula of the umma's infallible consensus over the works of al-Bukharl and Muslim, the material al-Daraqutnl objected to was excluded.2 Even today, this fourth/tenth-century scholar's criticisms have proven to be the little known Achilles' heel of those Muslims who defend these works against the attacks of secularists and Islamic modernists/1 Several modern scholars have mentioned al-Daraqutnl's critique of the two Sahib works (the Sahihayn) of al-Bukharl and Muslim, yet none has explored the author's objectives or the nature of his criticism.4 This article investigates the possible methodological and ideological factors that could have driven al-Daraqutnl's critique. Unfortunately, al-Daraqutnl proves to be one of Islamic civilization's more laconic scholars, leaving no introductions or explanatory works setting out his approach to Hadith criticism. By examining his collective output, however, and focusing on the Kitdb al-ilzamat wa-l-tatabbu', we can both identify the scholar's methods and isolate his motives. This process demonstrates that al-Daraqutnl took a profound interest in the Sahihayn and sought to correct any imperfections he found in them. He understood Hadith to be wholly the product of chains of transmission, and his approach thus revolved around questions of a narration's form to the exclusion of its content. Consequently, his own opinions on legal, ritual, or theological questions played no discernible part in his efforts. 2 Abu 'Arar ibn al-Salah, Siyanat sahib Muslim min al-ikhlal wa-l-gbalat, ed. Muwaffaq b. 'Abdallah b. 'Abd al-Qadir (Beirut: Dar al-Gharb al-Islaml, 1408/ 1987), 85-7. Although Ibn al-Salah does not mention al-Daraqutnl by name in this specific location, his comments come in the context of a book of which a large chapter is devoted to addressing his criticism of Muslim's Sahib. Ibn Hajar makes a direct reference, however, to al-Daraqutnl in his Fath al-bari' and also alludes to al-NawawI's exemption of the material to which the scholar objected. See Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalanl, Fath al-bari', ed. Sa'd al-Dln al-Khatlb and Muhammad Fu'ad 'Abd al-Baql, 17 vols. (Beirut: Dar al-Ma'arif [1959]), i. 246. 3 See (or listen to) Abu Ishaq al-Huwaynl's lecture series, 'Sbarh Sahib al-BukharV, part 1, available online at Islamway.com, http://www.islamway. com/bindex.php?section=scholars&amp;cache=3000, last accessed Mar. 2002. A student of the late Nasir al-Dln al-Albanl, he effectively devotes the entire lecture to preparing his audience for the needling of opponents who use al-Daraqutnl's criticism and the commentary that it spawned to question the absolute authenticity of al-Bukharl's collection. 4 Goldziher and Muhammad Abd al-Rauf both deal with al-Daraqutnl's criticism of the Sahibayn in their discussion of the development of Hadith literature. Although helpful and highly insightful, these two studies are too general to delve into the specifics of al-Daraqutnl's work; see Goldziher, 236; and Abd al-Rauf, i. 285.</page><page sequence="3">AL-DARAQUTOI'S adjustment of the SAHIHAYN 3 Rather, al-Daraqutnl's objections to items in the Sahib collections stemmed from a methodological sternness and a demand for accuracy that exceeded that of their authors as well as the majority of later Sunn! scholars.5 AL-DARAQUTNI'S life and work Abu Hasan 'All b. 'Umar b. Ahmad b. Mahdl b. Mas'ud al-Daraqutnl was born in Baghdad in 306/918. He took his unusual nisba from Dar al-Qutn, the large quarter of the city in which his family lived. His father appears to have been at least an amateur Hadith scholar. Aside from the narrations that his son dutifully included in his Sunan, he evidently had little impact on the field in which his son would later excel.6 Al-Daraqutnl pursued the study of Haditb primarily in Iraq, travelling only to Basra, Kufa, and Wasit until he reached middle age, at which time he voyaged to Egypt and Syria. He spent most of his life, however, in his native Baghdad. There he remained a prominent attraction to ambitious scholars of traditions passing through the 'navel of the world' in their quest for mastery of the Prophetic word. He had several famous students, including al-Hakim al-Naysaburl (d. 404/1014). Although history has left us no works of a specifically legal nature, al-Daraqutnl was a committed Shafi'I. Al-Subkl devotes several pages to him, 5 For the SunnI tradition that eventually built the science of Hadith around the canonical collections, sharing al-Daraqutnl's lofty standards was a contradiction in terms. Ibn Hajar furnishes a definitive if ironic summary of this fact in the introduction to his mammoth commentary on Sahih al-Bukhari. Quoting al-NawawI, he describes al-Daraqutnl's methods as 'the deficient principles of some hadith scholars, contrary to the majority (al-jamhur) of legal scholars and theorists (ahl al-fiqh wa-l-usul), so don't be swayed [by them]!' See Ibn Hajar, Fath al-bdri', i. 246. Why does he not mention the majority of hadith scholars? Al-NawawI and Ibn Hajar have provided the most comprehensive efforts to rebut al-Daraqutnl's criticism of al-Bukharl and Muslim's work. Briefly, they defend the two Sahih collections by asserting that (a) al-Daraqutnl's objections do not call into question the provenance of the substantive meaning of any ahadith, (b) later Muslim hadith experts concluded that, with only a few exceptions, any shortcomings that al-Daraqutnl might have identified in the two books fall well within the pale of acceptable scholarship. For more details, see the edited version of Kitdb al-ilzdmat wa-l-tatabbu' cited in this article, which includes Ibn Hajar and al-NawawI's responses to the author's criticisms as well as the original text of al-Bukharl and Muslim's ahadith. 6 Abu Muhammad al-Ghassanl, Kitdb takhrij al-ahadith al-di'af min sunan al-Ddraqutni, ed.

BROWN mentioning that he studied fiqb at the hands of Abu Sa'ld al-Istakhrl.7 Al-Daraqutnl died in 385/995 at the age of 77, and was buried in the Baghdad cemetery of Bab al-Dayr. While Western scholars of Islamic intellectual history have paid relatively little attention to al-Daraqutnl, he was known as 'the imam of his time' and amir al-mu'minln fi al-hadltb.H The sources for al-Daraqutni's life offer no direct indication of his socio-economic position or his relationships with the major institutions of late 'Abbasid society. One scholar recalls a young Daraqutnl tailing groups of older Hadith students while eating a loaf of bread covered with pickled vegetables (kamikh).9 Otherwise considered improper, al-Daraqutni's eating while studying was probably excused because of his youth. Presumably the sons of more humble families would be working for their fathers and would not have been free to attend Hadith study sessions at such a young age. We might then infer that al-Daraqutni's childhood was, relatively, one of ease. As an adult, we know that al-Daraqutnl received patronage from the state at least once. He travelled to Egypt partly to help Kafur al-Ikhshldl's vizier Ja'far b. al-Fadl compile a musnad, a service for which the latter paid him well.10 Otherwise, al-Daraqutnl probably lived off an inheritance, for none of the anecdotes about his scholarly life indicate any career or consistent government employment. Al-Daraqutnl lived in interesting times. The 'Abbasid caliphs had ended their long struggle for independence from their Turkish praetorian by accepting the de facto dominance of the Shl'I Buyid family from the mountains of Iran. Yet there are no indications that al-Daraqutnl ever had any dealings with either the caliph's Turkish bodyguard or the Buyid family. Though he faced the same orthodox litmus tests as other scholars of his time, such as ranking the Rashidiin caliphs,11 it seems safe to conclude that he wrote and taught without the kind of pervasive political Taj al-Dln al-Subkl, Tabaqat al-shafi'iyya al-kubra, ed.

Al-Daraqutnl was born only half a century after the deaths of al-Bukharl and Muslim (the Shaykbayn), and his scholarly ties to them were evident in his writings. The Iraqi traditionist devoted no less than nine works to analysing, adjusting, and commenting on their collections. Such extant works include the following (asterisks indicate published works): â¢ al-Ilzamat 'aid sahlhay al-Bukharl wa-Muslim * â¢ Kitab al-tatabbu'* â¢ Kitab fl dbikr riwdyat al-sahihayn â¢ Dbikr asma' al-tabi'in wa-man ba'dabum mimman sabhat riivayatubu min al-thiqat 'ind Muhammad b.

Although competency in this field has always been essential for any serious Hadith scholar, al-Daraqutnl delved deeper into it than most other experts. He either predated or simply chose not to address other subjects of Hadith study such as the criteria for accepting 12 Fuat Sezgin, Geschichte des arabischen Schrifttums, 12 vols. (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1967), i. 207-9. 13 Al-Daraqutnl's Kitdb al-'ilal does not represent any comprehensive attempt to identify the flaws in the entire corpus of existing Hadith.

BROWN sound traditions (al-shuriit),14 or the technical terms used in the study of Hadith (mustalahat).15 While later scholars such as al-NawawI (d. 676/1278) would often structure their commentaries on the canonical collections according to Muslim or al-Bukharl's methodology (manhaj), al-Daraqutnl based his studies on the Sbaykhayn on the transmitters found in their works. And it seems that al-Daraqutnl particularly enjoyed the most tedious minutiae of the rijdl field: one of his most famous books, al-Mukbtalif wa-l-mu'talif ft asma' al-rijal*, consists of a mammoth and assiduous examination of those transmitters whose names appear similar in writing or differ only in the short vowels so rarely indicated in the Arabic script. His Tashif al-muhaddithln, which has not survived, probably dealt with scribal errors in copies of Hadith texts.1'1 His al-Mudabbaj17 (also not extant) probably addressed chains of transmission that included students who studied together in the same circles. Even those works whose titles appear more general, such as al-Ahadith allatl kbulifa flha al-imam Malik*, often consist merely of lengthy lists of transmitters' names and the chains of transmission in which they appear.ls This paper's examination of his Ilzdmdt and al-tatabbu' will further testify to the central role that transmission plays in al-Daraqutm's vision of 'ilm al-hadith. As a denizen of fourth/tenth-century Baghdad scholarly society, al-Daraqutnl sided with the traditionists (asbab al-badlth) in the debate raging over God's attributes and the broader acceptability of 14 The most famous works of shuriit are those of Abu Fadl al-MaqdisI (d. 507/1113), Shuriit al-a'imma al-sitta and Abu Bakr Muhammad al-Haziml's (d. 585/1189), Shuriit al-a'imma al-khamsa. Earlier, al-Daraqutm's student, al-Hakim al-Naysaburi, had also directly addressed issues of shuriit. The earliest known works on mustalahat were written by Abu Muhammad al-RamahurmuzT (d. c. 360/971) and al-Hakim al-Naysaburi; see Leonard Librande, 'The Supposed Homogeneity of Technical Terms in Hadlth Study', Muslim World, 72 (1983), 34. 15 Dr Muhammad b. Sa'd Al-Su'ud definitely sees al-Daraqutnl as preceding the maturation of Hadith science, stating, 'al-Daraqutnl... defined the notion of ta'liq, then came al-Hakim [al-Naysaburi]..., who established the principles of hadith as an independent science and set up the structure that remains [the basis for that science] until the present day'. See Hamd Abu Sulayman al-Khattabl, A'lam al-hadith fi sharh sahih al-Bukhari, ed. Muhammad b. Sa'd Al-Su'ud, 4 vols. (Makka: Mu'assasat Makka li-l-Tiba'a wa-1-I'lam, [n.d.]), i. 26.

He wrote several works that presented ahadith affirming God's attributes and addressing His place and movement. Of these, Kitab al-sifat (ahadith on God's attributes), Ahadith al-nuzul (ahadith dealing with God descending into the lowest heavens),21 and Kitab al-ru'ya (ahadith on seeing God on the Day of Judgement)22 have been published. Al-Daraqutnl even rebutted the Mu'tazilite 'Amr b. 'Ubayd (d. 144/761) on the subject of anthropomorphism.2 3 TERMINOLOGICAL QUESTIONS Understanding the scope and implications of al-Daraqutnl's critique of the Sahlhayn requires a conceptual review of the manner in which Muslims transmitted and recorded Prophetic traditions. The transmis sion of ahadith involved a series of individuals hearing a certain statement and then passing it on through multiple chains of narrators, each chain subject to different interpolations or discrepancies, until scholars recorded these transmissions in the written collections we have today. The original, essential Prophetic statementâundocumented in its own time (or at least we have no documentary evidence of it) and only manifested decades or even centuries later in written sourcesâis what the fully matured science of Hadith would refer to as asl al-hadlth (the core of the report). This paper will refer to this essential statement as the Prophetic tradition. In the language of textual criticism, the tradition is the intangible urtext, reflected in variant witness texts. This 19 See Josef van Ess, Theologie und Gesellschaft, 6 vols. (New York: Walter de Gruyter, 1997), iv. 415. 20 Al-Dhahabl, Tadbkira, iii. 994.

Addition in the isnad paper will refer to each of the witness reports embodying the tradition as a narration (riwaya). One might therefore encounter ten narrations (some with variant wording, contextual information or isnads) of the tradition 'all intoxicants are prohibited' (kullu muskir'" fparam).14 This article also requires an introduction to the complicated and layered notion of ziyada, or addition. There are two kinds of addition: the addition of a narrator in the isnad (isnad addition) and the addition/ shift of words or phrases in the matn (matn addition). Isnad addition is relatively simple, appearing when two otherwise identical chains of transmission differ only in the addition of one or more narrators. Figure 1.0 portrays two narrations (dotted and solid), the dotted one constituting an instance of isnad addition. Matn addition, however, can manifest itself in the form of both literal and normative increase. Figure 1.1 demonstrates a case of literal matn addition, as the text of one of the narrations adds the qualifier 'Muslim' onto the other. Figure 1.2 shows normative matn addition, where one 24 For a parallel discussion of this topic, see Nabia Abbott, Studies in Arabic Literary Papyri II (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1967), 66-70.</page><page sequence="9">AL-DARAQUTOrS ADJUSTMENT OF THE SAHIHAYN 9 Fig. 1.1.

BROWN narration increases the normative value of the matn above the text of its counterpart. In the B-C-D narration the hadlth carries all the legal and religious weight of the Prophet's own authority, while the X-Y version rests only on the shoulders of the Companion 'A'. As the Muslim study of ahadlth matured in the first three centuries of Islamic history, narrations from the Prophet became more legally and morally compelling than similar reports from Companions. This rigid distinction between literal and normative matn addition represents the reaction of a Western student of Islamic intellectual history, whereas the representatives of that tradition, such as Ibn al-Salah (d. 643/1245),25 rarely distinguished between these two species. For Muslim scholars, reproducing the text of a hadlth was fundamentally an act of attributing words to the Prophet. In many cases, they found that some narrations of a tradition originated from the mouth of a Companion while others cited the Prophet himself as the source of the archetypal statement. In such cases, the muhaddithun would consider the narration attributed to the Prophet to be an addition to the first version because it elevates the hadlth to the Prophet, increasing its normative and probative value. In the mind of a Muslim traditionist, this normative increase is effectively no different from a narration that simply adds words to a less lengthy version. Whether a whole hadlth or just a phrase, both are considered 'raised up' (rufi'a) to the Prophet. Moreover, when Hadith scholars were dealing with reliable and trustworthy transmitters, they precluded the possibility that one had brazenly forged part of the narration. An addition, like the phrase 'for all Muslims,' was thus often viewed as the commentary of one of the transmitters that had been mistakenly elevated and attributed to the Prophet. The concept of ziyada in the matn is thus inextricably tied to the notion of idraj (insertion, attribution), or instances where the words of a Companion or any other person in the chain of transmission are accidentally heralded as the Prophet's own speech. For al-Daraqutnl and other traditionists of the classical period, the distinction between idraj and literal matn addition was highly subjective.26 As with the distinction between literal and 2" Ibn al-Salah addresses both topics indistinctively; see Ibn al-Salah, Muqaddima, 250-6. 2 Hadlth no. 98 in the Kitdb al-tatabbu' demonstrates this vagueness, as al-Daraqutnl considers the entire last portion of one of Muslim's narrations to be the addition of the famous muhaddith al-Sha'bl (d. 104/722-3). The scholar exposes the extent of his colleagues' disagreement on this point, however, in his Kitdb al-'ilal. There he explains that Yahya b. Abl Za'ida (d. 183/799) and other Kufan traditionists attribute (adrajuhu) the section in question to the Companion Ibn Mas'ud; see 'All b.

ORGANIZATION AND COMPOSITION OF kitAb AL-ILZAMAT WA-L-TATABBU( Kitab al-ilzamat and Kitab al-tatabbu' represent al-Daraqutnl's compre hensive addendum to the Sahthayn. The former consists of 109 narrations whose isnads the scholar believes should have earned them a place in one or both of the canonical collections. These include isnads that the Shaykhayn used in some cases but not others, or unused chains that al-Daraqutnl deems to be of equivalent value. The Kitab al-ilzamat possesses no discernable organization. The Kitab al-tatabbu' criticizes 217 narrations found in either al Bukhari, Muslim, or both.27 Of these, ten are either additions or simply references to criticisms made earlier in the Tatabbu'. Seven actually belong to the ilzamat genre, as the author chastises one of the Sbaykbayn for not including a narration presented by the other in his Sahih.1H Although the two books are sometimes mentioned separately (see Sezgin), the student who transmitted the manuscript used by the editor who published them tells his reader that the two books form one unit. They therefore share one very brief introduction by the author, in which al-Daraqutnl states that he will 'show the flaws {'Hal) [of the narrations found in the Sahlbayn] and correct them'.29 The extremely diverse subject matter of the abadith included in these two books defies any pattern, ranging from eschatological predictions to the proper way to perform ablutions. ed. Muqbil b. Hadl b. Muqbil (Madina: al-Maktaba al-Salafiyya, 1398/1978), 301 (henceforth KIT). Al-Daraqutnl's wording in Kitab al-tatabbu' is ambiguous, and my understanding follows al-NawawI's interpretation. The information taken from Kitab al-'ilal is cited from Muqbil's comments. The Ma'rifat 'ilm al-hadith of al-Daraqutnl's student al-Hakim underscores the ambiguity between addition (ziyada) and idraj. In fact al-Hakim uses the same terminology for both subjects, with the only element distinguishing idraj from ziyada being the scholar's ability to identify exactly which narrator inserted the comment; see al-Hakim al-Naysaburl, Ma'rifat 'ilm al-hadith, ed. Mu'azzam Husayn (Hyderabad: Da'irat al-Ma'arif, 1385/1966), 50-1, 162. 7 Kitab al-tatabbu' includes 78 narrations from al-Bukharj, 100 from Muslim, and 32 from both collections; see Abd al-Rauf, i. 285. 28 KIT, 575. 29 Ibid. 73.</page><page sequence="12">12 JONATHAN A.

This musnad format is only approximate, however, for many narrations appear randomly between the sections. Sometimes the author places different ahadith from the same Companion in two different places. The work is certainly not alphabetical, so it appears that al-Daraqutnl proceeded through the Sahlhayn extracting problematic narrations, roughly organizing them according to Companions and making errors in the process. Shifting between the musannaf (topical) format of these two books and the isnad-based layout of the Tatabbu' probably accounts for the inexact organization of the work. THE CENTRALITY OF THE RIWAYA IN AL-DARAQUTNI'S HADITH VISION It has been correctly posited that early Hadith criticism revolved almost entirely around the examination of isnads.3,0 Al-Daraqutnl certainly proves no exception to this rule, for both the scope of his writings and the nature of his work underscore the critical notion that his evaluation of Prophetic traditions centres first and foremost on their chains of transmission. He bases his analysis of Hadith on the collection and comparison of different narrations from which he selects the most solid and reliable versions. Like other traditionists in the third/ninth and fourth/tenth centuries, al-Daraqutnl envisaged the universe of Hadith scholarship as a community that ultimately corroborated truth and isolated error. If one of al-Zuhrl's (d. 124/742) students relayed a report with which his comrades disagreed then its authenticity was suspect. '1 For al-Daraqutnl, identifying correct narrations was thus a process of weighing scholarly corroboration (mutaba'a) and disagreement (kbilaf), a procedure that the science of Hadith terms tarjlh al-riwaya. 30 Christopher Melchert, 'Bukharl and Early Hadith Criticism', Journal of the American Oriental Society, 121 (2001), 8. 31 Eerik Dickinson proves that this process also served as the mainstay of earlier pillars of Hadith criticism such as Muslim and Ibn Abl Hatim (d. 327/939); see his The Development of Early Sunnite Hadith Criticism (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 2001), 105.</page><page sequence="13">AL-DARAQUJNI'S ADJUSTMENT OF THE SAH1HAYN 13 The following description of al-Daraqutnfs appraisal of a narration is typical of Hadith criticism in the third/ninth and fourth/tenth centuries: 'The hadith of A'mash narrated from Abu Wa'il from Abdallah b. Mas'ud is the hadith of such and such a person. So and so as well as so and so corroborate his narration, while so and so differs with him'.32 In light of this method, the distinction between narration and tradition becomes indispensable. Many students of Islamic history conceive of Prophetic ahadlth as messages conveying specific legal, ritual, or eschatological maxims. While students recognize that a maxim's authority depends on a chain of transmission, this isnad simply provides them a means of authentication and is not an integral part of the hadlth's message. In short, the hadith is a maxim supported by an isnad. Yet for early critics the isnad and matn were bound together inseparably as the organic product of the transmission process. As the above example shows, narrations were associated with specific transmitters, whose version of that Prophetic tradition could then be contrasted with other transmitters' narrations. Although tarjlh al-riwaya formed an important tool in any muhaddith's arsenal, al-Daraqutnl made much greater use of it than many other traditionists. His contemporary and fellow resident of Baghdad, Abu Sulayman al-Khattabl (d. 386-8/996-8), also wrote a commentary on al-Bukharl's collection and addressed some of the same issues as al-Daraqutnl. In a group of narrations in which the Prophet adjudicates the case of a feuding couple who had mutually renounced each other (tala'analmutala'inan), both scholars note that one of al-Bukharl's narrations describes the Prophet himself separating the couple while in the rest of the narrations they divorce each other before coming to him. While al-Daraqutnl faults al-Bukharl for including a narration in which Sufyan b. 'Uyayna (d. 196-8/811-14) diverges from the majority of al-Zuhri's trustworthy students by transmitting this inconsistency, al-Khattabl uses juridical gymnastics to negate any error. He explains that the couple had indeed already split, and any mention of the Prophet separating them only signifies his ex post facto recognition of the event. Thus, where al-Daraqutnl sees a blatant case of contrasting riwayas, al-KhattabT sees a legal explanation.

Differences in sections of the matm For al-Daraqutnl, in fact, two almost identical matns share no relation if they were narrated through radically different chains of transmission. For example, both al-Bukharl and Muslim include several narrations of a tradition in which the Prophet tells of Heaven and Hell coming before God and complaining about the dramatically different quality of people whom they host. God then explains that they are the instrument of His wrath and mercy, respectively. Al-Bukharl features two narrations of this badith,34 as shown in Figure 2.0. A contemporary of al-Daraqutnl, Abu Hasan al-QabisI (d. 403/1012), and later scholars such as Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya (d. 751/1350) and Ibn 'Uthaymln (d. 2001 ce),35 criticize 'Ubaydallah b. Sa'd's (solid) narration of this tradition in al-Bukharl's book. They assert that this narration inverted the wording of the tradition, stating that God created people 'destined for Hellfire' instead of 'for Heaven', the correct order that occurs in all the other versions of this tradition. Al-QabisI states that 'Ubaydallah's narration is the only known 4855, 4896, 4897, and 6760, all found in either Kitab tafslr siirat al-nur, Kitab al-talaqlmin ijazat al-talaq al-tbalath-lal-li'an wa-man tallaqa..., or Kitab al-i'tisam bi-l-kitab wa-l-sunna/ma yukrahu min al-ta'ammuq...). Al-Khattabl refers to a narration (no. 4379, or Kitab tafsir siirat al-nur) via Ibn 'Umar (as opposed to the others nos. 4377, 4855, 4891, 4897, see above mentioned kitab/ babs). For my reference to al-Khattabl, I am indebted to Vardit Tokatly's article 'The A'lam al-hadith of al-Khattabl: A commentary on al-Bukharl's Sahth or a polemical treatise?'

Ibn al-Qayyim alludes to al-Bukharl's other narration as evidence as well.36 Unlike these scholars, who saw the two versions as narrations of the same tradition, al-Daraqutn! seems to have considered them two separate traditions. While al-Daraqutnl criticizes a host of al-Bukharl's narrations for literal matn addition or incorrect wording in the matn, he never mentions any form of this tradition in his Kitab al-tatabbu'. He was without a doubt very aware of all its extant variations, for he includes thirteen narrations of it in his Kitab al-sifat.3 He does not, however, include 'Ubaydallah's version. His silence in the Kitab al-tatabbu' probably stems from the sizeable differences between the two chains of transmission. They originate with the same Companion, Abu Hurayra, but diverge after him. Clearly, al-QabisI and Ibn al-Qayyim assumed that both al-Bukharl's narrations were versions of the same hadith because their matns were so similar. Al-Daraqutm's close focus on the isnad, however, seems to have led him to distinguish between the two. Since to him they were two separate instances of Prophetic speech, a difference in their wording presented no problem. When al-Daraqutnl does condemn entire Prophetic traditions, he does so only after considering all the relevant narrations. For example, he denies the authenticity of a tradition about the virtues of a munificent man (sakhl) only after explaining that none of its versions is reliable (la yatbbutu fibi baditb"" bi-wajh'n).3H We must not assume, however, that such a rejection entails some disagreement with the content of the tradition; he objects only to those who transmit it. For example, al-Daraqutnl states that any narration conveying the specific tradition 'a woman should not be executed for apostasy' is similarly baseless.39 36 Ibn Hajar, Fatb al-bari', xiii. 437. 37 Al-Daraqutnl, al-Nuzul, 27-33. 38 Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, Naqd al-manqul, ed. Hasan ai-Sammahl Suwaydan (Beirut: Dar al-Ma'arif, 1411/1990), 115. As a devout traditionist who despised speculative thinking, al-Daraqutnl dismissed an entire book of Hadith lauding human reason ('aql). He criticizes this book, however, not based on its contents but because he traces the ahadith's isnads to one transmitter who, he believes, forged them and another who attached them to a set of legitimate isnads. For him, objectionable content 'necessarily' indicates spurious isnads; see ibid. 61. 39 'La tuqtalu al-mar'a idha irtaddaf.

BROWN He subsequently provides, however, other traditions (nine narrations in all) with both analogous and dissimilar wordings that order Muslims to do just that.40 Conversely, other Hadith scholars, specifically later critics such as Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya, often disparage entire traditions expressly owing to their content. For example, Ibn al-Qayyim condemns Prophetic traditions chauvinistically praising certain cities or disparaging blacks. Even when criticizing a hadith found in Sahlh Muslim for eschatological implications, he takes issue with its content per se and not its chain c â  â  41 or transmission. THE MOTIVATIONS FOR AL-DARAQUTNI'S ADJUSTMENT As was mentioned above, the brief treatments that al-Daraqutni's work has received acknowledge its critical nature but do not investigate its purpose or its author's motives. In order to understand why al-Daraqutnl undertook an adjustment of the two most revered works in the entire corpus of Islamic religious thought, one must first determine both his Hadith methodology and his ideological leanings. We must then place the scholar in the context of the changing science of hadith evaluation and its religious and legal environment. As both a master traditionist and a Shafi'T jurist espousing literalist theological views, al-Daraqutnl could have objected to two aspects of the Sahihayn: their content and the methodologies that their authors used to compile them. By comparing the material that the scholar criticized with his own legal and hadith output, we can identify any possible ideological objections he might have had with al-Bukharl and Muslim's work. By constructing a typology of the characteristics that al-Daraqutnl found problematic in his Kitab al-tatabbu', and then finding his place in the development of cilm al-hadlth, we can determine any methodological motivations. 40 SD, iv. 118-119. Such narrations include the wording 'al-murtadda 'an al-isldm tuhbasu wa-ld tuqtal', '.. .ft al-mar'a tartaddu ... tujbaru wa-la tuqtaP. 41 Ibn al-Qayyim, Naqd, 78. The tradition he criticizes in Muslim's book has only one isnad. Ibn al-Qayyim, however, objects to it because of its contents; see Sahib Muslim, Kitab Sifat al-Mutiafiqln / 27, or hadltb no. 4996 according to the 'Alamiyya numbering system. This haditb is also found in Ahmad b. Hanbal's Musnad (Wensinck: 1: 233, 306 et seq.) and in the Sunan of Abu Dawud (Wensinck: Sawm: 9, 51, 52).</page><page sequence="17">AL-DARAQUTOl'S ADJUSTMENT OF THE SAHIHAYN 17 I. Ideology Form: The Tone of the Kitab al-tatabbu1 and its Relation to the Sahlhayn In their studies, neither Goldziher nor Muhammad Abd al-Rauf delves deeply enough into al-Daraqutni's work to address the critical distinction between Prophetic traditions and their disparate narrations, nor do they discuss the scope or tone of al-Daraqutnl's critique.42 Yet such nuance is indispensable in this case. Unlike that in later critical works, al-Daraqutnl's tone in the Kitab al-tatabbu' is overwhelmingly construc tive, and he does not aim at challenging the overall authenticity (sihha) of the traditions collected in the Sahlhayn.43 As will be demonstrated, the Kitab al-tatabbu' comprises a formal adjustment of narrations rather than a polemical criticism of any traditions that its author deemed problematic in the Sahlhayn. This explains the favourable light in which the Sunn! tradition came to view al-Daraqutnl's work. Although al-Nawaw! devotes a huge amount of energy to rebutting the scholar's criticisms of Muslim's narrations, he nonetheless places the Kitab al-tatabbu' in the acceptable genre of mustadrak works.44 The nature of al-Daraqutnl's work does not stem from any inherent reverence for the Shaykhayn. Rather, it results primarily from the salient characteristic of his approach to Hadith: he addresses narrations and not traditions. He therefore does not criticize al-Bukharl and Muslim's individual ahadith, but rather specific narrations of some traditions included in their two books. It would thus be wrong to state that al-Daraqutnl criticized Muslim's hadith in which the Prophet states 'If I were to take someone from my community as a bosom companion 42 Goldziher, 236 and Abd al-Rauf, i. 285. Both scholars simply state that al-Daraqutnl reveals the weakness in a number of al-Bukharl and Muslim's abadith. 43 In his Kitab al-mawdu'at (Book of Forgeries), Ibn al-jawzl (d. 597/1200) often resorts to a condescending tone, frequently lambasting Hadith scholars who fell short of his expectations. Ironically, Ibn al-jawzl finds al-Daraqutnl himself guilty of incompetence. He states, 'And indeed I am astounded by those scholars who are aware of forged Hadith and yet narrate them without clarifying [the defects], knowing full-well that the Prophet of God, may the peace and blessings of God be upon him, said, "He who narrates a hadith that he knows is a lie is among the liars".' See Abu Faraj 'Abd al-Rahman b. al-jawzl, Kitab al-mawdii'at, ed. 'Abd al-Rahman Muhammad 'Uthman, 3 vols. (Madina: al-Maktaba al-Salafiyya, 1386/1966), iii. 91. 44 Muhyl al-Dln Yahya b.

Here al-NawawI puts al-Daraqutnl's Kitab al-tatabbu' in the same category as respectable mustadrak works such at that of Abu Mas'ud al-Dimashqi (d. 401/1010).</page><page sequence="18">i8 JONATHAN A. C. BROWN (khalll""), I would choose Abu Bakr'; he criticizes just one narration of that hadith, making no statement about the overall authenticity of that Prophetic tradition. In fact Muslim includes five other narrations of this tradition with a completely different istiad.45 This is the case for the vast majority of the traditions that al-Daraqutnl mentions in his Kitab al-tatabbu'. Both al-Bukharl and Muslim habitually included multiple narrations for a Prophetic tradition, and al-Daraqutnl rarely has occasion to critique a lone narration.46 In addition, al-Daraqutnl draws over forty of the narrations appearing in Kitab al-tatabbu' from auxiliary narrations (called mutabi' , 'follow up,' or shahid, 'testimonial' ahadlth47) that the Shaykbayn included after the principal narrations in question. Auxiliary narrations served to bolster the authenticity of the Prophetic tradition, but neither al-Bukharl nor Muslim felt obliged to meet their usual rigorous standards for authenticity when dealing with them.48 In fact, al-Daraqutnl never overtly questions the overall authenticity of any traditions found in the Sahlhayn. He certainly dismisses many narrations, but he often underscores the general soundness of a Prophetic tradition. In hadith number 105 of Kitab al-tatabbu', for example, he details prominent Hadith scholars' differing opinions on the narration but stresses that their doubts do not affect the 'soundness' (sihha) of the hadith.49 After criticizing one of Muslim's narrations of a hadith 45 The narration that al-Daraqutnl criticizes is through the Companion Jundub, while the others are through Ibn Mas'ud; see Sabih Muslim, Kitab al-Masajid / 28, Kitab Fada'il al-Sahaba / 6, 7, or 'Alamiyya nos. 4391-5. 46 One instance in which al-Daraqutnl does criticize the only isnad included by Muslim is hadith no. 78 in the Tatabbu' (see Sahib Muslim, 'Alamiyya no. 266, or Kitab al-Iman / Bab Itbbdt Ru'yat al-Mu'minln). This tradition deals with God's rewarding the believers by granting them the beatific vision on the Day of Judgement; for details see n. 73 below. 4' Ibn al-Salah explains that mutabi'a reports are usually abbreviated or auxiliary versions of the same narration, while shahid reports tend to be narrated through different isnads but share the same meaning, or may be a similar tradition; see Ibn al-Salah, Muqaddima, 247-8. 48 In his introduction to his Sahib, Muslim makes explicit his policy towards auxiliary narrations. He includes them if they provide some indispensable additional material or in order to support a defective isnad; see G. H. A. Juynboll, 'Muslim's Introduction to his Sahih', Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam, 5 (1984), 267. He thus acknowledges that his Sabih contains some lacklustre narrations, and he pledges to indicate and explain any defects that appear; see Juynboll, 'Muslim's Introduction', 270. There is some indication, however, that Muslim died before he could address all these weak isnads (see KIT, 246). Had he completed his work to his satisfaction, it is possible that al-Daraqutnl would not have wasted his time pointing out their flaws. 49 Ibid. 313-14.</page><page sequence="19">AL-D ARAQUTNI'S ADJUSTMENT OF THE SA Hi HA Y N 19 (number 187), al-Daraqutnl reminds the reader that Muslim also includes the correct isnad in his book.50 Here it is important to note that the soundness of a tradition is an inter-textual question: al Daraqutnl may find fault with the only narration that Muslim provides for a tradition, but he is well aware that al-Bukharl or Ahmad b. Hanbal offers numerous reliable versions.51 Al-Daraqutnl's constructive tone throughout the Kitab al-tatabbu' also expresses itself in his presentation of alternatives to problematic narrations. For example, in a tradition in which the Prophet lists a number of hygienic duties that Muslims should perform (number 182), the scholar suggests two superior narrations that the Sbaykbayn did not mention. His desire to improve on, not necessarily to criticize, the two works is also clear in hadltb number 137, where al-Daraqutnl simply states that another isnad could have provided a more direct link to the Prophet.52 Content: Was al-Daraqutnl Trying to Alter the Contents of the Sahlhayn? Even by al-Daraqutnl's time, the Muslim community had dubbed the works of al-Bukharl and Muslim crucial sources for their understanding of the Prophet's religious and legal legacy. Yet for critical scholars like Schacht such an understanding, and even the details composing the Prophet's Sunna, 'are not based on authentic historical recollec tion ... but are fictitious and intended to support legal doctrines'.53 As musannafat, the Sahihay?t were certainly designed to serve ritual and legal purposes.54 Was al-Daraqutnl's critique wholly or even partially a vehicle for advancing his specific understanding of Islam and the Sharl'a? We can answer this question by examining the extent to which the scholar promoted his own opinions and selection of ahadltb in the 50 Ibid. 456. 11 Ibn Hajar emphasizes this intertexuality in his response to al-Daraqutnl's criticisms; Ibn Hajar, Fath, i. 246. In one instance, the author of Kitdb al-tatabbn' offers no criticism, but instead defends one of al-Bukharl's narrations against other unnamed critics. Concerning hadith no. 201 in the Tatabbu', he argues that the material that al-Bukharl included is correct; see KIT, 481. 52 Ibid. 356. The author refers to the concept of 'uluw, or the brevity of an isnad. The shorter the isnad, and the fewer the transmitters between the compiler and the Prophet, the more favourable and reliable the narration. 53 Joseph Schacht, 'A Revaluation of Islamic TraditionJournal of the Royal Asiatic Society (1949), 151. Goldziher and, more recently, Muhammad Fadel have discussed how al-Bukharl used the headings in his collection to guide the reader towards the legal ruling one should derive from the text; see Muhammad Fadel, 'Ibn Hajar's Hady al-SarV, 163-4; cf. Goldziher, 200-20.</page><page sequence="20">zo JONATHAN A. C. BROWN Kitdb al-ilzamat and the Tatabbu'. The traditions that he preferred can be found in the collection of legal and ritual ahddlth for which al Daraqutnl became famous: the Sunan. 5 A comparison between the narrations in the Sunan and those that al-Daraqutnl advances to correct faulty versions in al-Bukharl and Muslim's work shows a clear separation between the two groups. In hadlth number 35 of the Tatabbu' he criticizes al-Bukharl's narrations in which the Prophet prohibits all intoxicants. As a Shafi'I, al-Daraqutnl supports this ruling. Yet he does not advance any of the thirteen narrations on this subject that he includes in his Sunan to replace the problematic narration, despite their shared wording of 'every intoxicant is prohibited'.'6 The scholar's perennial emphasis on isndds provides a ready explanation. While al-Bukharl's narrations begin with Abu Musa al-Ash'ari, al-Daraqutnl's rely on Ibn 'Umar and 'A'isha. It seems likely that al-Daraqutnl considered his own narrations irrelevant to his dis cussion of al-Bukharl's reports. On only one occasion does al-Daraqutnl use material from his Sunan to make a correction. In hadlth number 148 he faults al-Bukharl for including a narration that describes the Prophet performing his witr prayer while riding a donkey. Al-Daraqutnl explains that the correct version features the Prophet praying on a camel and that it was the Companion Anas who prayed on the donkey. He cites this same narration through Ibn 'Umar in his Sunan.57 An even clearer divide exists between the reports that al-Daraqutnl appends to the Sabihayn in his Kitdb al-ilzamat and those he chose for his Sunan. He states that Muslim should have included one of al-Bukharl's narrations in which the Prophet instructs his followers not to abandon their afternoon prayers.58 Yet al-Daraqutnl does not include this narration in his Sunan's chapter on 'The Severity of Leaving the Afternoon Prayer and the Unbelief of Him who Leaves It'.59 He also feels that both al-Bukharl and Muslim erred in not including a narration detailing the wording of the Prophet's qunut (an invocation said during prayer). In the Sunan, however, he presents no such narration in his chapter on reading the qunut.60 Again, his narrations addressing this 55 In his Tadhkirat al-huffaz, al-Dhahabl introduces al-Daraqutnl as 'sahib al-Sunan'.

Al-DaraqutnT was a master traditionist who did not think himself unworthy of pointing out al-Bukharl and Muslim's oversights. When he did so, however, he only employed narrations with isnads related to the Shaykhayn's own chains of transmission.61 Al-DaraqutnT thus clearly does not advance his own versions of specific traditions. More important, however, is the detachment of his criticism of the Sahihayn from his theological and legal stances. At no point in the Kitab al-tatabbu' does al-Daraqutnl attempt to counter a tradition conveying a non-ShaficI legal ruling. Contrary to the efforts he put forth in the Kitab al-ru'ya to present ahadith affirming that believers will see God on the Day of Judgement, al-Daraqutnl criticizes Muslim's only narration for a tradition that portrays God lifting the veil (hijdb) dividing Him from the resurrected believers and allowing them the beatific vision.*1" That al-Daraqutnl understood that he was undermining the only support for this traditionalist narration in either of the Sahihayn testifies to the integrity of the scholar's critique. His decision not to use his adjustment as a forum for promoting his own vision of the Prophet's sunna ultimately obviates the possibility of ideological or polemical motivations. II. Methodology A Typology of the Flaws Mentioned by al-Daraqutnl Unfortunately, al-Daraqutnl provides few clues about the methodology he followed in reviewing the works of al-Bukharl and Muslim.63 An analysis of the narrations he criticizes, however, reveals that he recognized nine species of flaws in the material he examined. These consist of objective flaws, which stand out independently as defects in al-Daraqutnl's opinion, and comparative flaws, which the scholar identifies only by comparing the narration in question with other versions of the same tradition. He exposes comparative flaws by 61 The Sunan contains many problematic narrations to which the author himself draws attention, so he might have been aware that some of his material did not meet the standards of the Sahihayn. For an example of an admittedly weak narration, see SD, ii. 99. 62 KIT, 266; see n. 72 below for the details on this case of normative matn addition. 63 In his introduction to al-'Ilal al-warida ft al-ahadith al-nabawiyya, Mahfuz al-Rahman al-Salafl devotes a section to 'manhaj al-Daraqutnl', but it consists only of a non-analytical collection of the various manners in which the scholar reacted to problematic ahaditb; see al-Daraqutnl, al-'Ilal al-warida ft al-ahadlth al-nabawiyya, ed.

BROWN contrasting numerous existing narrations and then selecting those of greater quality or quantity.64 Objective Criticisms: 1. Defective Isnad. A significant number of the narrations criticized in the Kitab al-tatabbu' suffer from broken (munqati') chains of transmis sion. Often, the isnads lack the human link necessary for two people who could never have met each other to have transmitted a haditb orally. Since this is one of the criteria of a sound haditb, this flaw undermines the reliability of the narration. In haditb number 80, in which the Prophet states that the Day of Judgement will not occur until the Byzantines are the largest nation on Earth, al-Daraqutnl asserts that 'Abd al-Karlm b. Harith never met the Companion al-Mustawrid b. Shaddad.65 He uses the work of al-Bukharl's foremost teacher, cAll b. al-Madlnl (d. 234/849), to show that where the former assumed two transmitters had communicated a narration by word of mouth, the latter believed that they had in fact depended on an intermediary.66 2. Defective transmitter. Occasionally, al-Daraqutnl also criticizes chains of transmission if he considers one of their constituents weak or religiously deviant. In one instance of confusion over the correct version of the isnad, al-Daraqutnl dismisses the isnad cited by the prominent haditb transmitter Qatada because he frequently omitted his teachers' names from isnads.h7 Regarding another narration (number 192), al-Daraqutnl refers to various scholars' opinions that one of the transmitters was simply unreliable.68 He rejects one 'Imran b. Hittan because as an adult he supported the Kharijites and even praised 'All's murderer in a poem.69 64 The editor of Kitdb al-ilzdmdt wa-l-tatabbu', Muqbil b. Hadl, provides a typology of the ahadith criticized in his introduction to the book. This typology, however, focuses on how al-Daraqutnl's criticisms were later rebutted and not on the characteristics of the flaws that he identified. Another excellent summary of the flaws that occur in Prophetic ahadith can be found in Mahfuz al-Rahman al-Salafi's introduction to al-Daraqutnl's Kitdb al-'ilal. This typology, however, deals only with the superficial characteristics of the flaws and does not attempt to tie them together conceptually or identify the overarching problems on which al-Daraqutnl's Hadith criticism focuses. KIT, 281. Muslim includes another narration of this hadith. 6b Ibid. 413. Al-Daraqutnl shows that Ibn Burayda did not hear the hadith directly from Abu al-Aswad, but rather through Yahya b. Ya'mar. 67 Ibid. 338. 68 Ibid. 465. 69 Shams al-Dln al-Dhahabl, Mizan al-i'tidal, ed. 'All Muhammadal-Bajawl, 4 vols. ([Beirut]: Dar Ihya' al-Kutub al-lArabiyya, n.d.; repr. Cairo: 'Isa al-Babl al-Halabl, 1963-4), iii. 235.</page><page sequence="23">AL-DARAQUTNI'S adjustment of the sahihayn 23 Comparative Flaws: 1. Addition in Isnad. Problematic isnad additions make up the bulk of the flaws that al-Daraqutn! identifies in the Kitab al-tatabbu'. The scholar does not deem the addition of a transmitter appropriate if he is not verifiably reliable (thiqa) or if several esteemed authorities transmit narrations without the addition. Such isnad addition often occurs when a narration links someone who never met the Prophet to him through a Companion. In a baditb (number 107 from Muslim's Sablb) that Ibn 'Abbas supposedly narrated about the Prophet's supplications in times of worry, al-DaraqutnT presents an expert whose isnad for the tradition does not extend back to that Companion. Rather, the narration comes from Abu al-'Aliya, a tabi'i who never encountered the Prophet. By revealing the inappropriate addition of a Companion in the isnad, al-Daraqutnl shows that Muslim's narration is incomplete because it lacks the last link in the chain (i.e. that it is mursal)7Â° When the preponderance of scholars supports an isnad addition, however, al-Daraqutnl accepts it. In baditb number 100, he defends Muslim's selection of a musnad narration against others promoting an isnad lacking a Companion (riwaya mursala). He asserts that the one featuring the isnad addition is more favourable, for it enjoys the support of five trustworthy transmitters.71 When Muslim and al-Bukharl include a narration (number 92) from an authority named 'Amr b. 'All that adds Abd al-Rahman b. Jabir to the isnad, al-Daraqutnl supports them due to 'Amr's outstanding reliability.72 2. Normative Matn addition. For some traditions, the majority of its narrations ascribe its wording to a Companion. When one of its narrations cites the Prophet himself as the source of the baditb, al-Daraqutnl alerts the reader to ziyada. In this case, the species of addition is the normative increase of the matn's legal and ritual bearing (see Fig. 1.2). Hadltb number 78 presents an excellent example, where al-Daraqutnl indicates that an isnad comparable to the chain of transmission cited by Muslim mentions neither the Companion, Suhayb, nor the Prophet as the original sources for the tradition.73 Regarding one of Muslim's baditb (number 133) in which the narration quotes the Prophet's statements about the virtues of praying the dawn 70 KIT, 447. 71 Ibid. 304. 72 Ibid. 287-8. Ibid. 266-7. Muslim provides two isnad branches converging on the following common section: [Hammad b. Salama - Thabit al-Bunanl - Ibn Abl Layla - Suhayb - Prophet]. Al-Daraqutnl asserts that this is a case of normative matn addition, because other narrations cite neither the Prophet nor Suhayb as the source: [Hammad - Thabit - Ibn Abl Layla].</page><page sequence="24">24 JONATHAN A. C. BROWN prayer in a group, al-Daraqutnl adduces a myriad of narrations that trace the tradition to the caliph 'Uthman b. 'Affan.74 In another instance (hadlth number 102), al-Daraqutnl criticizes Muslim's marfii' (ascribed to the Prophet) narration because 'the correct [version]... is the maivqiif one (ascribed to a Companion) because those who attribute it to the Prophet (rafa'uhu) are scholars who cannot compete with Mansur and Shu'ba (supporters of the maivqiif narration)'.75 3. Literal Matn addition. Al-Daraqutnl also finds fault with the inappropriate addition of material in the text of the hadlth. Like the examples in the two previous sections, the acceptability of literal matn addition depends entirely on the relationship between the different narrations of the tradition; ultimately, al-Daraqutnl promotes the narration favoured among the scholars whose opinions he respects. In hadith number 71, al-Daraqutnl thus rejects the narration of 'Abd al-Rahman b. 'Abdallah because no other Hadith scholars vouched for his addition of a lengthy phrase about a Muslim fighter's rewards in heaven.76 In the aforementioned hadlth (number 69) of the mutala'inan, al-Daraqutnl states that the eminent traditionist Sufyan b. 'Uyayna erred in transmitting the additional phrase 'he [the Prophet] separated them'.77 4. Idraj/insertion. Al-Daraqutnl also criticizes the Shaykhayn for allowing the phenomenon of idraj to go unnoticed in several narrations. In hadlth number 199, both al-Bukharl and Muslim include several narrations of a tradition in which the Prophet forbids his followers to sell date palms until they are in blossom (hattd tuzhiya...). All the versions (except one from al-Bukharl) that they detail feature an explanatory comment telling those listening that God has forbidden any exchange in which someone wrongfully deprives another Muslim of his property. While the context of al-Bukharl's and Muslim's narrations suggest that the Prophet himself offered this explanation, al-Daraqutnl presents several prominent traditionists who trace this statement to Anas b. Malik, the Companion who narrated the tradition.78 5. Differences in Isnads. Comparing and contrasting different chains of transmissions provides the basis for identifying comparative flaws. Yet al-Daraqutnl often favours a narration to those listed in the Sahihayn 74 Ibid. 360. 75 Ibid. 308. 76 Ibid. 254. Here al-Daraqutnl rejects this narration because it is mufrad, or unique, and thus an unreliable addition. 7 Ibid. 252. N Ibid. 477. Among the authorities that al-Daraqutnl cites are Isma'll b. Ja'far (d. 180/796), Ibn al-Mubarak (d. 181/797), and Yazld b. Harun (d. 206/ 821). Al-Hakim al-Naysaburl considers this a case of matn addition; see al-Hakim, 167.</page><page sequence="25">AL-DARAQUJNI'S ADJUSTMENT OF THE SAH1HAYN Z5 The Prophet Fig 3.0. Al-Daraqutni's alternative isnads Muslim Al-Daraqutnl Fig 3.0. Al-Daraqutni's alternative isnads simply due to superior narrators or a clearer indication that they met and heard from each other. Sometimes al-Daraqutnl also finds mistakes in al-Bukharl or Muslim's isnads. Such errors may result from conflating two transmitters or confusing their names.79 The Sbaykhayn might also have misrepresented an isnad. Like other types of comparative flaws, the quality and quantity of traditionists preferring different isnads sways al-Daraqutnl's opinion. In an instance very typical of isnad difference (number 151), the Companion Ibn 'Umar teaches a new generation of Muslims that the Prophet sometimes combined his evening and night prayers. Al-Daraqutnl states that various master muhaddithun disagreed with the course of Muslim's narration. Figure 3.0 above demonstrates how the scholar advances a better chain of transmission preferred by three leading Hadith scholars of the second century: Shu'ba b. Hajjaj (d. 160/776), Sufyan al-Thawrl (d. 161/778),80 and Isra'll b. Yunus (d. 160-2/776-8).81 6. Inversion of Matn and Isnad. A common error among the muhaddithun was incorrectly attaching a matn and isnad. In light of the enormous quantity of Hadith material in circulation by the 79 For an example, see no. 135 in Kitdb al-tatabbu'; KIT, 365. so H. P. Raddatz, 'Sufyan al-Thawrl', EI2.

BROWN third/ninth century, fixing a tradition to the correct chain of transmission took great expertise. It is thus a testament to al-Bukharl's and Muslim's mastery of their field that al-Daraqutnl discovers only two instances of maqlub (inverted or switched) ahadith. In hadith number 166, this inversion plays a large role in the overall problem of this narration. Al-Bukharl and Muslim collectively present three chains of transmission from the Prophet ending with two distinctly different matns, one from 'All and the other from Abu Dharr al-GhifarL Al-Daraqutnl states that one of the three narrations must be inverted because al-Bukharl and Muslim each ascribe the same matn to both 'All and Abu Dharr.82 7. Matn difference. Hadith authorities also differed on the content of a tradition. Unlike literal matn addition, a phenomenon endemic to a science in which transmitters sometimes repeated only the essential part of an account and sometimes recounted it in its entirety, matn difference (al-ikhtildf fi al-matn) resulted from a fundamental disagreement on the wording of a tradition. In hadith number 128, al-Bukharl includes two narrations in which the caliph 'Uthman praises the virtues of al-Zubayr b. al-'Awwam. In the first, the caliph states 'Indeed you know that he is the best among you,' and in the second he says 'By Him who holds my soul in His hand, from what 1 know [al-Zubayr] is the best among them, and indeed he was the most beloved of God's Prophet... '83 Al-Daraqutnl shows no preference for either narration, perhaps because they share much of the same isnad and authorities were divided on the matter. He merely states that, where the isnad splits, the two narrators disagree on the wording (lafz) of the hadith. This lack of unanimity constitutes a flaw in his opinion.84 Here we must note that at no point in the Kitdb al-tatabbu' does al-Daraqutnl object to the theological, legal, or ritual content of any hadith. His criticisms do sometimes involve the texts of the reports, but only to the extent that they contain elements differing from other narrations. 82 Ibid. 418. 83 Ibid. 353. 84 The first version: innakum lata'lamiin annahu kbayrukutn'. The second version:... innahu lakhayruhum ma 'alimtn .... These two narrations also differ in the amount of contextual explanation they provide. 'All b. Mushir's narration (second) explains the setting of the caliph's statement: his illness in the Year of the Nosebleed (sanat al-ru'af, 24 ah) and the community urging him to name a successor. Hammad b. Usama's (al-Daraqutnl refers to him as Abu Usama) narration only includes the caliph's words. The reason that al-Daraqutn! did not consider this an instance of literal matn addition is that the contextual explanation was not the caliph's own speech. Rather, it was the work of one of the witnesses to the event, Marwan b. al-Hakam. The 'hadJth' itself, in the sense of reported speech, is the caliph's statement about al-Zubayr.</page><page sequence="27">AL-DARAQUJNI'S ADJUSTMENT OF THE SAHIHAYN 2.J III. Methodological Context The Development of Ziyadat al-Thiqa: al-Daraqutni's Context8' Detailing the flaws that al-Daraqutnl identified in the Sahthayn informs us how he critiqued the two works, but it does not explain his motivations. Isolating any methodological differences between al-Daraqutnl and the Shaykhayn might explain the driving force behind his critique. The study of the Prophetic tradition did not stop after the Six Books were written. As such, ample space existed in which serious methodological differences could arise between their authors and al-Daraqutnl. The above typology demonstrates the dominant role of problematic addition (ziyada) in al-Daraqutnl's adjustment of the Sahibayn. The majority of the narrations for which the scholar faults Muslim and many of al-Bukharfs inclusions suffer from inappropriate additions in either the isnad or the matn, examples of which appear in the previous section. In their rebuttals of al-Daraqutnl's criticisms, both al-Nawawi and Ibn Hajar al-'Asqalanl (d. 852/1449) thus devote significant effort to addressing the controversy surrounding ziyadat al-thiqa, the addition made by a reliable transmitter. Beginning in the third/ninth century, Muslim Hadith scholars gradually developed their understanding of addition, evolving from a broad vision of ziyada to treat the more nuanced questions of law and transmission that it raised. Their initially uniform notion of the subject flowed directly from their focus on the isnad as the main guarantor of authenticity; if a trustworthy transmitter makes an addition, whether in the isnad or matn, his status alone should guarantee its veracity. While traditionists dealt with both isnad and matn addition in their daily studies, a theoretical distinction between the two appears not to have arisen until the time of al-Khatlb al-Baghdadl in the fifth/eleventh century. Before him, scholars like Ibn Hanbal, Ibn Khuzayma (d. 311/ 924), and Ibn Hibban (d. 354/965) had commented on the issue but had made no technical study. Ahmad b. Hanbal appears to have accepted matn addition if the person providing it was reliable and the great Iraqi expert could locate a corroborating report.Sh Ibn Hibban approved of 85 The study of ziyada is regrettably underdeveloped in both Muslim and Western scholarship. The only two Arabic works devoted to the subject are Khaldun al-Ahdab's 'llm al-zawa'id (Damascus: Dar al-Qalam, 1992) and 'Abd al-Salam Muhammad 'Allush's 'llm zawa'id al-hadith (Beirut: Dar Ibn Hazm, 1415/1995). 1 have found no significant study of it in any European language. 86 Zayn al-Dln Ibn Rajab, Sharh 'Hal al-Tirmidhi, ed. Subhl Jasim al-Badrl (Baghdad: Matba'at al-'Anl, [1396/1976]), 306-7. Ibn Hanbal would not even accept a ziyada narration from Malik b. Anas until he had found a report that seconded the addition.</page><page sequence="28">2.8 JONATHAN A. C. BROWN isnad addition as long as the added transmitter possessed the legal acumen to understand the material he was passing on.87 Similarly, al-Tirmidhl (d. 279/892) accepted isnad addition if he could rely on the transmitter's memory.88 Muslim left no extant opinion, and al-Bukharl's terse acceptance of isnad addition lacks the context necessary to clarify his stance. One can only glean their positions from the work of later scholars such as al-NawawI and Ibn Hajar. By the fifth/eleventh century, some Muslim jurists and Hadith scholars had distinguished between the two types of matn addition and isnad addition, upholding a variety of positions on their acceptability. Al-Daraqutnl's own student, al-Hakim al-Naysaburl, accepted both literal and normative matn addition without reservation.84 This question received its most extensive treatment in al-Baghdadl's comprehensive al-Kifaya fi 'ilm al-riwaya, where the author summarizes the varying positions held by scholars until his time and defends his own stance on the topic.90 He tackles the question of isnad addition in the form of the argument over the priority of a musnad report, one that can be traced back to the Prophet through an uninterrupted isnad, and a mursal report, one that is ascribed to the Prophet but lacks a Companion to complete the chain of transmission. When presented with several narrations of a tradition, some mursal and some musnad, al-Baghdadi states that most Hadith scholars (ashdb al-baditb) and jurists deem the tradition mursal and thus question its reliability. He further states that another party judges by the number and quality of the differing narrations. If the number of musnad chains is greater than their mursal counterparts and their transmitters more reliable (ahfaz), then scholars should accept it as musnad (and thus as potentially sound). Al-Baghdadl concludes by describing a third group that accepts any musnad report provided that the narrator satisfies all the requirements of reliability, regardless of the number or provenance of competing mursal chains. Al-Baghdadl himself adheres to this last position, and he adduces a 87 'Abd al-Salam Sha'ban 'All, Ikhtilafat al-muhaddithin wa-l-fuqaba' ft al-bukm 'aid al-hadith (Cairo: Dar al-Hadlth, 1417/1997), 304. Henceforth IKH. 88 IKH, 302.' 89 Al-Hakim states that 'an addition [of a phrase in the matn] by a reliable transmitter is acceptable'. When one narration is mawqiif and the others marfu', he considers the tradition to be marfu'; see al-Hakim, 27, 50. 90 Al-Baghdadl's work was a milestone in the Islamic elaboration of 'ilm al-hadith. The traditionist Abu Bakr b. Nuqta (d. 629/1231) elegized al-Baghdadi by saying 'all who have written [about the science of Hadith] after al-Khatlb [al-Baghdadi] are dependent on his books ('iyal 'aid kutubihi)'; see Ibn al-Salah, Muqaddima, 12. Ibn al-Salah informs us that al-Baghdadi devoted an entire book (now lost) to the subject of ziydda in the isndd, entitled Kitdb tamylz al-mazid fl muttasil al-asanid; see Ibn al-Salah, Muqaddima, 480.</page><page sequence="29">AL-DARAQUJNI'S adjustment of the sahihayn 29 report from al-Bukharl to support it. Apparently, when that towering scholar was asked about a musnad version of a report transmitted by Isra'll b. Yunus, he stated 'an addition by a trustworthy transmitter (al ziyada min al-thiqa) is acceptable, and Isra'll b. Yunus is trustworthy. Even if Shu'ba [b. al-Hajjaj] and [Sufyan] al-Thawrl consider it mursal, that does not affect the report.'91 Al-Baghdadl also addresses the issues of literal and normative matn addition, although he identifies them in a different manner. For this scholar, the roots of normative matn addition lie in Companions on one occasion quoting the Prophet and on another uttering religious judgement directly inspired by his words. A report in which a Companion repeats a ruling without citing the Prophet thus does not contradict another narration ascribing that statement to the Prophet.92 Al-Baghdadl does, however, acknowledge that the majority of tradi tionists (muhaddithun) feel more comfortable accepting the mawqiif (Companion's) version and rejecting the Prophetic narration as an illegitimate attempt to bolster the reliability of the report.9' The acceptability of literal matn addition follows in the next chapter of the Kifaya. There al-Baghdadl poses the question: do we accept a report with additional material if only one reliable transmitter narrates it? He feels that the majority of traditionists and legal scholars (jamhur al-fuqaha' wa-asbab al-baditb) accept such a narration.94 He goes on to 91 Al-Khatlb al-Baghdadl, Kitdb al-kifaya fl 'ilm al-riwdya, ed. Ahmad 'Umar Hashim (Beirut: Dar al-Kitab al-'Arabl, 1405/1985), 450-1. He describes the requirements of the third group as Hdha kdna thdbit al-'adala dabitan li-I riwdya', or 'if he [the transmitter of the mursal report] is sound of character and accurate in his report'. 92 Ibid. 456. This material appears under the title 'bab ft al-hadlth yarfa'uhu al-rawl taratan iva-yaqifuhu ukhrd, ma hukmuhu?'; translated, 'Chapter on the ruling of reports that are sometimes attributed to the Prophet and sometimes to Companions: How it should be judged'. 93 Al-Baghdadl, al-Kifdya, 449; cf. al-Nawawi, i. 37. 94 Muslim scholars have found the different opinions cited by al-Baghdadl to be at loggerheads. The great ninth/fifteenth-century traditionist Shams al-Dln al-SakhawT (d. 902/1497) struggled with what he considered opposing statements: al-Baghdadl's claim that the majority of traditionists reject ziyada but that the body (jamhur) of both legal scholars and traditionists accept it. Al-SakhawI reconciles the two statements by explaining that 'jamhur' does not apply to legal scholars and traditionists equally. It is thus very possible for the majority of both groups taken together to accept ziyadat al-thiqa. If the traditionists were considered separately, however, they would generally reject it; see IKH, 305. I believe that my distinction between normative and literal matn addition better explains al-Baghdadl's statement. His first statement deals with normative matn addition, while his second addresses the separate issue of literal matn addition.</page><page sequence="30">3Â° JONATHAN A. C. BROWN describe a school of thought that only accepts such a report if it actually has bearing on a legal ruling. Interestingly, he describes a group identifying themselves with the Shafi'I doctrine (firqa mimman yantabilu madhhab al-Shafi'l) that accepts this sort of addition only if the narration with ziyada is transmitted by someone other than the person who carried the original report. Presumably this group faulted someone who narrated both versions for his oversight. A last group of traditionists rejects any matn addition that does not enjoy the support of at least several skilled narrators (huffaz). Like his stance on isnad addition, al-Baghdadl accepts all forms of matn addition by a reliable transmitter. All arguments against this categorical acceptance, he asserts, rely on notions of probability that fail to account for all the circumstances in which an honest, consistent narrator might transmit a report with additional phrases.95 Although other leading traditionists such as Ibn al-Salah and Ibn Rajab (d. 795/1392) continued the study of addition in the centuries following al-Baghdadl, the orthodox ruling on its acceptability took its definitive form in the work of al-NawawI and Ibn Hajar al-cAsqalanI. These two scholars present not only the culmination of the study of ziyada; they also made the most concerted attempts to recreate Muslim's and al-Bukharl's stances on the subject. Unfortunately, the writings of the Shaykhayn did not fully explain their methodologies to later generations. Indeed, al-Bukharl's Sahih does not set out his approach at all. In the introduction to his Sahlh, Muslim does describe his project as well as his criteria for trustworthy narrations, but he never addresses the minute technical issues that would become matters of contention for later scholars seeking to reconstruct the criteria of the Shaykhayn,96 Al-NawawI echoes al-Baghdadi's unquestioning acceptance of an addition made by a reliable transmitter (ziyadat al-thiqa). 'Additions [in the text or isnad] made by reliable transmitters are categorically acceptable according to the body of traditionists as well as legal scholars and theorists (ahl al-hadith wa-l-fiqh wa-l-usul)', he states, relying on al-Baghdadi's testimony as proof. Al-NawawI grants similar acceptance to normative matn addition, regardless of the number and quality of opposing narrations.9 He defends this position in his introduction to his sharh of Muslim's Sahlh, and his broad acceptance is certainly hostage to Muslim's extensive use of narrations containing additions. 95 Al-Baghdadl, al-Kifaya, 464-9. Al-Ghazzall echoes this probability-based acceptance in his al-Mustasfd fi 'ilm al-nsul, ed. Muhammad 'Abd al-Salam 'Abd al-Shafl (Beirut: Dar al-Kutub al-'Ilmiyya, 1413/1993), 133. 96 See G. H. A Juynboll's 'Muslim's Introduction to his Sahih', 263-311. 97 Al-Nawawl, i. 37.</page><page sequence="31">AL-DARAQUJNI'S ADJUSTMENT OF THE SAHlHAYN 31 Almost 200 years later, Ibn Hajar displays considerably more nuance on the subject of addition. Unconcerned by al-Baghdadl's dominant opinions or the rulings of later scholars, he plumbs the work of al-Bukharl, Muslim, Abu Zur'a (d. 264/877), and Abu Hatim al-RazI (d. 277/890) for their views on addition. He determines that they did not operate according to any rigid guidelines for the acceptability of addition but rather judged each instance according to its specific circumstances (qara'in).98 'It cannot be demonstrated that any of them categorically accepted addition,' he concludes." This echoes the position of the Hanball traditionist Ibn Rajab, who died some 60 years before Ibn Hajar. He contends that the story in which al-Bukhari approves of ziyadat al-tbiqa represents a specific ruling only and does not apply universally.100 While al-NawawI defends Muslim's inclusion of addition narrations by accepting ziyadat al-tbiqa categorically, Ibn Hajar's emphasis on the subtleties of circumstance allows al-Bukharl's and Muslim's expertise to defend itself. He states that al-Bukharl and, after him, Muslim were the greatest Hadith scholars in Islamic history. This not only justifies their acceptance of addition in certain circumstances de facto, it also precludes any general ruling on the subject that does not take circumstances (qara'in) into consideration.'01 al-Daraqutnl's Stance on Ziyadat al-Thiqa Unfortunately, the lack of any methodological introduction in al-Daraqutnl's works deprives us of comprehensive, first-hand informa tion about his stance on ziyadat al-thiqa. The author does, however, refer to it once in his Kitdb al-tatabbu' and a few times in his Kitdb al-'ilal. The work of scholars like al-Baghdadl, Ibn Rajab, and Ibn Hajar also provides external indications. Combined with the typology of the flaws he documented in the Sahtbayn as well as his 'llal, we can reconstruct al-Daraqutnl's beliefs on the issue. These data suggest that the scholar adhered to a middle position that accepted addition when supported by a preponderance of evidence, but preferred not to give narrators the benefit of the doubt. As a rule, al-Daraqutnl appears to have been very stringent about preserving the text of traditions. Contrary to his own opinion and that of the majority of fifth/eleventh-century traditionists, al-Baghdadl cites al-Daraqutnl teaching his students the words of an 98 Other narrations criticized in the Kitab al-tatabbu' that Ibn Hajar says involved circumstances in which ziydda was acceptable include nos. 108, 110, 114, 177, and 186. 99 IKH, 309. 100 Ibn Rajab, 312. 101 KIT, 53.</page><page sequence="32">32 JONATHAN A. C. BROWN early muhaddith who disliked abbreviating the matn in any circum stances because it 'corrupted the meaning'.102 Surviving Hadith texts explicitly state that al-Daraqutnl neither categorically accepted nor denied ziyadat al-tbiqa, and eminent traditionists who knew his work unanimously respected his under standing of addition. Ibn Rajab states that al-Daraqutnl was correct in accepting addition in certain circumstances and rejecting it in others.10' When Ibn Hajar turned to the early pillars of Hadith criticism and deduced that none followed any set policy on addition, he included al-Daraqutnl in their ranks.104 There is more that can shed light on al-Daraqutnl's attitude towards the different aspects of ziyada. Statements attributed to him strongly suggest that he distinguished between matn and isnad addition. He once praised one Abu Bakr b. Ziyad by exclaiming, 'he had mastered the addition of phrases in the texts of ahadltb (kana ya'rifu ziyadat al-alfaz ft al-nmtun).,10S Yet al-Daraqutnl's Kitab al-tatabbu' makes only one reference to addition in any form. This occurs in hadith number 209, which the scholar criticizes for both a defective isnad and isnad addition. Oddly, it is the author's explanation of the defective isnad that leads him to mention ziyada. Al-Daraqutnl challenges Muslim's principal narration by presenting another in which the transmitter Qatada receives the report from someone named 'Amr b. Murra instead of Salim. Concerning this addition, he adds, 'although he [Qatada] is trustworthy (thiqa), and we accept addition by a trustworthy transmitter, he sometimes pretends he heard a report from someone when in fact he received it through an intermediary (yudallis)' (my emphasis).106 Other segments of Kitab al-tatabbu' also allude to this acceptance of isnad addition under certain conditions. In hadith number 100, al-Daraqutnl authenticates Muslim's choice of a tnusnad narration in the face of opposing mursal reports because five trustworthy transmitters support it. Only the renowned traditionist Sufyan al-Thawrl proposes the mursal version.10 It therefore seems clear that al-Daraqutnl accepts isnad addition when the evidence for it outweighs opposing arguments. 102 Al-Baghdadl, al-Kifdya, 225. This opinion was attributed to Abu 'Asim al-Nabll (d. 212/827). Al-Baghdadl states that 'many people allow a transmitter to [abbreviate a narration's text] in any condition and make no specifications'. The author personally accepts abbreviating the matn as long as it does not affect the ruling or the gist (murad) of the tradition; see ibid. 224. 103 Ibn Rajab, 312. 104 IKH, 309. 105 Ibn Rajab, 314. 106 KIT, 492. 107 Ibid. 304.</page><page sequence="33">AL-DARAQUTNI'S ADJUSTMENT OF THE SAHlHAYN 33 We should probably understand al-Daraqutnl's acceptance of ziyadat al-thiqa in its broadest sense, for it seems likely that the same principle applied to normative matn addition. In hadith number 102 (mentioned above), al-Daraqutnl favours the mawqiif narrations over the marfu' because 'those who attribute it to the Prophet (rafa'iihu) are scholars who cannot compete with Mansur and Shu'ba' (supporters of the mawqiif narration).108 Extrapolating from the scholar's explanation, he probably would have championed the marfu' narration had it enjoyed more support. The most useful external clues to al-Daraqutnl's stance on addition come from al-Baghdadl's lengthy description of the various schools of thought on the subject. The two Baghdad scholars died only 76 years apart, and al-Khatlb al-Baghdadl was quite familiar with his predeces sor's work.109 From the indications illustrated above (and number 71 in the typology section on Literal Matn Addition), al-Daraqutnl seems to fit into the group of traditionists whom al-Baghdadl describes rejecting any lone literal matn addition (mufrad) that lacks the support of several experts (huffazJ.110 Of particular interest is al-Baghdadl's reference to a group of Shafi'Is who would not accept any 'addition from a reliable transmitter' if he also narrated the version without the addition. In his Sunan, al-Daraqutnl rejects literal matn addition when the same transmitter communicates an addition and non-addition version.111 Moreover, many of the narrations that al-Daraqutnl discredits in his Kitab al-tatabbu' are cases of isnad addition in which the transmitter making the addition clearly heard from both the original narrator and the newly added person in the isnad. Such instances demonstrate that al-Daraqutnl did not accept additions in the isnad or the matn from 108 Ibid. 308. See the section on Normative Matn Addition above for the discussion of this narration. 109 Al-Baghdadl claimed an extended ijdza relationship with al-Daraqutnl based on the ijdza of one of his teachers; see Ibn al-Salah, Muqaddima, 343. 110 Al-Baghdadl, al-Kifdya, 465. 111 SD, ii. 83-4. I conclude that al-Daraqutnl rejected this instance of ziyada because the same person transmitted both the ziyada and non-ziyada version, not because he was not thiqa. This transmitter is none other than the problematic Muhammad b. Ishaq (d. 150/767), compiler of the Stra. He was generally considered reliable by critics like Ahmad b. Hanbal and al-'Ijll, but Ibn Hajar states definitively that he did not meet al-Bukhari's standards (see KIT, 484). Although al-Daraqutnl seems to have shared al-Bukhari's standards on many occasions, in the one instance that Ibn Ishaq is mentioned in the Kitdb al-tatabbu', al-Daraqutnl does not explicitly identify him as weak. Nor does al-Daraqutnl share Malik b. Anas's damning opinion of Ibn Ishaq, for he does not include him in his Kitdb al-du'afa' wa-l-matrukln.</page><page sequence="34">34 JONATHAN A. C. BROWN people who also transmitted an original version. As a Shafi'I, he may thus have belonged to the group mentioned by al-Baghdadl.112 Higher Statidards in Men While many of the comparative flaws in the Sabibayn resulted from trenchant differences between al-Daraqutnl's stance on ziyadat al-tbiqa and that of the Sbaykbayn, his criticism of weak transmitters stems from far less dramatic disagreements. The scholar seems to have been only marginally more stringent than other major rijal critics, for the standards he uses to evaluate transmitters do not seem to differ drastically from those of his fellow scholars. Oddly, al-Dhahabl considers al-Daraqutnl one of the more lenient Hadith critics.113 But in a sample of 75 men selected randomly from al-Daraqutnl's Kitab al-du'afa' wa-l-matrukin, the author rejects 9.3 per cent of the transmitters approved by other major Hadith scholars of the third/ninth and fourth/tenth centuries, including the Sbaykbayn, as well as al-Dhahabl and Ibn Hajar.114 In the context of the Sabibayn, at least, Al-Daraqutnl proves only slightly more demanding than the Sbaykbayn, and as a result he identifies no more than three defective transmitters in their two books. 112 Faulting such narrations continually baffles both Ibn Hajar and al Nawawl, who constantly remind the reader that the narrations suffer from no flaw because the transmitter also conveyed the non-addition report; see KIT, 439. 113 Scott Cameron Lucas, 'The Arts of Hadlth Compilation and Criticism: the Study of the Emergence of Sunnism in the Third/Ninth Century', Ph.D. diss., 2 vols. (University of Chicago, 2002), i. 58. Cf. al-Dhahabl, al-Miiqiza fi 'ilm mustalah al-hadith, ed. 'Abd al-Fattah Abu Ghudda (Aleppo: Maktab al-Matbu'at al-Islamlya bi-Halab, 1405/[ 1984â1985]), 83. I disagree with al-Dhahabl's description, for there is ample evidence that al-Daraqutnl's contemporaries and immediate successors esteemed his standards in rijal. For example, the muhaddith al-Khalll b. 'Abdallah al-Khalili (d. 446/1055) can only express his astonishment when he finds that al-Daraqutnl narrated certain ahadith solely on the authority of the decidedly weak al-Hasan b. 'All al-'Adawi; see Khalll b. 'Abdallah al-Khallll, al-Irshad fl ma'rifat 'ulama' al-hadith, ed. 'Amir Ahmad Haydar (Makka: Dar al-Fikr, 1414/1993), 158. 114 The other rijal critics include Ibn Hibban, al-'Ijll, Abu Hatim, and Abu Zur'a al-RazI, Ahmad b. Hanbal, al-Nasa'I, and al-Bukharl. For example, in the case of Muhammad b. al-Hasan b. Atish, whom al-Daraqutnl considers weak, Abu Hatim and Abu Zur'a al-RazI consider him thiqa and Ibn Hajar calls him sadiiq; see Ibn Hajar, Taqrib al-tahdhlb, ed. 'Adil Murshid (Beirut: Mu'assasat al-Risala, 1416/1996), 409; and al-Daraqutnl, Kitdb al-du'afa' iva-l-matrukin, ed. Subhl al-Badrl al-Samarra'I (Beirut: Mu'assasat al-Risala, 1404/1984), 153. See also Kitdb al-du'afa' wa-l-matriikin for narrators rejected by al-Daraqutnl: entries no. 251 (Abu Hatim: la ba's" bihi, Ibn H'bban: tbiqa), 311 (Ahmad: salih al-hadith), 312 (Ibn Ma'In: thiqa), 322 (Ibn Hajar: sadiiq khalata ba'd ihtirdq kutubihi), 475 (al-Dhahabl, Abu Hatim, Abu Zur'a: thiqa), 610 (Abu Hatim: sadiiq), and 516 (Abu Hatim, Abu Zur'a: thiqa).</page><page sequence="35">AL-DARAQUTNI'S ADJUSTMENT OF THE SAHIHAYN 35 The Baghdad scholar seems to have had slightly higher standards than Muslim, for later apologists such as al-NawawI were unable to refute al-Daraqutnl's attack on one 'Abdallah b. Khuthaym, on whom Muslim depends in one narration.115 Al-Daraqutnl accuses Ibn Khuthaym of being weak (da'if),116 but one can find no hint of this serious accusation in al-Dhahabl's staunchly canonical compilation of expert opinions on this transmitter.117 In al-MizzI's (d. 742/1341) Tahdhlb al-kamdl, al-Nasa'I (d. 303/915), Ibn Hibban, Abu Hatim al-RazI, and Abu al-Hasan Ahmad al-cIjll (d. 261/875) also vouch for Ibn Khuthaym's strength and probity.118 Amid this tremendous praise, however, Ibn Hajar notes that Ibn al-Madlnl, al-Bukharfs most illustrious teacher, labelled Ibn Khuthaym 'munkar al-hadlth (that he alone contradicts more reliable experts)'.114 It thus seems likely that, even with so much support behind him, al-NawawI could not defend Muslim's decision in the face of Ibn al-Madlnl's venerable opposition. As a principle, muhaddithun generally considered one negative evaluation of a transmitter (jarh) weightier than multiple approvals (ta'dll).110 Al-Daraqutnl also demonstrates his unusually high standards when criticizing one of al-Bukhari's transmitters, 'Imran b. Hittan, whom he faults for deviant beliefs (sii' i'tiqadihi). Although Ibn Hajar admits that this Kharijite propagandist's heretical leanings undermine the narration and can only excuse al-Bukharl by reminding us that it is an auxiliary narration, other prominent traditionists argue that al-Bukharl only included this narration because 'Imran had transmitted it before joining the Kharijite camp.121 Nonetheless, in his Lisan al-mizan, Ibn Hajar 115 See hadith no. 4246 in Muslim's Bab al-Fada'il. 116 KIT,'465. 117 See al-Dhahabl, Mizdn al-i'tiddl, ii. 460. ,ls Yusuf b.

Hyderabad: Da'irat al-Ma'arif, 1326/(1908-9]), v. 537. Al-Nasa'I also demonstrated some reservations about Ibn Khuthaym, but his opinion was apparently based on that of Ibn al-Madlnl. 211 J. Robson, 'al-djarh wa al-ta'dll', EI2. KIT, 333. It is extremely interesting to note, however, that even after specifically calling them either weak or deviant, al-Daraqutnl includes neither 'Abdallah b. Khuthaym nor "Imran b. Hittan in his Kitdb al-du'afa' wa-l matrukin. There are several possible explanations for this fact: (a) these two transmitters represent changes in the scholar's opinion between his writing of the KIT and Kitdb al-du'afa' wa-l-matriikln; (b) the author applied a more rigorous set of standards when reviewing the Sahthayn than in his own work; or (c) the author or copyist erred.</page><page sequence="36">36 JONATHAN A. C. BROWN attempts to exonerate cImran with a barrage of approving experts such as al-'Ijll, Qatada b. Di'ama (d. 118/736), and Abu Dawud (d. 275/ 888).122 Al-Daraqutnl therefore proves not only more demanding than a host of other critics, including al-Bukharl and Muslim, but is also unwilling to accept narrations that may have predated a transmitter's deviant beliefs. CONCLUSION Al-Daraqutnl cuts an interesting figure in the pantheon of Sunn! scholarship. As one of the most prominent Hadith masters of the classical period, his critique of the two most esteemed collections of Prophetic traditions provides irrefutable proof of the critical review process through which even these canonical texts have passed. His persona disorients the historian accustomed to the contours of modern Sunn! orthodoxy and its reverence for the Sahihayn: a champion of the Prophetic legacy, his Kitab al-tatabbu' seems to flout its canonization; a staunch theological literalist opposed to free reasoning, his criticism of the Sahihayn never touches on any matters of substance or content. We can resolve this conundrum, however, by realizing that al-Daraqutnl was, above all, a master of form. In a scholarly world that esteemed attention to rote detail, he was more meticulous than most. His approach to Hadith criticism centred solely on the processes and vagaries of transmission, to the exclusion of its ideological content. He concerned himself with transmitters and the chains they formed, limiting his interest in the matn to the part it played in the holistic course of transmission. His focus on comparing and evaluating individual narrations without addressing their content meant that al-Daraqutnl never overtly rejected any of the Prophetic traditions included in al-Bukharl's and Muslim's collections. As his ceuvre demonstrates, al-Daraqutnl was undeniably fascinated with the Sahihayn. He clearly deemed them seminal embodiments of the Prophet's Sunna, and his adjustment of them constituted an act of productive criticism. Al-Daraqutnl certainly never intended to alter the theological, ritual, or legal material of the Shaykhayn with his own opinions. Rather, we must understand al-Daraqutnl's objections to certain aspects of al-Bukharl's and Muslim's compilations through specific methodological develop ments within Him al-hadith between the third/ninth and ninth/fifteenth 122 Ibn Hajar, Lisan al-mtzan, 6 vols. (Hyderabad: Da'irat al-Ma'arif, 1331â 9/[1911â18]), iii. 333. Al-'Ijll: wathaqahu; Qatada: la yuttahamu ft al-badith; Abu Dawud: laysa min ahl al-ahwa'.</page><page sequence="37">AL-DARAQUTNI'S adjustment of the SAHIHAYN 37 centuries. Al-Daraqutnl simply proved more systematically stringent on issues such as addition (ziyada) than al-Bukhari, Muslim, and main stream SunnI scholarship as it coalesced after the fourth/tenth century. As the writings of al-Baghdadl, al-NawawI, and Ibn Hajar demonstrate, the centuries following al-Daraqutnl's death saw first a more lenient approach to addition and later an abandonment of the general rules of ziyadat al-tbiqa, embodied in works such as the Kitab al-tatabbn', in favour of a reliance on the expert judgement of al-Bukharl and Muslim. It was this later development in SunnI Hadith scholarship and al-Daraqutnl's lack of interest in questioning the actual substance of al-Bukharl or Muslim's ahaditb that allowed later scholars such as al-NawawI and Ibn Hajar to reconcile the tenth-century critic's work with the Hadith canon.</page></plain_text>
