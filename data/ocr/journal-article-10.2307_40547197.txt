<plain_text><page sequence="1">Masters of Cultural History II : Friedrich Meinecke and the Tragedy of German Liberalism BY HENRY PACHTER To understand things of value, you must gaze calmly into the abyss of history. (Johann Gottfried von Herder) That good may come from evil is not proof of Reason's cunning but of its impotence. (Friedrich Meinecke) Preface When the Free University of Berlin was founded in 1948, the natural choice for its Rector was, despite his 86 years, Friedrich Meinecke, professor emeritus of modern history and for forty years editor of the professional Journal Historische Zeitschrift.1 He was author of three monumental works: Cosmopolitanism and the National State, The Idea of Reason of State, and The Origin of Historismus - the latter term referring to the school of German historians whose undisputed leader he was.2 1 "Historical Journal," in the following quoted as HZ. 2 Weltbürgertum und Nationalstaat (1908), English translation with a preface by Felix Gilbert, Princeton University Press, 1970; references will be to Cosmopolitanism; translations are mine after Werke (Munich: Oldenbourg Verlag, 1959-1965), vol.

He had been a liberal almost all his long life among a faculty that was mostly reactionary and nationalistic; he had opposed the Kaiser's warlike policies and had helped in the founding of the Republic. Hitler had deprived him of both his academic position and his editorship. He had spent the Nazi period in "internal exile," had kept close contacts with the Resistance leaders, and had emerged after the war with a small but searing book, The German Catastrophe? which candidly discussed the fatal forces - not just the practical mistakes- that had driven Germany into the abyss. More recently, however, both Meinecke 's credentials as a liberal and the merits of Historismus have come under attack.4 Their ideas were found to diverge from the Western concepts of freedom and of liberalism. Iggers says oí Historismus: "The great theoretical questions that are man's legitimate scientific concerns remain unanswered." Although historians are not usually expected to answer philosophical questions, Meinecke and his friend Ernst Troeltsch had indeed tried to find metaphysical foundations for the German liberals' conscience. Today, however, we study their texts not for any truth they might have revealed; to us they are indicators of their Zeitgeist and barometers of the forces they represented. In this study I shall use the crisis of Historismus as a key to the understanding of the crisis of German liberalism. There is good reason to examine this "attitude to life" (as Meinecke called Historismus) because after twenty-five years of eclipse it is experiencing a revival in Germany. Since the term Historismus will occur frequently, I need to explain why I retain this ugly coining instead of following those who are using "historicism." Unfortunately, Benedetto Croce and Karl Popper have preempted the latter term for the Hegelian view, that history is a perennial progression toward a predetermined goal and each period is a 3 Die deutsche Katastrophe (1946); English translation by Sidney B.

Historismus is the diametrically opposed view: that "all periods are equally close to God" (Leopold von Ranke). Although both historicism and Historismus deny any eternal nature of man and are both hostile to biological views of history, they differ in two important respects : historicism sees all human history as one and as subject to universally valid laws of development, applicable to all nations alike; Historismus stresses the unique individuality of each historical formation and assumes that each nation, each period, each individual lives under its own star - "the law by which thou first wert formed" (Goethe). Historismus means that "everything is in constant flux and that the flux brings to the fore ever new formations" (Meinecke).5 Part I will give a general outline of Meinecke's attitudes to history and politics, from deluded optimism in the beginning of this century to the disillusionment in the two World Wars: "The Demon Ignored." Part II surveys Meinecke's life as a liberal, his fight against the forces that threatened his conception of the State: "The Demon Without." Partili is an analysis of Reason of State: "The Demon Within." Part IV is a critique of Historismus: "The Demon Triumphant." I. The Demon Ignored The prestigious Historische Zeitschrift began its 100th volume, in 1908, with a thoughtful essay by its editor, Friedrich Meinecke. In it he questioned the conventional claim, that scientific methods can lead the historian to an objective view of "what really happened" (Ranke's famous formula). He contended that history could be written only in the context of a concrete nation and state, hence had to be informed by a philosophy, or even by a temperament. Sixteen years later, in his introduction to a new edition of Ranke's Political Dialogue, he stated: "A subtle connection exists between the work of the statesman and the work of the historian"; while the latter must not allow partisanship to becloud his research, "the true nature of the events will disclose itself only to him who experiences them and empathizes with them .... No history of any value has been written that was not inspired by a will to act."6 Even the selection of one's topic is influenced by his interest or, at least, preferences; against Max Weber's well-known theorem of value- free scholarship Meinecke retorted: Each cultural achievement is "a 5 See Calvin Rand, "Two Meanings of Historicism," in JHI 25 (1964) and Iggers, I.e.

Its preface declared: "My book is based on the conviction that German historiography, without abandoning the valuable tradition of its methods, must rise to a freer vision and find contact with the great powers of political and cultural life; without prejudice to its own aims and purposes, it should engage more boldly in philosophy and politics." The book was one of the first in a new field - intellectual history {Geis tes geschickte), or, perhaps more precisely, it used the development of an idea, in this case "nationhood," as key to the understanding of a decisive turn in German history: the transformation of a Kulturnation into a Staatsnation. This development had been described by others as the victory of Prussia over the Great-German ambitions of the 1848 revolution, as the unification of Germany, as the triumph of Bismarck, etc. Meinecke went back to the time of the Napoleonic wars, which the Germans remember as their "War of Liberation" or "the German Uprising" (1812-1814), studied the ideas that had animated its leaders, and found that German patriotism had grown out of the fertile soil of the 18th century Enlightenment, its humanitarian, cosmopolitan spirit. This was in opposition to the school teaching that the German nation had rejected Western humanitarianism and embraced Bismarck's blood-and-iron philosophy instead. Like Humboldt and Fichte, Meinecke always differentiated between patriotism and nationalism; the latter he thought vulgar. His achievement, hailed by the reviewers as a work of art, was to show the emergence of the new Reich in a twofold mirror: The cunning of the statesman reflected the birth of a new Geist, and that Geist embodied the emergence of a new state. To a jubilant generation of German students before World War I, Meinecke gave the message that power could be ennobled and that German history offered to idealists a vision of transcendental values - the state as a thing of highest cultural virtue! No legitimate state without Geist. The message cut both ways. On the one hand it idealized the existing state and gave liberals an excuse to cooperate with it, as indeed they had 7 Kausalitäten und Werte in der Geschichte, originally in HZ (1923), now Werke IV, pp. 68 ff.; quoted from the collected essays, Schaffender Spiegel (Stuttgart, 1948), p. 66. Meinecke's coining, Creative Mirror, is itself an expression of his understanding of the historian's work and function. Likewise he says in the Aphorisms (1942, Werke IV, p. 239): "He who writes history must also create history."</page><page sequence="5">16 HENRY PACHTER been doing then for forty years; on the other hand, it suggested that the state must live up to the ideals that had been imputed to its origins. Was this just a pious hope? In the political articles Meinecke then wrote for the daily press - for he practiced the involvement he preached, and but for a speech defect might have run for a Reichstag seat - he attacked the state for which his book claimed such a splendid philosophy. Not only did the Emperor's foreign policy seem perilous and reckless, the very structure of government was at fault: elite positions were held by an aristocracy that no longer brought forth leaders but pursued petty agrarian interests ; in two thirds of the country the majority did not have equal voting rights; on the eastern estates the farmhands were living in semi-servitude, and in the rest of the country workers were considered "enemies of the state." Nevertheless, the book resounded with chords of harmony. Thanks to the above-quoted Geist, the commands of Christian ethics were living in beautiful symbiosis with the demands of power policy, just as the liberal middle class was prospering in harness with the semifeudal state.8 If Alexander Pope said, "Whatever is, is right," and Hegel said, "What is real, is rational," Historismus proclaimed that "What has been growing must go on growing," or, as Meinecke was to formulate it later: "Out of the realm ofthat which is and which will be, there constantly emerges the notion of what ought to be and must be"9 - a dangerous philosophy which, as we shall see, may lead to acceptance of all historical faits accomplis. How can criticism of the Wilhelminian state be reconciled with the warm support Meinecke's philosophy offered it? This may not be understood, he replies, by outsiders who try to fathom the nature of the Reich with extraneous yardsticks: "Humanitarian enlightenment had been ethical, so had romanticism; both had a common enemy that was, to their way of thinking, unethical: the power state of the ancien régime. Both chided as blind power lust what is in the nature of the state itself. They moralized from the outside instead of trying to understand the state from the inside. They failed to notice that ethics has two aspects - one universal and one individual, concrete aspect. From the individual aspect, the apparent immorality of the state's power-political egoism can be morally justified. For that which springs from the innermost individual nature of a being cannot be immoral.

It is indeed characteristic of the school of Historismus, but it is by no means isolated in the literature of the first decade of this century. It springs from the Lebensphilosophie of Wilhelm Dilthey (who was Meinecke's teacher), from the Vitalism of Hans Driesch, from the Pragmatism of William James, from Henri Bergson's Elan Vital dina Evolution Créatrice, and from George Bernard Shaw's philosophy of life. Meinecke applied their ideas to the life of states, dealing with the nation-state as with an individual in quest of self- fulfillment. The idea was expressed in the title of a book by Rudolf Kjellén, States as Life Forms,1 1 and it must be distinguished on the one hand from Treitschke's "right of the stronger," on the other from Hegel's interpretation of the state as "the reality of the moral idea." Meinecke had rejected both concepts - Treitschke's because it was vulgar and biological, Hegel's because it placed the state at the service of an idea or of the progress of history. What he had in mind was the understanding of the state as a living, developing organism which follows the command of its "inner law." Goethe had bequeathed to Historismus the theory: You are bound to follow "the law by which thou first wert formed. Thus shalt thou be, canst not escape thyself. Sibyls said so and prophets: Nor time nor power ever will destroy Wrought form that vividly develops."12 This is how we must read Cosmopolitanism. The liberals had formulated their aspirations in the War of Liberation, had failed to realize them in the 1848 revolution, and therefore could not oppose Bismarck when he achieved German unity in his own way. After 1866, when he beat reactionary Austria and launched Germany on her career to world power, it became sheer sectarian dogmatism to persist in sterile opposition. The fruit of German unity might have been ill-gotten, but it tasted just as sweet. Historismus always sanctions the results of the power struggle. Although the end may not justify the means, evil means do not invalidate the goal once it has been reached. Thus the Liberals teamed up with Bismarck's state, changing their name to National- Liberals. This was Meinecke's position in 1907. Thirty-three years later, he was faced with a similar dilemma. Hitler had beaten France and threatened to unite Europe under the swastika banner. Meinecke then wrote to a historian friend: "I need not tell you that I have followed the recent [German victories] with pride, joy, and deep emotion. But those who 11 The German edition did not appear until 1917, but Meinecke may have seen the formula in 1905 when it appeared in the preface of Kjellén's work, The Great Powers. He criticized geopolitics and Kjellén in a 1917 essay; but in his late work, The German Catastrophe, he placed him next to Jacob Burckhardt and Johan Huizinga(p. 1 1 1). 12 Urworte, Orphisch: Daimon. (Referred to in Machiavellism, p. 280.)</page><page sequence="7">lg HENRY PACHTER until recently were in opposition have it less easy than the Liberals in 1 866. We may wish to - but we cannot, yet Light and shadow are so distributed that the shadow does not yet appear as belonging to the light. It almost seems as though the motive power of the great and necessary revolutions stemmed from the demonic, evil part of human nature rather than from the good part."13 The demonic! In the earlier work, the state had been all Geist, and in that complacent age before the world wars, the contest of many individual state personalities had appeared as almost a quadrille danced to the sweet harmonies of European culture. Even their rivalries had been seen as revelations of "a higher human order striving for individuality, self-determination, and power."14 War itself hardly changed the relations between equals. Now, with the advent of mob nationalism, these assumptions could no longer be made. Hitler had no respect for other nations' integrity and sovereignty, let alone for their unity; he acknowledged no limitations to power, he represented no Geist but only barbarism. Meinecke now saw the nature of the beast, and his historical tools, he found, were no longer sufficient to deal with it. The book he wrote under the Nazi Reich, the voluminous Origins of Historismus, was a tired retreat from history to aestheticism - not a surrender to the demonic forces but a declaraton of bankruptcy. Liberalism, as we shall see, had no answer to Hitler. Only after the fall of the Third Reich, only after the victories had been followed by disaster, did Meinecke look back, as an old man, on the history he had helped to shape and explain, and acknowledged that the "demon" had been present at the very beginning: "In the brilliance of [Bismarck's] achievement we were not sufficiently aware of the hidden darkness . . . where the disease might set in later," and "it is in the very nature of [the state] . . . that something demonic may leap up any given moment and seize control of the ruling authorities."15 Note the different tone in which the "nature of the state" is referred to here and in Cosmopolitanism. Historismus no longer was able to justify "whatever springs from the innermost nature." The German nation stood accused of having produced, from its innermost nature, the monster of Nazism. To anticipate the end of our story - in his last work, which certainly did not pretend to reach the level of scholarship its author had been 13 To Heinrich von Srbik {Werke VI, p. 194). 14 Cosmopolitanism, p. 190. Ranke, fully aware oí the many wars they had lought witn each other, nevertheless had been able to compose a History of the Germanic and Romanic Nations. After World War I, Meinecke quoted Benedetto Croce to the effect that "through this war both victors and vanquished have reached a higher spiritual life."

He tried to show that Hitler was an extraneous, barbaric irruption into German history, not an organic outgrowth ofthat history. At the same time, the wisdom of his old age had taught him that "the power of the state ever and again acts as an end in itself. The historian . . . recognizing reality, . . . perceives the tragic contrast between that reality and the ideal. Tragic indeed is the history he will have to write."16 In his last lecture, "Ranke and Burckhardt," he also conceded for the first time that Burckhardt might have been right in asserting that the state is evil by its very nature, and culture - which alone guarantees the nation's survival - was now seen outside the state (although by then, 1946, Germany had no state.) We shall now follow in greater detail the pilgrimage of this historian from a position of optimistic monism to one of tragic dualism. II. The Demon Without Friedrich Meinecke was b^rn in 1862 at Salzwedel, a small Prussian town where his father served as a petty official. He grew up amidst the victory celebrations of 1864, 1866, and 1870/71- happy, brief wars that led to the unification of Germany under Bismarck and to the rapid rise of the Reich to world power. The father's house was conservative, pietistic, and patriotic. Meinecke's university teachers also earned the name of "the Prussian school of history," and it was under their wing that he obtained first a position at the Secret State Archive and later as assistant editor of the Historische Zeitschrift. There he earned the gratitude of traditional historians by warding off the onslought of insurgents who tried to introduce psycho-sociological methods, recognized the importance of economic history, and suggested a progression in the history of civilization. Meinecke, who soon became editor, was never interested in the history of civilization. He found it a somehow unworthy subject, "nothing but a colorful picture book of mores . . . and material factors of external life, down to eating and drinking habits. This petty-bourgeois, pleasure-seeking interest in the history of civilization has been awakened decisively by Voltaire."17 The main issue, however, was causality - whether history obeys any laws - a question to which Meinecke was to return often. He rejected all 16 The German Catastrophe, p. 110. 17 Werke III {Historismus), p. 106. Meinecke hated Voltaire; mentioning him here was an expression of disapproval.</page><page sequence="9">20 HENRY PACHTER determinism and even attempts at systematizing in history. He praised Ranke for "not enclosing life in the mortuary of definitions." Only in the socio-economic mass processes does a blind law of causality prevail; ideas, religion, the arts and the sciences are freely created. Mediating between the two extremes - body and soul, matter and spirit - is the realm of the political which participates in both: it freely creates forms but it must work through material interests; its impulses come from great individuals, but they must find material forces to lead and to mould. Political history studies the unfolding of "wrought forms" (Goethe) or "God's thoughts" (Ranke) or "historical individualities" (Meinecke). These, and the ideas about them, are the proper study of history. For the same reason, the HZ fought valiantly against positivism, Marxism, Hegelianism, and all other attempts to find "laws" in history - Lamprecht, Spengler, and Toynbee. It is true that in defense of professionalism the HZ also warded off the attacks of Stefan George's school and of other mythmakers. But the Nazis were not altogether wrong when they charged - thirty years later - that the common people never appeared in the pages of either the HZ or of Meinecke's works. We must label him a traditionalist working at the center of the establishment. His first work was rather conventional - a two-volume Life of Field Marshal Hermann von Boyen (1896-99). Boyen was a reformer during the War of Liberation, the creator of a people's army, a Kantian, a hero, and a model for Meinecke's own political development. Religious doubts had led to estrangement from the father, but Meinecke's first steps into politics were still guided by his Christian heritage. He followed the court chaplain Adolf Stoecker, an anti- Semitic demagogue who hoped to win the workers over to the monarchy but found only middle-class and aristocratic sponsors. He accepted their Christian-Social principle of national community but became disgusted with their vulgarity and passed over to the Progressive Party. There he found a congenial group of brilliant intellectuals: Max Weber, the father of German sociology; Hugo Preuss, who was to write the Weimar Constitution; Theodor Heuss, who was to be the first President of the Bonn Republic; the historian Walter Goetz, whom the Nazis were to deprive of his chair, and Ernst Troeltsch, the liberal theologian turned sociologist; above all the charismatic leader, Pastor Friedrich Naumann who tried to transform political liberalism into social liberalism and the Empire into a social monarchy. The Progressive Party was opposed to the Prussian caste system; it aimed to crack the power of the Junker class, to break up the big estate in the east, and to replace the aristocratic government by</page><page sequence="10">Masters of Cultural History: Meinecke 21 modern, more democratic selection procedures. Although it was not opposed to imperialism, it became increasingly worried by the Kaiser's erratic course in foreign policy, his blustering provocations, his perilous challenge to British sea power. However, Naumann's Mitteleuropa design should not be mistaken for a forerunner of the Common Market; it was an intelligent alternative to militarism. Meinecke interpreted it to say: "Our imperialism should be federative rather than expansionist." He was unemotionally modern. To Pan-German fretting over the emergence of Slav states in the Balkans he answered : Their policies will have to be guided by interests of the region, not by racial emotions, and he added: "Race theories have wreaked enough havoc in science; they could produce worse delusions in politics."18 Meinecke was then teaching at Strasbourg and Freiburg, in the freer atmosphere of southern liberalism, and in close contact with the Baden school of neo-Kantian philosophers who also were liberals. He concurred with their well-known distinction between natural and cultural sciences: The former seek universal or general laws, the latter deal with phenomena that are not repeatable, hence can be neither predicted nor used to test a law. The "cultural sciences" (Geisteswissenschaften) are also concerned with values. For both these reasons Meinecke concluded that history was not "science" in the sense of the natural sciences. But far from being less than a science, history thereby becomes free to be more than a science and to follow its value- oriented concerns, relating the "higher" purposes to the pursuits of statesmen and state thinkers. In this conception, the historian was able to create the saga of his nation even while observing the strictest rules of scholarly research. It was in these happy years that Meinecke wrote the optimistic Cosmopolitanism, hoping that national community, the reconciliation of power with the whole nation, including the workers, could yet be realized. That day seemed to have come in August 1914, when the war fever swept the peoples of Europe, when the soldiers marched out with flowers in the barrels of their guns and promised the girls that they would be home by Christmas with presents. The workers, who so long had stood aloof from the national community, now joined enthusiastically in the defense of the fatherland; on August 4, the Social Democrats in the Reichstag voted the Kaiser's war appropriations unanimously. In his memoirs Meinecke remembers that "this was one of 18 Werke II. After World War I, his judgment on the Balkan S lavs became much harsher: Machiavellism, p. 419. Although he had studied nationalism, Meinecke did not expect the virulence it was to assume in the 1920s.</page><page sequence="11">22 HENRY PACHTER the most beautiful days of my life";19 he also joined other professors and writers (like Thomas Mann) in explaining to the world that this was a war of Geist against materialistic rapacity. When the Entente propagandists retorted that the Germans, not content with aspiring to world domination, also claimed a monopoly on Geist, friend Troeltsch asked back: "Why should the Germans not fight for their right to be different?" Meinecke endorsed this sentiment; but he also hoped that the war, like the War of Liberation a hundred years earlier, would become a war of German renewal. He admonished the Kaiser's government not to lose the beautiful momentum: Now, while the Germans were winning, was the time to enlarge the Reichstag's responsibilities, to abolish the discriminatory three-class suffrage in Prussia and the Junker domination in government; new and more capable elites were growing out of the middle classes and even from the workers' ranks. As a historian, Meinecke also offered the lesson from the past: A fair and honorable peace must be negotiated, leaving no ressentiments and no irredentas that would endanger the postwar peace. He was distressed by the unrestrained chauvinism which the war had unleashed, and especially by the Pan-Germans, who sought extensive annexations and German domination over Europe. Their misuse of great German names of the past provoked Meinecke to charge: "They imitate the mannerisms of those idols; of their inner pathos they know nothing. They emulate their firebrand extravaganzas but ignore the political-philosophical conceptions from which their heroic will had sprung and which were diametrically opposite to the dilettante nationalism of our contemporary racists. Humanity was then the springboard of patriotism .... They read Fichte's Orations to the German Nation but they lack the humanist background that is the true source of national policy."20 Still more courage was required to tell an academic audience that the much-heralded contrast between the Germanic and the Latin spirit existed only in the viewer's eye.21 Even so, Meinecke's own peace aims look moderate only when compared to the Pan-German program. Instead of annexing Belgium, he merely wished to reduce it to a satellite state; he proposed to annex Baltic Kurland; from England's and France's colonial empire he wanted to take only enough to connect Germany's possessions in East and West Africa. Although he knew, 19 Strassburg - Freiburg - Berlin, p. 137. 20 Werke II, p. 365. Johann Gottlieb Fichte, the philosopher of identity, was known mostly for these patriotic lectures. 21 Werke IV, pp. 154-160. As asserted at the annual "Emperor s Birthday lecture, 1916, this was almost a provocation.</page><page sequence="12">Masters of Cultural History: Meinecke 23 earlier than most Germans, that any chance to win the war had been lost in its first months, he expected the German troops to hold out on French territory to the last day. Patriotism had always narrowed German liberals' minds. Nevertheless, when Meinecke moved to Berlin, he helped found the League for Freedom and Fatherland as a counter to the Pan-German League and worked on the Peace Resolution of the Reichstag majority. Rightists later were to charge that the German armies had been "unbeaten in the field" but were "stabbed in the back" by defeatists, traitors, and Jews. The Right also charged that by signing the Treaty of Versailles - which all Germans held to be unfair - the Left had espoused the Entente's thesis of Germany's war guilt. As we have seen, this latter charge even contained a grain of truth: Liberals like Meinecke felt that German diplomacy under the Kaiser had missed opportunities to appease England, and Social Democrats were convinced that the Kaiser bore a major share of responsibility for the outbreak of World War I. These were very important issues for both German politics and German historiography; we must therefore ascertain which position Meinecke and, under his editorship, the HZ took on both questions. The HZ frequently polemicized against the Entente thesis of Germany's war guilt; but it never tried to disarm the Rightists' double charge that the republican parties had ended the war too soon and signed the war guilt clause without need. All through the 1920s, the HZ failed to call the Kaiser's regime to account for starting the war, losing it, and not telling the German people the truth about it. Meinecke made a feeble attempt to mention the subject in the book he had begun to write during the war. He refers to the famous chapter in the Discorsici, 53) where Machiavelli discusses "ignominy": It will always be difficult to explain to the nationalistic mob a decision that seems to be cowardly; while demagogues recklessly clamor for confrontation policies, the statesman must have the courage to accept ignominy if it is necessary to save the country. Then Meinecke goes on: "The most powerful statement [of raison d'état] is found at the end of Discorsi (III, 41). It must have sounded in the ear of a certain great statesman during the [First] World War : that one may save the fatherland con ignominia. 'When the question is how to save the fatherland, one should not hesitate. . .'"22 Like all his colleagues, Meinecke thought little of the masses, especially where foreign policy was concerned. Since he saw the state, above all, as an entity rivalling other states, his concern for 22 Machiavellism, p. 44.</page><page sequence="13">24 HENRY PACHTER democratization was motivated less by a demand for justice than by the need to integrate the workers in the national enterprise. His politics were patrician; his historical thinking was informed by a strong desire for continuity. He often asserted that his philosophy was comprehensible only to an "elite of highly cultured men" and would do little good to the fainthearted. When the revolution occurred on November 9, 1918, Meinecke did not at once accept it. But he saw that the monarchy could not be brought back and the republic was the only institutional framework in which the Reich could survive. "If we cannot have what we love, let us love what we have," he told his students. Like Stresemann and Rathenau, he was Vernunftrepublikaner , a republican of convenience. He helped to convert the Progressive Party into a Democratic Party; he supported the concept of a "broad coalition" comprising the moderate middle-class parties and the Social Democrats. He campaigned against Hindenburg in his first presidential election (1925), but in the early 1930s he supported his project to strengthen the presidency. Instead of the unstable party government he would have liked to see a Vertrauensdiktatur- di trusteeship dictatorship- which, of course, was to prevent the Nazis from mobilizing the mob. The foreign policy of the Republic also could profit from a critique of the blunders which the previous regime had committed. Meinecke therefore studied the failure of the Anglo-German Rapprochement 1890-1901 and advised the Republic to seek "means other than the old power politics."23 Meinecke 's political intent was immediately recognized , and the book was severely attacked by nationalist historians like Gerhard Ritter and Otto Westphal (who called Meinecke "the Locarno historian," alluding to the pact of 1925 that reconciled Germany and the Western powers; ludicrously, East German historians now echo this charge). It also fell to Meinecke's lot to defend the Republic against anti- Semitic slander, especially the charge that "alien elements" and upstarts had been favored by the revolution. In 1926 he told an academic audience : "It is true that some strata of our population, which only now have obtained the opportunity to be integrated into the life of the nation, have not yet acquired all traditions of our national life. That their life should be alloyed with cosmopolitan ideas is quite legitimate and relates to our ideal of humanity, which the nationalistic strata have lost.

Our left-wing press, which generally strives to preserve our national values, shows once in a while - if I may be candid - some Jewish ressentiment. These are infantile disorders in the process of a development that will integrate those strata which so far had been kept outside the state."24 Jews, however, were only one of the new strata that had gained access to public life recently. The revolution of November 1918 brought recognition to the new masses; politics became a game of parliamentary parties. Instead of the dream of national community, there was pluralism; the nationalization of the masses had resulted in what Hendrik de Man was to call the "massification of the nation" and Ortega y Gasset, The Revolt of the Masses. Politics was no longer the preserve of an elite that may be inspired by an idea, but had to address itself to the interests of economic groups and to the passions of the mob. New forces became active in world history, and the alternatives that were open to a German policy were all equally distasteful: "We have to choose between the capitalist-imperialist order which enslaves us, and the federative- socialist order which contrasts with all our traditions," wrote friend Otto H intze to Troeltsch. Meinecke was deeply worried about the loss of that authority which he always associated with Kultur. In a review of Jacob Burckhardt's letters he recalled that master's criticism of the 'terrible simplifiers" and continued: "He saw the coming of the terrible authority that was to save us from disrespectful democracy. This was the deep conflict in his nature, which hated power as evil but knew that without it no higher culture is possible."25 The war experience had cast much doubt on the harmonious outlook of the prewar years and had brought Meinecke closer to Jacob Burckhardt's pessimistic, dualistic philosophy. The mobilization of the masses had changed the nature of warfare. Militarism, nationalism, and capitalism now formed a fatal triumvirate that threatened to engulf Western civilization. All these new developments, to which was added 24 Werke II, p. 411. It is regrettable that a former student of Meinecke should have written, without quoting the text verbatim: "In April 1926 he voiced opposition to the expanding cosmopolitan cynicism, and he specifically pointed to Jews." (Rosenbliith, op.cit., p. 1 1 2.) I cannot detect any sign of anti-Semitism in the above passage. It rather strives for socio-psychological explanation and, more important, pleads for understanding. Interestingly, Meinecke spoke much more harshly after the war, when most Germans tried to avoid the subject {The German Catastrophe, p. 32). Meinecke had many Jewish friends, like Walter Goetz, and maintained an intensive correspondence with those of his former students who had to emigrate. In 1933 he tried - vainly - to prevent the dismissal of Gustav Mayer. Mr. Rosenbliith does not quote any of the many passages in which Meinecke condemns Gobineau's and Nietzsche's race theories. 25 HZ (1923).</page><page sequence="15">26 HENRY PACHTER the powerlessness of the Reich, forced Meinecke to rethink his assumptions. He could no longer presuppose any pre-established harmony between power and spirit, and while he was not prepared to abandon the Rankean faith in the ethical value of the state, he also had to admit that Historismus opened the door to subjectivist, hedonist, relativistic ethics, or at least to a pluralism that looked much less appealing than Ranke's "joyous variety of state personalities." Troeltsch spoke of "crisis of Historismus" and wrote a heavy volume, Problems of Historismus, which Meinecke reviewed in HZ (1923). Both friends were apprehensive of the "abyss of relativism," of an "anarchy of values" that plagued the Western world, and both were looking for ways to "bridge" the chasm between ethos and kratos. But a hundred years after Hegel, they no longer found that bridge in any "cunning of history" that might force the ideal and the real to converge in infinity: "All is individuality, each follows its own private law, everything has a right to life, everything is relative, everything flows - give me a point in space to stand on ! "26 III. The Demon Within Meinecke gave his own answer to the crisis in the major work he had begun to write during the war: The Idea of Raison d'Etat in Modern History. It is a work of doubt and ambiguity, bearing the scars of many ideological battles. Its theme is the problematic of power - not simply "Machiavellism" as the title of the translation would indicate. If once the state had appeared as the most noble embodiment of a nation's awareness of eternal values,27 now it is seen as acting under physical constraints; no matter how high the purposes of some men may be, the very structure of the state makes it prone to lapses into baseness. "It is a frightful fact of history that we cannot hope to achieve radical morality in that [highest] community which comprises all other human communities."28 Worse, the historian often is bewildered by immoral forces which nevertheless bring forth desirable results. Although moralizing history is still widely practiced, scholarly history "is obliged to accept the uncomfortable fact - disturbing, nay shocking though it be - that nature and reason are not as easy to distinguish as friend and foe."» 26 Schaffender Spiegeh p. 223.

(This follows from the basic tenet of Historismus and its rejection of all "moralizing history.") As the study of techniques of statecraft, Machiavellism therefore is of little interest to Meinecke; its problems "belong in the realm of nature, with ants and bees,"31 its answers are based on mere "cunning," and the underlying morality is strictly utilitarian: Should a prince keep treaties? Yes, if he wishes to build confidence. Must he always keep treaties? Not when the survival of the state is at stake. The criteria of conduct are found along an axis from prudence to recklessness, or from practicality to impracticality. But a Christian prince must think not only of his credibility down here; he must also consider his credit account in the afterlife. A formidable bookkeeper, called conscience, tells him to temper the immoderation that lurks in every act of state and to fight the "demon" of pleonexia (cupidity): "Next to hunting and loving, pleonexia is the most powerful elemental impulse in man."32 Considered rightly, this ethics is prudential too, and the anguish of a prince who sins for the good of the state still does not yield us a political ethics. The decision whether he will remember Hell is still subjective, a matter of his conscience alone. Nevertheless, and notwithstanding Machiavelli, statesmen do recognize a second axis which guides their conduct; it runs from the permissible to the impermissible, and statesmen write memoirs to persuade posterity that their aims were pure. Few are as cynical as Frederick the Great, who introduced his Histoire de mon temps by saying: "I hope that posterity will distinguish between the philosopher in me and the ruler, the respectable man and the politician."33 But Meinecke wishes to liberate us from this frame of reference and to steer us toward an intrinsic understanding of power. The subtle method he uses to lure his reader away from the "moralistic" to the historical approach is characteristic of Historismus at its fascinating best. In the beginning, Meinecke reports, Frederick justified his wanton war for 30 Ibid., p. 5. 1 shall use "Reason of State" when this meaning is clearly intended, "raison d'état" when opportunistic Machiavellism is intended. Meinecke's usage does not always agree with his definition. 31 Ibid., p. 7. 32 Ibid.. d. 4. 33 Quoted by Meinecke, ibid., p. 301.</page><page sequence="17">28 HENRY PACHTER Silesia by saying that he had his subjects' best interests in mind - a feeble argument, and Meinecke readily admits that the Silesians were not happier after being conquered. When the war lasted seven years, moreover, Frederick's argument no longer sounded credible, and he shifted it ever so slightly: "Rulers are the slaves of their resources; the interest of the state is their law." In a new edition of his early work, Antimachiavell, he made a similar change: Instead of "The king is the first servant of his people" it now read, "The king is the first servant of the state." Meinecke comments shrewdly : "At first sight the earlier draft may strike one as more modern .... But in fact 'people' then stood for mere population, subjects, not for any real nation .... The term was humanitarian and rationalistic. Frederick's transition from 'people' to 'state' indicates a movement in the direction of modern thought, toward the national state .... The ability to understand such entities is a characteristic of the modern mind .... It was Frederick's state that first created the fixed and definite form with which it became possible for a mere population to be welded into a nation with its own vital will."34 Presumably, the Silesians need not be happy but they ought to be proud that they provided the opportunity for Prussia to become a big power. Later, Meinecke even introduces a Hegelian argument to bolster Frederick's claim: "He laid the foundations of a state which would eventually be constitutional."35 Providential history is anathema to Historismus; but to celebrate certain heroes the function of Hegel's World Spirit is taken over by a new notion of Reason of State which diverges sharply from the ordinary meaning of Machia vellism. By no means is everything permitted to every state. Where the state fails to fulfill an ideal, it cannot invoke any "reason" of state to justify its sheer lust for power. Thus Meinecke treats the Renaissance condottieri, from whose maxims after all Machiavelli abstracted his theories, with utter contempt. What does great credit to Frederick is but petty selfishness in the case of those Italian princelings: "Their impure, petty means hardly concealed their power lessness. Their states had no real nobility; their ragione di stato could not justify power from an idealistic point of view."36 What they were lacking, obviously, was that specific Geist that gives a state an identity and welds its people into a nation: ''Ragione di stato was not yet seen as the public welfare .... The state was still incomplete, its power and authority had not yet reached the dignity of being self-evident."37 34 Ibid., p. 308. 35 Ibid., p. 309. 36 Ibid., p. 91. 37 Ibid., p. 123.</page><page sequence="18">Masters of Cultural History: Meinecke 29 One should expect that from here a historian pursuing the march of the national idea would be led to notions such as "general will," "commonweal," or "public happiness." Strangely enough, The Idea of Reason of State does not mention these terms at all, nor does it discuss their authors. For all we learn from Meinecke, neither Rousseau nor Cromwell, neither the French nor the American Revolution (not to mention Marx or Lenin) produced any political theory. The reason for this omission was not simple German provincialism. Meinecke was striving for a positive view of the state; for him the revolutionary state embodied all that the state should not be: the instrument of the masses, expression of the passions, "the demonic"; such states hardly deserved the name, and their ethics was lower than that of a condottiere. He could not concede to them a reason of state. He never tires of telling us that Geist, a noble idea, must inspire the state, or else it is left to the demon.38 I am afraid his bias here is one of class and of political orientation. Such partisanship violates a principle of Historismus: that no historical formation and no individual Geist is to be preferred, or dubbed "higher," that all are alike in value. Yet in practice both Ranke and Meinecke freely used the predicates "higher" and "lower," and they did not recognize any Geist of which they disapproved. Nevertheless, Meinecke's selection of those states that have Geist and those that don't, does not seem quite so arbitrary. The demon is known by the fact that its behavior is uncontrolled and the power drive is unchecked; Geist, by contrast, shows where the state sets itself limited goals. We already have encountered praise for a statesman who took ignominy upon himself to save the fatherland. Most revealing is the laudatio for Bismarck. To Meinecke he represented "the most sublime and successful synthesis between the old raison d'état of the cabinets and the new popular forces .... With Machiavellian ruthlessness and acute calculation of power resources, he created the German state; but the same calculation also enabled him to see the limits of the power Germany was capable of. An intimate connection here exists between his temperate foreign policy after 1871 and his suppression of parliamentary and democratic tendencies. He was deeply convinced that responsibility to parliaments made it difficult to avoid risky policies."3* In the concluding chapter Meinecke touches again on this subject of mass nationalism, of the passions of popular parties, of the need for the statesman to fight the "Machiavellism of the masses." Referring to the Ruhr occupation by France in 1923 he denounces "the modern forces of militarism, nationalism.

This ties in with a second line of thought which provides the woof to the warp of his argument throughout The Idea of Reason of State. In Meinecke's mind the ideas of democracy and revolution were closely enmeshed with the Enlightenment of the eighteenth century, and this in turn had been identified with the "shallow French mind." During World War I German intellectuals, led by Thomas Mann, had sounded the clarion of a cultural revolution against Western ways of thought. Historismus was counted upon to show the deeper understanding of the cause in dispute; for the root evil of contemporary Western culture was its tradition of Natural Law - the doctrine that had come down from the ancient Stoa through the philosophy of the Christian Middle Ages to the Enlightenment; it had led to the idea of the social contract, to pacifism, and eventually to positivism and Marxism. Its basic flaw was the assumption that reason is one, and that its conclusions are applicable to all situations and all people alike. It was responsible for pluralism and equalitarianism, for the idea of progress in history, and for the moralistic approach to raison d'état. It produced "the naive illusion that one can distinguish between just and unjust wars,"41 and it paid no respect to outstanding individuals like Frederick the Great and Bismarck, or to lofty conceptions of state like theirs. Can they really be judged by the same standards of morality that are rightly invoked against a Cola di Rienzo, a Robespierre? The "generalizing" approach left no room for the contemplation ofthat which was unique; its abstract principles suppressed that which had grown organically. Secondly, the rationalist approach is mechanistic and does not lead to an understanding of natural, organic bodies like the state. An example of the pernicious contract theory is Hobbes's Leviathan. Strong though Hobbes would make his state, essentially it is no different from the "liberal night-watchman state." Put together mechanically for purely utilitarian purposes, it is not a life form to which people can become attached emotionally. "Hobbes's Leviathan has no soul."42 Reason of State can be truly understood and vindicated only from the vantage point of Historismus, which conceives the state as "a life that springs from an original tendency, from an inner movement";43 the history of the idea of Reason of State is the story of the development of 40 Ibid., p. 423. 41 Referring to Grotius, ibid., p. 209. 42 Ibid., pp. 214-215. - Obviously, the critique of rationalism was not peculiar to Meinecke and Historismus, but was fed from many sources during the 1920s. 43 Ranke, Werke 33, p. 153. The passage resembles Meinecke's statement in Cosmopolitanism (text to note 10, supra).</page><page sequence="20">Masters of Cultural History: Meinecke 3 1 this approach. Moreover, the way Meinecke has written the story, the idea really emerged in a continuous polemics against the contract theory, and its real history is the battle of German Historismus against French rationalism, a world-historical battle not only between two conceptions of politics but between two political cultures - the one starting from the individual and constituting the state by contract, the other starting from community and constituting the state as its soul. "The fundamental shortcoming of Western thought was that it had no grasp of the real state and could not affect the statesman deeply. It did not prevent the modern hypertrophy of Machia vellism, and it resulted either in confused complaints and doctrinaire postulates, or in hypocrisy and cant."44 Only where power is seen as the life element of the state, only where historical reality is grasped, can Reason of State be understood and used. Since each state must find its particular Reason of State, the problem of ethics has been shifted from philosophy to history, or from a judgment from general principles to a judgment about a particular historical entity. We might elucidate this idea further by differentiating it from others that might look similar. Hegel had "legitimized the bastard" with the device of the "cunning of Reason," and he placed state power at the service of a higher idea. He combined ruthless realism in regard to particular state action with a transcendent view of world history: "The filth of reality which surrounded the philosopher did not besmirch him."45 Ranke had criticized Hegel, but in his own practice he totally identified the statesman's conduct with the development of the state personality; he saw the finger of God in all manifestations of history and tended to set aside the elemental motives .... His optimistic outlook hid the murky side of the power struggle from him."46 But at the same time he opened the door to a relativistic view that had an explanation for everything, and after him came Treitschke, Nietzsche, and "the sinister host" of Darwinians, naturalists and chauvinists who "used the predicate 'moral' rather lightly" to justify immoral acts.47 Cautiously, Meinecke warned the Germans that their vitalist theories, their blind acceptance of all state power as "moral," had put them in the wrong. He criticized Treitschke for justifying war as a moral necessity. "German historical thought tends to excuse and idealize power politics on the 44 Machiavellism, p. 426. 45 Ibid., pp. 350 and 368. 46 Ibid., p. 388. 47 Ibid., pp. 407-408.</page><page sequence="21">32 HENRY PACHTER ground of superior morality. Thus, despite all reservations that were made, it pointed to a crudely naturalistic ethics of force."48 From there on Meinecke's argument became dialectical- or perhaps it merely zigzagged: If power was seen as the essence of state, self- preservation took precedence over moral obligations, and a state striving for power did not act morally but in the elemental sphere. "It is possible for this power drive to be moral - if it serves moral qualities - but even then it does not lose its natural character."49 The line which Meinecke draws is so fine that being on the side of decency may become a matter of personal character rather than of precepts of conduct.50 Meinecke saw a "sinister line going from Machiavelli to nationalism," but he treated "this error . . . with respect."51 For these forces which Meinecke fears are the same forces he must use to build his state. They are destructive when they are not mastered by Reason of State, but they cannot be repudiated. The whole point of Historismus is that the higher purposes of power are inseparably tied to the vital forces and interests. Without the unremitting power drives of some groups of men, mankind would not have reached the stage of state-building, and would still be without those higher forms of organization that make culture possible.52 The Hegelian vision of "stages," which Historismus rejects in other contexts, becomes essential here, not as a theodicy but as a reminder that evil forces are a necessary part of history. War, too, "can never be banished from the earth because it is inseparably tied to the nature of the state."53 Elsewhere, he quotes Adam Ferguson : "Without the jealousy of nations and the practice of war, civil society would not have found its form," and adds : 'This remark points to a new age . . . that gives the state its due place."54 Throughout the book, a constant dialectical development has taken place : The demon, who must provide the driving force for cultural achievement, also may destroy it; Reason of State must both tame and develop the demon. They are engaged in unrelenting struggle. Toward the end of Machiavellism, therefore, only the plaint remains: "In history there are too many things in which God and the Devil are intertwined. One of the most important is Reason of State .... The historian can never tire of gazing into it." Likewise, in his essay "Causalities and 48 Ibid., p. 426. Such formulations drew fire from indignant reviewers in the German press. 49 Ibid., d. 407. 50 Ibid., p. 409. 51 Ibid., p. 409. 52 Introduction to Machiavellism; also Schaffender Spiegel, p. 220. 53 Machiavellism, p. 429. 54 Historismus, p. 265.</page><page sequence="22">Masters of Cultural History: Meinecke 33 Values," Meinecke remarked: "What is most shocking is to discover an intimate link of causality between the biological and the ethical spheres : that great, beautiful values of culture often originate in mean, unclean causes, working up from night and deep, so that it sometimes looks as if God were working through the Devil to realize himself."55 So the fight between good and evil, which Historismus had claimed to transcend, had been reproduced inside Reason of State. Meinecke may have thought that the "moralizing" approach to Machia vellism could be waved away with the magic wand of history. But the historians were in a position somewhat similar to the psychologists: They had driven out the superstitious belief in the Devil - only to find the Id inside the personality structure. So the ideal may no longer fight the evil forces from "outside," but it must now fight them inside. The very last word of Machiavellism, therefore, is the tearful ambiguity: "The statesman should always carry God and the State in his heart, or else he might be overpowered by the demon (whom he cannot shake off completely anyway)." Clearly, no abyss has been bridged, no dichotomy has been transcended; history has not superseded philosophy; the two horns of the dilemma are as visible as before; a liberal's conscience still faces Machiavellism, and the liberal political theory is more bewildered than before it was stated so bravely and succinctly. Meinecke frankly acknowledged that historians had no answer to relativistic ethics. "Historical thinking, . . . which perhaps is the only remaining key to the understanding of man, dissolves everything into flowing life, threatening to lose the firm hold on one's own condition and to leave us with a skeptical relativism."56 To escape from the dualism, Meinecke refined his three-tier model by relating it to three kinds of causality: - On the lowest level, nature is ruled by the blind laws of "mechanical causality" or "external necessity." Here effect is always equivalent to its cause, and all creation is languishing in the servitude of this our animal heritage. (This is the neo-Kantian heritage.) - On the middle level, "organic causes" (also called biological or ideological causes) rule "individualities" (which may be persons, groups, classes, states, churches, or other institutions). Obedient to "internal necessity," each follows its star, its entelechy or "destiny." (Schicksal, a key word in German philosophy through the first half of this century, is not accident but metaphysical necessity.) Effect here may 55 Werke IV, p. 81. 56 Schaffender Spiegel, p. 214.</page><page sequence="23">34 HENRY PACHTER transcend its cause - as development or transformation. (This is Dilthey's and Vitalism's contribution.) - The highest realm is occupied by pure ideas and values. Here causality is creative morally, spiritually, or artistically. It is truly free; it alone, therefore, is "historical." For "cultural history alone is history," it alone creates "singular spiritual values: historical individualities." Not surprisingly, "Historical individuals are those that have a tendency toward the good, the true, and the beautiful."57 (This may be the influence of Eduard Spranger, to whom Meinecke was close.) Such astounding formulations might have landed Meinecke in some kind of Platonism. But as yet, in this "second period," he had no intention of dismissing as irrelevant all the history he loved - "where the clashing of the mundanely crude forces of political life awakens individual ideas which struggle for realization" - and he declined to say "whether the state itself or Plato's idea of it is the higher value."58 For he knows that to realize themselves the highest values have to descend into the arena of the middle tier, mix with nature, and become tainted with causality. He is too much of a historian to enjoy for long the contemplation of pure values. But he wishes very much to "spiritualize" the state and other contingent values. To do that, he treats them as "individualities." Thus we find "the Prussian idea," used not as a metaphor but as a reality. Even the admiring Walther Hofer complains that with Meinecke one can never tell whether an idea is a general principle or a life force, an ideal or an instinct; and Johan Huizinga poked fun at the German disease of "historical anthropomorphism": collective entities are reified and seem to act as though they were persons. Meinecke was quite aware of the danger this entailed when others, e.g. Treitschke or Spengler, used such techniques: "Moral responsibility is not concentrated in one individual but must be borne by the collective, although it can act only through individuals . . . . Where collective purposes are at stake, the moral sense is weakened; the agent takes the view that 'the business' requires acts that an individual might not take upon himself .... Actions for supra- individual purposes have a tendency towards matter-of-factness, and at the same time a frightful tendency towards cold heartlessness. We do not say this for sentimental reasons but to demonstrate the tragic nature of historical life"59. When he wrote this, Meinecke did not know that twenty years later the German nation would have to answer the charge 57 "Causalities and Values" in Werke IV, pp. 78 and 85. - "Culture" {Kultur) is, of course, arts, philosophy, religion and pure science. 58 Ibid.y p. 88. 59 Machiavellism, p. 407.</page><page sequence="24">Masters of Cultural History: Meinecke 35 of "collective guilt." As a historian he had seen that to act means to incur guilt, but neither he nor Troeltsch mentions "original sin" in this context. What they see is man's private conscience pitted against "Schicksar - the inevitable collusion of the "high" with the "low." But in each individual case the mixture had to be evaluated differently. Thus he resented Voltaire's description of the base motives in Frederick the Great's policies and stressed their "spiritual" tendency. But idealistic historiography cannot evade this dilemma- either to suppress the seamy side of its heroes or to sanctify it. There is a deep philosophical calamity hidden in this moral dilemma, at least for one so intimately connected with the tradition of German idealism. The historical individuality- state, party, or person- must represent a universal principle, or rather must embody it as the tragic hero does in a drama. Unless the general and the particular, the idea and the interest, freedom and necessity, creativity and causality meet in the movement of this individuality, history loses its meaning. In his important book, Geschichtschreibung und Weltanschauung, Professor Walther Hofer has made a heroic effort to square all the categories for Meinecke, but he can do that only at the expense of history : The living, acting subject of history disappears when the idea is to be saved, and the idea is beclouded whenever the state individuality appears in all its dimensions. IV. The Demon Triumphant The problem, then, is to live with the contradiction in full awareness of its irreconcilability. Both Troeltsch and Meinecke have often resorted to the word "tragic" to describe either the human condition as they saw it or the philosophy on which they had to settle. "Both the ideas of identity and of individuality- those two supreme and fruitful ideas of the modern German mind- showed the inner tragic two-edged quality of all great historical ideas and forces."60 "Tragic realism" also was the prevailing style of German literature during the Weimar Republic, and tragic was indeed the fate of the liberals, who vainly tried to imbue that republic with the Geist of classical Weimar. One thinks of Thomas Mann's famous speech in which he rallied to the Republic and at the same time recommended to it "a politics of Novalis." Likewise, Meinecke recommended to the republicans as great models of German statesmen- Frederick the Great and Bismarck. He did not mention any more the heroes of his first 60 Ibid., p. 369.</page><page sequence="25">36 HENRY PACHTER books, the reformers of 1814 whom he knew so well: Humboldt, Stein, Hardenberg, nor the liberals of the 1848 revolution. Did liberalism generate no heroes, no ideas, no conception of the state? Meinecke's style seems to exclude a definite stand; everything is yes - but, no - however, on the one hand - on the other, both this - and its opposite. His subtle ambiguities, the fugatos of argument and counterargument chasing each other, the ritardandos, the anguish - all that liberal philosophizing seems weak in comparison with the robust certainties of the Catholics, agrarians, and conservatives on the one hand, the communists on the other, and looks like mere literature next to the nuts- and-bolts approach of the positivist school. His Hamlet nature is vulnerable to the irrationalist attack from the nationalist right and to the rationalist assault from the left. The liberal bourgeoisie was not armed ideologically when the demon struck. Machiavellism went to press when Hitler staged his Beer Hall putsch; it appeared in the same year as Thomas Mann's Magic Mountain, and indeed there is much that the two authors and their books have in common : the same ambiguity, the same wrestling with the ever-present demon, the same efforts to grapple with the problems of a liberal conscience.61 The similarity becomes frightening a few years later when we see the historian and the novelist alike turn away from the uncomfortable political problems that inspired their works of 1924, and seek refuge in aestheticism and a second-hand humanism. Meinecke's third great work, begun in the late 1920s and published in 1937 under the Nazi regime, inaugurates his "third period." It is a deeply contemplative, but ambiguous book, because of the circumstances under which it appeared. Origin of Historismus marches a series of eighteenth-century writers past a Geiger counter and gives each a good or bad mark reflecting the percentage of rationalism and of Historismus that can be detected. But the series breaks up abruptly with Herder, and, surprisingly, the last 150 (out of 600) pages are devoted to Goethe although Goethe admittedly did not care for history and had little to say about it. (At the same time Thomas Mann was writing Lotte in Weimar and The Stories of Jacob, and Hermann Hesse, after the searing Steppenwolf, the dream story Narziss und Goldmund - Death and the Lover.) After having been told that history is the only road to the understanding of man, we are given the advice to flee from history into the realm of humanist reflections, from public virtue to private serenity. 61 "Meinecke was to historiography what Thomas Mann was to the novel" (Peter Gay, "Weimar Culture," in D. Fleming and Bernard Bailyn, The Intellectual Migration, Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1969).</page><page sequence="26">Masters of Cultural History: Meinecke 37 Were the early 1930s the time to abandon contemporary themes? Here, precisely, is the trouble with the book. Meinecke, just like Thomas Mann, chose to exalt the humanism of Goethe, and no one can doubt that a few years later this was a courageous thing to do. (Georg Lukács, interestingly, applied the same strategy in Moscow.) For Meinecke, however, this meant shifting the battlefield from political philosophy to culture. He did not confront the barbarians at all, but turned his back on history. What had seemed an odd misuse of philosophical language in the "Causalities" essay (see text to footnote 57), is suddenly seen as the way out: Only cultural history is history, the relationship between political history and cultural history is broken. Where the development of the idea of National State had been based on a substratum- the German Reich - and the development of the idea of Reason of State still could be grafted on a development of European history, the development of the idea of Historismus had turned into the Lebeusphilosophie of some persons. History, instead of being made concrete, was aestheticized. The liberal bourgeoisie had once embraced a straightforward materialism, tempered by residual Christianity. The resulting tensions, however, had become intolerable for a large part of the middle class by the turn of the century; their materialism degenerated into biological, racial, or Nietzschean naturalism, or else evaporated into mysticism. The more refined and educated strata of the upper middle class, on the contrary, strove to maintain the continuity with the classical period of German idealism, especially with its worship of the personality. Historismus, as Meinecke had correctly said, was no theory of history. It was a personal philosophy, an attitude to life - but not a weapon, in time of need, against the barbarians. H ow inadequate Meinecke 's approach was at this juncture can best be gauged from the boorish attack on him in, of all places, his old HZ: "Capitalist bourgeois society has produced a capitalist bourgeois historiography," wrote the Nazi professor Walter Frank; ridiculing the "Hamlet-like pallor that hung over his declining culture," he asked jeeringly whether "Meinecke's patriotism is strong enough to abandon Western civilization in exchange for German hegemony in Europe."62 More subtle but no less severe, the Marxist historian Eckhart Kehr alluded to Meinecke's pet image - that he was inviting his readers to a Gratwanderung (mountain ridge climb, as he calls it in his preface to Historismus): "The superiority feeling of mountain climbers is highly developed in German intellectual historians .... They concern 62 HZ, Vol. 163(1941), p. 7.</page><page sequence="27">38 HENRY PACHTER themselves with things that have little practical significance. They shy away from ideas that have revolutionized the world. Democracy, socialism, bolshevism are taboo Even those who are republicans or democrats are conservative." Intellectual history, as seen by Kehr, is "a way out for the disoriented bourgeoisie; it gives them the temporary feeling of exaltation, of ranging on a high mountain."63 In going back to the "origins" of Historismus, Meinecke evaded precisely those problems into which Historismus had led, the "crisis" which Troeltsch and he had discussed ten years earlier. Having written a book about the "evil side of power [whose] excesses have been accepted all too lightly," having recognized that the core concept of Historismus, individuality, "might be used to justify the excesses of power politics,"64 he now limited the scope of his book so that he did not have to comment on the responsibility of Historismus for that which followed. Only in two passages65 does he digress for a dig at "the real-political snobism of some younger historians who think they have learnt from Bismarck how to overcome obstacles," and at "the biological-morphological manner of Kjellén" (whose geopolitics had become a Nazi ideology.) A third, no less serious criticism concerned an increasingly strident nationalism in Meinecke's style. He introduces Historismus as "the great German movement .... The German Geist . . . here accomplished its second great feat after the Reformation."66 Its coming, he had previously declared, was "the greatest revolution in thought which the West has experienced. The belief that had ruled so far in the absolute validity and uniformity of reason was now destroyed and replaced by the insight that reason manifests itself in a variety of forms .... This richer and more profound image of the world" was not simply a concern for professional historians but "a new vision of life."67 With a certain animosity he represents the older view, that of the Enlightenment and of rationalism, as "Western" or, more specifically, as "French," and instead of describing it as a manifestation of its Zeitgeist, again and again he sets it up as a target for the "German" intellectual uprising. Such a treatment not only flies in the face of all teachings of Historismus, it is also poor history. Germans were as much enthralled with the philosophy of the Enlightenment as Westerners, and Western 63 Eckhart Kehr, "Modern German Historians," reprinted in Essays in German History, ed.

To be sure, Meinecke gives due credit to Shaftesbury, Montesquieu, and above all to Edmund Burke; but Rousseau gets less than a page, Tocqueville is not mentioned at all, and when Meinecke has to admit - ever so grudgingly - Voltaire's immense merits for historiography, he has to add: "However, the irrational profundity of the soul was unknown to him."68 Montesquieu, likewise, gets a bad mark for ignoring "the incomprehensible." The nationalistic bias becomes ludicrous when Vico has to be included amorçg the insurgents. A Latin and a man of the Enlightenment, yet aware of irrational motives- how to get around this? We remember that the book appeared when Hitler and Mussolini were forming an axis; hence Meinecke can comment: "Germans and Italians have a greater ability than the French to overcome intellectualistic inhibitions and to think from the totality of the soul."69 The truth is that notions such as Zeitgeist, national spirit, genius, etc., had been formed in the 18th century and helped to bring history back from the reporting of "what really happened" to the art of creating a national myth. Historismus became an ideology. But this artistic, inspirational, and almost mythical conception of history now was declared to be the highest achievement of Geist ever, erected as the model which others must strive to emulate, or used as a yardstick by which other nations' cultures were to be measured.As an egregious monument to this exquisite culture, the book on Historismus seems to say to Germans of present and future generations as well as to observers abroad: Our present state may look ugly; our present rulers may be barbarians. But no one can take away our Kultur. A future Germany will be built on this Kultur, even though today it can exist only in the rarefied atmosphere of classical Bildung. For unfortunately, the conception oí Kultur which Meinecke offers in Historismus is drained of all sociological and political significance. It is personalist and humanist; it is contemplative rather than activist; it preserves an unpolitical sphere for the individual but it no longer places the individual into the stream of history. For all the rewarding insights and delightful speculations it offers, the book escapes into the realm of 68 Werke III, p. 94. 69 Ibid., p. 53. A fairer appreciation of the Enlightenment is found in the "Aphorisms" of 1942, where he notably recognizes the turn of the philosophes away from a static conception of human nature and towards evolution, towards the variety of appearances. In 1932 Ernst Cassirer, the neo-Kantian, had written a monograph on the Enlightenment, showing that it was not as a-historical as the German romantics had charged.</page><page sequence="29">40 HENRY PACHTER beautiful appearances, where Friedrich Schiller already had located the German freedom. It is an eloquent, often moving testament of a bygone period, but it seems to accept its own time with resignation. Meinecke seems to be hibernating, dreaming a beautiful dream. Gottfried Benn, the expressionist poet, in the post-war poem "Quartär," also compared the present age with "one of God's dreams", but only to point to its ephemeral nature: "a joke of the old spiderman". Nevertheless, and despite all these causes for criticism, in at least one respect The Origin of Historismus will serve Meinecke's reputation in the West. While in earlier writings he had rarely defended the individual against the state, here he is frankly individualistic. He also used the centenary of Treitschke, in 1934, to play his liberal individualism up against the nationalist state worshippers who also invoked his authority.70 This was not quite new for him. At the end of World War I, he had told an audience of army officers : "If we don't wish to impoverish ourselves, we must not allow one type of personality to disappear: the man whose horizon becomes wider as he confronts history, and who achieves the infinity of a spirituality that is both mild and strong in facing all that is human,"71 and in the essay on "Causalities and Values" he simply takes this for granted: "Next to the elevation of one's moral and spiritual personality, the greatest challenge to man's ethical capacity is the moralization and spiritualization of the state."72 Meinecke had never deified the state, like Hegel, and he had become critical of Ranke's attempt to see the state as God's work. But he had hoped to "spiritualize" and to "moralize" it - and failed. More and more he now saw "shadows" in the real world; the demonic had triumphed, and the spiritual had no choice but to retreat into that natural abode where humanism could be practiced in books. In realizing this retreat Meinecke failed to see that he was retreating from Historismus itself, which had been created precisely to reconcile the contemplative mood of the historian and scholar with the active life of the state. When Meinecke published the book, he knew that the days of Historismus were numbered. As Weltanschauung it looked backwards; as tool of political analysis it failed. Without a fight, the middle-class republic succumbed to Hitler because Liberalism had no idea that could have been opposed to him. Its raison d'état had floundered in Hindenburg's antichambre; its nationalism was swayed by Hitler's ability to outbid any demagogue. 70 HZ, 1934, p. 126. 71 "History and Personality" in Werke IV, p. 54. 72 "Causalities and Values," ibid., p. 87.</page><page sequence="30">Masters of Cultural History: Meinecke 41 Hitler's successes in foreign policy silenced all opposition. Who could condemn the Anschluss! The "liberation" of the Sudeten Germans, the destruction of Czechoslovakia, the victories in Poland, Norway, France placed liberals before an agonizing choice. Meinecke's letters of the war years - though nothing he published - betray a nationalist bias and little sensitivity to the crimes of German aggression. After Hitler's fall, Meinecke asked whether National Socialism did not perhaps have a place in history. After all, the two great movements of the nineteenth century tended to merge in its ideology: "individualizing nationalism and confederative socialism;" the idea was splendid, but Hitler had only used it as an ideology for his personal power drive. The state had run berserk; its evil side had been cut loose from Reason of State. Was this really all that needed to be said about Nazism? After the Second World War, when Meinecke felt called upon to give meaning to German history, Historismus was unable to provide guidance. The German catastrophe was also the catastrophe of German historiography. Meinecke had to recognize that he had failed to see how much evil there had been in Bismarck's state and, in fact, in all states. That the German state was as evil as all others was less painful to admit than that it had incurred more guilt than they. The question an honest historian now had to answer was whether Hitler was an aberration, an alien element - or a more or less genuine fruit of German history.73 Meinecke saw both the continuity and the disruption; he clearly stated: "The Third Reich was the greatest misfortune that the German people have suffered throughout their existence; it was also their greatest shame."74 Yet he repeats almost verbatim his profession of faith of forty years earlier: "Can anything that awakens a great nation be condemned as an inclination to go the wrong way?"75 Germany's way was not an Irrweg but an Unglücksweg- not a mistaken way but a way of sorrows. The German catastrophe had come about through a series of unfortunate accidents: Hindenburg's senility, the blindness of the military, the rapacity of the Junker caste, the mistaken romanticism of the youth movement; but in Meinecke's book there was no theory of Nazism. Hitler simply fell under the category of "evil." Increasingly in these last works, Meinecke used the language of mysticism into which he had lapsed on earlier occasions whenever he 73 Ernst Cassirer told me at the time of Stalingrad, when Hitler seemed to be winning: "Hitler cannot win this war: he does not belong in German history." Meinecke suffered because he saw Hitler shooting his way into German, and into European, history. 74 The German Catastrophe^ p. 86. 75 Werke IV, p. 206. See note 10 above.</page><page sequence="31">42 HENRY PACHTER was out of his depth. To save himself from the dilemma between causality and Geist, he leapt into the "vertical" dimension - a simile at best which explains nothing. This language is pervasive in the second half of Historismus and in the late essays. Whenever problems are intractable, we are referred to our intuition as a judge of last resort. Whenever we catch one of Meinecke's heroes - Ranke, Bismarck, Frederick the Great- on a contradiction, we are told to "divine" the solution. Whenever ethical problems threaten to require metaphysical coordinates, we are led to the slippery Urgrund, the primeval ground, of the soul. Although Meinecke was no churchgoer and believed in no personal God, religion was the soil from which his philosophy grew, and Christianity was the ground from which he criticized Hitler. If his conscience was the unerring guide of his judgments, this was possible because he was drawing on a stock of reverence that had been accumulated in German idealism for centuries. We can believe his assurance that by recognizing the fact of "value relativity" he did not mean to endorse relativistic ethics. But what he can justly claim for himself he cannot make binding for others- he has no message for an age which can no longer draw on that same reservoir of religious convictions. Moreover, we can see before our own eyes how contemplation increasingly takes the place of engagement in his writings : More and more he comes to recognize the overweening power of the anonymous forces and of necessity. What is left for the individual who wishes to assert his integrity, is to withdraw into Kultur (like the despised Voltaire to cultivate his garden, or like the ambiguous Machiavelli to read his beloved classics). At the end of The German Catastrophe, his advice to his compatriots is "to form Goethe circles." What he once76 said of Treitschke may apply to Meinecke himself: "In spite of his dangerous theory, he possessed a high sense of responsibility, for he was a deeply moral man." 76 Machiavellism, p. 408.</page></plain_text>
