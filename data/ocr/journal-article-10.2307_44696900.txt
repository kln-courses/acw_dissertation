<plain_text><page sequence="1">VIRGIL S PASTORAL PROGRAMME: THEOCRITUS, CALLIMACHUS AND ECLOGUE 1 This study has a limited aim.1 It is to expand as fully as possible one aspect of Eclogue 1. The aspect concerned covers Virgil's description of the nature of his pastoral poetry, its inspiration both by poetic predecessors and a living dedicatee, and the claims which he makes implicitly for his own poetic achievement in the volume to which this poem serves as introduction. Some of the points which I make have been picked up by others,2 but not, in my opinion, welded into a coherent reading of this entire aspect of the poem. I shall attempt to show that we have here a carefully composed preface to the book of Eclogues: ; that it establishes a programme of specifically Roman pastoral, derived from Theocritus, but with important critical allegiance to Callimachus; that this is achieved by placing at the centre of the poem a symbolic encounter of the poet with his 'divine' source of inspiration firmly in the tradition of Hesiod, Callimachus and many other poets (and prophets); that such a reading of the poem begets new and alternative interpretations of individual passages which help to confirm its validity; and that it is further confirmed by subsequent passages in Virgil himself and in other writers. In so doing I shall touch hardly or not at all upon the historical, political, social and legal questions which the poem raises and which have always been in the forefront of discussion of it. This is not because I consider them irrelevant to the overall interpretation of the poem. They are, in fact, crucial. I have, however, little that is new to say on these matters and to have pursued them would have deflected me from my task of trying to set the work firmly within its literary tradition and to expound its central literary content.3 I The poem is the first in the collection. My interpretation consists essentially of bringing out the implications of this self-evident fact. Yet, surprisingly, this procedure requries a preliminary apology. Some scholars4 hold that the poem was promoted to this position late in the day as an alternative to Eclogue 8. Lines 6-13 of that poem, they would argue, provide a dedication to Pollio appropriate to the whole work, a dedication which is apparently lacking in Eclogue 1 .5 There is no way of knowing the precise Timing or motivation of Virgil's decision to place Eclogue 1 first.6 Is it, however, conceivable that such a self-conscious artist would publish his</page><page sequence="2">108 JAMES R. G. WRIGHT first major work without a proper introduction, thus ignoring a practice observed by Catullus before him and by Horace, Tibullus, Propertius and Ovid after him?7 In fact Eclogue 1 conforms precisely to the pattern followed by these poets and is a fascinating example of the type, a type which Eclogue 8 closely resembles only in respect of the dedicatory lines 6-13. The opening word locates us in the world of Theocritean pastoral. Tityrus appears in Idyll 3 and, more significantly, in Idyll 7, a poem which is of central importance for Virgil's image of Theocritus.8 The name is chosen, however, for more than these associations. It enables Virgil to begin his collection with a deliberate echo of the first line of Idyll 1 : *A8ú xi to (piOúpiapa Kai á tiítuç, ai nóXe, Tīļva.9 The alliteration of t and assonance of / and u sounds common to both lines doubtless provided the crucial motivation for the choice of Tityrus. Whether it is more than a happy coincidence that the reed monaulos was known among the Italian Dorians as xixúpivoç I should not like to say.10 If one equates the avena or oaten pipe with the monaulos it certainly provides a characteristically learned conceit to have the shepherd playing his eponymous instrument. The reminiscence of Idyll 1 is, however, more than merely verbal. The opening lines of that poem embody an important Theocritean metaphor for bucolic poetry.11 Nature herself sings and the herdsman's song is inspired by and an image of that music - à8ù 8è Kal tú/ oupíaSeç (2-3). Virgil's poem opens with his version of this metaphor, but, as so often, he has inverted his Greek model. His herdsman sings and nature listens, learning, echoing or being affected in some other way by his song. The image of the response of nature to the herdsman's song and the placing of the singer in resonant places such as forests, rocks, and caves is repeated too often by Virgil to be without significance.12 He turns the Theocritean motif to his purpose by insisting on the primacy of the human singer. It is he who, unlike his Greek counterpart, is entitled to the main credit for bucolic song. This programmatic assertion of the poet's claim to his own work as opposed to the Greek attribution to a divinity is also found at the beginning of the Georgics and the Aeneid. Contrast the invocation to the Muses which opens the Works and Days or the appeal for assistance made to them by Aratus with Virgil's blunt hinc canere incipiam ("(7.1.5), or Mrjviv dEi8s, $sá and "AvSpa poi ěvveTie, Moöaa with arma virumque cano.u Thus in the Eclogues we are told at once of the Theocritean model but are expected to notice an important difference. Fully aroused by now to the programmatic purpose of the piece we observe that Tityrus is reclining in the shade of a tree. 14 He is thus enjoying two of the three basic ingredients of the traditional locus amoenus, rest and shade, emphasised by repetition: patulae recubans sub tegmine fagi, lentus in umbra. He lacks only cool running water nearby to complete his felicity. We might be right to infer the third ingredient from the presence of the first two, and such an inference would be</page><page sequence="3">VIRGIL'S PASTORAL PROGRAMME 109 reinforced by Meliboeus' words at 51-2. More important is Virgil's choice of tree. The significance of the fagus here has been discussed by G. W. Williams. He observes that the fagus appears rarely in Latin except in these poems. Virgil15 seems to have taken it over from Theocritus16 as the counterpart of the Greek cpriyóç17 (whichJ)otanically it is not) as a piece of characteristic bucolic scenery. 18 The (priyóç was, according to Nicander,19 especially associated with Pan, one of the main deities of bucolic poetry. His other favourite tree, the pine, appears singing at the beginning of Idyll 1 , shortly before a mention of Pan himself. The trees and the god are brought together by Propertius: fagus et Arcádio pinus arnica deo ( 1 . 1 8.20). All this gives us a glimpse into the kind of learned allusion that may be intended by the appearance of fagus here. It stands for the whole bucolic setting of the poems and recalls the tutelary deity who appears at the beginning of Theocritus' collection. It also deliberately varies as well as alluding to Theocritus. The fagus is the locus of Virgilian bucolic as the rcíxuç was the locus and model of Theocritean bucolic. The activities in which Tityrus is engaged, playing a musical instrument and singing, are what we would expect from his milieu ¡and such a poem. The actual words used are important in giving precision to the nature of the music concerned. It is silvestris , it belongs to the woods which provide one of the 'cadres sonores' which have already been referred to as providing the characteristic locale of Virgil's pastoral. Seven times the idea of woods is associated symbolically with bucolic song,20 in addition to the many passages where trees echo or respond to the singer in some other way. The alternative terms agrestis and rustica are used only twice and once respectively.21 A further reason for mentioning woods here may be the appearance of the pine at the beginning of Idyll 1 . The instrument concerned is the simplest of rustic pipes, but its epithet has overtones which both confirm and contradict its apparent simplicity. Tenui refers, of course, to the physical shape of the pipe. It also describes its high-pitched tone which (on the assumption that it is not very long) follows from that shape.22 More importantly it is a Latin equivalent of the terms Xctttóç and XenxaXLoç as used by Callimachus to characterise his own poetic ideals. The reference to Callimachus is made explicit in the introduction to Eclogue 6, but it would hardly be lost on the Roman reader here. The practising referred to in meditaris and the leisured ease of lentus are perhaps further indications of a stance alongside followers of the Alexandrian tradition such as Catullus which becomes clearer in Tityrus' reply to Meliboeus. The content of Tityrus' singing is also programmatic. Love is the most prominent topic of bucolic song in Theocritus and to an only slightly lesser extent in Virgil. Amaryllis is beautiful and a subject of song in both poets,24 and thus serves not only to introduce the love motif but to reinforce the Theocritean atmosphere. There is, however, a jarring note in this harmonious Theocritean world.25 None of his herdsmen had suffered expulsion from the bucolic paradise.26 That is exactly what Meliboeus is experiencing. His bitter fate is rhetorically emphasised both by its position between the two descriptions of Tityrus' felicity, pointed by the</page><page sequence="4">1 10 JAMES R. G. WRIGHT contrasted pronouns (tu ... nos ... nos ... tu), and by the emotional content of the words used (patriae fines, dulcia arva, patriam,fugimus). This catastrophe thrusts the reader at once into the real world of confiscations and enforced emigration. Although the precise situation is only gradually revealed and the give-away proper name Romam does not appear until 19, the Roman reader could hardly have been unaware of the contemporary or near-contemporary events to which allusion is made. The word patria itself introduces a concept which is alien to Theocritus' herdsmen but of immense significance for a Roman. We thus find contemporary Roman reality inserted literally into the midst of the bucolic world. The central position in the passage mirrors the central importance of reality in the Eclogues as a whole. In this poem song may almost hold its own against the external forces which threaten it, in others it will hardly do so: sed carmina tantum nostra valent, Lycida, tela inter Martia, quantum Chaonias dicunt aquila veniente columbas. (9.11-13) We at once realise that we are reading a new kind of pastoral poetry which looks beyond the limited horizon of the Theocritean singer and has its own original subject-matter. No Roman poetic programme would be complete that did not aim to go beyond mere imitation. The stark contrast between the fortunes of Tityrus and Meliboeus runs parallel to an opposition between them which has programmatic significance. The encounter between two rustics is a basic situation in pastoral poetry. A majority of the genuine bucolic poems of Theocritus involve such a meeting.27 Frequently there is a degree of rivalry or tension between the two. It may be openly expressed in a slanging match as in Idyll 5 and Eclogue 3 or more subtly conveyed by the barbed civilities of an Idyll 1 or an Eclogue 5. This tension is often reinforced by giving the characters the traditionally opposing rôles of shepherd and goatherd. Such a pair appear in Idyll 1. There they are in harmony with each other but the reader's natural expectation of rivalry is surely alluded to in the goatherd's disclaimer kouti tu K£pTO|ié(o (62). Tityrus and Meliboeus may conform to Italian reality in being smallholders (3, 9, 45, 56-7, 69-73) but they also represent the archetypal opposition. Tityrus is a shepherd (8, 21) and Meliboeus a goatherd (12, 74-8).28 There is no open argument or breach between them, but there is a certain tension in Meliboeus' attitudes and an indifference in Tityrus' which I find it easiest to explain in terms of this opposition. Thus the basic situation in the narrative is reinforced by the contrasting occupations of the two men and this also gives scope for the kind of q$o7ioiia which is often a feature of ancient pastoral poetry.29 The harmonious beauty of the language of the first five lines does not disguise the resentment felt by Meliboeus at the good fortune of Tityrus, which contrasts so markedly with his own situation. The forceful rhetoric of the repeated pronouns</page><page sequence="5">VIRGIL'S PASTORAL PROGRAMME I 1 1 and patria sees to that. The reply which he receives is hardly calculated to still that resentment. It is no comfort for a man who feels as Meliboeus clearly does to know that a deus has intervened on behalf of someone else. The point is again emphasised by the choice and positioning of pronominal words, this time referring exclusively to Tityrus (/706/s... mihi ... nostris... meas... ipsum). Meliboeus' denial of envy (1 1) seems designed on the psychological level both to conceal from himself his manifest feelings of envy and to deprive Tityrus of the satisfaction of being envied. His astonishment ( miror 30 magis) may be as much a devaluation of Tityrus' felicity as admiration of it. The natural reaction to Tityrus' speech would surely have been to enquire the name of the god and the circumstances of his beneficence. But Meliboeus makes Tityrus listen to a further recital of his woes before yielding to his curiosity and asking the question (18). The answer which he receives at first looks like no answer at all. An encomium of Rome has a programmatic point in removing us forcibly and decisively from the Theocritean world but it is not an adequate response to Meliboeus. Tityrus has no intention of throwing away his advantage in the dialogue by premature disclosure of the full facts. Meliboeus cannot contain his curiosity and asks the reason for the trip to Rome without any further mention of his own problems. The answer (libertas, 27)31 is not one which anything in the poem up to this point would have led us to expect. Tityrus goes on to expand upon this simple answer with a lengthy piece of autobiography the significance of which I shall discuss later. Meliboeus interrupts him in a wholly inconsequential way by reverting to the sadness which Tityrus' absence had caused in the bucolic world. This is clearly seen as a criticism of his absence by Tityrus, who instantly reacts with a defensive self-justification (40-1 ). Then, in a passage of great importance, he once more emphasises both the generosity of the god who has favoured him and his eternal gratitude. The makarismos of Tityrus with which Meliboeus responds is not without its sting. It is difficult to say whether in ergo tua rura manebunt (46) emphasis should be placed upon tua thus bringing out once more an implied contrast with Meliboeus. There can surely be no doubt, however, about the devaluation intended in et tibi magna satis , etc. (47-8). A modicum of land may be an appropriate and acceptable aspiration to express on one's own behalf,32 but on the lips of Meliboeus it cannot escape a hint of envious disparagement. Tityrus' response to this picture of his own felicity is a further expression of his eternal gratitude to the god concluding with a shatteringly tactless allusion to the theme of exile which displays a total insensitivity to Meliboeus' position. He at once replies, picking up Tityrus' nostro (63) - and perhaps his own tua (46) - with the strongly adversative at nos (64). Their fate will be perilously close to the exchange of territories which was the final element in Tityrus' adynaton. His tale of woe is a stark contrast to the makarismos , and the unbridgeable gap between the two figures is finally emphasised by his explicit denial of any future participation in the two basic pastoral activities which Tityrus enjoys at the opening of the poem, singing and herding:</page><page sequence="6">112 JAMES R. G. WRIGHT carmina nulla canam; non me pascente, capellae, florentem cytisum et salices carpetis amaras. (77-8) In one sense the poem is complete at this point. We have come full circle from the secure ease of the poet herdsman Tityrus to the careworn exile of Meliboeus who is cut off from song and his animals. But it is characteristic of the Virgilian pastoral to end on a serene and peaceful note, often symbolised by the coming of evening which contrasts with the heat and turmoil of the day.33 Tityrus' offer of hospitality for the night achieves this effect here, but only by a kind of poetic sleight-of-hand. The programmatically rustic feast of apples, chestnuts and milk together with a night's lodging can be no real compensation for the loss which Meliboeus is suffering. The word tarnen (79) is a cheat. Nothing will have changed in the morning and Tityrus' belated kindness is only a measure of the gulf which separates him from an understanding of the true plight of Meliboeus. The opening five lines thus constitute a clear delineation of the programme of a Roman poet writing in an Alexandrian tradition. His form is Theocritean and he uses the jargon of Callimachean poetics coupled with the older symbolism of shade and leisured ease. Objection may be made at this point to my apparently facile assumption that all this applies to Virgil, whereas, in the actual text, the greater part of it is predicated not of Virgil but of Tityrus; and Tityrus is an old, manumitted peasant, while Virgil is a young, free literary man. Such an objection seems to me to involve a profound misconception of the nature of the Eclogues. They are deliberately riddling and mystificatory.34 Poised between the harsh realities of contemporary life and the magical bliss of their pastoral world they never afford the reader a comfortable and secure grasp on a hard actuality. The names especially are shuffled about so that we can never say one bucolic character equals one real person. To take only one example, if we are to believe E. 5.85-7 Eclogues 2 and 3 were written by one Menalcas. Yet there is nothing in these poems which would have led us to believe that Virgil was not claiming them for his own. So is Menalcas Virgil? In this passage perhaps, but what of E. 6.4 where Apollo addresses Virgil as Tityrus? I am satisfied by the answer long ago set down in the Servian commentary on E. 1.1 : et hoc loco Tityri sub persona Vergiliům debemus accipere; non tarnen ubique, sed tantum ubi exigit ratio. A more modem critic might say that Tityrus here represents the Virgilian poetic 'persona' or 'voice', and can do this without having to conform in any important ways to the physical or other non-literary attributes of the real Virgil. Tityrus is Virgil in respect of poetic aims and inspiration, that is at the level of the poem which involves literary symbolism. He is not Virgil in respect of his non-literary attributes, that is at the level of the poem which treats of an apparently real-life saga about countrymen and their land.35 A further kind of confirmation of the programmatic nature of the opening lines is available. The end of the collection is equally a place to look for explicit or implicit</page><page sequence="7">VIRGIL'S PASTORAL PROGRAMME 113 indications of the poet's intentions.36 Eclogue 10 is the concluding poem, as we are told in its first line. If we examine the last eight lines of this poem we find that they consist of an overtly programmatic utterance which is carefully contrived to respond conceptually to the opening of the whole work. Of course, Virgil is now at the end both of this poem and of the whole collection (the words apply equally to both), so that there are important differences in what is said, but the imagery and the poetic idiom are the same. Thus the Piérides may be safely introduced as the poet's patrons and emphasis must be laid not on the continued singing of a Tityrus but on the appropriate limitation of size in a poem or work of this kind.37 Sat erit (70) responds to pauca carmina (2-3) at the beginning of the poem. It is an expression which puts literally what is symbolically stated in the last line where we find saturae ... capellae (77) making a neat ring of this paragraph. There is a reference, too, to the words of the bucolic deity Pan earlier in the poem (28-30) where he advocates moderation in love-sickness. Again, the term had been used earlier in the words sat prata biberunt which conclude Eclogue 3. All this is indicative of the limited scale which was thought correct for these Alexandrian- style bucolic poems. The specific correspondences with E. 1.1-5 are very striking. Tityrus was lying down ( recubans ), Virgil has been seated {sedei). Tityrus was playing upon a slender straw ( tenui ... auena ), Virgil has been weaving a basket from slender twigs {gracili hibisco ).38 Both are symbolic of the Callimachean Xettcóttiç of the poetry, which has nonetheless in Eclogue 10 aspirations to greatness: vos haec facietis maxima Gallo (72).39 The two singers are in the shade, but its significance is different in each case. For Tityrus it is a pleasant protection from the heat, beneficial and symbolic of the bucolic paradise. For Virgil it is the shade of evening, a sinister and potentially harmful shade for singers and the crops which are their poems. In other words, too much pastoral poetry will not be good for a poet who has higher aspirations; enough is enough. Thus the poet must rise from the characteristic bucolic position on the ground to lead home his goats (i.e. his bucolic poems) for the last time. It may also be time to take himself to higher things. Surgamus (75) could belong with expressions of poetic aspiration such as: temptanda uia est qua me quoque possimi tollere humo... (Virg. G. 3.8-9) and: sublimi feriam sidera uertice (Hor. Carm. 1.1.36). The whole collection, then, is framed between these two programmatic utterances, between the heat of the day and the cool of the evening, between aspiration and achievement. To these observations we may add the Callimachean references to slenderness at 5.85 {fragili cicuta) and 6.4-5 {deductum carmen as opposed to pinguis ... oves). I shall argue later that my interpretation reinforces a view of the collection as split into two halves (among several other patterns of arrangement). For the moment it is enough to note the programmatic emphasis on scale at the beginning and end of each half.</page><page sequence="8">1 14 JAMES R. G. WRIGHT II The story that Tityrus has to tell is equally filled with literary import. He owes the oda which he is enjoying to a deus (6). This god had granted permission for two things to happen: 1 ) meas errare boves (9), his cattle were to graze as they wished; 2) ipsum ludere quae vellem calamo ... agresd (9-10), he himself could play as he pleased on his rustic pipe. The word agresd confirms the pastoral nature of Tityrus' poetry. Its neoteric tone is equally guaranteed by the words oda and ludere. The terms are used with the same implications, for instance, in the lines: Hesterno, Licini, die odosi/ multum lusimus in meis tabellis (Catul. 50.1-2).40 Moreover, it emerges that this first account of the god's beneficence is an interpretation in indirect speech of the actual words spoken by the god to Tityrus when he had gone on a journey to Rome. The direct speech is more enigmatic, but has presumably the same significance: pascite ut ante boves, pueri, submittite tauros. (45) At first sight the god's response to Tityrus is full of oddities. After what Meliboeus says at the opening of the poem it would be natural to assume that there would be some explanation of Tityrus' retention of his land, and, in general, the god's words provide this. But why does this get linked with permission to compose pastoral poetry and why is it otherwise expressed solely in terms of cattle and their care? As we have seen, Tityrus is a shepherd and a smallholder. He is also, we must assume, a recently manumitted slave (27-32). Where, then, do the cattle come from? Could he afford them? Are they in any way consistent with anything else that we know about him? Observe, moreover, that cattle are nowhere specifically apart of the bucolic scene in this poem except in the response of the god. Is there any significance in the linking of cattle-grazing and bucolic singing in the first report? Why does the god address Tityrus in the plural? In my view all these and several other problems can be solved by recognising that, while on the socio-legal level the god may be a political figure with the power of manumission and restitution of land, his appearance in this poem and his apparent obsession with cattle have a more important meaning. He is a god of poetry, of bucolic in particular, who does for Tityrus-Virgil what the Muses did for Hesiod, Apollo for Callimachus, and the Nymphs for Simichidas. In other words, the encounter with the god in Rome is based upon the scene of the poet's initiation and instruction, the literary tradition of which was originated by Hesiod and taken up and made canonical by Callimachus to such an extent that Wendell Clausen has correctly remarked that 'references to Hesiod in Virgil and Propertius are really references to Callimachus or his conception of Hesiod'.41 The remainder of this section of the paper will be an attempt to substantiate this claim. 1 begin by drawing attention to the well-established convention in ancient literature of describing the author as doing that about which he writes.42 This can</page><page sequence="9">VIRGIL'S PASTORAL PROGRAMME 1 15 appear in a specialised form in programme poems. There the author describes a style of life which he already leads or to which he aspires and this style of life is symbolic of his poetry. Striking examples will be found in Horace Odes 1.1 and Tibullus 1 . 1 and 10. Applying this doctrine to Eclogue 1 we see that the agricultural pursuits permitted to or enjoined upon Tityrus are one and the same thing as his permission to play bucolic music. Looking after cows is the same thing as being a pastoral poet. Thus, on the literary level, the god's instructions are all about the kind of poetry which Tityrus-Virgil composes. In general terms this would be sufficient to sustain my view, but a more detailed examination of the passages will both deepen and strengthen the case as well as providing an interesting example of the complexities of Virgilian composition. Consider first the opening of Idyll 9, which Virgil doubtless considered to be by Theocritus, although this view is not shared by modern scholars: Boukoâ.kxÇso, Aá(pvi- xi) 8' (ò8&lt;xç äpxeo rcpâxoç, còSãç ápxeo, Aá(pvi, 8&lt;p£i|/áa0cú 8è MeváXicaç, jióa/oę ßouaiv íxpévxeç, èrci axeípaiai 8è xaúpwç. Xoi jièv âpçl póaKOivio Kaì èv (púÂAoiai nXavûvzo pqSèv àxipayekeõvxeç- èpiv 8è xò PouKoXiáÇeo 8K XÓ08V, ãXXoQz 8' aoxiç ÒTcoKpívoixo Mevo&amp;Kaç. Both accounts of what the god said to Tityrus contain verbal reminiscences of these lines. Errare boves (9) echoes xoi pèv ... nXavœvro. Pascite ut ante boves, pueri , submittite tauros (45) is closely modelled on line 3 of the [Theocritus] passage, but in a quirky way which is characteristic of Virgil. The putting of the calves beneath the cows (i.e. to be suckled)43 in [Theocritus] suggests the feeding of cattle which occupies the first half of the god's instructions - pascite boves. The second half of the Greek line as I have printed it - ènl (i.e. è(pévxeç) axeí patat 8è xaúpcoç - refers to the putting of the bulls with the uncalved (not 'barren' pace Gow adloc.l) heifers to service them. The better attested reading ímó for èrcí makes no sense 'for obvious reasons' as Gow delicately observes. It can be explained as a simple case of assimilation of the preposition to that which is the prefix of the previously expressed verb. But Virgil's submittite tauros calques a text which has ímó. Either, then, Virgil's text had vnó or he misremembered the passage in that form. In either case he cannot have been thinking very acutely about the meaning. For his submittite does not have any sexual connotation. It means 'nurture' or 'rear' both here and at G. 3.73, 1 59 and elsewhere.44 It is not until the 3rd century and later that we find it used with a female object and male indirect object in a sexual sense. The Latin, then, is an exact verbal image of the Greek but the sense is different. What Virgil has done is provide a less extreme example of the kind of 'translation' which produced the notorious omnia vel medium fiat mare (E. 8.58) = rtdvxa 8'avaM.a yévoixo (Theoc. 1 . 1 34).45 As far as the Latin alone is concerned, it emerges that the two instructions issued by the god amount to one and the same thing - 'feed your</page><page sequence="10">116 JAMES R. G. WRIGHT cattle', i.e. 'be a pastoral poet' - with a typically Virgilian theme and variation. Whatever the details of the imitation Virgil seems to me to have had a good reason for choosing this passage as the source for the god's instructions. I suggest that he saw this as a clearly programmatic utterance expressing the essential identity of the activities of cowherding and bucolic singing. Theocritus' own coinage for the activity of pastoral singing, derived from the words for looking after cattle, frames the speech and on each occasion is accompanied by a reference to the amoebaean form of bucolic. Within the frame are mentioned the three basic responsibilities of herdsmen qua herdsmen - feeding, organising mating, and seeing that the animals do not stray. There is thus a close association established between the agricultural and poetic activities of the Podkó^oç. In real life they are two sides of the same coin and the same may be true in this passage. But for Virgil, whose bucolic world is essentially a poetic one, the two are assimilated and become interchangeable. The god's instructions cover herding and poetry simultaneously and in the same words. In addition to poetic imitation a further resource of contemporary poetic technique can be invoked to strengthen the case. Etymologising had been a feature of ancient poetry from the time of Homer, but it suited especially the display of learning aimed at by a Hellenistic poet. The Romans, moreover, could employ bilingual etymologies and they are a favourite device of the Roman followers of Callimachus, both Catullus and the Augustans. I consider first pascite boves = 'pasture' or 'feed your cattle'. Now Athenaeus explains the etymology of the word (íooKÓkoç in the following way: kóXov yàp f' xpo(pi^, ödev Kai ó ßoi)K0ko&lt;; (6.262a).46 If Athenaeus thought that a ßoi)K0Xo&lt;; was a man who nourished or fed cattle, he must have assumed that the original meaning of ßouKoXslv was 'feed cattle' and of ßooKoXslaöai 'be fed' or 'graze' of cattle. If Virgil shared these views pascite boves would constitute an etymologising translation of ßooKoXeixe. What about the other formulation, errare boves ? The Servian commentary ad loc . glosses errare as pasci citing mille meae Siculis errant in montibus agnae (Virg. E. 2.21). This is probably going too far if it is meant to suggest that the words are synonymous. Errare has, for instance, its full sense of 'wandering' in the phrase errons bucula campo at Virg. G. 4. 1 1 . Yet where it is used of the normal activity of domestic animals in the fields it must come close to the sense of 'pasturing'. Moreover, in the very passage from Idyll 9 on which Virgil is drawing the feeding and wandering are parts of one pattern of activity for the cattle. With that passage in mind Virgil may well have intended errare in 1.9 to convey the general sense which would in English be expressed by 'graze'. If this were so, errare boves would bear the same relation to ßoi)Koksia&amp;ai in a supposed original meaning of 'feed' as pascite boves does to ßooKoXeixe.47 The argument can, however, be carried further. Theocritus had coined the term ßouKo^id^eaöai for the singing of the herdsman.48 By so doing he formed an inseparable connection between pastoral song and the person and activities of the cowherd. I would suggest that it is this verb as much as the simple unsuffixed ßoi)KoXsiv/-eiaöai which Virgil is translating and</page><page sequence="11">VIRGIL'S PASTORAL PROGRAMME 1 17 etymologising. If this were true, lines 9-10 could be read both as denoting two different permissions and as denoting a single thing, namely permission to write bucolic poetry (theme and variation again). The two versions of the god's response would then embody reduplicated instructions on composing pastoral poetry as well as grazing-permits. If the god's instructions are about poetry to what extent does the encounter conform to the literary pattern of the poet's initiation?49 Four passages of Greek poetry are particularly relevant: A.

I shall also refer in what follows to the miraculous experiences of Archilochus50 and Epimênides.51 In doing so, I do not imply any view as to whether Virgil was acquainted with these stories or not. They are included simply to assist in establishing the recurrent motifs of the divine encounter which would have been familiar to the ancients. The only passages with which I assume Virgil was specifically familiar are those in Hesiod, Callimachus and Theocritus. At a later stage I shall introduce the case of Branchus, particularly as related in Callimachus.52 I isolate six elements of significance for the present purpose. 1 . The poet encounters a deity or deities who have associations with poetic/ prophetic inspiration (A, B, C, D, S EG. 37 Vorsokr. I p. 32.19-21). 2. The encounter occurs at a place which has a particular connection with the deities (A, C, D). 3. Reference is made directly (A, C, D, SEG. 25 Vorsokr. I p. 27.23-28.5, cf. 31.19-27) or indirectly (B) to the poet's rustic occupation. 4. The poet is addressed in the vocative (A, B, Vorsokr. I p. 32. 1?); note especially the plural in A and Vorsokr. I. 5. The deities give instructions implicit (A, SEG. 34-8) or explicit (B, D) concerning the work which the poet is to compose.</page><page sequence="12">1 18 JAMES R. G. WRIGHT 6. A word for 4firsť is used at some point (A, B). We find every one of these elements in Eclogue 1. 1 . Tityrus, for reasons which I shall discuss below, does not name the deity whom he encountered, but leaves us in no doubt that it was a god. An unidentified deity can hardly have any immediately discernible associations with poetic inspiration, but I hope to show that this condition, too, is met. 2. The programmatic significance of the introduction of Rome has already been mentioned. As will emerge, it is a highly appropriate place for the deity in question. 3. The whole poem, and in particular the response of the god, emphasises that Tityrus is a rustic. The anomalous change of emphasis from being a shepherd to being a cowherd is, of course, due to the Theocritean identification of pastoral singing with herding cows which has already been discussed. 4. Pueri (45) supplies this element and the apparently irrational plural finds its explanation in Hesiod.53 5. The indirect report of the encounter (9-10) definitely includes at least permission to play the pipe and I have argued that both reports contain instructions to produce pastoral poetry. 6. Primus (44) corresponds, at least as part of its raison d'être , to Kpioxiaia in Hesiod and npcóiioTov in Callimachus. I shall discuss its significance further below. For the moment it is sufficient to observe that the correspondences between the uses of the word for 'first' in the three passages are 'irrational'. The word is the same but the action or agent to which it refers is different in each passage. In Hesiod it draws attention to the Muses' opening remarks, which are of special interest. It is purely an indication that he is giving their first words, and not just any part of what they said. In Callimachus the sense is still chronological, referring to the beginning of the poet's literary endeavour. In a typically Hellenistic piece of variado the word is repeated from the model but applied to an action of the other party. In Virgil it returns again to the action of the god but has substantially more significance. The encounter, then, belongs firmly in the tradition of Hesiod and Callimachus. Who is the god? He is Octavian. I forbear to rehearse the standard arguments which would convince no-one who did not already believe them.54 I wish, however, to advance further arguments, based mainly upon the literary conventions in which I am setting the poem, which confirm and increase the significance of this view. I shall be claiming that the god is Octavian but that in several respects we are to think of him as Apollo and it will be convenient to consider the two claims together. It is commonplace to observe that the line which gives the vital clue for identification - iuvenem - is the forty-second of eight-three lines and thus the precise arithmetical centre of the poem. The word is even central in the line;</page><page sequence="13">VIRGIL'S PASTORAL PROGRAMME 1 19 preceded and followed by two-and-a-half feet. One does not have to share the worst excesses of the numerologists of the Eclogues to see the significance of this position. Its importance in the Odes of Horace, including its use for references to Augustus, has been securely established.55 Equally, the important self-announcement of Aeneas which identifies him both as the Roman Odysseus and the bearer of the penatis which will become those of the Roman state comes in the arithmetically central pair of lines in Aeneid 1. If, as I shall argue, we are to think of the god as Apollo, it is apposite to consider the proem of Theognis where he promises to forget Apollo neither at the beginning nor the end of his work and goes on (1.3-4): àW' alei Tcpôxóv te Ka! uaxaxov ev xe pcaoiaiv àEÍOO). The same formula is used by Theocritus at the beginning of his encomium of Ptolemy (17.3-4): &lt;xv8pd)v 8' au flxo^spaloç èv! rcpcoxoiai XcyéaOG) Kai 7rú|iaxoç Ka! péoaoç- ö yàp 7ipo(p£p£oxaxoç àvSpcov. These are doubtless simply variants on the more common polar expression 'first and last'56 and have no more arithmetical precision than our 'beginning, middle and end'. They mean 'throughout* and emphasise the importance attached to the person referred to. But Virgil is capable of taking the point more literally than that. What he does in Eclogue 1 is to omit any explicit reference to these formulae but leave a clue for the reader by placing the god/ patron whose praises he is singing literally in the middle of his poem. Octavian will appear again in medio in a Virgilian poem. That is his position in the marble temple which Virgil promises to construct at Georgics , 3. 10-39.57 The immediate reference is, of course, to the placing of the cult- statue in a temple. But this is not a literal temple; it is a Pindaric-Callimachean temple of song, which eventually emerges in the shape of the Aeneid. The central position given to Caesar symbolises his central position in the poem which Virgil projects and serves the same encomiastic purpose as the arithmetically central position here. Apollo is the presiding deity of the Eclogues. He easily outdoes minor deities such as Pan, the Nymphs or the Muses in number and importance of references. He is the supreme singer with whom it is absurd to compete (5.9) or to be second to whom is the ultimate praise (7.22), master of the Muses (6.66), father of Linus and source of his poetic powers (4.57), the touchstone of poetic excellence (6.1 1,73), a match perhaps for Jupiter himself (3.60-3). Above all, he appears as the inspiring deity in V irgil's explicit version of the divine encounter (6.1-12) and even turns out to have been the original source of the song of Silenus which is such an important and conscious manifestation of Virgil's poetic craftsmanship (6.82).58 In another poem which is also all about poetry, elegiac and pastoral, the words of Apollo to Gallus imply by allusion to the propempticon for Lycoris that he is the inspirer of</page><page sequence="14">120 JAMES R. G. WRIGHT the elegist (10.21-3). It would therefore be thoroughly in place for him to play a part in Eclogue 1 and would be in line with the Callimachean version of the divine encounter. Youth, too, is an appropriate characteristic for Apollo, but the word iuvenis is intended to make us think of Octavian. Is it not, however, going too far to identify him with Apollo? The pliant flattery of a Statius may invoke a mortal to inspire his work as a superior alternative to Apollo or the Muses,59 but surely not Virgil. Yet we have already seen Octavian cast as a deity in the proem to Georgics 3 and he appears as a thirteenth god of agriculture at Georgics , 1 .24-42. Octavian had, moreover, probably already begun to exploit for propaganda purposes his links with Apollo,60 the ancestral god of the Julii. It was even said that he had appeared in public dressed as the god.61 The compliment is, too, only a delicate hint, not the blunt sycophancy of Statius. The identification receives further support from the connections which I shall explore later between this poem and Eclogue 6 and between both of them and Idyll 7. I return to the word primus (44). 62 Du Quesnay has explained it as a topos of the eucharistikon in terms of which he has made an interesting analysis of Tityrus' part of the poem.63 1 am sure that this is correct. I am equally sure that it is only part of the story. It should hardly surprise us in such a poet to find a key word referring to more than one set of ideas. Priority in the literary and intellectual area had become a very important concept in Rome particularly in relation to the adaptation and naturalisation of Greek forms.64 Lucretius applies it to Ennius and himself in the poetic field and to Epicurus in the philosophical.65 It is worth noting that one of these passages {deus ille fuit , deus, inclute Memmi,/ qui princeps vitae rationem invenit [Lucr. 5.8-9]) is imitated in Tityrus' first reference to the god {deus nobis haec otia fecit;/ namque erit ille mihi semper deus, illius aram .... 6-7). Catullus, Horace, Propertius and Manilius make similar claims for their own work, as Horace does for Lucilius.66 Four times in the Georgics Virgil does the same.67 Eclogue 6 makes the point explicitly in its first two lines: Prima Syracosio dignata est ludere ver su /nostra ñeque erubuit silvas habitare Thalia. There is a deliberate ambiguity here. The lines tell us that Virgil's first poetry was bucolic, but they also assert that his Muse was the first to produce bucolic poetry {sc. at Rome). The emphatic position of prima demands that this predicative usage should not be ignored. There is also an ambiguity about the reference in Eclogue 1. As the conventions of the gratiarum actio require, the priority is predicated of the benefactor in respect of his benefaction and intensifies the expression of gratitude. But if we associate primus with the conventional literary narration of the divine encounter, we may offer within the tradition an alternative explanation of its transfer from poet to inspirer. Given the well-established existence of the priority topos the equally well-established Hellenistic technique of variatio could be applied to it. Just as his Thalia is the first Muse of Latin pastoral poetry {ergo Virgil is the first Latin pastoral poet) so the iuvenis is the first to utter such instructions not merely to Tityrus, but in general, so that Tityrus who is the addressee is the first</page><page sequence="15">VIRGIL'S PASTORAL PROGRAMME 121 person to be in a position to follow them. The sources of inspiration of Lucretius (Ennius and Epicurus) had both, as we have seen, been invested with the character of innovators. While Lucretius can lay claim to his own innovation as a combiner of Epicurean philosophy with Ennian poetry it would have been the less remarkable had his models not also had this attribute. The topos can, then, move freely between inspirer and inspired. What is more we have a perfect parallel for the transfer which I posit in h.Ven. 12-3: 7cpcÓTT| TÉKTOvaç av8paç èiuxOovíouç èSíSaÇs Koifļaai aaiívaç Kai äppata icoiKÍXa xa^K&lt;p. What is at issue here is not that Athena taught men these skills before anyone else, but that she taught the first men who acquired them.68 Similarly the crucial point in Virgil is not that Octavian responded before anyone else, but that Tityrus was the first to receive such orders and thus be in a position to carry them out. This is, of course, illogical. We are not, however, dealing with a philosophical argument but with an exercise in literary symbolism where certain words have values that are not necessarily derived only from their immediate context but come from their use in previous examples of the type. That Virgil saw himself as innovating in the Eclogues is confirmed by the words with which he concludes the Georgics : ilio Vergiliům me tempore dulcis alebat Parthenope studiis florentem ignobilis oti, carmina qui lusi pastorům audaxque iuventa, Tityre, te patulae cecini sub tegmine fagi. (G. 4.563-6) The first two lines refer to the Georgics but the catchword oti could apply equally to the Eclogues , as we have seen, and has its appropriate partner in lusi. Ignobilis is, of course, mock modest. Boldness is doubtless a common attribute of youth, but the words audax and audacia have a special sense of the daring required to make a new departure in literature. Ennius appears to use it of himself as opposed to his predecessors, Lucretius applies it to Epicurus, Catullus to Nepos, Virgil to himself more than once elsewhere in the Georgics , Horace to Lucilius and Propertius to his new undertaking of Augustus' wars.69 So Virgil himself specifically tells us that Eclogue 1 was a poetic innovation. The poem itself contains the word primus in a prominent position in the poet's initiation. Is it reasonable to deny its programmatic significance? I conclude this section by giving further consideration to the reasons for Octavian's appearance in this poem. It has been observed that this introductory poem lacks a dedicatee, 4a circumstance unique in contemporary literature',70 and this fact is largely responsible for the view, to which I have already referred, that Eclogue 8 was the original opening poem. I do not think that this is a lack which would have been felt by Virgil's audience. We must remember a simple fact. For</page><page sequence="16">122 JAMES R. G. WRIGHT sound programmatic reasons the poem is a dialogue. The author does not speak propria voce. He cannot address anyone without breaking the dramatic illusion. His only way of introducing a dedicatee is to have one of his characters talk about him.71 This leaves only one candidate, the young god. He is praised in extravagant terms and he is depicted as being the divine patron who instructs the poet what to compose. He is a person of great importance in the real Roman world who was to play or already played a decisive part in VirgiFs poetic patronage. Is the absence of a vocative mouthed by Virgil sufficient to negate the effect of all this? Why should the Eclogues be dedicated to Octavian, even in this non-explicit way? Both Virgil and Gallus, who plays such a prominent part in the book, had enjoyed the favour of C. Asinius Pollio, consul of 40 B.C. His literary patronage is saluted in Eclogue 3 and his political and military importance in Eclogues 4 and (possibly) 8. Despite an adherence to Antony he survived to a ripe old age and it cannot simply have been through fear of Octavian's displeasure that Virgil did not dedicate the work to Pollio. In that case a complete damnatio memoriae would have been required. It was doubtless while Pollio was absent governing Macedonia that the first contacts occurred between Virgil and Maecenas who was to become his established patron, acting, of course, on behalf of one greater than himself. Once that relationship existed Octavian naturally became the strongest candidate to receive the dedication. There are, however, two circumstances which may help to explain why Virgil was not more explicit. The bucolic poems of Theocritus (unlike some of the others) do not address themselves to patrons actual or potential. Friends such as Aratus (6) and Nicias (11) appear, but not a Hieron or a Ptolemy. The only allusion detectable to a ruler is a covert one (7.91-3): eAi)KÍ8a (píXs, noXXà pèv ãXXa Nóp&lt;pai Ki^ps 8í8aí;av àv* copsa ßouKo^sovxa èaOXd, xá rcoi) Kai Zqvòç ski Opóvov äyaye (papa. The Zeus whose throne has been reached by Simichidas' fine songs is doubtless Ptolemy Philadelphus, but the recognition of patronage, if that is what it is, is extremely oblique. Virgil may therefore have felt that it would be a violation of the bucolic convention to make an explicit dedication to a patron. It is noteworthy that in the apparently dedicatory passage at E. 8.6-13 no name is given and one is left to deduce who is meant. Secondly, there appears to have been some hesitation about dedicating works directly to Octavian/ Augustus. We may note that each book of the Georgics is carefully dedicated to Maecenas by direct address (1.2, 2.41, 3.41, 4.2) but that his master is not absent (1.25, 503, 2.170, 3.16, 47-8, 4.560) and, indeed, overshadows the formal dedicatee, appearing in the proems to Books 1 and 3 in the guise of a god. Horace provides a striking parallel. The collection consisting of Odes 1-3 is dedicated to Maecenas openly by its first poem, but its second is a highly complex and oblique work which builds up to a climactic vocative * Caesar* in its very last word, equates Octavian with a god, applies the word iuvenem to his</page><page sequence="17">VIRGIL'S PASTORAL PROGRAMME 123 appearance, and draws heavily upon the techniques and ideas which Virgil had used in connection with him in Georgics l.72 Few can doubt that here again the encomium of Caesar far outstrips the honour done to Maecenas by the dedication, but the important points for our purpose are the fact that it is not a formal dedication and that the approach to the subject of the encomium is oblique. Such a form of dedication of these pastorals can thus be seen to avoid to a considerable extent the breaking of Theocritean canons and to adhere to a type of approach to Octavian which was later favoured by Virgil and by Horace following him. Perhaps, too, this very obliqueness recommended itself to Virgil as being in tune with the riddling and mystificatory atmosphere of his pastoral world. Ill An obvious objection to my analysis of the encounter with the god as a poetic initiation in the tradition of Hesiod and Callimachus is that there is a full-scale imitation of the Aitia prologue at the beginning of Eclogue 6. 73 Why should Virgil choose to allude to that famous passage more than once, and especially in such an obscure way? The answer will, I hope, further illuminate the programmatic nature of the poem and its relation to certain other poems in the collection. It should not surprise us that an introductory poem not only indicates in general what kind of poetry is going to follow but also makes anticipatory allusions to specific passages in the later poems. This is, for instance, a feature of Horace, Odes 1 . 1 which is well described in this respect by Eduard Fraenkel as an 'overture' to the three books.74 1 give here a list of what seem to me to be some undoubted references forward arranged in the order of the passages alluded to. There is no intention to be exhaustive; I aim only at presenting enough evidence to suggest that this is a deliberate policy on the part of the poet: E. 2: 1.52 ....frigus captabis opacum 2.8 ....umbras et frigora captant 1.80-1 ....sunt nobis mitia poma, castaneae molles et pressi copia lactis 2.51-2 ipse ego cana legam tenera lanugine mala castaneasque nuces,... 1.77-8 ....non me pascente, capellae, florentem cytisum et salices carpetis amaras 2.64 florentem cytisum sequitur lasciva capella E. 3: 1.45 pascite ut ante boves, pueri, submittite tauros 3.84-6 Damoetasģ.

I list the verbal parallels here, however, for convenience: 1.10; 6.1 ludere 1.2,5 Silvestrem, silvas; 6.2 silvas 1.45 pascite; 6.5 pascere oportet 1 .2 Silvestrem tenui musam meditaris avena 6.8 agrestem tenui meditabor harundine musam 1 .5 formosam resonare doces Amaryllida silvas 6.11 te nemus omne canet E. 7: 1.40-1 quid facerem?neque servitù) me exirelicebat/nec.... 7.14 quid facerem? neque ego Alcippen nec Phyllida habebam 1.37 .... sua .... in arbore poma 7.54 .... sua .... sub arbore poma 1.83 .... altis de montibus .... 7.66 .... in montibus altis E. 9: 1.73 insere nunc, Meliboee, piros pone ordine vitis 9.50 insere, Daphni, piros; carpent tua poma nepotes E. 10: The connections between the opening and closing lines of the collection have already been discussed in detail.</page><page sequence="19">VIRGIL'S PASTORAL PROGRAMME 125 This is obviously a very mixed bag. Some of the related passages are clearly linked in thought and context and have great significance for Virgil. Others have purely verbal connections. But they do illustrate the way in which Eclogue 1 anticipates what is to come later in the collection. It will be realised that I use the word 'anticipate' solely in the sense that these words in Eclogue 1 are so placed in the book that they precede the passages with which they are connected. I make no judgement as to which of any pair was composed first and so is alluded to by the other. All that concerns us is the effect which Virgil created by this deliberate arrangement. On that basis I conclude that it is no objection to an interpretation of a passage or passages in Eclogue 1 to say that Virgil expresses the same or a similar idea later in the book. Indeed, if one can show that there is a special point in the apparent reduplication, this will count in favour of the interpretation which produces it. For further enlightenment we must turn again to Theocritus. It is no accident that the opening line of Eclogue 1, which begins with a literal echo of Idyll 1, continues into the next line with a reminiscence of Idyll 7: 'tù 8' imo Spuaiv fļ ímò Treóicaiç áSi) 1i£?iia8ó|i8voç KaxeKéicXioo, Geie Kopãxa'. (88-9) It is, as already observed, characteristic of Virgil's manner of imitation to combine two passages from his model. It also seems to be the case that these two Idylls are those most frequently alluded to in the Eclogues.15 Since one is the opening poem of the collection and treats at length the myth of the archetypal bucolic singer, Daphnis, and the other is largely concerned with the poet's initiation, it is hardly surprising that they are of prime interest to Virgil.76 The poem most obviously related to Idyll 1 is Eclogue9. It utilises the framework of the encounter between Simichidas and Lycidas, although the subject-matter is very different.77 Virgil's love of inverting his source and of combining passages is immediately apparent in the first line where in urbem corresponds to èie 7cókioç (7.2) and pedes to 7róSaç (7.21). The same trait is visible in the detailed imitation of Simichidas' complacently modest claim to poetic fame (7.37-41) at E. 9.32-6. In Theocritus the words are addressed to a character called Lycidas, in Virgil they are spoken by one of that name. Again, in Theocritus at the beginning of the poem they have not got halfway and the tomb of Brasilas is not in sight (7.10-1), in Virgil at the end of the poem they have got halfway and the tomb of Bianor is in sight. Thus we have, in Eclogue 9, a poem which has close and obvious affinities with Eclogue 1 and carefully managed references to Idyll 7, including a passage (32-6) which refers to the poet's initiation. I am going to suggest that Virgil's imitation of what is going on in Idyll 1 goes considerably deeper than this. To understand it, we will have to look at Idyll 7 on its own.78 The main narrative incident in the poem is the encounter between Simichidas, who appears as a somewhat complacent city-based poet, and the enigmatically</page><page sequence="20">126 JAMES R. G. WRIGHT amused Lycidas, who reeks of the goats he herds and thus represents the country. It had long been realised that this meeting possessed many features of the typical encounter between man and god with Lycidas cast somewhat improbably as the god.79 It has now been established that Lycidas is none other than Lycian Apollo in disguise. This produces a piquantly humorous situation which is one aspect of the humorous presentation of Simichidas in the poem as a whole. He proudly tells Lycidas of his encounter with the Nymphs who taught him songs dv' copea ßouKoXeovxa (92). The term ßouicoXeovxa is, of course, purely conventional since we know that he is a townsman.80 He goes on to offer to perform one of these songs for Lycidas erce! cpíXoç etcXeo Moíaaiç (95), an idiotic remark to make to the god of song - remember that Virgil can call the Muses Phoebi chorus. It is little wonder that Lycidas is unable to conceal his amusement throughout (7.20, 42, 128-9). 81 In the end he makes no comment, but his action is highly significant: ö 8e poi xò Xaycüßo^ov, àSò ystałaaaę còç rcápoç, 8K Moiaãv ^eivqiov co7uaosv i^psv. (128-9) The staff represents a bucolic equivalent of the laurel staff given by the Muses to Hesiod, the goatherd's crook matching the laurel sacred to Apollo. Thus what we have is an overt account of the poet's initiation (7.91-3), apparently serious, set within a concealed initiation whose burlesque elements are obvious. The whole thing is very neatly managed by splitting the two aspects of the H esiodic encounter (the address of the goddesses and the giving of the staff) between the two versions. Callimachus is also brought into the picture by the choice of the name Lycidas which alludes to Lycian Apollo of the Aitia prologue. It seems to me that Virgil understood what was going on here. He does not, of course, imitate it precisely, but there is a broad similarity between the open and concealed imitations in this poem and what happens as between Eclogues 1 and 6. The second half of the book opens with the overt initiation plainly acknowledging the debt to Callimachus by verbal imitation. The first half is introduced by the covert initiation, enigmatic and obscure, for the appreciation only of the docti. The responsion of the two versions enables us to elucidate each by reference to the other. Thus the appearance of Apollo in 6 strengthens the conviction that a reference is intended to Apollo in 1 . The assertion non iniussa cano (6.9) may refer as much to the injunctions of the god in 1 as to Apollo's words in 6, the more so as it immediately follows a line which deliberately echoes 1.2. The sheep of 6.5 are a variant on the cattle of 1.9 and 45, the animals which embody the most direct reference to Theocritus appearing in the first poem, those that would more frequently supply the Callimachean 0úoç in the second. The recusatio which is made explicit in 6 may also be an element in 1 . The poet's self-justification for pursuing pastoral poetry takes the form of instructions from Octavian and the context of these instructions inv olves an encomium of Octavian. The main purpose of a recusatio is thus fulfilled even although the alternative types of poetry are not mentioned.</page><page sequence="21">VIRGIL'S PASTORAL PROGRAMME 127 The connection I have posited between 1 and 6 leads us to observe correspondences and symmetries within the book which supplement those which have already been pointed out. We are all familiar with the scheme worked out (along, alas, with much else) by Paul Maury,82 which takes 5 as a centre point and groups 1-4 and 6-9 symmetrically about it, relating 10 to 5 thus: 1 2 HĪ1 6 - * 6 - * 9 - 10 1 have no quarrel with this scheme but I wish to superimpose on it another which derives less from the subject-matter of the poems and more from the statements they make about Virgil's poetic position. The connections in which I am interested are as follows: A. 1 and 6: This rests essentially on the identification of the poetic initiation in 1 and its relation to that in 6. The programme outlined in both is identical. The two halves of the book are opened by passages which combine reference to Theocritus (the sound echo in and imitation of Theoc. 7.88-9 at 1.1-2; Syracosio in 6. 1 ) and Callimachus ( tenui in 1 .2, the whole imitation in 6.3-5, including deductum = tenue ).83 B. 5 and 10: I take this over from the discussions expounding the accepted scheme. Both poems exploit the Daphnis legend and its treatment by Theocritus. Eclogue 5 begins where Idyll 1 leaves off, with the death of Daphnis. It presents under that name a character who has a surprising similarity in many ways to Julius Caesar. Eclogue 10 presents the historical figure Gallus but predicates of him much of what is said by Theocritus about Daphnis. Typically the central elements of the narrative of the first poem in the Theocritean collection are most fully imitated in the last poem of Virgil's. C. 1 and 10: I have already discussed the inter-relationship of the programmatic utterances at the beginning and end of the collection. Both poems are, in my opinion, largely about bucolic poetry, a fact which is, once more, less obvious in the case of the earlier poem than the later. D. 1 and 5: The programmatic references to fineness at the beginning of 1 and end of 5 have been noted. They mark off the first half of the book before the new start in 6. More important are the clear links between the language used</page><page sequence="22">128 JAMES R. G. WRIGHT of the young god in Eclogue 1 and of the risen Daphnis in 5. 84 These and other indications support the partial identification in the latter poem of Daphnis with Julius Caesar. We thus have a neat balance of praise of Octavian in 1 and of his uncle and adoptive father in 5. The terms used have close verbal similarities but, as can be seen from the list given above (p. 124) they are spread throughout 1 but concentrated in one place in 5. The effect of this is to make us realise the full significance of these scattered comments in 1 only when we encounter them all together in 5. The basic idea of the ruler as taken up into heaven is one with which Virgil would be familiar from his Hellenistic literary sources, and which was much exploited by the Augustan poets.85 There may also be a correspondence related to bucolic song. I shall shortly argue that the makarismos of Tityrus at 1 .46-58, which expounds the felicity which he will derive from the god's favour, is largely concerned with poetic inspiration. Similarly the blessings which follow from the apotheosis of Daphnis in 5 have an important poetic element in the context of the symbolism which we have seen at work elsewhere in the Eclogues*6 The silvae of pastoral poetry make their appearance (58) with Pan the pastoral god (59) and the herdsmen who are the singers of bucolic song (59). The catchword otium (61) is used. The sympathy of nature takes the form of carmina of joy (62-4; contrast 1.38-9) and an aspect of the promised celebrations is to be singing and dancing (72-3). E. 6 and 10: As 1 and 5 for the first half, these poems mark the second half of the book by their opening and closing references to fineness. Again, they are very substantially concerned with poetry in general and bucolic poetry in particular. As Octavian and Caesar bind 1 and 5 together so the honour done to Gallus in both these poems binds them together. In 6 he is the learned poet in the tradition of Hesiod, author of the epyllion on the Grynean grove (64-73), in 10 the archetypal love poet, though not without a reference to his learned Hellenistic background (50). If we represent all this diagrammatically, it looks like this: ß] The existence of such a scheme which is both complex and symmetrically satisfying is in itself support for the interpretation of Eclogue 1 offered here. It is tempting, moreover, to see a parallel to the structure of two halves each framed by its opening and closing poem in the structure recently hypothesised for the Aitia of Callimachus by P. J. Parsons.87 While the dialogue with the Muses which provides formal unification of Aitia 1 and 2 has no exact parallel in Virgil, the suggested framing of Aitia 3 and 4 by poems in honour of Berenice corresponds</page><page sequence="23">VIRGIL'S PASTORAL PROGRAMME 129 with Eclogues 6 and 10 and their encomium of Gallus. Again, although not formally identical, the literary manifestoes of E. 1.1-5 and E. 10.70-7 serve the same purpose as the preface and epilogue to the Aitiay%% which, it should be observed, ends with the poet's expression of intent to move on to another genre. The fact that in Callimachus the Iambi which follow are a less exalted form may permit a typical inversion of the model in Virgil's surgamus (£*. 10.75). IV So far I have been advancing what seem to me positive arguments in favour of my reading of the poem as a programme for bucolic poetry in the line of Theocritus with debts to Callimachus but a new Roman flavour. I now intend to reverse the argument to some extent. Taking that reading of the poem as a datum I shall offer a series of comments on individual passages which seem to carry additional significance in the light of this analysis. In so far, of course, as they gain interest and significance from being looked at in this way, their coherence with my general reading of the poem will tend to confirm that reading. I do not, however, regard them as in general so convincing as the arguments already offered and I would not feel that my interpretation stood or fell with any or all of them. Although it will involve jumping from one aspect of the programme to another and back again, it will be most convenient to consider the passages seriatim. I also take the opportunity to offer what I believe to be some new observations on individual passages which are not necessarily closely related to my central thesis. 1.5. The lover singing of his beloved beneath a tree or in the woods is a conventional enough figure and no precise model is required. There was, however, a very famous case which had been related by Callimachus in a highly influential poem, that of Acontius and Cydippe.89 We have evidence from a number of sources about the text of the relevant part and I set it down here in chronological order: àW evi 5f| cpXoiotoi kek o jipé vet TÓaaa (pépoixe ypáppaia, Kvôínnrjv öoo* èpéovai Kakrjv.

Ep. 1.10.57-61 Propertius is, of course, making very free use of his Callimachean original and cannot be used to reconstruct its text in detail.90 Moreover, he may have had somewhere at the back of his mind the very lines of Virgil with which we are dealing. For these two reasons I limit myself to observing the presence of the fagus , shade, and woods which echo the name of the beloved. With Aristaenetus we are on safer ground. He provides a close paraphrase of Fr. 73 using identical or only slightly varied items of vocabulary and an identical construction (xóaaa ... õaa' = xoaauxa ... õaa). He neither adds to nor subtracts from his original. His introductory words fļ youv (= vel saltern, Herscher) indicate that a possible alternative is being offered to the impossible idea of the trees' becoming alive and speaking. We do not possess what preceded Fr. 73 but its opening àlX* could reflect the same movement of thought: /You may not be able to do that, but let...'. It is therefore possible that in the text of Callimachus the question of the trees' echoing the name of Cydippe was raised. Note, too, how in both Callimachus and Virgil the proper name and adjective for 'beautiful' frame the word applied to the uttering of the name by the trees. From all this, I conclude that the text of Callimachus may have had the ingredients which Virgil uses in this scene ((pqyoi, the repetition by the trees of Ki)8Í7T7üT1 KaXq, the recumbent lover). If so there would be a real point in introducing such a reminiscence here. The word tenui proclaims a Callimachean stylist. H ow much better to offer an imitation which displays Callimachus handling bucolic, or rather 'silvan' material, the very subject-matter of Virgil's own Musa silvestris. 1.11 non equidem invideo : I have already referred to the possible psychological significance of this remark of Meliboeus. It may, however, have a more important literary reference. The word invideo is used twice elsewhere in the Eclogues . At 7.58 it means simply 'grudge', i.e. 'fail to give'. But at 2.39 it refers to the envy felt by one shepherd at another's receiving a particularly prestigious fistula as a legacy. The reference is clearly to the typical rivalry of bucolic singers. Invidia occurs once in the Eclogues at 7.26. There the honour done to the rising poet Thyrsis is designed to provoke or will result in provoking the envy of Codrus. There is, moreover, a danger that Codrus will try to harm Thyrsis using his mala lingua to bestow dangerously immoderate praise. Thus in two of the three other passages where the root occurs in the book, the envy concerned is of literary distinction or success. This calls to mind the importance assigned by Callimachus to (pGóvoç and ßaaxaviri in his polemics against his critics91 and the resulting frequent references by Roman poets to the envy which surrounds the successful literary man.92 Particularly relevant is the end of the Hymn to Apollo ( 105-7) where the god deals summarily and physically with OOóvoç for his un-Callimachean poetic prejudices.</page><page sequence="25">VIRGIL'S PASTORAL PROGRAMME 131 ó O0ÓVOÇ 'AtuóâAcdvoç èrc' oCaxa Xá0pioç siTcev ' oďk äyapai xòv ãoiSòv oç oi)8' õaa ttóvtoç àeíSei.' xòv OGóvov (bnóXXtov rcoSí t' fj^aasv co8é t' seutev... The clear implication is that when Apollo is on the poet's side, envy is powerless against him. Can it be that in Eclogue 1 the announcement of the favour of the god who turns out to be Apollo is enough to preclude the possibility of envy and so requires Meliboeus' immediate protestation? miror magis : As in the case of invideo these words have a perfectly acceptable meaning in the context of the surface narrative. They express Meliboeus' astonishment at Tityrus' being exempt from the misery which surrounds him. If, however, we relate it to the divine encounter, we see that it is the correct reaction to the account of such a meeting. When Archilochus related his story to his father, Telesicles' reaction was 0aupdaai ( S EG 40-1). Thus the twofold reaction of Meliboeus is not simply that of a man who has heard of another's good fortune but of one who hears and recognises that another has met a god and been endowed by him with poetic inspiration. This specifically poetic interpretation may be supported by reference to a poem of Propertius which is precisely concerned with the epic-elegy contrast and the Callimachean ideal of style. There we find ( 1 .7.21-2, 25): turn me non humilem mirabere saepe poetam, tunc ego Romanis praeferar ingeniis; ... tu cave nostra tuo contemnas carmina fastu. Here mir ari expresses the correct attitude to be adopted to the elegiac poet by those who cannot match him. Again, in 25 we have a warning against the kind of criticism of his poetry which might be motivated by envy. Ponticus is being warned not to undervalue the inspiration afforded by Amor , and what he will do ( mirari ) and what he is not to do ( contemnere fastu) are closely similar to what Meliboeus professes not to do and to do.93 1.24-5. The Roman follower of Callimachus naturally aimed to display the doctrina for which his master was famous. A few choice examples were doubtless desirable in a programme poem. So much the better if an imitation of Homer could be provided, especially one whose significance could be grasped only with a knowledge of the context in the original. An early allusion to Homer could have a special programmatic reference in a bucolic work, extending beyond the mere following of Alexandrian convention. He had some claim to be the originator of pastoral as of so much else. The Shield of Achilles contains clearly pastoral motifs in the unfortunate ox-herds with their pipes (//. 18.525-34) or the scenes of country life (541-89). Nor should we forget the description of Calypso's island (Od. 5.63-74) and the shepherd Polyphemus. These two lines of Eclogue 1 contain a reminiscence of the simile in which Nausicaa among her handmaidens is likened to Artemis among her Nymphs.94 The comparison concludes:</page><page sequence="26">132 JAMES R. G. WRIGHT Ttaaácüv 8' ímèp fj ye KdpTļ exei 11Ô6 péxcorca, jieiá t' àpiyv(ÓTT1 néXexai, Kakai 8s xe rcdaar &lt;Sç fj y' dp(pi7üóXoiai psT87cpe7ü£ TtapOévoç áSpqç. (Horn. Od. 6.107-9) The Latin words appear to tell us simply that Rome is bigger and, by implication, better than other cities. But if we know the Greek context we realise that we are being told that she bears the same relation to other cities as a goddess to her attendant nymphs or a princess to her servants. This comparison gathers a new dimension when we think of Dea Roma as a familiar figure in artistic representations95 or of the statue of Pompey in his theatre surrounded by those of fourteen conquered provinces.96 The doctrina of the poet may go further even than the Homeric allusion. There may be a reference to the common metaphorical use of caput = 'chief city', 'capital', a usage favoured by Augustan writers to indicate Rome's international pre-eminence.97 Alternatively (or as well) we may be meant to think of the height of the Capitolium and the etymology of its name. These linked ideas are presumably referred to in the epithets alta and celsa used of it at Aeneid 6.836 and 8.653. Moreover, the goddess Roma is compared to Cybele at Aeneid 6.781-7 in a passage which draws on Lucretius 2.600-9. Virgil explicitly mentions her mural crown ( turrita , 785) which is described by Lucretius in these terms: muralique caput summum cinxere corona, eximiis munita locis quia sustinet urbis. (2.606-7) Thus the height of Rome here is both metaphorical of her superiority to other cities and physically embodied in her citadel. Homeric reference exploiting the original context, metaphor, and etymology contribute to the complexity of allusion in an apparently simple passage. 1.27-39. Together with song and the simple pleasures of rustic life love is the main subject-matter of Theocritus' bucolic poems. Its importance in the Eclogues is as great. Love must therefore appear in the programme poem, and it does so in these lines. Virgil's masterly handling of the programmatic form is displayed in the manner in which certain standard themes of erotic poetry are introduced in such a way as to contribute to the surface narrative of the poem while at the same time contributing to the programme by embodying this necessary ingredient of bucolic poetry. The most hackneyed motifs are used so that the point cannot be missed. Tityrus went to Rome to get his liberty when he was already getting old. Earlier he had been iners (27), now his beard is getting whiter. Previously he had been in thrall to Galatea and had no cura peculi (32); he could never keep his money. It is quite clear what this means. Hitherto Tityrus had been victim of the kind of disabling amor which afflicts the characters of comedy and the elegiac and other love poets. Inertia is their hall-mark: me meapaupertas vita traducat inerti (lib. 1 .1 .5). Love is for youth, not old age (which is often symbolised by white hair: tun capite cano</page><page sequence="27">VIRGIL'S PASTORAL PROGRAMME 133 amas, senex nequissume? Plaut. Merc. 305; nec dulcís amores/ speme puer ñeque tu choreas/ donee virenti canities abest/ morosa, Hor. Carm. 1.9. 15-8). The sufferer is deprived of all concern for his own welfare, even to the extent of loss of material possessions: is primum vidit sine sensu vivere amant is /et levibus curis magna perire bona (Prop. 2.12.3-4), not excluding the loss (through infatuation) of one's peculium and, consequently, the ability to obtain liberty, as witness the comments of the slaves Stichus and Sangarinus as they both succumb to the charms of Stephanium: STL vapulat peculium, actum est. SA. fugit hoc libertas caput (Plaut. Stich. 751). I forbear to multiply parallels. This passage conveys no unduly subtle psychological or symbolic truths.98 It simply supplies an ingredient without which the programme would not be complete. One might speculate that the note of rustic reality and the ideas which can be paralleled from comedy are a nod in the direction of Theocritus' debt to the mime, but it is not a point which I should like to press. The clichés of erotic poetry are continued in the grief of the (temporarily) abandoned Amaryllis. The unpicked fruit,99 a symbol of the neglect caused by her unhappiness, leads naturally into the pathetic fallacy of the landscape's desire forTityrus' return, an early allusion to the bond betweeji man and nature which is central to the Eclogues. The insistence upon Tityrus' old age (expressed by the whiteness of his beard) could have a specifically literary reference. It has, of course, been advanced as an objection to the identification of Tityrus and Virgil. In my view, Virgil's fondness for allusion by reversal makes it highly probable that he should embody reference to himself in a character as unlike himself as possible. This has the effect, however, of differentiating Tityrus also from the normal run of poets and prophets who have a divine encounter. Not surprisingly they receive their vocation at an early age. This we are told, either by themselves or others, about Hesiod, Archilochus, Epimênides and Callimachus.100 But in the preface to the Aitia Callimachus also makes great play of the fact that he is now old. Thus his critics mock his verse as childlike (Fr. 1. 5-6 Pf.), this symbolising its 'slight' character, although tü)v 8 ' èxétov f| Sek àç oďk ôXíyr|. But he hopes to shed old-age by feeding on dew-drops from the divine air (i.e. recover youth by writing a young. type of poetry): Mouaai y]àp õaooç T8ov õ0pa[x]i rcaíSaç piļ XoÇtp, rcokioùç] oďk àrcéGevxo &lt;píA,oi)ç. (Fr. 1. 37-8 Pf.)101 The poet thus embodies in himself both youth and old age. I wonder if the analogous combination in the persona of Tityrus of the old countryman and the young poet is derived from this duality in Callimachus. A final programmatic note may be struck by ingratae ... urbi (34).102 The town/country opposition which this implies is apparent in several of the Eclogues.103 The town is the goal of Moeris' forced and unhappy journey to sell his goats for the benefit of a usurper in 9, it is the place from which Daphnis must be charmed back by the love-sick Amaryllis in 8, above all it is the town which is responsible in part for Alexis' disdain of Corydon in</page><page sequence="28">134 JAMES R. G. WRIGHT Eclogue 2. The rejection of the town for the country is most fully expressed in that poem: Pallas quas condidit arces ipsa colat: nobis placeant ante omnia silvae (61-2) 1.46-58. The density of reference in these lines is particularly great and requires careful unravelling. As a preliminary corrective to my more extreme speculation I should emphasise that I am in no way denying that the lines bear their clear and obvious meaning of describing Tityrus' small-holding and the blissful life which he will lead on it. Yet so many of the features mentioned can also have a reference in the context of literary symbolism that it is difficult to resist the cumulative pressure to interpret the passage on that level as well. 104 The lines form a single unit from this point of view, but it will be convenient to consider them in the two sections introduced by the reiterated Fortunate senex (46-50, 51-58). 46-50: It is important to remember that stress is laid upon the direct and immediate connection between the words of the god and Tityrus' good fortune. Ergo (46) is used on three other occasions in the Eclogues. Once its tone is conversational (3.28) but in both the remaining passages (1.59, 5.58) it introduces the immediate consequence of a divine event or action. As a result, if my interpretation of line 45 as concerned with literature is correct we would expect what followed from it also to have a literary reference. Tua rura does not in itself suggest symbolism but magna satis may well refer to the appropriate brevity already mentioned105 as a mark of pastoral. Modesty of scale is a recurrent theme of literary discussions. The further description of the land might make us think of other literary comments, lapis ... nudus of an elegant simplicity of style, limoso and palus of the muddy flow of Lucilius in Horace or the Mpaxa yfjç and oi)p(pexóç of Callimachus' Assyrian river.106 But this would involve a contradiction. These would stand for opposed stylistic ideals, only the first of which Virgil would be likely to espouse. If a literary point is being made it is a highly contorted one which would seem to involve some kind of a joke against Meliboeus who can't handle his symbolism correctly. There is nothing else in the poem which has this sort of tone and so I think any literary interpretation should be confined to magna satis. Lines 49 and 50 have been interpreted as referring respectively to the facts that Tityrus will not now need to undertake unfamiliar types of composition and that his poetry will be immune from criticism by potential enemies (Callimachus' OGóvoç and Mcõpoç or the invida turba of Propertius).107 The pregnancy metaphor (gravis ... fetas) seems to be relatively rare of literary or intellectual production. Nor is it clear in what way the mala ... contagia are inspired by envy or malice based on critical disagreement as the Callimachean parallel would seem to require. There is, however, a different way in which these lines guaranteeing the health and well-being of Tityrus' animals (i.e. his poetry) as a result of the action of the god may be seen to fit the tradition of the divine encounter and possibly contain a reference to</page><page sequence="29">VIRGIL'S PASTORAL PROGRAMME 135 Callimachus. Poets and prophets in antiquity had much in common, not least the way in which they might receive instructions as to their calling in a divine encounter. A famous instance was the meeting between Branchus and Apollo which led to the founding of the oracle of the god run by the Branchidae at Didyma near Miletus. There was a lyric poem by Callimachus which celebrated the incident and of which a tantalising fragment remains (Fr. 229 Pf.). Other accounts (and their relationship to the passage in Callimachus is not of importance for our present purpose) are to be found in Conon's AuiyqoEiç preserved by Photius108 and in Varro in the scholia to Statius. Certain features that were apparent in the analysis of the poet's initiation occur here too. I list them in terms of the elements which were identified in the poetic initiation. 1 . Branchus (future prophet) encounters a deity (Apollo, whose prophet he will become). 2. The encounter occurs at the place where Branchus will found the shrine of Apollo and which thus becomes a home of Apollo (Call. Fr. 229. 10-11 Pf.; Conon, 33.4). This place is in silvis (Call. Fr. 229. 10 Pf., Schol. Stat. Theb. 8.198). 3. Branchus was a herdsman (Kal aoxòv è(pí^r|OEV èpaaOeiç 'ArcóÂAov, súptòv Ttoipaívovxa [Conon, 33.4]; cf. alyaç svs|íe Bpáyxoç Kai 'AtióAAcdv aòxòv è(píXr|OE [Longus, 4.17]; xExp]otrçó8a)y and X^ppiíy Pçxdvqv vépoixofCall. Fr. 229. 2,4 Pf.] would appear, assuming the former is correctly restored, to refer to this fact). 4. Since in none of our versions does the beginning of the god's words survive, we can hardly expect an address to the poet or prophet in the vocative, but it seems fairly clear that in Callimachus he was addressed. 5. Again the instructions do not survive but can safely be assumed (cf. ó 8è Bpáyyoç ... ètcíttvouç yEyovcòç èv AiSópoiç x&lt;5 x^pítp ^XPa [Conon 33.4]). 6. It would not be necessary to expect a word for 'first', either because it might be unique to literary contexts, an irrational perpetuation of its appearance in Hesiod, or because it had not survived. But it conveniently appears and in a not inappropriate context: tó0i Ttptòxov co&lt;p0Tjç (Call. Fr. 229. 10 Pf.). The words are addressed by Apollo to Branchus or by the poet to Apollo and record the positioning of the shrine at the place of Apollo's 'first sight' of Branchus or of his 'first appearance', not all that different from 'first words'. 7. An additional element appears which is also found in the poetic initiation in Hesiod (it is, of course, also found in the burlesque initiation of Idylli). This is the presentation of a staff made from a branch of the bay-tree sacred to the god as a symbol of the powers conferred (....8&lt;x&lt;pvi1ç Kaxà kXümx Tnféaç [Call. Fr. 229. 1 1 Pf.] must refer to this whether one thinks Apollo is the subject, with Pfeiffer, or that it is Branchus, with Barber-Maas-Trypanis.109 My own inclination is toward the latter view on the assumption that the staff has to be presented to the initiate to preserve the logic of the ceremony and because</page><page sequence="30">136 JAMES R. G. WRIGHT Varro says as much in Schol. Stat. Th. 8.198: hie cum in silvis Apollinem osculatus fuisset .... accepta corona virgaque vaticinan coepit.110 The etymological reference to the name Didyma in line 10, Kprļvļecov 8[i86]p(öv èyyóOi, also seems more appropriate to the main shrine than to the lesser temple of Branchus, the Branchiadon). The object of this argument is to show that the story of Branchus related in this poem of Callimachus involves an initiation by Apollo that is exactly parallel to the kind of initiation which I have posited for Tityrus at the hands of Octavian/ Apollo in Eclogue 1 . 1 1 1 If this is granted we may now turn our attention to lines 2-4 of the Callimachus fragment. It would indeed be opportune for me if the supplements of Barber-Maas reprinted by T rypanis could be accepted. According to them, Apollo appears to be guaranteeing the security of the flocks from the Xox pòç ... Kaxápaxoç apra!; and promising a supply of good grazing for them in order to persuade Branchus to abandon his herding and become a prophet. This is a reasonable pair of promises from Apollo, a god of healing (whose laurel staff Branchus used to cure the Milesians of a tanpóç)1 12 and a deity who had himself been herdsman and was a god of herdsmen. 1,3 But these two things, sound food ( non insueta ... pabulo) and freedom from disease (mala ... contagia ), are exactly what Tityrus has obtained for his animals from his god. The coincidence would surely be too striking to be accidental. U nfortunately, plausible and ingenious as the supplements may be, they go a good deal further than what is visible on the papyrus and any sound argument must confine itself to that. This leaves us with two key elements unchanged: (a) the A.oipòç ... Kaxápaxoç âprcaÇ which will or would fall or not fall upon something or other, presumably in the dative, and qualified by 7ió8(ov or a word ending in -7ió8g)v, and ( b ) the X^cppqy ßqxavriv which would be grazed on by something or other, its qualities as food for animals guaranteed by Theoc. 11.13. Given the conventions of the encounter, where the deity does the talking and acting, and the discussion of Branchus' lineage which follows these lines, presumably to offer a further reason why he should become a prophet, it is reasonable to assign the lines to Apollo. If this is so, we have the god discussing the occurrence (or non- occurrence) of precisely these two elements which are involved in the immediate consequences of the god's words in Eclogue 1. Even without the supplement xexpjçtTcóScoy, which seems highly probable, this may be sufficient to justify the connection which I am making. A highly sophisticated piece of doctrina is involved. The things promised by Apollo to the prophet as an inducement to take up his new calling are described as the consequences of the words of the iuvenis. The reader who recognised the reference would also see the assimilation of poet to prophet which is implied and which is bound up with the whole concept of the poetas vates involved with sacra , a concept central to the Augustan poet's view of himself.114 The second section (51-8) expresses Virgil's debt to his other great Alexandrian model. The lines are in general based upon Theoc. 7.131 -47, which in their turn owe a debt to Hesiod, Works and Days 582-96, one of the earliest characterisations of</page><page sequence="31">VIRGILE PASTORAL PROGRAMME 137 the locus amoenus. A further reference to Hesiod is not inapposite since he was both the first shepherd-poet and a literary hero of the Callimachean circle.115 The verbal parallels with Theocritus are clear: fontis sacros ¡' spòv ö5(op, apibus ... levi ... susurro ... psXioaai, gemere ... turturļzv xsvsxpoyíóv, ulmo/nTsXtax. In addition vsoxpáxoiai ... oivapéoiai may have suggested the figure of the frondai or. For someone who has missed the imitation, the bees of Hybla, rather far from home in the Italian countryside, point the way to the Sicilian master. The allusion to this passage of Theocritus in itself carries an allusion to poetic composition. As Giuseppe Giangrande has pointed out, the symbolism of the Nymphs, holy water, and wine in that poem tells us that the symposium included the recitation of poems.116 But the point is made more explicitly in the Latin.117 Fontis sacros is a reference to the regular equation of springs and their water and poetic inspiration. Frigus opacum is the umbra in which the poet composes. The remaining lines emphasise sound: susurro , canet (in a 'cadre sonore': alta sub rupe), raucae , gemere. Bees, too, were intimately associated with the gift of poetry. 1 18 They may often send Tityrus to sleep in their function as part of a scene of rural bliss, but it was when he was asleep that they smeared Pindar's lips with the sweet honey of song and their powers of poetic inspiration were not unremarked by Theocritus.119 While I am slightly hesitant in following Martin's interpretation of insueta pabula as types of poetry unfamiliar and uncongenial to Tityrus (i.e. non-pastoral) and mala vicini pecoris contagia as the envy of rival poets, I think there may be a further layer of literary symbolism to uncover associated particularly with the concept of Tityrus' remaining on his home ground. This fact is heavily emphasised: tua rura manebunt, non insueta ... pabula , flumina nota , quae semper. It may immediately be conceded that this is entirely appropriate and even rhetorically necessary to make the contrast with the fate of Meliboeus. But, as I have already observed, the success of a piece of symbolism may be assessed partly on the appropriateness of the terms used to both their literary and symbolic contexts. Two of the motifs used to express Tityrus' felicity, the known rivers and the customary bees, belong to the realm of literary symbolism. One of their direct antitheses could also belong to that world, the distant and mysterious Oaxes. Whatever the ultimate explanation of the name it must be at the east end of the known world to complete the boxing of the compass in lines 64-66. Cretae must then be 'chalk' and not 'Crete'. Rapidům cretae = qui rapit cretam120 and is a choice geographical detail expressed in an otherwise unexampled but perfectly sound construction, a thoroughly Alexandrian piece of writing.121 The motifs of the distant river and the bees had come together in a passage in Callimachus to which I have already referred and which has a clear literary critical import, Ap. 108-12 (Apollo speaking): ''Aaoupiou rcoxapoio péyaç jióoç, àXXà xà noXXá A.i3paxa yrjç xai noXXòv è(p' OSaxi ai)p(pexòv eXkex.

We may at once observe the appearance here of Envy, an allusion to which I have suggested exists elsewhere in the Eclogue. The holy fountain of 1 1 2 is to be found in E. 1 .52, and may be added to the bees122 and foreign river as a parallel between these lines and the passage of Eclogue 1 under discussion. The words of Callimachus constitute an important statement of his poetic programme, the river-imagery of which was picked up and exploited by Horace in his own literary polemic.123 I suggest that in these circumstances the Oaxes in Virgil is not just an exotic means of fixing the eastern limit of the known world. It also contributes to the picture of Meliboeus as cut off from the literary world which the god has granted to Tityrus. Finally, a Roman poet may be mentioned in these lines. If Otto Skutsch124 is right in seeing an allusion to a phrase of Gallus' in tua cura , palumbes ( 1 .57) 125 and tua cura , Lycoris (10.22) we have immediately a highly obscure and learned allusion to the third of the great predecessors whom Virgil honours in the Eclogues. There would, moreover, be a further link between 1 and 10, with the earlier allusion, as before, being more difficult to notice but coming into focus when the later one thrusts itself openly before the reader. A reference to Gallus is, of course, also a reference to love poetry, particularly if the phrase being imitated was mea cura, columbae as Skutsch thinks. This would make a further allusion to the central place of love in pastoral. 1.62, 64-6. The adynaton of 59-63 126 belongs to a tradition that goes back to Archilochus Fr. 122.7-9W. The introduction of Rome's great enemies the Parthians and the Germans is, however, a special feature. Taken with the references to the furthest limits of the Roman empire which follow in 64-6, they constitute a programmatic indication of the Roman qualities of the work further differentiating it from its Greek model. Yet the lines are not without their point in terms of Alexandrian poetical predilections. The inclusion of geographical information, the more recondite the better, was, as I have observed, an important aim for poets such as Callimachus. The far away places in these lines conform to this taste. They represent the limits of the Roman world and so have some degree of exoticism. The prime case of that is the mysterious Oaxes which has already been discussed. Note, too, the ars which leaves the proverbial coldness of Scythia to be inferred from the explicit reference to the thirsty heat of its opposite, Africa. V 1 now move outside the Eclogues to a number of passages which seem for various reasons to confirm my reading of this aspect of Eclogue 1 . 1 consider first the proem to Georgics 3 together with the passage which immediately precedes it. My contention is that the patterns of thought and some of the expressions displayed there are so close to those of Eclogue 1 that we can reinforce our interpretation of</page><page sequence="33">VIRGIL'S PASTORAL PROGRAMME 139 Virgil's implicit programmatic utterances in the Eclogue from his explicit statements in the Georgics J27 The conclusion of Georgics 2 is closely linked in thought as well as sequence to the opening of the following book. From line 458 to the end there is a dazzling intertwining of several themes; praise of a simple country life of secure ease as opposed to the unsatisfying artificialities of city life leading to civil war and its attendant horrors, contrast of a past Golden Age corresponding to that country life with a present which partakes of the disadvantages of city life, simple rustic faith set against scientific philosophy, Virgil's contentment to be a poet of the country and acquiescence in not being a poet of science. These four pairs of parallel contrasts have much in common with the central themes of Eclogue 1 . We are moving in the same realm of ideas, as a few examples will show. The country life is an occasion of makarismos : O fortunatos nimium , sua si bona norint, / agrícolas! (458-9). Its content is very familiar: ... at latis otia fundis /(speluncae vivique lacus et frigida Tempe/ mugitusque boum mollesque sub arbore somni)/ non absunt (468-70). But the greed of urban man after the decline from the Golden Age leads to civil war and the fate of a Meliboeus is lamented just as the good fortune of a Tityrus has been celebrated: ... gaudent perfusi sanguine fratrum / exsilioque domos et dulcía limino mutant/ atque alio patriam quaerunt sub sole iacentem (510-2). In the midst of all this, the poet aspires to receive the favour of deities of poetry (the Möses) whose priest he is and who will grant him priority in a new type of astronomical poetry: me vero primům dulces ante omnia Musae,/ quorum sacra fero ingenti percussus amore, /accipiant ... (475-7). But if that is beyond his capacities he will settle for a rustic poetry (i.e. the Georgics) whose symbolic representation and less elevated aspirations will not be new to us: rura mihi et rigui placeant in vallibus amnes, / flumina amem silvasque inglorius (485-6). He prays to be covered ingenti ramorum ... umbra (489), for felix qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas (490), but fortunatus et Ule deos qui nouit agrestis (493), including Pan and the Nymphs. These similarities are striking enough but even more impressive is the number of features of the proem to Georgics 3 (lines 1-48)128 which correspond to features which I have detected in Eclogue 1. They are: a. These lines deal with Virgil's attitude to his own output, both his present enterprise in the Georgics , and future developments in the form of some sort of epic. They justify his choices and express his aspirations. b. They contain a claim by Virgil to priority in respect of both works, the present (inter ea Dryadum silvas saltusque sequamur / intactos [40-1]) and the future ( primus ego ...¡primus ... [10-2]). c. I have already discussed the central position which Caesar (Octavian) will have in the temple of song which Virgil plans to create. We will look in vain for Augustus at the arithmetical centre-point of the Aeneid - although we have</page><page sequence="34">140 JAMES R. G. WRIGHT noticed the central position in Book 1 of the important self-announcement of his literary Doppelgänger. Yet no one would deny that if the A eneid is a temple of song then Augustus is at its centre both in his own right and as embodying the historic virtues of the Roman people. The central reference to Octavian in Eclogue 1 is a literal expression of the same attitude. d. The shrine will be the location of sacrifices and other ceremonies in honour of the god Caesar (21-5) just as the god in Eclogue 1 is promised sacrifices and honours (7-8, 42-3). e. Rome and its ruler are indirectly praised by the mention of the furthest areas to which Roman armies had penetrated. Two of them are identical with those in Eclogue 1 : Britanni (25) and Parthus (3 1 ). The others are new: Gangarides (27), Nilus (29), Asia and Niphates (30). f. Invidia makes an important appearance subjected to the fears and punishments of the damned. It is reasonable to suppose that envy is thus powerless in the face either of Octavian's political and military success or Virgil's poetic success. One obvious difference between the two passages is that there is an overt dedication in the Georgics. We are reminded that Maecenas, who had made an early appearance at 1 .2, is the addressee and prime mover of the work (41). Here, where the poet speaks for himself, the bluntness of a direct dedication is avoided but Octavian has no difficulty in upstaging Maecenas just as he had done in the proem to Book 1. So fixed is the pattern that I sometimes wonder if the Apollo who appears in the lines: ... at tenuis non gloria , si quern/ numina laeva sinunt audit que vocatus Apollo (G. 4.6-7 ) should be sought at the head of the Muses or of a Roman army. The complex of ideas revealed in this section of the Georgics contains the main elements which I have identified in Eclogue 1. In particular, it shows that description of and sympathy for the victims of the Civil Wars is in no way incompatible with glorification of a leader who had played a principal part in these wars. With the passing of time overt encomium is now more appropriate and it is not out of place in didactic as it would have been in straightforward bucolic.129 Yet, while the state of his own relationship with Octavian and the constraints of the genre may have inhibited Virgil in the Eclogues , we have already seen that the final publication date may have been sufficiently late to involve no historical anachronism. At least it is not unreasonable to suppose that what Virgil thought when he was composing the Georgics may be not unlike what he thought when he was composing the Eclogues . It is regrettable that we possess hardly any ancient criticism or interpretation of poetry which does not have some philosophical or educational or rhetorical axe to grind. But occasionally it may be possible to discern what a contemporary thought a poem was about by the use which he made of it in his own poetry. I suspect that this is the case with Eclogue 1 and Propertius 3.3. Walter Wimmel has already</page><page sequence="35">VIRGIL'S PASTORAL PROGRAMME 141 discussed the relationship of this poem to Eclogue 6.130 He did not, however, emphasise that where verbal echoes are concerned, it is Eclogue 1 that is imitated, not the later poem. The opening line of Propertius3.3 is: Visus eram molli recubans Heliconis in umbra. The word recubans occupies the same position between the third and fourth foot caesuras as in Eclogue 1.1, and in umbra concludes the line as it does Eclogue 1 .4. The phrase Heliconis in umbra is not a simple or obvious one. Camps paraphrases molli ...in umbra as 4at ease in a shady grove' to circumvent the difficulty that Propertius cannot mean the literal shadow of the mountain. But the point is that no question of literal shade requiring trees arises. Umbra is a symbolic counter for the conditions that produce poetry, which is why it is to be found on Helicon. Molli refers to the absence of negotium , the otium , segnitia or inertia which distinguished the poet from the man of action. It performs much the same function as lentus in Eclogue 1 .4. We thus have a carefully composed line drawing upon the opening of the Eclogues and using the words from there with the full force of literary symbolism. The change of location and the apparently different motivation for the poeťs recumbent position strengthen rather than weaken the force of the imitation. If Propertius chooses to do this at the beginning of a full- scale Callimachean recusatio complete with encounter with Apollo is this not evidence that he understood Eclogue 1 to contain something similar? The parallelism between the Callimachean endeavours of Virgil in the Georgics and those of Propertius had been asserted by the imitation of the proem to Georgie 3 in Propertius 3.1 .m The same thing appears to be happening for the Eclogues in 3.3. The initial imitation might be enough to suggest this, but the point is made again with a possible specific allusion to Eclogue 1 in the description of the cave of the Muses (25-32). The image of Silenus (Prop. 3.3.29) reminds us of Eclogue 6 as the intervention of Apollo had already done. But the calami( Prop. 3.3.30) recall the instrument of Tityrus (£. 1.10) and their ascription to Pan confirms the bucolic reference. The line in which Propertius introduces his own principal subject shares with Eclogues 1 and 10 the possible imitation of Gallus already referred to: et Veneris volucres, mea turba, columbae (3.3.31). So when Propertius wishes to follow Virgil in introducing Apollo as his instructor, he cannot avoid appearing to follow Eclogue 6, but his verbal references are to Eclogue 1 . My conclusion is that he saw a connection between these two poems as a result of interpreting 1 along the lines which I have suggested. Calpurnius Siculus may strike the reader as a less reliable witness. It is not my intention to defend the taste or sensibility of a writer who in the interests of a purely mechanical variation on his model could produce a pastoral poem ending with the shortening shadows of midday, thus displaying his utter insensitivity or indifference to the poetic point of the evening ending.132 Yet he was a Roman poet educated and practising in the same tradition as Virgil and he is at least as likely as we are to have understood what Virgil was about even if he was unable to use his great predecessor to produce poetry of comparable quality.133</page><page sequence="36">142 JAMES R. G. WRIGHT Calpurnius certainly understood something about what was going on in the Eclogues as a whole. He too arranges his poems in a pattern: |-1 2- Court _ ^ Purely pastoral poems ^ _ poems 6- L7 All three court poems celebrate his youthful god-prince, 1 in terms of prophecy derived from Eclogue 4, 7 in relation to the building of an amphitheatre viewed by a shepherd on a visit to Rome with echoes of Eclogue 1 , and 4 as a patron of poetry who may be persuaded to smile upon a pastoral singer's efforts. This last poem draws heavily upon Eclogue 1 and underlines its grasp of that poem by placing at its arithmetical centre one of its main laudations of the ruler: at mihi, qui nostras praesenti numine terras perpetuamque regit iuvenili robore pacem laetus et augusto felix arrideat ore. (84-6) The references to Eclogue 1 stand out: praesenti numine/ praesentis ... divos { 41), iuvenili/ iuv enem (42), ore/ voltus (63). Thus a verbal echo of the middle line of Eclogue I is found in the middle of the middle line of the middle poem of Calpurnius, the words in each case being applied to the god-like ruler who is being glorified in the poem. This poem differs from its Virgilian model in making much more explicit the fact that real people may be hiding behind the bucolic masks. While Virgil depicts herdsmen who may occasionally overlap with reality, Calpurnius seems systematically to describe real persons in the guise of shepherds. Moreover, Calpurnius' Corydon is encumbered with a patron who is important in himself and is also the means of access to the god. Thus his situation is more complex (and much more prosaically worked out) than that of Tityrus. This does not, however, interfere with the implied interpretations in Calpurnius' use of Virgil. I now discuss the significant cases in the order in which they appear in the poem: 1-8. Corydon is discovered mute and glum under a tree, beside a stream, insueta statione . On being asked the reason for this behaviour he explains that he has been meditating poetry that will not be bucolic but fit to celebrate the ruling deity of the Roman world. This reverses the picture of the happily singing Tityrus that opens Eclogue 1. Insueta surely echoes insueta pabula (E. 1.49). The unaccustomed position symbolises the different type of poetry being contemplated and thus suggests that Calpurnius took the Virgilian reference to be to types of poetry other than pastoral. We have already observed examples of imitation by reversal. Thus</page><page sequence="37">VIRGIL'S PASTORAL PROGRAMME 143 the fact that Eclogue 1 is all about Tityrus going on producing the same sort of poetry as before while Calpurnius Siculus is talking about precisely the opposite situation supports rather than undermines the hypothesis of a connection between the two poems. 36-45. The terms of this expression of gratitude to Meliboeus are important. It is through him that Corydon (and his brother) enjoy the possibility of composing pastoral poetry expressed thus: per te secura saturi recubamus in umbra/ et fruimur silvis Amaryllidos, ... Had it not been for his patron he would not be enjoying this bliss in the style of Tityrus but (like Virgil's Meliboeus) would be an outcast, a hireling, at the ends of the earth,134 and be denied the possibility of successful composition. So Calpurnius sees the Virgilian parallelism and contrast of secure ease/ song and anxious exile/ no singing and expresses the first pair with a direct borrowing from and reference to the programmatic opening of Eclogue 1. 46-9. With this distant exile would have gone an inability to communicate with the god-prince and obtain his favour. This is the de facto position of Meliboeus in Virgil, though no attempt is made to explain why he could not have done what Tityrus did. 58-69. Here we have Corydon's account of his initiation. Like Gallus in Eclogue 6 he is presented with an instrument that has a famous pedigree. The pipe belonged to Tityrus cecinit qui primus in istis/ montibus Hyblaea modulabile carmen auena. The identification of Virgil and Tityrus is complete. Hyblaea and auena come from Eclogue 1, modulabile probably from a line of programmatic implications elsewhere in the Eclogues:.../ carmina pastoris Siculi modulabor auena (E. 10.51). But, above all, the ascription of priority as a Roman pastoral poet is made, and should we not look for the source of the word primus in Eclogue 1 as well? The episode of the initiation is flat and prosaic compared with its predecessors. Can anything be less numinous than here? The topoi are mechanically handled {trepido and experiar expressing modesty, doctus Iollas implying a learned recipient to match the doctrina of the donor), but that does not invalidate the implied interpretation of Virgil. 100. Deus hinc certe deus ... refers to the god-prince and is Calpurnius' version of the repeated deus at E. 1.6-7, 5.64. 127-31. Ille meis pacem dat montibus: ecce per ilium! seu cantare iuuat .../... nullus obest - these lines are Calpurnius' expression of the thought of E. 1.6-10. Pacem is a more political version of otia, cantare iuuat corresponds to ludere quae vellem calamo ... agresti. 152-63. This complex appeal by Corydon to his patron has several points of interest. He begins, in Horatian fashion, by expressing a hope for a farm of his own, but the clause si quando nostra videre) pascua contingat sounds curiously like Virgil's Meliboeus ( E '. 1.67-9). But, in an image taken from the encounter with Apollo in Eclogue 6, poverty 'plucks at his ear' and tells him ' ovilia cura' i.e. stick to bucolic poetry. But if any of his poems are worth it, Meliboeus is to carry those</page><page sequence="38">144 JAMES R. G. WRIGHT poems to the god, to the Phoebus Palatinus. Here we have for the first time in the poem the complete identification of the god-prince with Apollo, the god of poetry, in a manner similar to that which 1 have posited for Eclogue 1 . Apollo had appeared earlier in Calpurnius' poem as the companion of Caesar (87) and several times as the straightforward deity of poetry (9, 57, 70, 72). There was plenty in imperial propaganda to encourage Calpurnius to make the identification without the help of Eclogue 1 , but that poem is so much before his mind as he writes that influence from it is not impossible. The immediately following lines which describe how Meliboeus is to play the Maecenas to his Tityrus/ Virgil tend to confirm this especially in the clause ostenditque deos. The plural is metri causa and the word must refer to the deus of Eclogue 1 who performed for Virgil what Calpurnius hopes the Phoebus Palatinus will do for him. Individually these passages can be satisfactorily explained without my view of Eclogue 1 . Collectively they seem to be capable of a more interesting interpretation in the light of that view. This is precisely the sort of exploitation of a model which would be the aim of an aspiring poeta doctus like Calpurnius, however elephantine his attempts to achieve it. Attention may finally be drawn to a poem which I do not see as directly related to Eclogue 1 but which has certain features in common with it. These features are best explained as derived from a purpose common to the two poems, the expression of praise and thanks to a divine or quasi-divine ruler. The poem is Statius, Silvae 4.2. It is a straightforward gratiarum actio to Domitian for the poet's attendance as a dinner-guest at the imperial palace. I have already observed the emphasis laid upon the fact that this is the first such benefaction bestowed upon the poet.135 A further emphasis is laid upon the gratitude felt by referring to the fact that the invitation had been long deferred. This may appear a two-edged comment to us but that does not seem to have troubled Statius. The day of the feast came for him after a long time - longo post tempore venit (64) - just as liberty (which is shortly afterwards transmuted into instructions on poetic composition) came late to»Tityrus - longo post tempore venit (E. 1 .29). There are fundamental differences between the poems. Virgil's is largely personal although it handles public themes, whereas Statius is giving formal public thanks for an occasion which is essentially public rather than personal and where he had been just one of a great many beneficiaries. Yet in each the postponement of the benefaction enhances the feeling and expression of gratitude. Statius also mentions several times the privilege of looking upon the face of the ruler. This topos of encomium also appears in its special form where the face of the ruler is likened to a sun shining upon his people (40^4). This idea is then ingeniously developed in a comparison of the appearance of Domitian's face to that of Jupiter instructing the Muses and Apollo to sing (53-6). The reader is bound to observe that this enables Statius to play Apollo to Domitian's Jupiter.136 In Eclogue 1 this same topos appears (more delicately, of course) in the word vidi (42) and the vultus of the god which will never be forgotten (63). 137 This is still further</page><page sequence="39">VIRGILS PASTORAL PROGRAMME 145 confirmation of an encomiastic purpose in the poem. The argument of this paper is intended to be cumulative. It proceeds in the classicist's customary and necessary circle from the text to an interpretation and back to the text. There may be a false step here and there which spoils the smoothness of the circle's circumference but it need not break the line and destroy the integrity of the whole. The interpretation offered seems to me to be in accord with the poetic tradition and practice of Virgil's time and to be consistent with what we know of his own techniques from other works. It does not pretend to exhaust even this one aspect of the poem's meaning, but only to make some contribution to the stock of ideas which the reader should bear in mind. APPENDIX. Eclogue 1 and Juvenal 3 Attention has been drawn by Charles Witkę138 to certain pastoral features of Juvenal's third Satire and in particular to the connection between Eclogue 1.3-4 and Juvenal 3.29, and between Eclogue 1.82-3 and Juvenal 3.316. It seems to me that Juvenal's use of Virgil is more thoroughgoing in this poem than Witke has explained and this may be an appropriate place to examine it. Juvenal clearly started from the similarities of situation between Meliboeus and his Umbricius. Both are about to become refugees. The whole of Umbricius' speech and that part of Meliboeus' utterance which is devoted to his own situation constitute their farewells to their old lives. Juvenal signals his awareness of this parallelism in the two passages picked out by Witke which frame Umbricius' speech and which correspond to the beginning and end of Eclogue 1: cedamus patria (29) and sed iumenta vocant et sol inclinât (316). It is worth noting at once that the similarity of situation is largely formal and that in some ways Meliboeus and Umbricius are more contrasting than alike. Meliboeus has to abandon his country home, Umbricius is going to a new home in the country. Meliboeus' change is from good to bad, Umbricius' from bad to good. These divergences from Virgil need not dismay us. This kind of reversal of the model is, as we have seen, one of the commonest forms of imitation in ancient poetry. It will be found to give added point to the verbal and other reminiscences of the Eclogues in the Satire. Even before Umbricius speaks we have a significant hint of the pastoral. The interview takes place in the valley of Egeria. It must once, we are made aware, have possessed the main qualities of a locus amoenus which its romantic associations deserved - running water (sacri fontis[ 13], aquis[ 19], undas[ 19]), grass (viridi[ 19], herba [20]) and shade ( nemus [13], arbor [16], silva [16], speluncas [17]). But its erstwhile rustic charms are no more, destroyed by the 'improvements' of urban civilisation, so that what Umbricius is abandoning is the opposite of what Tityrus enjoyed and Meliboeus admired. The Camenae have been driven from the grove,</page><page sequence="40">146 JAMES R. G. WRIGHT and this ejection of the native rustic deities symbolises the ejection of the native Roman and his traditional way of life by an alien urban culture. Juvenal's exploitation of Eclogue 1 is not limited to those parts concerned with Meliboeus. Tityrus went to Rome when he was turning grey ( candidior postquam fondenti barba cadebat [28]); he had no choice but to make that journey since only at Rome could he obtain what he wanted (quid facereml ... [40]). Umbricius is going from Rome while his grey hairs are fresh (dum nova canities, dum prima et recta senectus [26]). He has no choice but to make the journey for there is nothing he can do at Rome (quid Romae faciami ... [41]). The words are similiar but the situations reversed. The general complaint against the incomer and usurper of the native's rights occupies a prominent place in Juvenal in the attack upon Greek and oriental influence: non possum ferre, Quirites/ Graecam urbem (60-1). Similarly Meliboeus' fields are to fall a prey to a barbarus (71). In exactly the same way an advena has taken over Moeris' farm in Eclogue 9 (2) in a passage which is echoed by Juvenal: veteres migrate coloni (E. 9.4), agmine facto/ debuerant olim tenues migrasse Quirites (Juv. 3.162-3). The concluding lines are those which owe the most obvious debt to the Eclogues. This fact is indicated by the elegant imitation of the idiomatic imperfect of possum: hie tarnen banc mecum poteras requiescere noctem (E. 1.79), his alias poteram et plures subnectere causas (Juv. 3.315). But again the situations are reversed. In Virgil the coming of night is a reason for tarrying in so far as any connection of thought between that fact and Tityrus' invitation is to be imagined. In Juvenal it isa reason for moving off. In Virgil the man who is staying behind invites the departer to stay a night with him. In Juvenal the departer invites himself to spend some time in the future as a guest of the other, admittedly not at the place where he is remaining for the time being. The poem closes with a reference to Juvenal's own work which is filled with the Roman poet's customary pride in his own achievement. Reciting poets may be a danger in Rome but Umbricius will make a special journey to hear his friend's satires. His only worry is that he may be too rustic an audience for them (caligatus = 'with heavy boots on' i.e. 'rustic') and that they may be too proud to be heard: ni pudet illas (321). The implication is surely that these are urbane works suited for a refined and not a boorish audience. So, after all the sound and fury against the city, Juvenal remains a city-poet. He will praise his friend (2) but not imitate him. The words in which he has chosen to express this appear to be derived from Eclogue 10.16-17: stant et oves circum; nostri nec paenitet illas/ nec te paeniteat pecoris, divine pneta. Juvenal presumably understood the literary reference of these lines where the sheep join in the mourning for the love-sick Gallus. They are comprehensible only in terms of the equation: sheep = bucolic poetry = a less exalted form than epic. Just as nostri nec paenitet illas tells us that Virgil thought his own bucolic poetry of high quality so ni pudet illas tells us that Juvenal thought his satires fit only for connoisseurs.</page><page sequence="41">VIRGIL'S PASTORAL PROGRAMME 147 Clearly Virgil and Juvenal are writing with very different purposes. Juvenal's Satire is a single item in the long list of town versus country discussions in Roman literature, with a special emphasis on the satirical criticism of urban life. The imitations of Virgil seem to relate more to the framework of the poem and the meaning of individual passages than to its overall intention. They are simply part of the literary furniture, the work of a good craftsman. Recognition of them affords its own pleasures, but nothing more. Our insight into what Juvenal is saying is not enlarged by consideration of these reminiscences. ST CATHARINE'S COLLEGE CAMBRIDGE JAMES R. G. WRIGHT NOTES I . This paper has in its preparation exceeded the Horatian canon ( Ars 388) and is perhaps in danger of the fate of the cyclic poet ( Ars 139). I am grateful to the University of Edinburgh and St Catharine's College for leave of absence which made the work possible, to audiences in Newcastle, Aberdeen and Cambridge for their comments on various stages and parts of the work, and to many friends whose only occasionally ribald scepticism has been a valuable, even if insufficient, corrective to my wilder speculations. In particular, I should mention Francis Cairns, Alan Hood, Yvan Nadeau, Bill Nicoli, Roy Pinkerton, John Van Sickle and David West. At an early stage in our work I. M. Le M. Du Quesnay and I heard each other give talks which have swollen into this paper and his monograph on the poems, of which Part I has appeared in Papers of the Liverpool Latin Seminar 3 ( 1 98 1 ) 29- 1 82. It was clear that our approaches were very different and we have not discussed the poem since then, although I have derived considerable benefit from the ample erudition of his published work (hereafter referred to as łDu Quesnay'). While on some central issues we are deeply opposed, there is much in his discussion with which 1 do not disagree and which is entirely compatible with my own views. It is symptomatic of this that the first version of my paper was entitled ł Eclogue 1: Programme poem and syntaktikon'. When it became clear that Du Quesnay had proceeded much further than I had with the generic approach I left this area to him and concentrated on other matters. I have, in the main, resisted the temptation to note and justify disagreements with him and other scholars. 2. For example: J. Martin ( Wiirzb. Jahrb. 1 (1946) 98-107) saw the connection between E. 1 .45 and E. 6.4-5, and pointed out the parallel between the god's address to Tityrus and that of the Muses to Hesiod; Rudolf Hanslik (ITS 68 (1955) 5-19) developed these ideas and detected the casting of Octavian as Apollo; Viktor Pöschl ( Die Hirtendichtung Virgils (1964) 9-15) expounded the essentially programmatic nature of E. 1.1-5. I had arrived independently at a formulation of these views before reading their work. 3. In general terms the contention that the nature of the poet's own activity is a major topic of the Eclogues is far more widely accepted than when I began to write. Indeed, many recent treatments go a good deal further than 1 would wish to in their speculations. Substantial contributions on this theme will be found in E. A.

It should also be noted that</page><page sequence="42">148 JAMES R. G. WRIGHT G. W. Bowersock ( HSCP 75 ( 197 1 ) 73-80) has presented a powerful case for identifying the addressee of £ 6.13 as Octavian, not Pollio, with a consequent advancing of the terminus post quem for the publication of the collection to 35 B.C. This has led Wendell Clausen ( HSCPlb (1972) 201-5) to argue that the historical circumstances which appear to lie behind the attitudes expressed in £. 1 best accord with a date for final composition not before 35 B.C. My own view of the nature of the poem had driven me to similar conclusions, although I would not share the degree of confidence which permitted Clausen to introduce the later dating without caveat into The Cambridge history of classical literature 11 (1982) 309. The principal obstacles to accepting such a view in the past have been (1) the testimony of the scholiastic tradition that the Eclogues were composed in the years 42-39 B.C., and (2) the a priori (and usually unstated) belief that since the expropriations of land in Northern Italy formed the background to the narrative of the poem it must have been written within months of their occurrence in 40 or 39 B.C. I have nothing to add to Bowersock's trenchant demolition of the scholiastic tradition (73). The second obstacle is equally fragile. No argument can be advanced to prove that Virgil could not have chosen the expropriations as a suitable background for a Roman pastoral poem three or four years after the events. Furthermore, even if the poem had been originally conceived and written in 40 or 39 it could still, as I observe below (n. 6), have been subject to rewriting to an incalculable extent. 6. It is in principle impossible to date the whole of a Latin poem, particularly one in a collection composed over a number of years and subsequently published as a single entity. It may be possible to fix a terminus ante quem through an inclusion or omission which is inconceivable in certain datable historical circumstances. Such opportunities are likely to be few and highly debatable. All that can normally be established, if suitable evidence is available, is the latest historical event or circumstances reference to which is detectable in the work. This provides only a terminus post quern for publication. Given Roman habits of composition, circulation and revision, the poem may contain material from several reworkings at different dates. All that we usually possess is the final version. It is the datum upon which criticism should be based. Neglect of this elementary principle is one of the prime sources of the vast and fruitless literature upon the relative dating of the Eclogues . The order in which Virgil composed the poems is of no literary significance whatsoever. What matters is the effect upon the reader which results from publishing them in their present form and present order. It should perhaps be added that these facts render any attempt to use these poems as historical or biographical sources hazardous in the extreme. Even so sober a reconstruction as that of Michael Winterbottom (G &amp;R 2nd ser. 23 ( 1 976) 55- 9) is in the end of limited value. For further discussion of the 'achronicity' of the Eclogues , see J. Van Sickle, CW1S (1981) 72 and the literature cited there. 7. Catul. I.I, Hor. Carm. 1.1, Tib. 1.1, Prop. 1.1, Ov.

A point noted by Pöschl (n. 2) 10, who also draws attention to the sense-echo of Theoc. 7.88-9. This combination of elements of two Theocritean passages is immediately characteristic of Virgil's methods. Although the order of the poems in ancient editions of Theocritus is uncertain, it seems safe to assume that Idyll 1 always appeared at the head of the collection (cf. A. S. F. Gow, Theocritus 1 (1950) lxvi-ix). The point of the echo is clearly to recall the opening words of his chosen model. 10. Cf. Peter L. Smith, TAPA 101 (1970) 506-7. 11. For what follows cf.

It is true that Virgil would have found this form of prooemium also in Greek poetry (e.g. II. Parv. Fr. I ) and that both here and at A . 7.37-45 he combines it with the appeal to a divine inspirer. This does not detract from the primacy given to the human composer at the beginning of each of his works.</page><page sequence="43">VIRGIL'S PASTORAL PROGRAMME 149 14. Cf. Hermesian.

His contention that Acontius and Cydippe was an important source for Virgil in Eclogues 2 and 8 and is alluded to through the mouth of Gallus at £. 10.52-4 lends significant support to my own view (p. 1 30) that the reference to it in the opening lines of E.

I regard the word 'allegory* as a red herring. Saying that Tityrus is Virgil's poetic 'persona* is merely a convenient shorthand for the statement that the ideas about poetic composition which the poem communicates emanate from Virgil. 36. Cf. e.g. Catul. 1 16 as expounded by C. W. Macleod ( CQ n.s. 23 (1973) 304-9), Hor. Carm. 3.30. 37. Cf. Schmidt (n. 3) 32-8. 38. Doubtless with an allusion to the equally programmatic cricket-cage being woven in the first poem of Theocritus' collection {Id. 1.52-3). 39. I detect an identical movement of thought in Prop. 2.13, which makes sustained use of the Callimachean programme (cf. L. P. Wilkinson, CR n.s. 16 (1966) 141-4): ¡£t mea sat masna est si tres sint pompa libelli/ quos ego Persephonae maxima dona feram (25-6). Whatever the correct reading at the beginning of 25, an apparent contrast is clearly intended between the self-deprecating sat = a form of magnus and the self-assertive superlative maxima. The pompa may appear small, but it is actually great. We should not, therefore, translate maxima dona by 'as all my offering'. These lines are a further example of the poem's central theme of the paradox of the 'slender Muses' (3) whose poetry will rival even the might of Homeric epic (37-8). There is, pace Camps ad loc., no irony in maxima , and of the passages which he cites as parallels only Prop. 2.9.40 is apposite since there the same thing is both great and small simultaneously, whereas at Prop. 4. 1 .34 and Ov. Fast. 6.263-4 the contrast is between past and present scale which is not nearly so paradoxical. Another example of the same movement of thought using Callimachean terms in Virgil is G. 4.6-7: in tenui labor; at tenuis non gloria, si quem/ numina laeva sinunt auditque vocatus Apollo. In tenui equivocates artfully between the smallness of the actual subjects, the bees (who have, by contrast, just been described magniloquently in anthropomorphic terms), and the stylistic sense of the word (which again contrasts with the 'epic* terms just used of the bees: magnánimos duces, populos, proelia). But the poet's inspiration will transmute this tenuis subject- matter and stylistic level into something great and glorious. 40. On otiosi see C. P. Segal, G&amp;R n.s. 17 (1970) 25-31 and on lusimus Fordyce ad loc. 41. GR BS 5 (1964) 196. The whole article is of great interest for my present theme. Clausen comes very close to identifying the Callimachean nature of Eclogue 1 . 42. Martin(n.2) 104, Francis Cairns, Cßn.s.21 (1971) 207, citing Thuc. 1.5.2, [Moschus] 3.82, Virg. E. 6.46, 62, Hor. S. 1.10.36, 2.5.41, Stat. Silv. 2.7.77. 43. Cf. Theoc. 4.4. 44. Cf. LS s.v. 1.2, and Coleman ad loc. 45. I do not mean that Virgil was unaware of the true significance of dvaXXa (although I believe there may have been some confusion in his view of [Theoc.] 9.3). Such an outrageous bilingual etymology is a highly sophisticated piece of wit at the expense of the doctrina which it itself manifests. 46. Other equally erroneous etymologies are to be found in the scholiastic tradition: cf. Schol. in Theoc. Vet. pp. 4.3-5, 10.5-26 Wendel. 47. The word errare may have suggested itself to Virgil through his awareness of the use of potucoXeìoOai/ -eìv by Callimachus ( Del. 4. 1 76) and Theocritus (7.92) in the sense of 'wander' (without a flock). This interpretation is argued at length by Giuseppe Giangrande (AQ 37 (1968) 508-1 1). He is probably right to accept Gow's interpretation of the choice of the word in Theocritus as being to express the specifically bucolic nature of the inspiration which Simichidas received. One should not, however, forget that a rustic locus and occupation is conventional in encounters between poets and prophets and the gods who inspire them (see p. 1 17).</page><page sequence="45">VIRGIL'S PASTORAL PROGRAMME 151 48.

Branchus is not included in the lists in West (n. 49), but his experience clearly conforms to the type. 53. This was pointed out by Hanslik, (n. 2) 16-7 (cf. Inez Scott Ryberg, TAPA 89 (1958) 1 17-8). It is astonishing to Find Colin Hardie ( The ancient historian and his materials , ed. Barbara Levick (1975) 1 17) concocting an explanation based upon Tityrus' supposed position as an estate manager. Equally odd is the puzzlement of M. J. C. Putnam ( Virgil's pastoral art (1970)44) at the use of the word puer when Tityrus is a senex. Puer was used of slaves without distinction of age. The phrase ut ante is more easily explained in terms of the surface narrative (e.g. Du Quesnay 135-6) but it is not beyond the bounds of imagination to suppose that Virgil is claiming 'divine' approval for work already in progress. Ovid does precisely that, although in a jocular manner, at Fasti 4.15-6. 54. Fora succinct account of the arguments, see Gordon Williams (n. 4) 31 1-2. (cf. Du Quesnay, 133-4). One may add the (colloquial?) use of deus to describe the great in Augustan Rome, e.g. Hor. S. 2.6.52. Du Quesnay (4 1 -2) draws interesting parallels with Theocritus* praise of Ptolemy Philadelphus in Idylls 14 and 15. Note that in the passage which he regards as most striking (14.6 1-4) Ptolemy is described as qnXópoixjoç. 55. Cf. L. A. Moritz, CQ n.s. 18 (1968) 1 16-31. Mr A. G. Lee points out to me that the references to Pollio and his espousal of nova carmina begin in the twenty-fifth of the forty-eight lines of the amoebaean contest in Eclogue 3. The arithmetical centre is not found so precisely, but the position and content of the lines suggest that here too we have a dedication expressed by mentioning the dedicatee in a central position. 56. On this formula and its application only to gods and rulers who are being treated as gods, cf. Peter Levi, H 94 (1966) 76-8. His argument that E. 8. 1 1 cannot therefore be a genuine reference by Virgil to Pollio is not conclusive (nor are any of his other arguments). A young poet writing in the Rome of about 40 B.C. which lacked a single god-like ruler might have used such an expression to Pollio then at the height of his success and might simply not have felt the need to remove it at a later date when the book was published and the position of Pollio was rather different. If, on the other hand, G. W. Bowersock (n. 5) is right in claiming that E. 8.6-13 are addressed to Octavian, the consequences are very interesting. The 'first and last* formula is then entirely appropriate. We have, moreover, a parallel to the relationship which I shall argue exists between the encounter with the deity in E. 1 and Apollo's instructions to Tityrus in E. 6. A standard motif is First presented in a covert fashion in £ 1 and then made explicit in the later poem, this later reference helping us to understand the earlier if we have missed or failed fully to appreciate it. The actual central position in £. 1 fulfills the 'in the middle' part of the formula, while £. 8 supplies 'First and last' in the normal way. One serious difFiculty which I feel in accepting Bowersock's case and its consequences is that £. 8.6-13 do not seem to be worked into any of the systems of symmetrical correspondence in the book as a whole. In the light of my later observations on this subject, 1 Find it hard to believe that such a major encomium of Octavian would have been left suspended in a place of so little signiFicance. 57. For discussion and a survey of prev ious interpretations, cf. L. P. Wilkinson, The Georgics of Virgil (1969) 165-72, 323-4. Wilkinson is surely right to draw attention to the Pindaric imagery of the passage.</page><page sequence="46">152 JAMES R. G. WRIGHT But that does not preclude, as he seems to think, a simultaneous debt to Callimachus. Much earlier Greek literature was mediated to the Romans through the Alexandrians. The images of the way, chariot- driving, and envy were doubtless taken by Callimachus from the earlier Greek tradition (cf. e.g. apart from Pindar, Choeril. Fr. I ), but his particular formulations became canonical. One can almost assert a principle in these matters of post Callimachum ergo propter Callimachum (cf. Clausen (n. 4 1 ) quoted on p. 1 14). This is not to deny that Virgil may have been aware of these images as Pindaric but to assert that he cannot have failed to be aware of their use by Callimachus. I did not have sight of the excellent article by Richard F. Thomas 'Callimachus, the Victoria Berenices, and Roman poetry' ( CQ n.s. 33 (1983) 92- 1 13) until my work was completed. His discussion of the proem to Georgie 3 {a) offers full arguments for the position taken in this note, and ( b ) demonstrates a detailed exploitation by Virgil in a programmatic context of material from the Aitia, which enhances the plausibility of my claims for the use of similar techniques by the poet in an earlier work. 58. This is not the place to offer an interpretation of E. 6, which would require another work as long as the present. To substantiate the description given, I simply draw attention to a few salient points. It opens with Tity rus- Virgil's inspiration by Apollo in Callimachean style. It contains Gallus' inspiration by the Muses and Linus on behalf of Apollo in Hesiodic style with an encomiastic reference to Gallus' (Callimachean?) aetiological poem on the Grynean grove. A lively and very slightly risqué narrative introduces a song in which, whatever the rationale of the arrangement and selection of material, a great variety of poetic themes and stylistic treatments are artfully fitted together. It is a virtuoso piece and Apollo is to be found at its beginning and end as well as in the midst, if not the middle, of the song. 59. Siiv. 1.4.19-37. 60. Hanslik, (n. 2) 18, identifies Octavian with Apollo making the additional point that in Hesiod the Muses are doing the work of Apollo in giving him instructions and so the source of the instructions in Virgil must also be Apolline. On Octavian's Apolline propaganda, cf. P. Lambrechts, La Nouvelle Clio 4/5(1 953) 65-82, Stefan Weinstock, Divus Julius (1971) 12-15, esp. 15. Clausen (n. 5) 202-3, reminds us of W issowa's observation on E. 1 .44 that monthly celebration of the birthday of the ruler was a feature of Hellenistic ruler worship. See Du Quesnay (101-12) for a well-documented account of deification as a topos of the eucharistikon. 61. Suet. Aug. 70. 62. Hanslik (n. 2) 1 7, is right to say that there is no question of temporal sequence in the use of the word (i.e. the god is not the first of several persons to respond to Tityrus) and to emphasise the debt to Hesiod. Interpretations such as Hardie's (n. 53) 1 17, where the iuvenis is first of a number of masters {praesentis divos [41]), simultaneously ignore the conventions of rhetoric (see the next note) and of poetic symbolism. I cannot, however, share Hanslik's view that no real weight is to be attached to primus. 63. Du Quesnay 98, 134-5. For words denoting priority of action applied to a benefactor who is being thanked cf. e.g. Cic. Red. Sen. 8 {princeps ), 24 {princeps, primus ), Red Pop. 16 {unus), Marc. 11-2 ( unus), 23 {unus) - unus is, of course, a fortiori equivalent to primus. One may also note Stat. Silv. 4.2 where the priority words appear in order to emphasise the poet's gratitude but are transferred from the benefactor to his action or its results: primum (6) indicates that this is the first time Statius has been invited to dine with Domitian ; haec aevi mihi prima dies, hiclimina 13) claims that the effect of the act has been to mark a new beginning of life for the poet. The aim in both places is the intensification of the expression of gratitude not the clarification of temporal questions. I return to this poem later. Ovid characteristically exploits both temporal and eucharistie senses at Pont. 3.3.29 in a programmatic context. 64. It is, as it were, a literary specialisation of the 7tpdjToç sòpETqç concept which was at least as old as Aeschylus (cf. Adolf Kleingünther, Phil. Suppl. 26 Heft 1 [1933]). The example of Epicurus at Lucr. 5.8 9 illustrates well the possible overlap of benefactor and innovator. Epicurus is being thanked in appropriate terms for the benefits which he has conferred on mankind, but these benefits have been made possible by his intellectual innovation. Many additional examples including the Callimachean</page><page sequence="47">VIRGIL'S PASTORAL PROGRAMME 153 variations can be found by consulting Walter Wimmel, Kallimachos in Rom ( Hermes Einzelschriften 16, 1960) index s.v. primus-Mot'i' . 65. 1.66 (Epicurus), 1 17 (Ennius), 926-30 (Lucretius), 3.2.9 (Epicurus), 5.9 (Epicurus). 66.

The first and last of these passages indicate the claim to priority (as Catullus did in part) by the use of the words auderej audax, the literary use of which I explain in n. 69. 68. There is doubtless an element of the eucharistikon present, but it is only one feature of the context. Ov. Met. 5.341-4 is a clearer case of gratitude to the innovative deity; cf. Lucr. 5.14-5, Virg. G. 1.147, Tib. 1.7.29-36, Ov. Am. 3.10.11-14, East. 4.401-2. 69. Enn. Ann. 217, Lucr. 1.67, Catul. 1.5, Virg. G. 1.40,2.175, Hor. Serm. 2.1.62-3, Prop. 2.10.5-6, cf. Hor. Ars 125-6, 286-7, Man. 3.1-3. In this specific sense of innovation the term has a Greek forerunner in the use of ToXpãç at Call. Fr. 203, 19 Pf. where the reference is to his rashness in writing in many metres unlike other poets. The word is put in the mouth of an imagined opponent and so is presumably intended to be denigratory whereas in the Roman poets the sense is always one of boldness as a positive virtue. For less specific uses in literary contexts cf. Brink on Hor. Ars 10. The dangers of literal-minded historical or biographical readings of these poems are again illustrated by Hardie (n. 53), who takes audaxque iuventa to mean that Virgil displayed youthful boldness in his overt attacks on Octavian in Eclogues 1 and 9. (The word audax at Hor. Ep. 2.2.51-2 is equally devoid of political implications.) It is worth observing that such violence to the meaning of the text is provoked by a view that the poems are attacks upon Octavian, a view which can hardly survive a reading of them unprejudiced by the false beliefs about their date and Virgil's personal involvement in the expropriations derived from the scholiastic tradition. 70. Williams (n, 4) 328-9. The uniqueness of the circumstances holds given a reasonably tight definition of 'contemporary'. On a rather broader scale of both time and genre the dedication is seen not to be compulsory (cf. Peter White, J RS 64 (1974) 55; pp. 50-61 of that article give a thorough account of ancient book-dedications which illustrates the great variety of methods employed in addition to the direct address by name). Since, however, I detect a dedication in E. 1, 1 do not wish to pursue the point. 71. Similarly Cicero's Brutus and Académica are dedicated to Brutus and Varro respectively by their being introduced as principal characters whose appearance sparks off the conversation reported in the work (White (n. 70) 52) and not by any formal address. Even when there is no formal difficulty in addressing the dedicatee, he may be mentioned only in the third person or simply alluded to. The absence of a vocative or second person address does not make Paulus Maximus any the less the dedicatee of Horace's fourth book of Odes {Carm. 4.1.9-1 1). I would even suggest that Odes 3 is directed towards Maecenas by the concluding reference in the opening poem to Horace's Sabine farm {Carm. 3.1.47) which is made to symbolise his preference for peace with little (which in turn symbolises his poetic calling) as opposed to wealth with trouble. The encomiastic purpose is sufficiently served by the presence of the person at the beginning of the work. In exactly the same way there may be no effective difference between the use of Dw-Sf/'/and Er-Stil in religious utterances (cf. Eduard Norden, Agnostos Theosed. 4 (1956) 143-66). Nor does the postponement until line 42 of the word iuvenis which identifies the god tell against the view. Tullus has to wait nine lines to hear his name in Prop. 1 . 1 and Messalla more than fifty (two-thirds of the poem) in Tib. 1.1. 72. Cf. E. Fraenkel, Horace (1957) 242-6, R. G. M. Nisbet and M. Hubbard, A commtrsarv on Horace: Odes / (1970) 16-7. 73. Not to mention an explicit imitation with variation of the Hesiodic encounter at 6.64 -73. This</page><page sequence="48">154 JAMES R. G. WRIGHT presumably corresponds to the situation in Callimachus where the v isitation of Apollo (Fr. 1.21-28 Pf.) is separate from the dream of meeting the Muses ( Schol . Flor. ad Fr. 2 Pf.). Such a correspondence may lend support to the correspondence for which I later argue between the double encounter with 'Apollo' in Virgil and the double 'divine' encounter in Theoc. 7. 74.

For a survey of schemes which attempt to establish the existence of deliberately planned responsions and correspondences in the arrangement of the book see Niall Rudd, Lines of Enquiry (1975) 119-44. While this offers, as intended, an interesting study of methodology its disappointingly negative conclusions result largely from a concentration upon schemes which are no longer seriously believed by anyone. Again, the Maury scheme is discredited by refuting the o'er-enthusiastic support for it of Brooks Otis ( Virgil { 1964) 1 28-43). It may well be that Otis goes too lar in his attempt to provide a convincing explanation for the scheme in terms of the detailed treatment of subject-matter and an overall contrast between the first and second halves. This may be too subjective, but that does not diminish the credibility of more objective elements such as the general subject-matter of particular poems (e.g. the expropriations of land in 1 and 9), or their form (e.g. 3 and 7 amoebaean). Rudd does not consider the additional scheme which I am about to put forward. 83. The exactness of this equivalence can be illustrated from a non-symbolic context in Pompon, com. 57-9 = Macr. 6.4. 1 3: vocem deducás oportet ut mulieris videantur/ verba. - iube modo adferatur munus, ego vocem reddamļ tenuem et t innu lam. 84. These connections are clearly stated by Friedrich Klingner(//62(1927) 147-52, cf. now Virgil('967) 27 32); cf. Josef Liegie, H 78 (1943) 216 and Anm. 6, F. Börner, Würz. Jahrb. 4 (1949-50) 61-2. 85.

There may be some sense in libertas of 'freedom to compose' (cf. n. 3 1 ) but I feel that the word relates mainly to the surface narrative and its function is to get Tityrus to Rome where he can meet the god. This would be legally credible on the basis of his seeking a magistrate with imperium who could manumit him under the procedure for manumissio vindicta (cf. Susan Treggiari, Roman freedmen during the Late Republic (1969) 21-5). There is, of course, no mention of Tityrus' master who would have had to be present also and the god's response is quite unrelated to manumission. Libertas is a temporary signpost in the narrative whose importance is exhausted when it has served its immediate purpose of motivating the journey. An alternative and possibly more plausible account of the necessity of Tityrus' journey is provided by Du Quesnay (115 1 27). It is a remarkable piece of scholarly ingenuity and (in the best sense) imagination, but seems to me to go beyond what even a Roman reader could infer from the text. The conflicting explanations, all of them possessing some degree of implausibility, advanced over the years by competent scholars raise the question of whether the text implies a fully worked out legal situation. 99.

Cf. also the stories about Pindar (Paus. 9.23.2) and Aeschylus (Paus. 1.21.2) and the adoption of the motif (doubtless with at least an element of autobiographical veracity) by Horace (Carm. 3.4.9-20, cf. 4.3.1-12), Ovid (7&gt;. 4.10.57-8), and Quintus of Smyrna (12.309- 10; one wonders if he is deliberately going one better than Callimachus by receiving inspiration rcpiv ye poi àp&lt;p' Trapela KaxaaicíôvaaOai louXov rather than àpxiyévsioç, although Horn.

Had he included in his citation of Conington's note on 35 the preceding sentence, the logical incoherence</page><page sequence="50">156 JAMES R. G. WRIGHT of the position adopted would have been manifest. Tityrus is slightly illogical in blaming the town for the unfortunate results of his own infatuation with Galatea, but such behaviour is both psychologically plausible and may be justified by the programmatic implications indicated. 103. It is also fundamental to the humorous purpose detected by Giangrande (n. 78) in Theoc. 7 where much of the point depends upon the exposure of Simichidas the pseudocountryman by Lycidas and the poet. 104. Martin, (n. 2) 104, interprets non insueta pabulo (50) as łcustomary arť and mala vicini pecoris contagia (50) as 'rivalry of the envious'. Berg, (n. 3) 1 50-3, carries this a good deal further with particular reference to Callimachus. As well as making additional points, I have to traverse this ground again so as not to leave my argument incomplete. 105. P. 113. 106. Hor. 5. 1.4.11, 10.50, Call. Ap. 108-9. 107. For Callimachus, cf. p. 130, and n. 91; Prop. 3.1.21; cf. n. 92. 108. FGrH 1, p. 201, 3-22, cited as Conon 33. 109. Pfeiffer, II, 120, E. A. Barber and Paul Maas, CQ 44 (1950) 168, C. A.

The staff and wreath are, of course, aetiological elements in the story, explaining the origins of the crown of laurel and wand which were used in the ritual of divination. Cf. J. E. Fontenrose, TAPA 64 (1933) 105. The whole article is of interest for the background to Callimachus' poem. Fontenrose suggests (103 n. 20) that Varro and Conon may have had different sources, one Callimachus and one Ephorus, as an explanation of any discrepancies between them (e.g. Apollo kisses Branchus in Conon, vice-versa in Varro). 111. One may add the observation that the encounter was clearly env isaged as taking place in Branchus' youth (cf. e.g. Conon, 33.4). 1 12. On the whole question of the plague and Branchus as healer cf. Pfeiffer ad loc. Pfeiffer's observation 'at in Branchi fabula Milesia de hac re adhuc nihil notum est' is entirely consistent with the Barber- M aas-Trypanis explanation. There is nothing in the story about animals being struck by a plague because what Apollo is giving is a pledge that they will not be struck. In this case his medical powers are put to preventive rather than curative use. Thus the questions of the animal plague and Branchus' subsequent healing powers (for which after a divine encounter cf. Epimênides Vors. I, p. 28.8 15), are quite separate and distinct. It is worth observ ing in anticipation of the parallel I am going to draw with Octavian/ Apollo in Virgil that Apollo's medical function was to the fore in his earliest appearances in Rome (cf. Jean Gagé, Apollon Romain (1955) 19-83). 1 1 3. "AtüóXXcdv Nópioç.

For much information on the traditional connection between bees and poets, cf. Berg(n. 3) 207 n. 60. He does not, however, mention the largest collection of such information, W. Robert-Tornow, De apium me/lisque apud veteres significai ione et simbolica et mythologica (1893). 1 19. For Pindar cf. Paus. 9.23.2 (note the characteristic features of the divine encounter: Pindar is voiuig, he is on a journey, the time is midday); other versions in Ael. VH 12.45, D. Chr. 64.23, Philostr. Im. 2.12. The popularity of such tales can be seen by their ascription in later times to Virgil ( Vita Focae , 28-30) and Lucan ( Vita Vaccae). Bees and honey are also, of course, closely connected with Apollo in both his prophetic and poetic functions, cf. Robert-Tornow (n. 118) 1 16. Theocritus relates such a story about a goatherd singer, Comatas, at 7.78-85. Honey is also the appropriate reward of the sweet- tongued singer at Theoc. 1.146-7. 1 20. Cf. Kenneth Wellesley, CP 63 ( 1968) 140. Note further that Virgil seems fond of using rapidus in an etymologising way, e.g. rapidus vorat aequore vortex (A. 1.117); cf. G. J. M. Bartelink, Ety mologisierung ij Vergilius (1965) 29. 121. For Alexandrian interest in rivers, cf.

The figurative use of the muddy river in S. 1.1.54-60 is particularly interesting in the present context. That poem, like Eclogue 1, contains an implicit programme which is made explicit later in the book. The example of the river is set in an ethical discussion, but its use of the imagery of Callimachean poetics makes a literary point. The same thing can be more easily seen at the end of the poem, where the comparison of that rare occurrence, the contented man, to a conviva satur (with an implied etymology of satura , one of the names of the genre) leads into the Callimachean adherence of iam satis est and verbum non amplius addam (117-21). 124. Rh M. 99 (1956) 198-9. 125. Cf. Prop. 3.3.31 et Veneris dominae volucres, mea turba, columbae. 126. On the doctrina of these lines, see Du Quesnay 137-8. 1 27. 1 start from the position that, while the Eclogues are not in a full sense 'Augustan* poems, there is a continuity in thought and expression between them and Virgil's later works. 128. For the importance in that passage of ideas going back to Pindar and Callimachus, cf. n. 57. A preoccupation with the poet's task has been identified as an element in almost all of the surviving epinician odes of Pindar (Richard Hamilton, Epinikion: general form in the Odes of Pindar { 1974) index s.v. Poet's Task; cf. CR n.s. 27 (1977) 5). Its presence in the Eclogues other than I can be detected for certain at the following places: 2.31-9, 3.60-3, 84-7, 4.1-3, 53-9, 5.45-55, 81-4, 6.1-12, 64-73, 7.18-28, 8.1 13,9. passim , 10. passim. Conversely, Thomas (n. 57) emphasises the epinician nature of much of the imagery of the proem to Georgie 3. 1 29. The open, if obscure, encomium of Eclogue 4 is a special case and its extension of the conventions of the genre is signalled in the opening lines (1-3). 130. Wimmel (n. 64) 221-50. 131. Wimmel (n. 64)216 -8. It is interesting to note from that discussion that Propertius seems to have treated the end of Georgics 2 and the beginning of Georgics 3 as a single unit for the purposes of imitation. This lends support to my own adoption of the same viewpoint in analysing the similarities between this section of the Georgus and Eclogue 1.</page><page sequence="52">158 JAMES R. G. WRIGHT 132. Ecl. 4. 168-9. Raoul Verdière's attempts to explain this away are quite beside the poetical point (7*. Calpurnii Siculi De Laude Pi son is, etc. (1954) 255). 133. For the interpretation by a Silver Latin poet of Augustan poems see Alex Hardie, Statius and the Silvae (1983) 152-71, esp. 156-64 on Silv. 3.2 and Hor. Carm. 1.3 (cf. Ov. Am. 2.1 1, Hor. Epod. 1). 1 34. There may be an elegant piece of variado on his model in 41 -2 (cf. E. 1 .65). The locale of Corydon's exile would have been by a silt-bearing river in the far west as opposed to the far east. The conscious doctrina of the reference is guaranteed by the use of dicitur (cf. Fordyce ad Catul. 64, If.). It is not possible to say for certain whether Calpurnius recognises and exploits a literary significance in Virgil. 135. N. 63. 136.
