<plain_text><page sequence="1">Anthropomorphic Effigies of the Plains J. Rod Vickers Human effigies are rare and widely distributed on the northern and central Plains but may be absent from the southern Plains. Easily disorganized or destroyed, few figures had survived un damaged when first recorded by such pioneering archaeologists as Richard G Forbis. Many of the figures remain enigmatic, of unknown age, cultural affiliation, and function. However, examination of the data suggests that others can be classified into two groups. One group, Napi Figures, is similar to iconic figures of Ceremonial tradition rock art and likely date to the Late Prehistoric period. Distributional information suggests that most or all of the latter were constructed by the prehistoric Blackfoot. The second group, Narrative Figures, commemorates violent encounters dur ing the Historic period and are analogous to Biographic tradition figures in rock art. The defining attributes which have resulted in this classification were first articulated by Richard G. Forbis and Thomas F. and Alice B. Kehoe almost 40 years ago. Keywords: Plains, human effigies, Napi, Blackfoot, Old Women's phase Old Man was travelling about, south of here, making the people. He came from the south, travel ling north, making animals and birds as he passed along. He made the Milk River (the Teton) and crossed it, and, being tired, he went up on a little hill and lay down to rest. As he lay on his back, stretched out on the ground, with arms extended, he marked himself out with stones,?the shape of his body, head, legs, arms, and everything. There you can see those rocks today (Grinnell 1907:137). When he came nearly to the Red Deer's River, he reached the hill where the Old Man sleeps. There he lay down and rested himself. The form of his body is to be seen there yet (Grinnell 1907:143). Old Man or Napi as the Blackfoot know him formed the world, its animals, plants, and people (Grinnell 1907; Wissler and Duval 1908). He es tablished the relationships among beings and taught the people how to kill buffalo, make tipis, and live in the world. As he traveled, he changed the land scape in southern Alberta and his adventures are marked in the natural world at such places as the Knees, the split rock at Okotoks, the Bowling Green at the Gap, and Old Man's Sliding Grounds. The outline of his body, formed of rocks at places where he lay down to rest, can be found scattered across Blackfoot territory in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Montana, and beyond. The effigies of Napi are still recognized and venerated by the Blackfoot peoples (the Peigan [Piikani], Blood [Kainai], and Blackfoot proper [Siksika]) of Alberta (Figure 1). Indeed, my col league Jack Brink of the Royal Alberta Museum recently participated in a sweat with Blackfoot ceremonialists at the Sandgathe effigy in Dino saur Provincial Park. However, not all human ef figies across the Plains can be ascribed to Napi; some represent historical events commemorated by various tribes, and some remain mute, lacking any known ethnographic description or associa tion with oral tradition. In this paper, I have at tempted to compile a description of all Plains human effigies1, and to examine these for regu larities which may reveal their historical context (Figure 2). J. Rod Vickers, 5325 -109 Street, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6H 3A5, rvickersll@shaw.ca Plains Anthropologist, Vol. 53, No. 206, pp. 199-221, 2008 199</page><page sequence="2">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST VOL. 53, NO. 206, 2008 Figure 1. The Sandgathe effigy in Dinosaur Provincial Park, Alberta (cour tesy of John H. Brumley. Ethos Photo Record 77-9:9, Ethos Consultants Ltd, Havre). The figures illustrated in this paper were pre pared from a variety of sources: field drawings, maps on site inventory forms, unpublished papers, and published sources. Figures were scanned and traced, rotated so that the head was at the top of the page, and scales added or converted as neces sary. Originals were of variable quality; for ex ample, most did not indicate whether magnetic or true north was depicted. No scale was present on several of the original plans. Thus, while gener ally correct, it would be unwise to undertake de tailed metric or orientation analyses using the fig ures produced here; original sources should be consulted. A smoothing function that reduced the actual detail in the shape of each rock was used, essentially rounding the outline of individual rocks; detailed rock shape seemed irrelevant given the small size of the final drawings used in this paper. Lastly, some very complex figures such as the Cabri Lake and Wild Man Butte effigies had been so reduced in the original publications that the rocks had 'bled' together and I occasionally had to guess where one rock ended and another began. Still, I believe the figures are as fair a rep resentation as can be made, short of ac cessing original field drawings and begin ning from scratch. Note that designation of right and left (e.g. left arm, right leg) in the text is from the perspective of the figure, as if it was face-up, lying on its back. This is the po sition Grinnell indicated Napi assumed in the quotation cited above. It is also appropriate for effigies such as Wild Man Butte where facial features are depicted and is used as a convention throughout this paper. Lastly, I have used common spelling from the Canadian archaeological litera ture to refer to Native groups. Naming conventions vary somewhat between American and Canadian sources, between disciplines, between authors, and between various First Nations. Smyth (2001) ex plores names in some depth. Regardless, the reader should have no trouble identi fying the groups. Much of the descrip tion of Napi effigies has been published elsewhere in a locally available book produced by the Archaeological Society of Alberta (see Vickers 2003). NAPI FIGURES So-called Napi effigies are commonly rec ognized in the archaeological literature of the northern Plains. Such figures are formed by boul der outlines and are generally characterized by a rectangular body with simple extensions of the body forming the legs, out-turned feet, upraised arms, simple heads, heartlines (lifelines), and male genitalia. The figures are static frontal views. The Kehoes compiled the first comparisons of phallic human effigies, and, quoting GrinneH's (1907) tales, deduced that these figures might rep resent Napi. They also observed the western dis tribution of the figures, noting that the Bozeman effigy in Montana was very similar to a number of figures reported from Alberta (Kehoe and Kehoe 1959:125). Wormington and Forbis (1965:100) also noted that single figures without associated features probably represented Napi: "Other fig ures, without accompanying features, were in tended to represent the peregrinations of Napi, the 200</page><page sequence="3">J. Rod Vickers Anthropomorphic Effigies of the Plains Blackfoot trans former-trickster, as he coursed his way over the Alberta plains." They contrast these to Historic pe riod effigies, noting that there is a clear difference in subject matter; one type rep resents actual his toric events while the other belongs in the mythological sphere. In Alberta, seven Napi figures remain extant and another was probably present based on the story as sociated with this site. At least six additional figures are known from Saskatchewan, Montana, South Da kota, and Kansas. While the Alberta ef figies are commonly identified as Napi fig ures, others are grouped with the Alberta sites on the basis of style. Whether these truly represent Napi will be discussed further below. The effigy at British Block medicine wheel, EdOp-1, is situated within the circle that surrounds the central cairn (Figure 3, see Brumley 1988:16; Forbis 1970:33; Wormington and Forbis 1965:123). The medicine wheel consists of a 9 m diameter cairn surrounded by a cobble circle 30 m in diameter. The feet of the effigy are immedi ately interior to the east side of the stone circle. The figure is not oriented toward the central cairn; rather the longitudinal axis of the figure points westward past the northern side of the cairn. The figure has a rectangular body with straight legs and out-turned feet. The arms appear to be slightly uplifted. A neck and a heartline are present. The head is illustrated as a cluster of rocks; this does / ALBERTA { SASKATCHEWAN i ( MANITOBA / Rumsey-Co ^ Heron / ? l\ 1 EiPf-1 \/Dorothy ? u . I VK^l S\ , \\ 11 Tie Creek NapisGrav^J^ .

There is a suggestion of male genitals, but these are again unclear. The figure is oriented with its head approximately to the west or west-southwest. Site EeOu-2 contains a male effigy, referred to as the Sandgathe effigy (Figure 1). The figure has a rectangular body but the shoulders are not clearly defined by a horizontal line (Figure 4, Bayrock 1964; Klassen 1986). The head is de picted by a small cluster of rocks. There appears to be a neck. A rock is present in the heart area but no clear heartline is present. A penis is present. Both arms are upraised; hands may be present but are not clearly defined. Legs are generally straight extensions of the body outline and have out-turned 201</page><page sequence="4">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST VOL. 53, NO. 206, 2008 $ -+~ N o_i meter Figure 3. Effigy at British Block medicine wheel, EdOp-1 (re drawn from Forbis 1970). feet. The figure is oriented with the head to the west. Kehoe (1965:13) illustrates this effigy and identifies it as located at Steveville in his figure caption. Kehoe's plan is identical to Bayrock's, but indicates small pebbles in the hand and finger area. The figure illustrated here was redrawn from a map prepared by Klassen (1986). The effigy at EfOq-87 forms part of the Ross medicine wheel (see Brumley 1988:20). This wheel consists of a small central cairn about 2.5 m in diameter and a partial surrounding circle. The effigy is situated about 2 m from the central cairn and is oriented in line with that feature. The effigy consists of a rectangular body which lacks a hori zontal closing line at the shoulders (Figure 5). No neck is present, nor are there arms. The cairn, situ ated superior to the body, may have represented the head; if so, it is out of proportion and uncon nected to the body. The lack of arms and neck sug gest the figure has been disturbed. A heartline is present but somewhat disturbed. A penis is present. The legs are straight extensions of the body out line. The foot area is occupied by a depression, perhaps a collapsed burrow, and no feet are now present. The figure is oriented with the head to the west-northwest.

The Sandgathe effigy, EeOu-2 (redrawn from Klassen 1986). and is known as the Dorothy or Crawling Coulee effigy (Figure 6, Bayrock 1964). This figure con tains a generally rectangular body, slightly wider at the shoulders than the waist. Both a neck and heartline are present. The head consists of a clus ter of rocks, described on the site form as a cairn. The arms initially extend straight out at about 90? to the body, but bend upward into raised hands. The legs are straight extensions of the body out line but are short in proportion; that is, the trunk is longer than the legs. Since the penis equals the length of the legs, it is possible that the lower legs are missing. If there was no disturbance, then there is a suggestion of an out-turned right foot. Testes are suggested at the base of the penis. Rock art figures sometimes depict these as two dots on ei ther side of the penis line (see Magne and Klassen 1991:403). The end of the penis may be depicted as another dot on the rock art figures, and this fea ture is mimicked by a rock cluster at the end of the penis. The figure is oriented with its head to the southwest. A male effigy is recorded for the Consort site, FaOr-4. I was unable to locate the original map and have reproduced the figure as illustrated in Wormington and Forbis (1965:99); they indicate the figure is about 4.3 m long (Figure 7).

A single large rock forms the head and additional stones suggest a neck. A heartline is present. The right arm appears to be oriented downward and the left arm is missing. The head is oriented just south of west. The Ward effigy, EfPf-16, consists of the outline of a male figure (Figure 8). The chest is a rectangle and contains four visible rocks in the heart area. These have been disturbed and it is not known if they were originally arranged as a heartline connected to the neck or occurred in their present form. The neck is composed of three cobbles and the head is formed by two cobbles. A cairn is present beyond the large rock forming the head and is out of line with the axis of the figure. The limbs of the effigy are incomplete. A portion of the upper right arm is preserved but no arm exists on the other side of the figure. The legs are both present and are slightly bent at the knee. Each foot is formed by an oblong cobble, and they are ori ented to the right. Between the legs is the usual penis and testes formed by three cobbles. The pe nis is unusually short compared to other effigies and rock art figures. The effigy figure is oriented approximately east-west with the head at the west 203</page><page sequence="6">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST VOL. 53, NO. 206, 2008 o Q u o QogcQ CP ^ 0 1 meter Figure 8. The Ward effigy, EfPf-16 (redrawn from author's field notes). end. An effigy is present at the Rumsey Cairn, EfPk-2, but has been disturbed and may not be a Napi figure. Rumsey Cairn is a medicine wheel consisting of a very large central cairn surrounded by a proportionally small cobble circle; the hu man effigy lies outside the circle. The site was looted, probably several times, before being re corded by Glenbow Foundation archaeologists in the early 1960s. A sketch map with the site form shows a hollow rectangular body outlined with double or triple cobble rows. A depression occu pies the head area and likely represents a looter's hole. The left leg is shown as a straight cobble row with an out-turned foot on most maps, but it is shown bent at the knee in the site form sketch map. The right leg is shown bent at the knee with the foot pointing downwards but is sometimes depicted with two rows of cobbles and sometimes with a single row. Several rock rows are pendant to the right thigh, but do not appear to represent a penis. There are no arms. The figure is oriented with the head generally to the west. The sketch map is annotated "stones not deeply set obviously placed here recently" (Alberta Archaeological Site Data Inventory Form). Indeed, this site was in a very poor state from looters when Glenbow per sonnel arrived and was subsequently excavated and restored by them. Thus, this effigy may have been severely disturbed and its current configuration may not be authentic; for these reasons the effigy is not illustrated here (Brace 2005:71). The rect angular chest and left leg, similar to the other Alberta Napi figures, suggest that this may have been a Napi effigy, much mutilated by settlers. The last Alberta Napi effigy, EiPf-1, was never observed by an archaeologist; it had been de stroyed prior to initial Glenbow Foundation sur veys in the province. It is mentioned here for the description on the site form (Alberta Archaeologi cal Site Data Inventory Form): Mosaic (formerly), said to have been rocks faced in such a way as to outline the figure of a man... it is said by Martin that some pranksters of Blackfoot mythology found the old man [Napi] sleeping on the hill and outlined his body with stones, when he woke up, he was frightened by the stones, thinking he might be dead, he ran away. Both the story and the description of the figure as a boulder outline suggest this was a Napi effigy like the ones previously described. Three Napi figures are known from Montana. The Henry Smith site, 24PH794, contains two fig ures (BLM Antiquities Site Inventory Form; Ruebelmann 1988). Henry Smith No. 1 has a rect angular body with some disturbance to the left side and waist (Figure 9).2 The legs are straight and the right foot is out-turned; the left leg may be disturbed and the foot is missing on that side. A cluster of rocks between the legs suggests a penis was present but this portion of the anatomy is no longer recognizable. Similarly, a few rocks within the body may indicate that a heartline was once present. The shoulder is slightly rounded and ex tends into upraised arms; small pebbles may indi cate the right hand. No neck is present. The head is formed by a somewhat dispersed cluster of cobbles. The figure is oriented with the head to the north. Henry Smith No. 2 has a rectangular body and straight legs (Figure 10). The legs are very short in relation to the body and might be disturbed. Both feet appear to turn to the left, but this again may relate to disturbance. A few cobbles suggest a pe nis. A possible heartline is present. The shoulders 204</page><page sequence="7">J.

The head is formed by a loose cluster of cobbles; it is not clear if a neck is rep resented. This figure is also oriented with the head to the north. Kehoe and Kehoe (1959:125) describe the Bozeman effigy, 24GA106. Additional notes on this figure can be found in Malouf (1975), Deaver and Deaver (1984) and Baumler (1997). All rec ognize the effigy as a Napi figure. Deaver and Deaver (1984) provide the most detailed map of the figure. The body is almost square, contracting slightly at the shoulder line and being somewhat curved at the base; both the Kehoes' and Malouf's sketch maps appear to over-emphasize the round ness of the body. Legs are straight and slightly outspread and the feet are turned outwards. A large penis is present; it is over half the length of the legs. The penis has a markedly bulbous end and apparent testes are represented. The shoulder is formed by a straight cobble line but no heartline is present. Arms are variously portrayed; the Kehoes show possible upraised arms whereas Malouf (1975) suggests they are downturned. The Deavers' map depicts a straight right arm and a left arm perhaps bent at the elbow (Figure 11). The presence of a large juniper bush in the head area no doubt made definition of this part of the figure difficult. A small cairn appears to form the head and a neck may be present but this area ap pears to be somewhat disturbed.

This effigy is the most southwesterly one in the known distribution. In western Saskatchewan, the Cabri Lake ef figy, EgOk-1, appears to be a Napi Figure. The fig ure has a rectangular body, slightly wider at the waist than the shoulders (Figure 12; Kehoe 1965:13). There is a heartline terminating in a larger rock. Interestingly, two cobbles are present in the lower torso; these are certainly kidneys and are analogous to similar designs in painted sacred tipi covers (Brasser 1978:3; McClintock 1936:13). This is the only effigy figure known to have these attributes. A neck is present and the head is formed by a loose cairn, probably somewhat disturbed. Arms extend outward from the straight shoulder line but then bend upward; hands appear to be indicated by clusters of pebbles. The right leg is straight and parallel to the body while the left leg is somewhat curved and extends outward from the body. The thighs are thickened with sev eral cobble rows. Both feet are present and ori ented toward the left. A penis with a bulbous end and testes is present. The figure is oriented with the head to the east. The landowner indicates that he has recently discovered a second similar ef figy on the property (see Brace 2005). A probable Napi Figure is present at the J) o l I | 00*000 0 , ^ meter Figure 12. The Cabri Lake effigy, EgOk-1 (redrawn from Kehoe 1965). Federenko Napi site, 32WI320, in North Dakota (Otto 1991). The figure is situated within a large stone circle (Figure 13). The body consists of a cobble outline rectangle. Both arms and legs are bent and of similar size; it is not obvious which is which, but I assume Otto illustrated the figure up right on the page. Assuming that the head area is to the west, then the figure has a heartline, but no neck or head. A cairn or rock cluster to the right of the figure is reminiscent of the offset cairns at a number of Alberta sites. The arms extend 90? from the shoulder before turning upward. The legs are bent at the knee in an exaggerated bowleg and the feet turn outward and downward. A cluster of rocks may indicate a disturbed penis. The last Napi Figure is located far to the south; the Penokee effigy, 14GH308, is in northwestern Kansas (Williston 1879; Wygal 2000). The fig ure consists of a rectangular body sparsely out lined with cobbles (Figure 14). Shoulders are not well-defined. The right arm is generally straight and the left arm is slightly upraised. The head is formed by a cobble circle and no neck is present. Large ears are depicted. Legs are parallel to the body and have out-turned feet. A cobble cluster suggests male genitals.

A heartline is present on his sketch but no genitalia are shown. As Stein (1985) notes, Williston stated that the sex was strongly indicated and the absence of geni talia from the sketch may be merely Victorian modesty. In summary, the Napi figures have a cobble outline rectangular body, a neck, upraised arms, heartline, penis, straight legs and out-turned feet. Heads are usually portrayed by cobble clusters or cairns, but in some cases the head cairn is not closely related to the body in either position or size. The Alberta figures, the Bozeman effigy, and Penokee figures have their heads generally to the west; that is, they may be said to be facing east. The Henry Smith effigies face south and the Cabri Lake figure faces west. Despite disturbance and some variation in specific attributes among the figures, they appear to bear sufficient attributes in common for one to be reasonably confident in the classification. NARRATIVE FIGURES A number of effigies are described in the lit erature which represent actual historical events. That is, the participants represented by the figures are known, and the events which took place are described through a series of markings on the prai rie. I have borrowed the term "Narrative" from Michael Klassen's (1995, 1998) analysis of pic tographic/petroglyphic rock art at Writing-On Stone Provincial Park in Alberta. I prefer this to the term "Biographic" (Keyser and Klassen 2001) since the essence of these effigies is the narra tion of an event rather than the exposition of bio graphical information. Kehoe and Kehoe (1959) provide the first area compilation of such figures, while Wormington and Forbis (1965:100) were the first to explicitly note the chronological implications of associated features at these sites: Some [effigies] commemorate events that have occurred within living memory. They are usually concerned with the murder of an individual from a neighboring band or tribe. The effigy figures are usually accompanied by other rock formations that are said to indicate the routes of the participants in the story... In Alberta, two sites contain Narrative Fig ures. Both are located on Indian reserves; EePf 67 is on Blackfoot Indian Reserve No. 146, and the other, DjPg-2, is on Blood Indian Reserve No. 148. Both have now been destroyed (B.O.K. Reeves, personal communication 2000). The his torical events which are witnessed by the effigies were recorded by Kehoe and Kehoe (1959), and Dempsey (1994). As a result of their efforts, we are fortunate to be able to link archaeological fea tures with oral tradition, a rare situation in Alberta. The figure on the Blackfoot Reserve, EePf 67, was described by Kehoe and Kehoe (1959) and represents an historic personage, Young Medi cine Man. As Kehoe (1965:8) notes, the site con sists of a "...figure of a man, slightly larger than life size, lying spread-eagled, with a trail of eight boulders leading north from the figure's feet to one cairn, and a trail of twenty-two boulders lead ing south from the head to a second cairn." The effigy has a neck, head, arms and legs formed by single rows of cobbles, while the body is formed by an irregular cluster of rocks (Figure 15; Kehoe and Kehoe 1959:121). Both arms are out stretched at about 90? to the body while the legs are each angled outward about 45?. The head is 207</page><page sequence="10">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST VOL. 53, NO. 206, 2008 # 0 : B?P&gt; 0000 ; ?." I ?/ ^? 0_1 0^4.??^ meter .A 0 1 : N ? Figure 15. The Young Medicine Man effigy, EePf-67. Inset: site map (redrawn from Kehoe and Kehoe 1959). formed by a single cobble. The head is oriented to the south. No heartline or genitalia are present. This rock-filled figure is part of a complex of cobbles and cairns which narrate the historical event. The figure marks the spot that a Blood, Young Medicine Man, was killed by a Blackfoot, Walk ing With A Scalp, in 1872. The cairns and boul ders represent the paths followed by Young Medi cine Man and Walking With A Scalp from the start of their duel to the spot where Young Medicine Man fell, marked by the effigy. Kehoe and Kehoe (1959) provide a very detailed description of the event. Kehoe summarizes the story as follows: Young Medicine Man and his band had camped at Blackfoot Crossing in order to trade hides to a bootlegger operating from a cabin there. Two North Blackfoot coming to the cabin had been invited to drink with the Bloods. A drunken brawl ensued, and one of the North Blackfoot was killed. It happened that Heavy Shields, a Blackfoot chief, had also gone to the bootlegger. Three warriors of Heavy Shields' band witnessed the brawl as they rode along the edge of the valley. Assuming their chief had been attacked, they galloped down to avenge him. One of the three warriors, Walking With A Scalp, shouted to the alarmed Young Medicine Man, "Don't bother putting that saddle on?I'm going to kill you!" Young Medicine Man turned toward Walking With A Scalp, who leaped from his horse. Both men raised their rifles and fired. Young Medicine Man fell dead. Then the three North Blackfoot went on to massacre the entire Blood band. Later, the band of the murdered North Blackfoot honored the warriors of Heavy Shields' band by marking with cairns the spot at which Young Medicine Man and Walking With A Scalp began their duel, and placing stones along their paths and to outline the loser's fall. (Kehoe 1965:8) Site DjPg-2, the Wild Turnip Hill effigy, on the Blood Reserve in southern Alberta, contains the second Narrative Figure, although it bears little resemblance to the figure commemorating Young Medicine Man's death. It was recorded by Rich ard G. Forbis in 1957. The head joins directly to the shoulders with no differentiation of a neck (Figure 16). The arms and legs are thick in pro portion to their length and contain several rows of cobbles. The arms are straight and extend out ward at 90? to the body axis. The legs are very slightly spread. Feet are not represented although there is a general thickening in the area of the left foot. Genitals appear to be absent. A sketch map in Forbis' field notes from 1957 indicates the head is to the west, and that three cairns are situ ated to the north of the figure (Figure 16, inset). k % ft o i ??- % ^ coJ f meter ? / (approximate) ^ I Figure 16.

Rod Vickers Anthropomorphic Effigies of the Plains The cairns represent the sitting places of three Bloods while the effigy represents a slain Kutenai. North of the cairns is a zigzag line of cobbles while three radiating cobble rows extend southward from the right arm of the effigy. Forbis (1970:32) states: "Stone lines, now destroyed by cultivation, indicated the courses the Indians took." Dempsey (1994:66) indicates that the zigzag line represents the path of the Kutenai's hesitant approach. Dempsey (1994) relates the events com memorated by the Wild Turnip Hill effigy. In 1862 relations between the Blood and Kutenai were so good that the latter spent the winter on the Plains instead of in the mountains. Minor brawls occurred among the young men, mainly as a result of gam bling, but these were smoothed over. In one of these, the brother of Many Spotted Horses, a prominent Blood chief, stole a race horse from the Kutenai and was killed in the ensuing melee. Many Spotted Horses determined to seek revenge for his brother's death, and rode to Wild Turnip Hill with two companions. There, they dis mounted, sat in a row, and filled a pipe. Meanwhile, a Kutenai named White Horse had stolen a horse from the Peigan and was riding it back to the Kutenai camp past the hill. Many Spotted Horses made signs to him to come and dismount and smoke the pipe. After some hesitation while he ascertained that the three men were Bloods and not Peigan, White Horse approached, dismounted, and sat facing Many Spotted Horses and his com panions. Many Spotted Horses then shot him dead. A few days after the event, some Bloods went to the site of the killing on Wild Turnip Hill and commemorated it with stones. Three cairns marked the places where Many Spotted Horses and his companions sat, a line of stones marked White Horse's hesitant journey, and an outline effigy of a human body marked where he fell (Dempsey 1994:66). Further east in South Dakota, Lewis (1889) describes two Narrative Figures at Punished Woman's Hill. Both figures, about 13 m apart, are outlined with boulders or cobbles. The male fig ure, about 4 m long, consists of a rectangular body, wider at the shoulders than at the waist (Figure 17). The arms extend outward at 90? from the shoulder line with the forearms upraised and bent slightly inward. The head is an open cobble circle Oo o o o % I /// 0 o / o 8 iL cooo ooco 0 1 meter Figure 17. The Punished Woman's Hill male effigy (redrawn from Lewis 1889). which arises directly from the shoulder line. Both legs are formed of single rows of cobbles and the feet are turned outward at 90?. A presumed penis extends horizontally just above the lower termi nus of the rectangular body. The female figure is smaller, about 2.5 m long. Again, the body is rectangular but the shoulders slope upward to a simple circular head formed by four cobbles; no neck is present (Figure 18). The arms extend outward at 90? and terminate in short vertical line segments. Legs are straight cobble rows with out-turned feet. Breasts are indicated by two cobbles, while female genitals are indi cated by a cobble circle at the base of the rectan gular body. A line of cobbles extends about 39 m south from the feet of the male and terminates at a cairn. Another trail of cobbles begins perhaps 35 m west of the cairn and extends westward another 85 m or so. At least two other cairns are present and, perhaps, a third figure existed before vandals car ried off the rocks. Lewis indicates that the Da kota had a story accounting for the features: A chief of that nation had a very beautiful daugh ter, whom he forced to marry against her will. She 209</page><page sequence="12">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST VOL. 53, NO. 206, 2008 1 I f n / ood? ff OocP 0 1 meter Figure 18.

The lawful husband followed their trail, and when he dis covered them he killed the lover and savagely wounded the woman, leaving her to die. On return ing to the village he boasted of what he had done. The chief loved his daughter, and so, taking the people of his village, he went to see if what had been said was true. Finding that it was, he killed the hus band. The Indians marked the places where the lover and wife were found, and also the spot where the husband was killed. The trails, with the bowlders [sic] strewn along at intervals, are said to mark the ground over which the woman crawled towards the lake in search of water. (Lewis 1889:161) Analogous effigy sites formed by cutting out the prairie turf have also been reported on the northern Plains. In the report of the United States boundary survey (Campbell and Twining 1878) one such site is described as the "Hill of the Murdered Scout." This locale, DgMn-2, situated in south eastern Saskatchewan about 5 km (3 mi) north of the boundary, is a prominent flat-topped hill on which a human figure with outstretched legs and uplifted arms had been excavated a few centime ters into the turf A stone was located in the head area. Footprints had also been cut into the sur face. The following story was collected from an "ancient half-breed":3 Late in the fall of 1830, a party of Assiniboines, extending their wanderings far to the east of their own country, camped on the point of the lake to the north of the butte. One of their number, ascending the hill to watch the surrounding country for traces of hostile occupation, discovered a camp of Sioux close under the hill on the south. Cautiously ap proaching the crest, he came suddenly upon a Sioux warrior lying rolled in his buffalo-robe, and appar ently overcome with sleep. Seizing a large fragment of granite rock, the Assiniboine approached his foe with stealthy step. With one vigorous blow he struck the Sioux, and fearing to have missed his aim, or that it might not have been fatal, turned and ran from the spot. Looking back and seeing his enemy quivering on the ground, he returned and dispatched him. (Campbell and Twining 1878:60) The cut out figure marked the slain Sioux, while the cut out footprints marked the path of the Assiniboine. Kehoe (1965:11) provides a sketch of the figure which he attributes to Henri Julien, a reporter who accompanied the North West Mounted Police on their trek westward in 1874. However, the victim is said to be a Mandan and the killer a Cree in Kehoe's version of the story. The sketch includes sod cut footprints indi cating both the advancing and retreating route of the Cree. Kehoe and Kehoe (1959:121) provide infor mation on another sod-cut monument constructed by Mandan or Hidatsa near Like-A-Fishhook vil lage in North Dakota. Commemorating a brave defence against the Sioux, hoof prints cut in the turf mark the passage of the hero while two low mounds with stones laid on them mark where one person was wounded and where a Sioux warrior fell. While the mounds do not seem to be actual effigies, the hoof prints show the widespread use of ancillary features to depict the action narrative (Keyser 1987). A similar example of narration is present at Snake Butte in South Dakota (Over 1941). Here, an Arikara was ambushed and shot by a Sioux. The story continues: The Ree [Arikara] turned and ran almost north....At something like three quarters of a mile from his starting place he fell dead. His Sioux adver sary built a small cairn at the starting place, and following his course, placed a stone upon each drop of blood he found on the way, and finally built a large caim upon the spot where the Rcc fell dead. (Over 1941:50) 210</page><page sequence="13">J. Rod Vickers Anthropomorphic Effigies of the Plains Again, the cairn is not an effigy sensu stricto, but the starting cairn and line of cobbles bear an obvious resemblance to the cairn and cobble row at the Young Medicine Man effigy in Alberta. Similar in construction to the monument near Like-A-Fishhook, the Snake Butte site attests to the relative importance of narration in the His toric period. Although narrative can be present in pre-con tact rock art, Keyser and Klassen (2001) indicate that post-contact motifs, as well as drawings on robes and in ledger books, emphasize narration of events in a fashion similar to the effigy sites de scribed here. They term this the Biographic tradi tion and stress how symbols, such as short dashes or C-shaped hoof-prints, mark the movements of protagonists through the composition. Such sym bols denote time as well as space and are key to understanding the sequence of events being nar rated. Somewhat similar conventions are employed at Narrative Figure effigy sites. There is no de monstrable stylistic similarity in the actual effigy forms. Rather, it is the concept of narrative and commemoration which links these sites one with another, and all with the contemporaneous Bio graphic tradition rock art. Like the latter, Narra tive Figure sites are widespread on the northern Plains and are not the product of a specific ethnic group. UNCLASSIFIED FIGURES A number of effigies do not lend themselves to classification in my simple Narrative Figure/ Napi Figure scheme. Some of these figures may simply be too disturbed to classify, but others are certainly unique. Clearly they indicate the variety of forms which can be constructed in this medium. In Montana, the Anderson-Roe Petraform, 24MA1747, is a large boulder outline figure situ ated on a flat-topped ridge (Figure 19). There is a dense natural cobble pavement exposed on the surface and, while the basic outline of the figure is apparent, it is difficult to discern whether any particular rock should be included in the figure, thus making mapping somewhat problematic (Baumler 1998). The effigy is extraordinarily large, measur ing 27 m long. The body is formed by two some what oval cobble rows which meet at a constric \ J \. / meter I * Figure 19. The Anderson-Roc effigy, 24MA1747 (schematic only; redrawn from Baumler 1998). tion about one third of the way below the shoul ders. A possible row of spaced cobbles spans the constriction between the body segments. The head consists of another large oval of cobbles arising directly from the upper body segment. The base of the body is delineated by a well-defined cobble row. Below are two well-defined legs which are short in proportion to the torso. No feet are ap parent. An amorphous group of rocks between the legs might represent a penis. No arms or heartline are present, but a depression in the latter area has disturbed the figure. The figure is oriented with its head approximately south-southwest. The head and constriction in the torso are unlike those of the Napi Figures described previously, although its boulder outline form, straight legs, possible penis and static appearance bear some similarity to those effigies. The Kayville effigy, DkNg-2, in Saskatchewan, was recorded in 1967 as a 3 m long human effigy enclosed by a rectangle of cobbles about 3 m long on each side. The site form sketch map shows a boulder outline figure with a rectangular body, outspread legs, arms slightly upraised and a large rock for a head (Figure 20, inset). A cluster of rocks above the head may indicate a headdress. A 211</page><page sequence="14">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST VOL. 53, NO. 206, 2008 penis, heartline and neck are not indicated. The mapped figure is less convincing than that of the site form sketch map; the large head stone is ab sent and the arms are ill-defined (Figure 20; Brace vdf Kl OOOOCOOO OOO N ^ .: } o f 0 6a o 1 ? 0c5&amp;: ? ???? k Vs. ?? meter ?0 ?

While the effigy, like the Anderson Roe Petraform, might be classified as a Napi Fig ure, it seems too ambiguous to do so with confi dence. Two enigmatic effigies are known from the Bowman site, 48PL195, in Wyoming. Bowman No. 1 is about 2.15 m long and oriented with the head to the north. The figure has a rectangular rock-filled body with a straight right leg in line with the body edge (Figure 21); the left leg is simi lar but incomplete. A small rock between the legs might represent a penis, but this is unclear. The arms slope downward about 45? and a few pen dant stones might indicate digits. The head is formed by a single large rock. Bowman No. 2 is about 1.7 m long and ori ented with the head at the east. The body is a some what irregular cluster of rocks with the legs per haps slightly outspread (Figure 22). There is no indication of genitals. The arms are incomplete but appear to slope downwards. Above the shoul ders is a large rock which may be the head, while a distinctive black rock may represent a headdress. The Bowman effigies are unlike most others described in this paper. The rock-filled bodies are reminiscent of the Narrative Figure effigies from 0 o 0_1 meter Figure 22. The Bowman No. 2 effigy, 48PL195 (redrawn from site form). 212</page><page sequence="15">J. Rod Vickers Anthropomorphic Effigies of the Plains Alberta, but the lack of ancillary narrative features and their static frontal views are similar to the Napi Figures in concept. Hudak (1972:345) describes an effigy super ficially similar to the Bowman figures, but located far to the east in Minnesota. The effigy may be named tuyan-witchashta-karpi (Dyck 1981:61; Hudak 1972:345), but I refer to it simply as the Murray County human effigy. The effigy is a 3.5 m long figure oriented with its head to the north west. It consists of a vaguely triangular, boulder filled torso with straight legs and a large rock forming the left foot. The arms extend straight from the body. A row of two cobbles forms the neck and a larger rock the head. Apparently the figure was restored by the local Historical Soci ety according to the memory of the landowner. Hudak indicates that a pre-reconstruction photo graph shows a possible phallus while the partial reconstruction depicted a skirt or kilt in this area. Hudek's illustration depicts the stages of recon struction, and it is apparent that most of the rocks were added in the 1967 restoration and the au thenticity of the final figure must remain doubt ful. Thus, the general similarity to the Bowman figures is more apparent than real. Simms (1903) describes an interesting effigy near Pryor, Montana, which he attributes to the Crow (Figure 23). He indicates that at least two others of a similar nature exist on the Crow Res ervation but none, to my knowledge, has been oth erwise recorded and mapped. The meaning of the figure was obtained from Crow informants. Ac cording to these sources, the figure represents a wife who had been gang raped as punishment for infidelity. Apparently, three large rocks were emplaced to mark the spot, and other persons sub sequently arranged additional rocks to complete the figure. The Pryor effigy consists of a large rock forming the head, a smaller one below, and a third large rock at the crotch. An oval body is formed by two cobble rows connecting the latter with the penultimate rock at the shoulders. Arms extend slightly upward and then turn downward at the ex tremities. The legs extend at 90? from the body and then turn downward. Neither the size nor the orientation of the figure are indicated. Curiously, the few other women depicted in effigies and rock 0 0 0 0 o 0 o o o d^O ? ? ?0 ^ o 0 0 0 o Figure 23. The Pryor effigy; scale and orientation unknown (re drawn from Simms 1903). art have well-defined breasts to indicate gender, and this figure lacks those attributes. The Heron effigy, EkOn-2, in Alberta is an other curious figure which appears unique. The torso of this figure consists of a single row of large cobbles. The left leg bows outward about 40? from the body line while the right leg is straight and is oriented outward only a few degrees (Fig ure 24; Wood 2002). There is a large cobble be tween the legs. The head is formed by a single large cobble. The arms slope downward and smaller stones may represent hands. The effigy figure is 3.25 m long and oriented with the head to the north. The cobbles forming the figure are placed close to or abutting each other. When first photo graphed by John Brumley in the 1970's, the rocks appeared to be very well-exposed on the prairie surface. Nine tipi rings and cairns at the site con tain deeply sodded rocks with some evidence of pot-hunting disturbance which likely occurred some time ago (Dean Wetzel, personal commu nication 2001). A recent examination of the fig ure indicates that the effigy rocks are now well embedded in the sod (Wood 2002). The surficial nature of the rocks forming the effigy when it was first recorded, and the lack of disturbance com pared to the other features at the site, may sug gest that this figure is a recent construction; the area is frequented by local residents for its good views. 213</page><page sequence="16">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST VOL. 53, NO. 206, 2008 o a * I % o_i meter Figure 24. The Heron effigy, EkOn-2 (redrawn from Wood 2002). Kehoe (1965:13) illustrates an unusual fig ure from Saskatchewan, the Wild Man Butte ef figy, DgNc-1 (Figure 25). This is a boulder out line figure with a rectangular body. The legs are outlined with two cobble rows and are shown with feet oriented to the left. The crotch of the figure extends from the inner edge of the right leg across the top of the left leg, suggesting a three-quarter frontal view. Extending horizontally from the lower body is a long cluster of stones with a bul bous terminus; if this is meant to represent a pe nis, it is most unusual. A straight line of stones extends from the back of the lower body, rather like a tail. The right arm extends down and then up while the left arm extends out and up; both are outlined in stone and, like the legs, show both sides of the limb. There is a well-defined neck and heartline. The head is a cobble circle and con tains facial features: eyes, nose, and mouth. The feature is quite large, about 11 m long. It is ori ented with the head to the north. Dyck (1981) cites a description of the site from the journal of William H. Clandening, a pros pector who passed by the area in 1863, which in dicates the right hand held a bow and arrow, and that a sod-cut elk was present on a knoll on the same ridge. It seems unlikely that the figures were contemporary given their different execution. As KX? ?&amp; o_i meter Figure 25. The Wild Man Butte effigy, DgNc-1 (redrawn from Kehoe 1965). well, the cobbles of the human effigy were em bedded in the soil and the sod cut elk was clearly defined; the latter is no longer visible. He notes that when the human effigy was first examined by staff of the Saskatchewan Museum of Natural His tory, the rear extension (tail) and the extension of the penis were not as deeply embedded as the rest of the figure, suggesting recent modifications to the effigy. Dyck (1981:63) observed that other boulder effigies, the Napi Figures of this paper, show similarities to rock art motifs from Writ ing-On-Stone Provincial Park, but that the Wild Man Butte effigy represents a different style of figure. He compares the figure to Ojibwa draw ings on wood or birch bark and concludes that this group is most likely responsible for the Wild Man Butte effigy. If correct, the construction of the figure would date no earlier than about A.D. 1790, the approximate date of Plains Ojibwa penetra tion of this part of Saskatchewan. Todd (1886:1) notes a "...rude human figure..." in association with a turtle effigy in South Dakota. The Turtle Point boulder outline figure shows a circular head with facial features (eyes, mouth), a neck, arms extending outward from the shoulder, a body constricted at the waist, and short leg seg ments pendant from the skirt (Figure 26; Lewis 214</page><page sequence="17">J. Rod Vickers Anthropomorphic Effigies of the Plains 1891:22). Lewis thought the figure possibly au thentic, although Todd indicates it was made by an early American landowner. Given the modest, skirted design of the figure, I am inclined to agree with Todd. The final two effigies which require comment are not illustrated here. The first is the Dewdney Avenue effigy, EcNh-1, in Saskatchewan. This fig ure is most unusual in that it apparently depicts a seated female with an infant in her arms (Brace 2005:69). It should be noted, however, that ex cept for the square head, long neck formed by two parallel lines of stone, the upright shoulder and right arm, and right body side, that the figure is rather amorphous. The right arm ends in a large cluster of stones. The infant's head is also a clus ter of stones with possible eyes. The authenticity of this figure has been questioned; apparently a local resident claimed to have constructed it as a play house when she was a girl (Kit Krozer, per sonal communication 2002). Thus, it is not cer tain that this is truly a human figure or a fortu itous pattern of rocks. Lastly, mention should be made of the Tie Creek site, EaKv-1, situated in the forested Cana dian Shield country of eastern Manitoba (Steinbring 1970). This extraordinary site consists of a large complex of cobbles and boulders placed o?00?o o o o o 4 I o0ooo0ooo.i&amp;,oOOO.o Ao? o 0 ? o o?? o o ?o0 o o o o 0 o o 0 o o ?0 N / \ \ o % \ 0 O \ OOO0 f???*o \ 0 o Figure 26. The Turtle Point female effigy (perhaps c. 4 m long; redrawn from Lewis 1891). on a rock surface and thus not embedded in the ground as occurs at the Plains sites previously described. Although Brace (2005:70,71) and Dyck (1981:62) suggest two of the features at this site may be human effigies, Steinbring (1970:260) indicates that Feature 4 is the only effigy at the site, and suggests that the feature may be a zoomorph, possibly a thunderbird. Feature 4 con sists of two parallel straight lines with a curved shoulder, a heartline, a long neck and head, rather like a Napi Figure. However boulder clusters above the shoulder line may represent possible wings. In my opinion, this figure lacks sufficient attributes to be classified as a human effigy. It is thus not illustrated here, but the reader is referred to Steinbring (1970) for what is one of the best descriptions of a boulder monument site in the literature. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION Napi Figures are classified here on the basis of style. In general, the figures have a cobble out line rectangular body, a neck, upraised arms, heartline, penis, straight legs and out-turned feet. Heads are usually portrayed by cobble clusters or cairns, but in some cases the head cairn is not closely related to the body in either position or size. Wormington and Forbis (1965) considered such figures to be headless, but rock art anthro pomorphic petroglyphs frequently de-emphasize or omit heads and this may be just an artistic con vention (see Magne and Klassen 1991). The Alberta figures, the Bozeman effigy, and Penokee figures face east. The Henry Smith effigies face south and the Cabri Lake figure faces west. Thus, 10 of the 14 effigies have roughly identical ori entations. Despite disturbance and some variation in specific attributes among the figures, they ap pear to bear sufficient attributes in common for one to be reasonably confident in the classifica tion. In four sites, Napi Figures are physically as sociated with stone features other than the usual tipi rings or cairns. At British Block, Ross and Rumsey, the figures are associated with medicine wheels, while at Henry Smith one of the effigies (Henry Smith No. 1) is associated with a drive line. The placement of the figures is different at all three medicine wheels. At the Ross medicine wheel, the 215</page><page sequence="18">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST VOL. 53, NO. 206, 2008 figure is close to the central cairn which may form the effigy's head. At British Block, the effigy is just within the medicine wheel circle but is not oriented to the central cairn. At the Rumsey site, the figure is outside but adjacent to the medicine wheel. The variation in feature relationship sug gests that the association is not functional; that is, the medicine wheel and effigy do not represent a coeval integrated construction. Since most medi cine wheels and most effigies are not mutually associated, the British Block, Ross and Rumsey cases are best considered coincidental. Henry Smith No. 1 is within one of the drive lines (DL1E) at the site. The site is a multicom ponent bison kill site primarily of Avonlea phase affiliation; Prairie side-notched points occur in low frequency at the site. As well as the kill de posits in a coulee, multiple drive lines, tipi rings, and the effigies are present on the prairie surface. Ruebelmann (1988:200) suggests that the effigies could represent the poundmasters in charge of the drive, but I know of no other drive line complex where such effigies are present. Further, the tipi rings straddle two of the drive lines and could not have been occupied while the kill complex was being used. One also might suggest that an effigy would not be constructed within an active drive line. Thus, the tipi rings and effigies likely repre sent a site occupation episode unconnected with the use of the drive lines. Therefore, as in the case of the effigy/medicine wheel sites discussed above, I would suggest that the association is for tuitous. There are no data directly pertaining to the age of the Napi Figures. Kehoe and Kehoe (1959) categorize such effigies as 'dead' in the sense that no detailed narratives are associated with these figures. Although avowing that they had no data relating to chronology, their 'dead' classification might suggest that they considered such narrative less figures to be old. While they were unwilling to estimate the age of boulder figures, the Kehoes did suggest that the figures would be destroyed or buried within a century of construction, and their histories would be lost or distorted in a few gen erations. Tipi ring studies now indicate that sur face stone features may remain recognisable for several thousand years and indicate that the Kehoes were overly pessimistic about the pres ervation of effigy figures under natural conditions on the Plains. However, this observation in itself does little other than suggest the figures could be old. Wormington and Forbis (1965:100) imply that the figures may be of some antiquity, noting: "...the mythological effigy figures relating to Napi may well have been constructed by unrelated peoples and taken over by historic tribes." Klassen (1995) faced a similar age-determi nation problem in his analysis of rock art figures from Writing-On-Stone Provincial Park. Follow ing concepts of Eliade (1959), he differentiated the figures into "iconic" and "narrative" forms; the latter have been discussed previously in this pa per. Iconic figures "...are static, frontal, usually bilaterally symmetrical images.. .and there are no pictorial references to actual or symbolic places or landscapes" (Klassen 1995:147, 1998). His cautious and critical analysis of the motifs repre sented in the rock art indicated that "...pre-con tact images appear to be predominantly iconic in nature..." (Klassen 1995:170), although he does note that narrative expression is not completely absent in prehistoric times and that iconic images persist into the Historic period. Still, the predomi nance of iconic images in prehistory seems clear (see also Keyser 1977; Magne and Klassen 1991). Indeed, in their recent synthesis, Keyser and Klassen (2001: 206) note that the Ceremonial tra dition of iconic images "flourished...during the latter part of the Late Prehistoric period and was the dominant northwestern Plains rock art tradi tion from approximately A.D. 1000 until the early contact period." Certainly the Napi Figure effi gies conform to the definition of iconic figures cited above, and, assuming that a comparison to Plains rock art tradition is valid, their construc tion may possibly be attributed to Late Prehistoric times. Following Kehoe and Kehoe (1959), Wormington and Forbis (1965), and others, I have named these phallic effigies Napi Figures, and the Alberta and Montana figures are so recognized by the Peigan. Yet, as Wormington and Forbis (1965:100) noted "It seems clear... that effigy fig ures are widely spread over the Northern Plains, and are not restricted to Alberta or connected only with the Blackfeet." The question thus remains, are Napi Figures really representations of Napi, 216</page><page sequence="19">J. Rod Vickers Anthropomorphic Effigies of the Plains and can their construction be attributed to the Blackfoot? Forbis (1963) suggested a number of ap proaches to address such questions. The Direct Ethnological Approach relies upon native testi mony to address the issue. Within the traditional territory of the Blackfoot, there seems no doubt that these phallic figures are identified as Napi. Kehoe and Kehoe (1959:123) elicited this iden tification from Chewing Black Bones, Brink (per sonal communication 2000) was told by Reg Crowshoe and other Peigan ceremonialists that the Sandgathe effigy was Napi, and Grinnell (1907) provides mythological context which describes these figures. Yet Forbis (1963:2) was suspicious of this approach to historical understanding: "Na tive tradition appears to be a particularly trouble some sort of evidence in the Canadian prairie...." Essentially, the recognition of the phallic figures by the Blackfoot as Napi does not necessarily imply that all such figures were originally con structed as representations of Napi, or were con structed by the Blackfoot. These identifications might have been ascribed to effigies long after their construction. Forbis' scepticism may have been partly based on an effigy called Napi's Grave (EePd-1), which he recorded on the Blackfoot Reserve in 1959 (Figure 27). This feature is cobble filled, and bears a greater resemblance to the historic Wild Turnip Hill and Young Medicine Man effi gies than it does to the Napi Figures classified in this paper. The attribution of this effigy to Napi may suggest that any effigy not specifically asso ciated with a known historic event is now ascribed to Napi, and that there is no real association of the cobble outline figure style and the Napi as cription. If there is no consistent effigy style as sociated with figures identified as Napi, then there is no particular need to see a Blackfoot/boulder outline figure relationship as anything more than a post hoc identification. Forbis (1963) suggested a second approach, the Inferential Historical Approach, which may be relevant to the issue. This method relies upon co incidental distribution of the features in question with known tribal distributions. The problem here is identifying actual tribal distributions through time (see Magne 1987). Again, Forbis (1963: 5) &lt;? N 0 0 0 oo &lt;$&gt; Figure 27. The Napi's Grave effigy, EePd-1 (scale unknown, re drawn from site form). cautions: "Coincidental distributions do not pro vide conclusive proof...the land shifted hands within a very short period of historic time, and similar shifts may have occurred in prehistoric times." Archaeologists working in the northwestern Plains generally attribute the Old Women's phase to the prehistoric Blackfoot (see Vickers 1986, 1994). Meyer (1988) maps the changing distri bution of the phase which at various times encom passes southwestern Saskatchewan, southern Alberta, and northern Montana. This distribution is more or less equivalent to the distribution of Napi Figures except one, the Penokee effigy, 14GH308, in northwestern Kansas. To skeptics this would appear to be the fatal flaw to the argu ment of coincidental distribution. There are two problems with the Inferential Historical Approach as applied here. The first was recognized by Forbis, the problem of identifying actual tribal distributions. Brink (1986:9) has re viewed the linguistic, historic and ethnographic evidence and concludes: "Blackfoot origins and their late prehistoric geographical position re mains a mystery." While there is a general con sensus that the archaeological materials of the Old Women's phase represent the prehistoric 217</page><page sequence="20">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST VOL. 53, NO. 206, 2008 Blackfoot, it is not clear that that is the only eth nic unit responsible for the material culture rep resented by the Old Women's phase. The second problem with coincidental distri butions in the Inferential Historical Approach was not considered by Forbis. While the movement of bands and tribes is a common part of our un derstanding of the Late Prehistoric and Historic periods on the Plains?the territorial shifts of the Cheyenne, Sioux, Cree, Assiniboine, Sarcee, Ojibwa, Kiowa, Apache, Navaho, and Crow, for example, are all a familiar part of the fabric of Plains history?the travel of individuals and fami lies is not so well documented. The fur trader David Thompson recorded the story of Saukamappee, a Cree from boreal forest country near The Pas, Manitoba who became a respected member of the Peigan on the southern Plains of Alberta some 1,000 km away. Brink (1986:13) documents the presence of an Archithinue (Blackfoot?) man at York Factory on the coast of Hudson Bay in 1766. James Isham, a trader at York Factory in the mid 1700s, in reference to the Archithinue Nation noted "... one or two have had the curiosity to come to York Fort, but never re peated the visit (Smyth 2001:94)." Each of these examples suggest long distance travel by individu als who moved permanently and took up residence among strange peoples, or who simply travelled for curiosity, rather like the modern tourist. Thus, the Penokee effigy may not be a fatal flaw, but may simply indicate an out-of-territory Blackfoot traveler. Wygal (2000) notes that the Cheyenne and Arapaho were present in the vicinity of the Penokee effigy in 1857 and 1869 and observes that these other members of the Algonkian lan guage family may have had a tradition of effigy construction similar to the Blackfoot to the north. However, Wissler and Duvall (1908:11) suggest some divergence in character between Blackfoot tales and those of the Arapaho and Cheyenne. Thus, the Blackfoot Napi tales describing the origin of Napi Figure effigies (Grinnell 1907) apparently do not occur among the Arapaho and Cheyenne. Nevertheless, it is possible that a Blackfoot per son travelling with the Cheyenne could have been the author of this figure. There is no way to resolve the issue of the age and authorship of Napi Figures with confi dence. It seems reasonable to suggest that the fig ures are prehistoric, although the evidence is pri marily inferential. One can but note that most of the figures are coincident with the distribution of the Old Women's phase. Should future discover ies continue to confirm that this style of effigy is coincidental with the Old Women's phase distri bution, and that Penokee remains an isolated out lier, the argument for a Blackfoot origin would at least be enhanced. This assumes, of course, that the aberrant Napi's Grave figure is a recent as cription or represents some other idiosyncratic interpretation by the Blackfoot Elders. Four effigy sites have been classified here as Narrative Figures, while two additional sites ex emplify the narration concept but use cairns to identify the death spot of the victim. All date to the Historic period and commemorate acts of bloodshed; revenge killings, warfare, or murder. One, Punished Women's effigy, represents mur der within a Dakota band, another, EePf-67, war fare between two bands of the Blackfoot confed eracy, and the rest warfare or revenge killings be tween traditional enemy tribes. The effigies themselves are constructed in several styles: rock-filled figures, boulder outline figures, sod-cut figures and rock-covered mounds are all methods used to depict the main protago nists. The latter represent the victims of the vio lence while the monuments themselves were con structed by the victors. Even when formed in the same medium, the figures bear no stylistic resem blance to each other. The sites, however, share in the use of ancillary features which depict the movement of the protagonists through the action; that is, they are constructed as a narrative of a spe cific event. In this, these effigy sites strongly re semble the Biographic tradition and the Robe and Ledger Art tradition of Plains rock art (Keyser and Klassen 2001), albeit with a more limited de sign pallet. Analyses of rock art at Writing-On Stone and elsewhere have contrasted the art of the Late Prehistoric period with that of the Historic period (Keyser 1977; Klassen 1995; Magne and Klassen 1991). Although differing in detail, each analysis suggests that ceremonial or iconic mo 218</page><page sequence="21">J. Rod Vickers Anthropomorphic Effigies of the Plains tifs of the prehistoric period are of secondary importance relative to biographic or narrative motifs in historic times. That is, static represen tations of human and supernatural beings are sub ordinated to actual action narratives of real events (Klassen 1998). Presumably, both the Narrative Figure effigies, and the Biographic/Robe and Led ger rock art represent a major shift in status at tainment in historic Plains culture. Increased mo bility resulting from the introduction of the horse presented new and rapid ways for a male to attain high status through raiding and warfare. This new social paradigm was celebrated in effigy and art themes (see Keyser and Klassen 2001:252; Klassen 1995). Narrative Figure effigies show a wide distribution across the northern Plains and, like the rock art traditions, were created by many different groups participating in classic Plains culture. The remaining effigies described in this pa per remain to me enigmatic. I cannot classify them into either the Narrative Figure or Napi Figure groups. They do, however, illustrate the potential variety of forms which may be constructed from cobbles, and thus provide contrast with the Napi Figure style. Ian Dyck's (1981) analysis of the Wild Man Butte effigy suggests that historical documents may yet come to the fore and cast light on specific figures. And, as the Kehoes (1959) demonstrated, Native tradition may yet illuminate others. CONCLUSION Human effigies are rare features in the ar chaeological landscape of the Plains. They appear to be mostly a phenomenon of the northern and central Plains; my State Historical Preservation Officer colleagues farther south were unable to discover records of such figures elsewhere. The southernmost known figures extend to Wyoming and Kansas, but perhaps no farther. All jurisdic tions should consider human effigy sites to merit preservation measures based on rarity alone. It is apparent that human effigies may take a variety of forms and that some contain sufficient stylistic commonality to be classified into coher ent groups. The presence of action attributes, and historic tales explaining the actions depicted at the Narrative Figures, indicate commonality with the Biographic tradition and the Robe and Ledger Art tradition of Plains rock art. The static, frontal, bilaterally symmetrical Napi Figures suggest simi larity to the iconic Ceremonial tradition of Late Prehistoric rock art. Other figures remain enig matic, their meaning, construction and histories a mystery. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I wrote this paper in honour of Richard G. Forbis; I was fortunate to number Dick among my professors in graduate school at the University of Calgary. Les Davis and Brian Reeves kindly invited me to participate in the Forbis session at the 58th Annual Plains Anthropological Conference in Sioux Falls in 2000, from which this paper is an outgrowth. Les also kindly edited an earlier version of the paper. Many SHPO and CRM archaeologists and their staffs have conducted site file searches and taken the time to copy documents which would have been otherwise unavailable to me. I gratefully express my appreciation to Joan Damkjar (Alberta), Susan Collins and Mary Sullivan (Colorado), Virginia A. Wulfkuhle (Kansas), Mark Baumler (Montana), Rob Bozell (Nebraska), Glenna Dean (New Mexico), Paul R. Picha and Fern E. Swenson (North Dakota), John Brandon (Saskatchewan), Jim Haug (South Dakota), Patricia A. Mercado Allinger (Texas), and Mark Millar and Steven J. Sutter (Wyoming). John H. Brumley, Ian Dyck, Todd Guenther, Michael Klassen and Brian Wygal graciously shared their data. Tim Panas did a deal of the legwork for the project. Trevor R. Peck and Dairy 1 Bereziuk read several drafts of the paper and their comments were most useful. The Archaeological Society of Alberta kindly granted permission to include text and figures from Brink and Dormaar (2003). Lastly, I would like to thank Lee Ward for reporting the effigy on his land and provoking my interest in these curious monuments. I would also like to thank John H. Brumley and Michael Klassen for their careful review of the manuscript. I also greatly appreciate the encouragement and help preparing the manuscript of my good friend and colleague Trevor R. Peck. Of course, any errors or omissions are solely my responsibility. REFERENCES CITED Baumler, Mark F. 1997 Flying D Archaeological Project Site Form 1997 Site Update (24GAO 106).

NOTES 'There are at least four additional effigies in Alberta and Saskatchewan that are not yet described in the literature, and other figures probably exist on the Plains which have not yet been rediscovered (see Brace 2005:155). 2 The effigy number is taken from the original feature maps with the United States Bureau of Land Management site form. Ruebelmann (1988) reversed the effigy numbers in his publication. 3 This term is used in the original. In Canada, this would indicate a person of English/Scottish and Native ancestry in contrast to French and Native ancestry, the latter being termed Metis. This nicety may not have been employed by American writers. 221</page></plain_text>
