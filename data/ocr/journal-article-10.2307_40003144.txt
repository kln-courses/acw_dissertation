<plain_text><page sequence="1">Memory, Landscape, Love: John Ruskin's Poetry and Poetic Criticism WENDELL STACY JOHNSON FEW cultivated readers in general and few literary scholars know that John Ruskin wrote a considerable amount of verse, enough poems to fill a (double) volume, the second, in Cook and Wedderburn's edition of his Works.1 The total quantity of this verse in print is just about as great as that published by Matthew Arnold and is greater than that of Gerard Manley Hopkins. Ruskin expected when he was young to make his career as a poet, his parents continued to hope for such a career even after he had abandoned the idea, and his earliest attempts at serious writing were in poetic form. Yet some of the most thorough studies of Ruskin, including John Rosenberg's, omit any mention of his poems. Why has all of this available writing by a great writer been neglected? One answer might be that most of Ruskin's verse was composed in childhood and adolescence: after the age of twenty he produced little in the form and after his later twenties very little indeed. But in this respect, too, he can be compared with other Victorians. Certainly, others published important poetry early in their lives. Tennyson's first three volumes, including the Poems of 1832, appeared when the author was in his late 'teens and very early twenties. Browning's first half-dozen separately published poems were written well before he was thirty. This work cannot be classified as juvenilia; neither can most of Ruskin's. It could, instead, be argued that Ruskin's achievement as a critic so overshadows the rest of his production, including his often superb drawings and water colors, that the efforts at verse can easily be forgotten. The argument is in a sense valid. Yet, precisely because of the achievement E. T. Cook and Alexander Wedderburn, The Works of Ruskin (London, 1903-12); otherwise unidentified quotations come from Volume II of this edition (1903), which includes all that was published in the 1850 and 1891 volumes of Ruskin's verse, without basic textual alteration but with some additions. 19</page><page sequence="2">20/ VICTORIAN POETRY in critical prose, including Ruskin's intermittent and apparently fragmentary criticism of poets, the poetry does have some interest. The verse illuminates the criticism; in fact, some knowledge of the poetry helps to fill in the outlines of a large, a varied, and a puzzling life and career. The briefest and best reason that Ruskin's poetry has been neglected, however, is simply that it lacks much poetic value: he wrote no successful poem and not very many good passages or memorable lines. Ruskin is a poetic critic in both a loose sense (he writes "poetic" prose) and a quite specific one (he criticizes poetry), but he is not primarily a poet. And, significantly, he is enough of a critic to know this very well - even if his reaction to the knowledge is often critically excessive. His animadversions on poetry of a certain kind are barely veiled censures of his own verse. But Ruskin's feelings about his poetic talent are as painfully conflicted as his responses to personal emotion- filial, erotic, religious - and to Wordsworth's Romanticism. An 1850 Poems ("by J. R."), the first collection of his verse, was published privately by John James Ruskin, the writer's father, when his son was in his early thirties, in the very middle of what Francis G. Townsend calls "the crucial years of his life," and had abandoned writing poems for writing on art and architecture.2 This collection, consisting of fifty copies that are now rare, included only five poems written after Ruskin was twenty-one (these five are from 1845, when he was twenty-six); and the whole project was probably regarded by the author of the masterpiece-in- progress Modern Painters as a nostalgic exercise of paternal enthusiasm, both private and small-scale. The books were certainly intended for friends of the family. All were presented as gifts: copies bound in green (with a gold harp on the front binding) for women and in purple for men.3 When a more public display was proposed - that is, a true "publication" - the critic and former poet demurred. He finally allowed W. G. Collingwood to undertake the project, the 1891 Poems of John Ruskin in two volumes, but with reluctance. His ambivalent attitude may have reflected not only dissatisfaction with his youthful efforts but also some need to make a filial gesture to a father then twenty-seven years dead, a father who looms large in the verse and especially in the earliest verse. Clearly, his grudging permission for Collingwood to print much more than the contents of the 1850 volume does not signal any change in the mature John Ruskin's 2 Ruskin and the Landscape Feeling: A Critical Analysis of His Thought During the Crucial Years of His Life, 1843-1856 (Univ. of Illinois Press," 1951). Henry Ladd in The Victorian Morality of Art (New York, 1932), John D. Rosenberg in The Darkening Glass: A Portrait of Ruskin's Genius (Columbia Univ. Press, 1961), and Townsend agree that the turning point that is crucial to an understanding of Ruskin comes between the writing of Modern Painters 1 1 (1846) and Modern Painters 111 (1856). 3See James S. Dearden, "The Production and Distribution of John Ruskin's Poems 1850," BC, 17(1968), 151-167.</page><page sequence="3">WENDELL STACY JOHNSON / 21 judgment on what he regarded as his immature writing.4 That judgment is evident in Praeterita, as it is in letters he wrote to, among others, his father, W. H. Harrison (editor of Friendship's Offering, where most of the verse was first published), Collingwood himself, and a Miss (Sarah?) Corlass of Hull. To this last correspondent he sent an interesting piece of advice on the training of children: I can only venture to give you one very plain practical piece of counsel, of the value of which I am profoundly convinced - Don't let any child you have to do with write poetry. If it does, call it a fool, and throw the verses into the fire without reading them: and you will find it will write no more.5 Whether, in fact, John Ruskin would have written no more poetry if he had been so treated in childhood instead of being encouraged by proud parents, we can hardly know. We do know that for complex reasons he was inclined to ignore - and yet not wholly to reject, for the 1891 collection was published - his own poems about his love of landscape, of his father, of Adeie Domecq. We can surmise that this partial rejection mirrors his adolescent life - the inner life of a young man's changing, clashing emotions as well as the public life of a writer launching his literary career - while it contributes to critical attitudes, specifically his deep and deeply mixed feelings about Romantic or expressive art as they are revealed in his criticism. I The verse that Ruskin wrote and published (there is hardly ever much of a lapse between composition and publication) in his first ten years as an aspiring author, from age seven to age seventeen, sets subjects and a tone for the rest. His subjects are the Wordsworthian ones of memory and landscape, as well as love both filial and, in dawning adolescence, timidly erotic. The young Ruskin's style and his consequent tone, however, derive less from Wordsworth than from minor Romantic poets - Southey, Rogers, Scott - and, increasingly, from the lyrical Byron. In the "Iteriad," written when Ruskin was eleven and twelve and set in the Lake Country, there is Wordsworthian landscape if little of Wordsworthian reflectiveness, but the object of "Hero- Worship" is Southey. Echoes of Rogers' Italy are heard throughout the continental travel verse. And the earliest and most pervasive influence on Ruskin is that of Scott, still appreciated mainly as 4Collingwood added to the contents of the 1850 volume more than a hundred poems and passages, mostly from Ruskin's early years, up to age eighteen; the first edition contained fifty-one pieces of verse. 5The letter is in the Huntington Library (HM 3 1088) and is tentatively dated c. 1850; part of it, but not the final clause, is included in a note by Van Akin Burd, ed., The Ruskin Family Letters (Cornell Univ. Press, 1973), 1, 159. Ruskin wrote a" number of letters to Miss Corlass, on the education of children, religious hypocrisy, and other matters that were, for him, important and personal. Many of these are in the Huntington collection.</page><page sequence="4">22 / VICTORIAN POETRY the poet of his father's native land. Almost all of the boy-poet's lines sound derivative. Almost none strikes a strongly or altogether original note. But there is no doubt that the subjects of this verse - the fascination with time and memory, the deeply felt response to natural settings, and the contrasting need for human love - are authentic. Authentic and raw: they have yet to be transmuted into the rich metal of art. Cook and Wedderburn print some half-dozen of these early efforts at the beginning of their second volume; the rest appear at the end under their heading "Verses Written in Boyhood." Here they quote the earlier editor, Collingwood, who insists that for "a preliminary understanding of his ways, and aims, and attitude," the poems are "the best introduction to [Ruskin's] later and greater books" ( Works, II, 253). There is no suggestion that the aims may be confused and the attitudes self-contradictory. The earliest poetry of all - verse on common objects, the Scottish scenes of Glenfarg, Skiddaw, Derwent, and an ambitious fragment called "Eudosia: On the Universe" (it never goes beyond a discussion of trees) is little more than fanciful. A speculation on "Time," however, shows some precocious awareness of ambiguity in the word and idea, as well as the pressing sense of temporality contained, so the editors comment, in his lifelong motto, "To-day, To-day, To-day" ( Works, II, 259). A sense of past, of passing time, is suggested too by Ruskin's apology, from age eleven: "May I not employ my brain / In calling past delights again?"6 His are the delights of travel and home: Ruskin's childhood verse is filled with reflection on Scottish landscape and, in a series of addresses to his father, reflections of domestic love. But the function of the poet's memory, at work on such matters, is not for him to be so simple. The slow development of his thought and feeling leads toward the distinguishing of memory as a passive and pleasant record of outward things from memory as an active, sometimes painful, reinterpretation: the distinguishing of landscape as fixed object from landscape as symbol; the distinguishing of love as a simple feeling or "romantic" idea from love as a profoundly mixed, frustrating, even profoundly wounding experience. Memory, landscape, love: these interrelated themes along with some minor plays of fancy make up the stuff of Ruskin's juvenile poetry as they were to make up the fabric of his more nearly mature efforts. The Romantic theme, carrying over into Victorian poetry, of time as both destroyer and creator of all things - Shelley's theme in "Ozymandias" and "The West Wind" but also Wordsworth's, for time destroys the glory that is youth as well as empires, monuments, and men - now seems familiar enough to be banal. And Ruskin's verses repeat that literary theme fairly 6These lines (from 1830) are printed in the prefatory section of the Cook and Wedderburn volume ( Works, II, xxxii).</page><page sequence="5">WENDELL STACY JOHNSON / 23 often in lines for which memory is the fanciful vision of a past comfortably removed from the boy-poet's immediate experience. Thus the poems on pleasing ruins: "The Eternal Hills" in contrast with the ephemeral plains of ordinary life, evoking a mixture of brilliance, exultation, and gloomy fearfulness; Babylon and "The Destruction of Pharaoh"; old scenery that inspires awe, but also the floating cloud and fleeting breeze. The Alps elicit brief comments on "dreary darkness" and the elusive light of "memory" (in "Alpine-Glow," written when Ruskin was seventeen), on the fear and loneliness that an "Alpine Lake" can evoke. And if mountain scenes inspire some brooding notion of how the passage of time means human death, those poems of childhood and early adolescence that reflect on man's own aging come, it seems, even closer to home. For the adolescent poet, aged seventeen, even a birthday address to his father means something less and more than the conventional happy greeting - or so it does in his lines oddly entitled "Congratu-"! It is as though, in this "Letter to his Father," the writer stops in the midst of the word to ask its meaning. Is a birthday truly a time for congratulations? Is the movement of inexorable time a cause for felicitation, or for mourning, or for both? The idea of time is difficult, the function of memory sometimes puzzling, for an adult as well as a child; Ruskin's sense of the need to work "To-day," his compulsive attempts to concentrate all effort and all understanding into one here and now so that past and future are momentarily obliterated, may be a reaction to anxieties about what is remembered, what is feared. This nervous tendency is evident in the early verse, where Ruskin conventionally recognizes, while avoiding a full or fully considered recognition, that the end of time, and a part of memory as well, is death: the inevitable death of a landscape experience, of passion, of a person. It seems unnecessary to remark that a child or adolescent fails to deal altogether seriously in his poems with death and the implications of memory. But Ruskin's very precocity in writing about religious and philosophical implications of temporal phenomena invites further expectations - and, in some poems of early adolescence, he does develop an elegiac form that expresses otherwise inchoate feelings on the expense of years, the death of emotions. This is increasingly true in his verse about not landscape but love. Until the young man's seventeenth year, he had only his father and household pets as objects of affection, these and the outdoors scenes he loved, which distracted and relieved him from wider human intercourse. When he was seventeen he fell in love with Adele Domecq - or, perhaps, with the idea of love. In his verse she is described by metaphors drawn from landscape, so that she merges into ocean and mountain and is thus a familiar and acceptable love object - but not quite a real person like</page><page sequence="6">24 / VICTORIAN POETRY the "Papa" of earlier verse. She becomes real as she becomes a focus for regret, after Ruskin's intended engagement has been firmly vetoed by his and her families. II I love to look out o'er the earth and the sky, For Nature is kind, and seems lonely, as I; Whatever in Nature most lovely I see, Has a voice that recalls the remembrance of thee. Oh! sweet is remembrance, most sad though it be, For remembrance is all that remaineth for me. {Works, II, 23-24) These bittersweet and hardly brilliant lines of the very Romantic (and very adolescent) poem "Remembrance," on the "Loss of Adele," may sound like posing. They mark the beginning of a real if failing attempt to sublimate human love in the love of nature, the familiar Romantic turning away from human commitment to contemplation of the landscape. But for Ruskin there is something more lasting in this attempt than such an easy comment might suggest, something of a tension that lasts well into his later life, suffusing his poetic prose and helping to define it. For Ruskin, the merging of human feeling into natural object becomes necessary just because the remembrance of love's promise, too deeply or directly confronted, the realization of a sexual feeling smothered by his parents - in effect, by his father - is too painful. Behind the appearance of conventional lines about young love, regret, and the appeal of sympathetic landscape and seascape there is - surely from his seventeenth year onward - a personal reality from which poetry of more value might be made, and from which great prose is made. One indication that present and recent affections can be deeply felt, too deeply to be probed yet in language less than conventional, is the tendency of Ruskin as an adolescent to write elegiac verse about the long ago, the far away, and the exotic, and verse that is still replete with apparently unattached or hardly explained emotions: his morbidity takes classical or historical forms, and his exile from both a childhood paradise and any adult fulfillment of love becomes the exile of the gipsy, of Napoleon, of the ancient Scythian. His "Gipsies" are without belief, without a home: what Ruskin himself is in the process of losing as an adolescent is his belief in the easy orthodoxies of popular religion and Romantic verse. He has a sense of not being at home any longer, not a child with a secure place and definite role. It is not freedom only that he looks for, but rather a lasting discipline that combines faith and self-definition, a knowledge of being at one with natural forces and with oneself. In "The Gipsies" and in the lively "Scythian Grave" (from Herodotus), "The Exile</page><page sequence="7">WENDELL STACY JOHNSON I 25 of St. Helena" (written for a Newdigate Prize competition), "The Scythian Banquet Song," "Aristodemus at Plataea," "Horace: - 'Iter ad Brundusium'," "Salsette and Elephanta" (again a competition poem, one that did win the Newdigate Prize), Ruskin displays a remarkable undergraduate's ability to translate personal feeling into the approved verse forms and the expected classical or historical subjects - as well as including when necessary, for his prize poem, a flatly pious final tag. These and other verses still carry an elegiac strain - as does the "Fragment from a Meteorological Journal": Thus it is That we would gladden with forgetfulness The heart - whose memory maddens us - and weave A mist of thoughts and voices which may leave Nothing that once was rosy wreathed joy, To pale and wither into agony. Yet evermore - its beauty veiled in vain - The past - the lost, the loved - looks forth again. {Works, II, 86) The passage sets a basically serious tone for verse of Ruskin's majority: "The Scythian Guest," "The Tears of Psammenitus," a somewhat vague narrative "The Broken Chain" (in five parts), a touching "Last Song of Arion," poems on the loss of Adele, and the distinctly elegiac "Hills of Carrara" and "La Madonna delF/Acqua" as well as Alpine pieces. The most interesting lines from this post-adolescent period are those on mountain gloom and (less often) mountain glory, where Ruskin synthesizes memory, landscape, and love. "The Alps" (from age twenty- five) apostrophizes: The glory of a cloud - without its wane; The stillness of the earth - but not its gloom; The loveliness of life - without its pain; The peace - but not the hunger - of the tomb! {Works, 11,232) It ends with a speculation about the day when the last trump sounds and human time is ended: Shall not your God spare you, to whom He gave No share nor shadow of man's crime, or fate; Nothing to render, nor to expiate; Untainted by his life - untrusted with his grave? But mountain landscape does not triumph over death, for all the poet's dreaming, and Ruskin's Alps are as full of natural death (and its peace) as of natural comfort. One great attraction of the Swiss mountains for Romantic writers lies in their seeming to objectify the exile's loneliness while diverting him from its specific source. The mountain landscape gives a glory to gloom. This is Wordsworthian and, even more, Arnoldian, doctrine, and it appears repeatedly in Ruskin. In "Mont Blanc Revisited" (from age twenty-six) the mysterious peak has an all but religious appeal,</page><page sequence="8">26 / VICTORIAN POETRY but an appeal that the poet - rather like Tennyson in "The Palace of Art" - must reject for fear of losing touch with purely human love. The speaker, here and in "The Arve at Cluse" (written at the same age), longs for the peace of the mountains that contains and controls the apparent passions of the roaring stream, with a religious longing to be purged of obsession with his own passions: in Arnoldian lines he sees the Arve as an image of my race! Who born, like thee, near Heaven, have lost, like thee, Their heritage of peace. But I would cast upon thy waves the cloud Of passions that are like thee, and baptize My spirit from its tumult. {Works, II, 236) Still, streams are not human - as Ruskin will strenuously argue in his criticism - and the Alps are not divine; even "Mont Blanc" is not a kind or comprehensible God, as another poem (so titled) from Ruskin's twenty- sixth year recognizes, finding in the white or blankness of the majestic peak a great "vacant form" that is cold. So stands the Providence Of God around us; mystery of Love! Obscure, unchanging, darkness and defence, - Impenetrable and unmoved above The valley of our watch. ( Works, II, 237) Possibly the fullest working out of ambiguities, of irony, in the complex of memory, landscape, and love is a slightly earlier poem, published when Ruskin was twenty-five; this is his "Walk in Chamouni,"a work inspired by his travel in the Alps. The poem goes beyond both a Wordsworthian sense of landscape nature as kindly and a Calvinistic sense of love as self-repressive; it voices the young man's feeling that "the secret of happiness lay, not in retreat and deprivation, but in fullness of experience." So Gerald Levin observes. Levin concludes that Ruskin's Eden was to be sought at the price of emptiness and cold - its solitudes rising "passionless and pure," unblessed with all the mourning and mirth that life can bring. If the "brightest birth" must be rooted in corruption and the fruitful life can be one neither of fulfillment nor of rest, he would choose the lowly earth.7 7"The Imagery of Ruskin's 'A Walk in Chamouni'," VP, 5 (1967), 284-285, 290. Levin's analysis of the poem (the only extended critical treatment given any of Ruskin's poetry in a widely available forum during the past seventy-five years) is sensitive and useful. It shows how Ruskin sets up alternative possibilities no, one of which he can at last accept. This happens in different ways, in passage after passage, as the poet-critic recalls and tries to reconcile affecting human relationships and visions of landscape. Does landscape nature objectively perceived by the pure and passive mind transcend all transitory human feelings? Then feeling must be abandoned. Or does living "subjective" humanity make the external world seem really dead and cold? Then nature and art must be subordinated to moral ends - as in religious pictures or, more relevantly to later Ruskin, in the replacement of aesthetic objects by social aims. (Once again, the either/ or closely parallels a post-Romantic perplexity experienced by Arnold.)</page><page sequence="9">WENDELL STACY JOHNSON / 27 But the choice was only for the moment. It functions only in this poem. The Eden associated with landscape and childhood is actually lost, and Ruskin's hope for a new Eden in the emotional, sexual relationship with a loved one - even at the expense of Eden-like "objective" purity - cannot be realized. Ill Ruskin's poetic output in later years, the verse written and published after he was twenty-six, is relatively meager, and the work that we might expect to be in every sense mature is not in fact much more impressive, or even much more revealing, than what he wrote in his mid-twenties. The only poem by Ruskin that is ever anthologized, "Trust Thou thy Love," belongs in this category; and it is both flat and unrepresentative. The most intriguing of these verses - it appeared when the poet was only twenty- seven - is written "For a Birthday in May." From the context and general tenor of Ruskin's verse, one might assume that the title is a reference to the poet's father (his birthday was in May, Adele's in March); but the language makes this impossible. The imagery of the work is distinctly unsentimental, and the person addressed is neither a father nor a beloved but a "sister." Thorn, and meadow grass - sweet sister, Twine them as 1 may, Deemest thou a darksome garland For thy natal day? Thou thyself art fairer, sister, Than all the flowers of May; Had I brought thee buds and blossoms, Shamed were 1 and they! Think not of their grace, sweet sister, Nor their colours gay, Since their utmost glory, sister, Is to pass away. Even thorns are fair, sister, With the heaven behind. Here the fragment breaks off, to continue, May that happy path, sister, Evermore be thine, Through the mighty Shepherd's pasture And by streams divine! Though perhaps there may be, sister, Shadows upon mine! Kindly He for all, dear sister, Will the end design, Who for both our sakes, sister, Brooked the Spear and Spine. ( Works, II, 243-244) This epistolary verse, composed as if to a nun, is not the sort of erotic or filial thing that Ruskin could write to young female friends or father.</page><page sequence="10">28 / VICTORIAN POETR Y Of the other "verses of later years," both "Awake, Awake" ("The Peace Song") and "The Zodiac Song" are occasional lyrics to be sung by the girls of Winnington School, and the odd "Twist Ye, Twine Ye" (Meg Merilees' song in Scott's Guy Mannering), in italics with highly allegorical diction, is an exercise rather than a personal poem; it is, even so, recognizably the work of Ruskin, with its mixture of darkness and light that is as affective as descriptive. It was also written to be sung by the girls of Winnington. Finally, some eccentric lines that were not published by Ruskin but exist in a Huntington Library draft are enigmatic and may not be, strictly speaking, poetry at all. They appear almost to be a transcription or translation. Be thou glad, oh my love; - and if you are going Take with thee no sadness in Thy heart, If 1 knew it, it would be evil, for me, That thou shouldest go discontented On thy way, Go thou then, &amp; return quickly And leave the sighing to me, who remain.8 The sense of these mysterious words is virtually fatalistic; the subject may be a love lost either permanently or temporarily. Without a context, it is difficult to say much more. All in all, the later verse is likely to be either dutifully conventional or personal and intriguing but at the same time cryptic. IV What does Ruskin's poetry and his own reaction to that mostly youthful and (in almost every instance) derivative verse - revealed in letters that touch upon its virtues and its faults - have to do with Ruskin's later career as a critic, specifically as a critic of poetry as well as painting? Most of his criticism of poetry appears in Modern Painters, published between 1843 and 1860. There is some such criticism, en passant, in the volumes that appeared in 1849 (The Seven Lamps of Architecture) and 1867 (Time and Tide), but the later work tends to shift its focus from art criticism, with literary parallels, to the criticism of society. Ruskin seldom wrote extensively on poetry as distinct from painting, on literature as literature alone. In Modern Painters he is interested first in perceiving nature visually, accurately, then in the moral implications of this 8This manuscript passage, written on 8va. stationery imprinted "Brantwood,/ Coniston,/ Lancashire," is JR532 in the Huntington Library collection.</page><page sequence="11">WENDELL STACY JOHNSON I 29 perception. Here is the master in mid-career, in the middle decades of the century, which represent "high Victorian" modes of thought. To define thought in this period, and certainly to define Ruskin's thought, is no simple matter. Detractors were to complain of his literary bent in criticizing all the arts, but he tries in these crucial years to find in poetry as verbal form a fidelity to what is visibly accessible, the revealing of a personal, authentic vision of the world, a humanizing vision. Almost inevitably, it is true, the two continuing interests, the criteria that he himself distinguishes as Nature and Nobility, come into conflict. Usually, but not always, the conflict between the natural, all that is external to the perceiver, that which is God- given or "objective," and the noble, all that makes up the perceiver's inner nature and style, that which is genial or "subjective," is resolved- partly, uneasily, temporarily resolved - in favor of the natural and external.9 But the tension between the two sides still remains, as both the need for divine Nature and the need for personal qualities assert themselves. Ruskin's best-known passage of poetic criticism, a chapter on "The Pathetic Fallacy," appears in the middle of Modern Painters. Its date is 1856. Now the critic faces his dilemma of reconciling "objective" and "subjective" truths by denying that any such distinction has meaning. He calls the distinction (more or less correctly) an invention of German philosophy. One of the most ambiguous and sonorous of all great writers, he condemns these "troublesome words" that introduce such "ambiguities" and allow for merely "sonorous" phrases to replace straightforward exposition. The German philosophers (he means the Romantic philosophers), he tells us, argue that it does not much matter what things are in themselves, but only what they are to us; and that the only real truth of them is their appearance to, or effect upon, us. From which position, with a hearty desire for mystification, and much egotism, selfishness, shallowness, and impertinence, a philosopher may easily go so far as to believe, and say, that everything in the world depends upon his seeing or thinking of it, and that nothing, therefore, exists, but what he sees or thinks of. ( Works, V, 202) As he often does, Ruskin here pushes an imaginary adversary into an imagined and extreme position and then reacts with an extreme rhetoric - thus virtually forcing himself to express a one-sided and radical view that he must elsewhere contradict. In doing so, he apparently rejects not only most of German Romantic philosophy but also much of English Romantic poetry, including the poetry upon which he has tried to model his own verse. In brief - and this is nothing unusual in Ruskin - he seems to be rejecting himself. ^Genial is one of Coleridge's favorite adjectives. It means the authentic expression of individual genius; and, as the last phrase may indicate, it suggests the paradoxical identity of individual {genius-genial) with class (genus-general), so that the most personal insight can be, for Coleridge or Wordsworth, the most profound version of generality, of the universal. This is a paradox Ruskin cannot accept.</page><page sequence="12">30 / VICTORIAN POETRY The critic's major criterion here is, for the moment, one of truth in the sense of mimetic accuracy; this accuracy, or fidelity to nature, is a matter that deeply concerns many Victorians.10 Ruskin rejects "false appearances" in poetry as in painting: these are impressions "entirely unconnected with any real power or character in the object, and only imputed to it by us." This can be in effect a refusal of that very "connection" which is the essence of Wordsworth's Romantic faith, a faith in the harmony between a subject's soul and an object's power. Yet Ruskin would not be Ruskin if he were consistent on such a point. In an early contribution (1838) to the London Architectural Magazine, he comments on Scott as a poet: His descriptive pieces . . . have been far excelled by many writers, for the simple reason, that Scott, while he brings his landscape clearly before the reader's eyes, puts no soul into it ... while other poets give a meaning and a humanity to every part of nature, which is to its l()Ruskin defended or, more often, condemned his own youthful attempts at poetry on such grounds. In an 1837 letter to Harrison about "The Scythian Grave," he asked that "the note about Winter Lightning. . .be added to prevent appearance of negligence of Locality," referring to one of the explanatory notes he liked to supply explaining that he had not ignored phenomena as they present themselves to the common eye, that he was not being frivolously fanciful. (One might be reminded of his line of defense for Turner's painting of the sky in odd colors: that is exactly how the sky does look in some unusual conditions.) But he admits to errors and is anxious about inaccurate transcription of phenomena when he writes about his own "Last Song of Arion" - again, in a letter to Harrison, dated by Cook and Wedderburn only as "before 1850" - that the simile "Thy tears would pierce like rushing rain" is false - "as if rain ever did pierce to a dead man's ear ... or as if a dying man would have thought of the tears being like anything but themselves, or as if a loving man would ever have compared his mistress's tears to a thunder-shower" ( Works, II, 123). He goes on to comment that the only comparison of a mistress to the sun "rightly managed," in the "pure way," is Chaucer's line, "Up rose the Sonne, and up rose Emilie!" The exemplary reference to Chaucer's witty turn may raise, for a modern reader, the question whether a writer can ever escape that animating, even subjective humanizing, of nature that is intrinsic in language (literally, the sun does not rise up; and only animate beings can arise in the sense that Emily does). It seems unlikely that a poet can avoid this "subjective" or anthropomorphic quality of language, and quite impossible that a Romantic poet can do so. Patrick Conner's Savage Ruskin (London, 1979) emphasizes just such anthropomorphic quality in Ruskin's criticism and finds in the emotionally damaged Romantic (child and man, poet and critic) an emotional energy, an extravagance, even a brutality of language that the man's theory may attempt to deny in his criticism, including his self-criticism. E. T. Cook (in his 1911 Life) refers to Ruskin's self-criticism, exemplified by his comment on a phrase in "The Hills of Carrara," "What waves may stir the silent sea": "Waves do not stir the sea," the critic of himself writes; "they are a result of the sea's being stirred" (Cook, I, 102). (Waves provide the central metaphor in the "Pathetic Fallacy," where Ruskin compares a series of passages on his very form of seascape.) The Ruskin who comes to be ashamed of "such nonsense" and deeply suspicious of personifications - as a false ascribing of human moods to nature - still guards and qualifies his judgment in letters. See, on the Victorian concern for truth to nature, Jerome H. Buckley's seminal and broad-ranging study The Victorian Temper. A Study in Literary Culture^ Harvard Univ. Press, 1951), pp. 135-138;and Carol T. Christ, 77?^ Finer Optic: The Aesthetic of Particularity in Victorian Poetry (Yale Univ. Press, 1975), especially its conclusion: many Victorians fear "that the universe is not divine but arbitrary, and the only proof of revelation ... is the intensity of personal experiences" (p. 152).

He seems here to be relegating his beloved Scott to a secondary order of poets precisely because he does not fall into the pathetic fallacy of giving human meaning to external forms! One can argue, however, that Ruskin implies, even within his chapter on the subject, a more liberal and accommodating criticism than such excerpts might indicate. In comparing this chapter with the chapter on "The Real Nature of Greatness of Style" - where, after stressing the importance of the artist's (the painter's) loving beauty, choosing great subjects, and being sincere, the critic allows for invention "produced by the imagination" as a "characteristic of great art" - one can argue that Ruskin gives equal importance to Nature and Nobility. He assumes that fidelity to natural phenomena is wholly consistent with the expression of noble, personal style. He assumes that only a noble individual does wholly perceive and represent nature truly, fully. He repeatedly says that an artist, whether painter or poet, reveals individual and noble style not by trying to communicate a special, subjective vision - a style all one's own - but by keeping an eye upon the object. His teaching is not only consistent with Carlyle's, against self-consciousness, but is also comparable with Newman's in The Idea of a University and with Arnold's in "The Function of Criticism at the Present Time": just as the gentleman-scholar achieves practical results by concentrating upon knowledge not for practical reasons but for its own sake, just as the man of culture makes his critical intelligence function in the present by attending to culture in a disinterested spirit that rises above present functions, so the artist may achieve noble style, which is in a sense subjective, by trying only to represent truly noble objects in their intrinsic natures. Ruskin does, too, trim and subdue the rhetoric of his opening salvo in "The Pathetic Fallacy." He asserts that there are two orders of poets, the creative - like Shakespeare, Homer, Dante - and the reflective - Wordsworth, Keats, Tennyson - and he allows genius to the second order. It is a lesser sort of genius that these reflective or subjective poets demonstrate. The "greatest poets do not often admit [the ] kind of falseness" in which "the second order of poets" delight. And it is in his use of quotations from this poetry of the second order that Ruskin demonstrates perhaps the greatest irony of this essay, more remarkable 11 Works, I, 258-259. The word breathing carries in Ruskin as in Keats some sense of paradox; by having breath one lives, changes, dies. Elizabeth K. Helsinger argues that Ruskin "associates the poetry of pathetic fallacy with ... [a modern, that is, Romantic] preference for vagueness, darkness, and change" which for him characterize pure subjectivity. Yet his "distaste for his Protean identity," his discontent with "solitary self-discovery" is belied by the structure, meandering and seemingly w/?structured, of his autobiography Praeterita. His "sense of self is "touched by places, not people," Helsinger says; but surely this is only partly true, and true because of fear, a stifling of emotion. As Helsinger also argues, Ruskin demonstrates in spiritual autobiography the self-consciousness that, following Carlyle, he rejects as a critic. See "Ruskin and the Poets: Alterations in Autobiography," MP, 74 (1976), 142-170, esp. 142, 144, 149-152.</page><page sequence="14">32/ VICTORIAN POETRY than the irony of his condemning (as Arnold does) the very sort of poetry he himself has written. He finds degrees of falsehood and effectiveness in the "pathetic" poets, placing Coleridge somewhat below Wordsworth, and Pope, of course, far below either.12 To illustrate the differences and illuminate his theory, he chooses arbitrarily (again, as Arnold does in citing his touchstones), so that a passage or two, along with the critic's very limited response to it, serves to put each artist in his place. The method and tone of what might well be called this critic's most antisubjective pronouncement are highly and obviously subjective. Yet all of this can suggest only one aspect of a complex genius. The chapter stands in striking contrast - indeed, in conflict- with other passages by the same critic. It concludes that the pathetic fallacy is powerful only so far as it is pathetic, feeble so far as it is fallacious, and, therefore, that the dominion of Truth is entire, over this, as over every other natural and just state of the human mind.13 Here, then, Ruskin's criticism persists in asserting one extreme against the other instead of trying to moderate between, to reconcile, object and subject, matter and style, representation and reflection. In part, his series of contradictions is due to the intensity of his need for both the grandeur of landscape seen in awe or accurately remembered and the warmth of human affections, felt or still longed for. If the two needs cannot be merged in Ruskin's poetry, criticism, or life, he has, with an almost self-lacerating impulse, to deny strenuously one or the other. The would-be lover in Arnold's "Dover Beach," responding to this internal tension ("the dialogue of the mind with itself," in Arnold's phrase), hopes for an alternative to the l2See, for instance, Modem Painters in Works, V, 209. Ruskin's vocabulary is often confusing: why does he call his first order of poets creative, as distinct from the reflective1} He tries to answer, and meet the implicit objection, in this chapter (V, 210) by insisting that although "the high creative poet might ... be thought, to a great extent, impassive," he really "has entire command of himself, and can look . . . for the image or the word that will best tell what he sees," while Keats and Tennyson, and the "poets of the second order," are "subdued by the feelings under which they write." (He does not explain how the critic can know which poet has chosen and which is subdued; the process is impressionistic or, again, subjective!) The apparently passive representational artist is the one who perceives creation and thus shares somehow in the creative process, but the Romantic artist is partly enslaved by (noncreative?) feeling. Actually, as if to modify the arbitrary harshness of all this, Ruskin allows four classes: "the men who feel nothing, and therefore see truly; the men who feel strongly, think weakly, and see untruly (second order of poets); the men who feel strongly, think strongly, and see truly (first order of poets); and the men who, strong as human creatures can be, are yet submitted to influences stronger than they, and see in a sort untruly, because what they see is inconceivably above them. This last is the usual condition of prophetic inspiration" (V, 209). The last order, one might add, is what Romantic poets aspire to, and the second order is what Ruskin believes they are. 13 Works, V, 220. In John Ruskin: The Argument of the £&gt;&gt;*&gt; (Princeton Univ. Press, 1976), Robert Hewison observes that on the pathetic fallacy the critic "parts company with the Romantic poets . . . [whose] main interest was in how . . . perceptions affected their feelings" (p. 73); he relates Ruskin's reaction to profound religious feeling about the supernatural reality of Truth.</page><page sequence="15">WENDELL STACY JOHNSON / 33 nature of the sea - and of mountains, trees, flowers - as he declares that this nature which seems To lie before us like a land of dreams, So various, so beautiful, so new, Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light, Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain. The Ruskin who writes of a "pathetic fallacy" can agree with this diagnosis, and yet does not and cannot proceed to the conclusion that love in its full and usually erotic sense replaces such a nature. He is left with Scott's clear, cold landscape, one without a "breathing spirit." In fact, the conflict between Ruskin's longing for the comfort of Romantic faith, Romantic poetry, and his feeling of duty - both a rational and a vaguely religious duty - to see and tell the truth is one version of a general post-Romantic dilemma. Other Victorian writers, Tennyson and Browning, Dickens and George Eliot, Carlyle, as well as Ruskin, can be cited. In each there is some alternation between two impulses. One is the impulse to picture natural scenery as awesome and external to humanity, as the primary, even the divine, reality (so that the landscape painter has a duty to perceive and represent clouds as they are - and from this duty emerge both Romantic representationalism in painting and the science, among others, of meteorology). The other is an impulse to project human meaning, the moral or psychological feelings of people, into the landscape. Both are ways of fulfilling the central Romantic need, to unify the nature of man and the nature of the universe he perceives; the first is self-abnegating in practice and religious in tone, and would, in its extreme form, lead to the suicide of the individual, while the second is egotistical in method and Faustian or Titanic in tone, and would, in its extreme form, lead to madness, to megalomania. Romantic and post-Romantic artists - and critics - may not always be aware of dealing with issues that involve death and madness, but these are deeply serious matters for them. So they alternate anxiously between the poles of Wordsworth's "Ode: Intimations of Immortality," of Wordsworth's "landscape feeling" which is such a powerful influence on the younger Ruskin, and of Coleridge's "Ode: Dejection," denying that external forms have the subjective clothing of emotion by insisting, against Wordsworth, that nature's "wedding garment" and her "shroud" are really ours, existing only in our minds. Even Wordsworthian reciprocity, the "give" and "take" of man and nature, can then be denied. The Immortality Ode ends by admitting that the clouds may "take a sober colouring" from a mortal's eyes but concluding that the flower and all outward life forms "give / Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears"; Coleridge's ode replies, grimly, that "we receive but what we give, / And in our life alone does Nature live." This denial of Wordsworth's faith in reconciliation haunts the later artists'</page><page sequence="16">34/ VICTORIAN POETRY minds; Ruskin may read human morals and emotions into landscape and yet (sometimes) attack the "fallacy" that such a reading represents. But Ruskin the critic must finally- in spite of the attraction to Wordsworth that is evident in his poetry and more "poetic" prose (and in his drawings) - face up to this denial. The best commentators upon Ruskin' s work and life agree that he was constrained after 1850 or so to abandon any belief in Wordsworth's "landscape feeling." In fact, more often than not, landscape feeling came to mean "pathetic fallacy": landscape and feeling can be opposites rather than parts of one reciprocal reality. As a young writer of verse, then, Ruskin moved from conventionally late-Augustan reflections on the landscape, written mostly for his father, to positively Romantic celebrations of landscape as the objective correlative for, and then as the alternative to, erotic love, and at last to a dark and negatively Romantic flight from the memory of love - filial or erotic - into a landscape of dead seas and gloomy mountains that is wholly passionless. As a man and critic, afraid of how his memory and affections can give to outward forms significance too painful and too personal, Ruskin rejects all earlier unquestioned assumptions. Rejecting Wordsworth's pathos, he rejects his youthful self, the child within; that child will not be the father of this man. Father and Adele no longer function openly in what he writes. Yet the filial and the erotic are not dead in Ruskin. Neither is the poet dead. His imagination still attempts to harmonize subject and object, feeling and nature. He tries not to remember his childhood and adolescent affections and their associations with landscape; it is as if he were asking Miss Corlass to "call [me] a fool . . . and you will find that [I] will write no more." But Ruskin does write more: not poetry, but a great deal of essentially poetic criticism.14 I4I am grateful for a Grant-in-Aid from the American Council of Learned Societies that allowed me to pursue a study, of which this essay is one result, in Ruskin's poetry, letters, and literary criticism.
