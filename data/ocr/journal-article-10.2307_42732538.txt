<plain_text><page sequence="1">A SURVEY OF CUSHITIC LITERATURES, 1940-1975* B. W. Andrzejewski School of Oriental and African Studies University óf London Xn this paper I shall endeavor to present a brief survey of what Is known about the literatures of the Cushitic peoples either from published works or such sources as theses and essays deposited in libraries. While I am con- cerned with the period after 1940, the earl 1er "periods received very extensive bibliographical coverage in JON 59 and SCH 71 for all Cushitic literatures and in JOH 69 and 73 for Somali literature in particular. Anyone consulting the works listed in these bibliographies will realize the great debt which we owe to such scholars as Enrico Cerulli, Ad, A. Jensen, Martino Mario Moreno, Philipp Paulitschke, and Leo Reinisch. In the title of this essay, I employ the word literature in a sense which departs from the traditional English usage, since I extend it to the spoken form of this art. It would be beyond the scope of my present theme to discuss this new usage, which is gaining acceptance among scholars in spite of its derivation from thé Latin litera. Readers will find a discussion of this in- novation in AND-INN 75. It is important to observe that Cushitic languages have oral literatures only, with the exception of Somali and to a lesser extent of Oromo. The Somalis have a written literature as well, but as yet . it is relatively small in comparison with the vast riches of their oral literature. In Oromo the written literature consists only of the works of one author, Onesimos Ne sib , all written in the last century, as can be ascertained from the bibliography provided in TER 73. There are also some manuscripts of Islamic poems in Oromo written either in Arabic characters or in an adaptation of the Ethiopian script, the existence of which has been reported to me but which I have never had the opportunity to examine. Individual literatures of Cushitic peoples are . dealt with in this paper in separate sections each headed by the name of the language which they speak. In this connection readers should note that the name Galla , previously usëd in the majority of scholarly publications, has been replaced here by Oromo. Although the two names refer to the same language, the name Oromo is prefer- able, since it is now very much favored in Ethiopia, and the name Galla seems to be on the way out. There are striking differences iú the length of the sections dealing with the individual Cushitic literatures discussed in this paper. These variations reflect «differences- iň the. amount of documentation available, in the period under discussion, and it must not be assumed that the oral literatures fot *This paper was originally presented at the International Symposium on Cushitic Languages and the Peoples Who Speak lbem, Paris, 1975. 1</page><page sequence="2">2 Ethiopianiet Notes which documentation :1a scanty or. packing altogether are 'in any way poor. Research experience in oral ' literatures reveals ' that very frequently even the existence of major oral prose and poetry genres was overlooked by expatri- ate scholars, especially if their knowledge of the relevant language was inad- equate or if they had no literary Interests. Partly responsible for such omis- sions is the semantic confusion which sometimes arises between the terms poem and song. It; is a well-known fact that most oral poetry all over the world is either sung or is recited in a manner which uses a special form of intona- tion not present in ordinary speech. Prom the point of view of literary theo- ry» the oral texts of songs, if they use language as a medium of artistic ex- pression, must be regarded as poems in their own right, which is the position adopted in this essay. For many Cushitic cultures no published information exists at all, as far as I know, and this lack explains the omissions in this paper. AFAR During the period under discussion three contributions were made to the study of the oral literature of the Afars: KER 68, PAR 71, and DAV-ASH 59. The first two items provide texts in the original and in translation, while the third gives translations only. KER 68 contains a small collection of prov- erbs with brief commentaries on their meanings. In PAR 71 we find a general account of Afar oral prose and a collection of oral narratives and proverbs, as well as one text of a patriotic song. The oral prose consists of animal fab lee and realistic gnomic narratives . 2 DAV-ASH 59 contains animal fables and one realistic narrative concerning an encounter with a Somali adventurer. BASKETTO As far as I know the only available documentation on the oral literature in Basketto consists of a group of oral narratives published, in translation only, in HAB 59. The collection contains origin stories, animal fables, and realistic gnomic narratives. HADIYA There are only two articles on the oral literature in Hadiya: PLA 61 and ST. 65. Both provide texts in the original and in translation. In PLA 61 we find one animal fable and three historical narratives of considerable inter- est, dealing with the migrations of the Hadlyas and the wars which they fought with the Moliamo and Kambatta peoples. This article also contains a war boast in poetic form attributed to DaddSbo, the son of Alo, a Hadiya war leader. STI 65 provides a collection of oral prose which consists of animal fables and realistic gnomic narratives, together with a group of proverbs. IROB The 'Only documentation provided during the period under discussion on</page><page sequence="3">Cuehitio Literatures 3 Irob oral literature consists of the texts of four proverbs and one song, giv- en in the original and in translation in PLÂ S3. KAFFA After 1940, three contributions were made to our knowledge of Kaffa oral literature: BRO 47, С ER 51, and DAM 73. All three provide texts in the orig- inal and in translation. In BRO 47 poetic texts are found, together with annotations which give detailed information concerning the circumstances in which each poem was orig- inally composed and recited. This information is so detailed that it is of considerable historical value and suggests that when Kaffa poetry was orally transmitted, it must have been accompanied by prose narratives explaining all the allusions. BRO 47 also gives an extensive account of the role which the Kaffa bards played at the royal court before the Ethiopian conquest of 1897 and speaks of the prestige which they still enjoyed at the time when the re- search was conducted. A very interesting feature of the poetry of Kaffa bards was that their poems were not anonymous . The names of the poets, as among the Somalis, were orally transmitted together with the texts of their poems and were thus protected from oblivion by a kind of unwritten copyright convention. In CER 51 poetic texts are also found and are furnished with references to their context and allusions, thus presenting a most valuable contribution to both literary and historical documentation on life in the Kaffa Kingdom. CER 51 also contains some Kaffa prose: one of the texts is an anecdote about an unusual judgment in a lawsuit brought before the royal court. The remain- ing prose items are either animal fables or realistic gnomic narratives. DAM 73 is a collection of Kaffa oral narratives and proverbs. I have not yet been able to consult this work, but its existence was reported to me by an Ethiopian colleague. KAMBATTA The only available documentation on the Kambatta oral literature is found in DAS 71. This work contains a collection of oral narratives and proverbs in both the original and translation. I have not had the opportunity to con- sult this work, but again its existence was reported to me by an Ethiopian colleague. K0NS0 The only available documentation of the oral literature of the Konso is found in JEN 42 and HAL 72, in translation only. In the first we find one narrative about the origin of mankind, about the special status of one of the Konso and the Borana. In HAL 72 two oral narratives are given: one about God and the earth and another about the origin of a certain well. Two poetic texts of blessings and one text of a dance song are also provided in this work.</page><page sequence="4">4 Ethiopicmiat Notée MALE The only documentation on Male oral literature consists of a collection of oral narratives provided, in translation only» in JEN 59. The main charac- teristic of the narratives in this collection is that they give apparently factual reports of events in the lives of people within the ambient of Male society. It should be noted, however, that the reports include accounts of events of a supernatural order. OROMO During the period under discussion a considerable amount of documentation of and research into the oral literature of the Oromo people took place. In the field of poetry, the most substantial contributions consist of IDD 71, KAT 71, and TAD 71, which deal with the Shoa, Arussi, and Harar re- gions respectively. 3 All these works provide an ačcount of the social setting of thè poetry which they describe and provide specimen texts in Oromo and in translation: the amount of documentation is particularly impressive in IDD 71 and KAT 71, as is the author's emphasis in KAT 71 on the poetry which embodies the elements of pre-Islamic Oromo culture. All three works give a great .deal of attention to the division of Oromo poetry into genres and to the cultural functions of these genres. Of particular interest is the fact that the Oromo terminology of poetic genres, which the three authors discuss, uses almost en- tirely Cushitic roots, as does that of the Borana. This suggests that the flourishing poetic art of the Oromo is of considerable antiquity and is not an innovation brought in from outside the culture itself. Oromo poetry connected with traditional warfare received attention in CER 42, where texts and translations of poems are provided. Poems iti praise of heroic deeds are given, together with interesting observations on the role of this type of poetry in the Oromo culture. Love poetry is also discussed and illustrated by texts. The light poetic genre called weltu , practiced by young men among the Arussi Oromo, is the subject of BAX 74, where both texts and translations are given. The noteworthy feature of this contribution is a very extensive socio- logical description of the cultural setting in which this poetry, entirely devoted to amorous praises and pursuits, functions. The Deltu is often total- ly unintelligible in translation unless all the allusions are fully explained, and the author demonstrates how this can be done. Though in the totally different sphere, of Sufi mysticism, hymns in praise of Sheikh Hussein of Bale are equally incomprehensible because of their abun- dant esoteric allusions. Texts of these hymns, supported by extensive eluci- dations, are provided in the original and in translation in AND 72b and 7'4c and in translation only in ESH 73. The value of Oromo poetry for the study of history is shown in BAR 70t where thé author explores the past of the Wollega region and provides some poetic texts, in translation only. Texts of poems used in the contexts of the traditional Oromo religion can be found, together with translations, in HAB 63 and KNU 67 and also, in trans-</page><page sequence="5">Cuehitio Literatures 5 lation in HAB 63. Oromo prose texts in the original and in translation are found in AND 57 and 63 and NOR 39-41. They consist of animal fables, realistic gnomic narra- tives, and accounts of events with a strong supernatural element. In AND 63 the main theme is traditional warfare, and the material demonstrates, among other things, that, in spite of the warlike image .of Orpmo . society created by foreign travelers, a love of peace and the humanization of warfare through chivalry were by no means alien to the traditional Oromo culture. HAB 63 has collected a sizeable number of Oromo narratives in translation, whose wide thematic treatment of traditional beliefs, animal fables, realistic gnomic narratives, and accounts of adventures provides an important literary insight. A group of translated Oromo oral narratives is also Included in DAV-ASH 59 and are mostly realistic-gnomic or refer to real characters known in popular traditions . Three substantial collections of proverbs were published during the period under discussion: BOR 45, 46, 48, and 71; ABR 69 and 72; and DER 71. They contain the original texts together with translations and notes. A collection of proverbs, in translation only, is also given in HAB 63. In ABR 69 and 72 and in DER 71 proverbs are arranged according to a classification proposed by the authors. SALA (ZALA) The only contibution to our knowledge of the oral literature of the Sala (Zala) people during the period under discussion is a section devoted to oral narratives in SCL 63. It contains a group of translated narratives concerned with the origin of mankind; the present state of the earth, the sky, the sun, and the moon; and man's acquisition of water. The; section also includes nar- ratives about a legendary king who sets such impossible tasks for his subjects that they assassinate him. SIDAMO During the period under discussion the oral literature of the Sidamo people received attention in LON 71 and SAM 73. In the former the texts are provided in translation only, while in the latter they are given both in the original and in translation. Poetic texts of women's songs occupy a prominent position in the LON 71 collection. There are specimens of girls' songs which accompany such tasks as fetching wood or taking meals to herders in the fields. Among the themes of such poems we find comments on domestic life and love and complaints against forced marriage. The collection also includes poetic texts sung by married women on ceremonial occasions such as mále circumcision or prayers for rain during drought. Extracts from funeral dirges show that women not only express grief but also describe events in the deceased's life, the more un- usual incidents resembling the poetic narratives found in ballads in Europe. Some specimens of men's poetic praises of cattle, called г Jeddo, and texts of their dance songs are also provided. Although the author does not include</page><page sequence="6">6 Ethiopianiat Notée examples, he states that men also have funeral dirges, which consist mainly of genealogical recitation and rehearsal of deeds of valor. He also mentions the poems sung by men in praise of those who have distinguished themselves in fighting, either recently or in the distant past. Since the usual context of such songs, called gherareeia (gerareha) , is either before or after battle, they are now becoming obsolete and are suppressed by .the government authori- ties. In LON 71 some specimens of prose narratives are also given. There are two stories concerned with the cannibalistic ogres called bulgu two realis- tic stories about difficulties caused by stepmothers, and some animal fables. There is also a small collection of proverbs and children's verse. The impor- tant characteristic of the collection presented in LON 71 is its appreciation of the social setting in which the Sidamo poetry functions. The texts provided in SAM 73 consist of Sidamo oral narratives and prov- erbs. I have not yet been able to consult this work, but its existence was reported to me by an Ethiopian colleague. SOMALI A General Kote Somali is the only Cushitic language which has an official orthography and is used as a vehicle of government administration, law, education, and trade, both in its spoken and its written form. Documentation of and research into Somali literature exceeds by far what has been done in this respect for all the Cushitic literatures taken together, as can be ascertained from the bibliographies found in JOH 69 and JOH 73. Documentation and Research Where a Foreign Language Js the Medium of Presentation After 1945 a great deal of this type of work was done on Somali poetry. Texts of poems in the original, with translations, are provided in : AAR 73; ABL 73; AND 67, 70, 71a, and 74a; AND-INN 75; AND-LEW 64; AND-MUS 63; AXM-MUS- OMA 74; CER 59 and 64; HAS 74; JAA 65b; JOH 72 and 74; LEW 57 and 61; MAI 53; MOR 55b; MÜS 56, 68a, 68b, 68c, and 70; ОМА 70, 72a, and 72b; OAU 70; PAN 56- 57a and 56-5 7b; PAN-YAA 56; WWHD 74b; ZAB 69. Some translations appeared without the original texts and are found in AAR 73; ABD 64; AND 69 and 72a; AND-MOH 67; BUK 69; DRY 64; KEW 71; LAU 54; LEG 63; LEW 69; WWHD 71 and 74b. It should be noted, however, that in the case of AND-MOH 67 the original texts were deposited in a library and are accessible to the general public. Furthermore, the translations given in AND 72a derive from the texts presented in SHI 65 as indicated in the notes. Substantial progress was also made in research into the genres of Somali poetry and their specialized terminology. Information on this subject is now available in: AAR 73; AND 67; AND-LEW 64; AXM-MUS-OMA 74; CER 64; JOH 72 and 74; KEW 71; LAU 54; MAI 53; MÜS 66; ОМА 70, 72a, and 72b; OAU 70; PAN 56-57a; and WWHD 74b. It is of interest to observe that there are hardly any traces</page><page sequence="7">СивЫЫо Literatures 7 of foreign influence In the terms used for the maiü genres, and this suggests that the rise, of the art is due more to spontaneous national creativity than to contacts with any non-Cushitic cultures. The alliterative technique of ver- sification, which obliges the poet to sustain the same alliteration throughout the «hole work, also seems to be a spontaneous invention of considerable antiq- uity, since it is also found in proverbs, the majority of which display archaic linguistic features, many probably deriving from long before the rise of Islam. The nature of the sound -patterns of Somali scansion, though touched upon in some publications (AXM-MUS-OMA 74, AND -LEW 64 and OAU 70), still remains a mystery. No one has yet succeeded. &lt; in establishing what kind of rhythmic pat- terns are involved nor in isolating the units of scansion, yet it is certain that rhythmic patterns, probably very complex, are used since Somali people react violently against any departures from what they recognize as the hidden rules of their poetic art. The clue to these patterns' will probably be found one day by a musicolo- gist. Recited Somali poetry is usually sung, and JOH 72 and 74 clearly establish a close relationship between poetic genres and the tunes to which they are sung. The presence or the absence of drumming and other instrumental accompaniment also plays an important role (JOH 74). The nature of the imagery used bý Somali poets is discussed in AND 67, ABL 73, and JOH 74. The last two works draw attention to the fact that the images taken from traditional rural life persist and are predominant even in modern poems composed in an urban environment. An interesting area of poetic diction, explored in JOH 72 and 74 and ABL 73 is the panegyric specifying that what is particularly favored by modern poets is not altogether absent from older poems. Apart from the formal characteristics of Somali poetry, its social and political role attracted a considerable amount of research, hardly surprising since poetry occupies a pivotal position in local and national society. It provides a running commentary on current events, publicizes the poet's views and attitudes, and influences the public. Somalis generally agree poetry has fulfilled a political role as far back into the past as oral tradition reaches, and there are no signs of diminished potency under the impact of the changes which have occurred in the last three decades. The results of researches in- to the sociopolitical role of Somali poetry can be found in: ABL 73; AND 72a; AND-LEW 64; AND-MUS 63; AXM-MUS-OMA 74; BUK 69; CER 64; JOH 74; and LEG 63. Such an involvement of poetry in the life of the people has an important cor- ollary: the study of this poetry is, as is rightly observed in PET 63, an im- portant source of sociological and historical information. The importance of poetry in Somali society is reflected in the prestige accorded to poets, who enjoy enormous popularity. Their authorship rights are protected by a. custom which makes it obligatory to mention their names when reciting their poems, both in their lifetime and after their death. It is only natural, therefore, that biographies of poets attracted the attention of some researchers, and information about a number of well-known ones can be found in AND-LEW 64 and DUD-LAN 69. Not all genres of poetry enjoy equal respect. The classical genres, of which the principal exponents are gabay, geeraar , jib f to , and. buraaribur , and</page><page sequence="8">8 EthCopiarviet Notée which once completely dominated cultural life and are still widely practiced, are. treated with ' great reverence by all Somalis, even those. who through urban life have lost the full command of the archaic vocabulary and diction used in them. Poetry of the classical genres received particular attention in: AND- LEW 64; AND-MOH 67; AND -MUS 63; AXM-MUS-GMA 74; CER 59 and 64; KEW 71; and LAU 54. Modern poetry, of which the heello .genre is the principal exponent, is the product' of the social changes which began around 194Ó. Though at first it was limited to the sophisticated young men of the towns, it has now estab- lished its popularity on the national level. : Concerned initially with love theme e, it entered into the political arena by the back door of disguised al- lusion and later was even able to shed that disguise whenever desirable. It has. now reached such high levels of artistry that some heello poems vie in prestige with, the classical genres . The development and characteristics of modern poetry are treated in great detail in JOH 74, and some information con- cerning its earlier stages can be found in AND 67, JOH 72, and LAU 54. The role of modern poetry in the service of the patriotic ideology of the Somali Revolution is described at some length in ABL 73 and WWHD 71. Although classical and podern poetry received most of the attention of scholars during the period under discussion, the traditional, anonymous poems such as. dance or work songs, were not altogether neglected. The most impor- tant documentation in this sphere is found in AAR 73; CER 59 „and 64; ОМА 70, 72a, and 72b; OAU 70; and WWHD 74b; but specimëns òf traditional poetry are also provided in AND -LEW 64, AXM-MUS-OMA 74, and LEW 61 and 69. Most classical, modern, and traditional poetry is concerned with secular themes, with only incidental references to religion. Since Arabic, as the liturgical language of Islam, is particularly favored amorig Somalis, most re- . ligious poems are in Arabic, and a bibliography of such compositions can be found in AND 74a. Some Somali men of religion, however; as a concession to the fact that many members of their congregation know very little Arábie, com- pose religious poems in Somali, using the scansion of the existing secular genres. A few specimens of such poems áré published in thé original with translations in AND 70, CER 64, LEW 57, and MOR 55b. In Somali society prose narratives have a; very wide circulation and not only provide entertainment but also help to preserve the treasure hoard of factual information about Somali history and traditional customs and beliefs, without which much of the older poetry would be meaningless. During the per- iod under discussion фгозе narratives received much less attention than poetry, possibly because in the Somali hierarchy of values there is a marked prefer- ence for poetry and this attitude projected itself on to the researchers. Somali oral narratives, in the original and with translations, are found in AND 71b and 74a; AND-MUS 66; CER 59 and 64; MAI 53;MOR 55a and 55b; MÜS 55- 56; ОМА 70; and ZAB 69. Original texts without translations are provided in MUS 56 but it should be noted that this work contains . vocabularies and notes which enable a foreign reader to understand the text if he has an elementary knowledge of Somali grammar, and translations of texts Nos. 1,8, 12, 13, 14, 18, 19, 21, and 23 of MUS 56 aré provided in AND 64» Some publications contain prose narratives in translation only: AND 64; COU-LES 50; DAV-ASH 59; HUS 62;</page><page sequence="9">Cuekitio Literatures 9 LAU 54; МОЙ 70; MÜS 65; SHE 74b and 74c; YUS 67a and 67b; and ZAB 66. The translations in MOH 70 are based on the original texts in MOH 67, and those in ZAB 66 on the original texts in MOR 55b and MUS 56. The majority of the prose narratives studied during the period under dis- cussion are of the realistic type; that is, they describe events in people's lives without any fantastic or supernatural elements or anthropomorphic alle- gory. In many, narratives of this type the characters are not specific indi- viduals known. to the narrator from personal contact or the testimony of other people: they are usually nameless and are referred to as "the man," "the chief- tain," "the girl," "the man who was toothless," and so forth. These narra- tives are recited for the purpose of entertainment and are often humorous: fre- quently they contain a strong sapiential element, a wise man's commentary on what life is really like. Realistic narratives in which the characters are people known to the nar- rator personally ór from the testimony of other people are also well represent- ed, and often they concern people well known in local or national history. The story of the adventurer and traveler Cigaal Bowkax, for example, who vi- sited Aden and South Africa in the first half of this century (LAU 54 and MUS 56) , has a circulation limited to northern Somalia, while stories about Wiil- waal, who according to oral traditions established a sovereign sultanate, with Jigjiga as its capital, in the eighteenth century, are known throughout all the Somali-speaking territories. They are available in translation in LAU 54 and MOH 70. Sometimes foreign characters are used in oral narratives, with themes im- ported from abroad. Among them we find the humorous figure of Abuu Nawaas, who belongs both to popular tradition and to the literature of the Arabs. So- mali stories about him are available in translation in LAU 54 and COU-LES 50. Another character who is the subject of many humorous stories is Cigaal Shi- daad,6 a Somali equivalent of the Good Soldier Schweik, whose wit and earthy philosophy compensate for his cowardice. Stories about him can be found in COU-LES 50 and HUS 62. Narratives in which at least some of the characters are animals, inani- mate objects, forces of nature, or abstract ideas are also present in the prose material collected and translated during the period under discussion, and most of them belong to children's lore. One such narrative, which lies somewhere on the borderline between children's and adults' lore, and might be a pre -Islamic survival, portrays a soothsayer whose relationship with a ser- pent helps him to cast his horoscopes. It describes in symbolic form the para- mount influence of the social and natural environment on the actions of an in- dividual. Apart from being published in ' the original (MUU 56) and in trans- lation (AND 64) , this story réčeived a thorough analysis from the structural and philosophical point of view by a prominent Soviet scholar (ZHO 70) . Legends concerning Muslim saints are widespread among Somalis, as they are in many other parts of the Muslim world. During the period under discus- sion ...some of these legends were published in the original and in translation, with notes on their background, in AND 74a, and in translation only in LAU 54. It is an interesting point that such legends are not universally believed by the Somali public and there are many antilegends which satirize them, one of</page><page sequence="10">10 Ethiopianiet Ab tee which Is available in the original and in translation in AND 74a. ^ Somali proverbs received a considerable amount of attention, and collec- tions are available in the original and in translation in AND 68; CER 59 and 64; MOR 55b; ОМА 70; and SHI 66-67e. Proverbs in translation only can be found in SHE 74a, but some original texts are provided in SHI 66-67e. Prov- erbs are also scattered through many of the works on the Somali language, cul- ture, and social organization; and a bibliography of such sources is provided in AND 68, where the social function of Somali proverbs and their imagery are also discussed. Of particular importance is the contribution made in CER 59, where the oral compositions called eaädexliya , which might be regarded as ex- tended proverbs, are discussed. In them three parallel items are used as com- ponents which logically reinforce each other. This kind of parallelism is also found in the literature of the Harari people (see CER 59, 213) and in the Arabie aphorisms attributed to Sheikh Hussein of Bale. The Somali theater, no more than half a century old, provides extremely pop- ular mass entertainment. Its appeal lies in the fact that plays deal with topical and local themes and that salient parts are recited or sung in poetic form. An account of the development of the Somali theater is given in the introduction to HAS 74, and the use of elements taken from traditional narra- tives and riddles is discussed in AND 73. The original text of a well-known play, transcribed from a tape recording made during a performance at Moga- dishu's National Theatre, is available, with an annotated translation, in HAS 74. Documentation and Research Where Somali le the Language of Presentation On 21 October 1972 Somali became ■ the of ficial átate language and.a nation- al orthography was introduced. Accounts of this historic event are provided in WWHD 74a and in AND 74b, where further bibliographical references are avail- able. There had been some twelve years of preparation, which consisted not only of work on the development of a suitable script but also of documentation of and research into Somali oral literature. A team of government-employed Somali scholars wrote down, and in many cases also tape-recorded, a very large corpus of poems, prose narratives, and proverbs. After the 1969 revolution, this work was intensified and still continues. An account of these researches can be found in AND 74b and in greater detail in JOH 73, where information is provided about the scholars involved. In JOH 73 a special tribute is paid to the achievements of Muueé Xaaji Ismaaciil Galaal,9 whose publications have been mentioned earlier in this essay and who also put at the disposal of the Somali public two other works, MÜS 64 and MUS 69. Other pioneers also were engaged in using various types of scripts before the introduction of the of- ficial orthography. A select bibliography of works which describe the com- peting scripts and their promoters can be found in AND 74b, and here I shall limit myself to those collectors whose work resulted in publications. A group of scholars and writers, centered round the Society for the So- mali Language and Literature (1949-72), used a script called Far SoomaaVL , sometimes referred to as Osmania. They collected oral poems and proverbs and used a great deal of this material in their two journals, Sahan "Reconnais-</page><page sequence="11">Cuaki tia L iteratures 11 sanee" (GASS 58) and Hoveeed "Vanguard" (GASS 67-68) , and in the textbooks for their evening schools, such as YÂÂ 66. Information concerning this society and the script itself, as well a.$ the relevant bibliographical references, can be found in RIC 59. ■ The work of its individual, members is also described in JOH 73. The pioneering role of this script is also given due recognition in WWHD 74a. Somali written in Arabic script never had a wide number of users for reasons which are clearly set out in WWHD 74a. It was used, however, by var- ious collectors of oral literature as an аЫечпётогте , intelligible only to the writer himself. The most prominent among such scholars is Sheikh Jaamac Cimar Clise, who over the past twenty years has been collecting the poems of Sayid Maxamed Cabdulle Xasan (1856-1921), the Somali national poet and hero. He took great pains to collect oral texts from old soldiers who had served un- der the sayid; and with the help of the Academy of Culture, of which he is now a member, Sheikh Jaamac published, in the official orthography, 120 of the sayid's poems together with sixteen other relevant poems (JAA 74). He is a careful and conscientious historian and provides each poem with a reasoned in- troduction and notes. A very useful companion to this volume is his Arabic work on Somali history (JAA 65b) , in which particular attention is given to the sayid and his struggles. Ю Among the most prominent pioneers of Somali in Latin script was Shire Jaamac Axmed, and it was his final, version which was eventually adopted by the government as the official orthography. With the financial support of a few friends and sympathizers, he first published a collection of poems, narratives, and proverbs - SHI 65 - all obtained from oral sources, and later edited and pub- lished a literary and educational magazine, SHI 66-67. Though mainly concerned with the practical task of promoting written Somali, the magazine did a great service to the documentation of oral literature. SHI 65,66-67a, 66-67b,66-67c, 66-67d, and 66-67f contain poems selected for their popularity and fame among the Somali public. They are provided with introductions which explain the cir- cumstances in which they were. originally composed and give information about the poets themselves; the introductions represent a substantial contribution to the literary and political history of Somalia and in this respect can be regarded as models of the presentation of oral literature. The prose narratives in SHI 65, 66-67a, 66-67b* 66-67c, 66-67d, and 66- 67f are of the realistic type, featuring characters who are in some cases real people and in others fictitious or unnamed individuals. In SHI 66-67f there is a particularly interesting series of historical narratives obtained from some prominent elders concerning the life and deeds of Wiilwaal, a Somali na- tional hero, mentioned earlier in this paper. .... These narratives detail how Wiilwaal achieved and maintained his power by combining skillful manipulation with a ruthless use of force and also report his elaborate security precautions against assassination, a fate met by both his father and grandfather. His wars against powerful neighbors are also described in these narratives, with vivid details of his tactics and unorthodox stratagems; there is an account, for example, of how his bilingual agents infiltrated the enemy camp and shout- ed conflicting orders during a night attack. It is interesting to observe that Wiilwaal also gained fame as a poet, and fragments of his poems are inter- spersed in the narratives.</page><page sequence="12">12 EtkiopúxnÍ8t Votée A literary and .political magasine in English, called Dalha "The Home- land" (YOS 65-69) , also occasionally published texts of well-known oral poems transcribed by Somali scholars in Latin characters. While the bulk of the materials collected by government -sponsored and private scholars still awaits publication, two well-chosen collections of sto- ries, CBQ 73 and MUU.73, are now available, and they both have a wide thematic range covering the main types of Somali narrative. À collection of proverbs is found in YUU 73, together with some .poems of the classical genres. Poems, narratives, and proverbs have found their way into books published for schools and adult education classes, such as GUÀF 72, 73a, and 73b, and into periodi- cals, especially AKDH 74, the journal of the Academy of Culture in Mogadishu. All the published works mentioned so far represent Somali literature transcribed from oral sources. As far as I have been able to ascertain, cre- ative literature produced entirely in the written medium did not exist in So- mali before the introduction of the national orthography in 1972, with the notable exception of two works by Axmed Cartan Xaange, the first written in Far SoomaaZi and the second in Latin script. In 1967 he wrote a story about the young lovers Qawdhan and Qaran (AXM 67) . When Qaran is forced by her fa- ther to consider marriage to a middle-aged man, the young couple elope; they are caught but escape again and finally marry. The story has a subplot, a similar love story narrated at a camp fire by a friend of Qawdhan, an old sol- dier who had served under MaxamedCab dulie Xasan and who fell in love with a girl when on a reconnaissance patrol against the British forces. The action of the main plot takes place some years before independence and vividly de- picts life in Somalia during that period. The story differs from the style of Somali oral narrative in the presence of long and detailed descriptive pas- sages concerning the beauty of the heroine and that of the Somali countryside. It also contains many philosophical observations about life in general, which are more in keeping with the style of Somali classical oral poetry than with that of oral prose. Axmed Cartan Xaange' s second work is entitled Samawada "The Doer-of- What-Is-Good," which is the panegyric name of the principal character (AXM 68). She is a student in an Italian-run school, soon after the Second World War, and becomes involved in the activities of the Somali Youth League, an important political organization, against the wishes of her father, which spoils her chances of a good match. She also comes into conflict with a teacher who con- fronts his Somali students with names like Julius Caesar, Michelangelo, Dante, and Garibaldi in order to inculcate the notion of the superiority of Italian culture. At the end of the play the heroine is wounded during a political demonstration and dies,, like the Somali national heroine Xaáwa Taako, who was killed in Mogadishu ih 1948. These two works, though well received by the then small number of So- mali readers, could not reach a wide audience. Thé real opportunity for So- mali writers came only with the intfoduction of. the official orthography. Now, with the expansion of the educational system in towns and a massive lit- eracy campaign in the rural areas, the number of readers whom the creative writer can address is growing rapidly day by day.</page><page sequence="13">Cmhitio Literatures 13 Poems composed entirely in the written medium appear in the daily paper Xiddigta Oktoobav "The Qctobér Star ' (ЧШШ 73b) aiid in such periodicals as U 'айда Cusió "The New Era" (WWHD 1 3b) , . Codka Mäßallinka 'The Teachers' Voice" (STB 72ÜV 'Uátil. iy o Hantiwadaag ''Work and' Socialism" (XSH 73) , . and Kacaan "Re- volution' (ÀKDH 74)., Some short stories have been published in Xiddigta Oktoobar , and arti- cles on Somali literature can be found in Kacaan and in a book entitled Jidka horumarka Soomaaliya "Somalia's Road to Progress" (XSM 74). In the papers of a symposium held in Mogadishu on political and cultural matters, we find an Interesting account of the role of the theater in Somali society (CBM-MAX-ISM- SCD 73), and accounts of the lives of the' great Somali poets are scattered throughout books designed for schools and adult education. There are. also interesting developments in prose fiction. Shire Jaamac Axmed, already distinguished in other fields, has published two short novels, Rooxaan "Spirits" (SHI 73a) and HalgankCi noloeha "Life Struggle" (SHI 73b) . The first is a story of disillusion on the part of an innocent young man from the rural interior, who comes to Mogadishu to become a student of religion. Disappointed with his harsh and obtuse teacher, the young man abandons his studies and finds secular employment. When he is unjustly accused of stealing money from his employer, he seeks the help of a sheikh who purports to locate lost and stolen property and to Identify the thieves by communicating with spirits. An exorbitant consultation fee yields no result, and his only satis- faction is to expose the fraudulent sheikh. The author's reformist zeal and his attack on the exploitation of public credulity is very much in keeping with what one often finds on the Somali stage or in the oral antilegend, as is shown in the introduction to HAS 74 and AND 74a, respectively. Halgqnkii noloeha depicts the harsh life of Bulxan, a boy whose mother is divorced and sent away. His soldier-father is stationed elsewhere, and Bulxan, who:. cannot bear the humiliating treatmènt meted out to him by his step- mother, runs away and, notwithstanding enormous difficulties, manages to sur- vive. On his father's return, he is sent to a religious school but cannot suf- fer the heavy beatings administered to the students there. He again flees, and the story ends with a long journey to join his mother, who lives far away in a distant region. The book not only depicts the . realities of life in So- malia in the immediatè pre- and postwar period but goes deep into the feelings of despair and isolation of the hero, a tender and imaginative soul struggling against a brutal environment. The book is characterized by realistic dialogue and evocative descriptions of Somali scenery, which the author uses asa back- ground to the emotional states of the hero. A much longer novel is Aqoondarro waa и nacab jaoayl "Ignorance Is the Enemy of Love" (FAA 74) by Faarax M. J. Cawl, a senior police officer, collec- tor of -oral literature, arid writer in his spare time. His novel investigates the ill-starred lòv&lt;a of Calimaax, a seafarer and soldier, and Cawrala, whom he saves from drowning during a shipwreck. The story, based on oral traditions and depicting the period between 1913 and 1922, is full of dramatic incidents. After the shipwreck Calimaax takes part in a battle against the British forces from which he does not return, and he is presumed dead. Cawrala refuses to believe the reports but is forced by. her parents to marry someone else. On the day of her wedding she is seized 'with a violent fever followed by severe</page><page sequence="14">14 Ethiopianist Hôtes illness, and her husband, knowing the cause, releasee her by divorcing her. Meanwhile, Čalimaáx, who has survived not only his. battle wounds but also the desert and a leopard attack, is sheltered by a Dervish sympathizer. When he recovers and hears what has happened, he sends á message offering to marry Cawrala immediately, but it arrives too late, since Cawrala has just died. The novel contains long passages describing the beauty of the Somali landscape and also vividly portrays traditional life with its stoical acceptance of danger, hardship, and misfortune. Strongly pro feminist in its tone, the book clarifies the role of women sympathizers during the rising of the Dervishes and also rep- resents a protest against the custom of forced marriage. An Interesting char- acteristic of this novel is that it is interspersed with numerous poems, mainly used at the highest points of dramatic tension. At Cawrala' s grave, Calimaax, for ins tance, addresses his beloved in a long farewell speech: in prose and po- etry he retells the tragic course of their destiny, expresses the depth of his devotion, and comments on the vicissitudes of fortune. PROSPECTS Cushitic literatures present a rich and Interesting field of study and deserve much more attention than they have. so far received. As X see it, there is a need for further development in two directions. First, there must be more documentation and research in all areas but especially in those in which little or no work has béen done. Second, we must make Cushitic literatures more ac- cessible to the world at large, and to this end, we ought to attract to the field devoted and energetic translators who are competent both in the source and the target language. We especially need translators whose skills are matched by literary sensitivity and talent; I hope that this essay will help to promote these aims at those centers where teaching and research on the Cush- itic area are conducted. I also hope that we shall explore the practical ways and means of launching long- and short-term projects and of establishing links which would encourage exchange of information and ideas. NOTES Aš used in this paper, the term "Cushitic" follows the classification established by M. M. Moreno in his Marnale ¿ti Sidamo (Milan 1940, Montador!) and thus covers languages which according to a recent classification are sub- divided into Cushitic and Omo tic. In 1975 the new classification could still be regarded as tentative, but since then it has been generally accepted by lin- guists working in the Ethiopian field; for details, readers are referred to M. Lionel Bender, ed., The Non-Serrritio languages of Ethiopia (African Studies Center, Michigan State University, East Lansing, Mich. , 1976 ) . According to the new classification, Afar,. Hadiya, Irob, Rambat ta, Konso, Oromo, Sidamo, and Somali are Cushitic, while Basketto, Kaffa, and Male are Omotic; the position of Sala (Zala) is uncertain owing to insufficient documentation. For the sig- nificance of such codes as JON 59 or SCH 71 see the section "Bibliographical References." 2 The term "realistic" is applied here to those narratives which describe events which come within normal human experience and thus exclude any super-</page><page sequence="15">Cuehitio Literatures 15 natural element. "Gnomic" are those narratives which convey some general truth rather than merely report events or the deeds of particular persons. Some authors use the term "didactic" for such narratives, but this description could be misleading, since frequently the maxims implied in them are of a Ma- chiavellian nature and thus contrádlct the narrow functionalist view of oral literature as a prop of society's moral order. ^In these three B.A. essays the medium of presentation is Amharic, a language with Which I am not acquainted beyond the rudiments of grammar. I was fortunate, however, to secure the assistance of Mr. Daniel Liban, also known as Boru Liban, a teacher from Negelle (Borana), who helped me to peruse them. ^Ogres called bulgu also occur in Oromo oral narratives; see HAB 63, 642. "*Abu NuwSs (813-862). His name is given as Abana Wye in LAU 54. ^His name is given as Eghal Shillet in COU -LES 50. The question of distinguishing between oral narratives which are ac- cepted as literally true by adults and those which are not is also raised in AND 62. The need for telling the foreign reader about such distinctions when presenting oral narratives in translation is stressed in AND 65. Texts of these aphorisms can be found in the work referred to as Anon- ymous, 1927 and 1948 in AND 72b. ^This is the official spelling of the name. See under MUS for the list of publications. *^Sheikh Jaamac wrote two other historical works, JAA'65a and 72, both dealing with the modem history of Somalia. BIBLIOGRAPHICAL REFERENCES In Somalia the same name may have two or more forms, since there was no uniform system of spelling proper names in the Latin alphabet before the intro- duction of the official orthography, and thereafter change had to be gradual for practical reasons. There is also the common problem of the use oř omission of such items as the grandfather's name or a nickname and the use of abbrevi- ations . Another problem arises when an author publishes his works in two languages, one in a Latin and the other in a non-Latin alphabet: the process of transliteration into and out of different alphabets has added to the plur- ality of versions of the same names. I considered standardizing all the Somali names in this paper by using the national orthography, but decided that such consistency would conflict with the existing library cataloquee. Instead I have introduced a system of codes to simplify the identification of works mentioned here. The codes in the text of the paper consist of a group of capital letters (representing the author or authors), followed by the last two figures of the publication year and by lower-case letters of the alphabet if there was more than one publication by that author in the same year. In the bib liographica I</page><page sequence="16">16 Ethiopianist Notes list, all the entries for one author aregrouped under the general heading of the appropriate code lettere only, and the Items are arranged according to year of publication, irrespective of alphabetical order if there is more than one version of the proper name concerned. In order to avoid the confusion which might arise from an indiscriminate application of the concept of surname, the names of Arab, Ethiopian, and Somali authors are entered in the order in which they occur on the title pages of their works; but it should be noted that this order is sometimes reversed in library catalogues. For all other authors, surnames are entered first, as is custom- ary in Europe and America. In entries where no publisher is given it is to be assumed that the work was published by the author, whether an Individual or a corporate body. The system of transliteration for Amharlc and Arabic used here is self- evident, and I have only to add that the customary marking of Arabic vowel eli- sion has been dispensed with: thus fî ál-cusür appears instead of fi 'l-cuçûr. The transliteration of Russian follows the system used by the Department of Printed Books, British Museum, London, and the. entries in Far Soomaali are con- verted into the official Somali orthography. Since it can hardly be assumed that all readers of this paper will be familiar with the Somali names of government departments and organizations in- volved in publishing, there follows a list of them, together with translations and explanatory notes.

Among these publications items 6 and 8 are of fundamental importance, since the two authors, working independently, have discovered the rules. of Somali scansion and shown that these owe nothing to foreign influences . The authors, both graduates of the National University of Somalia, now teach in the Department of Somali Language and Literature there. They have produced conclusive evidence that Somali poetry of the traditional type, represented by such genres as the gabay, the geeraar, the ¿iiftó and the buraanbur, is quantitative and uses a mora system in which a long syllable has two morae and a short syllable has one. They have worked out the exact patterns of length distribution for each genre, and although they use different notations for representing these patterns, there is essential agreement in their form- ulations. Their works are in Somali, but thanks to the author òf item 7 the rules of Somali scansion, with further theoretical elaboration, will soon be accessible to the English-speaking public.</page><page sequence="27">Cushi tio Literatures 27 In Ethiopia the language policy has changed substantially since 1975. Until then the use of Cushitic and Omotic languages in written form was dis- couraged or prohibited, but now the principle of mul tilingualism has been a- dopted, even though Amharic has been retained as the principal state language. Literacy materials have been produced in several languages which were previous- ly unwritten, including a newspaper in Oromo, called Bäriea (Dawn). This publication contains not only news items and articles of topical interest but also poems which, though traditional in their form, deal with modem themes such as progress in agriculture, education, and the emancipation of women. Item 4 gives a brief account of the orthography now used for Oromo.</page></plain_text>
