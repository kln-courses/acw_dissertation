<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hindu and Muslim Mysticism. ("Jordan Lec- tures in Comparative Religion," V.) By ROBERT C. ZAEHNER. London: Athlone Press, 1960. 234 pages. The Theory and Art of Mysticism. By RA- DHAKAMAL MUKERJEE. New York: Asia Publishing House, 1960. 352 pages. The first of these two books is based upon the Jordan Lectures in comparative religion, delivered in 1959 at the School of Oriental Studies of the University of London. The au- thor, the Spalding Professor of Eastern Re- ligions and Ethics in Oxford University, has already distinguished himself both as a scholar of Zoroastrianism and as an investigator of mystical religion. The present volume repeats in part but also extends the researches Zaeh- ner presented in his discerning work, Mysti- cism, Sacred and Profane. In that study as well as in this he attempts to refute "the quite unproven premiss (of much of the voluminous literature on mysticism) that mysticism is a more or less uniform phenomenon appearing in all the great religious traditions" (p. vii). The fact is, asserts Zaehner, "Certain varieties of mystical experience are attested not only in different mystical traditions but also in the same religion" (loc. cit.). In the course of eight lectures Zaehner proposes "to trace the development of mystical thought within the formative period" (loc. cit.) of both Hinduism and Islam for the purpose of delineating the varieties of mysticism found in both traditions. Zaehner begins his discussion by distinguish- ing three major types of mysticism, the devel- opment of which he then traces in the forma- tion of Hinduism. The first type, the panthe- istic or "pan-en-henic" (nature mysticism wherein the individual experiences all creature- ly existences as one and as one with himself), is basic to much of Upanishadic speculation and is expressed in such declarations as "All this (world) is Brahman" and "I am this All." The second type, the experience of undifferen- tiated unity, is also found in the Upanishads (notably the late Mdndukya) but is especially characteristic of the liberation experience (moksa) in both the monistic doctrine of the eighth-century A.D. philosopher, Shankara, and the dualistic doctrine of the Sdibkhya-Yoga. The third and final variety of mystical ex- perience which Zaehner distinguishes is the theistic one in which there is "a loving dia- logue with God which results in transforming union" (p. 19). The possibility of such a dia- logue Zaehner sees adumbrated in the Id, Kena, Mundaka, and Svetdgvatara Upanishads (in which a distinction is made between Brahman and God who transcends Brahman) and the devotional religion (bhakti) of the Bhagavad- Git&amp; and of its great expositer, Rdminuja (whose interpretation of the Gitd Zaehner re- gards as correct). Turning to Islam, Zaehner surveys the de- velopment of Sffism in terms of key figures- AbGi Yazid, Abfi Sa'id, Junayd, Ghazili and others. Whereas Indian mysticism began with the experience of an undifferentiated unity (whether of a self-isolated spiritual monad or of the all-reality, Brahman) and moved to the ex- perience of a transcendent God with whom loving communion and union is possible, Mus- lim mysticism began with the wholly other God of the Koran and moved to the monistic experience of infinite self-inflation, "I am He." This movement was, Zaehner declares, the re- sult of the infiltration of Indian Vedantic mon- ism into Sifism. It may not be possible to agree with all Zaehner's interpretations of Upanishadic pas- sages, of the Gitd, or of the Sifi mystics; nor is it possible always to accept the types of mysticism as being as clearly distinguished or as exhaustive as he presents them in his analy- sis of the literature. However, it cannot be de- nied that Zaehner has produced a masterful and highly valuable study on an extremely dif- ficult subject. Indeed, if only as an addition to our English language literature on Muslim mysticism, this book is welcomed. But it is much more than that. It is a brilliant contri- bution to our understanding of mystical expe- rience. The second book, The Theory and Art of Mysticism by Radhakamal Mukerjee, is by</page><page sequence="2">CRITICAL REVIEWS 237 contrast a curious production. It is difficult to say just what its purpose and message are. Whereas with Zaehner one has the sense of be- ing on the terra firma of careful scholarship in mysticism, this regrettably is not so with Mu- kerjee-not, however, because the author (currently the director of the J. K. Institute of Sociology and Human Relations at Luck- now) is not in his own right a sound scholar. Indeed he is. His several books on sociology have been rightly praised. However, this pres- ent attempt at a sociological critique of mysti- cal religion-which seems to be the book's pur- pose-is a confused and confusing collection of notes and observations on a dozen or more topics ranging from primitive religion and psy- choanalysis to "Yogaism" and the superiority of Indian metaphysics. Throughout this rather lengthy book, Mu- kerjee seems to mean by mysticism a number of things. However, the opening definition of mysticism as "the art of inner adjustment by which man apprehends the universe as a whole, instead of its particular parts" (p. xii) does give some clue to his main intention. If noth- ing else, mysticism makes for a well-integrated individual and a harmonious social order (pp. xiv, 4, 13, and passim)! Mysticism is "the soul of living religion" (p. 1). Indeed, mysti- cism is nothing but religion itself-all religions -transcending outmoded partisan dogmas, myths, rituals, institutions. In language remi- niscent of Radhakrishnan's "religion of the spirit" and Huxley's philosophia perennis, Mu- kerjee asserts that in "the higher mystical con- sciousness" there resides the "fundamental re- ligious unity of man" (p. 16). Although he dis- tinguishes several varieties of mystical experi- ence, Mukerjee evidently finds the differences between them superficial. In the last analysis mysticism is one as Reality is one and as hu- man nature is one, and thus, religion is (or should be) one. Could we not, with a deeper insight and more practical syncretism, mutually correct and enrich our religious consciousness by adopting and re- creating the images and symbols of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Christianity, and seek synoptically the entire gamut of mystical experiences enshrined in the lives and devotions of Yajnavalkya and Plotinus, the Buddha and Christ, Sankara and Eckhart, Sri Chaitanya and St. Francis, Chandidas and Al-Ghazzali? [p. xvi]. According to Mukerjee, the highest realiza- tion of mysticism is the pan-en-henic (to use Zaehner's term) experience of undifferentiated oneness, in which the mystic transcends self and the world and perceives the totality of the universe with "a triumphant affirmation of 'I am' " (p. 4) or "I am Absolute" (p. 30). This "cosmic personalism"-the identification of self and cosmic reality, "the realization of each person in all and all in each" (p. 331), is the true goal of all religion. Agreeing with Shan- kara, Mukerjee believes that devotional mysti- cism is clearly inferior to the mysticism of identity with the All, the one cosmic Reality, and that the mythic symbol of a personal God must finally be transcended in the experience of the undifferentiated and unconditioned One (pp. 295 ff.). Indeed the idea of a personal God has been made outre by modern science, and thanks to the work of Barth, Otto, Brunner, and Tillich, the West is moving away "from the facile anthropomorphism of official Chris- tianity" (p. 315)! Just how the "true mysti- cism" of "identification with Life and the Uni- verse" in which "the difference between truth and error does not exist" (p. 298) can have any ethical relevance to social life, Mukerjee does not make clear. Indeed, it would seem that the mysticism which "imports final or ab- solute values into the common daily life and relations of men" (pp. 300-301) is not the mysticism of monistic identity which Muker- jee regards as the summit and unity of mysti- cal experience but that of devotion in which there is the force of love and an awareness of truth and error. All in all it is difficult to see this book as the "objective explanation of the mystical life and experience" it proposes to be. Perhaps its failure is due to an inadequate grasp of the teachings and historical developments of the several religious traditions dealt with, as re- flected, for example, in the statement: "In all living religions we have the repetition of the conviction that there is but one God and that man though from God, is yet co-eternal and participates in the divine nature" (p. 288). Surely none of the "living religions" could un- qualifiedly subscribe to this "conviction." Or, again, the profound truth, of the Christian as well as the Hindu doctrine of Incarnation is that the finite is the infinite and vice-versa" (p. 299)! What Mukerjee and other syncre- tizers have failed to appreciate is that the di-</page><page sequence="3">238 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION versities among religions are not simply a mat- ter of many paths to the same goal, but a mat- ter of many goals. If in this book Mukerjee has tried to dem- onstrate the essential unity of religions in "mysticism," then the attempt has been worth- while if only to show that no such unity can be found. H. P.
