Excavations were continued at Vinca in 1930 on the same area as in 1929. Work began at a depth of 5.8 to 6 metres below the surface and at the moment of writing this report (August, 1930) a depth of 8.5 metres has been reached. I. Buildings.-At various levels of various parts of the area examined remains of buildings which had contained clay stoves have been found. The buildings were rectangular with roughly horizontal floors. The walls consisted of a frame on posts let into the ground supporting wattle and daub walls. At least a portion of the floor, particularly in the neighbourhood of the stove, consisted of horizontal beams thickly laid over with a mud plaster the surface of which had been fired. I may mention that similar floors have been discovered at Tcherna-Voda on the Danube in Bulgaria, and in south-west Russia. The stoves in these places were of the same construction but their floors did not consist of mud plaster. In the corner of the floor of a building 7.45 metres below the surface was dis- covered a special slightly raised round stand, round which lay the remains of the large pithos which had rested on it. This pithos was made of a rough mud plaster ornamented on the surface with incised lines; ribbon spirals at the neck, lower down a check pattern and meander-like motives over which rises a representation of a human face. The nose of this face-is modelled, and the mouth and eyes consist of incised lines. This pithos had served for the storage of dry objects. The depiction of the face proves it has some connection with anthropomorphic vases and vases bearing representations of the human form in relief. Vases of this type were found at 7.6 and 8.5 metres below the surface. II. Implements and Weapons.-Implements and weapons found consist of stone, bone and horn. The types of stone varied; obsidian, flint and other rocks were used for making small knives. Axes, mainly unbored-the oldest bored axe was found at a depth of 7.7 metres-were of various stones and shapes. The shoe-last [ 197 ]</page><page sequence="2">No. 141.] MAN. [November, 1930. celt, most common in the later levels, becomes comparatively rare in the early levels. Two jade axes from 7 and 7 * 7 metres below the surface are trapezoidal in shape with a very narrow profile. A number of fragments of maces with a hole for the handle have been found, the earliest at a depth of 8 -4 metres, and among these a marble mace, found at a depth of 8 * 2 metres and probably used for some religious purpose. None of these forms of stone or rock are to be found very near Vinca. They have been brought from sources which are as yet unknown. The source of the obsidian which, in the form of long knives, nuclei and flakes, is found from the lower levels upwards is still unknown. None the less, taking into account other con- nections between Vinca and the Biikk district, where obsidian occurs naturally and was also employed for the manufacture of knives, we may perhaps suggest that at least part of the obsidian found at Vinca came from Bukk. Pins and needles were made of bone, and harpoons and fish hooks from deer horn. Two horn borers from a depth of 6 * 7 to 6 * 9 metres had been coloured with the same black matter as that on the Hyde vase and brightly polished. They may perhaps be regarded as imitations of metal weapons. III. Figurines.-This year has yielded a large number of figurines of many varied types, both human and animal. The materials used are stone, bone and clay. The largest figurine, which has been christened Vidovdanka, found at a depth of 6 * 2 metres, stands 30 * 7 cms. high, and a figurine which has been christened Ivanka; on which clothing isindicated and which was found at a depth oI 6 * 4 metres was evidently of about the same size. We may divide the human figurines into male and female; the latter are in the majority and are of a limited number of types. A hermaphroditic figurine was found at a depth of 6 - 9 metres. The buttocks are large (steatopygy) and the abdomen and breasts are fully modelled, but, at the same time, the figurine is provided with male genitals. The form of the head leads to suppose that the figurine does not represent either a divinity or an actual human being, but that it is a masked person connected with some cult. Masked faces are quite common among the figurines. There are a number of pieces which clearly show that the masks carried ox horns. One of these (a minotauros ?) found at a depth of 5 * 8 metres has the mouth and nostrils reddened. At 8* 10 metres other horned human figurines were found. The form of the mask varies and, in spite of rare divergences, may serve as a chronological index. A prominent type of figurine is that with a conical cap on the head. Figurines bearing this cap have not prominent breasts; further, when they are in a good state of preservation they are provided with male genitals. If a fragment consisting of a torso devoid of breasts and crossed diagonally by a ribbon or belt, which passes over the right shoulder and under the left arm, and with the right arm bent at the elbow and raised and the left arm bent at the elbow and stretched stiffly ahead, may be connected with these male figurines wearing a conical cap, these figurines could but be explained as representing a warrior (the so-called Krieger-typus, cf. Val. Muller, Friihe Plastik, p. 112), of which types are found all over the Aegean and neighbouring provinces, even as far distant as east Prussia, and according to Muller, to China, or a male divinity-the god of the sky. It is Muiller's opinion (I.c. p. 115) that the latest appearance of figurines of this type in the Aegean is the fifteenth century B.C., but that in Cyprus they belong to the second millennium before Christ. The depth at which these figurines are found at Vinca agrees with this view. Another characteristic figurine is one found at a depth of 7 - 7 metres with the head thrown far back and surmounted by a plume. The plume on this figurine definitely suggests the plumes worn on a fresco in the palace of Knossos. Before leaving these figurines I will mention that the oldest one, representing a person seated on a throne, was found at a depth of 6 1 metres; and the oldest of a person seated on the ground with no throne or chair at a depth of 8 metres.

Pottery.-This year's excavations have greatly enriched our knowledge of Vinca pottery both in regard to technique, forms and ornamentations. In regard to forms we have a rich gradation from coarse pithoi and shallow kitchen pottery to fine drinking vessels. Prominent forms of pot from 6 metres below the surface and downwards are vessels mounted on a stem generally painted red or dark red, and the anthropomorphic vase. Cup-shaped lids are not found lower than about 6 metres, but below that are large numbers of anthropomorphic lids with various patterns of incised ornament on face and occiput. This year, to compare with the rhyton representing a female figure found in 1912 at a depth of 6 * 6 metres, we have a rhyton, now named the Hyde vase, which was found at a depth of 7 05 metres. This rhyton takes the form of a fantastic bird. Fragments of another rhyton, probably somewhat similar, were found at a depth of 8 metres. Both these vesseJs are ornamented with ribbons of a black material which burns in the flame of an acetylene lamp. Ribbons of the same kind were found at a depth of 6 3 metres on a rhyton representing a person seated on a throne. The nearest analogy to this method of ornamentation is found in the Biikk district in Hungary about the source of the T'isza. There are numerous other reasons for supposing this technique to have come to the Buikk district from Vinca, but it is impossible as yet to say whether it was a Vinca invention. A discovery of much greater importance is that of a special form of pottery very reminiscent of Minyan ware, if, indeed, it is not a direct offshoot of this. A vessel of this kind was found at a depth of 65 metres, and horizontal parallel impressed ornament (rippling) about the neck and body of the vessel, occurred as early as 8 * 5 metres. This is a new argument for my dating of the commencement of Vinca about the beginning of Troy II, as Minyan ware belongs to the Middle Minoan and Middle Helladic periods. A sherd found at a depth of 6 *7 metres bearing a typical painted decoration for which parallels are to be sought in Cappadocian, Hittite and Macedonian ceramics goes. to support my opinion. The same type of pottery is found at Lianokladi II, where we also find Minyan ware, and this, too, would indicate a Middle Helladic date. V. Religious Objects.-Next in importance among objects of religious significance to figurines which may have been idols are very frequent miniature altars, although this year a number of objects reminiscent of Cretan horns of consecration have been found (6 * 2, 6 * 3, and 7 * 8 metres below the surface). I should no doubt further include the rhytons among the religious objects, in particular one from 7 * 6 metres in the form of a ram. Significant also are shallow marble vessels (" tables of libations ") round or rectangular, standing on short legs, and certain fragmenlts of marble tubes, found at a depth of 8 * 3 metres, evidently the spouts of a kind of cup (" Schnabel- kanne," spouted vase). VI. There are numerous examples of whole or fragmentary amulets of calcite, alabaster, crystallised gypsum and marble in the form of animal heads (at 6 * 3 metres a horse, at 7 metres a dog) or in the form of human figurines of marble. All the objects here referred to are either pierced or provided with a shallow furrow for the purpose of attachment. VII. Articles of Adornment.-Beads and bracelets of marble, fossilized shell, jade (8 . 10 metres), and metal (copper or bronze at 8 a 10 metres-a fragment 7 mm. thick and 11 mm. in diameter) have been discovered. At 8 3 metres two conical buttons of marble, each provided with a single hole for sewing on, were found. At 8 2 metres was found, in a small heap, a set of 29 fragments of fossilised sea- shell (dentalium), evidently the parts of a necklace. At 8 1 metres, again in a small heap, 16 small pieces of half worked stone of yellowish colour ready roughed for making into a necklace were found. The colour of the stone suggests that they were a cheap imitation of jade, of which a ring-shaped fragment with a furrow for attachment was found at a depth of 8-10 metres. [ 199 ]</page><page sequence="4">Nos. 141-142.1 MAN. [November, 1930. A 7 * 3 metres below the surface a clay pintadera with an intaglio of wavy parallel lines was found. VIII. Metal objects are very rare at Vinca; the earliest fragment of oxydised metal was found at 8 10 metres. IX. The finds which I have mentioned above together with other observations made in the course of excavating show that from the earliest period Vin6a possessed a form of civilised life superior to any as yet known in the area between it and the far Aegean. That superior rich and varied civilised life quite clearly derived from the south-east-from the Aegean, Asia Minor, not excluding Cyprus- districts with which Vinca indubitably was in direct communication. The problem difficult of solution however, is that of whether the connection was cultural or was also racial. A third possibility would, of course, be the early invasion of Vinca by colonists or by a small number of individuals from the south-east, who brought with them useful arts, such as that of mining cinnabar. Among these arts would be the working of marble, which has proved to have been carried out at Vinca, by marble cores found at 8 metres below the surface, clearly resulting from the boring of marble objects. Other clear cases of foreign influence are the anthropomorphic vase, the lids of which (the same applies to the heads of figurines) have a face profile identical with that of the figurines of Cyprus (cf., V. Muiller, Plate XLVI, Nos. 430-431), the high-stemmed cup and, more important still, the parallel to Minyan ware- for all of these have been clearly manufactured at Vinca. But it is just this Minyan ware, which may be regarded as a very special characteristic of a definite cultural period and that isolated painted sherd of Hittite-Macedonian type, to which I have referred, that leads us to see, in the connection between Vinca and the south-east, commerce and not colonization. Having none of the necessary indices such as would be required for the solution of this ethnic question I still, basing myself on the results of my excavations at Vinca, maintain my opinion that the relations between Vinca and the south-east were exclusively economic and commercial, in suLpport of which I may adduce the fact which Dr. Frankfort, in his " Studies in the Early Pottery of the Near East," Part II, p. 104, affirms. This goes some way to explain the dating of the commencement of Vinca at a comparatively late date after the commencement of Troy II. The economic reasons which Ramsay, Myres, and Minns have insisted on as the inevitable causes of connection between the inhabitants of Asia Minor and those of the Black Sea region are more than sufficient to explain the connection between the Danube Basin and the south-east, for the Danube Basin is after all but the hinterland of the north shore of the Pontus, with which the Danube provides a perfect means of commu- nication. This explanation does not necessarily exclude the quite numerious obvious local modifications of the arts adopted by Vinca from the south-east, nor does it exclude commerce between Vinca and Central Europe. At the same time there is no disputing the fact that Vinca influenced Central Eturope, which is proved by finds in the Buikk district. Work on all these problems, as on the problems of the relations of Vin6a to Macedonia and the Greek mainland have yet to be done. This short report, written without the necessary works of reference to hand, in the very throes of excavation, cannot venture on this. MILOJE M. VASSITS.</page></plain_text>
