WATKINS Résumé : Cet article de réflexion suggère qu 'en Asie du Sud-Ouest, au début du néolithique, l 'architecture traduit soudainement un sys- tème de représentation symbolique fort puissant, jusque là inconnu. On peut y voir l 'ossature d'un système d'enregistrement de symboles et ce, avant même l'apparition des premiers textes. L'aptitude à créer des établissements, à construire maisons et bâtiments publics, structures du monde dans lequel vivaient les Néolithiques, permit aux sociétés humaines d'évoluer vers de nouvelles formes. La compa- raison de la longue période Epipaléolithique avec celle qui voit l 'aboutissement à un mode de vie sédentaire et villageois imprégné, au début du Néolithique, d'un symbolisme architectural très riche, permet de fonder sur des bases solides les interprétations que nous pro- posons. Architectes, anthropologues ou sociologues contemporains de renom, s'accordent à penser que l'architecture est un mode de représentation symbolique très performant. Cependant il convient d'établir les raisons qui firent qu 'à la fin du Pléistocène et au début de l'Holocène les sociétés humaines eurent la capacité de produire de telles formes concrètes de symboles. L 'hypothèse que nous proposons doit être recherchée dans les théories de l 'évolution de la pensée humaine et en particulier dans l 'évo- lution parallèle des facultés cognitives et de la culture. Nous nous appuyons dans notre démarche sur les travaux du psychologue Merlin Donald qui nous sont apparus être à cet égard fondamentaux et, plus spécifiquement, sur ses idées concernant les systèmes externes d'enregistrement des symboles. L 'architecture, en tant que mode de sauvegarde des symboles, permit aux communautés néolithiques de devenir les premières à vivre dans un « environnement construit » riche en significations symboliques, qui rendit possible l'émergence de nouvelles formes d'organisation sociale, à la fois plus vastes et plus complexes.

The first version of this paper was a presentation at the 3 rd International Congress of Archaeology of the Ancient Near East, in Paris, May 2002. Like that presentation, this paper is dedicated to the memory of Jacques Cauvin. The ideas developed here have moved on from the original conference paper, because the- oretical work in neuroscience and cognitive psychology, on which the ideas in this paper depend, is moving very quickly. In that regard, this paper, like its original, should be considered as work in progress, and by no means a fully worked through and finished piece of work. Paléorient, vol. 30/1, p. 5-24 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2004 Manuscrit reçu le 5 avril 2004, accepté le 10 juin 2004 Abstract : The thesis proposed here is that architecture exploded in the early Neolithic of southwest Asia as a novel and powerful system of symbolic representation, the scaffolding of a pre-literate mode of external symbolic storage. The ability to construct settlements, houses and public buildings that represented constructs of the world that they inhabited allowed new kinds of human society to evolve. By comparing the long Epipalaeolithic period and the trend towards sedentary village life with the rich architectural symbolism of the early Neolithic, we establish the archaeological grounds on which the interpretations are to be founded. Contemporary architects, anthropologists and respected modern social thinkers agree that architecture is indeed a very powerful form of symbolic representation. However, we need to establish why the capacity of human societies to produce such concrete symbolic forms should arise at the end of the Pleistocene and the beginning of the Holocene period. The answer, it is argued, is to be found in theories of the evolution of the human mind, and particularly in the co-evolution of human cognitive faculties and culture. The work of the psychologist Merlin Donald is of fundamental importance in this regard, especially his ideas concerning external symbolic storage systems. Architecture as a mode of external symbolic storage allowed Neolithic communities to become the first humans to inhabit a "built environment" rich in symbolic meaning, making possible the emergence of new, larger and more complex forms of social organization.</page><page sequence="2">6 T. WATKINS In the last phase of the Epipalaeolithic and in the early Neolithic of southwest Asia, architecture emerged, in the sense that people began to create buildings that not only pro- tected them against the weather and gave them security, but also embodied symbolism. We shall argue that architecture was a powerful new "syntax" for systems of symbolic repre- sentation, the scaffolding of a novel mode of external sym- bolic storage2. The ability to construct settlements, houses and public buildings that represented constructs of the world that they inhabited allowed new kinds of human society to evolve. The starting point is with the work of Jacques Cau- vin3. The beginning of the Neolithic in southwest Asia, Cau- vin argued, presents quite differently from the preceding Epipalaeolithic. For him, it was a "psycho-culturel" phenom- enon, "la révolution des symboles au Néolithique", and the dominant symbols were of a female divinity and divine male principle. With allusions rather than by means of specific ref- erences and arguments, Cauvin4 assures us that the novelty was not the ability to formulate two- or three-dimensional rep- resentations, but that the concrete symbols are the outward and visible signs of an entirely new conceptual ability, the for- mulation of an ideology. Of critical importance in compre- hending Cauvin' s thinking are his references to the Annaliste medieval historians George Duby and Jacques le Goff (for their notion of "the feudal imagination" and their insistence on the primary role of "l'imaginaire" in the motivations of history) and the early twentieth century philosopher Ernst Cassirer (for his ideas on "symbolic forms" and humanity as Homo symbolicus). As recent discoveries are showing us, there was more sym- bolic representation than just the figuring of divinities and divine principles. Here, the groundwork of the revolution will be opened up from the creation of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic representation to the formation of architectural worlds. Cauvin5 often comes back to the conclusion reached by Robert Braidwood concerning the timing of (for Braid- wood) the adoption of farming, and (for Cauvin) the symbolic revolution. Why did the changes occur when they did, at the beginning of the Holocene, and why not earlier ? Braidwood' s answer was "Culture was not ready", and Cauvin in the end 2. The phrase that I am borrowing - external symbolic storage - was coined by Merlin Donald (1991). It is an important concept that is central to the thesis of this paper, and we shall return to it later. The significance of symbolic representation and the use of symbolic thought, as opposed to the construction of signs or the formulations of metaphors, is also discussed later. 3. CAUVIN, 1994 [rev. ed. 1997, English edition, 2000]. 4. Ibid. : chapter 3. 5. Ibid. could not improve on it. Braidwood explained that he had to keep saying "I believe" in his account of the beginnings of agriculture, "because the actual evidence for this earlier era is so slight that one has to set it up mainly by playing a hunch for it"6 he put it even more bluntly : "So far this theory is pretty much all guess-work, and there are certainly some questions it leaves unanswered. I will tell you quite frankly that there are times when I feel it is plain balderdash"). Cauvin could analyse the nature of "la révolution des symboles au Néolithique" in cultural and philosophical terms, but he could not explain why this cognitive and cultural faculty of modern human minds emerged when it did. We can now go further towards situating these new phenomena, if we seek to relate the explosion of symbolic imagery and architecture to advances in neuro- science, cognitive psychology, evolutionary psychology and the philosophy of consciousness that have been appearing in great profusion since the beginning of the 1990s. THE NEOLITHIC AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE EPIPALAEOLITHIC The purpose of this section is to relate what Cauvin called "la révolution aux symboles" to the extraordinary explosion of remarkable architecture at the beginning of the Neolithic, and to set that in the context of the long, perhaps episodic, his- tory of the trend towards sedentary life in villages through the Epipalaeolithic. Discussion of the Neolithic material is quite selective : there is not the space to engage in a comprehensive description of the new architectural developments of the early Neolithic, and much of the relevant material is not yet availa- ble in primary publication. The rich information from the south Levant (for example, from Jericho, Beidha, Basta and Ba'ja) is omitted, and sites in southeast Turkey, north Syria and north Iraq, which may be less well known, are used instead. Even Çatalhôyûk is omitted ; the site, its architecture and its vivid imagery can be read into this account on the back of Ian Hodder's use of the site in the formation of his ideas on domus and domestication7. A key factor in the Epipalaeolithic was the shift in settle- ment and subsistence strategies. The shift involved the use of nutritious plant foods that could be harvested in large quanti- 6.

The storage of cereal grains, grass seeds, and a range of pulses meant that people became as sedentary as they wished, living part of the year, much of the year, or the whole of the year in village commu- nities. Being located for part or all of the year in one place, relying almost entirely on the territory that could be exploited immediately in turn involved significant modification to hunt- ing strategies. As we can see from the site of Ohalo II in north Israel, dated by radiocarbon around 19 000 BP, the end of the Last Glacial Maximum period, some hunter-gatherer societies were developing these new settlement and subsistence strate- gies at the end of the Upper Palaeolithic and the beginning of the Epipalaeolithic period8. On the rich bio-archaeological evidence recovered from Ohalo II, it is suggested that the site was occupied at all seasons of the year9. By the last phase of the Epipalaeolithic, Period 1 in the Maison de l'Orient chron- ological scheme, equivalent to the Natufian in Israel and Jor- dan (12 000-10 200 ВС calibrated), some communities had become fully or effectively sedentary, living in permanent vil- lage communities and permanent built environments. There are interesting signs in the final Epipalaeolithic period that presage Neolithic developments. For example, Valla10 has discussed the large and unique structure 131 at Eynan, and shown how the large buildings of the early period of occupation at the settlement were probably sited relative to clusters of already existing burials at a lower level. However, as Cauvin has argued, there is a relative burst of symbolic activity from the beginning of the Neolithic, Period 2, equiv- alent to the PPNA of the Levantine region (10 200-8 800 ВС). The construction of symbols, however, goes well beyond the female figures and bull representations to which Cauvin drew particular attention. Communities of the earliest Neolithic showed a great deal of cultural concern with the architecture of buildings and the organization of whole settlements. Per- sonal experience no doubt colours our views, and the present author's approach was much affected by the experience of excavating Qermez Dere in north Iraq11. The whole settlement had been laid out in two contrasting halves that performed complementary functions : in one part, circular houses were excavated into a stiff, red clay, their walls and floors coated with plaster, and in the other part, all the occupation debris was piled up. Part way through its life, 8. NADEL and WERKER, 1999. 9. KlSLEV et al.. 1992. 10. VALLA, 1990, 1991. 11. W ATKINS et al., 1995 ; WATKINS, 1990, 1992. Paléorient, vol. 30/1, p. 5-24 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2004 the village was re-formed, but once again in two complemen- tary halves. This time, the southern half of the site was used for houses that were dug into what had been the dumping area, and all sorts of processing activities were carried out in the area that had been residential. The domestic buildings were extraordinary for the care with which they were built and the persistent maintenance and renovation that was lavished on them. They were also extraordinary for the pairs of non-struc- tural pillar-like features. I wrote that these houses reminded me of the ways in which we, in our cultural traditions, have made our houses into "homes". "Home", I later learned, is an example of a social construct12 : the people of the Neolithic were able to think in terms of the same sort of cultural abstrac- tions as modern humanity. For us, "home" corresponds to the social construct of the family, and we cannot assume that the same correspondence applies in other cultural contexts. The issue in this essay, however, is not the identification of the basic social structure of prehistoric communities, but their new cultural facility in constructing symbolic worlds repre- sented in architecture, the built environment and its fixtures, fittings and furniture. In southeast Turkey, we have learned of a series of early Neolithic settlements, all showing a concern with the organi- zation of the settlement, and the creation of monumental buildings. For the sake of brevity, we can do no more than mention Hallan Çemi, on the Batman Su13, which dates to Period 2, the early aceramic Neolithic, contemporary with the earliest (round house) occupation of Çayônii and, in north Iraq, Qermez Dere, Nemrik and M'lefaat. In the latest of its three building phases, Hallan Çemi had two circular buildings that were different from the domestic structures around them. These special buildings were five times larger than the ordi- nary domestic structures in this and the earlier levels ; they were 5-6 m in diameter, which is approximately 25 m2 of floor area, whereas the houses were around 2.5 m across, less than 5 m2 in area. They were fully circular (that is, with no opening in the wall for a doorway), and at least semi-subterranean, whereas all the ordinary buildings were built on the ground surface. Each of the special buildings had a semi-circle of stone-built bench against the wall. The floors of both build- ings had been repeatedly remade, using sand and plaster over a culturally sterile bed of soil. The special buildings lacked the signs of everyday life, but exotic materials (copper ore and 12. SEARLE. 1995. 13.

On the last floor of one of the special buildings, the horns and frontal of a wild bull were found, where they had fallen from a wall. Taking into account the wealth of small-scale sculptured objects14, there was clearly a great concern with imagery, symbolism and symbolic representation. In Periods 3 and 4 (8 800-6 900 ВС, the PPNB of the Levant), we must pick and choose among the available sources. Çayônii Tepesi15 sat on a terrace above a minor trib- utary of the Tigris, its houses aligned at right angles to the edge of the terrace, and set back from an open, public area. Apart from its first phase of occupation, the houses were large, rectangular constructions that followed quite specific designs. They consisted of an under-storey that was cellular, or in the form of a series of parallel sleeper walls, supporting a raised living floor. At Nevalí Çori, the settlement occupied a similar situation on a terrace above a stream, and the houses were not only similar to those of Çayônii in size, р1ад and con- struction, but they also changed design between cell-plan and grill-plan under-storey.16 Beside the houses of Nevalí Çori, Hauptmann found a roughly square, semi-subterranean build- ing with a terrazzo floor. It had been built, dismantled and buried, and then a second building had been constructed within the filling of the first. Both forms were similar. Around its, walls, there was a stone-built bench, into which were set at intervals vertical, sculptured monoliths. Two more, two- metre tall, T-shaped monoliths had stood in the floor of the building. The T-shaped monoliths with relief sculptures are only the most monumental of the carvings at Nevalí Çori. Both Nevalí Çori and Göbekli Tepe have also yielded many three-dimensional figurative sculptures. Çayônii, too, had a square, semi-subterranean building with a terrazzo floor, and it had also once contained mono- liths17. At one time, the "plaza" area also had been equipped with two lines of monoliths. At different times, there were other special-purpose buildings in the central area. The build- ing of which we have heard most is the so-called "skull build- ing"18. The skull building had been re-modelled and refurbished on numerous occasions, and had clearly had a long life. Its first form was oval and semi-subterranean, pre- 14. See the illustrations of a number of pestles with sculptured terminals, decorated stone bowls etc. in ROSENBERG, 1999. 15.

There were two pits beneath its floor. The oval skull building was finally filled with soil, and a second skull building was built on the same location, in part removing the remains of its predecessor. The second building was rectilinear, and was much modified and re-worked during its long life. At one time it had three stone- built cells at one end ; at another time there were four cells. These cells received deposits of human skeletal material in disarticulated form. There were piles of human skulls in one part of a cell, and long bones in another19. The "shrine" at Ne vali Çori, likewise, had been rebuilt and remodelled. As at Qermez Dere, the constant attention to re-working the archi- tecture is striking, as is the insistence on back-filling a subter- ranean building, and then re-excavating to create a replacement structure. The most remarkable of the southeast Anatolian sites, however, is Göbekli Tepe, currently under excavation by Klaus Schmidt20. Göbekli Tepe is a mound about 300 m in diameter and more than 15 m high, situated on a prominent ridge in the limestone hills that overlook the plain of Harran, near Urfa. It is not a settlement mound, for it has (so far) pro- duced no domestic houses or anything that resembles the nor- mal stratigraphie accumulation of surfaces and occupation debris. The matrix of the mound seems to be a vast accumula- tion of deliberately deposited broken stone debris with an admixture of occupation debris, including large amounts of chipped stone, considerable amounts of animal bone and a small amount of carbonised plant materials. Since the mound is composed of a great amount of domestic refuse, but is not a settlement site itself, it would be natural to look for settlement around the mound. All around the mound there are features cut into the bedrock, such as posthole patterns, cisterns (?), large cylindrical features and quarries from which stone mon- oliths have been cut. But these features do not constitute a set- tlement, and extensive survey work has found none closer than about 15 km, under the centre of the old city of Urfa. How Göbekli Tepe related to the communities that built it and made its sculpted monoliths is as yet unknown. In the mound, the excavators have found a number of structures, excavated to a depth of between 2 and 5 m into the matrix, and formed by great dry-stone retaining walls. Every 19. ÖZBEK, 1988. Till now, we have only a preliminary account of the human bone material, which is very extensive. F. Le Mort has reported (parts of) more than 400 individuals in just one of the cells, and her work on that cell was still incomplete (conference paper, Paris 2002). 20.

The structures range in date from the later aceramic Neolithic, comparable to Nevalí Çori, back almost to the beginning of the Neolithic (at least 9 500 ВС). The latest structure is the smallest, and it is generally similar in shape, construction and fittings to the "shrine" at the centre of Nevalí Çori. The latest structures contain the smallest mon- oliths with the least amount of figurative decoration. The ear- lier structures are larger, sub-circular, and contain more monoliths that are themselves much larger (up to 5 m tall) and more elaborately carved. In each enclosure, there is an opposed pair of T-shaped limestone monoliths (and the places where they were quarried can be seen on the eroded limestone surfaces all around the mound itself). In the earlier structures, more of the monoliths were erected around the perimeter of the enclosure, set at right angles to the retaining wall with their bases in a stone-built bench. Some of the early structures can be seen to have been rebuilt. Their second form was erected within the earlier retaining wall, the space between the old and the new walls being filled with stone debris. Some of the T-shaped monoliths seem to have been re-sited, their sculptured animals partly or completely hidden where they have been built into (or perhaps embodied within) a retaining wall. As at Nevalí Çori, there are other sculptured stones that have been found where they were dumped. The T-shaped monoliths were intended to be anthropomorphic, as they share the same features as those from Nevalí Çori, and one or two have arms and hands carved in very low relief. The raised relief sculpted onto the surfaces of the monoliths is almost entirely of wild (and dangerous) animals, large birds, snakes, lizards and scorpions. While Göbekli Tepe is so far unique, Neolithic settlement sites, displaying structuring of the settlement, architectural care with the design of houses, and the construction of com- munal, (semi-)subterranean buildings, are not confined to southeast Anatolia. Jerf el Ahmar, on the Euphrates in north Syria, close to the frontier with Turkey, and about 40 km north of Tell Mureybet, was excavated in the 1990s ahead of drowning in another dam-scheme21. It belongs to Period 2, the earliest aceramic Neolithic period, coming to an end as Period 3 began. In an open space at the centre of the village in its first phase, there existed a large, fully subterranean building (EA 30). The floor of the structure was more than 2 m below the surface, and the elliptical building ranged between 6.80 and 7.40 across. Stordeur believes it was "communautaire", a communal or public building, and argues that it was "polyva- lent", or multi-functional. Stordeur believes that it was at the same time a communal food storage facility and a building with religious functions, where meetings and rituals may have taken place. At the end of its life, it was emptied, a human head was placed in it, and in the central area a decapitated body was spread-eagled. And then the structure was destroyed by fire, its burning roof collapsing on the decapitated body. Finally, the structure was obliterated as the cavity left by its destruction was filled with soil. Stordeur22 has compared this building with a very similar, large, circular, (semi-) subterra- nean building at Tell Mureybet, "maison 47", of very similar date. At the very end of the excavations, as the waters were rising, a second, similar, cellular building (EA 7) was found, dating later in the stratigraphie sequence of the eastern part of the settlement23. It seems to have been the replacement for E A 30. Two human skulls had been deposited in a recess at the base of one of the post-holes for the posts that supported its roof, a foundation deposit that mirrored the skull and corpse that had been placed in EA 30 at the end of its life. In the western part of the settlement, at a later date again, another large subterranean building was constructed (EA 53) on the same general scale as the earlier buildings, but inter- nally quite different. Like EA 30, it was a complex construc- tion with a double skin of walls, the inner of which included a number of vertical timber posts. The circular interior had a bench running around the wall, and the bench had a kerb formed of large limestone slabs, decorated with a frieze of pendant triangles in relief. Six large roof support posts of fir {Abies), which must have been brought from some distance, were set in post-holes at regular intervals in the kerb. Finally, Stordeur24 mentions briefly another, similar structure that was found only as the waters rose into the excavations. It, too, had a kerb great of limestone slabs, each with a frieze of pendant triangles along its top edge. One of the slabs was also carved with an additional design that seems to have been a schematic representation of a headless human body. And that slab was flanked by two, tall stelae topped with vulture-like heads and a "collar" of pendant triangles at the "neck". Dating shortly after the abandonment of Jerf el Ahmar, at the very beginning of Period 3, the nearby settlement of 21.

W ATKINS Dja'de el Mughara25 included an unusual two-roomed, recti- linear building that had been used for the deposition of human remains. Some of the bodies were complete and articulated, but others were represented only by collections of long bones or skulls. In terms of numbers of human bodies or body parts and architectural or ritual elaboration, the "maison des morts" at Dja'de pales by comparison both with the "skull-building" at Çayõnii (and the small site at Kfar HaHoresh in the Galilee hills of Israel)26. When excavation of Kfar HaHoresh is completed and the details of the extraordinary depositions are available, when the extraordinary structures and representations at Göbekli Tepe are more fully known, and when there are fuller details on the cult buildings and their associated finds for several other sites, it will become possible to explore the symbolic "languages" that were in use, and search for the regularities of expression, the metaphors, symmetries and syntax. At present, it is too early. What we can see is that, from the later Epipalaeolithic through the early Neolithic, architecture came to be of great importance to many communities (and, as was said earlier, only some of the sites that might have contributed to this discussion have been cited). We see the interest in architecture in terms of the design of houses in which people lived, the structuring of whole settlements, in the creation, re- creation and use of special buildings, and in the special sites that were apparently ceremonial and cult centres for a group of communities. DOMUS, DOMESTICATION AND HOUSES Two authors quite relevant to our subject have written in quite different ways about the importance of architecture in terms of the role of the house. Ian Hodder27 wrote his book The Domestication of Europe : structure and contingency in Neolithic societies before the 1990s, "the decade of the brain", as it has been called, and before he began the new Çatalhõyiik Research Project. Nevertheless, Çatalhõyiik was at the front of his mind, and he unfolds his thinking about the role of the house - domus - in the ordering of societies such as Çatal- hõyiik, the control of things - domestication - that were dan- gerous (such as death and darkness), and the extension of that 25. COQUEUGNIOT, 1998. 26. GORING-MORRIS, 2000. 27. HODDER, 1990. ordering and control over the wild - agrios - as in plant and especially animal domestication. The ideas are based on the binary oppositions (male : female : : light : darkness : : life : death) favoured by fundamentalist structuralists, although there is no formal reference in the book to the work of Lévi- Strauss. By implication, this kind of structuring of symbolic ideas and modelling of the fundamental forces in their world was happening for the first time in human history. But Hodder is more concerned with exploring for us how his thoughts emerged and grew (for example, through the chance of hear- ing James Mellaart lecturing on Çatalhõyiik when he was an undergraduate student), and discussing how we as readers relate to his role as author than he is with any attempt to situ- ate this emergence of symbolic representation and structuring of ideas in prehistory. The book is perhaps the most explicitly post-modern (and deliberately un-scientific) of Hodder' s con- siderable œuvre. The anthropologist Peter Wilson28 argues for domestica- tion of a somewhat different kind, and he does situate it in the context of the change form hunter-gatherer mobility to the adoption of sedentism. His thesis is based on his cross-cul- tural knowledge of ethnographically documented hunter- gatherers, whom he divides into two distinct kinds. The small- scale, mobile hunter-gatherer band society (the anthropologi- cal hunter-gatherer type best known to prehistoric archaeolo- gists) he calls the "open society" : and sedentary hunter- gatherer societies, who live in permanent buildings in village societies, are the "domesticated" societies. Domestication is the effect of living in houses, living in villages. Wilson, it is worth noting, also wrote ahead of the great burst of literature on cognitive psychology, neuroscience, evolution of mind, and consciousness, but he formulates his ideas in terms of changes in human psychology brought about by the new, arti- ficial, built environment of village life. So far as one can see from the references he quotes, he also wrote without any close knowledge of the applicability of his ideas to the Epipalaeo- lithic and early Neolithic prehistory of southwest Asia. He argues that the way that we conduct ourselves is as much in response to sensory inputs as a matter of instincts, thus the adoption of houses and village life - domestication - involved new responses and new thinking. Wilson's analysis of modern, mobile hunter-gatherers shows that they rely on uninterrupted and unimpeded attention, so that each member of the group is constantly aware of the whereabouts of the oth- ers and what they are doing. These "open societies" are 28. WILSON, 1988. Paléorient, vol. 30/1, p. 5-24 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2004</page><page sequence="7">Building houses, framing concepts, constructing worlds 1 1 marked by an emphasis on "focus"29, whereas sedentary "domesticated" societies are distinguished by an emphasis on the "boundary"30. The adoption of sedentism was, he says, "a significant evolutionary event" because it challenged people's natural, evolved dependence on paying constant attention to one another. On the one hand, the change to living in a village of houses posed challenges, but on the other hand it also opened new possibilities. Wilson31 writes : "Architecture is a materialization of structure, and the adoption of architecture as a permanent feature of life introduces spatial organization and allocation as an ordering visual dimension". People natu- rally recognized the analogue between built village and com- munity, house and household, and those analogues might readily be extended to further analogues between the built environment that they create and inhabit and the world in which they live. Along with a number of anthropologists, Wil- son discusses the frequent examples of sedentary societies whose lives are structured in conformity with the structure of their villages and their houses. Like other anthropologists, Wilson can cite examples of sedentary societies whose ideas about the organization of the cosmos are modelled in the structuring of their houses and their settlement. This is not the place to expound this matter at length, but there are good examples of anthropologists who believe that the house as architecture is of great significance in the 'repre- sentation of ideas about the structure of the world. Lévi- Strauss has written extensively on the house as a social form, proposing house-based societies - sociétés à maison - as an additional category, not based in kinship, in the typology of social organization32. In the view of Carsten and Hugh- Jones33 Lévi-Strauss' theory of house societies "appears to represent at once a less deterministic, rule-bound version of his structuralism, a continuation of the general theory of kin- ship. . . and an extension of this theory to cognatic or bilateral kinship systems". Lévi-Strauss developed his ideas about sociétés à maison in response to the difficulties that anthro- pologists had in fitting the Pacific North-West coast people, the Kwakiutl (sedentary hunter-gatherers, we may note) within the accepted kinship categories. He was also impressed by the work of the Annaliste historian Georges Duby on the institution of noble houses in medieval France. As the contrib- utors to Carsten and Hugh-Jones'34 collection show, house- 29. Ibid. : 31. 30. Ibid. : 57-58. 31. Ibid. : 61. 32. LÉVI-STRAUSS, 1979 [1983a], 1983b, 1984, 1987, 1989, 1991. 33.

Interestingly, Lévi-Strauss argued that sociétés à maison are an intermediate form between elementary types of society and complex, that is hierarchical, societies. The house as an institution provides the social group with a means of avoiding simple unilineal descent, of developing continuity through time, and of accommodating both material and imma- terial wealth. In passing, we may also note that post-structur- alist and social thinkers such as Bourdieu, Derrida and Giddens also say that the house serves as a structuring instru- ment. We are clearly in good company. It would be better if we could draw on the support of anthropologists and archae- ologists. Some anthropologists and archaeologists have taken an interest in the physical characteristics of houses and the build- ing process, but few35 have considered the house as an insti- tution, and the interplay between house form, social group and cultural ideas. There is an interesting parallel between the pur- pose of Carsten and Hugh-Jones36 in stimulating anthropolog- ical interest in the social and cultural significance of house architecture, and the collection of essays on the social archae- ology of house by Samson37. Architects obviously believe in the importance of architecture, but are mostly concerned with contemporary or recent Western architecture in their writings. One quotation from one of the most eminent of writers on his- torical and contemporary architecture will suffice. If we want to see how architecture in simple societies can bring together the social, cultural and meta-physical with the physical, we should turn rather to the work of a few distinctive architects. The architect most cited by anthropologists and other archi- tects with an interest in the architecture of simple, small-scale societies is Amos Rapoport38. Having surveyed the disparate recorded information on house architecture among small- scale societies, and having also surveyed the general literature on the subject, Rapoport draws the conclusion that the variety of architectural forms, and the different ways in which they were occupied and used, cannot be explained simply as responses to the need for shelter from the elements in different environments or the availability of potential building materi- als. Such variety of response can only be explained in terms 34. Carsten and Hugh-Jones, 1995. 35.

W ATKINS of choice, and Rapoport39 concludes that the house is an insti- tution, not just a structure, its design primarily a statement of socio-cultural values, secondarily modified by physical con- straints. The forms of buildings in simple, small-scale socie- ties are the result of "aims and desires of the unified group for an ideal environment. They therefore have symbolic values since symbols serve a culture by making concrete its ideas and feelings"40. Rapoport, along with many other writers, docu- ments the frequent examples of societies whose houses or set- tlements represent in microcosm aspects of their view of the cosmos that they inhabit. THE MODERN MIND AND EXTERNAL SYMBOLIC STORAGE That modern anthropologists, architects and social think- ers believe that architecture serves as a structuring device in the thinking of contemporary or recent societies does not help us in interpreting what was involved in the rapid emergence of symbolic architecture at the beginning of the Neolithic. Simply to refer an analogy back to the prehistoric past on the basis of our contemporary experience is to assume that con- temporary cultural experience can be universalised. What we are seeing in the Neolithic of southwest Asia is the emergence of a new kind of human behaviour, full of implications of new kinds of symbolic representation. We need a means of explaining how a cognitive and cultural phenomenon arose that had never before existed, and why architecture with plainly symbolic references emerged at that particular time and in that context. The thesis that I want to build is that, by the end of the Pleistocene, the cognitive and cultural evolution of modern humans, Homo sapiens , had reached a stage where it could readily be triggered into the development of powerful new forms of symbolic representation in material form. The mate- rial form that proposed itself was in the construction and use of buildings. That particular mode was precociously developed in southwest Asia because of the early advent of sedentism in that region. And architecture was particularly suitable as the mode of symbolic representation because, whatever the architecture itself may embody, the structure provides a framework, a sce- nario, within which other material representations may be 39. Rapoport, 1969 : 46. 40. Ibid. : 47. housed, and all sorts of multi-media expressions (words, chanting, music, dance, ritual) may take additional meaning. In introducing evolutionary theory into prehistoric archaeology, we place ourselves in the cockpit of a long-run- ning conflict over nature and nurture. There has been a gen- eral rejection, or at least suspicion, of the application of Darwinian evolutionary theory to human history, beyond its strictly biological relevance to the emergence and evolution of the genus Homo. During that biological process of evolu- tion, however, we have to agree that culture - as we know it, among ourselves, around the world today, and in history - was not present in the same form throughout hominid prehis- tory. If nature played the more important role in the evolu- tion of the genus Homo , and nurture (culture) plays the only significant role today, there must be a stage in human prehis- tory when the balance was moving from nature to nurture. There is another difficulty that is not often recognized : we have grown up drilled in dependence on text to such an extent that most of us find it hard to imagine how non-verbal systems of symbolic representation could be effective. It is useful to recognize these biases and contemporary eccentric- ities in order to appreciate better the forms and systems of symbolic representation that are the subject of this paper. For societies that did not rely on writing, other visuo-symbolic modes of storage and transmission were probably much more efficient and effective than most of us can imagine. The societies that we are considering were among the first to experiment with systems of visuo-symbolic representation, and the first to experience their power. The beginnings of the process lie in the first use of pierced shells as personal orna- ment, and the use of red ochre, which we find associated with buried bodies. These beginnings date to the last part of the Middle Palaeolithic in southwest Asia and even earlier at sites in Africa that are associated with early Homo sapiens. Two- and three-dimensional representations of animals, or fantastic animal-human hybrids, and occasionally of humans begin the early Upper Palaeolithic in Europe and southwest Asia. I would assert that these are individual signifiers of various kinds, but that they cannot be seen as symbols within systems of symbolic representation. Until about 12 000 years ago, we see signs used like the single words that human infants first use. Then, at the end of the Epipalaeolithic and the beginning of the Neolithic, it is as if infants had learned how to put signs/words together into meaningful statements, in which the signs become fully symbolic like words that are syntactically related, not as signifier to signified, but to each other in sentences.

We can take as our starting point the emergence of a full mod- ern language faculty, that is, the use of language of the same kind and sophistication as all the languages in today's world. Historical and theoretical linguists have major differences of view concerning the evolutionary development of language, but they are relatively agreed that Homo sapiens have used lan- guage as contemporary humans use language for 50 000 or 100 000 years. The significance of a full modern language fac- ulty is that making speech or comprehending heard statements depend on our cognitive ability to handle systems of symbolic representation. Language involves much more than knowing the relationship between words and their given meanings. Words and the things that they refer to are indexical references, in the terms defined by the American philosopher and semiolo- gist Charles Peirce41. Symbolic reference, as explained by Dea- con, means that the tokens (words in the case of language) are given meaning by reference to and in contradistinction with each other. A statement, in short, is much more than sum of the indexical (dictionary) references of the words. The potential relations among words also help to make a further point about the complexity of symbolic systems. The references among words are at one level syntactic, but there are other kinds of ref- erence, such as semantic relations. The only species that has been shown to be capable of managing the cognitive sophisti- cation involved in language (a system of symbolic representa- tion) is Homo sapiens. If linguists are correct in their estimation of the time when humans first used fully modern language, then that is the time at which the cognitive ability to deal in systems of symbolic representation were present. What we are concerned with is the first recognition that culture, and in particular material culture, can be used to develop other, non-verbal systems of symbolic representa- tion. There are several cognitive psychologists, linguists and neuro-scientists working on the general idea of cognitive and cultural co-evolution - an evolutionary process where human minds/brains are stimulated by developments in culture into new ways of thinking and representing ideas. Cognitive and cultural co-evolution consists of positive feedback loops where human minds develop not just new ideas but new cul- tural media that in turn engender new ways for minds to think. The most obvious examples of such cognitive-cultural co- evolutionary revolutions are the emergence of a full, modern 41. Discussed conveniently, lucidly and in the context of language by DEACON, 1997. Paléorient, vol. 30/1, p. 5-24 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2004 language capacity, and the development of writing. In com- pany with a number of archaeologists, I have found Merlin Donald's ideas and arguments on the co-evolution of mind and culture stimulating and very exciting42. The essence of Donald's hypothesis is that the modern human mind has evolved further and further from the primate mind by means of a series of three major adaptations, each of which was driven by the emergence of a new representational system. Language, in the form in which we know it around our world, was the second of the modes of representation. We don't need to concern ourselves with the earliest, mimetic stage in the process, the first step beyond the cognitive facul- ties of other primates. Mimetic culture, Donald says, depended on mimesis, non-verbal action-modelling. Mimesis was "a revolution in skill, gesture (including vocal), non-ver- bal communication, shared attention" and mimetic culture could support limited public storage and transmission of knowledge. It was "a slow-moving prototype of human cul- ture". Here, our interest begins when what Donald calls Mythic culture emerges. Mythic culture is the form that is supported by the use of languages similar in general terms to those that we can find around the world today, and most scholars are agreed that full modern language emerged in Homo sapiens by or before 50 000 years ago. Mythic culture is oral culture; whose "governing representations consist of а shared narrative tradition". Language, Donald explains, gives us a much more powerful means of explicit recall from mem- ory, the ability to address and organize knowledge, and make it accessible to further reflection. Evolutionary psychologists, some anthropologists and a number of archaeologists have tended to take the view that, with the development of a full modern language faculty, the appearance of the first "art" (before 30 000 years ago, in the European Upper Palaeolithic) and certain other kinds of behaviour patterns (such as the use of personal ornaments, ceremonial burial of the dead, use of red ochre), the modern human mind can be seen to have emerged43. There are those who have sought to test this notion of a "human revolution" (that is, the revolutionary emergence of cognitively modern humans) against the archaeological evidence, and have found it wanting44. Renfrew45 has also challenged this view, arguing that "modern" human behaviour did not seem to be evident in 42. DONALD, 1991, 2001. 43.

Donald's analysis of human cog- nitive and cultural evolution has the advantage of offering a third transition to the most powerful mode of communication and storage. For Donald, whatever the significance of the transition to Mythic culture, supported by a full modern lan- guage facility, the third transition was to bring about the great- est change in human cognition and culture. Donald calls the third transition in his scheme Theoretic culture. Theoretic culture is supported by "external symbolic storage", that is a capacity to store information outside the mind of the individual, encoded in such a way that the author can recover it and others can access it. The beginning of the transition to fully symbolic literacy began, in Donald's view, with the emergence of a full modern language faculty and the beginnings of visuo-symbolic representation (evi- denced in Upper Palaeolithic art). It reached fruition, in his view, with the emergence of phonetic, alphabetic writing systems (beginning in the middle of the second millennium ВС and expanding rapidly in the early first millennium). Donald believes that the invention of "external memory" was revolutionary, because it involves completely new memory media ; use of external symbolic technologies allows the creation of qualitatively new types of representa- tions, and these in turn can produce effects in the individual mind that cannot otherwise be attained46. These may be, at first sight, very substantial claims, but we are in danger of under-valuing the power of cultures based on written texts, simply because we take it for granted. It is worth reading in detail to see how Donald substantiates these views of the revolutionary impact on symbolic culture of "external sym- bolic storage"47. Ideas and information encapsulated in external symbolic storage systems can be accessed by any number of people, over any length of time. Ideas or informa- tion can be criticised and reformulated, added to, synthe- sised and so on. He argues that the genetic makeup of the brain may not have changed, but its ability to link to an accu- mulating external memory store has afforded it cognitive powers that would not otherwise have been possible. He talks of our modern minds as hybrid minds, dependent on their ability to access external symbolic information48. The emergence of external symbolic storage systems is a cultural 46. Donald, 1991 : 274. 47. Ibid. : chapter 8. 48. Ibid. : 355. and not a biological phenomenon, but it changes the cogni- tive working of the human mind. It is also important to note that Donald is working in a mainstream of psychological research, and his general approach is one that can be found in other leading workers in the fields of developmental psychology and neuro-science49. In his recent book, Donald50 relates consciousness, the aware- ness that we experience, to the way that our hybrid minds operate in the symbolic cultural environment to form a distrib- uted cognitive network. He carefully builds up a model of the way that modern humans develop in infancy to enter this com- plex world. The human infant is born with a brain that is quite extraordinarily plastic, in the sense that it develops linkages and sets up connections as it grows in response to the cultural environment in which it finds itself. And with modern humans, that cultural environment is one that supports what Donald calls "deep enculturation", a hugely rich and encour- aging learning environment. Even without "external symbolic storage" in written form, modern human symbolic culture is capable of encouraging individuals to understand and work with all the abstract concepts such as marriage, debt, crime or etiquette. At a conference in Cambridge, Colin Renfrew and Chris Scarre brought together a group of archaeologists to work with Merlin Donald in order to apply his ideas and test them against the archaeological evidence of prehistory51. Renfrew himself contributed a critique of Donald's third transition, and in particular the idea that "external symbolic storage" began to become fully effective only with its cross-referencing to language in the form of alphabetic writing52. Like Renfrew, I believe that external symbolic storage networks can be non- verbal, and that they are not confined, as effective symbolic systems, to written language. Rather, a good case can be made (but not here) that phonetic writing systems were the applica- tion of already sophisticated modes of external symbolic stor- age to the transcription of speech statements into written form. Donald ascribes powers to cultures that employ external symbolic storage, and not only to those that use phonetic scripts. 49. Other psychologists and neuro-scientists with a similar view of the importance for the modern human mind of a cultural "scaffolding" are Andy Clark (1998) or Michael Tomasello (2002). 50.

The essential framework of these sym- bolic systems was the built environment of their settlements, which were designed to act as external symbolic storage net- works. Architecture is a specially powerful mode of external symbolic storage, for the built environment actually consti- tutes our way of living, makes concrete our social institutions, frames our perceptions and forms the arena within which social and other relations are played out. The settlements and buildings of the end of the Epipalaeolithic and the Neolithic periods, it seems to me, show clearly that people had begun to realize the symbolic power of architecture. We may appreci- ate the significance of the academic library as an essential "external symbolic storage" network, Merlin Donald's terms. There, we can each go and consult this book or that learned journal article, and immediately plug our thinking mind into networks of ideas, debate, controversy and references to many other written works in the same library. But then we leave the library and go elsewhere. The people of the Neolithic realized that they could create and then inhabit an external symbolic storage network. They spent their lives, as most of us do, in a richly symbolic built environment that both catered for their needs but also shaped their vision and constrained their actions. As infants, they learned the vital skills of social inter- action, as we did, within houses, in settlements, among spe- cial, monumental buildings. As developmental and cognitive psychologists tell us is true of ourselves and our own infant development, it would be true also for them, for the first time in human history, that their infant minds grew, developed their neural networks of cultural memory and matured within the context of symbolic built environments. Another feature of architecture was also of the greatest importance to the communities of the Neolithic. Buildings do more than offer shelter. They can be created to accommodate and furnish what we do within them. In medieval times, the Christian church was perhaps the epitome of this function of buildings. Most people could have read to different degrees the symbolic features of the building. Within the building, its windows, furniture and fittings, art and symbolic objects, together with liturgy, chanting and music enriched the mean- ingful action and ritual. It was the multi-media enriching of an Paléorient, vol. 30/1, p. 5-24 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2004 already richly symbolic environment. In our day, perhaps the great museums and art galleries perform a similar function of at once being symbolic and at the same time accommodating profoundly important cultural material. Some have even drawn parallels between shrines and museums, referring to visitors as pilgrims. The idea of museums as architectural places of dramatic encounter with treasured material culture, "theatres of mem- ory", was central to a recent exhibition, The Museum of the Mind , at the British Museum53. Mack reflects on the impor- tance of memory to identity, noting that psychologists link memory loss with identity crisis. The museum memorialises something important about our identities. Daniel Libeskind, architect of the Jewish Museum in Berlin and other major museums, has said that it is "the destiny of architecture to communicate and to evoke the conditions of memory"54. Mack55 describes the extraordinary "amphitheatre" con- structed by the sixteenth century Giulio Camillo, Professor at the University of Bologna, which contained some sort of physical representation of the ordering of all human knowl- edge, realised in such a way that the person exploring it was capable of committing all to memory. In the same century, Paolo Giovio built a villa on the shores of Lake Como, located, he believed, on the site of Pliny's villa. It housed a collection of antique Roman sculptures, coins and medals, arranged thematically through the galleries. The main gallery overlooked the lake, and was dedicated to Apollo and the Muses -hence the villa was called a Museum. Visitors reported that the impact was "miraculous". These were "thea- tres of memory"56, places crafted and furnished to facilitate the visitors' active encounter with important elements in their cultural memory. In the "theatres of memory" that archaeologists have encountered at many Neolithic sites in southwest Asia, drama and enactment are widely evidenced. These buildings were not simply built to act as passive containers. Buildings were repeatedly refurbished, modified, taken apart and rebuilt in a somewhat different form. Interiors were repeatedly re- plastered, and the plaster painted and burnished. The massive subterranean enclosures at Göbekli Tepe were excavated (involving the removal of between 300 and 500 cubic metres 53. MACK, 2003. 54. The quotation was recorded by GLASER, 2002. 55.

At another site, a settlement, dead bodies were disposed of, and later the partially disarticulated remains were recov- ered and buried below a house or outside it. The grave was revisited and the skull retrieved. Groups of skulls were later buried in small caches. There is adequate evidence from many sites that symbolic enactment was a constant factor in life. Finally, it is important to conclude with a consideration of how the emergence of systems of symbolic representation in material form can be accommodated in an evolutionary per- spective. If the argument is that cognitive and cultural co-evo- lution was responsible for the extraordinary architecture, sculpture, symbolism of the early Neolithic, it is necessary to identify the environmental pressure, the adaptive advantage. It is clear, at the outset, that in this context we cannot think of evolution and selection as operating in response to changes in the physical environment or the ecological balance of species. Humans evolved to operate as closely co-operating, highly socialized groups, relying on communication, adaptability and coherence. Since at least the beginning of the Upper Palaeo- lithic period, Homo sapiens have employed the hugely sophis- ticated system of symbolic representation that we call language, within the increasingly rich context of symbolic cul- tures. In evolutionary terms, Homo sapiens has been around for only a very short time, but human communities have devel- oped cognitive faculties that have become more and more powerful as a result of the way that cognition and culture have co-evolved to produce what Donald57 has called "the hybrid mind", or what Clark58 calls "the embodied mind". We are who we are because of the way that we engage with our richly symbolic culture and with each other. With minds and cultures that were for the first time qualitatively like those with which we are familiar, Neolithic communities were fashioned and embodied abstract social constructs that enabled them to live in new, larger and more complex social organizations. The environment within which the implementation of symbolic culture has evolved is essentially a human, social environment. Epipalaeolithic and earliest Neolithic hunter- gatherer communities operated differently from earlier hunter-gatherer societies in terms of the resources that they extracted from the environment, depending more and more on 57. DONALD, 1991 : 355. 58. CLARK, 1998. the territory immediately accessible from their increasingly sedentary settlements59. With the trend to sedentism there was also a trend for larger group sizes. The scale and permanence of communities grew, and, as Wilson60 has shown, living in permanent villages domesticates the human mind. As the size and permanence of the co-resident group increased, it would soon transcend the numbers for which the human brain's com- putational power has evolved. Psychologists like Robin Dun- bar and Lesley Aiello61 have argued that the growth of the neo-cortex in hominid evolution correlates with the growth in size of the social group ; as group size increases, the demand on the brain to keep track of all the social relations within the group increases exponentially. Dunbar has argued that lan- guage62 and aspects of culture63 have evolved in humans as group size and group complexity has increased. An essential problem for larger social groups is the matter of trust. Since human societies are built on sharing and coop- eration, trust is a fundamental requirement. As the social group size increased beyond the level at which the human brain can manage the mapping of social and inter-personal relations64, it became necessary to develop other means than the computational power of the brain to deal with the question of how to be insure against free-loaders and cheats65. In hunter-gatherer societies that engage in forward investment and food storage, as in farming societies, there were vital resources whose sharing and allocation is critical. Indeed, it became necessary to create the notion of "community" as a social fact66. "Neighbourliness" - how to behave within a co- resident group, cooperating, helping when needed, respecting the privacy of others - is another, very abstract, social con- struct that would need to be formulated. Another term that has become widely used among modern historians and sociologists is "social capital". It is used by writers discussing the information revolution and the post- industrial society67. In the industrial revolution other forms of capital, both physical and human, were of great importance, but Max Weber68 identified the fundamental significance of a particular set of ethics. Fukuyama69 defines social capital as 59. WATKINS, 1997. 60. WILSON, 1988. 61. Aiello and Dunbar, 1993 ; Dunbar, 1992, 1996. 62. Dunbar, 1996. 63. Dunbar, 1999. 64.

He is concerned with the disrup- tive forces in contemporary society, and the need to create a revised form of social capital in the face of changing techno- logical and economic, post-industrial circumstances, as the industrial revolution needed its new form of social capital. As the industrial revolution and the information revolution have involved transformations in the way that social capital is con- structed, so, he supposes, the agricultural revolution in prehis- tory would also have involved something similar. What we have been considering is the transformation brought about by the adoption of village life, the domestication of our species71. That transformation depended upon the ability of communi- ties to create social capital, in the form of common memory, common beliefs and trust. The notions that comprised the social capital of our Neo- lithic predecessors were no less abstract than our own. Much of the symbolism must remain obscure to us, because we do not have any of the corpus of knowledge that enabled mem- bers of those communities to read it and use it. Kuijt72 and Verhoeven73 have explored certain aspects of the symbolism and rituals that are to be found in Neolithic communities, arguing that they reinforced social coherence within the household and within the community. Given the architectural contexts for these rituals and symbols, we can see them as physical embodiments of the shared notions of the dramas played out in those "theatres of memory". Elsewhere I have sought to explicate the significance of the involvement of reli- gious beliefs and ideas of the supernatural in the Neolithic complexes of ritual and symbolism74. Boyer75 begins his study with the anthropological observation that he knows no example of a society in the ethnographic present that does not have what we would call religious ideas and concepts. He goes on to identify fundamental characteristics behind the apparently chaotic variety of religious ideas76. He argues that "cognitive constraints"77 determine that there are in general terms four "repertoires" of religious representation that are almost universal. People everywhere express beliefs in super- 69. Fukuyama, 1999 : 16. 70. Ibid. : 17. 71. WILSON, 1988. 72. KUIJT, 2000a, b. 73. Verhoeven, 2002a, b. 74. W ATKINS, 2003 75. BOYER, 1994a. 76.

The prehistorian Steven Mithen78 uses Boyer' s ideas, applying them to the beginnings of representations that we would consider religious in the European Upper Palaeolithic. In addition, Mithen argues the "material symbols are critical not just to the sharing of religious beliefs but in their concep- tualisation within the mind of an individual"79. The counter- intuitive aspects of supernatural beings or supernatural events make them hard to grasp and hazardous to transmit to others. Ritual is one way of "anchoring" these ideas through the minds, helping us to retain the ideas and to transmit them. Representing supernatural entities in the form of material symbols likewise "anchors" these strange concepts in the human mind, reminds the viewer whenever the symbol is seen, and greatly helps in the transmission of ideas to new minds and across time. Symbolic representations of supernat- ural entities need not take figurative form. Mithen cites exam- ples from the ethnographic record of simple, geometric forms that are conventionally accepted as representations of super- natural entities. If religious ideas are counter-intuitive and need "anchoring" in the mind to make them memorable, transmissible and stable through time and across generations, then ritual, while it may gain in value because of its repeti- tions, seems less useful than physical symbols. Physical sym- bols are potentially very durable, though even so they require interpretation each time they are viewed or used, and interpre- tation can be creative. The last step in the sequence is to consider why the archi- tecture of the special buildings, the symbolism and ritual should be concerned with religious ideas, rituals and the supernatural. We cannot imagine that the "invention" of architecture and the beginnings of religious feelings, beliefs and actions coincide in southwest Asia at the end of the Epi- palaeolithic and the beginning of the Neolithic periods. As already mentioned, we begin to find ritualised burial of the dead in the last part of the Middle Palaeolithic in southwest Asia. Among the earliest three-dimensional representations are the carved ivory half man, half lion figure from Höhen- 78. MITHEN, 1996, 1998, 1999. 79.

There are indications of ritual activities from several Upper Palaeolithic cave sites in Western Europe, and Palaeo- lithic specialists generally agree that some kind of religious beliefs were practised, even if the case for shamanism80 is not fully accepted. Indeed, the psychologist Robin Dunbar81 makes a case for the emergence of the cognitive ability to conceive of religious or supernatural concepts as early as the emergence of Homo sapiens. The capacity to formalise such concepts and share them within the community, he argues, depends on fifth-order intentionality (the capacity to reflect that "I believe that you think that we share our belief that God understands our needs and knows what we desire ") and the complex capacity to imagine worlds that extend beyond the world that we sense. Such cognitive complexity is exhibited among contemporary humans, and, based on the relative sizes of the frontal lobes of the brain in modern humans, prehistoric hominids and research on chimpanzees, he believes that only modern Homo sapiens has possessed the cognitive potential. Since the ability to communicate such complex beliefs depends on our linguis- tic facility, he argues that it is probably restricted to modern Homo sapiens over the last 100,000 years, the period within which most linguists agree that a full modern language facility has emerged. Dunbar82 documents the evolutionary value of shared systems of belief and close community : individuals who are members of coherent social groups tend to suffer less from physical and mental health problems, and recover better than single individuals or members of small or less coherent social groups. But these and other features of religious belief and practice (including the "feel-good" factor derived from sharing in par- ticipatory rituals with their associated singing, chanting, movement and dancing) apply to a long period before the time with which we are concerned. The key factor of a developed set of religious beliefs and practices for our purposes lies in the way that modern sets of religious ideas and beliefs gener- ally include notions of moral behaviour and altruism. The psy- chologist Susan Blackmore has taken a particular interest in informal "New Age" religions, and she has also been intrigued by Richard Dawkins83 theory of memes as another form of 80. LEWIS-WILLIAMS, 2002. 81. Dunbar, 2004 : chapter 7. 82. DUNBAR, 2004. 83. Dawkins, 1989 : chapter 11. replicator operating in a similar way to genes within evolu- tionary parameters84. Dawkins speculated that memes might be transmitted in loosely related clusters, rather as genes have been found to form complexes (labelled gene-plexes by Dawkins). He even suggested that clusters of religious ideas were perhaps the best example of the power of meme-plexes to be transmitted from person to person. Blackmore85 took up the idea of the religious meme-plex. She notes two features of religious ideas : a person's religious beliefs tend to consist of an often quite bizarre mixture of seemingly unconnected components ; nevertheless, such religious "meme-plexes" contrive to spread "contagiously" among large numbers of people and persist for centuries. They work so well at main- taining themselves across the generations because they have evolved to take advantage of the psychology of the modern human mind in ways that Boyer has discussed. According to Blackmore86, the particular aspect of human behaviour that religious meme-plexes exploit is the human propensity for altruistic behaviour. While so-called altruistic behaviour in various animal species aids the perpetuation of that species' genes. In human societies altruistic behaviour has little or nothing to do with indirectly perpetuating the indi- vidual's genes. Blackmore assures us that research has shown that altruistic behaviour that is reciprocated forms the basis for the good working of society. Research has also shown that people who exhibit altruistic behaviour attract the admiration of others, and people who are admired are emulated and trusted. Thus Blackmore concludes that memes for altruistic behaviour are likely to attract all sorts of other more or less related memes to associate with them. Mutually reinforcing religious ideas and beliefs, then, usually incorporating memes for altruistic behaviour, constitute powerfully contagious meme-plexes. With the emergence of sedentary village com- munities in the Epipalaeolithic period, and the growth in the size of co-resident communities that we see from the begin- ning of the Neolithic, people were encountering new social 84. Memes are defined as "units of cultural transmission". They act like the genes of biological evolution. Memes are transmitted from one human mind to another, and successful memes, like successful genes, transmit faith- fully and last a long time. Like genes, memes are in competition with one another and are subject to selection. The idea of memetic evolution as an addi- tional form of non-genetic evolution has been taken up widely. The American philosopher Daniel Dennett (1995) has given the idea a rational and philosoph- ical basis, showing how a general algorithm of evolution may be formulated either in biological terms with the gene as replicator or in cultural terms with the meme as replicator. 85.

We modern humans are constrained by our evolved cognitive ability to handle the complex web of social interactions of up to about 150 people87, but, in com- mon with our southwest Asian early Neolithic predecessors, we habitually live in social groups that far exceed that cogni- tive limit. Like us, they needed cultural means of binding communities together, making them socially coherent, and guarding against cheats and free-riders88. In particular, they needed new codes of (altruistic) social behaviour and norms of neighbourliness. Bundles of religious concepts need more than icons or images. They need to be located within the fab- ric of the society that they serve so that they are literally part of people's lives. The organization of the settlement and the architecture of buildings situated those concepts, constituting "theatres of memory" and scenarios for their enactment. CONCLUSION This essay has set the key phenomena of the end of the Epipalaeolithic and the beginning of the Neolithic within the framework of theories of the evolution of the human mind and culture. It does not attempt to give an account of neo-Darwin- ian evolutionary theory or, more particularly, recent theories of co-evolution of mind and culture ; some of these are refer- enced in the text and listed in the bibliography. In the other direction, the essay does not set out to explicate the meanings that may be embodied in the buildings and sculptures and how those meanings may have changed and developed over time. I have been concerned only to set Braidwood's hunch that "culture was not ready" until the Holocene into a context of theories of cognitive and cultural co-evolution. I would argue that the "reading" of symbolic meaning in the artefacts of the early Neolithic is a quite different task ; it is one thing to talk of the evolution of the English language from the time of Chaucer to that of Shakespeare, and something totally differ- ent to write literary criticism of Shakespeare's tragedies. In summary, therefore, we may conclude that the world's earliest village communities were also the first to develop fully modern minds and a fully symbolic culture. By fully symbolic we do not mean that people were able to construct and decode symbols such as individual sculptures, paintings or signs : that 87. AIELLO and DUNBAR, 1993 ; DUNBAR, 1996. 88. DUNBAR, 1999. Paléorient, vol. 30/1, p. 5-24 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2004 stage had begun early in the Upper Palaeolithic. Rather, we mean that cultural communities evolved the means to develop and use complex and multi-layered systems of symbolic repre- sentation. Such systems of symbolic representation were cog- nitively and structurally like language, which had been present in its fully modern form for several tens of thousands of years, but were articulated in terms of material culture (accompanied by rituals and other prescribed modes of usage). The stimulus for this precocious development of system- atic symbolic representation beyond language was the novel cognitive environment, particularly as it was encountered in the artificial circumstances of the built environment in the Epi- palaeolithic period. The stimulus became the medium : the built environment suggested that people should extend its arti- ficiality and construct buildings that embodied significance and meaning. The adaptive pressure for the co-evolution of cognitive faculties and symbolic material culture was the growing size and permanence of sedentary hunter-gatherer communities, the complexity of whose inter-personal relations was expanding beyond the computational power of human brains. The new, permanently co-resident and larger social groups needed artificial (that is, non-biological), cultural modes to ensure social cohesion and to build social capital. Architecture in the form of settlement layout, domestic house design and the creation of communal buildings consti- tuted the concrete forms of new social constructs. At the same time, architecture could also provide a syntax-like frame- work, within which various forms of symbolic objects and symbolic acts (rituals, social practices within the home, norms of neighbourliness) could take their place to build a richly, multi-media drama. Even before farming began to be prac- tised, the hunter-gatherer societies who harvested and stored cereals and legumes lived in permanent villages, and relied on the accessible territory around their village year on year and generation on generation. Long-term time perspectives and continuity were important considerations. The social capital necessary to such communities, and the trust that was vital to such a way of living required powerful symbolic forms. Fun- damental to the formation of these codes was the creation of "theatres of memory" that spoke of the community's shape and form, in which the essential dramas, rituals and myths could take their meaning. We can now see why "culture was not ready", as Braid- wood suspected, until the very end of the Palaeolithic and the beginning of the Neolithic in southwest Asia, in the light of advances in neuroscience, cognitive, developmental and evolu- tionary psychology, and co-evolutionary theories. Others,</page><page sequence="16">20 T. W ATKINS Mithen89 in particular, have sought to show how some of the theoretical work on the evolution and the nature of the modern human mind can be brought down to earth in the archaeology of the Upper Palaeolithic, and I have tried to develop a further point where cognitive and cultural developments can be related to the early Neolithic. Finally, we should return to Cauvin's idea of a revolution in symbolism at the beginning of the Neo- lithic90. The Neolithic, as I have noted elsewhere91, presents differently from the immediately preceding final Epipalaeo- lithic period ; there is a step change in the nature of material cul- ture. Several cognitive science specialists and neuroscientists92 have recently emphasised the point that the human mind does not operate in isolation. Human infants develop into cogni- tively normal humans through their interaction with other humans within their social and cultural environment, and our minds work as they do because they interact with others and with our shared culture. Lock93 speaks of the "embodied mind" that can only operate because of its ability to use the "scaffold- ing" of culture. Tomasello94 argues that the facility of our minds to operate in terms of cultural systems of symbolic rep- resentation enables us to think and to generate the state that we call consciousness. I would argue that the step change that we have been concerned with in this essay is the consequence of the generation of artificial, built environments that were laden with complex symbolism. People living in these built environ- ments would develop cognitively differently from their Palaeo- lithic ancestors, experiencing what Tomasello95 describes as a "ratchet effect". For the first time, communities inhabited the kind of rich, symbolic world that we take for granted.
