In the 19th century, Methodism was practiced by 25% of the English churchgoing population, and yet it was not until 1880 that its members were allowed to practice their own funerary rites in local churchyards. This study investigates grave monu ments found in the private cemeteries attached to Methodist chapels and compares them with the gravestones found in a contemporary planned Victorian cemetery that was divided into Anglican and Nonconformist areas. Before 1880, when funeral expression was limited, simple undecorated monuments were favored, whereas after this date, complex decorated monuments became more common. Within an environment of religious division and intolerance, some Nonconformists, those lucky enough to have access to private burial grounds, chose to express their identity by practicing selective consumerism and through the uniformity found in simple grave monuments. Introduction Those Protestant groups that organized themselves outside the established Anglican Church in England and Wales came to be known as Dissenters or Nonconformists, and often experienced discrimination at the hands of the state church and the secular authorities. Roman Catholics were considered separately from both Nonconformists and Anglicans. Methodism was originally a Christian revivalist movement founded by John Wesley in the 1730s. Among its aims was the desire to encourage the working population back to worship through open-air preaching. While Wesley himself was keen to stress that his movement should remain within the established church, at one point declaring, "I live and die a member of the Church of England," the Anglican Church soon distanced itself from what were seen as Wesley's radical ideas. In the 1780s, Wesley set up a Methodist conference to ensure his movement outlived him. The Methodists separated from the Church of England by the end of the century. During the 19th century, the Nonconformist movements boasted a combined congregation half the size of the Anglican Church (according to the 1851 census). This was a very large proportion of the English population, especially given that it was only 20 years earlier that these Dissent ers were granted the right to attend university, and the payment of church rates was suspended for those who attended alternative institutions. In the 1832 Reform Act one grievance was not addressed, however. Dissenter and Catho lic practitioners were not entitled to their own funerary rites within their local churchyard—a discrimination which led many unbaptized people, specifically children, to be "buried like a dog." This discrimination was seen all across England, but one case in particular caught the attention of reformers—the Akenham burial case, considered in depth below—and the subsequent media and legal interest resulted in a change in the law in 1880 that redressed this discrimination. This article focuses on the burial practices of the members of one religious group, the 19th century Methodists, during their demographic peak in England. Gravestones from private cem eteries attached to Methodist chapels in Berkshire and Gloucestershire, southern England, are com pared to the graves of Nonconformists and Angli cans within an early municipal cemetery, Reading Cemetery, Berkshire. The evidence suggests that before 1880 Methodists and Nonconformists selected simple stones, a reflection of a Meth odist emphasis on ideological simplicity. While the general distribution of gravestones between these groups is broadly similar, the specific distributions of simple, decorated, and complex stones varied over time and among Methodists, Anglicans, and Nonconformists.

This is the period from which most gravestones in the United Kingdom survive because an increase in their popularity and avail ability resulted in the gravestone boom of the 19th century (Figure 1) (Tarlow 1999; Mytum 2006). The early-to-mid-19th century was a period that saw population expansion, with the 1831 and 1841 censuses recording 24.1 million and 26.7 million people respectively (Daunton 1995). An economic shift towards factory-based work, with lower manufacturing costs allowing mass production and higher wages, precipitated the decline of old rural industries (Harrison 1998). Mass production entered the funerary industry, and for the first time gravestones became affordable and could be bought by a wider range of society. The funeral landscape was also changing, and by the mid-19th century planned cemeteries (as opposed to churchyards or private cemeteries) were being set up across England, France, and America (Curl 1993; King and Sayer 2011; Sayer 2011). By the middle of the 19th century, significant changes to social and economic life had taken place. The clergy and old aristocracy were still present within local and national politics, however (Scott-Baumann 1995), and it was not until the liberal governments of the late 19th century that the Church of England was finally removed from the workings of the state (Adel man 1994). For the historian researching death in the early modern period it is easy to focus on the major government acts as well as the high profile changes in public health and mortal ity rates in England.

This tolerance allowed individuals the freedom to worship as desired and effec tively legalized Protestant nonconformity. In spite of this freedom to worship there remained numerous restrictions affecting Nonconform ist and non-Anglican Christians, including the unlawful status of independent funerals in the local churchyard. The church and state distrusted religious dissenters, and so it was not until the 1832 Reform Act that the Nonconformists became able to raise their political consciousness and power. They wished to address five specific grievances: (1) The payment of church rates for the support of the local Anglican Church, (2) that marriages had to take place within the Church of England, (3) the lack of a general register of births, marriages and deaths, (4) the exclusion of Dissenters from university, and (5) the disallowing of burial rites within the parish churchyard (Thompson 1972:65). By the time these problems were addressed the Dissenters had become a powerful political movement, and the first four of these issues were resolved by 1836. Despite this change, the burial issue was left unresolved (Thompson 1972). This may have been because of the importance placed on the church's role as the link between life and death. Indeed this particular grievance triggered a response from the established church, and in 1876 15,000 Anglican clergymen, three-quarters of the clergy of England, signed a petition objecting to any non-Anglican ceremony con ducted within Anglican churchyards (Osborne 1878:1,744-1,745). Although put forth 50 years after the grievances were first debated, this peti tion shows the depth of mistrust that must have existed among religious groups throughout the 19th century. The church was being subjected to reform and was slowly being prized away from the state; this in combination with a growth in the Dissenter community and its increasing political power must have meant that individual rectors felt their safety undermined and their role in society threatened. By the 1850s, membership of Nonconform ist institutions was at an all time high, and the Methodists had a congregation just half the size of that of the Church of England (Currie et al. 1977). According to the 1851 census 24.3% of churchgoing people were Methodist, whereas 50.3% were Church of England (Crockett 2000; Snell 2000). In the 1840s-1850s the most popular of the Non conformist movements was Methodism (even excluding the Wesleyan Reform Union and the Independent Methodists), which had a mem bership of over 3.5% of the adult population (Figure 2). Drawing from the educated working and middle classes, Methodism had become a powerful religious community, and it was a social group whose members saw themselves as separate from the rest of society. This is demonstrated by Robert Ingram's description, as quoted in Andrews (1970:124), of the men who crewed the HMS Victory in 1805: There was a set of fellows, called Methodists, on board the Victory, Lord Nelson's ship, (to be sure he was rather a religious man himself!) and those men never wanted swearing at. The dogs were the best seamen on board. Every man knew his duty, and every man did his duty. They used to meet together and sing hymns and nobody dared molest them. ... They were allowed a mess by themselves; and never mixed with the other men. I have often heard them singing myself; and 'tis true, I assure you, but not one of them was either killed or wounded at the battle of Trafalgar, though they did their duty as well as any men. Ingram's 1880 book, Causes of the Increase of Methodism and Dissension, was meant for consumption by the Methodist community and therefore was hardly an objective eyewitness account of the Battle of Trafalgar. Rather, it must be viewed more as propaganda than his tory, employing a mythology of religious supe riority to reinforce group identity. The fifth grievance was finally resolved by an amendment to the Burial Act in 1880, but not until after protracted debate in the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Many of these grievances were discussed between 1870 and 1880 as a result of several motions to introduce bills or amend the law. These debates are primarily concerned with the discrimination against Nonconformists and Catholics, and the disallowing of their burial rituals in consecrated ground. This discrimination had become law in the Public Worship Regulation Act a few years earlier, meaning that an English clergyman who allowed un-ordained ministers to conduct ceremonies on consecrated ground could be</page><page sequence="4">118 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY 45(4) fl 4.0 i 1 1 1 1 &gt; 1 1—i—i 1—i 1—i " 1—r oo ooooooooooooooooo o &lt;j\ o t—rNon^-unvo i^ooct&gt;o«— rsim^j-u-&gt;vor^ oo Noocooooooooococoooooaiaio\o\o%o\(^ONON FIGURE 2.

The arguments can be summarized as an antidiscrimination campaign, in which the Nonconformists wished for more personal free doms, vs. the antidisestablishment church, which was fearful for its future, especially if it meant separation from the state. Two contemporary quotations characterize these views: [T]he law absolutely prohibited any funeral service whatsoever—in fact, it treated the unconscious infant who died before the rite could be administered, and the conscientious Dissenter ... with less tenderness than the malefactor who perished by the hand of justice, or the reprobate who had lived and died in avowed defiance of all laws of God and man. In this respect this coun try stood almost alone among civilized nations ... so that, in this respect at least, it would seem that even Italy—benighted and Catholic Italy—was more toler ant than enlightened and Protestant England (Osborne 1870:513-514). The Case of the Dissenters; and the injustice of the Burial Law. ... It is said, again—If you admit the Dissenters with their services to the churchyard, you logically must admit them to the church. In a courte ous and very kindly letter which I received a fortnight ago from a right rev. Prelate ... for which I offer my thanks, he warned me that the passing of my Resolu tion would be followed by the disestablishment of the Church, by the destruction of the House of Lords, and by the overthrow of the Monarchy (Granville 1877:1,878-1,879). These speeches given in Parliament may con tain prejudices of their own, but they do provide a good illustration of the emotions and conflict that surrounded the issue. They also explain why the burial of a laborer's son at Akenham, a village just outside of Ipswich, Suffolk, was able to become a major turning point in the establishment of the burial amendment.</page><page sequence="5">DUNCAN SAYER—Death and the Dissenter 119 The Akenham burial controversy began in 1878 and centered on a two-year-old Baptist child who was to be interred within the rural parish churchyard of an Anglican church, where the community was too small to have its own rector. The rector of Claydon (and Akenham) church refused to allow a Nonconformist min ister to contribute to the ceremony. He also refused to administer a funeral ceremony himself because, as a member of a Baptist family, the child had not been baptized, and so according to British ecclesiastical law was not a Christian. The controversy arose because "the sorrowing parents did not wish to have their beloved child buried like a dog" (Fletcher 1974:24). This quote was published the next day, 22 August 1878, in an article in the East Anglian Daily Times by a journalist who attended the funeral. The article attacked the rector's lifestyle and person, even going so far as to scandalize his conduct at the Claydon convent he had estab lished. The public response to the newspaper article was fierce, and the subsequent debate extended to the national news and international press. The rector, taking offense, sued the editor of the journal for libel, a claim which he took to the High Court of Justice. In 1879 he won an award of 40 d. despite his claim for £2,000, as reported in the East Anglian Times on 7 June 1879 (Fletcher 1974:235-236). The story seems to be straightforward, except when considering the role a journalist took within the incident; it seems possible, but unlikely, that a respected Ipswich gentleman was attending the burial ceremony of an uneducated laborer's child. Indeed, the payment of the £900 legal costs, the fine, and a small gravestone for the child was provided by a group of national subscribers, who, according to the 7 June 1879 issue of the East Anglian Daily Times, included peers, members of Parliament, magis trates, churchmen, Nonconformist ministers and laymen, as well as the proprietors of newspapers (Fletcher 1974:235-236). There is no doubt that this burial, and the events surrounding it, had been seized upon by reformers wishing to amend the burial law. Indeed, Fletcher (1974) demonstrates convincingly that the events of this case were directly responsible for the passing of the amendment in 1880 that allowed Non conformist ministers to preside over burials in parish churches. It is within this context that Nonconformist gravestones and burials must be understood. This is a period of increasing standardization within the funeral industry (Litton 1991; Mytum 2004b), and the material culture found associ ated with the graves of Baptists and Methodists is not significantly different from that of Angli cans (Sayer and Symonds 2004; Sayer 2010; Mahoney-Swales et al. 2011; Tarlow 2011). While it is possible that religious difference was not openly expressed in funeral commemo ration; indeed, and only evident in Catholic material culture through a more extensive use of crucifixes (Buckham 2003) and tin cruciform escutcheons on coffin lids (Emery 2006; Emery and Wooldridge 2011). The communal consump tion of gravestones by Nonconformists may, like their literature, celebrate community rather than individual identity, however. Figure 3 shows two etchings of the tomb of John Wesley, founder of the Methodist movement. The tomb is located at City Road Chapel, London. Wesley died in 1791, and these images were made between 61 and 65 years later, during the demographic peak of Methodism and after its separation from the Church of England. This tomb is notable only in that it is a standard late-18th- or early 19th-century pedestal monument surrounded by a later railing. For the purpose of this study, it is the style chosen to portray the rest of the cemetery that is interesting. In both cases the artists may be using a little license to avoid distracting the eye from the true object of the picture; if that is the reason the stones are all identical, however, it is then a contradiction that the artists chose to make them so large (compare the monuments with the people in the middle ground). The size of the monuments is not a true reflection of the stones that occupy the site today, many of which are contemporary with these pictures. This means that these images are the result of decisions made to represent the gravestones with a particular uniformity, and interestingly each image shows a different type of similar gravestones. They both show a cemetery consisting of a series of identical, tightly packed gravestones, and so collectively present a visual archetype of a Methodist cemetery as being a neat, well-ordered site that does not exhibit the flamboyant gravestones often</page><page sequence="6">120 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY 45(4) FIGURE 3.

This image fits into the general character of Methodist architecture, which, except for a few urban chapels, is usually simple, distinguishing it from the that of the Anglicans, Baptists, and Catholics (Stell 1991). While not explicitly part of the Methodist belief system, simplicity and practical architecture; plain clothing; and abstinence from alcohol, gambling, and sinful lifestyles were all part of a strict philosophy (Thompson 1972). Gravestone Studies Previous archaeological studies of grave monuments focus on their specific style and nature, and have been a part of archaeological research for the last 50 years. Most famously Dethlefsen and Deetz (1966) illustrated a change in the images represented on New England gravestones, from death's heads to cherubs, and urns and willows, between 1700 and 1850. Gravestone studies and the historical archaeology of religion have "long been minor chords" (Veit et al. 2009:1) within American historical archaeology. The work of Dethlefsen and Deetz (1966, 1971) and to a lesser degree Stannard (1979) have had some influence on British gravestone studies, for example, the work of Cannon (1989). The early American work, however, has developed into regional studies which trace similar or more locally determined iconography in gravestone selection (Stone 1991:146). Although these regional stud ies have had little international influence, this trend has also influenced British authors, for example Mytum (2009), who described religious differences in gravestone iconography from the early 18th century in the north of Ireland. Recent American studies have investigated themes similar to those available in the British literature, for example, Stone's (2009) impressive investigation of 164 cemeteries from Long Island, New York. Stone looked at ethnic and ideological affiliations and identified that, with the exception of a small English Quaker group, these social differences were expressed through the orienta tion of and the language applied to gravestones and not their shape or decoration. By contrast, Veit (2009) focused on iconographic change as a consumer choice and argued that early-19th century unornamented white-marble stones may have been the first sign of a "national gravestone carving tradition" (Veit 2009:138). While many American studies consider the regional and positional context of the stones they investigate, it is rare to see them con sidering cemeteries from outside the original chronological constraints set by Dethlefsen and Deetz, namely 1600-1820 or 1830. Indeed, American historical archaeologists seem at least loosely bound by this restrictive paradigm (Benes 1977; Crowell 1981; Baugher and Winter 1983; Crowell and Mackie 1990; Stone 1991, 2009; Veit 2000, 2009)—exceptions from the largely American journal of the Association of Gravestone Studies, Markers, include Veit (1995) and Richardson and Carlisle (1980). Markers is not an archaeological publication, however, and articles draw from local history, history, architectural history, and the decorative arts as well as sociology, religious studies, and ethnicity studies (Foster and Hummell 1995; Little 1998). In the United Kingdom, gravestone research has been conducted in York (Ellison 1993; Buckham 1998, 2003), Cambridge (Cannon 1989), Orkney (Tarlow 1999), and Wales (Mytum 1998, 2002), and has a wider chrono logical range than the American studies but usually focuses on Anglican monuments or those used in Victorian general-cemetery sites with no specific denomination. Aries (1994) and subsequent researchers, including archaeolo gists, historians, and sociologists (Walter 1994; Gittings 1999; Tarlow 1999) have seen the funerary industry as part of a rise in the social expression of individuality. Archaeologist Sarah Tarlow (1999) built upon and extended Aries's (1981, 1994) work in continuing a tradition of "psychoanalyst history" that Aries advocated (Aries 1962, 1981). Tarlow used her study of Scottish-island gravestones to suggest a national growth in monuments peaking in the second half of the 19th century, which she refers to as the gravestone boom. She advanced Aries's suggestions by developing a theoretical approach to the archaeology of emotion, but in doing so overlooked the Nonconformist involvement in gravestone erection. Harold Mytum used grave monuments to describe localized phenomena, such as the rise in the importance of the family in Irish cem etery organization (Mytum 2004a) and Welsh national identity in Pembrokeshire (Mytum</page><page sequence="8">122 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY 45(4) 1998). Cannon (1989) and Parker Pearson (1993) used monuments from this period as a theoretical device to show that the models of social hierarchy and status used by archaeologists at the time were wrong, or at least highly subject to the context within which they were used. They indicated that the wealth invested into funerary monuments was subject to social factors, such as group member ship and emulation, as well as social hierarchy. Given this context, Ellison's (1993) study is a bit of an exception, as she used gravestones in York to focus on local demography and mortality rates. Buckham (1998, 2003) looked at York's Victorian Cemetery and investigated identity, monumental display, and consumerism in a way similar to Veit. Notably, Mytum (2000, 2004b) proposed a methodology by which gravestones can be studied, describing their physical nature, setting, and the contexts of the funerary industry to formulate a typology for gravestone analysis (Mytum 2000). In British archaeology, gravestones have also been used as grand theoretical devices and as part of local heritage studies. These British studies rarely consider the position of these monuments within a comparative context, with the exception of Buckham (2003). Furthermore, despite awareness of the importance of Quaker and other Nonconformist groups, the only other major studies of Dissenter grave monuments within their historical contexts come from America, including studies by Stannard (1979) and Bromberg and Shepherd (2006). In the United Kingdom, Mytum (2002) com pared Anglican and Nonconformist burials, finding that, not unlike Stone (2009), the identi fied differences related to linguistic rather than stylistic factors, with the Welsh language most often used in a Nonconformist context. Unfor tunately his results cannot be used for reliable comparisons, as those interred within Anglican churchyards may include Nonconformists who did not have access to a private cemetery (Snell 2000). As the denominational association of gravestones from a parish churchyard is not distinguishable, the degree of influence Non conformists would have had on the gravestone sample cannot be ascertained. Comparisons can only take place where there are distinctly dif ferent areas within a site or where different denominational grounds distinguish Anglicans, Nonconformists, and Catholics. Other factors, such as a preference for burial in family clusters or space constraints must also be taken into account (Buckham 2003:165). Stannard's (1979) research tackled the con cepts of early modern religion, culture, social change, and identity that are all central to the use of grave monuments from any period of archaeological inquiry. But cemeteries also played a vital part in the process of death and mourning, and as a place for families, communi ties, and individuals to express aspects of their own as well as the deceased's identity. Private cemeteries are rare and often small or likely to have been cleared for modern development, however (Sayer and Symonds 2004). By con trast, Methodist and other Dissenter communi ties were widespread across England and faced discrimination and an intolerance that affected their funerary culture, just as in Protestant groups across postmedieval Europe, the French Huguenots, for example (Roberts 2000). As its point of departure this study takes an underval ued archaeological resource from a marginal, but important, religious community and places it within its historical context. It is through this detailed contextualization that patterns and changes in the decisions that went into monu ment selection can be appropriately understood in an English 19th-century sample. Methodology In North Wales, an area with the highest density of Nonconformists in the British Isles, "[t]he Wesleyan Methodists had ... 210 Welsh chapels; of these 3 had graveyards, and 207 had none" (Richard 1871:1,640). This short, contemporary citation highlights one of the most significant problems with studies of this type, the rarity of Nonconformist memorial sites; as a result, two counties were studied: Berkshire and Gloucestershire. Together, the sample from these counties consisted of 11 sites with 19th-century stones. Gravestones were recorded from 1800 to ca. 1914, the period in which monumental expression had not been altered by the massive loss of life experienced in the world wars. No monuments were seen that predated this period. While this is a small sample, 178 stones, it is the entire collection from these two counties and so is a representative group from the 19th cen tury. These were then compared with a sample of 1,144 stones from the Nonconformist and</page><page sequence="9">DUNCAN SAYER—Death and the Dissenter 123 Anglican areas of Reading Cemetery to identify if there were any patterns specific to a particular group, or if they all shared the 19th-century boom in gravestone erection as identified by Tarlow (1999). The monument details were recorded using a system adapted from Mytum (2000), with the objective to record the date, decoration, and shape of the stone. The shape of the stone was used to determine if it is simple or complex. Simple stones consisted of two or fewer elements and were usually rectangular, oval, or arch topped. Complex gravestones consisted of more than two elements and so had a much more composite shape, giving a different aesthetic to the graveyard. These elements could include railings, shoulders, plinths, crosses, crowns, pillars, cut-away sides, central inscription panels, or anthropomorphic shapes. Decoration was usually incised or embossed on the surface of the stone and included flowers, crosses, shaking hands, stars, abstract decoration, or birds of peace. Figure 4 shows simple, complex, and decorated gravestones. The initial intention of this study was to approach each site as a separate unit and consider the relationships of the decorative gravestones within it. Unfortunately, a surprise at the begin ning of the project was the rarity of these sites, and so working with a smaller set of stones than expected has meant the whole sample was consid ered as a single group. To allow for the effect of each stone to be considered, however, the shape of the monument was recorded separately from the decoration on it. At any distance from the stones the decorative elements on their surfaces were less noticeable than the overall shape of the monu ment. All of these aspects affect the nature of a viewer's relationship with those monuments and with the cemetery as a whole, so an individual placing a gravestone within these sites may have considered the overall aesthetic of the cemetery FIGURE 4.

The viewer's experience is then dictated not just by the physical impression of the stones but also by the nature of the context within which they experience them. Results The purpose of this study was to investigate the overall aesthetic of Methodist cemeteries and to compare gravestone complexity and decorative elements from different contexts. Certain visual trends seemed to be consistent within individual sites, for example, the Newbury and Maidenhead memorials consisted almost entirely of low and table tombs, but the overall trends seem to fit the whole sample. Table 1 lists all of the sites visited and the number of stones that survive today. There were 29 types of monument within this sample. Figure 5 shows the types of monument seen in this survey against the ranges of dates recorded on them; subtypes are not individually illustrated. Despite this large number of types, many were made up of just a single stone, and only two of these single-stone types were early; both dated to ca. 1840 (Figure 5, far right). This result could be attributed to the gravestone boom described by Tarlow (1999); compare this with Figure 1. To investigate this possibility, the number of gravestones within the sample was plotted within 10-year groups, as can be seen in Figure 6. Figure 6 shows a very similar pattern to Tarlow's, with a peak around ca. 1900 and a dramatic decline after this date. The post-1900 increase seems to occur despite the decreasing membership of the Methodist community after ca. 1870 (Figure 2). This boom is not the only answer, however, and it does not explain the sudden diversification in the types of monument used in the latter half of the century. Figure 7 plots the simple and complex stones in 10-year increments; it again fits with the gen eral pattern expected with the gravestone boom between ca. 1800 and 1900, when both types of 1900 1860 1840 1820 1800 □ Q ? 9 o 1 Oo D Q 0 &amp; Q B Q □ ♦ ♦ Monument type FIGURE 5.

The decline in the number of simple monuments after ca. 1880 coincides with the increase in complex ones. This figure shows that there are more monuments overall, with an average of 16 erected every decade between ca. 1840 and 1900. The erection of complex monuments increases independently of this growth in gravestone numbers after ca. 1880, however, when the curve jumps from below 5 in every year to over 15. By 1880 complex monuments have become almost as popular as the simple monuments. The same is true for decorated monuments, meaning those with added decoration on the body of the monu ment. Figure 8 plots the numbers of decorated monuments, within 10-year groups, against time. Between ca. 1800 and 1840 the number of decorated monuments remains consistently low, but it increases in the 1840s (Figure 6), a rise consistent with the rest of the sample. The curve increases again dramatically after ca. 1880, however, in a trend independent of the overall numbers of monuments (Figures 6,7), suggesting a dramatic explosion in the selection of decorated monuments after ca. 1880. Comparison This analysis reveals a uniformity of choice that drove the consumption of gravestones represented FIGURE 6.

The total number of monuments, total Anglican monuments, and total Nonconformist monuments from Reading Cemetery plotted against five-year increments. All three groups show a general trend toward a boom in the late 19th century. (Graph by author, 2008.) within small private cemeteries. This choice seems to lie not in the styles of the gravestones within individual cemeteries, which contained a variety of types of monument across the sample, but in the uniformity of simple, undecorated monu ments selected for display in a single cemetery. Given the small size of this sample, however, it would be better understood within a comparative study. The results from the private cemeteries are interesting as the communities were allowed their own rituals and could easily have engaged in competitive display and class expression, as was the case in other 19th-century cemeteries (Tarlow 1999; Mytum 2004b). The absence of this competition seems initially to contradict Mytum's (2002) study of Nonconformist gravestones, as he had more decorated Nonconformist monuments than Anglican ones. Much of his sample is made up of 20th-century monuments, however, and so it is probably a continuation of the post-1880 trend visible in the present study's data. Earlier stones are rarer, but in comparison with Reading Cemetery, which has two separate areas, it may be possible to conduct a comparison of 19th-century Nonconformist and Anglican gravestones. Reading Cemetery, Berkshire, was established in 1843, the same year as the publication of John Clausius Loudon's influential monograph, On the Laying Out, Planting, and Managing of Cemeter ies (Curl 1993:244-264). The planners of Read ing Cemetery did not adopt many of Loudon's ideas into its design, however. Unlike many of the later garden cemeteries, which were influ enced by Loudon, Reading Cemetery separated Nonconformist and Anglican burial areas. This is fortuitous, as it offers the opportunity to study late-19th-century Anglican gravestones, knowing that they were not systematically mixed with Nonconformist ones, and to compare the two different groups in a sample from the same site. The sample collected consisted of the 1,144 stones, 526 Nonconformist and 618 Anglican. The number of stones in each five-year period between 1845 and 1914 can be seen in Figure 9; the sample also includes evidence for the gravestone boom observed by Tarlow (Figure 1) and seen in the sample from the private cemeteries (Figure 6). This latter graph shows that both groups' gravestones increase in number consistently until a peak around 1885-1900</page><page sequence="14">128 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY 45(4) before declining. The same trend is also visible in the total sample, seen in Figure 9, but it may be worth noting that in comparison, the Non conformists' stone numbers decline less than the Anglicans' and arguably continue to be erected consistently. The cemetery was extended in the early 20th century to allow more Anglican burials to take place, however, and given the constant number of burials in the Nonconformist area vs. the general decline in Nonconformity in the early 20th century, this may be more about the use of space than about specific areas in the site. Using the same method as in the Methodist sample, the complex and simple monuments were recorded in each area. Figure 10 plots simple, complex, and decorated monuments for the Anglican sample, and when compared with Figure 9 shows a remarkable similarity in the numbers of these stones. The Anglicans chose to erect simple and complex stones in equal numbers during the late 19th century. Indeed, these three different categories each followed the same trend at the end of the century. By comparison, the Nonconformist sample shows a different pattern. Figure 11 illustrates the same general trend for simple and decorated gravestones, numbers increasing with the grave stone boom of the late 19th century. The trend visible among the complex gravestones does not follow that pattern, however, rather like the Methodist sample it increased dramatically with up to four times the number of complex monuments being erected after ca. 1880. The small spike in stones in the 1855-1859 entry can be explained through the erection of a set of unique cylindrical iron monuments by two prominent families (Figure 12). They were located on either side of the Nonconformist chapel, and shortly afterwards several elaborate tombs were erected in the chapel area. Com petitive display was part of the Nonconformist portfolio, but given that this is an anomaly in the data it suggests that complex monuments were rarely selected for use in this way. Indeed, this larger sample of general Nonconformists complements the results seen in the Method ist sample by showing a sudden increase in 60 / / ' a/' / / ' ' / ✓ ' /v/' / / ' &lt;^/' / / ' » /' / / ' a/' / / ' * /' ^ ^ ^°&gt; ^ ^ ^ Simple Complex Decorated FIGURE 10.

These two monuments seem to have started a short-lived phase of competitive display in the mid-19th century.

Decorated monuments show a similar but slightly different pattern, with a small increase in the 1870s and a much larger one in the 1880s. The gravestones were not necessarily those of Methodists, although the majority may be, and so individual families may not have collectively chosen undecorated stones as they did in the Methodist cemeteries. Catholics, for example, may have chosen crucifix decorations on their gravestones as they did in Buckham's (2003) contemporary York cemetery study. Discussion Buckham (2003) and Veit (2009) have both shown that selective consumerism is an impor tant component of monument erection. Mytum (2002, 2009) and Stone (2009) have both shown that religious and ethnic identities con tribute important characteristics of gravestone design. In both England and America, however, gravestone types and their decorative ele ments increase over time; this is related to the increased use of mass-production technologies</page><page sequence="16">130 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY 45(4) FIGURE 13.

(Photos by author, 2008.) and steam transport. In light of these develop ments it might be expected that the complex and decorated gravestones would increase in numbers over time and could account for the data seen in this study. The comparison between the three samples shows a pattern that cannot be accounted for in this way, however. The Anglican results show similar numbers</page><page sequence="17">DUNCAN SAYER—Death and the Dissenter 131 of complex and decorated monuments in the pre-18 80 sample, where decorated monuments were mostly absent in the two Nonconformist samples. These Nonconformists were selectively consuming to express a religious social identity, not through the use of particular decorative ele ments, but through the use of stylistic simplicity. The data presented demonstrates that com plex and decorated gravestones were available throughout the 19th century, but in the Method ist sample both complex and decorated monu ments became popular only after ca. 1880, a date which corresponds convincingly with the amendment to the burial law discussed previ ously. The larger Nonconformist sample, from Reading, also supports these observations, and the erection of more complex monuments increases by up to four times post-1880. This trend is not repeated in the Anglican sample, where complex, simple, and decorated monu ments are proportionally represented. Many Nonconformists had to be buried with an Anglican ritual, as they did not have access to a liberal rector. The frustration they must have felt is almost palpable in the historical record. Indeed, the scale of the public reaction to the Akenham burial case reveals a shared experience of loss and discrimination across the country. The members of a chapel with a private cemetery were the lucky ones who found them selves within a community that could control its own funerary rituals. The pattern in the archaeo logical record is testimony to an expression of stylistic simplicity within pre-1880 Methodist gravestone selection. This trend is also visible within the wider Nonconformist sample at Read ing. Although Methodists would probably have been the most popular of the religious groups, cemeteries would also have included other Non conformist denominations, as well as Catholics and Jews, all of whom experienced discrimina tion. It does not seem possible that the results seen in this study are the product of coinci dence. Instead, after the burial grievances were addressed in 1880 the individuals within these communities began to choose more freely and selected more elaborate or artistically expressive monuments to commemorate their dead. Childe (1945) was among the first archaeolo gists to suggest that the variation between funer ary monuments within a particular social group increases in times of political crisis (Parker Pearson 1999:87). The result of these surveys suggests a different pattern, however. Methodists chose to express their differences from the rest of society in literature and lifestyle. As an orga nization Methodism was placed under political and economic stress. Yet as a socially marginal ized group the expression seen in the erection of funerary monuments was not varied and elaborate but simple, and if not totally uniform, then it was certainly more restrained than the technology and market allowed. Indeed, these results mirror the conclusions of Jones (1997), who observed that under conditions of stress religious groups pull together to maintain a distinctive culture. Unlike Jones's examples and Mytum's (1998) Welsh case study, these grave stones are not a reflection of an independent culture and do not express national or ethnic identities. Trends in the material remains of these Nonconformists could be better described as selective consumerism amongst a social minority to express a shared religious identity in the face of state discrimination. The period of highest variation between mon uments in this study was post-1880, a period marked by the acceptance of a Nonconformist minister's place within funerary rituals imme diately following the resolution of the burial grievance. Gravestone selection is complex and personal, however, and while monumental variation can express the power or importance of the deceased—and their families—simplicity in funerary expression may reflect restraint in the face of social marginalization or political adversity. Before 1880 gravestones seem to have been selected not to express a dead person's individuality, wealth, or family relations, but to fit into the broader aesthetic of cemetery space. Figure 13 illustrates this aesthetic by contrasting parts of the Anglican and Nonconformist areas of Reading Cemetery. Through the presence of simple monuments, the landscape of private cemeteries looked and felt uniform as befit ted the Methodist philosophy for using simple architecture. Conclusion The gravestones evident in this study were simple, undecorated monuments selected to fit into a uniform funerary landscape that existed until 1880, an appropriate date, as it marked</page><page sequence="18">132 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY 45(4) an important social victory for the Dissenter community. It was a date that saw legal change and allowed the Nonconformists the right to use their own funerary rituals. The 19th cen tury saw a transformation in the expression of identity through Methodist funerary monuments that was not seen in the Anglican sample. It was after this legal change that the gravestones became more complex and more decorated. The simplicity in expression employed under the oppression from church and state was no longer necessary: the final of the five grievances had been resolved and the Dissenters had the same religious freedoms as members of the Church of England. Ironically, it is from the last third of the 19th century that the membership of the Methodist Church started to decline in England.
