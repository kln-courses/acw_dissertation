<plain_text><page sequence="1">532 Reviews [Auk, Vol. 100 The Bam Owl.-D. S. Bunn, A. B. Warburton, and R. D. S. Wilson. 1982. Vermillion, South Dakota, Bu- teo Books. 246 pp., 31 black-and-white photographs, 39 tables, 11 figures, three appendices. $32.50.-The Barn Owl (Tyto alba) occupies more space in the or- nithological literature than most owls, and a mono- graph on the species is welcome. Bunn, Warburton, and Wilson write enthusiastically from a combined total of 38 yr of experience (19 calendar years). All of their work, primarily observations of behavior, was done in Britain, and the best parts of the book are those that describe these studies. Outside of Britain they rely on the literature, and there are some sig- nificant omissions. Chapter 1 contains a grab-bag of topics. The dis- cussion of Barn Owl taxonomy includes widely ac- cepted schemes as well as one considering tytonids to be nocturnal falcons. Left out was Cracraft's (1981. Auk 98: 681) classification, which, in fairness, ap- peared in print only 1 yr before this book. A com- prehensive physical description of T. a. alba, the pri- mary subject of this monograph, occupies 41/2 somewhat rambling pages. Lesser coverage is given to T. a. guttata, which occurs accidentally in Britain. Thirty-three other subspecies are given scant cov- erage, although the authors correctly state that many of the races have received little attention from orni- thologists. Two new subspecies proposed by Parkes and Phillips (1978. Ann. Carnegie Mus. 47: 479) are not included. Under geographic distribution, the authors' state- ment that Bam Owls are basically sedentary and ad- verse to crossing large expanses of water is out of character with the widespread distribution of Barn Owls; included in the Bam Owl's range are islands 960 km from the mainland. Later, the authors pro- pose that most island Barn Owls were endemic be- fore the islands that they inhabit separated from the mainland. This ignores such evidence as the volcanic origin of the Galapagos Islands and the endemic race of Barn Owls that exists there. Brief synopses of other species in the family Tytonidae and of fossil Tyto end this section. Next, we are given the Barn Owl's major special- izations for a nocturnal predatory existence. Low- light vision is discussed but Dice's (1945. Amer. Nat- ur. 79: 385) pioneering work is not cited. Nearly three pages are devoted to the anatomy and physiology of the eye but no references are given, even though it was previously stated by the authors that they were relying on the work of others. Anecdotal evidence from their own research is then presented to illus- trate some weaknesses in Barn Owl vision. They are particularly interested in showing that Barn Owls do not perceive large unmoving objects, including hu- mans, at night. Several pages are devoted to Payne's important studies on auditory localization in Barn Owls but no mention is made of the numerous and more recent papers on the same subject by Konishi and his stu- dents (e.g. 1973. Amer. Natur. 107: 775; 1979. J. Comp. Physiol. 133: 1). Konishi's first paper in this series is cited later, however, under food consumption (p. 100). This chapter ends with a short discourse on flight mechanics from the authors' observations. Voice is covered in Chapter 2. By the authors' ad- mission, verbal descriptions do not give a very good idea of the actual character of the calls. I agree. The vocalizations are difficult to describe. Seventeen acoustic signals are identified (15 vocal and two non- vocal) and the context and possible function of each is given. I could not recognize from their list of de- scriptions a call commonly heard in North America. This could be due to the difficulty in translating the call or it could indicate that some calls may not occur in all races. Sonograms, such as those that appear in the paper on Barn Owl vocalization by Buhler and Epple (1980. J. Omith. 121: 36), would have been helpful here. Chapter 3 deals with several behaviorisms and is based almost entirely on the authors' interesting an- ecdotal information. Here they attempt to convey the "personality" of the species. Roosting, reaction to danger, territoriality, time and methods of hunting, hunting efficiency, killing and eating of prey, reac- tion to other species, and maintenance behavior are the major topics considered. Reproductive behavior has a later chapter of its own. We are told of the relative inactivity of Barn Owls- those that were observed in winter spent most of the night perched motionless with occasional bouts of preening and stretching and forays after food. How- ever, no quantitative data (time budgets) are given to allow us to judge activity levels for ourselves. The authors over-generalize by stating that predators spend little time in finding food. Certainly, there is a broad range of variation even within one species under different conditions and prey densities. The topic of territoriality in Barn Owls has not been resolved by previous workers. Indications from many areas of its distribution hint that the species is not strongly territorial or at least that territories are not occupied and defended in the way they are for many other raptors. Unfortunately, the observations in this book do little to elucidate this topic. A short section tells of territory defense but, overall, evidence was not convincing that territories are defended on a con- sistent and sustained basis. For example, in Fig. 4 (p. 62) "territories" of several owls are plotted that, in some cases, have considerable overlap. Incidental- ly, the Barn Owls whose territories are shown are called "forest" owls. I found this misleading because the owls hunted pastures and areas of very small, newly planted trees and did not use areas with large, dense trees. Thus, even though I suspect that the term "forest" owls was used only to identify the pop- ulation, the implications are inaccurate. Evidence is given for owls remaining on the same territories or leaving and reappearing at certain times of the year. Yet, nowhere in the book did I find an</page><page sequence="2">April 19831 Reviews 533 indication that the owls studied were marked for in- dividual identification. Instead, coloration, behav- ior, and/or size characteristics of the owls were used. Although this technique has some validity, much greater confidence would be possible with individ- ually color-marked birds. Barn Owls are known to be almost strictly noctur- nal throughout their range. The authors mention this but use most of their space under "Time of hunting" to discuss diurnal hunting. Again, I found their use of a term misleading; inspection of the data in Table 1 indicates that much of this activity would be more correctly labeled crepuscular. Furthermore, we are not given information on cloud cover, which would affect light levels and might mask the time of sunset. Several theories are presented to explain why these owls were active in daylight. Apparently no infor- mation was available to the authors on prey densi- ties, but the possibility that scarce prey might have increased the daily foraging time was not considered as an alternative. Their access to a population of Barn Owls which hunted in daylight did give the authors an unusually good opportunity to observe hunting methods. The technique most frequently observed was long, slow flights over open areas. Less often, owls were seen to use perches as vantage points within prey habitat. Occasionally, the owls flushed roosting birds from bushes by beating against the bushes with their wings. Efficiency of hunting was noted chiefly by recording the number of prey brought to young in nests; most of the owls they observed were very ef- ficient. For example, one male, feeding young, cap- tured nine prey in 55 min. Food is the subject of Chapter 4. Factors affecting pellet formation are covered first but no mention is given of the extensive studies by Duke and his stu- dents on this process (for example, 1976. Comp. Bio- chem. Physiol. 53A: 1; 1976. Am. J. Physiol. 231: 1824; 1977. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 56A: 283.). A representative selection of studies from throughout the world is cited to support the conclusion that Barn Owls have no prey preferences as such; they prey on any animal small enough to be caught in open areas. The authors do emphasize the dietary dominance of microtine rodents wherever they occur with Barn Owls. They cite other papers to show the opportun- ism of Bam Owl hunting and the paucity of inver- tebrate prey in diets. Several pages are devoted to a good coverage of experiments and factors affecting food consumption. Bunn et al. state that T. a. alba consumes 100-150 g daily. This is based on tenuous data, but it leads to the conclusion that T. a. alba consumes about the same amount of food per day that has been estimated for T. a. pratincola, a race averaging almost twice as heavy. It seems that more work is needed in this area. This chapter ends with a statement on the useful- ness of the feeding of Barn Owls. Thankfully, they avoid the womout "good guy/bad guy" labels once applied to birds of prey. While stating that some of the prey species eaten by Barn Owls are serious pests to humans, they also note that predator-prey rela- tionships are two-way. Each side exerts selective pressure on the other, and Barn Owl populations are probably regulated by the available prey more than prey populations are by the owls. Reproduction has Chapter 5 to itself, apparently because this is the authors' area of greatest interest. They emphasize the difficulties in studying a noc- turnal species, but it is evident that their persistence has paid off. A summary of the flexibility of time of breeding by Barn Owls begins the chapter (although the information is from only three subspecies). The fact that fully 14 weeks is required from egg laying to independence of the young is an important factor. Courtship behavior is described in the following 61/2 pages; for the most part, the descriptions are instruc- tive. It was not clear to me, though, how they dis- tinguished between territorial chases and vocaliza- tions versus courtship chases and calls. I thought that a full page on wing-clapping was excessive, espe- cially because they considered it to be a minor court- ship behavior. Another area of flexibility by breeding Barn Owls is in choosing nest sites. A comprehensive review of nest types used in Britain is given, but only a few notes are induded on subspecies from two other parts of the world. Little is made of the variability of clutch size, al- though Table 14 shows a range from 2 to 9 eggs/clutch in Britain. The only possible reasons listed for this variation are age of the female and latitude; both are dismissed. Brood size and fledging success are also given little coverage. Data from Britain are used to show that larger dutches seldom fledge all the young. No reasons are proposed, however, for the failure of some eggs in a clutch to hatch. Prey supply is linked to fledging success but this argument is not devel- oped extensively. On the other hand, 171/2 pages are devoted to the owlets' development and behavior from hatching to independence. This extensive sec- tion reflects the authors' long, careful observations made at nests. One surprising behavior found on two occasions was that of older young feeding their siblings. This corroborates Epple's (1979. J. Ornith. 120: 226) ob- servations (although his paper was not cited). I question their interpretation of one behavior pat- tern in the young-that of scratching at the nest lin- ing. Bunn et al. decided that this may serve as prac- tice for later nest site preparation as adults. I believe it more likely that it serves as nest sanitation. I have seen it and evidence of it at many sites both in cliff crevices and nest boxes. The young face away from the opening and scratch vigorously. Much debris is removed in this way. Another difference that I noted was in the behav- ior of adults toward young that fall out of the nest.</page><page sequence="3">534 Reviews [Auk, Vol. 100 Bunn et al. state that these young are ignored by the adults and starve, but I have seen several examples of fallen young being fed by their parents. These differences could easily be related to the particular nest situation or to individual differences in adults. Convincing evidence of siblings being killed and eaten in some broods that the authors had under study is given in a discussion of cannibalism. How- ever, they indicated that relationships among sib- lings are generally peaceful. Food shortage is the fac- tor implicated in cannibalism, but the authors are careful to suggest several alternatives that also may explain the disappearance of young from nests. Barn Owls differ from most raptors in that multiple broods are not uncommon. The authors propose that the male's response-whether or not he provides enough food for the female-is the key to a second brood being produced. Movements are the topic of Chapter 6. Data from banded owls in Britain and the Netherlands are used to document post-fledging dispersal. Movements in all compass directions were found, but major topo- graphic features tended to channel most birds in cer- tain directions. In some years more and longer movements were possibly caused by decreasing prey supplies. Owls banded as adults tended to move very little from the point of banding and no definite mi- gratory movements were found in European Barn Owls. Several widely divergent factors that may control Barn Owl populations are discussed in Chapter 7: enemies (predators, competitors, and parasites), pesticides, loss of habitat, shooting, and collisions. First, though, they discuss the high mortality of newly independent young, especially in their first winter. While noting that the lower fat reserves of Barn Owls make them more vulnerable to adverse winter con- ditions, they say that extreme cold in itself does not appear to cause mortality. That conclusion may be altered by the finding by Johnson (1974. The bio- energetics of the Barn Owl, Tyto alba. Unpublished M.S. thesis, Calif. State Univ., Long Beach) that Barn Owls have less efficient insulation than some other owls. Winter mortality of Barn Owls has sometimes been significant in northern Europe, and literature on this is reviewed in detail in this section. A different form of weather-induced mortality is documented here, too. One breeding season in Britain, which be- gan as the most successful on record, completely turned around when an extended drought in late summer greatly reduced rodent numbers and caused high mortality in Barn Owls. Predation upon Barn Owls in Britain is covered, although it is not thought to be particularly impor- tant. Competition is not addressed except that from Tawny Owls (Strix aluco) for nest sites. The extensive recent literature on resource and interference com- petition is not referenced. Sections on shooting and pesticides are not very informative, and no real con- clusions can be drawn about the effects of these on Barn Owl populations. It is interesting (and perhaps disheartening) to see that many of the same people-problems exist in Brit- ain that occur in the United States: vandalism, lack of enforcement and punishment for wildlife offenses, and death of owls through collisions with automo- biles. Habitat and nest site losses are also probably major reasons for declines in Barn Owl numbers in both areas. Three means of protecting and conserving Barn Owls in Britain are presented next. The first is legal protection, which was thought by the authors to be largely ineffectual. Second was the use of nest boxes to supplement scarce nest sites. This technique has been tried in various parts of Britain and was given generally favorable review. Successful uses of nest boxes for Barn Owls in other countries were not doc- umented (Berndt and Frantzen 1971. Die Voglewelt 92: 112; Marti et al. 1979. Wildl. Soc. Bull. 7: 145.). The last technique presented was captive breeding and release of young owls to increase or re-establish breeding populations. They felt that this was also successful, based on reappearance of nesting pairs in an area in which young were released. Presum- ably, these new breeders were some of the birds re- leased, although evidence was not given to docu- ment this. The chapter closes with a 1-page review of Barn Owl mortality outside Britain. Chapter 8 consists of a detailed (34 pages) account of Barn Owl distribution and status in the British Isles. The authors believe that human agricultural changes in the country over the last 2,000 yr created more Barn Owl habitat than when heavy forests were widespread. Declines in the last 100 yr, however, may be due to a variety of the newer human changes covered in Chapter 7. This chapter will probably be of greatest interest to British residents, as it contains little of relevance to other geographic areas. The final chapter covers folklore associated with Barn Owls. Despite the quantity of interesting in- formation, I felt that this material was out of place in an otherwise scientific volume. The first of the three appendices contains a list of scientific names used in the text. The second is a day- by-day account of the growth and development of Barn Owls from day 1 to 105. It is largely nonquan- titative, however. The final appendix contains sug- gestions for observing wild Barn Owls. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, largely be- cause of the depth of experience that the authors have with this bird. The writing style is lively and punc- tuated with interesting observations. There are, however, some lapses into anthropomorphism. I no- ticed only one typographical and one grammatical error (i.e. data is, p. 73). The lack of quantification in several places was disturbing. For example, the reader is not told how many nests were observed,</page><page sequence="4">April 1983] Reviews 535 how many hours were spent observing, and how many individuals were observed for many of the be- havioral interpretations. I dislike the term "predat- ing" to describe a predator killing its prey. Would not "depredating" or "preyed upon" be better? I also dislike the terms "hen" and "cock" instead of female and male. There was some inconsistency in citing references. Most were done in standard scientific style but there were lapses. For example, The Atlas of Breeding Birds in Britain and Ireland is cited in text but not listed in the bibliography. I would recommend this book for all college and university libraries and for the personal collections of all who are interested in raptors. While not the last word on the Barn Owl, it is a stimulating book. CARL D. MARTI.</page></plain_text>
