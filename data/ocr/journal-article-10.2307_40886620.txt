<plain_text><page sequence="1">FINDING ONESELF IN GREEK PHILOSOPHY* by A.A. LONG (Berkeley, Calif. ) How do we find ourselves in Greek philosophy ? In asking this question I want to explore two things which overlap. The first is our relation to philosophers of the distant past and what this implies about our studying them now. The second point is what our studying them now can tell us about ourselves. One could ask a similar question about finding oneself in Greek history or Greek literature, or for that matter in anything at all that someone else has written. Our relation to a text always involves two con- tents, what is inscribed there and all that we bring to the text as readers and interpreters. However, the way we find ourselves in Greek philosophy is distinctive for several reasons. The Greeks were, of course, pioneers in shap- ing categories of thought that we westerners have inherited, and in some * This article is the lightly revised version of a lecture I delivered when I was privileged to hold the Cardinal Mercier Chair of Philosophy at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven during March 1991. It is a pleasure to have this opportunity of thanking my philosopher hosts for the stimulus they gave me and their generous hospitality. The main thesis of the lecture originated in a graduate seminar on the Presocratics that I taught at the University of California at Berkeley in the fall of 1990. 1 thank my students for their comments, and I am especially grateful to Miriam Pelikan, to whose paper on Heraclitus I returned in thinking about the lecture. I am also grateful to Monique Elias, whose com- ments helped me to get a clearer idea of what I wanted to say about objectivity and subjectivity, and to John Ferrari, who made a number of most helpful suggestions which I have incorporated in my final draft. The Classics Department at the University of Leiden provided me with a splendid place in which to prepare the text. For the leisure to do so I am indebted to fellowships from the United States National Endowment for the Humanities, and the University of California at Berkeley.</page><page sequence="2">256 A.A. LONG cases discarded. That is familiar enough. But what will mainly concern me in this lecture is a way of looking at the origins of Greek philosophy through a conception of the human self that their inquiries into nature brought to light. In beginning western philosophy, the Greeks, I shall argue, activated an entire aspect of the self which had been mainly latent before : they dis- covered a larger dimension of being human. What I mean by this is something that we share with even the earliest Greek philosophers, but which they did not share with their predecessors and most of their contemporaries - the viewpoint or mental faculty that we conventionally call scientific objectivity. For a plethora of reasons, some of them good and some bad, objectivity has become a contentious notion in certain circles today. In using the term here, I want to sidestep questions about cultural relativism, paradigm shifts, privileged description, or the possibility of access to truths that might hold good independently of our own conceptual scheme - in other words, the vast issue of objective truth and its grounds. Objectivity, in my use of the term, is to be construed as a func- tion of human psychology, and more particularly, as a concomitant of im- agination, intellectual curiosity and experimental aptitude. 1 1 shall use it as a way of referring to what I do believe to be a fact about human beings - that we have a capacity and inclination, if our material circumstances and education favour their development, to try to understand our milieu on the basis of articulated reasons that are not reducible to what is customarily thought or to what we like to believe on the basis of our idiosyncracies or such things as gender, family, social class, and political or religious affiliation. 1 . Thus my use of the term is to be contrasted with two problematic uses of it that are distin- guished by Richard RORTY : ' ' Objective ' ' to mean both ' ' characterizing the view which would be agreed upon as a result of argument undeflected by irrelevant considerations ' ' and ' ' representing things as they really are' ', Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature ( Princeton, 1980), 333-34. The first of Rorty's senses is an obvious mirage. If it is applied to the history of philosophy and science, most of the best argued views will turn out to have been non-objective. Yet it would be an act of supreme arrogance for us to label them so on the grounds that, from our later perspective, they are deflected by irrelevant considerations. Rorty's second sense of objectivity is still more troublesome since there seems to be no way in which ' ' things could be represented as they really are ' ' that does not import the inquirer's viewpoint into the representation. That, of course, is quite compatible with the fact that any conscientious inquirer will try to represent ' ' things as they really are ' ' from the perspective of his evidence, methodology, assumptions etc.</page><page sequence="3">FINDING ONESELF IN GREEK PHILOSOPHY 257 Even with these qualifications, which of course I have stated baldly, it is easy to overlook three remarkable facts about objectivity. First, although we find it convenient to call the world that scientists study objective, the world as such, the world in its own right so to speak, is not the sort ofthing that could 'be objective if objectivity characterizes viewpoints, theories or faculties of mind. It is scientists who confer objectivity on the world in as much as they try to study it from an impersonal or detached or disinterested or theoretical perspective. The second remarkable fact about objectivity is its being an impersonal or detached outlook by a person, or at least, a set of persons. Only persons, i.e. human individuals, can think objectively, and prima facie there is something distinctly odd about a person's being able to do anything impersonally. The greatest Greek philosophers grasped this latter point. Plato, in a memorable phrase, described philosophy as * ' practising death ' ' (Phaedo 64a) and death is the ultimate detachment from the embodied self. Aristotle, rejecting the proverb about the need to think human thoughts, recommended ' ' immortalizing oneself as far as possible " in a reference to the life of the theoretical intellect (EN 10.7, 1177b 30-34). Plotinus went even further, in his conception that human beings have an immortal intel- lect that never descends into the phenomenal world. All three of these phil- osophers were committed to the notion that frying to perceive things ' ' as they really are ' ' is an essential part of what it is to be properly human ; they take it that this kind of activity is a feature of the self, but not of the ordi- nary self. It is you and I in an extraordinary mode of our being. However, it is a third remarkable fact about objectivity that will chiefly concern me in this lecture. Unlike Plato and his successors, the earliest Greek philosophers had to discover that they had this faculty ; so we should see their inquiries into nature as being inward as well as outward looking. Their objectivist approaches to the world cannot be treated as merely a cultural ar- tifact or a conventional outlook since they were not living in a society which recognized the possibility and existence of scientific objectivity in the ways that I have just characterized it. In studying Heraclitus and Parmenides we may be witnessing the first full-scale emergence of this faculty in recorded history. That helps to explain the boldness and confidence of their specu-</page><page sequence="4">258 A.A. LONG lations - their attempts to conceptualise the world in ways that subvert everyday beliefs and appearances. If space permitted, I would have liked to explore Parmenides' radical experiments in tracing a path for thought which leaves him and his listeners or readers nowhere to be as the individuals that they are. Instead, I will focus upon Heraclitus. I shall argue that he not only has a notion of objectivity in the sense I have just explained, but also one that looks strangely modern if we connect it with ideas developed by Thomas Nagel in his recent book, The View from Nowhere. * * Before getting to details I should say something about how I conceive of the history of philosophy, and the place of the Greeks within it. Is it poss- ible, let alone profitable, for us to connect any of our contemporary concerns with philosophers who are so distant from us in time and culture ? I think it is not only possible but unavoidable, at least if we want to learn some- thing about ourselves from the Greeks, and provided that we conduct our dialogue with them in appropriate ways. The dialogue that Greek philos- ophy invites is one of the main reasons why the subject is so alive today. Oddly enough, Michael Frede, who has contributed greatly to the modern vitality of Greek philosophy, seems to miss this point. In the first chapter of his book Essays in Ancient Philosophy (Minneapolis, 1987) Frede ex- plains what in his opinion a historian of philosophy should be trying to do. Frede distances himself from a Hegelian notion of philosophy's optimistic and progressive relation to its childlike beginnings. As he rightly says, ' ' The history of philosophy is as much a history of failure where success was poss- ible as of achievement where failure was possible ' ' (xxiv). What Frede does not comment on is the dynamic and interrogative relation which we mod- erns have to earlier philosophers when we attempt to think their thoughts. The history of philosophy is not something static. It changes because we change. We try, of course, to avoid anachronism in our interpretations, but what we take an earlier philosopher to be saying depends not only on his</page><page sequence="5">FINDING ONESELF IN GREEK PHILOSOPHY 259 context but on our own. By our context I mean our own intellectual tradi- tion and interests. We cannot discount these or even, if we are honest, be fully aware of them, but we can try to use them conscientiously and cre- atively as a further guide to interpretation. How a philosopher was judged by his contemporaries or immediate successors may not be a good guide to his significance over a longer period of history or for ourselves. Our en- counter with Aristotle's reflections in his book De anima is bound to be dif- ferent from that of Aquinas. Knowing how the mind / body problem has been discussed since Descartes, we can evaluate the strengths or weak- nesses of Aristotle's psychology from a perspective in which we see him as innocent of Cartesian theory. For us, though not for Aquinas, Aristotle's in- nocence in this respect has become an important part of his philosophical position, especially if we think that Cartesian dualism is a mistake. Aristotle is a significant figure in the contemporary philosophy of mind precisely be- cause he offers a challenging alternative to views that were advanced after his own time. The fact that Greek philosophical texts are constantly open to this kind of réévaluation does not guarantee their modern value, but the two points often go together. Current ethics and metaphysics are being enriched by the attention such philosophers as Alasdair Maclntyre, Bernard Williams and David Wiggins have paid to Aristotle. 2 In certain issues (not, of course, in the specific details of his cosmology and biology) Aristotle's philosophy re- mains a permanent possibility for our thought. What is at stake here has been well stated by Heidegger in relation to Parmenides : * ' The dialogue with Parmenides never comes to an end, not only because so much in the preserved fragments of his ' didactic Poem' still remains obscure, but also because what is said there continually deserves more thought " . 3 In return- ing to the Greeks as we do, we should not subscribe to the myth of an orig- 2.

That posture, which Heidegger sometimes seems to adopt, is as unpromising as Hegel's faith in steady philosophical progress. The point is not to place the Greeks in the cradle or on pedestals, but to allow them to stimulate us, especially in cases where we have reason to think that contem- porary thought has lost its way. I now come back to my starting-point, the objectivist conception of the self that early Greek philosophy brought to consciousness. The argument that I want to develop will emerge most clearly if I begin with some gen- eral points about subjectivity and objectivity, and their problematic status in philosophy since Descartes. Self is a name for what we are in our individual identities, as distinct per- sons, minds or states of awareness. We mark this point in language by using proper names, pronouns and possessive adjectives. We say * * I think ' ' , ' 'She feels " , ' ' His thought " , " Your problem ' ' . Such expressions are personal in the sense that they indicate a human being from that person's perspec- tive. The facts that they denote are subjective because only / can do my thinking ; only she can have her feeling. However, the fact that I can think is not subjective, but objective because it is grounded not in my being me but in my being human. Furthermore, while my thinking is peculiar to me, what I think can be objective and something you share, as when I say there are people in this room. That statement does not express my personal perspective. It identifies an objective or public fact. These are elementary points, as I have formulated them, and do not seem to generate a problem. Suppose, however, that Descartes1 evil demon tempts me to think that everything I normally take to exist is an illusion. Suppose, further, that I respond to this challenge by advancing my own consciousness as the one thing I cannot doubt. I refute hyperbolic scepticism by insisting on my own subjective reality. But what do I do next ? How does</page><page sequence="7">FINDING ONESELF IN GREEK PHILOSOPHY 261 my certainty of my own existence provide me with a firm foundation for viewing anything outside myself? It seems that my grip on the world has to start with my own individual consciousness. Subjective me must be the perspective from which I view everything else. We owe to Descartes' evil demon a host of problems that did not be- devil Greek philosophers, e.g. , solipsism, how we can know other minds, and what our personal identity really consists in. 4 In spite of crushing attacks from Wittgenstein and Ryle, the ghost of Descartes' ghost in the machine still haunts us. Although we don't doubt the existence of the physical world that scientists study, we continue to regard it as an external 'part of reality that is quite distinct from the internal reality of mind or consciousness. In our prevailing model of the mind, consciousness is generally thought of as something essentially individual if not private. Even if you and I think the same thought, we conventionally take it that two consciousnesses are at work. There is a problem, then, in understanding the relation between subjec- tivity and objectivity. The problem is to explain how an individual self can see the world from a perspective which is genuinely his own but not just that of himself. Can we be both subjective and objective selves ? In his challenging book The View from Nowhere (Oxford, 1986) the American philosopher Thomas Nagel argues that this is precisely what we are. Nagel proposes the existence of what he calls ' * the objective self' ' as the fact about each of us as individuals that enables us to transcend our purely 4. A realist assumption permeates all Greek philosophy, thus distinguishing it decisively from the idealism, initiated by Descartes, that has been so influential in modern philosophy. The point has been excellently explored by M. BURNYEAT, 'Idealism and Greek Philosophy : what Descartes saw and Berkeley missed', Philosophical Review 91 ( 1982 ), 3-40. Burnyeat notes as peculiarly Cartesian, Descartes' doubts about his having a body, his proposal that any experience might be the illusion of a dream, his making subjective truth indubitable, and finally his questioning the prevailing Greek assumption that something exists independently of our own mental states. When Greek philos- ophers talk about 'the external world' , they do not include a person's body as part of the content of that world, and so they do not have a concept of the external world in the sense that that expression has commonly acquired since Descartes. Cf. also J. MacDowell, 'Singular Thought and Inner Space', in P. Pettit andj. MACDOWELL, edd. Subject, Thought and Context (Oxford, 1986), 137-68, and S. EVERSON, 'The objective appearance of Pyrrhonism', in S. EVERSON ed., Companions to Ancient Thought: 2 Psychology (Cambridge, 1991 ), 121-47.</page><page sequence="8">262 A.A. LONG personal or socially conditioned viewpoints. What links us to the physical world of science, he suggests, is our being or having an objective self in ad- dition to our ordinary human individuality. Nagel offers his conception of the objective self as a way of responding to the Cartesian problem and bridg- ing the gap between physical (external) and mental (internal). The ob- jective self is still me, but it is me seeing the world from a perspective in which I try to discount the fact that it is I Anthony Long who am doing this seeing. The objective self is my thinking of the world as something that con- tains me and my consciousness along with everything else. It is my capacity to achieve a viewpoint in which my ordinary human individuality ceases to be the perspective from which I look at the world. This ' * higher self ' , as Nagel sometimes calls it, is presupposed by a great many of our attitudes and institutions, but its extreme manifestation is scientific inquiry. Since the objective self is a feature of every person, it can form the basis for a univer- salist or inter-subjective understanding. Nagel does not suggest, of course, that objectivity can ever be complete. We cannot get completely outside of our individual selves any more than we can imagine ourselves not existing. Such objectivity as we may achieve is an approximation to a view from no- where, i.e. a view from somewhere less individual (op. cit. , 67 ). As a fact about the self and the selfs relation to the world, it explains why we are able to get behind the ordinary appearance of things to a non-apparent concep- tion of them. Nagel's " objective self ", though modern in formulation, is hardly novel in essence. It is beautifully characterized in these words of Pascal : ' ' Car en- fin qu'est-ce que l'homme dans la nature ? Un néant à l'égard de l'infini, un tout à Tégard du néant, un milieu entre rien et tout " ; or, as Pascal also wrote: "Par l'espace, l'univers me comprend et m'engloutit comme un point ; par la pensée, je le comprends ' ' (Pensées 264-5 ). Pascal's pensée im- plies Nagel' s objective self. Another name for it, to indicate its being some- thing in which we all share, could be rationality. However, the issue that in- terests me is not Nagel's own position in detail but the fact that he finds it necessary, in the contemporary state of philosophy, to argue for this kind of link between our individual selves and the world. What I now want to do is to show how and why something analogous to Nagel's ' ' objective self '</page><page sequence="9">FINDING ONESELF IN GREEK PHILOSOPHY 263 came to consciousness at the beginning of Greek philosophy. The focus of my interest is the great difference in background between Nagel' s post- Cartesian or scientific starting-point and that of the Greeks. What can we learn about our modern conception of the self by studying the origins of Greek philosophy ? The chief points to remember, as we move to the Greeks, are first, Nagel's desire to justify objectivity - the non- individualistic viewpoint - and secondly, his proposal that it need not threaten or be threatened by my subjective identity because the objective self is actually part of what it is to be me. People had selves, though philosophers can make it hard for us to realize this, before philosophy. From what we know about early Greek literature, pre-philosophical selves were not Cartesian. By saying this I mean that they did not regard their moment-by-moment consciousness as the principal mark of their identity. What they took themselves to be, in first-person re- flection, was determined by publicly observable facts (as is also the case, I think, with us moderns when we are not engaged in academic philosophy, psychoanalysis, or neurotic internal dialogue). Achilles regards himself as the principal Achaean warrior because that is how he is, as others tell him. What can trouble Homeric characters is not doubt about where they stand in the world, but living up to the world's expectation of them. Their out- look on the world is objective in the sense that there is general agreement about the conditions of human society and the gods' ultimate control of things. The contrast between divine immortality and human mortality pro- vides an objective viewpoint for understanding where people fit into the world. But Homeric characters do not have an objective self in Nagel's sense. They - and we may guess, their real-life equivalents - have no interest in asking what the world might be like from a perspective other than that in which they presently see it or can readily imagine it. Nagel's objective self</page><page sequence="10">264 A.A. LONG came into being when the first Greek philosophers had the audacity to con- jecture that the traditional gods could not explain how the world began or why it has its present features. Thoroughly human in everything except their power and immortality, the Olympian gods provided a basically human perspective for explaining natural phenomena and all the general cir- cumstances of life. Thunder and earthquake were expressions of the gods' passions. This pre-philosophical world was conceptualised in entirely per- sonal terms. The Milesian philosophers of the sixth century B.C. took the first step to- wards Nagel's objective self. In place of anthropomorphic gods they intro- duced the notion of a material stuff, for instance water or air, which could account for both the origin of the world and its present structure. Thus the Milesian Anaximenes proposed that everything is explicable by anfjp, conven- tionally translated by ' ' air ' ' , which can change its density and so appear as something solid such as rock or as something rarefied such as fire. Anaximenes appears to be advancing a physical explanation of the world, but what he means by arjp is something much less specific than what we call the atmosphere. In addition, he takes it to be alive and also divine. 5 Anaximenes' ascription of divinity and life to air was a momentous step, far more extraordinary than modern scholars have generally recognized. It is easy to see it as a relic of mythology, but even if that is right, Anaximen- es' position raises epistemological prospects and problems which were ab- sent from the tradition that he was implicitly, if not explicitly, rejecting. The minds of the traditional gods were inscrutable to mortals, but mortals be- lieved that they and the gods were largely alike in their manner of thought and of feeling. One could at least imagine, as Homer so brilliantly does, thinking the thoughts of an Olympian god. If, on the other hand, we take air with its visible effects and transformations to be alive and divine, our re- lation to the world is radically changed, and especially so if we take the fur- ther step with Anaximenes of treating air as * * the cosmic equivalent of the life-soul in man". 6 Anaximenes' air brings us both closer to the divine 5.

Schofield, The Presocratic Philosophers ' Cambridge, 1983), 161.</page><page sequence="11">FINDING ONESELF IN GREEK PHILOSOPHY 265 and more distant from it - closer because his air makes the world intellig- ible in ways that the Olympian gods do not do, more distant because an air god's life must be something very different from our ordinary modes of thought. What connects Anaximenes to his air god is not a personal trans- action but the relationship between himself as thinker and a cosmic prin- ciple that functions like our life-soul although it is not centered in ordinary human consciousness. Speculation about the world has brought with it a new dimension of the self. There is no evidence that Anaximenes reflected deeply on the psychologi- cal implications of his comparison between cosmic air and the human soul or vital principle. However, within his lifetime or a little later, philosophers began a direct confrontation with the issues that his kind of speculation raises - issues not simply about what the world is like but what we must be like if the world is to be intelligible and related to us in the kind of way Anaximenes proposed. Following Aristotle's lead in his surveys of his pre- decessors, we have tended to think of early Greek philosophy as largely outward-looking, an effort to understand external nature with only super- ficial attention being paid to psychology and theory of knowledge. I want to suggest instead that Anaximenes' immediate successors recognized that the inquiry into nature has to include a new understanding of the self and its cognitive powers. 7 As I have already remarked, early Greek philosophy is implicitly an at- tack on traditional religion, and with Xenophanes this becomes explicit. He used a brilliant argument to undermine the conventional gods : all peoples, he said, make their gods look and behave like themselves - for instance, the gods of the Ethiopians are snub-nosed and black, while those of the Thracians are blue-eye.d and red-haired. If cows and horses had gods, he ob- served, they would make them bovine and equine (frr. 14-16 Diels-Kranz). Xenophanes drew the conclusion that god must be wholly different from human beings in form and in thought (fr. 23 ). His argument is the earliest 7. This point is well taken by Stephen Toulmin, Human Understanding (Princeton, 1972 ), 4 : 1 ' The rationalist cosmologies of sixth-century Ionia . . . carried double meanings : they were concerned not just with Nature - but with Intelligible Nature - not just with a World that Man might or might not understand, but with this World as an object of Man's understanding".</page><page sequence="12">266 A.A. LONG we possess that draws attention to relativity of viewpoint, and the difficulty this creates for scientific knowledge. Xenophanes proposed that god is a unity and a unity that perceives and thinks "as a whole " (frr. 23-4). However, he also wrote as follows : ' ' No man has a clear view, nor will there ever be anyone who has knowledge about the gods and everything which I speak. For even if he should fully succeed in speaking what is actual, he himself does not know it. Appearance is laid over everything" (fr. 34). Anaximenes' physical theory, premised upon the existence of an air god, implied a new perspective from which to view the world. Xenophanes re- jects that possibility. He acknowledges the existence of a controlling divin- ity, but he puts that god, and thus any scientific knowledge of the world, outside human access. Xenophanes can surmise that there is more to the world than the standard viewpoint of his culture. In fact he is the first philosopher to draw distinctions between reality and appearance, and be- tween truth and conjecture. The way he draws them, however, is critical rather than constructive. As the later history of philosophy has shown, attempts to achieve scien- tific knowledge regularly invite sceptical rejoinders. Xenophanes was not a full-fledged sceptic since he shares Anaximenes' impulse to get beyond a human-centered perspective ; but he doubts our capacity to do so. Our view- point cannot be that of god, who perceives and thinks as a whole. I come now to the astonishing figure of Heraclitus - the principal hero of this lecture. He has been much studied over the past hundred and fifty years, and my reflections on him are unavoidably indebted to that scholar- ship. Indeed, the difficulties of interpreting Heraclitus may appear so for- midable that I risk being accused of rashness or carelessness in advancing thoughts about him without cloaking them in the protective garb of scholar- ly disclaimers. If I venture to do so here, it is not out of disrespect for that learned tradition, nor, as I want to insist still more strongly, because I lay</page><page sequence="13">FINDING ONESELF IN GREEK PHILOSOPHY 267 claim to an authoritative insight into Heraclitus' dark sayings. The nakedness with which I shall approach him in this lecture has a philosophical point. Heraclitus is a type of philosopher - Plato, Nietzsche and Wittgenstein are other examples - whose demand on the interpreter is so exigent that nothing of substance can be thought via his sayings unless we finally converse with them as individual searchers, trying as best we can to perceive the world through the clues that they suggest. Not all philosophers are like that. Aristotle's philosophy - to take one obviously different style of thought - is greatly illuminated by the scholarly tradition that it has prompted. We do not need, as it were, to internalise all of Aris- totle's concepts in order to engage with his patterns of thought. But in the case of Heraclitus, as it seems to me, any worthwhile insight we may achieve is riskier or more tenuous because there are no secure guidelines external to the conversation we engage in on our own individual responsibility. This does not mean that we cannot learn from one another's readings. What it does imply is that the final step in learning anything from Heraclitus or Plato is self-exploration, or a process of discovering what ideas their reflec- tions bring to birth in our own attempts to think. 8 Following that injunction, I want to suggest that Heraclitus discovered something close to Nagel's objective self or what Nagel also calls " a self- transcendent conception". Such a conception, Nagel writes (p. 74), should ideally explain four things : 1 . what the world is like ; 2 . what we are like ; 3 . why the world appears to beings like us in certain respects as it is and in certain respects as it isn't ; and 4. how beings like us can arrive at such a conception ' ' . The point of my remarks will not be to tell Nagel that he is a latter-day Heraclitean. What I seek to propose, rather, is that Heraclitus had a similar intuition about what the world and we must be like, in general terms, if we are really capable of seeing it as it is andas it isn 't. Let me recall Xenophanes' dilemma. He intuited the existence of a divine being that transcended ordinary experience, but he saw no way for 8. Cf. M. BURNYEAT, 'Message from Heraclitus', New York Review of Books (3 May, 1982): "After explanation and elucidation have done their best, there is nothing for it but to let these memorable sayings take effect in the psyche in their own way ' ' .</page><page sequence="14">268 A.A. LONG humans to apprehend it. Heraclitus too recognized that there is more to the world than uncritical perception and belief can deliver. However, he attacked Xenophanes, along with Pythagoras and others, for doing research which failed to gain him understanding (fr. 40 Diels-Kranz). Instead of allocating the non-apparent features of the world to an unfathomable god, Heraclitus drew an extraordinary inference. He proposed that appearances are actually only the surface of a deep structure which they partly reveal and partly conceal. 9 He calls attention to this deep structure in a series of memorable sayings, for instance : "The way up and down is one and the same" (fr. 60); "God: day night, winter summer, war peace, satiety hunger" (fr. 67); "Mortal immortals, immortal mortals; living the others'death; dying the others' life" (fr. 62). These sayings express the unity of opposites, but they do so in deliberately cryptic ways. * * Nature ' ' , Heraclitus says, ' ' loves to conceal itself ' (fr. 123 ). By writing in a riddling manner, he wants to signal the gap between appearance and deep structure. The interpretation that his words demand is his sign of philosophy's task - a reading of nature's hidden meaning. If Heraclitus had supposed that appearances are simply at odds with real- ity, his notion of a deep structure would be arbitrary, lacking in any demonstrable rationale. But he does not deny that the world really presents itself to observers in the ways that we denote by terms like day and night, or up and down. Nor, I think, does he wish to suggest that the underlying unity of such opposites is a higher metaphysical truth such that an objective account of the world would be complete if it denounced all conflicting ap- pearances as illusory without qualification. Heraclitus acknowledges that sea is most pure (for fish) and most foul (for humans ; fr. 61 ). The objectiv- ity I ascribe to him partly consists in his juxtaposing surface and hidden meanings, human and god's-eye viewpoints. What he takes to be decisively mistaken is the viewpoint from which day is seen as simply separate from night, up from down, living from dying. 10 A deep structure is needed 9. Cf. fr. 54, ápfxovCri àçavfjç çavepfjç xpeírccov. For an excellent exploration of the sentence, cf. Charles KAHN, The Art and Thought of Heraclitus ( Cambridge, 1979 ), who says of it, 203 : The phrase 'hidden structure' ... might ... be taken as a general title for Heraclitus' philosophical thought ' ' . 10. Cf. fr. 57, where Heraclitus criticizes Hesiod for failing to recognize the unity of day and night.</page><page sequence="15">FINDING ONESELF IN GREEK PHILOSOPHY 269 because reflection shows that there can be no day without night, no up without down, no life without death. These apparent opposites imply con- ceptual unities - the flow of time, the extension of space, the biological cycle. Heraclitus 'deep structure is a way of making sense of the world when we detach appearances from their ordinary perceptual conditions. The unity of opposites invites us to look at wholes rather than at parts. ' ' The same . . . living and dead ; and the waking and the sleeping ; and young and old. For these transposed are those, and those transposed are these " (fr. 88). Here, quite clearly as it seems to me, is a view from nowhere. It is as if Heraclitus is trying to step outside time with the object of interpreting suc- cessive transitions from A to B or B to A as co-present contributors to anything 's identity. n Remove any relativity of viewpoint, and you are both young and old. Every moment you are living you are dying, and every moment you are dying you are living. Remove all temporal distinctions, and you get the identity of living and dead. Jonathan Barnes interprets the identity of such opposites as a fallacious inference by Heraclitus, caused by his dropping the temporal qualifiers from the innocuous proposition, "X phis at T1 and X does not phi at T2 ' ' , and so concluding to ' ' X phis and does not phi without qualification ' ' 12 To me that diagnosis of this ubiquitous element in Heraclitus 'thought seems misguided - not because he was incapable, given his early date, of fallacious reasoning, but because it overlooks his amply attested interest in looking at the world from a decentered perspective. Heraclitus knew perfectly well that, from the or- dinary perspective, living and dead are mutually exclusive conditions. I take him to be saying that, from the perspective of an everlasting world (cf. fr. 30), the individual named Heraclitus is both living and dead. The world's deep structure, as he conceives of it, does not admit the boundaries be- tween things that our ordinary discourse sets up. Those boundaries are 11. Thus I look for a more paradoxical sense of identity than M. SCHOFIELD, 'Heraclitus' theory of soul and its antecedents' , in S. EVERSON ( cf . n. 4 above ), who writes (31): " These opposites count as the same because they share the same form of change. Of each member of each pair one and the same thing is true : that it changes into the other . . . Identity is identity of process ' ' . 12. The Presocratic Philosophers2 (London, 1982), 73.</page><page sequence="16">270 A.A. LONG only half-truths, attempts to view the world from a perspective that fails to counter- balance them with the fundamental unity and flux of everything. Heraclitus insists that we individual selves participate in the world as physical and mental processes, but that we typically fail to understand the significance of this participation. He complains that people in general * * live as though their thinking was a private possession " (fr. 2 ) - here is the em- bryo of disabling subjectivity - and he likens them to sleepers or the deaf (fr. 1 ). They cut themselves off from what he calls * * the common logos ' ' (fr. 2), although self-knowledge, like understanding the logos, is in everyone's power to achieve (fr. 116). As Heraclitus uses logos, the term appears to signify both the world's deep structure or rationale and the ' 1 account ' ' of this that he gives. He offers himself as the speaker of the logos but he tells his audience to listen to it and not to him (frr. 1 and 50). By distinguishing between privacy and community, sleeping and waking, himself as speaker and the independent authority of his account - by drawing these distinctions, Heraclitus indicates that he is trying to reach a wholly objective view of the world. Those who can follow him, he says, will find it wise to agree that all is one (fr. 50). I have suggested that what led Heraclitus to an intuition of the world's deep structure was his attempt to do something paradoxical - to think about appearances from a non-relative or non-perceptual perspective. Do we have any clue as to how he saw himself in regard to this ? In order to set up a genuine comparison with Nagel, it is not enough to show that Heraclitus conceptualised something like The View from Nowhere. What chiefly interests Nagel is whether a person can look at the world from a detached or objective perspective and include his subjective self as one of the contents ofthat detached perspective. Can I so detach from my own skin and personality that /see me as simply one thing among everything else, not a thing which is a special centre of attention ? And would the I that does this seeing still be me in any recognizable sense ? Heraclitus does not talk explicitly about self- transcendence, but he im- plies it when he says : ' ' I went in search of myself ' ' (fr. 101 ). The subject and the object of this sentence seem to be both the same and not the same. Heraclitus is himself. Therefore, if he can search for himself there must be</page><page sequence="17">FINDING ONESELF IN GREEK PHILOSOPHY 271 something about him the object of investigation that is not present to him the searcher. We can interpret what he took this investigation to involve by attending to some of his remarks about the psyche, a term which signifies self or soul or mind. ' ' The soul's logos ",he says, * ' increases itself ' (fr. 115). That cryptic saying seems to be elucidated by another remark : ' ' You will not find out the limits of the soul by going, even if you travel over every way, so deep is its logos'1 (fr. 45). Note the word logos again. Let us translate the term this time by ' ' reason ' ' or ' ' thought ' ' 13 Heraclitus ap- pears to be saying that the mind or the self is unlimited in its capacity for understanding, and further, that understanding causes itself to grow. An interpretation of Heraclitus' search for himself is now at hand : he is seeking for the truths he has tried to present in his conception of deep structure, i.e. an objective understanding of the world. But if that is the search that searching for himself implies, he, or an aspect of him, is an ob- jective understanding of the world. In disclosing truths about nature, Heraclitus is disclosing himself, or rather, in disclosing himself he is disclos- ing truths about nature ; he is discovering the knower in the knowable and the knowable in the knower. The method looks like what we call introspection, but it is not what we typically mean by introspection - reviewing our private states of con- sciousness. What Heraclitus takes himself to be searching for is something like Nagel's objective self - a link between his human individuality and a world that transcends the merely human viewpoint. Or, to put it another way, he is seeking the justification for his philosophical inquiry in facts about the self. He uses his language and thought, the structure of himself, 13. If Parmenides can use Xóyoç to mean ' ' reason " or " thought " , as he does ( cf. his prescrip- tion, xpivat hi Xóycp 7coXú87)ptv £Xeyxov £? l[LÍQtv prjGévxa, fr. 7.4-5 ), I do not see why commentators on Heraclitus shrink from that rendering here. KAHN, The Art of Heraclitus (^ ), translates Xóyov in this fragment of Heraclitus by ' ' report ' ' , but in his commentary on the passage ( 129 ) favours measure ' ' . Yet he also writes ad loc. : ' ' The possession of rational speech may be a significant over- tone here, but this idea cannot explain the adjective 'deep' ".In fact ßocOuc is a standard adjective to apply to the power of thought in Greek at this time ; cf. ßocGuc LSJ sv 4. Later, however ( 130 ), Kahn writes, quite correctly in my view : ' ' By seeking for his own self Heraclitus could find the identity of the universe, for the logos of the soul goes so deep that it coincides with the logos that structures everything in the world " . In any event, we should take the soul's logos to refer to a psychological property that it has. Contrast Schofield (op. cit. n. 11 supra, p. 20), who takes the soul's deep logos to imply merely that the soul is a difficult topic.</page><page sequence="18">272 A.A. LONG as guides to nature. He makes the connection that anyone has to make who believes that an individuar s thinking can result in an objective view of the world. The historical and intellectual gap between Heraclitus and Nagel is enor- mous. Yet they are curiously alike in their approach to self- transcendence. Nagel wants this to explain how we can arrive at a conception of the world which * * explains why the world appears to beings like us in certain respects as it is and in certain respects as it isn't ' ' ( The View from Nowhere, 74 ). Heraclitus meets this condition by his notion of the structure that we and the world share. As perceivers, we relate to the world, let us say, by feeling hot or cold. We do not perceive the unities hot-and-cold, up-and-down. Yet we know that such apparent opposites coexist once we think away the purely perceptual perspective on them. They do not appear as unities, but thought permits us access to a world where they are so. In illustrating Heraclitus' detached viewpoint I pointed out ways in which he collapses distinctions that are fundamental to ordinary life, living versus dying, mortal versus immortal. Does he show any of Nagel's concern about integrating these different perspectives ? Can Heraclitus' view from nowhere include the practice of being a person in the everyday world ? There is clear evidence that he thought so. He lived before the time that philosophers subdivided their subject into metaphysics, logic, ethics and so forth, and one may take his whole philosophy to be a response to the Delphic maxim "Know yourself". Traditionally that had meant, know your limits, know that you are human and not a god. The same message was conveyed in the untranslatable word sophrosyne, which literally means ' ' thinking safe thoughts ' ' . Heraclitus had a comment on sophrosyne : he described it as ' ' the greatest excellence and wisdom, to act and speak what is true, perceiving things according to their nature" (fr. 112); the final phrase in this sentence refers back to the truth claims he makes for his own philosophical message (fr. 1 ). Now we already know why Heraclitus con- nects self-knowledge with a true understanding of the world. That was his point about searching for himself. Has he, then, abandoned the traditional connection between sophrosyne and human limitations ?</page><page sequence="19">FINDING ONESELF IN GREEK PHILOSOPHY 273 I think the answer to this question is partly yes and partly no. Pre- philosophical thought had stressed the limits to human understanding, a point that Xenophanes also echoed, as we saw. Heraclitus has a concept of the self which breaches the traditional distinction between human and divine. His relation to the world is, in a sense, an attempt to think the thoughts of god. This would be a very unsafe thing to do if you were dealing with Olympian Zeus. But Heraclitus 'god is the deep structure of the world, a structure to which Heraclitus takes himself to have access through thought. In that case, it is reasonable for him to link safe thought with acting and speaking what is true. If we want to live authentically, we need a double understanding : we need to know who we are, and we need to know what the world in which we find ourselves is like. Although Heraclitus' objective self alters the perspective on ordinary life, it does not change the conditions ofthat life. After reading and reflecting on him, we will continue to walk up and down, to sleep and to wake. But his version of the view from nowhere is an invitation to see ourselves differently - not as discrete in- dividuals with uniquely personal concerns, but as beings whose lives, from the detached perspective, are inter-connected phases of a much larger scheme. * * * At the beginning of this lecture I argued that past philosophies are not dead artifacts. They have their own historical context, but, like other great works of art, they can leap across centuries. A philosopher can be ahead of his own time, as Heraclitus was in the opinion of many besides myself. Similarly, a philosopher can be deliberately reactionary in good conscience, as Nagel regards himself as partly being. If we think philosophy has anything to do with truth, this should not surprise us. I have looked at Heraclitus from three angles, his historical position, my reading of his say- ings and the contemporary work of Nagel, who never refers to him by the way. In the final part of this lecture I propose to add two further perspec-</page><page sequence="20">274 A.A. LONG tives - the first, that of Plato and Aristotle, is an instructive misreading ; the second, from the Stoic Emperor Marcus Aurelius, is a serious attempt to define himself in a way that combines individual identity with a Heracli- tean conception of his objective standing in the world. Plato notoriously supposed Heraclitus to have held that everything is in flux (cf. Cratylus 402a). From Plato's viewpoint this implied that there is no being but only becoming, and so knowledge is impossible. Aristotle, following Parmenides'lead (as I suppose), took Heraclitus' unity of op- posites to be a flagrant rejection of the principle of non-contradiction - that the same thing can be and not be at the same time - and therefore accused Heraclitus of making everything true (cf. Metaphysics F 1005 b2 2 ; 1012a24). These interpretations, however, fail to fit Heraclitus' conception of his everlasting logos (fr. 1 ) - where everlasting, as I take it, implies the changelessness of the truth it comprises - and the intelligible unity of everything that exists. Heraclitus takes his deep structure to constitute the truth about the world, a truth that is both knowable and something to which he can appeal as a basis for excluding alternative accounts. How could Plato and Aristotle have missed this ? The answer is clear once we see that Heraclitus' logos is the unchanging formula of a world that is incessantly but regularly changing. In terms of its deep structure, the Heraclitean world is a set of regular processes - balanced changes of temperature, density and so forth. What Plato and Aristotle miss in Heraclitus is a conception of the stable beings that they introduced with their theories of forms. In a sense they are right, but not in a way that threatens the coherence of Heraclitus' philosophy. Heraclitus is not attempt- ing to ground our commonsense view of the world in a corresponding set of intelligible forms. Unlike Plato and Aristotle, he thinks there is reason to regard the world's underlying principles as radically different from the way we ordinarily perceive things. Like Nagel, Heraclitus attempts to think himself into a world which is quite lacking in the distinctions that make sense of our everyday perceptions. He could respond to Plato and Aristotle by saying that they share the common fault of idealist philosophers, of projecting our existing conceptual scheme onto the world instead of trying to extend that scheme so as to make it include a genuinely non-human</page><page sequence="21">FINDING ONESELF IN GREEK PHILOSOPHY 275 centered reality. In that respect they fall short of the kind of objectivity he is striving to attain. It is Heraclitus' glimpse ofthat objectivity which gives him a major place in the history of science - not his fortunately correct guess that the world's deep structure is dynamic - but his " audacity to think the unthinkable ' ' . l4 I hope I have shown that, in spite of their different starting-points, Heraclitus can illuminate some of Nagel' s concerns, and vice versa. This does not mean that there is a philosophia perennis ' What makes the com- parison possible is their shared intuition about what we and the world must be like if, in spite of our subjective identities, we have a way of seeing ourselves and the world objectively. I cannot explain why Heraclitus and Nagel have this similar intuition. It may have much to do with the fact that each of them wants to outflank scepticism, that of Xenophanes in the case of Heraclitus, that of the Cartesian legacy in the case of Nagel. However that may be, both Nagel and Heraclitus help us to realize that we cannot be satisfied with a division of the world into so-called external reality and a purely private domain of subjectivity. And for a reason so simple that it is easily missed. The concept of external reality, however limited our grasp of it, is an essential element of our own identity and sanity. Witness what hap- pens to those who retreat into drugs and despair. We would not even know that we have a self with which to converse unless there was a public world for us to knock up against. Someone who had to knock up against the public world much more than he wanted to was Marcus Aurelius. During his work as Emperor and military commander, Marcus Aurelius wrote a series of reflections * * To himself ' . He used Greek philosophy - his interpretation of Stoicism and Heraclitus - as a way of finding or defining himself within the difficult circumstances of his day-to-day life. His meditations, which form a spiritual diary, are the best example I know of what it can mean to combine an objective viewpoint with one's ordinary humanity. 14. I take a phrase from p. 15 of the splendid book by Amos FUNKENSTEIN, Theology and the Scientific Imagination ( Princeton, 1986 ). It is part of a context in which the author is claiming ( 14 ) that ' ' a conceptual revolution consists more often than not in the deliberate adaptation of [ previously demonstrated ] absurdities ' ' .</page><page sequence="22">276 A.A. LONG Marcus' starting-point is the opposite of Descartes'. He grounds his con- ception of himself not in the privacy of his own consciousness but in the thought that he is a part of the world and that the world is a community. By world he means both the microcosm, human society, and the macrocosm, the universe at large. He uses his perception of universal nature to cast light upon how he sees himself as a person. ' ' Let your imagination ' ' , he says, " dwell constantly upon the whole of time and the whole of substance, and realize that their several parts are, by comparison with substance, a fig-seed; by comparison with time, the turn of a gimlet" ( 10. 17 ). 15 From this perspective he sets himself as a momentary process in a universe ' ' that loves to change what is and to create new things in their likeness "(4.36). ' ' Nature's law is that all things change and turn and pass away, so that in due order different things may come to be " ( 12.21 ). Or again, ' ' Universal nature out of its whole material, as from wax, models now the figure of a horse, then melting this down uses the material for a tree, next for a man, next for something else " ( 7.23 ). He tells himself to note ' ' the swiftness of the passage and departure of things that are and of things that come to be. For substance is like a river in perpetual flux, its activities are in continuous changes, and its causes in myriad varieties, and there is scarce anything which stands still, even what is at hand ; dwell, too, on the infinite gulf of the past and the future, in which all things vanish away " (5.23). By such reflections Marcus places himself within a cosmic perspective. What, then, does he have from his own particular viewpoint ? Not the past and not the future but the present ( 2 . 14 ), a finite moment straddled by in- finity on either side. Mutable and temporary though he is within the general scheme of things, he and only he is living his life, and his life is what he has now : * ' remember this, that no one loses any other life than this which he is living, nor lives any other life than this which he is losing "(2.14); the sen- timent reflects Heraclitus both in form and content. Marcus' objectivity, as this meditation shows, involves attachment as well as detachment. He is not a Platonist, with aspirations to transcend the body and find his identity in 15. I borrow A. S.L. FARQUHARSON's translations of MARCUS AURELIUS from vol. 1 of his edition, The Meditations of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius ( Oxford, 1944 ).</page><page sequence="23">FINDING ONESELF IN GREEK PHILOSOPHY 277 being rather than becoming. His detached perspective strengthens his understanding of where he fits within the limits and possibilities of his pres- ent existence. At one moment he sees his own * 4 life as a tiny pinpoint in time, planted on a minute dot in an infinite universe prolonged through eternity". 16 Yet, he will suddenly alter the perspective and reproach himself for wanting to lie in bed when there is work to be done (cf. 5.1), or remind himself of a homely fable or proverb (cf. 11.22,6.54). The jux- taposition of these two viewpoints situates him within a Heraclitean com- bination of opposites. In comparison with the life of the universe, he is insignificant. Yet, however briefly he is part of the life of the universe, allotted time and opportunities that only he can use. His objectivity presents him with a sense of his responsibility, his autonomy, his being a contributor to a social system. ' ' Don't hope ' ' , he says, ' ' for Plato's Utopia, but be con- tent to make a very small step forward and reflect that the result even of this is no trifle " ( 9.29 ). " The matter of the whole is a torrent ; it carries all in its stream. What then, man, is your part ? Act as nature this moment re- quires ; set about it, if it is granted you, and don't look round to see whether anyone will know" (ibid. ). This last sentence is fascinating. Marcus does not ask for witnesses of his behaviour, yet the fact of his not asking for them attests to his own objectivity. His standard of conduct is what perfected nature, i.e. rationality, requires, and not how he will appear in others' eyes. He seeks to be what the Stoics called a citizen of the world. The problem of objectivity is not whether we have it at all, but how far and how flexibly we are prepared to extend it while holding on to our legitimate interests in concerns that are inalienably personal. If Heraclitus could join us today, he would find remarkable proof of our objective selves in the conduct, or at least the results, of scientific research (e.g. particle 16. R.B. RUTHERFORD, introduction (xix) to his edition (Oxford, 1989) of the reissue of Farquharson's translation of Marcus (cf. n. 15 above).</page><page sequence="24">278 A.A. LONG physics). He would also note how erratic the application of objectivity is to such contexts as international relations, political dialogue and decision- making, social cooperation and personal happiness. We continue to make wars, to quarrel over values and ideals, and to regard ' * I think " or ' ' I feel as the centre from which everything else radiates. 17 Perhaps these are an in- evitable aspect of being human. Or perhaps they are not inevitable but a reflection of what T.S. Eliot meant when he wrote in the first of his Four Quartets-, " Human kind cannot bear very much reality". Eliot had Heraclitus in his sights, since he quotes two of his fragments as a preface to these poems : ' ' Although the logos is shared, most people live as though their thinking were a private possession ' ' and ' ' The way up and down is one and the same ' ' . These are hard truths to grasp like many things that are near to home. We have an objective self, but we are highly selective, or should I say subjective, in how we exercise it. SUMMARY : Finding Oneself in Greek Philosophy This paper addresses two interrelated questions. The first question is our relation, as the modern westerners that we are, to Greek philosophy in its historical context. The second question is the relation between Greek philosophical conceptions of the self and what we moderns take ourselves to be when we try to think about the world objectively. My inquiry is motivated by the belief that what a philosopher of the distant past can say to us is in- fluenced by our own independent viewpoint, a viewpoint which may enable us to use that philosopher as a contributor to debates of which he himself had no inkling. Greek philosophers were innocent of the Cartesian tradition and the problems it has generated concerning the connection, if any, between an individual subject of consciousness and the so-called 'external world' . However, I argue that early Greek speculation about the physical world was inward as well as outward looking. Their attempts to think about the world ob- jectively raised issues about the nature of the self- the inquiring (or non-inquiring) sub- ject - issues that, in the case of Heraclitus, are quite explicit. Following up my earlier point about linking modern viewpoints to ancient insights, I make a comparison beween parts of Thomas Nagel's book, The View from Nowhere, and the philosophy of Heraclitus. 17. At the time I was writing this lecture the Gulf War was being fought.</page><page sequence="25">FINDING ONESELF IN GREEK PHILOSOPHY 279 In particular, I argue that Heraclitus adumbrates a concept analogous to Nagel's 'objec- tive self and shares some of Nagel's interests in integrating that perspective with the prac- tice of being a person in the everyday world. In the final part of the paper I comment briefly on Plato's and Aristotle's criticism of Heraclitus, a criticism that, from a modern perspective, seems to me misconceived. I also offer the Stoic Emperor Marcus Aurelius, who was influenced by Heraclitus, as an excellent example of what it could mean to combine an objective viewpoint with one's ordinary humanity. More generally, the paper may be read as a defence of objectivity - not in the sense that we can hope to understand the world independently of our own concepts or culture ( I sidestep any questions about objective truth), but in the sense, rather, that trying to get beyond an irreducibly personal view of things is a basic human propensity ( property of the self) even though our use of it seems bound to be (and perhaps should be) selective.</page></plain_text>
