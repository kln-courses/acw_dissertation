With Plate I-J. Ethnography. Fleure: Winstanley: Singer: De Gu6rin. Correspondence on "Anthropology and our Older Histories." f By H. J. Fleure and L. Winstanley. Il In a paper published in Vov. XLVIII of the Journal of the Royal Anthropo- logical Institute (1918), the remarkable resemblances between the distributions of types of megaliths, to a certain extent of types of ancient skulls, of ancient mines, and of some specified tvpes of finds was worked out, and it was shown that these distributions were curiously similar to that of a certain physical type of man, a point already argued in a previous paper (Vol. XLV1). It was also ar,gued that there was too much resemblance between those distributions and the places mentioned in the early part of British and Irish legendary histories to allow the latter to be dis- missed as pure invention. The suggestion was offered that Anthropology, Archae- ology, and Legendary History in their different ways preserve for us traces of movements of men in the early Bronze Age. The paper has called forth some letters which are of scientific interest, and an account of these is given here by their authors' kind permission. Dr. C. Singer has added valuable evidence, for the presence of dark, broad- headed men in the island of Gozo. In the previous paper (Vol. XLVIII, Journ. Roy. Anthr. Inst.) they were mentioned, with references, for Gerba Island, and places in Tripoli, Tunisia, and Algeria (not always near the coast). Dr. Singer has found that they make up the greater part of the population of Gozo. They are, he says, a remarkably uniform and pure group of medium height, broad-chested, dark, and with cephalic indices of over 82. He sends photographs of twelve individuals and wishes to associate his friend Professor Zammit with himself in these observations. Though megaliths of late date abound in the island, the thirteen skulls from the Hypogeum were all decidedly dolichocephalic, and quite different from the modern type just xnentioned. The evidence is, he adds, imperfect that these dolichocephals were the builders of the Maltese monuments, and in any event the place where the skulls were found was a secondary burial. It would naturally be unwarrantable to claim that all megaliths were the work of one particular stock, and one notes also that the skulls from British long barrows are for the most part very dolichocephalic. With refterence to the connection between Spain and the earlier inhabitants of the British Isles, Dr. Singer notes that in the Book of Cerne (early ninth century, Mercia), there are, in addition to Irish elements, parts traceable to both Mozarabic and Roman influences. The Mozarabic elements could not have come with the Roman influences, and' so must be of Celtic origin. In a further letter Dr. Singer says that the editor of Tacitus' Agricola, in the Loeb Library, points to the avoidance by the Spanish traders of the storms of the Bay of Biscay. To do this they launched themselves well to the west in their trading voyages; hence the first land they made was Ireland. To this cause is perhaps due the displacement of our islands in the maps of the old geographers, and Tacitus, if he misconceived geography, was right enough about trade routes. To this Dr. Singer adds that in the maps of Ptolemy the nearest point to Cape Finisterre (Galicia) by sea trip was Cornwall or Ireland, not any part of Gaul. He says Avenius, in the fifth century, regards Hybernia and Albion,, not Gallia, as the natural goal of sailors from Gades and other parts of Iberia, and he thinks it cQlear that in late Roman times there was active intercourse by way of trade between Spain, Ireland, and England. Archaeological evidence simply pushes back the date [ 129 ]</page><page sequence="3">No. 71.] MAN. [September, 1919. of the openings of this trade, and its continued existence increases the probability that the folklore of the roulte should have survived into legendary history. Colonel de Guerin, of Le Mont Durant, Guernsey, sends invaluable notes on the /. V. Pop inegaliths of that island. He says / 0 " I have lately been iinelined to think !I that our megaliths in Guernsey may be much more recent than they were supposed to be. This view has been impressed on me by the discovery I made this autumn of traces of a JVooden ru(lely sculptured humani figure on the second K \ ' \S?pPing capstone, the broken capstone, of the great | . \ -. \ \ fragment chamber of the dolmen of Ddhus (Fig. 1). The Stone | \ *. + \ figure was sculptured before it was placed in pillar in . position, as we judge from the fact that chamtbe, 1 QK \ \ 8 l \ part of the design is covered by the stone pillar in the centre of the chamber which ijtJJF A \ helps to support this capstone. The relation ship of this figure to similar anthropomorphic sculptures in Guernsey and France is obvious, and as these latter, accordinig to Dechelette and others, date at earliest from late in the Neolithic, at the verge of the eneolithic period, the dolmen of Dehus must be of this age or younger. A copper knife-dagger (Fig. 2) was found in the great chamber of this dolmen by Mr. Lukis (1847), unifortunately not in its original deposit, but in some rubbish that had been move(l by the excavators. It is, however, exactly similar to one found in the Dolmeni de Cabut, commune d'Anglade, Gironde, and to some fouind in round bar- FIG. 1.-ROUGH SKETCH OF SCULPTURES rows in Wiltshire (see Abercromby, Bronze ON SECOND CAPSTONE OF DOLMEN OF Age Pottery). We have also in the Lukis DEHUS. Museum two small bronze rings (Fig. 3) labelled ' Delhus,' which were evidently found in the dolmen, though Mr. Lukis does not say anything about them in the account of his excavations. These, I think, all show that the dolmen was, at least, in use in the first ages of metal. " Of the same period, First Bronze Age, we hlave . small copper celt (ha'che platte) founid at La Houguie du Pommier, and another re- cently presented to the museum by the heirs of the Rev. J. Cachemaille, so long vicar of Sark. It is of larger size than the above, resembling Type 1, Fig. 80, p. 243, Dechelette, Alancielle, Part I, lbut with a rather broader FIG. 2.-COPPER KNIFE-DAGGER FROM DOLMEN OF DEHUS. cutting edge, and was found GUERNSEY.

As you know, these 'haches plattes ' are chiefly found in France along the western coast from Spain to Normandy, and Dechelette quotes them as evidence of trade between Spain and the North at the dawn 7 .... . . . of the Bronze Age. In my opinion X aniother important local evideuce of this intercourse is our Statue Men- hir at the Catel (Fig. 4), which, in spite of D6chelette's opinion to the contrary, is quite as rude in type as any of those in South-Eastern France that 'I have examined. I confidently place it as belonging to . .. the First Bronze Age. ~.... :; "That of St. Martin's (Guern- , % sey) is of course very much more recent, and slhows that the cult - i these statues symbolised lingered oi_ here, as it did in Liguria, long after FIG. 3.- BRONZE RINGS, DOLMEN OF DEHUS, GUERNSEY it had disappeared in France and -BRONZE AXE, ST.

"We have also in Guernsey evidence of an even earlier sea-borne trade with Brittany in the numerous celts of jadeite and other non-native rocks found in the island. If there was intercourse by sea across our dangerous channels it is reasonable to suppose a similar inter- course along the coast. This trade we can trace in Guernsey, Jersey, and Alderney by numerous objects down to La _*_ A Tene III, to which our fairly numerous Iron Age graves in Guernsey belong. The glass beads, for instance, found at La Hougue du Comte are identical with those figured by Dechelette, which, he states, the Gauls imported from Northern Italy. Our corded vases of the same period are exactly similar to _ those of France and south - eastern England, said to be copies in pottery of Italian bronze originals. These all 3 .... bear out your statements of early trade intercourse. "I have in idea that we have evidence of trade from England to the _ Cotentin and our Islands in the short socketed celts or axes of the Fourth Bronze Age with a broad curved cut- ting edge found both in Alderney and Jersey, and possibly also in Sark. We _~ flhave, however, only the cutting edge of one about i inch deep from the latter island to judge by. These all differ from the straight Armorican type whiclh FIG. 4.-STATUE MENHIR, CITEL, GUERNSEY. is also found in Jersey and Alderney. [ 131 ]</page><page sequence="5">Nos. 71-72.] MAN. [September, 1919. "I made a study of our Bronze and Early Iron Age remains last year, and came to the conclusion that we had evidence to prove man's existence in Guernsey from the neolithic period down to our own times without any break. True, our objects of bronze are not as numerous as those of Aldernev and Jersey, but they are individual finds of varied types and dates, whereas in Jersey the individual finds are fewer than ours, the greater number of objects coming from three or four 'hoards,' and as far as I could discover only the two last stages of the Bronze Age are represented, and the earlier ages are absent. In the museum of the Societe Jersiaise there is a fine bronze dagger (poignard a antennes) of Hallstatt I type, but curiously the later Iron Ages are hardly represented, except by a few small objects, Gaulish coins and fragments of pottery. Of course the chief treasure is their famous gold torque, either of the Fourth Bronze Age or Hallstatt I. The Hallstatt period is hardly represented in Guernsey, unless we can identify the Roche-qui-sonne bracelets and jug-shaped vase as belonging to the last stage of it." I wish to thank the gentlemen who have sent these valuable letters. HI. J: FLEURE. DESCRIPTION OF PLATE I-J. MEN OF Gozo. (Photos by Prof. Zammit and Dr. C. Singer, kindly lent.) 1. Age 30.
