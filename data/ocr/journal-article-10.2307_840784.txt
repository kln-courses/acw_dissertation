The Meaning of "Sources of Law" The "legal formants" of a system of law are never in complete harmony. Nevertheless, the "sources of law" are usually explained to suggest that they provide a single answer to every legal problem. In countries such as Germany, France and Italy, hortatory state- ments are made that acknowledge, as sources of law, those envis- aged by the constitution. Although the disharmony among legal formants of the system is most evident in France, the French constitution preserves the ideas of the late eighteenth century according to which legal rules can only be created by organs of government charged with legislative functions. In France, this constitution is thought to explain com- pletely the creation of rules. Nevertheless, in France, as elsewhere, the civil law evolves incessantly, driven on by innovative judicial so- lutions. Even in France, jurists acknowledge the contribution made by this droit pretorien, which, like the work of the ancient Roman praetor, is a pillar of the legal system supporting much of the weight. The French discussions of private law acknowledge this contribution, just as their treatments of constitutional law usually deny it. In other European countries as well, discussions of constitu- tional law typically mention one or a very few of the legal formants of the system. Jurists in the fields of private law and labor law, however, are not willing to ignore "practice" which, in continental Europe, consists of those legal formants of the system controlled by judges and administrative organs. This does not mean that the con- stitutional lawyers are wrong, nor that the experts in private law and labor law are subverting the constitution. It is simply that some elements of the system are constitutionalized, and these are the ones RoDoLFO SACCO is Professor of Law, University of Turin (Italy). Edited by James R.

L 1 (1991). 343</page><page sequence="2">344 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 the constitutional lawyers refer to in their discussions. We might re- fer to them as enacted legal formants as distinguished from those which have grown up without formal enactment. No one who wishes to describe the law realistically can ignore the existence of sources other than those formerly recognized in the Constitution. Sometimes these sources are recognized by speaking of a "constitution in action" (costituzione materiale) or a living law (diritto vivente) and so forth. Others speak as though in an ideal (perfect) legal system the only sources of law would be those indi- cated in the constitution, even though, in reality, many rules are cre- ated by courts, arbitrators, and administrative bodies. Although they try to take account of the actual world, their descriptions con- tain a contradiction. When they say that the judge creates law, they imply that when he does so, the legislator has been ignored or superceded. Thus the work of the judge, as they describe it, contra- dicts the rule that they themselves proclaim-that the legislator's will is law and must be obeyed. Surprisingly enough, however, the contradiction is only appar- ent. One can believe both in the omnipotence of the legislator and in the creative power of the judge. The reason is that statute and judicial practice are concerned with different legal formants of the system, which themselves may have different contents. One can af- firm the power of the legislator to make statutes without denying that judicial decisions are another source of law. To do so, however one must acknowledge that judicial decisions are a source of law, whether or not they are mentioned in the constitution. Any account of the sources of law is incomplete unless it describes all legal for- mants of the system. To have a complete account, we must recognize the rules promulgated by organs of the state and enforced by its coercive power are not the only sources of law. The positivist view that law is created and enforced by the state creates a dangerous optical illu- sion. The organs of the state may choose, conscientiously or uncon- sciously, to enforce rules created elsewhere, for example, the rules found in scholarly writing, in manuals, and in teaching in the un- viersities. The positivist view leads one to neglect these sources. B. Sources of Law and Interpretation Law cannot be applied unless it is interpreted.l When law is ap- 1. Interpretation is guided by what the interpreter thought and felt even before he started to read and analyze the source. This is the clue of Josef Esser's master- piece, Vorverstandnis und Methodenwahl in der Reschtsfindung (1972). In agree- ment with Esser's thesis is Rodolfo Sacco's in n concetto di interpretazione del diritto (1947). See also Jerome Frank, Law and the Modern Mind (1931).</page><page sequence="3">1991] LEGAL FORMANTS 345 plied, there must be an interaction between a primary source, such as statute or precedent, and an interpretation. Interpretation, in turn, is determined and disciplined by all those factors that affect the convictions of the interpreter. Whatever affects the convictions of the interpreter is thus a source of law as applied. An obvious example is university teaching. In truth, legal science has not yet made the least effort to de- scribe this phenomenon correctly. Typically, if a jurist interprets a statute, the statute is said to be the source of the law as applied and no mention is made of the jurist. If the jurist presents his conclu- sion without support in a statute, and the case law subsequently adopts it, the case law is said to be the source of law and no mention is made of the jurist. Such a description is arbitrary. Whatever influences interpretation is a source of law. To dis- cover what influences interpretation various methods can be used. For example, one can examine the sources that an interpreter uses, be he lawyer or judge, when he advocates or adopts an interpreta- tion of a rule. It has been said that the California Civil Code of 1872, drawn up along the lines of the Field Civil Code, was stillborn. According to jurists such as Pomeroy the aim of the Code was to interpret and restate prior common law.2 Therefore the interpreter had to consult the cases decided before the Code was enacted. Similarly, when It- aly adopted a new civil code in 1942 to replace the previous code of 1865, scholars continued to cite earlier German doctrine as, indeed, they had done before this code was enacted. They were convinced that the new code was incomprehensible without an understanding of the concepts underlying it, and that these concepts had been de- scribed with unsurpassable accuracy by the German writers. There- fore they consulted German doctrine to interpret the law in force. One wonders, at this point, to what extent the legislator can ever have its own will respected. This question has a twofold an- swer. First of all, any normal legislator can make himself obeyed to a considerable extent if he adopts a rule that is clear, precise, and easily understood by the judge who must enforce it. Either the rule must be drafted so that the judges can understand it given their cur- rent educational background, or care must be taken to educate judges so that they will be qualified to understand such rules. Second, however, for a statute to command attention it must somehow be placed on a pedestal. It must be sacralised. Rules have that status when they are felt by those who must enforce them to be the product of a great social breakthrough. The American constitu- 2. See Pomeroy, "The True Method of Interpreting the Civil Code," 4 West Coast Reporter 109 (1884).</page><page sequence="4">346 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 tion is an example.3 So also are rules that break polemically with the past after a period of acute social conflict such as certain rules enacted during the French Revolution and many of the rules en- forced in socialist countries today. An important form of sacralization takes place when a society elevates the authors of the law to a level higher than the rules themselves. The fact that Dante put Justinian in heaven in his Di- vine Comedy tells us something we might miss reading the commen- tators on Roman law: the idea, germinating in the medieval cult of Roman law, that the Corpus iuris civilis was compiled by a sort of divine mandate. C. Scholarship as a Source of Law We have mentioned that scholarly writings, both essayistic and didactic, are a source of law, that is, they form a "legal formant" of the system.4 A doctrinal proposition contained in these writings may, however, work in various ways. It may describe the content of a rule, as when a French professor says that the conveyance of a person who believes himself to be heir is effective. It may be a defi- nition unconnected to any rule of decision as when an Italian profes- sor defines a "juristic act". It may describe a method to be followed in reaching legal conclusions as when a professor defends the histor- ical method, the conceptual method, the sociological method, the comparative method, and so forth. Again, a doctrinal proposition may pass judgment on the respective importance of different sources of law. For example, it may urge a person to follow case law despite conflict with a statute or to disregard creative judicial activity and return to the letter of the statute. At various points in history, doctrinal propositions have been re- garded as the supreme source of law. One such case was that of the Roman law in force in continental Europe from the Middle Ages un- til the enactment of the German Civil Code. Frequent hortatory statements were made that the law in force was the Roman law of the Corpus iuris as modified by Canon Law. The legitimacy of the Corpus iuris appeared to be guaranteed by the authority (unques- tioned hence evident, and, therefore, real) of the Emperor Justinian. Juridically, the Holy Roman Empire was thought to be a continua- tion of the empire founded by Augustus which Justinian had once ruled. A second source of legitimacy was the intrinsic rationality of 3. Bodenheimer, in Law in the U.S.A. for the 1980s, Report from the US.A., for the XI Congress, Supplement to the Amer. Journ. of Comp. Law, 1982, p. 15 ff. 4. The best synthesis of the theme is Pier Giuseppe Monateri's "'Legal Doc- trine as a Source of Law,' in Italian National Reports to the XII I.C.C.L., Sidney, 1986, 1986. See also all reports on the topic (labelled 1-B-2) presented at the congress.</page><page sequence="5">1991] LEGAL FORMANTS 347 Roman law, a source that is bound to be important whenever posi- tivists' conceptions of law have made concessions to rationalistic and naturalistic conceptions. Moreover, as we have seen, one might even believe, that a divine mandate had been executed by Justinian. The fact that the political authorities of the day such as the Holy Roman Emperors placed their stamp of approval on the Roman law after it had already been received added little to its legitimacy. Actually, the Justinian corpus gave rise to a body of rules ex- plicit in none of its texts and in constant evolution. In the course of this evolution, particular Roman solutions were often consigned to oblivion. Institutions that were not central to the Roman legal sys- tem were given wide appliction. A body of rules emerged applicable to contracts in general, as distinguished from the Roman rules appli- cable to particular contracts. The rules of contract law, which in Rome was merely a source of obligation, were then allowed to in- vade the field of transfers of property. Unitary rules of tort law emerged from the Roman rules of particular torts such as those of the lex Aquilia which governed damaged wrongfully done. The Ro- man condictio was expanded to create a generalized remedy for un- just enrichment. Indeed, towards the end of this metamorphosis, the glorious doctrine of the creation of legal obligation through the will of the parties was recognized. Methodologically, these results were achieved by studying substantive law without regard to the procedures in which it is enmeshed, through the use of dialectic, and the free pursuit of the raison d'etre of the rule. The journey began with a letter of the corpus iuris and ended with the final draft of the German Civil Code. It was long indeed. Every step of this journey was taken by interpreters, and in the first instance, by the medieval doctors of the Roman law. It would not be right, however, to ignore the contribution of judges and prac- titioners. Wieacker, Gorla, Cannata, Gambaro and Dawson have shown the importance in the development of law of the giving of legal advice, judicial decisions, and practice in general. Neverthe- less, the person who guides interpretation is, first and foremost, the scholar in his double role as a writer of authoritative works and as a university lecturer. Authority was given to the opinions of single theorists sometimes to the comunon opinion of a certain number of learned scholars. The citation of Roman law was pro forma and was accompanied by a citation to the scholar who interpreted it. Thus the (unquestioned) legitimacy of the Roman legal text was extended to the scholarly interpreter. The situation has been much the same in Islamic law. The source of Islamic law, legitimized by hortatory statements and reli- gious logic, is a revelation that gives legal propositions the air of in- fallibility. Nevertheless, though all law (sharta) comes from God,</page><page sequence="6">348 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 and whatever comes from God to man comes through revelation, the revealed sources do not deal explicitly with all problems and their meaning is often uncertain. The gaps must be filled and the uncer- tainty dispelled by means of interpretation, priority being given to solutions reached before the tenth century A.D. Although theology may guarantee the infallibility of this interpretation, at a human level, the scholar (alim, fakih)5 is recognized as the architect of this immense framework of rules. The revealed texts are only the his- torical starting point of the sharzia which is a scholarly creation. This scholarly monopoly is established or at least strengthened by two circumstances. First, the shania is part of theology and, in Is- lam, there is no authority empowered to define a truth of faith. Sec- ond, the Islamic judge (kadi) does not give reasons for his decisions or explain the point of law at issue. Thus there is little room for a cult of judicial precedent. Another example is the role that scholars have come to play in the United States. In England, the courts have concerned them- selves with the law as applied and little with the work of scholars. The professor writes accounts of what judges do and, in his teaching, tries to familiarize the students with judge-made law. In the United States, although the courts have similar powers to those of England, the coexistence of numerous autonomous state judicial systems forces these systems into competition. Judges in different states de- cide the same questions differently. The job of comparing solutions is performed by scholars who, by applying logical, doctrinal methods to the cases, express their own conclusions. They become arbitra- tors who approve or disapprove of judicial decisions. To defend their views, the scholars elaborate systematic criteria for the legal method around which "schools" form such as the current law and economics movement. The importance of scholarly activity is perhaps the fea- ture which most distinguishes American from English law. D. Legitimacy in Scholarly Power The scholar who creates law does so without wishing to or real- izing that he is doing it. He instinctively aspires to be a source of law but is terrified of giving his work an ad hoc legitimacy. The German scholars of the last century, the Pandectists, sought legiti- macy by claiming to interpret the Corpus iuris. Thefakih has legit- imacy because the source he interprets is sacred. Legitimacy may always be claimed by imagining a very general principle, capable of a hundred different applications, and linking to this general principle whatever practical rules one wishes to pro- 5. See here Francesco Castro, Les pouvoirs du faqih, in Rapports italiens au XI C.I.D.C., Carascas 1982 (1982).</page><page sequence="7">1991] LEGAL FORMANTS 349 pose. Such a technique is used by those who claim to have reached their conclusions by sociological methods and by those who claim to have done so by balancing the interests. The law and economics movement may be operating in the same way. If we seek a justifica- tion for the creation of law by scholars we run the risk of not find- ing one. It is better to simply describe the instrument by which this creation takes place. The scholar has no other power than the one that comes from his capacity to persuade. He is, after all, a professor and an author, roles that multiply his chances of influencing the law by force of persuasion. A professor and author influences a student who learns the law from his book or his lectures. The often repeated claim that the student of the civil law learns law from the code is absurd. The student of civil law learns law when he prepares for an examination, and he prepares for the examination with a textbook after attending the professor's lectures. Of course, he has the capacity to criticize the professor's teaching but he will not exercise it until he has lis- tened to a second professor who teaches doctrines different than the first. Once he has become a judge, yesterday's student will be keen to apply the law he has learned in the university. The history of law is filled with episodes that can serve as ex- amples. Recently, Sudanese judges applied the common law be- cause they knew it even though the law supposedly in force was contained in a code. Now the common law is once more in force, but a new generation of judges still applies the code because it is the only source they know.6 In France, after the enactment of the Code Napoleon, a mass of Roman or old French rules continued to be ap- plied by judges who had trained at the university studying Roman or royal law. The kings of England, Poland and Hungary defended the legal traditions of their countries by preventing future judges from studying Roman law.7 Conversely, the fortunes of Roman law in Germany were tied to the fact that university education in Roman law was the only route to practice before courts and in offices.8 The importance of the creation of law by scholars in different periods might lead us to ask whether, and to what extent, it is possi- ble to see a relation between their role and the structures of a given society. No one has performed such research using a suitable method. 6.

Still today Michel Fromont and Alfred Rieg write of the German situation: "On constate ainsi une profonde penetration de la doctrine dans la jurisprudence, qui laisse songeur tout juriste francais" (Introduction au droit allemand, I, 1977, p. 208).</page><page sequence="8">350 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 Also worthy of study is the extent to which the nationalization of law inhibits its creation by scholars. At the political level, nation- alization occurs when the organs of state authority such as the legis- lator, ministers, and judges, wish to control the creation of law themselves. Nationalization occurs in the realm of ideas when it is thought that law is a state system of rules, and consequently that the area in which a rule in force coincides with the territorial boundaries of the state or a well determined administrative division of it. Examples of nationalized law are the French system as estab- lished by the Jacobin and by Napoleon and preserved thereafter. Other examples are imitations of the French system, including so- cialist systems and, perhaps in part, the British system. Examples of non-nationalized law are the Roman law of continental Europe before codification and Islamic law. In theory, however, it would be possible for nationalized law to be created by a scholarly authority. For example, in a one party state, a class of theorists might arise that were admired by the party. Or, for example, in a state domi- nated by some form of personal power, scholars might be given power because they are admired by the ruler. VII. A SECOND APPLICATION: THE LAW OF CONTRACT A. The Problem Contract is usually defined in terms of an exchange of promises, or mutual expressions of consent, or the declarations of will of two or more parties.9 Of course it is necessary to have the consent of all parties if the contract imposes obligations on all parties.10 The of- feree must accept before he can be obligated. If the contract im- poses obligations or other burdens on only one of the parties, however, then it is far from obvious that the other party needs to consent. The need for the other party to consent has been said to follow from either of two premises, each of which has different practical consequences. One premise is that the will of the individual has complete control over whatever happens in the individual's own legal sphere. It is argued from this premise that the individual's sphere cannot be altered for better or for worse by the unilateral will of the other party as long as the alteration is not justified by some previous relationship between the parties. The second premise is that one cannot inflict unjust damage on another. From this 9. Fundamental on the gathering of materials Formation of contracts, cit. (Ru- dolf B. Schlesinger ed.). 10. This definition is already usual in the study of the Pandectis (Georg Fried- rich Puchta, Pandekten, 12th ed. 1877, ? 54 p. 84: "Bilateral juridical agreements are called contracts").</page><page sequence="9">1991] LEGAL FORMANTS 351 premise, one can argue that individual's legal sphere cannot be al- teredfor the worse by the unilateral will of another. If the legislator subscribes to the first premise and all its consequences, he will allow no one to be impoverished without his consent. Consent, of course, may sometimes be given when the offeree is silent, but here it is important to distinguish. Under some circum- stances a judge would rightly conclude that the silence, although an omission, is a means of expressing the offeree's will. Under these circumstances silence indicates a will to accept. In contrast, as soon as the judge is prevented from examining the circumstances in order to determine the meaning of the offeree's silence, it is a fiction to say that the offeree has expressed his will to consent. If a contract is formed nonetheless, then the true rule of law is not that the of- feree gives consent by his silence but rather that the offer alone forms a contract provided it is not rejected by the offeree.1 B. Materials We are now in a position to consider the nature of an agreement or contract in different legal systems. An excellent starting point is Article 1108 of the French Civil Code. According to this article, one element necessary for there to be an agreement (convention) is "the consent of the party who obligates himself" ("le consentement de la partie qui s'oblige"). It would seem, then, that a promise is neces- sary for an obligation to arise but not an acceptance unless the promisee must obligate himself. By way of exception, the Code re- quires an acceptance in the case of certain formal contracts, such as donations and agreements affecting property rights between the spouses. Nevertheless French scholars have reached to different conclu- sion. They believe that Article 1108 contains an error. An agree- ment actually requires the consent of both parties, and strangely enough, the scholars support their view by a leteralistic reading of Article 1108.12 11. The explanation provided by some authors, according to which it is the law that attributes to silence the unequivocal positive meaning is ingenuous. The law may determine the legal effects, but not the de facto situation itself. 12. Thus, for example, Charles Demolombe, Cours de Code Nap., XII, n. 45; Karl Zachariae, Cours de droit civil franqais, I, 343, n. 1; Charles Aubry and Charles Rau, Cours de droit civil, 6th ed., IV, 343, n. 2, n. 6; Rene Demogue, Traite des obligations. Sources, 1923, II, n.546. The correction of the letter of the law would become neces- sary for this motive: once the will of the obligor has been defined as "consent," it would be impossible to prescind from the bilateral nature of the consent itself. Most surprising is the explanation put forward by Victor Marcade, Explication th&amp;orique et pratique du Code Nap., IV, sub-art. 1108, n. 394: "The law demands, above all, the consent of the obligor, that is his assent to the will previously displayed by the other party." Also Alexandre Duranton, Cours de droit civil franqais, IV, p. 27, n. 95: "Say-</page><page sequence="10">352 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 As soon as it was born, therefore, Article 1108 created a schism between the Code and its interpreters. In the 19th century, French scholars went further. They concluded, not only that an unaccepted promise could not produce a contract, but that it could not have legal affect even outside the domain of contract law. Whatever one may think of this conclusion, one can at least say that the French scholars then, unlike French or Italian scholars today, defended a clear operational rule rather than a mere tautology. Today, supposedly, the rule that contract requires the consent of all parties is supposedly still intact although, since the end of the 19th century, the French have acknowledged exceptions in which some types of unilateral promises are given effect. At a purely logi- cal level, one could criticize the French scholars for not investigating sufficiently the effect of Articles 1101 and 1108 in practice. A much more serious criticism, however, is that the aprioristic, anti-literal approach of the French interpreters is so sterile as to be unusable in practice. Sensing its difficulties, a number of French authors have made use of the fiction just discussed.'3 They have interpreted the silence of the offeree as a manifestation of his consent without any inquiry into the circumstances and the reasons for his silence. Other au- thors reject this path and so find themselves forced into more con- spicuous contradictions. In the middle of the last cenutury, for example, Demolombe observed that Article 1108 seems to demand the consent of the promisor alone. Yet it seems obvious, he said, that the consent of the other party is also necessary. Since the of- feree has no reason to refuse an offer that can only benefit him, Demolombe concluded that this consent should be regarded as im- plicit.14 More recently, an important movement in French doctrine ing with the code that the obligor's consent is necessary, we mean that the will of the party to whose profit the obligation is born contributes to its formation too, be- cause consent necessarily supposes the concurrence of two reciprocal wills." A similar attitude may be found among German interpreters of the Code Nap. Cfr., for example, Bauerband, Institutionen desfranzosischen in den deutschen Lan- den des linken Rheinufers geltenden Civilrechts (1873) ? 242: "The legal validity of a patrimonial contract requires, according to art. 1109, four elements: 1st the consen- sus ad idem of the Paciscenten (Die Willenseinigung der Paczscenten) . . ." 13. Charles Demolombe, Cours, cit., XII, nn. 57 &amp; 59. In reality, Demolombe, at a certain point, senses the vicious circle of the whole argument, subjoining, as to the silence of the offeree, that he has no motives for refusal: "And perhaps here lies an explanation of art. 1108, which seems only to demand the consent of the party obli- gated." If Demolombe had transformed this doubt into a certainty, he would have broken the spell that has enchained French doctrine for such a long time. Gabriel Baudry Lacantinerie and Louis Barde, Desobligations, 1895 I, n. 45; Rene Demogue, Sources, cit., II, n. 554 ter (examples: promise of guarantee; here citations of court decisions), and I, n. 189 quater (modification of insurance contract in favour of the assured; here case law). 14.

It is evident that such an argument is adopted only to avoid applying the principle that both parties must consent. Still another way around that principle is taken by those writers who say that the validity of the promisee's declaration can never be attacked because the promisee can have no interest in attacking it.15 Even recent scholarship, however, continues to insist on the need for both parties to consent. The need for them to do so is de- duced from the definition of contract as agreement. This definition is drawn from Article 1101 without even a mention of Article 1108. When the offeree is silent he is said to have manifested his assent by omission.16 The practice of the courts, however, indicates that there is no need to insist on an acceptance by the offeree of a promise that bur- dens only the promisor. In 1938, the Chambre des requetes of the French Court of Cassation considered a case in which a lessor of- fered to modify a lease in a manner that burdened only himself:17 by reducing the rent. The lessee did not reply, and the lessor claimed that the modification was ineffective. The Court of Appeal ruled in favor of the lessee, and this decision was upheld by the Court of Cassation on the ground that the trial court is permitted to find that silence counts as acceptance when an offer is made in the exclusive interest of the offeree. The French jurist Voirin, com- menting on the decision, was unable to explain how an unaccepted offer could produce a legal effect. Indeed, the outcry that the deci- sion provoked indicates that its true nature was appreciated by French jurists. Once it is acknowledged that silence counts as ac- ceptance when a offer only imposes sacrifices on the offeror, then the transaction is effective because of the nature of the offer rather than because of an acceptance by the offeree. Nevertheless, this 1938 decision was reaffirmed by the Court of Cassation in 1970.18 Other decisions are in harmony with this result. For example, according to the Code, a mortgage arises by agreement but, like other transactions in land, is not valid unless a formality is completed before a notary (Art. 2127). If an agreement requires two the mistake of the donee, and of the gratuitous bailee. The question is not raised, however, of the incapacity of the promisee because, in France, it is quite certain that "le pupille n'a pas besoin de son tuteur pour faire sa condition meilleure." (arg. ex arts. 1125, 1305, 1306). 15. Ghestin, "Le contrat," in Traiti de droit civil, (Jacques Ghestin, 1988), n. 278, 5, 284 and ff. 16. Dalloz, 1939, D.P. I, 5. 17.

The older scholarship drew this conclusion. The courts, instead, require that only the consent of the mortgagor be certified by the notary. The more recent scholarship has abandoned its old conclusions but has gained partial revenge by speaking of a non-formal, indeed, a tacit acceptance by the mortga- gee who manifests his will by requiring notarial certification of the mortgage.'9 In Germany, the Civil Code does not explicitly define contract (Vertrag). Section 145 and the sections following implicitly presup- pose that an acceptance is necessary. It is usually said that a con- tract is formed by the expression of will of both parties.20 Nevertheless, according to Section 516, par. 2 of the German Civil Code, when a gift is not accepted, the donor may set a time limit after which the gift is perfected as long as the donee has not refused it. Despite Section 516, however, scholars continue to teach that a gift requires the consent of both parties.2' In the hands of the scholars, the concept has replaced the rule. Potentially, Section 516 could be applied not only to a donation in the strict sense but to many other promises which burden the promisor alone. The German Civil Code defines Schenkung to in- clude any transfer of property by which an individual enriches an- other and impoverishes himself when it is understood that the transfer will take place without recompense. Thus, Schenkung does not require animus donandi,22 the intention to benefit another gra- tuitously. Therefore, Section 516 could be applied to transactions which, in Italian law, would not be donations because they lack such an intent: for example, promises to guaranty the obligation of a third party. The disadvantage of interpreting Section 516 in this way is that then, the formal requirements necessary for a donation in the strict sense would be required in other transactions as well, such as 19. German authors insist less on this point than the French. This depends on the fact that their attention is directed mainly to the definition of the juridical act in general, and the clarification of the conceptual relationship between jural act, decla- ration and non-declaratory behaviour. Nonetheless, in Germany too the definition of the contract as a bilaterally created institution is still solid (see, above all, Ludwig Enneccerus and Hans C. Nipperdey, Aligem. Teil, ? 161 a.). 20.

The intention of the parties must be aimed to the attribution, and to "Unentgeltlichkeit (the absence of valuable consideration). The intention to make a present (animus donandi) is not, however, required by the law (RG. 70, n. 17; 72, n. 191; 73, n. 48; 94, n. 14; 125, n. 385).

For that reason, German courts and scholars have not pushed Section 516 to its limits. German law has bypassed the need for the offeree's consent in other ways. For example, Section 107 provides that an agreement with a minor is valid if the minor obtains a benefit but assumes no burden. The requirements for making such an agreement, there- fore, are allowed to turn on the absence of a burden to the minor. Other inroads have been made by applying Section 151. Accord- ing to this section which appears in the part of the Code devoted to contracts in general, a contract may be binding "without the mani- festation of an acceptance to the offeror" when "such a manifesta- tion was not to be expected according to commercial custom." In a typical application of this section, an acceptance is said to be unnec- essary when offeree has actually begun performance. Interpreters claim that this section does not permit a contract to be formed with- out an acceptance. It merely recognizes that an acceptance may take place through performance as well as through a communication where custom so prescribes. Nevertheless, the case law has used Section 151 to hold a party to a contract when he is silent after hav- ing received the other party's offer, and when he should have spo- ken, given the previous relations between the parties.23 In a further extension of Section 151, an individual's silence has been deemed to be an acceptance when the consent of that individ- ual is "obvious" (selbstverstandlich). Typical cases involve the aban- donment of actions, the assumption of debts, and other unrecompensed benefits to the offeree.24 In Italy, Article 1321 of the Civil Code defines a contract as an agreement. According to Article 1333, however, an offer that entails burdens only for the offeror will be binding without an acceptance unless the offeree rejects it "in the manner required by the nature of the business or by custom." Italian scholars, however, continue to defend their traditional views by means of philological expedients, like those of the French. The case law follows the rule of Article 1333 but explains that the offeree has made a "tacit acceptance" through his silence. Some interpreters have seen that in the cases covered by Article 1333, one cannot presume that the offeree has consented; following Vittorio Scialoja, however, they have denied that the offeror's liabil- ity rests on contract. In a monograph written in 1975,25 I argued 23. See the case law cited in the Grosskommentare, cit., BGB, I, ? 151, 1.

A continental European is struck by the definitions he finds in John</page><page sequence="14">356 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 that in such cases liability rests on contract and that there is no rea- son why a contract cannot be formed by a single party's consent. Despite my arguments, Italian scholars continue to insist that there are only two possibilities: either a single party consents and then li- ability cannot rest on contract, or both parties consent-the offeree through silence-and then a contract is formed. We can now summarize some of the results of our brief compar- ative survey. First, in the codes we have examined, the consent of both parties is required only in the case of contracts with considera- tion and, in some cases, in the case of formal contracts. Second, the scholars in these countries ignore rules that contradict their princi- ple that both parties must consent. Third, the courts in these coun- tries enforce a promise that burdens the promisor alone, even if it is not accepted, unless there are special reasons for requiring an ac- ceptance. Fourth, the scholars square their conclusions with the codes and the practice of the courts on a purely verbal level by as- serting that the silence of the offeree constitutes an acceptance. The reader from a common law country will note that there is a distinct similarity between the Continental definitions and those offered by English and American scholars.26 He will also note a similarity in practical problems, as in Carlill vs. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. and Of- ford vs. Davies,27 and a similar search for practical solutions ex- pressed, in the United States, by Section 90 of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts. C. The Significance of the Materials We can conclude that in civil law countries, except in the case of liberalities such as gifts, a promise is binding without an acceptance if the promise is not conditional on the giving of a second promise. It would not be prudent to rely on this conclusion without fur- ther investigation. We have not yet determined whether this conclu- sion holds for formal contracts and for contracts to transfer property. Also the French examples we have used might be thought unconvincing for three reasons. First, in its 1938 decision, the Court of Cassation did not say that silence constitutes acceptance but that the trial court had power to consider whether silence would count as acceptance. Second, the case concerned the parties to a lease, a fact that might be relevant in deciding whether the offeree had a duty to Salmond and Glanville Williams, The Law of Contract (1945) or the definition put forward by William M. Geldart, Elements of English Law (8th ed. 1975). And of course he notes the difference from Arthur L. Corbin, Contracts (1963) I, p. 52ff. 26. 1893, I, Q.B., 256; 1862, 12 C.B. (N.S.), 748. 27.

Finally, the case involved a reduction of rent and so is somewhat like the cancellation or forgiveness of a debt. The cancellation of a debt is a transaction with an ambiguous nature, somewhat like a contract and somewhat like a unilateral renuncia- tion of rights. Nevertheless, the French case is in point because it illustrates a more general problem. The requirement that both parties consent is not imposed by statute in any of the countries that we have ex- amined. Nevertheless, it is proclaimed everywhere by scholars. Courts manage to read the formulas of the scholars into their statu- tory texts but, when confronted with an offer that produces only benefits for the offeree, they resort to the fiction of the offeree's tacit, presumed, or feigned consent. The contrast can be summarized in the following chart: EFFECT OF AN OFFER BURDENING THE OFFEROR ALONE Statute Scholarly Opinion Case Law France valid invalid valid Germany valid invalid valid Italy valid invalid valid This chart is misleading in one respect. It neglects the fact that even the judges pay lip service to the principle that contract requires the consent of both parties. It neglects the fact that the scholars, de- spite their insistence that the consent of the offeree is required, agree with the practical results which the judges have reached. To complete the picture, we should also note that even the statutes con- tain general definitions of agreement in which the consent of both parties is required (Art. 1101 French Civil Code, Section 145 German Civil Code, Article 1321 Italian Civil Code), as well as particular pro- visions that dispense with the need for the offeree to consent (Arti- cle 1108, French Civil Code, Section 516 German Civil Code, Article 1333 Italian Civil Code). Thus a more accurate picture is given by the following chart: EFFECT OF AN OFFER BURDENING THE OFFEROR ALONE Scholarly Statute Opinion Case Law General Specific General Specific Rules Results definition rules formulas results announced reached France invalid valid invalid valid invalid valid Germany invalid valid invalid valid invalid valid Italy invalid valid invalid valid invalid valid The contrasts shown in this chart emerge where they would be</page><page sequence="16">358 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 least expected. They concern the tortured relationship between general definitions and operative rules. The general definitions or formulae seem to have very little effect on these rules. Indeed, one might even conclude that in legal systems that are similar, such as those of these three civil law countries, there is a greater resemblance among like legal formants of different systems than among different legal formants of the same system. Of course there are other possibilities as well. The study of other problems would show that sometimes one legal formant such as the operational rules, has a greater tendency to be borrowed by other systems than another legal formant, such as general definitions. In any event, our analysis of this problem has shown clearly how the most general legal formants of a system, the definitions and formulae, tend to overlook the results of particular cases. VIII. A THIRD APPLICATION: THE "OBJECTIVE ELEMENT" IN TORT LiABILITY A. The Problemr2 Strict liability is the exception in civil law as in common law systems. Normally, to recover, plaintiff must show the defendant was at fault and his fault caused the damage that the plaintiff has suffered. The problem we will now consider is whether there is an- other element necessary for the plaintiff to recover, an element which we shall call "the objective element." If this "objective ele- ment" is required, then any damage caused by fault will not give rise to liability. In modern Codes we may at first sight see two alterna- tives: There may be liability only in certain typical situations. The former, known as principle of neminem laedere, is the solution of the French Code. The latter, enacted in the German B.G.B., was the solution of the Roman law and of traditional common law. In both of these systems, there was a list of actions that a plaintiff could bring against the person who had hurt him: in Roman law, actions for theft, robbery, insult, and damage wrongfully done; in English law, for trespass, assault, libel, and so forth. The French Conception from 1806 to the Present Day Although only particular torts were actionable in Roman law, the Roman jurists coined the general formula neminem laedere, "in- jure no one." That formula became the basis of Article 1382 of the Code Napoleon: liability is imposed for "any action of a man which causes damage to another" (tout fait quelconque de l'homme, qui cause a autrui un dommage). The text does not necessarily mean, 28. Droit civil frangais (2nd ed. 1850) ? 444.</page><page sequence="17">1991] LEGAL FORMANTS 359 however, that any damage caused by fault gives rise to liability. The history of the interpretation of the French Civil Code shows that this article is compatible with a system in which tort liability is im- posed only where a particular tort has been committed. Indeed, all of the French authors in the first half of the nineteenth century and many thereafter have thought that Article 1382 contains the kind of solution which the German Civil Code adopted later in Section 823. Section 823 limits liability to cases in which "absolute rights" of the victim have been violated. The "absolute rights" of the German Civil Code include, for example, life, health, and freedom of movement. That Article 1382 does not establish liability for any damage whatsoever that is done through fault is particularly clear in the work of German interpreters of the French Civil Code or French au- thors influenced by German thought. According to Zachariae,29 "tort in the sense of the civil law is an act by which, intentionally or negligently, the rights of another person are unlawfully injured." The same definition may be found in Aubry and Rau through the fourth edition of their treatise which first appeared as a translation from the work on the French Code of the German scholar Zachariae.30 Later editions contain the opposite formula which pro- vides for liability wherever there is fault but that is the result of "up-dating" by Bartin and Esmein. The fact that they found it nec- essary to make such a change shows that the change was conscious and voluntary. As far as the nineteenth century is concerned, the definition of Toullier3e is even more typical than that of Zachariae. This author, who is no longer fashionable in France, gave a restrictive interpreta- tion of Article 1382. He wishes to avoid the risk that lawful behav- ior would be deemed to fall within the article as, for example, when an owner blocks the light and view of his neighbor without violating his neighbor's easement. According to the formula proposed by Toullier, therefore, Article 1382 applies to actions that cause damage unless the actor is exercising a right. The "right of freedom" con- sists in doing everything that is not specifically prohibited by some other rule of law. Thus liability presupposes violation of some rule of law protecting the victim other than Article 1382. The same idea is found, albeit with a progressive decrease in clarity, in Laurent and Planiol and even in Demolombe. 29. Droit civil franqais, various eds., ? 444. 30.

It was recog- nized that the defendant may be liable even when it is difficult to identify an injury to the right of the plaintiff, as in cases of unfair competition, seduction, misleading information, or entering into a void contract. It is interesting to see how Laurent reacted to this new climate. He was an alert observer of the case law as it was in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. According to him, liability could only rest on injury to a right: Every civil injury is a tort according to the provision of Ar- ticle 1382. The principle is clear but its application is not without difficulties. First, there must be a right, but rights, like obligations, arise only under statute and through agree- ment. It is therefore necessary that a right founded on stat- ute or agreement be injured. Only then is there a tort or a quasi-tort as the aim of Article 1382 is simply to safeguard the rights of men in civilized society granting them an ac- tion against whoever injures them. One must be careful to avoid thinking that the injury consists in the damage caused by an act. The damage is only one element of the tort, and it is not sufficient in itself. A right must be injured.32 Yet this definition is watered down by the way in which Lau- rent and others apply it. Indeed, the applications are ultimately in conflict with the definition itself. The attempt to find a right vio- lated results in some curious configurations. For example, one who by false allegations prevents a father from acknowledging his illegit- imate child is said to have violated the child's right to be acknowl- edged. One who prevents another from making a will or destroys the will is said to have violated that person's right to make the will. In other cases, there is no statute safeguarding the right that suppos- edly has been violated. Consequently, liability is said to arise be- cause of the abuse of a right as in cases of the confusion caused by similar trademarks, unfair competition in general, and abuse of pro- cess.33 But such contrivances do not always suffice. Such an ap- proach prudently omits any reference to an injured right in order to agree with the case law which grants an action for seduction under promise of marriage, misleading statements that procure credit for the insolvent, mendacious trade references, and the insertion of an individual who has no debts on a list of insolvent debtors. Nevertheless, these initial breaches in the system may be re- 32. Op. cit., nn. 405, 406, 497, 500, 412, 511. 33.

To do so, one must develop new types of torts or categories of the violation of a right which can then be added to the old ones. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Planiol seems, albeit with circumspection, to have moved toward the idea that only cer- tain types of torts are actionable. Indeed, he seems to have believed that the difference between Article 1382 and Section 823 of the Ger- man Civil Code is purely formal: The expression tout fait quelconque is too vague a limita- tion on the requirement of fault. Not any act will do, but an act defined by its illegitimate character. This basic idea is only hinted at in the French Code. The German Code, on the contrary, says with precision: "He who injures another person unlawfully" (Article 823). For Planiol, Article 1382 creates sanctions but does not create new duties: It is fairly easy to make an outline of the number of con- tractual obligations and their object.... Delictual obliga- tions are not the same. It is said at every turn that an individual is liable for his fault by virtue of Article 1382. That is true in a certain sense, because it is this article that obligates a person at fault to repair the consequences. Nev- ertheless, this text only provides a sanction. It is for tort what Article 1142 is for contract.... In itself, it mentions no particular obligations.... It is impossible to conceive of fault if there were no prior obligation to act or to abstain.3 Nevertheless, other statements by the same author seem to empty these of all meaning. They suggest that there is a general duty to abstain from any act which requires ability or power that the individual does not possess. When he introduces this general liabil- ity for unskillfulness, Planiol makes his true thought hard to inter- pret. In my view, Planiol's ideas are clarified only by his subsequent analysis of damage. Here his premise is that "the nature of damage is of little importance. It always gives rise to liability provided it is real and proven." Then, in his illustrations, he is very careful to choose only instances of damage in which there is also an injury to a right of an individual. He regards unfair competition as involving such an injury. He then discusses injuries to health and life, treat- ing contagion as such an injury in conformity with recent develop- ments in the case law. Again following developments in the case law, he treats injury to honor in the same way as seduction. In or- der to justify liability to the relatives of the victim, he develops a special category: injury to family concerns. Along with infringe- 34. Nuisances are considered as negligent torts. Plainol treats them as abuses of rights while he could have classed them as injuries to property.</page><page sequence="20">362 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 ment of rights, he treats the abuse of rights in which, however, he finds a psychological element different than fault.35 The ambigi'ties in Planiol did not pass without comment. Demogue criticized him for confusing the part (negligence) with the whole (fault)."6 Demogue believed that side by side with the subjec- tive element of negligence, there was an objective element, a civil in- jury. In truth, however, Demogue's notion of a civil injury is elusive: We must note that the limit of a person's rights is no simple matter. It sometimes has an objective aspects, sometimes subjective.... Sometimes the breadth of the right varies with the circumstances in which it is exercised, sometimes with the persons against whom the right is asserted. Under certain circumstances, the right is extinguished. Sometimes a person has a more extensive right because he exercises it in furtherance of a social interest. Sometimes he has a right protected against only one type of interference. Again, cus- toms can influence the limit of rights.37 In the second quarter of the twentieth century, the theory that only certain types of torts are actionable entered into a critical phase. Even in new editions of old works, authors eliminated refer- ences to the violation of rights38 Nevertheless, an explanation still had to be made of why so many human acts that cause harm do not give rise to liability. One cannot answer saying that whoever exer- cises a right does not act unlawfully. Indeed, this idea eventually be- came the butt of serious criticism. Scholars realized that it led to emptying Article 1382 of any content. Thus, as Colin and Capitant observed: Is it not possible to say that every act of man not ex- pressly prohibited by law constitutes the exercise of a right? The very acts of coming and going, of hunting, of moving around ... appear to be emanations of those general rights called public rights, or, in the past, the rights of man. Now it is precisely in the performance of such acts that torts to others are most often committed ... hence, whether we are dealing with rights specifically granted to each individual or 35.

If he fails to do so, he is liable for his actions.39 Faced with this convincing logic, the only thing to do was to ex- plain liability in a different way. The doctrine found in the manuals seemed to entrench itself behind a distinction between exercising a general right and exercising specific rights. In the latter case the person who causes damage is supposed to have a defense.40 Never- theless, this solution cannot survive the criticism that scholars have aimed at the idea that a person cannot commit a tort if he is exercis- ing a right. The exercise of a specific right may also give rise to lia- bility. As Savatier said, "The damage caused by a wrongdoer with the assistance of his own property is no more lawful than the dam- age he causes with the assistance of an object of which he is not the owner."41 Therefore, to find an explanation of liability we must again look elsewhere. In doing so, scholars have found they must abandon the concep- tual procedure that explains "tort" by the concept of "unlawfulness" and "lawfulness" as "the exercise of a right." Scholars have turned to induction, examining the case law to obtain more or less general rules. They have acknowledged that the law cannot arrive at a gen- eral explanation. Indeed, Esmein has even said: According to the civil code, one who causes damage to others through fault must pay compensation. It is therefore the duty of the judge to say which acts are blameworthy be- yond those in which a statute itself condemns an act either expressly or by providing a civil or crimrinal sanction.... It is striking that the judge should have such power in an area in which a code is in force. Although it has been said that there is a general duty in France not to harm others.... This statement ... is not perfectly correct, since in numerous cases one can harm others voluntarily.42 39.

The analogous stand by Maurice Colin and Henri Capitant, op. and loc. cit. is more tiresome but just as sure. The theory is introduced into the work of Marcel Planiol by following editors (see ed; 1952, edited by Paul Esmein and Jean Boulanger, II, n. 984). 40. Rene Savatier, Traite, cit., n. 38, p. 52.

Rene Savatier, op. and loc. cit., p. 49, n. 36.</page><page sequence="22">364 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 These considerations have led jurists to ask why conduct is or is not actionable. According to Savatier, the reasons: "emerge, when statutes are silent, from the necessities of social life: for example, the right to express one's own thought, the right to protect property or other rights one le- gitimately claims even to the detriment of others, rights of competition and neighborhood relations. The exercise of all these rights may harm others. When the legislator inter- venes, he generally does so to codify a particular instance in which a right such as these has already been acknowledged."43 He describes separately each particular justification to explain instances in which conduct does not give rise to liability. One of the most important justifications is the "inevitable parallelism of human activities" which justifies fair competition in similar activities." By developing justifications such as these, it may be possible to absolve a person who causes harm without abandoning the principle that, in general, one owes compensation for the harm that one does. The prohibition on causing damage to another is presented as the general rule and the instances in which one is free to cause harm are exceptions. In this way, attention is shifted from the legal status of the victim to the behavior of the person who harms him. This at- titude is still fashionable in French doctrine. In this approach, moreover, the element of injury is wholy absorbed by that of faute. The faute is a violation of a duty such as the use of diligence which is not supposed to depend upon the status of the victim.45 One could criticize the definitions of Toullier, Zachariae, or Laurent for meddling with the text of Article 1382 by introducing the "objective" element of unlawfulness. Yet their definitions are probably no more arbitrary than the interpretation currently fash- ionable which excludes any liability if one can find a justification for the activity of the person causing harm. Article 1382 is therefore compatible with two opposite formulas, one restrictive and the other very broad. These formulas, it would 43. Rene Savatier, op. and loc. cit., n. 37.

On the other hand, albeit referring to lawful earnings, certain interests are not protected, either because they are counter- balanced by interests judged to be more important for society, such as the case of damage caused by lawful competition, or because they cannot be fully safeguarded, and because anyone suffering an injury to them has the advantage of being able to inflict the same inconvenience upon others, as in the case of reasonable disturbances of neighbourhood." 44.

By so doing not proceeding much differently from the supporters of the in- terpretation of Toullier in the XIXth century France. See supra.</page><page sequence="23">1991] LEGAL FORMANIS 365 seem, could lead courts to act in two opposite ways: to impose liabil- ity whenever harm is done, or to impose liability only in exceptional cases. C. The German and Italian Solutions While French authors begin with a text that suggests any dam- ages compensable, German interpreters begin with one that envi- sions liability only for injuries to certain rights. According to ? 823 of the German Civil Code, individuals are not liable unless they in- tentionally or negligently injure "the life, body, health, freedom, property or similar right" of the victim. Types of injuries such as se- duction or misleading information are dealt with other sections of the code. Finally, ? 826 imposes liability on anyone who intention- ally causes harm to another in a way that is deemed to be immoral. Thus liability requires something more than fault: Either, objec- tively, injury to a specific right, or, subjectively, the intention to do wrong. The importance the German law assigns to the intention to do wrong seems, in principle, incompatible with French law which ignores the distinction between intentional wrong and simple negligence. These differences in principle between the French and German systems lead us to look to the case law of the two countries to iden- tify instances in which a person would be liable in France but not in Germany. Given the difference in the statutory rules, one would ex- pect to find such differences at every step. Neverethelss, one does not. In fact, there is a surprising parallelism. Towards the end of the last century, French courts imposed lia- bility for making a void contract, for seduction, for misleading infor- mation, for unfair competition, and so forth. As a result, French jurists could not help but break with their traditional view. The courts in Germany, at the same time, felt the need to impose liabil- ity in the same types of cases. In Germany, however, abandonment of the traditional formula was not necessary to the same extent. The legislator, in drafting the code, was able to enumerate the cases in which liability would be imposed. The recognition of these new torts was not hindered in Germany by the principle that there must be a violation of the right of another. German law does require the violation of such a right but the interpreter can always add new rights to the traditional set, rights, for example, such as the right to the goodwill of a business.46 If there is no injury to a specifically protected right, there is no tort except in the case of intentional wrong. Nevertheless, the textbooks speak of cases in which the 46. Filippo Ranieri, "La responsabilitV da false informazioni," in Giur. comm (1976) I, 630.</page><page sequence="24">366 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 Reichsgeqricht has imposed liability for gross negligence. For exam- ple, a doctor was held liable when his negligence caused his patient to be declared to lack legal capacity. Cases involving misleading in- formation have been decided in a similar way.47 The operational rules are much the same in Germany and France also when the courts deal with the subjective element of fault. The French Civil Code does not distinguish whether fault is intentional or not whereas the German Civil Code emphasizes the distinction. Nevertheless the case law is similar. In France the judge imposes liability for intentional wrongdoing by first acknowl- edging that the wrongdoer has acted in the exercise of a right and then insisting that since he intended to do harm he has committed an abuse of right. This pattern of reasoning, expressed in various ways, has allowed the French courts to reach results like those of the German. It has been used to impose liability for unfair competi- tion, abuse of process, intentional injury to exclusive contractual rights, which are the classic cases in which, in Germany, liability is imposed under ? 826. We have thus seen two different logical patterns. According to one, which works by addition, all injuries to a right plus all similar cases result in liability. According to the other, which works by sub- traction, all damages give rise to liability unless there is some de- fense. It should not seem clear that, by using this logic, any practical result may be justified. As concretely applied, therefore, the two patterns bring about similar results. Let us now consider Italy. Here the situation seems hybrid. The legislator does not expressly require the violation of a right for liability to be imposed but does characterize the damage as "unjust." (Article 2043, Civil Code). By failing to clarify this almost philo- sophical and vague idea of "injustice" he grants the judge true dis- cretionary power. The Italian judge, however, does not exploit this power. During his training at the University, he has learned the two formulas just mentioned, the one imposing liability only where there is injury to a right, and the other imposing liability when any- one is injured. He himself, follows the rule of minaimum effort: he applies the narrower rule when he does not impose liability and the broader rule when he does.48 47.

The Situation in England and the United States49 In England and the United States, until recently, liability was imposed only in rigidly delimited types of torts. The type of conduct and injury that gave rise to liability varied from one type of tort to another. Trespass required that one interfere with the property of the victim, conversion required that one behave as the owner of an- other's property, nuisance required that one interfere with the use of property, and so forth. No relief was available for wrongs that did not belong to one of the recognized types. Towards the end of the last century, something changed. "Neg- ligence" came to be recognized as a tort. Remedies for negligence came to be given in areas in which, until then, liability had been based on other torts such as trespass, conversion, nuisance, and so forth. (When this evolution was completed, an action for negligence had become the most frequent remedy in the area of extra contrac- tual liability.) The elements of an action for negligence are four: (a) a duty of care, (b) a violation of this duty (c) a harm (d) which is caused prox- imately by the violation. The requirements that there be a violation of the duty of care, harm, and causation, correspond to the familiar continental requirements that there be negligence, harm, and causa- tion. Liability is imposed in English and American law if these ele- ments are established and the defendant was under a duty to act with care. At first, the duty to act with care was rather restricted. That is to say, there was no general principle of liability for negligence.-l With the passing of time, the range of acknowledged duties of care increased. Jurists and courts began to speak of an implied duty of care owed by anyone performing any activity that might cause harm to others.5' In some cases, as in France, liability was not imposed but the failure to do so was explained by a series of policy considera- tions. It would appear, then, that common law courts are not longer imposing liability according to the type of tort that has been commit- ted as they did in the last century. It would seem that they are ap- plying a general principle of liability for negligence like the ones we have seen in Continental Europe. 49. Lord Esher in Le Lievre v. Gould (1893), 1 Q.B. 491, 497: a man is entitled to be as negligent as he pleases towards the whole world if he owes no duty to them." 50. "The rule on the basis of which you must love your neighbour is sustained by law: you must not cause injury to your neighbour. And the jurist's question, "Who is my neighbour?", receives a precise answer: you must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which may reasonably be expected to cause injury to your neighbour." Lord Atkin in Donoghue v. Stevenson, 1932, A.C., 562, 580. 51. This does not mean that school definitions are more inclined to municipal and territorial specialization. See Pier Giuseppe Monateri, Legal Doctnne, cit.</page><page sequence="26">368 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 In reality, however, when we examine the case law we can see that this appearance is deceptive. An extension of liability has un- doubtedly taken place and may be seen in numerous cases in which it was once usual to deny relief on the grounds that there was no duty of care: For example, the liability of manufacturers, employ- ers, occupiers and owners of land, rescuers, trespassers, prenatal in- juries and so forth. Yet liability is imposed in well-defined contexts. First and foremost, it is generally imposed only when there has been physical injury to person or property, that is, in cases reminiscent of ? 823 of the German Civil Code. In the vast sector of purely eco- nomic loss, a remedy is given in only well-defined cases: For exam- ple, those concerning the liability of a professional, of an officer, of a subcontractor, and so forth.

First, where a general rule of liability has been adopted, as in England, America and France, so also have a series of exceptions to that rule. Thus, the case law and even the scholarly doctrine in these countries is considerably closer than one might expect to the situation that prevails when liability is imposed only for particular types of tort. German doctrine, as the chart shows, is an agreement with the German Civil Code. To understand to scope of the Code, it is necessary to read not only ?? 823 and 826 but the entire chapter devoted to extra contractual liability. We can then see that there is a split in the Code between overall definitions, on the one hand, and particular rules, on the other. The particular rules afford protection to any legislatively protected interest. Finally, in Italy, scholarly opinion is divided between those who speak of types of damage which give rise to liability, thus moving</page><page sequence="27">1991] LEGAL FORMANIS 369 toward the German position, and those who adopt a general rule of liability and then recognize particular exceptions, as do the French. Our conclusion, then, is that one can see transnational operational rules, and hence the existence of a uniform application of law throughout the West aside from a certain delay in the pace of evolution in Italy. This uniform law is at a midpoint between the scholarly formulas used in France, England and the United States, on the one hand, and in Germany, on the other. It is at a midpoint, that is, between a formula enunciating a general principle of liability and one founded upon particular types of injury. Comparing these results with those we have reached in our discussion of contract, we see a clear difference. In the area of tort liability, the strongest oppositions appear to be at the level of general definitions. The extreme positions are represented by general scholarly formulas and, a short distance behind, by overall legislative rules in France and Germany, whereas, moving toward "midfield," we find the more specific statutory formulations, the detailed scholarly solutions, and, finally, the operational rules applied by courts. These findings do not confirm the hypothesis we suggested after our discussion of contract law: that like legal formats of different legal systems tend to resemble one another more than they resemble unlike legal formants of the same system. There is, however, a similarity in our findings as to both contracts and torts. In both cases, the overall definitions generalize a rule instead of limiting its application. A contract would always appear to be formed by the consent of both parties; damage would seem to be always compensable, or liability to be always dependent to a right. The operative rules, in contrast, are more articulated.52 Our findings thus confirm the belief, rather common among persons acquainted with law, that scholarly doctrines and general formulas are often too "abstract" (that is, too prone to make unauthorized generalizations) and too "far from life" (that is, too prone to forget the significance of some elements of the concrete case). Finally, we can see reconfirmed one of our observations on French legal thought. The French definition of tort uses two terms (negligence and harm) rather than three (negligence, wrongfulness, and harm). Here, as we have seen earlier, French definitions "simplify" their analysis of a legal concept. Thus, as we have seen, the French will speak of "will" instead of "will and its outward manifestation" in their discussions of contract.53 52.

A FINAL APPLICATION: THE TRANSFER OF MOVABLE PROPERTY A. The ProblemM A final problem we will examine is the transfer of movable property. The elements required by various legal systems are three: (1) consent, (2) "cause" which is an element that explains why con- sent was given or should be respected, and the (3) delivery of the property accompanied by the will to transfer it. To transfer movable property, each system might require only one element (consent alone or delivery of the property alone) or more than one element (consent and delivery, or consent and cause). To begin with, we may observe a contrast between the Roman and the Italian rules. In Roman law property is transferred by de- livery (traditio) coupled with the will to alienate the property (with only a minimal imbalance of causa). Under Italian law property is transferred where there is consent coupled with cause. In order to understand the revolution that occurred we must look to period of the ius commune when Roman law was in force throughout Europe. During this period, a greater significance was accorded to the presence of "cause." Consequently the requirements for a transfer of property were thought to be, not mere delivery with an intent to alienate, as in the original Roman system, but as a valid contract (titulus) plus delivery (modus). B. From Medieval Roman Law to the French and Italian Solutions A further change then took place in France. Its result appears explicitly in Article 1138 of the French Civil Code: "The obligation to transfer a thing is perfected by the consent of the contracting par- ties alone. It makes the creditor the property owner even though delivery has not been made..... This provision requires a series of determinees par acte entre vifs," in Riv. dir. civ., 1979, I, 442 ff., and in General Reports to the 10th international congress of comparative law, Budapest, 1981, 247. Here wide bibliography works which provide the materials for the following discussion are: Frederik Vinding Kruse, "What Does Transfer of Property Mean with Regards to Chattels? A Study in Comparative Law," Am. J. Comp. L. 500 (1958); Michel Waelbroeck, Le transfert de la prpiete dans la vente dobjets mobiliers corporels en droit compare (1961); Georges Sauveplanne, "The protection of the bona fide purchaser of corporeal movables in Comparative Law," Rabels, 29 (1965) 651; Ernst von Caemmerer, "Rechtsvergleichung und Reform der Fahrnisubereignunging," Rabelsz, 12 (1938-39) 675 ff.; Samuel Williston, 7he Law Governing Sales of Goods at Common Law and Under the Uniform Sales Act (rev. ed. 1968). 54. For further details, see Pier Giuseppe Monateri, La sineddoche, cit. Art. 1376 makes use of the usual synecdoche: it speaks of consent, but what it means is contract (i.e. consent + cause).</page><page sequence="29">1991] LEGAL FORMANTS 371 qualifications. First of all, the word consent (consentement) is equivocal. A careless reader might think the law means that a pure meeting of the minds will transfer property even without an ele- ment, cause, explaiIning why consent was given or should be respected. Indeed, in general declamatory statements, French schol- ars usually speak of the autonomous and sovereign will as the neces- sary and sufficient condition of property to be transferred. A more careful analysis reveals that here, as in Article 1101, the legislator has had recourse to a synecdoche: he has used a part to stand for the whole. Although he spoke of mere consent, he intended to refer to a contract, that is, to consent given for a valid "cause."55 Let us now observe that the legislator in Article 1138 has adopted an unusual legislative technique. He has not merely listed the elements necessary to transfer property. He has pointed out that a delivery is not necessary. We can see why he did so when we remember that in France, before the Code, the law theoretically re- quired delivery (traditio) based on the "cause" or reason why deliv- ery should transfer property (titulus). Superimposed on this rule was the practice, widespread in the Middle Ages, of dispensing with the physical transfer of property and accepting, as a substitute, an agreement by which the transferor, who had not parted with the property, nevertheless recognized the transferee as its possessor. This strategem, devised and suggested first in Italy by Rolandino de' Passeggeri was widely applied in France. Indeed, in sales and dona- tions, French 18th century jurists considered such an agreement to be implied even when it was omitted. Let us now consider two other articles of the French Civil Code: Article 1583 and Article 938. According to the first, a sale "is perfect between the parties and the property is acquired by right by the pur- chaser from the seller at the moment there is agreement as to the thing and the price even if the thing has not been delivered nor the price paid." According to the second, "a duly accepted donation is effective upon consent of the parties alone, and the property in the object is transferred to the donee without need of other delivery." the reference to "other delivery" suggests that, in the drafters' mind, there has already been a first delivery. Presumably they meant the "presumed" delivery of which they were accustomed to speak. When we read these provisions together with Article 1138, we arrive at the following procedure for transferring property. The consent of the parties, meaning consent and "cause," creates an obli- gation to transfer (obligation de livrer) which the law then declares to be perfect (parfaite) or already accomplished so that the person 55. The topic is well covered in Silvia Ferreri, Le azioni reipersecutorie in dir- itto comparato (1988).</page><page sequence="30">372 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 to whom this obligation is owed immediately becomes the owner. Strictly speaking, the transfer of property is not produced immedi- ately by consent but is produced by the intervention of the legislator who declares the obligation to transfer property to be extinct at the very moment in which it is born. Italy inherited the mutual consent solution from France by way of the Sardinian Code (art. 1229). The Italian Civil Code of 1865, art. 1125, extended the scope of the solution by providing that the acqui- sition of a right in rem is the result of a "convention" and not of an "obligation to give." The current civil code expressly provides that a contract may produce rights in rem as well as obligations (art. 1321) and that ". .. property ... is conveyed ... as a result of legitimately manifested consent" (art. 1376). C. From the Medieval Roman Law to the German and Austrian Civil Codes The German system was profoundly affected by the teaching of Savigny. Using as an example the giving of alms to a beggar, he taught that two elements were essential for a transfer of property: the will of both parties that property be transferred, and delivery. The first element may be called "contract" if by that term we mean a pure meeting of the minds, not a contract supported by causa. "Contract," in this sense, does not correspond, therefore, to the titulus of the medieval Roman law. The absence of a causa does not prevent the transfer of property and is important only because it may give rise for an action for unjust enrichment by the party who is paid without a justification. Thus delivery is a crucial element, the "modus" of the Medieval Roman law. Before delivery, in the case of alms, there is nothing, not even an obligation to transfer property, and after it the property has already been conveyed. Savigny's solution dominated German doctrine and was adopted by the German Civil Code (Section 929 ff.) which provides that the necessary and sufficient conditions for transferring personal prop- erty are the will of the parties to do so and delivery. If the person transferring property did so without a justification, if, for example, he delivered as part of a void contract which he believed to be valid, he will be protected by an action for unjust enrichment. Thus, in contrast to France, where the medieval Roman law was simplified by eliminating the requirement of modus, in Germany, it was simpli- fied by eliminating the requirement of titulus. Austria codified before Savigny's solution spread. The legislator therefore remained faithful to the medieval Roman law which re- quired both titulus and modus. These requirements are expressly stated in ?? 425-26 of the Austrian Civil Code. Thus, while the</page><page sequence="31">1991] LEGAL FORMANTS 373 French Code Civil retained the ideal of titulus, and the German Civil Code the idea of modus, the Austrians retained both requirements. D. The English System These solutions do not exhaust all possible combinations of the elements we have isolated. Another possibility is to allow the par- ties to choose between the use of a system based on consent (with a justification) and one based on delivery. In my view, the English system does so. Before examining this solution we should remem- ber that, in common law, personal property is protected by a number of different personal actions, rather than by a general action such as the continental rei vindicatio. Of these personal actions the most significant and similar to rei vindicatio is the action of conversion.m We may well suspect borrowing from abroad when we find, in the pages in which English jurists discuss the conveyance of prop- erty, an insistence that property is transferred by the will of the par- ties because of the respect due to their will. This phrase must not deceive us. The will necessary to transfer property between the par- ties must be expressed in a contract which must be accompanied by consideration. Moreover, the contract transfers property only be- tween the parties themselves. That is the rule of the traditional common law as expressed in the Sale of Goods Act of 1893 reenacted on various occasions, most recently in 1979. The contract of sale transfers property at the moment set by the parties. When the con- tract has been entered into and payment made, delivery is necessary to make the transfer effective for all purposes. E. From Overall Rules to Applications If the Austrian rule requiring both titulus and modus were rig- orously applied, a person who has delivered property without titu- lus, that is, without an underlying causa or justification, should have not only an action for unjust enrichment but an action to reclaim the property since property rights could not pass by delivery alone. However, the rules of the Austrian Code that concern unjust enrich- ment deny an action to a person who has delivered property and was not in error about the validity of the titulus. Scholars consider it certain that because there is no action for unjust enrichment there cannot be an action to reclaim the property, or to put it another way, delivery that takes place without a causa yet without error will transfer the property. 56. In Austrian law, differently than in Italian law, the "manual gift" does not find limits of value.</page><page sequence="32">374 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 Austrian scholars have pointed out this consequence, and, conse- quently, Savigny's theories have enjoyed a certain popularity in Aus- tria. Although the general rule requires both titulus and modus, specific rules such as the one just mentioned treat modus alone as sufficient. Nevertheless, the Austrian system is still different than the German. In Germany, delivery will transfer property, even if the person making delivery is mistaken as to the validity of the titu- lus. Awareness of this difference has led Austrian scholars to move away from Savigny's thesis and to see a donation in a delivery made without error but without any preexisting obligation.57 Today, scholars tend to see any lawful intention as a causa of the delivery and not merely the intention to satisfy a preexisting obligation. Ac- cording to that view, consequently, modus must be accompanied by a causa is taken to mean any lawful intention. The Austrian system may, therefore, be placed in an intermediate position between a sys- tem that requires modus alone and a system that requires both titu- lus and modus. Austria is not the only country in which we can see a change when we move from the rule that is generally stated to the opera- tional rule. A more important transformation is found in France. We have already seen instances in which jurists "simplify" their statement of French law by leaving out an element: for example, they discuss contract formation by speaking of the will of the parties rather than will plus a "cause"; they discuss the transfer of property by speaking of the will of the parties without mentioning the obligation to trans- fer property. We will now examine a still more important yet little studied instance of this phenomenon.58 According to Articles 1235 and 1376 of the French Civil Code, a person can recover a payment he made when the payment was not due because there was no debt to be paid. "Every payment presup- poses a debt; whatever has been paid that was not owed can be re- covered." Despite the statutory text, however, French jurists have continued to follow the Roman rule in which recovery is possible only if the person making the payment was in error.59 It seems ob- vious to the French that, as a consequence, a person who was not in error cannot claim to be the owner of an object he has delivered in payment or bring an action, as owner, to recover that object. Thus, the French jurists conclude, that the person delivering the object in 57. On this rotation, Rodolfo Sacco, "Un cryptotype en droit fran9ais: lahremise abstraite?" in Etudes Rodiemre, 1981, p. 273 ff. 58. If the solvens brings against the accipiens an action en nullite, the pro- nouncement of voidness of the contract might bear restitution with it. 59. Anyone who considers as a purely personal action that for restitution after error should conclude that, as in Germany, the delivery is abstract.</page><page sequence="33">1991] LEGAL FORMANTS 375 payment has lost ownership of the property, in other words, that his delivery of the object has transferred ownership. In France, there- fore, whoever delivers an object in payment, knowing that there is no debt to extinguish, transfers ownership. Article 931 of the French Civil Code requires notarization for a donation to be effective. Yet the French jurists have always recog- nized that a donation is effective once delivery has been made. This conclusion reenforces the opinion just mentioned that one cannot re- claim a payment that was not owed unless one was mistaken. Who- ever pays what is not owed, knowing that he owes nothing, is considered a donor. In France, as in other countries, one who pays to fulfill a natu- ral obligation cannot reclaim what he has paid. In practice, any de- livery made with the intention of transferring ownership will be made either out of a sense of duty, and so be treated as a payment to fulfill a natural obligation, or out of liberality, and will be treated as a donation accompanied by delivery. In either case, ownership will be transferred by delivery. A remedy will be available, however, if the person making payment was in error. We can conclude that the French solution is similar to the one we found in Austria.60 We can also say that in France, a person who wishes to alienate property has his choice between entering into a contract with a cause and deliver- ing the property without error intending to alienate it. In Germany, as well, the law as applied differs from the law in the Code. The law in the Code centers on modus. In practice, how- ever, ownership can pass through an agreement, the possessory ac- cord, which takes the place of delivery. Moreover, delivery can be made subject to a condition-even a tacit condition-that it will not transfer ownership if the underlying contract is ineffective. In Austria, Germany and France ways have been found to trans- form the general rule. In England, ways have been found to prevent the general rule from being applied. There was no absolute necessity for these changes to occur. In Holland, Switzerland and Turkey, the solution of the Austrian Code is in force in which both modus and titulus are required. In Switzer- land, payment of what is not due made without error is held to transfer ownership, as in Austria, but in Holland and Turkey, on the 60. Stock v. Wilson, 1913, 2 KB, 235, 246, and Geoffrey C. Cheshire and Cecil H. Fifoot, Cases in the Law of Contract (1977). Here the problem of the absolute or rel- ative nature of English movable property as is of marginal importance. Silvia Fer- reri, op. cit., pp. 151 and ff. for the period in which Stock v. Wilson was judged, and for the present moment). An equitable interest of a third party may indeed be pres- ent aside of the property we are talking about. But we may overlook this for our purposes.</page><page sequence="34">376 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 contrary, this solution has been rejected because it has been deemed to conflict with the rule requiring titulus. The Italian solution is like the French, except that the require- ment of titulus for ownership to pass has been retained except for modest concessions in the case of executed donations and the fulfill- ment of natural obligations. In English law, the doctrinal formulas do not acknowledge the rule that the courts actually apply. The Sale of Goods Act does not provide for the case in which an object is delivered which is not owed pursuant to a contract. The effect of delivery was not clear until 1913, when it was held in Stock v. Wilson that ownership is transferred by delivery accompanied by an intent to transfer owner- ship, even if the delivery is made through the error of a person who wrongly believes he is obliged to deliver.61 In that case the person making delivery brought an action of conversion, an action that lies against someone who finds himself accidentally in possession of a thing without title to it. When the adverse party claimed title through delivery, he argued that delivery creates but does not justify possession and hence does not give title. The court rejected this claim, stating that delivery creates a title in the person who takes delivery.62 Thus, in England, we find both a system based on con- tract and a system based on delivery with the intent to transfer own- ership. A person may choose between the two systems as he can in France but in England delivery seems to have greater effect in that it can transfer ownership even in the case of mistake. The English system thus resembles the German in always requiring delivery in order to make the passage of property valid in front of every third party. F. A Graphical Summary These conclusions can be represented graphically, although a few words of explanation are needed. The rule that delivery alone is necessary to transfer ownership has an element in common with the rule that demands both modus and titulus. It also has an element in common with the rule that gives the transferor an option between delivery and entering into a contract. The rule that demands both titulus and modus has an ele- ment in common with the rule that demands titulus alone; it has an element in common with the rule that demands modus alone. The 61. Of course the deliverer may act with a different action in order to obtain the "restitution." On the absoluteness of the title, see the previous note. 62. Detailed considerations as to this phenomenon are found in Benjamin L. Whorf, Language, Thought and Reality (1956). I borrowed the term "cryptotype" from him.</page><page sequence="35">1991] LEGAL FORMANTS 377 rule that demands titulus alone has an element in common with the rule that demands titulus and modus; it has an element in common with the rule that gives the transferor the alternative just described. The rule that gives the transferor this alternative has something in common with the rule that demands titulus alone and with the rule that demands modus alone. On the other hand, the rule that re- quires both titulus and modus is opposed to the rule that gives the transferor the alternative. The rule that requires modus alone is op- posed to the rule that requires titulus alone. These similarities and oppositions can be plotted around the cir- cumference of a circle. If we place the rule that requires modus alone at due north (marked m), we can then place the rule that re- quires titulus alone at the south (marked t). The rule that gives the transferor the alternative (marked a) can then be placed in the west and the rule that requires titulus and modus (marked b for both) at the east. Point e, intermediate between m and b, can then represent the system which, in principle, requires both titulus and modus but in practice acknowledges the sufficiency of delivery provided there is no error. Point i, intermediate between t and a, can then repre- sent the system that in principle demands titulus but in practice also acknowledges the sufficiency of delivery provided there is no error. We could then place a point v equally distant from all others de- scribed and, hence, in the center of the circle to represent the horta- tory statements that the will alone transfers ownership. The pattern will therefore be as follows: m a v b t Thus, in this graphic representation, the German solution is rep- resented by point m, the Austrian solution by point b, the French</page><page sequence="36">378 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 solution by point t. If we consider the effects between the parties, the English solution belongs at point t, but if we consider the effects on non-parties it belongs at point c. A statement that is found everywhere and followed nowhere is represented by point b. The formulas we have been speaking about may or may not cor- respond to the operational rules actually enforced in these countries. We must, therefore, consider the possibility that they do not. G. General Formulas and Operational Rules History seems to delight in continually replacing one system with another. The solution of medieval Roman law has given rise to many variants and has left its traces in the Scottish, Austrian and Argentine systems, to name just a few. The changes are usually movements around the circumference we have plotted. Sometimes the movement goes clockwise, for example, from the medieval Ro- man law to the French Civil Code, and sometimes counter-clock- wise, for example, from the medieval Roman law to the German Civil Code. Now, however, we must consider contemporary history, and in particular, incongruities which exist at the same time within a given legal system and are due to the multiplicity of legal formants of that system. An example would be a lack of harmony between statute and the law as applied or between operational rules and the formulas which jurists have deemed to describe those operational rules. The aim of the student of comparative law is to determine whether these instances of disharmony follow predictable and ra- tionally explicable patterns. Three interesting contrasts are those between statute and the law as applied, the law as applied and the law as described, and be- tween the situation the law deems to be normal and the situation that is normal in a sociological sense. These three contrasts give rise to incongruities that one can find in France, Germany, the low coun- tries, Switzerland, Hungary and England. In France, the Code contains a variant of the solution repre- sented by point t: the transfer of ownership depends upon the will to obligate oneself, the only exception being in the field of dona- tions. Scholarly doctrine, in contrast, identifies the contractual will and its effects: it requires only a will to transfer property. The case law permits transfer of ownership by delivery as long as the trans- feror is not in error. The scholars seem unaware of this lack of harmony. The incongruity, then, works in two directions. The shift from the Code to the case law goes form t to i. The shift from the case law to the law as taught by French jurists goes form i to t and from t to v.</page><page sequence="37">1991] LEGAL FORMANTS 379 We can also find historical examples in which the model repre- sented by point t has been displaced in favor of that represented by point b. After the Italian Code of 1865 was enacted, interpreters moved in two directions. Some followed the French toward a system in which there is an alternative between transferring ownership by contract and by delivery. Others return to the past by postponing the transfer of ownership until delivery, thus requiring both titulus and modus. In Russia under the Svod Zakonov, the solution borrowed from France, represented by point t, was shifted by interpreters toward that of point b. The GK] [RSFSR of 1922, which required titulus only, was replaced by the Osnovy of 1961, which, under the pressure of interpretation, was taken to require both titulus and modus. In Austria, a system one could represent at a point half-way be- tween b and e gave rise to different scholarly formulations of doc- trine that one can locate at points b and m. Here, as usual, the scholars moved toward the least vague solutions. In England, one finds considerable variety. Ownership passes by contract, equivalent to the civil law titulus, or, alternatively, by delivery, equivalent to the civil law modus. Nevertheless, jurists sometimes describe the system as though contract were always re- quired and sometimes they even speak of will in a pure form. Thus we find the solutions represented at points a, t, and v. Ownership, not only as between the parties but for all purposes, passes with de- livery, and yet jurists say that one needs both the contract and the delivery. Thus we find the solutions represented at points m and c. The Swiss and Dutch Codes are silent as to when ownership passes. Swiss and Dutch jurists, respectively, have chosen the posi- tions represented by points e and b. Germany still holds to the posi- tion that delivery alone passes ownership. Yet, in practice, the effect of the rule is often avoided by two mechanisms mentioned earlier: a condition is enforced which makes the effect of delivery depend on the validity of a contract (a solution that can be represented at points m or c), and a possessory accord is entered into which passes ownership without delivery (a position that can be represented at m or b). Should these two devices mash together, also German law could be seen as a system T. When titulus and modus are both required for the transfer of ownership, the relationship of these two elements has been ex- plained in various ways. The Austrians once placed both elements on the same level. They currently say that the transfer of owner- ship is effected by the agreement of the transferor and the trans- feree at the moment of delivery that ownership will pass, and that this agreement is the result of the prior contract which the parties</page><page sequence="38">380 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 fulfill when they pass ownership. The Swiss also explain the trans- fer of ownership as the effect of this prior contract. They regard de- livery, not as a contract, but as a physical act. The Socialists (for example, the Soviets, the Hungarians and the East Germans) have always given a similar explanation. They de- scribe the contract as the true cause of the transfer and explain de- livery as an indication of the moment at which the transfer takes place. It is not easy to say whether these different accounts explain the particular rules of the different systems or whether they simply depend upon theories favored by the jurists of the different coun- tries that have no implications for which rules are adopted. In the latter case, they would seem to be useless. In systems in which mere delivery transfers ownership, theo- rists still feel in need of an explanation. The effect of delivery seems to them to be an empirical proposition which they have to ex- plain from a dogmatic point of view. They have done so in various ways. Sometimes the concept of "abstraction" is invoked. "Abstraction" means, roughly speaking, that an act is effective without regard to the underlying transaction of which the act is a part. We have seen that Savingy fastened this solution on German law. A second explanation is based on donation. If the transferor has delivered a thing without being obliged to do so by some prior transaction and without erroneously believing he is obliged to do so, then he must have wished to make a gift. In Eng- lish law, this explanation is, so to speak, official. It has also found supporters in Austria and, within the limits the system allows, in France. It has been used along with other explanations in Switzer- land. A third explanation is that it is possible for a action to validate an earlier, albeit void, act. If someone delivers a thing without being obliged to do so, he is said to have validated a prior act. This expla- nation prevails in Argentina. Once again, then, the same phenome- non is explained in three different ways. Legal doctrine has missed an opportunity. It might have devel- oped conceptual categories capable of crossing the frontiers between one legal system and another. Actually, it has done quite the oppo- site. It has built frontiers within a single legal system, indeed fron- tiers that have no consequences for the operational rules. One can nevertheless discern a general tendency of scholarship: it favors general formulae, rules of great latitude, such as the points repre- sented by m, b, t, a and perhaps V. The study of comparative law can provide a corrective. To do so, it must begin with the opera- tional rule conceived in the narrowest way. Then it must gradually ascend toward general formulas and overall rules.</page><page sequence="39">1991] LEGAL FORMANTS 381 H. The Transfer of Ownership and the Attributes of the Owner We have spoken thus far as if the notion of transferring owner- ship had a precise meaning. We have noted the possibility of more than one meaning only in mentioning that the English distinguish transfer of ownership betwen the parties from transfer of ownership for all purposes. Yet transfer of ownership would have a single meaning only if all of the attributes of ownership were transferred simultaneously from one party to the other. The attributes of ownership, however, include: (1) the power to demand possession from the other party, (2) the power to demand possession from third parties who lack title, (3) the power to dispose of the thing in favor of third parties, (4) the right to whatever fruits the thing may produce, (5) the bearing of the risk of the destruction of the thing, (6) the right to guaranty one's debts by a security inter- est in the thing, (7) liability for damage caused by the thing to others, and so forth. We have to ask whether these various attrib- utes are transferred simultaneously or not. In any system, the buyer can demand possession from the seller as soon as the contract is made provided he is not late in paying the price. In a system in which the contract of sale transfers ownership, the buyer can demand possession because he is the owner. In a sys- tem in which the contract of sale does not have that effect, the buyer can demand possession because the seller is contractually obliged to give it to him. The consequences are the same even though they are described differently. If, instead, the buyer is late in making his payment, then even in a system in which ownership has been transferred to him the seller may stop the goods in transit or retain them and has a defense if he is sued for the goods by the buyer. Thus, when the buyer does not pay on time, his right to demand possession is not acquired at the moment that ownership is transferred. If the object is in the hands of a third party, one would expect that the buyer would have the right to claim it only if he has be- come the owner. There are numerous exceptions to this rule. In England, the buyer who has become the owner cannot bring actions of conversion or detinue unless he also has the right to possession. In Hungary, the buyer may sue for the object, although he is not yet the owner. In Germany, although the buyer is not yet the owner, he may proceed against the third party (at least if that party is in bad faith) by a delictual action for intentional wrongdoing under Section 826 of the German Civil Code, and his remedy in specific perform- ance can include recovery of the object. In some countries, property can be recovered by two different actions. One, known as "petitory"can be brought when a third party</page><page sequence="40">382 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 possesses an object without title. The other, known as "possessory," can be brought when the third party has obtained possession of the object unlawfully. A possessory action can only be brought by a per- son who himself had held possession lawfully, that is, by a person who had obtained the object by delivery. Thus, again, it makes little difference whether ownership is said to pass at the moment of deliv- ery or at the moment a contract is made. The buyer who has be- come owner but has never taken delivery cannot bring a possessory action. We find such a situation in Italy where a person can become owner without taking delivery. We do not find it in Germany where the buyer normally becomes owner upon delivery. We do not find it in France where possessory actions for personal property do not ex- ist. In Italy, in Germany and in Austria, a person who has taken de- livery pursuant to a contract can bring the possessory actions, and thus the rules are similar, even though the right to bring these ac- tions is not said to be an attribute of "ownership." In England and the United States, at common law, ownership is transferred in one way, while an equitable interest that amounts to a proprietary right is transferred in equity in another way entirely. The buyer's right to obtain a thing from a third party does not al- ways depend, therefore, on his becoming the owner at common law. In many systems ownership is transferred by delivery alone, even if a titulus is lacking. In others, transfer of ownership requires a valid underlying contract whether delivery is also required or not. We must remember, however, that when ownership has been ac- quired without titulus, there may be a right to sue the owner for un- just enrichment. Ownership that is subject to such an action may be very different from normal ownership. For example, the person en- titled to an action for unjust enrichment against the owner may also be entitled to an action against third parties who have obtained own- ership of the thing gratuitously or through fraud. We find this type of protection in Germany under Sections 812 and 826 Par. 1 of the Civil Code. Similar rights of action with respect to third parties are created by Article 1166 of the Code Napoleon and Article 2900 of the Italian Civil Code. Thus the distinction between acquliring owner- ship subject to an action for unjust enrichment and not acqutiring ownership at all may be quite small. One would expect, again, that the rules on the transfer of own- ership should govern the seller's ability to alienate the object to a third party. If the contract of sale, by itself, has transferred owner- ship to the buyer, one would expect the seller to be unable to sell to a third party. One would expect him to be able to do so if the con- tract has not transferred ownership to the buyer. Matters are actu- ally very different in all the countries we have discussed. Even the seller who is no longer the owner may sell to a third party if he de-</page><page sequence="41">1991] LEGAL FORMANTS 383 livers the object and the third party is in good faith. That is the rule in France and Italy, thanks to the the principle "possession counts as title" (Article 1141 of the French Civil Code; Article 1153 of the Ital- ian Civil Code). The same result is reached in England thanks to the presumption that the dishonest seller has acted as the buyer's agent. The same result is reached in Louisiana on the grounds that the sale has effect only "between the parties." Thus the conse- quences are the same as those in countries in which ownership is transferred only at the moment of delivery. Conversely, the seller who is still the owner is not always able to sell to a third party who knows of the first sale. In Hungary, for example, the second sale is void, as it is contrary to boni mores. In Germany, the third party is subject to an action for having commit- ted an intentional wrong, and the remedy may be that he must re- store the object to the first buyer. Thus the right to dispose of an object, the ius disponendi is not an exclusive attribute of ownership. Again, one might expect the risk of the destruction of an object would always be borne by the owner (res perit domino). It is not absurd, however, to imagine a system in which this risk is borne by the possessor who has custody of the object or by the buyer (casum sentit creditor). In reality, one can find systems in which the risk is borne by the buyer-owner even though he is not possessor. This is the solution in France (Article 1182 of the French Civil Code), Italy (Article 1465 of the Italian Civil Code) and England (Sale of Goods Act, Section 30ff). One can also find systems in which the buyer will only bear the risk when he receives ownership of the thing by deliv- ery. Examples are Germany (Section 446ff of the German Civil Code) and Austria (Section 1048 of the Austrian Civil Code). In Holland and Switzerland, however, the risk is transferred at the mo- ment the contract is made without waiting for a transfer of owner- ship. Under the Vienna Convention (United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, Article 69 (1980)) risks are transferred with delivery even if ownership has been trans- ferred in advance by consent. We can find still other similarities if we examine the right of the creditors of the seller to challenge the title acquired by the buyer, the right of the creditor of the buyer to challenge contracts that reserve ownership to the seller, the right of the creditors of the buyer to challenge the seller's right to rescind the contract for non-payment, and so forth. To what conclusions does this analysis lead us? An important one is that we will distort the rules of a system when we try to cap- ture them in a general proposition that states that ownership is transferred at this or that moment. In the systems we have ex- amined, these general formulas are extreme, in head-on conflict with one another, and without any point of contact. Through com-</page><page sequence="42">384 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 parison we can see how the knowledge each jurist has of his own system is deformed, how his attempt to explain his national law by a simple and extreme idea exaggerates the differences existing among various systems. Single operational rules that are uniform in the various sytems (e.g. protection of a second buyer in good faith who has received possession) are explained by doctrinal formulae that are very different. These different explanations have not been pro- duced by the necessities of legal science. They only do damage by concealing the uniformity of solutions and distorting the terms of comparison. The general formulae tend toward solutions that are extreme, unitary, and monist: for example, "ownership is trans- ferred at the moment of consent," or "ownership is transferred at the moment of delivery." The particular rules each system actually enforces find intermediate solutions between extremes. By distinguishing the legal formants of the system, the student of comparative law can find a predictable, if not a commendable, pattern. Doctrinal formulas that reflect the jurist's knowledge of his own system are general, abstract, extremist, and, in a certain sense of the word, rational. Operational rules are inconsistent, empiric and responsive to obscure unconscious underlying ideas, and in that sense, endowed with a rationality of their own. Abstract formulas also tend to be multiplied uselessly. The phenomenon we observe when property is delivered pursuant to an invalid contract is con- cealed behind five different theoretical formulations concerning the delivery of gifts, natural obligations, the confirmation of void agree- ments, the unavailability of an action to reclaim a payment once made, the abstractness of an act of execution. It is the duty of true legal scholarship to eliminate false conceptual contrasts, to investi- gate the significance of various operational rules, and on this basis to evaluate the differences that exist between various legal systems. X. THE CONTRIBUTION OF COMPARATIVE LAW TO LEGAL SCHOLARSHIP A. Cryptotypes The thesis I am about to put forward should now seem as obvi- ous as Columbus' egg. Of the legal formants we have considered, some are born explicitly formulated such as the formulas of scholars whereas others are not. As we have seen, those which are not can be immensely important. We shall describe them as "cryptotypes." Man continually follows rules of which he is not aware or which he would not be able to formulate well. Few would be able to for- mulate the linguistic rule we follow when we say "three dark suits" and not "three suits dark" whereas in special context we might speak of "the meadows green." How many cyclists would be able to</page><page sequence="43">1991] LEGAL FORMANTS 385 indicate the weight to exert on the pedal in performing various ma- neuvers on a bicycle? Linguists are now defining this phenomenon. We are subject to specific rules without perceiving them.63 Our visi- ble, superficial language is the result of identifiable transformations of latent linguistic patterns that are more permanent than the visi- ble ones. The recognition and study of these implicit rules is an important tendency in modern scholarship. Scholars in many fields now con- trast being governed by certain rules with knowing these rules.64 The scholarly endeavor is to reveal patterns which are implicit but have outward effects. The cryptotype, as we use the term, is the pat- tern to be revealed. Only comparative studies have the penetration that can make such implicit patterns known. We can now summarize our reason for making that claim. As long as we confine ourselves to the study of a single legal system, we will be forced or at least, we will be induced to try to capture its fea- tures in a synchronic systematic view. We will try to see statute, scholarly formula, proposals for change, the tradition of the schools, the arguments of judges, and the holdings of cases as compatible with one another. The study of domestic law does not allow us to reject completely the great optical illusion founded on the syn- chronic view. We do not reject it until we find in different legal sys- tems that identical statutes or scholarly formulas give rise to different applications, that identical applications are produced by different statutes or different scholarly formulas, and so forth. The discovery of legal formants diverging from the explicit formulations of a system leads us to the identification of cryptotypes. We realize we are in the presence of a non-verbalized rule when we see a deci- sion is made differently than the one we would envision from the rule as formulated. These implicit patterns play the fundamental 63. See Friedrich A. von Hayek, "Rules, Perception and Intelligibility," in Pro- ceedings of the British Academy, XLVIII, 1962. It is explained here how, human be- ings in their activity use mechanisms (linguistic, etc.) which are impossible to define explicitly: the opposition presented in the text is illustrated: and, more importantly, it is stressed that humans perceive such mechanisms and may transmit them, even though they are unable to define them with any degree of precision. The same au- thor, in Law, Legislation and Liberty, vol. 1, Rules and Order, (1973), defends the theory that law does not need to be conscious; that we imagine it as rational because of an anthropomorphic conception which reveals it to us as being planned by a mind. 64. We have already seen that a big difference between modern law (written, precedential or consuetudinary) and ethnic law lies in the fact that the former is (to a large extent!) conscious and verbalized -whereas the latter is not verbalized until the ethnologist intervenes from the outside. Ethnic law hence has, as a habitual fea- ture, a quality which is regarded as pathological in the rules of modern law. One of the difficulties that a modern jurist finds if he is called to manage the enforcement of ethnic law is the fact that he is unable to know it without verbalizing it, and he is unable to verbalize a practice that is not repetitive.</page><page sequence="44">386 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 role in the law of many so-called primitive societies.65 By careful analysis, we can see that they play an important role in developed societies as well. Discovery of a cryptotype is facilitated when-as often hap- pens-an idea implicit in one system is explicit in another. Through the use of such comparisons, we have already been able to identify instances in which legal rules are interpreted in the light of ideas present in the mind but not in outward explanations. Located somewhere in between the cryptotype and an explicit explanation is the use of synecdoche: only part of a phenomenon is indicated when referring to the whole. We have seen several in- stances in France, for example, in most cases, the French jurist who speaks of "consent" means consent based on a justification or "cause." The use of comparative law to reveal implicit patterns can be il- lustrated by a further example. In German law, delivery (Ubegmabe) is required for ownership to be transferred; nevertheless, the parties can transfer ownership without delivery by entering into an agree- ment, the so-called possessory accord. It is not clear that they can pledge property by entering into such an agreement. Within the German doctrinal system, it is hard to find a principled distinction between transferring ownership and pledging property. Neverthe- less, the debates on this question show that German jurists feel such a distinction can be drawn. A comparison among legal systems shows that in France and Italy, where delivery is not necessary for ownership to be transferred, it is necessary for property to be pledged. The need for delivery when property is pledged is thus rec- ognized implicitly by all these systems, even though a good explana- tion of the need for it is given by none. Some cryptotypes are more specific, others more general. The more general they are, the harder they are to identify. In extreme cases they may form the conceptual framework for the whole system. When verbalized, cryptotypes are perceived and passed on from one generation of justists to another16 just as the legal rules of the 65. Von Hayek, Rules, cit. 66. Alan Watson has dedicated to these problems Legal Transplants (1976), Soci- ety and Legal Change (1977) and The Evolution of Law (1985). See also Erik Agos- tini, Droit compare' (1988). The topic was one of the subjects discussed at the XIII Congress of Comparative Law (staged by the International Academy of Comparative Law at Montreal in 1990. Reports were submitted by Rodolfo Sacco, Erik Agostini, Witold Czachorski, David Howes, Edward M. Wise, and other scholars. The topic of "the overall reception of foreign legal systems" was one of the sub- jects discussed at the VIII Congress of Comparative Law, staged at Pescara in 1970. Three national reports were published: Imre Zajtay, in Congres intern de droit com- pare' (Pescara, 1970), in Etudes de droit contemporain, nouvelle serie, Paris, 1970 (Travaux et recherches de l'Institut de Droit compare de Paris XXXIII, p. 31 and ff.;</page><page sequence="45">1991] LEGAL FORMANTS 387 society without a written alphabet are preserved and handed down. In the eyes of the people who do so, they soon become "obvi- ous." Normally, a jurist who belongs to a given system finds greater difficulty in freeing himself from the cryptotypes of his system than in abandoning the rules of which he is fully aware. This subjection to cryptotypes constitutes the "mentality" of the jurist of a given country, and such differences in mentality are the greatest obstacle to mutual understanding between judges of different systems. Cryptotypes may be identified and explored only through the use of comparison at a systematic and institutional level. B. "Legal Systemology" When he began the work that laid the foundations of compara- tive law, Rene David had a fortunate intuition. His research into the various systems disregarded the most transient elements, the ele- ments that change with the caprices of authority, and identified the most permanent and the least variable features. He sought out fea- tures common to whole systems or to large sectors of them. Having done so, he had no difficulty discovering that the most permanent phenomenon by no means coincided with the explicit authoritative rules of the various systems. Such phenomena were, for example, the tendency of common lawyers to frame rules of limited extension in contrast with that of civil lawyers to formulate broad rules. Such phenomena involve the relative positions of scholars and judges, the training of jurists, the presence in a given society of professional ju- rists, and so forth. Gorla, working in the same direction, has ob- served how a judicial precedent maintains its authority in France much longer than in Italy. Both David and Gorla have stressed the importance of history in the formation of such durable features. I, too, have tried to enlarge the amount of information available about different legal systems so that it can be subjected to scholarly analysis. For example, I have drawn attention to the question of whether the rules of a system are formulated explicitly or not, to the presence in some systems of political definitions appropriated by authority and used to influence doctrine, and so forth. In short, those who study comparative law have drawn attention to certain constant features present in all systems but neglected by the scholars of single systems. A new field of legal scholarship has thus been born. It should not be confused with the forumulation of a pure theory of law. On the contrary, in a certain sense, it is the opposite of a general theory. A theory enunciates general rules and Oeconomidis, in Revue hellenique de droit international, 1970, 333 ff.; Stone, in Legal Thought in The United States of American Under Contemporary Pressures 127 ff. (John N. Hazard and Wenceslas J. Wagner eds. 1970).</page><page sequence="46">388 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 identifies a number of general concepts to express single rules and institutions. It constitutes the most general part of a given legal sys- tem. Its conclusions may be valid for many systems. Kelsen, Hohfeld and others have put forward general theories that claim to be valid with regard to any legal system. In our field, in contrast, the scholar attempts to describe empirically how the law of a given country actually functions. This endeavor needs a name. We might call it "systemology," the science that studies sytems. It is significant that this science has been invented by compara- tivists almost as a by-product of their comparisons of single institu- tions. Why has this happened? The answer is simple. The jurist who deals with a single system always runs into certain features that he takes to be "obvious" and hence that he does not perceive, identify, or report. These features remain as cryptotypes until the comparativist is struck by the differences in mentality that he ob- serves among different legal environments. When he undertakes the work necessary to describe such difference, he describes the sys- tems themselves. C. Comparative Law in the Service of the Social Sciences Comparative law evaluates the differences and similarities within the systems it considers. Can it move beyond this field of study to become part of interdisciplinary research and serve the scholar concerned with problems of sociology and politics? The an- swer is yes. Comparative law would be a purely doctrinal study if it were to concern itself only with legal forms. Instead, the compara- tive method is based on an appeal to fact and consequently speaks the language of all sciences that turn to fact. An initial contribution that comparative law can make to the so- cial sciences can be seen almost intuitively. Comparative law exam- ines the way in which legal institutions are connected, diversified, and transplanted from one country to another. Law, language and culture break down into cultural, linguistic and legal morphemes. If it wishes, sociology can study the behavior of these cultural mor- phemes, the laws that govern their origin and their movements from one cultural context to another. Comparative law can thus offer its conclusions to sociology. If sociology does not utilize them, it is not the comparativist's fault. The sociologist may indeed say that the laws governing a trans- plantation of legal institutions from one cultural context to another lie outside of his main interests. He does not merely wish to know how legal institutions are borrowed. He wants to provide opinions as to the causes of this borrowing: economic, cultural, psychological</page><page sequence="47">1991] LEGAL FORMANTS 389 and so forth. Can comparative law help him to achieve this objective? The answer would seem to be that comparative law is indispen- sable for precisely the task the sociologist has in mind. If some leg- islative breakthrough occurs in a given country, it would be difficult to see which of five causes is responsible if we continue to play blind man's buff in that country alone. The events that proceeded the leg- islative breakthrough are too numerous to allow the scholar to iso- late one event of many as its cause. Comparative law, however, assists by compiling an inventory of the countries in which such an event has taken place. It establishes when similar events have been preceded by similar causes, and on this basis can search out a corre- spondence between cause and effect. The principle seems a simple one based on the most elementary principles of scientific research. Yet it is still one of the criteria that is most overlooked. For example, one of the strongest anti-formalist methodological trends relates legal phenomena to economic reality. Most of the representatives of this tendency analyze economic real- ity in terms of conflicting class interests. We have nothing to say against this way of investigating. However, to reach any sound con- clusions one must be able to establish connections between class in- terest and legal superstructure, legal rules and institutions. To do so one must show that certain legal solutions actually accompany any instance of a given class stucture, and that a certain class structure actually correlates with the emergence of a given legal solution. It is incredible that this methodological principle is hardly ever put into practice. Those who believe in the material and dialectic analysis of social phenomenon expect to find in their profession of faith a sufficient guaranty of their conclusions without the need to verify them. Once periods have been established and given labels, such as the "late feudal age," "competitive free trade," "monopoly capitalism" and the like, one can fit in anything that comes to mind. An extraordinary variety of phenomena are said to characterize "mature capitalism." Comparative law not only enables one to know domestic law better but to check hypotheses formulated in the sociological anlaysis of law. Comparative law thus becomes a go-between be- tween legal scholarship and history, and between legal scholarship and general legal theory.</page><page sequence="48">390 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 XI. CHANGES IN LEGAL RuLEs, INSTITUTIONS, AND METHODS A. Legal Change and Social Change67 Law is not static. It changes incessantly. Every now and then man entertains the illusion that he can find or even that he has found a legal truth, a criterion for choosing among rules and institu- tions that is invariable, omnicomprehensive, definitive and valid everywhere. Reality has so far refuted such illusions, even though this very noble aspiration to find eternal general rules is a powerful stimulus to the improvement of positive law, purging it of irrational- ity and spurring it on toward higher and higher values. Since legal rules do vary, it is legitimate to ask-even if jurists themselves rarely do-whether these variations conform to any law: not in the sense of a higher legal standard but in the sense of an in- telligible pattern. Research into the cause of variations in legal rules is, in part, the job of the sociologist. It becomes the job of the jurist as well, however, whenever the cause of variation in the rule depends on its nature or contents.68 Consider, for example, the different ways in which the jurist or the linguist study variations in law and language. The linguist de- votes a great deal of study to the laws governing linguistic changes, for example, the rotation of consonants in Indo-European languages or the formation of dipthongs in Italian vowels. He believes it to be his job to investigate the causes of such changes, such as, for exam- ple, the interaction of various languages or the push towards linguiis- tic economy. The jurist, at least since he began to study the phenomenon of legal reception, that is, of overall borrowing, has been prepared to discuss the transplantation of legal rules and its causes. On a gen- eral plane, he tends to explain change by social pressures of various sorts. These social pressures may be exerted uniformly on legisla- tor, judge and scholarly interpreter. Legal formalism, however, may immunize the scholars so that legal change begins when the pres- sure gets the better of the legislators' resistance and continues when the judge follows the legislative lead. Where legal formalism is less strong, the scholarly interpreter and the judge may be the first to react to the social pressure, thereby anticipating the solution that the legislator will subsequently adopt. This pattern of interaction between law and a social situation is 67. Franz Wieacker, in Privatrechtsgeschichte der Neuzeit 143 ff. (1967) recalls that, in historical disciplines, it is methodologically preferable to speak of precedents rather than of causes. But anyone considering a large number of variations looks at them with the eye of the sociologist rather than of the historian. 68. Gabriele Crespi Reghizzi and Rodolfo Sacco, L'abuso del diritto nel sistema civilistico jugoslavo in Est-Ovest, 1977, pp. 55 ff.; Gianmaria Ajani, Le fonti nonscritte nel diritto dei paesi socialisti (1985).</page><page sequence="49">1991] LEGAL FORMANTS 391 not, needless to say, invariably found in practice. Judges often put up a more or less conscious resistance to statutes which themselves may not be the unambiguously necessary response to a social situa- tion. In such cases, judges "create" law in the sense that they do not follow statute but they create only to conserve what already existed before. An example we have already seen is the preservation by French courts of the requirement of delivery to transfer ownership despite the Code Napoleon. Similarly, French courts have recognized the validity of alienations of property by one who believes himself to be heir, even though Belgian interpreters of the Code have taken the opposite view. The cryptotype that has influenced the French ju- rists is the solution that prevailed in Roman law. In socialist countries one could imagine that the general clauses of codes are contrary to the principle of legality. One could also im- agine them exalting these clauses as fostering spontaneous evolution of law as society develops without the need for formal legislative procedures. In reality, however, socialist jurists typically have neither praised nor condemned these clauses.69 B. Legal Change and the Material Structure of Society An overall explanation of legal change has been sought in the analysis of society and history given by Marx and Engels. From their perspective, law is a set of rules imposed by force by the ruling class that controls the state apparatus to insure discipline and the relations of production and exchange that correspond to its eco- nomic interest. When society has an antagonistic class system, this ruling class is an exploiting class. Outside these rules that govern the economic relationship directly there are others designed to safe- guard cultural and moral values that would seem to be non-eco- nomic. And yet this cultural and moral ideology is, in turn, an economic superstructure and another defense of the economic disci- pline of society. The great revolutionary changes of law go hand in hand with the great revolutions in economic structures. Law and state are born with class antagonism, that is, with the birth of slav- ery. They are revolutionarized when slave society makes way for feudal society based on the antagonism between feudal lord and serf. They are revolutionized again when feudal society makes way for capitalistic free trade society, and once more with the establishment of socialism which gives possession of the means of production to the 69. The only limit to randomness seems that every socialist system rejects ab- straction (our Transfert, cit.). Is this an insuperable limit? Probably not, because the abstraction of the modus of purchase is compatible with an action of restitution, which may be functionally similar to the causa or ground to justify the circulation of goods.</page><page sequence="50">392 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 workers, dissolves class antagonism, and opens the way to the with- ering of state and law. Any modification of law is nothing other than a reflection of the modification of the economic base of society. The economic base of society is never completely stationary. In societies with antagonistic class systems, the exploited class will con- tinually take steps to modify its relations with the exploiters. The latter will in turn try to limit the scope of such an attempt. This di- alectical antithesis between the efforts of one class and another will create continuous movement which will immediately be reflected in the legal fabric of the society. When society is free from exploita- tion, the establishment of socialism and the future of communism will proceed by degrees, each degree preparing the way for the next. This overall theory of the cause of legal change has not, up to now, been investigated in detail by its proponents. To assess the evi- dence it is, therefore, a new task without precedent in legal litera- ture. Unbiased analysis of the Marxist hypothesis leads to the conclusion that there is not always a correlation between class struc- ture and the solution of a particular legal problem. Consider the rule whereby motor vehicles must drive on the right or on the left. There are no known cases in which the dissolu- tion of class antagonism changes the side of the road on which motor vehicles have to drive. Consider the transfer of ownership in per- sonal property. The line that distinguishes systems that require titulus and modus and those that require titulus crosses the line that distinguishes free market economies from socialist ones.70 Can we, therefore, conclude that there are "neutral" rules from the class point of view? Before proceeding, we observed that even among Marxist jurists, a minority stress that not all rules change with the overturning of the economic base of the society. The prohi- bition of murder, for example, resists change when capitalism gives way to socialism because it safeguards values that both social struc- tures accept.7' There are, then, legal models which, in proportion to the values which inspire them, survive through historical change. Moreover, I believe that many legal rules survive revolutions pre- cisely because they do not represent any value, do not correspond to any ideology, are foreign to any moral system and respond to an ele- mentary necessity of social organization. No society will ever be free to allow motor vehicles to drive on the left or right as they please. Any society, however, will be free to choose left or right as the side 70. These are the doctrines expressed, in Rumania, by Trajan and Aurelian Jona?cu and by Anita M. Naschitz (see the latter's Teorie si tehnica in procesul de creare a dreptului, 1969, and other works). Rumanian doctrine was perhaps influ- enced by the need to explain (to the Soviets) why socialist Rumania maintained its 1864 codul civil in force. 71.

The choice of class, ideology and value do not free the society from the organizational necessities that stand over it and do not influence its choice of one solution or another. We will be surprised only if we fail to reflect upon a more gen- eral truth. If we wish to classify all facts about society as either eco- nomic (and therefore structural), or as noneconomic (and therefore superstructural) we must place law in the second subdivision along with language, fashion and so forth. Language provides a typical ex- ample of a cultural phenomenon in continuous evolution but the evolution of language is not connected to a class or an axiological or moral choice. The use of language in linguistic borrowings may be influenced by politics, ideology and economic interests, which may, of course, give rise to conspicuous abuses. Yet the content of a lan- guage and its changes by no means are the product of class interest. When Germans made voiced consonants unvoiced and unvoiced con- sonants aspirated (so that "foot" corresponds to the Latin "pedem"), this change was not the product of class conflict, ideology or axiolog- ical choice. The plurality of cultural forms is not always the product of class struggle. On the contrary, it dates from an era that is far more remote than the begnning of class conflict as Marxists con- ceive it. Until the '50s such considerations seemed wholly incompat- ible with the doctrine of Marx and Engels. In that period, Stalin's famous four articles concerning language introduced into Marxist doctrine the idea that the contents of a language are autonomous with regard to the economic structure of various societies.72 No one returned to the argument again. If it is admitted, then, that some cultural forms are conditioned by the material base of the society, what is the position of legal morphemes? There are, indeed, legal morphemes which immediately reflect class interest, or, in general, a political decision based on interests or values. An example would be the nationalization of the ownership of the industrial means of production. Other legal morphemes are neutral with regard to class interest. Nearly all the law with which we are familiar falls into that category. The neutrality of these mor- phemes explains the survival of Roman rules and institutions in feu- dal, free market and socialist law (for example, obligatio, rei vindicatio, emtio venditio, and so forth). Conversely, the neutrality of legal morphemes explains why societies with a similar economic base can have rules and institutions that are irreducibly different in the way that certain common law institutions are irreducibly differ- 72.

Social dialectics can alter the sub- jects of a legal relationship so that they become the state instead of the individual, the public corporation instead of the private com- pany, or it can alter the objects of the relationship so that, for exam- ple, a slave ceases to be a possible object of ownership. Nevertheless law has a genius of its own which enables these changes to occur while an underlying legal structure endures. C. Changes in the "Legal Formants" If it were true that each legal system regulated each question by a single rule, we would find that all legal formants of the system would change together, legislative, judicial and scholarly. In fact, even when rules are borrowed from abroad, these elements do not move simultaneously. Anyone unfamiliar with the notion of negozio giuridico (juridi- cal act) could not claim to know Italian law. Yet the Italian Codice Civile does not mention negozio. It speaks, instead, of contract, will, power of attorney, and so forth. The legislator in 1942 used these expressions because he found them in the Code of 1865 and the codes enforced before Italian unification, and ultimately, in the French Civil Code. The doctrine of negozio familiar to Italian schol- ars, however, comes from the German doctrine of the last century. In Italy, therefore, rules of French derivation coexist with doctrines of German derivation. Each was borrowed autonomously. The Soviet Union and Poland both took over the doctrine of ju- ridical act that was of imperial German origin. Nevertheless, this doctrine has not had the same history in the Soviet Union as in Po- land. In Russia, the doctrine was first taken over by the Academy, then disseminated in the universities, then introduced into the 1903 Grazhdanskoje Ulozhenie project, then into the 1922 Russian Civil Code and subsequently into the Osnovy of the civil law for the USSR for 1961 and into the 1964 republican codes. Thus the Ger- man doctrines were borrowed by scholars and then reflected in the various codifications. In Poland, instead, it was decided in 1946 to unify the law of juridical act as a step toward the unification of the law. Those taking part in this endeavor took as a model the general part of the German Civil Code. One can trace the 1964 Kodeks Cywilny back to the 1946 decree. Borrowing and imitation is therefore of central importance to understanding the course of legal change. For example, the French Civil Code has found very many imitators: for example, the Piedmonteses with their Codice Albertino, the Neapolitans with their Codice Borbonico, many Swiss cantons, the Dutch, the people of Baden, the Poles in the period of the Dutchy of Warsaw, the Rus-</page><page sequence="53">1991] LEGAL FORMANTS 395 sians at the time of the Svod Zakonov (1832), then, in a second wave of imitations, the Romanians, the Bulgarians, Turks (with the Mecelle of 1968), the Egyptians, and, through imitation of the 1949 Egyptian Code, the Somalis (1973), the Algerians (1975), and many others. Again, nineteenth century German doctrine has spread to Scandanavia, Russian, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Croa- tia, Italy, Spain, Latin America and Holland. The meeting of French rules and institutions and German doctrines has occurred at differ- ent times in most civil law countries from Russia to Italy and from Spain to Romania. Borrowing by judges has been less studied. The judge is less in- clined than the scholar or legislator to examine the production of other countries. Nevertheless, three interesting instances of judicial borrowing should be mentioned. First, there is the direct imitation of judges by judges. A partic- ularly important instance is that in which the judge operates in a system without a code. Until a few years ago, it was thought that the English case law was formed without much borrowing from abroad. Gorla demonstrated that from the middle of the seven- teenth century until the first half of the nineteenth, English judges, in fact, read the reports of European Rotae and Camerae. Within the limits set by the compatibility of common law and civil law insti- tutions, they applied the work of foreign judges to English law.73 In deed, the most recent studies show that, before the French Revolution, just as there was a Europe of the universities, so there was a Europe of the judges who not only followed foreign scholarly doctrine but also foreign precedent. A second important form of judicial borrowing is that which takes place through intermediaries. Today, the existence of super- national bodies has created more room for transnational judicial imi- tation. For example, the so-called principle of proportionality has long been a feature of German administrative law.74 When a supra- national body adopted that principle, the French conseil d'etat, which is generally disinclined to imitate German rules or institu- tions, allowed itself to adopt this one, at least temporarily. Another important way in which judicial borrowing occurs is when scholars formulate their doctrines on the basis of the case law 73. The topic was dealt with at the X Congress of Comparative Law (Budapest, 1978), a bibliography has developed as a result of the publication of the proceedings of the congress. (See Riv. dir. civ., 1978, I, 637). 74. As in other analogous cases, a linguistic conditioning is at work here. During the revolutionary era, Turks knew German as an international language. When knowledge of German fell and knowledge of French grew, the Turks found access to Swiss case law less easy, and they hence turned to French law. Today English is bet- ter known than French, but English law reports seem impossible to use for anyone having to make a legal argument with Swiss-Turkish conceptual categories.</page><page sequence="54">396 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 of a country, and these doctrines, borrowed by another country, in- fluence its judges. Indeed, this is really an instance of borrowing through intermediaries. The work of judges, like the work of scholars, is often borrowed without much regard for the rules that are supposed to be in force in the country of its reception. A typical example is the law of Tur- key. The code is Swiss and was chosen by the legislator, Kemal Ata- tiirk, as a means of westernizing Turkey through the modernization of its law. The case law, however, is in part an imitation of the French.75 Another example is to be found in Somalia. The Somali Code of 1973 is an imitation of the Egyptian Code. Nevertheless, the Somalis considered their code as an autonomous enactment and therefore do not study the Egyptian case law. Nevertheless, since they commonly speak Italian because of their colonial past, they superimpose an Italian interpretation on a code that is much more French than Ital- ian. Borrowing of this type takes place from the legal formant of one legal system to a similar legal formant of another. A different type of borrowing, from one legal formant to an- other dissimilar one, takes place-obviously-within each system. It is completely normal for scholarly doctrine to influence the code and the case law, and for the case law to influence amendments to the code or scholary doctrine. The combination of both kinds of borrowing produces family trees like this one: 75. Alan Watson, op. cit., chapter XVL, observes that most legal changes in most legal systems are due to such borrowings.</page><page sequence="55">1991] LEGAL FORMANTS 397 THE GERMAN PANDECTIST SCIENTIFIC DOCTRINE I I I I I BGB Austrian Hungarian 1900 Italian Doctrine 1800 i doctrine on doctrine Russian the general the ABGB I doctrine part of I 1928 coLceptual Spanish I the 1966 contem- draft of apparatus doctrine 1908 (Polish) KC porary (Hungarian) of (Italian) draft of Slorene PTK 1942 cod. civ.

Thus far we have spoken almost exclusively of changes that oc- cur through borrowing or imitation. Of course, if a rule or institu- tion is borrowed, it must have been born beforehand. Nevertheless, the birth of a rule or institution is a rarer phenomenon than its imi- tation.76 In particular, no civil code can be original. Political author- ity, with an ad hoc commission, may develop brief formulas but it cannot devise a complex work of thousands of articles. A code arises sometimes from national scholarly doctrine and more frequently through imitation of another code. Of the hundreds of civil codes promulgated since the French Code of 1804, the Austrian and the German codes and, in part, the Czechoslovakian Code of 1964 are of national origin as well as the core of socialist rules contained in the Soviet Osnovy of 1961. The rest imitate another code or enact small changes suggested by the case law or by scholars. One can say the same for constitutions, administrative models, codes of procedure, and so forth. D. Borrowing We have seen, then, that legal rules, institutions and styles change continually, as does language, either through slow evolution, as in the transition from Latin to French, or by overall superimposi- tion, as for example, in the transition from Celtic to a system with Celtic and Latin elements to Latin. We have said nothing thus far about the cause of this change. Nor can we trace the cause without drawing a basic distinction between an original innovation and its imitation. It is an original innovation, for example, when a 76. Alan Watson, op. cit., teaches us that foreign law may exert an influence even when it is completely misunderstood.</page><page sequence="56">398 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 Scandanavian country institutes the ombudsman, when Venedicktov explains the enterprise's power over the means of production as pravo upravlenija or right to operational management, when the commission set up by Maria Theresia draws up a civil code in the narrow sense of the word, or when the Lord Chancellor recognizes the trust in courts of equity. Of all the legal changes that occur, per- haps one in a thousand is an original innovation. Moreover, true originality does not usually receive the fanfare that accompanies im- itation. One could collect in an anthology of the grotesque the praise for originality and novelty that has accompanied every imita- tion of legal rules and institutions.77 What causes imitations? Similarities in cultural, environmen- tal, social and economic conditions may be crucial. But just as legal rules and institutions remain after cultural or class revolutions, so imitations may cross cultural frontiers where the boundaries sepa- rate economic systems.78 There are two fundamental causes of imitation: imposition and prestige. Every culture that has faith in itself tends to spread its own institutions. Anyone with the power to do so tends to impose his own upon others. Receptions due to pure force, however, are re- versible and end when the force is removed. Moreover, receptions due to pure force are relatively rare in history. One thinks of the diffusion of European institutions in the colonies and yet, in the col- onies, European legal institutions were applied almost exclusively to relations between Europeans or in relations that were unregulated by local law, such as drafts, checks, and limited liability companies. The general application of European rules and institutions came af- ter decolonization and in accordance with the will of the now-in- dependent local authorities. Usually, reception takes place because of the desire to appropri- ate the work of others. The desire arises because this work has a quality one can only describe as "prestige." This explanation in terms of prestige is tautological, and comparative law has no defini- tion of the word "prestige" to offer. The analysis of this term is, if anything, the province of other disciplines. Nevertheless, the power 77. Cfr. Alan Watson, op. cit. (chapter XVI) observes that the transplant of legal rules is easy from a social point of view (...) and that this holds even when the rules come from a very different system. 78. The Svod Zakonov has introduced a rigorous separation of goods between husband and wife. The choice was reaffirmed by the Russian (1918) and Ukrainian (1919) family codes. But tradition was stronger than any obstacle: at a certain point, the Ukrainian supreme court was the first to turn its back on the legal rule and, sub- sequently, Russian case law, faithful to the consuetudinary model, has induced the 1926 legislator to abandon the modermisation of Russian law. After 1944, the Russian model spread more or less rapidly in the popular democracies, where it defeated all resistance.</page><page sequence="57">1991] LEGAL FORMANTS 399 of prestige is an indispensable postulate in explaining the imitation of a whole host of cultural phenomenon. If, for example, the in- habitants of the valleys of the Languedoc in Piedmont are willing to speak Italian, one can see at work the influence of schools, newspa- pers, radio and television. If this same ethnic group, however, were prepared to speak Peidmontese, this explanation would no longer work, and it would be necessary to speak of prestige. Prestige gov- erns the diffusion of fashion in clothes and much else besides. Pres- tige diffuses each linguistic change after the change has once occurred. Prestige carried the medieval Roman law across Europe. Prestige carried the French Civil Code and German doctrine beyond the frontiers of the civil law. Prestige made the penetration of French and English rules and institutions into Africa irreversible. The prestige of the Shari'a has eroded numerous African usages. The borrowing of legal rules and institutions often gives rise to strange and artificial rationalizations. The law providing for com- munity acquisition of property by spouses-well rooted in the Ger- manic customs of the Middle Ages and the peasant customs of the Russian countryside-resisted liberal, enlightenment, rational and fi- nally socialist attempts to modernize it. The medieval peasant model was able to present itself to the Italian legislator in 1975 as worthy of imitation because of its presence in the law of liberal and economically developed societies in America and France and in the Socialist law of the Soviet Union. In adopting this law, the Italians gave a series of rationalizations connected to the values they held in high esteem at the moment of reception. Imitations follow intelligi- ble patterns which must be considered as tendencies. There may be, of course, exceptions due to historical accidents. Prestige may be enjoyed by a single institution or an entire sys- tem. In the latter case, borrowing will take place exclusively from the system vested with prestige to other systems. Today, it is un- likely that a European country will imitate an African model, that the United States will imitate a Venezulan model, that the Scandi- navian countries will imitate an Italian model, and so forth. Imita- tions in the reverse direction may occur. It should not be taken for granted that rules or institutions have deeper roots in the area in which they originated than elsewhere. A country that has created a rule or institution that others borrow may have an innovative capacity which will lead it to replace this rule or institution by another. If the original rule or institution has been borrowed in the meantime by other countries, these countries may preserve it longer than the country of its origin. Dutch South Africa offers an example of an area that because of its isolation from the civil law world has been less exposed to the influence of more recent innovations and, therefore, has preserved a system that is</page><page sequence="58">400 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE LAW [Vol. 39 strongly conservative. The Republic of San Marino is an example of an area that resists innovation-thanks to its marginal status. More intense borrowing, unilateral and reciprocal, tends to oc- cur between similar systems than between very different ones. In- deed, the system that borrows a rule or institution must integrate it with all of its other rules and institutions overcoming difficulties that are as great as the generic differences between the system and the one from which it is borrowed. For example, a legal system can- not borrow elements that are expressed in terms that are foreign to its own doctrine. Conversely, if two systems have the same codes or both have a system of judge-made law, the judges of each country may find it easy to borrow from each other. Imitation is more obvi- ous when one legal formant of a system is borrowed and not the others. Between two totally different systems, an overall reception is easier than wide ranging imitation of particular rules and institutions. Finally, a legal system will tend to borrow when it is incom- plete. An incomplete system will tend to imitate just to fill the gaps. E. Innovation Innovations are made continually. A judicial decision in a new case and a student's wrong-headed answer to an examination ques- tion both entail an innovation. However, the only innovations that really matter are those that originate from an authority or are adopted by an authority or for some other reason are diffused be- cause people find they must imitate them. Synchronically speaking, an innovation that does not originate from an authority is a "error," be it the error of a judge, of an advo- cate or of a student. Diachronically, however, the nature of an inno- vation is more ambiguous. If it finds imitators, it will be a creation, a discovery. If not, it will be an isolated opinion, an error. We must then ask our usual question: how do these innovations originate? We have already seen that it is not the task of the lawyer to give a complete answer. Perhaps it is not the task of any science to move away from questions concerning how something happens into the treacherous question of why. Comparative law may never- theless develop partial answers which are useful. Innovation may depend upon social facts that go beyond the legal system itself. It may depend, that is, upon evolution or revolu- tion in the system of values or upon the seizure of power by repre- sentatives of new interests. Sometimes, however, it depends upon phenomena that are themselves legal. Economy of principle, for example, suggests that where possible two different rules applicable to two different cases</page><page sequence="59">1991] LEGAL FORMANTS 401 be replaced by a single rule. While civil law systems use one rule to give procedural protection to a person with a usufruct and another to protect anyone who has de facto proprietary rights. Another ex- ample is the way in which, during the Middle ages, the actio legis aquiliae became a generalized action for delictual liability eclipsing the others in Roman law and leading eventually to the general solu- tion of Article 1382 of the French Civil Code. In these cases, innova- tion is produced by a desire to generalize, to seek harmony, analogy or assimilation. Generalization suppresses particular features. Rules are simpli- fied by leaving out some of their elements. It is simpler to say that lability in tort requires fault and damage than to say it requires fault, and injury to a right, and damage. It is simpler to say that a contract is formed by two wills than to say it is formed by two wills and two outward declarations of will. We should bear in mind, however, that the simpler rule often exists only as a hortatory statement of legal scholars, particularly in those contexts, like France and unlike Germany, where scholarly sloshings do not claim to be scientific absolutes. As we have seen the French law adopts simplified definitions that are instances of sy- necdoche and which the Germans try to avoid. The role of scholars in civil law countries has produced an inclination toward general rules greater than that in common law countries. At the same time, in every society there is a countervailing tendancy toward ever more specialized legal rules that combine ele- mentary legal institutions in ever more complex ways. It must be so if the society is to fulfill its needs through more varied and numer- ous techniques. Thus every new code deals with a greater number of types of transactions and, indeed, every new codification takes place only after the rules governing these transactions have been worked out in practice. Legal rules and institutions are then ratio- nalized by assimilation, that is, by finding analogies and distinctions among rules and institutions. On other occasions, an innovation arises in the way in which a well-known proposition is interpreted. Tom states a proposition. Dick wants to repeat the same idea and to explain it better and therefore formulates it in different words. Harry sees in Dick's words a different idea than Tom's and adopts it. In such cases the "new idea" springs from ideas that Dick and Harry already had but did not express before encountering Tom's proposition. We will never fully understand the way in which an interpreter works, however, until we understand the legal ideas of nonprofes- sionals, especially of young people. A systematic collection of the er- rors made by first-year university students in their exams would be of the greatest interest.</page></plain_text>
