<plain_text><page sequence="1">Darwin, Teleology and Taxonomy Andrew Woodfield Darwinism is 'much more than a theory', said the German botanist Albert Wigand in i875; 'it is a frame of mind which dominates thought, a resuscitated "Naturphilosophie", in which the terms "Polarity", "Totality", "Subject", "Object" are replaced by terms such as "Struggle for Exist- ence", "Inheritance", "Selection", and so on.'1 Subsequent events have indicated that Wigand had a point. But it is not clear to us yet what exactly the point is. Interest in Man's Place in Nature, and in his alleged biological uniqueness as a language-user and tool-maker, is as great now as it was in i87I when Darwin's Descent of Man was first published. We now have access to well over a hundred years' worth of material sparked off by The Origin of Species, linking Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection to almost every field under the sun. Yet the precise status of his theory is still the subject of vigorous controversy in philosophy of science. One source of lingering perplexity is the concept of 'purpose in nature', which is connected to the idea of 'natural progress'. It strikes one as paradoxical that, on the one hand, the theory says there is no need to appeal to purposes when explaining evolutionary developments, and, on the other, the language inwhich the theoryis expressed is chock-a-blockwith references to purposes. One of the main aims of a recent best-selling book2 is to provide a solution to what the author calls this 'flagrant epistemological contra- diction'. Secondly, it is tempting to say that there is no possible animal or plant that natural selection could not claim to explain. Is this a sign that it is one of the greatest scientific generalizations of all time, or a sign that it is a tautology, and so not an empirical hypothesis at all? Third, and most important of all perhaps, the theory claims that man is subject to natural selection like the rest of nature. But man invents culture. Does Darwin's theory imply that there is such a thing as 'cultural evolution' which proceeds in accordance with the law of natural selection? These are three large questions. They are made additionally complex by the fact that the theory is itself a landmark of scientific progress.

If natural selection weeded out theories as it weeds out plants, Darwinism would yield a second-order theory about theories which explained why it had survived as a first-order theory. It would assert that a theory survives only if it is fit, and that therefore first-order Darwinism must be fit. However, theories are not made true by longevity. Being a fit theory in the Darwinian sense does not necessarily involve being a true theory. One hopes that the reason why Darwin's theory has persisted is that it fits the facts, not merely that it is fit according to its own criterion. A general difficulty also arises when we try to separate the theory as it timelessly is from what it was historically taken to be. The former has logical consequences, but has no historical consequences except through the latter. Darwinism did have great influence on, for example, both laissez- faire economics and socialism, inasmuch as their respective proponents believed that Darwin had supplied a biological justification for them.3 But these beliefs may have been erroneous. Indeed, natural selection could hardly entail both capitalism and Marxism, given that these are incom- patible with each other. My aim is to give answer-sketches to the three questions, and to show how they are related. I must apologize in advance for oversimplifying. Darwin's theory is not a tight cluster of propositions, but a rambling thicket. I am taking the following as representative key assertions: (A) 'The innumerable species, genera and families of organic beings, with which this world is peopled, have all descended, each within its own class or group, from common parents, and have all been modified in the course of descent.'4 (B) 'If variations useful to any organic being do occur, assuredly indi- viduals thus characterized will have the best chance of being preserved in the struggle for life; and from the strong principle of inheritance they will tend to produce offspring similarly characterized.'5 Proposition (B), the natural selection hypothesis, supplies a reason or underlying mechanism behind proposition (A), given that spontaneous variations do occur. The link between (A) and (B) is explained as follows: 'Natural Selection leads to divergence of character; for more living beings can be supported in the same area the more they diverge in structure, habits and constitution.' Darwin did not claim to explain the first living being(s), apart from 3 For a contemporary example, see Enoch Powell's article in The Spectator, 7445, 6 March 1971, p. 3I 2. 4 The Origin of Species, ist edition, p. 434.

He regarded the origin of life as Newton regarded gravity: it is something you have to take for granted in order to get your theory off the ground. Nor could he explain the cause of hereditary variability, which natural selection needs to work on. His 'beloved child', the theory of Pangenesis, had to cede gracefully to Men- delian genetics plus the theory of random mutations before the story was more or less watertight. But given initial genetic variation, his theory was a possible account of speciation, and in The Origin he accumulated a moun- tain of evidence based on paleontology, embryology, artificial breeding, geographical distribution and comparative anatomy to prove that it was the right account. On the supposition that the explanatory schema summarized by (A) and (B) is broadly correct, what are the answers to the three questions? (I) The Place of Purpose in Darwin's Theory 'Special Creation' was the theory that each species came into being as a result of a separate act of creation by God. It went hand in hand with the idea that species were immutable. The attraction and tenacity of this doctrine lay not only in the absence, before Darwin, of a well-documented alternative, but also in the fact that animals, whatever their species, are a special sort of entity which seem to require a special sort of explanation. Their parts are so mutually well-adapted that they could not, so it was felt, have arisen in complete form except as the result of intelligent design. An idea of the whole must have regulated the building of the parts. The cause of their existence, therefore, must be the designer. However, scientifically-minded men had long been suspicious of theories of this type. By the middle of the nineteenth century it had been firmly established that the task of science was to trace the secondary causes and natural laws which God uses as his means. The reason why Special Creation haunted biology for so long was that it was difficult even to con- ceive of any causal intermediaries that could account for the existence of a new species, since a species begins to exist when its first member begins to exist. This fact, so apparently obvious, acted as a blinker on man's con- ception of what 'coming into being' means for species. No known laws of nature could produce an animal out of inanimate materials, so the link between Creator and Created must be peculiarly intimate in this case. But Special Creation represented absolutely no advance on the Ancient Greek myth of autochthony, or on spontaneous generation a la Van Helmont, who pronounced: 'Compress a dirty shirt in the mouth of a pot containing some grain. After about twenty days a ferment coming from the dirty shirt combines 37</page><page sequence="4">Andrew Woodfield with the effluvium from the wheat, the grains of which are turned into mice.'7 However, as even theologians came to see, natural selection itself can be viewed as a secondary cause, a means by which the Creator achieves his grand plan of creating species. Its peculiarity is that it is a gradual process. It is somewhat abstract, and different from the usual sorts of vera causa, but it does explain how the organisms that exist came to be as they are, and it does so by citing a law of nature that is still operative. Sir Charles Lyell's Principles of Geology (i830-i832) had already paved the way towards gradualism and uniformitarianism, and away from catastrophism, so the climate of scientific opinion was just ready, so to speak, for Darwin in i859. As soon as one understood what was meant by natural selection, one switched from a fixed species concept to a dynamic one. The average Victorian naturalist had to be satisfied that this conceptual shift did not entail atheism before he could bring himself to make it. He made it in the end. Evolutionary theory and non-fundamentalist religion became reconciled, thanks partly to the fact that both sides were able to agree that animals were teleological. To the theologians, the fact that they were teleological meant that only God could have planned them. To Darwin, the fact that they were teleological meant they were adapted to their environment. These two different notions were easily merged under the same blurred concept. But Darwin was troubled by the thought that functional adaptedness is not the whole of teleology. Might not the theologians be right when they claim that to think of animals as teleological commits one to believing in a great power that directs them? If valid, the argument does not prove that the great power is identical with the Christian God, of course; it could equally well be Nature herself. Darwin often personifies nature in order to spice up his sentences with a metaphor here and there. Nevertheless, the thought that Nature might have definite plans seems to have exercised Darwin's mind considerably. Unfortunately, the question of whether there are purposes in nature is so puzzling, that mental cramp soon sets in. It did so for Lyell, and for Asa Gray, Darwin's American champion, and for Darwin himself: 'The conclusion at which I have come is that such a question is beyond the human intellect, like "predestination and free will" or the "origin of evil".'9 7 From Forerunners of Darwin, p. 40.

Vol. II. 38</page><page sequence="5">Darwin, Teleology and Taxonomy A number of issues are involved here. As a preliminary, it is imperative to distinguish 'purposive' teleology from 'functional' teleology. The former ascribes goals or purposes to a living being whose behaviour is being explained (e.g. 'The rat swam in order to get the food'). The latter ascribes a function to parts or products of a living thing, and does not imply that these have goals of their own (e.g. 'The heart beats in order to circulate the blood'). Explanations of the second type can be rephrased as explicit function-statements, as 'The function of the heartbeat is to circulate the blood'. The distinction between purposiveness and func- tionality is parallel to Kant's distinction between 'internal' and 'external' teleology.10 A necessary condition of functionality is that the item being explained should serve some purpose for a thing other than itself. The heart does, but the rat does not. Of course, it may be that rats do serve some purpose from Man's or Nature's or God's point of view, but this is irrele- vant to the truth of an internally teleological explanation of their behaviour, since all such an explanation requires is that rats should be capable of having purposes of their own. There are two main sources of avoidable confusion concerning func- tionality. First, teleology of this sort is not inseparably wedded to theology. Functional explanations do not require us to postulate a designer before we can understand them. They work independently of any hypotheses regarding the origin of the explanandum. Such a postulate would have no power to explain why animal organs do what they do rather than something else, because it would be compatible with all the facts being completely different. This is so because we have no access to the intentions of the designer apart from observing his products. David Hume shrewdly remarked, in this context, 'It is in vain to insist upon the uses of the parts of animals or vegetables and their curious adjustment to each other. I would fain know how an animal could subsist, unless its parts were so adjusted?'11 He is not belittling the notion of adaptedness. He is debunking the idea that adaptedness is a proof of design. Darwin brought to the surface an idea implicit in this passage, that the survival-rates of animals with a certain feature can be turned round and used as a criterion of the functional value of the feature. The second main confusion is to think that functional ascriptions involve anthropomorphism. The trouble springs perhaps from a tendency to 10 Critique of Teleological Judgment. Actually, Kant appears to make two distinctions which are not kept entirely separate, one between relative and absolute purposiveness, the other between external and internal. For a discussion of Kant's views, see J. D. McFarland, Kant's Concept of Teleology, especially Chapter 6.

Kemp-Smith edition, I947. 39</page><page sequence="6">Andrew Woodfield equate biological functions with the functions of man-made tools. As the function of an artefact is the human purpose it serves, one is tempted to generalize from this and suppose that everything with a function must serve a human purpose. This view goes with a belief that all things, includ- ing animals, exist for man's benefit. The organs of an animal need to func- tion properly if the animal is to exist. If the animal is beneficial to man, then its organs are indirectly beneficial to man too. The fallacious next step is to suppose that their being beneficial to man is what makes it correct to say they have functions. However, one may reject the belief that animals exist for man's convenience and pleasure, yet still say their organs have functions. What we mean is that the organs do things which are beneficial to their owners. The problem which remains once these confusions have been cleared away is as follows. According to Darwin, evolution and speciation are to be understood in terms of long-term adaptive modification. Talk of adaptation presupposes that talk about function makes sense. Such talk is empirically verifiable provided that assessments of function are based on evidence about the organ's contribution to some agreed end. The bladder facilitates excretion, and this counts as a function because excretion is the elimination of waste-products and poisons from the animal's body. It is not normally necessary to add that this is a good thing for the animal, but if anyone wants this spelled out, we can specify a further beneficial effect of the process, and eventually we can cite survival itself. Since survival and reproduction are the ultimate ends of the chain of justification, the ultimate standards by which biologists assess functional value, survival and repro- duction cannot be shown to be functions themselves by referring to any further end. An organ or bodily process has a function if it promotes the life of the whole in which it belongs. We can hardly ask whether the survival of an animal promotes the life of its owner, if the owner is the animal. Functional analysis stops at this limiting point. Animals do, however, appear to strive after survival and reproduction, judging from their behaviour. These do seem to be ends for them in the sense of 'ultimate goals'. It surely cannot be pure coincidence that the two ends at the apex of the hierarchy of functions are identical with the two ultimate animal goals. In ascribing functions to parts, one needs to assume that the organism as a whole has at least one end, otherwise the hierarchy of functions will lack a principle of generation. It looks as though we justify this assumption by equating ends with primary goals. Darwin, of course, takes it for granted that living things strive to survive and reproduce. But couldn't an alien being view animals as striving after individual death and group extinction? After all, every animal does die in the end, and countless species have become extinct. A sceptic about teleology could go further, and question whether we have any justification for viewing animals as striving after ends at all. Why not say these things 40</page><page sequence="7">Darwin, Teleology and Taxonomy just happen, without bringing in purposes or ends? The sceptic's question cannot be decided by collecting more facts. It is a question about the right way to view the facts. Darwin viewed the facts about the animal and plant world with a metaphysical presupposition which most normal people happen to share: that the world is full of struggling and striving. Not only did he share this general teleological presupposition, he also accepted the standard identification of what the ends are. Darwin, then, did not destroy our usual teleological way of conceiving the living world, though he did dispense with that vacuous teleology which features in the argument from design. What he did was to explain how the adaptedness that we see around us might have arisen, without referring to divine purposes. The metaphysical problem still remains: is the struggling and striving we see in nature really there, or are we projecting it there ourselves? Perhaps we should be more objective if we described animals as simply moving around, sometimes fast, sometimes slowly, without any aim or direction. If so, then we should not think that any of the organs which enable them to do so had functions, as distinct from mere effects. Although Darwin did not solve this philosophical problem, he showed how it could be pushed to the periphery. For we need not ask the general question, 'Is adaptedness an objective property?' every time we see an apparent adaptation. Individual cases can be tested empirically by seeing whether they have survival-value. If we define 'adaptedness' in terms of survival-value, then adaptedness is certainly objective. The philosophical question only arises when we ask whether the definition is justified. A similar strategy can be adopted over the problem of the objectivity of progress. By initially defining 'biological progress' in terms of 'adaptation', we can construct an objective test of progressiveness. If, to take a well- worn example, dark coloration is adaptive for moths in industrial areas, then their recent evolutionary change from light to dark was progressive. However, the ultimate arbiter of progressiveness, increased survival-rate, cannot in turn be assessed as progressive by the same yardstick, for the same reason that survival cannot be assessed as adaptive. We may, of course, wonder whether the thriving of a particular species, say locusts, is progressive on some other, perhaps human or cosmic standard, though the supposition that it is, or is not, has no clear sense until the wider standard has been defined. Darwin was sceptical of applying the idea of progress to evolution as a whole. 'I believe', he says, 'in no law of necessary development.'12 Furthermore, since any character may be functional in one environment, dysfunctional in another, the direction of evolution for a particular species is dependent on the way its ecological circumstances change. Thus Darwinian progress is totally relative, and we have no idea where it will lead. This relativistic, non-evaluative notion of 12 Origin of Species, p. 348. 4'</page><page sequence="8">Andrew Woodfield progress encourages an ethical detachment of a somewhat quietistic sort. I think it is discernible in a number of passages of Darwin's writing. He remarks, for instance, in a letter to Lyell, 4 January i86o, 'I am sorry to say I have no "consolatory view" on the dignity of man. I am content that man will probably advance, and care not much whether we are looked at as mere savages in a remotely distant future.' (II) Darwin's Theory as a Paradigm for Systematics Our second question asks whether the statement that the fittest survive is anything but a tautology. Is it simply a functionalist variant of Leibniz's Principle of Sufficient Reason? If the actual survival of an animal is the only way of establishing its fitness, then the proposition 'Only the fittest survive' is true by definition, hence trivially compatible with any actual or possible evolutionary development. Fortunately, this objection is easy to answer. It confuses probability of survival, estimated from known laws, with actual survival. An animal that can swim is better adapted to the possibility of a flood than one who cannot, even though, because no flood occurs, both survive. Fitness is not survival through sheer luck, but survival in virtue of having certain characteristics. Since this position regarding the status of the natural selection hypothesis has been sufficiently well-discussed in recent literature, I propose to spend little time on defending it further.13 Admittedly it is often difficult to assess what function some modifica- tions have. The only non-theory-laden constraint on speculation, when the evidence is fossil-evidence, is whether the hypothesized function, e.g. gliding, in the case of the forelimbs of pterodactyl, is mechanically possible for an organ with that structure. There is no stage in the investigation at which one can assert categorically that the feature has no function, nor is there any direct means of refuting functional hypotheses experimentally. But these are the methodological burdens that paleontologists just have to bear. Darwin is certainly not committed to the view that every part always has to have survival-value. As he emphasises, it is precisely the rudimentary or vestigial organs, the ones that no longer have any function, which are most reliable for the purposes of phylogenetic classification, since organs not subject to selection pressure are least labile. 13 See, for example, A. Flew's article 'The Structure of Darwinism' in Penguin New Biology, 28 (I959); Michael Scriven's paper 'Explanation and Prediction in Evolutionary Theory', in Science, 130, 477 (I959); A. D. Barker, 'An Approach to the Theory of Natural Selection' and K. K. Lee, 'Popper's Falsifiability and Darwin's Natural Selection' in Philosophy, 44 (i969). Finally, Michael Ruse's detailed analysis, 'Natural Selection in The Origin of Species,' Studies in History and Philosophy of Science, February 197I . 42</page><page sequence="9">Darwin, Teleology and Taxonomy So the 'survival of the fittest' hypothesis is not a tautology. Yet there are ways in which Darwin's theory provides regulative principles for the practice of taxonomy. It would not be enough to say the hypothesis was contingent, and leave it at that. I mean, if it were not for the natural selection hypothesis, we should have no adequate theory of how the different species arose, and consequently we should have no rational method of classifying them. We need to classify them on the basis of origin, because all other methods leave vast quantities of data unexplained, and ultimately turn out to be arbitrary. We might recognize that a hypo- thetical evolutionary story helped us to classify animals in a remarkably illuminating way, but unless there is a mechanism by which such evolution could have taken place, the story could never claim to reconstruct what actually took place during the millennia that have preceded us. Chapter XIII of The Origin puts it eloquently: 'If we extend the use of this element of descent-the only certainly known cause of similarity in organic beings-we shall understand what is meant by the natural system: it is genealogical in its attempted arrangement, with the grades of acquired difference marked by the terms varieties, species, genera, families, orders and classes. On this same view of descent with modification, all the great facts in Morphology become intelligible.' It would be an enormous task to try to describe the state that taxonomy was in before Darwin found the key. Painstaking and meticulous though the observations and classifications of Linnaeus, Cuvier and other natural- ists may have been, they lacked an underlying theory of animal diversity to justify their systematizations. The main point I wish to make is that though it could have been false that any two animals have a common ancestor if you go back far enough (just as it could have been false that animals exist, reproduce sexually, and have offspring that resemble them), nevertheless that fact is now a foundation-stone on which classificatory decisions rest. The definitions we work with when we apply general names to animal groups are arrived at by presupposing descent with modification. To the extent that our classificatory system is broadly on the right track, the great theory on which it is predicated has attained the status of a condi- tion of coherent thought in zoology, and is therefore more than just a contingent hypothesis. There may certainly be omissions and mistakes in existing evolutionary tree diagrams; Kerkut14 notes how dotted lines get written as continuous ones in sloppy textbooks. But we know our general theory of systematics is adequate, because we know how to proceed when we have to rectify errors. The general criteria for weighing the evidence are the same in 14 G. A. Kerkut, Implications of Evolution. Pure and Applied Biology Mono- graphs i960. 43</page><page sequence="10">Andrew Woodfield problematic cases as in straightforward ones. This would be inconceivable unless Darwin were basically right. In order to conceive of species as dynamic entities, and to see how Darwin differed from a nominalist, like Lamarck, who said species-classifi- cations were arbitrary, one has to appreciate the essentially historical nature of the concept. A species is a class, fluctuating in size, which retains its identity over time, while the individuals of which it is composed are continually being replaced. Also the characteristics of its members may gradually alter, within limits, without the species itself altering. It is a strange and difficult concept, best grasped perhaps by using as a heuristic the concept of 'gene-pool', defined as the sum-total of genetic information in an interbreeding population.15 Since the number of possible gene- combinations in a gene-pool greatly exceeds the number actually realized, the total membership of a species at any given time can be viewed as a transitory partial representation of its genetic potential. Yet the gene-pool remains more or less the same while the generations pass by and favoured physiques alter, because the offspring are merely new gene-combinations drawn from the original matrix of possible combinations. (This is intended merely as an explication of the concept of dynamic species, not a definition.) Species are genuine groupings, as well as being useful classificatory devices, because the fact that all members of a species are drawn from the same gene-pool makes it true that, and explains why, reliable anatomical, physiological and behavioural generalizations can be made about them. Morphological similarities are not constitutive of a species as the old typologists thought, but are indices, susceptible of deeper explanation.16 Also, the fact that species are appropriate entities to figure in biological generalizations explains why most languages, including ours, divide up the local fauna and flora into categories that correspond well with species divisions. Pace Quine, taxonomy teaches that philology recapitulates ontology, rather than the other way round.17 15 I borrow this formulation from a paper by F. J. Ayala, 'Teleological Explanations in Evolutionary Biology', in Philosophy of Science, 37, No. i. March 1970. 16 In my necessarily brief treatment of the species concept, a number of problematic issues have had to be skipped. For a fuller picture, see D. L. Hull (i965) and M. Ruse (i969) in Brit. 7. Phil. Science; and Hugh Lehman, Philo- sophy of Science, i967; plus discussions (I970, both journals). 17 W. V. 0. Quine, Word and Object, M.I.T. i960.

Also Quine's essay, 'Natural Kinds' in the collection Ontological Relativity and Other Essays. 44</page><page sequence="11">Darwin, Teleology and Taxonomy Rational taxonomy also yields a justification for the claim that animals are objectively goal-directed towards survival and reproduction, thereby helping to answer the question discussed in section I. The argument is, essentially, that species are groups of goal-directed beings by definition. The rationale for such a definition is as follows: Unless you believe that animals genuinely strive after survival and reproduction, you cannot understand why species developed in the way they did as a response to ecological pressures. If you cannot understand that, then in a real sense you cannot understand what species are. Darwin helped us to understand what they are by exploiting this fact in his theory. It was a presupposition of the account he gave of the mechanism which underpinned the method of genealogical classification; insofar as we accept the method and the mechanism, we must accept the presupposition. To put it another way, the only coherent way of classifying species assumes that they have evolved, and the suggested mechanism of natural selection that explains how evolution occurs presupposes that animals are goal-directed. There have been other suggested mechanisms, such as the inheritance of acquired characteristics, but this also presupposes that they are goal-directed. In any case, as far as we know, Lamarckianism is not correct. Even if there are other factors at work as well, natural selection is a necessary part of the correct account of evolution. Thus, the only coherent way of classifying species requires that animals be goal-directed. Either we drop all attempts to classify species rationally, or we agree that animals are goal-directed. We need to classify, so we are justified in taking the latter course. This somewhat Kantian kind of justification will, admittedly, fail to satisfy the out-and-out sceptic. He will still say that attributing goal- directedness to animals is an unjustified step, since the whole process of evolution can be just as well understood by saying 'These things just happened'. We do not think the process as a whole is goal-directed. Why should we view any sub-process within it as goal-directed? Since we deny that species literally try to survive, we should not say that individual animals try to stay alive either. It just so happens that animals cannot help remaining alive for quite a while, sometimes long enough to produce offspring. It is possible, I think, to undermine such scepticism by a second line of argument, which is also based on taxonomic considerations. It appeals, not to the definition of species or to the possibility of classifying them, but to the definition of organs, and the possibility of comparing them trans- specifically. Essentially, this second argument points out that organs are partially functionally defined, in that it is a necessary condition of an organ's being of the type it is that it should perform or be capable of per- forming some characteristic activity, in the appropriate context and circumstances. What an organ is depends partly on what it does in the living body. This is especially true of neurological structures, like the limbic 45</page><page sequence="12">Andrew Woodfield system, but it is also true of organs with clear anatomical boundaries. The heart of an elephant and the heart of a mouse do not look particularly alike, but they may be compared and they are both called 'hearts', partly because they perform the same job within their respective bodies. A sceptic who rejected all talk of functions would be committed to rejecting much of the established physiological terminology, together with the ability to compare different species by means of these terms. If he does not wish to give them up or redefine them, he must accept that animals strive to survive, because, as I have argued, only on this presupposition does the ascription of functions to particular animal components make sense. Animals, then, are teleological not only in virtue of what they do (viz., struggle to survive), but also in virtue of what they are (viz., working arrangements of organs).18 (III) The Concept of Cultural Evolution It would be nice to link the discussion so far with the third question: What is the relation between biological and cultural evolution? Each of these concepts is the quintessence of an abstraction, so remote from tangible objects that we are not sure what kind of answer is wanted. Wallace, the co-discoverer of natural selection, thought that a different model must be applied to man, owing to his ability to change the environment before it changed him. But in The Descent of Man, Darwin argues that mental ability must have developed as a result of natural selection in the same way as physical characteristics.19 Dobzhansky20 takes the now standard optimist view that biological evolution, though still slowly continuing, is of vastly less immediacy than cultural evolution, which means that man's destiny is in his own hands. Nevertheless, one still feels tempted to ask what exactly the relation is between them. Ought one to think that biological evolution and cultural evolution are antagonistic, or complementary, or indifferent to each other, or is one dependent on the other? Is the question ill-formed, because it wrongly assumes there is a constant relation between them? Perhaps the real situation is that sometimes cultural developments go against biological trends, sometimes hand in hand with them. But then perhaps this is what is meant by saying the two are indifferent to each other, in the sense that they each proceed according to their own indepen- dent laws, and any meshing is coincidental. Surely eugenics, which seems to have a foot in both camps, illustrates that this is far too simplistic. 18 For a detailed argument showing that organs are functionally defined, see M. Beckner's The Biological Way of Thought, Univ. Calif., i968, pp. 112-II8. 19 Darwin (i87i), especially Chapter V. 20 Th.

Environments can be changed to adapt them to people. People can be tailored to environments by genetic manipulation. The current spate of pop-biologyought to have dinned it into everyone that Nature and Culture are like coffee and cream after the cup has been stirred. Perhaps what motivates the question is the idea that there is an un- changing relation between the concepts, whatever the state of play between the processes at any given point in history. Expected answers might be that there is no relation at all, or that one is logically prior to the other. But I find the initial dichotomy misleading right from the start, owing to the fact that it makes one think that two separate processes are being referred to, as if History bifurcated at an early stage into two types of events, biological events and cultural events. Both concepts are used to conjure up the idea of development-not necessarily progressive development, but simply a sequence of changes unfolding. Since both concepts are irreducibly historical, the entities subject to evolution, of whichever sort, must be crystallized out by taxon- omic procedures in terms of their life histories. However, the third question, I believe, remains problematic. Further analysis is blocked by our not fully knowing what 'culture' means. There is no point in saying that 'cultural evolution' means 'the way culture has evolved', since we do not know yet what the cultural units are that are susceptible of evolution. The subject of change is not culture in the abstract, but is some cultural object. Biological evolution is not the way biology has evolved, but the way species have evolved. We know what species are because Darwin told us, but we do not know what corresponds to species and genera and families and orders in the realm of social structures. What are the proper entities to study, what are the appropriate taxa in terms of which we may formulate truly general statements in social science, as Darwin formulated a general theory in biology? My aim is not so much to give an answer, as to interpret the question from a Darwinian perspective, in the hope that some light may be shed on it. I must now, therefore, tie up the main strands of the argument, and show in what sense Wigand was right when he said that Darwinism was like a Naturphilosophie. I have tried to argue that, first, Darwin's theory furnished a general strategy for dealing with the concept of function; second, it helped to define the units of study in zoology through its influence on taxonomy. It did the second partly because it did the first. By treating animals as teleological systems, he provided a rational method for identify- ing and classifying them. He also brought systematic unity to this branch of science. Kant deduced a priori that it could be done; Darwin actually did it. His achievement thus stands out as a possible model to follow in 47</page><page sequence="14">Andrew Woodfield other fields of study, particularly those which need unifying, such as the study of culture. The three questions with which we began, concerning Darwin's treatment of functionality, the alleged axiomatic status of his theory, and the concept of cultural evolution, are therefore linked as follows: the answers to the first two questions suggest a possible method for clarifying the third. Consider once more what the difference was between biological functions and the functions of artefacts, taking 'artefact' widely to mean any object or social structure created or constituted by men. An organ has a function when it conduces to the survival of the organism or species. An artefact has a function when it furthers some purpose of its makers or users. Consider also the fact that all organisms are teleological systems, but not all teleological systems are organisms. Not all systems need to have spatially contiguous parts. For example, a human being plus an artefact, when they stand in a certain reciprocal relationship, can be viewed conjointly as a single system too, in which case the artefact and the man can be said to have functions in the same sense that organs have functions: they both contribute to an end of the whole. Thus, by taking systems with wider boundaries, one can reconceptualize men, or groups of men, and artefacts, as organs. Sometimes such large systems arise as a result of conscious human design, in which case they are artefacts; but sometimes they arise spontaneously. Since the survival of a large organisation need not depend on the survival of any particular individuals in it, it can 'live' longer than human beings. To count as a teleological system with a 'life' of its own, it must be analogous to an organism in respect of having at least one end. The components can properly be said to have functions to the extent that they contribute to its ends. Out of the large number of ways of considering social structures as complex systems of this sort, presumably the best way, following Kant's recommendation, is the way which brings most systematic unity to the whole field. The task would be to chunk up social reality into taxa with the right kind of theoretical interest, about which generalizations could be made. That is, to invent or discover suitable superorganisms, and then to classify them in groupings analogous to species, genera, families and orders. There is reason to believe that the best classificatory scheme could not be as simple as a tree of porphyry. One great difference between biology and social science is that the biological goals can be reduced to two, survival and reproduction, and these are both universal and constant throughout evolution. Cultural goals may not be reducible to two, and they may turn out to be variable. Cynics will wonder whether there ever could be a single scheme with such enormous scope. Perhaps they are right. But this is the vision of social science that follows from adopting a Darwinian methodology. Darwin's legacy, I maintain, consists primarily in the establishment of a rational taxonomy appropriate to a certain range of teleological systems, 48</page><page sequence="15">Darwin, Teleology and Taxonomy namely plants and animals. What his theory suggests, if we take it as a model, is that we might discover a similar taxonomy for more complex systems. To the extent that we shall wish to talk of 'development' and 'evolution' in connection with such systems, they will need a taxonomy appropriate to dynamic entities with life histories. Even when our interests focus on a limited time-slice or frozen moment in their lives, we shall still need diachronic taxonomic categories in order, literally, to identify what we are talking about. Biological taxonomy is the nearest to the required sort that has actually been worked out, though just how near it is remains to be seen. It is this veiled methodological message, more than any direct connection, which makes Darwin relevant to the study of culture. St John's College, Oxford 4 49</page></plain_text>
