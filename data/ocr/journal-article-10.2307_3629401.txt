We will summarize in preliminary fashion some of the research results obtained to date, but our major emphasis is methodological. The inventory technique consists of 24 line drawings that depict specific instrumental activities in three catgeories current on our research site. By instrumental activities we mean those activities that an individual engages in for the achievement and maintenance of a life style and status in the social groups of which he is a mem- ber or aspires to be a member. The technique is applied to the Blood Indian Reserve in Alberta, Canada. It is the largest Canadian reserve, with approximately 3,000 Blood Indians in an area of 540,000 square miles. It is a rich reservation, with unusual resources of well-watered grazing and prime wheat-growing land. A tribal herd and wheat 1 Grateful acknowledgment of support for this research is hereby given to the Stanford School of Education faculty research fund and to the National Institute of Mental Health (small grant MH 07829-01).

A minority of individual Blood Indians have developed substantial holdings of ranch and wheat land, leased from the tribe, and a few Blood have become entrepreneurs. The majority of the Blood get along with summer and fall haying, perhaps a few head of cattle, intermittent seasonal agricultural and ranch work, and some are employed as mechanics, carpenters, and painters. Recently the Canadian government instituted a comprehensive economic development study, as a response to growing popu- lation pressure within the reserve and a growing awareness on the part of both the Blood and government that the resources of the reserve must be exploited more efficiently.2 The Blood community is culturally conservative in that all Blood speak their native language (even though they are bilingual), nearly all the men belong to functioning age-grade societies, the hand-game is the most popular form of gambling, and a relatively large number of individuals own medicine bundles and participate in traditional religious activities. The annual Sun Dance is still held and attracts crowds numbering in the hundreds on the days when the so- cieties put on social dances and give-aways, though the sacred functions of the affair have diminished in recent years and the traditional Horn Society has decreased both in size and in influence. In other respects as well, the contemporary Blood give evidence of con- tinuity with their cultural past. They are still essentially nomadic. Though all the people have houses somewhere on the reserve, they are rarely in them dur- ing the summer months when mobility is maximal. They are traveling, visiting, haying, or going to rodeos. Indian names are still acquired as a result of some unusual incident or adventure. Leadership still falls to the man who acts like a chief--one who does not "lead" in the whiteman sense, but who "helps the people," "always talks friendly with anyone," is generous with his goods as well as his services, and is dignified in his demeanor. Formal social affairs are con- ducted with the grave courtesy and attention to rank that appear to be long- established Blood traits. And in the manner of thinking and judging, as we will make clear later, the Blood as a whole are quite different from whites and this difference seems to be accountable as an influence of the surviving, though at- tenuated traditional culture. But at the same time the Blood community is in some ways progressive. The successful Blood ranchers and farmers serve as influential models. The Blood 2 The authors, in collaboration with Anthony D. Fisher, have recently given a full re- port of the research results obtained from our study of the Blood Reserve, at the request of the Division of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Canada (Spindler 1963).</page><page sequence="3">INSTRUMENTAL ACTIVITIES INVENTORY 3 are notable for their business acumen in tribal dealings with whites. And the numerous tractors, combines, trucks, frigidaires, and other modem household equipment and furnishings indicate that the Blood are not averse to the ma- terial and technological culture of the whiteman, nor even to certain aspects of his value system. These characteristics-the culturally conservative base and the selectively progressive elements-make the reserve community ideal for our purposes. We have been engaged since 1958 in a comparative study of the Blood, researching the psychological adaptations to pressures created by the impact of the whiteman's social and economic system in a situation where there is a high degree of cul- tural homogeneity but where economic differentiation exists, unlike the Menomini case that we studied in depth, where cultural and economic differentiation are concomitant (G. Spindler 1955; L. Spindler 1962). So that we would have data comparable to our Menomini material, we have utilized the same techniques, including the Rorschach Projective Technique, autobiographic interviews, socio- economic schedules, and extensive participant-observation. Notwithstanding the collection of these comparable data from 1958 through 1961 we have felt that we did not fully understand how the Blood perceived either themselves or the whiteman and his system. It was to this end that we developed the Instrumental Activities Inventory. We selected that aspect of social action that we felt to be most directly and operationally relevant to the way in which a Blood individual behaves as he attempts to cope with the realities of life in his own environ- ment-the activities instrumental to his achievement and maintenance of life styles and socio-economic statuses recognizable and, in varying degrees, valued in the domain of the Blood community. The I.A.I., as we shall henceforth term the research technique, is in part a projective technique in the tradition of the Thematic Apperception Test and the several picture techniques that have been developed recently by others, and in part a way of cataloguing the perceptual and cognitive dimensions most directly related to the economic and social behavior of Blood individuals and the Blood community as it moves at an accelerating rate into the Albertan version of the western industrial and urban world. THEORETICAL ORIENTATION In what has been said up to this point there are certain implications con- cerning the theoretical position taken in this research, and particularly with respect to the rationale for the I.A.I. We will lay these out more explicitly now.3 3 We are indebted to many sources for the ideas that have co-mingled in our theoretical position in this section and elsewhere in this paper. The works of A. Irving Hallowell have</page><page sequence="4">4 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY The social system and cultural patterning (which we will combine into "sociocultural system") characteristic of a group are represented in, though never identical with, the cognitive maps, perceptual structuring, affective con- trols, values, and ego defenses of individuals in the group. Each individual's psychological system is different in some degree from that of any other person, depending upon idiosyncratic life experience and constitutional variability. Both the derivation of this psychological structure and the social expression of it are, however, bounded and supported by sociocultural norms. As changes in the conditions of survival occur, the established sociocultural system breaks down in some degree and its effectiveness as a set of instrumen- talities for survival is vitiated. Under the conditions of rapid or disjunctive ac- culturation the requirements of the traditional system tend to become dysfunc- tional and therefore threatening to the individual who is trying to adapt to the new situation. The binding of established directives for behavior upon the indivi- dual becomes loosened. New alternatives are perceived and reacted to differently by different individuals. The perceived range of these alternatives and the selections made from it are decisively influenced by a psychological organization that is most likely to be functionally congruent with sociocultural instrumen- talities that have lost their validity; or by a psychological organization that has been eroded by uncertainty and disjunctive experience in a deteriorating social milieu, but still retains some degree of continuity with the old sociocultural system. The resulting behavior of the acculturating individual seems irrational or goal-less. In order to better understand the genesis and functional character of be- havior in these situations we feel that psychological concepts, tools, and methods must be utilized. The psychological as well as the sociocultural processes must be understood, as individuals perceive and grope toward new solutions that re- quire reorganization of thinking and feeling, and that are in part a product of this reorganization. It is for these reasons that we have utilized the Rorschach and have developed the I.A.I. We certainly do not regard these or any other "instruments" as a sufficient armamentarium for field work on culture change: we have given contextual meaning to the data collected with these tools through extensive ob- been particularly influential in the course of all our work with both the Menomini and the Blood. Our thinking about the interrelationship between psychological and social systems has been directly influenced by Robert K. Merton, Talcott Parsons, and David Riesman. Bruno Klopfer has taught us most of what we know about projective techniques. Most recently we have benefited directly from the following writings: Kaplan 1957, 1961; Collier 1957; Gold- schmidt 1959; Lindzey 1961; Cohen 1961; Spiro 1961; Weinstock 1963; Inkeles 1958; French 1963; Wallace 1961.</page><page sequence="5">INSTRUMENTAL ACTIVITIES INVENTORY 5 servations of individuals and groups in social action, personal documents of various kinds, and many interviews as well as ecological, demographic, and his- torical data. The Rorschach we regard as valuable in providing a means of gathering information concerning the individual's organization and control of intellectual and emotional resources. It is an abstract and admittedly cryptic map of this organization, but our experience with the Menomini and now with the Blood, and the congruence of Rorschach results with the contextual data we have on each community, convince us that it is a valuable source of information about this organization that is not as directly available by other means. The I.A.I. gives us quite different information. It gives us information on the cognitive orientations pervasively influencing the individual's perception of and response to social reality. At a more discrete level the I.A.I. gives us specific, operational perceptions of social reality organized normatively in means-end relationships. We believe that the most useful dimensions of social reality, for our pur- poses, are structured into instrumental roles that prescribe activity related to specific and valued social goals. For whiteman society the most significant instru- mental activities are those represented in the occupational structure. Becom- ing a mechanic, an M.D., or a teacher is an avenue to achievement of a place in the social system with more or less predictable rewards in prestige and economic security. In Blood Indian society the instrumental activities are not usually oc- cupations, as we think of them. Being a "chicken or fancy dancer" is not an occupation, nor is becoming a chief or a medicine man; but they are avenues to recognition in the Blood community. Haying is an activity that has specific rewards; it does not contribute to prestige unless one becomes a middleman for other hayers, but it results in subsistence and a few drinks and helps one to main- tain his self-respect. Blood Indians know well the instrumental activities and the goals to which they are instrumental that are everyday and current in the Blood community. They know less about the occupational roles that are instrumental to rewards in whiteman society, for they have few prototypic experiences that would allow for learning the appropriate perceptual and cognitive organization, to say noth- ing of the skills necessary to carry them out. Nevertheless, they are aware of the general prestige hierarchy to which whiteman occupations are instrumental, and they have acquired generalized cognitive and motivational orientations toward whiteman occupations without acquiring the detailed knowledge of the central and peripheral role requirements associated with them. They have also acquired misperceptions of occupational roles and their complex requirements.</page><page sequence="6">6 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY We have therefore developed the I.A.I. as a means of engaging more directly those dimensions of psychological structure that are most influential in determin- ing how the Blood will cope with current social reality. We believe that the technique can be developed and applied in any society, irrespective of degree of acculturation, since all social systems must provide instrumental activities. But the real value of the I.A.I. for us lies in its application to situations where dis- junctive instrumental expectations, stemming from two systems quite alien to each other in origin but converging in the same field of social action and achieve- ment, are present and perceived. It is here that we can see most clearly how the individual chooses from possible alternatives-what he chooses, his ordering of his choices, and how he thinks about them. THE I.A.I. AND THE RESEARCH PROCEDURE Within the Blood community there are three major classes of instrumental activities: 1) those which are instrumental within the framework of the most traditional aspects of Blood culture, such as being a medicine man, medicine. bundle owner, participating in giveaways, dancing Indian style, etc.; 2) those which are instrumental in the Blood community in its more contemporary and less traditional aspects, such as participating in rodeos, haying, working with stock, being a political leader, etc.; and 3) those which are instrumental within the terms imposed by the western economy and social system, such as being a white collar worker, an M.D., a mechanic, an entrepreneur, etc. Certain of this last class of activities, such as being a mechanic or white collar worker, are available in the contemporary community. Others, such as being an M.D., repre- sent activities to which some Blood Indians, particularly the younger generation, may aspire, and of which most Blood are aware, but for which no models exist in the Blood community. The I.A.I. is built around these three classes. Twenty-four line drawings repre- senting Indians engaged in activities representing these three classes were drawn by Mr. Gerald Tailfeathers, a professional Blood Indian artist who knows the reservation community and the people within it intimately. The activities repre- sented were selected from a broad range of possibilities on the basis of interviews with the Blood themselves, and on the basis of our own knowledge of the com- munity. The drawings are made in such a way that circumstantial detail is eliminated and only the essential features of the activity are retained. The stimulus is concrete, but the lack of circumstantial detail focuses attention upon the activity itself. The stimulus value is very different from that of the Rorschach ink-blot test or the Thematic Apperception Technique, not only in its more nar-</page><page sequence="7">INSTRUMENTAL ACTIVITIES INVENTORY 7 row domain but also in that the stimuli presented are as unambiguous as possible. The subject must understand what the activity is that he is supposed to talk about. The stimulus value is also quite different from that presented to the respondent by the photographic interview technique developed by John Collier (1957), in that specific individuals and surroundings are not represented, so that highly interpersonal interpretations of community life and personalities within it are not elicited. We attempt, therefore, to present the respondent with realistic, concrete activities, instrumental in his setting but decontextualized from the concrete referents of time, place, and person. Four I.A.I. drawings are presented in Fig. 1 as examples. The complete list of activities includes the following: car- penter, farming, mechanic, boxing, branding calves, artist, bronc rider, chicken dancer, barber, haying, oil rig, calf roping, investiture (formal chief-making), cook, medicine man, politician, M.D., office worker, storekeeper, bartender, milk- ing (dairy), priest, mixed marriage, nurse. Indians are the subjects in each drawing, excepting in the case of the politician, who is speaking to a mixed group of whites and Indians, and in the "mixed marriage" situation, where an Indian male is shown marrying a white female. All of the drawings portray males, ex- cepting the politician's crowd, the bride in the marriage situation, and the nurse. Our techniques of administration were simple. We tried in all cases to stimu- late the respondent to choose at least three activities which he (or she) valued most highly and an equal number that he disliked the most. We asked for a response to each of the 24 pictured activities and tried to maintain an open-ended stance to encourage free association. At the end of each administration we asked the respondent to make value-oriented choices from pairs or trios of activities that we selected on the basis of the interview up to that point and probed with questions and comments designed to activate further response that would give us information about the way the subject viewed the activities and the ends to be obtained through them. We asked all female respondents to choose what they would like their sons or husbands (depending upon age and family status) to do. The instrument elicited response freely and seemed to "make sense" to respondents. No individual failed to complete the inventory, once he or she started, and no persons refused to respond to it when requested. We collected responses to the I.A.I. from 48 males and 34 females ranging in age from 18 to 87 years of age and representing all known socio-economic, religious, and other groupings current in the contemporary Blood community. Of these 72 respondents, 50 are people to whom we administered the Rorschach and whom we had interviewed in our previous field research. It was intentional that as much overlap of samples would be obtained as possible, so that we would</page><page sequence="8">FIG. 1. Four examples of I. A.

Like most tools, our research instrument is a lineal descendant of others. Many anthropologists have used Henry Murray's Thematic Apperception Test in cross-cultural applications, along with and separate from the Rorschach and a few other projective techniques. As we have stated, the I.A.I. is broadly related to all of these techniques in that the user must make the assumption that what people say in response to visual stimuli bears some significant relationship to their psychic organization, on the one hand, and to their behavior, on the other. We believe that the I.A.I. responses are more directly related to actual behavior than the responses generated by the other projective techniques commonly used in anthropological field research. Starting with William E. Henry's development of a modified T.A.T. for use with Hopi and Navaho (Henry 1947) there have been a number of other such modifications of the basic Murray cards for research with American In- dian, Micronesian, Japanese, and African samples. The assumptions and pur- poses of the researchers using these modifications are basically similar to those employed by workers who have used the original T.A.T. in anthropological research.5 These modifications, however, approach the I.A.I. in that they are attempts to make the stimuli operationally meaningful in the context of the respondent. They suffer methodologically in the fact that it is very difficult to analog the original Murray T.A.T. interpersonal situations in variable cultural contexts, so the value that might be claimed for standardization of stimuli is destroyed. The Rorschach technique offers a better opportunity for standardiza- tion of stimuli, since the inkblots themselves are acultural. We will make no attempt to review the many ancestors of the I.A.I.6 but will make some comparative remarks covering a technique developed by Walter Goldschmidt and Robert Edgerton for the study of values (1961), applied to 4 Anthony Fisher has collected responses from 40 more males, ranging in age from 14 to 25 years, in a separate but closely related study of the young Blood and their special prob- lems of adaptation. Morgan Maclachan and Gene Reese have collected 80 protocols from the closely related but much more acculturated (and "disorganized") Montana Blackfeet. These data are being analyzed. This paper deals only with the data collected by the Spindlers. 5 The reader will find a useful summary of these modifications in Barnouw 1963:263-275. 6 But see particularly articles by Jacob Fried (1954) and Seymour Parker (1964), since they share with Goldschmidt and Edgerton, and with the Spindlers, a focus upon social action.</page><page sequence="10">10 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY the Menomini Indians of Wisconsin, using the Spindler sample of sociocultural categories in the framework of the broad acculturative continuum defined in our work with this group. Goldschmidt and Edgerton claim as the most important difference between their technique and the T.A.T. that they are attempting to measure culturally established patterns of behavior rather than individual per- sonality dynamics, and assume that " . .. it is possible to elicit value statements from representative personnel by presenting them with a consistent choice situation between alternate modes of action" (28). Edgerton administered a set of eleven cards to a sample of 44 males. Each card presented two alternatives in value choices within the picture on the single card. For example, a man and woman with a child between them are shown looking into store windows. The man is looking at a display of rifles. The woman is looking at new furniture. In another picture two males are fishing with their shoes off, reclining on the banks of the river, while off in the distance five other men are going to work in the sawmill. Goldschmidt and Edgerton obtained significant variations in the responses of Menomini individuals for the various acculturative categories. The I.A.I. and the picture technique for the study of values exhibit cer- tain features in common, and of the various inventions of this general type by anthropologists we owe the most to this antecedent experiment. The I.A.I. and the rationale for it are different from their technique in certain important respects, however. Our focus upon instrumental activities leads us, we think, to a more total conception of the individual's relationship to his social environment, past and present. We are asking how the respondent organizes his perceptions of a wide range of instrumental alternatives available in his community and its sur- roundings. We are asking how he views the whiteman system of instrumentalities, not only in terms of its specific values, but with respect to the means as well as the ends of social action and their organized relationship, and we are asking the same question about his view of the traditional Blood Indian system and the contemporary Blood community. And finally we see the individual's response as giving us information about his cognitive management of perceived social realities, which we believe is the most influential dimension of his psychological system. Each of our pictures represents only one instrumental activity. We want to avoid imposing dichotomous choices upon the respondent in the stimulus frame of a single picture. The picture study technique may create some false dichotomies -between, for example, ease vs. industry, group participation vs. solitude, guns vs. furniture, buying drinks vs. groceries. Possibly neither the Blood nor the less acculturated Menomini think this way. They operate in a situation where a</page><page sequence="11">INSTRUMENTAL ACTIVITIES INVENTORY 11 medley of choices is available to them. The sociocultural system of each of these communities is made up of many parts. In the Blood community there are Pan- Indian features, attenuated patterns of the traditional culture, elements surviving from recent historical periods (e.g., frontiersman and the old-time cowboy), others from different segments of contemporary whiteman society (e.g., residential schools and school teachers, rodeo hands, used-car salesmen). The Blood cope with life on a day-to-day basis, drawing from the cultural fund available to them as needed. The I.A.I. presents 24 specific instrumental alternatives from which the respondent can choose in any order and with any emphasis he wishes. We "force" some choices between pairs and trios of drawings, but only on the basis of explicit or clear implicit comparative choices made by the respondent after he has had the opportunity of free choice. Even then we experience some difli- culty, for the Blood respondents at least are likely to say that both activities are good--"it depends." Goldschmidt and Edgerton's statement, that adequately designed photographs "... would be ideal for our purposes as we are trying to simulate reality" (1961:28), would not be true in our application. We want to avoid personaliza- tion, so that each respondent can project into the instrumental activity his own values and cognitive organization. Photographs are too specific about places, persons, and objects for our purposes. The I.A.L pictures are, however, not drawn with fuzzy lines or ambiguous detail. Each item in the picture must be technically correct or the respondent becomes so concerned about the technical mistake that he fails to project much of anything but this concern. And the respondent must know what instrumental activity is being pictured. But the I.A.I. pictures are depersonalized and decontextualized as far as specific per- sonnel and locations are concerned. Goldschmidt and Edgerton quite correctly suggest, in our opinion, that anthropologists should invent their own research techniques rather than slavishly adopt those created by psychologists for use in our own society; at least this is true if the purposes of the anthropologist in a given situation make the psy- chologist's tools inappropriate. Their assumption that the pictures have to be redrawn for every culture case is not, we believe, applicable to the I.A.I. We will be testing the applicability of the present set of drawings to other situations in the high prairie area of Canada soon. We believe that one can design sets of instrumental activities for culture areas subsuming a number of variant indivi- dual cases. And in our usage, the whiteman-oriented activities remain approx- imately constant even as we move out of the culture area of North America for which they were designed. Furthermore, instrumental activities are not as diffi-</page><page sequence="12">12 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY cult to identify as are specific value choices. They are among the most ap- parent, manifest aspects of any social system. Consequently a researcher should be able to identify the relevant activities fairly quickly and use such a technique early in his research, provided that the technical difficulties of drawing and re- producing the pictures can be overcome. With the rationale for the I.A.I. established, we can now move on to con- sider some of the preliminary results obtained through its use. SOME RESEARCH RESULTS Preliminary analysis of the I.A.I. data collected by the Spindlers on the Blood has to date centered upon three objectives: 1) to discover how evaluative choices of instrumental alternatives are related to antecedent experience; 2) to describe the specific values projected into the rationales given for choices by our respondents; 3) to isolate persistent cognitive orientations that pervade the specific perceptions and evaluations of instrumental activities. We will discuss selected data and their implications relevant to each objective summarily. By "antecedent experience" we refer to such variables as sex (male vs. female), extent and type of formal schooling, socio-economic status, religious affiliation, socialization in tradition-oriented vs. "progressive" households, exclu- sive on-reservation work experience vs. off-reservation work experience, and par- ticipation in various informal associations. We have analyzed our data so far with respect to the first four variables. Statistical analysis of the data (chi square and independent proportions tests) relevant to our first objective indicates that reliable differences do appear between parts of the sample divided by sex, socio-economic status, and education. Sex differences in choices of most valued instrumental activities appeared in eleven out of twenty-four possibilities. Without regard for the specific choices made, males appear to be oriented more towards activities current and instrumental within the existent reserve community. Women appear to be oriented more to- wards movement into whiteman society. The men also choose more high-risk activities. Women choose more passive ones (for their sons or husbands). Males are also more pragmatic in their choices, selecting the things that a man actually can do on the reserve and for which there are concrete models. The women are less reality-centered and more aspiration-oriented. Socio-economic differences in choices of most valued instrumental activities appeared in ten out of twenty-four possibilities. The differences are in the di- rection that one might expect. Upper status men choose more frequently those activities that require goal-orientedness on whiteman terms and that are acquisi-</page><page sequence="13">INSTRUMENTAL ACTIVITIES INVENTORY 13 tively oriented in an economic sense. Lower status men more frequently chose activities that are economically unproductive and irrelevant to goal attainment or status on whiteman terms.7 The sample of males was also tested with respect to differences in distribu- tion of responses according to education. Highest grade obtained was used as the differentiating criterion; those with a fifth grade level or less and those having a sixth grade level of attainment or more constituted the two categories. This cutting point produced four significant differences, with more from the higher education group choosing mechanic and artist, and more from the lower education group choosing haying and bronc rider. While the differences thus obtained make a certain amount of sense, they are not impressive. Education, at least using the criteria indicated, is a weak variable. This may be due to the fact that most of the men in our sample received a residential (on-reserve) school education, so that their perceptions of instrumen- tal activities and asociated values relevant to and functional in the existing re- serve community are probably reinforced. Parker (1964) also found that years of schooling was a weak variable unless only the highest and lowest grade attainment groups were used. Our sample of these extremes is not large enough to permit statistical tests to be applied. We plan to enlarge the sample in these categories and retest the variable again. Religious differences-membership in the Anglican church, the Catholic church, and the Horn Society-were tested. No significant differences were dis- covered. This suggests that the factionalism and differences of opinion associated with religious affiliation do not run deep in a matrix of differences in values. The Blood Indian identity apparently transcends religious factionalism in those areas of outlook and value that are most instrumental in secular social action. The female sample was tested for internal differentiation, using the same variables as in the tests of the male sample. No significant differences and no marked tendencies toward differentiation were discovered. We may conclude from this that the females are more homogeneous in outlook and value orientations than are the males, since the latter are internally differentiated in relatively higher degree. This was our hypothesis, based on our observations among the Menomini 7 We divided the whole sample into four socio-economic groups on the basis of house type, condition, furnishings, subsistence pattern, possessions (farm and ranch equipment, cat- tle, land, etc.) collected on a socio-economic index schedule. Here we have compared the two upper status groups to the two lower status groups. A comparison of the socio-economic extremes would show sharper difference in instrumental choices. Using the present cutting point produces six differences at a P of .05 or less and four that are close to .05. We are probably safe in regarding these latter as significant, since they are consistent (in kinds of choices made) with the rest.</page><page sequence="14">14 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY (Spindler and Spindler 1958). The rationale here is that males take the public instrumental roles available in the social system. These roles are differentiated in the demands they make upon individual men. In meeting these demands males adopt the appropriate and functional values. This is particularly true in a male- oriented society, and the Blood Indian society can be described as one. The analysis of data relevant to the second objective, that of describing the specific values projected into the rationales for choices by our respondents, has only begun. So far we have remained close to the data, allowing our value categories to grow inductively as we check through individual responses. The distribution of specific values in each group analyzed so far suggests that a great deal of overlap occurs with some differences reflecting the status and ex- perience of individuals in each group. This accords with our general hypothesis that the Blood community is relatively homogeneous in its basic cultural substrata. The most native-oriented subjects of our sample place a high value on keep- ing up one's physical appearance, dancing and participating in traditional activi- ties, being active and physically strong, helping others, and "talking nice." They disvalue looking awkward or ridiculous, disfiguring the face or crippling the body, getting cheated, telling someone else what to do or getting told, and being "smart" or "cocky." These specific values coincide nicely with what we are led to expect from the descriptions of traditional Blood culture. The young Blood in our sample (ages 18 to 26) value making good money, working outdoors and being active physically, obtaining excitement and thrills, particularly in rodeo competition, being able to fix things oneself (fixing a car or tractor, fixing up a house). Only a minority see such skills as leading to status achievement; and only three of the fifteen in the sample see such skills as a channel for adaptation to the outside world. They also value being independent; but at the same time they value "easy work" (a job with "sure money" and one that does not require much effort). They disvalue getting crippled or dis- figured, telling other people what to do or getting told, and giving up personal freedoms of any sort--they reject confinement. It is interesting that the overlap between the tradition-oriented sample, in- cluding a majority of men over fifty, and the young Blood (18-25 years old), who have been exposed to supposedly critical acculturative experience during the formative period of their lives, should be so great. The hypothesis for under- lying homogeneity is reinforced. The socio-economic elite, men who run large ranches or are successful entre- preneurs, value the following: being one's "own boss" (having own herd, own</page><page sequence="15">INSTRUMENTAL ACTIVITIES INVENTORY 15 business, not working for someone else); working outdoors "in the open air"; making money, "sure money"; working hard and planning ahead; being strong and healthy; keeping some traditions, particularly language. They disvalue get- ting hurt or crippled, being "cooped up with a desk job," "politicking," being told what to do. The striving for independence in this elite group is consistent with that of the other two groups, as is the concern for being healthy, vigorous, and outdoors. Their conception of independence is different, however, from that expressed by the others. They think of it as a state to be gained by hard work and planning ahead, by acquiring goods and economic security. This appears to be a necessary value orientation, given their success. Their concern with keeping some tradi- tions is interesting, since it is not strong among the younger men. They perceive traditions as something valuable and self-identifying which is being lost, while many of the young Blood perceive traditions as merely a barrier to acceptance by the dominant society. In the distribution of specific values revealed in the rationales given by respondents for their choices of instrumental activities, one can see, on the one hand, large areas of overlap which apparently reflect cultural homogeneity and, on the other, certain areas of differentiation appropriate to the demands of different roles and life goals subsumed by sub-systems within the Blood com- munity as a whole. We can now move to what are to us the most interesting results of our analysis to date--the cognitive orientations that pervade specific perceptions and evaluations of instrumental activities. We think of these orientations as repre- senting significant organizational principles operative in the Blood Indian man- agement of perceived social reality. They are integrating principles that, though rarely explicitly verbalized as general principles by Blood Indians, directly in- fluence behavior in its concrete and highly specific dimensions, and particularly with respect to the selection and management of instrumental alternatives in their acculturative adaptation. We eliminated the female sample from the analysis. The females are, indeed, most homogeneous but do not represent the major instrumental orientations for the reasons stated. We were thus left with a sample of 43 males. Our analysis required the making of inferential judgments concerning categories of cognitive orientation subsuming individual responses. We attempted to keep the categories as close to the data as possible, and we believe that the derivative relationships are clear. The reader can judge for himself, as we have included a sample of responses subsumed by each cognitive orientation below.</page><page sequence="16">16 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY AUTONOMY: Every man is his own boss. No one has the right to tell anyone else what to do. One is answerable only for his own actions. (Each of the examples below is an individual response from a separate protocol.) Examples (desk worker) Okay if he's [son] qualified. But I can't push them into any- thing they don't want. (bronc rider) One of my boys does this. I used to tell him he might get get hurt. It's a dangerous job. But I can't tell them they have to quit. They do as they want. (mixed marriage) It's up to their own judgment. We're not communists-to have somebody tell them what to do. This a free country! (chicken dancer) They [sons] were not interested, and I don't try to coax anyone. I was a great dancer in my day. Now I just go there and walk around. (politician) I don't like to . . . I'd rather keep out of politics. I don't think I have the . . . a politician has to be aggressive. They try to change people's ways, or their thinking, and I think people should do their own thinking. (desk worker) [The subject was speaking of his son's graduating from high school. I ask him, "What is he going to do?" Response:] I dunno, I didn't ask him. ACTIVITY AND HEALTH: An active, vigorous, outdoor life is good. It keeps one young and healthy. (storekeeper vs. carpenter) I like the building. It's wonderful. I like to keep moving all the time. It makes you healthy, makes you lively. If you just sit all the time it makes you old. I'm sixty and I can run ten miles. Keep moving, keep lively. (haying) It's my favorite work. It's hard work, but it's a good job--it makes you strong. (desk worker) I don't mind. It's a source of income. But I don't like being cooped up. I'd be sitting there day after day, especially in the summer- time. But if I had no choice, I'd do it. But being a mechanic, I'd be moving around on the job. PRIDE IN PHYSICAL APPEARANCE (AND HEALTH): The physical body should be kept intact and unmarred. Appearance as well as function is important. (boxer) A guy could get killed and all marked up. It destroys your physical features. Your face can get scarred up doing this. Your nose can get all smashed up. (bronc rider) You can lose your body doing this. All you get out of it is broken bones. Some people get crippled for life. Nothing in it, just risk getting hurt. You can get crippled for life this way. KEEPING TRADITIONS AND IDENTITY: Being an Indian makes one different. An Indian is always an Indian. There is value in keeping this identity, and there is something to the old beliefs, even though they are dying out.</page><page sequence="17">INSTRUMENTAL ACTIVITIES INVENTORY 17 (investiture) That man who did that last year for the white man [Canadian dignitaries at Sun Dance] is dead. It's dangerous. (medicine man) Yeah, that . . . ne time I go, when I hurt my back. He sing, drum over me. Yeah, it helped, yup. (medicine man) Ahhh . . . they're not . . . just a few of them now. There is five or six of them now. Oh yes, they have some power . . . oh yes! [Tells about specific medicine men on reserve and what they do.] But ac- cording to the younger generation you just go to a doctor and get all butchered up when something goes wrong. [Tells story about prairie bird's wing to remove cancerous growth from temple of patient.] (chicken dancer) I'd want at least one of my sons to do it. I don't want to lose the Indian language altogether, and this helps. Not that I'd want him to go back to Indian ways. But we're Indians. At least one of us should dance, and we should keep our language. (chicken dancer) I think quite a bit about this. My race . . . I think we should keep this up. Our kids go to MacLeod, and we wanted to make a float [for the centennial] to show the people that we still want to keep our Indian ways. An Indian will always be an Indian. No matter if I go off to Europe, I'll be an Indian. In some ways I'll be different, even if I'm well educated. (medicine man) In the field of medicine I think the white man's medicine has proven to be a better thing. But there is something to the Indian medicine. My father had a nosebleed and couldn't stop it. He went to [- an Indian doctor]. She said we'd have to take him out of the hospital and we did, and she stopped the bleeding. To this day my Dad hasn't had a nosebleed. Low TENDENCY TOWARDS STEREOTYPIC THINKING: Each situation to be judged on its own merits. Avoid sweeping generalizations. (politician) If what he is saying is okay and not against the Indian, then it's okay. Some white men say pretty good . . . other times they put Indian in a bad place, or do something to him-then I'm against him. (medicine man) The doctors [M.D.'s] are good at operating. But for some sicknesses the Indian doctors are good and can cure them. Different sicknesses, different herbs and doctors to cure them. (politician) It's all right . . . Some people don't know nothing. But telling peoples what to do . . . that could be bad or good. It depends on what they tell them. IMMEDIACY AND PRACTICALITY: It is good to have skills because they can be used on the spot, to keep things running well, not for distant goal-oriented achievements. Direct, immediate, practical applications are valued. This orientation is connected with the value placed upon autonomy. Skills make it possible to be autonomous, and to survive and maintain one's self independently. But the concept of autonomy and</page><page sequence="18">18 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY independence is not related (as it would be more often with white men) to achieve- ment of a secure place in the socio-economic structure through an occupation. (mechanic) A farmer has got to know how to overhaul a tractor. (cook) That's pretty good. If it's like me, my wife is going to the hospital. I'll be all alone. It's good to learn that. You'll be cooking everything you want to eat. Or else you've got to get someone to cook, and pay them. (farming: picture of tractor plowing) I sure would like to have my own tractor and work with it . . . I could cut hay, plow, pull hay racks and trailers, attach a post hole driller . . . . (milking) I might use cows for my own use. I'd like to have the milk and butter for my use. (mechanic) I'd rather be a mechanic than this farmer. There's not much good money in crops. A mechanic gets $2 or $3 an hour, and it's handy to have. You don't have to take your car to a garage, you can fix it yourself. (milking) Very handy--milking cows. Make butter, milk. We usually had two cows back home. It's nice to have your own milk. ELITE PRACTICALITY (response from elite socio-economic group): What one likes best to do is not always the practical thing to do. One should think of the pos- sibilities in a long-range perspective, and be practical about what is best. (The difference between the responses from the socio-economic elite, and the practical orientation of the majority of the sample is that the former put the practical con- siderations in a long-range perspective. But they are still practical.) (bronc rider) This is a rough trade. I did it for ten years. I quit before I got busted up. I guess it's all right if you're single all your life. I wouldn't encourage him [son]. Some of these cowboys aren't worth anything for any kind of work. They're lazy. And after the season is over they can't do anything for any kind of work. They aren't good for anything.(?) The money and the excitement. But if you go to Calgary it costs $100 for entry fees and $100 to live there a week. In the same time you could put up 100 tons of hay. (haying) I love it! The smell of the hay, working out on the prairie, every- thing. [He was asked, "But why didn't you choose it as a favorite?" Response:] Because it's too seasonal. I wouldn't choose it as a way of earning a living. (desk work-chooses this activity but talked about branding and ranch work more) [I asked, "If you could make the same money at both, which would you choose?" Response:] I'd rather do this ranch work. I was good at it. I started off rassling calves, at the bottom. This guy [in picture] is a professional. I get good at it, do this. The other [desk work] has more in- come. This work [branding], you gotta be strong, healthy, good at it. But you always got in the back of your mind--you might get hurt. Then you're out of it. This kind [office work] you always got a good income.</page><page sequence="19">INSTRUMENTAL ACTIVITIES INVENTORY 19 LITERALITY: What is, is; what will be, no man knows. Choices are limited by reality. Conditional and conjectural thinking are severely limited. (tractor) When you get tired on a tractor, you can fall asleep. When you fall off, you get killed. (branding) [Subject does not choose this picture as a favorite but shows evidence elsewhere in the protocol of liking ranch work and being familiar with it. So I asked him why he didn't choose it. Response:] In the olden days I did branding like that [calves]. But now I keep horses and have no cattle. I brand only horses. [He didn't have cattle so could not choose the picture of a man branding calves.] (haying) I'm one of the hay workers on the prairie. I have the rake, the mower, the team, and the rack. I can make money. [ I asked him to choose between haying and ranching. Response:] I have all that I need for hay- ing. I do that. [He could not choose what he could not do. He could not think conditionally.] (chicken dancer) When I was fifteen I used to dance. I liked it very much. ["But why didn't you choose it as a favorite?"] I am old now [50] and I can't dance. ["How about your sons?"] What they want to do ... if they want to dance . . . I have no opinion about what they want. [He could not choose what he could not do. He could not venture an opinion about what anyone else would like to do, for he did not know. He could not think conditionally or conjecture.] COMMENT: At first we asked middle-aged men to select what they would like to do if they were twenty years old and starting out again. We gave this up after a few trials because men would choose only pictures of activities they could actually perform when they were twenty, even though later on they had acquired skills that made it possible to do other things. They could not retrospect conditionally any more than they can project into the present and future conditionally. Things are as they are, or were as they were. This is a marked characteristic in many responses. Most Blood simply do not engage in conditional thinking. Despite four previous periods of field work and our Rorschach sample, we had not understood this before. This orientation has significant meaning for any economic development plan. These orientations are together a statement of the Blood Indian cognitive system: autonomy, activity, keeping identity, non-stereotypic thinking, immediacy and prac- ticality, and literality. It is a cognitive system that is decidedly divergent from that which is an integral part of western culture. The latter system overlaps with that of the Blood in certain areas. There is, for instance, value placed upon keeping healthy and active, and being independent, but the quality of this pattern is quite different in western culture. The essential differences which characterize the whiteman system as against the Blood Indian system are the long-range achievement orientation, the orientation towards the future, and the strong tendency to project goal-orientations through conditional and conjectural thinking characteristic of the former. The Blood live in and think about the world as it seems to them to be. Western man lives in the world to a larger extent as he would like it to be and thinks it should be.</page><page sequence="20">20 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY CONCLUDING REMARKS We are not ready for a detailed discussion of what the I.A.I. technique has taught us about the Blood in comparison to the information and understanding afforded through our Rorschach sample. We have not yet finished the exhaustive collating and analysis of Rorschach data from our 118 cases that will be neces- sary. A few remarks can be made at this time, however. The two techniques inter-grade. The Rorschach responses of the Blood are characteristically non-abstract. The Blood perceive real objects, people, or animals in the ink-blots, usually in an action context, the meaning ascribed to them is concrete and specific, and they usually encompass relatively small, sharp details in the ink-blots. This pattern is in sharp contradistinction to that most common among Menomini. The latter, particularly the less acculturated, are inclined to either project rather generalized percepts or use the ink-blots as a point of departure for philosophical ruminations; their perceptions of people as well as things are usually in a passive context, and they favor combinatory whole re- sponses or large details and do not fixate on small details. The features of Blood responses described are congruent with what the I.A.I. has revealed about their thinking, particularly with respect to the orientations concerning activity, low tendency toward stereotypic thinking, immediacy and practicality, and literality. The Blood also make extensive use of the brightly colored parts of the ink- blots. More than 70% of the Blood protocols contain dramatic uses of color as a significant determinant in the formation of percepts. This implies, if we accept in general the ascribed psychological meaning of color usage, that the Blood are emotionally open and capable of aggressive emotional behavior. This is very true of the Blood in everyday behavior. We were jolted by the difference between the Blood and the Menomini when we first started to work in Canada. The Blood "talk nicely"; but they are frank, accessible, and aggressive in inter- personal relations when one once gets beyond the facade that is usually put up for white strangers. The Menomini are comparatively very passive, extremely reluctant to expose themselves emotionally, and never aggressive excepting under the influence of alcohol. The relationship of this feature of Blood Rorschach responses (and of behavior) to the I.A.I. responses is less direct, but seems to us to be congruent with the activity orientation and the hierarchy of specific values concerning vigorous, non-passive instrumental roles. Other aspects of Blood Rorschach responses, while not necessarily discon- gruent with I.A.I. responses, appear to tap different orders of psychological structuring. The Blood, for example, appear to display a larger concentration of percepts in the human movement area, rather than in the animal movement area</page><page sequence="21">INSTRUMENTAL ACTIVITIES INVENTORY 21 modally characteristic of the Menomini. At the lowest level of inference this suggests that the Blood are interested in people and their activities (even though they will not talk about their fellows to outsiders). They are anthropomorphic rather than zoomorphic in their world view. If so, this correlates with the intense Blood interest in visiting and in group participation. Both the Menomini and the Blood value autonomy, but the Blood do not surrender their autonomy or individuality to the group. They just seem to take pleasure in being with peo- ple, and the bigger the crowd, the better. The Menomini are much more in- clined to solitude, and even when together (in the native-oriented group) one has the feeling that each individual is solitary. The tone of Blood life is tumultous, brawling, and exciting compared to the quiet, self-contained charac- ter of Menomini life. The Rorschach may give us an understanding of the psychological resources utilized and channeled in the instrumental choices made in response to the I.A.I. The Rorschach, we believe, moves us further back into the personality structure of the Blood than does the I.A.I.-into the psychic control areas, the manage- ment of anxiety and of emotions as well as the intellectual organization, and into the respondent's fantasy life. The I.A.I. moves us directly into the area of the respondent's cognitive management of perceived social realities. Now that we have the I.A.I. data we do not see how we could have done without it. But we would be reluctant to forego the understandings that the Rorschach data seem capable of giving us, despite their problematic character. If we had to choose one or the other technique at the present time, we would choose the I.A.I. because it told us so much that we did not know, systematized much that we did know, and moved us into an area of dynamic relationships that seems to us to be of great significance in the study of culture change. But together the two techniques should give us an expanded and sensible interpretation of the psychological concomitants of manifest cultural change. And this is our purpose.
