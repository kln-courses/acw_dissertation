<plain_text><page sequence="1">"If equal affection cannot be, / Let the more loving one be me": Auden on Love Zsuzsa Rawlinson wens The series of crude and convenient anthitheses in the descriptive catalogue of the "Introduction" to this issue's special section of celebratory essays on Auden highlight rather than exhaust his appeal as a writer. While this method might bolster up the Auden axiom '"honour the fate you are' with all its incorrigible divisions" (Mendelson 359), in truth, it remains singularly inappropriate. For it is also possible to argue that his mental composition was made up not by the juxtaposition of a few opposites, but by the infiltration of a multitude of highly varied elements. Auden, too, to borrow a phrase from another context, "was no striped frieze; he was shot silk" (Strachey, Elizabeth and Essex 43). The opposing qualities could just as well be viewed as "blending, twisting, flashing together" in true fashion, and thus the plurality of his personality, spiritual makeup, and mental accomplishment is all him. For example, Auden's views along with those of other '30s poets, such as Cecil Day Lewis, Stephen Spender, and Louis MacNeice, for instance, accorded closely with the prevailing canons of Modernist taste. They came under the influence of the disillusioning properties and explosive images of Eliot's poetry. They subscribed to the Eliotic tenet that "poetry must be difficult" and consequently committed themselves to writing obscurely knowing full well that they were only "a sort of poor r elation" ("Letter to Lord Byron" 98) and the part they were allotted was not that of the "real explorer" but of "the less heroic" albeit "useful role of colonisers" (Auden, "T. S. Eliot So Far" 226). Despite the continuation of their reverence towards Eliot's magisterial figure, despite the undoubtedly strong imprint left on their minds, they were also determined to bring poetry back to the "people." Their prime object was to be read and not necessarily by a select few literary connoisseurs. The often quoted "new styles of architecture" with "a change of heart" attitude thus produced poems which were lively, readable, metric. And, after the early phase of "Clinical Detachment" (Spender 54), Auden astonished his readers with his unique serious non-seriousness and with poems exhibiting a light comic tone, a friendly conversational manner, and a cosy domesticity believing, as Hungarian Journal of English and American Studies 14.1. 2008.

All rights to reproduction in any form are reserved.</page><page sequence="2">several other 1930s writers did, that popular forms had validity as a means of communicating seriousness. Auden's words on Byron in his "conversational song" (100), "Letter to Lord Byron," would serve well to describe "every possible attraction" of his own manner and his own "poetic style": "A style whose meaning does not need a spanner, / You are the master of the airy manner" (88-89). Indeed, Byron is an unconcealed favorite and it was for the overriding tenor of Don Juan - the ironic tone, the satiric manner, the inimitable ease of a conversational voice, the frivolity - that Auden held him in such reverence. As James Fenton (whose comments and insights on Auden's work are always refreshingly revealing) notes in his An Introduction to English Poetry , "few have actually caught 'the airy manner' better than Auden" (70), to which could be added Andrew Motion's contention that "no poet since Byron has worked his self into so amply humane a body of work" (36). Whatever view we may take, there can be no doubt at all that the poems of Auden which are most appreciated now, "at any rate in Britain, belong mostly to the transitional period when Auden was giving up Marx and Freud as his medicine-men and moving towards Christianity," as W. W. Robson observes (. Prologue 210-11). "Musee des Beaux Arts," "In Memory of W. B. Yeats," and "September 1, 1939" are Auden's best-known and most quoted poems, and the latter has even been discovered by politicians before and after 9/11. Again, as Fenton points out in his "Poet of the Century" Guardian article, we can all witness "a gradual process by which all kinds of Auden poems found their way into public consciousness" (36). The turbulent upheavals of the time produced Auden's public poems and exhibit his public pronouncements, but on a more personal and private level the subject of love, the trope of "in love or out," with an equal persistence, also fills a large place in his works. It was here, in the personal, everyday things of life where Auden seems to have truly triumphed in giving a reflection and confirmation of our own comparable experiences in recognizable and yet entirely new images that, to borrow Samuel Johnson's words on Gray's "Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard," "find a mirror in every mind." Auden, although a suitably gawkish figure for our modern age and for our modern taste, is a philosopher of love as he contemplates and ponders, often absurdly, on the nature of love and the lover, on loving and being loved. Given the fact that our interest in a love poem has to do mainly with ourselves, the lyric speaker of these poems and his hypothetical listener are almost always explicitly in dialogue. Auden himself affirmed this when he defined poetic meaning and the business of making sense in 68</page><page sequence="3">Secondary Worlds (1968) as "the outcome of a dialogue between the words of the poem and the response of whosoever is listening" (qtd. in Bocorth 185). That convenient monosyllable of affection, so intense and so ambiguous, thus found its way into many of his poems despite professing the view that "the subject of the poem was only the peg on which to hang the poetry" (Spender 51). Auden was not shielded from the experiences that we all have and saw love in all its aspects - as a subject for joy, for penitence, for resignation, for mockery, for despair. Accordingly, his numerous love lyrics tend to be two-toned where joy and grief, "celebration and regret," "sexual success and emotional failure" go hand-in-hand (Mendelson 230). Indeed, his smart manner, coupled with a more technical approach to poetry, along with his defiant absence of sentimentality and egotism "forbade any appeal to deeper imagination and emotions. It seemed heartless. Although something must be conceded to that view, Auden's lyrics exceed in range and number those of any other modern poet and can be more touching than any other poet of his school" (Robson, Modern English Literature 128). In short, his work is a treasure-house of poignant poems, moving passages, and memorable lines that stir readers to their depth, which lead many people to turn to his poetry at different times but for the same reasons. The proof of his common touch can be attested to by the popular success of Tell Me the Truth About Love - a small volume of ten love poems and cabaret songs written in the thirties by Auden. It includes "Funeral Blues," also known as "Twelve Songs: IX" or "Cabaret Song," which was recited in the famous funeral scene in the 1994 film Four Weddings and a Funeral The volume may be regarded as a spin-off from the success of the film, yet the fact that it sold more than 275,000 copies signifies both its power and its popular appeal. The closing poem, "Funeral Blues," this heart-wrenching song of grief and despair, of what it is to suffer the loss of a loved one, is the single most popular Auden poem. By a delightfully mordant streak of irony, all the satire of the original eulogy- as it first appeared in the play The Ascent of F6 (1937) - is gone from the revised poem and readers now respond to its appealing simplicity, obvious sincerity, and solemn-free profundity. He was my North, my South, my East and West, My working week and my Sunday rest, My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song; I thought that love would last for ever: I was wrong. ("Twelve Songs: IX," CP 120; Tell Me the Truth 29) 69</page><page sequence="4">"O Tell Me the Truth about Love" is the titular and opening poem of the volume. It brings to mind image after image and attempts to speak no more and no less than the truth about love. But, as Lytton Strachey observed, "love is a word of questionable import, there hovers indeed a vast interrogation" (Elizabeth and Essex 23). One of the reasons is that love constitutes a mystery that no philosophy, no amount of dialectic has been able to clear up so far. Another may lie in the simple observation that there are a great deal of a great many kinds of love. Yet, even if it is hard to tell the truth about love, it is nevertheless possible to be truthful. To tackle this manifestly difficult task adequately, to attempt to pin down its characteristics, the speaker in the poem uses a number of different conventions such as comparison, particularisation, even anthropomorphism. In the process of "hammering out" the truth about love, some fresh analogies - one might say incongruous points of likeness in things most unlike - are drawn, often in the manner verging on the absurd. It seems that the aloof albeit compassionate speaker, "like the jesters of the Middle Ages" and "the philosophers of the eighteenth century, found in the use of pranks and buffoonery the best way of telling the truth" (Strachey, Landmarks 138). Some say that love's a little boy, And some say it's a bird, Some say it makes the world go round, And some say that's absurd, And when I asked the man next door, Who looked as if he knew, His wife got very cross indeed, And said it wouldn't do. Truth be told, the persistently recurring question in the alternating stanzas - "O tell me the truth about love" - despite the mounting urgency, remains resolutely unanswered. For the simple reason that it is unanswerable, the more it is considered, the more complex it gets. Throughout the poem love admits of more than one definition, and to know the truth, to disclose the whole truth, at last, is denied. Reason and logic are of no help, for they yield only partial truths. As one Auden lover confessed, "the speaker's refusal or inability to settle for one precise definition . . . speaks much about our human limitations of corralling love 70</page><page sequence="5">under a single pen, as so many poets writing on the subject of love do" (Wong par. 10). Truth or no truth, what is undoubtedly achieved is the speaker's, and consequently the reader's, full engagement in the impossible task of rationally considering something which is as irrational as love. We understand that its impenetrable mystery is beyond reach and so the suspense is complete. And the penultimate line with its question "Will it alter my life altogether?" is not even relieved by a faint, yet affirmative nod. When it comes, will it come without warning, Just as I'm picking my nose? Will it knock on my door in the morning, Or tread in the bus on my toes? Will it come like a change in the weather? Will its greeting be courteous or rough? Will it alter my life altogether? O tell me the truth about love. (CP, "Twelve Songs: XII" 121-22; Tell Me the Truth 9-10) "As I Walked Out One Evening" uses the typical ballad opening - "as I walked out one morning" - for an English pastoral or folk song. A further instance of Auden's dexterity is to be seen in his use of the formula that has actually remained a set line. The language of the poem is startlingly simple, although the poem's structure, along with the three voices of which it is composed, reinforce as well as disrupt atemporal universality. In the ballad, the lover sings the folksy I'll love you till the ocean Is folded and hung up to dry And the seven stars go squawking Like geese about the sky and that "Love has no ending" but, as Mendelson notes, "the poet with the sad weight of the traditional ballad upon him . . . sees the crowds on the pavement as 'fields of harvest wheat.'" "Meanwhile," in this timeless world of folktale, "the clocks chime their warning, cO let not Time deceive you / You cannot conquer Time'" (236). The traditional song of love, of joy, and that of nature thus darkens considerably and turns balladistic. In the 71</page><page sequence="6">background is the favorite topos, the hurrying steps of time that are closing in on the pair of lovers, and despite their hopeful lyricism and resounding oaths, these steps remind them of the transience of all things, and of the ending of all pleasures. O plunge your hands in water, Plunge them in up to the wrist; Stare, stare in the basin And wonder what you've missed. O stand, stand at the window As the tears scald and start; You shall love your crooked neighbour With your crooked heart. (CP 114-15; Tell Me the Truth 1 7-19) Although possessing a temperament which tended to be suspicious of emotionalism, how intensely human it is to lay before the world, to give public expression of, the very privacies of the heart as in the justly famous, melodiously lyrical, and incantatorical "Lullaby." "Lullaby" is usually regarded as affirmative despite its theme: "Lay your sleeping head, my love, / Human on my faithless arm" when "Certainty, fidelity / On the stroke of midnight pass." It is, as Mendelson claims, "the first English poem in which a lover proclaims, in moral terms and during a shared night of love, his own faithlessness. Hundreds of earlier poems lamented or confessed faithlessness, but the lyric tradition complained of the beloved's inconsistency, not the poet's" (233). Unsurprisingly, the writer Gordon Snell selected this poem for the 2006 edition of Ufelines: letters from Famous People about Their Favourite Poem. Commenting on his choice he claims that "while still having the quirky and startling array of words that's typical of Auden's style, it manages to be robust and optimistic in the midst of a melancholy view of the transient nature of life" (MacMonagle 294). Beauty, midnight, vision dies: Let the winds of dawn that blow Softly round your dreaming head Such a day of welcome show Eye and knocking heart may bless, Find our mortal world enough; Noons of dryness find you fed By the involuntary powers, 72</page><page sequence="7">Nights of insult let you pass Watched by every human love. (CP 131-32; Tell Me the Truth 21) Love also provides the peg for Auden's cabaret songs he wrote for the voice of the actress Hedli Anderson (later the wife of Louis MacNeice). They are chiefly remarkable for parodying the popular lyrics in which Auden "joked ventriloquistically about his own wounds" (Mendelson 235). In the first of these songs, "Johnny," there is the same Audenesque feature - the lyric speaker's joy tinged with melancholy. Having become entangled in the web of that mysterious amour, having been lavish in the protestations of his worship, his adoration, his love - love's bittersweet condition and the lonely refrain, "But he frowned like thunder and he went away," remain. The warm and genuine feeling subsides, the romance pattern disappears, the desperate abyss between the lovers widens, the playful reproaches turn grave, and agitation can no more be concealed and a blackness and a void descend: O last night I dreamed of you, Johnny, my lover, You'd the sun on one arm and the moon on the other, The sea it was blue and the grass it was green, Every star rattled a round tambourine; Ten thousand miles deep in a pit there I lay: But you frowned like thunder and you went away. ("Twelve Songs: X," CP 120-21; Tell Me the Truth 27-28) This list of features does not exhaust those which go to make up the body of Auden's love poetry. Sordidness and something (in Fenton's words) "not entirely respectable" also surface, for example, in "This Loved One," beginning with the lines "Before this loved one / Was that one and that one" (CP 44). The seeming unimportance or feigned indifference are reminiscent of John Donne's famous lines on the same subject. In "The Indifferent" the speaker claims that "I can love her, and her, and you, and you; / I can love any, so she be not true." In both poems a heavily ironic tone replaces the traditional reverential one, in both cases the lover is viewed as someone easily replacable, and in both situations the speaker simultaneously glorifies and debases, and consequently demystifies, love. The love poem which readers may truly "love to love," Auden's "The More Loving One," speaks about a familiar enough occurence: inequality in a relationship, in the familiar accents of inward contemplation. 73</page><page sequence="8">The feeling that the poem has scripted stirs many readers to the depths of their souls. Paradoxically, the pathos is conveyed in the simplest possible words and the barest verbal textures; at the same time, it is conveniently counter-balanced by the ironic and distancing tones of its homely, slangy language. Perhaps this also accounts for the reason why its words have become so "adhesive," that is, easily retainable in memory. Whatever the reason, the modest and quiet words of this exquisitely crafted small-scale poem echo in readers' minds, find a responsive chord in their hearts, and ultimately, turn the very private utterance of a very private emotion into a collective experience or, the way Auden phrased it, into a "genuine community": How should we like it were stars to burn With a passion for us we could not return? If equal affection cannot be, Let the more loving one be me. Were all stars to disappear or die, I should learn to look at an empty sky And feel its total dark sublime, Though this might take me a litde time. (CP 445) The poet Simon Armitage leaves no doubt about the particular brand of the poem's distinct effect which he himself found most rewarding: I'm attracted to its casual but compelling tone, its shifting rhythms and acoustics, its brevity, as well as its sentiments, which I can more or less subscribe to. The second stanza is exceptional - my heart goes off like a flash-bulb every time I read it. More than this, whilst the poem would be at home in any anthology of modern verse, it would be equally as comfortable on a toilet door or the back of a bus seat, and none the worse for it. (MacMonagle 11) Much is to be said for this kind of effectiveness of communication, but as the late Professor Robson correctly stated, "quotability and memorability are not, it seems, thought specially important virtues nowadays" ("The Present Value" 154). Nevertheless, they may be regarded as a proof of, what may be called, "communicative efficacy" (154). If these criteria are still deemed inadequate for assessing Auden's excellence or permanent greatness, then there is always the other prominent measure, his 74</page><page sequence="9">"abundant felicity of expression" (156). For, like all the greatest spirits of the age, Auden was instinctively and profoundly an artist "passionately in love with language" ("So You Think You Can Write?" par. 8) and the supreme master of the written word. And the reader who looks to Auden's writings for an understanding of experience, who wants to elicit other comforting or confuting illustrations, who desires further reflection and confirmation in the best of language and the best of arrangement, will find that in the medley of human passion, in "love's worn circuit" ("The Letter"), there is "love's pleasure and pain" ("Too Dear, Too Vague"); s/he will also see that in our "Boy- / Meets-Girl era of mirrors and muddle to work through, / Without rest, without joy" ("Mundus et Infans"); and, whilst s/he will be encouraged for "All that lives may love" ("Underneath an Abject Willow") and to "By all means sing of love but, if you do, / Please make a rare old proper hullabaloo," he will also be reminded "That love, or truth in any serious sense, / Like orthodoxy, is a reticence?" ("The Truest Poetry is the Most Feigning"). Sometimes s/he will be faced with the irrefutable "For when love is waiting / Logic will not do" ("Heavy Date"), or the cursory "If I could tell you I would let you know" ("If I Could Tell You"), or the wryly comforting Like love we don't know where or why, Like love we can't compel or fly, Like love we often weep, Like love we seldom keep. ("Law Like Love") Whilst pausing to note that love as Agape as well as Eros is to "endure the tyrannies of love" ("A Summer Night") and "That love must ride to reach his ends" ("An Island Cemetary"), a pleading sotto voce will also implore the familiar predicament that "I shall never be / Different. Love me." ("Anthem for St. Cecilia's Day"). At times s/he will experience a treacherous betrayal: That you then, unabashed, Did what I never wished, Confessed another love; And I, submissive, felt Unwanted and went out. ("Twelve Songs: IV") S/he will, however, find much needed solace in the fact that being scorned or deserted "made him weep his pints like you and me" ("Who's Who"). 75</page><page sequence="10">When nerves are fretted to ribbons s/he will also understand that after "the storm of pleasure dies" and "After the kiss comes the impulse to throttle" ("Death's Echo") as well as the frightening realization about "What swarming hatreds then will hatch / Out of Love's riven heart?"; then the brutal Shine lest tonight any, In the dark suddenly, Wake alone in a bed To hear his own fury Wishing his love were dead. ("Five Songs: IV and V") S/he will also discern that although " The desires of the heart are as crooked as corkscrew /' ("Death's Echo"), "We must love one another and die" ("September 1, 1939"). Often there would be happy memories of fulfillment when "We, too, had known golden hours / When body and soul were in tune" ("We Too Had Known Golden Hours") and ". . . when I try to imagine a fauldess love / Or the life to come, what I hear is the murmur / Of underground streams, what I see is a limestone landscape" ("In Praise of a Limestone"). Then finally, as "Each lover has a theory of his own" ("Alone"), s/he might have reason to conclude: . . . else why should so many Poems which make us cry direct us to Ourselves at our least apt, least kind, least true, When a blank I loves blankly a blank You? ("One Circumlocution") and to imagine a love that however often smeared, shrugged at, abandoned by a frivolous worldling, does not abandon. ("Amor Loci") Any enquiry into the merry-go-round nature of love and desire will inevitably lead to such observations and also to the bitter fact that we may never get what we want: literally as lovers and textually as readers. Freud recognized love's ever-eluding and inces sandy tantalizing quality "as an unavoidable, if rather pathetic aspect of what it is to be human" (Bennett 140-41). This endlessly deferred complete satisfaction unmistakably comes 76</page><page sequence="11">to the fore in the previously quoted "One Circumlocution" passage, in which an ambiguous and roundabout figure of speech is used to describe an ambiguous, albeit simple, feeling in a roundabout manner. For this reason, the semiotic self-reference and linguistic self-awareness accentuate the passage's mystery, the blanking of thought that no amount of paraphrase will penetrate, let alone clear up. When it comes to love we seem to draw a blank where the word "blank" refers to a notion that is stripped of all meaning; yet, it also conjures up in every possible permutation all its different meanings, uses, and associations - for example, "empty," "discomfited," "colorless," "fruitless," "expressionless," "vacant," "absolute," and, above all, "unwritten" and "left to be filled." By the same token, it directs our attention self-referentially to our means of expression and the new idiom that can exploit to the utmost the chance for generating meaning via absences, ambiguities, verbal nuancies, tensions. In short, the play on words thus creates a very flexible meaning and underwrites, gives room, to alternative reactions, suggesting that it is the reader who may be called upon to complete what the author was forced to abandon and leave blank. Another way of talking about love is not only to recall Auden's love of "hanging around words [and] listening to what they say" dictum ("So You Think You Can Write?" par. 9), but also to refer to his custom of "hanging around" the poems and not letting them go. As is well known, his habit of revising poems was almost infinite. Parallel then to the interests in "communicative efficacy" and "abundant felicity of expression" there is also another, a third critical principle to consider, namely, the "self-evident internal coherence" of his poems (Robson, "The Present Value" 161). In tbe first place, the concentration on the dictates of deliberate art must duly be accorded, not least since Auden is regarded by the testimony of critics and poets as a consummate craftsman, a metrical virtuoso of conventional and unconventional prosodies. Secondly, as he was to say in his essay on Robert Graves's poetry, "nothing is more instructive than a poet's revisions" ("A Poet of Honor" 260), and it is certainly informative to look at his own practice. The poem "Autumn Song" received extensive "polish" throughout the years and can thus be cited as suitable evidence for Auden's subtle skill and artistry. The images were worked and reworked, language was arranged and rearranged, until the internal coherence and unity aimed at had been either abandoned or sufficiently achieved. It is an innocent- looking, sardonic dirge, and Shakespeare's "Fear no more the heat o' th' sun, / Nor the furious winter's rages" ( Cymbeline 4.2.258-91) is the prototype 77</page><page sequence="12">for Auden's employment of the trochaic tetrametre catalectic (lacking the final syllable) form (Fenton 43). Apart from the fact that Auden is a brilliant metrist and a true successor to the Elizabethan song tradition, the poem and its variants (see Appendix) also allow us to look at them in groups and not in isolation; to see just how extensive the author's revisions are; to consider whether, as a result, a virtually new work has come into existence or not; to assess what is lost and what is gained; and finally, but perhaps most crucially, whether the expression has been bettered, the line has been improved, and the conception of the ideal truthfully and coherendy realized. These questions, of course, belong to textual criticism and to the laborious work of textual critics on which literary criticism is totally dependent. Whilst this is not the place to clarify any of these questions about the various revisions, the assemblage helps to demonstrate Auden's artistic struggle towards perfection as well as to raise critically the question of "visions and revisions," readings and rereadings. One further observation on the issue of internal coherence based on Auden's comment that "nearly all poets think of their poems as heard speech" ("The Creation of Music and Poetry" 190): the majority of these poems are songs, and as critics we, thus, find ourselves "in the interference zone between the verbal and the musical" (Bowie 3). While this could be an interest in itself and warrant a separate essay, it may suffice to say that Auden's diction of modern love in the modern city is accompanied by the age-old tunes of songs, ballads, madrigals, dirges, lullabies, hymns, nursery rhymes along with the less familiar jaunty rhythms of blues and jazz. Auden's articulated view was that "we break into song when we reach a level of feeling at which ordinary speech won't do" (qtd. in Greenlaw 8) and that "Only your notes are pure contraption, / Only your song is an absolute gift" ("The Composer" 148). For, as he explains, it is music that speaks "this universal language" and it is music's "enigmatic grammar which at last / Says all things well" ("Music Is International" 263). Readers (and listeners) may have intuitively sensed that their appreciation of the two-toned aspect of these musico-literary poems may also lie in Auden's superior ability to blend the two together. If a poem's fitness with itself is to be found anywhere, it will be here in the perfect marriage of words and music: the properties of the non-lexical song contribute to selecting the right pitch, setting the intonation, and imposing the ironic inflection on the representation of an experience in a language that "says all things well." Rather than any conclusive creed, it is Auden's insights into the indecipherable mystery of the shared human condition that helped to 78</page><page sequence="13">establish his reputation and ensure the long-range pleasure of numerous readers. His lyrics "sing agreeably, agreeably, agreeably of love" ("Ten Songs: IV" 212). Indeed, they speak of the human subject, in Yeats's phrase, of "love's bitter mystery" ("Who Goes with Fergus?" 48-49) and, in Joyce's, of "the word known to all men" (516), with which all are familiar and in which all remain interested. Auden, in his essay "The Greeks and Us," claimed that "about three-quarters of modern literature is concerned with one subject: the love between a man and a woman, and assumes that falling in love is the most important and valuable experience that can happen to human beings" (22). While his lyrics acknowledge this imperative, they go beyond the tried and trusted conventions and the sentimental posture of "Love loves to love love" (Joyce 331). Auden rejects "the warm glow of romance" (Greenlaw 9) in favor of Rejoice, dear love, in Love's peremptory word; All chance, all love, all logic, you and I, Exist by grace of the Absurd, And without conscious artifice we die: ("In Sickness and in Health" 248) The love poems derive some of their specific strength from Auden's ability to strike an authentic note, in Auden's account of himself, from "making new glosses on the noun Amor" ("Letter to Lord Byron" 98). And precisely this "new gloss," which distances the effusion and "forbids the mouth solemn words" (Nietzsche 129) but which remains persistently pure, is the overriding spiritual signature that makes his poetry as powerful as ever and as contemporary as it is possible to be. At any rate, it is this spirit which is singularly akin to our own, and the final impression that is left with us is of a corpus of poems which we cannot choose but love.
