<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Archaic Ontology of the Hopi Indians On John Loftin's Interpretation of Hopi Religion Armin W. Geertz The recent publication of John D. Loftin's "Re- ligion and Hopi Life in the Twentieth Century" (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1991 - xxi + 168 pp., price: $ 19.95) calls for a more careful and detailed analysis than a shorter review would allow. John Loftin is a lawyer and teaches at the Department of Religious Studies at the Uni- versity of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. His book is partly based on a doctoral dissertation written in 1983 and on six summers of fieldwork among the Hopls. The author claims that no comprehen- sive and systematic interpretation of Hopi religion exists in the literature. This lack stems in part, according to Loftin, from the fact "that the Hopi have been investigated mostly by anthropologists, who have tended to interpret the Hopi religious orientation as it relates to social structure and material culture" (xiv). The truth of the matter is that a comprehensive and systematic interpretation of Hopi religion does in fact exist. And it is written by an anthropologist! I am referring to Richard M. Bradfield's work "A Natural Histo- ry of Associations" (London 1973), which Loftin knows well, since he refers to it often in his book. Loftin's claim is peculiar to historians of religions influenced by the Chicago school and the recently deceased, world famous Mircea Eliade. Eliade was of the opinion that religion cannot be adequately interpreted through what he considered to be the reductionisms of the social sciences. Religion must be studied with the help of a special transhistorical empathy which only historians of religions are capable of experiencing, and the results of their studies must contribute to a type of humanistic revivalism which Eliade believed is essential to the salvation of modern humanity from its exis- tential malaise. This basic position is evidenced in a large number of studies inspired by or directly influenced by Eliade and his closest pupils. 1. Archaic Ontology How do Eliadeans study religion? They proceed from a series of a priori assumptions of which two are particularly essential. First of all, there is the concept of the dialectics of the sacred. To be hu- man is to be religious. Homo sapiens is Homo re- ligiosus. Religious humans live their lives in terms of transcendent exemplary models, where the in- evitable tension between the historicization of the sacred and the remythicization of the historical are played out in many, mostly dramatic, forms» Eliade conceived of these factors in reified terms. For him, the Sacred is a "metacultural and transhis- torical" phenomenon coextensive with human na- ture, and, therefore, not all religious experience is historically determined. Thus, "essential religious structures" cannot be demonstrated as having been created by certain societies at certain historical moments. These societies have simply provided the opportunity for the manifestation of forms of the Sacred. Eliade' s well-known morphology of the Sacred provides categories for studying these manifestations. Eliade was aware of the historical nature of the documents, but he never resorted to explaining the specific historical and social factors of the dialectic because he was more interested in delineating the nature of non-historical structures than in explaining their historical manifestations. Thus, as anthropologist John Saliba pointed out, Eliade' s model is a "descending model" which de- letes the human dimension of religion (1976: 140). Anthropos 87.1992</page><page sequence="2">538 Berichte und Kommentare He does not study religion in order to study man- kind, rather in order to study the Sacred. Eliade has often been criticized for his normative stance, his diffuse (some call it confusionistic) argumentation, poor documentation, and anti-historical approach as well as his own particular misuse of various terms. As inspiring and quasi-religious as his ap- proach is, I consider it to be more reductionistic and less enlightening than even the most sterile type of questionnaire sociology. I will return to the second main assumption shortly. But first, it is necessary to explain where Loftin fits into the picture. Loftin's book on Hopi religion is a study in Eliadean theology, or "archaic ontology," if you will. He claims that he has deci- phered the "various modes of religious experience and expression" of the Hopls. He never defines what he means by "modes," and even though his use of the term is contradictory and diffuse, it is clear that he is motivated by a morphology of the Sacred in Eliade's sense. His book seems on the surface to be a serious study: he uses a whole list of Hopi terms and even cites a sentence in Hopi here and there; he refers to field experience, quotes consultants, cites earlier literature, and produces arguments for his position. But a closer look at the substance of the study reveals serious weaknesses. His ignorance of the language is a major handicap, and he jumps to enormous theological conclusions based on curiously literalistic interpretations of little understood terms. Not one central term is illustrated in situ, nor is any text cited, even in translation, to support his claims about these terms. His field experience has little to do with the substance of the book, and his obligatory use of the "whenever a Hopi is asked"-strategy reveals mistakes that even freshmen anthropologists would not commit. For example, already on page xviii he writes, "When asked why they act in and perceive the world as they do, Hopis almost always say they have always done so, meaning that such practices were established by the ancestors in mythic times," or, on page 8, ". . . if asked why he farms as he does, a Hopi will typically respond, 'because the ancestors did so,' meaning 'because the reexpe- riencing of the creation of the world is practical- ly significant'." His unjustified conclusions aside, what other answers could they give to such silly questions, if indeed they were ever actually put? I would probably answer in the same way just to please the enquirer. His use of the literature is equally dissatisfying, since he uses literature of varying reliability with- out evaluation. But, in all fairness it should be noted that scholars who do not know the Hopi language and who have not done careful, system- atic fieldwork, are actually in no position to judge the quality of the earlier literature anyway. Finally, the style of his arguments are very sim- ilar to Eliade's. They are tautological and spiced with paradox and metaphor, for instance: "Myth incorporates history into timelessness by forget- ting the distinctive characteristics of events, while prophecy remembers the timeless dimension of events that are at first glance irreversible and his- torical" (xx), or, "The Hopi emerged in the begin- ning as clowns, and a sacred, atemporal dimension surrounds their very finitude and mortality" (xxi), or, the four fundamental activities of the hunting- gathering ancestors "relate to active decipherments of cosmic rhythms, though the activities related to them paradoxically point back to their passive, ultimate character" (23). It is as if the type of writing which Eliade introduced to his readers con- stitutes for his students a sacred and hierosophical language of its own to be emulated and developed. It does not, however, add precision to the analysis of religions. I would think that using Eliade's approach and categories should at least occasion an acknowledgment of, or discussion with, the still growing literature of criticism of the great master. The end result is that Loftin makes all sorts of claims in the first half of the book about Hopi religious experience, about Hopi mythical thought, about the concept of the sacred without one shred of evidence, not one cited myth, not one argu- ment supported by testable evidence. This is rather peculiar behavior for a lawyer. Instead, we are offered an eulogy of repetitive assertions. And, in the process, he commits overinterpretation every step of the way. He has, like many others before him, romanticized the Hopis, and he gives the impression that Hopis are totally enwrapped in a collective state of mystical consciousness with no capacity for skepticism, individualism, criticism, doubt, or rationality. His stance even moves him to tender grossly insulting remarks like, "The Hopi are aware, then, that plants need water" (10). He mentions my critical stance of Western romantiza- tion of the Hopis, and he even cites a Hopi who "resented being romanticized as noble and pure when in reality he and other Hopis are human beings with many problems of their own" (13). In the final chapter, he repeats this position. But this did not prevent him from pursuing his own romantization of the Hopls. In the following, I will examine some of the theological postulates which inform the first part of the book. Loftin's point of departure is that "the sacred" is the underlying and interconnecting phenomenon Anthropos 87.1992</page><page sequence="3">Berichte und Kommentare 539 of Hopi experience. He claims that the term for the sacred is a'ni himu, which he translates as "Mighty Something." He also asserts that the sacred is "basic reality." Furthermore, he claims that the indefiniteness of the term is due to the fact that Hopi religious experience is a confrontation with "something" mysterious and incomprehensible and is thus "not unlike William James's 'something there' or Rudolf Otto's 'numinous'" (xvf.). This peculiar literalism has nothing to do with the Hopi language, and it does not warrant Loftin's theolog- ical speculations about how and what the Hopis experience. Loftin's claims are more a reflection of his own quest for the exotic (cf. Keesing 1989). The first problem is that these terms in com- bination are not very common and can hardly justify being treated as a type of generic term for "significant practical, social, and perceptual activi- ties" (xv). The second problem is that Loftin never proves that they also translate as "basic reality" or even as its euphemism. The third problem is that where Loftin essentializes them as one term, they are in fact two terms which cover an array of se- mantic categories which do not necessarily point in the direction he has chosen for them. The term a ni is an intensifying adverbial meaning "a lot / a great deal," and himu is an indefinite pronoun which can refer to animate or inanimate objects without distinction of gender, and it translates as "someone or something." As an aside, the base hii- is both interrogative and indefinite ("which?/some"). Lin- guist Ekkehart Malotki in his book "Hopi Time" (1983: 221 f.) illustrated various uses of the term a ni, and I have chosen two examples of the a* ni himu combination: Itàa-sipal-tsoki a' ni himù-y'-ta Our-peach-tree a lot something-[POSS]-[IMPRF] Our peach tree is bearing a lot [of fruit]. Pay hapi nuuu-ngaqw a ni Well[EMPH] I you-from a lot hiita tuwi-y'-va something [ACC] knowledge-[POSS]-[INCHO] I've really learned a great deal from you. Here we find the combination bearing nothing more than quantification. The last sentence, for instance, does not indicate "sacred knowledge," rather a great deal of knowledge! The interesting thing is that Loftin's main consultant, Emory Seka- quaptewa, is quoted on page xvi of Loftin's book as saying that the terms also are used to describe secular phenomena. But Loftin is so insistent on his theory that those secular phenomena must be "significant" per se that he missed Sekaquaptewa's point altogether. Sekaquaptewa was probably po- litely pointing out that Loftin is wrong. In my collection of texts which I published together with Michael Lomatuway'ma (1987), the combination a9 ni himu is found 8 times (out of 100 pages of Hopi texts!). Five of the examples refer to powerful beings or qualities, two to quantifica- tion, and one to relative status. The first five all refer to powerful animate beings. The references are 11B.1.5; 11F.3.1; 11M.3.6; 13.8.3; 17.1.12; 27.178.2; 27.185.6; and 30.16.1. Which brings me to my last example. Malotki is the only person who has published a short text in Hopi which explains what the terms can signify when describing the supernatural: Hak a'ni himunen pay naap hinwat pantangwu. Noq epha- qam himuwa pay soq nukpanvewat pantangwu. Pu' pay hak piw a'ni himunen hak hiita pavanniiqat tuwiy'tangwu. Noq oo- vi ima katsinam a'ni hiitu, puma it yooyangwuy tuwiy'yungqe oovi. Pu' ima qataymataq yesqam puma piw it hopit tuwiy akw pa'angwantotaqe oovi piw a'ni hiitu. Pay it tuuwutsit ep puma qa suukya pakiwta, i' kookyangwso'wuutiniqw pu' put mömatniqw pu' i' pavayoykyasiniqw pu' i' maasaw, pu' taawa, pay ii'ima puma hiitu. Noq i' hopi pumuy tuwiyamuy son naap hintiniqe oovi pam pumuy amumi put hiita tuwiyamuy tuuvingtimakyangw yep qatu. A being may have greater than human powers for a variety of reasons. Sometimes these powers are rooted in evil. Other times, exceptional powers may be based on the ability to achieve great things. The kachinas are extremely powerful beings in this sense, because they know how to produce rain. All those who exist invisibly and aid the Hopi with their knowl- edge are considered beings of superhuman strength. Many of them, such as the Old Spider Woman and her grandsons, Pöqangwhoya and Palöngawhoya, Pavayoykyasi, Maasaw, and the Sun god appear in many myths and tales and perform many feats. Since the Hopi cannot perform these feats, they contantly plead to these beings to support them in their lives, each being using its own special methods. (Malotki and Lomatuway'ma 1987: 281) This text clearly shows that we are dealing with power in terms of clearly defined and named be- ings who are simply more powerful than humans. We are, in other words, neither dealing with the sacred nor with ultimate reality nor with some inef- fable numinosity. In fact, these aspects don't seem to apply in actual linguistic usage. Other terms which tend towards Loftin's premise, such as himu antsa "sacred thing," and pas himu "it is sacred," are again combinations of intensifiers modifying the indefinite pronoun. Loftin's correlative jump into talking about "sacred substances" is equally unwarranted (e.g., p. 11). Loftin continues his theological errors by claim- ing that "the sacred" is also called "giver of the breath of life" or "he who walks unseen" (14). In the first place, there is no direct evidence of such a connection, and, in the second place, he is Anthropos 87.1992</page><page sequence="4">540 Berichte und Kommentare illicitly equating the inanimate with the animate. He furthermore misreads Malotki when claiming that Maasaw has taken over the roles of an earlier Supreme Being. There is no evidence of an earlier Supreme Being. Maasaw' s development can clear- ly be shown to have arisen in contact with pan- Indian and Euro-American usage of the Lakota Great Spirit, which crept into the Hopi Tradi- tionalist Movement rhetoric during the mid-1950s. Loftin also quotes my note on similar euphemisms (Geertz and Lomatuway'ma 1987: 68 note 18), but I think it is clear in that note that the terms are referring to new developments in Hopi theology - if that is what it can be called. There are so few Hopis who refer to a Supreme Being, that the ev- idence can hardly warrant Loftin' s encompassing claims. Loftin goes on to claim that "all Hopi deities should be understood as so many refractions of a9 ni himu," and he concludes that "the Hopi are not polytheistic; rather they worship one spiritual substance that manifests itself in many modes of being" (15). This claim is so absurd that I wonder whether Loftin has ever read the hundreds of pages of myths describing Hopi gods. Their world is much along the same lines as that of the Greek gods: mostly anthropomorphic, assisting and/or pestering or tormenting humans and each other on matters of sex, power, and fertility. It really takes a serious stretch of the imagination to find Loftin' s "refractions." Loftin then asserts that Hopi mythology "de- scribes the primordial union of male and female gods from which life emerged." The fact that there are innumerable contradictions in the myths does not matter, "given that all deities are for them so many refractions of the 'spiritual substance' " (42). Besides being a theological argument, the prob- lem here is that this primordial union does not coincide with Hopi mythical thought. Loftin evi- dently believes that the various stories about rain and the birth of the War Twins are metaphorical references to the primordial creation of life. The fact that there is no Hopi creation story (at least not from any reliable source, and certainly not in the colloquial) has no effect on Loftin's speculations. In his discussion of the female deities Tu- wapongtumsi, Tiikuywuuti, and Taalawtumsi, he cites my sociological and historical explanations for why one of my consultants mentioned the latter two as alternatives for each other (Geertz and Lomatuway'ma 1987: 73 note 31). Loftin's conclusion is that "people such as the Hopi, for whom mythic modes of understanding are dom- inant, often see relation, where more historically oriented people see difference" (131). And, indeed, some explanation has to be offered for the bewil- dering array of contradictory mythical evidence (42 f.). Loftin tries to suggest that there is a vague kind of logic behind the paradoxes which "handles them rather easily," but his main error here is that he refuses to tender any historical or social explanation. He fails to consider factors such as mutually incompatible clan traditions promoted by competing migrants from various regions, deliber- ate conspiracies (which was Whiteley's important thesis in his "Deliberate Acts", 1988), varying de- grees of misinformation, historical contingencies, and the highly unequal quality of the recorders of the myths. Loftin reads Nequatewa from Second Mesa, Stephen from First Mesa, Voth from Third Mesa, while at the same time drawing on materials and ideas from highly questionable sources such as Matthews, Courlander, and O'Kane. It is then claimed that the Hopis don't perceive all of the inconsistencies, paradoxes, and loose ends of the resultant hodge podge; it's only impoverished "his- torically" oriented Westerners who get stuck here. Well, there are inconsistencies (even if one ignores the errors of the scholars), and they are mostly due to human beings with conflicting allegiances in historically contingent situations. They are due to human beings who struggle every day to negotiate their identity and reality. The Hopis are clearly aware of the many inconsistencies and paradoxes, and they devote inordinate amounts of energy and time in arguing about them, rationalizing them, systematizing them, and explaining them away. Just like we do. In "Children of Cottonwood" I devoted a chap- ter to how the whole village was divided between bickering groups during a ceremonial (which is the occasion where harmony is supposed to prevail) precisely because of differences in clan tradition. My article on Hopi hermeneutics provides a further analysis of the conflict (1990). Despite Loftin's arguments that the Hopi clan and phratry sys- tem supposedly afford the "experience of tran- scendence" to "spheres of unity and spirituality" (17 f.), they are actually a major source of the rivalries, hatreds, and discontinuities of Hopi life. The clan and phratry systems are hegemonic and oligarchic, where the currency of social power is the possession of esoteric knowledge. They are built on a series of Chinese boxes of privileged clans, privileged lineages, and privileged persons. In addition to all of this, the secret fraternities and sororities add their own kind of rivalries as well. In my forthcoming book on Hopi prophecy, I argue the obvious that to be human is to be his- Anthropos 87.1992</page><page sequence="5">Berichte und Kommentare 541 torically contingent. Homo religiosus is a figment, a dream to catch hold of and sometimes grasp in the midst of more basic concerns. Holding his head high in the mists of "spiritual substances," Loftin lost sight of the way humans live their lives. 2. Archaic History The second main Eliadean assumption is the the- ory of history which Eliade laid out in his book "Le Mythe de l'éternel retour" (1949, revised and expanded in the English version of 1965). His main thesis was that "archaic" peoples (a concept never defined by Eliade) demonstrate a deliberate interest in a periodical return to the mythical time of the beginning of things, to the "Great Time." For Eliade, this nostalgia constitutes nothing less than the rejection of autonomous, linear history, a rejection which he labelled the "terror of history" (1965: 139 ff.). The archaic history is a "sacred history" that can be repeated indefinitely "in the sense that the myths serve as models for ceremo- nies that periodically reactualize the tremendous events that occurred at the beginning of time. The myths preserve and transmit the paradigms, the exemplary models, for all the responsible activities in which men engage" (1965: xiv). There are two main problems with Eliade' s argument. In the first place, there is no reason to assume, as he did, that cyclic and linear concepts of time are necessarily contradictory and incom- patible. The Hopi evidence shows that myth and ritual are often a vehicle which unites the two. Secondly, even if we accept the fact that sacred history in Eliade' s sense does exist among various peoples, we are neither obliged to assign that his- torical conception absolute ontological value nor to restrict the mythical imagination to paradigmatic statements about the past. Loftin chides me for not noting in my pre- liminary study of the puppet ceremonials (1982) "that the return to the primordium is inseparably intertwined with the Hopi's concern for rain, crops, and health. To experience 'again' the primordium is to recreate all cosmic forms and rhythms, which is no less than the rebirth of the world and of life itself (134 note 70). I admit it. I really don't think that Eliadean dogma (which my colleague Jeppe Sinding Jensen has called a syncretistic, Indo- Aryan normative anthropology, cf. Jensen 1986) is relevant to the Hopi example, nor do I think that New Age jargon such as "cosmic forms and rhythms" explains anything. As I noted above, the Hopis have no grand creation myth which is pe- riodically replayed like the Babylonians replayed Enuma Elish every time they performed the Akitu festival. They do seem to recreate various clan and fraternity origin myths, but when we get to the pan-clan contexts of the Emergence Myth (which is not, by the way, the birth of humans from a lesser stage of development, as Loftin claims inter alia, but the collective flight of fully developed humans with all the trappings of Hopi society and religion, who were escaping from their failures in the Third World) which everybody claims is replayed during the Wuwtsim Ceremonial, we sud- denly have very little evidence at all. I am sure, though, that some sort of recreation does occur, but there is no basis for Loftin's sweeping claims. The area with which I take issue is Loftin's attempt to see the recreation of the world every time a Hopi farmer farms or every time a Hopi happens to remember that he or she is a member of a clan (xviii). Following the lead of Walter Ο 'Kane, who for some reason Loftin promotes as a serious scholar, he makes the outrageous claim that "the Hopi do not understand work as a secular activity that is somehow distinct from their religious life" (3). When Hopis weave cotton, "they are also experiencing the sacred" (3). "Hopi farming techniques, along with hunting, gathering, building, eating, and sexual activity, are among the most religiously significant activities performed by Hopis" (5). This sentence, by the way, is a good reformulation of Eliade' s definition of Homo religiosus. He even claims that weaving "recalls the emergence of the Hopi," and this recollection actually regenerates the world (4). These are rather startling claims. It is claims like these which have made the Hopis the darlings of tourists, freaks, and artists. My question is, do the Hopis experience the sacred as employees in various Tribal administrative offices or in running the local supermarket or in producing silver over- lay or when collecting wood, brushing their teeth, washing their windows, filling up watercans, using the latrine, etc.? If Loftin is forced to admit no to just one of these things, he would need a whole interpretive apparatus for distinguishing when it is work and when it is sacred (and I don't find his "compartmentalization" argument very useful here). If he says yes to them all, then the burden of the proof is his. Just because one weaves by techniques ultimately laid down by Spider Wom- an, this does not necessarily mean that the Hopis "experience the sacred" every time they weave! They weave because they were taught to do it that way. If an uncle wants to spice things up a bit with tales about Spider Woman, this does not mean that Anthropos 87.1992</page><page sequence="6">542 Berichte und Kommentare the weavers are agog in the mythical realms every time they twist a little cotton. If Loftin answers that my examples stem from the decadence of the modern period in Hopi history (which is his basic argument in the second part of the book), then I ask for proof that the Hopis experienced the sacred in Loftin's sense when they wove fabrics in 1832 or 1729 or 1652. 3. Tradition and Modernity The bulk of the book consists of a detailed de- scription of one ceremonial in Part I, followed by a loosely connected description of the history of the Hopis since 1860 in Part II. Taken together with all of the Eliadean theory, this book, then, is supposed to qualify as a "comprehensive and systematic interpretation of Hopi religion." Comprehensive it is not. It is systematic if by systematic we mean a systematic application of Eliadean theory. It is not an exhaustive, careful, or critical examination of the evidence at our disposal, nor is it an attempt to find out how the Hopis actually think and feel. Almost every page has a "the Hopis experience," "the Hopis feel," or "the Hopis think," but there are no statements or evidence to support these assertions until we reach the last two chapters of the book. It seems striking to me that the only part of the book which prompts Loftin to tender historical and sociological explanations is Part II, which deals with change. Now, if you put - as Loftin does - the section on tradition, which has been deliberately and systematically described and interpreted in non-historical, idealizing terms, next to the section on change, which has been deliberately and sys- tematically described and interpreted in historical and sociopolitical terms, the result is unavoidable: tradition is good and change is bad, the former because it is timeless, the latter because it's from the Americans. The comparison is illicit because the elements under comparison are unequally rep- resented. Loftin has made the same mistake that all upholders of what I call the tradition/moderni- ty paradigm make, namely, an essentialization of uncritical stereotypes which glorify tradition and vilify modernity (cf. Jensen and Geertz 1991 and Geertz n. d.). The dichotomy is crude, and, yet, Loftin upholds it even when he ends up by refuting in Part II everything he asserted in Part I. I am referring to the only contribution of real value to Hopi studies, namely, the final two chapters (84-109, 110-123). Even though these chapters, like all of Part II, are filled with historical errors, naive and primitive explanations, misreadings, and unjustified conclusions, they nevertheless cover all of the major problems facing the Hopis today. And what is more important is that his narrative draws on Hopi sources such as the newspaper Qua' Töqti, reports from the Hopi health conferences, and statements made by Hopis in various publica- tions. What he doesn't realize is that this is Hopi religious reality. Loftin claims that the Hopis stray from the path "more than they once did" (112). But there is stronger evidence that religious conditions of this century are not essentially any different than those of earlier centuries. Since this will be systematically argued elsewhere, I will not go into detailed discussion here. But I would like to end by pointing out that the ideals of a religion are not its reality. They are ideals which are worth striving for but which can hardly ever be attained. Any Hopi will tell you this, and he won't have to resort to his forefathers to prove it. Loftin fails to see that even given a transhistorical sacred something, religion is not that sacred something. Religion is a genuinely human product, and it is nothing more nor less than social strategy. References Cited Bradfield, Richard M. 1973 A Natural History of Associations; vol. 2.
