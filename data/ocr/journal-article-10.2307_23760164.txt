The archaeological site known as Kutza (also spelled Cutza), and in the past as Chunbec, is situated about halfway between the villages of Dzibalchen and Iturbide, 7 km NNE of Dzibalchen in the Mexican State of Campeche. This relatively small site in the Chenes Zone is not very well known. George F. Andrews has investigated the architectural remains, Lorraine A. Williams-Beck has described the site and its archaeology in a 1986 preliminary field season report, and Renée Lorelei Zapata Peraza has reported on the carved stone sculptures that were removed to Campeche City for their protection ("Arqueología del Noreste de Campeche", in: Memorias del Segundo Coloquio Internacional de Mayistas, I: 426-448. México, D.F. 1989). In the unpublished report by Williams-Beck she describes and illustrâtes a colonnette with relief carving, associated with a mound on a platform, and Zapata describes "carved colonnettes with glyphs and person ages". In 1991 Karl Herbert Mayer photographed and meas ured one of these small columns, which was on exhibit at the Museo Regional de Campeche in the Casa del Teniente de Rey in Campeche City. The carving was unlabelled but could be identified through comparison with an illustration in Williams Beck's field report. The limestone sculpture is now on display in the Sala Maestro Pacheco Cruz of the Baluarte de la Soledad in Campeche City (the piece bears the inventory no. 10.-3427 40 and is erroneously labelled as deriving from Dzibilnocac). The colonnette is very eroded and probably served as an architectural décoration. Its présent height is more than 53 cm, its diameter 25 cm, and its relief depth is 10 mm (Figs. 1, 2). Fig. 2.

It is possible, but almost purely spéc ulation, that this first glyph is the 'flat-hand' verb found in the first part of dedication texts on stone, ceramics, and other kinds of objects. If this hypothesis holds true, in traditional 'Yu catec' syntax the next glyph would provide the ñame of the object dedicated. But except for a possible TI30 wa suffix, not enough detail is visible to draw any conclusions." Although the weathered con dition of the sculpture does not permit better readings, the ob ject is of particular importance because hieroglyphic inscrip tions in the Chenes Zone of Campeche are relatively rare. Typologically, carved colon nettes occur at the Chenes sites of Santa Rosa Xtampak and Dzibilnocac, and show either textual or figurai images. With regard to the chronology of the colonnettes, a date in the Late Classic or Terminal Classic is possible. Fig. 3. Capstone 8, Santa Rosa Xtampak. (Photo: K. H.

I suppose that the bundle-like element in the lower right corner represents a bündle of maize and that this glyph directly refers to this bündle. There is a glyph band under the scene. None of the glyphs can be recognized." The second object (Fig. 4), Capstone 14 of Santa Rosa Xtampak, was first seen in 1969 in a room of the Southwest Build ing, an L-shaped structure con sisting of 11 rooms, but, since it is a very faded mural and still in situ, no photographs of it have ever been published. The image on the stuccoed capstone is in a purplish-red colour and several pieces have flaked off. The rep resentational image of the cap stone is framed at top and bot tom by horizontal bands with glyphs and solid red bands. Grube, basing his observations on photos alone, provides the following comments on the mu ral's figurai and textual images: "The upper glyph band has dis appeared almost beyond visibil ity.

Two hitherto unpublished architectural stone sculptures are of particular interest since they represent a deity: God N of the Maya panthéon. God N, so named by Paul Schellhas in 1886 in the first systematic identification of Maya deities occurring in the códices, is one of the most important gods of the ancient Maya and his identity was for a long time a matter of debate. God N has been identified in the past as Mam, the god of the five-day Uayeb period, and as Bacab, a supporter of the heavens. His ñame can now be read phonetically as Pauahtun, who was one of the gods of Postclassic times mentioned by Diego de Landa.

In 1987 the Proyecto Arqueológico Sureste del Petén of the Guatemalan Instituto de Antropología e Historia (IDAEH), headed primarily by Juan Pedro Laporte, began archaeological investigations and excavations at the site. This project was merged in 1988 with the Proyecto Atlas Arqueológico de Guatemala, another IDAEH project. Since 1987 the ruins have been protected by IDAEH personnel. Ixtonton occupies an area of about 6 km2 and boasts three sacbeob dating to the Late Classic period. The core area of the site consists of two plaza groups built on an extensive platform associated with ballcourts, temples, palaces, and sacbeob. Originally, there were a series of carved stelae, however ail but two were looted before archaeological work began. In the course of the IDAEH excavations various limestone sculptures and sculptural fragments were brought to light. Fig. 5. The first God N figure (Photo: K. H. Mayer, 1988) Amon8these sculptural remains two fragmentary stone heads are of particular interest. At présent the heads are stored in the bodega and laboratory building of IDAEH in Dolores. One sculpture represents an anthropomorphic limestone head with a short tenon at its back (Figs. 8, 9), indicating that the piece was once embedded in the wall of a stone building, probably as part of a façade décoration. The head is carved in the round, 30 cm high, 26 cm wide, and 35 cm deep. The limestone is white and very soft, almost like chalk. The head is damaged in the face area; the nose is broken off and most of the mouth is missing. The head is embellished with a headband exhibiting Fig. 6. The first God N figure, side view. (Photo: K.

Architectural sculptures in the round are generally absent, which makes both Ixtonton heads archaeologically important. The nearest stone head with tenon is known from the site of Machaquila, more than 50 km WSW of Ixtonton. The recording of both stone heads was made possible by a permit from the Guatemalan Dirección General del Patrimonio Cultural y Natural (Oficio No. D080-93), and through the assistance of Juan Pedro Laporte. New Palenque tomb discovered MERIDA (Diario de Yucatán). At the beginning of June 1994 a spectacular new find at Palenque was announced to the world - the unexpected discovery of a tomb inside Temple 13. A team of INAH archaeologists led by Amoldo González of the Palenque Project opened the tomb to find a red-painted sar cophagus containing the body of what is assumed to be a ruler Fig. 9.
