Remove the joint!”  Alice through the looking glass, pp. 132–133.  The unprejudiced heart I would like somebody somewhere to endow an annual prize for a work of art  which takes a group of the most oppressed subjects and makes an effective  and transformative representation of their situation. The work would make its  audience care about what happens to those oppressed subjects and to understand  something of the audience’s own role in maintaining their oppression. It would  foster recognition of the subjectivity and creativity of the oppressed group  and consciousness of the need for redistribution of respect and of cultural and  material goods. Above all, it would help to support and protect them. If these  are subjects who are conventionally seen as radically excluded, for example  as beyond the possibility of communication or as embodied in ways which  occasion aversion or anxiety, the prize work should attempt to disrupt those  violence-prone perceptions.  One of my nominations for such a prize would be the film Babe. Before seeing  the film, I would have doubted that it was possible to make a highly successful  film for mass audiences that could do those things for one of the most oppressed  subjects in our society, the meat pig. One feature that made this achievement  possible was that the film successfully disrupted the adult/child boundary and  created space for adults to share certain kinds of openness to and sympathy for  animals permitted to children but normally out of bounds for mature adults.  This is one of the devices which enables the film, like Dick King-Smith’s prize- 55 </page> <page sequence="2"> The Eye of the Crocodile  winning book The Sheep–Pig on which it is based,1 to succeed to a remarkable  degree in opening for the pig the ‘unprejudiced heart’ invoked in the narrator’s  opening sentence. It is not just the film’s problematisation of the concept of  meat that makes this film philosophically interesting; it also poses ethical and  political questions, analogous to some of those arising in post-colonial theory,  about the distinction between meat and non-meat animals and about the role of  the human contract with those special more privileged ‘pet’ animals who can  never be ‘meat’. Because the main theme of Babe turns around the refusal of communicative  status to animals, the film is of considerable interest for philosophical accounts  of human–animal relations. The story provides a rich context for thinking  about this communicative status, posing questions about the inadequacy  of narrow rationalist accounts of communication, about representations of  animal communication and the charge of anthropomorphism, and about  the contradictions and paradoxes disclosed when we recognise the meat as a  communicative subject. Babe repeatedly problematises the kind of prejudice  that relegates the other to a sphere of radical otherness marked by rational  deficiency, mechanistic reduction and exclusion from communicative status.  The pig Babe disrupts the assumption that because he is a meat animal, he is ‘too  stupid to understand’; the story problematises the sheep–dog Fly’s dismissal of  sheep-talk as ‘just so much rubbish, to which she never paid any attention’. The  refusal of communicative status to animals is a crucial, formative arena where  closure and exclusion strategies which affect many humans are developed and  perfected. Babe thus provides many insights into closure strategies as they  affect both humans and non-humans.  Babe also offers a recognition of communicative virtues and characteristics as  central to both human and non-human forms of life, and offers a vision of the  emergence of communicative forms of relationship as victorious alternatives to  forms based on violence, domination and terror. The film does not suggest any  exploration of the ethical and political ambiguities of communicative forms,  which are potentially rather more compatible with oppression than it suggests,  and are implicated in the replacement of repressive patriarchal models by  hegemonic models based on the master subject, as in certain forms of liberal  democratic politics for example. But as Dryzek and Plumwood2 have argued,  communicative models of relationships with nature and animals seem likely to  offer us a better chance of survival in the difficult times ahead than dominant  mechanistic models which promote insensitivity to the others’ agency and  denial of our dependency on them. Babe crystallises in a useful way a clash of  models that is critical for our times.  1 Dick King-Smith, The sheep–pig, Harmondsworth Middlesex, Puffin Books, 1983.  2 John Dryzek, Discursive democracy, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1990 and Val Plumwood,  Feminism and the mastery of nature, London, Routledge, 1993. 56 </page> <page sequence="3"> 5 . ‘Babe’: The tale of the speaking meat  My initial reason for going to the movie however had much more to do with  being homesick—I was away from Australia for a long period and the film had  been shot in a shire near my home. I hoped to hear again the sounds of the  bush—those small but intensely evocative background calls—especially the  local birds and frogs which appear in the background on most soundtracks— that creep up on you unawares to create powerful longings for a much-loved  place. But when I took my seat in the darkened cinema, something else made  me cry too, with sorrow and shame for my own complicity in the dominant  cultural tradition of rational human mastery over animals and nature—as  well as everything else considered beneath the master realm of reason. These  were the powerful opening scenes of Babe showing the terrible cruelty of the  intensive pig farms in which the pig Babe, treated as living meat, is introduced  to us as narrative subject.  These visions of hell took on special power and poignancy for me because at  the time I saw the film I was living in the second highest US state for intensive  hog production. The state of North Carolina was a place where one rarely saw  farm animals out in the open and many of the rivers and estuaries were seriously  degraded or under assault from the toxic run-off generated by the intensive  factory farms. Many of the huge pig ‘slaughter facilities’ in the US employ  largely prison labour. The work of those who labour on the killing floor of these  massive facilities slaughtering up to 15,000 pigs a day is so terrible and poorly  paid that only the slave-like workforce of the carceral system, or those coerced  by other forms of desperation such as indentured immigrants, are available as  workers. The concentration camps too employed some categories of prisoners  to organise, imprison and execute others. The treatment of the pigs and that of  the prisoners has much in common; in both cases, the intense segregation of the  gulag ensures that the middle class rarely has to confront the hidden connection  between its ugly and violent reality and their own comfortable and tidy lives.  The speech of both pigs and prisoners is erased or delegitimated, and both are  reduced to living meat. As C. Stone Brown argues, ‘African Americans are the  flesh that maintains a profitable “prison industry”’.3 As disciplinary democracy  normalises massive incarceration, and more of us become either prisoners or  keepers, the fate of non-human and human prisoners increasingly converges.  The nightmarish opening scenes of Babe showed an ugly gulag reality that was all  around but which was banished from thought and sight, and generally treated,  even by the animal liberation movement, as too well established for serious  contest. In these circumstances, who could avoid being immediately caught  up in the little pig’s plight, or avoid comparing the misery of the incarcerated  animals with the consumptive pleasures of the over-privileged humans the next  shots cut to? The filmic technique at this point had us crossing that crucial  3 C. Stone Brown, ‘Prison guards fund governor for presidential race’, Z Magazine, Sept/October 1995.  57 </page> <page sequence="4"> The Eye of the Crocodile  animal/human subject boundary with dizzying speed, so fast that our usual  distancing defences did not have time to cut in and tell us that these subjects  are not at all comparable, that humans count and pigs don’t. Who could avoid  comparing the pigs’ misery with the humans’ pleasure, or avoid thoughts of  concentration camps and gas chambers as the pig mothers were torn from their  children and cattle-prodded into that terrible night journey from which there  was no return?  The answer, of course, to this question is: ‘quite a lot of people’. Many people  didn’t see animals or animal liberation as the topic of the film, and some  reviewers seemed to think it was all about how you could cross gender and  class boundaries and burst categories to make yourself anything you wanted  to be, even a sheep–pig, if you had enough determination and willpower—a  sophisticated postmodern–neoliberal Animal Farm allegory about personal  responsibility, individual merit rewarded, and trying harder. Babe does have  valid things to say to a human audience about not staying in the boxes convention  puts you into, but the message here is also relevant to breaking down hierarchies  of considerability which serve to confine non-humans. And the inability to see  how animals themselves could be a serious topic for such a film is an indicator  of their assigned status as beneath subjectivity and seriousness, both effective  defences against hearing the story of the speaking meat that Babe articulates.  The pig Babe speaks from the most delegitimated subject position possible in  our society, that of the meat, and we have developed strategies for blocking out  and not hearing the speech of those in that position. We could not continue the  sorts of meat practices the pig–human gulag system is based upon without these  kinds of strategies. One of the great strengths of the film is that it invites us to  challenge some of these paradoxes, blocks and erasures.  The paradox of the speaking meat  In the opening scenes of the factory farm we are introduced to the piglet Babe  as the film’s main narrative subject (marked by the subject’s theme on the  soundtrack, among other marks of subjecthood). We open with a shot showing  real piglets waking in expressive communication, and then see one of these meat- subjects expressing his/her4 sorrow at the loss of his mother, and his fear as he  is seized by strangers and carried away to be raffled. As his mother is prodded  into the truck, Babe utters his grief so fleetingly and naturally that we hardly  notice that our usual assumptions have been turned on their heads. The meat  animal is being presented to us as an expressive, narrative subject—the meat  is speaking. There are several disruptions here. What is disrupted immediately  4 I have assumed the masculine pronoun here for Babe because this is used in King-Smith 1983, but the film  is more ambiguous on this point.  58 </page> <page sequence="5"> 5 . ‘Babe’: The tale of the speaking meat  is the Cartesian model of the machine–animal, the dominant model which  enables the ontological presence, mind-like and communicative characteristics  of animals to be so utterly denied in the factory farm, where their entire lives  are defined and distorted by the function of serving human appetite. There  is paradox in the concept of speaking meat Babe confronts us with, precisely  because the concept of meat totally erases that speaking position; there is no  possibility of encountering the meat as expressive, narrative subject. An inquiry into the concept of meat provides a useful route into understanding  how ‘taxonomy’ connects ontology with ethics—how certain strategies of  representation normalise oppression by narrowing ethically relevant perception,  erasing key ethical dimensions of situations, and sometimes even making the  Other complicit in their own oppression through internalising oppressive forms  of identity. As Carol Adams has argued, the concept of meat justifies oppression  by hiding responsibility for death and the causal connection between the  production of meat and the animal’s death.5 The backgrounding, erasure or  denial of these connections in the abstractly quantitative and commodified  concept of meat Adams terms ‘absent referent’. ‘Absent referent’ involves a  complex process of splitting that renders unavailable not only the act of killing  which makes meat available as a commodity, but any recognition of connection  between the meat and those who consume it. To achieve this the concept of meat  must simultaneously establish several profound splits or radical exclusions,  between process–product, mind–body, and us–them. The first of these involves  a radical dissociation which denies the connection between the processes set in  motion by our intentions and the end product of commodified, quantitatively  specifiable flesh. The second radically dissociates the subjectivity which sets  these processes in motion from that of its victim, denying their kinship as  socially connected, purposive and communicative beings, and presenting the  victim reductively as flesh. ‘You looks at us,’ says King-Smith’s wise old sheep  Ma; ‘and you sees lamb chops’.  The third background assumption involved in modern industrial society’s  concept of meat as commodity denies the possibility of human consumers  themselves ever taking the form of meat, by a background assumption of a  hierarchy of use and considerability which is linked to an alleged hierarchy of  mental and communicative capacities between species, with humans of course  at the top. These assumptions together make the ideas of ‘human meat’ almost  as unthinkable a possibility as that of being introduced to the speaking meat.  The concept of meat is a form of life6 (Wittgenstein 1954) in which taxonomy  structures our moral vision via the ethical and epistemological possibilities it  5 Carol Adams, The sexual politics of meat, New York, Continuum, 1994. 6 Ludwig Wittgenstein, Philosophical investigations, Oxford, Blackwell, 1954. 59 </page> <page sequence="6"> The Eye of the Crocodile  discloses or denies.7 These sets of background denials enable the presentation of  the other in the instrumental terms that Marilyn Frye has identified as belonging  to the arrogant perspective in which viewers ‘organise everything seen with  reference to themselves and their own interests’,8 in this case, in terms of a  strong instrumental reductionism which identifies the other with what is only a  part of their being, the part that is of use to us as flesh. Since we, in contrast, are  identified as humans in terms which emphasise, rather than suppress or deny,  our subjectivity, and which tend to background our bodily aspects of identity,  beings identified as meat become radically Other: not only can we never be  included in the category of meat ourselves, we can never be introduced to the  meat.  There is injustice in each of these modes of conception. There is injustice for  a communicative and ethical being in being conceived systematically in ways  that refuse recognition of this status and these characteristics. There is injustice  for such a being in being conceived reductively as body, first because such  conception singles its referent out for treatment as radically less than it is, and  second because such an instrumental reductionism defines the Other in terms  that assume the right of a ‘higher’ group to treat them as a resource for their ends.  Animals so conceived are subject to both radical exclusion (as having a radically  different nature discontinuous from that of the human meat consumer) and  homogenisation—they ‘drown in the anonymous collectivity’ of the commodity  form meat. The radical exclusion aspect of the meat concept denies kinship  and generates a conceptual distance or boundary between humanity and its  ‘meat’ which blocks sympathy, reduces the risk of identification with those so  designated, and silences them as communicative beings. The reductiveness of  the meat concept permits a conceptual strategy designed to block recognition  of these injustices, and its disruption in the concept of the speaking meat is one  source of the flavour of paradox that lingers around that idea.  But from the injustice of industrial society’s institution of meat as commodity,  and the moral cowardice and evasion of the associated conceptual strategies of  denial, we cannot conclude that there is no moral alternative to a universalised  vegetarianism, that there are no other, less ethically problematic ways to resolve  the tensions between conceiving non-humans both as communicative others  and as food. In the complex biological exchange which sustains all our lives, we  must all gain sustenance at the expense of the other, ‘the one living the other’s  7 This is one reason why the task of obtaining an adequate environmental and non-anthrocentric ethic  should not be equated with that of enunciating abstract principles of equal treatment and extending them  to non-human others. Anthrocentric taxonomy will always defeat abstract moral principles, however  comprehensive.  8 Marilyn Frye, The politics of reality, New York, The Crossing Press, p. 67. 60 </page> <page sequence="7"> 5 . ‘Babe’: The tale of the speaking meat  death, and dying the other’s life’, in the words of Heraclitus. Shagbark Hickory  outlines an alternative, non-reductive perspective on this exchange which does  not refuse the moral complexities and perplexities involved: For most or all American Indians food (plant as well as animal) is kin. Relationships  to plants and animals as, on the one hand, food and, on the other hand, kin  creates a tension which is dealt with mythically, ritually, and ceremonially, but  which is never denied. It is this refusal to deny the dilemma in which we are  implicated in this life, a refusal to take the way of bad faith, moral supremacy, or  self-deception which constitutes a radical challenge to our relationships to our  food. The American Indian view that considerability goes “all the way down”  requires a response considerably more sophisticated than those we have seen in  the West, which consist either in drawing lines of moral considerability in order  to create an out-group, or in constructing hierarchies of considerability creating  de facto out-groups in particular cases.9 Many forms of vegetarianism remain trapped in the Western strategies of denial  and radical exclusion which create further out-groups, merely redrawing the  boundary of otherness in a different place, at the border of animality rather than  humanity. In contrast, the indigenous recognition that the central philosophical  problem of human life is that ‘all our food is souls’ points towards non-reductive  practices and understandings of food that resolve the moral failings of ‘bad faith,  moral supremacy, [and] self-deception’ Shagbark Hickory finds implicit in the  dominant Western meat concept. However, to the extent that these alternative  understandings of food form part of a different ‘form of life’, in Wittgenstein’s  sense,10 they are not readily available, either practically or conceptually,  within the context of contemporary industrial life and its commodified food  relationships. Conversely, the fact that vegetarianism may usually be the course  which, in the context of such a commodity society, will best minimise our  complicity in injustice towards others does nothing to support the Eurocentric  conclusion that vegetarianism is a universal moral requirement for all people in  all societies in all situations.11  The paradox of the speaking meat is both the product of a particular social  context, and a powerful symptom of some of the most indicative moral  failings of that context. The Western solution to the moral dilemmas of food  is the creation of a set of moral dualisms, involving a sharp discontinuity  between those who deserve and those who are beyond ethical consideration.  9 Shagbark Hickory, ‘Environmental etiquette/environmental practice: American Indian challenges to  mainstream environmental ethics’, in Max Oelschlaeger ed. The company of others: Essays in celebration of  Paul Shephard, Durango, Colorado, Kivaki Press, 1995.  10 See Wittgenstein, 1954.  11 Carol Adams, The sexual politics of meat and ‘Ecofeminism and the eating of animals’, Hypatia, Vol. 6 No.  1, 1991, pp. 125–145. 61 </page> <page sequence="8"> The Eye of the Crocodile  As we have seen, the speaking meat forces us to confront the way this moral  dualism and discontinuity is based on reductionism, denial and silencing. Our  civilisation’s orientation to the creation of moral dualisms may be one reason  for its technological dominance, since it removes any constraints of respect  which might otherwise hold back development, but it remains a major source of  corruption of our ethical practices. The silencing solutions of moral dualism are  always potentially capable of extension to selected groups of humans counted  as lesser in their humanity, and we have seen this extension made many times  in this century. This silencing possibility is always present, of course, in any  human society, but it is greatly reinforced by the entrenchment of the dualist  model in the basic case of food.  The communicative model  The overarching model which subsumes the commodity model of the animal  and its specific modes of and motives for reduction is the Cartesian–mechanistic  reduction of the non-human animal to its body, and the associated refusal  to recognise non-human animals as akin to human ones in the possession of  mind, intention and communication. Mary Midgley and Barbara Noske12 are  two philosophers who have pointed out that the moral failings implicit in the  modern, commodified concept of meat find their philosophical progenitor in  Cartesian rationalism and the mechanistic model. The rationalist–mechanistic  model of the animal is a key part of the relation between modernity and the  non-human world, and its rationality is expressed both in reductive concepts  like meat and in the practices of the factory farm. The mechanistic model erases  the possibility of communication by denying mind-like properties to non- humans; ideals of manipulation and instrumental rationality are at odds with  communicative ideals and with the conception of the other as a communicative  subject. Babe confronts us with the conflict between the mechanistic model of  the factory farm, and the communicative model of human/animal relations the  film ultimately vindicates. This alternative communicative model is located in  the film in the romantically presented contrast space of the Hoggett’s family farm,  where it struggles to emerge in the unconventional role tolerated for the former  meat animal Babe and Babe’s communicative reformation of relationships with  the sheep. But the farm itself is the site of conflict between the communicative  and the Cartesian–reductive models, for it too contains the meat house and  the animal regimes based on fear and force. The conflict between these models  is also represented in the form of the conflict within the taciturn farmer and  between him and the more conventional farm wife.  12 Margaret Midgley, Animals and why they matter, London, Penguin, 1983 and Barbara Noske, Humans  and other animals, London, Pluto Press, 1989. 62 </page> <page sequence="9"> 5 . ‘Babe’: The tale of the speaking meat  Nevertheless, animal liberationists have some justification for viewing the film’s  major implicit contrast between the factory farm and the family farm with a  sceptical eye. To say that the family farm setting of Babe is highly romanticised  is an understatement. A cynic might say that the family farm parallels the family  as the site of mystifying representations and idealisations. The contrasts of  Babe hide the fact that the family farm model is compatible with, and normally  involves, many oppressive animal husbandry practices; the destination of most  of its animal food-producing units is ultimately the market, and all that has  changed is the indoor setting. This would be, I think, to ignore the fact that  moral differences of degree can be important; it would be like saying that there  is no moral difference between being a worker on a production line and an  inmate of a concentration camp, because both involve some degree of reduction  and instrumentalisation. If there is a moral difference between the smaller scale  farm and the animal gulag, however, there is also normally a lot more continuity  than Babe makes visible.  But to dismiss the implicit contrast of Babe in this way would be to miss  the point that Babe also makes visible a new possibility—the possibility of  replacing a dominant model of mechanistic relations by a communicative one  which recognises the animal’s status as a communicative and moral being and  revolutionises the moral basis of relationships with domestic animals. Whether  this is compatible with farming as we know it remains an open question, but  one the film deserves credit for raising. Babe leaves us in no doubt that meat is  violence, and it posits a model of communication in opposition to that violence,  and hence a new vision of relations to domestic animals. It does not explore  the puzzles in that vision, leaving us with various paradoxes to chew on. But  its communicative model presents a final vision of some power, including the  triumph of the communicative skills and ethic Babe has acquired from the  maternal wisdom of the sheep and various other proxy mothers.  Babe’s status as a communicative subject has received so little attention in the  monstrous regime of the gulag that he does not even have an individual name.  But, as we soon discover when Babe is removed through the device of the  raffle to the relatively enlightened world of the family farm, Babe’s status as a  communicative subject still has many obstacles to overcome to gain recognition.  Before arrival at the farm, Babe is initially just a ‘worthless little runt’, an object  to be weighed, raffled off and eaten. In the idealised world of the Hoggett’s  traditional farm, Babe’s communicative capacities are initially dimly, then more  clearly, recognised by Farmer Hoggett. But they are not initially recognised by  his wife, who addresses him as ‘you lucky little pork chop’ and looks forward to  Babe’s transformation into the familiar commodity form of ‘two nice hams, two  sides of bacon, pork chops, kidneys, liver, chitterling, trotters etc’.  63 </page> <page sequence="10"> The Eye of the Crocodile  The film version of Mrs. Hoggett, unlike the book version, is made to represent  the most closed, convention and consumer-bound version of the human  character.13 Although this elaboration of conflicting perspectives adds some  richness to the film’s themes and characterisation, the linking of the conflict  between the mechanistic and communicative perspectives in this way with  gender introduces elements of androcentrism into the story, obscures the  real connections between gender and consumerism and between gender and  the mechanistic model,14 and generates contradictory messages about the  affirmation of animality. This emerges in the film’s derogatory representation  of the farm wife in animalistic terms and in the implicit demeaning of women’s  understanding and tasks as consumeristic and materialistic, in contrast to the  more ‘spiritual’ orientation of the farmer/ father. Babe’s subjectivity is recognised  by several animal foster mothers, the dog Fly and the sheep Maa, who develop  babe’s communicative and social abilities in the best maternal traditions. But  although Babe’s unusual communicative abilities must ultimately derive from  these various mothers (who must have included the original pig mother he  missed so much), it is their completion and recognition by the father/farmer,  represented as the ‘unprejudiced heart’, that are positioned in the movies as the  key transformative elements for Babe and for the culture more generally. The farmer is, for reasons the film leaves unexplored, open to certain possibilities  of animal communication the others around him are closed to. By various  communicative deeds, babe gradually earns the farmer’s recognition of his  subjectivity, or so he believes, but is devastated by the final – incredible –  discovery of his status as meat, revealed to him by the jealous cat. This apparent  betrayal, (of almost biblical proportions) by the father, almost kills Babe, who  like the duck Ferdie, cannot bear to live as only meat. At this point in the  story, as at the beginning and the end, Babe is positioned as a Christ figure, the  feminised, dependent son who is affirmed and revived by the farmer/father’s  recognition and love, expressed in the dance of life. Together Babe and farmer  go on to accomplish the apparently impossible feat of opening closed minds and  demonstrating Babe’s unrecognised communicative ability to the world. We are  invited to conclude that this revolutionises the treatment of pigs and of farming  generally, reformulating it as an activity based on communication rather than  force and violence. The communicative ethic is also strongly represented by the  (female) sheep, whose persistent faith in and exemplification of the virtues and  values of communication and non-violence is essential to their ultimate victory  over the reductive violence of traditional relationships. 13 In King-Smith 1983, Mrs Hoggett is the first to fully recognise Babe’s contributions and to invite him into  the house, explicitly admitting him to the contract class. 14 Especially since feminists have argued that the mechanistic models which deny communicative power  to nature represent a masculinist response to growing technological mastery, among other things. See for  example Merchant 1980. 64 </page> <page sequence="11"> 5 . ‘Babe’: The tale of the speaking meat  Communicative relationships open up new moral possibilities for organising  life in ways that can negotiate conflicts of interests, build agreement, trust and  mutuality, and avoid instrumentalism and the imposition of the will of one party  on the other by force. Communicative relations don’t necessarily follow out those  possibilities however, and it is important not to romanticise the communicative  model, which does not automatically eliminate the dynamic of power, either in  terms of equality of access, of hierarchy in forms of communication, or of the  structuring of communication in hegemonic ways. There are various strategies  for taking back the greater equality communicative models appear to offer.  Rationalist models which treat communication as an exercise in pure, abstract,  neutral and universal reason, and which delegitimate the more emotional and  bodily forms and aspects of communication, operate to exclude non-humans  from full communicative status just as they exclude various human others  accorded lower human status as further from the rational ideal. These rationalist  models exclude the forms of communication associated with animals along with  the forms of communication associated with women, with non-Western cultures  and with less ‘educated’ classes.15 Communicative models which allow us to overcome these exclusions for humans  will also help us to recognise non-human animals in their denied aspects as  communicative beings, but an excessive emphasis on communication and its  use as a criterion of moral worth or value would remain problematic for non- humans in basing itself on a capacity which may still be highly characteristic  of humanity, and in biasing our valuations heavily towards those species most  similar to ourselves. To overcome this implicit anthrocentrism, a communicative  model would need to be part of a plural set of grounds for valuation, rather than  its unique and exclusive basis, and to be sensitive to communicative capacities  within species as well as to their capacities for communication with humans.  If the film’s communicative vision offers hope of moving on to a new stage beyond  mechanism, it also leaves us with many tantalising questions about this new  stage which arise from the ambivalence of communication. Will communication  be on our terms or theirs? Will Babe’s communicative abilities be used for the  good of the animals or for that of the farmer? If the film's account of the moral  development of ‘the farmer (reaching its climax in the step-dance) offers a vision  of the small farm as a putative future enterprise of love and communication with  nature and animals, the film also casts little light on the question of what the  communicative farm would be like. Will the new communicative paradigm be  used to liberate the sheep and the other farm animals, or merely to oppress them  in more subtle and self-complicit ways? Will the communicative animal farm  stand to the mechanistic farm as the hegemonic communicative forms of liberal  15 Iris Young, ‘Communication and the other: Beyond deliberative democracy,’ in Margaret Wilson and  Anna Yeatman, eds, Justice and identity: Antipodean practices, Sydney, Allen and Unwin, 1995, pp. 134–152. 65 </page> <page sequence="12"> The Eye of the Crocodile  democracy stand to the more repressive forms of patriarchal–authoritarian  governance they replaced? The distinction between democracy and despotism  is supposedly built on such a contrast, but as it becomes increasingly clear how  little our own society resembles the democratic ideal of free and open dialogue  to which all have access, it also becomes clear how our communicative abilities  can be used to control and imprison us. A new communicative stage of human– nature relationships would need to place such questions at the centre of its  critical thought: at this level, the tale of the speaking meat has only just begun.  Part II Communication and anthropomorphism  Babe’s opening shot shows Babe waking in communicative interaction with  siblings, expressing sorrow at the loss of his mother and fear as he is seized  and carried away. These are all emotions we can realistically expect real pigs  to feel and express in this situation, and Babe’s ‘human’ speech as it emerges in  this context seems a natural expression of these emotions, wishes and beliefs.  The animal communication introduced here works well because it continues  and extends the normal body language and communication of the animals.  Nevertheless, the representation of such animal subjectivity in human terms is  often said to be irresolvably problematic and invalidly ‘anthropomorphic’. It is  worth considering and clarifying this charge in relation to the representation of  animal communication and subjectivity in works of art.  We need to distinguish various senses of anthropomorphism, including general  and specific senses. The general concept and charge of anthropomorphism,  as Mary Midgley has argued, is in its usual sense and definition thoroughly  confused.16 It is ambiguous as between attributing to non-humans characteristics  humans have (OED), and attributing to non-humans characteristics only humans  have. Both senses are problematic, in slightly different ways, when used to support  the claim that the attribution of characteristics such as subjectivity to animals  must be anthropomorphic. The first sense, that something is anthropomorphic  if it attributes to animals characteristics humans have, implies that there is no  overlap of characteristics between humans and non-human animals. That is, it  assumes a duality of human and animal natures and attempts to enforce upon  legitimate representations of non-humans such a radical discontinuity. This  sense should clearly be rejected, not only because it is based on a demonstrably  16 Mary Midgley, Animals and why they matter, London, Penguin, 1983. 66 </page> <page sequence="13"> 5 . ‘Babe’: The tale of the speaking meat  false assumption of radical discontinuity, but because it could be used to  delegitimate virtually any depiction of non-human subjectivity that made sense  to us.  The second sense of anthropomorphism—attributing to non-humans  characteristics only humans have—is not open to this objection, but is open to  the objection that its use to delegitimate the attribution of subjectivity and other  contested characteristics to non-humans is simply question-begging. It assumes  just what is at issue, what opponents of the mechanistic model contest, that  non-humans do not have characteristics such as subjectivity and intentionality  humans also possess. And furthermore, such a sense is otiose and human- centred. If a representation attributes to non-humans characteristics they do  not have, that provides (in a strictly veridical context) sufficient independent  ground for rejecting such an attribution. It is simply anthrocentric to go on  to add that humans do have such characteristics, and to focus on this as the  grounds for error. There is no good basis for the general claim that an artwork  is invalidated by anthropomorphism just because it attributes subjectivity and  communication to non-humans in a general way.  Nevertheless, there may still a point in more specific and limited senses and  charges of anthropomorphism. One sense of anthropomorphism we might appeal  to here would be analogous to, say, certain ways of rejecting Eurocentrism which  object to representing the non-European other in terms of a European norm.  This sense would enable an argument that the mode of representation adopted  in particular, specific cases denied the difference of animals and represented  them in terms of a human model. The argument would be that, although  animals do have subjectivity and do communicate, the representation of that  communication in the terms of human speech adopted by a film like Babe is  invalidly anthropomorphic, depicted in excessively human terms.  One problem with this argument is that, although it looks as if this sense appeals  to a concept of anthropomorphism different from the objectionable general one,  it is in danger of degenerating into a similarly general form. To bring this out,  we need to ask, what is the contrast class? What mode of representing animal  subjectivity or communication, beyond its bare recording without any attempt  to convey a meaning or place in the animal’s life (as in commentary-free films  of wolves howling or whales making sounds), would not be subject to this  kind of objection? Any representation for a human audience will have to be,  in some sense, an interpretation in human terms, just as any representation of  a non-European culture’s speech for a European audience would have to be in  European terms, in the sense that it will have to try to locate the meaning of the  speech in terms of the closest equivalent forms of life.  67 </page> <page sequence="14"> The Eye of the Crocodile  The problem we run into here is the problem familiar from the case of  representing human cultural difference, of translation and indeterminacy. For  there are many well-known traps and difficulties in such representation in the  human case, and in establishing or assuming equivalence in forms of life in  the human case. These ensure that a weak analogue to anthropomorphism is  involved in virtually any translation project, in any attempt to ‘bring over’ one  culture’s forms into another’s. To avoid delegitimating all such attempts, we  need to distinguish weaker and stronger forms of anthropomorphism, just as  we need to distinguish weak and usually harmless forms of anthropocentrism  from strong and damaging forms.17  An unwarrantedly or strongly ‘Euromorphic’ depiction of another culture’s  customs and speech would involve a methodology which tended unquestioningly  to impose a European framework of expectations and norms, failing to note non- equivalences in forms of life or to treat difficulties about translation as sources of  uncertainty and tentativeness. On this model, we might expect an appropriate  methodology for dealing with difference and translation indeterminacy in the  non-human case to be one which could hold relatively open expectations,  noting the presence of uncertainty and adopting a tentative stance which  explored a range of alternatives and attempted to imagine and situate concept  formation in terms of different forms of life. Both human and non-human cases  require openness to the other and careful, sensitive, and above all, self-critical  observation which admitted and allowed for perspectival and ‘centric’ biases.18  The problems in representing another species’ speech or subjectivity in human  terms are real, but they do not rule out such representation in any general  way, and they pale before the difficulties of failing to represent them at all, or  before the enormity of representing communicative and intentional beings as  beings lacking all communicative and mental capacity. That is a much greater  inaccuracy and injustice than any anthropomorphism.  These points show I think that the charge of anthropomorphism cannot  be used in a general way to delegitimate representations of non-humans as  communicative subjects; charges of strong anthropomorphism may still be  viable but require much more work to situate and establish than is usually  accorded them. With weak anthropomorphism, the question is not whether or  not some degree of humanisation is present in any particular representation  of animal communication or of animal characteristics, but how damaging it is,  and for what purposes? Undoubtedly there can be great variations and moral  differences here, but again, we cannot rule out the mixed perspective which  places a human subjectivity into an animal situation, for example, as worthless  17 Val Plumwood, ‘Androcentrism and anthrocentrism: Parallels and politics’, Ethics and the environment,  Vol. 1 No. 2, 1996, 119–152. 18 Sandra Harding, Whose science, whose knowledge? Milton Keynes, Open University Press, 1999. 68 </page> <page sequence="15"> 5 . ‘Babe’: The tale of the speaking meat  or unenlightening, especially in a radically non-veridical (fairy tale, fictional  or cartoon) context where fidelity is not a virtue. Indeed, as the Larsen cartoon  demonstrates, such ‘anthropomorphic’ transferences of perspective, especially  where conscious of their human importations, may be not only funny but  philosophically revealing, about ourselves as well as about the other. But if  there is no general argument that such weakly anthropomorphic mixtures are  deceptive and illegitimate, specific cases have to be argued on their merits, not  in terms of the alleged intrusion of human impurities but in terms of the kinds  of insights they present or prevent and the moral quality of their representation.  Anthrocentrism is a clearer concept than anthropomorphism (although by no  means uncontested or unambiguous),19 and one which also bears more clearly  on the moral quality of an artwork that represents the animal. Compare the kind  of humanisation displayed in Babe with the Disney paradigm of humanisation.  Disney cartoons are usually only superficially about animals; Disney characters  with stereotypical animal bodies often have totally humanised personalities,  frequently incorporate little or no recognisable reference to the characteristics  or situations of the animals represented, and permit no representation of their  relationship to the human or membership of the mixed community. The animal  form appears in this anthrocentric conception as a nullity which is made to  bear the burden of meanings which have no connection with the animal’s  own subjectivity or situation. The Disney paradigm, normalised in television  cartoons, is one in which animals are, in John Berger’s words, ‘totally transformed  into human puppets’ whose main role is to naturalise various hegemonic forms  of the human condition by attributing them to the animal ‘kingdom’.20  The erasure of animals in the Disney animal cartoon is objectionable in ways  that directly reflect its anthrocentrism and its contribution to growing human  self-enclosure and incorporation of the other, in this case expressed in the  inability to encounter the animal as an independent other who is more than a  disguised form of self. These incorporative movements also underlie the highly  anthrocentric assumption I criticised above, that an ‘animal film’ can only be  taken seriously to the extent that it is actually about humans. In contrast, a less  anthrocentric and belittling treatment would take animals seriously as agents,  communicative subjects, bearers of knowledge, and members of the mixed  community who are able themselves to observe us and perhaps to reflect critically  on their relationships with us. On these sorts of criteria of anthrocentrism in the  treatment of the animal other, ‘our Babe’ comes out rather well.  Criminals, women, animals—all these are bearers of a denied or lessened form  of subjecthood, which cannot itself command the position of knower but which  19 Val Plumwood, ‘Androcentrism and anthrocentrism’.  20 John Berger, About looking. 69 </page> <page sequence="16"> The Eye of the Crocodile  is the object of an arrogant form of knowledge which so stereotypes and denies  their difference and their speech that they are obliterated as possible subjects  of reciprocal exchange or dialogical encounter. As Foucault notes, to be always  under such an arrogating observation is also the fate of the prisoner, and as  feminists have pointed out, a feminised subjectivity is one in which the subject  internalises such a male gaze. John Berger has claimed that this arrogating  conception of the other has now gone so far for animals that the animal proper  is now irrecoverable for us as a possible other for encounter and communicative  exchange. He writes, ‘... animals are always the observed. The fact that they can  observe us has lost all significance. They are the objects of our ever-extending  knowledge. What we know about them is an index of our power, and thus an  index of what separates us from them. The more we know, the further away  they are’.21 This diagnosis is acute but, in my view, a trifle too fatalistic. Works  of art like Babe can help us subvert these anthrocentric conceptions of the  animal and recover the animal as subject and reciprocal observer rather than as  background, passively observed object; thus, in the final shot of Babe, it is the  animal who looks back.  Meat and the Colonising Contract  Among the film’s other pleasures are the way the lead character Babe, from  his position as speaking meat, systematically disrupts each of the background  assumptions of meat I identified in Part 1. In the initial scenes of the film, we have  (briefly) to confront the first assumption of radical discontinuity in the animal  gulag, and the second as we are introduced to the meat as a speaking subject.  The third assumption, that of a neat, rational and unproblematic hierarchy of  considerability based on intellectual ranking, is systematically disrupted by  Babe and several other characters throughout the film, and this is one of its  main ‘breaking out’ arising in post-colonial theory themes and best subversive  achievements. Thus Babe’s assertion of intelligence and communicative status  disrupts Fly’s comfortable assurances to her puppies that ‘only stupid animals’  are eaten. This disruption poses ethical and political questions, analogous to  questions arising in post-colonial theory about the role of colonial hierarchies,  about the distinction between meat and non-meat animals, and about the nature  of the human contract with that special, more privileged group of animals who  can never be ‘meat’. ‘Babe’ is the name of an innocent, an original, Christ-like pure soul, to whom the  first news of the dirty secret of meat is eventually revealed in the outhouse by the  revolutionary duck Ferdie—where the meat comes from, where ‘babe’ (‘babies)  himself comes from, in an act of disillusionment which neatly parallels that of  21 John Berger, About looking, p. 16. 70 </page> <page sequence="17"> 5 . ‘Babe’: The tale of the speaking meat  the human child newly discovering reproductive and sexual relationships. (‘Not  the Boss!’ breathes the incredulous Babe, in parallel with the child’s shocked  ‘Not my parents!’) But it is from the malevolent cat that Babe finally learns  the full hurt of the dreadful secret the factory farm and the sinister farm meat  household. The unspeakable is finally spoken: pigs are meat, pigs are subjects,  and pigs suffer the reductive violence which denies, distances from, and hides  their subjectivity. Babe is only called ‘pig’ while he is alive, but ‘they use a  different word, “pork or bacon”, after you are dead’, explains the satisfied cat,  revelling in her privileged, protected status. As Babe’s innocence is stripped  away bit by bit, we see the gradual unveiling of various levels and kinds of  animal oppressions and colonisations—the baring of the ‘world of wounds’ we  all somehow learn to come to terms with as part of our loss of innocence and  ‘adult’ accommodation to an oppressive world. Positioned as counter to these various unveilings of oppression are various  emancipatory comments and viewpoints from the animals who are presented  as sceptical and critical spectators of the human show. Their comments deftly  expose the politics of the mixed community, especially its human violence  and surrogate dog violence, and the strangeness of human ways. They give us  positive perspectives on the importance of listening to and being open to others,  and on the injustice, distortion and violence of the exclusionary boundaries  which keep Babe positioned as meat. We feel the thrill of broken chains, the  excitement of emancipation as Babe is gradually enabled to break the boundaries  which keep him positioned as meat, finally crossing the privileged threshold of  the house from which he has been so pointedly excluded to watch television  with the farmer and his surrogate dog–mother Fly.  What I found particularly illuminating here was the exposure of the levels of  hierarchy among animals created by human colonisation in the small human  empire of the farm, an empire which makes concrete human desire and human  will in its social relations and its rational design of the earth and of the animals  themselves. The film displays the key role of these boundaries of exclusion and  levels of hierarchy among animals in maintaining the practices of meat and the  non-subject status of the meat animal. The dogs, in the canine equivalent of  human chauvinism, attribute their privilege with some complacency to their  greater intelligence, but that facile fabrication is disrupted for us nicely by  Babe’s pig intelligence in some of the film’s earliest scenes. What is exposed as  unstable, duplicitous and oppressive here is the conventional boundary and  contract on which the relatively privileged status of the pet and ‘house’ animal is  based, which bears on the privileged status of dogs and cats in Western society.  71 </page> <page sequence="18"> The Eye of the Crocodile  Because it reveals the conventionality and instability of the considerability  hierarchy among animals, the film provides us with the materials to reconstruct  the Contract or political origin story for the privileged group of ‘pets’ or  conventional companion animals. In early times, hunting, farming and  shepherding man (‘the Boss’) in certain societies made a contract with certain  wolves: the contract was that they would be given a respected role and position  very different from that of other animals, that they would never be meat, in return  for help with a critical task. That task was their active help in the oppression  and imprisonment of other animals, whom they would help confine and  construct as meat. In return for their help in constructing other animals as meat,  not only would they themselves never be meat, they would be ‘looked after’, given  a share of the meat themselves. Their subjectivity would be recognised, and the  reductive Cartesian conception would never apply to them. In the same sense  as in various human mythic Contracts or founding political stories of alleged  mutual benefit, this was a Contract of complicity in meat. But as the disruptions  of Babe neatly demonstrate, inclusion in the contract class has nothing to do  with ‘intelligence’, and everything to do with complicity. This contract, originally a contract of privilege in return for complicity in the  practice of meat and the domination or elimination of the non-contract animals,  is later extended to the privileged companion animals—the pets—with which so  many of us continue to share our lives, and whom we continue to feed on the  flesh of other ‘meat’ animals. The malevolent cat in Babe is seen thus profiting  from the death of the Christmas duck, Rosalyn; in real life, non-privileged  animals assigned to the ‘meat’ side of the hierarchy die to make meat for the  pets of people who think of themselves unproblematically as animal lovers— kangaroos, dolphins, penguins, anonymous and rare marine animals in yearly  billions are slaughtered at some remove to feed the cats and dogs whose own  deaths as meat would be unthinkable to their owners. The companion contract,  albeit in a form less oriented to the working animal, remains as strong as ever,  and is a major factor in constructing our cuddly versus non-cuddly boundary,  and our domestic/wild, clean/dirty, house/outside boundaries as well.  For most urban dwellers, which increasingly is most of us, animals of the  Contract Class represent our main contact with the animal world. This is  unfortunate, because the Companion Contract reflects and repeats many of  the duplicities, denials and exclusions involved in the surrounding Western  institution of meat. In historical terms, it is the equivalent of the key colonial  contract of empire, the one the coloniser has always been able to make, to his  great advantage, with the privileged class among the colonised. In the history  of the colonisation of Scotland and Ireland, and everywhere in the history of  colonisation, some privileged class of the indigenous is selected to carry out  the coloniser’s dirty work and to control and oppress indigenous populations.  72 </page> <page sequence="19"> 5 . ‘Babe’: The tale of the speaking meat  Without this type of contract, colonisation, in most cases, would not have  been possible. This type of contract depends on erecting dualistic boundaries,  originally based on instrumental criteria of merit as cooperativeness, complicity  and assimilation, and on the need to use some of the colonised to exploit and  imprison others. This contract creates the strongly dualistic boundaries of the  ‘pet’ and ‘meat’ animal; the pet animal is a communicative and ethical subject,  ideally subject to consideration, the meat animal is not. The contract forms part  of an assimilationist strategy toward the other, in which they are recognised by  the colonising self just to the extent that they resemble, express or serve the  Self. It is this tainted division that enables our simultaneous claim to love some  animals and to have a right to ruthlessly exploit other animals who are not very  different, to simultaneously admit pet subjectivity and ignore or deny meat– animal subjectivity.  The contract does much to explain the extraordinary contradictions involved  in our contemporary treatment of animals and our claims to love and respect  animals. For example, it is this original colonising contract that ‘animal lovers’  honour when they, perhaps even sometimes as vegetarians or vegans themselves,  bring into existence and even breed pet animals whom they feed on the ‘meat’  of other animals; or whom pet lovers irresponsibly introduce to inappropriate  environments where they are permitted to make other animals meat and to  disrupt carefully balanced and negotiated communities of free-living animals.  These result in such abuses as the dumping of domestic cats in the wild by  ‘animal lovers’, to become a menace to indigenous animals in contexts like  Australia where there may be few checks and balances.  It is essential to break down this residual contract and its associated dualisms  if we are to overcome the taboo against recognising the subjectivity of the meat  animal, as well as the general failure to recognise animal subjectivity. The moral  dualism of this contract plays a key role in obscuring the immorality of meat,  especially factory farmed meat. Most people have had some positive experiences  with such animals as dogs or cats, have allowed themselves to experience them  as narrative and communicative subjects rather than as Cartesian ‘machine– animals’ or as mindless bodies. But it is the ethical dualism and impermeability  of this contract boundary which prevents them transferring this awareness  to other animals considered ‘meat animals’ or to wild animals, and which is  reflected in the contradiction of the animal lover’s horror taboo against eating  dogs and contrasting indifference or complacency about the horrific treatment  of the ‘meat animal’.  Babe takes us quite some distance then towards pushing over this key barrier to  a better consciousness of the moral status of all animals, showing us how Babe  is excluded from the contract as meat, and how both Babe and the sheep are  oppressed by the privileged status of the dogs and cats. But in another crucial  73 </page> <page sequence="20"> The Eye of the Crocodile  way the film fails to resolve some key issues surrounding the contract. For one  way to read Babe’s liberation in the end of the film is as the supposition that the  colonising contract can and should be extended, that Babe’s liberation consists  in joining or displacing the dogs in the colonising contract, now recast in the  role of non-violent communicator with the rest of the farm animals.  Is Babe’s liberation then no more than that of the pet, the correction of a  mistaken individual placement in the hierarchical order of rational meritocracy?  Or can Babe’s liberation be somehow extended to all other animals? Here we  come up against the liberal understanding of liberation as individual salvation,  which generates the same problems that various human liberation movements  encounter in liberalism. To the extent that it is an exclusionary contract, in  which some make a living by complicity in instrumentalising, imprisoning and  oppressing others, the contract of colonisation cannot be extended to provide  liberation for all. Such a contract cannot be made liberatory for all by being  extended to each, one at a time, and the attempt to do so merely re-erects the  moral dualist barrier in a new place. If Babe is to be saved because of his resemblance to the human and his  discontinuity from other animals, we can recognise this as the same colonising  contract some forms of liberal feminism have endorsed, to elevate some by  complicity in the oppression of others. Feminists such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton,  for example, argued that women should be admitted to the privileged class of  political rights-holders in virtue of their discontinuity with allegedly ‘lower  groups’ such as negro slaves, and their similarity to the master group, elite white  men. The door opens to admit a few, but closes to keep the rest outside where  they were. One boundary of moral dualism is momentarily penetrated, but the  rest remain in place or new ones are constructed. So the film apparently displays  Babe’s liberation, but leaves us with the big questions about whether Babe will  be admitted alone, with all other pigs, with some other pigs, with all other  animals, or with everything we might consider food? That the political vision  of animal liberation poses many of the same political and recognition problems  and ambiguities that appear for human liberation should be no surprise. It is yet  another confirmation of our kinship.  74 </page> </plain_text>
