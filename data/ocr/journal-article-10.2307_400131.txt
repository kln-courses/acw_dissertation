<plain_text><page sequence="1">GERMAN LITERATURE IN EXILE: FRANZ WERFEL HAROLD VON HOFE WHEN Austria was joined to Germany in March, 1938, Franz Werfel augmented the group of writers representing German litera- ture in exile. Only forty-seven at this time-still a comparatively young man--he had already been acclaimed as a poet who would be outlived by his poems. The first volume of verse, Der Welt- freund (1911), was published in a second edition some weeks after its original appearance. Only a few months before its publication Franz Werfel had been employed as a bookkeeper in Hamburg. He had found the business world distasteful, however, as had Heinrich Heine, Richard Dehmel, and Thomas Mann before him. Der Weltfreund was regarded as a singularly mature work for so young a poet. Of interest to us at the moment is the fact that it foreshadowed two facets of his philosophy evident in the major- ity of his works to the present day. One is a vigorous anti-war attitude, which was expressed unequivocally a few years later in Der Ulan (1914). The second is Christian religiousness which Wer- fel made known uncompromisingly in Christliche Sendung (1917), of which we shall speak later. From 1911 to 1912 he served a year of military service with a field howitzer regiment in Prague, the city of his birth, and in 1914 was called to the colors with the same regiment. During the fol- lowing year he spent several months in a hospital after having sustained injuries in a railroad accident. He was back in uniform before the year was out, however, serving in the Austro-Hungarian army until 1917. Subsequently Vienna became his home. Shortly after the end of the first World War he married the daughter of the painter Schindler, also the former wife of the composer Gustav Mahler. The marriage has proved not only a source of personal happiness but it has also provided a harmonious and stimulating setting for his creative work. In the years that followed, an increasing number of poems, dramas, short stories, and novels issued from his pen. Not a me- thodical writer but a tremendously facile one, Werfel wrote many of his works between midnight and dawn. "Literatur kam bei mir immer wie aus Versehen," he remarked recently. His first story, Nicht der Mirder, der Ermordete ist Schuldig (1919) was written 263</page><page sequence="2">264 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY in a matter of days, Das Lied von Bernadette (1941) in two months. In the years after the first war his energy was abundant and his zest for living keen. Although he was regarded as the most gifted expressionistic poet, his expressionistic period was relatively brief. Today he refers to some of the poems written at that time as "unverstindliche ex- pressionistische Gedichte." Yet there are many which will have enduring value. At the present, when Werfel's name is associated with a number of best selling novels, it is easy to forget that he is primarily a lyric poet. One of his greatest popular successes of the twenties was Verdi, Roman der Oper (1924), reflecting his lifelong interest in music, specifically Italian vocal music, which has been a constant source of stimulus to him. In collaboration with Mrs. Werfel, in whose life music has always stood in the foreground of interest, he wrote new texts for Verdi's Forza del Destino, Don Carlos, and Simon Boc- canegra. At the present time Mrs. Werfel still plays, almost daily, excerpts from Italian operas while her husband listens or softly hums the tune in accompaniment. Their home in California exhibits evidence of the musicality which has played so prominent a part in both their lives. Framed letters of composers and of old musical scores adorn the walls. Werfel's reputation as one of the outstanding writers of our time grew from year to year. Large editions in German and in translations testified to his popularity. Richard Specht referred to him as one of the very few who revealed true genius. William Drake spoke of him as a poet, who, of all his generation in Germany, ap- peared to have the surest chance of reaching that desideratum of remembrance which the optimistic term immortality. At the same time, however, an undertone of hostility, soft but growing in volume, attended his rise to eminence. There were liberal thinkers who took issue with his "Christeln," but more strident voices of animosity emanated from groups in Germany with a strongly National So- cialist orientation. A crescendo outburst took place in the East Prussian city of Insterburg in 1932 where Franz Werfel gave his speech, Kinnen wir ohne Gottesglauben Leben? before a students' club. Members of the audience characterized his assertion that hu- manity could not live without Christianity and faith in God as a communistic trick and the speaker was compelled to leave the hall to the accompaniment of derisive shouts.</page><page sequence="3">GERMAN LITERATURE IN EXILE: FRANZ WERFEL 265 The German change of regime in 1933 did not occasion his exile as was the case with other writers, for his home was Austria. There he enjoyed friendship with leading figures in political life, among them the late Chancellor Dollfuss. The beginning of his exile was thus postponed five years. February, 1938, found him on the isle of Capri. Since sources of information which were open to Mrs. Werfel warned of imminent danger, she returned to Vienna in order to prepare for eventualities. The crisis came sooner than anticipated and on March 13, 1938, Mrs. Werfel left Austria. Mr. Werfel had meanwhile left Capri and his wife was able to rejoin him in Milan after being compelled to make a considerable detour via Prague, Budapest, and Trieste. The next few months were spent in bewildering travel: a month in Ziirich, two weeks in Paris, several weeks in Amsterdam on the occasion of a Gustav Mahler festival, and a short stay in London. Stories of their experiences and of their dilemma were met with incredulity. "Wir sind herumgegangen wie die Kassandra, und nie- mand hat uns geglaubt," as Mrs. Werfel phrased it. Ultimately their home became France where they shuttled between Paris and Sanary, a small fishing village on the shores of the Mediterranean. The outbreak of the war in 1939 brought new difficulties, for those of German or Austrian origin, regardless of background, were suspect to the French. Domiciliary visits by the police were fre- quent. On one occasion Franz Werfel, accused of communism, was undressed and searched on the street. From September, 1939, on, they attempted in vain to get permis- sion from the authorities to leave France. Disappointed hopes, dread, and presentiment reached a climax in June, 1940. Werfel sketched briefly that period of anxiety in the preface to Das Lied von Bernadette. Many nights were spent in the open. Finally, on Friday, September 13, they crossed the French-Spanish border be- tween Cerbbre and Portbou, near the very edge of the Mediter- ranean. French gendarmes had considerately turned their backs as the couple proceeded on foot across the Pyrenees. Well treated in Spain, they journeyed to Barcelona, Madrid, and ultimately to Lisbon. A month's wait in Lisbon marked the last stage of their escape. In October they secured passage to New York on the Nea Hellas. Co-passengers were Heinrich Mann and his wife who had undergone similar experiences before boarding ship. Except for a fleeting stay in New York, Franz Werfel's Ameri-</page><page sequence="4">266 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY can home has been Los Angeles where he arrived on the last day of 1940. The narrator of Nicht der Marder, der Ermordete ist Schuldig had declared in the epilogue of that story more than twenty years ago that he had struck a new bargain: he was thinking of buying a small farm out West in America. Franz Werfel has not become a "farmer out West" but he does live in a comfortable home with a picturesque garden in California. In consequence of a severe heart ailment during the last year, fears were often felt for his life. One was unpleasantly reminded of Sebastian in Abituriententag who confessed that he could not put any strain on his heart whose uneven beating was so alarming when he lay sleepless at night. Wr. Werfel is fortunately much im- proved at the present time. The number of Werfel publications since his deparature from Austria is considerable. In the latter part of 1938, Von der Rein- sten Gliickseligkeit des Menschen appeared in Stockholm. In 1939 (Stockholm): Der Veruntreute Himmel, and Gedichte aus dreil3ig Jahren, including poems not published heretofore; 1941: Das Lied von Bernadette (Stockholm), and Eine Blai3blaue Frauenschrift (Buenos Aires); 1942: Die Wahre Geschichte vom Wiederhergestell- ten Kreuz (Los Angeles), and Verdi, the Man in his Letters (New York).-The latter had been published in German previously but it appeared here with a new introduction; 1944: Jacobowsky and the Colonel (New York), in the excellent translation by Professor Arlt, chairman of the Department of German, U.C.L.A., and also in the adaptation by S. N. Behrman. The German original, Jacobow- sky und der Oberst, as well as Das Lied von Bernadette will be used as texts in the very near future. Gdza Vdrsany: Wann Wirst Du Endlich eine Seele Bekommen, the story of a Hungarian prodigy, will appear in English before it is published in German. A significant book, Between Heaven and Earth, will be available late in 1944. The volume contains four documents which reveal Werfel's struggle against the Zeitgeist termed "naturalistic nihilism." Three of them are known to us: Realismus und Innerlichkeit (1930), K6nnen Wir ohne Gottesglauben Leben? (1932), and Von der Reinsten Gliick- seligkeit des Menschen (1938). The fourth, entitled Theologumena, which Mr. Werfel has graciously placed at my disposal in its origi- nal German manuscript form, was begun in 1942 and completed in May, 1944. What is the nature of the struggle waged by Franz Werfel in</page><page sequence="5">GERMAN LITERATURE IN EXILE: FRANZ WERFEL 267 these documents and what is the historical background of the strife? We shall review briefly an important aspect of intellectual history since we can understand much of Franz Werfel's work only in the light of such historical perspective: Only two hundred years ago enduring values of life were accepted unquestioningly by the masses of Western civilization. In regard to personal philosophy among the masses, life was unproblematic. Answers to the eternal wherefroms and wheretos were laid in the cradle, endowed with absolute validity. The Reformation had created a schism, to be sure, but divine origin and cogency of the scriptures were acknowledged as beyond doubt. Difference of opinion was found, until the beginning of the nineteenth century, only on the higher intellectual levels. One of the earliest members of that stratum was Giordano Bruno, who had placed old testament scriptures on a level with pagan myths, and who had rejected anthropomorphic forms of religion. Death at the stake was his reward in the year 1600. Disloyalty to the Church was to this earlier age what disloyalty to the nation is in ours. The passing of homage from religious to political creeds marks one of the most interesting chapters of modern history. The conclusion is still to be written but one can sketch briefly the development up to the present time. Although most scientists and philosophers of the seventeenth century continued to profess some definite form of Christianity, Pierre Bayle assailed it strongly, using as his weapon ridicule, one of the most effective means of attack. His Critical and Biographical Dictionary (1697) mocked and derided all traditional religious beliefs and dogmas. The Dictionary was not without influence and the eighteenth century lent impetus to the challenge. Voltaire's attacks on "l'infame"-his favorite epithet in characterizing organized authori- tarian Christianity, Holbach's Christianity Unveiled (1767), the Encyclopedists who gathered in Holbach's salon, and others nurtured and furthered the rebellion. The Deists sought to extract the sting from the weapons of anti- Christian forces by reconciling traditional religion with the latest findings of natural science and by rejecting all supernatural evidence. They were only partially successful and skepticism continued to grow. It must not be assumed, however, that the revolt against unquestioned religious faith had taken root among widespread groups. A large proportion of the people were still illiterate and therefore without access to the new ideas. Personal and religious codes of value remained constant and relatively unchanged for the populace. It was only later that three forces joined hands unwittingly in weaning Western man from Christianity and hastening the arrival of the problematic age. The first was Immanuel Kant, who demonstrated that the human mind was equipped to know and to understand only a fractional portion of the universe and that absolute knowledge was denied to it forever. The second was compulsory education which furnished the masses of people tools with which to unlock the Pandora's box of doubt. And the third was growth of the publishing business which refilled the box assiduously. Meanwhile blow fell upon blow. Copernicus had taught that the earth was not the center of this world. Darwin and Haeckel ascertained that man was not the center of this earth. And Freud pointed out that we didn't know</page><page sequence="6">268 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY what we were doing or why we were doing it most of the time anyway. Small wonder that minds either despaired, sought new values in a multitude of ways, or regained respite in traditional religion! Most human beings are not made of the stuff capable of attaining to an arbitrary set of values through personal struggles and suffering. They require something greater than they with which to identify themselves. Patriotism and nationalism, developments of the last 150 years supplied one way out: To work and live for one's countryI Vive la France! Deutschland iiber allesl Just as the Christian faith, however, had fostered rebels at its bosom, so the nationalistic faith was faced with objectors who proclaimed that patriotism was a cheap thing and that the only respectable faith was a political one divorced from nationalism. The best case in point is communism, which indeed became a political religion capable of inspiring a fervor and readiness for sacrifice comparable to that engendered by Christianity in the early centuries of its history. "Traditional religion is an opiate for the people" became the watchword of the new political faith which grew to be as dogmatic and rigid in its concepts as any religion in the history of the world. The rival bidders for allegiance today are nationalistic religion, political religion, and traditional religion. Many are able to find comfort in one of the three faiths or in a combination. Others, who either "take the cash and let the credit go," or who struggle sincerely to find new solutions, have renounced belief by and large. Yet there are among them many who flirt with one of the three faiths, particularly that of traditional religion, motivated in part by intellectual curiosity and in part by lingering suspicion that ultimate truth is to be found there. A few return to the fold of Christianity, of whom a number find calm and repose in the receptive arms of the Catholic Church. More venturesome thinkers or those with mystical leanings are attracted to esoteric religions. The stream of such movements swells when personal tragedies and suffering mount and when the questioning of values is brought into sharper relief. Such was the case in the course of the first World War and such is the case now. Franz Werfel is ready to admit that the period depicted so sketchily above was one of tremendous material progress. He adds the significant proviso, however, that the growth of religious dis- belief also occasioned an abysmal moral decline. He has the fol- lowing to say about "progress," this child of the eighteenth cen- tury with its belief in the material and social perfectability of human life: "Ob national oder international, ob biologisch oder ikonomisch begriindet, es sind nur geringe Unterschiede in dieser naiven Zu- kunftsgliubigkeit, der tiefsten Ungliiubigkeit, die den allgemeinen Materialismus ausmacht."' Viewing the modern age as a Promethean one of melancholy and despair Werfel characterizes the product of that age: Franz tWerfel, Von der Reinsten Glikkseligkeit des Menschen (Stock- holm, 1938), p. 37.</page><page sequence="7">GERMAN LITERATURE IN EXILE: FRANZ WERFEL 269 Der moderne Mensch will es nicht fiir wahr halten, daB gewisse schipferische Kriifte in ihm bankrottiert haben, daB er eine sportgestiihlte Bettelgestalt des grol3en Verlustes ist. Er glaubt sich vielmehr im Besitze eines Schuldscheins der Gliickseligkeit, der einst eingel6st wird, wenn seine politische Ersatzreligion die materiellen Vorbedingungen dazu geschaffen hat.2 The only possession of the modern man depicted by Werfel is his ego which he is in constant fear of losing. In the collective sense Werfel calls this view of life naturalistic nihilism, the dominant popular philosophy of the European-Russian-American urban popu- lation. The growth of large cities has furthered the extension of natu- ralistic nihilism considerably. In them man has lost his significance as a cosmic being. Deprivation of cosmic consciousness is in a spiritual sense the secret purpose of the metropoles. "Hier, in Maschinenhallen, in Biiros, Kinos und Cafes, iiberwindet der Mensch das niederdonnernde Gefiihl dessen, was er auf seiner itherwindum- brausten Sternfahrt in Wahrheit ist und nicht ist."3 In the large urban centers man has lost particularly the capacity to love. The erstwhile cynic, Hyacinthe de Lafite, is compelled to admit in Das Lied von Bernadette that his desolate aloneness was a logical re- sult. He had loved no one and nothing, not even himself. For this lack of love retribution is exacted from humanity: Die Menschheit mu3 sich ununterbrochen selbst bestrafen. Und zwar, sehr logisch, fuir die Siinde der Lieblosigkeit, aus der unser ganzer Jammer entsteht und sich Glied um Glied weiter entwickelt.' In our pre-occupation with rightist or leftist orientation in politics we have forgotten that there is an "oben und unten," which to Wer- fel, is the very crux of the issues facing us. What is the ultimate issue of World War II? ". .. viel mehr steht auf dem Spiel als Freiheit und anstiindiges Leben, das geschiindete Kreuz niimlich, ohne das wir in Nacht versinken miissen."5 Political materialistic ideals alone cannot prepare the way for a better world. At best they can lead to the caricature portrayed by Aldous Huxley some years ago in This Brave New World. "All dergleichen bedeutet ' Ibid., p. 19. SFranz Werfel, K6nnen Wir ohne Gottesglauben Leben? (Berlin, 1932), p. 37. 'Franz Werfel, Die Wahre Geschichte vom Wiederhergestellten Kreuz (Los Angeles, 1942), p. 32. " Ibid., p. 49.</page><page sequence="8">270 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY eine frech-listerliche Hypostasierung des Kiirpers zur einzigen Gottheit und verbirgt hinter gespreizten und aufgeblasenen Worten den sumpfigen Abgrund verlorener Seelen- und Geistesgesundheit."'6 The intellectual has proved his bankruptcy in Werfel's mind. He has been characterized by Werfel as a man of overweening pride who is certain that God did not place him on life's stage, but invited him to sit in a royal box. Realization that he is a dispassionate observer rather than a participant induces an intoxication of su- periority. He regards life "von der unermellichen und eisigen HShe des absoluten Geistes herab, der das menschliche Leben nur mit dem spielerischen Lichtstrahl der Ironie beriihrt."7 True art, on the other hand, can re-awaken pristine spiritual powers that have been lulled into lethargy by modern civilization. One is reminded of Werfel's British contemporary, Charles Morgan. Although he lacks the deeply religious content found in Werfel, Morgan's view is that art fluidifies the stream of imagination which has stagnated and congealed in modern civilization. Werfel discloses that he conceived his view of the relationship between art and religiousness in Egypt when he beheld the valley of the kings, the lonely burial places of the pharaohs, and the bas- reliefs. He thought of the frantic modern search for "Zeitvertreib" with its connotation of superficial amusements and emptiness of soul. Egyptian art struck him, in contrast, as "Zeit-Verhaftung" and "Tod-Vertreib." The Egyptian plastic arts focused their attention on the idea of death, thereby destroying it. Music is, for Werfel, a source for similar effect. He describes its effect on the listener: Ihr ganzes Wesen spannt und dehnt sich, Ihr Selbstgefiihl wlichst, sodaf3 das niedrige Ich mit seinen kleinen Nebengedanken vllig darin verschwindet, das Todesbewu3tsein tritt ins Nichts zuriick, die trostreiche GewiBheit, nicht vergehen zu kinnen, durchleuchtet einen seitlosen Blitz lang Ihr ganzes Wesen .... Sie wohnen der Gottheit nither. Die Erinnerung an den archaischen Zustand der Gliickseligkeit hat Sie beriihrt.8 In the unpublished Theologumena, most of which are written in the form of aphorisms, he concedes to literature, to the word, its place: "Warum ist das Wort Gottes (der Sohn) mehr als die Werke Gottes (die Gesch6ipfe)? Well von allem Wirken und Tun SFranz Werfel, K6nnen Wir ohne Gottesglauben Leber? (Berlin, 1932), p. 34.

Franz Werfel renounces much that is new in modern art and literature, referring to modernistic experiments as Pyrrhic victories of art, but to more traditional art, particularly that which is re- ligiously and spiritually inspired, he assigns the highest place. It can rouse from a long slumber our ability to recognize the sig- nificance of things. While an animal is to us merely a biological phenomenon, man at the dawn of historical time recognized with his unexhausted spiritual powers in that animal a facet of the divine which was reflected only in that particular animal. "Die Tiere w a r e n nicht nur, sondern sie b e d e u t e t e n auch tiber ihr Sein hinaus .. . Fiir uns sind die Dinge nur, aber sie bed euten nichts."9 (Cf. Rilke: "Die Dinge singen h~r ich so gern./ Ihr riihrt sie an: sie sind starr und stumm./ Ihr bringt mir alle die Dinge umrn.) Art can serve as a catalytic agent in helping mankind achieve a spiritual re-awakening and rejuvenation but the ultimate meta- morphosis must come from man himself. Inasmuch as all paths ex- cept for "der Weg nach oben" are blocked, Franz Werfel is able to formulate his conclusion in one simple unequivocal sentence: "Diese Welt, die sich zivilisiert nennt, kann seelisch nur geheilt werden, wenn sie den Weg zu einem echten Christentum wieder- findet."lo Genuine Christianity, once achieved, is capable of abrogating such traits as the lust for power, the wish to rule over others and to mirror oneself in their abasement, posing as great before them. These traits are not inborn, for, as Werfel points out, the child in its earliest years lives in peaceful mutual relations with the world about it. The soul suffers irreparable harm and exhibits that morbid fever which is the will to power, ambition, the thirst for triumph, and the hatred of one's fellow men only after it has learned of op- pression and egoistic obstinacy from his elders. Genuine Chris- tianity, on the other hand, can provide the soil in which the "good man" can grow. And this soil is not to be circumscribed within the family, the tribe, the nation, or even all humanity. Man ist kein guter Mensch, wenn man nur ein guter Franzoser oder Deutscher 9 Ibid., p. 28. ~ Franz Werfel, Kdnnen Wir ohne Gottesglauben Lebent (Berlin, 1932), p. 54.</page><page sequence="10">272 THE GERMAN QUARTERLY ist.

We have not attempted to discuss the validity of Franz Werfel's ideas. Rather it has been our purpose to reveal those aspects of his thought which form the very core of his work and which have been brought into sharper focus during his exile. The thought-content expressed in his recent works represents the culmination of a life- long pre-occupation. Born as the son of the liberal European bourgeoisie in a fin de siicle atmosphere, he reflects the characteris- tics of that world to the present day. More and more, however, he has divorced himself from that heritage of materialistic realism with its diluted base of rationalism. He was carried, it is true, by anti-rational waves which assumed tremendous proportions in vary- ing dress particularly in Spenglerian thought. The religious form assumed by his antirational convictions, however, is evident from his earliest work to his latest. University of Southern California 1 Ibid., p. 66.</page></plain_text>
