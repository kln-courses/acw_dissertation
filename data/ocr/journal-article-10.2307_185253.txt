Z EXPERIENCE AND EXPERIMENT* THOMAS A COWAN Rutgers University School of Law The problem of scientific ethics or experimental morality creates for the scientific methodologist a profound dilemma. To the extent that he makes his investigations scientific he fails at the essence of morality. Conversely, if he attempts to found himself securely in morality, his efforts to become scientific lead to mere utilitarian "moralizing." In the older language of Kant, the imperatives of morality are categorical; those of science, hypothetical. "Is" and "ought" are incommensurable categories, as they are for logical positivism which simply accepts the dualism as irreducible and advises against what it views as the inevitable consequence of any attempted synthesis: confusion. That moral sentiments exist and can be investigated like any other existents is admitted by logical positivists. But they insist that the result of scientific investigation on a moral problem of existents is no more than a body of information on existential phenomena. It has nothing to say of the rightness or wrongness of competing moral prescriptions. Take for example a scientific investigation into existing moral attitudes toward a given ensemble of legal rules. It may be established that community opinion overwhelmingly condemns the legal rules in question on moral grounds. Is this investigation an instance of what has been called scientific ethics? No, say the dualists. It is not ethics at all. Because the legal rules may nevertheless be morally right though the vast majority of the community disagree. In other words, quantitative agreement even approaching unanimity is no assurance of moral rectitude. To deny this is to equate morality with opinion, a principle which itself reflects a low order of morality. For it is well-known that moral advances are often the work of lone dissenters, "voices crying in the wilderness," prophets without honor in any country including their own. The methods of science search out the degree of probability with which events fit hypotheses. The higher the degree of probability, the stronger the inferences from the data. But no correlation exists between the rightness of a moral opinion and the unanimity or fervor with which it is held. Or at least so * Received November 1958. 77</page><page sequence="2">78 THOMAS A COWAN it appears to those who despair of scientific investigations in aid of moral judgments. For them, scientific ethics may be science, but it is not ethics. Let us shift the inquiry slightly by speaking not of scientific ethics, but of experimental morality, since what we are after is not primarily a method but an aim. We seek the meaning and the aim of experimental morality. We hope never to depart from morality as we ask what it means to say of a morality that it is experimental. We shall not jeopardize our inquiry at the outset by requiring that the "experimental" be also scientific, although if it should turn out that our notion of "experimental" is in accord with the deepest meaning of science, that result would help to realize one of our fondest hopes. Nietzsche sensed that the modern age is within a hair's breadth of a con- scious recognition that what it is doing with morality is experimenting. With the frantic zeal of a prophet whose time on earth is short, he exhorted humanity to leap the final hurdle, to take its morality into the clear light of day and examine it with the aim of remaking it. "The earthquake reveals new springs. In the earthquake of old peoples new springs well forth. "And whoever proclaims, 'Look! Here is a well for many who are thirsty, a heart for many who are longing, a will for many instruments' a people (that is to say: many experimenters) shall gather around such a man. "Who can command? Who must obey? That is the experiment made here. Alas, amidst long seeking and guessing, some bad guessing, and learning and continued exper- imenting! "Human society-is an experiment, I teach; a long search that seeks to find out who can command! "An experiment oh my brothers! Not a 'contract' Break it up, break up that word of soft-hearts, half-hearted hearts"' [Thus spoke Zarathustra, Gateway Edition, trans- lation of Marianne Cowan, p. 251.] Values must be transvalued, mankind must transcend itself. The last message of the nineteenth century is that man must consciously make his morality (Nietzsche), his history (Marx), and his religion (Jung). The colossal power which man now possesses to manipulate his physical environment has placed the race in serious danger of perishing. It calls for man's conscious realization of the kind of animal he is and the ends he destines for human life. This is the message our prophets are bringing to us. What shall we do? The answer cannot be "more power over physical nature." This merely increases our danger. Nor can we halt the progress of natural science even if we would. We must correct the imbalance even while the forces that created it continue to grow. Modern science has destroyed man's historic relationship with nature. Freud tells us that the two most serious blows that modern man has suffered come from the realization that his beloved planet Earth is a mere insignificant speck in an infinitely great universe and that the genus homo is but one of a vast multitude of living species all related. Copernicus and Darwin left man groveling in the dust. Jung says that man's conscious choice to control his external environment has relatively so weakened his spiritual nature as to</page><page sequence="3">EXPERIENCE AND EXPERIMENT 79 leave it subject to violent attacks from the collective unconscious. The answer in the case of both of these physicians is not to debase or destroy science but to strengthen conscious knowledge of the human psyche. Jung regards with horror the one-sidedness of the growth of what is known as experimental psychology. To turn the objective, impersonal, quantitative processes of physical science on the inner life of man without supplying him with the increased moral stamina necessary to stand such an invasion is bound to exacerbate his present state of tension and increase perilously the imbalance in his relations with his external environment. Scientific ethics and scientific religion would be still worse. But since the pursuit of scientific knowledge is a most powerful instinctual drive with modern man and since it is impossible as well as undesirable to keep the operation of this instinct out of man's deepest concerns (his psyche, his morality and his religion), we must strive for some way to make the pursuit of scientific knowledge compatible with manys inner needs for subjective wholeness, for morality, and for religion. As man has remade his outer environment so must he remake his inner environment. Experimental science is re-creating the world. Experimental morality and experimental religion must re-create man. Not to weaken science nor to wait until the dark forces of the unconscious destroy it in the interests of a low level stability, but to strengthen morality and religion so that they can live with a science grown immeasurably strong is the right prescription. I think the way to clarity now lies in an examination of the meaning of "experiment." Little aid to our enterprise lies in trying to make more precise the meaning of experiment as this process is associated with experimental science. Of course, a deep enough investigation into the meaning of exper- imental science would, I think, show that science cannot progress indefinitely unless morality, art and religion keep step with it. But that way is not very promising at present. Let us shake loose the idea of experiment from its association with science for the moment. Perhaps we shall come upon some meaning of experiment that will help us with a more fruitful notion of exper- imental science. All life is an experiment, we may say. And hope that the sentiment is not too fatuous for serious consideration. All life is an experiment, the biologist might say, meaning that the countless forms of contemporary living creatures show evidence of infinite change over countless eons in the course of trial and error progress to their present forms. And the process is in full blast today. Apparently there have been many kinds of "humans" in the past. There may be many more in the future. At another end of the scale, the viruses are changing radically to keep ahead of our wonder-drugs. The process shows a marvelous adaptation of means to ends. How much of it is conscious? Only a tiny bit, we like to think. We are accustomed to deny consciousness to all nonhuman forms. With what warrant, I am at a loss to say. Do we also deny the existence of all nonhuman moralities? I think we do, but should we? We might be willing to admit that bees (or perhaps termites) experiment. They show a marvelous adaptability in sex determination and in foodgathering.</page><page sequence="4">80 THOMAS A COWAN We should not like to call them conscious. Are they then unconscious, for they do exhibit mind, surely. And moralities have no need to be conscious. (Man was always moral though only relatively recently conscious.) Are bees then experimental moralists? No one knows why they kill drones when and as they do. The reasons given by some of the experts sound like anthropomorphic moralizing to me: a low level morality, such as universalistic hedonism or totalitarian ethics, is often attributed to them. External environment has much to do with their conduct to be sure, but not enough to satisfy much present- day scientific opinion. I really think I am going to have to take back the word experiment from the physical or natural scientists. I am not the first to do so of course. For one, a former teacher of mine, Henry Bradford Smith, did so in a daring postulate for a modern all-round scientific metholodogy. "There is nothing," he said, to be found in the meaning of experience that is not already contained in the meaning of experiment.'* (Italics supplied.) Thirty years after the formulation of this ultimate article of the experimentalist's creed, I am coming face to face with its radical implications. Years ago, I thought it was no more than a methodologist's rule of procedure for the intransigently scientific. It seemed then to say that experience must be formulated in terms of experimental science before it can be regarded as knowledge. This was a method of procedure. More than that, it also seemed to assure the scientific investigator that no doors should be closed to him. Wherever he comes upon experience, he may make scientific knowledge of it. There are no sacred enclaves from which he is ruled off: not mind, not spirit, not morality nor art nor religion. The principle seemed to say that all expe- rience is of such a form that it can be made scientific; that the very meaning of experience presupposes the meaning of experiment. Today I think of the principle as meaning much more. To be sure, it does mean that there is no experience which cannot be made experiment. But if that is all Smith meant, he could have said so. He could have said, "There is no experience that cannot be subjected to the method of scientific experi- mentation." But he did not. He said that the meaning of experience is con- tained in the meaning of experiment before the experience comes into existence. And experience comes into existence as experiment. This makes experiment prior to experience in very meaning. As a category of knowledge, experiment is broader, more fundamental, more nearly pristine than experience. Experi- ment is a priori to experience. Experiment may exist without experience (Smith did not specifically say this); but experience cannot exist without experiment. It is this broadened conception of experiment that I should like to examine a bit further. What can it mean to say that experience presupposes experiment (but not vice versa)? That experiment may exist even in the absence of expe- rience? Suppose I say that staphylococci experimented so rapidly with new strains that it is now closing some of the very hospitals which were the * Postulates of Empirical Thought, 25 Journal of Philosophy (1928) 318.</page><page sequence="5">EXPERIENCE AND EXPERIMENT 81 foremost users of wonder antibiotics? I could say that the germs experimented, could I not, even though I should hesitate to say they "experienced"? By this I mean that a methodologist might more easily set out the formal conditions under which staphylococci "experimented" to mutate out of the influence of the antibiotics (as mosquitoes did of DDT) than it would be to state the formal conditions under which these creatures could be said to have "experi- enced". I may mean by this, may I not, that the order of intelligence necessary to conduct an experiment is lower, broader, nearer the fundament of life than that required in having an experience? And that this is as true of a man as of a virus or an insect? That man's process of experimenting too is more nearly fundamental, more primitive, more deeply in accord with basic biolo- gical nature in general than his process of experiencing? That while his experiencing tends to become refined into science his experimenting still runs the whole gamut of biological behavior? In brief, I think I could call the process of gene mutation experimental but would hesitate to call it an experiencing. In the light of these considerations, I should hardly be doing violence to language to say that man is experimenting, has always experimented, with his mind, his body and all its works as well as with his world. I should be able to say specifically that man has always experimented with his morality, his law, and his religion. And that only one part of his vast experimentation has had to do with his environment. If now I call man's experimenting with his environment "experimental science", I shall perhaps be permitted to observe that the fundamental aspect of this term lies in experiment and not in science. And that one important substrate which underlies both science and morality is experiment. So far I have been using the popular rather that the technical meaning of the term "experiment". I have done this because the technical meaning of experiment is far too circumscribed. Among present-day scientists experiment entails a formal model embodying advanced factual intuitions clarified by the methods of logic and serving in some sense as a domain of meaningfulness into which observations are introduced according to rules of procedure so that inferences may be drawn with quantitative values for the hypotheses and with qualitative value for further lines of inquiry. The process aims to put increasingly clarified questions of a quantitative character to nature in order that clearer and clearer quantitative inferences may be drawn respecting the nature of nature. This is the experimental method of pragmatism broadened (at least potentially) to include data from the whole realm of experience. It is a marvelous tool for the job it is designed to do but its high order of specializa- tion makes it unavailable for work not falling within the rather rigid specifica- tion of scientific method. Experimental science as now constituted can handle only quantitative, generalized questions of fact or existence, preferably those that are susceptible of being processed in accordance with the simple Boolian algebra of electronic computers. But morality deals with unique, or at least individual, qualitative</page><page sequence="6">82 THOMAS A COWAN questions of obligation or "essence" and its generalizations are different in kind from those of any existing species of modern logic, to say nothing of the simple combinatorial processes of the computers. Is it possible to select out of the broadened "popular" conception of experiment, factors that are common to experimental science and experimental morality? We are by no means wholly at a loss in this undertaking. For law is surely one of humanity's great experiments, and law is a combination of (minimal) morality and (outmoded) science, of rule of law and question of fact, we should say. The writer has devoted much more effort to showing how law may and should bring its old-fashioned methods for determining the truth of legal facts up-to-date than he has in examining the standards of legal morality. The second is incomparably more difficult than the first, but its importance is equally overwhelmingly great. If moralists were to direct their attention to the grand (unconscious) plan which humanity follows in experimenting with morality, then the vast experiment which is law could be directed by both a highly perfected experimental science and an equally highly conscious experi- mental morality in the task of guiding its own fate. Lacking an experimental morality upon which to draw, law instinctively and rightly rejects the lethal aid of modern science. And law is not the only cripple suffering from this lop-sided development of the human soul. Am I mistaken in thinking that I hear among the many voices issuing from the well-springs of morality, one that asks that morality be made consciously experimental? That it too be made a "science"? Nietzsche called simply for "a gay science." Not what seemed to him the rather ascetic, rationalistic, utilitarian ideal of modern science with its "clearly right" methods of proce- dure. What has happened to the marvelous nineteenth century ideal of the exact scientist dedicated to the disinterested pursuit of truth? It suffers, we may suppose, from the common fate of all things that succeed. It is doomed to be transcended. The modern scientist knows what the good is for him and he follows it undeviatingly. His "truth" is the opposite of his "error." He will have nothing to do with the suggestion that perhaps his truth may be bad and his error good. He is willing to experiment but not with his virtues or vices. How then can his method yield experimental moral results? How can he ever, by using precision tools designed only to divide truth from falsity, lead himself to transcend good and evil, any good and evil, and particularly the goods and evils of the present day? As a man, he needs moral experiment like the rest of us but as a scientist he cannot afford to let it influence his findings. He feels that he need not and at present he cannot take account of the unique moral character of the objects he investigates. So much is this so that as a result he is ruled off the domain of human morality. He may not experiment with human beings. Thus, by his method he is doomed to the study of nonmoral nature and gives up, with infinite regret we may suppose, the proper study of mankind. I sense that these things are bringing the modern scientist to a crisis: either</page><page sequence="7">EXPERIENCE AND EXPERIMENT 83 his methodology must expand to include moral experiment or else he must surrender scientific autonomy and accept the role of technical subordinate to men of affairs, the present economic and political masters of the race. These leaders have joyfully accepted the task of conforming scientific effort to the aims of finance, commerce and war. To the extent that the scientist submits to such direction, he too finds that his work is judged by the competitive ideals of economic culture. The scientific ideal of the pursuit of truth wherever it may lead yields to the overpowering ideal of gain. It is perceived that even the purest of pure research has its ultimate practical application, and it is not surprising that the economic masters of the modern corpus of scientific activity strive to draw out more and more immediately practical applications at the expense of "disinterested" research. For them, budgets dedicated to long range results are simply long term investments. It is to be expected that they will constatly attempt to minimize their carrying charges by speed-up and by liquidating unpromising lines of research. In all this, they are undoubtedly engaged in a gigantic unconscious moral experiment. The vice in such proce- dure is that the time is past for such experimenting to be kept unconscious. It must be brought up to the level of consciousness and faced as an explicitly undertaken task. For this, not the economic enterpreneur as now constituted is needed. Only the scientist-moralist and the moralist-scientist could under- take this massive job. If, indeed, the unparalleled energy of the modern businessman-warrior could also be enlisted in this enterpirse, then human culture might well take a mighty turn in a new direction. I think I see a way between the horns of the dilemma, a mere inkling of a way, by which our science may share in the terribly exciting experiments by which humanity is remaking its morality. On the one side, without abandoning his proper sphere of interest in the values "truth" and "falsity", the scientist could enlarge his method to include the values of morality, that is, the values "good" and "evil". He could and should study to make his method include the feeling for the unique, which is the moral particular, and for the "web of relatedness" which is moral generality, in order to see how to incorporate them in the modern scientific pursuit of particular facts and universal laws. On the other side, the moralist must cultivate a genuine experimental attitude. He must become aware that for better or for worse he is watching an experiment. Outside and beyond scientific methodology lie immense areas of human experience (the law is only one of them) whose fundamental criterion of differentiation is good-bad or right-wrong, not true-false. A gay, open- eyed willingness to seek out the meaning of experiment in this vast field of experience is the task. It took a man broken in body and in mind to tell us that above all our pursuit of the new morality needs gaiety of spirit. Perhaps I am talking now of more than morality. Perhaps this vision requires nothing less than the religious temper itself. For surely the gay spirit is beyond good and evil, and just as surely this "beyond" is the holy land of the religious life.</page></plain_text>
