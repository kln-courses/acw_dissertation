<plain_text><page sequence="1">Afterword: Adam's house and hermits' huts A conversation MICHAEL W. MEISTER and JOSEPH RYKWERT MWM: Joseph, I'm curious, in reading Coomaraswamy now?an article he wrote in the late twenties or early thirties ? what use would his evidence from India have been to you in writing On Adam's House in ParadiseV JR: It would have been invaluable, because there was no material on the pre-Gupta architecture of India then available to me. Very few things had been written about it, most of them by Coomaraswamy himself. Very thin, and I simply couldn't get at the sources on sacred literature that I needed for Indian material, not being a Sanskrit speaker or reader, so I relied on people who wrote in European languages, and this particular issue?the issue of the primitive hut as a model of permanent architecture?had simply not been treated. It's really rather surprising to me that Coomaraswamy didn't publish his material in his lifetime. MWM: My impression, from reading On Adam's House in Paradise, had been that it was not so much the hut itself but the idea of the primordial hut that was of enormous importance to the development of European architecture and thinking about architecture. Do you think that is parallel to the situation Coomaraswamy describes for India? JR: Yes. The primordial hut is, of course, not any particular hut that anyone ever has discovered because by definition it cannot be discovered. Hence my Proustian tag at the beginning of On Adam's House in Paradise that "all paradises are lost paradises." Inevitably it was the idea of the hut that I was concerned with and, of course, the reconstruction of primitive huts ? particularly reconstructions for ritual purposes, such as the permanent primitive hut of Romulus in Rome or the temporary primitive huts which were erected for festivals such as the Jewish festival of tabernacles and the Roman festival of Anna Perenna. This kind of ritual building of deliberately primitive huts is an extremely important aspect of the religious rites and beliefs of certain peoples, and I suspect that it was something that was very important in India as well. MWM: Coomaraswamy relates the primitive hut?the hut of the hermit or the ascetic?to what he calls the "tabernacle of the flesh" and sees the hermit in his hut, I think, as equivalent to the religious aspirant or to the soul of man, which is released, at the end of his religious life, literally from the top of the skull, and Coomaraswamy relates the dome of the hut to the skull.2 Is there anything parallel to that in the West? JR: Oh, innumerable instances. The obvious one that comes to mind is the Capitolium, "the place of the skull," which was, as it were, the head of Rome. It was called that because a skull was found on the site and from the skull the prophecy was derived about the future greatness of the city of Rome. That's only one of very, very many instances. There's of course the whole history of the way in which we contend with columns, are concerned with the image of the body in columns, and particularly with the identification of capital with head. Again, "Capitolium" in Rome and the "capitendum" of the column are obviously parallels. MWM: Coomaraswamy's article, the one we are publishing for the first time, is very much involved with gritty details of scholarship?with the fragments of references in texts and fragments of representations in reliefs that Coomaraswamy could collect by sifting through vast amounts of material. In another article, however, which he wrote almost eight years later, he deals, not with the construction or structure of the dome, but with its essence, with its meaning.3 This is a remarkable article that never talks about space, never talks about keystones, never talks about arches or any other of the things that we might wish to deal with in reference to construction. He deals only with the symbolism, and yet that symbolism in India he believes is rooted in something so primitive as the hut. From that essential prototypic symbolism comes, in Coomaraswamy's mind, a whole evolution of many varied forms of sacred architecture in India. Does the 1.

JR: Yes, in a sense I think it does, and I think it does so also in other civilizations, for instance, Meso-America. But I think the hut is also important in Indian architecture precisely because constructed stone architecture arrives in Hindu India rather late, which leads one to presuppose (the argument from silence is always very problematic, but one may suppose) that there was a long tradition, which must have been handed down by craft-methods and craft-rituals which accompany craft-methods, and probably also by work songs in which a whole timber structuring of the building process was commemorated. This, inevitably, as in most craft traditions would go back to the original inventor of building who made the hut, as it were, in the image of his own body. Hence the dome-head analogy is of such enormous importance. Let me restate this. In many craft traditions, there is an originator of the craft, whether?as he often is in Christian traditions?the saint, like St. Crispin, the first shoemaker, or whether?as in classical traditions? he's a god and hero. There's always a founder of the craft who, sometimes by accident and at other times through revelation, found the original technique of the craft. That's really what I meant when I said that the songs and the rituals of craft commemorate the first maker who, as it were, made the craft out of his own body. MWM: Joseph, in India the range of early forms of sacred architecture included open-to-air altars, hypaethral structures, and freestanding pillars symbolically connected to cosmogonie origination and cosmological order. To that sacred repertoire, Coomaraswamy wished to add the simple hut, the primitive hut. It seems to me that the thing which distinguishes the hut as a model for sacred architecture from other forms is that it provides shelter; by providing shelter to a hermit, who represents a spiritual potentiality, the hut is humanized in a way that cosmogonie and cosmological sacred monuments of early India were not. Is there any symbolic role for the function of shelter in European architecture that parallels that humanizing aspect of the hut in India? JR: Not directly, but there is an area of ignorance where you have to enlighten me. Are there records of stone or even carved wooden shrines?highly worked shrines, at any rate?in which a ramshackle or a simple hut for a hermit or a holy figure was put on the temple platform? MWM: Probably the most unusual example of a true hut-form used as a temple would be at Mahabalipuram, near Madras, in the seventh century a.D., where you have a range of monolithic shrine-models, made by carving down boulders. One of these is made in the form of a simple thatched hut above a moulded platform standing next to much more elaborated Dravidian shrines. JR: I don't quite mean that. I mean that there should be a shrine on a platform, perhaps with or without a central column, on which a hermit or a holy figure came to live and built himself a hut for the duration of his lifetime, as it were, or for a period, which then disappeared or was taken down or was burnt?which was a temporary structure as against the permanence of the platform itself. MWM: Not that I know of, but also I don't think in ancient India that there is evidence of substantial platforms of that sort being built. Simple altars for ritual practices were built, but such an altar is not extensive enough to then involve a hermit's shelter being built on one. Rituals do exist where the earth itself is taken as the "platform" (bh?mi), with a central pole, and a shelter is built to carry out rites related to cosmogonie creation as part of agricultural re-creation, and there was also a tradition of large terraced structures, on the tops of which siupas or temple-shelters were built (it would, of course, be interesting to know if these ever were impermanent structures). What one does sometimes find are sites where a particular hermit had made his home and which may have had a temple built on them or nearby after the hermit's death. A remarkable example would be the M?l?dev? temple at Gyaraspur in Central India, where there is a cliff and a rock ledge under which a famous hermit seems to have made his shelter. This ledge now juts into the body of the present temple, forming a natural roof for its sanctum.4 To build the temple in this location, in fact, architects had to build an enormous artificial platform up the side of the hill in order to support the structure. Let's go back to the symbolic value of shelter. The primitive hut in Europe, the idea of which you trace in On Adam's House in Paradise, is a model for the primordial act of making architecture. To me it had seemed the moment when primitive man provided shelter for the first time, by even pulling branches from 4. Michael W. Meister, "Jain Temples in Central India," in Aspects of Jaina Art and Architecture, edited by U. P. Shah and M. A. Dhaky, Ahmedabad, 1976, pp. 223-241.</page><page sequence="3">Meister and Rykwert: Adam's House and Hermits' Huts 29 a tree to give himself protection from the rain, but was that function of shelter in any way itself conceived as a moment of transformation toward civilized man? JR: The question you ask is really about the nature of human shelter as against animal shelter, because in fact the building of shelters is an instinctive activity of a great many species ? fishes and birds and mammals (such as beavers). The great apes, of course, build shelters, and indeed it's their way of socializing space. Some mammals, like dogs and cats, socialize space by using their pee to mark boundaries; others need to construct shelters. Gorillas, particularly, are builders of quite elaborate nests. But none of these animals that we know of?and indeed I wouldn't think it conceivable ? think or feel their nests metaphorically; man is the quintessential^ metaphoric animal, and making metaphors is a human activity. I insistently go on saying "there is no architecture without architects"; the architect is the person who thinks before he builds and anyone who does that in my vocabulary is an architect. Therefore, I would say that a hut only happens when the man who bends the bow and twines the elastic branches around thick bits sees in that activity and in that shape something that has not made itself but refers to other things. MWM: I think certainly Coomaraswamy would have agreed with you. I think the hut he speaks of is important to him for two reasons. One is that the hut with its potent ascetic within it?or with an object of sacred power such as in some of the early Buddhist caves where the st?pa itself is encased within the form of a hermit's hut?acts as a metaphor for spiritual potentiality, for the possibility of the aspirant to ascend from this world toward a different level of realization.5 To demonstrate that a simple thatch hut could have such a metaphoric role in India is one of the purposes of his article. The other role that I think he emphasizes for the hut is its form-giving character?that, on the basis of a primitive hut, much more elaborated hutlike structures could be developed for an architecture meant to shelter, not simply the hermit, but images of divine reality in human form for worship. Shelters for those images take on ever elaborating architectural forms, which he still sees as ultimately derived from elements of the hut?elements such as dome, cornice, and clerestory taken from early village and urban architecture in India. I think the question would then be whether, in European architecture, the idea of the primitive hut also has a form-giving role or only an intellectual role in the evolution of architecture and thinking about architecture. JR: Well, clearly the idea of columns around a perimeter and of a pitched roof over the columns in Greek architecture referred to an earlier construction. In fact, the problems of Greek builders were partly due to the fact that the kind of architecture that they were producing in stone commemorated two separate kinds of building, one kind with flat roofs and the other kind with pitched roofs, which were not altogether matched but which were the archaic forms to which Greek architecture referred and which Greek architects wanted to see commemorated through their buildings. So in fact it's very much not only a form-giving precedent but a problem-setting precedent?a formal problem-setting precedent. MWM: Coomaraswamy, in his article, actually spends much time exploring the fragments of evidence he can get from reliefs and texts. He tries to put that evidence together to show a formal evolution leading to later Hindu temples. The details of that evolution are not fully worked out in his article, perhaps not fully worked out in his lifetime.6 The most difficult formal leap I think he has to make is from the primitive hut itself to a domed structure with gables, used to shelter images, that is of much greater complexity than the thatched hut itself. It's possible that what he did not fully recognize is the fact that the hut provided primarily a metaphoric or paradigmatic value for otherwise palatial structures, with domes, that took their additional meaning from the fact of their sheltering manifesting forms of divinity. The palace as well as the hut (as Coomaraswamy did recognize) contributed to the development of forms for the later Hindu temple.7 Is there a similar duality in the way in which the hut contributes to European architecture? JR: Not exactly the same way, but there are, of course, parallels. In antiquity there were a number of primitive huts that were either maintained and reconditioned to look primitive but new, such as the Ariopagus in Athens or the two huts in Rome, both of which were 5. "Svayam?trnn?: Janua Coeli," in Lipsey, ed., 465-520; for a st?pa encased in a hut (even having a wicker-screen window) see the cave at Kondivte, Maharashtra, ca. first century b.c., illustrated in Susan L.

And there were others where the hut was actually enclosed in a marble structure, or at least a stone one. That's one aspect of it?the hut as a relic ? but the other aspect of this problem is the hut as a formal model or, if you like, as a legitimation. As construction becomes more elaborate and materials more precious and more permanent, so the recall of the first building with its virtue of being a primary answer to necessity is a prime legitimation. Therefore you will find palaces in which that kind of reference is made to the house of the first founder or to the ancestors of the family. You will find it in coronation ceremonies, even the absurdities to which Napoleon went to recall the coronation of Charlemagne. The decadent form was the mania for the lactic hut in the palace like the famous dairy of Marie Antoinette where the primitive hut becomes a toy. MWM: Coomaraswamy points out that the hut of the solitary ascetic collectively becomes the form for the monastery, that the monastery is a collection of individual ascetics in their separate cells which then, arranged around a courtyard, becomes the model for the Indian monastery. Is there a similar linkage in the thinking of Europe? JR: Certainly not in the European monastery, which starts, of course, as an assemblage of hermits in Thebide in Egypt, but by the time it becomes an architectural form it is already cenobitic, it already has a rule, and the first monasteries that we know, with the exception of orders like the Carthusians, are already formal buildings. The Carthusian monasteries were, of course, collections of huts and the whole of the Carthusian ethos is about each monk and his cell being, as it were, a unit of prayer and work that only needed a limited contact with other monks in public worship and occasional recreation, but otherwise, basically, each monk was involved with what he was doing within himself. They are not, however, the common form of monastery. MWM: Are there other traditions which glorify the hut, the primitive hut, or hut-forms into real architecture in more permanent forms? JR: Well, in Meso-America I guess the obvious example would be those curious Mayan oval huts that are reproduced in sculpture much as they were in India. The nunnery at Uxmal has a hut over the door of each chamber and in that sense it clearly was intended to represent a series of huts. The huts over the doors are almost keystones; they're hieroglyphs meaning "chamber equals hut, door equals hut." There are a number of rituals involving building primitive huts all over the world. The Japanese commemoration ceremonies are one instance. There are certain specific rituals in the Western world (as in the Jewish and Roman festivals already mentioned), where fields of huts were built outside the town and a certain amount of eating and drinking?particularly drinking?had to go on in them. The Jewish regulations about the hut required that you be able to see the sky through the branches on the roof so that, although the roof should be more or less waterproof, it should still be permeable. That guarantees its character as a hut. MWM: The huts that Coomaraswamy describes are sealed at the top but the symbolism of the dome he analyzes in his later work involves the idea of the top of the dome being permeable; its crowning circular plate is likened to the cranial hole through which the spirit escapes (or like the smoke-hole in a Central Asian yurt),8 and the spirit of the dying man or the spirit of the aspirant in a religious ceremony is likened to the smoke which rises through that hole and forms a pillar parallel to the central axis of a cosmogonie monument. How much of that sort of thinking about the relationship between the individual, the architecture in which he carries out ritual, and cosmic order do you find in different periods in the West? JR: The idea of the smoke escaping from a smoke-hole in the roof, which may be vertically above the fire or which may be at an angle to it (it may be in the gable-ends of the hut) ? the idea of that as a kind of revelation is fairly pervasive. You get it in Rome, you get it in Greek architecture (particularly early Greek architecture). It seems to me echoed, though not expressly stated, by the Greek custom of making the statues of the gods so big that they practically touch the roof. In fact, in our terms, the formal relationship between the statue of a god and the temple was very uncomfortable because the god was always so big that he practically went through the roof, so that in that sense the statue's head was identified with, was in the roof, and this imagery was a very persistent one in European thinking about building?the association between the roof-structure, pediment, and the head of an actual image, or of a metaphoric image that we can draw over the building. MWM: Certainly, in India, in later temple architecture, the size of the temple is directly related to the size of 8. "P?li kannik?: Circular roof-plate," in Lipsey, ed., 459-464.</page><page sequence="5">Meister and Rykwert: Adam's House and Hermits' Huts 31 the image in the sanctum, although the size of both temple and image seems in some instances to have been related to the size of the donor, so that the donor became the source of absolute measure in a structure otherwise developed in terms of proportional relationships.9 JR: In the Greek legend about the origin of the Doric order the presence of an actual standard of measurement taken from the human being is very explicit. The Greeks arrive in Asia Minor remembering the way they built on the mainland ? particularly the temple of the Aga Karaiya, which seems to have been a model building?but not knowing, as Vitruvius says, the rules according to which such a building had been built. They therefore invited a young man of particular beauty (although again this is implied rather than stated) to make an imprint of his foot, and they measured his foot against the body of the five basic styles and therefore based the Doric order on the foot-to-height proportion. It seems to me that, as in all these relations, we are dealing with the memory of a rite, and I have no doubt that at some point actual city founders, donors, or some sort of model figures produced the standard measurement. In fact, when Vitruvius talks about how to set out a temple, he starts off with the whole measurement of the site and then the site is divided up into modules, so you don't start by setting out your module, you start with the full measure, and that full measure is presumably either paced out or walked out or in some way set down. It would not, presumably, just have been by the use of string. What you have surviving of Maurya-period architecture in India (ca. third century b.c.) ? and these caves are almost the first examples of Indian architecture after the Indus-Valley period ? are faceted caves, some of which contain the stone "image" of a hut. One of these, on its fa?ade [the Lomas Rsi cave in the Barabar hills of Bihar] ?and this I find particularly striking?represents an extremely elaborate architecture, in timber and presumably other materials (terra cotta perhaps), which bears witness to a very specialized building industry. This fa?ade presents a kind of building with a fully identifiable image, very deliberately shown, with structural members very clearly delineated, so that there is no possible doubt about what is being represented. And yet we have no records of this sort of timber architecture ? inevitably, because timber doesn't last that long?nor do we have accurate records of how these buildings were put together, so in fact the stone images are the records. MWM: Coomaraswamy, in his article, demonstrates a methodology that combines close attention to terminology and texts and equally to the kinds of stone representations and replicas that survive ? a close attention to visual evidence as a major source for the analysis of architecture. However, such representations are not the original architecture. They are already transformed. To what degree does that transformation limit their utility as evidence? JR: Well, if you have no other evidence! . . . Such representations are limited, of course, but you have no counter evidence, certainly, and without them you have no argument at all. You could not have that kind of sculpted representation without there being the kind of architecture that is represented. The carving of cave faces with a hypothetical or fictitious architecture is unthinkable, nor could you have that kind of carving without a highly developed building industry already in existence. Whatever the limitations, therefore, I think, that such carvings are as powerful evidence as there is of anything in history. MWM: There are two kinds of representations. The one is of the primitive hut in a context defined by the narrative surrounding it. That representation, I think, to Coomaraswamy provides a model for the meaning of the hut in the Indian tradition. It's a pattern of the hut with the ascetic in the forest that is repeated in one context after another. The other kind of evidence is the kind which one finds, in early Buddhist caves in particular, where wooden architecture is replicated in stone. That replication of wooden forms provides us with a major source for our knowledge of what the elaborated wood architecture of early India would have been like. There also are reliefs of cityscapes which give a sense of what the clustering of urban architecture would have been like. However, in the cave tradition, one sees this replication of wood architecture become a new language of stone architecture, where the plastic quality of the replica allows for abbreviation, condensation, scale changes, and substitution that creates a decorative reality to the stone fa?ade that would not have been there in wood. In the history of stone carving and its references to wood architecture in the West, is there a similar sort of transformation of architectural language? JR: Well, the carving of caves in India is, of course, in no sense a primitive architecture. It's a highly 9. Michael W. Meister, "Measurement and Proportion in Hindu Temple Architecture," Interdisciplinary Science Reviews 10 (1985): 248-258.</page><page sequence="6">32 RES 15 SPRING 88 developed architecture, a very sophisticated and complex architecture, so in a way it's irrelevant to the "representation" of the primitive hut. Of course the caves do contain hut representations and in a sense the st?pa is also a kind of hut representation, or perhaps an extrapolation from the idea of a kourgan (a hillock with a hut inside it), so the two things are, however remotely, related in one way or another. Now, in Europe, the return to the hut is never quite as powerful as it's been in India. The appeal of the hut turns up in Europe, in theory, over and over again, but in representations it's not very frequent. It's not until the eighteenth century that it becomes an absolutely crucial legitimation point for the theory of architecture and therefore the image then becomes repeated very, very frequently. Many years ago, the Belgian archaeologist Carl Hentse wrote a book called The Hut as the World-Place of the Soul, and in it he traced the use of the primitive hut as a burial form, particularly in southeast Asia and China. There are these traditions, and of course we have the transformation of the primitive hut into a bronze urn in China; both the thatch roof and the cross-corners of the logs appear very explicitly. MWM: The type of hut that one finds in India, certainly the kind of hut that Coomaraswamy documents and is fascinated by, is usually a circular structure with a thatched dome, and that domical form seems essential to the kind of symbolic meaning and formal meaning that Coomaraswamy ascribes to this tradition. Does the hut in the European tradition need to be in any particular form? JR: The primitive huts of the Italians ? the Roman primitive hut?was certainly circular, but it does look as if the huts used as a frequent form of burial both in Italy and in Northern Europe were square as well as circular. It has been supposed that some are for female and some for male burials, but there is absolutely no evidence for making such an identification, at the moment. MWM: In the eighteenth century, when the idea of the primitive hut becomes so significant, does that refer back to a particular form of hut or only to the idea of a primitive shelter? JR: No, it refers back precisely to the primitive hut. All the images make it look as close as possible to a Greek temple so that the whole burden of constant reference to it makes it plain that columns supporting a pitched roof with a cross beam ? which looks like columns supporting a pediment?are the origins of all architecture. This hut provides something quite different from the image that Coomaraswamy is looking for in Indian huts. It provides a surrogate "nature," in that it provides man's direct answer to need (i.e., the need which is satisfied by instinct to produce the first artifact). It is by the direct passage from need to satisfaction, through a kind of Lockian comparison of bad experiences with different forms of shelter, that you get the image constructed. The image is the direct result of this process and therefore has the legitimacy of a quasi-natural object that re-bases, as it were, architecture on nature. MWM: Coomaraswamy subtitles his article "Huts and Related Temple Types" and first sets up an analysis of the range of primitive huts available and then sees that form transformed into temples which seem in no way like a primitive hut?temples which are described, in fact, as palaces and are taken by worshipers to be the palaces of the divinities that they are worshiping within them. What I think Coomaraswamy implies is that the significance of that primitive hut, that primordial hut, for the religious meaning of the temple is incorporated into later structures sometimes simply through the persistence of the dome, but also in other ways that do not require the kind of referencing to its original primitive form that you describe in the West. JR: Would this significance be familiar to all worshipers or only to the craftsman and to those who speculated on this kind of issue? MWM: I think Coomaraswamy would be implying that there was a kind of homologous relationship between the simple form of the hut with its sacred center?the ascetic ? and the palace of the divinity with its anthropomorphic image, and that that homologous relationship would be sensed by anyone brought up in the Indian tradition. I don't think he would imply that the average worshiper or the average craftsman would have been able to articulate that relationship. JR: I think the problem is that in Europe this kind of figure of the holy man did not quite exist in the way in which he exists in India. The ascetic holy man is a relatively rare figure in Greek mythology and even the seer as a holy man, like Tiresias, is not thought of as particularly ascetic and certainly not as an isolated figure. He's very much a figure who gets himself involved in human affairs, as his part in the Oedipus 10. Carl Hentze, Das Haus als Weltort der Seele, Stuttgart, 1961.</page><page sequence="7">Meister and Rykwert: Adam's House and Hermits' Huts 33 story makes quite clear. So they do not exist in Greek and Roman lore. They exist certainly in Syria amongst the Jews, but that's a different story. Now, when it comes to Christian building, the relationship between the church and the catacombs was such that many of the Latin churches were built on top of or near martyrs tombs; in some way they commemorated or replicated the use of martyrs' tombs as altar-stones or stones for celebrations of holy banquets or liturgies. Seeing the holy table as a human body and ultimately as itself the tomb of the body of Christ maintained the body-image at the center of the building; it did not maintain it in the form of the hut but rather in the form of the tomb. MWM: I think Coomaraswamy's hut or the hut in India would also be a tomb without the enlivening figure of the ascetic within or the divine manifestation within the temple. The shelter would be only a shack without that which is sheltered within it. Does the idea of the primitive hut in the West require the inhabitant, or only the form of the shelter? JR: I think there's no doubt that the inhabitant is not figuratively a terribly important adjunct to the type of hut. MWM: On the other hand, I suppose that the architect is important, that is, that someone has made the hut? that the act of making the primitive hut was an act of architecture. JR: Yes, I think there is never any question of it being a natural product. It's always made by human beings, however elementarily it's decorated. It's always deliberate; its ?mage is always that of a deliberate act. MWM: Well, I think the daub and wattle hut, the thatch hut that Coomaraswamy sees as the most primitive stage of the Indian hut, is clearly man-made. However, in the literature he describes, the role of the architect?the act of architecture producing shelter?is not much involved in the symbolism. In terms of the way the architectural tradition in Europe chose to look back to the primitive hut, what role does the primitive architect play? Is the significance the fact that he is a model for later architects or is his significance that he represents the original act of making architecture? JR: I think it's very much the second. MWM: Joseph, one last question about methodology, perhaps. Since you are an architect and have worked a great deal with historical documents and texts, and Coomaraswamy, though not an architect, was concerned with both the visual and textual evidence available to him, let me ask whether as an historian you would give priority to one source or another, preference to one source or another, or be able to distinguish the individual virtues of the two kinds of sources available? JR: I think one of the historian's main duties is to weigh the evidence and to decide where the evidence is more or less reliable, where it is of a higher or lower quality. I think there are no absolute rules in this particular game. I think part of Coomaraswamy's genius was in being able to put his finger on the telling evidence. As between visual and verbal evidence, it's when you can mesh the two together that you've got an interesting proposition. MWM: Which gives you greater pleasure: responding to the built monument or finding that mysterious document that explains something that had no explanation before? JR: Well, of course, unless I responded to the monument I wouldn't be looking for the document, so I think you are always in a double bind as an historian. It's when the monument begins to mean something special to you that you begin to link the monument to texts and begin to look for the textual evidence to tell you why you are having this experience ? or perhaps not. Perhaps only experience will remain mysterious.</page></plain_text>
