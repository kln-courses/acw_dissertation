<plain_text><page sequence="1">Starka?r's Teeth William Layher, Washington University Starka?r inn gamli, "Starkad the Old," is renowned as one of the most valiant and perplexing heroes in the Norse tradition. The bulk of his tragic story is recounted in books six through eight of the Gesta Danorum (early thirteenth century) and in Gautreks saga, a fornaldarsaga ("saga of ancient times") that dates from the latter part of the thirteenth century. Additional perspectives about Starka?r's origins, his deeds, and his downfall are pro vided in Norna-Gests p?ttr, the S?gubrot affornkonungum, the U redaction of Hervararsaga ok Heidreks konungs, and in a tenth-century skaldic stanza that is recorded only in Snorra Edda.1 Taken as a whole, however, the sources do not provide a unified portrait of the hero. Rather, the composite is much akin to a Cubist painting, for each source refracts different angles and perspectives of what was obviously a contradictory?even fractured? heroic personality. Starka?r is shown to be a valiant champion but also a coward who flees the battlefield; a loyal retainer to kings like Ingeid, V?karr, and Olo but also a renegade murderer of two of them; a commit ted moralist who is himself plagued by self-loathing; a hero granted three lifespans but cursed to commit a shameful crime in each; a gifted poet who is condemned to forget his verses as soon as he utters them; and, not least of all, he is revealed to be a man whose humanity is repeatedly called into question. On this last point, the sources are in agreement: there was indeed something unnatural and unsettling about Starka?r's embodiment. No where else is this more clearly articulated, perhaps, than in the account of Starka?r's death in book eight of the Gesta Danorum.

He soon finds a willing candidate, and after a brief conversation with Hader?the son of a man whom the hero had killed years earlier?Starcatherus offers him his own sword and bows his head to accept the fatal blow. But when Hader strikes off the head of the most illustrious hero in the Norse tradition, Starcatherus's life force is not immediately extinguished. Rather, Saxo writes that the decapitated head "snapped at the soil with its teeth as it hit the ground, the fury of the dying jaws indicating his savage temper."2 The phrase "to bite the grass" is an ancient locution in heroic epic, which Saxo likely knew through an attestation in the Mneid. Its use in the Gesta Danorum stands as a striking departure from the norm, however. Unlike Homer and Virgil, who use the formula as a florid idiom to mark the death and collapse of a slain hero, Saxo takes the phrase literally. Here he commemorates, for the last and final time, the brute, animalistic ferocity that lurked just underneath Starka?r's skin.3 It is certainly pos sible to see in this enduring image of Starka?r's jaws biting at the grass a grotesque rearticulation of the venerable "last words" topos in the Norse sagas, in which the dying hero utters a brief yet telling phrase that serves as his epigraph.4 It is significant, however, that Starka?r's legacy is set not 2.

Percussor tarnen, promissis fraudem subesse veritus, saltu non incautus abstinuit. Olrik and Raeder, eds., Saxonis Gesta Danorum, I, p. 228. The English translation is from Davidson and Fisher, eds., Saxo Orammaticus: The History of the Danes, Booh I-IX, p. 252. 3. Saxo likely did not know the oldest recorded attribution, from the Miad, but the Homeric and Virgilian examples agree that the phrase is value-neutral: it says nothing about the valor of the slain heroes, instead merely illustrating the degree to which the mighty had fallen?quite literally, down to earth (Miad, 2.418; ?En?d 11.418). Saxo's account of Starka?r's death shows intriguing parallels with the depiction of the death of Starka?r found in stanza 27 of the Ed die poem Helgakvida Hundingsbana II, according to which the hero's body is alleged to have fought on after the head had been cut off: pann s? ec gylfa grimmudgastan, / er bar?iz bohr var ? brot h?fu? saw that hero, most brazen for battle, how the body (lit. 'torso') fought on though the head was gone.' Gustav Neckel and Hans Kuhn, eds., Edda: Die Lieder des Codex Regius nebst verwandten Denkm?lern, 5 ed., Germanische Bibliothek: Reihe 4, Texte (Heidelberg: Carl Winter, 1983), p. 155. Although recent scholarship questions whether the Starcadr konungr (27,1) of the Eddie poem is identical to the popular Old Norse hero, such hesitations are unfounded. Klaus von See et al., eds., Kommentar zu den Liedern der Edda. Band 4: Heldenlieder (Heidelberg: Carl Winter, 2004), pp. 713-16. The grammar and syntax of the attribution in 27, 5-6 (pann . . . gylfa) can only take Starcadr as its antecedent, and the etymology of the exceedingly-rare term gylfi for 'leader' calls forth negative associations to unnaturalness (cf. ON gylfa Ogre, beast') that are characteristic for the way in which Starka?r is represented in Old Norse. In addition, the parallels between the Helgi poem and the Gesta Danorum?of death by decapita tion and disembodied, post-mortem rage?strongly suggests that the Eddie and prose texts are indeed referring to the same figure. The only significant difference between the accounts in Helgakvida Hundingsbana II and in Saxo concerns the part of the body that lives on after death: in the Gesta Danorum, it is not the headless torso, but the head. 4.

The teeth that snap at the grass in fury are an apt memorial for this complicated hero, for indeed, as this essay will show, it is through his teeth that Starka?r lives on in the Norse tradition. At the centerpiece of this study are a number of "sightings" of Starka?r's teeth that were attested in some medieval Danish and Icelandic annals from the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries, and again in Norna-Gests patir, a fourteenth-century Icelandic tale with an overtly historical focus. I argue below that these unusual accounts reveal a great deal about the intersection of heroic embodiment and heroic incarnation in the medieval Norse tradition; and further, that Starka?r's teeth?an uncanny remnant of the vanished body?can offer us remarkable insight into the ways in which Norse audi ences of the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries engaged with the extravagant and wondrous deeds of their heroic past.5 SIGHTINGS The medieval Icelandic L?gmanns-ann?ll notes that in the year 1404 or 1405, the cleric Arne Olafsson and his wife Sigrid Erlendsd?ttir were in Norway. From thence, Arne's travels apparently carried him southward, to the Continent, for the annal states that Arne saw some marvelous relics on display in an unnamed cathedral in northern Europe. Among the relics that Arne saw were the cloak of the Virgin Mary, some items of clothing worn by Jesus and John the Baptist, and two other objects of secular rather than sacred provenance: the hilt of Sigur?r F?fhisbani's sword, and a large molar tooth: Arne Olafs son var f&gt;ar f&gt;a med hustru Sigride Erlendz dottur oc var sett ur penitenciarius ollum noraenum monnum. f&gt;ar sa hann serk vorar fru s?nete Marie, ?c reifa vars herra oc beliti, oc duk Johannes baptistej J^eim stad. er Affrica heitir. sa hann hiallted af sverdi Sigur?ar Fofnes bana ok maelltist honnum f&gt;a .x. fota langt (...) f&gt;ar var oc taunn er sogd var ur Starkadi gamia.

In his commentary on this entry in L?gmanns-ann?ll, Herrmann mis interprets holldinu as 'hilt,' concluding that Starka?r's tooth must have served as the hilt or pommel of Sigur?r's sword. A better reading is holldinu &lt; hold 'flesh,' here meaning 'mouth.'</page><page sequence="4">4 Layher Arne Olafsson was there at the time with his wife Sigrid Erlendsd?ttir, and he was named confessor for all the men in the North. There he saw the cloak of our Lady the Virgin Mary, and the swaddling clothes and belt of our Lord, and the cloak from John the Baptist. In the city called Affrica. He saw the hilt of Sigurd Fafnisbani's sword, which was said to be 10 feet long (. . .). The tooth that was said to come from Starkad the Old was also there. It was three spans long and wide. At one time it used to be in his mouth. The entry in L?gmanns-ann?ll appears to be a straightforward account of Arne's travels, but several of the key details in this text remain enigmatic? among them, the significance of Affrica and the credibility of the entire passage about Starka?r's tooth. Determining where Arne actually was in 1404 or 1405 is not an easy task, for the highly compressed and staccato diction in L?gmanns-ann?ll, especially the annalist's repeated use of the ad verbial par4there' for all spatial references, makes it difficult to reconstruct Arne's whereabouts.7 Nevertheless, Affrica is not what it appears to be; it is, in fact, a garbled reference to Aachen, a major pilgrimage site in the early fifteenth century and the repository, in the St. Mary's Church established by Charlemagne, of exactly the same four holy relics that the L?gmanns-ann?ll attributes to John the Baptist, Jesus, and the Virgin Mary.8 The situation is less clear with the next two objects. While the scribe goes on to mention that Arne saw (sa Hann) the hilt of SiguroVs sword, its location is not revealed; there is no par in this case to indicate that Arne was still in Aachen, and indeed, the context and punctuation of the preceding phrase j peim stad. er Affrica heitir suggests that this attribution applies only to the holy relics just mentioned, not to the objects that fol low. Yet regardless of where the sword hilt and the massive tooth might Paul Herrmann, Die Heldensagen des Saxo Orammaticus.

The confusion extends also to the identity of the man who allegedly saw these relics in Affrica. Herrmann mistakenly identifies him as Vilchin Hinriksson, bishop of Skalh?lt (d. 1405), an error that has perpetuated itself in the scholarship; see Herrmann, Die Heldensagen des Saxo Orammaticus.

Viola Belghaus, Der erz?hlte K?rper: die Inszenierung der Reliquien Karh des Grossen und Elisabeths von Th?ringen (Berlin: Reimer, 2005).

Here, again, the adverb /wrfunctions as a ligature, indicating that the sword hilt and the tooth were in the same location: par var oc taunn 'the tooth was also there'?wherever there happened to be. In this account, the equivalencies are carefully balanced. Not only do the sword and tooth form a coherent set of heroic objects?a complement to the religious relics associated with the infancy and ministry of Christ?but the viewing attributed to Arne Olafsson implies that the saints as well as the heroes of old were equally deserving of admiratio.9 The next sighting took place in Denmark. According to an entry in the thirteenth-century Annales Ryenses from Ryd monastery, around the year 1252a knight named Henrik ^Emaelthorp transported a massive tooth he had acquired in Denmark back to Germany. The tooth was said to belong to "Stacathaer" . . . huius dens per Henricum ^Emaelthorp militem de Dacia in Teutoniam est portatus pro miraculo habens 6 pollices in magnitudine.10 . . . whose tooth was carried by Henrik ^Emaelthorp from Denmark into Ger many. A wondrous thing, it was six thumbs in size. Henrik iEmaelthorp, a northern German knight from Emmelndorf near Hannover, was a prominent figure in Danish politics during the turbulent years following the sudden death of king Abel in 1252. The demise of king Abel led to a contested succession for the crown of Denmark. Ultimately, Abel's young son Valdemar III was passed over and his uncle, Christopher I, was elected king. In response to this slight, Henrik ^Emaelthorp?a sup porter of Valdemar III?led a rebellion against Christopher during the g. There is one critical difference between the sword and the tooth, however?their unequal status in the manuscript record of L?gmanns-ann?ll. The bulk of L?gmanns-ann?ll is transmitted in manuscript AM 420 (late 14th century), with the first ten leaves attrib uted to Einar Hafli?sson (d. 1362/1363). Additional entries were added through the end of the 14th century. The L?gmanns-ann?ll was probably continued into the first decades of the fifteenth century as well, but these leaves are missing from AM 420 and the entries are known only through a later copy, AM 420 C, which dates from the middle of the 16th century. Arne Magnusson's alleged sighting of the teeth in Affrica is attested only in the younger, 16th-century copy. And yet, even this copy shows signs of further redaction, because the entire passage concerning Starka?r's teeth (par var oc taunn ersogd var ur Starkadi gamia. Var hun pverar handar a leingd oc brddd. fywrpat erj holldinu hafdi stadit) was interpolated into AM 420 C as a marginal entry, in the same hand, directly below the entry about Sigur?r's sword. The significance of this scribal juxtaposition?which concerns Starka?r alone?is unclear. 10.

At the point at which Henrik /Emaelthorp is mentioned, the Annales had been tracing the royal line of kingship in Denmark's distant past, and the annalist, closely following the Gesta Danorum as his source, had progressed only as far as the reign of Omund, who reigned in the late eighth or early ninth century. Sud denly, however, after noting that Starka?r had died during this same era, the annalist interpolates the brief notice about a contemporary figure from the thirteenth century?Henrik?who had carried the slain hero's enormous tooth out of Denmark. While the entry in the Annales Ryenses documents the "circulation" of Starka?r's teeth in the Nordic tradition in the middle of the thirteenth century, the first textual account of how Starka?r lost his teeth is several decades younger. It is found in Norna-Gests p?ttr, an Icelandic composi tion from the early fourteenth century that is typically transmitted as part of Olafs saga Tryggvasonar in mesta.13 The protagonist of Norna-Gests p?ttr is Gestr, a mysterious one-eyed wanderer (actually O?inn in disguise), who entertains the Norwegian king Ol?fr Tryggvason with tales of his encounters with figures from Scandinavia's heroic past.

He killed both men and horses, so that no one could withstand him for he was more like a giant than a man. Gunnarr told Sigur?r to mount an attack on this devil, because Gunnarr said he himself would not succeed in such an attempt. Sigur?r attacked the big man and some others with him, and most of them were unwilling in this. "Let us then quickly meet the big man," says Gestr, "and Sigur?r should ask him his name and where he is from." He said he was named Starka?r St?rverksson, from the north of Fenhring in Norway. Sigur?r said he had heard news of him before, and most of it bad. "Such men are not lacking in wickedness," he said. Starka?r asked, "Who is this man who is talking such big talk?" Sigur?r identified himself. Starka?r said, "Are you called F?fhisbani?" "That's right," said Sigur?r. Then Starka?r wanted to escape, but Sigur?r turned after him and raised his sword Gram into the air and dealt him a strong blow on the jaw with the hilt of the sword, so that two molars shot out of his mouth. That was a most grievous blow. Sigur?r told the scoundrel to get lost from there, and Starka?r then turned away from there. I took one of the two teeth, and I carried it with me. And now it hangs on the bell-rope in Denmark, and weighs seven ounces. People think it a curiosity to see it there. If assumptions about the composition of Norna-Gests p?ttr are correct, namely that the text was composed in Iceland around 1300, then the p?ttr cannot be the source of the entry in the Annales Ryenses.

Lundi ?Danm?rk . . . ip?m stad er Affrica heitir, and (according to a Danish annal) transported de Dacia into Germany.15 Taken as a whole, the details in Norna-Gests p?ttr and in the Annales Ry enses and L?gmanns-ann?ll confirm that on several occasions in different parts of the Nordic world, the teeth of this particular hero were exhibited as wondrous objects?in a true sense, as heroic relics?in the thirteenth through fifteenth centuries.16 The term "relic" is fully justified for these objects, I argue, not only because of the conspicuously devotional milieu in which the teeth were displayed (cf. L?gmanns-ann?ll and Norna-Gests p?ttr), but also because the teeth?like the bones of the saints?take on an explicitly mediating function: they serve as the focal point for a vast array of discourses about bodily construction and dissolution, about the persistence of (heroic) veneration and about contact with the Divine, the inexplicable, and the wondrous. And yet, these teeth are possessed of a strangeness that is quite unlike the sanctity that typically surrounds reli gious relics. The teeth, in contrast, appear excessive, abnormal, singularly uncanny; they are out of place and off the charts. Although the teeth appear in the historical and quasi-historical sources as optical proof of the physical existence of an ancient hero, their enor mous size calls into question the processes that set a hero of that stature into being. Indeed, as discussed below, the teeth are but one manifestation of a longstanding and energetic debate within the literary sources of the thirteenth century about the makeup of Starka?r's body and the conse quences of its difference. While other heroic traditions in Anglo-Saxon Britain and in medieval and late-medieval Germany likewise explored the dimensions of the heroic body, the Norse examples concerning Starka?r's 15. There may be some justification as to why certain redactions of Norna-Gests p?ttrspe cifically mention Lund cathedral as the final resting place for Starka?r's giant tooth. It is possible that this location was encouraged by analogy with the mysterious and ancient "j?tte Finn" ('giant Finn') figure that was carved into a stone pillar in the crypt of Lund cathedral in the late ith century. In this scenario, like has attracted like: the trace of one giant-figure in Lund attracts the relics of another. Similarly, the reference to the "bell rope" (klukkustreng) has a mythological context. As giants in Germanic folklore were believed to be afraid of the sound of ringing bells, using the tooth as a weight at the end of the rope seems an appropri ate fate for a problematic hero like Starka?r. 16.

Unlike the claims in the eighth century Liber Monstrorum about the giant-sized bones of Hygelac lying on display along the riverbank of the Rhine, or the account in the Liber de natura rerum of Thomas of Cantimpr? about the discovery of the enormous skeleton of an ancient hero named Theuton along the Danube (and its subsequent exhibition in thirteenth-century Vienna), or the entry in the Chronica civitatis Wormatiensis about the attempted excavation of Siegfried's giant-sized bones in 1488 in the city of Worms, the medieval Scandinavian texts about Starka?r's teeth were not influenced by the pull of the his tori cist "Riesen und Recken" topos of the Middle Ages, according to which the heroes of yore were believed to have been as large as giants. In the former cases, the somatic augmentation of the hero was inspired by the testimony of Genesis 6,4 about antedeluvian giants living in ilio tempore, in the age of greatness, and the subsequent search for (and exhibition of) the giant-sized bones attributed to prominent heroes has much to do with memoria, nostalgia for a vanished heroic age, and the desire to assert proto-nationalist claims about belongingness and ownership of territory.17 With Starka?r's teeth, the hermeneutic is of a different stripe. Here, the fragmented body parts do not call attention to the diminution of mankind since the close of the Heldenzeitalter'as much as they attest to the material Otherness of the hero in his own time. My approach is indebted to the work of Jeffrey Jerome Cohen, who argued that it was possible to apprehend the preoccupations and anxieties that were often sublimated in medieval cultures by measuring the unnatural, the singular, the extravagant. Thus one is able to set the points of reference for what is held as a standard.18 But herein lies the problem: it is exceedingly difficult, given the contradictory sources, to get an accurate measurement of Starka?r.

As a creature whose very existence defines the borders of the possible and whose abnormal and misshapen body engenders fascination and repulsion in equal measure, Starka?r's embodiment is strikingly similar to that of medieval monsters? those blemmyae, monopods, cyclopoi, and cynocephalitic creatures, among others?whose existence at the margins of the civilized world simultaneously threatened and upheld the stability of the natural order even as they served as a warning about the dangers of category breakdown and the limits of the anthropomorphic frame.21 The sum total of Starka?r's many transgressions (ethical, somatic, and mythical) reveal him to be the epitome of category ig- The most significant contributions to date include Axel Olrik, DanmarksHeltedigtning, anden del: Starkad den gamie og den yngre Skjoldungr kke (Copenhagen: G.

Indeed, as writes Isidore of Seville, discernment lies at the heart of monstrosity itself, for the root of the word monstrum is traced back to the verb monstrare, 4to show.' Isidore concludes that monsters exist in order to make known certain hidden truths about the natural world and the Divine plan: Monstra vero a monitu dicta, quod aliquid significando demonstrent, sive quod statim monstrent quid appereat. Monsters, in fact, are so called as warnings, because they explain something of meaning, or because they make known at once what is to become visible.22 As argued below, however, I maintain that what Starka?r's teeth "explain" about the limits of the heroic body is fundamentally different from the lessons offered by other epics, such as Beowulf or Grettis saga, in which the opposition between man and monster is likewise destabilized. A common feature of many studies on heroic monstrosity in the medi eval Germanic tradition is an interest in the assimilation of the hero to his non-human opponent during moments of particularly brutal combat.23 This somatic breakdown is made visible through the poets' use of ambigu ous pronouns during battle scenes,24 ambivalent terminology25 (e.g. Anglo Saxon r?nc 'warrior' used also to describe Grendel), and other techniques, 22.

But in each case these monstrous transforma tions are both temporary as well as situational; after the resolution of combat the hero returns to the "baseline" status of normative humanity. With Starka?r, in contrast, the somatic irregularities are indwelling in the hero from the very start. There is no condition under which the hero can escape his hybridity, nor do the epics and heroic poems in which Starka?r appears ever resolve the issue conclusively. Indeed, it is not until the huge teeth are actually sighted in the historical and pseudo-historical writings of medieval Scandinavia that the longstanding doubts, accusations, infer ences, and ambiguities about Starka?r's identity are finally laid to rest. STARKADR THE MONSTER Before we consider the meaning of Starka?r's teeth, our first task will be to trace the extent of Starka?r's monstrous embodiment in the Norse heroic tradition. Shades of a fundamental monstrosity can already be discerned in the oldest source in which Starka?r appears, a brief tenth century skaldic stanza by Vetrli?i. This poem, often interpreted as a hymn of praise to ?&gt;?rr, celebrates his prowess in slaying giants. Leggi brauzt Leiknar, lam?ir ?rivalda steyp?ir Starke?i st?tt of Gjolp dau?a You smashed the limbs of Leikn; you bashed ?&gt;r?valdi; you knocked down Starka?r; you trod Gj?lp dead underfoot.27 The stanza has a strong somatic focus. Lindow has shown that each of the giants mentioned in this stanza?Leikn, I&gt;rfvaldi, Starka?r, and Gj?lp?can be associated with specific parts of the giant body (legs, heads, the sexual organs, and so on) that were deformed or present in monstrous overabun 2 6.

Gj?lp, who attempted to drown ?&gt;orr with her urine stream or menstrual blood during ?&gt;?rr's visit to Geirr0?r, is clearly linked to the feminine reproductive organs.29 What about Starka?r's body, then? While Vetrli?i's stanza praises ?&gt;?rr for killing giants, on a deeper level t&gt;?rr's rage seems to be directed at specific giants whose monstrous deformities made them even more threatening. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that Vetrli?i was already aware in the tenth century of an accusation con cerning Starka?r's body that was fleshed out in younger sources, such as the thirteenth-century U redaction of Hervarar saga, amongst others, but is not mentioned in the skaldic stanza itself?namely, that the Starka?r whom t&gt;orr cast down to his death was a giant who was born with eight arms instead of two. In light of the overriding theme of Vetrli?i's verse? on the overexuberent, irrational bodies of the giants and on the ways they can be smashed, bashed, and crushed?Starka?r's inclusion in this stanza suggests that his monstrous embodiment was already firmly established by the tenth century. Accusations of physical deformity continue to overshadow the hero in the younger sources as well. In Gautreks saga, S?gubrot affornkonungum, the Gesta Danorum, and the U redaction of Hervarar saga, the issue of Starka?r's latent gigantism remains unresolved?it is never clearly ad dressed, but neither is it completely absent. Instead, the prose sources respond to the ambiguity in Starka?r's embodiment by identifying the cause of the abnormalities. Thus a new genealogy for Starka?r is created, according to which the eight-armed giant named Starka?r who was cast down by I&gt;orr (cf. the accounts in Vetrli?i and Hervarar saga) is identified as the paternal grandfather of the renowned hero whose adventures are recorded in Gautreks saga and in Saxo. By positioning the hero as the grandson of a giant, the irregularities that are still present in Starka?r can 28. John Lindow, "Addressing Thor," Scandinavian Studies, 60 (1988), 119-36. 29.

Vetrli?i was almost certainly aware of these echoes of Gj?lp's monstrous femininity, for her ambiguous fate in his poem?st?tt of Gj?lp dau?a, which some equate with her being crushed underfoot?could be alluding to a much more graphic assault if the verb st?ttu (&lt; st?ga) is understood to mean 'mounted.' This reading gains support from the preposition of ('over, above'), which explicitly denotes the superior position that I&gt;?rr has over his victim.

Although the prose text of Gautreh saga makes no mention of the eight arms, they are nonetheless not entirely absent. The superfluous arms are mentioned in the stanzas of the V?karsb?lkr, a quasi-elegiac, retrospective lay that is attributed to the hero himself.31 The V?karsb?lkr marks Starka?r's final appearance in the saga. Having fled to Uppsala after treacherously slaying king Olo in his royal bathtub, Starka?r hopes to recover from the shame of that deed. He is mocked by the king's retainers in Uppsala, however, and they taunt him as a reborn giant (endrbor?nn j?tunn) and a disgraced man (nidingr). Stung by their words, Starka?r reviews the events of his sad life, focusing on the murder of king Vikarr in Hordaland that earned him such enmity: i&gt;ess eyrindis, Thor shaped my shame, ordained me traitor, tied at ?&gt;?rr um sk?p m?r ni?ings nafn nau? margs konar; hlaut ek ?hr??igr illt at vinna. me to misery.

Note for the sake of comparison the way in which the physical prowess and ferocity of Egill Skallagrimsson is implicitly attributed in the saga to his grandfather Kveld-Ulfr, whose latent beserkr and theriomorphic tendencies play a prominent role in Egils saga Skallagrimssonar. On bloodlines as determinative of heroic prowess, see Kaaren Grimstad, "The Giant as a Heroic Model: The Case of Egill and Starka?r," Scandinavian Studies, 48 (1976), 284-98. A quick overview of the relevant issues concerning Starka?r's human/ giant ancestry is provided in Davidson and Fisher, eds., Saxo Grammaticus: The History of the Danes, Books I-IX, pp. ggf. 31. The testimony of Gautreks saga must be carefully evaluated, because the saga survives in two versions that differ in their characterization of Starka?r. The longer redaction of the saga (which is assumed to be younger) survives in paper manuscripts dating from the early 16th to the middle of the 17th century. The shorter redaction, attested by a vellum fragment from around 1400, is generally regarded as the older version of the saga. It is noteworthy that only the younger, longer redaction contains the episode known as Vikars p?ttr, a quasi-independent strand of the narrative that recounts in considerable detail the deeds of Starka?r and his slaying of king V?karr, and it is chiefly in this portion of the saga that Starka?r's transgressivity is emphasized. But even though the Vikars p?ttris a late inter polation, the prose text is supported upon an older narrative framework?the stanzas of the V?karsb?lkr, a heroic lay that dates from the end of the 1 ith or beginning of the 12 th century.

Old age was certainly a contributing factor in the diminishment of Starka?r's status at court and there are obvious parallels here to the predicament that the once vigorous Egill Skallagrimsson faced late in life, when, as Carol Clover observed, the heroic body inevitably becomes blaudr, emasculated, with the passage of time.36 And yet, Starka?r's abjection is much more acute than this; old age alone is insufficient grounds for his banishment to the borders of the civilized world, his inability to win gold or songs of praise, his estrangement (dr?ttinlauss) from the heroic norm. Even Starka?r's status as a ni?ingr cannot account fully for every indignity that the hero is forced to endure. Instead, we must look?as Starka?r and the men at Uppsala do?beyond the natural disfigurements to the body that come as a consequence of heroic adventuring and consider, instead, the deeply unsettling unnaturalness that manifests itself on Starka?r's body through the ?Qtunkuml atta handa. The phrase itself (and the somatic features to which it refers) is am biguous. Starka?r may be referring to the scars left behind after ?&gt;?rr's amputation of his superfluous arms, as attested in Saxo (ONj?tunn 'giant,' kuml 'badge, mark, monument'), or perhaps to some unusual birthmarks that the younger (human) Starka?r Storverksson figure in Gautreks saga "inherited" in a mythical sense from his grandfather, the older eight armed Starka?r Aludrengr figure who was cast down by ?&gt;orr. While the exact meaning of j?tunkuml atta handa is elusive, the semiotic function is indisputable and, indeed, of greater importance. To the men in Uppsala, Starka?r is unquestionably a monstrous figure because his body bears the ?Qtunkuml, the giant's mark, reminiscent of a violent encounter with the giant-killer I&gt;orr. And since only the giants can battle I&gt;orr and live, the bearer of these scars is functionally a giant as well, an Other figure who had been "reborn" (endrbonnn) in the guise of a human warrior and whose transgressions break not only legal taboos against murder but ethical and somatic ones as well. Starka?r is neither man nor giant exclusively, but some perversion of both. Likewise, the phrase j?furs greppi resonates on different levels of Starka?r's liminal status. The word greppr can mean either 'man' or 'poet,' but which of these is the primary meaning is uncertain.37 In the end, the two connota tions of greppr are in play in the final line of the V?karsb?lkr: there is greppr, 36.

'warrior of a boar') who deserves no less than to be excluded from the bounds of heroic society. Starka?r's mixed embodiment is also a concern in the Gesta Danorum, but Saxo Grammaticus presents a radically different portrait of the hero. In book six Saxo launches into a strongly worded defense of Starka?r's explicitly human origins. The hero, he asserts, is free from any hint of abnormality or monstrosity: Fabulosa autem et vulgaris opinio quaedam super ipsius ortu rationi incon sentanea atque a veri fide penitus aliena confinxit. Tradunt enim quidam, quod a gigantibus editus monstruosi generis habi turn inusitata manuum numer ositate prodiderit, asseruntque Thor deum quattuor ex his affluentis naturae vitio procrearas, elisis nervorum compagibus, avulsisse atque ab integritate corporis prodigiales digitorum eruisse complexus, ita ut, duabus tantum relictis, corpus, quod ante in giganteae granditatis statum effluxerat eiusque formam informi membrorum multitudine repraesentabat, postmodum me liore castigatum simulacro brevitatis humanae modulo caperetur.41 But a common tale has been invented about his origin, which is fictitious, unreasonable and downright incredible. For some folks tell how he was born of giants and revealed his monster kind by an extraordinary number of hands. They assert that the god I&gt;?rr broke the sinews which joined four of these superfluous extensions of freakish Nature and tore them off, plucking away the unnatural bunches of fingers from the body proper; with only two arms left, his frame, which before had run to a gigantic enormity and had been shaped with a gro tesque crowd of limbs, was afterwards corrected according to a better model and contained within the more limited dimensions of men.42 38.

In this passage from Saxo, Starcatherus has only six arms?four of which were said to be removed by ???rr. The discrepancy between eight and six is minor, as the underlying concept of an overabundance of arms remains. Some degree of legendary tripling could be assumed to have shaped the oral transmission of this mythologem, whereby Starka?r's three lifespans (granted him by O inn) and three shameful, criminal acts he is fated to commit (a curse bestowed by P?rr) were matched up with three (not four) original sets of arms.</page><page sequence="18">18 Layher This passage marks another important milestone in the ongoing debate in the Norse tradition about allegations of abnormality in the body of this hero. Saxo's pr?cis of this encounter presents it as an aggressive act of discipline: the superior being re-fashions the transgressive body back into a more human form, dorr's decision to remove Starcatherus's extra arms instead of killing him outright is quite incongruous, however, for I&gt;orr often appears in Norse myth as a giant-killer and conqueror of all that is unnatural; why should Starcatherus be spared here? Dum?zil and Polom?, reading t&gt;orr's deed as an act of mercy, explore the ramifications of this encounter for Starka?r's status as an O?inn-hero or I&gt;?rr-hero in the Norse tradition.431 do not mean to revisit those arguments here, for my overriding interest is not in ?&gt;?rr, but in Saxo and his engagement with the fundamental question of Starka?r's deformity. Saxo's rejection of the myth may have been influenced by the euhemer ist tendencies that are evident in the Gesta Danorum as a whole. By repu diating any whiff of monstrous deformity in the hero's body, Saxo is able to simultaneously undermine dorr's status as a Norse deity, for in this scenario the two figures, victim and victimizer, are inextricably linked; and if Starcatherus had not eight arms but only two, then the tales about ?&gt;?rr's superhuman prowess?that is, his ability to "fix" Starcatherus's abnormality?must likewise be considered bogus. A second possibility is that a concern with historiography and reliable sources led Saxo to dis miss the fabulosa autem et vulgaris opinio about Starcatherus's superfluous arms. Perhaps this rogue tale (vulgans opinio) that reached Saxo's ears was considered incredible, or even factually incorrect. We should note, in fact, that the plurality of arms is always attributed in the vernacular texts to the grandfather, the giant who was hurled over a waterfall to his death by ?&gt;?rr, and not to the grandson. Saxo knows this too, as his hero Starcatherus is clearly identified as the "son of Storverk," that is, the grandson of the eight-armed Starka?r. While the debate about Saxo's euhemerism and his sources will surely continue, I would like to offer a third interpretation of this passage, one that highlights the threat that a monstrous embodiment would represent for Starcatherus's reputation in the Gesta Danorum as the national hero of the Danish people. By denying the allegations about Starcatherus's unnatural birth and monstrous deformity, Saxo is able to present this popular legendary figure not as a rogue and brutish giant/human hybrid but as a valiant swordsman created in the natural order of things, a hero whose "wonderful pre-eminence of mind and body" and "superhuman physique" gained him "brilliant repute even through all the provinces 43- Georges Dum?zil, Aspects de la fonction guerri?re chez les Indo-Europ?ns (Paris: Presses universitaires de France, 1956); Polom?, "Starka?: O?inn- or I&gt;?rr-Hero?"</page><page sequence="19">Starka?r's Teeth 19 of Sweden and Saxony."44 Even though Saxo admits that Starcatherus was "remarkable for his unusual size,"45 the same could be said for other luminaries in the Old Norse hero tradition such as Hr?lfr kraki or Egill Skallagrimsson, whose excessive physicality is attributed to the giants, half-trolls, or shape-shifters that were counted among their ancestors. Thus the Gesta Danorum acknowledges certain unavoidable truths about Starcatherus?that his body was huge and hulking, impervious to cold and impossible to kill, and that his birthplace lay in the eastern borderlands of the Baltic region that were typically associated with giants?while at the same time it refuses to accept the implications of his embodiment. The Gesta Danorum can tolerate?even embrace?a large champion, but it cannot abide the idea of a monstrous one, for the body of Denmark's greatest champion, the very embodiment of Danish superiority, cannot be understood to be defective or monstrously misshapen. Any grotesque deformities of the body would inevitably undermine the moral or ethical superiority of the hero.46 While Saxo's rebuttal targets both the unnatural birth and the rumored "gigantic enormity" of the hero, I would argue that the enduring, popular myth of the superfluous arms represented a far more serious challenge to Saxo's historical project, for if Starcatherus had indeed been born with a surplus of limbs, ?&gt;?rr's correction of this deformity becomes little more than a cosmetic adjustment, a treatment of the symptoms of somatic deviance but not a cure for its fundamental cause. It is on precisely this issue?on how Starka?r's body came to be as it was?that Gesta Danorum and Gautreks saga differ considerably47 While the 44?

Note, for example, the way in which Starcatherus is used as a vehicle for expressing proto-nationalist viewpoints about the superiority of Danish heritage. See, for example, Saxo's critique of the fussy and sumptuous German tastes that were corrupting traditional Danish cuisine and undermining its virile customs: "When he [Starcatherus] saw the ancient habits of temperance and all the good customs being perverted by this new luxuriousness and unrestraint, he looked for a serving of coarse food, disdaining the costliness of a more lavish meal. . . He had no desire to weaken the sinews of true manliness by contamination with the synthetic sweetness of foreign rarities." A comparison with Ingel's behavior shows a dramatic contrast between the two men. After Ingel had "dabbled in Teuton fashions, he felt no shame in submitting to their unmasculine frivolities. Many epicurian nourishments poured from that drain down the throats of our countrymen." Davidson and Fisher, eds., Saxo Orammaticus: The History of the Danes, Books I-IX, I, p. 185. 47. The witness of the V?karsb?lkr, a 12th-century poem, shows that the narrative contours of Starka?r's betrayal and murder of Vikarr were already part of the heroic tradition during the time that Saxo was engaged with the Gesta Danorum. Thus while it is certainly correct to categorize the Vikars p?ttr as a late interpolation into the saga, the events described in the V?karsb?lkr?among them, a reference to I&gt;?rr's malevolence and his "cursing" of Starka?r?</page><page sequence="20">2 o Layher Latin text eloquently defends the integrity and unity of Denmark's national hero and absolves the Norse gods from any role in creating or adjusting it, in Gautreks saga the ambiguities and contradictions that characterize the Starka?r figure are blamed on the /Esir themselves: it is they who (mis) shape Starka?r into the wondrous and terrible figure he was known to be. The saga records that Starka?r, a loyal champion of king Vikarr, was awakened by night by his foster-father Hrossh?rs-Grani (again, this is ??inn in disguise) and taken onto a nearby island. There, Starka?r's fate was adjudicated by the twelve men?ten plus ??inn and ?&gt;?rr?who sat in chairs around a clearing. As the scene unfolds, the two gods take turns blessing and cursing Starka?r in equal measure. Each of O?inn's blessings is matched by a cor responding curse from ?&gt;?rr: although Starka?r is granted a lifespan of three lifetimes, vast riches, the victory in every battle and the ability to declaim poetry as quickly as speaking, he is also cursed to commit an evil deed in each lifespan, to suffer grievous wounds in every battle, and to forget his poetry as quickly as it is spoken.48 It becomes clear during this episode that Starka?r is not merely a pawn in a clash of wills between ??inn and ?&gt;?rr; rather, his embodiment?his physical body together with his reputation, prowess and heroic legacy?becomes the battlefield itself. In the end, the oppositions do not cancel each other out. Instead, they work to transform Starka?r into a new, hybrid creature that is riven by irre solvable?even arbitrary?contradictions. Thus the saga author responds to longstanding inconsistencies in the Starka?r tradition by offering up a tidy explanation for that which had previously resisted easy explication. This episode in Gautreks saga asserts that Starka?r's many transgressions of ethi cal, heroic, and somatic boundaries were not the fault of his bloodline or his lineage, that is, not caused by natural means, but were rather the result of an ill-fated and contentious "second birth" at the hands of the gods. In creating Starka?r anew through curses and blessings, ??inn and I&gt;orr do not only use the language of parentage and genetic inheritance?both utter phrases like ek gef honom pat ( give him this . . .') or pat skapa ek honum ( ordain that he . . .')?but they also take on oppositional roles that recall, in a structural sense, the procreation myths of the gods, es pecially those that concern a mixed union between one of the /Esir and a giantess. Clunies Ross has shown that miscegenation, taboo-breaking, and various degrees of bloodline "contamination" are widely attested in the social structures of the /Esir and Vanir, where interbreeding between indicate that the account in the younger, longer version of Gautreks sagawzs not the invention of a later redactor. The encounter between Starka?r, O?inn and ?&gt;?rr (see below) must also date to the 12 th century, if not earlier. 48.

At the same time, however, the myths and their reflections in the skaldic tradition (especially in kennings) reveal the fundamental imbalances and anxieties that undergirded the Norse procreative system: that while giantesses were suitable and even desirable mates for the gods, the goddesses of the JEsir were not to be wed to giants, and indeed, were to be kept secluded, apart, off-limits. So, too, in this scene from Gautrefa saga, for the bloodline of the offspring is blessed by the seed of the Norse god (here it is O?inn), while from the Other (i.e., t&gt;orr) comes strength and cunning, but also treachery, unpredictability, a predilection for excess.49 The blessings and curses bestowed by O?inn and !&gt;?rr are thus shown to have a generative effect, in that Starka?r is essentially recreated on the spot into an uncanny and ill-fated "son" that is defined by (indeed, held captive to) the contra dictions bestowed on him by his "parents" on either side. Such divisions against self are not uncommon in the Norse tradition, and numerous examples can be found in the bloodlines of prominent heroes (Egil's grandmother was a half-troll), in the lives of the gods (Ymir or Loki, for example), or in O?inn's transgressive engagement with the feminized magic of seidr.50 Nevertheless, the divisions made evident in Starka?r are unique and distinctive, because the episode in Gautreks saga and the echoes of a similar encounter in Saxo and some younger texts reveal the extent to which Starka?r was regarded as an artificial hero, one whose embodiment was shaped not by the natural standard of the heroic bloodline, but by a capricious and arbitrary interruption of it.51 49? My reading of the mythical undercurrents present in the re-birth of the monstrous Starka?r in this scene from Gautreks saga does not assert that P?rr is the feminized partner in this union. Rather, I call attention to Clunies Ross' arguments about the gender-balance of Norse procreative myth, namely that creation is in many respects a "male pseudo-pro creation" in which paternity is dominant. Thus I see P?rr taking the role of Other that was typically assigned to giantesses. Margaret Clunies Ross, Prolonged Echoes.

The Hrossh?rs-Grani episode in Gautreks saga is unattested in the other sources, but antecedents of it can be seen in Saxo's Gesta Danorum and in the Rerum Danicarum Frag menta of the Icelandic scholar Arngr?mur J?nsson ( 1568-1648). The Fragmenta give details related nowhere else about the battle between ?&gt;?rr and the eight-armed giant Starka?r. In this version of the encounter, P?rr is said to rip off Starka?r's offending arms before killing him. In all likelihood, this is another iteration of the same communis opinio myth that Saxo</page><page sequence="22">2 2 Layher By presenting the hero as the radical offspring of two gods who were engaged in an adversarial and contradictory act of creation, the author brings the Norse understanding of Starka?r's unique origins closer into line with medieval European beliefs about monstrogenesis. According to Isidore's Etymologies, monsters were considered part of creation rather than freaks of nature. No matter how fantastical a monster's somatic deforma tion might be, Isidore asserts that its origins were neither accidental nor unprecedented: non sunt contra naturam, quia divinia vol?ntate hunt, cum voluntas Creatoris cuiusque conditae rei natura sit.52 they are not contrary to nature, because they come about through Divine will, since the will of the Creator is the nature of every thing that is created. The bodies of the monstrous races of the medieval Imaginary were there fore not regarded as existing contra naturam, but rather extra naturam? that is, as unusual beings whose uniqueness did not break the rules of creation as much as illustrate the mystery, ineffability and arbitrariness of these rules. Because the bodies of the wondrous and exotic monsters that populated the limits of the known world demonstrate in their somatic mixtures and corporeal amplifications the extent of God's mastery over physical form, they also confirm, as Mary Campbell points out, the basic soundness of Christian doctrine: these bizarre bodies "... exist to prove God's power over our bodies at the Resurrection."53 Precisely this issue of revelation?what Starka?r's monstrous body means?rests at the core of the disagreement about his embodiment. Since mythography, like nature, abhors a vacuum, the prose sources at tempted, each in their own way, to provide some clarity on the issue of cause; for if the cause can be identified, the significances of the object it engenders can also be adduced. Thus Saxo and the prose sources pro vide a diagnosis of the somatic abnormalities that manifest themselves in Starka?r's body. In Gautreks saga, Starka?r's transformational rebirth harks back to an established theme in Norse myth?namely, the notion that the ALsir (and especially O?inn) bring naught but harm when they condemned in the Gesta Danorum. According to Turville-Petre the Fragmenta follow a lost 12th-century source that antedates the written accounts in Gautreks saga and Saxo. Turville Petre, Myth and Religion of the North. The Religion of Ancient Scandinavia, p. 209. In all three accounts, ?&gt;?rr is said to be actively engaged in the "shaping" of Starka?r, either for good or for ill. The fact that the sources assign different motives and contexts to this mythologem does not obscure its fundamental importance, nor its singularity: that Starka?r underwent a secondary creation at the hands of the iEsir. 52.

Starka?r therefore appears as an uncanny reminder of the arbitrariness and omnipotence of the /Esir; the hero is the victim of external circumstances. The Gesta Danorum, in contrast, sees internal forces at work. Saxo presents Starcatherus as a man whose embodiment was enhanced by the dominant traits of an (admittedly unusual) heroic bloodline, and for this reason Starcatherus's body cannot bear any particular significance or meaning outside of the natural order. He is a hero shaped, essentially, by nature. The disembodied teeth, in contrast, reveal nothing of the hero's ori gins?and yet, they offer surety of a different kind. While the accounts in Norna-Gests p?ttr and in the Annales Ryenses and L?gmanns-ann?ll still engage with the perennial concern in the Norse tradition about Starka?r's body, these episodes are very much focused on the what rather than the how of Starka?r's embodiment; the texts pay close attention to the physical appearance, size and weight of the enormous teeth, the context of their historical sightings and the persons who viewed them. Thus the teeth, to borrow a phrase from Isidore of Seville, reveal or "make (s) known at once" (statim) that which the Norse heroic tradition had long alluded to, argued about, or struggled to incorporate. In the retrospective view propagated in the annals and in Norna-Gests p?ttr, all ambiguity is suddenly cleared away: the witness of the enormous teeth proves that Starka?r had indeed been monstrously large?and at the same time, however, something less than completely human. This duality may offer partial justification for the curious hold that Starka?r's teeth have in the Norse tradition. Taken in sum, the sources indicate that Starka?r?unlike most heroes in the medieval Germanic tradition?was famous more for what he was than for what he did; or more precisely, it is the nature of his unique embodiment (and no small measure of wonder about its cause and composition) that serves as his lasting legacy in Old Norse. Thus it is fitting that the relic associated with Starka?r is a corporeal remnant of the monstrous body itself, instead of an ancillary object such as a huge sword, helmet, suit of armor, and the like?items that attest to the size of the heroic body by means of a secondary rather than a primary witness. The teeth offer proof about the physicality of the body, not simply about its size. What is more, the teeth historicize that body in a way that other objects cannot. Because the teeth were knocked out during Starka?r's ignominious defeat, their very existence as relics is inescapably tied to the precise moment in which the hero's physical superiority was undermined from within, and quickly overcome. They are a lasting monument to the hero's mixed embodiment: somatically exuberant, yet humming with shame.</page><page sequence="24">24 Layher HEROIC PRESENT, HEROIC PAST In the end, what do Starka?r's teeth reveal about the diffusion and trans mission of mythologems across the entire Nordic realm, from Iceland to Norway to Denmark, during the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries? Is this tooth a uniquely tangible, incarnate example of the predominantly textual "echoes" of Norse myth that Margaret Clunies Ross has made us aware of in a different context?54 The verbal and auditory metaphors that inform Clunies Ross's approach?her focus on source, reverberation and echo?provide a useful model for conceptualizing the embellishments and amplifications that the Starka?r-figure underwent in the Nordic tra dition, and her work calls attention to the distances (both temporal and geographical) that a particular mythologem can travel in the medieval Scandinavian tradition. Nevertheless, it is significant in the particular case of Starka?r's teeth that the primary organ of mythical transmission and reception is not the ear, but the eye. While the embellishment of the Starka?r figure was certainly traduced and encouraged within the East Norse oral tradition that Saxo acknowledges in book six of the Gesta Danorum, the ocular focus of the accounts in L?gmanns-ann?ll, in the An nales Ryensis, and in Norna-Gests p?ttr suggests that the interpretive context within which these massive teeth appeared and were venerated was not an exclusively Norse, rigidly mythical one. Rather, the sightings of these teeth in exclusively historical and quasi-historical accounts show remark able parallels with the way in which the medieval literature of wonders, and especially medieval travel writing, frames the exotic. In each case, Starka?r's tooth is linked to a specific person, a specific time, and a definitive place?just as is the case in much medieval travel writing like that found in the Anglo-Saxon Wonders of the East, the accounts by John Mandeville, or the apocryphal letters of Alexander to Aristode. In these texts as in the Norse accounts featuring Starka?r's teeth, there is an indisputable correlation between eyewitness accounts and wonder. Only that which has been seen first-hand by a reputable spectator?whom we might call the primary viewer?is considered authentic. By the same token, only credible reports are capable of invoking wonder, for that which is im plausible, fanciful, or ridiculous is not wondrous, but simply (and literally) incredible. Accordingly, the accounts in Norna-Gests p?ttr and the Danish and Icelandic annals do all they can to corroborate the tooth's physical reality. Each text gives the exact size of the tooth (accounts vary from three spans or six thumbs, the weight as six or seven ounces), and places it in a specific location, be it in Danm?rk, on the bell-rope in the cathedral at Lund, in Affrica, or in transit de Dacia in Teutonia. But the Norse texts go 54? Clunies Ross, Prolonged Echoes. Old Norse Myths in Medieval Northern Society.</page><page sequence="25">Starka?r's Teeth 25 further still, by identifying?in exactly the same manner as is done in the medieval literature of wonders?the primary viewer of the object itself: be it Henrik iEmaelthorp, Arne Olafsson or, in Norna-Gests p?ttr, Gestr himself. It is through their eyes that the accounts of Starka?r's teeth take on reality, their authenticating spectatorship that makes it possible for contemporary audiences in thirteenth-fifteenth century Scandinavia to regard the sight ings of these immense teeth not as idle fabulations, but rather as credible reports that satisfy the etiological demands of the literature of wonders. The teeth are real because they have been seen; and once seen?even by proxy, through the eyes of the prime viewer?they are wondrous. And lastly, because the teeth are wondrous, they are valuable. In the An nales Ryensis, for example, the tooth was a powerful political symbol?not solely for Henrik, but above all for the Danish prince Valdemar, the young nephew of king Christopher I, whose cause Henrik supported. The cam paigns that Henrik waged against Christopher in the years 1252-54 were part of a broader offensive by Valdemar and his allies, chief among them the northern German lords of Brandenburg, Holstein, and Mecklenburg, to press Valdemar's rightful claim to the Danish throne. Starka?r's tooth must have played a role in that quest. Henrik's possession of Starka?r's tooth in the year 1252, and the manner in which he transported it, is strongly reminiscent of the process of translatio of other Nordic saints' relics from one sanctuary to another.55 By removing this famous tooth from wherever it was kept (perhaps indeed at Lund cathedral?) and taking it to Germany, Henrik was able to strike at the legitimacy and security of Christopher's reign itself. In the end, it matters little how Henrik acquired the tooth?through theft or purchase?for the end justified the means: the physical remains of Denmark's most valiant hero had fallen into the hands of the rebel leader.56 In Norna-Gests p?ttr, too, the tooth has a sacral as well as a heroic func tion. In claiming that one of the teeth hangs on a bell rope in a Denmark cathedral "now" and that some men believe it can still be seen there, Gestr describes a context for exhibition that closely mimics the ways in which religious relics were placed into appropriate settings, mounted, and dis played.57 Gestr was not merely a witness to the only significant defeat that 55? Thomas A. DuBois, Nordic Religions in the Viking Age (Philadelphia: Univ. of Pennsylvania Press, 1999), p. 64. 56.

In a real sense, Gestr uses the tooth to establish his authority as a heroic adventurer of the highest caliber. The tooth's purpose in L?gmanns-ann?ll is harder to adduce. In 1413, some eight to nine years after Arne Olafsson's voyage to Affrica, Arne was made the archbishop of Skalh?lt. At the time of his appointment Arne was the first native-born Icelandic archbishop in that post for over sixty years. It is tempting to regard the entry in the L?gmanns-ann?ll as an at tempt to draw an association between Arne Olafsson and Bishop Vilchin Hinriksson of Sk?lholt, a beloved and highly-accomplished administrator who died in 1405?the same year in which Arne was named penitentia?us. The link is obvious on the textual level, in that the laudatory necrology for Vilchin Hinriksson segues immediately into the report about Arne and the relics he saw in Affrica, but it likely resonated also, most especially for Icelandic audiences in the areas around Sk?lholt, on the devotional level. Vilchin is remembered for his sponsorship of the gilding of the skull of St. I&gt;orlak in silver, and its enshrinement in a reliquary in a local church. Perhaps the annalist of L?gmanns-ann?ll sees this as the connection?that the viewing of the relics in Affrica is a testament to the broad experience of Arne Olafsson, whose travels brought him in contact with some of the most sacred objects of the Christian faith and of the heroic past. A plausible hypothesis, perhaps, but let us return to the enigmatic state of the manuscript evidence for this entry in L?gmanns-ann?ll, which forces us to consider another likely possibility?that Arne did not see the tooth at all. The reference to Starka?r's tooth exists only as an interlineal inter polation in AM 420 C, which subordinates it to the passage in the main text about the hilt of Sigur?r's sword. The Starka?r passage appears as a scribal afterthought, the tooth as a complement to the sword hilt that Arne definitively "saw" (sa hann) on display, and indeed, the structural dependencies in the underlying myth that was captured and recorded in Norna-Gests p?ttr may well have proved impossible for the fifteenth-century annalist to resist. Thus the clash between hero and anti-hero in the heroic tale, which culminated in the cause and effect of Sigur?r's famous strike to Starka?r's face, is reified in the historical account through reference to the unbreakable dyad of sword and tooth. Here, for a final time, the iconic power of Starka?r's monstrous teeth leaves its mark: so wondrous and strange as to cause a "sighting" in the historical record where perhaps none had actually taken place.</page></plain_text>
