<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHORTER NOTICES LABOR RELATIONS UNDER THE RECOVERY ACT. By Ordway Tead and Henry C. Metcalf. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Co., I933. Pp. Xii+259. Though written before the clarification of the National Industrial Recovery Act through interpretations and compromises had begun, this book attempts to afford practical guidance to trade associations and employers in dealing with their labor relations under the Act itself. The attempt is not as hazardous as it sounds. The authors have long been known for careful studies, liberally in- formed, of the relations between management and labor. The third complete revision of their text, Personnel Administration: Its Principles and Practice, was issuing from the press as the NRA was taking form. They have drawn upon their wide acquaintance with both the theory and the practice of various forms of collective bargaining. The present volume leaves undiscussed no available form of meeting the de- mand of the national government that collective bargaining be everywhere recognized in industrial relations. Company unions are explained and evaluated. The difficulties and advantages of labor unions as a form of collective bargaining are set forth. The few previous efforts in this country at joint conference on an industry-wide basis are also searched for fruitful clues as to the way ahead. There are two major assumptions underlying the book: the first, that past experience in labor relations can be made fruitful for future improvement under a new set-up; the second, that our industrial life should be organized and pro-</page><page sequence="2">278 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS moted in the spirit of democracy which our political life has historically illus- trated. There is obvious satisfaction that collective bargaining has now authori- tative support; and this satisfaction is informed by what experience has taught the authors as to the industrial efficiency of the democratic principle. The text of the Recovery Act is conveniently placed in an Appendix. T. V. S. THE AMERICAN DOCTRINE OF JUDICIAL SUPREMACY. (2d ed., revised and en- larged.) By Charles Grove Haines. ("Publications of the University of California at Los Angeles in Social Sciences," Vol. I.) Berkeley: University of California Press, I932. Pp. xviii+705. $6.oo. It is a matter of congratulation for the University of California at Los Angeles that the revised edition of this important work introduces its "Social Science Series." Since I914, the date of the first edition, Professor Haines's work has furnished the best reasoned exposition of the American theory and practice of judicial supremacy. A happy combination of philosophic insight and legal learning enabled the author to orient the doctrine in the ideologies of the past; a historical sagacity enabled him to trace its history following adoption and institutionalization, through the vicissitudes of our national growth. Nor were the critics forgotten. Above all, the meaning of the supremacy from the liberal point of view was kept to the fore. But the present revision is projected against a world more changed than the short period of eighteen years easily suggests. The war and the peace have quickened consideration of the American theory in foreign countries. Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Germany adopted the theory of judicial supremacy; other countries have agitated for it; and America made it an important issue in the national election of I924. Cognizant of the projection of the doctrine into the forefront of "modern constitutionalism," Professor Haines here takes stock of scholarly contributions recently made as well as of changes in the world so re- cently recorded, and gives us a definitive statement of the morphology, the oc- casion, the triumph, and the history of this most distinctive American contribu- tion to the theory and the practice of modern statecraft. T. V. S. THE CHALLENGE OF EUROPE. By Sherwood Eddy. London: Allen and Unwin, 1933. PP. 335. ios. 6d. net. Mr. Sherwood Eddy's travels in many lands give color to this summary of the situation in different European countries, as it was in I932. The statistical and other facts, useful for an estimate of the countries, are given, as well as many shrewd judgments on the characteristics of each people. The note on snobbery in Great Britain shows that Mr. Eddy is well able to pierce below superficial forms of politics. But in speaking of Great Britain, Mr. Eddy is compelled to deal with the Empire, and the problems of the Empire are not European. The situation in the whole world is changing. Mr. Eddy is addressing America be- cause of the problems put before her by the European nations. But are we not</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 279 all facing an unprecedented and an unforeseen crisis in culture, as well as in politics and economics? The issues in social life today are fundamentally moral. What is in doubt is not how to do anything but what is worth doing. C. D. B. THE UNITED STATES OF EUROPE AND OTHER ESSAYS. By Sir Arthur Salter. London: Allen and Unwin, I933. Pp. 303. 7s. 6d. net. This is a valuable collection of notes made by Sir Arthur Salter during his service on the Secretariat of the League of Nations at Geneva. The notes serve as an indication of the growth of experience in the actual conduct of internation- al affairs. The author's opinions are not the same in the earlier essays of i919 as they are in the later essays of I93I. But the very change of opinion, as circum- stances changed, is of first-rate importance for the student. Too much of the theory of international affairs is static. It is the old attempt to fit a particular system of terms and ideas on to a very new area of experience. The contact with actual difficulties and tasks to be performed is a corrective: and this Sir Arthur's book provides. He deals with the structure of the League, with economic inter- national problems, and with disarmament. Useful notes are added by the editor, Mr. Arnold-Forster, in order that the situation to which each essay refers may be better understood. C. D. B. SACRAMENTS OF SIMPLE FOLK. By R. R. Marrett. Oxford: Clarendon Press, I933. Pp. 229. ios. net. If it did not sound sentimental, it might be said that this is a beautiful book, so great is the relief to a reader of many books when he finds one written by an "educated" man! So rare is that quality which is indicated in the subtler sense of the word "educated"! This book is a continuation of the theme followed in Faith, Hope and Charity in Primitive Religion. The author now discusses the ceremonies by which simple folk give sacredness to such acts as eating, fighting, ruling, and dying. Or perhaps one ought to say that these are the ways by which they find sacredness in common things. As a study in moral perceptiveness this book might help the student of moral philosophy to be less "superior." Dr. Marrett has wit. For example, he says that there are theorists "who fall back on instinct, that last refuge of the psychologically destitute"; and others who use "none too well authenticated parallels from the social habits of gorillas, with whom they are not likely to have been in personal contact." The great learning which lies behind the interpretation of savage ceremonies is nowhere obtruded, but the reader feels that the generosity of the interpretation offered is based upon a candid review of the facts, not upon an empty sentiment. The various forms of our own social custom, both eating together and dying alone, are here in their earliest development. The principle of interpretation is an understand- ing of contemporary social life, which many anthropologists lack. And the value of Dr. Marrett's study is not simply in the advance it makes in anthropology, but in the hints and suggestions which illuminate the social problems of today.</page><page sequence="4">280 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS For example, on the question of physical and spiritual health-"the votaries of medical science are at least united in one communion .....

LE DIEU DE BERGSON. By smile Rideau. Paris: Librairie Felix Alcan, I932. Pp. I38. Fr. I2. Professor Rideau has attempted to evaluate the philosophy of Bergson, and particularly its religious aspects, from the viewpoint of orthodox Catholicism. As a result he has come to believe that Bergson's most conspicuous service to philosophy must be sought for in his whole-hearted emphasis on the pre-emi- nent value of the spirit of freedom. But the anti-intellectualism of Bergson, which our author believes grossly exaggerated by a great many of his interpre- ters, is also of a distinct and positive value to a religious mind, since its sharp distinction between matter and spirit is in harmony with the most basic require- ments of the Christian faith. And then again, Professor Rideau points out, it may also be noticed that the problem of God becomes an essentially religious problem for Bergson, particularly in his latest work, where the value and im- portance of Christian mysticism for the solution of all the relevant problems receives its due recognition. The conception of God that thus emerges out of Bergson's philosophy is thus that of a God who both needs and is needed by man, simply because he himself is an incarnation of love. The universe thus is revealed, in accordance with Christian teaching, to be but the visible and tangible aspect of the divine love itself. SVEN NILSON LES RAPPORTS DE LA MATIERE ET DE L'ESPRIT DANS LE BERGSONISME. By Imile Rideau. Paris: Librairie Felix Alcan, I932. Pp. i84. Fr. 20. The author himself refers to this latest study -of Bergson's philosophy as "a dialectical reconstruction," in which a study of the historical development of Bergsonism is supplemented by a presentation of its "static reality." It is to the latter phase of his work that this reviewer prefers to call the attention of its prospective readers, as Professor Rideau, on the whole, seems to have succeeded somewhat better in his presentation of the spirit of Bergsonism than he has done in his account of its growth. The philosophy of Bergson is, according to him, not so much a philosophical method as a world-view; a philosophy of labor in which man is exalted to the final cause of the universe, which itself is but the visible expression of God's need of man and his love for him. Professor Rideau also takes pains to show that the anti-intellectual or anti-rational strain in Bergson's philosophy is far less pronounced than a superficial study of his works might lead one to suppose. Intelligence and intuition must, according to him, be taken as mutually supple- mentary, rather than as fundamentally opposed to one another. Among Profes-</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 28i sor Rideau's other ideas, one may perhaps also call attention to his suggestion that any future development of Bergson's philosophy calls for a revision of Bergon's time-concept in the light of the theory of relativity. SVEN NILSON REPUBLICAN RELIGION: THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION AND THE CULT OF REASON. By G. Adolf Koch. New York: Henry Holt &amp; Co. I933. Pp. xvi +334. $3.00. This is the first thorough study of a school of American thought which flour- ished especially during the latter part of the eighteenth century. Without at- tempting to prove that the deist movement in the East had a wide effect upon philosophic trends subsequently, the author does prove that the movement was an important and in some ways a brilliant one while it lasted. At least to such extent does the historian of American philosophy need to bring this book to his attention. The rise of deism in this country is traced by Dr. Koch to several causes- among others, the influence of Britain and France; modifications of the Puritan's stern mode of life; the spirit of republicanism induced by the American Revolu- tion. He establishes, therefore, that early deism was integrally related to its political and economic, as well as its intellectual, setting; and he continues this interpretation through to Unitarianism and "the triumph of fidelity" once more. It is an interpretation especially appropriate because of deism's influence upon lay communities through the establishment of societies, meeting-houses, periodi- cals. Philosophers, however, will doubtless be more interested in several deists whose views would be known today, except for, Mr. Koch's careful study of them, hardly at all. The most active of these was the blind and impoverished Elihu Palmer, who, devoting most of his life to attack upon orthodox religions and exposition of his own radical one, became truly a martyr to the movement. Palmer accepts belief in one supreme deity, but his emphasis is all upon the ra- tionality of man. He attributes immorality to ignorance and corrupt institu- tions, the removal of which will result, with the help of education, in a democrat- ic millennium. Mr. Koch gives a chapter also to the revolutionist, Ethan Allen: his adventures in freethinking were devoted principally to what has been said to be the first formal attack in America upon Christianity. But Allen, too, has a positive philosophy treating of God, freedom, immortality, and centering about man's moral rectitude as harmonious with the laws of nature. Probably the most original of these deists, as the author presents them, is John Stewart. A, world-traveler, Stewart came to appreciate the similarities of various great religions; and he developed, besides tremendous conceit, a cosmopolitan and rationalistic point of view quite extraordinary for such a time and place as colonial America. More explicitly than his fellow-liberals, he finds human per- fectibility in individual rather than social experience. "Self is God," says Stew- art, and he proceeds to systematize his ideas into a kind of oriental material- ism which is at times rather beautiful as well as sage.</page><page sequence="6">282 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS Paine, Franklin, and Jefferson are discussed briefly where their activities overlap with the precise movement Mr. Koch wishes to study. Also described are several "respectable deists," among whom Ebenezer Gay and William Bent- ley may strike the reader as having the most unusual religio-philosophic ideas. Mr. Koch writes with a sense of the dramatic, and a touch of humor. THEODORE B. BRAMELD THE THREE ESTATES IN MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE LITERATURE. By Ruth Mohl. ("Columbia University Studies in English and Comparative Litera- ture.") New York: Columbia University Press, I933. Pp. xi+425. $4.50. To the subject of the relations between political theory and literature, which has recently begun to attract attention, Miss Mohl has made a useful contribu- tion. She has collected and analyzed the treatments of the structure of society in medieval and early modern literature. After giving historical descriptions of the works on this subject in the continental languages and English, the author dis- cusses the literary devices employed and the philosophy of politics reflected in these writings. Teachings on the origin of the estates and their various charac- teristics are explained, and the thinking on the subject of the duties and faults of each class is set forth at length. Though Miss Mohl has included in her treat- ment many works which divide society into more estates than three, the volume has gained rather than suffered by this somewhat illogical procedure. It should serve to remind the reader that, in spite of the title, the medieval concept of social organization was not a wholly uniform one. M. M. KNAPPEN POLITICA METHODICE DIGESTA. By Johannes Althusius. Edited with an In- troduction by Carl Joachim Friedrich. ("Harvard Political Classics," Vol. II.) Cambridge: Harvard University Press, I932. Pp. cxxxix+435. $6.oo. Professor Friedrich has given us a very thorough treatment of the Politica of John Althaus, or Althusius, the German legal scholar of the early seventeenth century. With the exception of a few redundant and unimportant passages the entire text of the third and most complete edition is set forth, and twenty-one hitherto unpublished letters of the author are also included in the volume. The Introduction covers the life, literary background, and fundamental ideas of the theorist. The great Gierke considered Althusius of outstanding importance for the development of the theory of natural rights, but saw in his state only a network of private contractual obligations. In his Introduction the editor corrects these errors. He freely admits that the work is more important as a systematic presen- tation of the contemporary Calvinistic burgher political theory than for the originality of its ideas. He also points out that the fundamental concept of Althusius is not that of contract, but the idea of the "symbiotic" structure of society, which sees in it an association of organic groups combining in the great- er whole. The wisdom of the editor's accepting so whole-heartedly Weber's thesis on the relationship of Calvinism to capitalism may be doubted, but that is a minor point in a fine piece of work. M. M.

VERGILIUS FERM LINGUISTIc ANALYSIS OF MATHEMATICS. By Arthur F. Bentley. Bloomington: Principia Press, Inc., 1932. Pp. 3I5. A mathematician attempts to purify the language of mathematics and the system of language in which mathematics is embedded by the application of the principle of consistency. This principle, which is essentially opposed to the prin- ciple of everyday language (viz., the principle of "pointing"), enables one to re- ject the implicit and explicit realisms associated with the notion of the infinite, mathematical unity, the null class, etc. A. C. BENJAMIN STRAIGHT AND CROOKED THINKING. By R. H. Thouless. New York: Simon and Schuster, I932. Pp. 26i. $2.00. The author of this little study in fallacies is director of the department of psychology in Glasgow University. The book is addressed to "all who have ever muffed an argument, committed fallacies, succumbed to vagueness, trotted out prejudices, crawled along ruts, or fallen into tabloid thinking," and it makes good supplementary reading for the first fortnight of an elementary logic course. The chapters on tricks of suggestion, tabloid thinking, pitfalls in analogy, vagueness and prejudice, etc, contain considerable plausible material. To cap these, the author has added two Appendices. The first is a description of thirty- four "tricks whereby men are misled in argument," which beats the chapter on fallacies in most logic texts. The second is a rather realistic conversation be- tween a business man, a professor, and a clergyman on current topics, in the course of which the said "tricks" are shown in action. There is something of a reproach to the writers of logic texts in the fact that this sort of thing should be done by psychologists: although the study of fallacies is admittedly a minor and introductory phase of logic, there is every reason for insisting that it is a phase of logic, and for making a respectable job of it. ALBUREY CASTELL SEX LIFE AND SEX ETHICS. By Rene Guyon. Translated by J. C. and S. Flugel. London: John Lane, I933. PP. 386. I5s. net. A notice is prefixed to the title-page of this book to the effect that its "sale is strictly limited to members of the medical profession, psycho-analysts and such</page><page sequence="8">284 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS adults as may have a definite position in the field of physiological, psychological or social research." This limitation may be necessary because of some obsolete legal provisions, but it is difficult to see how such a book could do any harm to anyone who was not half-witted. The argument of the author is important for a reconsideration of certain traditional conceptions in ethics. He makes use of Freud's analysis, but he is aware that the difficulties Freud discovered in pa- tients may be due less to the defects of those patients than to defects in the social conventions to which they have to adhere. Much of the book is concerned with physiological analysis of the two very different aspects of the sex impulse- the pleasure-seeking aspect and that concerned with reproduction. Taboo and certain existing forms of disgust or distaste are analyzed, and their sources traced. The moral problems involved are referred to; but the author does not seem to give enough weight to the social grounds, in actual experience, for certain conventions and "controls." It may be true, as he says, that the traditional conventions are becoming obsolete and ineffectual. But it would not follow, as he seems to imply, that all conventions are unnatural or artificial. Some con- ventions are natural to society and the life of man in society. The value of the book, however, is in the analysis of facts which it provides. The philosophical problem of the "values" aimed at in any structure of custom would have to take account of such facts; and probably most ethical theories are still unconsciously affected by obsolete psychology. Naturally all books dealing with the sex im- pulse have the tone of a protest or a grievance. The fear of plain speaking on such subjects still prevents even philosophers from looking at the facts. But clearly the obscurantism of our tradition does not justify a complete disregard of reticence-and M. Guyon's book, although candid, does not seem likely to be too disturbing for educated readers! C. D. B. SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS AND ITS TREATMENT. By A. A. Roback. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Sci-Art Publishers, I933. Pp. I22. $I.50. The publishers announce on the jacket that this is the first scientific book on self-consciousness. (Publishers seem unaffected by the topic at hand.) It is, rather, a theoretical and popular discussion by one who confesses intense experi- ences of embarrassment and who has been trying to understand the psychologi- cal mechanisms involved in terms of conflicting psychological theories and who has had clinical experience in dealing with its cure both in himself and in others. It is the kind of book that will be read through: for in it the reader will see himself as in a mirror. Let me merely suggest the contents: there is a dearth of treatment of this subject by competent psychologists; questionnaires show that 37 per cent of folk in a university extension class confessed to self-consciousness as a handicap; there are varieties of self-consciousness; it is a condition of mind peculiar to imaginative persons; the introvert is more susceptible; some of the world's greatest geniuses have been bothered by extreme bashfulness; there is a stratifi- cation of causes, some constitutional, some environmental, some long-term con-</page><page sequence="9">BOOK REVIEWS 285 ditionings and some momentary; when ambition is high and achievement low self-consciousness appears as lack of self-confidence; if one had faith in one's message one would tend to overcome the malady; Coue's emphasis upon imagi- nation as a cure is not as effective as the deliberate attempt of the will; the in- trovert must, at his own inconvenience, take the bull by the horns and mix with others; the handicaps of self-consciousness in daily life are enormous and should become a part of professional vocational study. VERGILIUS FERM LIVING ISSUES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT. By C. A. Anderson Scott. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press; New York: Macmillan Co., I933. Pp. Xii+I92. $I.75. There ought to be some way in which it could be required of ultra-conserva- tive, traditionally-minded Christian leaders to read certain books. This book would be on the required reading list. I am thinking particularly of such groups as make much of the theology of Paul and certain typical theories as to his teach- ing. They will be shocked to learn from a carefully worked-out thesis in this book that there is no good reason for supposing that Paul held the substitution- ary or expiatory theory of the atonement; that the curious fact is that the word "atonement" does not occur in any of Paul's epistles (nor in the New Testament at all); that the Pauline use of the term "sacrifice" throws no light upon the character of that sacrifice; that linking Paul to the Levitical system-thus ex- plaining by analogy the Pauline interpretation of reconciliation-is highly eise- getical; that Paul's reference to "blood" is rather a testimony to an acquaintance with Jesus' death and the circumstances surrounding it by one who was a con- temporary, than an inferential reference to the Levitical practice of blood-sacri- fice; that theology under the influence of Augustine, Luther, and Calvin has given a mistaken conception of Paul's theory of salvation by its undue emphasis upon the doctrine of justification. An exceedingly fine chapter is given over to the mystical factor in the Pauline doctrine of salvation, in which discussion the term "mysticism" is carefully defined. The mysticism involved is not that of a method; it is a result-a relationship of personalities independent of physical contact. There are several usages of the term "faith" in Paul (rarely is it used to mean belief in a proposition or a fact); mystical union is for Paul the necessary condition of the experience of salvation. The author goes on to speak of the riddle of the Fourth Gospel and renders an estimate of Christ that is glowing and fresh; any intellectual appraisal is secondary to a personal appeal. I am surprised to find no reference to F. C. Porter's scholarly volume, The Mind of Christ in Paul, which covers some of the same material as is covered in the early chapters where other references are given. The ethical teachings of Jesus are summed up by the author as follows: "Do not stand on your rights" and "Do more than your duties." The substance of the book was first presented as lectures before groups at the University of London, at Oxford, and at Aberdeen. VERGILIUS FERM</page><page sequence="10">286 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS CHRISTIANITY AND PHILOSOPHY. By D. Miall Edwards. Edinburgh: T. and T. Clark, I932; New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, I933. Pp. xv+367. $3.00. Simmered down to the pith, this book presents a philosophical apologetic for Christian theism. One senses the conclusion very near the beginning. The first part is given over to a metaphysics of reality in which an idealism akin to the theistic pluralism of James Ward is defended against the background of a criti- cal discussion of other idealistic systems and of philosophical naturalism. Cer- tain expository sections read like an introductory text in philosophy; other sec- tions relating to religious philosophy and theology presuppose a fairly wide acquaintance with relevant literature. The concluding chapters, on Christology and on the doctrine of the Trinity, are so detailed in their treatment, both his- torically and critically, that one entertains the suspicion that they are papers prepared for a theological society and printed here as a publication opportunity rather than as integral sections of a book which patently aspires to be an intro- ductory text in the philosophy of the Christian religion. However, in fairness to the author we recall his thesis, which to some degree may allay such suspicion- since it is maintained that Jesus is revelatory of God, since a Christology be- comes the illuminating factor in theology, and since theology and religion are integral parts of metaphysics (defended earlier in the book), and hence a Chris- tology is important for metaphysics, the author may feel justified in giving de- tailed examination to traditional theories as to the nature of Christ and as to the nature and function of a trinitarian God. I find nothing in this book that is especially original. The author shows throughout his dependence upon authorities; the discussion moves on the plane of sorting this idea and that man from other ideas and other men; a conserva- tive, "middle-of-the-road" viewpoint is hewn out. The result is that we have a text on Christian religious philosophy which might well be acceptable and even welcome to any conservative (though non-fundamentalistic) denominational college or seminary. The above is set down as in no way disparaging, but as a descriptive characterization of the general viewpoint and tenor of the whole treatment. Idealism is defined as being realistic enough to permit the existence of a non- mental world; but this world is dependent fundamentally upon a reality which is spiritual and which is (whatever more) at least personal. The principle of "the higher anthropomorphism" is employed, by which is meant that whatever the world is, it is at least as much fundamentally as its highest expressions: hence a personalistic idealism, hence an anthropomorphism elevated by a Christomor- phism; hence theism; hence a metaphysics touched by a Christological theology. Rudolph Otto is made out to hold the key interpretation as to the nature of the religious experience, though the author would revise his interpretation some- what. There are four primary value experiences which are revelatory of the nature of reality: the good, the true, the beautiful, and the holy, the latter being a compound which includes, unifies, permeates, and conserves all the other val- ues of life and which is the very heart of religious feeling. The category of the holy is the value of values and marks not only the characteristic feature of the</page><page sequence="11">BOOK REVIEWS 287 religious response but furnishes the peculiar contribution of religion to philos- ophy and metaphysics. The experience of the holy always leaves an element of mystery; we can never overcome that. There is mystery about the doctrine of the Trinity which has not been adequately described by patristic and medieval theologians with their nicely woven (and now outworn) metaphysics. Even a Christology will not be without elements of mystery to the religious mind. There is mystery in the face of evil and the problem remains unsolved. God's self- limitation and high purposes are the best apologetic for a theodicy. Barthianism conflicts with a healthy-minded type of religion with its emphasis upon man's impotence and deity's transcendence. Both immanence and transcendence char- acterize a satisfactory theology. Reality is both one and many; the world is an organism, a teleological whole. There is a hierarchy of grades: God is not a nisus but the creator, sustainer, director. VERGILIUS FERM RELIGION TODAY. Edited by A. L. Swift, Jr. New York: Whittlesey House, I933. Pp. xvi+300. $2.50. In the form of popular address some fourteen individuals of different persua- sions and households here give their estimate of religion as a "challenging" (an abominable word) enigma today. Morris Cohen is the Bertrand Russell of the group; his chapter is easily the most conspicuous essay of the whole lot. The human horrors involved in religious history are laid bare to convince the lay reader that a defensible morality is no necessary implication of the religious spirit. The dark side of religion needs to come to literary light and there are plenty of data to set it forth. Charles Ferguson of Confusion of Tongues fame writes in his usual brilliant style of some modern religious isms. John A. Ryan asserts that political democracy is not the direct outcome of Protestantism; there is some ground for believing that the Declaration of Independence may have been influenced by certain Catholic writers. Catholicism has no official political theory or political polity (it is maintained); Catholicism deals with fundamental ends rather than expedient means. G. G. Atkins presents an ap- praisal of living religions. Psychical research and kindred themes are defended by Hornell Hart. The editor, A. L. Swift, summarizes the various well-known views on primitive religion and presents the sociological picture of religion. He defends its institutional expression. And so does Bishop McConnell (in a very sane way). Niebuhr contrasts proletarian and middle-class religions, with characteristic Niebuhrian doctrines cropping out as by-products of the con- trast. John Haynes Holmes dogmatizes about the future of religion in an essay which I recall having read somewhere before. And their are other essays. VERGILIUS FERM WHAT CAN WE BELIEVE? By James G. Gilkey. New York: Macmillan Co., I933. Pp. xi+ i64. $I.50. Should a sincere skeptic of the lay class desire to overcome his skepticism by a kind of faith that would meet genuine difficulties he will gain little help from a</page><page sequence="12">288 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS preacher who knows little about such skepticism. The two are too far part. The author of this short volume (minister in a Springfield, Massachusetts, Congre- gational church) plainly shows that he knows skepticism from the inside; his hand seems reached out in this book-and with refreshing sincerity-to those who would like to march in the direction in which Christian faith is said to be moving, without shocking their intellectual sensibilities at all. The result is what he calls the faith of the New Protestantism-a faith that is quite incom- parable with the glamour of the Protestant theological systems but which con- tains enough of fundamentals to warrant (as he claims) the classification of Christian. It would not be difficult to believe in the kind of God he presents; nor to concede the reasonableness of the theory of human suffering offered; nor to believe in the efficacy of prayer as inner change motivated by psychological laws grounded in a Someone-Else; nor to pay homage to the Unitarian Jesus. The title of the book is no misnomer. VERGILIUS FERM INTRODUCTION TO RELIGIOUS EDUCATION. Edited by J. M. Price. New York: Macmillan Co., I932. Pp. xi+489. $2.25. Of composite authorship, this college text is what it says: plain enough to be understandable (frequently too elementary for college grade) and comprehensive enough to cover the field. Acquaintance with relevant literature is abundantly in evidence; the whole treatment is marked by the announced motive to "send the individual back to his church to give his very best as a volunteer or voca- tional worker." Sponsors of the book are Southern Baptist teachers of bible and religious education; conservative and uncritical utterances in theological matters abound; the Bible is quoted in proof-text fashion, often quite indiscriminately. The section heads are often quite arbitrary and unbecoming (if not amusing). The book undoubtedly is useful to groups who would like to move forward with certain recent educational and psychological dicta without bringing disturbance to theological ideas and the ecclesiastical cultus. VERGILIUS FERM THE CAREER AND SIGNIFICANCE OF JESUS. By W. B. Denny. New York: Thomas Nelson &amp; Sons, I933. PP. XV+466. Frankly, I do not find in this outline of the life of Jesus and interpretation of the meaning of Christianity anything that is particularly commendable; much of the material is puerile. The book might serve a hoi polloi bible class, though I am sure the reading list appended to each sketchy chapter is quite beyond the reach of those to whom the text is leveled. Some statements reveal a lack of philosophical discrimination; there seems to be insufficient grasp of fundamental ideas in religious philosophy. The whole thing is quite amateurish; there is much religious romanticizing. VERGILIUS FERM</page></plain_text>
