<plain_text><page sequence="1">690810 The Abbreviated and the Comprehensive Research Injury Scales John D. States School of Medicine and Dentistry, University of Rochester SINCE 1943 accident investigation has been a research tool for vehicle design. Cornell Medicài School, through the work of Hugh DeHaven, organized research-oriented air- plane and automobile accident investigation teams and developed the first injury scale. In the past six years ap- proximately 12 medical engineering research teams have been established. Early in 1968 the U.S. Department of Transportation accelerated this effort by funding and train- ing research teams from five university centers, and most recently the American Medical Association Committee on Medical Aspects of Automobile Safety has taken steps to establish and indoctrinate 75 physician-police teams. The initial and primary purpose of research accident investigation has been the collection of data on injury causation. The data are being.used to improve vehicle collision performance and occupant packaging, to reduce or prevent injury. Such data identify injury-producing parts of the vehicle and is the initial step in determining human tolerances to injury. There has been and remains an urgent need for data on human tolerance to injury. Comprehensive medical engineering accident analyses have proved to be one of the most effective and reliable means of obtaining these data. Laboratory research using animals, cadavers, anthropomorphic dummies and human volunteers is furnishing similar data, but such data must be verified by accident investigation data. The uniformity of data collection is essential for the statistical treatment of data collected by different research teams. Several teams are needed to collect enough cases for statistically significant samples. A means of scaling injuries is essential to permit comparison of accident in- juries. Meaningful statistical treatment is impossible with- out uniform data collection. USES FOR INJURY SCALE An injury scale is an essential analytical tool for com- parison of injury and injury severity. A broadly based widely accepted scale will have many uses among which are the following: ABSTRACT A widely accepted injury scale is urgently needed by medical engineering automotive accident investigation teams. An informal committee of physicians, engineers and other researchers has developed two scales. The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) combines and details several existing scales including the DeHaven -Cornell scale, the commonly used police scale, and others, Injuries which are usually not fatal are rated with a 1 to 5 scale. Several scaling criteria were combined but with varying weights to establish the AIS rankings. The Comprehensive Research Injury Scale (CRIS) was developed to separate the criteria used in injury scaling. Five separate criteria are used: Energy Dissipation (ED), Threat- To- Life (TL), Permanent Impairment (PI), Treat- ment Period (TP), and Incidence (IN). The ED scale ranks energy dissipation in injury production, and will be of major value to vehicle designers concerned with human tolerance for injury. TL and PI, in part, scale the economic effects of the injury. Anthropometric measurements easily determined by physicians are included in the AIS. Weight, height, total leg length, and tibial length are recorded. From this data, sitting height, knee height, and hip-to-knee distances may be determined. 2625</page><page sequence="2">2626 JOHN D.

PAST EFFORTS AND PRESENT STATUS Hugh DeHaven with members of the Cornell Medical School faculty developed the first research injury scale (1).* This scale has been widely accepted, but in recent years has been modified by other descriptive teams, "minor, moderate, severe, life threatening, and fatal," which are used similarly in most other scales. In 1968 Ryan and Garrett of Cornell Aeronautical Lab. (5) updated and detailed the Cornell Scale. Through a careful review of the literature force values for injury thresh- olds of various tissues and parts of the human body were presented. Disability and "ťhreat-to-life" were also ranked for various injuries. Lange and Van Kirk of Wayne State University (6) devel- oped an injury scale which was weighted according to energy dissipation and "threat-to-life." A complementary vehicle damage scale is also under development by these authors. Mackay, of Road Research Lab., Birmingham (7) has developed a somewhat similar, but more detailed, scale which he has applied to over 700 road accidents. Campbell, of Traffic Injury Research Foundation, Ottawa (8) has developed an entirely new approach utilizing a com- puterized form which anatomically locates the injury as well as detailing the severity of the injury. Scaling is in part dependent on the nature of the injured tissue and the sensitivity of the tissue to mechanical injury. General Motors Corp. has developed a scale similar to Cornell's which also has units permitting direct comparison to existing police scales. The GM scale is being used by company accident investigation teams. CLINICAL SCALES Beginning with the Korean War, several clinical scales have been developed by physicians to determine the condi- tion of patients, particularly with regard to surgical shock. A scale published by the Surgical Research Team of the U.S. Army (9) in 1956 assigned points for various types of injuries, for surgical procedures which were necessary be- cause of the injuries, for the duration of time after the in- jury, and for the number of units of blood, plasma or albu- min needed to resuscitate the patient. These were summated ^Numbers in parentheses designate References at end of paper. indicating the severity of the patient's injuries and his suscep- tibility to further surgical shock. The "APGAR" Scale for evaluating newborn infants, the "Yale Index of Injury Severity" (10) and the "Neurosurgical Watch" developed by Bouzarth (11) are all scaling methods utilizing clinical signs such as consciousness, objective reaction to pain, hemorrhage, pulse rate, respiration rate, and skin color. Various points are assigned to each and a total score determined. The score indicates the patient's condition at the time of evaluation. These ratings change as the patient responds to treatment. The clinic's evaluation scales are relatviely sensitive in- dicators of the depth of a patient's surgical shock. Such scales also quantitate the patient's response or failure to respond to treatment. However, the scales do not reflect the patient's condition immediately following injury. In- stead, these scales reflect the effects of the injury and the patient's response to the injury and to treatment given him. Since our primary interest is in the injury itself, and not in the response of the patient to treatment, such scales are not suitable for determination of human tolerances or the other needs of research accident investigators. AD HOC INJURY SCALING COMMITTEE In January 1968, investigators in accident research met in Detroit and established an Ad Hoc Committee on Vehicle and Injury Scaling. The American Medical Association, the Automobile Manufacturers Association and SAE gave support and encouragement to the activities of this com- mittee. Arnold Siegel became overall Chairman; the author became Chairman of the Injury Scaling Committee. SCALE DEVELOPMENT - The Injury Scaling Committee met in October 1968, and in January, May, and June 1969. All of the domestic automobile manufacturers, nearly all of the university based research teams, and several European research teams, were represented at these meetings. In January 1969, the Abbreviated Injury Scale -- (AIS) (see Appendix) was tentatively adopted. The AIS is based upon the Cornell Scale, the General Motors Scale, and others using the descriptive terms "minor, moderate, severe, life threatening, and fatal." The scale is intended for use by nonphysicians and physicians and is simple enough to permit rapid scaling of many cases. The scaling values represent a compromise between energy absorption by injury and "threat-to-life" criteria. No effort was made to consider permanent injury criteria. Individual injuries are rated separately and, in addition, an overall rating is assigned. Injuries are also listed on a dia- gram of the human body to permit rapid assimilation of in- dividual cases by observers. COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH INJURY SCALE (CRIS) - Al- though the AIS goes beyond the present state-of-the-art in injury scaling, the need for a more detailed scale became quickly obvious. The most troublesome deficiency of the AIS is the inability to separate and identify the various criteria used in scaling. Vehicle design engineers are</page><page sequence="3">COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH INJURY SCALES 2627 primarily interested in the human tolerance for injury, the energy dissipated in producing an injury. In contrast physi- cians, who most often scale injuries, seldom separate energy dissipation from threat-to-life and disability caused by an injury. Furthermore, the weight given each of these criteria varies significantly from one diagnosis to another. The CRIS has been developed to isolate scaling criteria. Diagnoses are scaled separately using five different criteria. Treatment Period (TP), and Incidence (IN), are scaled in addition to Energy Dissipation (ED), Threat-To^Life (TL), and Permanent Impairment (PI). The term impairment is used to denote the objective physical changes which result from an injury in contrast to the term disability which im- plies the socioeconomic effects of an injury. A roster of physicians, engineers, and others who have conducted research in accident investigation or have an interest in injury scaling, was developed. The roster was divided into medical specialty subcommittees; the entire group convened in Detroit on May 16 and 17, 1969. The medical and engineering professions were equally repre- sented. The following medical specialty Subcommittees were established: General Surgery, Plastic Surgery, Neurosurgery, Cardiology, Thoracic Surgery, Orthopaedic Surgery, Oto- laryngology, Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Ophthalmology. METHODOLOGY AND SCALING CRITERIA - Five separate criteria were used to scale injuries commonly occurring in automobile accidents. The AIS Scale is a relatively crude scaling of injuries using primarily "energy dissipation" and "threat- to- life" criteria. Certain criteria are given far more weight in scaling particular injuries than others; that is, an eye injury may be caused by very little energy but the injury will cause severe permanent disability. In contrast, tension fracture of the lumbar spine, caused by jackknifing over a lap belt, dissipates a large amount of energy but causes only a moderate disability. A ruptured spleen re- quires a moderately large amount of energy and is a very serious threat to life but causes virtually no permanent disability. The five criteria are as follows: 1. Energy Dissipation (ED) . 2. Threat-to-Life (TL). 3. Permanent Impairment (PI) . 4. Treatment Period (TP). 5. Incidence (IN) . Energy Dissipation (ED) - The ED Scale is used to rank injuries by the amount of energy dissipated in the produc- tion of the injury. In a few instances the actual quantity of energy needed to produce a given injury is known. Garrett and Ryan (5) searched the iiterature and discovered several "bench marks" which are absolute values for the energy dissipation scales. Most scale determinations were based on the clinical judgments trf the medical specialty subcommittee members. Most important was the ranking of the various injuries. The subcommittees ranked injuries by consensus of their clinical judgments. For instance, the orthopedic surgeons deter- mined the relative amount of energy required to fracture a clavicle versus the radius and ulna in the forearm. Many judgments and compromises were necessary to establish the rankings. Threat-to-Life Scale (TL) - The TL Scale is an effort to identify those injuries which result in loss of life. TL rank- ings are based almost entirely on clinical judgment. The TL Scale reflects present-day treatment ability of medical facilities. Hopefully, in the future, this scale will change downward as treatment capability improves. Permanent Impairment Scale (PI) - The PI Scale is also an identification scale to determine injuries which fre- quently result in permanent impairment or disability. The scaling was based on the average permanent disability pro- duced by a given diagnosis. Individual variation was con- siderable, but averages have been used for many years by insurance companies and compensation carriers. Treatment Period Scale (TP) - An effort to quantitate the treatment period has been undertaken in this criteria. This, in addition to PI Scale, will further reflect the economic effects of the accident. The Treatment Period represents that period during which time the patient is unable to work. In some ways it also reflects the expense of a given injury because in most instances it approximates the period of medical care. Incidence Scale (IN) - Subcommittee members were asked to estimate the relative incidence of given diagnoses. The estimates are based on personal experience as well as known statistical studies of automobile accident injuries. Whenever possible, hard data are used. Such data are not available for all diagnoses and estimates were necessary to scale many diagnoses. NUMERICAL SCALING - Each diagnosis was ranked using 1-5 scale. Descriptive terms were given each unit in each criteria. The terms differed somewhat among criteria, but a 3 in one criteria approximated a 3 in a different criteria. The descriptive terms were applied to give meaning to the numerical designation. FATALITIES - A fatality was not given a specific rating and was not used as a scaling unit because of the extreme variations in the susceptibility of organs to injury and of patient response to injury. Furthermore, medical complications following injury are sometimes responsible for the fatality rather than the injury itself. A total of 9 units have been made available for scaling. The units from 6 to 9 are reserved for fatal injuries and are necessary to reflect various degrees of fatalness. A 6 de- notes that a patient received an injury which is usually fatal, but is an isolated injury. A higher ranking number is assigned when a patient receives multiple fatal injuries. A higher ranking number also denotes extremely severe single injuries such as a crushed chest. Quantitations of fatal in- juries are necessary only for the ED criteria. AGE EFFECT - Among orthopedic injuries significant variation exists between patients of different age with respect to energy dissipation, permanent impairment, and treatment period. Specific correction factors were deter-</page><page sequence="4">2628 JOHN D. STATES mined for the diagnoses when a major variation from the average existed. An example is fracture of the tibial shaft. Such a fracture in an adult or elderly patient requires at least 4 months in a cast and disables the patient for 4-6 months. In contrast, the identical fracture in a child under the age of 12 requires only 6 weeks for healing, and walking, in the cast is nearly always possible. Furthermore, complications rarely occur in children but occur in 15&lt;7o of adults with fractured tibias. Such compli- cations prolong the disability period to 1-3 years. ANTHROPOMETRY - Weight, height, and particularly sitting height and the upper and lower leg lengths of injured occupants must be known to establish the significance of their injuries. An example is knee injuries caused by dash- board contact of restrained occupants in head-on collisions. Short occupants should not sustain knee injuries under these circumstances but tall occupants may be injured be- cause their knees are closer to the dashboard. Clinical experience and limited anthropomorphic studies reveal significant variation in leg lengths related to overall and sitting heights. Empirical formulas relating sitting height and upper and lower leg lengths to overall height are not reliable for the individual occupant. In an effort to obtain more anthropomorphic data, two simple leg length measurements frequently obtained by orthopedic surgeons have been included in the AIS. The distance from the apex of the anterior superior iliac spine of ťhe pelvis to the tip of the medial malleolus of the ankle and the distance from the joint line (tibial plateau) of the knee to the medial malleolus will be included in the AIS. From these data and the overall height: sitting height, knee height, and thigh length may be determined with more ac- curacy. To actually make these determinations, assumptions have to be made for the vertical distances between the medial malleolus and the floor with the patient standing and be- tween the anterior superior iliac spine and the "H" point. Such assumptions have not been statistically developed, but hopefully will be available in the near future. CONCLUSIONS DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN TOLERANCE DATA - Lab- oratory studies using cadaver or animal material have been the principal source of human tolerance data. Animal studies are obviously not directly comparable to the human being because of major differences in anatomy. Human material when used in the laboratory is nearly always c ad avei material with the exceptions of volunteer studies of certain minor injuries. Such research has major shortcomings. MEDICAL - Engineering accident investigation utilizes the human being as an accelerometer. Careful recordings of damage to vehicle interiors produced by occupant contact are now being done by many research teams. Later, identi- cal damage can be reproduced to an undamaged vehicle part in the laboratory during which accurate energy dissipa- tion measurements are made. In this way injury-producing energy in the actual accident situation can be determined. Such techniques have been developed by Swearingen (12) and Patrick (13). Such research is of extreme value because of its close relationship to the actual clinical situation which caused the injury - the automobile accident. From such data injury scaling will make possible accurate estimates of energy dissipation for all other injuries. REFERENCES 1. H.

If there are more than one serious or major injuries, they may be so indicated by using more than one asterisk. 4. The overall AIS rating is a clinical estimate of the severity of all of the injuries as related to the whole patient. 5. Leg length is the distance from the anterior superior iliac spine to the distal end of the medial malleolus. Tibial length is the distance from the joint line of the knee to the distal end of the medial malleolus. Where there is a significant discrepancy in leg length it should be recorded. If the discrepancy is less than 2 cm or 3/4 in. the difference can be disregarded. 6. Laceration length should be recorded with the diag- noses. 7. Major medical impairments are conditions, either diseases or injuries with permanent residual which have a significant effect on the ability of the patient to recover from injury, which impairs his ability to drive. Examples of such conditions are diabetes, past cerebro-vascular acci- dents or malunited fractures of the lower extremity. COMMENTS: The AIS is based on three criteria; the energy dissipated in producing the injury, the threat -to -life of the injury for the patient and the permanent diability resulting from the injury. Energy dissipation and threat-to-life criteria should be the principal considerations used for determinations of the rating, but all three should be considered. The injury diagnosis list is not necessarily all inclusive, but should contain the major significant injuries. If there are several injuries as many should be listed as possible, beginning with the most severe. Anatomical locations of injuries and injury diagnoses are not coded in the AIS. If either is desired for specific purposes of a research study the Traffic Injury Research Foundation Anatomical Coding and the American Medical Association Current Medical Terminology Code are rec- ommended. These codes contain sufficient detail to make them useful and at the same time are reasonably simple.</page><page sequence="9">COMPREHENSIVE RESEARCH INJURY SCALES 2633 Table A -3 - Comprehensive Injury Scale Orthopedic Injuries Injury ED TL, AE* PI TP AE* IN Dislocated knee 4 3-1 Ch. 3 4 1 Dislocation of hip 5 2 +1 El. 3 5 2 Multiple fractures of foot 5 2 2 4 2 Seat belt fracture L5 5 3 1 3 1 Fracture femoral shaft, closed 4 3 +1 El. 1 4 -1 Ch. 3 -1 Ch.
