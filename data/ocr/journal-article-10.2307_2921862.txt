Through a critical examina- tion of Moorman's article as an interpretation of Pierre, however, it is perhaps possible to discover some inherent limitations of this tendency to approach fiction through imagery and myth. Mark Schorer has stated that the basic assumption of modern criticism with regard to fiction is "that whatever single element in a novel one may select for analysis, a novel in itself is an integra- tion of an attitude which the study of any single element will reveal."2 Schorer's assertion on behalf of modern critics that the examination of a single structural element will reveal the pattern of the whole is strongly reflected in Moorman's article. "Mel- ville's use of the imagery of the Fall of Man," he contends, "de- fines the structure, action, and theme of the novel."3 Seen from this perspective, Pierre is the "considered and systematic reworking of the myth of the Fall of Man and its attendant tradition of felix culpa.`4 Moorman begins his analysis by pointing out that Saddle Meadows, the scene of the opening sections of the novel, is de- scribed in terms which emphasize the idyllic, aristocratic, and gen- erally Edenlike aspects of Pierre's ancestral home. However, this earthly Paradise is, we are told, "shown by Melville to be danger- ously qualified and inadequate."5 The aristocratic structure of Saddle Meadows society is on the verge of being inundated by American democracy, the literary and religious traditions in which Pierre had been nurtured are equally unsound, and his romantic attachment to Lucy Tartan lacks vitality and its innocence is sus- pect. Moorman's conclusion, therefore, is that "to Pierre, Saddle Meadows is a Paradise; to Melville, it is a delusion."6 With the appearance of Isabel as the haunting face and later as an active character, Moorman discovers an intrusion of imagery alien to the Arcadian life at Saddle Meadows. The two most significant of these images are the snake symbolizing Pierre's fall, and the pine, 2 Critiques and Essays on Modern Fiction, 1920-I95I, ed.

Against the pine and Isabel, Moorman opposes the hemlock and Lucy, who, because she is described as "docile" (p. 2I),7 "nun-like" (p. 380), and lack- ing in "vulgar vigor" (p. 69), is equated with the sterility which Pierre's fall allows him, fortunately, to avoid. These are the prin- cipal constituents of the Fall myth as Moorman finds it in Pierre. The number of citations offered in evidence fills up a good many pages of his article, but many of his key interpretations are none- theless subject to serious question. For instance, what Moorman calls "this Isabel-life-fertility, Lucy-death-sterility dichotomy"8 and which is central to his felix culpa thesis seems an oversimplified view of the two women. It is Isabel who, far more than Lucy, is associated with death. Melville speaks of Isabel's "death-like beauty" (p. I32), she is "still as death" (p. I43), her form is "hair- shrouded" (p. I49, my italics), and when Pierre takes the poison concealed in her bosom he cries, "In thy breasts, life for infants lodgeth not, but death-milk for thee and me" (p. 425). Isabel's effect on Pierre is often enervating rather than fertilizing. Mel- ville calls it an "enchantment" (p. I48) and a "spell" (p. i68), and Pierre is "entranced" (p. I48), "enchanted," "bewitched," and "motionless" (p. I50). Isabel's long black hair, which Moorman associates with fertility,9 functions symbolically throughout the novel in ways hard to reconcile with that interpretation. Most often it is described as a "'veil,"'10 and in a passage which brings to mind Richard Chase's comment on Isabel's similarity to Medusa in figuratively turning the hero to stone1" Pierre says, "Truly, Isa- bel, thy all-abounding hair falls upon me with some spell" (p. I70). Moorman's association of Lucy with death and sterility is not less 7Herman Melville, Pierre, ed. Henry A. Murray.

I49) has been mentioned; it is also called a "curtain" (p. 139), and it "completely muffled the human figure" (p. 176). Moorman contends that the scenes in which Isabel's hair covers Pierre serve "to reinforce the fact of her fertility" (Moorman, p. 24); but if her hair is seen in its function as a veil or shadow, it seems rather to symbolize Pierre's increasing separation from life's conventional ties and concealment from human understanding. Thus halfway through the novel Isabel's hair "half concealed him" (p. 224), while the final words in the book are: "her long hair ran over him, and arbored him in ebon vines" (p. 427). "Richard Chase, Herman Melville (New York, 1949), p. 119.</page><page sequence="4">Notes and Queries 567 dubious. Chase's antithetical interpretation of Lucy as "the vivi- fying fire"12 seems more acceptable in view of Lucy's connection, in name and function, with light and her ministrations to Pierre near the end of the novel. Furthermore, the identification of Isabel with fertility and Lucy with sterility fails to recognize the fact that while Pierre's relation with his half sister is by its ambiguous nature necessarily nonproductive in a biological sense, his engagement to Lucy gave promise of what Mrs. Glendinning calls "the fair suc- cession of an honorable race" (p. 229). One could go on in this way, playing a kind of exegetical tick- tacktoe with Moorman's article,13 but that would fail to come to grips with more fundamental issues. For on the whole this inter- pretation of Pierre is less guilty of demonstrable error than it is of substituting for meaning that which is accessory to meaning. The presence in Pierre of imagery suggestive of the Fall can hardly be doubted, and it must readily be granted that imagery should be not only appropriate but contributory to the over-all structure of the novel. Does it follow, however, that because Pierre draws its imagery in part from the Fall of Man, the novel must necessarily constitute a systematic reworking of that myth? One could as safely assume that an overcoat tailored in Irish wool always turns out to be an ulster. The point I wish to make is that in assuming a source of imagery to be the source of structure, Mr. Moorman is referring the novel to an external design instead of attempting to discover the internal controls and the way in which they employ that design in the artistic whole. The result, of course, is that many elements must remain unassimilated by such analysis. If Pierre is Melville's version of the Fortunate Fall, although we do not expect exact correspondences, all elements of the novel ought to be explicable in terms of that theme. However, having traced the imagery through only the first half of Pierre, Moorman stops at that point with the statement that "Melville has set the stage in Books I-XII for a reworking of the felix cu/pa tradition." The 12ibid., p. i i 6. 13 I should quarrel, for example, with what seems a puzzling contradictory view of Saddle Meadows as a "corrupt and decadent" Garden which demonstrates "forceless innocence" (Moorman, p. 30). Evidence for Moorman's identification of the pine with the Tree of Life (Moorman, p. 23) is extremely tenuous; Melville's description of "ghostly pines . . . their grim arms . . . their horrid shadows" (p. 134) ought to warn against such arbitrary interpretations based on mythological symbolism without reference to the context.</page><page sequence="5">568 American Literature reader has been prepared for "a series of heroic ordeals which should end with Pierre's victory, transfiguration, and return to the world." The hard fact that the second half of the novel deals with neither victory nor transfiguration nor return and ends tragic- ally bothers Moorman less than it should. His reasoning on this score is that while Pierre himself sees his fall as fortunate, Melville has no delusions about felix culpa, and the novel's doleful outcome is simply what Moorman calls "Melville's attitude toward the prob- lem."14 Moorman's difficulty in trying to fit Pierre into the felix culpa framework illustrates how the mythical archetype can become a Procrustean bed upon which the particular work of art is hacked or stretched in order to conform to an external pattern. The vio- lence done Pierre in analyzing it in terms of what should happen to the hero and in relegating almost half the novel to the status of an author's aside is symptomatic of the inherent limitations of archetypal interpretation. Having pared a novel to the dimensions of the archetypal bed, we may discover that the marks of identity which made it unique and worth-while have been mutilated in the process. There are, however, insights in Moorman's investigation which could have led to illumination had he followed them rather than his felix culpa thesis. At one point he observes that after Pierre learns of Isabel's existence, the imagery used in describing his here- tofore idyllic life is reintroduced but in contexts of contrary em- phasis. The whiteness of Lucy's cheeks (p. 26) becomes the white- ness of Pierre's dying father's hand (p. 82); and the amaranth, which is associated both with Mrs. Glendinning's youthfulness (p. 3) and with Pierre's aunt's devotion to his father (p. 85), later becomes, as the destroyer of the homely catnip, a symbol of man's "ever-encroaching appetite for God" (p. 405). Moorman alludes to these and similar changes as indicating Pierre's "complete dis- illusionment with the purity and integrity of the Arcadian exist- ence."'5 However, because he interprets this disillusionment in terms of the Fall and its felix culpa adjunct rather than in relation to what is being dramatized in the narrative, Moorman fails to perceive 4 Moorman, Op. cit., p. 30. '51bid., p. 26.</page><page sequence="6">Notes and Queries 569 the full significance of this change in the imagery. The most traumatic aspect of Pierre's discovery of his half sister is probably the realization this knowledge brings him that his father (Pierre's anthropomorphic God image)16 is a seducer. Pierre is not con- fronted with the degeneration of character, with what was once good becoming bad, because his father is dead-hence beyond time, static. He faces, rather, the dilemma of reconciling two simul- taneous and conflicting images of the same absolute. Revealed as a perpetrator of vice, Pierre's father must nevertheless remain a "personification of perfect human goodness and virtue" (p. 79), for his death has placed his character beyond the reach of altera- tion. To Pierre, therefore, good does not change to evil, nor does that which falsely seems good stand exposed as evil as Moorman contends. Good is evil, or as Pierre says later in the novel, "Two shadows cast from one nothing; these, [it] seems to me, are Virtue and Vice" (p. 322). Thus Melville's use of the same image to describe both good and evil serves to reflect this terrible realization. Whiteness, which suggests the freshness and purity of Lucy, also describes the aged and guilty hands of Pierre's father as he lies in death. Similarly, the amaranth is used as an image of both eternal youth and loyalty on the one hand and of an unappeasable and tragic aspiration on the other. In this way the ambiguity of a single term symbolizes the ambiguity of truth itself which is, as its subtitle implies, the theme of the novel. It is my contention that, despite the importance of symbol, the basic structure of Pierre is essentially dramatic and that it is toward the tracing out of plot, in its most inclusive sense, that all ele- ments are arranged. This plot may be described as the course which moves Pierre toward disillusionment and from disillusion- ment to a search for truth in the name of good, which search leads progressively to the confounding of good and evil, because they are merely shadows of the same truth. Melville summarizes this plot when he writes: In those Hyperborean regions, to which enthusiastic Truth, and Earnestness, and Independence, will invariably lead a mind fitted by nature for profound and fearless thought, all objects are seen in a 16 "In this shrine . . . stood the perfect marble form of his departed father. ...

Viewed through that rarefied atmosphere the most immemorially admitted maxims of men begin to slide and fluctuate, and finally become wholly inverted; the very heavens themselves being not innocent of producing this confounding effect, since it is mostly in the heavens themselves that these wonderful mirages are exhibited (p. 194). In the first part of his novel Melville lays the groundwork for disillusionment. Pierre's confidence in the stability of his conven- tional morality is complete, but the author hints at approaching disaster, and Isabel's haunting gaze stirs Pierre's tranquillity. The result of the ensuing blow is to make Pierre a champion of truth who vows, "From all idols, I tear all veils; henceforth I will see the hidden things" (p. 76). This resolve determines the remain- der of the action, for as Pierre pursues truth he gets closer to that point at which good and evil lose all meaning. This trend first becomes evident as Pierre brilliantly analyzes his mother's proud nature and finds it ambiguous (pp. I04-I06). As an advocate of truth, Pierre's first duty is to acknowledge Isabel and forsake Lucy, which is outwardly an act of sacrificial virtue, for to Pierre it is a choice of "Lucy or God" (p. 2I3). The ambiguity of Pierre's relationship to his half sister, however, becomes increasingly ap- parent. Not only is it the cause of Mrs. Glendinning's death and Lucy's sorrow, but it is essentially incestuous. A point is reached in the relationship between Pierre and Isabel at which their servant Delly Ulver, who has been "penitentially seeking to be pure," feels she is "but the servant to a greater sin" (p. 378). Lucy and Isabel seem from the first opposed values with regard to Pierre-light and dark, innocence and experience-but when Lucy leaves Saddle Meadows to join Pierre and Isabel at the Apostles', we realize they symbolize opposite shadows of the same absolute, and they share equally in Pierre's tragic fate. There is even a kind of ambiguity in Lucy's selfless devotion, for her arrival in the city results in murder and suicide by bringing Pierre face to face with his foes. The revelation of Pierre's character is one of the major threads in this pattern of ambiguities. It seems a long step from the "heaven-begotten Christ" (p. I25) who is the savior of Isabel to the Promethean God-defier who murders his alter ego Glen Stanly. The quest for truth, however, cancels moral value, and</page><page sequence="8">Notes and Queries 57I in seeking that nothing which shadows forth both good and evil Pierre becomes "neuter" (p. 425). The union of the serpent and the dove depicted on Reverend Falsgrave's cameo brooch (p. I2I) is thus no less emblematic of Pierre's absolutism than it is of the relativism of the hypocritical clergyman. "The ambiguous proces- sion of events reveal their own ambiguousness" (p. 2I3). These observations are not intended to represent an analysis of this complex novel. It is, however, along such lines as these that one might proceed, explaining Melville's material by reference to the dramatic pattern. Moorman does not deny plot to Pierre, but his method-that of discovering whole by the scrutiny of part- cannot cope with a dynamic structure in which parts are modified by changes which the totality describes. All of which brings us back to the statement by Mark Schorer with which this article began. He gives a clue to the reason for Moorman's difficulty by defining the novel, on behalf of modern critics, as "an integration of an attitude." In other words, that which constitutes the struc- ture of a novel is "attitude." It is a term which implies a static rather than a dynamic pattern-a pattern of fixed relationships rather than causal sequences-and a unity based on essential simi- larities rather than mutual dependence. Remembering that modern criticism stems from the nature of modern fiction, one sees the close conformity of this emphasis on "attitude" to aspects of the so-called "plotless novel" in which what might be called "policy" (as opposed to plot) functions as the artistic control. Such a novel might well be described as the integration of an attitude, but the description does not apply to the more conventional dramatic struc- tures. The analysis of the plotless novel through the study of a single element can succeed, because attitude, the static organiza- tional principle, exists essentially the same in nature in a single part as in the entirety. The dynamic structure of a dramatic novel, as Moorman's inability to acount for the conclusion of Pierre illus- trates, is not susceptible to the same method of analysis, because process is the means through which relationships and meanings are revealed. When imagery, mythological allusions, or any such elements are detached from this process in which the plot involves them, it is no longer possible to assign to them the exact meanings they contain in terms of that plot.</page><page sequence="9">572 American Literature We are faced, therefore, with recognizing two basically dif- ferent fictional patterns-one static, one dynamic-and with the consequent necessity of employing a different approach to each. We have come to think of plot as a naive attempt to see order where there is none, yet that fact is more a measure of our own particular disillusionment than the reflection of an aesthetic abso- lute. To the critic who comes to terms with plot where he finds it, however, it is neither dross nor camouflage but a means of or- dering the elements of a novel into an articulate whole. The critic who remains contemptuous of the all-encompassing framework of plot stands in the same relationship to his task as the blind naturalist who, grasping an elephant by its tail, described that animal as a long, thin creature resembling a garden snake. Mr. Moorman has similarly described a lumbering, grotesque, but powerful novel by catching hold of one of its auxiliary appendages.</page></plain_text>
