I will pay specific atten- tion to the debates about the definitions of matter - primary, elemental, celestial - that Goulart extracted from classical myths and from Genesis in the alphabetical entries "Chaos," "Matter," and "Spirit" in his commen- tary on the "First Day" of Du Bartas's poem. For John Calvin, the term "histoire" or "histoires" refers to the narra- tive itself, which is distinct from the "doctrine" it illustrates and mediates.9 Calvinism defines the two types of narratives instantiated in classical myth 5 . . désirant rendre plus aisee la lecture de ceste Sepmaine à ceux qui n'ont pas encore attaint la cognoissance des difficultez qui s'y rencontrent en divers endroits, tant es mots qu'és matieres tirees de toutes sciences, &amp; deduites doctement: i'ay dressé en ceste edition plus correcte que nulles des precedentes, un argument general, des sommaires au com- mencement de chaque livre, des annotations en marge, &amp; sur tout un fort ample indice à la fin où i'esclaircy par ordre Alphabétique les choses qui pourroient retarder les moins exercez, ausquels principalement i'ay regardé en cela."

Myth epitomizes idolatry: it is a fictitious narrative that deifies nature. By contrast, Genesis illustrates divine accommodation: it is the true word of God that defines nature as divine works. Myth promotes esoteric knowledge for a happy few, whereas Genesis reasserts that the world and scripture are the books of the un- learned, accommodated to their understanding. Accommodation expresses divine incommensurability and the attempt at breaching it.10 Accommodation operates in the world and in scripture.11 Thus God created the world in ways designed to draw us from the spectacle of Creation to the praise of its Creator.12 In this first instance, accommoda- tion defines knowledge of nature as a hermeneutical process through which man deciphers divine agency in Creation - it justifies the natural theological project of "reading the book of nature."13 The second form of divine accommodation operates in scripture, where God condescends to "lisp . . . with us as nurses are accustomed to speak to infants."14 This second mean- ing of accommodation labels all descriptions of God in scripture as oblique and justifies biblical hermeneutics. These two forms of accommodation supplement each other. Because man's intellect has been dulled by the Fall, one needs the help of scripture to make sense of nature.15 A recurring Cal- vinist metaphor thus states that we need the spectacles of scripture to read the book of nature.16 Through accommodation, God has made sure that scripture would allow man's fallen understanding to grasp the meaning of nature. Laying bare the natural philosophy of scripture is thus the only way to "read" nature properly. The Calvinist language of accommodation and 10 On the signs of divine presence being also signs of divine incommensurability, see Jean Calvin, Institution de la religion chrestienne (Geneva: J.

Commenting on the phrase "the face of God" from Deu- teronomy 5:5, Goulart defines accommodation as the visual expression of the divine and the verbal mediation of such a vision by a prophet aiming at a specific rhetorical effect: both vision and verbal description are adjusted to the audience's capacity.18 We will see that the rhetorical outlook that characterized Calvinist her- meneutics grounded diverging natural-philosophical interpretations of scripture for Calvin and for Goulart. Goulart scrutinized the very fabric of "histoires" and interpreted the natural philosophy of classical myths and of Genesis by means of the same rhetorical structures, namely simili- tude and narrative order.19 These define the functioning of the mistaken idolatrous representation and of the true, "accommodated" one.20 By con- trast, Calvin emphasized the commonsensical obviousness of the natural- philosophical "doctrine" of scripture. Ultimately, and in good Calvinist fashion, Goulart's natural-philosophical interpretations of classical myths and of Genesis told his reader more about the limits of human knowledge than about nature itself. NATURAL-PHILOSOPHICAL INTERPRETATIONS OF CLASSICAL MYTH: DISMANTLING IDOLATRY Fable and Idolatry Glossing Du Bartas's reference to Latona, the mother of Apollo and Diana, Goulart recalls the story of Juno's wrath against her before concluding: 17 "Mais celuy qui la foy reçoit pour ses lunettes / Passe de part en part les cercles des Pianettes /[...] lit bien plus courant dans ces vieux documens." Du Bartas in Goulart, Commentaires , 14r. 18 "Ce fut une vision accommodee à la portee du peuple &amp; à l'intention du législateur parlant en Maiesté redoutable, &amp; dont nul n'a peu recueillir chose qui luy peust donner occasion de représenter Dieu en face d'homme." Simon Goulart, Meditation chrestienne sur les paroles du Seigneur (Geneva: P. Marceau, 1623), 109-11 (on Matthew 18:10). 19 On Calvin's rhetoric, see Francis Higman, The Style of John Calvin in His French Polemical Treatises (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1967); and Millet, Calvin. 20 Calvinists acknowledged this unbecoming likeness: Goulart's Meditation warns his reader against idolatrous, anthropomorphic misinterpretations of the scriptural phrase "the face of God." Goulart, Meditation , 111. The same move from definition of accom- modation to condemnation of idolatry occurs in Calvin, Institution , 1.13.1:39. 364</page><page sequence="5">Garrod ♦ Simon Goulart Some key such ridiculous and fabulous discourses, when applied to the Earth, onto natural Philosophy thus enfolded in fictions by Poets; and the first ones who became aware of this thought they would uphold the Sciences in greater authority by veiling them thus before the common sort. But Satan has made good use of this in a striking fashion among Pagans. Therefore they understand Latona to mean the earth, who is ordinarily hindered by Juno - who is air - from seeing Diana and Apollo in all their brightness: that is to say, the Sun and Moon who are called her children, because without her their heat and virtue would remain unprofit- able.21 Classical myths are dangerous fictions epitomizing made-up, esoteric knowledge. By hiding natural philosophy from the crowds, classical poets have contributed to the rise of hermetic sciences, which in turn have be- come the vehicle of evil. Reducing such fables to their original natural- philosophical content means making this content accessible to all by getting rid of their fictional attire, thus dismantling the idolatry to which it led: "The Ancient have called gods various effects of Nature, or of the stars, or of God Himself. Then, Greek and Latin Poets have confused and covered with diverse fables this natural philosophy so that the whole was progres- sively converted into the horrendous idolatry of Pagans."22 Unlike Calvin, who denounced Stoic and Epicurean philosophers because "they consider [nature] as the author of all things, and remove God out of sight,"23 Goulart does not insist on the fact that granting divine status to nature, that is, God's works, was already idolatrous. For Goulart, the problem of idolatry lay primarily in the making of fables, this messy concealment of truth. His understanding of classical myth borrowed, and yet remained distinct from, that of the mythographer Natale Conti.24 In his 1567 Mythologiae , Conti adopts a hermetic perspective to describe fabulated concealment as an early 21 Goulart, Commentaires , 13r-v. 22 "Les anciens ont appellé dieux divers effets de nature, ou des estoilles, ou de Dieu mesmes.

This concealment was intended to prevent anyone but a select few from investigating nature, lest it lead to impiety and moral corruption. Regarding Calvinist attitudes towards hermetism and hermeticism, Goulart served as a middle ground between Calvin's condemnation and Pierre de La Primaudaye's endorsement. Goulart did not refer to the corpus hermet- icum. He mentions Horappollo's Hieroglypbica and Bolzani's Hieroglypb- ica when commenting on Du Bartas's reference to hieroglyphics, but he does not gloss over these texts' hermetic and mystical undertones.25 As for Calvin, he condemned Plato, the Stoics, and the Egyptian "secret" theology for their idolatrous worship of nature.26 Similarly, Pierre Viret discarded the Platonic and Pythagorean philosophers in his Metamorphose chrestienne.17 However, the Huguenot Pierre de La Primaudaye, a member of Henri Ill's palace academy sympathetic to Platonism and hermeticism, praised Tris- megistus and stated that the Pimander adumbrated the truths of scripture. He also celebrated Plato for teaching the "sacred mysteries" of Creation under the (Pythagorean) veil of cosmic harmony.28 Goulart dismissed Conti's justification of the hermetic nature of fabulous ancient natural- philosophical wisdom. For Goulart, the fabulated concealment of natural- philosophical truth already denotes the corruption of knowledge into idolatry, whereas Conti blamed the corruption of this hermetic ancient wis- dom on the rise of the open method of philosophizing advocated by Plato and Aristotle. The keys for the proper interpretation of the original her- metic stories were then lost, and these stories became either pure fictions and folklore (Conti labels them "the useless fabrication of lying poets," "old women's trifles"),29 or the receptacle of shallow superstition in the 25 Goulart, Commentaires , 14r; Horapollo, H ori Apollinis selectae hieroglyphicae , ed.

Fables as Allegory: Similitude and Narrative Order Such extraction relies on the identification of the trope structuring the natu- ral philosophy into a fable. Conti calls this identification "allegory": "The stories that . . . poets like to use to decorate their poems . . . cover the generation of the elements, or the hidden things of nature, or the motion and power of the planets. Each one has a rather complex narrative struc- ture. Since it is our practice to extract the essential meaning from a story, we should give that interpretation a descriptive term of its own. At present there is no such term, unless we want to call it allegory."31 His definition fit perfectly Du Bartas's ornamental use of classical myths and their interpreta- tion by Goulart. The poet faced serious criticisms for his recourse to Pagan fables.32 Conti also emphasized the "complex narrative structure" of classi- cal myths, which played an important part in the allegorical decoding of their natural-philosophical content. Allegory is well defined in early modern rhetorical treatises. For Mel- anchthon, it is similar to a trope: it modifies the meaning of words. More precisely, it is an extended metaphor.33 A metaphor is a word that does not denote its proper referent but is applied to a similar one instead. Thus the "brood of vipers" in Matthew 12:34-35 does not denote serpents but refers to hypocrites.34 Allegorical interpretation implies reading such metaphori- cal transfers in reverse. One does so by finding the proper meaning origi- nally denoted in the sentence for Melanchthon, or in the complex narrative structure for Conti. Ultimately, allegorical interpretation implies the identi- fication of similitudes. For Melanchthon, similitude as a rhetorical trope 30 Conti, Mythologiae , 2. 31 Ibid., 9. 32 See Marianne Fraimout, "De l'utilisation de la mythologie dans la Première Sepmaine de Guillaume de Saluste du Bartas," in Du Bartas, 1590-1990, actes du colloque interna- tional d'Auch-Le Bartas-Pau , ed.

In Goulart's interpretation of the myth of Latona, these similitudes are purely relational and allow for their metaphorical formula- tion into a narrative. Similarly, Calvin grounded the usefulness of similitude as a didactic form of argument not in its status of image, but in the relation of similarity or dissimilarity it postulates between the comparing terms and the compared ones.37 The allegory of Latona encodes the spatial situations and causal relations of cosmology in narrative and dramatic terms. Juno, who prevents Latona from seeing her children Apollo and Diana, is the dramatic expression of the cosmological situations of the sphere of air, located between the sphere of the earth and the planetary spheres of the moon and of the sun.38 Similarly, the motherhood of Latona, which implies the cognate idea of fertility, encodes the astronomical influences of the sun and the moon on earthly processes of growth. This Ptolemaic commonplace pervades scholastic textbooks and can be found in Melanchthon's 1549 Initia doctrinae physicae ; he further identified the power of the sun with the ability to generate heat and dryness, and the power of the moon with the ability to generate moisture.39 In the Latona myth, the allegory therefore consists in the very fabulation or mise en récit of relations between com- pared terms and comparing ones: the metaphorical transfer associating Juno with the air and Latona with the earth is not explicitly grounded in any identification of similarities between intrinsic features of the mythical 35 "Exempla sunt facta similia, quae in aliqua specie congruunt, de quibus propter simili- tudinem idem iudicatur, ut: Theodosius recte fecit claudens templa idolorum / Ergo pii principes qui idolorum cultus prohibent, recte faciunt. / Valet consequentia, quia ratio similis est, Nam utrumque factum congruit ad legem: Debent obedentiam primo prae- cepto omnes homines, suo quisque loco. . . .

For Brian Vickers, the very arbitrariness of such similitudes determines the heuristic and epistemologi- ca! sterility of the vast systems of correspondences that characterize hermet- icism.40 In this respect, the recovery of any long-lost natural-philosophical wisdom in classical myths remained a precarious exercise: "One does not draw solid arguments from allegories alone," Melanchthon warned.41 Goulart agreed with this caveat: however systematic his natural-philosophical interpretations of the classical myths Du Bartas alludes to, he does not refer to them as knowledge, but as poetical fictions. In dismantling such fic- tions, Goulart did not intend to recover some lost natural-philosophical teachings - the interpretation of the Latona myth merely unearthes natural- philosophical commonplaces - rather, he waged war on the disastrous con- sequences of such allegories, namely idolatry and occultism. His own natural-philosophical interpretation of the "histoire" of Genesis in the Commentaires opposes such idolatrous deification of nature and hermetic conception of natural knowledge. NATURAL PHILOSOPHY IN GENESIS: ACCOMMODATION Calvinist Natural Theologies The Calvinist interpretation of nature makes sense within the natural- theological project suggested in the first book of Calvin's Institution de la religion chrestienne (final text of 1560). For Calvin, the magnificent order of the world leads everyone, not only the happy few, to witness the divine workmanship.42 We should therefore study nature as God's works - not for its own sake - in order to celebrate its Creator. In this respect, the natural- theological project justifies natural-philosophical learning, as Calvin states in Institution I.5.2.43 Although, strictly speaking, this text asserts that one 40 Brian Vickers, "On the Function of Analogy in the Occult," in Hermeticicism and the Renaissance , ed.

The final sentence might seem reminiscent of Conti's definition of "ancient hidden wisdom." Yet Calvin's lexicon is biblical and not hermetic: in scripture, the "divine wisdom" means the workmanship of God in nature and features as such in Goulart's definition of nature.44 The divine wisdom to be studied by natural philoso- phy is therefore the opposite of the deified nature of idolatry.45 Since the Fall, our understanding has become dull: the contemplation of nature will not suffice to lead us to God. We cannot achieve the natural- theological project without the help of scripture. In this respect, Calvinist natural theology limited the claims of more rationalist natural theological attempts such as Raymond of Sabunde's Theologia naturalis sive liber creaturarum (written 1433-36), translated and criticized by Montaigne.46 However, Calvin's praise of learning may also have left open the possibility of a variety of learned Calvinist natural theologies: what does reading nature through the spectacles of scripture really mean? " Waters Above the Heavens' Various Allegorical Interpretations and Natural Philosophies The natural theology that discloses divine wisdom is a Mosaic philosophy. Mosaic philosophy deems that Moses was the first natural philosopher, and that Genesis reveals the principles governing our visible, sensible world.47 Irrespective of confessional divisions, early modern scholasticisms already made use of the Bible to support the fundamental tenets of natural- philosophical orthodoxy. Scholastic textbooks often reminded their readers 44 "Ce mot se prend en diverses significations entre les Theologiens, Medecins &amp; Philo- sophes.

Thus the first book of Melanchthon's Initia refutes this thesis by referring to scripture.48 The Jesuit Benito Pereira also dedicated a whole final section of his De communibus omnium rerum naturalium principiis et affectionibus to the refutation of the eternity of the world thesis: he refers to scripture, but scarcely so in comparison to the bulk of philosophical and theological authorities he summons - Aquinas, Duns Scotus, and Henry of Ghent, among others. Moreover, for Pereira, these scriptural references are often intended to "clarify" the meaning of scripture against possible "liter- alist" destructive arguments; thus the use of "non posse" in Marc 6 and Matthew 9 does not literally express a divine impotency.49 Yet it is this very claim of literalism that characterized Mosaic philosophy. Calvin's literalism dismissed "allegory." The allegory he condemned is different from the one defined by Melanchthon and mentioned above. Cal- vin's literalist, or historical, reading of the Bible welcomed the Melanch- thonian allegorical reading of events in the Old Testament as préfigurations of events in the New Testament: such allegory demands that one reads the Bible as a succession of events in time, that is, elucidates its "histoire," its narrative structure. Thus Calvin's literalism did not exclude figurai reading, which to him was "literal" when it contributed to the clarification of the message of God in the world and in scripture.50 However, Calvin rejected the far-fetched, esoteric allegories of patristic or scholastic exegeses, which "imagine" a fictional meaning.51 Calvin's own gloss on the meaning of the "waters above the heavens" of Genesis 1:7 in his Commentaire sur la Genese illustrates what he meant by a "fictional" allegory by opposition to a "literalist" one, and provides the reader with the scriptural spectacles needed to read nature.52 Literalism 48 On Melanchthon's natural philosophy, see Sachiko Kusukawa, The Transformation of Natural Philosophy: The Case of Philip Melanchthon (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995). 49 "An sit aeternus mundus, an vero ceperit, &amp; an sit corruptibilis."

In his Homilies on Genesis , Origen identifies the "waters above the heavens" with the "spiritual waters" one should thrive to participate in; a further reference to the "rivers of living water" of John 7:38 has the "waters above the heav- ens" connote the beatitude and eternal life of the elect, by opposition to the "abysmal" waters of the corrupt world of the flesh.53 Origen repeats this distinction in his Homilies on the Psalms . Commenting on Psalm 36, he identifies the spiritual waters above the heavens with the dwelling-place of angels.54 Calvin condemned such patristic allegorical fictions, but also the astronomical and cosmological interpretation of the "waters above the heavens." This interpretation states that they constitute a ninth crystalline sphere. The issue of the number of the celestial spheres was hotly debated. Johannes Velcurio, one of Goulart's sources, summarizes this debate in his textbook: natural philosophers hold that eight celestial spheres are visible; theologians add three more on top of these, namely the crystalline sphere of the "waters above the heavens," the primum mobile , and the Empyrean heaven. Astronomers do not acknowledge the existence of the Empyrean heaven. Their system includes ten spheres: a primum mobile , a secundum mobile (which could easily be identified with the theological "waters above the heavens"), and the eighth sphere of the firmament.55 This astronomical allegories, &amp; philosophent icy des anges.

For Aristotle, every simple or elemental body has a simple motion.58 If a natural body is moved by a complex motion, this motion must be analysed into simple motions, which in turn must be attributed to the simple bodies to which they belong.59 The eighth sphere of the fixed stars or firmament appears to be moved by three motions: daily motion, trepidation, and retro- grade motion; yet, as a celestial sphere, it is a simple body. Therefore only one motion belongs proprie to the firmament, namely retrograde motion, and two more spheres are required above the firmament in order to account for the remaining two motions of trepidation ( secundum mobile) and daily motion [primům mobile). For Calvin, this scholastic interpretation of scrip- ture is as reprehensible as the patristic abuses of mystical allegory. Under- lying his rejection is the assertion that the teachings of scripture, and particularly of Genesis, are about the visible world and must be accessible to all. The idolatrous deification of nature and hermetic knowledge, these paired evils, may well lurk behind the astronomers' recondite concerns with celestial motions. Calvin finally opposes the astronomical interpretation with a meteorological one: the waters above the heavens are clouds. His interpretation is supported by the commonsensical experience of rain and mum, coelum Empyreum. Mathematici quoque non omnino conveniunt de numero &amp; ordine.

Calvinist literalism therefore promoted a natural philosophy for the unlearned, based on the everyday experience of the visible world. This commonsensical experience welcomed the natural-philosophical doxa when the two agreed with each other.60 Thus in his commentary on Genesis 2:9, Calvin calls the emergence of dry land a miracle because it contradicts the natural-philosophical doxa of the elemental spheres.61 Goularťs survey of the various interpretations of the "waters above the heavens" was more attuned to an "educated" doxa. His commentary instantiates one "learned" variety of natural theology whose possibility Calvin's praise of learning mentioned above had left open; contemporary scholars have even argued that Calvin's own natural philosophical state- ments epitomize such learning.62 While it seems to me that learning remains in check in Calvin's own literalist exegesis, some of his successors did read nature not only through the spectacles of scripture alone, but through the lenses of sophisticated scholarly traditions.63 An extreme case can be found in the third, natural-theological volume of La Primaudaye's Académie françoise (first published in 1590). La Primaudaye's cosmos is structured by an intricate analogical division into three realms: a theological one, a celestial one, and a physical one. Each of these is itself divided into nine spheres, and each sphere of each realm is the cause of motion in the corre- sponding sphere of the inferior realm. Thus the "physical water" of the elemental world is moved by the "celestial water" of the sphere of the moon, which is itself set in motion by the "water above the heavens" of the theological sphere of cherubims.64 La Primaudaye grounds his views in a cosmologica! interpretation of the Trinity and of the Covenant of Exodus.65 60 On common sense as doxical knowledge, see Higman, Style , 20-28; confirmed by Mil- let, Calvin , 596-97. 61 "Soyent assemblées.

Goulart's natural-philosophical hermeneutics stood midway between these two extremes, as his entry "Eaux celestes" shows.66 First, Goulart summarizes Du Bartas's own view. Against the astronomers, Du Bartas states that the ninth sphere is made of elemental water. Du Bartas thus contributed his own answer to the dispute regarding the nature of celestial matter rekindled by Tycho Brahe's 1573 Stella nova. A longstanding tradi- tion running from Albert the Great to the Jesuits of Coimbra had come to define Aristotelian ether in terms of crystalline solidity. This view was reasserted against the disturbing cosmological consequences of Brahe's observations in the 1593 commented edition of Aristotle's De cáelo by the Conimbricenses.67 Du Bartas's answer is more akin to the patristic cosmol- ogy of Ambrose's Hexameron , which states that the elements also consti- tute the matter of the celestial world.68 Like Calvin, he supports his thesis with a reference to the Flood. Unlike Calvin's, however, his interpretation remains an astronomical one - the waters are the ninth sphere - rather than a meteorological one. The meteorological view is finally stated by Goulart, who formulates it in the scholastic lexis of "exhalation." This overall more sophisticated account was closer to a learned natural philosophy than to the common-sense natural philosophy of the unlearned. While his concept of natural theology justified the learned investigation of nature as divine wisdom, Calvin's literalist reading of Genesis favoured a more commonsen- sical natural philosophy defined by the visible experience of the world and by scripture. However, this unlearned natural philosophy welcomed the basics, as it were, of the Aristotelian natural-philosophical doxa. Reading nature through the spectacle of scripture thus allowed for a variety of natural philosophies. These remained a means to an end, namely the glorification of God. If pious natural philosophy involves delving into divine wisdom, then 66 "Eaux celestes. . . . aucuns ont consideré un ciel de chrystal qui est au dessus de de celuy des estoilles ... Le Poete maintient qu'il y a des eaux en ce neufieme ciel, où ils demeurent suspendues (sic) &amp;C soustenues par la mesme puissance qui tient tout l'Univers suspendu &amp; retenu seulement de son vouloir.

Accommodation: Similitude and Narrative Order in Explanations of Chaos as Prime Matter Calvinist accommodation is both an ontological and a linguistic process. God makes himself "visible" to man in the world and "lisps" to him in scripture. This divine "clothing" and "lisping" is informed by two struc- tures, namely similitude and narrative order. The natural theologian must rely on both in order to interpret correctly the divine presence in the world and in scripture. Through accommodation, God provides signs - seals, marks - of Him- self. The nature of these divine seals was spelled out in Calvin's discussion of the Eucharist, which is also a form of accommodation.69 The Eucharist relies on a functional analogy: the bread feeds our body in the corporeal realm, just as the body of Christ feeds our soul in the spiritual realm. This similitude only teaches us something about Christ in relation to us, not about the divine essence of Christ per se. Calvinist accommodation appeals to similitude not so much to disclose the essence of its divine referent, but rather to translate into visible and understandable signs the inexpressible nature of the divine. Goulart's entry "God" expresses the same view.70 Thus, in scripture, there are images showing God's concealment and meta- phors expressing his divine incommensurability, like the clouds and smoke of Deuteronomy 4:11. 71 These similitudes have a didactic purpose: they 69 ". . . pource que ce mystere de communiquer à Iesus Christ est incomprehensible de nature, il nous en monste la figure &amp; image en signes visibles fort propres à nostre petitesse. ... Il nous le rend aussi asseuré que si nous le voyons à l'oeil, d'autant que cette similitude tant familiere entre iusques aux esprits les plus lourds, &amp; grossiers: c'est que tout ainsi que le pain &amp; le vin soustiennent noz corps en ceste vie transitoire, ausi nos ames sont nourries du Christ."

In this respect, Calvinist similitude stand opposite to the hermetic similitudes of mythological allegories: they provide for all an equivalent of what human understanding cannot grasp directly. This didactic function of similitude also informed the natural- philosophical interpretation of scripture. Genesis 1 particularly welcomes such analogical reformulations, because there the biblical text describes a state of the world that is hard for the human intellect to understand. Goul- art's entry "Matter" is telling in this respect.72 This text "translates" the "Tohu veBohu" of biblical Creation into the "learned" concept of Aristote- lian prime matter, itself reformulated into the similitude of the chancellor's sealing wax. The reference to the Aristotelian teaching on this issue justifies the similitude of the wax, because Aristotle himself states that we need to conceive of prime matter analogically. For Aristotle, our intellect cannot straightforwardly apprehend matter dissociated from form, because such matter would be pure potentiality and indeterminacy, that is, a nothingness. However, we need the concept of prime matter in order to account for change from one contrary to another in the same body. Such change would not be possible if we did not postulate the existence of an underlying mate- rial substrate. Our intellect can grasp this concept analogically. Aristotle uses the analogy of craftsmanship: bronze is to the statue what prime mat- ter is to any body with a form.73 The craftsmanship analogy easily lends itself to the natural-theological interpretation of Genesis because it involves an intention (the craftsman, or Creator), which was not Aristotle's main focus in his own argument but became central in early modern variations. Thus Goulart emphasized the action of the divine chancellor imposing his seals - the variety of creatures - onto the shapeless wax of Chaos. Goulart's entry is exemplary of the didactic function of Calvinist accommodation: the 72 "Les Philosophes considèrent la matiere en deux esgards. Car ils nomment l'une, matiere premiere commune, comprenable par l'imagination seulement, comme le Chaos ou matiere premiere dont le Poëte fait mention ne se void point ... Au reste, Aristotle disant que la premiere matiere ne se peut voir ny cognoistre, &amp; que ce qu'on en cognoist est par analogie, c'est à dire par exemples prins des arts ou des accidens: souvenons-nous de celuy que le Poete propose du Chancelier, lequel ayant une grosse masse de cire, informe &amp; confuse, en prend tels morceaux qu'il luy plaist, sur lesquels il imprime tels cachets que bon luy semble, &amp; donne à la matiere telle forme que bon luy semble.

The second, commonsensical similitude renders this divine wisdom accessible to the unlearned, and refocuses the interpretation of Genesis and its corollary investigation of the principles of nature onto the praise of the Creator. This is orthodox Calvinist natural theology. Another form of accommodation of particular significance to the natu- ral interpretation of Genesis is the temporal order of Creation and its narra- tive expression. In his Genese , Calvin refutes the idea that the six days of Creation are a narrative device, meant by Moses to "unpack" an instanta- neous Creation of the world to the benefit of man's understanding.74 For Calvin, the narrative order of Genesis reflects accurately the temporal order and length of Creation itself: this very length is where divine accommoda- tion resides. God created the world in six days in order to compel man to pause and ponder on each day of Creation. In Goulart's entry "Spirit" in his Commentaires , the Calvinist emphasis on the narrative order of Creation reflecting its real length, and on the sim- plicity of the biblical language in which God accommodates Himself to the unlearned, determines an eclectic and anti-Aristotelian natural-philosophical interpretation of Genesis 2:1: "And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness [was] upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters." Goulart first states that the thesis equating Chaos with a created Aristotelian prime matter, onto which the Holy Spirit imposed the forms of creatures, raises issues. Some criticized this interpreta- tion in the name of divine accommodation: prime matter is not an easy con- cept to understand, and it is therefore unlikely to be what is meant in Genesis. Goulart goes on to say that the elements are a more commonsensical choice: unlike the "prime matter" interpretation, the elemental one acknowledges the significance of this other form of divine accommodation, namely the tem- poral order of Creation equated with the narrative succession of verses in Genesis. Thus the creation of water, earth, and fire occurred on the first day (Gen. 1:1-5). Air is created on the second day (Gen. 1:6, "Let there be a firmament in the midst of the water," consistent with the meteorological interpretation of the "waters above the heavens" of Gen. 1:7), while water and earth are distinguished on the third day (Gen. 1:9: "Let the dry land appear"). This interpretation also entails an elemental understanding of the "Spirit of God," equated with the pure virtue, or active principle of elemental 74 Calvin, Genese , 15. 378</page><page sequence="19">Garrod ♦ Simon Goulart fire, namely heat; this definition of "Spirit" has alchemical echoes.75 Divine accommodation in the "simple language" and temporal order of Genesis ulti- mately justifies this alternative, elemental interpretation of Creation. Its "commonsensical" character is debatable: Goulart concludes his entry by referring his reader to his source, the erudite edition of Plato's complete works by Jean de Serre and Henri Estienne (1578). For many Reformers and Catholics alike, the Platonic "Creation" of Timaeus offered a more accept- able cosmogenic alternative to the disturbing Aristotelian thesis of the eter- nity of the world.76 Calvin acknowledged that there was some truth in Plato's Timaeus , but ultimately he dismissed Plato for corrupting such truth with his mistakes.77 By contrast, Pierre de La Primaudaye embraced it unreservedly.78 Hermeneutical uses of Timaeus were all the more suspicious to Calvin since he condemned the very type of allegorical exegesis such hermeneutics rely on in the commentary of their most illustrious representative, Philo of Alexan- dria (c. 20 b.c. to 40 A.D.).79 "HISTOIRES" AND THE LIMITS OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE For Calvin, fiction characterizes idolatry: it testifies to a natural tendency in man, whose corrupted, sinful nature is prone to the elaboration of figments, inventions, and symbolical lies.80 The narrative, hermetic encoding of natural- philosophical knowledge in classical myth is was one such expression of sin- ful corruption. Allegory, that is, the narrative expression of similitude, struc- tures this idolatrous practice. Fighting idolatry therefore implied interpreting allegory in order to reduce classical myths back to their natural-philosophical content, thus making this content accessible to all. Making God understandable is central to the Calvinist notion of divine 75 Goulart, Commentaires , 19r-20v. 76 See the critical addendum on this issue by the Catholic François de Belleforest (1530- 83) in his translation of Sebastian Munster's Cosmographia universalis (international Latin text of 1550): La Cosmographie universelle de tout le monde , trans.

At the heart of this translation process one finds, once again, similitude and narrative order. These two rhetorical structures prove fundamental to the natural-philosophical interpretations of Genesis in Goulart's Commentaires . Reading nature through the spectacles of scripture involves sophisticated and sometimes conflicting natural-philosophical interpretations relying on a doxi- cal "common sense," but maybe even more so on the variety of "learned" natural philosophies available on the early modern intellectual market. Ultimately, therefore, the interpretation of rhetorical processes of didac- tic similitude and narrative order - that is, "histoires" in the equivocal period sense - remain central to the type of Calvinist natural theology instantiated in the Commentaires . Because they are the structures of divine accommodation, such "histoires" also mediate the true knowledge of nature, which itself mediates the human understanding of God. While they maintain the possibility of such knowledge, "histoires" also testify to the limits of the human intellect. The Calvinist dismantling of classical myth, as well as its interpretation of divine accommodation in the joint reading of Genesis and nature, contribute to a pessimistic anthropology highlighting the finitude of human understanding and the corruption of mankind. The scriptural and natural-philosophical "histoires" translating God in Genesis and in nature remain empty fables without the "doctrine" they are meant to illustrate. Without the definite criterion of truth that faith is, interpretations of nature are mere sophistical fictions which have us halt in "the bare knowl- edge or appearance," to quote Calvin denouncing a faithless understanding of the Eucharist.81 For Goulart, Daedalus is the very symbol of these fables of understanding alone: "Maze . . . men have called Daedalus all profound inventions whose parts one cannot easily fathom. . . .
