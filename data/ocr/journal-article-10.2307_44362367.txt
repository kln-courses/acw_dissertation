Located in the center of the so-called "Northwest" of the Indian subcontinent, it was a region where Buddhism encountered the civilization from the Mediterranean world, subsequently creating multifarious ramifications, and flourished on an enormous scale for several centuries afterwards in distinctive material form, which foremost includes a peculiar hybrid artistic tradition commonly called "Gandhāran art." It also played a dominant role in the transmission of Buddhism to the This paper was originally presented at the conference "Investigating the Early Mahayana" held by the Stanford Buddhist Center in Asilomar on May 15-18, 2001 and in a further developed but abridged form at another conference on the early Mahayana held by the Tõhõ Gakkai in Tokyo on May 16, 2003. It was also delivered at several institutions in the U.S. while I was staying there for a year in 2003. The current version is based on the Stanford paper but has incorporated a number of new ideas developed in the Tõhõ Gakkai paper. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those who gave me valuable suggestions on this paper on various occasions - particularly Professors Gregory Schopen, Jan Nattier, Hubert Durt, Paul Harrison, Lothar von Falkenhausen, Aramaki Noritoshi, Shimoda Masahiro, Saitõ Akira, and Haewon Kim. 1 In this paper, "Gandhāra" is used in a broader sense to designate the region encompass- ing the Peshawar basin, Swat valley, Taxila and eastern Afghanistan, not in the Chinese pil- grims' usage where it is generally restricted to the Peshawar basin. It will also be used in the sense interchangeable with the "Northwest" of the Indian subcontinent. 152</page><page sequence="2">RHI: EARLY M AHÃYÃN A AND G ANDHĀRAN BUDDHISM east, primarily to Central Asia and China, by providing scriptures, images, and missionary monks who actively engaged in the translation of the earliest Buddhist scriptures into Chinese, and by receiving numerous pilgrims from the east. Furthermore, it has been popularly suspected that some of the impor- tant, early Mahãyãna scriptures - such as the Saddharmapuņdarīka-sūtra and the Larger Sukhâvatîvyûha - originated in this area2 and that the Northwest was one of the strongholds of early Mahãyãnists.3 Despite this popular supposition regarding a close connection between the early Mahãyãna and the Northwest, substantial - beyond circumstantial - evidence is extremely rare, let alone any explicit testimony in literary and epi- graphical sources.4 Given this awkward situation, visual monuments and images, profusely created in Buddhist monasteries in this region and now extant in enormous quantity, appear to be the most valuable source for the presence or activity of Mahãyãnists in this region. Exploring aspects of the early Mahãyãna in such visual evidence from Gandhāra is the task this paper assumes to undertake. In attempting a discussion in this regard, several inherent problems and dif- ficulties should be stated at the beginning. First, the identification and read- ing of the theme or meaning of a visual image in artistic materials is not as simple and definite as one might hope or anticipate. It is often difficult to determine iconographically what is represented, and this is the case with Gandhāran art except for conventional narrative scenes. Explicit designations written in the form of dedicatory inscriptions might help, but in Gandhāran art extremely few, if any, images actually carry such inscriptions. Iconograph- ical identification thus quite often operates under the influence of precon- ceived ideas. This means that our assessment of Gandhāran art is inevitably affected by our premises on Gandhāran Buddhism, unlike our initial antici- pation that material evidence in art will clarify a number of problems in the 2 Shiio 1933, pp. 82-103; Nakamura 1972, pp. 485-93. It should also be noted, however, that this popular conception has been questioned by some scholars on linguistic grounds: see Boucher 1998b, pp. 471-506. 3 Lamotte 1954, pp. 389-96; Shizutani 1980, pp. 20-29. 4 Shizutani Masao suggests that such passages, distinctively found in a number of dedica- ti ve inscriptions in KharosthI as 44 sarvabuddhana puyae ( = sarvabuddhāņām pūjājai : for the worship of all Buddhas)" and 44 sarvasatvana hidasuhae ( = sarvasattvāņām hitasukhae : for the welfare and happiness of all living beings)" are formulae that expressed the devotional wish of Mahãyãnists. Shizutani 1974, pp. 273-85. For such inscriptions, see Konow 1929, inscrip- tions nos. XIII, XVII, XXIII, XXVII, etc. Still, they have no direct reference to Mahãyãna, which leaves room for suspicion. 153</page><page sequence="3">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 conception of a religion created on the basis of our knowledge of textual mate- rials.5 Second, even if an art object is iconographically identifiable, it could be equally difficult to judge to what extent it is relevant to Mahãyâna. The Mahâyãnist could worship or dedicate an image of a deity, whatever its true import may be, which was not exclusively referred to in the Mahãyãna tex- tual tradition and which was thus common to both Mahãyãna and non- Mahãyãna. In such a case, it would be extremely hard, in the first place, to identify the cult as Mahãyãna without any supportive evidence, but even hard- er to define its "Mahãyãna-ness." Perhaps this implies that we should not be too discouraged by the absence of explicit evidence for Mahãyãna in Gandhāran art and should be willing to interpret the available evidence in a more positive spirit. Third, the concept of Mahãyãna itself is ambiguous and problematic, par- ticularly outside the textual tradition and when it is used in a binary opposi- tion between Mahãyãna and non-Mahãyãna. It does not seem clear to me how we should treat "Mahãyãna within non-Mahãyãna" or "non-Mahãyãna with- in Mahãyãna." When someone who is barely aware of or perhaps cares little about what may be termed exclusively as Mahãyãna at a doctrinal level ded- icates an image of a divinity that is monopolized in the Mahãyãna scriptural tradition, is he/she a Mahãyãnist? Or is his/her dedication an example of Mahãyãna practice? Does the discussion of his/her activity have anything to do with that of doctrinal agenda that could have obsessed the minds of learned monastics in a limited circle? Fourth, in the same vein, art serving a religion - although it would inevi- tably reflect the religion - tends to represent certain segments or aspects of religious ideas and practices better than others. Quite frequently some segment or aspect could be disproportionately magnified, while others could be entirely missing. Therefore, information deduced from artistic materials could have a limited significance, and extreme caution is necessary in link- ing it to that of the textual tradition. Most of the monuments and objects in Gandhāran art were related to devotional practice, and were quite conven- tional and stereotyped in form and iconography. There seems to have been 5 It is true, as Gregory Schopen points out (personal communication, May 2001 ), that artis- tic or archaeological materials have advantage in being more securely fixed in provenance and date than textual materials of early Indian Buddhism, which are notoriously hard to locate in this regard. Yet, identifying or reading a visual material thematically tends to be equivocal, while the denotation of a word or a passage in literary form is clear enough in most cases. 154</page><page sequence="4">RHI: EARLY MAHÃYÃNA AND G ANDHĀRAN BUDDHISM little room in them for sophisticated doctrinal or philosophical ideas - such as to be found in the textual tradition - to be projected properly. The discussion in this paper does not attempt to resolve all these problems, some of which may lie beyond the capacity of the present author; but they will be kept in consideration for a critical assessment of Mahäyäna in Gandhāran art throughout this paper. Stūpas and Monasteries Before we move on to the discussion of visual images proper, some remarks are necessary on the role of stūpa worship in the early Mahäyäna and the sit- uation in Gandhāra. Erecting a stūpa was a prevalent practice in Gandhāra, as at any place in Indian Buddhism, and numerous stūpas, large and small, are extant at monastery sites. Buddhist monasteries in Gandhāra usually had a dominant stūpa (very rarely more than one) as the focus of worship, along with a number of smaller ones, presumably made for the attainment of merit or in the memory of deceased monastics or laity.6 Such stūpas may remind one of the well-known theory by the Japanese scholar Hirakawa Akira that Mahäyäna originated and developed as an order of renuncíate lay practition- ers who had their base around stūpas and actively engaged in stūpa worship. First proposed by Hirakawa in the early 1960s and elaborated in a series of his later works,7 it has exerted a dominant influence on the conception of the early Mahäyäna among Japanese scholars. The theory has been recounted in most of the Japanese surveys of Indian Buddhism, and it has had a certain impact on Western scholarship as well. Although Hirakawa' s theory does not particularly focus on Gandhāra, he occasionally discusses the situation there. He suggests the presence of such 6 I essentially agree with Gregory Schopen in what he described as the function of small stūpas surrounding the major stūpa in Buddhist monasteries in India, and believe that this was also generally true with Gandhāran monasteries. See "Burial Ad Sanctos and the Physical Presence of the Buddha in Early Indian Buddhism," in Schopen 1997, pp. 1 18-123. Recently, I have been exploring in a similar vein the ramifications of the relic cult on the emergence of the image cult in early Buddhist art in Rhi 2001, pp. 89-93, and in a slightly different direc- tion in Rhi 2002. 7 Hirakawa's theory is generally known to Western scholars through Hirakawa 1963, pp. 57-106. But his opinion was presented on several other occasions including "Daijõ bukkyõ no kyõdanshiteki seikaku," in Daijõ bukkyõ no seiritsushiteki kenkyü (1957), pp. 447-82, where such ideas were presented for the first time, and his magnum opus Shoki daijõ bukkyõ no kenkyü (1968), which should be the most detailed source for his ideas. 155</page><page sequence="5">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 Mahãyãnists in this region by citing KharosthI inscriptions that do not spec- ify the name of a nikãya as the recipient of an offering.8 Yet, he was not real- ly able to offer any concrete evidence or identify any such examples at extant monastery sites.9 This is understandable as Hirakawa was, after all, not an archaeologist. But anyone who is more familiar with archaeological remains of Gandhāran monasteries would find his suggestion profoundly skeptical. Even if one were to acknowledge - although this itself is questionable on a number of grounds10 - that the worship and maintenance of a stūpa was ini- tially assumed by the laity separately from the samgha of ordained monas- tics, it must be realized that a stūpa was established as an indispensable part of most monasteries by the time the earliest extant monasteries as we see now in archaeological remains were founded in Gandhāra. Although one might occasionally find a stūpa without a discernible monastic structure, there is vir- tually no monastic structure without an accompanying stūpa. Even in the case of a stūpa without a monastic structure, it is quite possible that such a struc- ture simply has not yet been uncovered or has disappeared because it had been built of perishable materials. It seems hardly possible to attach a special meaning to stūpas in Gandhāra as an institutional basis of Mahãyãnists. Diverse types of architectural plans involving a stūpa (or stūpas), a monastic quarter, and image chapels are discerned in Gandhāran monasteries, but it seems obvious that they are not due to a sectarian division between Mahãyãna and non-Mahãyãna. I do not rule out the possibility that such Mahãyãna monasteries as pro- posed by Hirakawa on the basis of Gocarapańśuddha and Ugradattapariprcchā were present in Gandhāra,11 but it seems essentially impossible to identify them in concrete evidence among Gandhāran monasteries. At the same time, 8 Hirakawa 1968, pp. 652-74. 9 Hirakawa cites several Gandhāran monastery sites such as Takht-i-Bāhī, Sahri-Bahlol (Mound A) and Dharmarājika in Taxila but concedes that they are probably not Mahãyãna bases (Hirakawa 1968, pp. 652-57). These monasteries were originally discussed by Takata Osamu in his criticism of Hirakawa's theory (Takata 1967, pp. 271-274), but Takata was con- fused in supposing that the main stūpa in the monasteries was surrounded by a number of monastic cells, which are actually a series of image chapels, a wrong conception Hirakawa had to cite credulously in his discussion. Nevertheless, the correction made here does not provide any grounds for supporting Hirakawa's theory. 10 "Monks and the Relic Cult in the Mahaparinibbana-sutta : An Old Misunderstanding in Regard to Monastic Buddhism," Schopen 1997, pp. 99-1 13. 11 Hirakawa 1968, pp. 483-548, 661-74. A more negative assessment on this point than mine is found in Sasaki 1997, pp. 79-1 13, and Nattier 2003, pp. 89-93. 156</page><page sequence="6">RHI: EARLY MAHÃYÃNA AND G ANDHĀRAN BUDDHISM I doubt that, even if such monasteries did exist, they would have had any noticeable size within Gandhāran Buddhism overall. I suspect that they were merely one of the multiple and diverse groups largely associated with Mahãyãna. Narrative Representations of Biographical Themes Walls of most buildings - including stūpas - in Gandhāran monasteries were lavishly embellished with reliefs of various scenes in stone and stucco. The narrative scenes from the life of Śakyamuni Buddha and his previous lives were the most popular subjects in such reliefs. Elaborately represented in numerous individual scenes, they form a prominent feature in Gandhāran art, and whether they had any relationship with Mahãyãna or not is an interesting question. The life of the Buddha and the jãtaka stories were widely employed in artis- tic representations in ancient India and later throughout the Buddhist world, which encompassed the followers of both Mahãyãna and non-Mahãyãna, and thus they do not necessarily belong to the exclusive domain of Mahãyãna. Rather, these subjects, which apparently lay much emphasis on the historical Buddha Śakyamuni, have frequently been regarded as closer in spirit to the artistic repertoire of non-Mahãyãna (or pre-Mahãyãna). Śakyamuni was, however, the focus of worship for most Mahãyãnists in the early stage, per- haps except those who prayed for the rebirth in the Pure Land of Amitābha or Akśobhya. It is also notable that scholars have pointed out the role of the biographical literature of Śakyamuni Buddha as a préfiguration of the emer- gence of Mahãyãna.12 This might suggest that the remarkable popularity of such biographical themes in Gandhāran art should not be dismissed too hasti- ly in its possible association with Mahãyãnists. Yet, the relevance of this bio- graphical literature to the early Mahãyãna is a highly debatable issue, and the judgment on this problem may well be left to textual specialists. Compared with the Buddha's life scenes, representations of jātakas are considerably fewer in number and quite limited in the variety of themes. Ac- cording to my database of extant narrative works, some fifty pieces, with undoubted authenticity, are identifiable, and they represent only about ten jātakas. Surprisingly, around two thirds of them deal with the Dīpamkara- jātaka (Fig. 1). The dominance of this theme is partly explained by the fact 12 Hirakawa 1990, pp. 262-67; Tsukamoto 1981, pp. 235-36. 157</page><page sequence="7">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, I &amp; 2 that the Dīparņkara-jātaka was firmly localized in Nagarahāra (present-day Jalālābād Valley in Afghanistan),13 and about a third of its extant depictions actually came from the Kabul and Jalālābād areas. But this may not be a sat- isfactory explanation when considering that other popular jātakas that were also localized in this region, such as the Višvantara-jātaka (Peshawar basin) and the Ēibi-jātaka (Swat),14 were represented quite rarely, only in a few in- stances, while two thirds of the representations of the Dīparņkara-jātaka were made in the Peshawar basin and the Swat valley, located outside the Kabul and Jalālābād areas. This indicates that the Dīparņkara-jātaka was probably perceived among Gandhāran Buddhists as imbued with a greater significance than merely that of being a delightful story, as the very beginning of the remarkable career toward the Buddhahood of Śakyamuni and as a prelude to the numerous life scenes of the Buddha in Gandhāran art. The Dīpamkara-jātaka is recounted in a number of the biographical accounts of the Buddha including the Mahāvastu of the Lokottaravādins, the Vinaya of the Dharmaguptakas and the Pāli Nidānakathā of the Sri Lankan Theravādins; thus it is not necessarily within the exclusive repertoire of Mahãyãna. Hikata Ryüshö sees in this tale, however, a reflection of the Mahãyãna idea of vyâkarana, and regards its incorporation in the Dhar- maguptaka-vinaya and the Nidānakathā as possibly due to a Mahãyãna influence.15 Shizutani Masao is also of the opinion that this tale is closely related to "Primitive Mahãyãna" - which he proposes as the earliest stage in the development of Mahãyãna - and to the Northwest.16 There may be rea- sonable grounds for suggesting an association of this theme with Mahãyãna, but not enough to regard them as definitively established. But no matter how we may define its relationship with Mahãyãna, the Dīparņkara-jātaka obvi- ously stands out as a prominent element in Gandhāran art.17 13 Legge, trans. 1886, p. 38; Beai, trans. 1884, vol. 1, pp. 91-93. 14 Beai, trans. 1884, vol. 1, pp. 11 1-1 12; p. 125. 15 Hikata 1954, pp. 68-83. 16 Shizutani 1974, pp. 160-73. 17 The Dīparņkara-jātaka is quite rarely represented outside the Northwest on the subconti- nent. A relief from Nāgāijunakoņda that depicts a person prostrating at the feet of the Buddha has been identified as an illustration of the theme probably inspired by Gandhāran examples (Longhurst 1938, pp. 34-35). But it does not show the spreading of the hair, which could be the most distinctive iconographie sign for this theme, and this identification does not seem entirely free from questioning. A similar example, again without the spreading of the hair, is found at Ajantā (the façade of Cave 19; Huntington 1985, fig. 12.4), while another example at 158</page><page sequence="8">RHI: EARLY M AHÃYÃN A AND G ANDHĀRAN BUDDHISM The Origin of the Buddha Image and Image Worship Gandhāra is famous for the creation of the first Buddha images along with Mathurā in northern India. Although the precedence between the two places was the issue of heated debate in the early twentieth century, scholars these days tend to support the simultaneous and independent origin of the Buddha image in both places or to favor the precedence of Mathurā over Gandhāra. This seems to me a convenient compromise not necessarily supported by definitive evidence and not entirely free from political considerations. 1 8 Also, it is still debatable whether the concept and function of the first Buddha images - as images or material objects that had the resemblance of a human being - were indeed identical in the two regions, or whether any side took the initiative in this remarkable feat in the history of Buddhism. In any case, the origin of the Buddha image has been frequently - although much less in recent years - attributed to the Mahãyãnists, who, in the opinion of most scholars, happened to appear on the scene of Indian Buddhism around the same time. 19 Perhaps this could be a prime example of "Mahãyãna" being used as a magical word, as if it held the key to everything. To the disappointment of those who hope for the decisive role of Mahãyãna in the creation of the Buddha image, the majority of dedicative inscriptions carved on the earliest extant images of Śakyamuni from Mathurā, refer to the names of traditional nikäyas such as the Sarvāstivāda, Mahāsamghika and Dharmaguptaka;20 they also indicate the active involvement of prominent monastics from the contemporaneous samgha.21 Theoretically, it is not entire- ly impossible to question whether this phenomenon is extendable to the situ- Nālandā (relief in stucco in a niche of a structure surrounding the main catiya) does have the spreading of the hair (Misra 1998, vol. 3, fig. 5). These few examples, except for the depiction of DTpamkara in a different context in the Pāla manuscripts, are all we have outside Gandhāra. 18 Supporting the Gandhāran origin would naturally have the potential risk of being equat- ed with the position that favors the anachronistic "Greek origin" or the colonialist view over the more politically-correct nationalist view of Indians on this issue. However, one should be aware that where the Buddha image was first created remains a question related to a fact not necessarily motivated by the colonialist outlook of the by-gone era despite postmodernist crit- icism. See on this point, Abe 1995, pp. 63-106, cf. Nattier 1997, pp. 472-74. 19 Seckel 1968, pp. 28-172; Fisher 1993, pp. 43-44. 20 Refer to the list of inscriptions with sectarian affiliation in Lamotte 1988, pp. 523-27. 21 "On Monks, Nuns, and 'Vulgar' Practices: The Introduction of the Image Cult into Indian Buddhism," Schopen 1997, pp. 238-257. 159</page><page sequence="9">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 ation in Gandhāra or not and to suppose that a different kind of religious enti- ty was behind the creation of the Buddha image there. But such a possibility seems slim in light of the present evidence. Aside from the origin of the Buddha image, the prevalence of image-mak- ing and image-dedication could be a question not necessarily related to the former. The dedication of images was a prominent phenomenon in Gandhāran monasteries, where a large number of images, unparalleled elsewhere, have been excavated (Fig. 2). Although there is no accurate estimation, the num- ber seems disproportionately large compared with any other major centers of early Indian Buddhism such as Mathurā and Andhradeśa. To accommodate such an enormous number of images, a series of small chapels - which I call "aligned chapels" to distinguish them from "independent shrines" - were commonly installed surrounding a stūpa court (Fig. 3). Particularly popular in the Peshawar basin, chapels of this type were quite a distinctive feature, to which parallels are seldom found elsewhere among contemporaneous Buddhist centers.22 The presence of numerous Buddha images at Gandhāran monasteries may appear a redundant plurality, particularly to the eye famil- iar with Buddhist images and shrines in East Asia, where the uniqueness of a singular image occupying a shrine is emphasized as the focus of worship. They were apparently dedicated mostly for the attainment of merit. This phenomenon obviously reminds us of accounts in such Mahãyãna sūtras as the Saddharmapuņdarīka and the Tathāgatapratibimbapratisthā- nusamsā ( Zuofo xingxiang jing or Zaoli xingxiang fubao jing), where merit attained from making and worshiping images is lavishly discussed and enthu- siastically extolled.23 It is also interesting to note that such an account is quite rare in non-Mahāyāna scriptures. It may be argued against the significance of these Mahãyãna sūtras that they were created relatively late, so that such ref- erences to images found their way into them, whereas most non-Mahãyãna literature dates much earlier, prior to the emergence of the image worship.24 But the argument seems to fall far short of explaining the conspicuous promi- nence of the references to image-making or image-dedication in such scrip- 22 Rhi 1994, pp. 182-84; cf.

Such traditional nikäyas are common- sensically treated as representing the established samgha that the Mahäyänists supposedly antagonized, and this may considerably discourage anticipation for Mahãyãna having operated behind the vigorous image-dedication activi- ty at Gandhāran monasteries, unless there is any other way to view the rela- tionship between such nikäyas and Mahãyãna. Buddha Images Probably the simplest - albeit not the easiest - way to identify Mahãyãna in Gandhāran art would be to find the deities exclusively referred to in Mahãyãna scriptures. Amitābha Buddha has been a popular candidate because many scholars suspect that the Amitābha cult and its scriptures originated in this region, and a number of attempts have been made in this regard.26 A remark- able discovery was made in the early 1980s, when a Buddha triad with an inscription that supposedly contained the name "Amitābha" along with "Avalokiteávara" was reported,27 and this piece has been accepted by a num- ber of scholars as crucial evidence for the Amitābha cult (Fig. 4).28 But unlike a similar inscription from Mathurā that records "Amitābha," the reading of this inscription is hardly clear, as demonstrated by Gregory Schopen and Richard Salomon, who question the presence of either "Amitābha" or "Avalokiteávara" in it.29 Besides this triad, attempts have been repeatedly 25 In the Vinayas of various nikäyas - and thus in those nikäyas - Buddha images are treat- ed as something natural. For instance, the phrase that one should not relieve oneself holding a Buddha image is commonly found. That one should pay homage to a Buddha image before seeing a teacher is another common phrase. See for example [ Dharmaguptaka-vinaya ] T1428, 22:711c; T1429, 22:1021c; [ Múlasarvãstivãda-vinaya ] T1458, 24:600a; [Samantapāsādikā' Tl 462, 24:787b. However, such prominent emphasis on the dedication of images as we read in the Saddharmapuņdarīka-sūtra and the Tathāgatapratibimbapratisthānusamsā is seldom found elsewhere. 26 Higuchi 1950, pp. 108-1 13; Huntington 1980, pp. 652-72. 27 Brough 1982, pp. 65-70. 28 See, for example Fussman 1999, pp. 543-47. 29 Schopen and Salomon 2002, pp. 3-30, cf.

Except for the dubious "Amitābha" triad, it is extremely difficult to iden- tify in inscribed objects any deities that would have been exclusively wor- shiped in Mahâyâna, since in Gandhāra very few images carry the name of the represented deities. Śakyamuni, Kaśyapa and Dlpamkara are recorded in a few inscriptions;30 but it is obvious that as Buddhas of the past, they do not necessarily belong to the category of Mahâyâna worship. In these circumstances, a remaining option would be to explore whether there is any iconographical distinction between various deities and whether it would suggest the presence of any of them relevant to Mahâyâna. In Buddha images, however, this approach is difficult because they exhibit an extreme- ly monotonous pattern. The standing Buddhas, which occupy by far the majority of cult statues, are all identical in their strictly frontal pose making the abhayamudrã with their right hand and holding the end of the garment in their left hand (Fig. 5). The seated Buddhas are usually in paryaňkasana , and very rarely in pralambapadãsana , displaying three different hand gestures, abhayamudrã , dhyãnamudrã and dharmacakramudrā (in the last instance with their right shoulder usually bare); but it is very doubtful whether differ- ent gestures were intended to signify different Buddhas, as they seem more likely to have been shared by all Buddhas.31 I presume that the majority of Buddha images of Gandhāra were of Śakyamuni, the central object of worship in early Buddhism. As epigraphi- 30 The name of Dlpamkara is inscribed on a stone pedestal from Nowshera, and those of Śakyamuni and Kaśyapa are on stucco Buddhas at Jauliañ in Taxila. See Konow 1929, nos. XXXVI- 10, 11, LXXI. 31 The seated Buddha making the abhayamudrã must have been a counterpart for the stand- ing Buddha, which invariably - except for an extremely small number of instances - has the same hand gesture. The one with the dhyãnamudrã seems to signify the samādhi state of the Buddha, which is most conspicuously presented in the narrative context as the Buddha medi- tating in the Indrašailagūha (Indra' s cave); perhaps it initially had some connection with the latter theme. For this point I have been strongly inspired by Professor Aramaki Noritoshi's interpretation of the Indrašailagūha discussed in the present issue of The Eastern Buddhist. The seated Buddha with the dharmacakramudrā , which occupies the majority of seated Buddha images, is perhaps readable as signifying the Buddha awakened from the samādhi or activat- ed to preach as a teacher. This interpretation may have ramifications in the discussion of com- plex scenes with the preaching Buddha. 162</page><page sequence="12">RHI: EARLY MAHÃYÃNA AND G ANDHĀRAN BUDDHISM cal evidence indicates, there were also Dīpamkara and Kaśyapa.32 A set of six Buddhas prior to Śakyamuni, which starts from Vipašyin and ends with Kaśyapa, was carved in reliefs along with Śakyamuni and the Bodhisattva Maitreya, and thus they could have existed as independent statues as well, although their number must have been small. Perhaps Maitreya Buddha images were also present, even though representing Maitreya as a Buddha rather than as a Bodhisattva would have required a leap of thought.33 1 do not rule out the possibility that such Mahäyäna Buddhas as Amitābha and Aksobhya were represented in a minority of instances, but there is still no cor- roborative evidence for this. The presumption that Śakyamuni Buddha must have been the subject of the majority of Buddha images created in Gandhāra does not necessarily mean that they were worshiped only within the context of non-Mahāyāna. The likelihood equally remains that the Mahãyãnists were involved in the dedication of such images. Even if all these different Buddhas were present as images in the Northwest, one has to be reminded that they were essentially indistinguishable in iconog- raphy and would have been also to those involved in the dedication or wor- ship of images. Perhaps it was thought that Buddhas should look identical regardless of individual identity, since they all supposedly had attained the same supreme enlightenment that would lie beyond individual specification in form.34 If making a distinction in individual identity of Buddhas was hard- ly a concern in visual iconography, one wonders whether their individuality would have mattered as much for the contemporaneous Buddhists as it does to present-day art historians. This may be another indication that the great 32 Several Buddhas from the Kapiśi area are identifiable as Dīpamkara - although not spec- ified in inscriptions - for narrative details that include Sumedha (or Megha) paying homage to the Buddha with his hair spread; otherwise they look identical with other standing Buddhas. 33 John Huntington attempted to identify Maitreya Buddhas in Gandhāran art by equating a representation of Maitreya Bodhisattva carved on the frontal face of a pedestal with a Buddha standing or seated on the pedestal. This method seems dubious to me because the relationship between such scenes on the frontal face of a pedestal and an image on the pedestal has not been clearly established. See Huntington 1984, pp. 133-78. 34 Such a unitary character of Buddha images in iconography was not restricted to Gandhāra, but a universal phenomenon wherever Buddhist art was in practice - including East Asia where a variety of Buddhas were represented in images - until a much later time when the esoteric Buddhist iconography prescribed sophisticated rules for the distinction of various Buddhas. This suggests that the question raised here may be extendable to other areas, although we would have to take into consideration regional variations. 163</page><page sequence="13">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 majority of Buddha images were either intended as Śakyamuni or many of them could have been made simply as an unspecified, generic Buddha. This line of thought brings us to the question concerning our conventional, uncrit- ical approach in search for "individual Buddhas," e.g., from the Mahãyãna context. To this point, we will return below. Bodhisattva Images The situation with Bodhisattva images is quite different. Not only do we witness the deliberate intention to distinguish various iconographie types apparently meant to represent different Bodhisattvas, but also their variety seems obviously much greater than what we would normally expect within the boundaries of the non-Mahāyāna or pre-Mahāyāna tradition.35 The great majority of Bodhisattva images represent a type holding a water vase and having knotted hair without a turban, which is identifiable as Maitreya since it appears consistently in the reliefs of the Seven Buddhas of the Past and Maitreya.36 The dominance of this type indicates the popularity of the cult of Maitreya Bodhisattva. There was a second type, in much small- er numbers, which wears a turban and has the left hand on the waist in stand- ing images.37 It is commonly identified as Siddhārtha because of its similarity to the prince in narrative scenes from the life of Śakyamuni Buddha. Corresponding to these standing images are seated images wearing turbans and making the dhyãnamudrã. Some examples have the plowing scene carved on the frontal face of the pedestal, which indicates that the Bodhisattva is Prince Siddhārtha in the first meditation under the Jambu tree.38 On this basis, seated figures wearing turbans in the meditation pose are usually identified 35 As regards to Bodhisattva images in Gandhāran art, I have discussed this in detail in rela- tion to Mahãyãna in a separate paper; so I do not wish to repeat the details, but will provide essential points here. See Rhi 2004. Miyaji Akira has also done considerable work on this mat- ter. I have benefited a great deal from his work, and my ideas generally coincide with his.

Both Maitreya and Siddhārtha were not necessarily the exclu- sive objects of veneration for Mahãyãnists, although they could have been worshiped by them as well. What interests us more is a third type, which wears a turban, holds a wreath or lotus and is clearly separable in typology from the preceding two types (Fig. 6). The identity of this third Bodhisattva is intriguing. The fact that it is not just another form of Maitreya or Siddhārtha is testified by a relief in the Taxila Museum, where standing images of these three types are placed side by side, each along with a Buddha.39 Although it is not theoretically impos- sible to identify it as one of the Past Buddhas other than Śakyamuni, in the stage of a Bodhisattva, there is no supportive evidence at all, as no such Bodhisattvas have ever been represented in Buddhist art anywhere. The can- didate should be, then, found among numerous Bodhisattvas referred to in Mahãyãna scriptures. Considering its importance reflected in the impressive size and form, it should be especially among those that became the object of ardent worship. A number of scholars have suspected that this type most prob- ably represented Avalokitešvara, who was indisputably the most popular Bodhisattva throughout the sphere of Mahãyãna Buddhism and was popular- ly worshiped in Indian Buddhism and possibly in Gandhāra as well.40 It has also been pointed out that the lotus was a distinctive attribute commonly held by Avalokitešvara in later Indian and early Chinese Buddhist art. Images of this type, or possibly Avalokitešvara, exist in much smaller numbers than Maitreya, and generally exhibit inferior quality with somewhat decadent styl- istic features. This may suggest that this type appeared in Gandhāran art at a relatively late stage. Another type, which holds a book, presumably a scripture, is discernible, and it possibly represents a fourth Bodhisattva (Fig. 7). Because of its dis- tinctive attribute, one is naturally tempted to identify it as Maftjuśri, obviously one of the most prominent Bodhisattvas in early Mahãyãna scriptures. The iconography of Manjuśri characterized by a scripture is generally known from relatively late textual sources of the esoteric Buddhist phase, and such visual representations became common in a later esoteric context.41 But the Wenshushiri 39 Pakistan Gandhara bijutsuten (zuroku) 1984, pl. 1-1 1. This piece has been discussed in Miyaji 1992, pp. 255-256 and Rhi 2004. 40 Even Takata Osamu, who characteristically plays down the presence of Mahayana ele- ments in Gandhāran art, accepts this type as Avalokitešvara. Takata 1979, pp. 1 1-30. 41 Mallmann 1964, pp. 26-30.

Overall in extant Bodhisattva images of Gandhãra, Maitreya takes the absolute majority, followed by Siddhārtha, Avalokitešvara, and perhaps Manjuśri. The cult of the exclusive Mahãyãna Bodhisattvas seems to have emerged in Gandhāran Buddhism during a relatively late phase and on a lim- ited scale. The dedication of larger statues of Siddhārtha is also notable. While it is natural that Maitreya is worshiped in the form of a Bodhisattva, the cult of Śakyamuni did not necessarily have to take the form of the worship of Prince Siddhārtha. I suspect that in order to attain greater merit, one would have wished to dedicate an image of Śakyamuni in a fully enlightened form. Although it might be argued that this was still due to a biographical concern, I wonder whether any strain of thought that attached great importance to the Bodhisattva' s practice prior to his enlightenment, as emphasized in Mahãyãna, might have underlain the making and dedication of Siddhārtha images. Triads Another conspicuous group in relation to Mahãyãna is small reliefs carved with Buddha triads, in which the Buddha is seated on a large lotus blossom with his right shoulder bare, making the dharmacakramudrā, and flanked by a Bodhisattva (either standing or seated) on each side (Fig. 8).44 In the triads with standing Bodhisattvas as attendants, one of the Bodhisattvas is invari- ably Maitreya. The other holds, in many examples, a wreath or a lotus, thus conforming to the supposed Avalokitešvara type, or occasionally has his left hand on the waist like the standing Siddhārtha type. In the latter case, it is 42 T463, 14:481a. This sutra is known to have been translated by Nie Daozhen between 280-3 1 2 CE. See Bussho kaisetsu daijiten, vol. 1 1 , pp. 30d-3 1 a. 43 Anna Quagliotti also identifies a Bodhisattva figure holding a book carved in a relief in the Victoria and Albert Museum as Manjuśri. Quagliotti 1990, pp. 99-1 12. 44 Miyaji Akira has done considerable rudimentary work on the objects particularly in the identification of Bodhisattvas. Miyaji 1985, pp. 7-24. 166</page><page sequence="16">RHI: EARLY MAHÃYÃNA AND GANDHĀRAN BUDDHISM possible that the raised right hand originally held a wreath or a lotus, but this cannot be verified because the right hands are usually broken. The majority of these triads, then, seem to have consisted of a central Buddha and the Bodhisattvas Maitreya and Avalokitešvara, or Maitreya and Siddhārtha. Presented in a close relationship with these Bodhisattvas, the central Buddha is most likely Śakyamuni, and scenes from his life carved on the base of some triads support this supposition. Temptation has been high particularly among Japanese scholars since Higuchi Takayasu (probably influenced by the preva- lent Amitābha cult in their Buddhist tradition) to regard Gandhāran triads as a prototype for the Amitābha triad, which greatly flourished in East Asia.45 Yet, the central Buddha in this format is hardly identifiable as Amitābha - unless a considerable deviation from the orthodox textual tradition was in practice, which seems most unlikely in this instance - because one of the attendant figures is Maitreya, not Mahasthāmaprāpta as it should be in the standard Amitābha triad. Triads with seated Bodhisattvas generally appear to be dated later than those with standing Bodhisattvas. Although the identity of the Bodhisattvas is not easily recognizable because very few extant examples have both fig- ures preserved, the same Maitreya- Avalokitešvara combination seems to have been employed in examples of this format as well. But in one exception, a triad in the Indian Museum, Calcutta, a Bodhisattva holding a book appears together with another one holding a lotus; so this triad perhaps is composed of Mafljuśri and Avalokitešvara flanking a Buddha, possibly Śakyamuni. In any case, the inclusion of Avalokitešvara indicates that many of these triads were most probably dedications by Mahãyãnists and that Śakyamuni Buddha, here, was presented in the Mahãyãna context. An extremely inter- esting motif in this regard is the large lotus blossom, conspicuously empha- sized as the seat of the central Buddha. Although it was sometimes interpreted as ground for the identification of the Buddha as Amitābha, a lotus as a throne appears in a much wider and more generic context in Mahãyãna scriptures, not particularly restricted to Amitābha' s Sukhāvatī. It is frequently referred to as the seat for a Buddha, where the Buddha performs a miracle or preach- es the dharma of Mahãyãna. A famous passage in the Dazhidu lun ( Mahāprajnāpāramitopadesa ), which most probably delivers the general notion from India no matter where 45 Higuchi 1950; Hayashi 1986, pp. 76-101; Iwamatsu 1994, pp. 209-46. 167</page><page sequence="17">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 the text itself was actually compiled, explains the significance of such a lotus seat in the following manner: "Why does the Buddha necessarily sit on a lotus while he could sit on a mat?" "[That is because] the mat is a conventional seat for the ordinary people in the world. The lotus is tender and pure, and the Buddha wishes to show his supernatural power by sitting on it with- out breaking it off. Also he wishes to adorn the seat of the lotus of fine dharma. Also all other flowers are small and not comparable to a lotus in fragrance, purity and size."46 This is followed by an account that the lotus seat of the Buddha is hundreds of thousands of times more magnificent, pure and fragrant than any other lotuses in the world, and the Buddha preaches on the six pāramitās, seated on such a lotus throne. The lotus seat is thus presented as a symbol for the mirac- ulous power possessed by the Buddha and his supramundane nature.47 The reference to such a magnificent lotus seat, commonly depicted as a "thousand-petaled lotus ( sahasrapattrapadma )," is found profusely in Mahãyãna scriptures, but quite rarely in non-Mahāyāna ones. An exception may be the account of the Great Miracle at Šrāvastī in some textual traditions, in which the Buddha is referred to as having performed diverse miracles seated on a thousand-petaled lotus to defeat the heretics. But it seems to have resulted from considerable influence from similar accounts in Mahãyãna scriptures.48 Despite its enormous importance in scriptural sources, the lotus was sel- dom used as the seat of a Buddha in early Indian Buddhist art until it began to appear prominently in the Buddha triads of Gandhāra, possibly during the second half of the second century. As regards this interesting development, it is extremely intriguing that we find remarks on the dedication of a Buddha image on a lotus in several Mahãyãna scriptures, which are summarized in the following: 46 T1509, 25:1 15c-16a. 47 Lamotte 1980, pp. 389-96. We should also note that the lotus was a popular symbol relat- ed to birth or creation in India (Zimmer 1946, pp. 90-102, cf. Miyaji 1971, pp. 57-58). Read in this manner, the preaching Buddha on a lotus in a visual image would give an impression that the role of the Buddha as a teacher or savior has been activated or the Buddha is born in such a role. 48 Rhi 1993, pp. 189-91, cf.

The translation in the former reads: ". . . the Bodhisattvas accomplish four acts to accept spontaneous generation upon lotus seats in front of me.* What are the four?

These texts invariably encourage a Bodhisattva, i.e., a Mahãyãnist, to make a Buddha figure seated on a lotus. The fact that these remarks appear in sev- eral texts in a virtually identical manner suggests that such dedication was widely practiced among Mahãyãnists. Interestingly enough, the Sumatidā- rikāpariprcchā, Vimaladattāpariprcchā and Bhadrakalpika-sūtra were all translated into Chinese by Dharmaraksa in the late third century, and their originals may not date much earlier. This date seems to coincide with that of Gandhāran triads, which I suppose were created during the third and fourth centuries. Presumably, Dharmaraksa obtained the originals of the three texts somewhere in Central Asia during his travels in the region, and that area then was under the enormous influence from the Northwest of the subcontinent.53 Although the Gandhāran examples are not single Buddha images but triads, the "Buddha image seated on a lotus" as prescribed in the texts does not nec- essarily mean that the image should consist of a single figure. It is difficult to tell whether the making of such images was following the textual prescrip- tion or the texts were reporting the current practice, even though I am tempt- ed to see that the latter was the case. In any case, I believe that the popular dedication of such Gandhāran triads was closely related to these textual accounts and that its implication would be best understood with the help of textual historians through the careful investigation of the texts, which unfor- tunately have received little substantial attention in previous scholarship.54 This type of triads was extremely popular in Gandhāran monasteries dur- 51 T425 (Dharmaraksa), 14:6c-7a. 52 T1660 (Dharmagupta), 32:536c. 53 Regarding Dharmaraksa and his travels in Central Asia, see Boucher 1998a, especially pp. 41-43, cf. Zürcher 1972, pp. 65-70. 54 Dharmaraksa's translations are briefly reviewed in Boucher 1998a, pp. 261 (no. 2), pp. 72-273 (no. 26), p. 277 (no. 45). Kumārajīva's translation of the Sumatidārikāpariprcchā (T335) is almost identical with Dharmaraksa's (T334), and Boucher is of the opinion that the former appears to be a mere reworking of the latter. One should note, however, that Kumārajīva's text has a passage of considerable length inserted in the back, which is not found in any other versions. It should also be pointed out that in terms of the structure, the Sumatidārikāpariprcchā and the Vimaladattāpariprcchā are closely related each other and to a certain extent to the Bhadrakalpika-sūtra as well. 170</page><page sequence="20">RHI: EARLY M AHÃYÃN A AND G ANDHĀRAN BUDDHISM ing the third and fourth centuries (Fig. 9). In this period, triads seem to have been favored as popular dedications over larger independent statues. They were usually in a simple format in which a Buddha was flanked by two Bodhisattvas along with Brahma and Indra placed in between, but they were occasionally magnified in size and elaborated in composition and details, the three figures frequently being placed inside a lavishly decorated pavilion.55 It is also interesting to note that Buddha triads with a lotus seat in a simi- lar form greatly flourished in the western Deccan caves during the fifth and sixth centuries (Fig. 10). In these triads, the Buddha is likewise seated on a lotus, making the dharmacakramudrā and flanked by two attendant Bodhisattvas on a lotus. Numerous reliefs of such triads were carved in the caves at Ajantā, Kānheri, Kārlī, Aurangabad, Ellora and Kuda. They are regarded as intrusive carvings added on the walls of a cave in a rather disor- derly manner once the sanctuary had been consecrated, and appear to have been popular dedications for the attainment of merit. Dated in the so-called Mahãyãna phase in this region, they are generally thought to be the dedica- tions by Mahãyãnists. The western Deccan examples could have been inspired by the Gandhāran examples, which are datable earlier by one or two centuries, and both were most likely a common form of popular dedication by Mahãyãnists in the two different regions. Steles of Complex Scenes Still there would be no question that the most intriguing piece in the problem of Mahãyãna in Gandhāran art is the stele from Mohamed-Nari in Lahore Museum (Fig. 1 1). The impressive size, a little over 1 meter high, and elab- orate design with many interesting details, set this stele apart from ordinary narrative reliefs or even triads, although the composition seems to have been expanded on the basis of the triad format. Its center is occupied by a Buddha making the dharmacakramudrā, seated on a gigantic lotus protruding out of the water, perhaps a lotus pond, and surrounded by what appear to be a mul- titude of Bodhisattvas. Although the scene was identified as the depiction of the Great Miracle at Šrāvastī by Alfred Foucher at the beginning of the twen- tieth century, its true identity has been a controversial issue, and a number of 55 Ingholt and Lyons 1957, pl. 257; Kurita 1988, vol. 1, pls. 396, 398, 401. 56 Foucher 1917, pp. 148-84. Various opinions by other scholars are cited in Rhi 1991, pp. 316-23. 171</page><page sequence="21">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 alternatives have been presented.56 As I previously discussed in detail in com- parison with the accounts of the legend in various textual sources, it seems hardly possible that this scene represents the Great Miracle.57 Probably the most notable alternative has been the idea that it represents Amitābha's Pure Land, Sukhāvatī. It is true that there is a remarkable resemblance between this scene and later representations of Sukhāvatī in East Asia such as in a mural in Cave 332 in Dunhuang. This made some scholars, particularly among Japanese, suggest early on that the stele may depict Sukhāvatī, beginning with Minamoto Toyomune already in the 1920s.58 But it was in 1980 when John Huntington argued for the identification of Sukhāvatī, citing the accounts of the Larger Sukhâvatîvyûha as a textual source that this idea came to receive more serious attention.59 What distinguishes Huntington's approach from the previous ones is that it focuses on finding a connection between the image and the textual account through the careful reading of a relevant text rather than citing the resem- blance between the Mohamed-Nari stele and the East Asian parallels. His arguments may be summarized in four points. First, in the second row of the upper right-hand corner, a Buddha apparently speaks to a person, probably a monk, and this should be read as Śakyamuni displaying the magnificent view of Sukhāvatī to Ananda as recounted in the Larger Sukhâvatîvyûha. Second, a Buddha surrounded by a number of smaller Buddhas in the form of an aure- ole in both the left and right upper-hand corners represents a Buddha emit- ting light in which numerous nirmāņabuddhas are present, again as stated in the Larger Sukhâvatîvyûha. Third, a man and a woman in secular dress stand- ing on a lotus in each side of the lotus seat of the central Buddha are people reborn in Sukhāvatī. Fourth, a number of birds in pavilions and on the lotus pond are representations of beautiful birds inhabiting Sukhāvatī as described in the same text. Ingenious as they may be, Huntington's arguments are not particularly convincing. As regards the fourth point, birds on the roofs of buildings are commonly seen in Gandhāran art in numerous scenes that obviously have nothing to do with Sukhāvatī. For the second point, the account of numerous nirmāņābuddhas in the light emanating from the Buddha is not specific to the Pure Land sūtras of Amitābha, but extensively found in many other Mahãyãna sūtras. 57 Rhi 1991. 58 Minamoto 1925, p. 51; Minamoto 1926, pp. 67-69. 172</page><page sequence="22">RHI: EARLY MAHÃYÃNA AND GANDHĀRAN BUDDHISM The third point is interesting because a lotus was seldom used in Gandhāran art as a seat for lay people, who do not appear to be Bodhisattvas at a con- siderably high stage. It should be noted that the two figures are the only ones in the scene that do not have halos. But neither Huntington nor the support- ers of his view were able to resolve the puzzle that there should be suppos- edly no women in Sukhāvatī. Although diverse recensions of the Larger Sukhâvatîvyûha considerably vary in contents, the absence of women in Sukhāvatī is a feature consistent in all the extant versions. To have noticed the small scene of "the Buddha speaking to a person" as discussed in the first point is probably the most important contribution in Huntington's thesis (Fig. 12). This part of the composition seems certainly of a different order from the rest of the overall scene and could be interpreted, as Huntington does, as directing a worshiper to the vision of the central Buddha or his surroundings (probably a buddhafield). The problem is that it cannot be easily determined who directs the worshiper and whose buddha- field it is. Gregory Schopen, questioning Huntington's identification, point- ed out that it may well be read as Śakyamuni directing Ānanda to the vision of Abhirati of Aksobhya as stated in a number of recensions of the Prajnāpāramitā-sūtra , but that the stele may represent neither Abhirati nor Sukhāvatī.60 1 may also cite, in support of Abhirati, the Aksobhyavyüha where Śakyamuni shows Abhirati to Śariputra.61 By this I do not mean, like Schopen, that the central Buddha in the Mohamed-Nari stele is Aksobhya in Abhirati, not Amitābha in Sukhāvatī; rather I simply wish to point out that Huntington's argument does not hold for the identification with Amitābha and that the scene in question could be deciphered in a variety of ways. It is equally possible to read it as one of the past Buddhas giving vyãkarana to a previous incarnation of Śakyamuni and displaying the vision of his buddhafield. Or one could view it as a kind of entreaty to preach, by which the Buddha is activated as a great teacher in a magnificent form residing in his buddhafield. Aware of the shortcomings in Huntington's arguments, several other schol- 59 Huntington 1980. 60 Schopen 1987, pp. 130-31, n. 50. 61 T313, 1 1:759c. Schopen cites the Tibetan version of the Aksobhyavyüha where Subhūti, not Śakyamuni, shows Abhirati to Ānanda, and admits that this raises no difficulties for Huntington (see n. 59). However, in the Chinese version, probably a much earlier recension supposedly translated by Lokaksema, it is clearly Śakyamuni that shows Abhirati to Śariputra and this would coincide with the accounts from the Praj nāpār amitā-sūtr as which Schopen cites. 173</page><page sequence="23">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 ars have attempted to support the identification of the Mohamed-Nari stele with Sukhāvatī by sometimes bringing in the accounts from other Sukhāvatī texts; but none seems to have been particularly successful. Anna Maria Quagliotti, for instance, identifies the scene of the "Buddha speaking to a per- son" as the Indrasailagūha , which, she interprets, signifies "teaching of the higher order imparted to Ānanda/Šāriputra," i.e., the vision of Sukhāvatī.62 However, there is no explanation why the "teaching of the higher order" imparted through the Indrašailagūha , even if the latter theme indeed played such a role, had to be particularly the vision of Sukhāvatī, for we do not find any necessary connection between the two in the textual tradition. Quagliotti also suggests that such motifs as nãgas on each side of the gigantic lotus throne may be an allusion to Šrāvastī - where the Great Miracle was performed and where Śakyamuni led Śariputra to the vision, as specified in the Smaller Sukhâvatîvyûha , not as in the Larger Sukhâvatîvyuha in which the locality was Rājagrha.63 But one wonders why such miscellaneous details related to the Great Miracle, but not essentially to the scene of Sukhāvatī, had to be incorporated in its depiction. Some textual specialists try to explain various motifs in the Mohamed-Nari scene in the light of the earliest extant recension of the Larger Sukhâvatîvyûha in Chinese translations, not the later Sanskrit version Huntington referred to.64 However, their attempts have been equally unsuccessful - at least for now. This seems most revealing in the fact that each scholar connects various motifs in the stele in a different way to the text, although they resort to the same text as their source. Besides Sukhāvatī, a number of scholars presented a variety of interpreta- tions regarding the identity of the Mohamed-Nari stele. Even the usually skep- tical Takata Osamu describes it as "the scene of the Buddha preaching that presupposes the development of Mahãyãna ideas in its background."65 Koezuka Takashi calls it "the scene of the Buddha preaching to the multitude of listeners with miraculous occurrences, prefiguring the illustration of 62 Quagliotti 1996, pp. 284-87. 63 Ibid., p. 287. 64 Aramaki 1999; Aramaki 2003; Harrison 2000.

Despite some disagreement in this issue, I admit I have been enormously inspired by their works, and hope to be able to read their arguments in a more convincing form in the future. 65 Takata 1967, p. 263. 174</page><page sequence="24">RHI: EARLY MAHÃYÃNA AND G ANDHĀR AN BUDDHISM Mahãyãna sūtras."66 John Rosenfield, pointing out its affinities with the ac- counts in the Samdhinirmocana-sūtra, the Saddharmapuņdarīka-sūtra and the Mahāprajnāpāramitopadesa, characterizes it as "the symbol of the imma- nence and power of the Buddhist pantheon" inspired by Mahãyãna.67 Odani Nakao brings in, for comparison, the description of the magnificent spectacle of miraculous occurrences from the "Introduction" chapter of the Sad- dharmapuņdarīka. 68 More recently Miyaji Akira, who has done considerable work on this issue, confirms the view that the stele represents the miracle of the Buddha emitting extensive light recounted in various Mahãyãna sūtras such as the Saddharmapundarïka or the Tathāgatagarbha-sūtra, but not nec- essarily based on any particular scripture.69 Although none would be conclu- sive, each of these seems to point out rightly in its own way the spirit that prominently permeates the Mohamed-Nari scene. Iconography is a game of probability unless one has definitive proof, which is extremely hard to secure in most cases. The identification of the Mohamed-Nari stele with Sukhāvatī does not seem any more plausible from the present evidence than other alter- natives. Perhaps we may never be able to find a single textual source for the scene in the Mohamed-Nari stele without the support of explicit literary or epi- graphical evidence. The textual source may have been one that is hardly read in present Buddhist scholarship; or it may have been permanently lost. Or there may never have been, from the outset, a single textual source for the image. The more carefully and extensively one reads Mahãyãna scriptures, the more one finds what may be possibly - but perhaps not actually - asso- ciate with the Mohamed-Nari stele. It may not be an exaggeration to say that the entire Mahãyãna scriptures are full of such descriptions and accounts. Here is one such passage from the chapter "The Emerging of the Tathāgata" (Tat h ā gat ab hu ta ta t hâtai) of the Avatamsaka-sūtra : When the world is first created, the great water-wheels fill the three thousand/great thousand worlds. A great lotus called the "Emerg- ing of the Tathāgata" appears, adorned with great treasures. It cov- ers the three thousand/great thousand worlds, illuminating all the 66 Koe/uka 1985, p. 280. 67 Rosenfield 1967, pp. 236-38. 68 Odani 1967, p. 96. 69 Miyaji 2002, pp. 19-20, cf.

At the time, devas such as Suddhavasadeva and Mahešvara, seeing the lotus, definitely realize that all the Buddhas will appear in the world like lotus blossom.70 [Then, the wind-wheels by various names are activated and create various realms, heavenly palaces, mountains, seas, treasures, trees, etc.] . . . Likewise, the Tathägata-arhat-samyaksambuddha appears in this world with all the great roots. [He emits the great lights by various names and thus gives vyãkarana to all the Bodhisattvas, who will become Buddhas by various names.]71 I do not intend to present this passage as a possible textual source for the Mohamed-Nari stele, but merely point out that this kind of idea among many could well have been incorporated in the image. Still, this account seems to coincide better with probably the most prominent feature in the Mohamed- Nari stele, the lotus blossom protruding out of the water. We almost have the vision of the Buddha emerging, being seated on the lotus and activated in the role of preaching, perhaps awakened from a self-contained samādhi. Regardless of its textual source, I have a strong feeling that the Mohamed- Nari stele is related to a samādhi experience. Whether it was a visual recre- ation of the experience or a visual aid to such an experience is hard to tell. It could have been both. It reminds one so much of a vision that a practitioner may have had in a samādhi, which in its turn would have been influenced by what he/she previously had read, seen and heard. Then, it could have been transferred into a visual image by means of available artistic conventions; the visual image thus created could have served as a device that helped other prac- titioners experience the samādhi. In this regard, the pratyutpanna-samädhi, or pratyutpanna-buddha-sam- mukhāvasthita-samādhi, which Paul Harrison translates "the samādhi of Direct Encounter with the Buddhas of the Present," greatly interests us. It is of course not clear whether the Pratyutpannasamädhi-sütra was known in Gandhāra. But it is intriguing that we find in it a passage similar to the ones we noted above from the Sumatidārikāpariprcchā, Vimaladattāpariprcchā 70 In the Koryo edition this phrase reads "ruo lianhua shu (like the number of lotuses), and it should be translated, "Buddhas as many as the lotuses appear in the world." But all the later three Chinese editions from Song, Yuan and Ming have the character "/« fť' (to blossom) instead of "shu"; my translation follows this, since it seems to make better sense. 71 T278, 9:613b-14a, cf. T279, 10:262a-c; T291,10:596c-597b. This passage is stated as one (the 8th) of the ten conditions for the emergence of a Buddha and the lengthiest one. 176</page><page sequence="26">RHI: EARLY M AHÃYÃN A AND GANDHĀRAN BUDDHISM and Bhadrakalpika-sūtra as regards the "making of a Buddha image seated on a lotus." The Pratyutpannasamädhi-sütra enumerates a series of four dhar- mas to be practiced with a view to quickly attaining the samādhi , and in one of the sets the making of a Buddha image is listed. (1) Making of a Buddha image or a picture . (2) Taking a fine piece of silk and copying this samādhi(-sūtra). (3) Leading conceited people to the Buddha's way. (4) Always preserving the Buddha's dharma.72 The structure is quite similar to those of the three sūtras, and even closer to that of the Bhadrakalpikasütra in the content of the four dharmas and the state- ment of its purpose as "quickly attaining a samādhi ." Although other aspects of the texts should be carefully examined in order to clarify this connection, I suspect a possibility that the accounts of the making of a Buddha on a lotus found in these three sūtras have their origin in an account like the one in the Pratyutpannasamädhi-sütra. We may recall that the complex scenes such as the Mohamed-Nari stele are most probably derived from the triad format, which is identifiable with the "Buddha image on a lotus." If the triad was a popular form of Mahãyãnist dedication encouraged in the three sūtras, one developed out of an earlier form as prescribed in the Pratyutpannasamädhi- sütra, , could the larger complex scenes possibly have been a recreation of the vision of the Buddha a practitioner attained in such a samādhi?73 Although this may be a conjecture by a specialist in visual monuments, it would be wor- thy of more serious exploration with the help of textual specialists. This sup- position, of course, does not mean that the Pratyutpannasamädhi-sütra was the source for the Mohamed-Nari stele, but merely indicates that an idea, not a textual account, similar to the one as we find in this sūtra, was possibly incorporated in the image. The question remains, then: Who is the central Buddha in the Mohamed- Nari stele? It may perhaps have been Amitābha, if we note its relative impor- tance in the context of the Pratyutpannasamädhi-sütra ; but Amitābha is 72 T418, 13:906a, cf. Harrison, trans. 1998, pp. 23-24; also see T419, 13:923a; T416, 13:877b; Harrison, ed. 1978, p. 27; cf. Harrison 1990, p. 32. 73 The earliest Chinese translation, the Banzhou sanmei jing (T4 1 8) is attributed to Lokaksema and dated to c. 1 79 CE. Paul Harrison tentatively dates this sūtra some time between the begin- ning of the Common Era and 179 CE. (Harrison 1990, p. xvii). It is quite possible that the sūtra was known in the Northwest and particularly during the second to fourth centuries when the complex steles were created. 177</page><page sequence="27">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 merely adduced in this text as an example, the Buddha of the Present par excellence .74 Could it be instead any Buddha of the Present whom a practi- tioner could visualize in a samādhii Here, one needs to recall that Buddha images in Gandhāra were presented in an essentially identical manner, that is to say, iconographically indistinguishable. Again, if the iconographie dis- tinction did not matter, the individuality of Buddhas may not have mattered seriously either, as we suspected with Buddha images. If the Mohamed-Nari scene is to be a depiction of Sukhāvatī, one should be able to find distinctive features of that buddhafield, which unfortunately do not seem securely rec- ognizable. On the contrary, the gigantic lotus throne, so prominent a feature in the Mohamed-Nari stele, is actually not referred to in any of the two prin- cipal texts of the Amitābha cult, the Larger Sukhâvatîvyûha or the Smaller Sukhâvatîvyûha , as the seat of Amitābha, despite the fact that it is stated invariably as the seat of those who are reborn in Sukhāvatī.75 I am tempted to read the Buddhas in each upper corner as those in other buddhafields or the rest of the Buddhas of the Present. Two pairs of Bo- dhisattvas in the pavilions perhaps represent those in different stages, the preaching, crossed-legged pose above the pensive pose, as I have noted their hierarchical difference elsewhere.76 A man and a woman standing in each side of the lotus throne could be practitioners who gained rebirth on a lotus throne now meeting the Buddha, as stated in the Sumatidārikāpariprcchā and Vimaladattāpariprcchā.11 74 Harrison, trans. 1998, pp. 2-3. 75 The lotus throne is indeed recounted with prominence in the Guan wuliangshoufo jing as one of the sixteen visualizations (T365, 12:342c-343a), but the relevance of the Guan-jing to the early Mahäyäna in Gandhāra during the second-fourth centuries is not at all clear. 76 Rhi 2004. 77 See above ns. 49, 50. In the Sumatidārikāpariprcchā a practitioner makes a Buddha image to attain upapãduka seated on a lotus in front of the "king of Dharma" (or the "Buddha" in Bodhiruci's translation). The Vimaladattāpariprcchā simply states the "attaining of upa- pãduka ," although Gautama Prajnāruci's translation has an additional phrase, "constantly remaining in the place (or land) of the Buddha." Although the remark on the attaining of upapãduka (in front of the Buddha or in the land of the Buddha) strongly reminds one of the rebirth in Sukhāvatī and Amitābha, intriguingly enough, neither the place nor the Buddha (or the king of dharma) is specified. Could this be another sign that the Buddha or the buddha- field (where a practitioner is to be reborn) stated in the texts can be any Buddha or buddha- field or that they are generic Buddhas or buddhafields, unspecified or yet to be specified. It would be interesting to note in this regard that even the Smaller Sukhâvatîvyûha states at the end, although briefly, other Buddhas and buddhafields equal to Amitābha and Sukhāvatī. I would not rule out the possibility that the Mohamed-Nari stele was the representation of Sukhāvatī but not in the way it has been argued in previous scholarship. 178</page><page sequence="28">RHI: EARLY MAHÃYÃNA AND G ANDHĀRAN BUDDHISM Besides the Mohamed-Nari stele, several more such steles are extant in complete or fragmentary forms (Fig. 13).78 They do not seem to belong to the stage of the most vigorous activities in Gandhāran art, and could be datable to the third century (at the earliest) or afterwards. Similar complex scenes of the Buddha seated on a gigantic lotus surrounded by numerous Buddhas, Bodhisattvas and devas are also found in the western Deccan caves, most prominently in Kānheri (Fig. 15). It is possible that they were created with similar implications and functions like the Gandhāran examples. Mahäyäna in Gandhāran Monasteries In this brief survey, I have presented a number of iconographie types that could be possibly identified as Mahãyãnist dedications in Gandhāra, in which certain Bodhisattva types, Buddha triads and steles of complex scenes were most prominent. On stylistic grounds, they obviously do not belong to the early phase of Gandhāran art, but seem to have been increasingly popular dur- ing the third and fourth centuries, when the dedication of larger, independent statues was considerably in decline. Besides, the Dīparņkara-jātaka and the flourishing of image worship, though not themes exclusively in Mahäyäna, could be potentially interpreted in positive terms in relation to Mahäyäna. In what manner, then, did these visual materials have bearing on the way Mahãyãnists existed in Gandhāra? If we investigate the provenance of triads and steles of complex scenes, they originated, surprisingly enough, from quite a limited number of monastery sites. Buddha triads and steles of complex scenes assembled in my database and dependable enough in authenticity (since an enormous number of fakes are circulating even in scholarly publi- cations) amount to 109 pieces.79 There may be some pieces not counted here, but their number must be quite small. Of the 109 pieces, 13 are from Takht- i-Bāhī, 36 from four mounds (A-D) at Sahrī-Bahlol, 6 from Loriyän-Tangai, and 3 from Mohamed-Nari. Ten other pieces come from Jamālgarhī (2), the Tordha village, Yakubi (both in S wābi), Jauliān (2), Dharmarājikā (2) (both in Taxila), Muftipur, and an unknown site in Swat. The provenance of the remaining 41 pieces is unknown, but a number of them show distinctive styl- istic features attributable to Takht-i-Bāhī, Sahrī-Bahlol or Loriyän-Tangai. 78 Another complete piece is in the Chandigarh Museum (Kurita 1988, pl. 399). Numerous fragments that once formed part of such complex steles are known through photographs kept in the Archaeological Survey of India and the India Office Library. 79 See the list in Rhi 1991, pp. 197-204. 179</page><page sequence="29">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 The absolute majority of the pieces whose provenance is known (56 out of 68) originated from the Peshawar basin. Furthermore, they are concentrated (52 out of 56) in Takht-i-Bāhī, four monasteries of Sahri-Bahlol and Mohamed-Nari in the northern part of the Peshawar basin (Fig. 14). Another important provenance site, Loriyän-Tangai, is located near the Shāhkot pass over the Mālākand range toward the Swat region, but it had a strong tie in sculptural style with Takht-i-Bāhī and Sahri-Bahlol rather than with the Swat region. The apparent concentration of triads and steles of complex scenes in Takht-i-Bāhī, Sahri-Bahlol and Loriyän-Tangai may be partly due to the fact that these sites - excepting Loriyän-Tangai - were excavated in a relatively (although not very) scientific manner and thus their finds are fairly well documented.80 However, the fact that only two pieces are known from Jamālgarhī, another important provenance site of stone sculpture in the Peshawar basin along with Takht-i-Bāhī and Sahri-Bahlol, seems to indicate that these statistics are significant enough.81 Not just triads and steles of complex scenes but larger statues of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas have also been abundantly discovered at Takht-i-Bāhī and Sahri-Bahlol. Indeed these two places are indisputably the most important provenance in Gandhāran art along with Loriyän-Tangai and Jamālgarhī at least in stone statues. The dedication of images was particularly prominent here, and two larger groups among the four dominant stylistic types of Buddha images I have identified were related to these two places.82 A series of "aligned chapels" surrounding a stūpa or a stūpa court, which is rarely found outside the Peshawar basin, was an important, distinctive structure in the monasteries of these places designed to install an enormously large number of statues discovered there. Many of the Bodhisattva images identified above as Avalokitešvara also came from these two places. In many ways, the monas- teries at Takht-i-Bāhī and Sahri-Bahlol are highly important for our concern. Neither place is recorded in any of the currently known literary sources. 80 Spooner 1906-07 (1909), pp. 102-18; Spooner 1907-08 (1911), pp. 132-48; Spooner 1909-10 (1914), pp. 46-62; Hargreaves 1910- 1 1 (1914), pp. 34-39; Stein 191 1-12 (1915), pp. 95-1 19.

I have a hypothesis that what we normally call Gandhāran sculpture was regionally quite a limited phenomenon in actu- ality. 180</page><page sequence="30">RHI: EARLY MAHÃYÃNA AND G ANDHĀRAN BUDDHISM Takht-i-Bāhī is probably the best preserved - or most-extensively recon- structed (in recent years) - site in the Peshawar basin and consists of many sectors constructed and composed on an impressive scale; it is somewhat strange that it evaded the attention of Chinese pilgrims. Remains at Sahri- Bahlol consist of some ten monastery sites, on a smaller scale than Takht-i- Bāhī, surrounding a large mound where the present Sahrī-Bahlol village is located.83 Nothing is known regarding the relationship among the monaster- ies at Takht-i-Bāhī and Sahrī-Bahlol, which are only one kilometer from each other, and the relationship between the monasteries surrounding the Sahrī- Bahlol village. But the sculptural finds from these two places exhibit close affinities in style and iconographie themes, hardly distinguishable in most instances, and thus they seem to have had a close connection in whatever man- ner. Mohamed-Nari, famous for the complex stele in Lahore Museum dis- cussed above, is located not far from Takht-i-Bāhī and Sahrī-Bahlol, although the exact location of the monastery is unknown. Also at another important site, Loriyän-Tangai, numerous statues of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas (including a number of those identifiable as Avalokitešvara) were found along with Buddha triads. Stone sculptures from this site, which display distinctive stylistic features, are generally dated later than those from the most active period at Takht-i-Bāhī and Sahri-Bahlol. Most artifacts from this site were excavated by J.E. Caddy in 1896, but little doc- umentation is preserved regarding the site itself, and even its exact location is no longer known. How could the sculptural finds that I suppose to be Mahãyãnist dedications have found their way to these monasteries in such large numbers? Were they, then, Mahãyãna monasteries? These sites yielded, however, absolutely no epigraphical evidence to support this supposition. On the contrary, a potsherd found at Takht-i-Bāhī has a dedicatory inscription that could possibly be read as having been intended for the Kaśyapiya,84 and this may indicate that this monastery was affiliated to this school, which we would normally regard as non-Mahāyāna. In four inscriptions from Sahrī-Bahlol (Mounds 1085, A, B, 83 Tissot 1983 (1985), pp. 567-614. 84 Konow 1929, no. XXII. Konow read in this inscription, " samghe chadudise ka . . ." (in the samgha of the four quarters). There is no question regarding this reading. Konow interprets "ka . . as " Kasyaviyana " ( = Kāšyapīyānām). In Kharosthi inscriptions, the phrase samghe chadudise was usually followed by the words indicating the place and the school. Therefore, "ka ..." equally could have been a place name. But this formula appears most frequently in the inscriptions of the Kaśyapiya, and this inscription would have continued like "Kãsyapiyãnãm parigraheT 181</page><page sequence="31">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 C), Sten Konow noted a similar pattern, and suspected that they had also orig- inally contained the word Kaśyapiya.85 Although Konow' s supposition is not altogether free from question, it seems plausible because the sites at Sahri- Bahlol were closely related to Takht-i-Bāhī in many aspects. Out of ten inscriptions from the Northwest that record the name of nikâyas, five belong to the Kaśyapiya (besides Takht-i-Bāhī and Sahri-Bahlol, from Palātu-Dherī and Bedadi in the Peshawar basin and Mahāl in Taxila),86 while five others belong to the Sarvāstivāda (3), 87 the Dharmaguptaka (l)88 and the Mahā- samghika.89 The five inscriptions of the Kaśyapiya are all that are known in association with this nikäya in Indian Buddhism, and this seems to indicate that the Kaśyapiyas were quite active in this region. If the monasteries at Takht-i-Bāhī and Sahri-Bahlol belonged to the Kaśyapiya, how could such objects associated with Mahãyânists have been dedicated inside these monasteries? The central sector of Takht-i-Bāhī con- sists of three parts (Fig. 16): (1) the main stūpa court, (2) the monastic quar- ter, and (3) the court of minor stūpas located between the first two structures.90 Statues, triads, and steles were installed in image chapels surrounding the main stūpa court and the court of minor stūpas. Although they are clearly demarcated from the monastic quarter, they are closely connected to the lat- ter structurally. In order to reach the monastic quarter, one could not avoid passing through the court of minor stūpas. There seems hardly any possibil- ity that the main stūpa court and the court of minor stūpas were maintained separately from the monastic quarter. Whoever the donors may have been - be they monastics or laity - the dedication of visual images would not have been possible without the involvement of the monastics in the monastery - whether this was in the form of direct undertaking, indirect encouragement or support, or reluctant tolerance. The monastic community of Takht-i-Bāhī must have been deeply implicated in the process of making and dedicating images.

However, in the examples in which both the stūpa court and the monastic quarter are discernible, they never appear to have been separate. In these monasteries as well, the objects we equate with Mahãyãnist dedications seem to have been closely associated with the monastic community there. How should we, then, explain this apparently contradictory situation - the Mahãyãnist dedications within the monastic community that would be nor- mally defined as "non-Mahãyãna" in our traditional conception? A key to this question may lie, as I pointed out on a number of occasions, in the con- ception of the relationship between traditional nikâyas and Mahãyãnists.91 Although it has been a general notion among Buddhist scholars to view Mahãyãna as socially separate from or antagonistic to the established samgha consisting of traditional nikãyas, one feels obliged to question how much of that conception can be justified. The early Mahãyãna was apparently a reli- gious movement that consisted of a number of different groups. They may have shared the general ideal in a broad sense, but most probably never formed a single social group. Gradually they began to call themselves "Mahãyãna" and slightly later used the depreciatory word "Hinayãna" to designate the conservative group they criticized. It is questionable, however, whether "Hinayãna" ever meant the entire organization of the traditional samgha and was used in an institutional sense. If I am not mistaken, I have not yet seen any unequivocal evidence which demonstrates that the entire Mahãyãnists criticized and antagonized traditional nikãyas. Based on the situation I en- counter in visual materials from Gandhāra, I suspect that a considerable number of the early Mahãyãnists lived and were active within monasteries officially affiliated with traditional nikãyas.92 I do not rule out the possibili- ty that some Mahãyãnists could have lived in independent Mahãyãna monas- teries, as described in the Ugradattapariprcchā or the Gocarapariśuddha, which became one of the bases for Hirakawa's grand theory. But they must 91 Rhi 1991; Rhi 1996, pp. 131-166; Rhi 1999. 92 Textual specialists, Etienne Lamotte and Heinz Bechert, have also expressed similar ideas. See Lamotte 1970, pp. xiii-xiv; Bechert 1973, pp. 1 1-14. My idea based on visual materials seems to coincide with the opinions of other textual specialists such as Sasaki Shizuka and Shimoda Masahiro who participated with me in the Tõhõ Gakkai Conference: see Sasaki 2003, and Shimoda 2003. 183</page><page sequence="33">THE EASTERN BUDDHIST XXXV, 1 &amp; 2 have been quite few in number, and the majority of Mahãyãnists were based at monasteries of traditional nikãyas. The fact that no explicit epigraphical evidence for the presence of Mahãyãnists is found until the fourth century on the entire subcontinent, including the Northwest, I believe, is not due to the insignificance of their number or activity, but due to the scarcity of monasteries officially declared as Mahãyãna. As is well known, the Chinese pilgrim Faxian, who visited the Peshawar basin in 402, reported that the majority of Buddhists there studied HTnayãna.93 Although it sometimes became grounds for the skeptical assess- ment of Mahãyãna in this region,94 this testimony may well be interpreted as reporting that only a small number of Mahãyãna monasteries were declared independent from traditional nikãyas. The extent of the activity of Mahãyãnists within traditional nikãyas could have been considerably different, depending on the nikãya, region and indi- vidual monastery. For instance, a great deal of affinity has been pointed out by Buddhist scholars between Mahãyãna and the accounts in the scriptures of the Mahāsarņghika and the Dharmaguptaka. Regionally, the Northwest appears one of the prominent bases for the activity of Mahãyãnists, and par- ticularly the monasteries at Takht-i-Bāhī, Sahri-Bahlol, Mohamed-Nari and Loriyãn-Tangai stand out in this regard. The KaśyapTya, which was dominant in Gandhāra and possibly owned the monasteries at Takht-i-Bāhī and Sahri-Bahlol are also notable. Only frag- mentary information is known regarding this nikãya.95 It is reported as hav- ing been founded by a monk by the name of Kaśyapa around the first half of the first century C.E. The Samayabhedoparacanacakra describes the doc- trines of this school in five points, and indicates their similarity with those of the Dharmaguptaka, which, judged by the literary tradition, also seems to have been related to the Mahãyãna. The Jietuojie jing ( Pratimoksa-sūtra ) in Chinese translation (T1460, trans. Gautama Prajftāruci, the first half of the 6th century) is the only extant work attributed to this school. It is said that its content is quite similar to that of the Mūlasarvāstivāda-vinava. but consid- erably different from that of the Sarvãstivãda-vinaya. This point would need 93 T2085, 51:858a-b (Legge, p. 32). Faxian remarks on Gandhāra, "duo xiaocheng xue î- 'h :Jp:4l"(Many of them practice Hinayãna), while he describes in Uddiyãna, "jie xiaocheng xue (All practice HTnayãna).

But I believe it premature to conclude that Jamālgarhī has little bearing on the activity of Mahãyãnists. It may be due to the fact that the Buddhists at Jamālgarhī simply did not employ such types as Buddha triads and steles of complex scenes as a popular form of dedication.
