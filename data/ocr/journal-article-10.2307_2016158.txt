<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOL. XXVIII, No. 20. SEPTEMBER 24, 1931 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY IMPLICATIONS OF THE, LIFE OF REASON SANTAYANA'S critics have often pointed out two strands of thought in his Life of Reason: the one an Aristotelian natural- ism which he announces so eloquently in his Introduction, the other a modernistic subjectivism in the intricacies of which he in subse- quent chapters becomes deeply involved. Many have not inquired into the consistency of these two strands. Delighted with the per- suasive ethical system he legitimately unfolds, they were enthusiastic in their applause of the Aristotelian background which makes The Life of Reason so significant a philosophical development and achievement. They had tended to ignore the second strand, be- lieving that it was not to be taken seriously. They have regarded it as a mistake akin in significance to the mistake which Santayana attributes to Plato, namely, that "the technique of this combina- tion . . . adds nothing to the significance of what Plato has to say on any concrete subject." But time has shown these gentle critics to be wrong. The integral Life of Reason has been followed up by discrete Realms of Being which but display the disastrous effects -that certain curious epistemological biases have had on Santayana's Aristotelian themes. Indeed one might go on and apply to Santa- yana more of the language he uses of Plato; for his use of a sub- jectivistic framework for Aristotelian moral philosophy has been " fruitful in misunderstandings. " 1 But where with Plato it was his successors who went astray, with Santayana it has tragically enough been himself. The Life of Reason, interpreted in terms borrowed from Locke and Hume and other modern thinkers, has generated Realms of Being. And to some of Santayana 's most ardent admirers this has been a keen disappointment. Let us consider certain historical matters that are influential in forming the background of Santayana's philosophical development. By the end of the fifteenth century, the ideal luminary of Mediaeval scholasticism which borrowed its light from Plato waned, and its noon gave place to a twilight and then dimmed into a confusing night. Black clouds to overcast the sky had risen from the experi- ments of Galileo and his followers; and the early travelers of Brit- ish empiricism were only then seeking a new light to guide them in their search for truth. Despairing of the ideal light because it had 1 Reason in Common Sense, p. 25. 533</page><page sequence="2">534 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY waned and because clouds had come, forgetful even of a certain warmth it shed, they set about the preparation of a tangible candle that they might carry it with them. The attempt was commendable in its spirit, but largely futile in its outcome: Locke saw a little of the light and felt a little of the warmth, but despaired of analyzing the tallow; Berkeley saw the light, but questioned whether it came from any natural source; Hume virtually blew it out. In the mean- time the Aristotelian lamp glowed, neglected beneath the bushel. Now when Santayana started out to live his Life of Reason, he uncovered the lamp of Aristotle. He had vision enough to appre- ciate that light was light, and science enough to admit that the lamp was its natural basis; it was natural to conclude that the greater light and wvarmth of the platonic sun must somehow similarly be connected with a naturalistic mass. To a very significant degree, his Life of Reason was a success; it lyricized, refined, and in sundry respects brought up to date the factuality of Aristotle, and it did this in spite of the fact that its author had a personal attachment to the British candle that had lighted the studies of his own youth, and which indeed, now and again, flickers in the privacy of his library. We can, however, hardly understand The Life of Reason without realizing that Santayana has been preoccupied more with the quality of light than with the physics of light or the metaphysics of lamp or candle. Aristotle saw the lamp as a lamp, and he knew it by under- standing its "four causes." The light was its function, and its final cause. Thus Aristotle was a student of things, and Santayana a student primarily of final causes and of things only in so far as they are the natural bases for ideal fulfillments. Aristotle, to repeat, lived in a world of things, things he might know, and know as they were, by investigating their "four causes." Nor were these "four causes," it must be noted, arbitrarily num- bered and assigned to things as handy categories of the understand- ing. As a scientist of wide experience, Aristotle was compelled to reject as Ultimates the matter which had remained after the analyses of his forerunners. He recognized that matter, materia prima, was the residuum that remained at the close of analysis, but he saw too that it was never pure matter; it was always matter in some particular form and necessarily the material cause of the thing that was identified by its form. He could no more admit with Democritus the existence of pure matter than he could subscribe with Plato to a belief in pure form. The two were inseparable, and both the material and formal causes were requisite to the ex- istence, and hence to an understanding, of anything. Still, to a life which implies activity, the mere identification of a particular and the acknowledgment of its material make-up savor</page><page sequence="3">IMPLICATIONS OF THE LIFE OF REASON 535 too strongly of an inactive contemplation. In the first place, not even the contemplation could be complete if there were no under- standing of how it came to be. Why it was, in an ultimate sense, was immediately a superfluous and unsophisticated inquiry. To a man of the world in the best sense, it was. What could not be learned of its whyness after one had inquired as to how it came to be must end in futile speculation. Still, it remained to ask "who or what made it," and the efficient cause became a philosophical necessity as it had been an objective fact. But even the discovery of this third cause did not exhaust the possibility of a knowledge of things. To a man for whom "to be" was "to do" it became imperative to learn what might be done with these discovered things. This point may be considered a crisis in Aristotle's system. Aristotle faced it with a presence of wits that has left his system the outstanding metaphysics the mind of man has not "produced," but discovered. Among other things, Aristotle was a biologist and zoologist. Had he known the Hebrew Scriptures, he would have been first to notice that the world was made and Adam subsequently placed in it to thrive as he might; Jehovah had not created Adam and then made a world for him. As it was, Aristotle saw with a vision which, if it did not actually anticipate our modern theories of evolution, remains on the whole consistent with them. He saw man as merely one of the animals- the highest and most complex of animals indeed, an animal which besides performing the various functions of reproduction, nutri- tion, growth, locomotion, and sense experience, also thought,-but still, an animal and with other animals and things, striving for the adjustment that might insure its survival. With this clear and sophisticated view of things, the naturalist-philosopher met the crisis and survived it. And as man himself has his ideal fulfillment, so have all other things. Every substance, along with its source in some prior substance and its actual form and its dependence on some agent, has also its functions, uses, ends, or final causes. These uses are not capriciously read into things by anthropomorphic fancy; they are discovered to be part of what things genuinely mean. Indeed these uses are often hostile to man and his human ends. They must, however, be taken into account, no matter how acutely they run counter to man's purposes and ideals. They must, like the other causes, be understood if any thing is to be adequately understood. Thus Aristotle had, in a word, perfected a system by which man might understand things and yet had avoided the danger of making man "the measure of all things." Final causes then were not creations of the mind that might perceive them. They were the possible actualizations of the poten-</page><page sequence="4">536 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY tialities in external objects; they depended upon the objective re- lations between objects, whether man was involved or not. Con- taining many potentialities, both things and men might fulfill one or another; and it was necessary to elaborate a system of ethics which in thorough compatibility with the antecedent metaphysics might evaluate these various fulfillments. Aristotle devoted some attention to these ideal fulfillments though it is possible that, in the matter of ideals, he failed to note some of the most rare yet lofty fulfillments possible to the function of the human organism which is the mind. Over-wary of the extravagant exaggerations of the Platonic ideal, he was content to identify the ideal with the best that had empirically been found possible. It is at this point in the ethical development that George Santayana enters upon the stage with his Life of Reason, accepting the natural basis which Aris- totle had discovered and expanding the ideal fulfillment, in other words, clarifying for practice, the ideal relation that should exist between natural impulse and ideation. The ideal relation is that lofty plane upon which the mind, honestly aware of the natural world in which it lives, seeks, by a process of reasonable recon- ciliation, the adjustment which will make the life of man harmoni- ous in its activity, rich in its appreciations, and happy in its proc- ess. Thus Santayana himself proposes having started "with the immediate flux, in which all objects and impulses are given, to describe the Life of Reason; that is, to note what facts and pur- poses seem to be primary, to show how the conception of nature and life gathers around them, and to point to the ideals of thought and action which are approached by this gradual mastering of ex- perience by reason. 2 Thus admitting the ideal which reflection creates (and which is therefore not necessarily encountered in the facts of experience), but connecting it with its natural basis which makes it definable, Santayana proceeds to sketch in glowing and permanent colors the efficacious life of reason in our world of things. He begins judici- ously with the natural history of reason. It is by no means an unfortuitous way to begin the unification of "a trustworthy con- ception of the conditions under which man lives with an adequate conception of his interests. " 3 Before reason can harness the powers of natural impulse to the pursuit of those objects of ideation, it is obvious that the condi- tions must be defined and the interests discovered. Historically, this is a slow process. The conditions must be envisaged both as the conditions of the pursuit and the potential conditions of the 2 Beason in Common Sense, p. 32. 8 Beason in Common Sense, p. 28.</page><page sequence="5">IMPLICATIONS OF THE LIFE OF REASON 537 enjoyment of any ideal end, and the elected interest must maintain a harmonious relationship with these conditions. When these "defi- nite interests are recognized and the values of things are estimated, " 4 harmonious activity evidences the birth of reason. The mind in its first groupings, unaware of its own interests, finds in the external world only an unordered chaos and flux. Then, as the mind begins to distinguish between pleasure and pain, there results a certain consciousness of itself, and there seems to be a certain foothold, a certain vantage point in the flux. In the light of the pleasures that are to be sought instead of the pain, by a superb effort, the mind arises to a conception of things, of the con- ditions which because of either their hostility or their sympathy toward that pursuit are at length perceived, and perceived more- over as part of a certain order. The mind has arisen to an ap- preciation of the world: there is something that lives; there is somethilng to live for; and there is the place and requisite condi- tions for living. Hence, reason, as Santayana aptly says, "enters into partnership with the world and begins to be respected there; which it would never be if it were not expressive of the same me- chanical forces that are to preside over events and render them fortunate or unfortunate for human interests." 5 Up to this point, Santayana is faithful to a naturalistic inter- pretation both of the world and of experience, and the natural his- tory of reason seems altogether plausible and acceptable. At this point, the point at which the ethical system is to begin in its more constructive aspect, there is an important crisis for Santayana to meet. He seems to hesitate a moment as though bewildered and then proceeds resolutely along the chosen path much as though there had been no doubt as to which course he should follow. Santayana's preoccupation with human values has, in a general sense, been suggested. It proves significant in the further devel- opment. What has seemed to be a thoroughly naturalistic inter- pretation of the mind's growing acquaintance with the world in which it finds itself (an interpretation which we have applauded), now seems, more subtly than dramatically, completely inverted. "Nature," he has maintained (and his language seems plain enough), "is the sum total of things potentially observable, some observed actually, others interpolated hypothetically; and common- sense is right as against Kant's subjectivism in regarding nature as the condition of mind and not mind as the condition of nature. " 6 And later, as one emerging from a profound reverie and sensing 41Reason in Common Sense, p. 47. 5 Reason in Common Sense, p. 62. 61Reason in Common Sense, p. 104.</page><page sequence="6">538 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY anew the familiar objects of his material surroundings, he says, "Nature is reason's basis and theme; reason is nature's conscious- ness; and, from the point of view of that consciousness when it has arisen, reason is also nature's justification and goal."7 Or again toward the end of The Life of Reason he remarks, "Though mean- ing is the object of an ideal function, and signification is inwardly appreciable only in terms of signification, yet the ideal leap is made from a material datum: that in which signification is seen is a fact." 8 Perhaps we misunderstand the language, but it sounds much like the lingering memory of a once naturalistic interpreta- tion. Yet in the meantime, Santayana seems to have deserted the cause. He is headed toward a pure Berkeleyan idealism. If we find him changing his course again before he reaches this startling goal, it is because (to put it logically), he lacks the god which is the necessary support of Berkeley 's "qualities," and (to put it personally), he has imbibed more than he has perhaps realized of the modern spirit. In any event, he has gone far enough to treat sensation on the basis of British epistemology. And thought, previously a form of life to be "conceived on the analogy of nutrition, generation, and art," is now exalted, if not actually to the proportions of the Berkeleyan God, to a position where it must assume some of the functions of that deity. "What is conceived to support the phys- ical qualities is a pseudo-psychic or vital force," he says now; "it is a moral and living object that we construct, building it up out of all the materials, emotional, intellectual, and sensuous, which lie at hand in our consciousness to be synthesized into the hybrid reality which we are to fancy confronting uis." 10 Thought goes on to attribute to these objects their systematic distribution and their settled character. "Water does not run down hill more per- sistently than attention turns experience into constant terms."" To understand the full implication of this latest assertion, psycho- logically true from even the most naturalistic point of view, it will be necessary to examine the status of "experience" in the light of the foregoing. Experience, sensuous experience, is no longer food for knowl- edge. Knowledge, says Santayana, "is a salutation, not an em- brace. " 12 Such a remark is in one sense entirely true; for in 7 Reason in Common Sense, p. 205. 8 Reason in Science, p. 31. 9 Reason in Common Sense, p. 67. 10 Reason in Common Sense, p. 73. 11 Reason in Common Sense, p. 74. 12 Reason in Common Sense, p. 77.</page><page sequence="7">IMPLICATIONS OF THE LIFE OF REASON 539 knowing a thing we need not physically possess it nor have it pres- ent to sense, provided it is the object of our intent and embodies the form we entertain of it in idea. But in any other sense the remark goes astray. It becomes false if it implies that what is intelligibly present in mind can not actually be found as the na- ture of particular substances. Yet beneath Santayana 's felicitous use of this pregnant phrase something of this kind happens. Knowledge, for him, ceases to live on the objects of experience. Though he previously agreed with Aristotle that "everything ideal has a natural basis," 13 he now and again in his preoccupation with the ideal entirely ignores the natural basis, the natural basis, which, 'we assume, would be known through sense. Because it is the ideal aspect of things "that endows existence with character and value, together with representative scope and a certain lien upon eter- nity," 14 and because this "supersensible substance, reality, or independent object, does not itself descend into the arena of im- mnediate sensuous presentation," 15 sense experience is very elabo- rately discredited in its entirety. This liquidation of the validity of the objects given in sense experience, and indeed, of sense ex- perience itself, has become a logical necessity; either the ideals of thought are real, or the sensed objects are real, and if the reality is to be attributed to the latter, "all intelligible objects and the w hole universe of mental discourse would then be an unreal and conventional structure, impinging ultimately on sense from which it would derive its sole validity." "I The quotation suffices to indi- cate what Santayana must inevitably choose. Reason wins the day and what "evidence" must still be attributed to sense is given a diplomatic passport into the realm of "pure confidence in reason. " 17 Still, no triumph is without its costs, and Santayana grows a bit wistful over the inevitable and complete loss of matter. Even if the only value of the candle be in terms of its light and warmth, the light and warmth must be sacrificed if the tallow is removed. Santayana finds himself confronted with the dangers of a neo-Pla- tonic identification of the efficient with the final cause; he copes with this danger somewhat successfully, but his weapons are at best those of British empiricism and he emerges a Platonic Locke. We are now ready to take our first excursion of inspection into one of the provinces of essence. Matter is preserved, deftly enough, and the dignity of mind with the reality of ideals is also maintained most charmingly, most persuasively. "You will not 13 Reason in Comrnon Sense, p. 21. 14Reason in Common Sense, p. 79. 15 Reason in Common Sense, pp. 76-77. 16 Reason in Common Sense, p. 78. 17 Reason in Commnon Sense, p. 80.</page><page sequence="8">540 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY be so idiotic," says Santayana, "to make no inference from your sensations; you will not pin your faith so unimaginatively on momentary appearance as to deny that the world exists when you stop thinking about it.""18 We are at first astounded with what seems to be an apparent lack of distinction between thinking and sensing, but, remembering that the "evidence of sense" is still "pure confidence in reason," we again permit ourselves to be led on, keeping, iievertheless, a careful eye on the path that we may not be lost should this particular province, or indeed the entire realm of essence, prove an unsatisfactory environment for the animals we are, nourished by and dependent on a world of things. Sensuous data are "appearances" and we must proceed to in- vestigate just what it is that they are evidences or appearances of. Santayana is honest enough when he insists that "your present im- pressions, dependent as they are on your chance attitude and dis- position and on a thousand trivial accidents, are far from repre- senting adequately all that might be discovered or that is actually known about the object before you." '9 We can not deny that we do not possess the kind of mind which, once having seen a steam- ship, will not, as it stands on the shore and senses the distant smoke along the blue horizon, immediately construct the implied ship and the necessary smoke-stack. Yet the process is one of purely natural association. If in the finite series of actual ships we have per- ceived, we have found a certain similarity, it has been a similarity between particulars, ships actually known, from which our minds abstracted a notion of ships and of smoke-stacks. Indeed, the better we have known the ships, the more adequate will be our apprecia- tion of similarities and of dissimilarities. But Santayana prefers to treat this abstracted notion of ships as an essence which the sen- sation of "ship" has now and then saluted, but never "embraced." Having preserved the material ship, he forbids our knowing more than its essence, which it must be noted is different from the ab- stracted notion we have gathered from repeated experiences. "The several repetitions of one essence given in consciousness will tend at once to be neglected, and only the essence itself-the character shared by those sundry perceptions-will stand and become a term in mental discourse, " 20 and the only reality. Such a conclusion seems to imnply a difficulty possibly traceable to a confusion of sensations and their causes. But sensations are not their own causes; if they were, to insist that knowledge em- braces objects would be as admissibly absurd as it might be for a 18 Reason in Common Senise, p .81. 19 Reason in Common Sense, p. 81. 20 Reason in Common Sense, p. 74.</page><page sequence="9">IMPLICATIONS OF THE LIFE OF REASON 541 man continually to embrace his own arins. Sensations, rather, are the arms of the mind; and without the selective and integrating government of the mind, sensations would embrace at random and indiscriminately, quite as impulse unruled by ideation might fare in the everyday world. Mind without sensations would be like an armless man, starving alone, beneath a cherry tree. By integrating and classifying the reports of the senses, the mind comes to know objects, and to recognize their relations each to each, and each to all, and of itself to each and all. And it becomes proverbial that the mind is more in a position to abstract and infer, the better it understands "the four causes" of the particulars. But if "to dis- cover a physical object is to pack in the same part of space, and fuse in one complex body, primary data like colored form and tangible surface," 21 or to know anything is merely to recognize the appearance of an essence, are we not constructing a fictitious uni- verse on the evidence of sense, and, having taken refuge in it, promptly renouncing all allegiance to the very sensations which originally furnished the data? There may be a kind of knowledge which is knowledge-of-similarities-only; but the philosopher, if he would be a man of affairs and journey to Rome, must embark on a particular ship, and that ship must exist on its own account, ideally as it may be made to function. Sensations will continue to be physical reactions to the natural objects that produce them, and the external objects will be the very objects that produce those very sensations, and knowledge will be mind's knowing them as such; for while impulse naturally acts on particulars, ideation sees the entire picture. One will not presume to deny the reality of facts which are not directly given in presentational immediacy; for such a denial would truly be the complete annihilation of an entire universe of legiti- mate intellectual concepts. The theory of evolution is a real hy- pothesis which no single sensation can verify, and the Republic of Plato is ideally existential. But in the case of the first, if the sci- entist were not to find it supported by the evidence of known par- ticulars, he would be compelled to discard it as a theory and to relegate it to the paradoxical existence of an untruth; and in the case of the second, when Plato had studied the Greek city and ab- stracted from it the concept of an ideal fulfillment, he still loved his native Athens too dearly to cast it aside like a "squeezed or- ange." 22 On the other hand, objects sensed are just those objects and neither particular nor universal essences; and, if I under- stand Santayana correctly, his almost invariable failure to concede 21 Reason in Commnon Sense, p. 162. 22 Reason in Science, p. 71.</page><page sequence="10">542 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY to sensation the status of a process between mind and the material objects of knowledge leads to the logical but embarrassing necessity of reducing the whole world to a realm of essence. The transition, or inversion as it may be, is, as has been indi- cated, more gradual than dramatic, and there is no point in The Life' of Reason at which the reader can more than be aware that the naturalistic interpretationi is receding and giving way to an ad- vancing epiphenomenalism which is the thesis of development in The Realms of Being. The first step identifies the essence with "the character shared by sundry perceptions," and material things begin to grow unknowable as their sole function becomes that of subtending these qualities or being appearances of the essence; but a doctrine which attributes the sole reality to the recurrent char- acteristics of sensed particulars or perceptions (which are at the same time reduced to unknowable substrata) and elevates these characteristics into a quasi-Platonic essence has inescapably sepa- rated "the four causes" from Aristotle's substances or "things" of which they are the causes, consigning the final cause to mind, and rendering the efficient cause an external unknowable. Essences, then, originally merely the mind 's ideas of the ex- ternal objects of knowledge, become hypostatized over and above the particular objects of which they were previously the concepts. But this would be too simple a conclusion. The mind will infer a candle when the eye sees a flicker and construct a ship out of mere smoke; consequently the essence has been expanded to class pro- portions and any particular will unknowably support the identi- cal essence, the class name, or more truly, the ideal and only real- ity. But Santayana was not content to rest here. Indeed, he retraced his steps, but he came back to a world of objects imbued with a foreign spirit; it was impossible to rematerialize objects in the old sense, so what he did was to reparticularize and democ- ratize essences. In this way he sought to make mind at home in a new world and to free it from the annoyance of sensuous distraction. The first volume of RealIms of Being defines the nature of es- sences with clarity and definiteness. They are infinite in number and variety, and eternal in their scope and being; and though "es- sences are the only objects of indubitable and immediate experi- ences," 23 they are altogether indifferent toward being experienced, descending into the arena of understanding only casually, if not, indeed, purely by accident. Essences are entirely free, and where there are implications, they "must be something imposed on es- sences by human discourse. v 24 23 Realm of Essence, p. 165. 24 Realm of Essence, p. 81.</page><page sequence="11">IMPLICATIONS OF THE LIFE OF REASON 543 The logical development, if we may on our own account insist on implications, is the reduction, or perhaps the elevation to es- sences, first, of the entire world with all the particulars which lend continuity to experience, and then, should we rashly become self-conscious, of ourselves, and even of Santayana himself, should we pause to consider him. His answer to the questions of formal and final causes has been the sacrifice of the very things of which he has sought to explain the causes. In The Realm of Matter Santayana returns to cope with the problem of efficient and material causes. What he actually attempts to do is to know what his previous position has rendered "the un- knowable. " To predicate the "presumable," not to mention the "indispensable " properties of the re-enstated substance involves certain contradictions and inconsistencies which it is hard to imagine that Santayana himself would try to reconcile. Clearly, to know so much of substance, if essences only are given to the understand- ing, necessarily implies an essential status for substance which is probably not Santayana's intention. On the other hand, to know substance as substance and not a new kind of essence would mean that essences are not the only objects of knowledge. Moreover, this knowledge of substance might be developed in either of two ways. We may know the special properties of each particular instance of substance, in which case we have come home to the Aristotelian "things" which Santayana has seemed progressively to deny; or we may know only the secondary qualities of substance, in which case, we must assume an unknowable substratum supports essential qualities that we do know, necessarily as essence; and Locke and Plato shake hands in the twentieth century. When we have laid aside the writings of Santayana in all of their charming persuasiveness, to criticize his doctrines seems meanly to bark at him for "browsing so innocently" 25 in the pas- tures of his own speculation, but to accept him solely on the merit of his art would be to consider him merely a literateur. He is a literateur, but he is also a philosopher; and because his philosophy contains so much that is acceptable, we may be free to question that which in our way of thinking seems less worthy of acceptance. In- deed there has been so much of the acceptable that American nat- uralism has claimed The Life of Reason as partisan literature. The Reualms of Being to which the movement objects is now seen to be the logical development of the metaphysical implications of the earlier works. The mistake was obviously in the epistemological approach which inevitably separated "things" from their "causes"; and the unfortunate result is an untenable metaphysics, though 25 Realm of Matter, p. 1.</page><page sequence="12">544 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY we may, and no doubt shall, because of its intrinsic applicability, seek to live the life of reason which Santayana has so beautifully expounded and defined in our own world of Aristotelian things; and as good citizens, we will yet acclaim Santayana, detached and disinterested as he may be, one of the foremost of men in our com- munity of natural objects.
