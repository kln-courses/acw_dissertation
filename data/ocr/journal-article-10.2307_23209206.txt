<plain_text><page sequence="1">EDITOR'S NOTE The Art Bulletin will celebrate its centennial in 2013. In the journal's first hundred years, findings and arguments shaped the history of art, as queries arising from the correlation of objects and their histories—queries about subject and style, material and meaning, inclusion and exclusion, gender, race, sexuality, and so on—ushered the discipline in new direc tions. Gliding into a new century, The Art Bulletin should reflect the widening scope and manifold practices of the history of art. Specialty journals exist for many fields, but The Art Bulletin is uniquely positioned as a venue for critical, cross-field dialogue. To reflect the vibrancy of art history today and to stimulate dialogue across fields and with neigh boring disciplines, the March 2012 issue of The Art Bulletin includes three new features, "Regarding Art and Art History," "Notes from the Field," and "Interview." These features will run through the December 2013 issue, the last in the jour nal's centennial year and in my tenure as editor-in-chief. Drawing on both senses of the word "regard," "Regarding Art and Art History" will explore relations between looking and considering. If the feature asks art historians to muse in their own ways about how seeing objects and thinking about them come together, Anne Wagner's essay shows that these musings cannot help but touch on the discipline of art history itself. Regardless of whether the object before us is original, in reproduction, in the mind's eye, in the canon or outside of it, ours is a field predicated on looking and considering. It is also a field dedicated to historical consideration. In that sense, Wagner's invocation of Michael Baxandall's curiosity, and of his characterization of historical work as being "infer ential about cause," deliver us to the "how" and "why" of objects, to those questions and conjectures that lie at the heart of our enterprise as art historians. "Notes from the Field" will gather thoughts on a common topic. Beginning with "anthropomorphism" and concluding with "tradition," this feature offers an abecedary of resonant topics. "Notes from the Field" will not present keywords or critical terms so much as it will explore the ways historians of art, literature, culture, and science, archaeologists, anthro pologists, philosophers, curators, and artists think and work with materials and ideas. The field notes in this issue manifest modes of attention and analysis in motion. They pinpoint how objects and meanings come together and apart, how they travel across time, place, and disciplinary domain, how, sometimes existing in spaces eccentric to current concerns, they emerge to become a focus of attention. As "Notes from the Field" draws together voices often separated in and out side of the academy, it delves into deeper registers and lures interesting things to the surface. In all these ways, "Notes from the Field" extends an invitation to inquiry. "Interview" brings scholars into dialogue. By turns an oral history and a glimpse into the thinker behind the writing, "Interview" opens the door to a field of specialty to reveal contexts, ideas, and motivations in a personal voice. Follow ing The Art Bulletins standard for critical investigation, the feature commences with an essay by Julia Gelshorn that alerts us to the complicated nature of the interview format—of its status as reproduction, construction, and historical artifact. The three new features in this issue open and close on the note of curiosity. Like Wagner's invocation of Baxandall's forensics and of the role curiosity plays in her own scholarly labors, Hans Ulrich Obrist, in dialogue with Philip Ursprung, declares curiosity to be the motor of his entire interview project. Curiosity, conjecture, being "inferential about cause": these continue to be the tools of any careful trade with aesthetic objects, whatever our materials or methods. "Regarding Art and Art History," "Notes from the Field," and "Interview" demonstrate this through looking, considering, writing, and spoken dialogue. KAREN LANG Editor-in-Chief</page></plain_text>
