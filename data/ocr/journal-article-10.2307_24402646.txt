<plain_text><page sequence="1">R. J. A. KILBOURN TOWARD A NON-EUCLIDEAN CINEMA: Kieslowski and Literature Résumé : Cet article examine l'intertextualité entre La double vie de véronique de Krzysztof Kieslowski et ses deux sources littéraires principales, c'est-à-dire, un bref passage de la deuxième cantate du Paradis de Dante et l'essai "Uber das Marionettentheater" de Heinrich von Kleist. Kieslowski admet que le cinéma ne peut conjurer ce que la "grande littérature," comme il l'appelle, évoque en n'ayant recours qu'aux simples mots. La prose occidentale peut être bavarde, mais elle transmet souvent son sense véritable par ce qui n'est pas dit, ou ce qui est dit ou montré négativement. Dans le cas du cinéma, on a généralement tendance à chercher le "sens" dans la "texture" superficielle, à ne juger que ce qui est visible. Kieslowski joint cet aspect du cinéma à une réticence hautement "littéraire," une dimension négative, non-représentée mais déterminable. Le spectateur doit donc lire littéralement le film de Kieslowski. Cet article propose d'interpréter la double caractérisation de Véronique en tant qu'analogie du pèlerin de Dante dont l'âme approche le périmètre de l'expérience conçue rationnellement, une structure sem blable à la géométrie quasi métaphysique et non euclidienne de Kleist. De façon plus générale, l'article examine la relation particulière que le cinéma de Kieslowski entretient avec ces oeuvres littéraires variées dans le cadre d'une méditation sur les liens qui existent entre le sujet, la mort et l'infini. But this rough magic/1 here abjure —Shakespeare, The Tempest At one point in his 1993 memoirs, Kieslowski on Kieslowski, Polish film maker Krzysztof Kieslowski laments with tragic prescience the pass ing of the era of great directors, remarking that "most of them are dead or have stopped making films."1 Kieslowski died of a heart attack on the 13th of March 1996, in Warsaw. He was fifty-four and, after completing the Three Colours trilogy, had announced his retirement from filmmaking.2 Now we can only speculate as to the sincerity of this announcement,- otherwise, his presence as a filmmaker was such that the corresponding magnitude of CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FILM STUDIES • REVUE CANADIENNE D'ÉTUDES CINÉMATOGRAPHIQUES VOLUME 6 NO. 2 • FALL • AUTOMNE 1997 • pp 34-50</page><page sequence="2">his loss is at this point very difficult to gauge. This paper begins with the subject of death—Kieslowski's death, and death in the abstract—because, besides adding poignance to the writing of this paper, the fact of Kieslowski's death is somehow appropriate, although no less sad, given the nature of his preoccupations as a filmmaker, and on the evidence of his own published comments in this regard. It is appropriate, with respect to both the central structural, thematic, and philosophical role of death in many of his films since a slyly ironic 1972 documentary about funeral bureaucracy in Poland,3 and to the parallels between the character of the elderly judge in Red and Kieslowski's own Prospero-like renunciation of filmmaking.4 This is not a film paper, properly speaking, but a reflection on the relation between The Double Life of Ve'ronicjue (Poland, 1991) and a few spe cific literary texts. But the crux is something specific to neither cinema nor literature: a certain conception of the self-other relation which owes a debt most immediately to Emmanuel Levinas.5 Otherwise, I have tried to adopt the interpretive attitude tacitly promulgated in Kieslowski on Kieslowski, to the extent that 1 will consider these memoirs as subject to interpretation to the same extent as his films. Kieslowski's films, while readily described, defy easy analysis,- one recurrent comparative model in the memoirs is that of literature, which of course begs the question as to what is meant by "lit erature." For the purposes of argument, we can begin from the conven tional, generally eurocentric notion of literature implicit in Kieslowski's memoirs: a relatively narrow textual category exemplified by the work of the Creek dramatists, Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, Kafka, Camus, Faulkner, Vargas Llosa—in short, "Great Literature." These are in fact the principle examples Kieslowski offers in response to the question as to which "film direc tors" influenced him the most. It is as if literature, he explains, were more important to him than film.6 It should be pointed out that Kieslowski does not employ a critical vocabulary in his memoirs, posing the question of film's relative expressive capability in traditional, even colloquial, terms. Kieslowski maintains that presentiments, intuitions, and dreams, in short "the inner life of a human being," is "the hardest thing to film."7 He talks of his inherently unreachable "goal" as a filmmaker, "to capture what lies within us, but there's no way of filming it. You can only get nearer to it. It's a great subject for literature. It's probably the only subject in the world. Great literature doesn't only get near it, it's in a position to describe it."8 He then claims that, while literature is somehow adequate to the description of this invis ible and otherwise inaccessible interiority, cinema is not, because it lacks the means. He insists on the literalness, the overwhelmingly visual, surface TOWARD A NON-EUCLIDEAN CINEMA 35</page><page sequence="3">appearance of film, and he is always aiming "to escape from this literalism." But, he says, "I'll never achieve it,- in the same way that I'll never manage to describe what really dwells within my hero, although I keep on trying."9 Kieslowski, like other filmmakers, struggles with putting on the screen what is otherwise unrepresentable. At the same time, he admits to the final failure of the inherently visual medium of film to conjure the figurative or tropological effects that are literature's verbal stock-in-trade. One would gather from Kieslowski's remarks that the literary form most readily comparable to film is the novel. And, although the novel is capable of "telling" or "showing" a great deal, often what is of greatest sig nificance (precisely because it is most problematic) is what is withheld, or, more interestingly, what is "told" or "shown" negatively, what is denied in its very instantiation. This effect may refer to what the text itself withholds from ready apprehension,- in other words, it may be a question of "unrep resentability."10 In a film, this kind of strategy of denial or avoidance is more difficult to actuate given the degree to which narrative is "related" visually—there is a tendency to look for a film's "positive signifying content"'1 in its surface texture, to judge only what is visible, to read "lit erally." As Kieslowski remarks elsewhere, film as a medium is much more "primitive, concrete, and direct" than literature."12 In fact, Kieslowski explicitly denies that he films metaphors, claiming that people only read the images in his films as metaphors, which is what he intended.13 In deny ing the metaphoricity of his films as he does, Kieslowski inadvertently draws attention to his ability to combine this attribute of film with a high ly "literary"—that is, highly evocative—reticence: a negative dimension, potentially determinable, and determinate.14 The viewer must quite liter ally read Kieslowski's films. But the invitation, or exhortation, to "read" Kieslowski's or any other film as a visual text on the analogy of the verbal, is obviously problematic. Despite Kieslowski's own privileging of the novel form in his "Great Literature" list, neither of the two texts to be considered here is from a novel. The first is a short passage from the second canto of Dante's Paradiso. The other text is Heinrich von Kleist's 1810 essay "On the Marionette Theatre." Kleist, unlike Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, or even Dante, is nowhere mentioned in Kieslowski's memoirs. It is nevertheless possible to speak of Kieslowski's employment in The Double Life of Véronique of some thing very similar to Kleist's anti-Kantian, non-Euclidean geometrical meta phorics,15 as a framework for the representation of the unrepresentable relation of self and other across the threshold of the infinite. The only problem with using Kleist's strange dialogue with its inset narratives as 36 R. J. A. Kilboum</page><page sequence="4">an intertext for a film like The Double Life of Véronique is that, if anything, Kleist's piece is even more resistant to interpretation. "On the Marionette Theatre" was initially published in the Berliner Abendblatter, Berlin's first daily paper, for which Kleist was virtually sole writer and editor for 6 months between 1810-11 (the year of his death). This "essay" is almost a genre unto itself, somewhere between a Platonic dialogue (with an ironically undermined dialectical structure) and a proto Borgesian parable, shifting abruptly from anecdotal reportage into enig matic metaphysical speculation. Two speakers, the narrator and a "Herr C.", principal dancer at a local theatre, meet in a park in an unnamed town and embark on a conversation about the superior "grace" of marionettes over human dancers. From this premise, the greater part of the discussion elaborates a pseudo-scientific discourse of physical force and motion, issu ing in an analogy between puppets as unreflective, avolitional and there fore pre-eminently graceful, and geometrical figures and their logarithmic equivalents. Then the narrator offers an anecdote about a youth's loss of "natural grace" through self-consciousness, parried by Herr C.'s story of his encounter with a fencing bear who could defeat any human opponent. The essays last full paragraph, where all the "threads" appear to be drawn together, remains a landmark in the history of enigmatic literary texts. The Double Life of Ve'ronicjue is the story of two identical women, the Polish Weronika and the French Véronique, born on the same day, both raised primarily by their fathers (the early loss of the mother is of great, albeit subtle, significance for both16). They never meet in actuality, apart from a chance encounter in Krakow when the French Véronique unwit tingly photographs her double. The film's first half-hour recounts the last year or so of the life of Weronika, who has a beautiful singing voice and a heart condition.17 She chooses to pursue her career, to the detriment of both her health and her relationships. During a concert she suffers a heart attack and dies onstage. The remainder of the film follows the French Véronique, who also has a beautiful voice and a weak heart, and who sud denly decides to give up singing to teach music and guard her health. After a charismatic puppeteer and children's writer named Alexandre Fabbri performs at her school, Véronique begins to receive mysterious messages and gifts, which at first allude obliquely to the dead Weronika and to the spectre of her own death, and eventually lead her to a meeting with Alexandre in a café. When he reveals that his luring her to him was an experiment for a "real book," a projected novel ("to see if it was possible," he says), she flees, her romantic dream seemingly shattered. Alexandre pursues her, and they reconverge in a hotel room, where he confesses that TOWARD A NON-EUCLIDEAN CINEMA 37</page><page sequence="5">he was wrong, that he chose her for an entirely different, far more myste rious, reason, and that he loves her. They find the photos from her Poland trip in her hand bag, and Alexandre points out the picture of Weronika, thinking it is Véronique. Only then does she begin to realize that the other whose passing she had sensed really had existed, and that Alexandre cannot be the one to fill the irrational lack she feels, since that other, at first unknown, but now in some mysterious way known, is irretrievably absent. Later, when Alexandre makes two puppets ("because they damage easily") in her likeness for a new show and storybook based on her experi ence and emotions, Véronique leaves, returning home to her father.18 Home as a theme dominates the narrative of Kieslowski's early life in his memoirs, and leads into the few direct statements about what he was seeking to achieve in his films: "All my films [he says], from the first to the most recent ones, are about individuals who can't quite find their bearings, who don't quite know how to live, who don't really know what's right or wrong and are desperately looking."19 And yet in telling the stories of these individuals, Kieslowski's films remain markedly unmetaphysical, even, for example, in a film like 1984's No End, in which Kieslowski tells the story of a woman who only realizes after her husband's death how much she loves him. By the film's end, she has joined him on the other side. Despite this apparent concession to metaphysics, No End says more about the life of an individual in contemporary Poland than it does about a putative hereafter (which is represented as a thoroughly untranscendent version of this life). No End exploits an overtly metaphysical language to recount the poignant story of one person's inability to cope with the absolute absence of another. In Kieslowski's view the metaphysics of No End consist in "the signs which emanate from the man who's not there anymore."20 In other words, the non-metaphysical traces of an absent pres ence,- for what need does memory have for metaphysics? And what use is memory in the apprehension of the other that is gone, never having been present, to the self, here and now? Nor does memory, conventionally construed, play any part in the central relationship in The Double Life of Véronique. In one pivotal scene, Weronika is walking happily along one side of Krakow's main square dur ing a political demonstration21 when a protester, fleeing riot police, knocks her portfolio with its broken string from her hands, scattering leaves of music over the pavement. As she stops to gather them up, a French tour bus pulls into the square to collect its passengers, and suddenly Weronika sees her double, turning to take a few last photos, before the bus pulls away. Weronika stands, in quiet fascination, oblivious to the melée around 38 R. J. A. Kilboum</page><page sequence="6">her. Slavoj Zizek, citing Derrida, makes the connection between the gaze and death, particularly in "the uncanny encounter" of the subject with its double: "'seeing oneself looking ... he writes, "unmistakably stands for death: when the gaze qua object is no longer the elusive blind spot in the field of the visible but is included in this field, one meets one's own death."22 Although Weronika lives long enough after this encounter to win a music competition and then die in the middle of a performance, she is at this moment, in terms of the symbolic order, already dead. Weronika's experience is subsequently inverted for Véronique when Alexandre points out the photo she didn't know she took: proof that this other who is now dead was there. As Weronika's aunt tells her, "Everybody in our family died in good health." If a life is reduced to its absolute metaphorical minimum as a geo metric line (the extension through time of a point in space), then the abbreviated span of Weronika's life is figured (the figure of a figure) as the string that closes her music portfolio, always threatening, like her shoelace, to come undone. During the audition for the music competition which she will go on to win, she winds the string reflexively around her finger as she sings, stretching it until it prophetically breaks. Immediately after this she has her first heart attack: leaning sideways, she crumples on a park bench like an abandoned doll Like Kleist's essay, however, there is far more to The Double Life of Ve'ronitfue than puppets. In the film's second part, one of the first envelopes Véronique receives from Alexandre contains only a black shoelace. In sending her this, Alexandre is quoting one of his own stories, but the coincidence is enough to arouse Véroniques fascination, until a moment when, absentmindedly stretching the string over the electrocardiogram she has received after a hospital test, she pulls the black line taut and, with a snap, reveals its full metaphorical significance. The effect is only enhanced by the EKG's resemblance to a sheet of musical notation: the heart's beat is the rhythm of life, the flatline is silence. The metaphorics of The Double Life of Ve'ronicjue, like that of Kleist's essay, extends from geometric to optical figures. It is by no means an innovation to thematize the act of seeing and of modes of perception in the visual text of a film. Cinematic narrative is even more dependent than the novel or short story on a constructed point-of-view that privileges the visual. Kieslowski's camera generally maintains a subtle affiliation with the prin cipal character, in this case Véronique. Occasionally, the camera even assumes her position, showing us the world as it were through her eyes— most notably at the moment of Weronika's death. Again, there is nothing TOWARD A NON-EUCLIDEAN CINEMA 39</page><page sequence="7">new about this technique, but what can remain at the level of style is raised by Kieslowski to an intense emotional intimacy, something very difficult to describe, like a mood or psychic state you can't quite name but recog nize immediately as something uncannily familiar. While Kieslowski's dia logue is written with painstaking economy, this discursive resistance puts added pressure on the non-verbal dimension: the highly-wrought visual and aural aspects of his films. In The Double Life of Véronique, at least, as in Kleist's essay, the foregrounding of the refraction and reflection of images through or by means of mirrors and lenses (beginning and ending in the camera lens itself) serves as a connective between the modalities of subjective perception and the otherwise inscrutable operations of what appears to be the overriding forces of either coincidence or fate. In other words, the quasi-metaphysical paradoxes of the relation between Weronika and Véronique are represented concretely, structurally, in the film's cinematographic text. The French Véronique is noticeably more self-reflective than her Polish counterpart,- one reason for this, as Kieslowski points out, is pre cisely because Weronika is now dead, which Véronique has somehow sensed, leading inevitably to an enhanced consciousness of self. The sec ond part of the film is therefore an analysis, as Kieslowski sees it, of Véroniques "state of mind."23 There is an overall visual uniformity to the film, an overall style or quality uniting the narrative modes of the 1 parts. This is achieved with a special golden-yellow filter that makes the world of the film appear more beautiful than the actual world. Kieslowski also makes judicious use of unusual camera angles and distorting lenses that evoke visually a change of state (or at least its possibility) beyond the con straints of time, space, and phenomenology, and in doing so draw atten tion to what Ragland and Wright refer to as "the fragility of the geometric space that we normally take for granted."24 The nexus of this optical metaphorics is Weronika's small clear rubber ball, through which is glimpsed the inverted and refracted image of the church in her Polish hometown, even when it is not there. At one point Véronique recounts to her father a dream-memory of the same church, a vision that haunts her just as it recurs throughout both parts of the film. The transparent ball—a spherical prism—turns up in Véroniques handbag, just before Alexandre finds the photo that will turn her world upside-down. When Weronika suffers her fatal heart attack, she is singing a piece by the eighteenth-century Dutch composer Van Den Budenmayer (who also wrote the music for Red ), and who is a complete fiction.25 Zbigniew Preisner, the real composer,26 turned to Dante's Commedia for the lyrics to 40 R. I. A. Kilboum</page><page sequence="8">this principal piece.27 According to Kieslowski, it was Preisner's own idea to quote Dante (Kieslowski 179), and that in fact these words have noth ing to do with the story. Be this as it may, the lines speak to the listener from this new context in a way that inevitably reflects meaningfully upon the enigmatic events of the film. Furthermore, the Dante passage invokes a problem or challenge which, despite its overtly theological import, is arguably as significant for both literature and film now as it has been since modernity's inception.28 The passage is from the Paraiiso, canto II: O voi che siete in piccioletta barca, desiderosi d'ascoltar, seguiti dietro al mio legno che cantando varca, tomate a riveder li vostri liti:29 non vi mettete in pelago, che forse, perdendo me, rimarreste smarriti. Lacqua ch'io prendo gia mai non si corse, Minerva spira e conducemi Appollo, e nove Muse mi dimostran l'Orse. (II. 1-9) (O you who are within your little bark, eager to listen, following behind my ship that, singing, crosses to deep seas, [turn back to see your shores again:] do not attempt to sail the seas I sail,- you may, by losing sight of me, be left astray. The waves I take were never sailed before, Minerva breathes, Apollo pilots me, and the nine Muses show to me the Bears.)30 As any number of Dante scholars explain, this is perhaps the most striking of all the direct addresses to the reader in the Commedia. Invoking the nau tical metaphor from the opening of the Purgatorio, Dante-poet urges the unprepared seafarer or reader to turn back from following him in his voy age onto the deep and unknown seas that is the figure for his project of writing the Paraiiso, as well as for the unfathomable region itself. In other words, this opening marks the point of passage into a different, "higher" realm of artistic endeavour,- a "crossing-over," as Charles Singleton puts it, from time to eternity.31 These are the words sung by Weronika at the moment of her death, and repeated later at key points in Véroniques TOWARD A NON-EUCLIDEAN CINEMA 41</page><page sequence="9">development. They come to stand as a more than rhetorical warning, therefore, to anyone who might follow behind. Yet the last two lines depart from this tone, refering just to the one—the poet—who ventures out onto these uncharted waters first. Preisner, however, gives the lines to Weronika, who is to Dante's pilgrim (at this point, at least) what Kieslowski is to the poet. The final reference to "the Bears" is to the constellations of Ursa Major and Minor (the Big and Little Dippers) used by sailors in navigation. The Little Dipper's handle terminates in the North Star, and it is at the starry night sky of the Northern Hemisphere that the little Weronika gazes upside-down in the film's opening scene, as she waits with her mother for the appearance of the Pole Star to inaugurate Christmas. The question is: how might Dante's lines relate to the film as a whole? Kieslowski maintains that The Double Life of Véronique "is about sensibility, presentiments and relationships which are difficult to name,which are irra tional. Showing this on film is difficult," he says: "If 1 show too much the mystery disappears,- I can't show too little because then nobody will understand anything" (my emphasis). The Double Life of Ve'ronicjue, in this light, is about the "search for the right balance between the obvious and the mysterious."32 There is a valid analogy between films like The Double Life of Ve'ronicjue and a work like the Commedia, in that, as John Freccero observes, in the Paradiso the poet's "task" is the most formidable: "to repre sent a realm of pure yearning, lost even to memory, and therefore beyond representation."33 On the basis of this admittedly dangerous analogy between the liter ary and the cinematic, it would seem that in The Double Life of Ve'ronicjue Kieslowski faces a comparable challenge: the representation of an "object" so abstract as to be beyond representation in any but the most figurative, displaced, or allegorical of forms,- where the object is in a sense unrepre sentability itself, and where "God," "the infinite," "death," and so forth are the shorthand for this unrepresentability.34 As is well known, Dante sur mounts this problem—perhaps the oldest problem in art (and, to para phrase Kieslowski, perhaps the only subject of literature)—by means of an allegorical language that grows ever more extreme the closer the pilgrim gets to God. In so far as the Commedia as a whole is concerned with the state of the soul in terms of one individual's spiritual journey, medieval allegory dic tates a radically exteriorized depiction of aspects of psychic or moral progress. In a film like Ve'ronicjue this translates into the challenge of repre senting an interiorized subjectivity,- a self that is determined by its differ 42 R. J. A. Kilbourn</page><page sequence="10">ence from what is "outside," and yet in a more fundamental or logically prior way is determined by its relation with the other, even if that other is conceived or figured as somehow an aspect of the self—and yet, paradox ically, at an absolute remove from the self.35 The representation of this inconceivable relation in the non-allegorical, quotidian language of film is what Kieslowski attempts in The Double Life of Véronique■. the filmic "repre sentation" of that "realm of pure yearning, lost even to memory, and there fore beyond representation,"36 in any traditional, positive sense. In The Double Life of Véronique, however, this is neither place nor temporality, but an impossible point of contact. An approach to thinking about this may be found in Kleist, whose essay "On the Marionette Theatre" is predicated on what Dostoevsky might call a "non-Euclidean" worldview. In The Brothers Karamazov, in fact, Dostoevsky has Ivan Karamazov tell his brother Alyosha about certain contemporary mathematicians and philosophers who "dare to dream that two parallel lines, which according to Euclid cannot possibly meet on earth, may perhaps meet somewhere in infinity."37 According to Euclid's axiom of parallels: "Parallel straight lines are straight lines which, being in the same plane and being produced indefi nitely in both directions, do not meet one another in either direction."38 The intention here in bringing non-Euclidean geometry into the discus sion of a film like The Double Life of Véronique is only to provide a framework within which to talk about what might otherwise elude description. 1 am therefore construing the mathematics involved in the same spirit as Kleist:39 as a means to an end beyond the geometric figures themselves. As noted above, "On the Marionette Theatre" was first published in the Berliner Abendblàtter in 1810, sixteen years before the Russian mathematician Nikolai Lobachevsky published his treatise on Non-Euclidean Geometry in 1826, in what is now seen as a major turning point in the history of modern mathematical thought. Non-Euclidean ideas, however, alongside the somewhat higher-profile systems of Kant and Hegel, had already cap tured the attention of non-mathematicians (including many writers,- wit ness Kleist and, at the end of the century, Dostoevsky). But it is of course possible that Lobachevsky's treatise only gave a name to a nexus of ideas literature had already intuited some time before. In his ironically self-dis paraging style Ivan Karamazov gives voice to the profound shift in emphasis from received ways of conceiving the universe to what is doing the con ceiving, to consciousness itself. This is an epistemological shift of great significance. A point extended into a line through Euclidean space implies a passage TOWARD A NON-EUCLIDEAN CINEMA 43</page><page sequence="11">through time. Two such lines running parallel can never meet except in infinity, which is neither spatial nor temporal. The lines are by definition "asymptotic," never meeting, never "falling together," except at infinity, which is another Euclidean way of saying they never meet at all. Therefore, as Ivan points out, these two lines can only meet or come together in a universe conceived in non-Euclidean, non-Kantian, terms. In Kieslowski's film, Véronique and Weronika live two parallel lives which never converge, except in the moment of death, which is to life what infinity is to Euclidean, that is to say, conventionally conceived, time and space. In other words, to meet in infinity is to occupy, however briefly, a point outside time and space, beyond the reach of experience and there fore memory. Much comes to hinge on this notion of not meeting, or of meeting only at infinity: if an infinitely straight line is inconceivable, then infinity can be posited as the point at which two parallel lines, or whatev er they represent, may actually meet. And to dismiss this as mere wordplay is to acknowledge that infinity can only be thought in so far as it is mate rially present, as a sign.41 Kleist metaphorizes this point or moment which is really neither by means of first a geometric and then an optical analogy, where reflective consciousness decreases in direct proportion to the advent of what he calls "Grace" (Grazie):42 "Just as a section drawn through two lines suddenly reappears on the other side after passing through infinity, or as the image in a concave mirror turns up again right in front of us after dwindling into the distance, so grace itself returns when knowledge has as it were gone through an infinity."43 What is often not recognized is the possibility that Kleist's enigmatic text is actually ironic, that he is not so much nostalgi cally desirous of a recuperation of some prelapsarian state of innocence, as he is critical of this very viciously circular thinking that, if followed to its logical extreme, would amount to an advocation of the negation of any semblance of consciousness, Euclidean or otherwise. As the narrator admits at one point: "The human spirit can't be in error when it is non-exis tent"44—and in this reading, "error," from the point of view of the individ ual subject, is a good thing, and freedom from error, whether through regained "innocence," or the replacement of reflective consciousness con stitutive of subjectivity with a puppet's "grace" (Anmut) is tantamount to death. Between life and death, love and art (music), Weronika chooses to sing, abandons her boyfriend, and dies. The moment of Weronika's death, the moment of Véroniques first intuition of profound loss, where Weronika's unfathomable death intersects with Véroniques finite exis 44 R. 1. A. Kilbourn</page><page sequence="12">tence, is also the moment of choice, although Véronique can hardly be conscious of this. Nevertheless, the choice she makes is clear: love over art—either way, it's a bad choice: the second (music) leads to death (as for Weronika), and the first (love) leads to greater self-knowledge and the attendant profound disappointment. Véronique, in a gesture inexplicable to others, rejects the gift of her voice and instead embraces the idea of this shadow-lover, in the process banishing the shadow of the physical death suffered by her counterpart. Alexandre, the lover, appears to fill the void left in Véronique by Weronika's death: he causes Véronique to turn away from Weronika (whom of course she never "knew"), even as he tempts her with snatches of the other's life, in particular a recording of Weronika's last performance, right up to the fatal note (Dante's "l'Orse"), played over the phone. As the title of Kieslowski's film suggests, both of the women are the subject, as both are Véronique,- just as each is the other with respect to the other: whichever occupies the subject position in the discussion is the sub ject at that moment, just as, in the course of the film, the narrative point of-view grants the subject position to each of the women in turn. This sounds self-evident but is perhaps not immediately so, as the two Véroniques (as characters) are distinct individuals, occupying the same time frame (at least until Weronika dies), but living in different places. Therefore, Weronika, in sacrificing herself, makes a gift to Véronique, a gift beyond valuation for its being utterly unintended: the gift of death, to use Derrida's term,45 as a gift of love beyond the constraints of time and space, beyond knowledge, but not, in a sense, beyond a certain appre hending. Véronique, for her part, unwittingly becomes the subject of Alexandre's project of aesthetic objectification. Weronika died as she sang the last word of the passage from Dante's Paradiso: "l'Orse" (the Bears). This final section of Preisner's Concerto is repeated a number of times on the soundtrack, as a kind of aural signifier of death, and as a warning to Véronique. Most significantly, perhaps, it is heard during Alexandre's puppet show, when the ballerina, who had died at the end of her dance, is reborn as an anthropomorphic butterfly. In this sequence, the recumbent puppet is covered by a white death shroud that becomes the cocoon for her metamorphosis. Later, in the hotel room with Alexandre, Véronique wakens and tells him of seeing, as she fell asleep, a sheet falling down upon her. The old trope of artistic "rebirth" is thus transformed into the figure of Véroniques own ironic metamorphosis at the end of the film as one of Alexandre's puppets. Putting comparisons between Dante-poet and Kieslowski aside, within the text of the film TOWARD A NON-EUCLIDEAN CINEMA 45</page><page sequence="13">Véroniques "high artificer" turns out to be the man she thought was her destined lover: Alexandre Fabbri, whose last name is a form of the Italian for maker or inventor, a designation whose significance in Dante's Purgatorio was enhanced retroactively by Eliot's appropriated dedication to Pound that heads "The Wasteland" ("il micjlior Jabbro")46 When Véronique observes Alexandre indirectly, reflected in the mirror as he manipulates his puppets, it is a doubly ironic inversion of a long series of comparable reflections, epitomized by the Faustian scene of the Doctor seeing an image of his womanly ideal in the Witches' mirror,47 doubly ironic, in that Véronique does not realize that she is watching the man who will shortly be manipulating her, who has already mysteriously allegorized her experi ence and that of Weronika in the puppet show he is performing.48 In fact, she misses this because she is watching him, which he, in turn, sees. Kieslowski thus restages the old drama of the artist and the woman who is all in one muse, model, and subject, with the attendant metaphysical implications pushed to the breaking point. In other words, Véronique merely chooses one type of death over another, the death of a dancer who stops dancing, of a singer who stops singing: stasis, silence, death. This is, arguably, the real significance of the aesthetic Kleist mockingly valorizes, and the source of the divided con sciousness that drives Ivan Karamazov mad. The end of The Double Life of Véronique is correspondingly bleak, saved only by the final image (doubled in a mirror's reflection) of Véronique at home, embracing her father. It has been remarked that one's death is what is most properly one's own, that no one else can experience your death for you, in your place. But Kieslowski presents us with a self, Véronique, who is granted the unique and impossible privilege of being in two different places at the same time (a fact which she remarks to Alexandre)—and therefore it is possible for such a self to both give and receive this unthinkable gift, and thus to remain alive, although not without a cost. The film's ending is inherently sad not least because it becomes apparent that Alexandre (like Kierkegaard's Seducer) both "used" her, used her life as aesthetic raw mate rial, at the same time as he leads her, as Virgil leads Dante, to a new level of self-awareness. But, as Kieslowski explains, the moment the mystery was revealed to Véronique, it stopped being mysterious, "it stopped being hers. .. It was no longer personal. It had become a public secret."49 Of course, what Alexandre has perpetrated (with beautiful mastery, true to his last name) is, on another level altogether, also perpetrated by Kieslowski as filmmaker,- but where Alexandre effects an aesthetic convergence of the two Véroniques, Kieslowski has already effected a different kind of con 46 R.

Notes 1. Krzysztof Kieslowski, Kieslowski on Kieslowski, ed. Danusia Stok (London and Boston: Faber and Faber, 1993), 33. 2. Apart from his physical exhaustion after completing work on the trilogy, Kieslowski's decision may have been precipitated by Red's shut-out at Cannes '94, where Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction won the Palme d'Or (Derek Malcolm, "Human Touch of a Polish Master" [obituary], Guardian Weekly [March 24, 1996], 26). Be this as it may, Kieslowski had already foreshadowed his decision in the last of the interviews collected in Kieslowski on Kieslowski, where his concluding statement is a response to the question as to whether he will make any more films: "That's another question all together, and one which I can't answer at the moment. I probably won't" (Kieslowski, 227). In the "Epigraph" to his memoirs, Kieslowski offers two primary reasons for ceasing to make films: his lack of patience for the rigours of filmmaking, and his sense of the insignifi cance of filmmaking as a viable occupation or activity (Kieslowski, xxxiii). 3. Refrain (Poland, 1972): "Documentary about the bureaucracy involved in funerals. Grief and emotions are turned into numbers and a pile of paperwork. Then children are born. And so it goes on and on." (Kieslowski, 241). This anticipates what will become for Kieslowski the corresponding and equally relevant significance of creation and birth, which there is insufficient space here to address. 4. It should be mentioned, however, that both Lane and Malcolm report that, as of his death, Kieslowski was working on a new trilogy structured in terms of Hell, Purgatory and Heaven (see Anthony Lane, Obituary for Krzysztof Kieslowski, New Yorker (April 8, 1996), 107, and Malcolm, 26). 5.

Which even a thorough-going semiotic perspective, no matter how positivist, can still allow as a possibility. Such a perspective, for example, as that implied by Peirce's "gen eral Semiotic," which, as Michael Shapiro explains, "articulates a compass for the analy sis of signs which is as large as the universe itself, for, according to Peirce, 'all this uni verse is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs' ... If anything is a sign, as long as it is capable of being correctly interpreted, then all subjects whatever are capable of being regarded from the semeiotic point of view." (Michael Shapiro, The Sense of Grammar: Language as Semeiotic [Bloomington: Indiana UP, 1983], 25). 11. Cf. Slavoj Zizek, "Paranoia and Politics: Fragments" (forthcoming, 1996), 19-23. 12.

Kieslowski, 193. As his filmography shows, Kieslowski's filmmaking is thoroughly grounded in documentary (ibid., xiii). Arguably, his work can be defined as partaking, stylistically and conceptually, in more-or-less equal measure, of two extremes: down-to earth documentary "realism" or vérité (the political), and a much harder to define quali ty of, for lack of a better word, "literariness" (the individual/ethical)(xxi). 14. It would be nothing new to assert that negation is a productive force at the heart of every signifying act, that it is not merely constitutive of "literariness," as Paul De Man suggests ("The Resistance to Theory," The Resistance to Theory [Minneapolis: U of Minnesota, 1986], 10), but of language, as Kenneth Burke, Heidegger and Giorgio Agamben, for example, variously suggest (see: Negation, Critical Theory, and Postmodern Textuality, ed., Daniel Fischlin [Dordrecht, Boston, London: Kluwer, 1994], 1-37). 15. Cf. Brian Rotman, Ad Infinitum—The Ghost in Turing's Machine: Taking Cod Out of Mathematics and Putting the Body Back in: An Essay in Corporeal Semiotics (Stanford: Stanford UP, 1993), 118: "The impact of non-Euclidean geometries on Kantian argu ments for the a priori Euclidean nature of space is well known." 16. Cf. the rigorously Lacanian analysis of the film by Ellie Ragland and Elizabeth Wright: "The Double Life of Véronique : An Inquiry into the Existence of Woman," Psychoanalytic Psychology (1993, 10 [3]), 481-86. The Lacanian framework is a very useful one up to a point, but there are certain significant aspects of Kieslowski's film (such as the nature of Véronique's relationship to Alexandre) for which it simply cannot account. To claim, as Ragland and Wright do, that Véronique flees Alexandre "in panic," because "she cannot imagine that she can completely please [him]," is a blatant misrep resentation (485). 17. Kieslowski explains that Véronique's profession, her passion—her identity-is based on an incidental character in Decalogue 9: the young woman who is gifted with a beautiful voice and afflicted with a weak heart (Kieslowski, 177). 18. See Kieslowski, 260-61. Call it the double life of The Double Life of Véronique: in the end, two versions of the film were released, with two slightly different endings, the one for North American consumption being less ambiguous, as Kieslowski was afraid that we wouldn't grasp that the man Véronique embraces at the end is in fact her father, that she has fled Alexandre (at least temporarily) and returned to her family home (188). In his memoirs he remarks: "For us, Europeans, going back to the family home represents a certain value which exists in our traditions, in our history and also in our culture. You can find it in the Odyssey , and literature, theatre and art through the ages have very often taken up the subject of the family home as a place which constitutes a set of values. Particularly for us Poles, who are very romantic, the family home is an essential point in our lives. And that's why I ended the film the way I did. But I realized that nobody understood it in America" (7). This from a man whose family never had a permanent home, since, in the wake of the Second World War his father had to move continually, from one sanatorium town to another, in search of relief from his tuberculo sis (xiv; 2-5). 19. Kieslowski, 79, in a discussion of No End (Poland, 1984). Extrapolating from this, he posits the existence of "a need within us-not only a need but also a fundamental kind of feeling-to believe that those who have gone and whom we dearly loved, who were important to us, are constantly within or around us. I'm not thinking about calling up spirits; I mean that they exist within us as somebody who judges us ... even though they're not there anymore, even though they're dead" (Kieslowski, 134). 20. Kieslowski, 131. 21. Politics remains a background presence in The Double Life of Véronique, as here. Later, while Alexandre is waiting for Véronique in the St. Lazare station, a car parked across 48 R. J. A. Kilbourn</page><page sequence="16">the street explodes—a possible act of terrorism, entirely incidental to the principal action centred around two relationships, one mysterious (Véronique and Alexandre), and the other as it were mystical (Véronique and Weronika). And, as Derrida remarks, "Politics excludes the mystical" (Jacques Derrida, The Gift of Death, trans., David Wills [Chicago and London: University of Chicago, 1995], 34). The name of the station, "St. Lazare," bears a self-evident significance for the relationship between the two Veroniques. 22. Zizek, 4. 23. Kieslowski, 186. 24. Ragland and Wright, 484. 25.

"The interior of a human being is full of mystery, full of things that are not expressed or said, full of intuitions, and full of fear," says Kieslowski.

Rotman, 117-18. 41. For the semiotically biased Rotman, the thought of infinity (in mathematics, at least) is inseparable from its being written (eg. 35). Levinas, in Totality and Infinity, goes beyond this, foregrounding the paradox inherent in the idea of the infinite: "The production of the infinite entity is inseparable from the idea of infinity, for it is precisely in the dispro portion between the idea of infinity and the infinity of which it is the idea that this exceeding of limits is produced. The idea of infinity is the mode of being, the infinition, of infinity" (26). TOWARD A NON-EUCLIDEAN CINEMA 49</page><page sequence="17">God's gift of grace, as distinguished from "Anmut," the physical grace that is the condi tion for Beauty (see: Heinrich von Kleist, "On the Marionette Theatre," trans. Idris Parry, Essays on Dolls (London: Syrens, 1994]). Kleist, 12. Kleist, 6: a strange echo of the enigmatic words of the Lord in the "Prologue" to Faust Part I: "Man errs, till he has ceased to strive" (I. 317). In The Gift of Death Derrida elaborates the Czech philosopher Jan Patocka's notion of the gift of death, which conforms generally to the paradoxical logic of the gift, but refers specifically to the giving of nothing but goodness itself, "a goodness that must not only forget itself but whose source remains inaccessible to the donee. The latter receives by means of a dissymmetry of the gift that is also a death, a death given, the gift of a death that arrives in one way but not another" (Derrida, 41). However, "to have the experience of one's absolute singularity and apprehend one's own death, amounts to the same thing. Death is very much that which nobody else can undergo or confront in my place. My irreplaceability is therefore conferred, delivered, 'given,' one can say, by death" (ibid.). Dante's tribute to the Provençal poet Arnaut Daniel (Purgatorio XXVI. 117). Véronique's father is also a "fabbro" of a kind, in that he restores furniture and concocts perfumes in his country house. It is Weronika's artist father, however, who paints the picture of the town church which later haunts Véronique. Faust Part I, sc. 9, 2429-40. Cf. A Short Film About Love (Poland, 1988). The narrative of The Double Life of Véronique inverts the earlier film's perspectival structure, in so far as we watch the loved one (object) who is being watched by the lover, who is invisible or unknown to the loved one for much of the film's second half. This granting of the loved one a point of-view in a sense grants her (Véronique) a subjectivity she formerly lacked, subverting the convention of romantic objectification, which is revealed at the end to be operating on an entirely other, perhaps metaphysical, level (Kieslowski, 169).
