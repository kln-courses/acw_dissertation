<plain_text><page sequence="1">Studies in the Origins of Early Islamic Culture and Tradition By Michael Cook (Aldershot: Ashgate/Variorum Collected Studies Series, 2004), 370 pp. Price HB Â£62.50. ISBN 0-86078-916-0. This volume collects, and makes accessible to scholars, who would otherwise have to spend considerable time and effort in locating some of them, twelve important articles by Michael Cook. The range of topics covered attests to Cook's impressive knowledge and expertise in the early period of Islamic history and culture. His publications have enjoyed great success; some have caused controversy. Each of the twelve articles included in this volume has had a great impact on recent scholarship, in some cases necessitating major revisions in our understanding of and approaches to the sources. The first article deals with the beginnings of kaldm and its possible roots in Syriac Christian theological argumentation. It remains a must-read for students and scholars, even though the examples of Syriac texts that Cook draws upon to make his case have been published. The second article, which examines medieval Egyptian treatment of Pharaonic history, has opened the way for a number of scholars to pursue the topic more thoroughly. Articles 3 and 4 relate to Islamic dietary laws, and investigate their relationship to, and possible influence from,</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS IO3 Jewish and Christian dietary laws. Article 5 raises the reverse issue of a possible influence of Islam on Judaism, in particular with respect to the Jewish Karaites and Islamic theology (this subject has been discussed in much more detail by scholars like Haggai bin Shammai and David Sklare). Article 6 tests the applicability of the two Weberian notions of sect and church to Islam and Islamic sects. Articles 7-9 investigate themes within Islamic eschatology and apocalypti cism. Article 7 provides an overview of the presentation of the Byzantine Heraclian dynasty in early Islamic eschatological literature (this subject has recently received extensive examination, namely the studies by David Cook, Suliman Bashear, and Nadia Maria El-Cheikh). Article 8 analyses the content of apocalyptic and eschatological traditions in order to determine whether it is of help in establishing their date of composition. Article 9, again on the issue of influences, is a short overview of an apocalyptic story, whose origin must have been a Syriac Christian text. Article 10 discusses the problem of writing in early Islam (this topic has been exhaustively treated by Gregor Schoeler, in no less than four articles in German and one monograph in French). Article 11 takes up a legal issue, namely the penalty on adultery of stoning, defended by Ibn Qutayba and some other scholars, by bringing to the debate the traditions about monkeys, which are said to also apply the stoning penalty to adultery, and which leads to issues of anthropomorphism and metamorphosis. And the last, Article 12, examines reports about an early Qur'an codex, very likely from the first/seventh century, which was in the possession of Malik b. Anas, who claimed it to have been his grandfather's, and which, as Cook shows, contains some variations from the Madina codex. This volume is particularly welcome because of its exhaustive index of names, subjects, and technical terms, thus making the articles easily searchable and enhancing their utility for scholars. Moreover, articles 4 and 10 have detailed tables of contents, and article 10 has two comprehensive indices of its own appended to it. Suleiman A.
