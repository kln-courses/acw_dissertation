<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stages of the Sublime in North America Martin Donougho How does one stand To behold the sublime? (Wallace Stevens, "The American Sublime," from Ideas of Order)* A contemporary French theorist tells us that "[t]he sublime is in fashion (a la mode)"-and not only in France, nor just in theory.l He goes on to remark that in fact the sublime was inevitably "de la mode... because it has always concerned a break within or from aesthetics." It marks the instance of discontinuity in experience, the moment of loss and disfigurement. What goes unremarked, however, is the paradox by which that moment is registered in experience, enabling the sublime to retain a measure of aesthetic coherence. So understood, it is figured as modern, modernist (Adorno), or even (in Lyotard's attention to "the sublime is now") postmodern.2 It might be that our preoccupation with the status of modernity and modernism helps explain the current fashion for talk of the sublime. Such talk is in any event quite different from an eighteenth-century and equally a Romantic interest in certain features of experience adjudged to be sublime. True, the sublime has by now come to form part of the furniture of our common world (artistic, philosophical, or everyday). Yet that should not blind us to the attendant fact that-as with other categories of aesthetics-the sublime is historically specific, and has been taken in a variety of ways. We should be wary of reifying it, * I should like to thankJim Elkins, Suzanne Guerlac, and Omar Lughod for reading earlier versions of this paper. MLN 115 (2000): 909-940 ? 2000 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">MARTIN DONOUGHO therefore, but equally wary of reading one sense of the sublime backwards or forwards into another time period, thus assimilating history to theory. For all its historical contingency, we may nonethe- less continue to speak of the sublime, or more cautiously, of styles of the sublime. I propose however to discuss another aspect of the sublime, or rather, talk of the sublime. It is an aspect only recently come to the fore-although you could argue that it was always implicit, especially in view of the term's historicity, that is, its existence in a specific discourse rather than as an objective order discourse refers to. I wish to focus less on the phenomenality-however that is to be de- scribed-and more on the pragmatics of the sublime: what is done or performed in judging or experiencing something to be sublime, along with often tacit assumptions made about how others will likely receive it. For one thing, given that the sublime has usually been taken as implicating subjectivity or selfhood in some crucial way, a focus on performativity might prove revealing of this process. Moreover, the problem of how the self seems prior to while presupposing a discourse of subjectivity-a set of shared conventions-is one that the experi- ence of the sublime might highlight, if not perhaps resolve. (A caveat is in order: this should not be taken as an attempt to reduce the sublime, or indeed subjectivity, to a mere figment or projection.) Taking a performative angle on the sublime might reveal something about how we typically approach the world, or at least some literary reflection of the world. Lastly, a performative approach runs parallel to some recent moves in aesthetics to take mimesis as simulation rather than representation or imitation (though I shall not be concerned with the ontological and emotive interests displayed in such work).3 In the perspective opened up by sublime pragmatics, Stevens' question appears astute. For how does one stand to behold the sublime, when beholding itself is in question? Moreover, how does one stand to behold-that is, in theory-a beholding of the sublime? Judgments of the sublime are not just performatives, but also reflexive in form. It is not the least obscure feature of the sublime that its theory tends to mimic the gesture of subjective projection into nature found in the sublime itself-a move Kant labels "subreption."4 The theory itself verges on becoming sublime, as Gibbon suggested of reading Longinus.5 Such constitutive reflexivity in the critical rhetoric of the sublime forms the heart of my topic. At issue, it seems to me, is whether the dynamic of subreption really empowers judgments on the sublime-likewise the theory of the sublime-or whether, on the 910</page><page sequence="3">M L N contrary, the very reflection on that dynamic tends towards undoing its authority. I limit my remarks to the rhetorical or literary sublime, if only because (as Hegel observed) words themselves are sublime in the disjunction of formal appearance and meaning or power invoked.6 Rather than step straight into the abyss, I discuss a peculiar develop- ment over the last twenty-five years or so in what may be called (for want of another phrase) "the American sublime": a story about a specific practice in literary criticism, its subversion or deconstruction in theory, followed by tentative efforts to recover some of its appeal. I try to strike a balance between general overview of the action and detailed character description or analysis, in the hope of staying neutral on the issue whether it is a merely historical phenomenon or whether it does not discover a basic truth about the sublime (that is, about talk of the sublime). The first part sets the scene: a certain approach to literary Romanticism during the 1960s and 70s sympa- thetic to Kant's theory of sublimity. The second section focusses on the pragmatics of its characteristic position, what work the sublime does and what assumptions are thus made. The third turns to Paul de Man's deconstructive critique of the aesthetics of the sublime. And the fourth section looks at an attempted recovery of the sublime in the linkage between human agency, literary interest, and liberal politics. These various episodes amount to a surprising and perhaps not yet completed excursus in aesthetic theory. 1. How does one stand, then, to theorize the sublime? One might begin in New Haven, and with the phenomenon of "the Romantic sub- lime"-so-called after the title of a book by Thomas Weiskel which appeared (posthumously) in 1976.7 An alternative name would be "the Yale sublime" in honor of an entire group-prominent among them Geoffrey Hartman and Harold Bloom-who wrote about the tendency in Romantics such as Wordsworth or Emerson to invest in a specular transcendence, or to project oneself into what Wordsworth called "the abyss of idealism."8 Weiskel's book marks the watershed of this critical practice; for it both traced a shared Kantian provenance, and suggested the limits of the model of subjectivity that emerged in the generation following Kant. Moreover, the book helped throw into relief a problematic that continues to beset literary criticism: whether Romanticism can properly be recovered in a Romantic manner, that 911</page><page sequence="4">MARTIN DONOUGHO is, bowing towards the authority of poetic symbol, epiphany and revelation.9 Should the critic seek to emulate the example set in poetic experience, or attempt rather to impose a sceptical distance from the text or phenomena scrutinized? Is the lot of the critic repetition of poetic power, or is it knowledge of its illusory nature? At any rate, writers during the 1980s tended often to revise the Romantic model, whether by complicating the canon with "minor" or subver- sive figures such as Byron, by contextualizing it either historically- pointing to "the taming of romanticism" (Nemoianou) through irony and dialectics-or politically-sometimes by referring to a "Romantic ideology" (McGann)-or finally by deconstructing the model from within (and within Yale, as we shall see).10 Back to Kant, however, in order to set the scene for what follows. One description of the sublime Kant gives is that "it is an object (of nature) the representation (Vorstellung) of which determines the mind (das Gemiit) to think of nature's unattainability in terms of presentation (Darstellung) of ideas" (CJ 268/127). The characteristic movement Kant finds or posits in experience of the sublime (more especially in its "mathematical" or cognitive aspect) may be described as proceeding from ordinary perception of objects, via a felt break or disproportion between reason (ideas of nature) and representational imagination, to a final recuperative reminder of the supersensible ground of human powers in the rational will. We-and Kant appeals to our common experience-we initially feel pain at this confusing sense of formlessness, then pleasurable relief in returning to our- selves and the thought of our moral nature. As Kant puts it, "the feeling of the sublime is a pleasure that arises only indirectly: it is produced by the momentary inhibition [Hemmung] of the vital forces followed at once by an outpouring [Ergiessung] all the stronger ..." (CJ ? 23, 245/98). Of course, Kant claims to be doing more than empirical description of a peculiar sentiment and its dynamics. Judging a natural object sublime is to presume an a priori validity; the judgment is presumptively necessary in mode and universal in scope, because founded in human rationality. In that respect the aesthetic judgment on the sublime resembles the judgment of beauty. Both are reflective, that is, they do not determine natural objects but thematize the relation of our faculties to nature in general. Yet at this point there enter three problems especially troubling for Romantic practice. In the first place, Kant is emphatic that the sublime concerns what is subjectively purposive-the use we make of an object rather than the object itself (CJ280/142). And at the end of? 23 (CJ246/100) he 912</page><page sequence="5">M L N argues that whereas the modality of natural beauty would have us seeking a ground outside ourselves-not simply perhaps because it concerns form in nature, but because we are led to think that nature in itself is suited to our understanding-with the sublime we tend to place the ground within ourselves. Kant even suggests that the sublime is hence ancillary to the beautiful, since its claims are less ambitious-though many have noted that such topics as the sublime, the human, genius, aesthetic ideas, and art, all tend to offset the critique of taste (judgments of natural beauty) from which Kant started out. With regard to the pragmatic concerns of my essay, it is notable that the danger of "subreption"-projecting subjective pur- posiveness upon objects in nature-is greater with the sublime than with the beautiful, since with the latter there is at least some objective claim being made. At the same time, whatever the transcendental explanation of the judgment of the sublime might be, in appearance at least it remains objective; its topic comprises phenomena in nature, even if that is unmasked as a mere fafon de parler. Second, it is unclear how either a deduction or critique of the judgment of sublimity might do any substantive work. Thus Kant notes (CJ 280/142-43) that with an exposition of the judgment-the analysis of its reflective contents, namely, the subjective purpose of our cognitive faculties and their inner connexion with our moral faculty or will-he has already given its deduction. It is founded not in the faculty of taste (as with the judgment of the beautiful), but in moral rather than aesthetic feeling. The presumption I have that all must agree with myjudgment is one derived from my moral nature. A recent commentator has noted this "ethical turn" in Kant's think- ing.11 Yet it is not at all clear in Kant's text just what the moral relevance of the feeling of the sublime should amount to, aestheti- cally speaking.12 In that sense too no specifically aesthetic critique is possible (unless we mean critique of the improper, non-ironic use of subreption); it would devolve upon a critique of practical judgment. We can only take note (but this is an anthropological observation) that the ability to judge the sublime (if one has it at all) will presuppose a degree of moral cultivation or Bildung (CJ 265-66/125).13 The most we can claim would be that persons can and ought to develop this feeling for moral ideas. At the same time, judgment on the sublime remains disinterested, that is, aesthetic. This wavering between an aesthetic register and its ethical unmasking is one to return to. Third and most important here is the thinness or lability of the Kantian subject. Whether or not the transcendental unity of 913</page><page sequence="6">MARTIN DONOUGHO apperception denotes some individual or merely a function, and whether or no it betrays (as some have argued) a certain "weakening" tendency, it is far from clear that the moral subject offers anything more consistent.14 For the moral subject is permanently split between a finite, embodied state and a condition of divine rationality; and moreover it is not clearly identical with the self, let alone "my" self. Nor, finally, may Kant appeal to the "subject of taste"-whoever is supposed to pass judgment on the beautiful in nature-for no such grounding is available with the sublime. The identity of the subject judging of the sublime is just what comes under scrutiny with the Romantic or Yale sublime. Exactly who experiences the movement towards the abyss and then back into itself? And is the experience rather of cognitive dissonance or of moral harmony? Turning now to Weiskel, I must concede that although he does indeed take up Kant's theory, his is a "strong" reading of the text, not primarily a philosophical analysis. Weiskel aims at once to question Kant's terms, to interpret and broaden them, and (not least) to practise literary criticism in the light of his broadened model. In Weiskel's book the characteristic movement of the mind or subject found in the Kantian sublime receives a semiotic cum psychoanalyti- cal reading that is nothing short of virtuoso (though I pass over those features here). A summary of Weiskel's basic view of the mental economy at work is found in the following quote: The cause of the sublime is the aggrandizement of reason at the expense of reality and the imaginary apprehension of reality.15 Clearly Weiskel is taking exception here to what he dubs an ideologi- cal move. He wonders how it is possible for reason to play two distinct roles in consciousness, that is, both as Idea of nature qua totality and as the idea of the will to which the subject retreats. From his viewpoint, the account offered in the Third Critique invites a dialectical interpretation of Kant's procedure, namely, that Kant in fact constructs this narrative of imaginative failure and discovery of true self in a transcendental calling (Bestimmung). Weiskel thus undermines Kant's purportedly aesthetic resolution, that is, with respect to a self-sufficient, disinterested universality (on p. 85 we read that aesthetics is at present an archaic enterprise). He substitutes a reductive reading of Kant's description (a) as what he dubs a "fictional" structure-the "as if" of Schillerian "semblance"-which (b) operates according to an implicit scenario, "an interplay of submerged, personified agencies profoundly congruent to the imagi- 914</page><page sequence="7">M L N native logic dramatized in many Romantic poems" (85). That initial step-taking his distance from Kant's model and its "factitious transcendence" (84)-then leads to several others. Briefly, -With Wordsworth's "egotistical" sublime, the mental economy of what is now called Kant's "negative" sublime-imagination's reversal followed by recovery in intimation of practical reason-is understood as having been frozen or crystallized into a structure. The finite ego now takes centre- stage, its transcendental calling made habitual, namely, as Imagination. -In turn, the egotistical sublime is identified with Hegel's "positive" or pantheistic sublime, which Hegel thought characteristic of an oriental worldview. For Hegel it resolves into the true, or "negative," sublime exemplified in Biblical Psalms and so on (poetry that exacerbates the distance between inner and outer, subject and fallen nature). Hegel is said here to have projected a dialectic constitutive of the Romantic sublime back into cultural history. Weiskel would reverse this, to think of Romantic poetics as continually shifting from positive, unmediated vision through memory to the opposition of nature and imagination, and further, to a fully mediating irony-retreat, as Keats has it, "to my sole self," which is no character at all. -Weiskel also gives a semiological translation of the polarity (25ff.). The "negative" sublime is framed as metaphorical: the poet seeks to stabilize an "excess" of signifiers by hinting at an unattainable meaning, a supersensible ground. The "positive" sublime then becomes metonymical: it seeks to avoid fixation on an omnipotent meaning by successive displacements (Words- worth's "And I have felt. . ."-this, and that, etc.) -Alternatively, Weiskel gives an epistemological formulation: The dialec- tic passes from innocent belief in poetic semblance and its power to a disillusionment, from sublimation to desublimation. The latter moment is described as "a poetry sceptical of the fictional ladders which rise out of the rag and bone shop of the heart" (32). Most Romantic poems oscillate between the two extremes, the poetic self tossed back and forth between identification with the ideal on the one hand, wholesale disenchantment on the other.16 We should qualify this disenchantment however: what occurs is mimesis of that moment, for after all it is still poetry about the foul rag and bone shop, not the actual goods. -Yet the reader of Weiskel will detect an ambivalence throughout, not to say conflict (a point to come back to). Weiskel admits that "[s]ublimation may in fact be the condition under which an "I" can enter a poem at all" (69)-and presumably also the condition under which the critic can offer 915</page><page sequence="8">MARTIN DONOUGHO a reading, and the reader follow along. He himself clearly identifies with Wordsworth's gestures of identification, though not with the full-blown egotistical sublime. Moreover his last chapter is devoted to what he calls the "liminal" sublime, which purports (as he presents it) to go beyond identity or self altogether, yet in an "intensified mimesis" of the voices of self and a being beyond self. He adduces for the latter Wordsworth's prophetic mode, and the subjunctive mood of "Let there be. . ."7 In short, he himself retains an investment in sublime effects, an uncertain faith in metaphor. Aiming to undermine Kant's aesthetic standpoint, he nevertheless ends up, tacitly or expressly, a subscriber to some kind of aesthetic illusion, though its status or modality is never declared. Let me extend this point. Even while defusing or de-idealizing the Romantic sublime, Weiskel gives it a dialectical reading which to some will seem too Hegelian by half.18 Weiskel in fact does not deny that he reads Kant through the eyes of the Idealists. He interprets the Kantian "fiction" as seeking to ground subjectivity, whether in aes- thetic or in hermeneutic mode. The poetic subject would here be supposed to find or recognize itself in the experience of the sub- lime.19 Such a reading could well be taken as drawing out implications in Kant, whose account of aesthetic subjectivity remains thin, as remarked. Yet there is a difficulty here, one already hinted at in noting that there can be no critique of the sublime proper to aesthetics. The sublime is marked by a disparity between reason and imagination, or between failure and recuperation. That rules out any necessary link with human self-understanding of the sort Kant claims forjudgments of taste (sc. of the beautiful), even though the negative experience is said to give pleasure. Kant does specify a necessity, true, but it relates to our moral nature, not our roots in the sensus communis.20 Weiskel not only sees this, but also purports to see through Kant's fictional model of a personified "mind" shuttling to and fro at the call of nature (now external, now internal). In Weiskel, the lack of self-definition surfaces in the first place as an ambivalence between the egotistical and the negative sublime, or better, between sublimation and desublimation-the latter amount- ing to the impossible experience of a loss of self. Which of these paths, we may then wonder, is the anxious poetic ego to identify with? Secondly, Weiskel severely doubts whether Kant really believed in the sublime, and whether he was serious e.g. about the danger of reason's drowning in imagination's disorder. If we determine it as fiction, the poet or reader is no more than indirectly invested in it. I might add that this fictional (sc. imaginary) mode is already suggested in Kant's 916</page><page sequence="9">M L N early text, Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens (1755), which reflects a post-Copernican viewpoint: not a "God's eye view" of a Leibnizian theodicy e.g., but the "view from nowhere" of a thor- oughgoing perspectivism.2' Although in his later critical philosophy Kant is able to ward off sceptical doubts, that can only be at the cost of vaunted knowledge of infinite space. The sublime prospect of the starry heavens, as considered in the Third Critique, can only be a reflective consideration. Alluding to his earlier work,22 Kant empha- sizes in his "General Remark" that the stars should not be imagined as supporting inhabited worlds, but "as a vast all-encompassing vault (Gewolbe)" (CJ 270/130), that is, non-teleologically, impersonally (though "vault" is metaphorical enough one might think, hinting at an architecture, if not purpose). We are not warranted in ascribing to them any sort of human design or benefit. Similarly with the ocean, which should be viewed "as the poets do, merely according to what is manifest to the eye (was der Augenschein zeigt)"23-if calm as a "water- mirror," if rough, as abysmal (again, metaphor is hard to resist). For the previous perspectival fiction Kant substitutes a reflective judg- ment, one making no claims about the actual purposiveness or human significance of the cosmos. Lastly, with the dynamic sublime, it is no psychological or even phenomenological experience Kant describes, but a distanced and reflective movement of thought. He is speaking not of the experience of safe remove, but of a reflective removal, the "as it were, threatening rocks" [my emphasis].24 Well, the hard-headed (yet "cultivated") reader may ask, do they seem threat- ening or not? It is as if the judgment of the sublime holds the very question in abeyance. True, Kant needs that suspension-the "as it were"-to keep fanaticism ("raving with reason") at bay, which reflective judgment is able to do "because there the presentation (Darstellung) is merely negative" (CJ 275/135). Yet his and (as his readers) our subjective investment is thereby rendered shaky. These preliminaries provoke a redefinition of the problem, having to do with the very staging of Weiskel's "imaginary transcripts." It is only too easy to identify Kant as the stage director, to allege that the terms of sublime experience are factitious or at best merely regula- tive. At the same time, we cannot appeal to a non-human or divine intelligence as author of our destiny. Instead Weiskel supposes (with Wordsworth) that the finite self subjunctively imagines a (non- personal) agent delimiting its experience. But one may ask how that differs from Kant's secondary or reflective remove and whether it resolves the question of authorship. And further-alluding to the 917</page><page sequence="10">MARTIN DONOUGHO root meaning of "ex-perire"-just who is envisaged "going through" the experience of the sublime? Let us assume that readers of the text observe the play of poetic personae as between rational and imagina- tive selves. The question then is how far they should be taken to identify with it-it is the "reader's" sublime, after all-and further, whether they identify with imagination or with reason. And what of Weiskel's own investment in the "mental fight" he analyzes? Where does he stand towards the play of impersonation? Does he believe in the reflective sublime? (Such rejoinders are not unfair: they merely follow up the performative or dramaturgical implications of Weiskel's own model.) 2. As Neil Hertz soon pointed out, Weiskel displays in his book the very same anxiety about the fictionality of selfhood that he sees at issue in Wordsworth's dramatic monologues. He joins in the mimetic struggle between a self that finds imaginary relief in natural objects and the intelligible self claiming a total overview. Moreover, he glimpses the irony of his own position, and its instability.25 Such a reflexive critique could be broadened to cover the entire rhetoric of voice or address implicit in theorizing the sublime. In other words, it is not merely a quest for subjectivity, for a supersensible self that will ground experience, but also a linguistic matter of performative consistency. Thus Longinus is presented by Hertz and in a similar way by Suzanne Guerlac as sliding artfully between the various positions of speaker and hearer, and between natural and figurative effect.26 Guerlac writes, for example, of a discursive slippage between the subject of enonciation and that of the enonc--between the performer of speech acts and the self it might name or refer to, or "I" and "me." It is because Longinus can be read as playing on these registers that Paul de Man could later refer to the "Longinian" and the "Romantic" sublime as being practically synonymous: both appeal to a characteristic experience and elicit it through the pragmatics of utterance, the performative effect. Moreover, part of the secret of the Longinian sublime's power is that it must keep quiet about the play of personae. For the same reason, those (like Harold Bloom) who wish to keep the critical crisis going-perhaps to invoke the transcenden- tal aura or shock of modernism-must persist in their mimetic "quoting." Bloom must reject what hewould interpret as the invitation to recite a deconstructive scenario, troping time into language: the 918</page><page sequence="11">ML N experience of blockage and conflict cannot be explained away by referring it to a system of tropes.27 At any rate, judged in the perspective of enunciative functions, what Kant may be seen as doing is presenting and representing-and enjoining identification with-an exchange between empirical and intelligible egos, individual and universal roles, imaginative percep- tion and the thought of its terms of possibility. Weiskel too becomes guilty of playing a role on a stage of his own devising, and perhaps also of making his reader an accomplice. A similar comment on how spectatorship and participation are reflexively intertwined is made by Peter de Bolla in distinguishing between a discourse on and a discourse of the sublime.28 The former he understands in quasi-Foucauldian style as technical knowledge of how sublime affects are properly produced in a well-defined practice (reading, viewing landscape, oratory, etc.). A discourse of the sublime produces the very category it meant to analyze, and hence a space for experience of the sublime. Such a discourse is "transformational" in that it spreads over several areas of knowledge, rendering their boundaries unstable-indeed, we meta-analysts face the danger that no discourse will prove stable enough for our purpose. De Bolla's self- consciously complex study analyses the pre-Kantian sublime, and specifically English theories of the 1760s. This has two moments: First, he rejects the tendency of those like Monk who would unify the eighteenth-century through the lens of the Kantian critical project (in particular its invocation of cognitive or moral autonomy), as if this were its natural telos.29 Second, he sees the subject as dispersed over diverse "subject effects" (or functions), located in various rhetorical and pedagogical practices treating bodily demeanor. Yet the sublime typically has to do with a certain excess or transport which the theory declares it cannot control (that is, reduce to technical rules of production)-a declaration made in order to hide its own constitu- tive activity.30 It is tempting retrospectively to identify such excess with transcendental subjectivity, and moreover, to explore links with the subject qua autonomous, intending agent. That temptation de Bolla resists. De Bolla is here close to Hertz in holding subjectivity hostage to a cognitive or affective excess which can be converted to a certain self-identification-though he is interested more in social mecha- nisms (such as discourses of debt or of nationalism) than in psycho- analytic processes. And yet his scepticism has to face up to his own theoretical investments in giving an account of such theoretical blindness (he even acknowledges de Man's similar dilemma). 919</page><page sequence="12">MARTIN DONOUGHO As before we may pose the same question: where does the author stand, to behold a sublime that he places neutrally in a discourse of the subject? He aims to escape the tendency towards "eversion" (Kant's subreption) inherent in the sublime, and to do so by rendering the subject "strange," "beside itself," in much the same way as mid-career Foucault. At a further remove, de Bolla's own discursive enterprise becomes self-consciously problematic-again just as with Foucault's. It is not just a theory of the sublime, then, but also-to appeal to David Robert's apt phrase-a "sublime theory," one that tacitly owns up to its involvement in the object of study.3' No escape therefore. Nevertheless de Bolla expresses the hope that such baring of the discursive device may help us cope with ideological mechanisms he sees still at work in our own day. Of course, de Bolla does not address the Kantian sublime as such; he limits himself to a pre-Kantian subjectivity. What might a decentring approach to Kantian subjectivity look like? There are indeed a few comparable studies of Kant's aesthetics of beauty, if not the sublime, that is, undertaken from an externalist perspective on rhetorical or social practices. One might mention here Ian Hunter on Schillerian pedagogy, David Lloyd on Kant's "examples," or Pierre Bourdieu on the social status bound up with the matter of taste.32 But we have already noted the special problem that whereas Kantian judgments of taste invoke a social dimension, a sensus communis, a supposedly rational demand for universal agreement, the sublime is peculiar, in Kant's book, for its dependence on nothing but a properly developed moral attunement or receptivity to ideas: either you have the Bildung for it, or you don't. (To be sure, you might develop your moral potential, and so perhaps learn how to apply sublime judgments; but in transcendental terms that is a moral rather than aesthetic matter.) In Derrida's book, the sublime has no "parergon," or frame; for Lyotard, it just happens (or not).33 I will not pursue the exegetical problems involved. It is enough for now to point at the lability notjust of Kantian subjectivity and its Romantic epigones, but equally of the gestural or mimetic texture of sublime discourse. What are we to go on, when the subject experiencing or reflecting on the sublime lacks not just epistemological or moral but also social context? What is to ground or at least regulate self identity? What scenario or technology is to keep it within bounds? That now sets the stage for the next act in the story. 920</page><page sequence="13">M L N 3. Let us return to Yale in the late 70s and early 80s-an exciting time and place to be-and take up Paul de Man's powerful deconstructive critique of "the Romantic sublime." De Man had come to see it as a particular version of "aesthetic ideology," viz. the "confusion of linguistic with natural reality."34 The attack takes aim at the theatrical or mimetic model that-with progressively broadening irony-Kant, Weiskel, and even Hertz adopt.35 One should note that it was not only his Yale colleagues that de Man assailed, it was also an earlier critical self. During the 60s and 70s de Man had shifted from a phenomeno- logical emphasis on temporal experience and its limits, first to a "rhetoric of temporality" (irony and allegory conceived as articula- tions of a divided self), then finally to a wholesale troping of the self as no more than a figure of speech, a purely linguistic invention. In that last period de Man turned to and against the aesthetic formal- ism-the mimetic prosopopoeia-of Kant, Schiller, and Hegel, whose texts he "read" in a layered, complex way which I can only sketch here. Briefly, (i) he sought to lay bare their linguistic (or "theoretical") structures, as revealed in a break in register or voice. He wanted thus to show the unmotivated basis of metaphor and symbol. Both he saw as substitutive tropes which he would reduce to a formal juxtaposi- tion; yet he did so not in the name of structuralist "grammar" (Riffaterre, Greimas), but in order to display the workings of the inhuman textual machine and a certain "pathos of apathy."36 For him "linguisticality" was a "material" condition, but less as a liberating horizon (as with historical materialism) than as inevitable constraint. In a late essay on Walter Benjamin, de Man remarks "that it is not at all clear that language is in any sense human"-a supposition devoid even of existentialist pangs about transcendental homelessness.37 Complementing such inhuman syntactics comes (ii) a pragmatics of imposition or positing (Setzung) of meaning-"inscription" in the further sense of the violent (and equally inhuman) eruption of language into the world.38 In this performative register, de Man explores the punctual, random repetition of language in Kant's or Hegel's discussion of "power"-it is in part the persuasive power of language itself that is at issue. It might seem odd that de Man accords agency to language, to the system of language and material signifiers, devoid of intentionality. Is this Romantic mysticism, or some illicit prosopopoeia-as if language itself could live-or is it rather a 921</page><page sequence="14">MARTIN DONOUGHO necessary move in the practice of ideological critique, in the course of which the opposite process-reification or naturalization of the constructed-comes to be isolated and shown up?39 The latter seems most plausible, especially when de Man is himself well aware of the circularities that beset Romantic reflection owing to its repudiation of the intersubjective norms of ordinary language. However, (iii) this thetic determinism is elided in any reading of the text, which figures it into semantic continuity once more, so allowing us to "interpret" its meaning and find shelter from its inhuman workings. "Language posits and language means (since it articulates) but language cannot posit meaning,"40 de Man writes: only we humans can. It is we who yoke words with world, and indeed must do so. This is a parodic version of the hermeneutic circle: we cannot sponge away the horizon of words and their meaning. As de Man puts it in a 1979 essay, "Shelley Disfigured"41 (again, his words infused with a certain "pathos of apathy"): to read is to understand, to question, to know, to forget, to erase, to deface, to repeat-that is to say, the endless prosopopoeia by which the dead are made to have a face and a voice which tells the allegory of their demise and allows us to apostrophize then in our turn. No degree of knowledge can ever stop this madness, for it is the madness of words. De Man explores this back-and-forth of constructing/naturalizing of the figural in Kant's example of the sublime "Augenschein" ("eye- show") which reflects a non-sheltering sky, or in Hegel's citation of the Psalm's divine garment of light. He wants to show the workings of sublime language as originary trope rather than as the system of metaphoric representation that results. To simplify, he brings to light an epistemological "aporia" created by the disparity between originary trope and resultant figuration, between power and representation. And in this he might be thought to betray the properly American or Emersonian sublime, as personified in Harold Bloom's antithetical poetics of will, of protestant transgression and defiance.42 It is-to this way of thinking-European knowingness set against American inno- cence (however willed that may turn out to be). Yet that is not the end of de Man's story, or indeed of the madness of his words. In deconstruction the critical act of reading has (iv) to own up to its own complicity in producing the meanings it discovers: implication de texte, so to say. At the same time, confession will turn around into yet more representation-the madness of authority de Man discerns in Rousseau's excuses. Here one might attend to de 922</page><page sequence="15">M L N Man's preferred metaphors of "economimesis" or "turning" which figure (and necessarily disfigure) his own readings43; to his modes of address (puns, jokes, pathos, apostrophe, philological punctilio and "rigor," etc.); to his own impossible "narrativization" of the process of reading, the way he stages readings for us listeners44; or to his own thetic overplays (his attributing of a positing act to Kant's language is itself prosopopoeia, his accusation of slavish ressentiment in Hegel's reducing figure to thought is itself ressentiment, etc.). It is as if he cannot escape the aesthetic ideology he proscribes, but in foreg- rounding it stays (or hopes to stay) one step ahead of the law. Theorizing the sublime produces in turn a "sublime theory."45 Is this the end of the line, as it were?the end of representation, or rather, of figuration, of aesthetics? It makes a depressing spectacle- a sublime prospect perhaps-of theory at the end of its own tether, reduced to reproducing death masks for an academic living.... This is deconstruction without end, without even Derrida's quasi-utopian gesture of "what is to come." 4. However, in a surprising turn of events, academic critics and theo- rists-some of them students of the Yale school-have looked for signs of life after the death of mimetic prosopopoeia. One preemptive resort is to what Suzanne Guerlac has called the "impersonal" (or French) sublime as enacted in Hugo, Baudelaire, and Lautreamont, and put forward as an alternative to the Anglo- American-German account of the move from Romanticism to mod- ernism.46 This impersonal sublime constitutes an aesthetic practice that resists mimetic recuperation, and indeed theoretical closure altogether. Equally it resists Weiskel's quasi-psychoanalytic resort to an aesthetic scenario, his partial identification with poetic imagina- tion, and what Guerlac calls a "metaphorical" resolution. In her book the subject is figured within the mimetic structure of metaphor, yet is at odds with that-"resists" such placement, as she says (p. 195). Guerlac has further pursued this alternative take on sublime poetics into twentieth-century theory in her Literary Polemics.47 From the perspective of this essay, the question Guerlac refuses (perhaps rightly!) remains pressing: who is behind the masks of metaphor? what subjectivity is subject to the contingent shifts of language? In short, it is unclear (to me) that the impersonal sublime resolves the dilemma de Man left behind, or more precisely, saw Kant as leaving us 923</page><page sequence="16">MARTIN DONOUGHO with: how to speak of subjectivity after the breakdown of economimesis and its power-games (the subreptive pretence that nature is artful and art is natural, etc.). How may we-how may I-conceive of "the self'? A more direct response to the challenge has come from those seeking to rescue Kant's aesthetic or fictional account of the sublime, rephrasing it as an ironic play with the mimetic (hence already part ironic) positionality of texts. In place of narcissistic anxiety (Weiskel) we have a quasi-liberal suspension of self-hood, and not just that, but also what might be described as second-order reflection on the political and ethical interest in the literary byplay. Transplanted onto American soil, this knowing sublime is at the same time far from the strenuous Emersonian self-empowerment urged on us by Bloom. The other salient feature of this counter-movement is its pragmatist temper, its wholesale rejection of (not just resistance to) literary theory, de Manian or other. I have in mind here Frances Ferguson's 1992 study of the sublime, and two books by Steven Knapp, one on sublime personification in literature, and another on the interest literature has for us (that is for modern individualist society).48 Indeed, while it is too early to speak of a movement, Ferguson's and Knapp's current location might encourage us to call this a Johns Hopkins sublime, in succession to the Yale sublime now in literary eclipse. Ferguson shows clear evidence of a personal retreat from decon- struction to a qualified endorsement of the Kantian sublime.49 Her second chapter compares Edmund Burke's empiricist separation of words and things with deconstructive scepticism: both are said to thematize representation as supplemental, never quite catching up with its object. The third chapter ushers in Kant's formalist position, however, and in particular the "mathematical" sublime, understood as a regulative construct intended to keep in play our dual roles as both individual and type, a one yet an all. The entire discussion acquires a political color, directly by being injected into the problematics of liberalism and representational democracy, and indirectly in its implications for agency. A prevailing anxiety as to how the individual can also be typical is said to constitute "the characteristi- cally aesthetic epistemological problem" (31) in the late eighteenth- century, with consequences for both literary practice (the Gothic novel) and contemporary politics. That is to go against the current New Historicist bent to put aesthetics in social context, thereby subverting its claims to legitimacy: Ferguson and Knapp by contrast claim to be able to demonstrate how aesthetic role-playing might, to 924</page><page sequence="17">M L N the contrary, bear upon application of social and political norms.50 Ferguson also argues against what she takes as deconstruction's identification of the sublime with "loss of agency" (though the implications are not spelled out): "continually shifting of one's perspective and unit of measure" renders action indeterminate (21), as if we can never quite do what we mean, and are thus stymied in our ability to act. I take Ferguson's main argument to run as follows. First, she attacks the empiricist/deconstructionist reduction of objects to representa- tions, and the consequent generation of the sublime as an infinite regress: the representation of sensation leaves representation as an excess, a perpetual leftover-there is no end to the madness of words and images, etc. She objects that one can indeed think the relation between finite and infinite in the mathematical sublime, even though there is no resemblance or analogy between these terms. Second, where Burke's so-called "empirical" version of the sublime would have the individual terror-stricken at the prospect of being swallowed by the social universal, Kant's transcendental-or formalist-sublime refashions the tension between finite and infinite, sensuous and intelligible, as an insight into the very structure of the self. Kant is interpreted as recommending a "natural theatrics" which is neverthe- less notional rather than actually mimetic. It remains free of the empirical (or "dependent") weight of human characteristics or the "idea of beauty" on the one hand, of the consensual presumptions of taste on the other. "Kant has shifted the notion of representation from one that centers on likeness (in terms of continuing in a series) to one that insists upon the convergence of that onward movement with its opposite (the series as a unity)" (87). Ferguson speaks of empirical and formal versions of the self as "impersonating" each other in an impossible identity (certainly not one established by mimetic likeness).51 Nor, she suggests, would that "identity" be a merely human, merely arbitrary, projection upon a nature void of habitation and meaning-de Man's final verdict on our use of language (159). In the de Manian account, "linguistic matter is given a face by its utterer, only to be given additional faces by its reception" (163); but far from providing a hermeneutic retreat or passage, such impersonation only accentuates the inhumanity of the process of interpretation. Ferguson welcomes Kant's and de Man's abjuring of anthropomorphism and social content, yet she asks what the "utter contingency" or "materiality" of language in de Man's rhetorical reading might amount to (Knapp will repeat this challenge). It could 925</page><page sequence="18">MARTIN DONOUGHO appear at all (she holds) only by inference from the clash of linguistic registers-presumably the reader's construal and reconstruction. We have already seen how the master deconstructor has to admit that he cannot escape his own toils, is forever guilty of finding or inscribing excuses in his own texts ("words, words, words," to cite Hamlet). But what de Man takes to be the process of ideological implication/ critique is turned around by Ferguson into the objection that the reader's rhetorical practice refutes his theoretical stance. De Man, we have noted, attributes agency to language in its materiality. But-Ferguson counters-that is tantamount to saying that he himself gives a reading of how all reading is "always already" programmed-including this one. We can however recognize such rhetorical circles ("madness") without convicting deconstruction of a pragmatic self-contradiction: it could just be a fact of life, of language. Nor need we follow in Ferguson's own steps. For it remains unclear how she proposes to escape the game of impersonation, the bearing and wearing of masks. How does formalism-as self-aware literary fiction-provide a solution to the problems of agency (and complic- ity), as they appear staged within and indeed as the literary utterance? Ferguson speaks of the "pattern of experience" in Kant's mathematical sublime. She seems to rely on the force of her paradox that the formal pattern belongs to experience yet is not itself felt in experi- ence, can only be thought: the gap between these registers of concrete experience and abstract concept is precisely what the sublime com- prises, one might suppose. Is she suggesting that for the nonce we assume the reality of a regulative fiction, efface the gap between representation and the world or nature? Or is it that we must assume, for all "practical" purposes, that the self is more than a mere subject- position, while at the same time admitting (meta-pragmatically, as it were) that this is a language game adopted just to get by? (I am here trying to formulate what her pragmatist "non-position" might commit her to!) A theatrics of impersonation without mimesis, a slightly- more-than-regulative fiction of fictionality: is that enough to generate or justify norms? Or exactly what are the implications for social action? And secondly-a question to return to-is such a theatrics of the sublime a phenomenon of the past, circa 1800, or a thinking globally/acting locally recommended to Ferguson's present readers? The main proponent of this ironic strategy however, and the one on whom Ferguson draws, I think, is Steven Knapp. Speaking to the question why eighteenth-century readers felt certain sorts of personi- fication to be sublime despite its unreality, he refers us in the first place 926</page><page sequence="19">M L N to Burke's notion of "ambition" qua social passion. Ambition is conducive to beauty rather than to a sublime interested more in self- preservation; nevertheless ambition of this sort raises the individual beyond the over-identification with society found in direct "imita- tion." Such a dynamic already escapes a deconstructive reduction of action to gesture, hence to arbitrary imposition, he would claim. But Knapp's main response comes via Kant's distinction of empirical from intelligible self. He notes that over-identifying with one or other of these would cancel the "negativity" essential to the experience of the sublime (in the later book he comments extensively on the "negative capability" of Keats's "poetical Character"52). To identify wholly with one's rational self is to be guilty of Schwdrmerei (fanaticism, enthusi- asm). The Kantian sublime by contrast offers the spectacle of a self oscillating, in a highly reflective manner, between sympathetic identification and ironic distantiation. Knapp suggests that "[t] he self whose stability is served by the sublime is a self produced in the moment of the sublime."53 It seems that he is claiming neither that such a self definitively exists nor that it is illusory-it is perhaps a rhetorical effect we can live with .... Knapp's overall point emerges in the book's conclusion, where he hints at a parallel between the fictional play of identification and the philosophical-political problem of agency (a relation merely tacit in Ferguson). Literature-especially the sort that invokes the sublime- might, he suggests, serve as a testing ground for normative validity: it sets in play private and public selves, in a framework divorced from actual social commitments. In short, while reflecting social norms and roles, literature also goes the other way so as to proffer usable allegories of a model self (that is, the self as it has been conceived in the modern, individualist or liberal era).54 That approach is both amplified and somewhat amended in Knapp's 1993 study of "literary interest." Its subtitle is "the limits of anti-formalism," i.e. the limits to deconstructive and New Historicist attacks on the autonomy of literature/aesthetics. Knapp's point here is subtle: hostile to ideological critique of literature, he yet does not want simply to fall back on a Kantian or formalist autonomy. Rather, he attends to the advantages to be had in imagining certain "para- digm scenarios," a term borrowed from Ronald de Sousa.55 They should not be thought to float before us as so many neutral alternatives, Knapp argues, but might help the individual envisage and so choose appropriate conduct or normative frames. From a practical standpoint-which is ultimately what Knapp urges-merely 927</page><page sequence="20">MARTIN DONOUGHO entertaining complex possibilities does not suffice: deferring all sce- narios not only leaves normative judgment in abeyance, it also amounts to a performative self-contradiction, a deliberate act of self- effacement.56 That is Knapp's complaint, not just against de Sousa and de Man, but more broadly also against a liberal politics of what he dubs "descriptive representation" (96). The liberal dilemma, for Knapp (drawing on Hannah Pitkin), is that a democratic process of representation does not of itself issue in a critical judgment or decision. Any particular critical or moral judgment is neutralized in advance, since preferring one scenario or set of representations over another becomes a purely arbitrary matter. Equally, to label any scenario an ideological aberration (de Man) or self-deception (de Sousa) verges on empty gesture, since there is no guarantee of escape from the arbitrariness inherent in words and representations. Knapp's pragmatist temper is clearly shown here, as it is in his refusal to allow a theoretical distance from any given linguistic or ethical situation. Knapp, we should recall, was co-author of a notori- ous essay, "Against Theory," proposing an intentionalist construal of meaning on the grounds that an interpreter cannot step outside his or her individual perspective so as to offer a theoretical overview.57 De Man (with John Searle and a host of others) comes under fire for supposing that linguistic meaning can be independent of and prior to whatever meaning a particular user intends. Knapp will not countenance such a distinction in practice (and not, as Searle alleges, because he simply collapses sentential and intentional meaning, language as such and individual speech acts). To speak of non- intentional meaning is still, he argues, to intend and interpret. The question-as before, with Ferguson's pragmatist objections-is whether de Man's model of ideological swerve is self-defeating, because itself an inevitably flawed interpretation, or whether ideological critique must strategically or practically suppose a material structure "always already" at work. If de Man tends to reduce agency to gesture, however, Knapp's own approach is hardly straightforward. "It isn't that literary interest makes someone a better agent. But it does give an unusually pure experience of what liberal agency, for better or worse, is like," he writes.58 Note the ambivalence of tone here, with regard both to "better" agency and "better" model of agency; the author keeps normative evaluation at arm's length. Literary interest is indirect, it seems: the interest of a relative disinterestedness, something like a second-order reflexion on the historical conditions of possibility for such 928</page><page sequence="21">M L N fictionality. "From one point of view," Knapp concludes, "the mutual implication of particularity and typicality that characterizes the struc- ture of literary interest merely reproduces the oscillation that also characterizes the self-reflection of human agency" (139). The point of view is presumably the theory and practice of liberal individualism, historicized circa 1800, though in some measure still with us today. How does all this bear upon the sublime or judgment on the sublime? First, I confess that any implications must be read into the text, since the topic of sublimity does not surface at all in so many words-although given that Knapp's range of concerns remains much the same, little damage is done. The sublime moment for agency consists, presumably, in the dual fact that the individual is finite and yet must acknowledge its potential to be infinite. Literary interest lies in a suspension of belief, an entertaining of scenarios (which still leaves judgment or decision in limbo). Not merely that: Knapp maintains also that literature "particularizes" these typical roles, suggesting that they can be realized in practice, that I (as disinterested reader) might in fact be identified with them. But here Knapp introduces a further complication in the picture, by importing a version of the debate between liberalism and communitarianism. Simply to imagine various future possibilities for one's self and its agency is in effect to sever the self from its history, as Knapp emphasizes in a chapter on acknowledging a collective past.59 As a particular agent-the liberal model of an unencumbered self-I imagine possible acts, project a persona into the future, exemplify a certain type of character in a typical situation (138). Yet as a particular agent I am also bound to a collective past (or pasts). I feel that I can't disclaim responsibility; I recognize myself to be substantially one with it. Knapp refuses to allow a return to a pre-liberal notion of self (as some communitarians advocate). Nor does he say whether recogni- tion of one's circumstances might override the peculiar suspension of identity found in literary interest and liberal politics, or what role literature might play in the politics of such recognition. Where does that leave us, then, at the end of the day (as Knapp likes to put it)? It seems that the oscillation between particular and typical never ends; inserting oneself in just one (and a just) scenario is continually frustrated, even while literary fictions suggest it can be done. What then is the interest in such literary suspension of interest, of warranted belief? And further, is it a rational interest? One might be tempted to interpret the result as something like a hermeneutic account, whether Makreel's reading of Kant or (perhaps more apt 929</page><page sequence="22">MARTIN DONOUGHO here) Ricoeur's appeal to metaphor and mimesis to forge a link between literature and agency-an analogy which catches both the tension as well as unity in narrative and act. But again that fails to catch Knapp's drift, which seems more radically pragmatist in temper (for all the stress hermeneutics puts on "application" in judgment), and resistant both to mimetic identification and formal analogy (even if a distinctively sublime region of experience could be described for mimesis and analogy to work). All Knapp will venture is the "specula- tive" suggestion-perhaps as a regulative idea if not theoretical representation-that "for all practical purposes" we must think of our action as such an oscillation between particular and typical (140), and further (I presume), between liberal and collective selfhood. That complements the "promise of full agency" found in literary fictions- a promise we can perhaps try to make good on in our real lifeworld. Paradoxically, the formalism Knapp advocates is hardly universalist, that is, removed from all social context or disposition. Conversely, his pragmatism is one that appeals to-better, allows for appeal to- rational standards of adjudication. Knapp's sublime is not Lyotard's sheer event, beyond all reason, let alone, in the promise of its practical implicature, the spectral appearance of Derrida's "a venir," as it were utopian at one remove. One might rather be put in mind of Habermas and his pragmatics of communication, minus some of its universalist colour: judgment is to be reserved in every case, applied in a particular context while yet invoking an intersubjective recognition and assessment transcending that context. Indeed, Habermas rates mention in a co-written paper on how the claim to act rationally (a) involves self-conceptions (cf. "scenarios") (b) which implicitly appeal to a Peircean community of recognition.60 But again, the Habermasian cap doesn't quite fit; the sublime is not so easily domesticated to his model of communicative rationality, mainly because that retains a commitment to some ideal "background" or conditions of possibility which the theorist can always reconstruct. Knapp's procedure seeks to tread a line between rationalist and contextualist accounts of agency. Various riders the author coyly attaches "at the end of the day" to his claims-"from one point of view," "for all practical purposes"- along with the rueful acknowledgement "for better or worse" of a "liberal" model of politics, lead one to ask just how seriously Knapp takes his own model of literary interest. How disinterested does he take himself to be when writing about such cultural phenomena? In other words: how does he stand, to behold the sublime, this new yet unapproachable-indeed liberal-sublime? Does he merely behold 930</page><page sequence="23">M L N this practice occurring at the margin of the modern, liberal age, a time when the slippage of self and agency could achieve a sublime effect? Or is there something sublime in the margin we moderns inhabit between liberal and collective agency? In sum, Weiskel's fret-how seriously did Kant take the sublime? wasn't it just so much shadow play?-remains to haunt us. Two puzzles especially linger. First, as I have already indicated, it is unclear how far Knapp's is a general account of a particular historical context, at once literary and socio-political, in England circa 1800. (Here again one thinks of Habermas, speaking of a "civil publicity"- die biirgerliche Offentlichkeit-that is both an historical instance and a general principle.) Does the problematic of the sublime remain ours, even supposing we can project ourselves back into its defining moment circa 1800, and whoever "we" are taken to be? Is it a universal structure of experience, or does our modern reflection on the past differ from that of an eighteenth or nineteenth century readers (thus complicating our practical-cum-theoretical interest in their fictional disinterestedness)? Lastly, is there any sense in which it remains a specifically American sublime, in the guise of its individual- ism or liberalism, say? A second but related puzzle concerns Knapp's allusions to "liberal- ism" and especially his citing here-of all authorities!-the name of Roberto Unger.61 Part of the trouble may lie in the ambiguities besetting the liberal model of democratic legitimation itself (e.g. is autonomous society given or constructed? and do individuals freely constitute of their government, or does what Foucault terms "gov- ernmentality" somehow oblige them to be free?). It is due also to uncertainty as to whether Knapp shares Unger's broad understanding of "liberalism." For Unger the term denotes in the first place a large- scale individualizing and instrumentalizing tendency in modern thought and politics; a tendency that in his view fails in its normative task of establishing a linkage between particular subject and universal grounds for acting (and here we can see parallels with Knapp's complaints about "descriptive representation"). Unger proceeds to sketch a metaphysical theory of the self, invoked to ground an alternative to liberal subjectivity, but written in a manner averse to "the heavy-handed though frivolous sobriety "of philosophic argu- ment62 (which makes it difficult to assess in an academic journal). Unger's critique-cum-revision of this problematic strand of modernity receives more comprehensive (and methodologically more diligent) treatment in a later work under the title Passion.63 Here "liberalism" is 931</page><page sequence="24">MARTIN DONOUGHO remapped as a last stage in the "Christian-romantic" tradition, the problems with which emerge in the subsequent phase, that is, with "modernism." Does Knapp agree with this framing (and critique) of the liberal worldview? Or is he thinking of a more narrowly political liberalism, one that leaves individuals free to debate and choose their self-conceptions, metaphysics, and value-schemes? Given his empha- sis on selfhood and its representation or impersonation, I think he has to opt for the former, substantive vision. Yet that is hard to square with his procedural, anti-metaphysical gestures, the sense that all is for the nonce. In sum, it is difficult finally to tell just where Knapp stands vis-a-vis "liberalism," and hence the sublime that devolves upon instances of liberal agency. True, his delimiting of liberalism and the historical ambiguity of the sublime may well for Knapp go hand in hand: distance from an exemplary moment in the literary past allows its descriptive exposition without committing the author to theoretical investment on the one hand or partisanship on the other. Yet the result is that our interest in the literary interest of the sublime becomes somewhat ghostly and academic, the mere shadow of a shade. To conclude: This latest episode is, if nothing else, a remarkable turn in the reflexive problematics of the Kantian sublime. I think that in the context of my petit recit about the American sublime it acquires an additional significance. For where the Yale sublime firstjourneyed inward, then jumped wholly outside so as to question the self- reflexive theorizing of a Romantic practice, the Johns Hopkins sublime performs a complicated two-step: it both takes note of deconstructive devastation and yet keeps its historicizing distance from a literary/political interest in sublime fictionality. This new "new historicism"-a new yet unapproachable historicism, perhaps-might well imply normative critique of liberal mimetics, and hence bear upon contemporary practice, whether literary, aesthetic, or political. But the outcome is unclear, at least to me. Where then does one stand to behold the sublime, as it appears in this story? All I can suggest is that the tale remains unfinished-a thought which some will find provocative and others consoling, but which is in any event not without interest.

(Further citation as CJ is to these editions, translation amended.) The OED finds the primary meaning of "subreption" in Ecclesiastical Law: "The suppression of the truth or concealment of the facts with a view to obtaining a faculty [sc. licence], dispensation, etc." Pluhar notes that Kant had referred to the "fallacy of subreption" in his Inaugural Dissertation (1770), "by analogy with the accepted meaning," as Kant puts it. 5 "I almost doubt which is most sublime, Homer's Battle of the Gods or Longinus' apostrophe to Terentianus upon it."

In one passage (p. 34) Weiskel also dubs it the "hermeneutic" (or reader's) sublime, because it typically attaches a meaning to what is experienced as indeterminate or unattainable. 8 Weiskel, The Romantic Sublime, p. 27, quoting the 1843 note to "Ode. Intimations of Immortality" that Wordsworth dictated to Isabella Fenwick: "Many times while going to school have I grasped at a wall or tree to recall myself from this abyss of idealism to the reality"-precisely the dreamy vividness he later struggled to recall. He also invokes what Hartman calls Wordsworth's "spot syndrome"-the experience of being swept into infinity, out of language's depth, so to speak. For a very different angle, see Rob Wilson, American Sublime. The genealogy of a practice (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1991). He begins by taking the "American Sublime" as a poetic genre that implicates the lyric ego in producing America as site of the sublime: Bloom on Emersonian self-reliance, for example, 933</page><page sequence="26">MARTIN DONOUGHO focussing on its "refusal of history." Wilson's emphasis here is more on the history of North American poetry, whereas mine is on recent American critical practice. In a more recent piece-"Techno-euphoria and the discipline of the American Sublime" in boundary 2 19/1 (1992), 205-30-Wilson takes up Leo Marx's notion of the "technological sublime" (displacing the pastoral vision) as a myth still functioning in the American war machine. Apart from the enormous reach of this view, I wonder whether it doesn't replicate something of the myth of American uniqueness it means to purge. 9 For an incisive guide to recent tendencies, see Paul Hamilton, "The romanticism of contemporary ideology," in Intersections: nineteenth-century philosophy and contem- porary theory, eds. Rajan &amp; Clark (Albany: SUNY Press, 1995), pp. 302-21. As Hamilton puts it (p. 306): "Analysis of the ideology of romanticism . . suggests the romanticism of ideology." I take Weiskel to be ambivalent on this matter, whereas Laura Quinney takes him at his word, namely, as wishing to deconstruct the moment of sublime transcendence, reduce it to signs and psychology. See "Weiskel's sublime and the impasse of knowledge," Philosophy and Literature 18/2 (1994) 309-19. 10 See Virgil Nemoianou, The Taming of Romanticism. European literature and the age of Biedermeier (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1984); Jerome McGann, The Romantic Ideology (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1983). 11 John Zammito, The Genesis of Kant's "Critique ofJudgment" (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992). This excellent study tells how Kant began from an aversion to Sturm und Drang enthusiasm, but later shifted towards a proto-Romantic embrace of genius as source of moral authority. 12 See on this problem Peter Fenves penetrating review-essay, "Taking stock of the Kantian sublime," in Eighteenth-Century Studies 28/1 (1994), 65-82, e.g. 66-67. Fenves is more critical of "Zimmato" (sic) than I would be-there is an ethical charge to the unity of reason-yet it remains true that Zammito fails to clarify exactly how (apart from moral "respect") feeling relates to reason and cognition. 13 Weiskel notes this feature in Kant (see e.g. p. 85) and adds that Idealist aesthetics tends to ignore the sublime in favour of the beautiful. See also Lyotard, Of the Sublime, passim, and especially pp. 226ff. 14 On this "weakening" of the subject, see Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe andJean-Luc Nancy, The Literary Absolute: the theory of literature in German Romanticism (Albany: SUNY Press, 1988), p. 31-or cf. p. xv, where the Kantian subject is supposed frozen in antinomies, like Frankenstein in the polar ice. Kant's Opus Postumum does speak of a "self-positing" (Selbstsetzung), in space and time on the one hand, as a person on the other-something like an insertion of myself in the natural and moral orders. Little is made of this suggestion however. See Opus Postumum, ed. Eckart F6rster (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), p. 170ff., and "Introduction," pp. xlii-xliii. 15 The Romantic Sublime, p. 41-his emphasis (further references in text). It occurs in a section entitled "Kant's fictional moment." It is unclearjust what Weiskel might mean by "fiction," however, since this term itself became identified with various imaginative genres at the end of the eighteenth century-a shift for which Kantian "disinterestedness" is emblematic. That is perhaps part of Weiskel's ambivalence. 16 For the poet, this is also identification with a previous model, from whose influence s/he may try to turn. 17 Weiskel's mystic turn of mind in Chapter 7 contends with his expressly demystifying temper. In noting the subjunctive mode of Wordsworth's "Let there be .. ." and in 934</page><page sequence="27">M L N interpreting the poetry as presenting a dialectic between symbol-which one sees-and sign-which one reads-he anticipates some of de Man's later moves. Laura Quinney (see note 7 above, at 318) acknowledges the disparity between such belief and what she takes to be the dominant scepticism for which she upbraids Weiskel. I read his rhetoric as divided through and through. 18 See Suzanne Guerlac, The Impersonal Sublime: Hugo, Baudelaire, Lautreamont (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1990) p. 191. In a companion essay, "On the Hegelian sublime" (forthcoming in Philosophy and Rhetoric) I argue that an "Idealist" reading such as Hegel's does not necessarily "aestheticize" the sublime. Briefly, in the first place, Hegel's "Ideal" self-consciously fuses Schiller's two poles of beauty and (ethical) sublime. Second, he does not recommend this as an ideal actually to be striven for: it is located in the ancient past, as a phenomenon that still carries ethical weight but from which the sublime moment has separated once more (post-Hellenic art is sublime from the start). Third, Hegel's sublime is wholly desublimated, filed away as it is between the symbol proper (in Egypt) and the "symbolics" of rhetoric and figures of speech (its proximity to the latter is clearest in the 1826 lecture series). 19 For a recent hermeneutic interpretation see Rudolf Makkreel, Imagination and Interpretation in Kant: the hermeneutical import of the "Critique ofJudgment" (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1990). 20 With Hegel, the auto-limitation of the sublime is accommodated dialectically within the form and ethical-political content of the classical Ideal, and is so both developmentally-the sublime both precedes and as "romantic" (sc. post-Hel- lenic) art succeeds art "proper"-and structurally-in art of the Ideal, the ethical seems in harmony with the aesthetic. 21 Werke I (Berlin: Cassirer, 1922), Vorkritischen Schriften 218-370: here, at 369. On Kant's perspectivism, see for example Hans Blumenberg, The Genesis of the Copernican World (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1987) I/4 "The nonsimultaneity of the simultaneous." The best treatment of Kant's text is Peter D. Fenves, A Peculiar Fate. Metaphysics and World-History in Kant (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1991), ch. 1: "Sterndeutung." 22 Even though none of his public could know it-the publisher went bankrupt before it could be distributed! 23 De Man comments on the peculiarities of "Augenschein" in "Phenomenality and materiality in Kant," a 1983 talk, published in 1984, and now included in Aesthetic Ideology (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1996) pp. 70-90, at p. 82. He terms it a "material" vision, and-unlike the main thrust of Kant's "Romantic" sublime-a "material" sublime. Oddly, he does not explain why nature-as-building should escape a teleological model just because it is not organic in mode. (I shall comment more on de Man below.) 24 "[B]old, overhanging, and, as it were, threatening rocks . . .": CJ?28: 261/120. The importance of the "as it were" is brought home by Francis Ferguson, Solitude and the Sublime: Romanticism and the aesthetics of individuation (New York: Routledge, 1992), p. 73; her sophisticated return to aesthetic distance I discuss below. Lyotard raises a related problem with the "non-economy" of our interest in the sublime, and with the "Geistesgefiihl" which is no concrete affect. See his "The interest of the sublime," in Of the Sublime pp. 109-32, e.g. p. 131. 25 Neil Hertz, "The notion of blockage in the literature of the sublime" (1978), chapter 3 of his The End of the Line: essays on psychoanalysis and the sublime (New York: Columbia UP, 1985), esp. pp. 49ff. Weiskel rejects the "primary" illusion, yet feels compelled finally to entertain a "secondary" belief in the imaginary process. 935</page><page sequence="28">MARTIN DONOUGHO Hertz brings out the "Oedipal" nature of the latter, and the scholar's need not only for the moment of blockage but also for "identification with the blocking agent that is the guarantor of the self's own integrity as an agent" (p. 53). (Hertz's coolness of tone is yet another level of coping with this need!) 26 See Neil Hertz's pioneering article, "A reading of Longinus" (1973), in The End of the Line, pp. 1-22, e.g. p. 8; and Suzanne Guerlac, "Longinus and the subject of the sublime" in New Literary History 16/2 (1985) 275-89. Hertz concludes his reading by noting how for Longinus figures retain their power only if one keeps quiet about their operations (though Longinus could not for that reason say that one could not say it, but remained ironic). 27 This is so even when he knows that the very act of rejection is self-willed, indeed a willing of self! Reading Bloom is like observing the battle in progress-and being invited to join. See Ruin the Sacred Truths: Poetry and belieffrom the Bible to the present (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1989), p. 120: "Throughout The Romantic Sublime, Weiskel works toward a difficult kind of literary criticism, at once moral or primary and de-idealizing or antithetical. This may not be possible to attain; certainly I, for one, have failed to achieve it." (Note the gesture of recuperation even in failure.) Cf. chapter 9 of Bloom's Agon. Towards a theory of revisionism (New York: Oxford University Press, 1982), "The Sublime crossing and the death of love," arguing that the strong ("original") poem plays both sides, that is, peers into the abyss and turns back to worship of self. Bloom's antithetical, interpretative criticism would like to imitate such audacity. (To follow Bloom's long battle against de Manian deconstruction-American sublime "over-throw- ing" European desublimation, troping system-would take us too far afield; he would cut off my narrative at the pass, so to speak, and end it here. Bloom remains exemplary of the Romantic sublime.) 28 The Discourse of the Sublime: history, aesthetics and the subject (London: Blackwell, 1989), pp. 9-12. See also the Introduction to Ashfield &amp; de Bolla (eds.), The Sublime: a reader in British eighteenth-century aesthetic theory (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), pp. 3-5. 29 Samuel Holt Monk, The Sublime: a study of critical theories in eighteenth-century England (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1960). 30 The Discourse of the Sublime, p. 295. 31 See Roberts, "Epilogue. Sublime theories: reason and imagination in modernity," in Rethinking Imagination. Culture and creativity eds. Robinson &amp; Rundell (London: Routledge, 1994), pp. 171-84, esp. p. 178: "By this I mean a self-limiting theory which is aware that it cannot encompass and exhaust the transcendence of the world and knows the limits of conceptualization and systematization." 32 E.g. Hunter, "Aesthetics and cultural studies" in Cultural Studies (New York: Routledge, 1993) 347-72; Lloyd, "Kant's examples" in Representations 28 (Fall 1989) 34-54; Bourdieu, Distinction: a social critique of the judgement of taste (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1984). These vary in the theoretical aegis adopted, and I make no claims as to which are more successful: what they share is an externalist viewpoint on aesthetic experience. 33 See Jacques Derrida, The Truth in Painting (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1987), p. 127: "there cannot, it seems, be a parergon for the sublime." Whether this is sleight of hand on Derrida's part is a moot point. Mark Cheetham argues that in Derrida's reading Kant frames the sublime as being without a frame, thus drawing a distinction that is at the same time disciplinary: it helps in the philosophical definition of art. See his "Moments of discipline: Derrida, Kant, and the genealogy of the sublime" in Intersections, pp. 349-62. Cheetham's (Derrida's?) argument verges on being "supplemental" at one remove, however. If the sublime 936</page><page sequence="29">M LN is "equated" with the parergon (p. 360), we could in turn ask about the author's investment in this distinction in order to get deconstruction to work, to render a profit for his own reading. At the very least, a lot of work must be done to show the upshot for art-nothing to do with Kant's sublime-and for various philosophical practices called "aesthetics." In this respect Lyotard is less sententious: though sometimes critical, he is also appreciative of Kant's sublime for its facing up to the limits of meaning. See his Lessons on the Analytic of the Sublime (1991; Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1994). 34 Resistance to Theory (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1986), p. 11. A parallel critique of "the literary absolute" is to be found in Lacoue-Labarthe and Nancy, The Literary Absolute. Stanley Cavell hints at an overlap between the latter and his own double-edged retrieval of American Romanticism, in This New Yet Unapproachable America: lectures afterEmerson after Wittgenstein (Albuquerque: Living Batch Press, 1989), p. 8. 35 "The repudiation of closure, comprehension, and totalization escalates from one critic to the next.. .," as Ferguson puts it (Solitude and the Sublime, p. 16). She adds that literary criticism becomes a "vexed enterprise," and goes on to attack this deconstructive tendency. 36 Marc Redfield, "De Man, Schiller, and the politics of reception," in Diacritics 20/ 3 (1990), 50-70, at 65. Perhaps "apathia" is more exact, for it is not quietism so much as social and linguistic determinism that is at stake here. On the paradox of de Man's wringing of emotion from a rigorous determinism, see John Guillory, Cultural Capital: the problem of literary canon formation (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993), Chapter 4, p. 233ff. 37 See Resistance to Theory, p. 87. Writing to dispel anthropic illusions in response to the Lisbon earthquake, Kant had held that "Humans are not born to build eternal huts on this stage of vanity (auf dieser Schaubiihne der Eitelkeit)": Werke I Geschichte und Naturbeschreibung des Erdbebens i.J. 1755, at 472. We might compare this with a remark of de Man's made in 1955: "Man in the center of space, man whom nothing protects from the sky and earth, is no doubt closer to the essential than the European, who searches for shelter among beautiful houses polished by history and among fields marked by ancestral labor"-Critical Writings, 1953-1978 (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1989), p. 31. This passage-which incidentally shows de Man's awkward distance from Heidegger-is cited by Lindsay Walters as showing a "non-human" view of language: "Professah de Man-he dead," American Literary History 7/2 (1995) 285-303. 38 De Man appropriates this talk of "positing" from Fichte, or rather from Friedrich Schlegel and Walter Benjamin. See the 1977 talk entitled "The concept of irony," now in Aesthetic Ideology, pp. 163-84. He follows Benjamin in taking Romantic (as opposed to Fichtean) reflection to be radically non-egotistical. More debatable I think is his interpretation of Fichtean Setzen as a purely linguistic act and of the ego as subject-position (p. 172: "Language posits radically and absolutely the self, the subject, as such"). That anyway is the source of his later emphasis on the agency of language and our helpless subjection to its power. To put it another way, de Man thinks that there occurs a tropic swerve from literal (linguistic) meaning, and the result is a system of tropes, figuration, or substitutions. The original troping, as a version of the Fall, is catachresis, a necessary violation (though of course there are no prior rules or laws to violate-law itself is violent). By contrast, for Harold Bloom (Agon, p. 19) this conceit-that language can mean and act prior to users' intentions-is itself a "considerable trope": he supposes that our strenuous troping comes first and determines linguistic meaning, just as history determines system. 937</page><page sequence="30">MARTIN DONOUGHO A further consequence of de Man's following Benjamin on language's violent positing is the disappearance of an intersubjective mean. The speech act makes no assumptions about its effect or interpretation. 39 See Marc Redfield, Phantom Formations: aesthetic ideology and the Bildungsroman (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1996), p. 33: "no personification could be more rhetorical than that which grants agency to "language." Yet a critique of aesthetics cannot avoid this gesture, which is scripted within aesthetics as the trace of its radical incoherence." 40 The Rhetoric of Romanticism (New York: Columbia University Press, 1984), pp. 117- 18. 41 In The Rhetoric of Romanticism, p. 122. The Preface to this collection suggests that the essay is almost a profession of faith (or lack thereof), and "come[s] close to facing" the issue of how the critic may insert himself into a discourse on literature (p. ix). In his remarks on irony, de Man had already noted Schlegel's comments on the madness of poetic language, its endless circulation of words: see Aesthetic Ideology, p. 181. 42 Agon p. 32: "the Emersonian difference, which is to say, the American difference: a diachronic rhetoric, set not only against past tropes, as in Nietzsche, but against the pastness of trope itself...." Bloom accuses de Man of applying a synchronic system of tropes: philosophy rather than poetics. On Bloomian poetics, see Peter de Bolla, Harold Bloom: towards a historical rhetorics (London: Routledge, 1988), chapter 5: "Diachronic rhetoric." 43 "Economimesis" is Derrida's term for the way Kant deploys analogy to link art to nature-as if nature were art and the artwork natural-so as to restore the economy of mimesis even after having rejected a mimetic account of beauty and art. I have already pointed to de Man's trope of a pre-tropological "turning" of language towards a system of figurative meaning-figure as distortion and disfiguring. 44 Cynthia Chase observes (i) how de Man narrates the giving of figure or face to inhuman imposition, and (ii) his awareness that rhetorical reading always produces an allegory of its own reading procedure. See "Giving face to a name: de Man's figures," Chapter 4 of her Decomposing Figures. Rhetorical readings in the Romantic tradition (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1986), at p. 97. One could go further: rhetorical reading is rigorous, inevitable, and always the same, yet the reading must be humanized, made interesting and informative for the audience or readership.... 45 And one could add another dialectical twist, for rhetorical reading must in its turn be read, and perhaps then practised by others. The reception of de Man is notoriously polarized, exemplifying both the faith of devoted disciples and the moralistic finger-pointing of scandal mongers. In chapter 4 of his Cultural Capital ("Literature after theory: the lessons of Paul de Man."), John Guillory has intriguingly tried to cut through the ideological networks. The chief lesson Guillory attends to is the rigor of "Theory"-a technical rhetoric which mimics the bureaucratic rationality of a society threatening the autonomous functioning of literary criticism in the university.... He does not raise the further possibility whether rhetorical reading still has something to teach despite such obfuscation. 46 See The Impersonal Sublime, p. 195, for remarks on its implications. 47 Literary Polemics: Bataille, Sartre, Valery, Breton (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997); see also "The sublime in theory," MLN (1991) 895-909. Here a Romantic Setzen is replaced by a Bergsonian notion of "action" and "recognition." Every- thing depends on whether that can recast the debate. 938</page><page sequence="31">M L N 48 On Ferguson, see note 23, above. Knapp, Personification and the Sublime: Milton to Coleridge (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1985), esp. chapter 3, p. 66f; and Literary Interest: the limits of anti-formalism (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1993). Knapp's overall position bears comparison, it seems to me, with Randall Dipert's account of intentionality and aesthetic interest in his recent Artifacts, Art Works, and Agency (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1993). 49 That could be because the account of Burke chapter 2 offers was written earlier than the account of Kant in chapter 3; see Solitude and the Sublime p. 9f. Burke's supposed inability to discern objects from the experience of objects is taken as a proto-deconstructive account of language and representation. 50 See Knapp's neat-indeed, knapp-dismissal of New Historicist concerns in Literary Interest pp. 103-5: "An interest in the-Tudor-state-as-suggested-by-the- theater is no longer very clearly an interest in the state [as such] . . ."

Knapp in passing notes the proximity of the eighteenth-century's fascination with personified abstractions to Michael Fried's notion of the "absorption" of self-enclosed agency (though he does not follow up Fried's subsequent admission that absorption may itself become a "theatrical" gesture). 54 Personification and the Sublime, p. 141. 55 See The Rationality of Emotion (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1987), e.g. pp. 182 ff. De Sousa understands them not only as determining our repertoire of emotional "perception" of situations, but also as allowing occasional revision of frame, a certain rational consciousness raising, so as to avoid, for example, ideological or self-deceptive motivation. 56 That is Knapp's main complaint against de Man: throwing everything into the "linguistics of literariness"-fiction-will not uncover aberrant ideologies, because that too is a gesture or speech act that in turn needs a mea culpa. See Literary Interest, pp. 94-97. Similarly de Sousa is criticized for assuming that ideology can be unmasked by the realization that the situation is open to alternative scenarios. The complaint is not quite fair: de Sousa argues that redescription may lead to insight into the source of emotional delusion and so to a new perception of the situation. Yet it is valid to the extent that his model (a) fudges the line between a naturalistic embedding of emotion and emotion as a revisable means of setting the initial scene, and (b) assumes that "phony" revisions can be avoided as a kind of mauvaisefoi. Does Knapp's pragmatist approach escape this same dilemma? 57 With Walter Benn Michaels, "Against Theory," Critical Inquiry 8/4 (1982), and the ensuing controversy (still going strong). 58 Literary Interest, p. 103. 59 He cites Alasdair Macintyre to the effect that we may recognize various overlap- ping collectivities. I assume we are more committed to these than to the various scenarios for future agency. 60 See Philip Clayton and Steven Knapp, "Ethics and rationality," American Philosophi- cal Quarterly 30/2 (1993) 151-61, at 161. The dynamic is complex: a self- conception is both typical-hence disputable-and something that makes sense for me, in my particular context; the community appealed to is both ideal and historical (it is not the abstract realm of humanity, as for Kant). 939</page><page sequence="32">940 MARTIN DONOUGHO 61 By "liberalism" Knapp means "the broad range of ethical and political theories and values associated, since the late seventeenth century, with Anglo-American and European modes of representative government" (Literary Interest, p. 155). He refers us to Roberto Mangabeira Unger, Knowledge and Politics (New York: Free Press, 1975). Unger is well known as founder of "Critical Legal Studies," and thus hardly a proponent of liberalism, whether in law, in psychology, or in politics. Indeed, Stephen Holmes dubs it "antiliberalism unbound" in his The Anatomy of Antiliberalism (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1993), pp. 141-175. 62 Knowledge and Politics, p. 192.
