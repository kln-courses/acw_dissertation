<plain_text><page sequence="1">AUTHORITY AND THEODICY IN HOBBES'S LEVIATHAN : «WE ARE GOD'S SLAVES»1 by George Wright The purpose of this essay is briefly to analyze the concepts of authority and theodicy as Hobbes links and develops them in the English Leviathan. Its the- sis is that authority, divine and human, may be distinguished one from the oth- er by the identities and roles of the superior and subordinate parties. In the lat- ter case, the political sovereign stands in a relation to the subject as master to hired man. The divine sovereign stands in relation to the subject as master to slave. Hobbes works out the distinction between hired man and slave largely by reference to the Greek law and experience of slavery. Given their impor- tance, we will draw upon the reforms brought about in Athens by Solon (c. 640- c. 561 BC) to illuminate this distinction. Finally, we will elucidate the role of the divine sovereign as master by way of the distinction Hobbes con- sistently draws in many writings between God as first cause ( causa causarum or causa prima) and God as author. This distinction lies at the root of his theodicy, his justification of the «wayes of God to men»2. 1. 1 would like to thank participants at the colloquium, "Hobbes and la question de l'au- torité dans le Leviathan ", held by the Centre Thomas Hobbes, December 15-16, 2001, CNRS, Paris, for helpful comments, especially those of Luc Foisneau. A. P. Martinich's comments have also been of the greatest help. I quote throughout from MacPherson's fa- miliar edition of Leviathan and have consulted Prof. Edwin Curley's learned edition, pub- lished by the Hackett Publishing Company, Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1994. The citation form is as follows: Leviathan 2.17.2.223 means Leviathan, part 2, chapter 17, paragraph 2, page 223 in that edition.

I cite my English translation of the 1668 Ap- pendix ( Interpretation 18 (1991): 323-413), with some emendations, and the King James Version of the Bible. 2. He describes this concern at Leviathan 2.31.6.398: This question, why evil men often prosper, and good men suffer adversity, has been much disputed by the ancient, and is the same with this of ours, by what right God dispenseth the prosperities and adversities of this life; and is of that difficulty, as it hath shaken the faith, not only of the vulgar, but of philosophers, and which is more, of the Saints, concerning the Divine Providence.

We may determine the scope and range of the political sovereign's authority as devel- oped in Leviathan by reference to that of the divine sovereign, and we may de- termine the scope and range of the divine sovereign's authority by reference to the dependency of the slave. Precisely what constitutes one a slave on Hobbes's account will prove the key not only to investigating the conceptual content of political authority but also to describing the ground and possibility of theodicy. Let us begin with a brief comparison of slavery first among Jews and Christians and then among Greeks and Romans3. Slavery in Israel Unlike either ancient Greece and Rome or the American South, the econo- my of ancient Israel never became dependent upon slave labor. Benevolent re- quirements towards Hebrew slaves in Mosaic law prevented profitable large- scale dealing in slaves4. Thus, loss of an eye or tooth while in service entitled the slave to freedom ( Exodus 21:26-27; Leviticus 24:22). Extradition of fugi- tive slaves seeking shelter in an Israelite home was prohibited ( Deuteronomy 23: 15-16)5. The Israelite slave of an Israelite was circumcised and was thereby entitled to the paschal sacrifice (Exodus 12:44), all the Jewish festivals (Deuteronomy 12:12, 18; 16:11, 14) and the Sabbath rest (Exodus 20:10-11; Deuteronomy 5:14). Moreover, terms of service were limited; freedom was granted after seven years of service, in the year of jubilee, which occurred 3. The literature on ancient slavery is extensive; see, for example, Slavery irt Antiquity ed. by Moses Finley (New York: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1968); Moses Finley, Ancient Slavery and Modern Ideology (New York: Penguin Books, 1983); Classical Slavery , ed. by Moses Finley (Totowa, NJ: F. Cass, 1987); Yvon Garlan, Slavery in Ancient Greece revised and expanded edition trans, by Janet Lloyd (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1998), and Peter Garnsey, Ideas of Slavery from Aristotle to Augustine (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996). 4. The treatment of aliens substantially differed. Thus, for, example, non-Israelites pur- chased by Israelites or taken as prisoners of war were not released after six years. (Leviticus 25:44-46). Indeed, the standards of practice set out for Jewish slaves must often have been merely hortatory; the reality was presumably often far harsher. 5. «You shall not give up to his master a slave who has escaped from his master to you; he shall dwell with you, in your midst, in the place which he shall choose within one of your towns, where it pleases him best; you shall not oppress him» (Deuteronomy 23:15-16). Moreover, Moses' law may have applied to fleeing non-Isráelites as well, given that the founding narrative of exodus from Egypt meant that the nation itself, once the victim of harsh treatment, was an escaped "slave" from Egypt: "Love the sojourner therefore; for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt" (Deuteronomy 10:19); «you shall love your neigh- bour as yourself... The stranger who sojourns with you shall be to you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself; for you were strangers in the land of Egypt» (Leviticus 19:18, 34).</page><page sequence="3">Authority and Theodicy in Hobbes's Leviathan 177 every 50 years ( Leviticus 25:39). Relatives might redeem the slave, and, if not redeemed, the slave's service ended after six years, together with a gift of cat- tle or fruit from the master {Exodus 21:2; Deuteronomy 15:12-15). One's wife and children also went free unless the slave had received her from the master, in which case she and her children remained in servitude (Exodus 21:4). Chil- dren of Hebrew slaves became slaves of their parents' master, although this was not permanent (Exodus 21:6; Deuteronomy 15:17). Female betrothed slaves could not be sexually violated. (. Leviticus 19:20). Children of defaulting debtors could be sold to pay the debt or were claimed along with their fathers as slaves until the succeeding year of jubilee (Exodus 21:7; Leviticus 25:39-41, 47, 54; 2 Kings 4:1; Nehemiah 5:15; Isaiah 50:1; Job 24:9). Exploitation of widows and orphans whether slaves or not was forbidden. (Exodus 20:17; 21:2, 11,26-32). One might become a slave through poverty, the inability to sustain oneself and one's family (Leviticus 25:39, 47; cf. Deuteronomy 15:12-13). Some of David's followers were defaulting debtors who had fled their creditors (I Samuel 22:2). Restitution for theft also was a way to enslavement. The law required thieves to return double what they had stolen, and those unable to do so were sold into slavery (Exodus 22:1-4). Abduction could also result in slavery, as in the case of Joseph, whose brothers sold him as a slave ( Genesis 37:27-28; cf. 45:4), though reduction to slavery of a kidnapped person was a crime punishable by death in the codes both of Hammurabi, «the shepherd of the oppressed and of slaves» (#14) and of Moses (Exodus 21:16; Deuteronomy 24:7). In his sixth year of service, the slave could choose to become a permanent slave by coming before the elders and having his ear bored through with an awl against a doorpost (Exodus 21:6; Deuteronomy 15: 17)6. This seems to be the custom to which the writer refers in Hebrews 10:57, where he speaks in the words of the Psalter (Psalms 40:6-8), attributing them to Jesus himself*: 6. A vestigial belief in the sanctity of the gods of comings and goings associated with doors may lie behind this practice. The ceremony by which slavery became permanent is described in Exodus 21:6: «Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him for ever». 7. This option for permanent slavery must have been open only to those whose slavery might end, viz., Jewish slaves, and it is to this custom and its social practices that Paul refers in Hebrews. 8. On Paul's metaphorical use of slavery and its cognates, see Dale Martin, Slavery as Salvation : The Metaphor of Slavery in Pauline Christianity (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1990); David J. Williams, Paul's Metaphors : Their Context and Character (Peabody, MA: Hendrickson Publishing, Inc., 1999), esp. pp. 11 Iff. As both authors make clear, Paul drew heavily upon both the classical and Jewish/Christian experience of slavery, especially in describing the nature and cost of redemption. Thus, while he knew of the Jewish cere- mony by which slavery became permanent, he also drew upon the customs of classical an- tiquity in describing himself as branded as Christ's slave; see Galatians 6:17.</page><page sequence="4">178 George Wright Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not9, but a body hast thou prepared me10: In burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin thou hast had no pleasure. Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me), to do thy will, O God. Taking David as type11, Paul, the Jewish convert to Christianity, describes Christ's faithfulness to the Father in terms of the slave's desire for permanent servitude to a master. In so doing and in then applying it to himself as apostle, Paul employs a vocabulary that will determine later Christian theology of wor- ship and of commitment, namely, the language of service and servitude sig- naled by his use of the Greek terms Àmpeía, ôoutaía, 8ox&gt;ta)ç (latreia, douleia and doulos), as in the salutation beginning his letter to the Romans: riAYAOI òovXoq XpiöT0')'Ir|a0t&gt;, kà,t|tòç ànóaxoXoq àcpíopiajiévoç eiç EVKxyyeXaov 0£oî&gt;. (Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God)12. Or, later, in the same letter, at 12:1: napami® oiW i)|xaç, àÔetapoí, Sia xéov oiKtipjaxov tot» 0eo'), mpaaTTļaai xá Gabala i)|iG)v 0Doíav Çœoav ócyíav tćo 0ećp eúápeaxov, irļv ^oyiKTļv taxi peí av 9. On the rejection of the sacrificial principle, see Psalms 50:9-12; Psalms 51:16-17, and Mark 7:15. On sacrifice, see below, p. 194. 10. The writer of Hebrews quotes the Septuagint version ( Psalm 39) of the passage; the Hebrew version in translation ( Psalm 40) has: «Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened : burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required» (Em- phasis added). 11. On typology and figure, see Erich Auerbach, "Figure" Yale French Studies 9 (1952): 3-101 "Figurative Texts Illustrating Passages of Dante's Commedia " Speculum 21 (1953): 474-89, and "Figura" Scenes from the Drama of European Literature (Gloucester, MA: Peter Smith, 1973). See also Paul Korshin, Typologies in England, 1650-1820 (Prince- ton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1982). Auerbach stresses an important check upon the role and authority of préfiguration, namely, that it is knowledge based upon human intuition of God's knowledge of the world as immediate presence. As he says ("Figure," op. cit., p. 10), «The eternal coexistence in God's mind of all historical events is a conception best ex- pressed by Saint Augustine's doctrine that God keeps present in his mind all things past and future in their true reality - that therefore it is not correct to speak of God's fore-knowl- edge, but simply of his knowledge - scientia Dei non praescientia sed tantum scientia dici potest. Figurism gives the basis for the medieval fusion between realistic naivete and other- worldly wisdom». The Protestant understanding of prophecy was quite different, as is evi- dent from Luther's keen interest in the prophetic literature both of sacred scripture and of his era; see, for example, his introduction to the Vitae Romanorum Pontificum of the Eng- lish reformer Robert Barnes (Basel and Wittenburg: J. Klug, 1536). On prophecy in Hobbes, see Kinch Hoekstra, "Disarming the Prophets", Rivista della storia di filosofia , in this volume. 12. Williams challenges Martin's assertion that slavery in these contexts connotes not subjection but a first step toward a better social position; see Williams, op. cit., p. 126, note 21, commenting on Martin, op. cit., p. 137. The rhetorical power of the latter interpretation seems to make it clearly preferable to Martin's.</page><page sequence="5">Authority and Theodicy in Hobbes's Leviathan 179 i)|xcov. (I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable ser- vice)13. Paul is often taken to be conservative in his reactions to the institution of slavery as he knew it, urging slaves to serve their masters well and returning his helper and run-away slave Onesimus to his master Philemon14. His preach- ing however tended to undermine the social and cultural hierarchies of his era by insisting that all shared together in the epochal event of the Christ, as in Galatians 3:28: «There is no such thing as Jew and Greek, slave and freeman, male and female, for you are all one person in Christ Jesus». Moreover, to claim to be a slave of God was to claim a specially privileged position, carry- ing a special stamp of authority, as was also the case with Moses, another slave of God15. The leader making such a claim thereby manifested a calling to a life of service to God and fellow man16. Paul's language of servitude, commitment and worship knew a long devel- opment in Christian theology, culminating in several distinctions drawn by the Roman Catholic Church between òovXeía, Latinized as dulia , and Àmpeía, latria : • If it is addressed directly to God, it is superior, absolute, supreme worship, or wor- ship of adoration, or, according to the consecrated theological term, a worship of latria . This sovereign worship is due to God alone; addressed to a creature it would become idolatry ; 13. Cf. Galatians 1:10; Ephesians 3:7; Colossians 1: 23 and 25; Colossians 4:7, and Ti- tus 1:1. Williams detects a contrast which Paul is drawing between pagan cultic sacrificial practices and the service owed by Christians to God {op. cit., p. 250): His goal for them was to become «an offering acceptable» to God. This echoes his earlier plea that his readers should offer themselves, «their bodies as a living sacri- fice», in contrast with the slain animals of the cultus (cf. Romans 6:8, 11, 13), not as a propitiatory sacrifice but a sacrifice of praise, «holy, acceptable to God, as their spiritual service». He then glosses the passage in a note (op. cit., n. 52, p. 256): Tīļv Àx)yiKi1v Àmpeíav ')jia&gt;v • AoyiKÓç, an old word, «reasonable, rational». Here the phrase means «worship rendered by the reason», i.e., inward or spiritual wor- ship. Only here and in / Peter 2:2 in the New Testament. Aaxpeicx (from Xaxpevco) «to work for hire, to serve», itself from tarcpiç «a hired servant»): «Hired service, service». In the Septuagint nine times, always, with one exception, in a cultic con- nection, «divine service, worship», as also in Romans 9:4 and Hebrews 9:12, 6. 14. See Philemon 12: «In sending [Philemon] back to you, I am sending my heart». 15. See 1 Chronicles 6:49; 2 Chronicles 24:9, and Nehemiah 10:29; cf. Hebrews 3:5. 16. On Paul's authority as an apostle, see Acts 15:6ff. Martin argues that the topos of the enslaved leader was well-known in classical antiquity, especially as distinguished from that of the «benevolent patriarch»; see Martin, op. cit., pp. 86ff. Paul's self-enslavement was different in kind from the classical models and had practical significance in dealing both with the expectations of low-class gentile audiences and with the high-born gentiles' expectations regarding his own model of evangelization. More importantly, it also was a central metaphor of Pauline salvation theology; see Martin, op. cit., pp. 129ff.</page><page sequence="6">180 George Wright • When worship is addressed only indirectly to God, that is, when its object is the veneration of martyrs, of angels, or of saints, it is a subordinate worship dependent on the first, and relative, insofar as it honors the creatures of God for their peculiar relations with Him; it is designated by theologians as the worship of dulia , a term denoting servitude, and implying, when used to signify our worship of distin- guished servants of God, that their service to Him is their title to our veneration; • As the Blessed Virgin has a separate and absolutely super eminent rank among the saints, the worship paid to her is called hyper dulia11 . Dulia may find expression in external acts of reverence and by invocation not only to the saints but also to objects closely related to the saints, such as their garments, relics and images18. We shall see that the Protestant Hobbes drops hyperdulia , and, recasting the dulia/latria distinction, he employs it in his own way, using classical reference points19. Slavery among Greeks and Romans Hobbes is an apt interpreter of the experience of Greeks and Romans; his knowledge of ancient languages, culture and institutions was impressive, as was that of his era, given the re-awakening of interest in antiquity stemming from the Renaissance. It was in this vein that he undertook his first major pub- lication, the 1629 translation of Thucydides' The History of the Peloponnesian War , a work whose author's mastery both of Greek and of English prose style is evident even today20. The English Leviathan gives several examples of his knowledge of Greek and Roman antiquities, including his recounting of a fa- mous incident at Abdera, when, due to the heat of the summer, a presentation of Euripides' Andromeda led the inhabitants of that city to declaim and speak 17. See Catholic Encyclopedia , sub voce "Christian worship", found at www.newad- vent.org/cathen/ 1571 Oa.htm. See also Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae 2.2.103.3. 18. The practice continues; see, for example, Pope John Paul's apostolic letter Duodec- imum Saeculum , in which he celebrates the twelfth centenary of the second council of Nicaea (787), with its endorsement of icons as- against the iconoclastic movement in the East: «Hence Nicaea II solemnly reaffirmed the traditional distinction between the "true adoration" (taxi peía) which, "according to our faith is rendered to the unique divine na- ture" and the "prostration of honor" (xifiexiicri 7tpooKÍveoiç) which is attributed to icons, for he who prostrates himself before the icon does so before the person (imÓGiaaiç) which is represented therein». See Mansi, Sanctorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima Collectio (1757-1798), XIII, 377E. 19. Given the substantial changes he makes to it, it may be more accurate to say that Hobbes rejects the Roman Catholic distinction. Certainly, he emphasizes the intentional context within which any action of honor must be understood; see below, p. 186. 20. Hobbes wanted to supply the need for a more accurate English translation than that of Thomas Nicolis of 1550, whose text had been a French translation by Bishop Seyssel of Marseilles, working from Lorenzo Valla's Latin translation of the original. See Richard Schlatter, "Introduction", Hobbes' s Thucydides (New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 1975), pp. xiff.</page><page sequence="7">Authority and Theodicy in Hobbes' s Leviathan 181 in iambics21. Also, he seeks to trace remnants of ancient practices in those of his contemporaries. Thus, he detects in the honors shown the Roman pontiff the ancient practice of bearing images of divinities before admiring crowds in a shrine, known in Latin as a thensa or tensa , borne on a litter or palanquin, known as a ferculum22: Leviathan 4.45.36.680: The carrying about of images in procession, is another relic of the religion of the Greeks, and Romans: for they also carried their idols from place to place, in a kind of chariot, which was peculiarly dedicated to that use, which the Latins called thensa , and vehiculum De o rum23 ' and the image was placed in a frame, or shrine, which they called ferculum: and that which they called pompa24, is the same that now is named procession. According whereunto, amongst the divine honours which were given to Julius Caesar by the senate, this was one, that in the pomp (or procession) at the Circaean games, he should have thensam et ferculum, a sacred char- iot and a shrine; which was as much, as to be carried up and down as a god: just as at this day the Popes are carried by Switzers under a canopy. 21. See Leviathan 1.8.25.142. The episode is recounted by Lucian of Samosata (c. 125- c. 180), an author whose Greek, if not his religion, Hobbes commends in the Appendix added to the Latin Leviathan of 1668; see §107. Hobbes also cites him in the Elements of Philosophy , the Answer to Bishop Bramhall and the Dialogue between a Phylosopher and a Student. Both Laurence Sterne, in his A Sentimental Journey through France and Italy (1768), and Christian Martin Wieland, in his Geschichte der Abderiten (1777), mention the incident at Abdera. 22. The images of the gods could also be carried on men's shoulders, as was pictured on the architrave of the temple of Aesclapius ("Apollo Medico") on the Tibertine island. There, Augustus' triumphs of 29 BC over the Germans and Egypt and at Actium were memorialized in stone. The Vulgate uses ferculum in describing the silver and gold vehicle which Solomon made for himself out of wood from Lebanon, described in Song of Songs 3:9. 23. Suetonius notes in his life of Caesar (§76) that ferculum et thensa at the circus was accorded Caesar, an honor thought too great for mortals. Other honors included an uninter- rupted consulship; the dictatorship for life; the censorship of public morals; the forename Imperator; the surname of Father of his Country; a statue among those of the kings; a raised couch in the orchestra; a golden throne in the curia and on the judgment seat; temples, al- tars, and statues beside those of the gods; a special priest; an additional college of the Lu- perci, and the calling of one of the months by his name. 24. In addition to showings at triumphs given war heroes, the gods were borne in then- sae at the Circensian games, that is, those celebrated in the Circus Maximus at Rome. The games began with a solemn procession known as the pompa circensis , during which all those who would take part in the day's festivities would parade before the assembly with images, statues, chairs of divinities, litters, thrones, crowns and costumes. Tertullian, in De Spectaculis , says that the solemn character of the parade betrays the games' origin in pagan superstition, and, clearly, Hobbes is taxing the Roman church with vestigial elements of pa- ganism, both in its ceremony and the development of its doctrine; see his vivid description of Roman theology as Empusa, the demonic, underworld goddess, mentioned by Aristo- phanes in The Frogs 294 and Ecclesiazusae 1057, crowned with flaming hair and having for legs one of brass and the other of a donkey. Hobbes mentions her again in such works as the Elements of Philosophy and the Six Lessons ; on this, see Douglas M. Jesseph, Squar- ing the Circle : The War between Hobbes and Wallis (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999), pp. 31 Iff.</page><page sequence="8">1 82 George Wright As we shall see25, the problem with Hobbes's use of classical antecedents to explain concepts of political philosophy is an interpretive one; it does not lie with his knowledge of the former. Enslavement among the Greeks and Romans is attested in records as far back as we have; along with the American South, they provide the relatively rare instances of slavery as a basic institution in human affairs. In Greece, it came to be predicated on the distinction between citizen and non-citizen: only non-citizens could pass from being a person to being property, though enslave- ment was permitted among citizens, but only after physical ejection from the community (fictitiously in the case of exposed children) or as commutation of capital punishment26. Enslavement of outsiders and their conversion into prop- erty meant deracination, loss of name and of all the normal ties of kin and na- tion, even of gods, replaced by new attachments supplied by the master and his society. Slaves were employed throughout the gamut of human activities, though, of course, they could not engage as citizens in political activity. Crime, war and piracy were the chief sources of slave supply, though Greek slave-traders surely dealt with "barbarians", whose supply came either through warfare amongst themselves or through the sale of children. Problems associated with institution had become acute in Athens27, for which we have the greatest attestation28, just prior to the archonship of Solon 25. See below, p. 183. 26. Giorgio Agamben has brilliantly discussed the homo sacer , the haunted figure ex- cluded from political life, as the precondition for the distinction between friend and foe de- veloped by Carl Schmitt; see his Homo Sacer. Sovereign Power and Bare Life trans, by Daniel Heller-Roazen (Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1998). 27. This is how Plutarch describes it, in Dryden's translation: All the people were indebted to the rich; and either they tilled their land for their creditors, paying them a sixth part of the increase, and were, therefore, called Hectemorii and Thetes, or else they engaged their body for the debt, and might be seized, and either sent into slavery at home, or sold to strangers; some (for no law forbade it) were forced to sell their children, or fly their country to avoid the cruel- ty of their creditors; but the most part and the bravest of them began to combine to- gether and encourage one another to stand to it, to choose a leader, to liberate the condemned debtors, divide the land, and change the government. Then the wisest of the Athenians, perceiving Solon was of all men the only one not implicated in the troubles, that he had not joined in the exactions of the rich and was not involved in the necessities of the poor, pressed him to succour the commonwealth and compose the differences. Cf. Aristotle, On the Athenian Constitution , parts 7 and 12, and the accounts given by Herodotus and Pausanias as well as the comparison Plutarch draws between Solon and Pub- licóla. 28. It is always dangerous to extrapolate from the experience of Athens, which may often have been singular; see François de Polignac, Cults , Territory and the Origins of the Greek City-state trans, by Janet Lloyd (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1995).</page><page sequence="9">Authority and Theodicy in Hobbes's Leviathan 183 (594-93)29. His oeioaxOeia (seisachtheia), the «shaking off» or canceling of all debts for which land or personal liberty was security, freed Athenians from debt-bondage and tended to close the point of access of Athenians into slavery. Also, he either created or added to the division of the Athenian population into census classes based on wealth and military performance (teAjļ) rather than birth. The irateiç (hippeis) were the "knights", rich men who provided their own horses and had political sentiments corresponding to their wealth. The ÇeDyíxai (zeugitai) were those of moderate substance who could provide their own armament or yoke of oxen. Corresponding roughly to farmers and craftsmen, this class also supplied the hoplites of the Athenian army, those who went down on their knees (òtcA/ltoci) to fight with sword and shield against opposing archers or cavalry» The Gfjxeç (thetes) were day laborers or hired men, the humblest class in a Greek city, those who could not afford a horse or suit of armor. They did not serve in the hoplite ranks, though they fought as light-armed soldiers and found service later as paid rowers, sailors and marines in the triremes of the Athenian navy, as at the battles of Ther- mopylae and Salamis. Citizens whose income did not reach 150 bushels of grain, measured in drachmas, the participated only in the eKicXeaícc (ekklesia), the assembly of the peopie, which selected the magistrates. But, they also served on the courts of justice, thereby obtaining a measure of real political power, especially through the review of the actions of the magistrates. To these, Solon evidently added the rcevTocKooioļjiSivoi (pentakosiomedi- noi), literally, the "500-bushel men", those whose annual income exceeded the value of 500 drachmas. In shifting the ground of political privilege from birth to wealth, Solon secured the rights of all citizens to some share in the govern- ment and broke the monopoly on power enjoyed by the nobles (eimaTpíôai), thereby laying the foundation of the future democracy30. It may have been an effect of Solon's reforms that slavery came to be seen as fit only for non-citi- zens or even non-Greeks. This may be the cultural precondition of Aristotle's doctrine of natural slavery; as he says in the Politics (1.2.8): «To rule and be ruled are, therefore, not necessary but also beneficial, and straight from birth some are marked to be ruled and others to rule». Slave and Free in Hobbes Incongruously perhaps, it is upon this background in the experience of an- 29. On Solon, see W. J. Woodhouse, Solon the Liberator.

To fall prostrate before a king, in him that thinks him but a man, is but civil worship: and he that but putteth off his hat in the church, for this cause, that he thinketh it the house of God, worshippeth with divine worship. They that seek the dis- tinction of divine and civil worship, not in the intention of the worshipper, but in the words ÔODÀ,£Ía and taxipeia, deceive themselves. For whereas there be two sorts of servants: that sort, which is of those that are absolutely in the power of their masters, as slaves taken in war, and their issue, whose bodies are not in their own power, (their lives depending on the will of their masters, in such manner as to forfeit them upon the least disobedience), and that are bought and sold as beasts, were called 80ÚÀ01, that is properly, slaves, and their service ôoutaía: the other, which is of those that serve (for hire, or in hope of benefit from their masters) voluntarily, are called Otiieç; that is, do- mestic servants, to whose service the masters have no further right, than is contained in the covenants made betwixt them. These two kinds of servants have thus much com- mon to them both, that their labour is appointed them by another: and the word tarcpiç, is the general name of both, signifying him that worketh for another, whether, as a slave, or a voluntary servant. So that Xaxpeia signifieth generally all service; but Soucia the service of bondmen only, and the condition of slavery: and both are used in Scripture (to signify our service of God) promiscuously; Soutaia, because we are God's slaves; Àmpeía, because we serve him31. And in all kinds of service is con- tained, not only obedience, but also worship; that is, such actions, gestures, and words, as signify honour. The reverence due the immortal divinity is that which slaves owe to their master, namely, absolute submission such that their very lives and bodies are in another's power. This description indeed recalls the power of Greek and Ro- man masters, who could maim or kill their human property largely with im- punity, but it sorts rather badly with the rather temperate and limited slavery known among ancient Jews. In the latter case, as we have seen, slavery, made permanent through an act of will, could become a metaphor for faithful service and ground a claim of authority, as in the cases of Moses and Paul. By comparison to that of the slave, the reverence owed the mortal god, from whom, under the immortal God, we secure our peace and defense, is like that owed by a hired man to his master. Encompassed in this relationship are both the responsibilities and duties of the hired man as well as the limits upon the authority of the master. Among the latter we may include the requirements 31. On Àmpeía, see John 16:2; Romans 9:4 and 12:1; Hebrews 9:1 and 9:6. On ÔouA-eía, see Romans 8:15 and 8:21, Galatians 4:24 and 5:1, and Hebrews 2:15.

Hobbes's distinction between the Axxxpeia owed civil sovereigns and the òovXeía owed the divine sovereign rests upon some familiar features of his thinking regarding honor and worship, which he recounts in detail in chapter 10 of Leviathan. Honor, Price and Power At the root of any honor rendered to another lies some conception of worth or value, that is, the price at which others set the use of one's powers, for, while one may wish to set his or her use at the highest price, in fact it is not the seller but the buyer who determines price, which varies with circumstance. A temperate and learned judge is of great price in peace, but not so in war. Nor is all power rightly esteemed: Leviathan 1.10.14.151: The sciences, are small power; because not eminent; and the- refore, not acknowledged in any man; nor are at all, but in a few, and in them, but of a few things. For science is of that nature, as none can understand it to be, but such as in a good measure have attained it. And, the true ground and source of power may be misperceived: Leviathan 1.10.15.151: Arts of public use, as fortification, making of engines, and other instruments of war; because they confer to defence, and victory, are power: and though the true mother of them, be science, namely the mathematics; yet, because they are brought into the light, by the hand of the artificer, they be esteemed (the midwife passing with the vulgar for the mother), as his issue. In turn, at the root of perceived worth or value lies power, one's present means to obtain some future apparent good. Power may be both natural and instrumental . Natural power consists in such strengths of the mind and body as: extraordinary strength33, form34, prudence, arts, eloquence, liberality, nobility. Instru- mental are those powers, which acquired by these, or by fortune, are means and instru- ments to acquire more: as riches, reputation, friends, and the secret working of God, which men call good luck. For the nature of power, is in this point, like to fame35, in- 32. On natural, ethical obligation, see Alan Ryan, "Hobbes and Individualism," Per- spectives on Thomas Hobbes ed. by G.A.J.

Signs manifest the honor and dishonor we feel for one another; they are the means whereby we communicate our estimations of others' power in the struggle for recognition that is daily life36. Such estimations occur naturally and in commonwealths, and they have nothing necessarily to do with goodness and justice or their opposites, Hobbes says, but only with opinion of power37: Leviathan 1.10.48.156: Nor does it alter the case of honour, whether an action (so it be great and difficult, and consequently a sign of much power), be just or unjust: for hon- our consisteth only in the opinion of power. Therefore the ancient heathen did not think they dishonoured, but greatly honoured the Gods, when they introduced them in their poems, committing rapes, thefts, and other great, but unjust, or unclean acts: in- somuch as nothing is so much celebrated in Jupiter, as his adulteries38; nor in Mercury, as his frauds, and thefts: of whose praises, in a hymn of Homer, the greatest is this, that being born in the morning, he had invented music at noon, and before night, stolen away the cattle of Apollo, from his herdsmen39. As honor is in the eye of the beholder, so the efficacy of signs of honor, if Extemplo Libyae magnas it Fama per urbes - Fama, malum qua non aliud velocius ullum; mobilitate viget, viresque adquirit eundo... s 36. See Leviathan 1.11.2.161: So that in the first place, I put for a general inclination of all mankind, a perpetual and restless desire of power after power, that ceaseth only in death. And the cause of this, is not always that a man hopes for a more intensive delight, than he has already attained to; or that he cannot be content with a moderate power: but because he cannot assure the power and means to live well, which he hath present, without the acquisition of more. 37. On paternal and «despotical» power, see generally Leviathan , chapter 20. The analysis that Hobbes gives in that chapter bears out the view expressed here that, while he understands the power which the master initially exerts over the «servant» to encompass life and death, should the master offer a contractual relationship establishing political com- munity, entrance into that relationship is voluntary for both, even if forced upon the servant by dire circumstance. See Leviathan 2.20.2.252." While the quotation from I Samuel 8 re- garding Moses' power {Leviathan 2.20.16.257) defines it as «absolute», that is, neither di- vided nor contingent, this evidently regards the scope of power as once established, that it be «as great, as possibly men can be imagined to make it» {Leviathan 2.20.18.260). Hobbes' s theory of the will is controversial; cf., for example, G. A. J. Rogers, "Hobbes, Sovereignty and Consent," and Patrick Riley, "Michael Oakeshott as a Critic of Hobbes' s Theory of the Will," Rivista di storia della filosofia , this volume. 38. Hobbes is referring to such incidents as the god's ravishing of Io, of Ganymede, of Leda, etc., by way of a variety of instrumentalities. 39.

When it is commanded, not the words, or gesture, but the obedience is the worship. But when free, the worship consists in the opinion of the beholders: for if to them the words, or actions by which we intend honour, seem ridiculous, and tending to contu- mely; they are no worship; because no signs of honour; and no signs of honour; be- cause a sign is not a sign to him that giveth it, but to him to whom it is made; that is, to the spectator. «Rational Worship» Though, in discussing honor, he withholds moral condemnation for the ne- farious exploits of the gods depicted by Homer and Hesiod, in his own natural theology, Hobbes incorporates a key facet of Western theological discourse, namely, the attempt to arrive at forms of worship, language and thought wor- thy of the intuition we have of the divine. Criticism of Homer and Hesiod among the Greeks led to a movement away from local, anthropomorphic and anthropopathic gods, beginning with Xenophanes (570-475), who complained that «Homer and Hesiod have ascribed to the gods all things that are a shame and a disgrace among mortals, stealing and adulteries and deceiving of one an- other» (Diehls, frag. 11). His conception of the divine led him to affirm the ex- istence of: [a] single god, the greatest among gods and men, not similar to men either in form or in thought [...]. He sees in his entirety, thinks in his entirety, hears in his entirety [...]. But without effort he governs everything by the force of his spirit [...]. And he dwells always in the same place, without moving at all, nor does it suit him to displace him- self from one side to the other. (Diehls, fragg. 23-26) Xenophanes inaugurated what became the philosophic criticism of popular religious conceptions and forms of worship; it is found in Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics and Epicureans, then also in the Greek and Latin Church Fathers and the Reformers40. It is operative in our day in the theology of Paul Tillich, for example, whose discussion of the religious symbol41 bears within it the aware- ness of theology's need to cast off antiquated forms, much as the true deity re- 40.

Their rights may at first be chal- lenged, but in the end they are acknowledged, and people come to yield their admira- tion. Inferior things may be esteemed for a time but the end is a great yawn [...] Change is gradual. The foreign god takes his place next to the native idol, little by lit- tle asserts itself, and one fine day elbows out his fellow - before you can say Jack Robertson (sic) there's the idol, flat on its back42. Hobbes too participates in this long tradition of critical theology, in at least two ways. For one, especially in the second half of Leviathan , he develops the common Protestant criticism brought against what he considered Roman su- perstition, the «kingdom of darkness», for example, the practices of exorcism and holy water43. But, in chapter 31, the pivotal transition to the second half, he also sets out a detailed, positive description of the criteria of «rational wor- ship», deriving them from his conclusions regarding what natural reason dis- covers as to God and His attributes44. Thus, as he sums up the book's first half and makes the transition from natural knowledge to revelation, he states the natural ground of our servitude to God, namely, His irresistible power, the concept which Prof. Foisneau has so persuasively analyzed45: God is being-itself, the structure of being, possessing the power of determining the structure of everything that has being. Apart from this statement, everything else said of God is sym- bolic in the sense that every segment of finite reality used as a symbol, while it participates in the power of the divine to which it points, nonetheless is transcended by that very power: The segment of finite reality which becomes the vehicle of a concrete assertion about God is affirmed and negated at the same time. It becomes a symbol, for a symbolic expression is one whose proper meaning is negated by that to which it points. Still, it also is affirmed by it, and this affirmation gives the symbolic expres- sion an adeauate basis for pointing bevond itself. 42.

This essay, which traveled in 1784 with Diderot's other writings to L' Hermitage as the property of Katharine the Great, might never have been read but for a second copy smuggled out of Russia and circulated first in Germany at the end of the eighteenth century. It first reached Schiller, then Goethe, and its entrance into public awareness may be dated to 1805, just two years prior to the publication of Hegel's Phenomenology , in which it is quoted. 43. See, for example, Leviathan 4.46.18.691. It is peculiar that Hobbes concentrates on the alleged abuses of the Catholic Church in 1651, after the execution of the king and the Independents were at the height of their power. The late Karl Schuhmann once proposed that Hobbes incorporated into Leviathan a tract, not now in existence, against Bellarmine, his target in chapter 42. Or, he may have felt that the English Presbyterians perpetuated some key errors of the Roman church. If so, the extension of his argument against Catholi- cism, with its condemnation of the importation of Greek demonology into Christian theolo- gy, seems inapposite. 44. The noetic status of these conclusions is difficult to assess; I hope to write at greater length on this topic in the future. 45.

I have formerly shown, how the sovereign right ariseth from pact: to show how the same right may arise from nature, requires no more, but to show in what case it is never tak- en away. Seeing all men by nature had right to all things, they had right every one to reign over all the rest. But because this right could not be obtained by force, it con- cerned the safety of every one, laying by that right, to set up men (with sovereign au- thority) by common consent, to rule and defend them: whereas if there had been any man of power irresistible; there had been no reason, why he should not by that power have ruled, and defended both himself, and them, according to his own discretion. To those therefore whose power is irresistible, the dominion of all men adhereth naturally by their excellence of power; and consequently it is from that power, that the kingdom over men, and the right of afflicting men at his pleasure, belongeth naturally to God Almighty; not as Creator, and gracious; but as omnipotent. And though punishment be due for sin only, because by that word is understood affliction for sin; yet the right of afflicting, is not always derived from men's sin, but from God's power. Then, in a novel approach, Hobbes links the divine attributes, discovered by natural reason, to the language of worship which they rationally require46: Leviathan 2.31.14.401: That we may know what worship of God is taught us by the light of nature, I will begin with his attributes. For one, we do not do honor to that whose existence we doubt, so the first requirement of proper worship is to attribute existence to God: Leviathan 2.31.14.401: Where, first, it is manifest, we ought to attribute to him exis- tence. For no man can have the will to honour that, which he thinks not to have any be- ing. For another, God must be distinguished from world as its cause: Leviathan 2.31.15.401: Secondly, that those philosophers, who said the world, or the soul of the world was God, spake unworthily of him; and denied his existence. For by God, is understood the cause of the world; and to say the world is God, is to say there is no cause of it, that is, no God. Awareness of the world's dependence upon God is secured by language recognizing that it is created and not eternal: Leviathan 2.31.16.402: Thirdly, to say the world was not created, but eternal, (seeing that which is eternal has no cause), is to deny there is a God. 46. While I agree with Prof. Sorell that Hobbes describes «un Dieu dont les attributs sont dictées par une philosophie de la science," I cannot agree that "Il ne joue pas de rôle important dans la science politique qui y est enseignée». See Tom Sorell, "Le Dieu de la Philosophie et le Dieu de la Religion chez Hobbes," Politique , Droit et Théologie chez Bod- in, Grotius et Hobbes ed. by Luc Foisneau (Paris: Éditions KIMÉ, 1997), pp. 243-64.</page><page sequence="16">190 George Wright Recognition of God's concern for the world, His providence, is an affective source of the worship we render Him: Leviathan 2.31.17.402: Fourthly, that they who attributing (as they think) ease to God, take from him the care of mankind47; take from him his honour: for it takes away men's love, and fear of him; which is the root of honour48. The language of worship must also express a will to magnify God and not slight Him or contain Him within the frame of our limited understanding, un- less it be by way of metaphor: Leviathan 2.31.18.402ff.: Fifthly, in those things that signify greatness, and power; to say he is finite, is not to honour him: for it is not a sign of the will to honour God, to attribute to him less than we can; and finite, is less than we can; because to finite, it is easy to add more. Therefore to attribute figure to him, is not honour; for all figure is fi- nite: Nor to say we conceive, and imagine, or have an idea of him, in our mind: for whatsoever we conceive is finite: Nor to attribute to him parts, or totality; which are the attributes only of things finite: Nor to say he is in this, or that place: for whatsoev- er is in place, is bounded, and finite: Nor that he is moved, or resteth: for both these at- tributes ascribe to him place: Nor that there be more Gods than one; because it implies them all finite: for there cannot be more than one infinite: Nor to ascribe to him (unless metaphorically, meaning not the passion but the effect) passions that partake of grief; as repentance, anger, mercy: or of want; as appetite, hope, desire; or of any passive faculty: for passion, is power limited by somewhat else. And therefore when we as- cribe to God a will, it is not to be understood, as that of man, for a rational appetite; but as the power, by which he effecteth every thing. Likewise when we attribute to him sight, and other acts of sense; as also knowledge, and understanding; which in us is nothing else, but a tumult of the mind, raised by external things that press the organi- cal parts of man's body: for there is no such thing in God; and being things that depend on natural causes, cannot be attributed to him. He concludes his discussion of the language of rational worship with a powerful statement of negative or apophatic theology49: Leviathan 2.31.28.403: He that will attribute to God, nothing but what is warranted by natural reason, must either use such negative attributes, as infinite, eternal, incompre- hensible; or superlatives, as most high, most great, and the like; or indefinite, as good, just, holy, creator; and in such sense, as if he meant not to declare what he is, (for that were to circumscribe him within the limits of our fancy), but how much we admire 47. See the arguments in book ten of Plato's The Laws. 48. Cf. Luther's constant stress in his Small Catechism that we must love, fear and trust God. 49.

He then goes on to discuss the actions of divine worship and in so doing paraphrases a line from the Roman satirist Martial52: Leviathan 2.31.29.403: Concerning the actions of divine worship, it is a most general precept of reason, that they be signs of the intention to honour God; such as are, first, prayers: For not the carvers, when they made images, were thought to make them gods; but the people that prayed to them. Enumerating the forms of worship due to God, he comes to the fear which knowledge of God provokes in us and the theological restraint it requires of us. But, he also emphasizes the limits of human knowledge and language, not only in the sphere of theology but generally: 50. A reference to Exodus 3:13: ,3And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? 14 And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Is- rael, I AM hath sent me unto you. Note the similarity between Hobbes's statement and Tillich's, quoted above, note 41, uttered some 300 years later. Hobbes clarified the meaning of the statement «God exists» as early as the response to Thomas White's De Mundo : Personally, while I hold the nature of God is unfathomable, and that propositions are a kind of language by which we express our concepts of the natures of things, I incline to the view that no proposition about the nature of God can be true save this one: God exists, and that no title correctly describes the nature of God other than the word "being" | ens]. See " De Mundo " Examined trans, by H. W. Jones (London: Bradford University Press in association with Crosby Lockwood Staples, 1976), p. 434, as quoted in Richard Tuck, "The Civil Religion of Thomas Hobbes," Political Discourse in Early Modern Britain ed. by Nicholas Phillipson and Quentin Skinner (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, (1993), pp. 122ff., slightly emended. For Thomas' discussion of whether "He who is' is most properly applied to God as name, see Summa Theologiae 1.13.1. 5 1 . The attribution of these titles to God is a feature of ancient, specifically Platonic and especially Stoic, origin, so that, while the similarity with Christian terminology is striking, it is because the latter is indebted to the former, as well as to Jewish practice. These titles are appropriate in Hobbes's natural theology and do not here necessarily imply Christian commitments. Defining the distinction between natural and revealed religion is of the great- est moment in chapter 31 because the former sets natural limits of reason upon public con- fession and worship in the case of the latter, even, or especially, in the case of Christian civ- il religion. On civil religion in Hobbes, see Tuck, op. cit. pp. 120-38. 52. See Martial, Epigrammaton , book 8, poem 24: Qui fingit sacros auro uel mármore uultus, non facit ille deos: qui rogat, ille facit.

Hence fol- loweth, that the name of God is not to be used rashly, and to no purpose; for that is as much, as in vain: and it is to no purpose unless it be by way of oath, and by order of the commonwealth, to make judgments certain; or between commonwealths, to avoid war. And that disputing of God's nature is contrary to his honour: for it is supposed, that in this natural kingdom of God, there is no other way to know any thing, but by natural reason; that is, from the principles of natural science; which are so far from teaching us any thing of God's nature, as they cannot teach us our own nature, nor the nature of the smallest creature living. Hobbes's sweeping statement regarding the limits of human knowledge should neither lead us to slight the human capacity for thought nor blind us to some distinctions he makes as to different mental operations. As to the first53, clearly, Hobbes intends to bring all rational conjecture whereby we understand our experience of the world under quite restrictive epistemological premises, whether it concerns the divine nature, our own nature or that of the least bac- terium: «the principles of natural science, which are so far from teaching us...». Truth is a matter of words, not things; that our definitions and proposi- tions are well-defined and well-ordered is no guarantee that any of the objects of our study in fact exist. Truth is in this sense conditional, so that the import of any statement regarding the existence of something is always hypothetical: Leviathan 1.7.1.131: No discourse whatsoever, can end in absolute knowledge of fact, past, or to come. For, as for the knowledge of fact, it is originally, sense; and ever af- ter, memory. And for the knowledge of consequence, which I have said before is called science, it is not absolute, but conditional. No man can know by discourse, that this, or that, is, has been, or will be; which is to know absolutely: but only, that if this be, that is; if this has been, that has been; if this shall be, that shall be: which is to know conditionally; and that not the consequence of one thing to another; but of one name of a thing, to another name of the same thing. And therefore, when the discourse is put into speech, and begins with the definitions of words, and proceeds by connex- ion of the same into general affirmations, and of these again into syllogisms; the end or last sum is called the conclusion; and the thought of the mind by it signified, is that conditional knowledge, or knowledge of the consequence of words, which is common- ly called SCIENCE. While this is the case, there are differences among the truth claims which we may make regarding our reasonings. In insisting, as he does against his friend White54, that «àcpi^oaócpcoç faciunt qui profitentur se demonstraturos, quod Deus existit» (They do so unphilosophically who claim that they will demonstrate that God exists), Hobbes is not denying that the existence of God may be proven, as he himself does55. He is insisting upon a distinction be- 53. On what follows, see A.P.

Demonstration is argument whose propositions are a priori and necessary; as such, it is unable to prove the existence of any given state of affairs. Proofs for existence require empirical premises, such as the ev- idence of order in the world, which proves the existence of God. Certainly, reason neither demonstrates nor proves the existence of God as He is revealed in the scriptures, that is, as creator of the world56 and legislator of its laws. And, to deny that it does is to insist upon a key distinction within his own the- ology, whereby nature and grace are separated into different spheres57. As should be clear to this point, we have treated what natural reason teach- es as to the attributes of God, that is, Hobbes's natural theology, and the lan- guage of rational worship which it .requires. In that the existence of order in the world proves the existence of God, however far from demonstration this insight departs, it would be in error to describe it as psychological or stemming merely from feeling, though it surely gives rise to feeling58. For, as we shall see, Hobbes is at pains to distinguish superstition from «true religion», and this can be done only on the basis of their differing sources: the first in fear and interest; the second in thought. Both the superstitious and the rational wor- shipper fear God. But, the fear of God of the idolater is different in kind, source and object from the fear of God as omnipotent, resulting in the will to rational worship. The first is unwarranted because its object is non-existent, «nothing»; the second is warranted and approved by Hobbes59 as stemming from a conclusion of reason regarding the necessity with which causes follow one another, as shall appear60. Hobbes's commitment to the Xenophantic criterion of worship is apparent in his discussion of the ancients' worship of their gods: Leviathan 2.31.34.404: Sixthly, in prayers, thanksgivings, offerings and sacrifices, it is a dictate of natural reason, that they be every one in his kind the best, and most signif- icant of honour. As for example, that prayers and thanksgiving, be made in words and phrases, not sudden, nor light, nor plebeian; but beautiful, and well composed; For else we do not God as much honour as we can. And therefore the heathens did absurdly, to worship images for gods: but their doing it in verse, and with music, both of voice, and instruments, was reasonable. Also that the beasts they offered in sacrifice, and the gifts 56. This is to say that Hobbes refrains from opining as to whether the world is eternal, a restraint exercised by Aquinas, Duns Scotus and Ockham before him; see Martinich, ibid. 57. See below, pp. 199ff. I hope to write on this point at greater length at a later time. 58. Fear may follow upon knowledge of God as first cause, but fear is not the origin of the concept of God as first cause. See below, p. 198. 59. Leviathan 2.31.33.404: «Fifthly, it is a part of rational worship, to speak consider- ately of God; for it argues a fear of him, and fear, is a confession of his power». 60. See below, pp. 195ff. Hobbes eschews the term «rational fear» (see "Questions Concerning Liberty, Necessity and Chance" animadversion to XXV (d)), but some such term would seem to capture the sense he intends in approving fear at God's irresistible power. But, it is a fear that stems from a rational insight and thus is unlike the irrational fear of the idolater, stemming from interest and leading to «feigning» of its objects.</page><page sequence="20">194 George Wright they offered, and their actions in worshipping, were full of submission, and commem- orative of benefits received, was according to reason, as proceeding from an intention to honour him61. But, the greatest act of divine worship required by natural reason is obedi- ence to the laws of nature: Leviathan 2.31.36.405: Lastly, obedience to his laws (that is, in this case62 to the laws of nature), is the greatest worship of all. For as obedience is more acceptable to God than sacrifice63; so also to set light by his commandments, is the greatest of all contu- melies. And these are the laws of that divine worship, which natural reason dictateth to private men. «True Religion» and Theodicy We have seen that Hobbes believed that Greek popular religion did well to honor its gods in fitting forms of worship, though it failed to achieve an adequate conception of divinity, that is, one properly grounded in reason, with a fit object for its worship. But, Hobbes did find such a conception in the thought of ancient philosophers who described God as first cause; in- deed, the conception of God as first cause remains for him the rational ground upon which we owe God the honor, worship and devotion of the slave. For, reason, led by curiosity, at last concludes that God is first cause and as such the rightful object of our rational worship, as our discussion will show. Moreover, operating within the distinction between nature and grace, Hobbes sharply separates the conception of God discovered in nature from that revealed by grace through covenant64. Precisely the distinction between 61. Signs of worship can be both natural and instituted: Leviathan 2.31.39.406: But because not all actions are signs by constitution, but some are naturally signs of honour, others of contumely, these latter (which are those that men are ashamed to do in the sight of them they reverence) cannot be made by human power a part of Divine worship; nor the former (such as are decent, modest, humble behaviour) ever be separated from it. But whereas there be an infi- nite number of actions, and gestures, of an indifferent nature; such of them as the commonwealth shall ordain to be publicly and universally in use, as signs of hon- our, and part of God's worship, are to be taken and used for such by the subjects. And that which is said in the Scripture, It is better to obey God than men, hath place in the kingdom of God by pact, and not by nature. 62. 1 hat is, on natural grounds, apart trom the teachings or revealed religion. 63. See above, p. 178. 64. Hobbes had distinguished between God as the God of nature and God as the God of Abraham, as early as De cive chapter 16: 10. Now those [laws] are known to all, to wit, the decalogue, and those other, as well judicial as ceremonial laws, which we find from the twentieth chapter of Exo- dus to the end of Deuteronomy and the death of Moses. Now of those laws, deliv- ered in general by the hand of Moses, some there are which oblige naturally, being</page><page sequence="21">Authority and Theodicy in Hobbes's Leviathan 195 God discovered as first cause and God revealed as author grounds his theod- icy65. First, let us recall Hobbes's definitions of superstition and religion, true or not66: Leviathan 1.6.36.124: Fear of power invisible, feigned by the mind, or imagined from tales publicly allowed, RELIGION; not allowed, SUPERSTITION. And when the power imagined, is truly such as we imagine, TRUE RELIGION67. Theological truth, so to speak, is the circumstance in which what one ratio- nally takes to be the case about God is in fact the case. «And when the power imagined, is truly such as we imagine, TRUE RELIGION...»68. And, reason's made by God, as the God of nature, and had their force even before Abraham's time. Others there are which oblige by virtue of the covenant made with Abraham, being made by God as the God of Abraham, which had their force even before Moses's time, by reason of the former covenant. But there are others which oblige by virtue of that covenant only, which was made last with the people themselves; being made by God, as being the peculiar king of the Israelites. 65. To the term author, we might also add «person» in that God's disclosure of His per- sonal identity over time is the substance of Hobbes's doctrine of the Trinity, revealed in promise to the Israelites and then in fulfillment to Christians; on this, see my "Hobbes and the Economic Trinity," British Journal for the History of Philosophy 1 (1999): 397-428. Cf. Aquinas' statement, «It is impossible to attain to the knowledge of the Trinity by natural reason»; Summa Theologiae 1.32.1. Also, that God is legislator of the natural laws is a truth only of revelation; see Leviathan 1.15.41.216, but also Leviathan 2.31.2.395. 66. It is usual to assert that Hobbes separates reason and religion, but, as this discussion of his natural theology hopefully shows, that is at best a half-truth. 67. In his edition at this point, Prof. Curley questions whether this definition commits Hobbes to a purely political definition of religion. This seems correct in that, like Luther and Ludwig Feuerbach, Hobbes describes the inclination to worship as inborn and natural and thus prior to politics. See Leviathan 1.1 1.26.167: And they that make little, or no inquiry into the natural causes of things, yet from the fear that proceeds from the ignorance itself, of what it is that hath the power to do them much good or harm, are inclined to suppose, and feign unto themselves, several kinds of powers invisible; and to stand in awe of their own imaginations; and in time of distress to invoke them; as also in the time of an expected good success, to give them thanks; making the creatures of their own fancy, their gods. By which means it hath come to pass, that from the innumerable variety of fancy, men have created in the world innumerable sorts of gods. And this fear of things invisible, is the natural seed of that, which every one in himself cal- leth religion; and in them that worship, or fear that power otherwise than they do, supersti- tion. 68. In De cive (II, 21), Hobbes distinguished the natural knowledge of God from given forms of worship and confession in which it is expressed: «For though by the light of na- ture it may be known that there is a God, yet no man thinks he is to swear by him in any other fashion, or by any other name, than what is contained in the precepts of his own proper, that is (as he who swears imagines) the true religion». He makes a similar point later (XV, 16): And seeing men cannot be afraid of the power they believe not, and an oath is to no purpose, without fear of him they swear by; it is necessary that he that sweareth, do it in that form which himself admitteth in his own religion, and not in that form</page><page sequence="22">196 George Wright discovery of God as first cause is evidently true, for that realization is the final conclusion in the pursuit of the knowledge of the causes of things: Leviathan 1.11.25.167: Curiosity, or love of the knowledge of causes69, draws a man from consideration of the effect, to seek the cause; and again, the cause of that cause; till of necessity he must come to this thought at läst, that there is some cause, whereof there is no former cause, but is eternal; which is it men call God70. So that it is impos- sible to make any profound inquiry into natural causes, without being inclined thereby which he useth, that putteth him to the oath. For though all men may know by na- ture, that there is an Almighty power, nevertheless they believe not, that they swear by him, in any other form or name, than what their own (which they think the true) religion teacheth them. 69. Hobbes earlier described curiosity as the "lust of the mind;" Leviathan 1.6.35.124: Desire to know why, and how, CURIOSITY; such as is in no living creature but man: so that man is distinguished, not only by his reason, but also by this singular passion from other animals; in whom the appetite of food, and other pleasures of sense, by predominance, take away the care of knowing causes; which is a lust of the mind, that by a perseverance of delight in the continual and indefatigable gener- ation of knowledge, exceedeth the short vehemence of any carnal pleasure. I believe this answers the criticism of A. E. Taylor's theory that it failed to relate Hobbes' s psychology to his philosophy; see "The Ethical Doctrine of Hobbes," Hobbes Studies (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1965), pp.35-55. For a discussion of related points, see Kinch Hoekstra, "Hobbes on Law, Nature and Reason," Journal of the History of Philosophy 4 (2003): 111-20, commenting on an article previously published in that journal by John Deigh. 70. Hobbes is careful to characterize «God» as an indefinite name, which he defines in Elements of Law ( EW V, 6), as names «we limit not ourselves, but leave them to be applied by the hearer». The term has a long history as a technical expression in scholasticism, and its special trick is that, in the case of non-finite objects, such as God, it is by definition im- possible to render such a name finite, that is, to attach to it a definable reference and, by consequence, an identifiable meaning, in a sense to which everybody would be obliged to subscribe. Of course, the attempt to give a definable reference to God and thereby render Him an object of science would be fruitless and contrary to several of Hobbes' s most keen- ly argued theses regarding the scope of knowledge and the «nature» of God. Also, to do so would scarcely be characteristic in the Christian tradition; see above, note 49. Nonetheless, if, as I believe, Hobbes' s theology grounds his theory of natural obligation, then we should not be surprised if the latter is difficult to analyze and define; its ground in natural theolo- gy is similarly difficult to define. His adoption and use of the Xenophantic criterion of reli- gious language and worship is a clear indication of his intentions in discussing theological themes, even if the tendency of his thought would seem to disparage theology as «rhetoric», in contrast to «philosophy». Clearly, he intends his remarks and arguments as means of arriving at outcomes in religion more favorable to peace and concord than the theological disputes and impasses that had led to civil war. On his inability to maintain the philosophy/rhetoric distinction in his own writing, see Quentin Skinner, Reason and Rhetońc in the Philosophy of Hobbes (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996). More broadly, one must question whether the theoretical tools which he uses are adequate to the project he assays; his insights may have been superior to his means of expressing them. On Hobbes' s nominalism, see Martin Heidegger, The Basic Problems of Pheno- menology trans, by Albert Hofstadter (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1982), pp. 191-92.</page><page sequence="23">Authority and Theodicy in Hobbes's Leviathan 197 to believe there is one God eternal71; though they cannot have any idea of him in their mind, answerable to his nature. Hobbes then gives an eloquent simile to explain how one may arrive at a conception of something without a prior perception of the thing itself: Leviathan 1.11.25.167 con't: For as a man that is born blind, hearing men talk of warming themselves by the fire, and being brought to warm himself by the same, may easily conceive, and assure himself, there is somewhat there, which men call fire, and is the cause of the heat he feels; but cannot imagine what it is like; nor have an idea of it in his mind, such as they have that see it: so also, by the visible things of this world, and their admirable order, a man may conceive there is a cause of them, which men call God; and yet not have an idea, or image of him in his mind. We may distinguish true religion from superstition on the basis of their dif- ferent origins: in the latter, fear and interest; in the former, knowledge of caus- es: Leviathan 1.12.6.169: This perpetual fear, always accompanying mankind in the igno- rance of causes, as it were in the dark, must needs have for object something72. And therefore when there is nothing to be seen, there is nothing to accuse, either of their good, or evil fortune, but some power, or agent invisible: in which sense perhaps it was, that some of the old poets said, that the gods were at first created by human fear: which spoken of the gods, (that is to say, of the many gods of the Gentiles) is very true. Hobbes thus agrees with Luther that the superstitious invent («feign»; in Latin, fingere ) their gods out of fear, as the reformer says in his Large Cate- chism, explaining the First Commandment: Thou shalt have no other gods before Me. That is: Thou shalt have and worship Me alone as thy God. What is the force of this, and how is it to be understood? What does it mean to have a god? or, what is God? Answer: A god means that from which we are to expect all good and to which we are to take refuge in all distress, so that to have a God is nothing else than to trust and believe Him from the whole heart; as I have often said, the confidence and faith of the heart alone make both God and an idol [...] [Y]ou can easily see and judge how the world practices only false worship and idolatry. For no people has ever been so reprobate as not to institute and observe some divine wor- ship; every one has set up as his special god whatever he looked to for blessings, help, 71. The force of «inclined» is difficult to judge. If the conclusion as to the existence of God necessarily lacks the force of a demonstration, in that it follows an analysis of the train of causes, it seems more than a mere psychological tendency or propensity. It seems to be a necessary conclusion of reason, and, as we have seen above, note 68, that Hobbes is willing simply to state that nature teaches the existence of an omnipotent deity. 72. Hobbes may be said to describe a projection theory of superstition based on the hu- man need to operate in the world free of fear. This is not so different from many ancients' views or even from that of Feuerbach, though, unlike him, Hobbes explicitly withholds from extending his criticism to the conception of God as first cause, much less that revealed by faith.</page><page sequence="24">198 George Wright and comfort [...] Therefore the heathen really make their self-invented notions and dreams of God an idol, and put their trust in that which is altogether nothing. Thus it is with all idolatry; for it consists not merely in erecting an image and worshiping it, but rather in the heart While the Reformer emphasizes the elements of trust and belief for pagan and Christian alike, Hobbes gives a much more fully rationalist account of nat- ural theology, stressing the discovery of God as first cause as the ground of true religion, while both stress fear as the cause of superstition. Again, as Hobbes is at pains to emphasize, the ground of the natural belief in God is not fear and interest but curiosity into the causes of things: Leviathan 1.12.6.169, con't: But the acknowledging of one God73, eternal, infinite, and omnipotent, may more easily be derived, from the desire men have to know the causes of natural bodies, and their several virtues, and operations; than from the fear of what was to befall them in time to come. For he that from any effect he seeth come to pass, should reason to the next and immediate cause thereof, and from thence to the cause of that cause, and plunge himself profoundly in the pursuit of causes; shall at last come to this, that there must be (as even the heathen philosophers confessed)74 one first mover; that is, a first, and an eternal cause of all things; which is that which men mean by the name of God75: and all this without thought of their fortune; the solicitude whereof, both inclines to fear, and hinders them from the search of the causes of other things; and thereby gives occasion of feigning of as many gods, as there be men that feign them76. 73. Curiosity evidently leads one to acknowledge what was antecedently true, namely, the existence of «one God», the first mover. In the Latin text, «acknowledgement» is ren- dered as « agnitio»; OL III, 86. 74. Hobbes allows for pagan philosophers' possession of knowledge of God as first cause, as developed for example in book ten of Plato's The Laws. In the Appendix to the Latin Leviathan , §109, Hobbes says of Plato, Aristotle, Zeno and Epicurus that they were «truly philosophers according to the understanding of the pagans», that is, «men devoted to truth and virtue». Here in Hobbes, we glimpse the figure of the virtuous pagan, developed in Christian thought, as in the patristic idea that classical thought anticipated Christian rev- elation as well as in Dante's placement of the ancient philosophers in limbo. 75. The point here is evidently that*, whatever they call Him, men rightly intend the con- cept, God as first mover. On the naming of God, cf. Aquinas' statement, Summa Theolo- giae , 1.13.10: Reply to Objection 5: Neither a Catholic nor a pagan knows the very nature of God as it is in itself; but each one knows it according to some idea of causality, or ex- cellence, or remotion. So a pagan can take this name «God» in the same way when he says an idol is God, as the Catholic does in saying an idol is not God. But if any- ońe should be quite ignorant of God altogether, he could not even name Him, un- less, perhaps, as we use names the meaning of which we know not. 76. The Latin text may be helpful in deciphering the last lines of this quotation: ...atque hoc sine omni fortunarum suarum cogitatione, quarum (seil, fortunarum) sollicitudo et metum gignit et ab inquisitione causarum naturalium animum avertit, simulque Deorum fingendorum occasionem praebet, quot sunt fere qui eos fingunt; OL, III, 86.</page><page sequence="25">Authority and Theodicy in Hobbes's Leviathan 199 We may now distinguish true religion both from superstition, with its corollary concept, idolatry, and also from atheism. Superstition is belief in a false god, based upon the natural human impulse to worship, stemming from fear and hope of gain. Atheism is the false belief that there is no divine sover- eign as first cause. Superstition, we have seen, expresses itself in the manifold deities and practices which humans have invented to assuage their fears at their own ignorance, weakness and impotence in the face of nature. Atheism is the result of the miscarried application of reason to the question of the mean- ing of existence. Both the idolater and the atheist are wrong, though in differ- ent ways. The superstitious person is right to feel the need to worship but wrong in the object of his worship, namely, a non-existent god, and this is why he is an idolater, namely, because he worships non-existent beings77. The athe- ist has not proceeded from fear and has taken thought but has ended in a faulty conclusion, one contrary to reason, namely, that God does not exist. For, rea- son discovers, as we have seen, that God exists as first cause. Thus, just as warranted fear of God as first cause may be distinguished from irrational fear and its expression in superstitious idolatry, so may it be distinguished from atheism, that is, the considered denial of God's existence. This was a point em- phasized by Hobbes in his defense against Bishop Bramhall in their extended exchange. Bramhall had challenged Hobbes on the status of the atheist: Bramhall: [Hobbes] proceedeth further, that atheism itself, though it be an erroneous opinion, and therefore a sin, yet it ought to be numbered among the sins of imprudence or ignorance. He addeth, that an atheist is punished not as a subject is punished by his king, because he did not observe laws: but as an enemy, by an enemy, because he would not accept laws. His reason is, because the atheist never submitted his will tó the will of God, whom he never thought to be. And he concludeth that man's obliga- tion to obey God proceedeth from his weakness, (De cive , xv. 7: vol. II. p. 336): Man- ifestum est obligationem ad prestandam ipsi (Deo) obedientiam, incumbere hominibus propter imbecilitatem. First, it is impossible that should be a sin of mere ignorance or imprudence, which is directly contrary to the light of natural reason. The laws of nature need no new pro- mulgation, being imprinted naturally by God in the heart of man. The law of nature was written in our hearts by the finger of God, without our assent; or rather, the law of nature is the assent itself. Then if nature dictate to us that there is a God, and that this God is to be worshipped in such and such a manner, it is not possible that atheism should be a sin of mere ignorance. Instead, according to Hobbes, having considered the question of God's ex- 77. This is how Paul sets the matter out in 1 Corinthians 8, in discussing whether the new Christians could eat meat sacrificed to idols: 4We know that an idol is nothing at all in the world and that there is no God but one. 5 For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as indeed there are many «gods» and many «lords»), 6 yet for us there is but one God, the Fa- ther, from whom all things came and for whom we live; and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things came and through whom we live.</page><page sequence="26">200 George Wright istence, through an error in reasoning, the atheist is led to a faulty conclusion, namely, the non-existence of God, contrary to the dictates of reason, which shows that God exists as first cause, and this error is why he is a fool and less rational than even the superstitious idolater: Hobbes: [...] Fear of invisible powers, what is it else in savage people, but the fear of somewhat they think a God? What invisible power does the reason of a savage man suggest unto him, but those phantasms of his sleep, or his distemper, which we fre- quently call ghosts, and the savages thought gods; so that the fear of a God, though not of the true one, to them was the beginning of religion, as the fear of the true God was the beginning of wisdom to the Jews and Christians78? Ignorance of second causes made men fly to some first cause, the fear of which bred devotion and worship. The ig- norance of what that power might do, made them observe the order of what he had done; that they might guess by the like order, what he was to do another time. This was their prognostication79 [...] I said superstition was fear without reason. Is not the fear of a false God, or fancied demon, contrary to right reason? And is not atheism bold- ness grounded on false reasoning, such as is this, the wicked prosper, therefore there is no God? [Bramhall] offers no proof against any of this; but says only I make atheism to be more reasonable than superstition; which is not true: for I deny that there is any reason either in the atheist or in the superstitious. And because the atheist thinks he has reason, where he has none, I think him the more irrational of the two [...] In that I say atheism is a sin of ignorance, he says I excuse it. The prophet David says, the fool hath said in his heart, there is no God. Is it not then a sin of folly? It is agreed between us, that right reason dictates, there is a God. Does it not follow, that denying of God is a sin proceeding from misreasoning? There is thus a well developed theory of natural theology in Hobbes's ac- count, which implicates both his psychology, through the concept of curiosity as the «lust of the mind», and his anthropology, through an understanding of what we might term the religious a priori 80, though it remains for another time to link it to his theory of political obligation. Clearly, he is the inheritor of a long tradition, both classical and Judaeo-Christian, which drew the spheres of reason and religion together rather more closely than some do today, though he is concerned not to arrogate to reason what remains mysterious in religion81: Leviathan 3.32.2.409: For though there be many things in God's word above reason; that is to say, which cannot by natural reason be either demonstrated, or confuted; yet 78. The fear which is the beginning of wisdom ( Proverbs 1:7) may be the conception of God as creator of all things, contained in the doctrine of creation announced in Genesis and the presupposition of all biblical theology. This may mark a change from the doctrine taught in the English Leviathan regarding what we may know about creation; see above, note 56. Determining whether it is or not must await, in my view, a more fully developed understanding of Hobbes's theological development. 79. Hobbes is evidently referring to such ancient practices as consulting oracles, wear- ing amulets, casting horoscopes and the taking of the auspices. 80. Cf. William Alexander Johnson, On Religion : A Study of the Theological Method in Schleiermacher and Nygren (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1964). 81. See below, p. 201.</page><page sequence="27">Authority and Theodicy in Hobbes's Leviathan 201 there is nothing contrary to it; but when it seemeth so, the fault is either in our unskil- ful interpretation, or erroneous ratiocination. Fear of God as first cause is the basis of the rational worship which Hobbes prescribes in the 31st chapter of Leviathan 82, and, because he is discussing the kingdom of God by nature and not by revelation, his prescriptions are valid for all forms of divine worship, whatever one's religion, Christian, Jewish, pagan, etc. Clearly, given the social dislocations that, he felt, had caused the Civil War, the attempt to prescribe forms of worship and belief which could restrain sectarian violence lay very close to his interests as a theorist; whatever its suc- cess, his description of rational forms of worship and confession is intrinsic to his theoretical project. The transition of chapter 31 is thus key; it is the pivot of the book. This is not because the first part deals with reason and the second part does not, though, even on this ground, the chapter proceeds only in the light of «natural reason», as we have seen Hobbes emphasize. Reason plays a very important role throughout Leviathan , not least in its revealed religious elements, as he states it should: Leviathan 3.32.2.409: Nevertheless, we are not to renounce our senses, and experi- ence; nor (that which is the undoubted word of God) our natural reason. For they are the talents which he hath put into our hands to negotiate, till the coming again of our blessed Saviour; and therefore not to be folded up in the napkin of an implicit faith83, but employed in the purchase of justice, peace, and true religion. For though there be many things in God's word above reason; that is to say, which cannot by natural rea- son be either demonstrated, or confuted; yet there is nothing contrary to it; but when it seemeth so, the fault is either in our unskilful interpretation, or erroneous ratiocination. In addition, the textual analysis of the Bible that Hobbes pursues in 82. Leviathan 2.31.1.395: That the condition of mere nature, that is to say, of absolute liberty, such as is theirs, that neither are sovereigns, nor subjects, is anarchy, and the condition of war: that the precepts, by which men are guided to avoid that condition, are the laws of nature: that a commonwealth, without sovereign power, is but a word, without sub- stance, and cannot stand: that subjects owe to sovereigns, simple obedience, in all things, wherein their obedience is not repugnant to the laws of God, I have suffi- ciently proved, in that which I have already written. There wants only, for the entire knowledge of civil duty, to know what are those laws of God. For without that, a man knows not, when he is commanded any thing by the civil power, whether it be contrary to the law of God, or not: and so, either by too much civil obedience, of- fends the Divine Majesty, or through fear of offending God, transgresses the com- mandments of the commonwealth. To avoid both these rocks, it is necessary to know what are the laws divine. And seeing the knowledge of all law, dependeth on the knowledge of the sovereign power; I shall say something in that which fol- lowed, of the KINGDOM OF GOD. 83. A reference to the servant in the parable of the talents who unproductively laid up his master's money in a napkin; see Luke 19 and Matthew 25. Hobbes puns on "implicit" in that the Latin implicare means to fold up.</page><page sequence="28">202 George Wright Leviathan should be seen as fundamental to its larger project as well as an im- portant contribution to modern biblical studies84. Few of Spinoza's insights into scripture, for which he is so noted, are not stated or implied by Hobbes. And, the attempt to develop rational criteria and methods and a reasoned ap- proach to theological discourse has been cited as a contribution to the reasoned tone of 17th-century theological discussion85, though, of course, his own sub- stantive theological treatments, such as his doctrine of the Trinity, were round- ly and vociferously rejected86. If we take his assertion that scripture is the source of doctrine together with his insistence upon the utility of reason in coming to know, if not understand, doctrine, then a summary of Hobbes's po- sition is that the Bible is the source of the Christian faith, with reason its neg- ative criterion. God as first cause and as author God as first cause must be distinguished from God as author, just as reason and nature must be distinguished from faith and grace or God's natural king- dom, so to speak, from his prophetic kingdom. Precisely, this distinction be- tween God as first cause and God as author is the ground of Hobbes's theodi- cy, as a brief survey of citations from early and late points in his writings shows. In his long exchange with Bishop Bramhall, beginning in Paris in or soon after 1645, Hobbes was led to exculpate God as the author of sin, allowing nevertheless that He was its cause. In their exchange, the bishop exclaims how he hates Hobbes's identification of causal necessity with the familiar «divine decree» of natural theology87. 84. On this point, see generally Klaus Scholder, The Birth of Modern Critical Theology : Origins and Problems of Biblical Criticism in the Seventeenth Century trans, by John Bow- den (Philadelphia: Trinity Press International, 1990), and, more particularly, Henning Graf Reventlow, The Authority of the Bible and the Rise of the Modern World trans, by John Bowden (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985), pp.l94ff.: «So, if Hobbes towers above the circle of his intellectual contemporaries as an original thinker, and his efforts toward strict rational consistency have produced an impressive system providing a basis for sovereignty over the state and the state church, in his intrinsic presuppositions and his religious atti- tudes, which are also the basis of his entire thought, he is completely a child of his time»; at pp. 22 Iff. 85. See Samuel Mintz, The Hunting of " Leviathan " (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1962), passim. 86. Bramhall describes him as «blind Bayard», the horse whose impetuosity led to a reputation for foolhardiness; see Answer to Bramhall EW IV, 315: «Who is so bold as blind Bayard?

See the discussion in Of Liberty and Necessity , EW 4.</page><page sequence="29">Authority and Theodicy in Hobbes's Leviathan 203 Attempting a coordination of natural science and theology, Hobbes de- scribes every outcome in the natural world, including every human action, as a confluence of causal chains producing the given effect and at the same time unified immutably in the will of God as first cause: That which I say necessitateth and determineth every action (that [Bramhall] may no longer doubt of my meaning), is the sum of all those things, which now being existent, conduce and concur to the production of that action hereafter, whereof if any one thing now were wanting, the effect could not be produced. This concourse of causes, whe- reof every one is determined to be of such as it is by a like concourse of former causes, may well be called (in respect they were all set and ordered the eternal cause of all things, God Almighty) the decree of God. The bishop objects that his determinism renders both humans the passive objects of mechanical actions and God the cause of sin. Hobbes is forced to address a familiar dilemma: is there no sin in the world, or is God its cause? He answers: [T]hough God be the cause of all motion and of all actions, and therefore unless sin be no motion or action, it must derive a necessity from the first mover; nevertheless it cannot be said that God is the author of sin, because not he that necessitateth an action, but he that doth command and warrant it, is the author. The distinction between cause and author would reappear throughout Hobbes's works88. Then, approaching the close of his long life, in the 1668 Latin Leviathan , Hobbes showed that he was unconvinced by critics who had argued that, in describing God as the cause of all things, he made God the au- thor of sin. He crowed over his own skill as he took an accustomed jab at the scholastics: Itaque Scholastici, ubi videri voluerunt subtilissimi, ibi hebetudinem indicarunt maxi- me. Si subtiles fuissent, differentiam inter causam facti et authorem facile invenissent. Auetor facti is est, qui fieri jubet; causa est is per cujus vires factum est. (And so, just at the point where the scholastics wanted to seem most subtle, they most showed their dullness. If they had been sharp thinkers, they would easily have found the distinction between the cause of something that is done and its author. The author of that which is done is he who orders that it be done; the cause is he [sic] through whose powers it is done). The distinction between God as first cause and God as author clarifies Hobbes's quarrel with medieval natural theology and natural-law theory, which, he evidently felt, had too closely identified the biblical God of faith with concepts drawn from the philosophy of the ancients89. His approach in- 88. On theodicy in Hobbes, see Sergio Landucci, "La Potenza e la Giustizia di Dio," La Teodicea nell'Età Cartesiana (Naples: Bibliopolis, 1986), pp. 99-126. 89. This is a common Protestant argumentative trope. For a discussion of God as the cause of things, see Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae 1.2.3. and 1.19.4.</page><page sequence="30">204 George Wright stead is to relate natural and revealed theology by means of several distinc- tions, one of which expresses itself in his theodicy as that between God as first cause and God as author. To conclude, if it is the case that the civil worship of the political sovereign is properly that of the 0T1xeę to their master, then knowledge of God as first cause is the basis of the divine worship of the slave of God. This attitude of fear before that which reason discovers as first cause is what distinguishes true religion and the rational worship owed the divine sovereign from superstition and the irrational invention and propitiation of gods caused by our ignorance of the true cause(s) of things. Yet a third factor, largely unexamined here, namely, revelation, determines an attitude of worship that is based neither solely on fear nor on reason but on confidence in the scriptural witness of the miraculous events in the life of the Christ90. Finally, it is difficult to resist the conclusion that Hobbes has transposed concepts deriving from one people's experience for use in explicating another people's experience. The Hebrew God, whom one is proud to serve «freely» in life-long devotion, assumes the guise of the Greek slave-owner. The moderate slavery idealized among Israelites is exchanged for the deracinated slavery of the Greeks. But, Hobbes is not consciously transposing contexts, it seems to me. He sees these matters with two eyes, one of reason, the other of faith, as Karl Löwith once said91, and, because of this, his sight is dimmer than that of either his Greek or Christian forebears. 90. Confidence (or faith, which is an equivalent term here) in the reports of witnesses (napxúpeç, martyres) of the events of salvation history, as recorded in the scriptures, distin- guishes the Christian faith from pagan belief: Leviathan 4.45.24.672: The Gentiles worshipped for gods, Jupiter and others; that living, were men perhaps that had done great and glorious acts; and for the children of God, divers men and women, supposing them gotten between an immortal deity, and a mortal man. This was idolatry, because they made them so to themselves, having no authority from God, neither in his eternal law of reason, nor in his posi- tive and revealed will. But though our Saviour was a man, whom we also believe to be God immortal, and the Son of God, yet this is no idolatry; because we build not that belief upon our own faticy, or judgment, but upon the Word of God revealed in the Scriptures. Note Hobbes* s awareness of the teaching of Euhemerus (fl. c.300 B.C., Cyrenaic philosopher, b. Sicily). 91. See Karl Löwith, Meaning in History : The Theological Implications of the Philoso- phy of History (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1962), p. 206: The modern mind is not single-minded; it eliminates from its progressive outlook the Christian implication of creation and consummation, while it assimilates from the ancient world view the idea of an endless and continuous movement, discarding its circular structure. The modern mind has not made up its mind whether it should be Christian or pagan. It sees with one eye of faith and one of reason. Hence its vi- sion is necessarily dim in comparison with either Greek or biblical thinking.
