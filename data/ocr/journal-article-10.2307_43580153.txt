Paz García-Bellido The denarii struck by M. Plaetorius Cestianus at Rome in the 60s B.C. have a rich but difficult iconography. The problems already defined by Mommsen still await resolution.1 While scholars have inter- preted each type as a different Italic or Roman divinity without any inter-relationship,2 it is arguable that the two issues are closely connected and both dedicated to Tanit as Dea Caelestis as well as to the rest of the Maximal Triad of the African gods - Ba'al-Hammon and Eshmun - represented under the Roman interpretatio as Jupiter and Aesculapius. The coinage of M. Metellus Imp., struck in Africa twenty years later (47-46 B.C., RRC 459-61) and focused on African themes, provides a good parallel and thus an aid to understanding of the issue of Plaeto- 1 M. H.

A recent Italian hoard shows that the issues were minted in a different order and with a longer interval between them, RRC 409 in 69 B.C. and RRC 405 in 64, with Plaetorius "acting as a pro-praetor perhaps, rather than as regular money er," C.

Paz García-Bellido rius.3 The coins of Metellus bear an archaic representation of Jupiter (Plate 4, 1-2) who is identified by the eagle and scepter in Plate 4, 1. The reverses display a sella curulis, symbolic of his power as imperator, and, in the case of Plate 4, 2, an elephant, which simultaneously repre- sents the Metelli and Africa. Why Jupiter in an African mint? In the Punic world Ba'al-Hammon was the Deus Maximus, identi Tin I with Saturnus, as is shown by the expanded cult which the Saturnus later received.4 In Italy, however, Ba'al, as Deus Maximus, was identified with Jupiter, as is shown by the treaty between Hannibal and Philip of Macedón (Pol. 7.9. 2-3).5 Latin inscriptions show that even in Africa Jupiter was sometimes assimilated to Ba'al-Hammon.6 On one coin (Plate 4, 3) a female goddess is portrayed wearing a corona muralis with grain stalk and caduceus at each side; above there is a rudder (?), below, a prow. As will be seen later, she is the same goddess that appears on African stelai (Plate 4, 4). On the other (Plate 4, 5) a female divinity with lion's head surmounted by a disk, a moon, and dressed with wings is shown holding an ankh.7 The letters G T A identify her as the genius terrae Africae. The reverses of both coins have war and victory themes: trophy with caetra (a small round shield) and bow (a weapon rare on Roman trophies), and the sacral implements simpulum and jug. A figure of Victory holds caduceus and caetra8 in 3 The symbols are particularly important for understanding the meaning of the types. Originally the Semitic religions were aniconic and employed a symbolic language. When anthropomorphic iconography was later adopted the symbols were not replaced, but began to appear beside the types. RRC, p. 738, 459-61, Crawford assembles the earlier bibliographical references, and explains the symbols allegori- cally without any reference to the principal type. Here, as in the Plaetorius issues, the symbols are closely related to the coin type. 4 M. Leglay, Saturne Africain, histoire et monuments , 3 vols. ( I *:i ris, 1966). 6 See M. J.

The caduceus is a symbol which often accompanies deities of the Punic world on coins and stelai from the fifth century B.C. to the second A.D. Its meaning is not yet clear, but it accompanies the high divinities such as Ba'al-Hammon, Tanit, Melkart, Eshmun, and others.9 We shall find it as a single sacral type in the Plaetorius issue (Plate 4, 6 and 7). A head of Africa wears an elephant's skin in Plate 4, 8, and is accom- panied by a grain stalk (as in Plate 4, 3) and a plow, which represent her as protector of earth and fertility. These three types allude to the attri- butes of the Dea Maxima of Carthage, Tanit, the later Roman Dea Caelestis. As Genius of Africa10 she wears the lion's head or skin that Tanit11 wore from early Punic times to later Roman ones, as seen in the sculpture of the Bardo Museum, or in those of Tinissut, where the goddess either stands on a lion with the inscription CAS (Caelestis Augustae Sacrum) or has a lion's head and is dressed with wings (see below).12 In Plate 4, 3, she is the Tyche of Carthage, with a city crown similar to that worn by other hellenistic Tychai - although Tanit had this crown earlier13 - with rudder and prow as protector of a maritime city, with grain stalk as frugifera, and with caduceus as a principal 9 See B.

Charles Picard, Religions d'Afrique antiques (Paris, 1954), p. 84. The assimiliation of Astarte, Tanit, and Genius of Africa is a very problematic question; I think they are fundamentally the same, becoming differ- entiated only in Roman times.

M. Leglay (above, n. 4) Monuments, vol. 1, p. 350, n. 3, has a rich compilation of sources on the lion motif. 13 See the famous silver headband from Batna, Algeria, where she appears with city crown beside Baal-Ammon with ram horns: M.

In many hellenistic cities the principal goddess became the gad or "tutelary genius." In Palmyra it was Atarga tis, and in Ebusus the inscription KAI 72 calls the gad Tanit, that is to say Tyche.

These attributes have already been observed on stelai, Plate 4, 4.14 Both coins have on their reverses victory themes alluding to another facet of the same divinity, the war and peace power of Tanit who inherited from Astarte the attributes of a war goddess. Her weapons are the bow, the caetra, and the spear (Plate 4, 3, 5, and 9). 15 There is inscriptional evidence for these attributes of Dea Caelestis in Italy, CIL 6.78 (invicta) and 6.756 (victrix), with this last appellation also in Spain and Africa,16 and as Dea Virtutis in Britain, CIL 7.759. The same interpretation applies to the representations of Victoria tropaeophora in the terracottas of Saint Monique, in sculptures of Carthage, and probably in the bronze group of Tortose.17 These attri- butes are also attested by African inscriptions recording the dedication to Caelestis of pectorals, CIL 8.12454 and 12501, and bows, CIL 8.16417 and 27416. Such military attributes are combined with those appropriate to a fertility goddess such as Tanit in land, sea, and sky - plow, dolphin, birds, and cornucopiae. In Spain too, issues from Baetica represent a helmeted goddess with weapons as well as grain stalks, fish, or ivy leaves, displaying the same duality as in the issues of Metellus and Plaetorius.18 The female head in Plate 4, 8, is the Roman version of provincia Africa with attributes of Tanit and dressed in an elephant's skin. The image on the reverse is Melkart, who had great popularity in Carthage because of his position as Ba'al in Tyre. He is closely related to Astarte, 14 S. Moscati, I Fenici e Cartagine (Torino, 1972), p. 279, reproduced here. 18 In the Punic sanctuary El-Hofra, a stele is decorated with a drawn bow inscribed into the "Tanit sign" holding a caduceus, pl. 43, B. Caetra and spears are represented also on stelai from the same sanctuary: A. Berthier and R. Charlier, Le sanctuaire punique d'El-Hofra, 2 vols. (Paris, 1955), pl. 18, A, B, C, D, and pp. 193-96.

Plaetorius Cestianus 41 and it has even been suggested that there was a hieros gamos between them.19 In the issue of Metellus struck in Africa we have seen representations of the principal Carthaginian religious figures in different versions; this is also found in the issues of Plaetorius who, however, is more insistent on the attributes of Caelestis and alludes only secondarily to Ba'al- Jupiter and to Eshmun-Aesculapius. The first two types (Plate 4, 10- 11) correspond to Plaetorius's issue as curule aedile and include the two more important civic facets of the goddess; the other five types in the later issue detail her other attributes. The female head with corona muralis, lion's skin on shoulders, and moon under her chin (Plate 4, 10) combines the two images of Metellus (Plate 4, 3 and 5). The moon represents Caelestis, the crown Tyche, and the lion Genius Africae: together they show that a single goddess had all three attributes. The figure portrayed in Plate 4, 11, winged and helmeted with laurel crown terminating in grain stalks or poppy heads and with cornucopia, quiver, and bow, has variously been described as Vacuna, Minerva, Victoria, Diana, Isis, and Apollo;20 she is to be seen as a single goddess. All these elements appeared in the iconography of Metellus and fit perfectly well with the attributes of Tanit: a helmeted war goddess fighting with bow, a winged Victory crowned with laurel, and a fertility goddess with grain stalks and cornucopiae. Caelestis was invoked not only as Victrix, Invictrix, and Virtus, as we have seen, but also as Nutrix, Specifera, and Ops.21 Thus the obverses of Plate 4, 10-11, refer to the same deity as the two faces of Metellus's issue (Plate 4, 3 and 5). The identification as a single goddess is confirmed by coins of Oea (Tripolitania) of the first century B.C. (Plate 4, 12) where a goddess wears both helmet and corona muralis and others of the same issue where she is accompanied by bow, quiver, caetra, and spears (Plate 4, 9) that permit her identification as the Dea Virtutis of African inscrip- 19 M.

In CIL 8.2670 she is also mentioned: Saturnus dominus et Ops regina.</page><page sequence="6">42 M. Paz García-Bellido tions, as Tanit.22 The reverse of Plate 4, 11, eagle on thunderbolt, alludes to Jupiter, that is to say to Ba'al-Hammon. Obverses 13 and 6 once again represent a young female with hair in bands and an object which Babelon and Sydenham interpreted as a crescent but could just as well be a horn. The goddess also has the poppy heads, a symbol of fertility already observed in Plate 4, 11. The reverse of Plate 4, 13, bears a torch and a jug. The torch was a sacrum used not only in the cult of Ceres but in the rituals of the Mater Deorum. We know from St. Augustine that in Carthage, in his youth, festivals of the goddess were celebrated with torches and candles. The iconograpy is very old, and can be observed in a fourth century relief from Athens, Fig. I.23 The Greek Mater Deorum, who later came to Rome assimilated with Cybele, sits on a throne of lions accompanied by cymbals; representation of her votaries imply that essential elements of her cult included torch and jug. Caelestis was the Carthaginian Mater Deorum or Dea Magna as she is called in African inscriptions, Dea Magna Virgo Caelestis. The horns in the hair of the female on the obverses are probably to be explained by Taniťs role as paredros of Ba'al-Hammon, identified in many ways with Ba'al-Ammon.24 Hammon assumed the characteristic ram's horns of the Egyptian god and appears with them in the head- band of Algeria, beside the mural-crowned head of Tanit.26 The reverse attributes of this coin allude, as we saw, to Dea Magna, and its obverse is her representation wearing the horns as paredros of Jupiter- Ammon. The coins of the African issue of Q. Cornifici as augur imperator have as their types Jupiter-Ammon, head of Africa, and Tanit.26 This was, then, a common African depiction for the Romans, which may be related to the fact that Caelestis and Saturnus typically received rams as sacrifices from the third century B.C. at least.27 22 L.

The same type appears on the reverse of Plate 4, 7, referring to the young male head on the obverse. This been interpreted as Bonus Eventus even though, as Babe- Ion realized, there are iconographie inconsistencies.28 Perhaps this is Aesculapius, a god so closely related to Caelestis as to share the same priests - compare the sacerdos publicus deae Caelestis et Aesculapii of CIL 8.16417 or the sacerdos publicus Aesculapii et Iunonis of 1887.

He was considered the son of Tanit, and like her he may have had the caduceus as a badge.29 A female head with winged Stephane is represented in Plate 4, 14. It is well known that Tanit was often dressed with wings, as on the famous sarcophagus of the Lavigerie Museum or in the numerous terracottas from La Cueva d'Es Cuyram in Ebusus, where Tanit is enfolded by two wings. In both cases the wings have been related to Taniťs power in the underworld; in Plate 4, 15, and Fig. 230 she presides on Carthaginian funerary stelai. The reverse is invariably interpreted as the pediment of a temple, most often that of Jupiter;31 but this would be the first abbreviation of a temple to a pediment, eliminating the stylobate, in all of Roman coinage. Pediments were not exclusive to temples, but were used in many sacred or civil buildings: fountains, porticoes, propy- laea, and sarcophagi. But the most decisive consideration in ruling out this image as the representation of a temple is the name of Plaetorius inscribed where there should be a dedication to a god (or, later, a divine emperor). The image in the pediment is an anguipede figure holding an uncertain object, perhaps better interpreted as a club than as a cornu- copia. Both Curtius and, later, Fuchs have identified the anguipede with Typhon and thus the so-called temple as that of Jupiter; but as they noticed, Typhon also has associations with the underworld and is frequently represented in graves.32 The anguipede can also represent Scylla, a common funerary motif found in such objects as combs, terra- cottas, razors, and the pediments of Punic sarcophagi (Plate 5, 16)33 in both Sicily and Carthage. The sarcophagi found in Carthage are described by Gsell, and one can do no better than quote him: On a recueilli dans le cimitière de Saint Monique un certain nombre de sarcofages en marbre. Ils datent, pour la plupart, 29 In spite of the caduceus it is clear that he is not Mercury. 80 A. M. Bisi, Le stele puniche (Rome, 1967), fig. 44, of the third century B.C., reproduced here.

Les uns sont des monuments d'architecture, non de sculpture. Ils ont l'aspect d'un temple grec. Le couvercle imite un toit à double pente, avec les frontons aux deux extré- mités et des saillies (acrotères) aux angles et long des grandes cotés. La cuve est bordé, en haut et en bas, de moulures, rehaussés d'ornements peints, oves et fers de lance, meandres.

Thus both faces of the coin refer to the underworld power of the goddess Tanit, inherited by Dea Caelestis as can be deduced from the many funerary dedications in Latin inscriptions. There is total congruence between the obverse and reverse types, one explaining the other. There remains one issue, Plate 5, 17, in which a female head tells little of her personality but the reverse depicts a boy holding a tablet inscribed SORS. The figure is clearly an oracular divinity identified with Fortuna, but which Fortuna ?35 Some parallels for this scene can be found in other Phoenician cults, as in the relief from the Hercules sanctuary in Ostia (Plate 5, 18).36 In the central scene Hercules himself draws out a tablet inscribed S H (Sors Herculis) from a cista and hands it to a boy who has the same role as the boy on the coin of Plaetorius, that is to read the oracle's answer. On the right of the relief we are told that Hercules' cult and his cista came from abroad, over the sea. The two sacra, image and cista, are fished out in a net and brought to the 34 S.

Paz García-Bellido shore by fishermen; in fact we now know that the Hercules cult in Ostia was Phoenician in origin and came from Tyre. Oracles by sortes also existed in the Tyrian sanctuary of Melqart in Gades. Some coins from Lascuta (a "Libyophoenician" city of Baetica), Plate 5, 19-20, represent Hercules on the obverse and two altars, perhaps the very two mentioned in several classical texts, on the reverse.37 At the sides there are a cista similar to that of Ostia and a jug, and it is possible that these were the sacra which played the prin- cipal role in the famous oracle of Gades. The cista next to an altar is anomalous in a classical ambience, but not in a Phoenician or Punic one: in fact the same cista and jug are found in many stelai dedicated to Tanit in Carthage (Plate 5, 21-22). 38 Elsewhere I have tried to demon- strate that these cistai should be interpreted as the receptacles for the sortes used in the oracle of Tanit at Carthage, whose power was inher- ited by Caelestis as found in many literary texts and inscriptions.39 In Roman Carthage her oracle played an important political role.40 New data now seem to confirm this hypothesis. At Sidon, in the sanctuary of Eshmun, thirteen cistae ansatae have appeared in a section dedicated to Astarte (she and Eshmun are once again seen as companions), with no obvious explanation.41 In my view these cistae are the containers of sortes for the oracle of Astarte, this method of prophecy being the usual one in Phoenician cults and many different receptacles were used to correspond to the different nature of the questions put. I suggest, then, that the figure on coin 17 can be interpreted as Fortuna Caelestis, as she is called in CIL 8.6943 and 12.7610. Even in Rome Caelestis played this role, as in CIL 6.77: dominae caelesti...numinae eius. It is difficult to explain this iconography for the issues of Plaetorius. All scholars agree that Plaetorius, as curule aedile (Plate 4, 6-7), had 37 Phil. A p. 5.5; Sil. It. 3.14.

Dei 2.41; Tert., Apol. 12) and inscriptions ( CIL 10.1596, where a taurobolium Veneris Caelestae is offered) show, Caelestis was not clearly differentiated from Cybele; and modern commentators, including Wissowa, Roscher, Latte, and D'Esurac, admit that Caelestis and Cybele had the same attributes.43 Both represent the city's founder, Virtus, Pax, Ceres, both have lions as companions, and both are Mater deorum - the last of these being the reason for the quick assimilation. In her aspect as Mater deorum Caelestis was associated with the Cybele cult, and their feast was perhaps celebrated together in the Ludi Megalenses for which Plaetorius had responsibility.44 In this case the coins provide one of the oldest testimonies of her cult in Rome. If the cult of Caelestis came to Rome during the Republic, why the long silence about it? The answer may be inherent in the process of syncretism. Caelestis arrived at Rome as a Carthaginian Mater deorum coinciding in many of her aspects with Cybele, who was already settled in Rome. As the issues of Plaetorius and, perhaps, the earlier issue of 42 The fact that the issues were minted in diffent periods makes no difference. Plaetorius could have later returned to the same cult theme. If we recognize a familial remembrance in this iconography, it is still less problematic. 48 G.

Pavis d'Escurac agrees that both have the same attributes, but he thinks that in Africa they were clearly differentiated in the dedications, "La Magna Mater en Afrique," Bulletin d'archéologie algérienne 6 (1980), especially pp. 228-33. 44 It is also possible that Plaetorius, whose family history is all but unknown to us, was connected with Africa, where the Marian faction played an important role (see RE Plaetorius [16]; his father, Plaetorius [11], was killed in the struggle between Marius and Sulla). An even earlier connection of the family with Africa would explain the African iconography chosen by L. Cestius, perhaps of the original branch of the Plaetorii Cestiani, in 43 B.C. for his own coinage at Rome. Note the bust of Africa/curule chair with helmet and ivy leaves, and bust of winged Caelestis/Cybele (Caelestis) on throne. At RRC 491 the ivy leaves are interpreted as snakes1 heads, and the winged Caelestis is described as "Sybilla (?)." See also p. 500.</page><page sequence="12">48 M. Paz García-Bellido Volteius46 show, the Cealestis cult remained differentiated for some time, but was soon subsumed under the rituals of Cybele. One stage in this process can be recognized in the issue of Cestius. In the third century, with the revival of local cults, Caelestis came to Rome, not for the first but for the second time. Septimius Severus brought her icon from Carthage, and a temple was built and festivals organized for her; even a husband was found with the introduction of Sol Invictus from Emesa. The arrival of Caelestis's cult at Rome in the Republican period is thus suggested by the issues of Plaetorius and is confirmed by two important texts which have been disregarded in the absence of any confirming evidence.46 We read in Macrobius (3.9.7) that during the siege of Carthage Scipio offered the advocatio formula to the Punic deities, temple and feasts: si deus, si dea est, cui populus civitasque Carthaginiensis est tutela... vo veo vobis temple ludosque facturum.
