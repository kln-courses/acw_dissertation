<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HALF-WAY COVENANT PERRY MILLER A MONG a vast array of safe assertions, safest of all are wide generalizations concerning the abiding qualities of a nation or a people. While historical principles which seem universally applicable invite de- served suspicion, yet any rule not too good to be true gathers strength by surviving the exceptions which "prove" it. We should have no fears, for instance, that a lack of contradictory testimony will ever com- pel us to abandon our ancient belief that the English are a pragmatic race, with an innate propensity for com- promise and a congenital aversion to clear thinking- that they prefer always to muddle through with mud- dled logic. To this good platitude a host of convenient exceptions clamor for attention, and of these the con- duct of Englishmen in the early and middle seven- teenth century is surely the most gratifying. Up and down the land were men with utopias in their brains and the voice of God in their ears. What- ever else can be said of these worthies, it must be gen- erally agreed that all in their several fashions compre- hended the meaning of "thorough." Puritan and pre- late alike were prepared to make of their ideals a Pro- crustian bed upon which society would be stretched or hacked to fit the predetermined dimensions, and both were sublimely indifferent to what might be the prac- tical consequences. Strafford would make an Anglican satrapy of Catholic Ireland, and Laud would do like- wise with Presbyterian Scotland; the Scotch in turn 676</page><page sequence="2">THE HALF-WAY COVENANT would fasten the solemn league and covenant upon the English, and the Massachusetts-Bay Company would bend the wilderness to a Bible commonwealth. Much of the character of American Puritanism is to be attrib- uted to its having been formulated by Englishmen in a day when too many Englishmen were behaving them- selves in a manner which Britons have usually con- sidered bad form. Of all examples of this un-English a priori-ism, New England Congregationalism is prob- ably the most extreme. It should be added, however, that the most spec- tacular form in which this quality of preconception was manifested in New England was not that which is most often singled out for comment and disparagement. The notion that Biblical ethics should dominate the life of a community was indeed an important item in the New England creed, but it was not the central doctrine, nor was it peculiar to the new world. The fate of such diverse persons as Servetus and Mary Stuart is a re- minder that the notion was not unfamiliar to Geneva and Scotland. But the sanguine colonials went far be- yond this elementary stage and dedicated themselves to an even more rigorous program, which they called Congregationalism. They had accepted Protestant the- ology. Very well then, they would conform their world to that theology. For a century Protestant re- formers had preached regeneration and faith; New Englanders would make regeneration and faith the touchstones of an ecclesiastical and even of a political system. In this spirit they dared to make a deduction which Calvin had explicitly declared was inadmissible,' 1 Ernest Troeltsch, The Social Teaching of the Christian Churches (New York, 193I), I, 598. 677</page><page sequence="3">678 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY they dared to assume that if there was any truth in predestination, then the predestined elect could be dis- tinguished in the flesh from the predestined reprobate. Upon this conclusion they proceeded to act. They turned over the government of the churches to con- gregations made up exclusively of the regenerate. They reasoned, with flawless logic, that saints, being sanctified, needed no supervision of bishops or clas- sical bodies, that the Word of God was for them suffi- cient check upon their portion of human depravity. Up to this time no orthodox Protestants had contemplated putting the principle of salvation by faith into anything like so extensive a practice. Compared with the blithe assurance of the New England divines, Luther and Calvin appear downright skeptics; they would have recoiled in horror at the prospect of giving any groups of human beings, even hand-picked groups of the evi- dently righteous, such breath-taking powers as those of electing their own ministers and enjoying local ecclesi- astical autonomy. The marvel is that this super-logical system actually worked. There were slight modifications, but the essen- tial idea was completely carried out. After overriding antinomianism, expelling Roger Williams, circumvent- ing Dr. Child, and crushing the Quakers, the clergy and magistrates could boast with pardonable pride that in all the world New England alone had succeeded in living up to the Word of God, and at that when the Word had been most exactingly interpreted. And then, at this very moment of satisfaction, events threatened to get out of hand. The ministers confronted what Artemus Ward would have called "a darned uncom-</page><page sequence="4">THE HALF-WAY COVENANT fortable reality" to which it seemed that they had to make concessions, or else the whole system would go to pot. The problem came, as problems generally do, from an unexpected quarter-not from any frontal attack, which they could have withstood, nor from an outburst of heresy, which they had demonstrated they were competent to deal with, but from the simple fact that time moved on and that even the chosen people of God married and had the customary issue. It was their children, and then their children's children, who by doing nothing but allowing themselves to be born constituted a threat to the marvellous perfection of New England Congregationalism. It was not that the original theory had failed to pro- vide for these children. The Bible taught that churches were to consist only of visible saints, of adults who had experienced regeneration, but it also declared, in pas- sages too numerous to mention, that whenever God ex- tended the covenant of grace to His saints, He included their "seed" in the grant. On such authority Congre- gationalists had provided for the baptism of the chil- dren of church-members, and for no other children whatsoever, as a symbol that God had taken them into the covenant. Of course, everybody assumed that these baptized children would grow up to become somehow saints themselves; whereupon their own children could be baptized, and so ad infinitum. Thus, the theory had confidently expected, the churches would be per- petuated through the ages by a continual and unfailing succession of the elect. The fault lay not in a lack of provision or foresight. It was rather that the provision was not of the right 679</page><page sequence="5">680 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY sort, that what was foreseen was precisely what did not happen. Incredible though it might be, there were a vast number of the second generation who were earnest and sober and had immaculate reputations, who sincerely desired to partake of theLord's Supper, but who, try as they might, "could not Jcome up to that experimental account of their own regeneration, which would suffi- ciently embolden their access to the other sacrament."2 And when we reflect that at almost their earliest oppor- tunity, they generally became parents themselves, not once but frequently, we can understand how the prob- lem of an ecclesiastical status for the descendants of the original saints did "come on with some importunity and impetuosity."3 In 1646 the General Court sum- moned a synod to frame a platform of discipline; it had various motives, but the most insistent was a fear that unless the question of baptism were settled, the various apprehensions of the matter then rampant would "begett such differences as will be displeasing to the Lord, offensive to others, and dangerous to our- selves."4 At the Cambridge gathering the subject was warily introduced, discovered to be "difficultly circum- stanced"-which is putting it mildly-and dropped with unanimous alacrity. But within a very few years Puritan fecundity made it impossible to stall any longer. At the suggestion of Connecticut an assembly of divines met at Boston in I657, drew up a statement which at once caused a furor and divided New England into two violently opposed theological camps. In 1662 an 2 Cotton Mather, Magnalia Christi Americana (Hartford, 1855), II, 277. 3 Ibid., 98. 4 Records of Massachusetts, II, 155; III, 70-73.</page><page sequence="6">THE HALF-WAY COVENANT official synod was found necessary, and the conclusions of this body, reached after a stormy session by a ma- jority of about seven to one, were promulgated as the official opinion of the churches. The issue in these gatherings was simplicity itself: "The children of the parents in question, are either children of the covenant, or strangers from the cove- nant.'5 The unregenerate heirs of what Cotton Mather called the "good old generation" had to be frankly kept in the churches or else turned out. On this crucial point the ministers had no mind to compromise, and the simple truth of the matter is that they did not. In spite of the label which their solution has borne ever since, there really was no "half-way." In no uncertain tones the majority responded in the affirmative. Bap- tized children were held to be members, even if unre- generate. This membership was qualified and hedged about, it was distinguished from "full" membership which entitled to communion, but it remained essen- tially membership, and as such gave the baptized mem- bers the right to present their own children for baptism. There is not the slightest obscurity about the motives for this decision. If the constrictive operation of the polity had been permitted to force the posterity of the saints outside the pale, then presently the whole com- munity would be left "at a loose end without the Dis- cipline of Christ, the Means to prevent sin, or to re- duce them to Repentance unto life."6 Since "even the children of the godly" were making a "woful proof," 5 [Jonathan Mitchel], Propositions Concerning the Subject of Baptism and Consociation of Churches. . . .

In- trusions of irreligion and apostasy would be bound to emanate from so large a number ejected beyond the limits of control. "Church-way for the good of these there is none, if they be not under Church-government and Discipline."8 Damned or saved, the children had to be made subject to the watch and ward of the church, or the Bible commonwealth was ruined. To the modern mind motives as good as these might be deemed sufficient, and we may pardonably wonder what all the pother was about. But unhappily the seventeenth-century mind did not work in this fashion. It was not that New Englanders considered the gaining of happiness or the satisfaction of ulterior motives sin- ful; they decidedly approved of getting what one wanted if one could. But in their scheme worldly profit was incidental to serving the will of God. To aim merely at the continued prosperity of the churches would be in their view to put the cart before the horse. A church system had been decreed once and for all in the Bible. To patch up the divine constitution in re- sponse to some mere mechanical urgency was to make "innovation," most heinous of sins and of crimes. Biblical polity did not depend upon sociological con- siderations, but solely upon the immutable decree of God. The New England fathers had known this when, 7 Cotton Mather, Magnalia, I, 413. 8 Richard Mather, A Defence of the Answer and Arguments of the Synod met at Boston in the Year I662 (Cambridge, I664), 18.

The synod could not get away with its doctrine unless it could somehow show that it had enacted "no Apostacy from the first Principles of New England, nor yet any de- clension from the Congregational way,"9 but only "a progress in practising according thereunto, as the en- crease of the Churches doth require."10 If baptized but unregenerate persons were members, then some- body had to prove that the idea had been implicit in the system from its very origins. Nor was this all. New Englanders had a theology as well as a polity. The leaders of Massachusetts and Connecticut had always insisted upon their complete doctrinal concord with the reformed churches of the world. They had accepted without reservation that system of thought which in its main outlines was the creed of English Puritanism and which is generally, though somewhat loosely, spoken of as Calvinism. To prove this the synod at Cambridge in 1648 had enthu- siastically endorsed the Confession of Faith which the Westminster assembly had just published. Heresy was as black a sin as innovation, and the synod of I662 could not issue its Propositions without first reassuring the world that these did no violence to the inherited theology. To generalize about this theology has ever been a dangerous undertaking, and nowadays is certainly a thankless one. Engaging as one may find the laby- 9 Increase Mather, The First Principles of New England, Concerning the Subject of Baptisme And Communion of Churches (Cambridge, 1675), A4, verso. 10 Allin, Animadversions, 5. 683</page><page sequence="9">684 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY rinthine involutions of this creed outworn, inflicting them too heavily upon the reader would be like boring a guest with a favourite cross-word puzzle. But con- sidering the fashion in which the New England in- tellect operated, one must notice certain features of that primitive philosophy in order to trace the history of this movement. A moderately extensive reading of New England authors suggests the thought that the predestinarian aspect of its theology has been rather overemphasized. Popular impressions to the contrary, it is not altogether accurate to declare that New Eng- landers interpreted their creed to require complete passivity of man in the face of an absolute and arbi- trary God. They were not given over irreparably to fatalism and paralysis of the spirit." True, they did conceive the cosmos to be pure determinism, and they did hold that the sole moving force therein was the will of God, a will unfettered by aught but the divine pleasure. True, they did believe that when God saved a man, He did it out of His lofty condescen- sion, "without any fore-sight of Faith or good Works, or perseverance in either of them or any other thing in the Creature, as Conditions or Causes moving him thereunto, and all to the praise of his glorious Grace."'2 So, until a man experienced effectual call- ing, he did dwell in impotency of spirit, prostrate be- fore God, unable either to lift or to wish to lift a finger for his own salvation. To this extent there can be no doubt that Calvinism succeeded in stifling human effort 11 Cf.

Even among the unconverted, New Englanders understood that a certain activity, or at least semblance of activity, could go on; the unregenerate could be offered the "means" of conversion. The Gospel and its ordinances, the ministry and the sacraments, could be held out as an inducement to sinners. The clergy were "Ambassadors" of Christ, and their "great busi- ness is to make the offers of, and invite sinful Men to embrace Reconciliation with God, through Christ."'3 Of course, these sinful men could make no response, logically they could not be supposed even to make sense out of what was preached to them, until the spirit came to their assistance. Until then they might have ears but they would hear not. "The power to discern the excellency of the Truth, and so to approve and embrace it, and to chuse and close with Christ . . must come from a superior agent; because in doeing it, the blind mind must be illuminated, and the rebellious heart sub- dued."'4 But then no one could tell in advance where the superior agent, like lightning, would strike. The only thing to do was continually to stand by, offering the means of conversion to all the unregenerate. Any one of them might suddenly discover himself able to take advantage of his opportunities. None of them could therefore be deprived of a chance. The clergy would sleep ill of nights if they faltered in offering the objective means of grace, not only in spite of, but in the very midst of human inability. 13 Samuel Willard, A Complete Body of Divinity (Boston, 1726), 431. 14 Ibid., 427. 685</page><page sequence="11">686 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY Once the soul became infused with the regenerating spirit, the whole situation was gloriously changed. As soon as the sinner had authentically experienced effec- tual calling, justification, and adoption, he was freed. Then he could, he inevitably would, commence to strive against sin and the flesh. He was no longer a supine recipient of grace; he was a warrior penetrated with the active spirit of Christ. The Westminster Confession, which New England synods endorsed in I648 and in 1680, emphasized again and again that a sinner trans- lated to a state of grace was a man emancipated from natural bondage to sin, who could, albeit imperfectly, will to do good. He had not only a choice but a duty "to give all diligence to make his calling and election sure."15 He was voluntarily to cooperate with the divine spirit in striving for sanctification, saving faith, good works, and true repentance. Best of all, the church could exhort and incite him. As long as natural man could contribute positively nothing to his own sal- vation, so Samuel Willard wrote, then it must be that "a Christians real work begins, when he is Converted."16 Thus we can perceive that the existence of these re- calcitrant children posed a delicate theological problem. Because they could not even in "the judgment of charity" be accounted saints, they had then to be held incapable of spiritual exertions. What could be the use of exhorting them to moral conduct or making them memorize a catechism? Even if they did the things which God had commanded, they would not do them with a heart purified by faith and their deeds would be 15 Walker, Creeds and Platforms, 385. 16 Willard, Complete Body of Divinity, 503.</page><page sequence="12">THE HALF-WAY COVENANT of no avail. Good works done by the unregenerate "cannot please God, nor make a man meet to receive grace from God.""7 But though the church could not undertake to convert the children, there was no im- propriety in its offering them the "means" of conver- sion. A great many of them were expected to be ulti- mately chosen; they had all therefore to be constantly called, and called as loudly as possible. The seed of believers "are successively in their Generations to be trained up for the Kingdome of Heaven," to which "the Elect number shall still be brought in the way of such means."'8 The difficulty was that mere providing of means could not be permitted to become anything more. Opening chances to those who might some day utilize them was one thing, but evangelizing among those who betrayed no signs of a circumcised heart was quite another. The merely baptized could not be treated as though elected nor expected to behave as if regen- erate. The temptation was great to demand regenerate actions from sinners, to transform, unwittingly but none the less sinfully, "means" into goads, opportunities into provocations. If their concern for the future led the clergy to push or entice the baptized into actions to which they knew men could really be aroused only by the divine summons, they would make a ghastly mockery of the Congregational principle of regenerate membership. The majority report in the synod of 1662 has so often been indicted by church historians for being the initiation of precisely such a treason, and that indict- 17 Walker, Creeds and Platforms, 384. 18 Propositions Concerning the Subject of Baptism, A3, recto. 687</page><page sequence="13">688 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY ment has become so much the accepted verdict, that some further explanation is necessary. The principle of regenerate membership presents at least as many difficulties as any other Puritan conception. It was based upon a postulate, upon a belief in the reality of a super-sensual realm in which a converted individual could encounter a definite series of spiritual experiences. In the Congregational plan, before a man became a member of the church militant, he must have had these experiences, he must have become by divine election a member of the church triumphant. This meant that in the inner recesses of his soul there must have been engendered a new life, he must have undergone a sub- jective, incomprehensible, but recognizable transforma- tion. Upon the foundation of this subjective experience was reared the objective church; correlated with the spiritual realm, with the emotional life, was the ec- clesiastical realm, the organized system. The external church was not primarily an evangelical organization to carry the gospel to the heathen, but a brotherhood for the cultivation and intensification of grace in those who already had it. It was designed, as we have just seen, to offer "means" to those who were some day to be con- verted, but its more important function was to direct the already converted towards larger achievements in the way of sanctification, repentance, and saving faith. The greatest of the early prophets of Congregational- ism, William Ames, who was a master among other things of the Aristotelian terminology, defined the "essential" form of the true church to be invisibility, the "accidental" form to be visibility: "the accidental forme is visible, because it is nothing else then an out-</page><page sequence="14">THE HALF-WAY COVENANT ward profession of inward Faith."'9 As Thomas Hooker expressed it with less jargon, "the Covenant of Grace is ever included and presupposed in the Covenant of the Church."20 The organization followed upon the fact that certain persons were predestined to salvation; the ecclesiastical realm assumed the previous occurrence of conversion in the spiritual, and without maintaining that assumption the whole theory of Congregationalism would have collapsed. To make an assumption is easy. To maintain it in the presence of facts is to invite trouble. The trouble here was that this spiritual realm remained a closed book to human comprehension. God alone could know with certainty what happened there. We, poor crea- tures, could merely follow the motions of the spirit from afar, and endeavor to read the language of the spirit as it was translated in the language of sense. Naturally we would make mistakes. Hence Congre- gationalists hovered always upon the verge of an ex- citing predicament: they created an ecclesiastical system based upon the objective reality of election, and at the same time recognized that in practical life it was im- possible to be absolutely certain just who was elected and who was not. They desired the membership of their churches to approximate as closely as possible to the membership of the church invisible. But they could discover no method for guaranteeing that the two realms would be more than remotely identical. So the best they could do was to go upon evidences, to pass 19 William Ames, The Marrow of Sacred Divinity (London, I643), 137-138. 20 A Survey of the Summe of Church Discipline (London, I648), Part II, 24. 689</page><page sequence="15">690 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY no judgment upon the thing-in-itself, but to be con- cerned with its attributes. He who seemed regenerate must for practical purposes be treated as such. The in- dividual was to search for faith within the trackless hinterland of the soul, but it remained his own problem to establish his sincerity. The church wished only to know what evidences justified its accepting the individ- ual into the ecclesiastical realm on the assumption that he had probably already been received into the spiritual. Thus Congregational theorists had progressively rec- ognized that the ecclesiastical realm was based, properly speaking, not upon the terra incognita of actual faith and regeneration, but upon externalities, upon evidences, upon probabilities. Whether we were members of the invisible church, said Hooker, "we for the present doe not know: and its certain, you can neither see, nor know, for truth of grace is invisible to man.""2 We judged on the basis of actions and professions, as best we might, but in the end we called him a Christian who stood up under such fallible tests as we could devise. The Profession is to be judged of by Men who cannot know the Heart, but must judge according to Appearances.... God hath put it into the hands of Men to dispense the Gospel- Ordinances, and hath told them who are the Subjects, and by what Rule they are to determine them, and that is by their Profession, or outward demeanure of themselves.22 The two realms overlapped, but they would always re- main separate and distinct. "There is a twofold Dispen- sation of the Covenant of God in his visible Church," wrote John Allin in reply to President Chauncy; there is the "Inward, Spiritual, and Saving Dispensation of 21 A Survey of the Summe of Church Discipline (London, 1648), Part I, 37. 22 Willard, Complete Body of Divinity, 854.</page><page sequence="16">THE HALF-WAY COVENANT the Covenant to such as truly Believe, and perform the conditions of the Covenant," but quite a different mat- ter is the other dispensation, "Outward and visible, by which the Lord bestows upon his Church, and all the members thereof, the outward Priviledges of the Cov- enant, his Ordinances, and Means of Grace."23 Specific individuals who presented instances either of notorious unregeneracy or of conspicuous holiness caused no confusion between the dispensations. He who in every respect conducted himself as a man of God could safely be supposed truly elect; whereas an equally ob- vious limb of Satan was presumably not among the saved. But by no means were all persons such clear-cut cases of black or white. As time went on, the divines kept finding a surprising number who did not fit readily into either category. Some who were far from vicious were yet not ostensibly regenerate, and many who seemed in some respects to be called were in other re- spects palpably deficient. Worse than that, some who gave the most convincing exhibitions, who made "a more than ordinary profession of religion," came to bad ends, created "prodigious and astonishing scandals."24 It did the bewildered clergy no good to pray to God for an answer to the enigma; no answer was forth- coming, nor could one be expected. God knew His own mind, and He had made no pledge to reveal accurately the secret transactions of the spiritual realm. Congre- gationalists had undertaken a mighty task: they had set out to embody the infinite will of God in a finite church. They had admitted from the beginning that there might be discrepancies, but when these became too 23 Allin, Animadversions, I8-i 9. 24 Cotton Mather, Magnalia, II, 493. 69I</page><page sequence="17">692 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY flagrant, they put on a bold face and determined to save their own consistency in default of their parish- ioners' sincerity. They had aspired to capitalize the hidden energies of conversion, but when they perceived how hidden those energies were, they made shift to be content with evidences. More and more the clergy dodged the responsibility, took refuge in the reflection that the life of the spirit was beyond human ken. It was not their fault if their technique of examination worked injustices or was sometimes inadequate. To make a person a Member of the visible Church, the matter is not whether he hath Faith and Grace really, or not; if he hath such qualification as the Rule of the Word accepteth for Faith in the visible Church, we can go no further.25 It was enough if a man seemed to possess the qualifi- cations; the clergy declared him as good a Christian as any, unless later on he gave overwhelming evidence to the contrary. To say church-members were regenerate, said John Cotton, was to speak of what "they ought to be de jure . . . rather then what they are, or are want to be de facto."26 Evidence, not reality, was the baili- wick of the churches, and their evaluation of evidence was confessedly faulty. Clearly they would frequently admit some who would seem satisfactory but who would be in God's eyes reprobate, who were, in short, hypo- crites. "It is clearer then the day, that many who are inwardly . . . the children of the Devil, are outwardly, or in respect of outward Covenant, the children of God."27 To this anomalous conclusion the fathers of 25 Allin, Animadversions, 25. 26 A Defence of Mr. John Cotton From the Imputation of Selfe Con- tradiction (Oxford, i658), 7I. 27 Thomas Shepard, The Church-Membership of Children and their Right to Baptisme (Cambridge, I663), I-2.</page><page sequence="18">THE HALF-WAY COVENANT New England themselves had come, quite independ- ently of the problem of children. They had already made it a part of the Congregational tradition by 1662. Into the ecclesiastical realm, the fellowship of the evidently righteous, a person could get admitted in one of two ways. The first was to make a personal profes- sion of faith and regeneration before the congregation. Hypocrites could do this, yet it still was the most re- liable method for detecting the elect. Any one who passed this inspection became for official purposes one of the chosen, and therefore was entitled to all the privileges of the church, especially the communion. Hence the Lord's Supper came to be the crucial link between the spiritual and the ecclesiastical realms. Everybody agreed that the sacrament should be con- fined to those who not merely had private assurance of salvation, but who could offer public evidence, who could show "historical faith," blameless lives, and the ability "to examine themselves and to discern the Lords body." The most stalwart advocates of the half-way covenant were as much resolved as their opponents that satisfactory personal confession should be a pre- requisite to partaking of the communion, because that ceremony was instituted, "not for regeneration, but for nourishment and confirmation" of those already regen- erate.28 The second way was baptism. Because the ecclesi- astical realm was not necessarily identical with the spir- itual, God by His arbitrary fiat could, if He so pleased, set up another standard besides visible holiness. As 28 Richard Mather, A Disputation Concerning Church-Members and their Children, in Answer to XXI Questions. . . . (London, 1659), I7. MS. in The American Antiquarian Society, Worcester, Massachusetts. 693</page><page sequence="19">694 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY New Englanders read the Bible, they found that He would permit no heathen to come in before making a profession, but that after an erstwhile heathen became converted He counted that man's children among His flock. There was, possibly, very little rhyme or reason in this entailing of the covenant, but there was no getting around it. So the children were baptized. But of infants nothing could be demanded, not even evi- dences. They became church members solely and simply because God so ordered it, and for no better reason. Presumably He would some day elect them. Appar- ently He desired them in the church, where the means of conversion could be set before them. "Others hear the word, but these in outward Covenant enjoy it by Covenant, and promise; and hence these in the first place, and principally, are sought after by these meanes."9 To most of the children, it was believed, God would not say, "If thow believest thow shalt be saved," but instead, "I will enable to believe;" they would have the means "unless they refuse in resisting the means," and even if they refused, God would probably be especially patient with them: ... he will take away this refuseing heart from among them in- definitely, so that though every one cannot assure himself, that he will do it particularly for this or that person, yet every one, through this promise, may hope and pray for the communica- tion of this grace, and so feel it in time.30 Thus the normal development of the baptized child ought to cause no trouble. At the age of discretion he would discreetly reveal signs of regeneration, be taken into full membership, and seated at the Lord's Supper. 29 Shepard, The Church-Membership of Children, 3-4. 30 Ibid., 5-6.</page><page sequence="20">THE HALF-WAY COVENANT In that case the church would have to regard him as having been chosen in the divine mind from all eter- nity. Had it been able to decipher his destiny at birth, it would have received him into full standing at once. For obvious reasons that had been impossible, but there had been good grounds to presume that he would grow in grace and become saved; therefore he had to be con- sidered as having been a legitimate member of the ecclesiastical realm even in his probationary period. He had made progress in his ability to furnish evidences, but he had not come from non-membership into mem- bership. He had been included within the church covenant at birth by the explicit statement of God and now his inclusion was simply made good. Ergo, the child had been a true member from the very day of his baptism. That much was clear. But any system of education has to reckon with abnormal children. Abnormality was expressed in this case by a growing up without a con- comitant ability to prove regeneration. What should the church do with such intractable youths? How should it account for them? Whom should it blame? The only certainty was that they could not be allowed to approach the communion table, but that still left much to be determined. For example, did every member necessarily have to be a communicant? If so, the chil- dren who did become regenerate had not been members before their conversion. Then where was the point in baptism at all? That way anabaptist madness lay. But if all baptized children were held to be members, could those who failed to make the expected progress be thrown out of the fold when they came of age on the 695</page><page sequence="21">696 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY grounds that they had secured no foothold in the spirit- ual realm, when the two realms were held to be alto- gether separate, when happenings within the spiritual realm were unfathomable by man, and when every one acknowledged that beyond a doubt many who were re- ceived into the church were a stench in the nostrils of God? In determining who should participate in the ecclesiastical system, was the blanket promise of God to extend the covenant to the seed of believers less valid evidence than that offered by the individual through his own profession, when all evidence at best was purely presumptive and apt to be fallacious? It was the core of Calvinistic theology that God saved men by His arbi- trary condescension, but what if in one case He did it through contact with the individual and in another through the parent, without apparently touching the individual at all? Such a prospect would even seem a challenge to the faith of a people who believed that the Deity customarily performed His wonders in mys- terious ways. In fact, in their minds it might take on a decided tinge of probability as they reflected that the danger of getting hypocrites into the church was about as great one way as the other. But on the other hand, if these children continued to flood the churches, would not that be the end of Congregationalism in New Eng- land? Congregationalism, we must recollect, was based on the theory that church-members were at least evi- dently regenerate. About these unfortunates not even a supposition could be made. Could this system, founded as it had been upon the attributes of sincere religion, continue in existence at all when a great per- centage of the generations who were to perpetuate it</page><page sequence="22">THE HALF-WAY COVENANT obviously and conclusively failed to acquire any such attributes? The dissenters at the synod of 1662, ably represented by President Chauncy, John Davenport, Increase Mather, and Nicholas Street, found the last question unanswerable. They decided that if the system was to survive, it could not stomach baptized but unregenerate children, no matter who their parents were. The churches might indeed be founded upon appearances, but nevertheless these were appearances of spiritual realities. Children who grew up unable to muster any such manifestations should get no better treatment than any other incapable persons. So far as the world could judge, they were essentially unbelievers; they might not have committed open immoralities, but they would have shown their true colors by "neglecting the means of Grace, or non-manifestations of making profession of the Faith, and the fruits thereof."3 If the adult chil- dren could not manage a personal and immediate con- federation, said Davenport, they were in a state of sin, they were naturally incapable of good, and in their hearts "these despise the Church of God."32 Thus, though they may have been members during their mi- nority, when they came of age and made no professions, "then they do not retain their Membership which they had in minority."33 They were automatically to be ex- pelled. The dissenters waxed so hot upon this point that they actually insinuated that the children were in 31 Charles Chauncy, Anti-Synodalia Scripta Americana (London, i662), 24. 32 John Davenport, Another Essay for Investigation of the Truth (Cambridge, 1663), 45. 33 Ibid., Increase Mather in Preface, A2, recto. 697</page><page sequence="23">698 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY some fashion responsible for not having made a better showing. They declared their failure made them felones de se. Davenport argued that the children had been pledged to God in their infancy, whereby they had become "engaged and excited the more to give themselves to God in Christ . . . not by constraint but willingly;" consequently they had only themselves to blame if their sinful hearts did not surrender. Amus- ingly enough, Davenport went on to say that such a willing surrender to Christ would have had to come about "through the operation of God working Faith in their hearts, by the Spirit, who is a voluntary Agent, and therfore likened to the wind which bloweth where it listeth." But though his reasoning was a trifle con- fused, Davenport came to an unequivocal conclusion: "The Church must make a difference of children grown up, where God makes a difference ... and receive onely such whom Christ receiveth."34 Here the dissenters took their stand, and demanded that the churches of New England unchurch the helpless children, expel the grandchildren, and consign the lot of them to ever- lasting torments. And the dissenters, it should be re- membered, were still Englishmen. The majority of the divines recognized that the dis- senters' position was sincerely taken, but they felt that it was altogether too rash and precipitous. They had an armory of careful theorizing to draw upon, and they were grateful to the fathers who had meticulously dis- tinguished and divided the realms of the spirit and the church. They had no mind to minimize the epistemo- logical speculations which already had brought home 34 Davenport, Another Essay for Investigation of the Truth, 6.</page><page sequence="24">THE HALF-WAY COVENANT the impossibility and the danger of identifying mani- festations of regeneration with the thing itself. The minority were zealous, the majority more circumspect. A machinery was needed for rationalizing the pursuit of a practical objective in terms of a divinely pre- ordained system, and they saw that the way to achieve it was to interpret the whole problem as pertaining only to the realm of organization. They remained within the letter of Congregational tradition by the strange device of insisting that the spirit was not concerned, that the issue was not whether the children "have true Faith, or not, in the act or habit, so they have such qualifica- tions as God accepts of, to receive their persons into his Covenant, and to be Members of the Body of Christ." If they had the qualifications, "this sufficeth, though they have no Faith or Grace really."35 The church realm was, at best, one of probabilities, and God alone specified how the probabilities should be gauged; there- fore if He said that simply by being the progeny of church-members persons were fit to become members, that would constitute good qualification. It was enough to warrant their formal, legal inclusion within the group, enough to invest them with evident righteous- ness, with "federal holiness," if not with inner virtue. To treat them as confederated believers and to keep them within the church did not mean, Thomas Shepard had written, . . .that they are alwaies in inward Covenant, and inward Church-Members, who enjoy the inward, and saveing benefits of the Covenant, but that they are in external, and outward Covenant, and therefore outwardly Church-Members, to whom 35 Allin, Animadversions, 25. 699</page><page sequence="25">700 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY belongs some outward privileges of the Covenant for their inward and eternall good.36 Hence the synod boldly determined that "meer mem- bership" was its province, a matter quite distinct from ability to make professions, "as in the children of the Covenant, that grow up to years is too often seen."37 Children could not inherit a right to Heaven or to the communion table, but they could succeed to citizenship in a body politic. "Only the confederation, not the condition or conversation of the Parent is imputed to the Child."38 The church as a society was concerned only with the legality of their title within the corporate group; if they did not profit by the opportunities it offered for becoming genuine converts, that was their loss. They might secure no standing in the church triumphant, but they would lose none in the church militant. If they did not prove regenerate, ... we may say their Covenant and Church-relation is as none in respect of any Spiritual saving benefit to their souls ... and yet it can no more be said, that in respect of their Church-relation and external visible state, they are not in the Church . . . then in other particulars it can be said, that they are not . . . bap- tized.39 Just as soon as membership was defined in these terms, as being a formal relationship to a specific com- monwealth, a number of interesting consequences fol- lowed. In a commonwealth an individual had to be either completely a member or none whatsoever. No one could be half citizen and half alien. He might be 36 Shepard, The Church-Membership of Children, 2. 37 Propositions Concerning the Subject of Baptism, II. 38 Increase Mather, First Principles, 9. 39 Richard Mather, A Defence of the Answer, 33.</page><page sequence="26">THE HALF-WAY COVENANT a good member or a bad one, he might be entitled to communion or not, but once in, he was altogether in, "Even as a childe of the family is not so perfect to do the work, and enjoy all the Priviledges of the Family, as a grown person is, but yet he is as perfectly a Mem- ber of the Family as a grown man."40 The difference between a non-communicating and a communicating member was not a distinction of kind, but merely one of the methods by which each had entered the compact. One was a citizen by birth, the other had been natural- ized. "The Free-grace of God in his Covenant, ex- tended both to Parent and Childe.... The way of en- tring into this Covenant on mans part is onely a differ- ing modus or manner of Covenanting with God."41 Once the essential membership of the children was thus established, the thing clearly could be extended through the generations; the grandchildren were members by the same token. Adults who had not been baptized and had been reared outside the church could not be ad- mitted to the covenant until examined for the visible signs of piety, ... yet this concerns not the Parents of the children here spoken of, because they are not now to be admitted into the Covenant and Church membership, but are therein already, and have been long afore now, even from their minority or birth.42 The whole dispute, as the apologists persisted in view- ing it, had nothing to do with the admission of adults through personal profession; it was only concerned "About persons already in the Church, and Baptized, 40 Allin, Animadversions, 28. 41 Ibid., 29. 42 Richard Mather, A Defence of the Answer, 30. 70I</page><page sequence="27">702 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY whether in such, the grounds of Baptizing their seed, be Faith and Grace made visible in some manner, or their Interest in the Covenant?"43 Through "interest in the covenant" these children obtained only a political and not necessarily a religious status; therefore political maxims applied to their condition. It was already a platitude of Puritan political dogma that a compact was irrevocable as long as both parties lived up to it. There- fore, unless these children and grandchildren broke the compact of federal holiness by some overt act of scan- dal, how in God's name could they be dropped from the society? The idea of their becoming felones de se was absurd. A church-member "cannot be outed, till God out him."4 "In Admitting Members into the Church," said John Allin, "we justly work for such positive Qualifications as the Word of God requireth," but once we have determined that certain persons have the qualifications, either by virtue of their own pro- fession or by virtue of their parentage, then "to cast out such as are Regularly admitted, we must have posi- tive Impenitency in sin."45 This much of its doctrine the synod attained merely by accentuating already accepted opinions concerning the necessarily objective character of a corporate church. Thus it managed to enter the substance of its decision without apparently doing violence to the inherited the- ology or creating innovations in the discipline. Indeed, the distinguishing mark of the Propositions might be said to be precisely too rigorous a consistency, too in- 43 Allin, Animadversions, 22. 44 Jonathan Mitchel, An Answer to the Apologetical Preface (Cam- bridge, 1664), 12.

It has been noted that there was a marked trend towards formal- ism in the New England of the forties and fifties, but the resolution in I662 of the status of children on the grounds solely of visibility put a finishing touch to the transformation of Congregationalism from a religious Utopia to a legalized order. Religion was practically confined to the inner consciousness of the individual. He alone needed to be concerned about the assurances of election. The churches were pledged, in effect, not to pry into the genuineness of any religious emotions, but to be altogether satisfied with decorous semblances. The apologists concentrated upon the letter of the law, and so solved their problem without noticeably reno- vating the divine scheme, but they did so at the cost of ignoring the spirit. This came out most clearly when they drew a lengthy analogy between the rite of bap- tism and the Old Testament rite of circumcision. They refused altogether to recollect that Israel had been a tribe first and a church only secondarily, and that con- version as a basis for membership was utterly foreign to the spirit of Judaism. Even though the Jewish church was "National," argued Richard Mather, while ours is "Congregational," still in each church the cove- nant runs to members and their seed; "now as well as then, if the Parents continue in covenant, the Children do so also, and so are part of the Church."46 If an in- crease of hypocrites had threatened the churches even when men became members only through profession, how much greater was the threat when generation after generation could continue in church compact with con- 46 Richard Mather, A Defence of the Answer, 56. 7o03</page><page sequence="29">704 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY fessedly no more grounds to distinguish them from the heathen than the negative virtue of avoiding open scandal! Thomas Shepard had foreseen this possibility, and the synodalists confessed they perceived it too, for they published his letter in 1663: God knowes what Churches we may have of them, even heaps of hypocrites, and prophane persons, for I know not what can give us hope of their not apostatizing, but only Gods promise to be a God to them, and to preserve them.47 This was a melancholy prospect for good Christians to contemplate. It is not surprising that at this point the apologists betrayed an uneasy sense that perhaps they had gone too far; and they turned once more for reassurances to logic, which generally worked such wonders in the seventeenth century. Was it after all necessary, they mused, to assume that baptized children who lived and died soberly and morally within the church were damned just because they had undergone no emotional convulsion? If, for instance, a baptized child experienced effectual calling on his twentieth birthday, he was considered to have been all along a legitimate member of the church. But another who did not have the experience until his fortieth year still enjoyed his membership on trust every bit as legiti- mately for a score of years longer. Now it was con- ceivable that this one, instead of living to become ob- viously regenerate at forty, might be cut off at thirty- nine. If God had chosen him, would not God save him anyway? And since no one could even begin to com- prehend what went on in the realm of spirit, and since that realm had been divorced completely from the 47 Shepard, The Church-Membership of Children, I5.</page><page sequence="30">THE HALF-WAY COVENANT physical world, might not some men become truly re- generate without ever anybody in this world suspecting it, least of all themselves? There might exist a sort of state of grace half-way between demonstrable repro- bation and demonstrable regeneration in which men would become saved, as it were, subconsciously. The half-way members, baptized but not communicating, actually might be construed as the worldly embodiment of this intermediate condition. The apologists knew that at this point they skated upon very thin ice indeed. They were dangerously close to pleading for some species of "Universal Baptism Grace," to declaring that baptism was not a means of grace but a vehicle - which Davenport pointed out was a damnable error of the Arminians. Strangely enough, Richard Mather, one of the older generation, handled the notion most daringly. He did not say baptism made children regen- erate, but he did go so far as to assert that baptized chil- dren who grew up respectable but unconverted need not be pronounced to lack "the very being of Faith." May there not, he asked, be real saving grace "even there where the exercise of it is much wanting? . . . Notwith- standing all this weakness, there may be the being and truth of the thing in such Souls." Even though the children did not have the ability to examine themselves, as required by the Lord's Supper, yet they "are in a latitude of expression to be accounted visible believers" because "Being in covenant and baptized, they have Faith and Repentance indefinitely given to them in the Promise, and sealed up in Baptism ... which continues valid, and so a valid testimony for them, while they do not reject it."48 "Surely," Jonathan Mitchel 48 Shepard, T'he Church-Membership of Children, 51-52, 13. 705</page><page sequence="31">706 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY pleaded, suddenly shifting from ecclesiastical meta- physics to argumentum ad hominem, . .. the Lord does not make so light a matter of his holy Covenant and seal... as to enter into a solemn Covenant with Children, take them into his Church, and seal up their taking in before Men and Angels, and then let them goe out so easily, or drop off we know not how.49 One strange and -for the future--pregnant result of having made the realm of spirit a mystery unde- cipherable to man seems to be here revealing itself almost immediately: New Englanders had practically surrendered the attempt to make positive assertions con- cerning the real workings of predestination, they had decided that election was an impenetrable "secret with God"; then, paradoxically, they began to prefigure the operations of the decree in a more lively and human fashion than when their imaginations had been weighed down by their original respect for authentic evidences. Once the realm of spirit and the eternal decrees of God were decided to be unintelligible to the flesh, they be- came susceptible of description in terms of human emo- tions. The perennial anthropomorphic tendency of the race reasserted itself in the statement that God's atti- tude toward the baptismal covenant would "surely" be influenced by men's standards of justice. To proclaim the divine mind incomprehensible might become in reality the first step for projecting humanity into it. Samuel Willard, an earnest exponent of the synod's doctrine, would shortly be expressing the orthodox opinion of New England when he wrote: 49 Shepard, The Church-Membership of Children, 15.</page><page sequence="32">THE HALF-WAY COVENANT We conceive of Gods decrees in a rational way, or according to the manner of men in their purposing and decreeing, in which we design one thing for another; hence first one thing and then another . . . because else we could entertain no con- ceptions at all about this glorious mystery, but must be wholly ignorant of it.50 But in 1662 these were yet undeveloped implications. For the moment the immediate effect was the supplying of a program by which the churches could treat the children as something better than passive onlookers. The children were only formal members, but members of any sort could be incited to good works. Should they by any chance happen to be regenerate without even knowing it, their good deeds would be acceptable to God. In any event they could be disciplined by church censure and excommunication, though they never on earth achieved the ability to warrant "full" membership. As members of a body politic they were subject to its legislation. Baptism leaves the baptized . .. in a state of subjection to the authoritative teaching of Christs Ministers, and to the obser- vation of all his commandments . . . and therefore in a state of subjection unto Discipline . . . otherwise Irreligion and Apostacy would inevitably break into Churches, and no Church- way left by Christ to prevent or heal the same; which would also bring many Church-members under that dreadful judge- ment of being let alone in their wickedness.51 As a purely ecclesiastical matter, baptism was "in the Nature of a Covenant... a Mutual Obligation between two Parties upon terms;" to the baptized, therefore, it ought to be "as a strong bond upon them, carefully to keep it;" it would "be a Witness against them, if they 50 Willard, Complete Body of Divinity, 255. 51 Propositions Concerning the Subject of Baptism, io. 707</page><page sequence="33">708 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY violate it.""5 Since there had been shown to be "no certain, but onely a probable connexion between federal Holyness... and Salvation," persons could be required to become federally holy without implying that they were required to undertake their own conversion. The baptized had promised to do their best on the ecclesias- tical plane; they could always be reminded what a com- pact they had entered into, . . . and by what promise of gratitude they have likewise obliged themselves unto obedience to God.. And they are seriously to be exhorted . . . that they abide in that Covenant of peace, and endeavour to fulfill that obligation, by morti- fying sin, and setting upon newness of life, and that they do this freely, and sincerely.53 The response which the baptized were expected to make to these exhortations was institutionalized by the synod in a ceremony called "owning the baptismal cove- nant." This rite comes the nearest to being an innova- tion of anything the synod proposed, and it was what earned for the whole doctrine the sobriquet of "half- way;" yet the establishment of this ritual was simply a gesture necessary to the thinking which had reached the point we have described. The children were mem- bers of the church, they had accepted a covenant by becoming baptized, and were to live up to their pledge. When they came of age and desired to have their own infants baptized, the churches would need some overt sign that they had done and would continue to do their duty. They could not make a full profession of faith, for they still lacked "ability," but they could acknowl- 52 Willard, Complete Body of Divinity, 848, 855. 53 Quotation from Chemnitus, printed in Shepard, Church-Membership of Children, AI, verso.</page><page sequence="34">THE HALF-WAY COVENANT edge their ecclesiastical obligations. They could pledge obedience, make a formal agreement with the church, which at the same time was understood to imply no profession of any Christian experience.54 They could make "an orderly and Church profession of our Faith . .. in an Ecclesiasticall way," if not in a spiritual way.55 The objectives of the visible church would be obtained if the baptized fulfilled their contract, voluntarily pledged a continuation of their endeavors, and put themselves under discipline. As for the objectives of the invisible church - well, by owning the covenant the children offered evidence of a sort, they demonstrated they had enough freedom of will to undertake at least ecclesiastical responsibilities, and that was something more than impotent passivity. Who could say what this might really mean? If Faith be taken for the grace of Faith in the heart, why may they not be said to have Faith in this sense also, seeing it is required of them, that besides their understanding the Doctrine of Faith, and their professing their Assent thereto, that they must also not be Scandalous in Life, but solemnly own the Covenant. . . . And does not this imply some beginning of Faith? Can persons have all these Qualifications, and yet for this be utterly destitute of the grace of Faith? . . . And in as much as men have neither Faith, nor any thing that good is by Nature, therefore they that have it may be said to be con- verted to it.56 The church could confidently risk working with this material. It could not only require the children to own this covenant in order to have their offspring baptized, 54 Leonard Bacon, "Historical Discourse," in Contributions to the Ecclesiastical History of Connecticut (New Haven, I861), 21. 55 A Disputation Concerning Church-Members, I5. 56 Richard Mather, quoted in Increase Mather, First Principles, 14. 709</page><page sequence="35">710 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY it could even take the initiative: "It is the duty of the Church to call upon them for the performance there- of."5 The apologists had traveled a difficult dialectical road, and it is to be suspected some of them made a wry face when they had to swallow such stuff as the analogy between baptism and circumcision; but they emerged with their objective gained and their scruples laid at rest. The theology of New England remained as deterministic as it had been, the structure of the ecclesiastical system was not disturbed; yet the churches possessed a clear-cut program for keeping youth within bounds. They had grounds upon which they could meet the problem and do something about it. The success of the majority on the score of practical effectiveness overwhelmed the dissenters. On the whole the minority argued the matter with a finer logic and certainly with a greater concern for the sincerities. They riddled the apologists' picture of a state of grace that could not become evident, they recognized the ridiculousness of setting out to separate the sheep from the goats and then including a number of goats because, although they did not look like it, they might possibly be sheep. "The Children in question," said President Chauncy, "are in a state of Neutrality for the present;" that was the best that could be said of them, but all such in the final analysis "Christ accounts to be against him."58 The dissenters clearly saw through the parallel between circumcision and baptism: "the similitude runs not upon four feet."59 They perceived that "owning 57 A Disputation Concerning C/zurch-Members, 20. 58 Chauncy, Anti-Synodalia, 34. 59Ibid., 14.</page><page sequence="36">THE HALF-WAY COVENANT the covenant" was an affair of the head and not of the heart- that devils, if necessary, could go through with it. To cause unregenerate persons to profess subjection was, as they saw it, to embody a contradiction in terms; "it is but an obligation to an impossibility; neither can there be obedience without faith."60 Unless the churches preserved healthy faith against contagion by lopping off unhealthy tissue, the dissenters predicted a future of decay. They forecast that the churches would become pervaded with pharisaism. It is apparent unto all what a corrupt masse of Unbelievers shall by this change throng into the fellowship of Gods People, and the children of strangers, uncircumcised in heart, shall be brought into Gods Sanctuary to pollute it.61 But all these excellent arguments were not powerful enough to compensate for the crucial weakness in the dissenters' position: by ruling out the oncoming host of baptized but unregenerate children as felones de se they would have reduced the churches to a wraith. They argued that if persons were admitted without due regard for spiritual fitness "the application of Church- Censures to them, will be disregarded and slighted by them,"62 but they could suggest no method for dealing with such persons. And yet they, too, confessed that if children were not put under watch and government, the regime would not survive. To the apologists this was enough "the whole Cause was given up in that Prop- osition."63 So the ultimate moral would seem to be that though our seventeenth-century forbears would do 60 Chauncy, Anti-Synodalia, 31. 61 Ibid., o. 62 Davenport, Another Essay, 34. 63 Allin, Animadversions, 34. 7II</page><page sequence="37">712 THE NEW ENGLAND QUARTERLY nothing without proofs from Holy Writ, yet as between one array of proofs and another, they could find it con- venient to choose that which was the more compatible with their mundane interests. The truth of this observation is aptly illustrated by the history of Increase Mather. To him the rigorous position of the dissenters had at first seemed more attractive, and he had entered the lists against his father, writing the preface for old John Davenport's Another Essay. But soon after, largely through the ministra- tions of Jonathan Mitchel, he came to realize that though the dissenting position might be theologically right, it was ecclesiastically all wrong. Whereupon he came over to the other side with such a vehemence that he soon out-apologized the apologists. He pushed to extremes every argument he had formerly opposed. He refused to acknowledge that the question could be anything but an ecclesiastical affair. "That Faith which giveth right to Baptism ... as to us is not invisible faith. But the visibility of faith is that which we must pro- ceed upon."64 Accepting this doctrine wholly, Mather quoted Mitchel to inform his former allies that they had been headed up an ecclesiastical blind-alley. "In the way your self and some others go, the bigger half of the people in this Country will in a little Time be unbaptized."65 When he had been in the opposition, he had implied that the New England experiment had better fail utterly than survive by transforming its character; thereafter, he seems to have decided that the idealistic position was too quixotic, that the cause of 64 Increase Mather, A Discourse Concerning the Subject of Baptisme (Cambridge, 1675), 9. 65 Mitchel, in Increase Mather, First Principles, Appendix, 5.</page><page sequence="38">THE HALF-WAY COVENANT religion was bound up with the continuation of the New England regime in any circumstances. It would be, he now agreed, "subversive to Religion," it would be "ab- surd," that a people "of a more reformed temper then ordinarily the world hath known .. . should so soon be the body of them unbaptized, as if they were not a Christian, but an Heathen People."66 As soon as the standard of the synod was taken up by this practical and dynamic man, the intricacies of theological rational- ization became a bit superfluous. Once Increase Mather had made up his mind, he brushed aside all the debate, pro and con, in which his elders had indulged; and, with the instincts of a statesman rather than a theolo- gian, placed his greatest emphasis upon an out-and-out emotional appeal, an argument decidedly ad hominem: There are many godly Souls in New-England, that the great motive which prevailed with them to come into this wilderness, was that so they might leave their Children under the Govern- ment of Christ in his Church... Have we for our poor Childrens sake in special, left a dear and pleasant Land, and ventured our Lives upon the great waters, and encountered with the difficulties and miseries of a wilderness, and doth it at last come to this, that they have no more Advantages as to any Church care about them, then the Indians and Infidels amongst whom we live? 0 this is sad!67 Sad indeed, and the synod of 1662, with its provision of a half-way arrangement for baptized but unregen- erate church-members, preserved Massachusetts and Connecticut from such a fate.

Yet I can not altogether sympathize with the church historians who have unanimously condemned the synod for having guided Congregationalism into com- promise and legalism. The leaders of the day faced their task manfully and intelligently, they brought to bear upon it all the learning and insight of their gen- eration. The fault, if it can be called a fault, lay not in themselves but in their stars. They were committed by their inheritance and their characters to the well-nigh hopeless task of bolstering up a system founded on the courageous but ill-considered conviction that the way- ward, subjective mysteries of regeneration could be institutionalized in an ecclesiastical system. All over Christendom the intricate, top-heavy structures of Ref- ormation theology were sagging; the age was turning away from them to more comfortable, if less logical, views; it was groping toward the greater simplicity and utility which were to characterize the eighteenth cen- tury. The divines were unwittingly caught between a dying age and one striving to be born, and the half- way covenant controversy is simply the New England counterpart to what was taking place in other guises throughout the western world. It is conceivable that had there existed in Boston at the time some great religious and philosophical mind, some Jonathan Ed- wards, let us say, enough in advance of his day to pro- claim that the emotional life should not be strangled in the coils of an ecclesiastical system, such a mind might have profited by the experience of the preceding decade, remodeled the system and infused it with a revivified faith.

It was only when the churches had gone the limit in these directions that either Ed- wards or the rationalists could abandon the preoccupa- tion with polity and get back to the first principles of religion itself.</page></plain_text>
