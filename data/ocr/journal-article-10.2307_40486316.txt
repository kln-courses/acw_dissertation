<plain_text><page sequence="1">326 PACIFIC NORTHWEST QUARTERLY [July China and the World War. By Thomas Edward La Fargue. (Hoover War Library Publications, no. 12. Stanford University: Stanford University Press, 1937. χ +278 pp. $3.25.) Mr. La Fargue's study is concerned with certain aspects of the diplo- matic history of the Far East during the period 1914-1919, centering, de- spite the title of the book, less around the effect of the World War upon China than upon conflicting Japanese- American policies relative to China. Dealing first with Japan's seizure of Kiaochou following the declaration of war against Germany, he covers next the background of the Twenty- one Demands, both economic and political, and traces the subsequent Sino-Japanese negotiations together with their repercussions in China, the United States, Great Britain, and Japan itself. Japanese gains repre- sented by the treaties and notes of May, 1915, the author believes, hardly compensated for the resulting ill-will among the Chinese. Mr. La Fargue deals next with the selfish rivalry involving Chinese constitutionalists, provincial autonomists, and militarists which culminated in the Chinese declaration of war against Germany. The clique in control of the Peking government confidently anticipated foreign loans and other benefits as a reward for its decision to enter the War on the side of the Allies. When these loans were not forthcoming from the United States, a successful ap- proach was made to Japanese financiers. The consequence was an inten- sification of Japanese- American rivalries which were temporarily allayed by the Lansing-Ishii notes only to be revived in full force at the Paris Peace Conference. A chapter is devoted to China's passive and hardly creditable role in the War, which is attributed not only to manoeuvers for personal advantage among the Chinese militarists but to jealous rivalries among the Allied governments themselves. In this connection the active support given by the Japanese to the Anfu clique then in control at Pe- king is somewhat minimized. Except for the conclusion, the last two chapters, fully documented, deal in intricate detail with Sino-Japanese- American rivalries at the Peace Conference. In the chapters covering the Japanese seizure of Kiaochou and the Twenty-one Demands, extensive use has been made of Japanese material contained in Ito's Kato Takaaki Den. It is curious, however, that no ref- erence is made to corresponding Chinese material, such as Y. S. Wang's Liu Shih Nien Lai Chung-Kuo Yü Jih-Pen, Volume VI, which contains not only a detailed summary of the negotiations resulting from the Twenty- one Demands, based upon the Chinese minutes of the conference, but also Yuan Shih-k'ai's marginalia on the original demands themselves. Moreover, since so much attention is given to Japanese foreign policy, a much sharper distinction should have been made between the Kato-Ok- uma policy of achieving Japanese ends in China by diplomatic intimida-</page><page sequence="2">1938] BOOK REVIEWS 327 tion and military coercion, and the Terauchi-Nishihara policy of gaining the same ends by outright purchase. For the chapters on the Paris Peace Conference, significant use has been made of David Hunter Miller's My Diary at the Conference of Paris. Appendix III of the book contains ex- cerpts from this material in even greater detail. Some curious omissions may be noted. Nowhere is mention made of the Chinese declaration of war against Austria-Hungary, although there are references to its subsequent effect. Likewise ignored are the larger implications of China's formal participation in the War. The elim- ination of both Germany and Austria-Hungary from the list of treaty powers marked the first real break in that unity of the Western world which had manifested itself every time the Chinese government sought to rid itself of its international shackles. It marked, as well, the first break in the network; of treaties which served as the legal foundation of those shackles. The German concession at Hankow remained after the war in Chinese hands, as did also the German and Austrian concessions at Tientsin. The German, Austrian, and Russian shares of the Boxer In- demnity were cancelled, together with rights belonging to the three Pow- ers under the Protocol of 1901. Finally, the new nations which appeared in Europe as a result of the War, such as Czecho-Slovakia and Poland, were left without special treaty rights in China, such as extraterritoriality and treaty control over the Chinese tariff. So far as Europe and the United States were concerned, the World War marked the beginning of the end of the white man's dominion in China. By their insistence on the deportation from Chinese territory of German merchants and mission- aries, the British and French governments contributed unwittingly to- ward this result. Particularly because of the intelligent use which has been made of Kato's and Ishii's memoirs and the diary of Mr. Miller, the author has made a worthwhile contribution to the volume of literature bearing on the diplomatic history of the Far East. One wonders, however, whether the straight diplomatic and legal approach is any longer adequate in a study of international relations. The economic background of the Twenty- one Demands is given in reasonably satisfactory fashion, it is true. But nowhere is any mention made of the probable connection between this policy and the Mitsubishi interests with which Count Kato was connected by marriage. Copious excerpts from the records of diplomatic conversa- tions sometimes reveal the motives and aims of nations far less than other material of less precise nature which rarely appears in the diplomatic rec- ords. The organic unity attributed to nations by exponents of formal dip- lomatic history is sometimes faintly suggestive of political anthropomorph- ism. As an example of this school of thought, Mr. La Fargue, referring to the Japanese program at the Paris Conference, says (pp. 230-231),</page><page sequence="3">328 PACIFIC NORTHWEST QUARTERLY [July "Japan had come to the Conference fully prepared upon this issue [the principle that Western powers should cease interfering in Japan's politi- cal relations with China]. With the exception of the United States she had every one of the parties to the dispute . . . committed to her claims. Furthermore, she had given her word to restore Kiaochou to China. . . ?' Any realist in international affairs is compelled to admit that nations are not ladies, the clear proof being that seldom if ever can their actions be called lady-like. Robert T.
