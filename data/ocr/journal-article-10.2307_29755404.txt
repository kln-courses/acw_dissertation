<plain_text><page sequence="1">V. I. Sarianidi, Tajny isceznuvsego iskusstva Ka rakumov (The Secrets of the Vanished Art of the Karakumy) (U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, Institute of Archaeology, Series ? From the Hi? story of World Culture ?, Moscow, ? Nauka ? Publishing House, 1967, 108 pp., numerous il? lustrations). This book is intended to serve as introduc? tion and guide to the artistic history of one of the great archaeological provinces of Soviet Asia, southern Turkmenistan, and in particular the now desert zone of the Kara-Kum or Kara-Kumy (both singular and plural forms are current). There is no need to remind the readers of this Review that the work of numerous archaeological expeditions in exploring this region over the last few decades has revealed it to be one of the richest, from the point of view of the history of art, so much so that it can legitimately lay claim to a respectable place alongside those other great artistic areas of 235</page><page sequence="2">the ancient East, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Iran and India. But while these areas have been the object of almost two centuries of intense scientific study, the zone of the ? Black Sands ? (for such is the translation, highly evocative of fearful associations, of Kara-Kumy) has not yet become part of the arti? stic conscience of the average educated man, not even in the USSR itself, according to the Author. It is the intent of the writer of this small volume to contribute to filling this lacuna. Even in the Soviet Union, Sarianidi points out, ? so far there does not exist one sole work dedicated to an examination of the successive steps in the evolu? tion of the applied art peculiar to the ancient tribes which occupied southern Turkmenistan over the course of a millennium ?. The applied art here referred to by the Author is essentially ceramics and the decoration intimately connected with it - this authentic artistic and symbolic ? wri? ting ? of prehistoric times. The oldest complex of prehistoric art illustra? ted by the Author is that of the ?culture of Dzejtun ?, named after a locality situated in the middle of the deserts of the Kara-Kumy. In this and in other sites of southern Turkmenistan nu? merous neolithic remains have been brought to light. These have been attributed to primitive agricultural peoples of the 5th millennium, and are characterized by dwellings of crude, that is sun-dried, brick, the elements of ceramics, the cul? tivation of grain and barley and the raising of goats. It is in this period, the Author affirms, that those principles of village planning and con? struction design governing the erection of houses and habitations (for men and gods) were being formulated and which were then conserved with only slight variations over many succeeding mil? lennia. In fact the entire art and technique of buil? ding construction in Central Asia is said to have its roots in this creative neolithic phase, which the Author correctly collocates in the vaster cultural context of Mesopotamia, Sumer, etc. Also in this area clay reigns supreme as the basic material, not only in the arts of construc? tion of this period, but also in the wide variety of ceramic forms already to be found there, ? one of the oldest potteries in the world ?, even though this primitive industry still has not developed the techniques of the potter's wheel and the control? lable potter's oven. Nevertheless, coloured vessels are already to be found in this primitive phase of ceramics, perhaps used more ? as pottery for show reserved for great occasions ?, the Author believes. Yet these still primitive wares are provided with certain typical ornamental motifs which were de? stined to remain dominant throughout the succes? sive evolutionary phases of the art of ceramics. The Author never tires in the course of his expo sition of interpreting the semantics of these deco? rative motifs as they persist throughout the va? rious prehistoric stages in which they can be tra? ced in the area under consideration. Nor does he refrain, when the occasion presents itself, from making certain instructive comparisons with other cultural areas of the Eurasian world with which the succession of Central Asiatic cultures conti? nuously remains more or less intimately connected. In fact in our opinion one of the major virtues of this succinct yet pithy publication lies in this per? sistent and expert attention that the Author pays to pottery and its ornamentation, this latter being understood as the vehicle of cultural, ideological and even magico-religious contents. In contrast to not a few Soviet archaeologists, whose interests are almost entirely absorbed by so called ? material culture ? (but it might be asked whether an exclusively ?material? culture has ever really existed), our Author is gifted with a refined sensibility for the spiritual and ideological aspects of art, aspects which are already to be found at even the most ? primitive ? stages in the cultural career of mankind. He recalls the magic function present in the so-called ? realism ? of pa? laeolithic representations of hunting scenes, but insists that a magic side may be peculiar even to the neolithic art of the area explored by him. ? The people of the New Stone Age were still deeply attached to similar magical representations, and this found its reflection in the ceramic art of the Dzejtun tribes. Here is a vessel on which vertical groups of undulating stripes resembling waves of the sea are divided by rows of little horizontal li? nes. Is this not a representation of water flowing between the hedges dividing one field from ano? ther? And is not such a design intended to invoke a permanent abundance of water? Was there not then a magical significance immanent in such a design? ?. Certainly this same Author is not unaware of more empirical and more technological explana? tions of the origin of ornamental motifs, the most widely known being that which would derive the geometric pattern of primitive designs from basket making techniques. The ornamentation woven into straw and wicker baskets of various sorts is thought to have been ?translated? in clay and other mixtures. The close dependence of the first ce? ramic ornamentation on the oldest domestic tech? niques is a fact that no one, much less a Soviet archaeologist, would deny. In fact, the radically geometric decorative motifs of Dzejtun and of suc? ceeding cultures of southern Turkmenistan are also generally interpreted as imitation of wicker work. For it is generally supposed that the tech? niques of basket-making preceded the invention of ceramics. As the Author rightly observes, even 236</page><page sequence="3">admitting that such a supposition is not to be excluded a priori, it would be just as hazardous to raise it to the rank of a dogma, seeing that, as the Author points out, ? there are no facts which support the view that baskets coated with clay were produced prior to the discovery of ceramics ?. This question might remind one of the facetious priority of the chicken or the egg if it were not in a cer? tain sense related to the ancient epistemological, or rather metaphysical problem: can such ?per? fect ? geometrical forms as the circle, the triangle, the square, the rhomb, the lozenge, the wavy line, etc., such as already constantly recur in ? primi? tive ? ornamental designs ? those of Dzejtun being a case in point - come from mere empirical obser? vation of natural objects, or are they not rather ideas already innate in the mind or constructive creations emanating from it, in the sense in which, for example the form of the sphere (according to the doctrine of Pythagoras as re-elaborated by Pla? to the most ?ideal? and ?divine? of all the forms) cannot have its origin in the world of per? ceptions and empirical objects of nature, much less in those ? banausic ? objects familiar to the potter and the basket-weaver, but only in the reign of the Forms, of the ?aesthetic fantasy?, and so forth. Independent of whatever answer one would like to give to this ancient problem, the presence of geometric decoration of such perfection as is to be found in the culture of Dzejtun as well as in the others that follow on in the area under consi? deration merits the attention of theorists of art and aesthetics as well as archaeologists. For the numerous reproductions of geometrically decorated pottery to be found in this volume provide ample material for their reflections, not only regarding the Dzejtun culture but also that of the Chalcoli? thic Age in general, and include objects illustra? tive of the polychrome style of the 4th millennium, the monochrome style of Kara-tepe likewise from the 4th millennium, the style of Geoksjur of the 3rd millennium, the pottery of Kara-tepe of the 3rd millennium (extraordinarily rich and intere? sting), the ceramics of the 3rd millennium decora? ted with the ?carpet? type of design, and the painted ware of Altyn-tepe from the 2nd millen? nium, etc. The tenacious fidelity throughout several mil? lennia of the original tribes of the Kara-Kumy (to speak only of these) to this archaic ? cult? of geo? metric forms is most remarkable. It would have brought joy to the heart of the great thinker who had inscribed over the portal of his Academy the warning: ? Let no one wo is ignorant of geometry enter here ?. Within the narrow limits set by this small vo? lume, the Author was unable to go into the pro blem of the ethnic and cultural relationship of the tribes of Dzejtun and their successors on the soil of southern Turkmenistan to the surrounding ethnic and cultural world. He limits himself to noting that ? in north-eastern Iran there exist an? cient sites, such as Cesme-Ali and Sir-i-Sajn, for example, with pottery bearing an extraordinary resemblance to that which suddenly makes its ap? pearance in southern Turkmenistan around the middle of the 5th millennium ?. These peoples are thought to have arrived in the territory till then occupied by the first Dzejtun tribes after having crossed the mountain range of Kopet Dagh, and being also agricultural, to have rapidly fused with the local population. (These immigrants are thought to have brought with them some innovations, a more perfected ce? ramic technique and a more regular planning of habitations, etc. The Author also feels that a new motive in geometric design can be attributed to them, viz., small obliquely delineated triangles, etc. As he does throughout his entire exposition, the Author here too makes an attempt to distin? guish partial innovations within the broad field of stylistic semantics constituted by geometrical orna? ment, innovations which he interprets as the con? tribution of hypothetical newly-arrived peoples. This method of attribution is somewhat hazardous, to say the least, but it is perhaps unavoidable as the only means available of discerning and indi? vidualizing in this only seemingly immobile mare magnum of geometrical ornamentation some of the stylistic currents manifest in history, as eventual emanations of certain ethnic groupings difficult to make out in themselves. But one must never lose sight of the purely hypothetical character of such attribution. This reservation is valid both for the ?language ? of ornamental motifs and for language in the usual sense of the word as the ar? ticulation of a system of conventional sounds ? perhaps more so for the latter. Both call for pru? dence in their interpretation. In any case, the que? stion of ethnic origins does not seem to affect vi? tally the problems of aesthetics and art history which constitute the main themes of this volume. The present study does not limit itself to the singular phenomenon of the consistent use of geo? metric ornamentation in the ceramic art of the area and epochs in question, but also examines other great currents of prehistoric art clearly beco? ming visible here. In fact, we are here in the presence of pri? mordial examples of that style which later was destined to become the famous ? style of the step? pes ?, the zoomorphic style. It is true that the adjective ? primordial? can only be used in this case cum grano salts insofar as the origins of the animal style of the steppes is lost in the mists of 237</page><page sequence="4">the remote times of the ?hyperboreal? hunters of the upper Palaeolithic Age. Yet we are here confronted with the well-known law of the deve? lopment of style, of perhaps universal validity, ac? cording to which geometrization carried to the last degree gives birth, one might almost say ? dia lectically ?, to a flowering of more or less stylized zoomorphic motifs. ?Particularly remarkable is the fact that already the oldest pottery makers make use of... zoomorphic subjects ?, the Author affirms. Then he goes on to identify the preferred animal subject as the wild goat, drawn schemati? cally and limited to its essential characteristics. It is unnecessary to remind our readers here that a veritable Pleiad of highly regarded international scholars (among whom need only be mentioned B.A. Litvinskij, K. Jettmar, P. Snoy, G. Tucci) has recently succeeded in identifying in the ? goat com? plex ? the peculiar mythico-religious conception of High Asia. So here we have this intuition newly confirmed in the artistic and iconographic context sketched by the present specialist. To cite only one other zoomorphic element identified by the Author of this excellent little book, it seems to us that he has also suceeded in identifying one of the oldest drawings of the horse (on a potsherd found at Kara-tepe). ? We are now in a position to affirm without fear of contradic? tion that the south Turkmenistan people were fa? miliar with this animal as far back at least as the first half of the 4th millennium B.C. ?. We have already referred to this site of Kara tepe, which has proved to be one of the richest in the entire area, particularly for geometric pot? tery (cf. illustrations, on pp. 63-65, zoomorphic de? signs on p. 67, and anthropomorphic motifs on p. 72, etc., all from the 3rd millennium). With this latter element, after the two great currents already summarily dealt with ? the geometric and the zoomorphic ? we find ourselves in the pre? sence of the third great strand of the art history of our zone (and not only of this area): the anthro? pomorphic element. This is already represented by a specimen which we do not hesitate to qua? lify as artistically perfect. It is a little feminine statue which it would not be an exaggeration to call the ? Venus of Milo of prehistoric Turkmeni? stan ? (4th millennium), so much does it evoke the classical forms, and so different does it ap? pear from those female idols like the steatopygian ? Venus of Willendorf ? whose gross forms seem to be fatally linked with the prehistoric concep? tion of femininity. It seems to us to be of ex? treme interest from the point of view of the hi? story of art as well as from that of aesthetic theo? ry in general, that such realistic-idealistic transfigu? rations of the female body as the Kara-tepe ? Ve? nus ? can co-exist (if we may be pardoned this fashionable term) with the traditional manner of seeing and shaping similar terracotta figurines ? evidently charged with magico-religious significan? ce - which fill the museums of the whole of Eu? rasia. The Author contrasts the statuette of Kara-tepe with another contemporary figurine found at Daslydzi-tepe (p. 24; cf. also those illustrated on pp. 34, 35, 47, 48, 73, 94, 95, etc.). Were it not for the fact that we know the Author of this pu? blication, Prof. Sarianidi, as one of the most se? rious and well-trained field-archaeologists, we should be frankly tempted to consider our ? Ve? nus ? as a product of an epoch later by some mil? lennia, if not Graeco-Roman, then at least ? Gan dharian ?. In any case, the ? co-existence ? of two such discrepant stylistic and spiritual worlds ? the Author speaks vaguely of certain influences emana? ting from the south, in the last analysis from far off Susiana, without stating precisely the missing links in this hypothetical connections ? raises some fundamental problems of interpretation which ob? viously cannot be dealt with in this all too sum? mary review. The successive phases of the prehistoric art of southern Turkmenistan seem to be also domina? ted by a dialectical dynamism between the three major currents analyzed by our Author. The artist? ic, and therefore the spiritual reality of this zone of Central Asia is conceived as being constituted of a complex of contrasting yet supplementary for? mative forces. The resulting picture is more convincing (in spite of the various lacunae and question marks which we have in part pointed out) than that traced in some much more voluminous publica? tions than the present opuscule.
