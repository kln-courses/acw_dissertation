Cyp ?20.00. The archaeology and "ancient art" of Cyprus are more prominent today in scholarly and public circles than one would expect for this island set in the middle of the tradi- tional ancient "power regions" of the Levant, Egypt, Ana- tolia, and the Aegean basin. The untiring efforts on all fronts over the past four decades by Vassos Karageorghis, as Director of the Department of Antiquities of the Repub- lic of Cyprus, as professor at the University of Cyprus, and now as the "public face" of the most generous A. G. Leventis Foundation have brought this to pass almost single-handedly. This lavish volume under review is one of the latest Karageorghis/Leventis efforts to present and to publish the Cypriote "antiquities" in foreign museums. As many of the objects in this catalog have not seen pre- vious publication, interested scholars will appreciate the collective effort represented here to document at last these items. The 1200+ objects in the Cypriote collection of the An- tikensammlung migrated by various means to Berlin start-</page><page sequence="2">2003 BOOK REVIEWS 103 ing in 1845, according to S. Brehme. Direct and indirect purchases from Cyprus, the acquisition of small German collections, and the consolidation of Cypriote materials from other German museums were the primary means of assembling the collection over the years. Material from the excavations conducted by the legendary Max Ohnefalsch- Richter at innumerable sites on the island, especially in and around the Iron Age kingdom center of Tamassos, was another important source. The aftermath of World War II dispersed the collection temporarily. After the reunifica- tion of Germany in 1992 the collection was reassembled in one place. In advance of the unification of this collection with that of the Museum fUir Vor- und Frtihgeschichte (in- fra) in the A. G. Leventis Gallery of the yet to be built "Neues Museum," this catalog represents the "best" ob- jects in the two collections. The Cypriote coins in the Miinzkabinett are included as well. The objects that constitute the collection of the Mu- seum fUr Vor- und Friihgeschichte have a convoluted history, as M. Br6nner relates. The bulk of the Cypriote material in the museum came from the excavations and personal collecting of Ohnefalsch-Richter. In 1896 he sold his private collection to the Berlin banker V. Weisbach. Shortly afterward this collection was transferred to a local museum in Leipzig. The bombing of this museum in De- cember 1943 resulted in the total destruction of the bronze, lead, glass, gems, and jewelry. What remained of the col- lection required extensive conservation and restoration. The volume begins with a survey of the present state of Cypriote archaeology as seen from the personal per- spective of Karageorghis. Since Ohnefalsch-Richter is the source of much of the material in both collections (and elsewhere), the informative biography by Brehme is most welcome. Inasmuch as 45 of the 216 objects described in the catalog are limestone sculpture from the Archaic through Hellenistic periods, Brinner contributes a short but succinct overview of this important class of material dedicated in the island's sanctuaries. The material in the catalog is divided chronologi- cally into four periods: "Early-Middle Bronze Age," "Late Bronze Age," "Cypro-Geometric Period," and "Cypro- Archaic, Cypro-Classical and Later Periods." Within each "period" the material is subdivided into material/artifact types. Karageorghis is responsible for the pottery and ter- racotta figurines. G. Platz-Horster describes the seals and jewelry. Brinner discusses the only complete burial as- semblage from a Cypro-Geometric I tomb in the Sotiros quarter of Larnaca and the limestone sculpture in the Antikensammlung. The stone objects, metalwork, and the limestone sculpture in the Museum fuir Vor- und Friihge- schichte are dealt with by Brehme. B. Weisser describes the seven "large denomination" Cypriote gold and silver coins from the Miinzkabinett and puts them into their proper numismatic contexts. The catalog entries are neither superficial nor in-depth. The metrical information is minimal, however. All of the objects are illustrated in high-quality photographs, many of them in color. A few objects are supplemented by draw- ings. The references to the comparanda are very basic in most cases. The heavy semi-gloss paper and the strong binding (with a loose jacket) mean that this volume can stand much use. A standard chronological table and a map with the location of the sites mentioned in the volume make it user-friendly for the non-Cypriote specialist. Con- cordances, a bibliography, and an index of provenience conclude the volume. The objects in this catalog illuminate very effectively the nature and most important trends of Cypriote "art" from the Early Bronze Age to the Hellenistic period. The wide range of sites represented by the objects is another special feature. For these reasons this material could be used as a teaching collection. However, the absence of ma- terial from the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods, Philia culture, a wider selection of Late Bronze Age ceramic wares and shapes as well as bronze objects, and Early Iron Age Phoenician and Greek ceramic imports limits the breadth and depth of the collections. The circumstances and time during which most of the material was acquired can account for these limitations. A number of the objects in the catalog have a poten- tially wider audience. These include an 18th century B.C. Middle Syrian haematite cylinder seal with animal friezes (no. 22); the upper part of a zoomorphic Base-Ring II jug with three bulls' heads (no. 31); an LC IIIB Proto-White Painted amphora decorated with a homed animal from Lapithos (no. 33); a C-G I Bichrome I high-stemmed "feeding bowl" with a molded "toad" in the tondo and a bull-protome spout (no. 37); an LC IIIB/C-G I bronze four-sided wheeled stand for a cauldron decorated with antithetical sphinxes flanking an Ionic-style column from Kition(?) (no. 47); a C-G I White Painted I large amphora decorated with homed animals and other pictorial motifs (no. 55); four C-A I Bichrome IV "free-field" jugs with interesting iconography (nos. 68-71); a C-A I Bichrome Red I (IV) anthropomorphic jug with a priestess(?) walk- ing in a garden(?) from Idalion (no. 74); a fourth-century B.C. limestone colossal female head with a turreted crown from Salamis (no. 173); a sixth/fifth-century B.C. lime- stone Aeolic-style pillar capital from the eastern acropolis of Idalion (no. 180); a C-A II limestone Hathoric capital from the acropolis of Amathous (no. 181); a C-C I lime- stone funerary monument with a carved animal and relief decoration from Golgoi [Athienou] (no. 182); a C-A 11II decorative bronze mounting of a scepter(?) from Tamassos (no. 184); and a C-A I/II "Tamassos type" bronze helmet from Tamassos (no. 185). In the end, what is the value of a book such as this? The careful documentation of museum collections formed from objects "excavated" in the 19th century with mini- mal or no documentation (at least extant today) of such variables as site, exact location within it, and archaeolog- ical context is certainly a laudable exercise for posterity.</page><page sequence="3">104 BOOK REVIEWS BASOR 330 The fact that in some cases there is minimal documenta- tion for the grave offerings means that burial assemblages can be reconstructed in some fashion after the dispersal and/or destruction of the assemblage. Given the extensive looting and/or modern destruction of many sites over the past 150 years, this is the only means available today to document such sites. Thus, catalogs such as the one here under review serve as a basic archive for scholarly inves- tigations of the material classes/"art" represented in these collections. Stylistic and iconographical studies could uti- lize this material too. Despite the high value for price ratio that this volume offers, it is unlikely that many scholars, even those inter- ested in Cypriote "art," will purchase it. In essence, this volume will probably serve only as a library reference work. David W. Rupp Brock University drupp @spartan.ac.brocku.ca</page></plain_text>
