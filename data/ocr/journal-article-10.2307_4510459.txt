In conclusion, there is still scope for much more work along this line. We know nothing as yet about subspecific or sexual differences. It is known that nestlings have eventually stouter legs than adults but we know nothing certain about actual sizes or changes with age. I think it probable that most nestlings at banding age will require bands one size larger than those given in Table III. As far as we can go now there is no substitute for good judgment in the selection of band sizes. REFERENCES MICHENER, HAROLD 1947 Band size determination. Bird-Bandiing, 18: 77-79, 1 fig. PARKS, G.

GENERAL NOTES Leg color of Blackpoll and Bay-breasted Warblers.-Peterson (Field Guide to the Birds, 1947, p. 201) states as a distinction between these two warblers that the Blackpoll has yellowish legs and the Bay-breast blackish ones. This puzzled me because a considerable proportion of the fall birds I have handled which gave no evidence of being Bay-breasts had, however, tarsi which were mostly dark brown. Three "text-book" Bay-breasts handled this fall had gray or dark gray legs. The toes are almost the same color as the tarsi. The gray is sometimes lighter than the brown of the Blackpoll. The position seem.s to be that the Black- poll has yellow legs with the tarsi more or less obscured by dark brown. In ex- treme cases there may be no brown. At the other extreme only the ridge of the posterior lamella (less than 1 mm. wide) and the sides and soles of the toes may be light. The real difference is brown versus gray. Field observers will have to draw their own conclusions.-Charles H. Blake, Mass. Institute of Technology, Cambridge 39, Mass. Six-year-old Tree Swallow.-Tree swallows (Iridoprocne bicolor), in my experience, are rather short-lived birds. During the past eleven years up to this summer only one has returned the fifth year after banding. On June 18, 1953, however, I trapped my second return-5. Banded on July 6, 1948, as an adult male, this bird has returned every year since, being taken this year on June 18. Thus he was then at least six years old.-William P. Wharton, Groton, Mass.

In celebration of the 60th birthday of Dr. Rudolf Drost, Director of Vogelwarte Helgoland, the spring 1953 number of Die Vogelwarte is a jubilee issue. Germany has two major ornithological stations, the functions of which are somewhat similar to those of the Patuxent Research Refuge. Vogelwarte Helgoland and Vogelwarte Radolfzell are not only national banding centers, but also conduct and direct studies on migra- tion, ecology and conservation of birds. This paper deals with German banders, tabulates the walks of life from which they come, and attempts to answer the question, "Why do they band?"-Frances Hamerstrom.</page><page sequence="2">V954 Recent Literature [17 2. Trapping and Banding Operations, Lara Lake, 1952. J. McNally and D. D. Falconer. 1953. Emu, 53(1): 51-70. Describes in detail the first season's activities of the waterfowl banding program initiated by the Fisheries and Game Department, Victoria, Australia. Traps and trapping techniques were adapted from those developed and currently in use in the U. S. A battery of portable, collapsible, square wire traps with funnel entrances was baited with wheat. In 7 weeks of trapping 3,481 ducks of three, species were banded, mostly Gray Teal (Anas gibberifrons), and lesser numbers of Black Duck (Anas super- ciliosa) and Maned Geese (Chenonetta jubata). Each bird was weighed when caught and examined for injuries and abnormalities. Search for external sexual differences was unsuccessful in all three species; lack of time and experienced personnel prevented sexing by cloacal examination. Interference by predators with trapping operations is discussed, and the daily totals of new birds and repeats taken are analyzed and correlated with meteorological conditions and the effects of periodic nearby shooting.-O.

The 71 Yugoslavian cooperators banded 2,802 birds in 1949, and 6,127 in 1950, totalling 94 species. More Goldfinches (Carduelis carduelis) were banded than any other species (2,698 in 1950). Greenfinch (Chloris chloris), Serin (Carduelis cannabina), Great Tit (Parus major), Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica), and Blackbird (Turdus merula) were the only others handled in significant quantities. The data for some 26 recoveries and 140 returns and retraps received during the period are listed in detail. The direction and distance are given for each recovery. An excellent practice, most helpful in locating small towns and villages that seldom appear on available maps, is that of including the coordinates with each locality men- tioned.-O. L. Austin, Jr. MIGRATION (See also number 30) 4. The Study of the Visible Migration of Birds. 1953, The Ibis 95(2): 165-354; 372-376. The introductory review by Sir Landsborough Thomson in this number of The Ibis provides a fitting master title for virtuially the entire con- tents of the issue. By "the visible migration of birds" is meant migration actually in progress, as evidenced by the observed flight of diurnal migrants through the sky. Contributions to this theme are made by four reviews (G. Svardson's "Visible migration in Fenno-Scandia" for Sweden and adjacent countries, W. H. van Dob- ben's "Migration in the Netherlands," D. W. Snow's "Visible migration in the British Isles," and R. E. Moreau's "Migration in the Mediterranean area") and by five papers based mainly on personal observations (D. and E. Lack's "Visible migration through the Pyrenees: an autumn reconnaissance," M. T. Myres' "Some observations on the autumn migration of hirundines through the Austrian Alps," E. J. M. Buxton's "Migration of birds observed in N. W. Germany 1942," J. K. Stanford's "Some impressions of spring migration in Cyrenaica March - May 1952," and R. E. and W. M. Moreau's "Migrants on the east coast of Spain.") Since their common ground is a method of study rather than attention to a specific central problem, these articles are rather diverse in content and varied in their degree of general interest. Nevertheless, they contain remarkably little contradiction and can be most coherently reviewed through a generalized summary along the lines of Thomson's excellent synthesis. Bird migration is fundamentally an adaptation to seasonal changes in food supply and to the seasonally changing demands of the species on that food supply. As the chief immediate stimulus to the departure of birds, Svirdson (speaking of Scandinavia) emphasizes falling temperatures and denies that pressure con- ditions (anticyclonic weather) have the importance once ascribed to them. Once on its way, each species tends to proceed in a "standard direction" pointing directly toward its ultimate destination or toward an intermediate way station. Thomson apparently considers this standard direction to be fixed as regards a</page><page sequence="3">18] Recent Literature January given population of a species. Van Dobben, on the other hand, cites some evi- dence that, in the case of adult migrants, it is an absolute homing faculty con- tinually directed toward a given spot, and varying in compass direction with lateral displacements of the bird. In any case, the standard direction naturally gives rise to a movement that is basically on a broad front, and nearly all the accounts contain visual evidence of this sort of movement. Certain kinds of birds, however, are reluctant to fly over certain kinds of terrain. When confronted with a formidable expanse of unfavorable habitat, they may veer temporarily from the standard direction to continue in a narrow, concentrated stream along the borders of the barrier. Topographical features causing such an effect are called "guiding lines" or "leading lines," though they do not lead the birds toward the goal but lead them away from it. Instances are variously alluded to in which river valleys, forest borders, and even low chains of hills have acted as leading lines; but the most spectacular results occur along the edges of the sea, where the phenomenon has given rise to the British term "coasting." This aversion of small land birds to over-water flight is often very marked; the Lacks report that solitary Blue Tits would not cross a bay only 3/4 of a mile wide until joined by other parties of migrants. Yet no one seems to doubt that almost all coasting birds do eventually break away from the leading line, even when the whole expanse of the Mediterranean lies before them. It is emphasized by van Dobben that an observer at a single location is apt to get an exaggerated idea of the importance of coastwise movements because he is in a position to witness the shoreline flight in its entirety but perceives the seaward departures at only one of the many points where they are taking place. Several factors modify the in- fluence of a leading line. Good weather, high elevation of flight, large numbers of birds on the wing, and drastic departures of the topographic path from the standard direction-all lessen the tenderncy of migrants to be deflected from a direct passage out over the sea. Birds tend to fly higher with tail winds, lower with head winds. Thus, favoring air currents also lessen the leading line effect. Since about one-third of the summer bird population of Europe winters in Africa south of the Sahara, literally millions of birds must possess standard directions that extend across the Mediterranean. Yet many species known to migrate to Africa in large numbers have hardly ever been recorded on migration over that sea. Among the more commonly observed trans-Mediterranean migrants, there is, however, in the opinion of Moreau, no evidence of a tendency to favor the short crossings, except in the case of soaring birds, which concentrate at the Straits of Gibraltar and the Bosphorus. Visible migration has been noted over the widest part of the Mediterranean, where the shore-to-shore distances approximate those involved in a flight across the Gulf of Mexico. The difficulties of most trans- Mediterranean migrants are complicated by the position of the Sahara, which makes necessary a passage over several hundred miles of desert immediately fol- lowing or preceding the sea crossing. Nevertheless, the work of Stanford in Cyrenaica, on the North African coast, supports Moreau's idea that the movements are on a broad front. In general, visible migration exhibits daily time-patterns that are the opposite of those apparent for nocturnal migration in America. Pronounced activity in the hours immediately following dawn is widely noted, and Svardson presents tabular data demonstrating a second (late-afternoon) peak in summer for several species of early migrants. Later in autumn this afternoon peak is believed to become a nocturnal one. In contrast the Lacks report midday maxima for finches and Motacillidae passing at 7,500 feet through the Port de Gavarnie in the Pyrenees. These observers found several species crossing the mountains, even at this high elevation. Several of the papers contain observations interpretable as Riickzug, or true reversed migration. Thomson suggests that such performances can best be ex- plained as weather movements imposed upon the spring flights. The foregoing conclusions form an impressive structure, one that is in many respects highly convincing. They should provide a tremendous stimulus to new lines of inquiry on this side of the Atlantic. But, since studies of this type find their greatest productivity on the seacoast and since so much of our population lives so far from either ocean, the majority of our observers cannot engage in them so profitably. It is perhaps no accident that on this continent the large-scale cooperative investigation of visible migration has, aside from hawk counts, so far</page><page sequence="4">Vol. XXV Recent Literature [19 1954 followed a quite different approach, with a strong emphasis oii the direct study of nocturnal flight through telescopes trained on the moon. A cross check and an integration of the data accumulated here and abroad would be thoroughly interesting, since to a large extent the two approaches suffer from opposite deficiencies. The nocturnal technique usually cannot satisfactorily detect very low movements; the diurnal method used in the Ibis studies would probably not reveal very high movements. Some of the students of visible migra- tion have expressed concern regarding a possible invisible diurnal migration pass- ing high overhead, and it is not reassuring that nocturnal observations have demonstrated flights of tremendous magnitude beyond the reach of the unaided eye. While it would be rash to assume that the principles governing night migra- tion in America apply also to day migration abroad, the possibility is at least suggested that the whole architecture of European thinking regarding bird move- ments may be based upon experience with only part of the phenomena. Though this is a matter for consideration, it does not alter the fact that the study of visible migration, as reflected in these papers, has made, and is making, new sense out of manifestations that once seemed almost hopelessly contradictory.- R. J. Newman. 5. The Migration of the Sanderling (Crocethia alba (Pall.)) in Northern Europe. (Sandl0berens (Crocethia alba (Pall.) ) traekforhold i Nordeuropa.) L. Ferdinand. 1953. Dansk Ornithololgisk Forenings Tidsskrift, 47(2): 69-95. (From the English summary.) The author presents his extensive observations on the movements of Sanderlings in Denmark, particularly on the west coast, and summarizes from the literature the available information on the species' move- ments elsewhere in northern Europe and in the arctic lands from Greenland eastward to the Taimyr Peninsula. From these data he constructs a logical and convincing picture of the probable routes followed by the species between its breeding and wintering grounds. In the autumn the adult Sanderlings precede the young of the year southward. In western Denmark "adult birds in summer-dress begin to migrate about the middle of July. - . . They may be seen in summer-plumage a couple of weeks into August. After September 1st there are no safe records of adult birds in Denmark. The migration of the juvenile birds begins about 15th August.... From this time juvenile birds are predominant. The height of migration is reached the last week of August and first part of September, and then it slowly decreases towards the end of September and into October-November." Correlation of arrival and departure dates elsewhere suggests these birds are part of the flight from the Greenland and Spitsbergen breeding grounds, which strikes northern Europe from the British Isles to western Norway, moves down the coasts of the North Sea, and continues down the west coast of Europe, as is shown by southwestern recoveries of birds banded in autumn in southwestern Norway. A few stragglers occasionally winter in Denmark. The spring movement northward of this Greenland- Spitsbergen population is heavy, but not as concentrated. "From the end of March to the first days of July the Sanderling is a very common migrant along the west coast of Jutland." On the east coast of Denmark, facing the Baltic Sea, the Sanderling is not as plentiful, and its autumn flight arrives about a fortnight later. As the dates of these movements cannot be correlated with those of the western birds, but do agree with autumn records along the north and south coasts of the Baltic, these birds are believed to come from the north Siberian breeding grounds, probably following, "Palmen's classic route from the Siberian-Russian Polar Seacoast-across Onega and Ladoga-to the Gulf of Finland. As the species is very rare in spring along the Baltic, how birds from western Europe return to Siberia is un- known, if they do, unless they "travel very quickly and scatteredly across the European continent."-O.

Several palearctic birds were studied on their wintering grounds in Belgian Congo to determine the external and internal factors releasing the migratory urge. "The suggestion that the development of the gonads is stimulated by increasing length of</page><page sequence="5">20] Receat Literature January daylight cannot hold in a region where the light is constant. Probably also humid- ity and rainfall play a minor role as releasers of migration . . . because the climate of eastern Congo varies very little from day to day." Several races of the Yellow Wagtail from different breeding areas in Europe wintered together for several months in mixed flocks, subject to exactly the same ecological factors and external stimuli. "In spite of this the birds showed a very different gonadal development, different degrees of moulting and different dates of beginning migration. The explanation of this difference may be: 1. That southern populations of a species which are in a disposition to migrate are more sensitive to external stimuli than northern populations, in the same way as males are more sensitive than females, which has been shown by experiments. 2. That the inherent annual rhythm with its endocrinological activity is regulated by the pituitary, and that this cycle is variable in time in different populations; there may be an annual stimulation by environmental factors in the breeding areas. Or the internal cycle in birds func- tions in a rhythm which is established already at birth and which is automatically correlated with the seasonal variations."-O. L. Austin, Jr. 7. Contribution to the Knowledge of the Migration of the Starling (Sturnus vulgaris L.) in Croatia, Yugoslavia. (Prilog poznavanju seobe cvrljka sarenog u Hrvatskoj.) Konstantin Igalffy. 1952. Larus, 4-5: 32-46. (From the German summary.) The author analyzes the 20 recoveries obtained from the 787 Starlings banded as nestlings in Croatia (112 from 1910 to 1945, 675 from 1946 to 1952) and 16 recoveries from 512 banded in neighboring Slovenia, all but four of them as nestlings. Also considered are nine Yugoslavian recoveries of Starlings banded elsewhere, one in Poland and eight in eastern Italy. The evidence indicates that the young Starlings migrate in the autumn southwestward from Yugoslavia to Italy and across the Mediterranean to winter on the coast of northern Africa. The Yugoslavian recoveries of Starlings banded in Italy-all eight banded in March 1931-1953 at a station near Ancona on the Adriatic coast-suggest the birds retrace the route northeastward in spring. It is of interest that not a single one of the Yugoslavian bandings was reported north or east of the Yugoslav border. One young Starling was recovered two years after banding; all the rest were re- ported in their first year. The longest flight was 2100 kilometers to Morocco. Two young banded in the same nest in June 1950 were recovered together 1300 miles distant at Constantine, Algeria, 15 February 1951.-O. L. Austin, Jr. 8. On the Orientation of Migratory Birds.

This review paper presents a summary of some of the earlier work in the fascinating field of "the orientation of migratory birds," and more importantly brings to French readers the excellent researches in Germany of Dr. Gustav Kramer and his associates.

The author has applied a careful mathematical analysis to the displacement experiments of Riippell and Griffin. The conclusion of this analysis is that the results are exactly what would be expected on the base of random search on the part of the displaced birds. The author hesitates to assert that bird navigation is necessarily this simple and prefers to state that nothing further than this can be deduced from the presently available data.-D. S. Farner. 10. Distribution and Migration of the European Starling in North America. Brina Kessel. 1953. The Condor, 55(2): 49-67. Since its establishment in New York City in 1890 and 1891, the European Starling had by 1952 expanded its range in North America to include southern Canada, the United States (except southern Florida), and extreme northeastern Mexico. It breeds only in the eastern and northern parts of its range from British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and Utah, to Mississippi and eastward. In areas where the species breeds in some numbers many are sedentary, others are migratory, and some apparently migrate in some years and not in others. In the southwest part of its range it still occurs</page><page sequence="6">Vol. XXV Recent Literature [21 1954 only in winter, when migrants move in from the north and east. Percentages of migratory and sedentary starlings in a given population vary with geographical locality, season of the year, and the type of aggregation studied. Banding data reveal that migratory routes are to some extent determined by topographical fea- tures, although a general tendency toward migration on a northeast-southwest axis is evident. The irregular movements of juvenal, first-year, and second-year starlings which have not yet bred, and their later random selection of breeding areas, seem to provide the mechanism whereby the species has extended its range in North America. Adults, however, which have once bred in an area, apparently return to breed in that same area year after year. Attention is directed to certain "inadequacies in the North American banding data, principally the failure of bird-banders to distinguish at the time of banding between first-year starlings and adults." These inadequacies have prevented a better understanding of the role of age in dispersion and migration. This useful summary clarifies several aspects of the distribution and migration of the European Starling in North America.-L. R. Mewaldt. POPULATION DYNAMICS (See also numbers 22, 37) 11. Population Studies on Hawks. (Populationsstudien an Raubvogeln). Victor Wendland. 1952. Journal fur Ornithologie, 93(2): 144-153. Through the course of a 12-year period the author obtained data on the breeding hawks of a 137 square kilometer tract of forest about 25 kilometers north of Berlin. Of par- ticular interest are the data on the Common Buzzard, Buteo buteo buteo. The breeding population of this species has remained quite constant at 28 to 30 pairs. Observations were made on 170 breeding pairs. The most frequent clutch size was two. The mean number of fledglings per successful pair per season was 1.41. The mean number of young produced per pair, all pairs included, was 0.91, ap- parently an adequate replacement for maintenance of a constant population, al- though immigration is not precluded. Production of young may be increased during years of abundance of rodents. In 1933, a good field mouse year, the production was 2.6 young per pair.-D. S. Farner. 12. Analysis of the Results of banding Starlings and Chaffinches in the Nest. (Verklaring der Ringintslagen Behaald op in-het-nest Geringde Spreeuwen (Sturnus vulgaris) en Botvinken (Fringilla coelebs). R. Verheyen and Geo. le Grelle. 1953. Le Gerfaut, 43(1): 34-38. (from French summary.) The Belgian population of Starlings is apparently static, the births balancing the deaths. Young- females breed in their second year. Approximately half the indigenous Starlings are sedentary, the remainder migratory. A few winter in southern England, but most of them in western France south to the Landes region. Both adults and young migrate equally. The mean age of 213 Starlings calculated from July 1 is 12 months. Analysis of returns from banded nestling Chaffinches suggests the species is entering a phase of expansion, which is corroborated by its establishing colonies near human dwellings. This is apparent in all regions where male Chaffinches are not caught in the spring and the broods removed systematically for breeding and show purposes. Because of these infractions of the law the Chaffinch is be- coming rare in southern Flanders and in the Walloon coal basin, despite its high rate of reproduction. The mean age of 92 Chaffinches calculated after August 1 is 13 months.-O. L. Austin, Jr. 13. The estimation of population parameters from data obtained by means of the capture-recapture method. III.

On the other hand Clethrionomys glareolus agrees excellently with the theoretical deterministic model on which the</page><page sequence="7">22] Recent Literature Bird-Banding January method is based. It is suggested that the parameters of some populations need to be checked by sampling methods which employ properties of the species other than those involved in the capturing methods in normal use.

Craig. 1953. Biometrika 40(1,2): 170-176. If one assumes that marked and unmarked individuals behave identically as regards recapture and that the population is stable, the author asks whether the number of recaptures of marked individuals can be used to estimate the total population. For the butterfly, Colias eurytheme, he arrives at quite satisfactory results by six different methods based on two mathematical models, a truncated Poisson distri- bution and Stevens' distribution function for groups.-C.

With a few simple assumptions the maxi- mum likelihood estimate of total population is derived for one of four possible cases.

Lars von Haartman. Die Vogelwarte, 16(4): 157-164. Adults bring food more frequently to nests having large numbers of young. Even if additional young (beyond the normal brood size) are introduced into the nest, feeding frequency continues to rise. Polygamy not infrequently forces the female to feed the brood alone and she feeds the young about as often as they would be fed by a pair. "Food re- quirements of the young are fixed, and in accordance with these, and within certain limits, the parental efforts are adjusted." This was established by experi- mental manipulation of the number of young in nests. The adjustment of feeding frequency is governed not by the number of young in the nest, but by their behaviour. Under ordinary circumstances, the introduction of extra young into the nest causes feeding frequency to rise slowly, but if very hungry young are intro- duced the number of feedings is accelerated almost immediately. Two experiments were set up to determine whether number of young or behaviour of young regulated frequency of feeding. A sliding drawer box was constructed so that nests could be slipped in and out from a blind. The box was kept re- plenished with two young. Fed young were removed and progressively hungrier young were substituted at intervals. Feeding frequencies increased until the occupants of the box were fed about as often as if the box had contained seven young.</page><page sequence="8">i954 Recent Literature [23 To test hunger calls as releasers, a two-compartment box was built. One compartment contained a single nestling; six hungry nestlings were shut up in the other, so that the adults could hear but not see them. The single nestling was offered more food than it could take. Its refusal to eat caused the adults to utter feeding cries, whereupon the six hungry young "increased their hunger concert." It is plain that hunger cries act as a releaser but their quantitative influence is not clear cut, as silent gaping also stimulates adults to feed the young. Hunger cries from the closed compartment also attracted free-flying young from other broods. This may be a mechanism holding broods together in the wild. Hunger cries may also be an adult form of greeting. The author suggests that infantile begging movements and cries, which are often part of greeting ceremonies or precursors of copulation, may have as their function the retardation of aggression or flight. This is an outstanding paper skillfully combining experimental and ecological approaches.-Frances Hamerstrom. NIDIFICATION AND REPRODUCTION (See also numbers 28, 29, 31, 34, 39) 19. The Shapes of Birds' Eggs. T. W. Preston. 1953. The Auk, 70(2): 160-182. The author comments that the problem of defining egg shapes ". . . be- comes one of finding a general equation suitable for all eggs, of expressing the facts in the simplest, most logical, and most convenient way, and of devising apparatus for measuring the eggs and deducing the constants." The present paper is confined to the mathematical aspects of this problem. A profile copying machine, specially developed for this study, was used to provide accurate outlines of the longitudinal section of eggs studied. Formulae are provided which allow the description of the shape of the egg in mathematical terms. A comparison of ob- served and calculated values is provided for 24 species. Biological implications of this study are to be presented in a later publication. The author-perhaps with tongue in cheek-lapses into highly anthropomorphic phraseology when dis- cussing the "ingenuity" of the Murre and the "skill" of the Lapwing in fitting their eggs to his formulae.-J. C. Dickinson, Jr. 20. Calculation of Egg Volume Based on Loss of Weight During Incu- bation. Edvard K. Barth. 1953. Auk, 70: 151-159. It is pointed out that the existing formulae for egg volumes based on linear measurements are only approxi- mations (see No. 19 above). The author wished to determine the volume accurately as a base for finding the change in specific gravity during incubation from loss of weight. Observations on the eggs of Larus canus show uniform rate of weight loss until the chick starts to pip the shell, when the rate increases and accelerates until hatching. Hence the specific gravity can be used to estimate the time the egg has been incubated. The author estimates the egg volumes when the egg just floats. This method is independent of shapes. More generally, the volume may be determined by displacement at any time before the egg floats. In the laboratory this may be done very accurately. In the field weighing at specific gravity of 1 is more accurate. The author gives constants for determining the egg volumes for several species from the egg weights after known amounts of incubation.-C. H. Blake. 21.

Data from about four thousand nests are presented in tabular form by species and subspecies. Records from areas below 1,500 meters in elevation are tabulated separately from those obtained in mountainous areas above 1,500 meters. The date of the observation (or inclusive dates when several observations are lumped together), locality, and number of eggs or young are recorded for each species.

LIFE HISTORY 28. Nesting Life and Behavior of the Red-eyed Vireo. Louise de Kiriline Lawrence. 1953. Canadian Field-Naturalist, 67(2): 47-77. An li-year study of Vireo olivaceus in 16 acres of woods in central Ontario, particular attention having been paid to nine special pairs. Table I gives first arrival dates (ranging from May 1, 1942 to May 24, 1948) in relation to temperature and weather. "In 10 out of 11 years, the first arrival dates were preceded or accompanied by warm weather and SW winds. In 1948, cold weather was evidently the cause of a delayed first arrival date in this locality. . . . The territory was divided into two parts, one the 'song-area' used especially by the male and the other the 'nest-area' prin- cipally belonging to the female. The average size of a territory in a crowded year (1949) was 1.4 acres and in a year with fewer pairs (1950) 2.1 acres." A vivid description is given of a male's obtaining a mate from a flock of passing migrants through a "spectacular pursuit in loops and circles through the under- brush," all in silence until the very end when the mating note was given. The female soon began examining nesting forks, attended by the male, who courted</page><page sequence="10">Vol XXV Recent Literature [25 her with display and a "mellow continuous warbled song, containina exquisite variations of the vireo themes." Choosing the nest site and building the nest- both exclusively female activities-are described. Incubation lasted 12 to 14 days and was performed entirely by the female. "The attentiveness of 5 females averaged 76 percent; the average of 38 attentive periods of 4 females was 29.2 min. and of 46 inattentive periods 9.9 min." p. 75. Table 6 shows that average periods on the nest "were shortened by 30.7 percent in response to a rise in temperature of 15 degrees F. and the inattentive periods lengthened by 23.6 percent." The male never came to the nest during incubation but maintained contact with his mate by his constant singing; he called her off the nest and fed her during her recesses. "As soon as the young hatched, the female carried away the eggshells. This appeared to be the signal for the male to visit the nest, soon after which he brought his first meal." The nestlings were fed three times as often by the female as by the male. They left the nest on the 10th or 11th day and were fed by the parents for 25 or 30 more days, during which time they completed the juvenal molt, "which did not involve flight and body feathers." In 30 nests 98 eggs were hatched and 59 young fledged, 60 percent of success. Much study was devoted to the song with "its subtile variations and full-toned beauty." It is "influenced by individuality, time in the nesting cycle, and the purpose of the song. Some males were much faster and more persistent singers than others. The longest and most continuous sessions of singing, irrespective of the time of day, occurred after incubation began until about one or two weeks after the young fledged in July. In 4 males, there was a virtual cessation of singingf during the post-nuptial moult, averaging 21 days. During August nearly all the singing was territorial and rnainly due to the passing of migrants through the territories. One courtship-song and 4 variants on the songf phrase theme were recorded, as well as 7 call-notes." This is a notable paper, the only intensive and extensive study that has been made on a vireo. To my mind the most original contributions are the facts ascer- tained concernin, the song of the species and the insight given into the relations between the sexes. Based on keen and conscientious observation and sympathetic interpretation, and beautifully written, it is a distinguished example of a life history study.,M. M. Nice. 29. The History, Behaviour, and Breeding Biology of the St. Kilda Wren. Edward A. Armstrong. 1953. The Auk, 70(2): 127-150. The author of this in- teresting paper was fortunate enough to spend seven hours on the Island of Hirta in the St. Kilda group. These islands lie about 50 miles west of the Sound of Harris in the Outer Hebrides and are relatively inaccessible. The literature has been reviewed and Armstrong feels that, opinions to the contrary, the bird has never been near extinction. Evidence is presented which indicates that population size has fluctuated considerably. The author feels, on the basis of his and other workers' observations, that the sexual food territory concept is not proved. Data concerning, the breedinng cycle are presented; comparisons between this race, Troglodytes troglodytes hirtensis and others, T.t.fridariensis, T.t.zetlandicus and T.t.troglodytes are made. The breeding. behaviour and biology of the St. Kilda Wren are assessed as being more closely allied to those of other northern insular races than to those of T.t.uroglodytes. The monogamous habit of T.t.hirtensis is attributed to a pioneer existence with food supply as the critical factor. Obser- vations on: the habitat, song, display, pair bond, nest building, nest lining, eggs, nestling period, food brought to nestlings, nest sanitation, fledging, dispersal, mortality and predation are included.

Woodlark, Lullula arborea, parents "collapsed into distraction display" before a mounted Garrulus glandarius; Warblers, Sylvia communis and Phylloscopus sp. mobbed it; while Thrushes and Red-backed Shrikes, Lanius collurio, attacked it. Thus none of the small birds investigated risked contact with a Jay. The larger ones try to attack from behind. Sometimes a Jay "will counter-attack vigorously. I suspect that this occurs when it has either seen the nest or realizes that there is one nearby. Then, from the Jay's viewpoint, the situation changes from 'thrush making unpro- voked attack' to 'thrush trying to rob me of my food' and naturally provokes ag- gressive feeling. . . . One can understand the biological utility of the tendency many parent birds show to defend fledglings more vigorously and noisily than they do callow young. The latter are almost certainly doomed if the nest is dis- covered whereas even if one fledgling is lost the others may jump overboard and escape into hiding if the predator's attention can be distracted while they do so." The author feels sure that even where the Jay population is very dense as in his home area, it is not a menace to the avifauna as its ability to find nests is not great.-M. M. Nice. 34.

Brouwer. 1953. Die Vogelwarte, 16(4): 167-170. Mass die-offs of oceanic birds from oil have occurred over a forty year period, but for- tunately the dire predictions of 1925 have not been fulfilled. On the Netherlands cQast there have been six catastrophic die-offs, the last of which occurred as recently as 1950. Fortunately oil pollution does not seem to have increased in proportion to the increase in numbers of oil-burning ships, perhaps in part because of better disposal practices, and partly because the earlier ships which had been converted to oil (and alternately used oil and water ballast) are gradually being replaced by modern oil burners. Maintenance of oil-free beaches is no real solu- tion to the problem unless good oil disposal facilities are available in major harbors to prevent dumping in the open ocean. Bird species affected are tabulated on a percentage basis, and international attempts to alleviate pollution are given chronologically.

A Study of Waterfowl Production on Artificial Reservoirs in Eastern Montana. Richard H. Smith. 1953. Journal of Wildlife Management, 17(3): 276-291. Data on physical characteristics, vegetation, and waterfowl production were gathered on 124 of the estimated 40,000 artificial ponds in eastern Montana during three summers, 1949-1951. Ponds were classified into five size classes and five communities of vegetation, which are well described and represented by good photographs. Surface areas averaged 3.2 acres per pond. Aerial counts showed that Mallard, Anas platyrhynchos, comprised 43 percent; Pintail, Anas acuta, 18 percent; and Blue-winged Teal, Anas discors, 18 percent of 1,066 birds identified to species. Classification iof 2,539 waterfowl by vegetative type and size of pond revealed that without exception the average usage increased with size of pond within each individual vegetative type, the differences being significant to the 1 percent level. The meadow type of vegetation, predominately Spike Rush, Eleo- charis machrostachya, and American Bulrush, Scirpus americanus, was used on the average more than the other communities, but differences were not significant at the 5 percent level. The same re.lationships held for brood production; in ad- dition it was noted that the "open" type of vegetation with little nesting cover produced the least broods. As a result of the establishment of artificial ponds, areas devoid of water habitat in the past now produces an average of almost two ducks per square mile. Although this figure appears small when the large area involved is considered, it becomes highly significant in terms of the total increase in production of waterfowl in eastern Montana.-Helmut K. Buechner. 37. Roadside Drumming Counts, A Spring Census Method for Ruffed Grouse. Walter H. Petraborg, Edward G. Wellein, and Vernon E. Gunvalson. 1953. Journal of Wildlife Management, 17(3): 292-295. Ten drumming counts of Ruffed Grouse, Bonasa umbellus, were made at 1-mile intervals along each of three 10-mile census routes located in each of six game-management areas. Three counts were made along each route between 5:00 a.m. and 8:00 a.m. during each of the four years, 1949-1952. The radius of audibility was determined to be an average of one-eighth mile. The 10 stops along each 10-mile route thus represented an area of 0.491 square mile. Apparently warm, bare ground stimulates the start of drumming more than any other factor, according to these authors. Peaks of drumming occurred between April 15 and May 30, and varied as much as 2 weeks between years, depending upon weather conditions. An interesting tabulation of the statistics shows that the population density nearly doubled between 1949 and 1952, and reached a high of 105 birds per square mile in 1952, compared with 14 per square mile during the low in population level in 1945. Apparently the trends in population level can be determined through roadside drumming counts. How- ever, more confidence could be placed in the method and statistics if an analysis of variance (to which the data lend themselves beautifully) had been applied, assuming that the results had supported the contention that the method is satis- factory.-Helmut K. Buechner.</page><page sequence="13">28] Recent Literature January 38. Effects of Starvation on Wild Mallards. James S. Jordan. 1953. Journal of Wildlife Management, 17(3): 304-311. This appears to be the first study on the effects of undernutrition on wild waterfowl. At average weekly temperatures between 26.1° and 35.6°F, a group of 10 adult male Mallards, Anas platyrhynchos, was fed a starvation diet 28 percent of "normal." Five drakes succumbed during the fourth week with an average loss of 47.2 percent of original body weight. In another experiment 10 adult males and 10 adult females were penned separately and deprived of access to all food for 25 days. Air temperature averaged 57.2°F. The pattern of weight loss in hens differed from drakes only in the last four days of starvation, when the percentage of average weight loss was less for the hens. Despite the similarity of the pattern, hens showed a much greater resistance to starvation. The over-all mortality rate in drakes was double that for hens, and during the last four days the rate was three times that in hens. As the longer survival period in hens did not result from an increase in percentage of original weight lost at the time of death, and a decrease in the hourly weight loss did not occur until late in the experimental period, it is concluded that hens have greater reserves of energy to draw upon during the foodless period, probably in greater fat storage. Possibly there was also a greater decrease in metabolic rate in hens during the last four days of the starvation period. It should be noted that this sex-related survival differential occurred during the breeding season. Critical body weights in drakes were reached during the third week. Two drakes died on day 18, five on days 24 and 25, and one on day 26. Only four hens had died by day 25. Surviving males lost an average of 43 percent of the original body weight; females lost 44 percent. Drakes that died lost 53 percent of the original weight; hens lost 56 percent. To test the ability to recover from the effects of starvation, the surviving two drakes and six hens were fed an unrestricted amount of commercial duck pellets for 28 days. At the end of this period all birds were in excellent health. No latent ill effects were noted after an interval of five months. Helmut K. Buechner. 39. Tolerance of Incubating Pheasant Eggs to Exposure. R. A. Mac- Mullan and L. L. Eberhardt. 1953. Journal of Wildlife Management, 17(3): 322-330. In this pioneering study of the effects of low temperature on incubating Ringneck Pheasant, Phasianus colchicus, eggs, three experiments were designed to test more than 90 combinations of stage of incubation, temperature, and length of exposure. They showed that: (1) eggs in early stages of incubation are much more tolerant to lowered temperatures than eggs in advanced stages of incubation, (2) little mortality occurs above 45°F (for 22nd-day eggs exposed to this tempera- ture the critical length of exposure lies between 8 and 10 hours), (3) high mor- tality occurs in eggs exposed between 5 and 6 hours at 32°F, and (4) survival is reduced as incubation progresses and as temperature is lowered. An exponential relationship between hours of exposure and incubation time is expressed by formula and shown in two graphs. The tolerance shown to low temperatures is considerably greater than popularly supposed. For much of the incubation period, tolerance is great enough so that widespread mortality from unseasonal cold spells is not likely to occur in the wild. Exposure to a steady shower of water (60°F) and soaking in water (68-72°F) for periods of less than 10 hours caused no significant mortality. Longer exposures resulted in high mortality. Survival was high in all cases of alternating chilling and incubation, which appears to be less lethal than continuous cooling. Newly hatched chicks are much more vulnerable to lowered temperatures than eggs in any stage of incubation. Two possible causes for widespread mortality that warrant further study are: (1) changes in habits of incubating hens during prolonged cold, wet weather, and (2) effectiveness of brooding and other factors that prevent prolonged exposure of newly hatched chicks to severe cold, especially in conjunc- tion with precipitation.-Helmut K.

Although data from 30 hunters secured during each of two seasons do not seem adequate as a basis for concluding that Bobwhite Quail, Colinus virginianus, are undershot in east-central Texas, they do support the con- tention. One bird per 39 acres was harvested during the 1950-1951 season, when the population density was one bird per 5.5 acres; and one bird per 90 acres was</page><page sequence="14">VolXXV Recent Literature [29 harvested during the 1951-1952 season, when the density was one bird per 12.2 acres. Hunting success was much lower in the latter season because extreme drought conditions hampered hunting. It is believed that as the Quail are under- harvested, more birds could be taken if the season were shifted from the current December 1 through January 16 to an earlier period, October 15 through November 30, when, juvenile mortality having had less time to operate, more birds would be available.-Helmut K.

Ordinarily "bird lice" are not found away from their hosts. The author states that apparently the genus Actornithophilus has a special predeliction for eggs. This statement appears to be based on examination of five birds' nests in which lice were found on the eggs. Of these five nests one had an unspecified number of lice on the eggs and the other four had respectively 2, 5, 3, and 1 louise. Apparently no attempt was made to investigate the number of lice on the incubating adults, so it is not clear to me how this "predeliction" was established.

This paper is a rather condensed review of the available knowledge of this rather neglected field in which the author has been one of the leading investigators. A general evalua- tion of the available knowledge indicates that there is a fairly useful body of data on hearing ability in several groups of birds with reasonable agreement among investigations using different methods. With respect to actual physiology the situa- tion is quite different. Only a scant beginning has been made toward understanding the function of the ear drum and the remainder of the sound-transmitting mech- anism of the middle ear. "The explanation of the mechanics of the inner ear, the electrical and chemical processes which occur in the basilar membrane and lead to stimulation of the fibers of the auditory nerve is still a wide-open field for the investigator." This paper will be extremely useful for anyone interested in any aspect of sensory physiology or behavior in birds.-D. S. Farner. 43. Precocious Sexual Development in the Juvenal English Sparrow. John Davis. 1953. The Condor, 55(3): 117-120. Three instances of precocious sexual development in juvenal male English Sparrows, Passer domesticus in June and July of 1952 in Los Angeles County, California are reported. Testes were enlarged (smallest 4 x 3 mm. and largest 6 x 4 mm.) and in "breeding" condition. Their juvenal plumage was worn and a few adventitious feather replacements were adult in type. The bills of two were black and the bill of the third was "noticeably darker" than that of a juvenal with small testes. The skufls of two of the birds were "completely unossified" and of the third "approximately one- fourth ossified." It is unfortunate that no reference was made to Robert W. Nero's paper (The Wilson Bulletin, 63(2): 84-88) on the pattern and rate of cranial ossification in Passer domesticus. Two additional instances of precocious sexual development in juvenal males are recorded from specimens in the University of California Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, collected in 1909 and 1914 by the late Joseph Grinnell in Berkeley, California. Birds which show such gonadal development in June and July are thought probably to have left their nests prior to 1 May. Although numbers of birds with precocious gonadal development are certainly not great in a given population, their occuirrence may be widespread, especially in warmer regions. The possible importance of this segment of the juvenal population to the experimental zoologist is discussed.-L. R. Mewaldt.</page><page sequence="15">Bird-Banding 30] Recent Literature January 44. Radiosurgery and Uptake of Radioactive Iodine by the Thyroid of the Oregon Junco. Robert E. Bailey. 1953. The Auk, 70(2): 196-199. This paper reports the results of experiments using iodine-131 for destroying the thyroid cells, and on the uptake and retention of a small dose of iodine-131 by the thyroid of Junco oreganus. For radiosurgery, three groups of four birds each were injected with 100, 200, and 400 microcuries of iodine-131 respectively. A group of four was maintained as a control and a single bird was injected with 50 microcuries. One bird from each group was autopsied 7, 18, 43, and 100 days after injection. A dose of 200 microcuries (or 12 microcuries per gram of body weight) was determined as the minimum level for destruction of the thyroid glands. It seems unfortunate that the results of this study were not contrasted with those of C. F. Winchester et. al. (Science l10: 302-304. 1949) who reported 6 milli- curies of I1.. per 100 grams (60 microcuries per gram) of body weight as the mini- mum dosage required for 100 percent destruction of the thyroids in New Hampshire chicks. The second phase of the present investigation showed that 80 percent of a single injection of 4.3 microcuries of I'31 was absorbed by the thyroids within 53 hours. By the fifth day only 20 percent was still present in these glands.-J. C. Dickinson, Jr. SYSTEMATICS 45. On Eastern Empidonaces with Particular Reference to Variation in E. traillii. L. L. Snyder. 1953. Contr. Royal Ontario Mus. of Zool. and Paleont., No. 35, pp. 1-26. A summary and comparison of the differences among Empidonax traillit, minimus, and virescens in size, color, pattern, shape, habitat, gregariousness, song, and nest (pp. 1-6) show non-morphological differences to be more striking than morphological ones. The remainder of the paper deals with variation in E. traillii, mainly east of the Rockies. The examination of 130 breeding specimens confirms the existence of two eastern forms: a northern one breeding from Nova Scotia across Canada to Alaska, and a more southern one which breeds from the Great Plains of the United States eastward on the prairie extension to New York. Difficulties in- volved in identifying Audubon's type subspecifically suggest the advisability of retaining the trinomial traillii for the southern form and applying alnorum to the northern one. Data on such striking non-morphological differences as seem to exist, particu- larly in voice and nest form, are brought together from the literature and un- published sources. The geographical distribution of these non-morphological differences appears to correspond to that of the known but much less obvious non-morphological characters of the two populations. Because of the striking non-morphological differences the author thinks it possible that ". . - one might consider that these forms of eastern E. traillii closely approach the threshold of specific difference." His treatment of them as subspecies seems wise, however, for the few available pertinent data indicate that the non-morphological differ- ences may be bridged by geographic intergradation. Much more information is needed to determine the geographical extent and constancy of such non-morpho- logical differences as voice and nest form.

Of great importance is the fact that the material extends from the middle Oligocene back as far as early Eocene, thus placing the origin of penguins considerably earlier than previously supposed. Interestingly, however, it is to be noted that the earliest fossils are so similar to recent species that they still cast no additional light on the phylogenetic origin of the order.-D. S.

The annotated list contains about 235 forms (including one hybrid) of which 61 are considered to be either of hypothetical occurrence or to have been recorded erroneously. The large number of distributional details are documented satisfactorily and include some interesting extensions of known ranges. Taxonomic notes are based on study of over 750 specimens collected; counts of individuals observed in the field are also given. The author, in addition to pre- senting a substantial amount of original information, has performed a useful service in bringing together and summarizing data from numerous published sources on an area that is of particular interest to taxonomists.-W.

A very interesting summation of "a colonization more spectacular than that of any other known land-bird." In the course of the last twenty years Streptopelia decaocto "has spread about 1,200 miles north-westerly across Europe from the Balkans, and has been observed at 468 different new places at least, at many of which it has become a resident breeder within a year or two of its first arrival." Three maps are included and a "selected" bibliography of nine pages.-M. M. Nice. 49. The Advance of the Ring-dove into northwestern and southern Europe. (Vordringen red Tiirkentaube nach Nordwest-und Siideuropa.) Jacob Huber. 1952. Larus, 4-5: 47-55. A recapitulation from the literature of the recent and interesting intrusion of the Ring-dove (Streptopelia decaocto) into Austria, Germany, Holland, Denmark, Poland, and Italy. (See also No. 48) In Switzerland, the author's homeland, only four doubtful records have so far been reported, three of these seen in bad light, and one only heard, between May 1948 and May 1950. -0. L. Austin, Jr. 50. The Ring-dove in Yugoslavia. (Grlica kumra u Jugoslaviji.) Dragutin Rucner. 1952. Larus, 4-5: 56-66. (From German translation, pp. 66-73.) The remarkable recent influx of the Ring-dove (Streptopelia decaocto) into Europe (see Nos. 48, 49) apparently began in the Balkans. This interesting paper traces the species' history in Yugoslavia, discusses its ecology, and theorizes on its spread. Prior to 1932 the Ring-dove was only of casual occurrence in Yugoslavia. About that time it began to gain a foothold in the eastern and southern sections of the country, and has gradually extended its range westward and northward until today it breeds commonly throughout entire Yugoslavia. The author believes its original success in the Balkans was enhanced by "ethnographic" factors, namely its pro. tection and cultivation by the large Turkish element of the population, who regarded it sentimentally as "a bird from home." The species adapts itself readily to new surroundings, but has had its greatest success in the urban areas. It nests in the tall trees in city parks, cemeteries, and around railroad stations, and seems as at home in the heavy traffic in the city centers as in the countryside where it is observed feeding over the fallow grain fields. Its spread was hampered at first by the nest predation of the jackdaws (Corvus monedula) with which it associated in the southeast. Once it established itself beyond the range of the Jackdaw it spread much more rapidly.-O. L. Austin, Jr. 51. The Occupation of Denmark by the Indian Ring-dove, Streptopelia d. decaocto (Friv.).

"The first Danish record dates back to 1948, the first breeding record to 1950. . . . The Ring-dove is now a common breeder in several localities in Jutland. . . . Everywhere it settles near human habitations and forages in cultivated fields near houses and farmyards. This ecological niche is almost unoccupied by granivorous birds of this size (ex- cept, of course, domestic fowl and doves). The faot that the Ring-dove does not virtually compete with the other species of wild doves may partly be responsible for its extremely rapid occupation of the European continent."-O. L. Austin, Jr. 52. The Nightingale and the Nutcracker in Franconia. (Nachtigall und Tannenhiiher in Franken.) Konrad Gauckler. 1953. Die Vogetwelt, 74(3): 91-97. Measures for Nightingale (Luscinia m. megarhyncha) protection were started "as early as 1487!" The range of this species has however shrunk enormously owing to the extirpation of brushy mixed hardwoods stands and the increase in conifer- ous plantations. The range of the Nutcracker (Nucifraga c. caryocatactes) on the other hand, has expanded with the man-made increase in conifers. Two excellent distribution maps give actual records. Those for Nightingales cover more than a hundred year perind.-Frances Hamerstrom.. 53. Checklist of New Zealand Birds. R. A. Falla, C. A. Flemming (con- vener), B. J. Marples, R. B. Sibson, R. H. D. Stidolph, and E. G. Turbott. 1953. Published for the Ornithological Society of New Zealand by A. H. and A. W. Reed, 182 Wakefield Street, Wellington. 10/6. This long-needed list includes not only the birds of the main and immediately adjacent islands but also those of Macquarie Island, Auckland Islands, Campbell Island, Antipodes Island, Bounty Island, Chatham Islands, and Kermadec Islands. The list is prepared on the tra- ditional basis, assigning a common name and number to each named form, whether subspecies or species. The 333 named forms include 259 species. Only subspecies and.species known definitely to have occurred wild since the coming of Europeans are admitted. The list contains nine forms now believed to be extinct and 35 introduced species. The inclusion of the New Zealand Pipit, Anthus novaesee- landiae novaeseelandiae (Gmelin), among the latter is obviously a typographical error. Although this list will be of very substantial usefulness per se it is quite likely that its major function may eventually be that of an indicator of the very extensive work which remains to be done on the systematics and distribution of New Zealand birds. In many instances the gaps in information are the obvious consequences of inadequate study collections, partly the result of well-intended but misguided legislation which has made the procurement of specimens for scien- tific purposes very difficult. It should be pointed out that, although the native New Zealand birds are of paramount concern, investigations of introduced species can contribute much of interest. Some of these species have been established in New Zealand for three quarters of a century; some have been self-introduced on adjacent islands. Careful studies of possible infraspecific variation among them might be fruitful.-D. S. Farner. SONG 54. Do MIigrants Sing in their Winter Quarters? (Les Migrateurs Chantent- ils dans leurs Quartiers d'Hiver?) R. Verheyen. 1953. Le Gerfaut, 43(1): 52-63. The pre- and post-nuptial behavior of several palearetic passerines wintering in Belgian Congo is quite parallel, the author believes, to that of many non-migratory species that remain in Europe. Males establish territories which they defend against intrusion by others of their kind, and in which they sing to attract a mate. The song on the wintering grounds is quite feeble, in fact might easily pass unnoticed, and the territories are less extensive as a rule than the breeding terri- tories in the north.-O. L.
