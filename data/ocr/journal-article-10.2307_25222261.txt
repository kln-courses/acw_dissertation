<plain_text><page sequence="1">R?in-ma-pa : the Early Form of Lamaism Hy LI AN-CHK R?I?-MA-PA is the early form of Lamaism or Tibetan Buddhism, as the name shows, but is popularly known as the Red Sect. The term " early " refers to Buddhism as introduced into Tibet before its destruction in the reign of King Glari-dar-ma (836-841). There is no difference between the exoteric Buddhism of the early and later periods. But in esoteric Buddhism, dependent upon direct instruction of the masters, there is a difference between the two. The early form and what has persisted since then is known as the " earlier translation " (s?a-hgyur) or R?i?-ma ; and what was reintro duced after that king's death is known as " later translation " (phyi hgyur), which branches out into diiferent sects such as the Sa-skya pa, the Bkah-brgyud-pa, and the Dge-lugs-pa, popularly called the Mixed-coloured, the White, and the Yellow. This paper is concerned only with the Red Sect. (1) Historical Background.?r?he Tibetans believe themselves to be the descendants of a monkey and a demon in female form, the transformed bodies of the God of Mercy (Avalokita or Spyan-ras gzigs) and the Goddess of Mercy (Tara or Sgrol-ma).1 The rulers, however, had Indian ancestry. A prince from India wandered to the top of the snow mountain Lha-ri-gyaii-tho, where twelve shepherds saw him descending the valley Btsan-than-sgo-bzhi. On being asked whence he came, the prince pointed upward. Imagining he came from heaven, the shepherds made him their king, carrying him home seated in a wooden seat on their shoulders. The name of this iirst king, is G?ah-khri-btsan-po, " the king seated on neck." Including him, seven kings had the name Khri included in their full names.2 During the reign of two later kings, popularly known as two De,3 armour and other weapons of war were invented together 1 Yon-tan-rgyn-mtsho's Ris-incd-chos-kyi hbyu?-guaa (Outline of Tibetan History of Huddhism). * (?l?alj-kliri blsnn po, IMu-khri blsan-po.

Then came kings known as ?Six Legs,1 Eight Lde,2 and Five Btsan.3 Except during the reign of the last nothing but Bonisrn was known.4 To Lha-tho-tho-ri came a foreboding of Buddhism when he was sixty years old. A box containing a golden pagoda and some magic formulas alleged to have come from heaven were brought to him by an Indian monk, Blo-sems-htsho. The contents were not understood, but worshipped as something mysterious (gnan-po gsaii-ba). After him reigned four other kings,5 the last Gnam-ri-sron-btsan. Altogether there were thirty-two kings, said to have reigned more than five hundred years. Called kings, they were chieftains ruling over small patches of vast grassland. Beginning with King Gnam ri-sron-btsan, the contact with Chinese cultures became so frequent that astronomy and medicine were introduced into Tibet. The king is reputed to have ridden back from a hunt with meat hung over his saddle. It fell into a salt-lick, which led to men taking salt with their food. If the advent of Buddhism was associated with Lha-tho-tho-ri, who was hiter acknowledged as an incarnation of " The All-Good Religious Body " (Samautabhadra or Kun-tu-bzan-po), it was formally introduced by King Sroii-btsan-sgam-po (569-650), an incarnation of the God of Mercy ; and its full development was furthered by Kings Khri-sron-lde-btsan (742-780) and Khri-ral pa-can (8M 830), incarnations of Ma?jusr? (IJjam-pahi-dbyans) or God of Wisdom, and Vajrap?ni (Phyag-na-rdo-rje) or God of Power respectively. It was King Sroii-btsan-sgam-po who married a Nepal princess and the Chinese Princess Wcn-ch'cng, the latter in 041 ; who sent people to India to learn Indian letters in order to invent a Tibetan 1 E co-legs, De-eo-legs, Thi co-legs, (?urn-legs, 1J broil-rje legs, 1 co-legs. 2 Za-nam-zin-lde.

During his reign Bonism adapted many Buddhistic writings, which were buried and made secret under the domination of Buddhism, but later were excavated as Bon scriptures. King Sron-btsan-sgam-po's grandson imported tea and porcelain from the interior of China, and his great-grandson, Khri-lde-gtsug brtan, married the Chinese Princess Cliin-ch'eng in 710. During the reign of the latter many Buddhist temples were built, but there was yet no monk properly ordained. Princess Chin-ch'eng gave birth to the famous king Khri-sroii lde-btsan. When he was young, some persecution of Buddhism was engineered by powerful ministers. But ?as soon as he gained control he had the persecutors killed ami the Bonists oppressed. Masters from India, namely ?inta-rakshita (Zhi-ba-htsho) and Padma-hbyuii-gnas (the Lotus-born) were invited to Tibet. The first monastery, Bsam-yas, was built in 7G2-0, and later seven Tibetan monks were ordained for the first time, a?nta-rakshita was a teacher, and Padma-hbyun-gnas a wonder-worker. Buddhism as an institution of religious instruction owes its foundation to ??nta-rakshita, who died in Tibet. But the wonder-worker became better known for his worsting the elements hostile to Buddhism, although he had to leave Tibet at the end of two visits which taken together did not last more than eighteen months. The sort of Buddhism then prevailing belonged to the Yog?c?rya Mah?y?na School, which was opposed both by the native Bonists and by the Chinese monks who were doing missionary work there ; by the former because it was a foreign importation ; by the latter 1 (I) One who kills is to he killed.

TIMO KARLV l'OKM OK LAMAISM I 45 because'it was too coloured with imsigc-worshipping and wonder working. But both were defeated in open debates. The Chinese monks were then driven out, and the Indian master Kamala-s?la, who came after the death of Santa-rakshita and defeated the Chinese monks, held sway over Tibetan religion. Khri-ral-pa-can followed his grandfather Khri-sroi?-lde-btsan in making territorial expansions and in favouring Buddhism. His aggressive attitude toward the Chinese emperor of the Tang Dynasty ended in the erection of a Monument of Peace in Lhasa, which is still extant. In addition to the standardization and promotion of Buddhist translations, a. large scale I urbanization of local institutions and the establishment of many temples and monasteries, Iks grouped the ordinary families into sevens, each seven to support one monk. Those who dared to call a monk names had their tongues cut. A finger was cut olf, if pointed at a monk with evil intention. If one stared at a monk in anger, one's eyes were gouged out. This king aroused so much opposition that he was murdered in 830. His elder brother, Glan-dar-ma, being installed in his stead, destroyed whatever Buddhism there was in Tibet. The K?i?-ma School of Buddhism embodies what was taught in Tibet before Gla?-dar-ma's reign (8,'W 841) and what has persisted since. Five or seven generations after Glan-dar-ma new masters went to India to study Buddhism and made new translations into Tibetan. The most important were Hiu-chen-bzan-po (970 ?), IJgrog-mi (992 ?), Mar-pa (1012-109(5), etc. A famous Indian master, A-ti-?a (982 1054), came to Tibet in 1042. This new wave of translations and reintroduction of Buddhism into Tibet gave rise to later schools, in contradistinction to the l?ni?-ma-pa or early school. (2) The Teaching of Rniii-ma-pa. Buddhism is divided into nine categories :? (a) For one who hearing the doctrine understands it (?an-thos pa) ; (/;) for perfection through one's own exertions without enlightenment through promoting the welfare of others (ran-sahs rgyas or the Solitary Non-teaching Buddha.) ; (c) for spiritual enlightenment like a Bodhisattwa (Byan-ehub-scms-dpah) ; {d) esoteric treatise on external performance (Bya-bahi-rgyud) ; (e) esoteric treatise on internal as well as external conduct (spyod pa-hi-rgyud) ; (/) esoteric treatise concerning the union with tlte Universal Spirit in meditation (rnal-hbyor-rgyud or yoga) ;</page><page sequence="5">146 R?1?-MAPA I TUE EARLY FORM OF LAMAISM (g) the Great Yoga (mah?-yoga) ; (//) the Anu-Yoga ; and (i) the ?ti-Yoga. The first two (a-b) are of the Lesser Vehicle (U?nay?na), all the rest of the Greater (Rlah?y?na). The former can only deliver the aspirant, the latter will save the many. Again, the first three (a e) are exoteric in the sense that everybody who wants to hear them is entitled to do so. All the others are esoteric, accessible only to the initiated. The first three (a-c) are said to have been delivered by S?kya-nmni, the incarnate Buddha or Transformation-body. The second three (d-f) are esoteric externally, delivered by the Dis pensation-body or Vajra-sattva (rdo-rje-sems-dpah). The last three (g-i) are esoteric internally, delivered by the Law-body or Samantabhadra (kun-tu-bza?-po). Of the six categories of esoteric Buddhism, three are externally so because they are shared by other sects of Lamaism, while the other three are internally so because they. are particularly characteristic of the K?i?-ma-pa. Their essential methods of attain ment are characterized by the utilization of what is otherwise generally discarded, such as anger, lust, and what belongs to the material body. The material body is generally considered a shackle, a source of evil, or something to be dreaded by the spirit. But here it is taken as a profitable means to help the spirit in its enriched life of perfection. To this end there are three classes of teaching. First, the " transformed ", equivalent to the Great Yoga. It is believed that everybody has within himself what is identical with the Buddha (Enlightenment). But because of ignorance and prejudice one becomes embedded in entanglements. By means of mentally creating the images of the tutelarles, however, one may become identified with them (union or Yoga), so that the impure are purified, and in the state of meditation thus resulting the arteries and other parts of the body are released to such tin extent that there arise happiness, light, and thoughtlessness. This sort of teaching is further divided into Treatise (rgyud-sde; and Methodology (sgrub-sde). The Treatise includes such works as The Serene and Angry in Transformation (sgyu-hphrul-zhi-khro) and The Nucleus of Mysticism or the King of Treatises (rgyud-rgyal-gsa?-ba-s?i?i-po). There are fifty-eight tutelary gods of serene manifestations and forty-two of anger, making a total of " one hundred most supreme serene and angry tutelaries " (zhi-khro-dam-pa-rigs-brgya).</page><page sequence="6">IININ-MA-PA : THE EAJRLY FORM OF LAMAISM 147 Methodology is composed of the practical measures on the basis of the Treatise. The practice embodied in the worship of the Eight Tutelaries (sgrub-pa-bkah-brgyad) constitutes the eight methods of attainments. The Eight Tutelaries arc as follows :? The Body of Maftju?r? (a) with an altar (hjam-dpal-skuhi-lha) symbolized by a dark yellow triangle (a) with an altar symbolized by a dark blue triangle [a) with an altar symbolized by a greenish triangle 2. The Word of the Horse-headed Lord (padma-gsiiii-gi-lha) 3. The True Intention (ya?-dag-thugs-kyi Iha) 4. The Klixir Merit (che-mchog-yon-tan gyi-lha) The Diamond Pike Deed (pbur-pa-phrin-las Iha) The Demon-sending Lord (a) with an altar symbolized by a dark brown triangle (a) with an altar symbolized by a dark blue triangle (?) with an altar symbolized by (/;) to abolish haughtiness (b) to abolish jealousy (o) to abolish anger (6) to abolish ignorance (b) to abolish jealousy (b) to abolish any untoward (ma-ino-rbod-gtoii-lha) the Moody sea accident 7. The Violent curse Lord (dmod-pa-drag-siiiigs II... ) (a) with an altar (6) to do away symbolized by with all evils violent fire and demons from the navel 8. The Lord-worshipped- (a) with an altar (b) to do away by-thc-world symbolized by with all evils (hjig-rten-mchod- the secret and demons bstod-lha) cemetery (e) and to attain wisdom of universal equality (c) and to attain the wisdom of discernment (c) and to attain the wisdom of a great mirror (capable of completo re flection) (c) and to attain the wisdom of realizing the true nature of all phenom ena (c) and to attain the wisdom of accomplish ment (c) and to accom plish prayer and propitia tion (c) and to aeoorn plish prayer and propitia tion (r) and to accom plish prayer and propitia tion The first five belong to other-vvorldliness, the last three to worldliness. Except for the Horse-headed Lord, all are manifesta tions of iManjusri, the embodiment of Wisdom itself. In the Kni?-ma pantheon, it may be marked, the Elixir Merit is the chief image of the eight, in fact of the nine, with the addition in the group of the Wisdom-holding Teacher (rig-hdzin-slob-dpon-lha), whose altar is symbolized by the " sea of misery " and whose function</page><page sequence="7">148 11?1?-MA-1'A : TUR KA ULY KOttM OF LAMAISM is to remove five poisonous appearances and embody the five kinds of wisdom. The image of the Elixir Merit has twenty-one heads in seven storeys, each storey with three heads. The number twenty-one indicates the twenty-one stages on the path of perfection,1 exoteric and esoteric, and the number seven the seven members of the Bodhisat road.2 The faces are of diff?rent colours, red indicating warm-heartedness ; white, purity ; blue, constancy ; green, the four virtues of serenity, fierceness, growth, and power ; yellow, completeness in all merits ; and mixed colours, the comprehensive nature of all phenomena. The forty-two arms signify so many serene modes, each hand holding an image of serene type. There are two wings on the shoulders, the left signifying expediency and the right wisdom ; like a god and his consort. There are eight legs, each foot treading on one heavenly king and one dragon. The eight legs symbolize eight roads to salvation, while the eight heavenly kings symbolize the eight senses ; and the eight dragons the eight states of mind. A consort embraces him, whose name Gtum-ino-dug-hrul-nag-mo indicates that she is the destroyer of the three arch-enemies, Greediness, Anger, and Ignorance. Returning to Methodology, there is a distinction between what has been transmitted from the direct word of mouth of the masters from India (bkah-ma) and what is handed down from the discovery of the buried texts (gter-ma). As different masters have different emphases and different treatments, there arose two main schools, the Bkah-ma, Zur-lugs, and Ron-lugs. The noted masters of the Zur-lugs were Zur-po-che (954-?), Zur-chu?-pa (1014-1074), and Sgro-phug-pa (1074-1134). The Roii-lugs originated with Ron zom-chen-po-chos-kyi-bzaii-po, contemporaneous with the Emperor Jen-tsung of the Sung Dynasty (1023-1003). The buried texts or " treasures " began to be excavated during the reign of Kao-tsung (1127-1102) by Ni-ma-hod-zer of Nan (1124-?), to be followed by further excavations by Guru Chos-kyi-dbaii phyug between the reigns of Ning-tsung (1195-1124) and Li-tsuug 1 111 the (treat Yoga system I here are thirteen esoteric stages on the path of perfection. Hut in Ann-Yoga there are twenty-one stages, and in Ati-Yoga or tho Great Perfection School there are sixteen. * The seven incnihers of the Hodhisat road are : mindful, discerning, devotional, happy, ease, meditative, detached.</page><page sequence="8">R?IN-MA-PA : THE EARLY TORM OV LAMALSM 149 (1225-1264). The results of these two people are called " upper and lower treasures " (gter-kha-gon-ljog). Thereafter quite a number of minor " excavators " became known, until all these were edited together by Katna din-pa (contemporaneous with Emperor Hsiao Tsung of the Ming Dynasty, 1488-1505) with his own enormous excavations to be known as " the southern treasures " (lho-gter). During the reign of Shih-Tsung (1522-1566), again, there arose out of a ruling family in the north a master, Ivig-hdsin-rgod-kyi-ldem hphyul-can, who also made many excavations and edited what is known as " the northern treasures " (byan-gtcr). During the reign of Shen-Tsung (1573-1619) Bkra-?is-stobsrgyal founded the monastery Rdo-rje-brag to expound " the northern treasures ", and between the Ming and (Jh'ing Dynasties another monastery, Smin-grol-glin, was founded by IJgyur-med-rdo-rje to expound " the southern treasures ". With these two seats of learning two schools became definitely established. But they are not exclusively concerned with the " treasures ", They also teach what has been handed down from Indian masters (bkah-ma). The second class of teaching of the three internally esoteric is the " assembled ", equivalent to Arm-Yoga. The chief treatises of this class are The Universal Assembled Knowledge (kun-ljdus-rig-pa) and The Assembled Mystic Cogitation (dgons-pa-ljdus-pa). Identifica tion or union with the tutelaries is emphasized. This is made possible by primarily using one's own arteries and the semen virile for the purpose of a perfect union, so that there arise happiness, light, and thoughtlessness. T?tere are both teachings inherited from Indian masters and what is contained in the discovered " treasures ". The third class deals with the " mind " alone, equivalent to Ati-Yoga. It dispenses with images and the internal energies, characteristic of the above two classes of teaching, but is con cerned with the realization of the true nature of the mind. The Ch'an ?School of Chinese Buddhism (or the Zen Buddhism of Japan) is similar in this respect. But what is unique with the Bniri-ma-pa is their method of attainment called " the surpassing of the upper most " (thod-rgyal), whereby self-illumination is maintained so that the material body may vanish in the rainbow or in the manner of the colours of the rainbow, as a way of salvation or emancipation. Both treatises and discovered treasures are their sources of teaching. And this teaching is again divided into three sub-classes.</page><page sequence="9">150 RN1?-MA VA : TUE KARLY FORM OF LAMAISM The first sub-class concerns the mind (aems-sde), how to realize the true nature of self and the world without being deceived by phenomenal illusions. The principal treatises of this class are The Garuda Bird in the Air (khyu?i-chen-ldi?i-pa), The Universal perfection King (kun-byed-rgyal-po), and The Great Perfection (rd zogs-pa-ehen-po). The second sub-class is the soaring into mystic perfection (klon sde). After the realization mentioned above, all shackles and prejudices fall away, so that whatever is reflected in the mind is illumination and light. The mind is entirely free. There is the teaching of the Diamond Bridge (rdo-rje-zam-pa) and the principal treatise is The Effortless (bya-rtsol-med-pa). The third sub-class is deep instruction (man-mig-gi-sde). When the mind is entirely free there is Enlightenment. So the body may vanish in the rainbow. The teaching of this class embodies the Four Essences (s?in-thig-ya-bzhi) and the principal treatises include The Supreme Power of the Lotus (padma-dban-rgyal), Buddha-Equanimity (sa?is-rgyas-ni?am-sbyor), and Sound-responding Perfection (sgra-thal-hgyur). (3) Important Seats of Learning.?The most important seats of learning still functioning are Smin-grol-gli? and Rdo-rje-brag, of Tibet, and Ka-thog, Dpal-yul, Rdzogs-ehen, and Zhi-chen, of Sikang (Kham). Of the four in Sikang the first three are the most important, comparable in reputation with the three monasteries of the Yellow Sect, the Established Church of Tibet, namely Se-ra, Ilbras-spim and Dgah-ldan, founded in 1417, 1414, 1407. Here 1 set them forth in historical sequence- together with others less important but of historical significance. Bsam-yas (Sam-yas) was the first monastery established in Tibet (702-6), during the reign of King Khri-sron-lde-btsan. Such original masters as l\ulma-hbyu?-gnas and S?nta-rakshita (Zhi-ba-htsho) propounded Buddhism there, and the first translation as a system of esoteric Buddhism was also there established. iMchims-phu of Bsam-yas was founded during the reign of the same king. The most noted persons in the Rnin-ma genealogy during the three stages (first, middle, and last) of transmission Gfiags dz?nana-kum?ra (contemporaneous with K lui -sro?i-lde-btsan), Guubs-sans-rgyas-yc-?es (after 827), Zur-po-che ?a-kya-ljbyu?-gnas (954-?) - used this as their seat of teaching. Even the three masters of the Zur-lugs mentioned above spent some time here to propagate</page><page sequence="10">R?lN-MA-PA I TUR RARLY FORM OP LAMAI.SM 151 the doctrine. But they became originators of two other monasteries. IJug-pa-lun was founded by Zur-po-che (?akya- bbyun-gnas), who was succeeded by Zur-chun-pa (?es-rab-grags-pa) and Zur-eakva hbyun-gnas), who was succeeded by Zur-chun-pa (ces-rab-grags pa) and Zur-?akya-sen-gc. The last founded another monastery, Sgro-phug, and later became known as iSgro-phug-pa. Ka-thog of Greater Dergc, Sikang, was founded by Bka-hdam-pa bde-g?egs (M22-?),1 younger brother of Phag-mo-grub-pa of the White Sect (bkah-brgyud), during the reign of Kao-Tsung of the Sung Dynasty (1127-1102). lie was a second-generation disciple of Sgro-phug-pa. Having assimilated much of the buried treasures, he belonged to the same school which later characterized Smin grol-glin by being an exponent of " the southern treasures ". But the founder of Ka-thog was not confined exclusively to the treasures. He also transmitted his heritage of the Indian masters, the treasures playing a more important role. There are about 550 monks in the monastery of Ka-thog, headed by a Grand LamaDri-med-zhi?-skyu?. Thar-pa-glin, of Bhutan, was founded by Dri-med-bod-zer (1308 - 1363) when he travelled in that country. From there the Bed Sect or R?i?-ma-pa spread to Nepal. Rdo-rje-brag, the seat of learning for " the northern treasures " in Tibet, had its beginning in an assembly called E-wam-chos-sgar, organized by Bkra-eis-stohs-rgyal, a chieftain in Northern Tibet who had lost his power and travelled in U. The monastery was formally established by Padma-hphrin-las, an incarnation of Bkra ?is-stobs-rgyars son, Nag-gi-dban-phyug. Dalai V (1617-1682), the Lama Pope of the Yellow Sect, had a great admiration for this monastery. It was destroyed in 1683 by the invasion of the Jungar, but soon restored. Smin-grol-glin, the seat of learning for " the southern treasures " in Tibet, was founded in the last years of the Ming Dynasty (1628 1643) by IJgyur-med-rdo-rje and ?ag-dba?-chos-dpal, who were succeeded by Darma-eri. lu a similar way to Rdo-rje-brag, it was destroyed and restored about the same time. 1 This is basrd on the notes supplied by Karma l??ad-sgnib-rhos kvi sen -ge, Grand Lama of i\w new monastery of Mi fingga?s-dkar, Sikang. Aeeordiinj to a history of the K???-ma-pa by IJjigM-med-gli?-pa (172?I I7?IS), published bv the printing establishment at .1 Jorge, the founder is f^'pobs-pa-mthah-yas, son of I'hag mo-grub-pa's wile's brother.</page><page sequence="11">152 K?1?-MA-PA : Til 15 EARLY FORM OF LAMAISM Hdzogs-chen (great perfection), of Derge, Sikang, was founded in 1085 by Padma-rig-hdzin (1025-1007), who came from the west of the Golden Sand Hiver in 1084 at the request of ?ag-dba? bkra-?is, chief of the ruling family at Derge. It is now the most famous monastery of its kind, not only in Sikang, and attracts students from all places, including Bhutan and Nepal. The con gregation is more than "live hundred, and the Grand Lama an incarnation of the founder. Dpal-yul, of Greater Derge, wa? founded about the same time as Hdzogs-chen by Big-ljdzin-kun-bzan-?es-rab. And, as in Hdzogs-chen, its lineage follows Smin-grol-glm, seat of " the southern treasures ". There are about six hundred monks, headed by Karma-ya?-sr?d. Zhi-chcn, not far from Bdzogs chcn, branched out from it about 1740 or later. Its founder was Zhi-ehen-rab-hbyanis-pa. There are about one hundred monks, but their relationship with Hdzogs-chen seems very strained. (4) Academic Organization. -1 living the monasteries of Tibet aside, of those in Sikang only Ka-thog, Dpal-yul, and Hdzogs-chen have academic colleges, called Grwa sa, for the purpose of open discussion. Formerly such monasteries were exclusively concerned with esoteric teaching which was characterized by personal attain ment, not by formal communication. Especially because of their essential doctrine of Great Perfection (rdzogs-chen) similar to the Ch'an Tsung mentioned above--emphasis was laid on intuitive insight rather than on communicable knowledge. But such a practice is good only for the most gifted. So far as ordinary talents are concerned, these must be doetrinally prepared before they become capable of direct comprehension, ftlore than a century ago Hdzogs chen monastery established an academic college called crih-se?-ba slob-grwa, on the initiative of l)go.-maiVgzhan-phan-inthah-yas, for the formal teaching of exoteric as well as esoteric Buddhism. The Great College (slob-chen) was later added to the Assembly Hall, on the model of the three famous colleges or monasteries of the Yellow Sect in Tibet, namely Sera, llbras-spu?i, and Dgalj-ldan. The subject taught consists of translation of Buddha's word and the commentaries of his Indian disciples, only supplemented by the explanations of the masters of the Hnin-ma-pa. About 1890 Si-tu-ehos-kyi-rgya-mtsho also instituted a teaching college at Ka-thog. First established was the Treatise School (rgyud-sde-khan). Although the name implies Tantraism or esoteric</page><page sequence="12">KNI?-MA-1'A : TUB KARLY FORM OF LAMAI.SM 153 Buddhism, the School is not exclusively so limited. Rather this name was adopted because of so many esoteric images in the hall. In fact the School is divided into two colleges, the Teaching College (b?ad-grwa) and the Training College (sgrub-grwa). The former gives formal instruction in the doctrines of exoteric as well as esoteric Buddhism. When the students become versed in these doctrines they are prepared to enter into the jnraclicnl training of the latter in pure esoteric accomplishment such as " empowering, genealogical transmission, and tutelage " (dban-lun-khrid-gsuin). This institu tion was further developed under the leadership of Kun-bzan-dpal, who was 0-rgyan-btsau-hdzin-nor-bu\s pupil. Besides these colleges an Ordinance College (sgrig-grwa) was established for the ordinary monks, who cared for neither philosophical discussion nor personal attainments, but had to qualify in the performance of rituals and a knowledge of monastic discipline. In the early twenties of the present century the Grand Lama, Mgon-bsam, of Dpal-yul, established three academic colleges at his own seat of learning on the pattern of the last two monasteries. The Grand Lama (bstan-bdag), or Living Buddha (sprul-sku), of each monastery is academically the President ; under him there are college deans or professors (mkhan-po) in charge of philosophical discussion, practical guidance, and religious performance. There are also lecturers (slob-dpon) to collaborate in tutorial work. The number of students differs in each monastery, being dependent upon the amount and source of support, such as overall and partial scholarships offered by the monastery, contributions to the monastery for religious performance, alms collected, and private support from each student's family. Rdzogs-ehen, for instance, offers thirty overall scholarships, equally divided among the students of Teaching and Training Colleges, out of a fund donated by the king of Bhutan in terms of sixty pack animals' load of Indian silk. Each of these scholarships is in kind, amounting to two bales of barley (140 catties) and some thirty catties of butter. As a rule, however, in all three monasteries there are about forty to fifty students in a Teaching College and more than ten in a Training College. In the Training College of Rdzogs-chen in particular there are thirteen fully ordained monks known as " the thirteen pure ones " (mtshans-pa-bcu-gsum). Attendance is required for five years at the Teaching College, six at the Training College, and for an indeterminate period at the JRAS. OCTOBElt 1918. 1 1</page><page sequence="13">154 R?I?-MA-PA : TUE RARLY FORM OF LAMAISM Ordinance College. But the number of years may always be pro longed at the wish of a student who wants to be more thoroughly grounded. For example, a dullard may be in the Teaching College for more than ten years.1 A boy of six or seven may be sent to the monastery to study with a tutor (dge-rgan) first the Tibetan alphabet (ka, kha, ga, na, etc.), secondly spelling, and thirdly sentence formation. He is called Ka-kha-pa or a beginner (grwa-chuii). Then he will study with a lecturer or professor the necessary formulas in religious chanting in praise. Not until he is sixteen is his hair shaven and he himself called a novice-to-be (dge-tshul-gsar-pa). When about twenty years old he is formally initiated into thirty-six vows and called a novice (dge-tshul or in Sanskrit sr?inanera) or a regular student (grwa-pa). From this time on he may attend the Teaching College as auditor. His regular attendance is counted only after he is fully ordained to be a monk (dge-sloii or in Sanskrit Bhiksn) by taking two hundred and fifty-three vows, when called a " student of the Teaching College " (bslab-grwa-pa). As soon as his regular attendance is counted, he will be examined (rgyugs-len) on any chapter of religious works explained by his teacher. When he is advanced far enough by many such examinations, after a period of time he is called a Student-assistant (skyur-dpon), and will help guide the studies of his fellow-students. After the final examination he graduates from the Teaching College. Should ho prove to be the best of all, he is entitled to Bab-hbyams-pa, a degree equivalent to the Ph.D., and receives three gifts, namely a sceptre (Indra's thunderbolt or in Tibetan rdo-rje), a rdo-rje bell, and a suit of monastic garments. The few next best are given gifts of less importance accordingly until gradually the ordinary graduates are named without gifts. Those who fail in the final examination are punished by being tied up to the (lag-post before the chanting hall to be publicly humiliated. A graduate of the Teaching College is qualified to enter the Training College to become a " student of the Training College " 1 In a regular college of art? of the Yellow Sect, which corresponds to the Teaching College of the K?i?-ma-pa, attendance is required at least for fifteen years and one may end his life in the first few grades without hope of ever graduating ; for 0|&gt;eji discussion and communicante knowledge are much nuire emphasized in such a college of the Yellow Sect than in its counterpart, of the old ?ret, even though the latter tries to adapt itself to the practice of tin? former, as pointed out ahove. It is ]&gt;ersonal attainment rather than communicahlc knowledge that is considered important hy the lt?i?-mu-pa.</page><page sequence="14">R?I?-MA-PA ! TUB BARLY FORM OF LAMAISM 155 (sgrub-grwa-pa). When such a one distinguishes himself in different degrees, the titles of " the self-perfecting lama " (sgrub-pa-bla-ma) and " the perfection-instructing lama " (sgrub-dpon-bla-ma) may be acquired. The former indicates self-training ; the latter the training of others. After graduation from these two colleges one is entitled to the rank of a professor (mkhan-po), being distinguished both academically and spiritually. Then he may either stay in the monastery to instruct students or become an abbot of some small monastery under the jurisdiction of the mother monastery. Take Rdzogs-chen as an actual case to illustrate the peculiar position of such a professor. Once thus qualified a monk forgoes for life the privilege of begging for alms, while the " living Buddhas " and other monks are free to do so. Furthermore, the monastery institutes a system of lineal religious genealogy as well as choosing leaders irrespective of origin. In other words, it is an academic combination of the principles of procreation and adoption. There are four academic units, for which professors are chosen from those who have gained the confidence of the congregation by knowledge and personality. They are not necessarily graduates from the colleges of their own monastery. There are also three units, two exoteric (the University College so to speak and the college endowed with full scholarships) and one esoteric (an assembly on the snow mountain), whose professors must be the lineal descendants of the R?i?-ma-pa. Adherents of all sects of esoteric Buddhism come here to study. But any one of any sect of exoteric Buddhism may come to challenge the inmates of Rdzogs-chen to public debates. As a rule those who wish to do so may announce their theses and register with the monastery authorites so that they will be given the floor in turn to propound them and to engage others in debate. (5) Programme of Study.?\\\ the Teaching College are studied the words of Buddha and the commentaries of both the esoteric and exoteric schools, the latter first. There are thirteen works belonging to exoteric Buddhism in the curriculum of study : 1. On the Attainment of One s Own Liberation (so-sor-thar-pa). 2. The Fundamentals of Monastic Laws (hdul-rtsa). 3. Vasubandhu Abhidharma-koca (mnon-mdsod). 4. Collection of Abridged Texts ofthe Abhidharma (kun-las-btus-pa). 5. Fundamentals of the Mean (dhu-mahi-rtsa-ba). 6. On the Entrance to the Mean (dbu-ma-hjug-pa).</page><page sequence="15">150 K?I?-MA-I'A : TUF. KARLY FORM OF LAMAISM 7. A 'Treatise on Wisdom in 400 Verses (bzhi-brgya-pa). 8. On the Entrance to the Btnlhisat Practice (spyod-hjug). 9. On Abhisama-ya Comprehension (mnon-rtogs-brgyan). 10. On the Distinction between the Alean and Extremes (dbu-mthah rnam-hbycd). 11. On the Nature of Things in Themselves (chos-fiid-rnam-hbyed). 12. The Most Supreme Tantrism (rgyud-bla-ma). 13. On the Great Vehicle (theg-chen-brgyan). These may be divided into four classes ; monastic laws, studies of the Lesser Vehicle, those of the Great Vehicle on the nature of things (dbu-ma) and on the appearance of things. Apart from the monastic laws, the three may be further divided into theory and conduct. In practice the thirteen works may be thoroughly studied or some may not be so studied. To take an actual example from Ka-thog, the following order of study may be noted :? 1. On the Entrance to the Bodhisat Practice (spyod-hjug). 2. Sentence Construction in Verse (tshig-lehu-bcad-pa). 3. Clear Exposition of the Three Kinds of Monastic Laws by M?iah-ris-pan-chen (sdom-gsuin-rnam-?es). 4. The Five Works of Maitreya (Byams-ehos-sde-liia) with com mentaries. 5. The Fundamentals of Monastic Laws (hdul-rtsa). 0. Fundamentals of the ?lean (dbu-inahi-rtsa-ba). 7. On the Entrance to the Mean (dbu-ina-hjug-pa). 8. A Treatise on Wisdom in 400 Verses (bzhi-brgya-pa). 9. Collection of Treatises on the Point of View of the Mean. Following translations of original Indian works, the students are further guided by the expositions of Tibetan scholars of the KFiiii ma-pa. So far as Hdzogs-chen is concerned, there are three months each year devoted to the lecturing on the thirteen works mentioned above. The audience come with a moderately high understanding, although the number of students is indeterminate. In addition the following are included : The Gist of the Esoteric (gsaii-ba-s?i?-po) and the works by Dri-med-ljod-zer (1308-13G3) and Mkhyen-brtse hod-zer (contemporaneous with Ch'ien Lung of the Ch'ing Dynasty, who reigned from 1730 to 1795), suchas The Essentials of Merit (yon tan-mdzod) and The Wish-fuljUling Treasures (yid-bzhin-mdzod). After instruction in the works on exoteric Buddhism are taught those on esoteric Buddhism in the Teaching College. First such</page><page sequence="16">RNI?-MA-rA : TUB BARLY FORM OF LAMAISM 157 main works as the Great Tantric Treasures (gsan-sni?) and the Transforming Tantras (sgyu-hphrul) are explained in accordance with the commentaries of the Zur School (zur-lugs), which con stitute the common understanding with other sects (tnthun-mon-pa). Secondly, they arc explained in accordance with the commentaries of the Ron School (ron-lugs) not shared by other sects (tnthun-mon ma-yin-pa). Thirdly, they are explained again in accordance with the commentaries by Klon-clien-rab-ljbyams-pa (another name for Dri-med-hod-zer) with collateral readings in The Seven Treasures (mdzod-bdun), The Three Rounds of Relaxation (iial-gso-skor-gsum) and The Three Ways of Salvation (ra?-grol-skor-gsum), known as what is absolutely not shared with other sects (cin-tu-mthun-mo? ma-yin-pa). As soon as a student clearly understands such esoteric and exoteric works he is qualified to enter the Training College, where he must attend for six years. For the first three years he is taught initiation ceremonies (dbaii), injunctions (lufi), and tutelary instruc tions (khrid), as a basis for later self-development, which, as a rule, takes three more years. Hence the saying, " One stays three years in the open and again three years in the dark." For private religious practice takes place in dark cells. The order of practice is first the mental creation of the images of the tutelaries in terms of reciting formulas and meditating on visions thus aroused ; secondly, the physical-mental control of the arteries, semen virile, etc. ; and thirdly, the realization of the true nature of one's own mind. % For the practice of the first two, one relies upon " the three foundations" (rtsa-ba-gsum), namely one's own. master (bla-ma), the Tutelary deity (yi-dam), and the goddess of wisdom (mkhah hgro-ma or in Sanskrit D?kin?). One must be versed in meditating on them and in reciting formulas to them. For the practice of the last one .the student relies upon " the word of instruction " (khrid-yig). This is divided into two categories. First the preamble (snon-hgro), and second the thing itself (dnos gzhi). The preamble usually consists of Dpa I sprul's Injunctions of Kun-tu-bzaii-po, which is similar to Tso?-kha-pa's The Gradrd Course on the Bod hi sat. Road, and may be taught before one is initiated into esoteric Buddhism, instruction i? given differently to different students. Nowadays it is usually based on The Com prehensive Supreme Wisdom.</page><page sequence="17">158 R?I?-MA-PA I TIIK KARLY FORM OF LAMAISM When a student graduates from the Training College, he is qualified to be a professor if he wishes. But, if he aspire to further self development, he may travel around to visit more ?advanced masters for more enlightened guidance. (6) Business Organization.?Both academic and business organiza tion are ultimately under the central control of the Grand Lama (bstan-bdag) of the monastery, who is always a Living Buddha (sprul-sku), although there may be quite a number of Living Buddhas in one monastery who do not have administrative duties. So far as the business organization of a monastery is concerned, there are two aspects : the religious and the administrative. The religious aspect of monastic business organization is under the direction of the Grand Lama, the professors (mkhan-po) and the chief priest (rdo-rje-slob-dpon). It is this priest who presides over religious ceremonies. He must qualify not only in personal attain ments but in learning and personality. Under him there are a number of leaders in chanting (dbu-mdzad), some attendants for the offerings (mchod-dpon), and one disciplinarian (chos-khrims). The last is not only present at religious ceremonies, there is one in each of the different colleges to enforce proper conduct by the monks. Apart from the main chanting hall in a monastery there are special quarters for the worship of the Protectors of Beligion. And there are monks particularly assigned to take care of such temples. The administration of monastic business is in charge of the Grand Lama and one regent (dgon-dpon). The regent's duties are shared by a committee of elders (rgan-pa), under whom there are a number of assistant messengers. There is one treasurer (phyag-mdzod) directly under the Grand Lama to take care of his private property and of the monastery's public property. Under the treasurer are a steward (gncr-pa) and some twenty accountants (spyi-pa or spyi gso) for the actual management of all properties, either by invest ment in trade or by loans to laymen on interest. The profit or interest thus incurred is to be used for expenditure on the repair of the monastery, the making of imagos, the cutting of wooden blocks for the printing of the scriptures, the subsidising of students, and on religious ceremonies, relief, medicine, and the disposal of the dead. The source of income is from livestock, trade, land rent, and contributions from believers. All these ollices are filled by monks appointed by the Grand Lama.</page><page sequence="18">r?i?-ma-pa: tub ha kl y form of lamaism 159 The term of office is either three years, four years, or five years. It is not fixed. For the appointment is really based on a nomination resulting from public votes of the inmates of the monastery. Officers may be re-elected, so that they may be appointed again and again to serve the congregation. The officers do not serve only individually. As a rule there are standing committees for particular functions, and all these may have joint meetings to deliberate on issues of public concern. Thus the business organization has the combined features of democracy and dictatorship. Furthermore, to safeguard the welfare of the monastery against external troubles some important personage such as a chieftain is usually invited to serve as a patron or the lay " protector of religion ". (7) Public Festivities are part of the monastic religious ceremonies. But those performed daily within the monastery are not of interest to the public. Those performed on a larger scale and often in costumes an? occasions to attract crowds of lay folk. They not only serve a religious purpose but provide recreation for the order and for the people. Often they are of such seasonal importance that a great deal of trade and other economic activities centre round them. The dates of these public festivities may differ in different monasteries, but approximately arg as follows : On the first day of the first moon the New Year (lo-gsar) is celebrated at a Great Prayer meeting. On the eighteenth and nineteenth of the first moon there is a preliminary Sacred Dance of the Diamond Pike (Phur-pa) called the " Lesser Bike " (Phur-chun). On the twenty-eighth and twenty ninth the formal performance to represent the deity takes place and is called the " Greater Pike " (Phur-chen). in some monasteries the Diamond Pike is not presented. But instead the " one hundred most supreme serene and angry tutelaries " of the Great Yoga mentioned in Section 2 are staged. It is only the great monasteries that are well enough equipped to do this on such a scale. On the twenty-second of the second moon the dance of worship (sgrub-mchod) takes place to personify the Eighty Methodological Tutelaries (? 2 supra). In the third moon the rite of offering to the mountain and river gods (bswa-yul) is observed to pray for the peace and welfare of the country. From the first to the fifteenth of the fourth moon is the period</page><page sequence="19">100 K?I?-MA-PA I TUR EARLY FORM OF LAMAISM of silent fasting (smyun-guas) to worship the Eleven-headed Avalo kit a. For monks in training there is an initiation ritual after this period. On the tenth of the sixth or seventh moon there is the Tenth Day Observance (tshes-bcu) to personify in Sacred Dance the eight manifestations of the Lotus-born or Padina-hbyun-guas (gu-ru-mtshan-brgyad). For it is said that the Master desired to come on every tenth of each moon to this world for the benefit of sentient beings. So his followers in Tibet have instituted the Tenth Day Observance. Theoretically any tenth day will do. But it is considered especially important to observe it on the particular tenth of the moon in the year in which it happens that the three (day, moon, year) are designated simultaneously by the monkey of the twelve animal symbols.1 Thus while every tenth of each moon is religiously commemorated, it is on the particular tenth of a particular year that such a Sacred Dance is performed. On the eighteenth and nineteenth of the ninth moon the demon suppression ceremony (linga sgral) is observed. All the enemies of Buddhism arc supposed to be spiritually imprisoned in the figures made of barley meal mixed with butter (gtor-ma). These figures are mutilated in the Sacred Dance to simulate the destruction of enemies.2 This feature may accompany any other aim mil Sacred Dances, when it is called " the cutting of barley-meal figures " (gtor-ma-brgyag). On the fourteenth and fifteenth of the eleventh moon a ceremony is observed to celebrate the winter solstice (ili-log). The twenty-ninth day of the twelfth moon is the occasion to make offerings to commemorate the end of the mouth and the end of the year (lo-zad-zla-zad-dgu-gtor). The idea is that with such a happy ending of the season the deities arc to be praised and sentient beings are to be given gifts. So, for self-interest as well as altruism, prayers are made for peace and blessing. (8) Remarks in Conclusion.?Denominational differences are ordinarily stressed by the less informed, according to the observa tion of learned lamas, for whom they are only so many means of 1 The order is : mouse, ox, tiger, rahhit, dragon, snake, horno, sheep, monkey, chicken, dog, and pig.

TUB BAKLY FORM OF LAMAISM 161 suiting the different levels of student aspirants. As heritage, and culture are not identical for all, there is no one method to induce everyone to develop a full personality. To give everybody a chance different methods and viewpoints are offered in Buddhism. But the fundamental purpose is always eventual salvation. It is common knowledge that Il?nay?na, or the Lesser Vehicle, is the means to effect individual salvation, while Mah?y?na, or the Great Vehicle, makes it possible for the individual to help others to save themselves. It is less obvious in the case of esoteric and exoteric teachings. Why esoteric ? Because those who are not prepared arc most likely unable to understand it and liable to abuse it. Jesus remarked that to the public lie used figurative speech, but to His disciples He spoke the truth. This is not only true with every religion, but also with everyday practice of the discreet, who speak in accordance with the understanding of the audience. But in Tibetan Buddhism, which represents the later development of Buddhism in India, there are so many monstrous images, especially those in sexual embrace, that all sorts of misunderstandings are the result. These images, say conscientious students, are survivals of primitive worship of sex. In any religion we can tracte many symbols of phallic worship and so on. So, too, it may Ife said that the Christian practice of expressing thanks to the Lord before every meal is a survival of primitive culture, when human control over nature was too limited to ensure an adequate supply of food. But this historical attribution docs not explain the function of Christian prayer in modern life So also, however true may be the anthropomorphic interpretations of esoteric Buddhism, they do not help us to under stand the mental processes of lamas who practise it to-day. According to the learned lamas exoteric Buddhism is a way of renunciation, in which wisdom is acquired by knowing the evils and impernianence of the phenomenal world, it is an effort to lift oneself up in spite of the material bondage to which one is subjected by being born in a material body. Esoteric Buddhism, no matter whether or not originating from primitive conditions, is theoretically more advanced than exoteric Buddhism because whatever is given is taken for granted, and effort is made to utilize the given as a means for intellectual insight and spiritual development. Thus the lifting-up process is no longer in spite of the material body, but rather because of it. Theorists of the esoteric school ridicule the exoteric idealists by comparing the renunciation of the latter to</page><page sequence="21">K?2 R?I?-MA-FA : TUR RARLY FORM OF LAMAISM searching for the shadow while what brings it about is denied existence. Once the dichotomy between body and mind is assumed there is no end of trouble. It makes no difference whether the body or the mind is given preponderant importance. If " suclmess " of whatever is is the starting-point, it is as real as natural to view everything impartially without prejudice and misconception. When one is free from prejudice and misconception, one is Freedom itself. This is what salvation or emancipation or eternity means. According to a passage in one esoteric text, we are told : " Good fellows, basically whatever is is. Suchness, including yourself, is not intrinsically entangled, why should you try to disentangle yourself ? It is not intrinsically deluded, why should you seek truth apart from it ? " In another passage it is said, " Behaviour without understanding is blind. Understanding without practice is shallow. When? both are one, you have self-control." This self-control is, of course, not repression but liberation. No lazy people may enjoy it. It is the result of right endeavour or realism in thought and action. The idea of gaining control through adjustment to the given by means of proper understanding and practice is generally known as the scientific attitude. But in the realm of phenomena concerning man, either individually or socially, the attitude lags behind in the process of becoming scientific. We are only beginning to see that society cannot be changed by individuals who denounce it. Those who want to develo]) it to a higher level must take society at its true value and participate in its activities instead of passing judgments and standing aloof from it. In this respect the esoteric teaching of Buddhism takes a similar stand with regard to the world and the self. Again, we are only beginning in psycho-analysis to fathom potential energy deep within ourselves. But one thing is clear already. There is no use in repression, and it is possible to redirect our energies through sublimation. Traditional moral philosophy and general exoteric Buddhism may end in repression, while esoteric Buddhism dares to stare at reality and consciously works for sublimation, if necessary. Heturning to the monstrous images again, the idea is to call up witliin oneself whatever there is by meditating on them. For example, the angry expression of the images calls to mind anger within. So also with lust, greed, ignorance, jealousy, and so on. Taking these for granted, one may try to put them in their proper place. This means a well-rounded personality. Then in the last</page><page sequence="22">R?I?-MA-PA : TUB BARLY FORM OF LAMAIKM l?'.'i stage the images become unnecessary, and whatever there is within the body may be freely directed. When this self-direction becomes spontaneous it is self-caused, free from causation or the wheel of life : in other words it is Nirvana here and now. 1?BFBHBNCB8 A History of Buddhism (dc*l?7.li?ii-Kef7?H-paH-legH-piir-gHtiiVt-p^ mtHhohL8mii-]M?r-gyur-|Ki-ri#-)m glin-pa (1729-1798), ]Hiblislio&lt;l at Derge, Sikang.
