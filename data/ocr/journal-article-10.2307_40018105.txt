<plain_text><page sequence="1">REFLECTIONS ON FAITH, HOPE AND LOVE H. Richard Niebuhr1 ABSTRACT The author distinguishes a relational interpretation of faith, hope and love (and other gifts of God) from a theory of virtue insofar as virtue means good conduct in the power of the agent and insofar as it means habit. Denying that any gift of God is the key to or the foundation of other gifts or is capable of being understood appropriately in isolation, the author proceeds to analyze faith, hope and love and to discuss their relations one to another. I On the 'Theological Virtues" in General 1. When the ethical reflections of Scripture are systematized with the aid of ideas developed by Greco- Roman-Western reason considerable violence is done to them and the way is opened to many misconceptions and malpractices. This seems to be true in particular of the long-established practice in Christianity of dealing with faith, hope and love, as well as with humility, joy, peace, obedience, graciousness and other gifts of God, under the head of virtues. These gifts have this in common with the virtues that they are goods and that their matter is personal conduct, in distinction from goods whose matter is something else as in the case of physical health, where biological process has the "form of JRE 2/1 (1974), 151-156</page><page sequence="2">152 NIEBUHR good/' or of wealth, or food, or beauty. But the conception of virtue does not fit these gifts insofar as virtue means good conduct in the power of the agent and insofar as it means habit. The "theological virtues" are indeed qualifications of personal freedom; the self is freely active in love, faith, humility, etc., though the freedom which it exercises in them is more the freedom of self-determination than of choice, or more the freedom towards an objective good than a freedom from external compulsion; but they are not achievements or products of training; therefore gifts. Moreover, they are not habits somehow established in the constitution of the agent, but relations which depend for their continuance on the constancy with which the objective good, to which the self is related in these ways, is given. This is true not only of faith, hope and love but of all other good human conduct as seen in the perspective of faith. Hence the conception of virtue does not only fail to fit the gifts of faith, love and hope, but also all these other kinds of good human conduct. That is to say, the idea of virtue itself has no real place in Christian ethics. If we continue to use it, as it seems almost necessary to do, since we have no other word for the gifts which have personal conduct as their matter, we must always do it with the qualification that we mean by it neither achievement nor habit, but gift and response. 2. From this point of view faith, love and hope are not the theological virtues which may be added as gifts to achieved moral virtues- courage, temperance, justice and prudence- but the chief or most inclusive theological virtues among which one must also number endurance or patience (hupomone rather than andreia), self-control, righteousness, and humility (tapeinophrosune rather than sophrosune) , not to speak of other kinds of gracious behavior. Insofar as the distinction between moral or achieved, habitual virtues and theological virtues may be maintained the line must be drawn elsewhere than Thomas and his followers draw it. It lies between the habits which put one in the way of receiving the gifts and the gifts themselves. So the righteousness of man or justice may put one in the way of receiving the gift of divine righteousness, though not without the kind of pain that Paul experienced, and courage may put one in the way of receiving the gift of patience and endurance, though not without the conversion that a Peter had to undergo. 3. The gifts which we call theological virtues in this general sense are given not as states of character but as relations to other beings and particularly as relations to God. They are given with and in the gift of the object toward which as actions of the self they are directed. Humility or thinking rightly of ourselves is given with the gift of God himself, and of the neighbors. The self does not think rightly or humbly of itself until God discloses himself in his majesty and graciousness and reveals the neighbor in his Christlikeness. Love is given with the gift of the lovely, the love-attracting; it is called forth by the gift of God himself as the supremely and wholly desirable good; by the gift of the neighbor, as the one beloved by God, as lovely, and as loving the self. Hereby we not only know love but conceive love, that God makes himself known in his</page><page sequence="3">REFLECTIONS ON FAITH, HOPE AND LOVE 153 beauty, as Jonathan Edwards would say, and in his love of us, as the Elder John says. Faith as trust is given with the self-disclosure to a person of God as the faithful One, who not only can be trusted but invites and attracts trust; faith as loyalty or faithfulness is given with the revelation of the supremely challenging cause, the cause of the kingdom of God or the cause of Christ. Hope is given with the gift of a promise or with the gift of a future. In every case what is given is not a "virtue" as a habit of the soul, but an objective something toward which the soul goes out in activity. Thus the theological virtues, or virtues insofar as they are theological, have the character of response rather than habits. As responses they are personal both on the side of the agent and on the side of the object, that is they are responses of a person to personal actions such as faithkeeping, love, promise. 4. We will confine ourselves from this point on to the three chief theological virtues, faith, hope and love, but what is to be said about them probably applies to all Christian responses. It does not seem that the Thomist position which regards them as supernatural additions to nature carr be defended. They seem, rather, to represent the restoration and the perfection to its true activity of a personal capacity for response which has been perverted. The love of God and of the neighbor in God are not foreign to man's nature or, better, to man in his natural situation; but in our fallen situation they are present as love of idol and love of the neighbor in relation to idols. Man does not exist without love of an objective good which is, in a momentary way, at least the object of his greatest concern. Nor does he seem to live without relation to the Ground of Being though in the fallen state this relation is one of hostility. The love of God is the restoration and perfection of a response which has always been present in misdirected or inverted form; this seems also to be true of love of the companion. Similarly, man being not merely gregarious but personally communal does not live without relations of fidelity and trust, though in a world of many betrayals, trust turns partly into mistrust, and loyalty to partial causes leads to betrayal of other causes. Trust and faithfulness- together with the secondary form of faith, belief- are inseparable from man's existence as a communal, personal being who must make promises in order to be a person and must trust in promises. But the structure of faith is warped, twisted and perverted in actual existence and must be both restored and perfected. Again, hope is not a supernatural addition to man's nature. Insofar as he is a person man has time in him, a past, a present and a future. In a life in which promises have been broken by .the self and by those it trusts-mistrusts, in which memory is of a past full of disappointments and betrayals, the future has the form of wishful utopianism and of anxiety. Hope is the conversion of man's internal futurity, not the supplying of a future where there was not future. In anxiety man has death in his future, in hope life; but man does not live without a future.</page><page sequence="4">154 NIEBUHR II On the Interrelation of the Theological Virtues 1. The theological virtues cannot be reduced to one of the three, as often seems to be suggested. Love as such has no reference to time, but to the presence of a gracious being inviting as it gives love; nor does it have as graciousness the character of loyalty and trust. It may well be the greatest of the virtues, but it is only in connection with faith that it becomes great love, as is clear even in human personal relations where love without trust and loyalty lacks moral quality. Faith as trust in a faithful person and as fidelity to a person and to a common cause has reference both in the agent and in his object to the pre-eminently moral character of a freedom that can and does bind itself and which can keep or break its covenants. As such it is distinctly different from love though it is incomplete, of course, without love. Hope is the response of personal being in which there is time. This time reference is as such not characteristic of love and faith. But without love and faith hope is empty, or does not exist at all. Each of the virtues has its distinctive character, but none of them can be in action without the others. The danger, of course, of every analysis of Christian life is that the distinction of various aspects will lead to the thought that it is a union of parts and this may lead to the mistaken effort to add virtue to virtue. Hence it is intelligible why at various times the effort to do justice to the unity of Christian life should have led to the effort to concentrate it in one of the virtues as the source and bearer of all the rest. So faith in the days of the Reformation, love in the time of liberalism and now hope has been regarded as the fundamental, or the original or the key virtue. However, none of these is the key to or the foundation of the others, as existence in time is not the key to or the ground of the self's existence in devotion to the good or to its existence in covenant relations, nor are the latter the bases of the former. Insofar as the unity of the self in Christian life needs to be defined this can be done only, it seems to me, by reference to Christ, or the spirit of Christ, which dwells in it and responds faithfully, lovingly, hopefully to God-in-Christ and companion-in-Christ. 2. Though faith and hope and love are not so unified that two of these are aspects of the third, yet they constitute a unity and not a collection of responses or virtues. They cannot be added to each other so that one of them might be possible to the self without the other two. They are as interconnected as are their bases in the creaturely constitution of the self as being devoted to value, as covenanting being and as being in time. (I shall henceforth use the phrase "being in time" in place of the more accurate but cumbersome expression "being that has time in it.") Something has been said above about the way in which faith, as a relation of trust in the faithful one and as loyalty to his cause, is related to love as desire for the good One and appreciation of all those who are good for him. We cannot here speak of a first and second. In man-God as in</page><page sequence="5">REFLECTIONS ON FAITH, HOPE AND LOVE 155 man-man relations the first act of which a self may be aware may be a response of faith which is followed by love or it may be the other way. In the one instance faith is perfected by love, in the other case love is perfected by faith. In both cases a double reference is involved. In love the reference is to God as the self's good, fulfilling all its need, and to all creaturely beings which are gqpd for God, whether or not their goodness for the self has become evident. In faith the reference is to God as the faithful One, who keeps his promises, and to his creatures to whom he has made his promises and to whom the self is united in covenant. But promise involves commitment which has a future in view and so hope is immediately involved as that modification of the self's movement toward that future in which it acts as loving and faithful self. 3. Hope is the peculiarly human theological virtue. Love and faith must be ascribed to God, however great our fear of anthropomorphism may be, for without activity that is the counterpart of our desire for the good and of our fidelity the Ground of Being is just that and not God. But to ascribe hope to him seems too anthropomorphic. Whatever his relation to time, it is hard to think of time being in him as in us. So far as I know, the Scriptures never speak of the hope of God though they do speak of his love and his faith. Now hope is related to faith afnd love first of all in this way that it is the expectation of the manifestation of God's love and of his faithfulness, that is of his redemption of the promises made to life. It is the expectation of the manifestation of this faithfulness not only or primarily to the self but to those who have been faithful to him and to his cause. So its great symbol or focusing point is the coming of Jesus Christ in power. It is also the expectation of the revelation of his love for the unfaithful and of his faithfulness in keeping the promise made through Christ to forgive the world's sin. Further, hope is the expectation of the self's perfection in love and faith. If in each present moment the self knows itself as having, at least an ambivalent relation of love-hostility, trust-mistrust, toward God, hope appears as the assurance that "I shall yet praise him." And it is in the third place the expectation of the kingdom of God in which the relations of love and appreciation, of trust and loyalty, run back and forth between finite beings and between them and the infinite source and object of love and faith. 4. Hope is not only the expectation of faith and love; it is the exercise of faith and love in the temporal dimension. Hope is the form which faith assumes in relation to the future. It is trust in God with respect to the future. In hope man now trusts God as one who will surely do in the future what he has promised in the pac+, It is love of the companion appearing in the form of the expectation of divine love to be bestowed on him. Thus the love of Christ (and so of every companion how revalued as in Christ) appears in the form of hope for him. In a sense hope is the form which the love of God takes on the part of man in time who loves the God who is not yet manifest, the God who is the Father of Jesus Christ, God who is love. 5. Hope is the means by which future faith and love (of which God,</page><page sequence="6">156 NIEBUHR companion and self are subjects and objects) are brought into the present. "Everyone who has this hope set upon him purifieth himself." The more trusting the hope or the more hopeful the trust, the more it is possible now to respond to God and companions with anticipations of the love and faith that shall be. Hope makes for anticipated attainment of faith and love, as when the hopeful heir of immeasurable wealth is lavishly generous on a meager allowance. It all depends, of course, on what the self confidently expects. If it does not expect ample faith and love from God and his society, it will not respond in faith and love to its companions or to God in the present. If it expects to rule with the righteous, it may try to anticipate that attainment. Not only through anticipated attainment, but through preparation hope is the means for drawing the future into the present, as when the child prepares to become a man by accepting disciplines and by pre-enacting the role which it will play. 6. Finally, hope is the attitude which faith and love take toward the past. It is the expectation that the faith and love of God will redeem, restore, recreate the past- the personal and the human past. It is the expectation that whatever there was of love of God and his cause, of faithfulness among men will be resurrected, while all hatred and betrayal and mistrust will be destroyed. It says, "Behold all things will become new, including the past." NOTE Permission to publish this paper for the first time has been granted The JRE by Mrs. Florence M.
