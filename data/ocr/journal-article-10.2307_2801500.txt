<plain_text><page sequence="1">ZUCKERMAN, S. The social life of monkeys and apes; reissue of 1932 edition together with a postscript, xx, 511 pp., illus., bibliogr. London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1981. ?17.50 Though presented as a 'second edition', this book is in fact a re-issue of the original 1932 edition, together with an interesting new Post- script, a number of Appendices consisting mainly of published reviews, a hitherto unpub- lished lecture, and a brief introduction. In the Introduction the author frankly admits that although he tried to produce a revision of the book, 'other interests once again got in the way and made me push the work aside'. This re-issue of Zuckerman's original text spotlights the enormous amount that has hap- pened in primatology since 1932, mainly in the 1960's and 1970's, but very much continuing at the present time. Much of the best work has indeed been done on the very species studied by Zuckerman, the Hamadryas baboon. Nearly all the progress made with the understanding of this species has been accomplished by the keen observation and exemplary methods of Dr Hans Kummer of Zurich University and his col- leagues, working for the most part on wild animals in Ethiopia, though also using captive ones for hypothesis testing in Europe and the U.S.A. We now know that sex, held by Zuckerman to be the unifying element under- lying primate groups, is no more than one variable among many. We know that the sexual cycle of the female plays its part in the social as well as the reproductive process but this is no more than a minor part. We know about the process of 'kidnapping', about the 'I-D' system, and about the integration/rejection pheno- menon of females and males respectively into wild Hamadryas groups. We know about the growth and decline dynamics of one-male- groups, and the results of a male-heavy socio- nomic sex ratio, results that led to the dreadful fighting in London Zoo, watched, described and documented by Zuckerman. For example,</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 699 the photograph opposite p. 205 of his book shows some six adult males threatening one further adult male who has fled up a 'rock-face'; the caption reads 'Male baboons fighting-one against all'. Such scenes are now understood to be the product of human interference: the stress of confinement in an enclosure and the wrong sex ratio. In the wild there are bands of non-repro- ductive males, who do not fight among each other or with the so-called 'harem overlords' to use Zuckerman's anthropomorphic termnin- ology. The high levels of actual fighting and emphasis on agonistic relations described by Zuckerman, together with the animals' apparent obsession with ownership of females, are now seen to be cases of social pathology. Zuckerman did, in fact, suspect this, as is clear from the footnote on p. 220. Today the emphasis in primate field studies has left the whole frame of reference used by Zuckerman far behind. One of the main prob- lems that nowadays interests students of primate social life is the explanation of the social organisation of primates in the terms of theoretical sociobiology: inclusive fitness, kin selection and reciprocal altruism. Another is the explanation of social interaction in terms of cog- nitive processing, the documenting of cases where monkeys use their knowledge of each other as individuals to plan rather carefully cal- culated strategies of behaviour. In fact, some of the scenes described in Zuckerman's book could possibly be re-examined in the light of what has since been discovered. For example, some of the male-male alliances that occurred during the fighting may be explicable in terms of reciprocal altruism. But the snag is that, for such an analysis, each individual needs to be identified and, in Zuckerman's study, they are not. Parts of the book could also possibly be analysed as an example of a society under stress. The various distortions and breakdowns of normal behavioural processes and relationships provide a good example of what Michael Chance has called the transition from the 'hedonic' mode of social organisation, based on charismatic leaders who command the attention of their followers, to the 'agonic' mode, in which dominance hierarchies emerge based on violence and fighting. W. M. S. and C. Russell, in their book Violence, monkeys and man, have also drawn attention to the effects of crowding on the social interactions of primates. In the main, however, this book will remain the historical landmark it has been for the last few decades, a pioneering study of great origi- nality, now superseded by the great research effort put into the study of primate behaviour during the last two decades.
