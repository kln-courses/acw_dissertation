If we hear our own doubts in that description (ours is not an age easily charac- terized by the classical or the serene), then we are also hearing the hope which is the treatment for our convention. If it is a new country that we enter when we read her, then it is a new country that enters us as well, for it is poets like Elizabeth Bishop, poets who seem to stand outside the inevitable cours- ings of poetic trends, who have made the tradition of poetry in America today as rich and complex as at any other time in our history. Of all the poets of her generation, Bishop is perhaps the one whose body of work comes closest to perfection; that is to say, it is difficult to find even a single poem in which one word could be changed without somehow weakening the whole. That achievement, of course, wasn't easily come by; Lowell describes her painstaking process of composition in a poem from History : ... Do you still hang your words in air, ten years unfinished, glued to your notice board, with gaps or empties for the unimaginable phrase - unerring Muse who makes the casual perfect? Perhaps because of that enormous sense of patience and refine- ment, Bishop is also the one poet among her contemporaries who produced the smallest number of poems. Over a writing career which spanned nearly forty-five years, she published just less than ninety poems; an average of not quite two per year. 87</page><page sequence="2">Santos Her last book, Geography III , contained only nine poems and one translation, and it appeared nearly seven years after the pre- vious collection. Miss Bishop's reserve carried over into her public life as well: she was anything but a self-promoter. Until the last few years of her life, she avoided, for the most part, public readings and interviews; she was not aligned with any "school" of poetics, nor was she a follower of poetic fashion; and she did only a few relatively short stints teaching in colleges and universities. If it did not suggest something anachronistic, one could say there is a touch of the Dickinsonian about her: she can be painfully private, and yet she can also evoke a disarmingly intimate (if almost disembodied) sense of herself through her poems. And, like Dickinson, she is probably the most decepti- vely simple poet of her time. There are very few of Bishop's poems which do not seem readily accessible at first, yet very few can be resolved or exhausted on first readings. Like one of those Russian dolls - which, upon opening, one discovers contains another doll in- side, and another inside it, and another inside it - her poems open into succeeding levels of meaning and implication. And, as is true of only the very best poetry, Bishop's continually frus- trates paraphrase and single-thesis explanation. Nancy L. McNally, in her essay "Elizabeth Bishop: The Discipline of Description," suggests a possible reason for this: Frequently it is inappropriate even to apply customary terms such as theme and symbol to Miss Bishop's poems, many of which are constructed on an entirely different principle. The descriptive details themselves form the framework of this kind of poem, which then moves by their accumulation rather than by a more obvious struc- tural design. This aggregate method, which Marianne Moore termed "enumerative description," and Louise Bogan characterized as a "list of things or attributes re- lated to a title," is probably the single most original aspect of Miss Bishop's poetry. The relation of the parts to the whole is rarely more crucial or 88</page><page sequence="3">In the Throat of the Indian Princess symbiotic than in a Bishop poem. Within a structure which seems at times relentlessly discriminating, the poems provide a series of diminutive yet inclusive worlds, worlds which, by the sheer delicacy of their construction, appear to have left nothing out, and allowed no room for addition. Her own personal submersion in the factual reality of a poem may be something about which enough has already been written: how the "personality" somehow merges with the sub- ject (which is often an object) to the point that the "I" in the poem often concedes the role of primary dramatic force to the interplay of the perceptive, on the one hand, and the evocative, on the other. Still, that is a circumstance which is so crucial and peculiar to her work that it is often difficult to avoid mention- ing. One is even tempted to say that Miss Bishop's is less a poetry of "vision" (with its suggestions of didacticism and abstraction) than it is a poetry of "sight" (which suggests recognition and delineation); in her own prolepsis; " - 'vision' is I too serious a word - our looks." But to say, as some critics have, that Bishop is therefore merely copying from life, is to misunderstand the relationship between subject-matter and expression; and it is to misconstrue the nature of impersonal beauty. In his essay, "The Canada-Brazil Connection," Howard Moss comments on the sophisticated operations of this rather austere, almost clairvoyant style: As soon as we think of [an image of hers], we search for its accuracy in life, but also for its contradiction. We test an image by its reality, and by its reality we test the truth- fulness of the writer. It is by what one chooses to see and how one chooses to see it that this underground proving takes place. Not only does the image lead us to compar- isons and therefore to thought, but those eyes, in a sec- ond, put both the viewed and the viewer onto the scale. A whole new realm of possibilities is suggested in a kind of poem whose meanings, for the most part, reside in the sub- cutaneous structure of the lines. As J. D. McClatchy has pointed out, "More often than not her poems implicate ideas rather than explicate them." And one of the significant characteristics of her 89</page><page sequence="4">Santos work is that it still, within those prescribed limitations, achieves such a remarkable range of expression: from poems which seem purely descriptive (that is, poems which contain virtually no rhetorical comment at all and depend upon the interpretation of their details for meaning, poems like "A Cold Spring," "Cirque d'Hiver," "Florida," and "The Bight") - to poems that seem more openly personal and illustrative of the passionate voice of which she is so capable (poems like "The Armadillo," "Four Poems," "The Moose," and "The End of March"). But to draw even those distinctions is misleading, for the purely descriptive poems are not without passion and complexity, nor the more passionate poems without that flawless eye for detail. "Cirque d'Hiver" is a good example of the emotional depth one of Bishop's "descriptive" poems attains. The first two stanzas open with an objective description of a wind-up toy, "A little circus horse with real white hair" which "bears a little dancer on his back" who "stands upon her toes and turns and turns." These details are related with a kind of child-like fascin- ation and innocence, until midway through the third stanza, while retaining the same tone of voice, Bishop gradually un- ravels the shocking image which brings the poem to its full symbolic and suggestive weight (with its intimations of sexual violation and Freudian domination) in a startling mixture of violence and delicacy: He feels her pink toes dangle toward his back along the little pole that pierces both her body and her soul and goes through his, and reappears below under his belly, as a big tin key. Even in images which do seem intended as "merely descrip- tive," there is a resonance which carries them far beyond the realm of the decorative, as in these lines from "A Cold Spring": "Greenish-white dogwood infiltrated the wood,/ each petal burned, apparently, by a cigarette butt." And in these lines from 'The Blight": "Some of the little white boats are still piled up I against each other, or lie on their sides, stove in,/ and not yet 90</page><page sequence="5">In the Throat of the Indian Princess salvaged, if they ever will be, from the last bad storm ,/ like torn- open, unanswered letters." And these from "Under the Win- dow: Ouro Preto": "Oil has seeped into I the margins of the ditch of standing water II and flashes or looks upward brokenly,/ like bits of mirror - no, more blue than that:/ like tatters of the Morpho butterfly." Certainly it is something well beyond local color that we are seeing in those lines, and yet it is almost as if Bishop were trying to create the impression (or is it an illusion?) that there is no disjunction between the subject /object and the poet/perceiver. Noting this same inclination in writers such as James and Eliot, Hugh Kenner explains it this way: "The mind unviolated by an idea holds converse with particulars . . . mute particulars, mute mental particulars, the act of perception and the act of articulation inextricably one." But this particular disposition is not without its fundamental concerns: one often feels while reading a Bishop poem that her obsessive attention to the things before her eyes is really an attempt to hold them in place, almost as if, were she to leave anything out, the whole picture would be in danger of falling apart. Marjorie Perloff speculates on this condition as it is dramatized through the child-narrrator of Bishop's autobiographical story, "In the Village": The child learns that the only way to cope with her situation is to concentrate with all her might on the physical phenomena in her world, the objects in her field of vision. To be attentive to things, to nuances of color and texture and shape and sound, and to undergo simple daily rituals with fidelity and precision - this is the way to steel oneself against suffering. It is with an almost Lear-like faith in the power of language that Bishop approaches her subject. The German critic Sigurd Burkhardt defines the primary dramatic conflict Lear encoun- ters: ". . . he means to rid himself of the degrading intrusion of 'mere' fact into the gapless identity of 'sentence' and 'power/ of sovereign speech and the power of that speech to create what it stakes." The almost compulsive refinement of Bishop's poems seems set on accomplishing just that - on bringing the lan- 91</page><page sequence="6">Santos guage as close as possible to the act of creating its subject, by turning the subject round and round, by seeing it from different angles, by isolating its parts, by identifying its significant form, by recognizing its correspondances, until the subject has be- come embodied by the poem. Bishop shares her own meditation on this aspect of her work in the poem entitled "Poem (About the size of an old-style dollar bill)" whose subject is a small Nova Scotia landscape which the poet, after studying the painting, recognizes - to her surprise - as a place she, too, has known. Following a precise documentation of the details of the painting, the poet muses on its implications: that despite the fact she never knew the artist (her great-uncle), the painting (through the artist's attention to its detail) has supplied a crucial link between them, a correspondance (and note the curious absence of the negative "but" between the first and second sentences): I never knew him. We both knew this place, apparently, this literal small backwater, looked at it long enough to memorize it, our years apart. How strange. And it's still loved, or its memory is (it must have changed a lot). Our visions coincided - "visions" is too serious a word - our looks, two looks: art "copying from life" and life itself, life and the memory of it so compressed they've turned into each other. Which is which? John Ashbery's remarks from the "Second Presentation of Elizabeth Bishop" for the Neustadt International Prize for Literature are significant in identifying the way this preoccupa- tio carries over into an almost metaphysical debate (although, in Bishop's poems, all debate seems subdued by a perpetual series of intricate refusals: "the child draws another inscrutable house"!): "It is this continually renewed sense of discovering the strangeness, the unreality of our reality at the very moment of becoming conscious of it as reality, that is the great subject for Elizabeth Bishop." And the great question, which David Kal- stone raises and examines in his essay from Five Temperaments: ". . . how is meaning developed from individual and unamplified details?" In so many of Bishop's poems one senses a barely noticeable 92</page><page sequence="7">In the Throat of the Indian Princess patina on the real objects which make up the world, as if the poet had somehow caught them, as Mr. Ashbery suggests, at the very moment of their passage from one state into another. If that is the motivating force in her poems, then where in that process does the experience of the individual self come into play? Helen Vendler's essay, "Domestication, Domesticity and the Otherworldly," provides one answer to this question by explaining a dynamic principle of inconstancy which makes any identification Bishop attempts at once personal, precarious and transfigureable. As Mrs. Vendler points out, there is a "con- tinuing vibration [in] her work between two frequencies - the domestic and the strange." And therein lies the polar interplay of both object and emotion, subject and ramification: a sudden fluctuation in mood is recorded in a simile, "black, naked women with necks I would round and round with wire/ like the necks of light bulbs"; and a sweeping rhetorical gesture is delivered in a strange anthropomorphic guise: The alligator, who has five distinct calls: friendliness, love, mating, war, and a warning - whimpers and speaks in the throat of the Indian Princess. This persistent transaction between object, eye, and a mind becomes for Bishop an ultimate dramatic concern, becomes a "Theater of the spirits: objects putting the laws of identity through hoops." And within this theatre one discovers the sometimes grave ambition of this poet: "to see what it was I was." For one cannot always wholly trust the senses to provide the correct proportions of the whole; like one of Joseph Cor- nell's boxes "where things hurry away from their names," reality is a place where the artist is the significant arbiter of proportions and ratios and relationships. In discussing Bishop's lines, "The little white churches have dropped into the matted hills/ like lost quartz arrowheads," Lorrie Goldensohn assesses this method apportioning: To take a little shape like the pointed arrowhead, and put that against the point of a church's facade with a spire or 93</page><page sequence="8">Santos tower is to collapse space, or shape, into abstract visual code. . . . Part of the effectiveness of this technique is the way in which some root fact or belief is always contra- vened, corrected, or dislodged. This is the special condition of Bishop's engagement with the world, and of the covenant she has established, thereof, between reality and the imagination. For Bishop's relationship to the world, one soon discovers, is never ambivalent - indeed, one senses that lingering behind the impeccable facade of her work is a presence that is both ominous and incommunicable. And all that seems to keep it from welling over into chaos, from breaking through the facade, is the unrelenting double nature of the poet, the cold purifying judgment: to see and to imagine. It is the drama of sensibility: I was saying it to stop the sensation of falling off the round, turning world into cold, blue-black space. 94</page></plain_text>
