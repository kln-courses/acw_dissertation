<plain_text><page sequence="1">Phoenician Maritime Religion: Sailors, Goddess Worship, and the Grotta Regina Mark A. Christian Summary Devotion to the goddess Tanit/Tinnit, a permutation of Astarte, took place in Mediter ranean cave sanctuaries and on Phoenician ships. Employing both material and textual evidence, it is argued that her worship at sea and at port required a degree of religious competency of seamen that served as crew and combatants on trading vessels and mil itary vessels, respectively. With the Phoenician priesthood centered in cities, coastal in habitants would have depended on part-time officiants to supervise and perform certain rites. Reasons for the lack of mention in the literature of this non-elite class are proposed. i. Introduction The present essay1 sets sail for Phoenician-Punic coastal zones in order to search out evidence of Phoenician maritime religion and to foreground cer tain of its characteristics, one of which is devotion of the goddess Tanit (al ternately spelled Tinnit2), a spirited permutation of Astarte.3 The follow ing coastal survey provides the grid on which to formulate a thesis of an cient seamen with religious proficiencies on board, some of whom may have This paper was first presented to the Expressions of Religion in Israel program unit, Interna tional Society of Biblical Literature meeting, Amsterdam, July 2012. It has since been revised and shortened. Frank Moore Cross, Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic: Essays in the History of the Religion of Israel (Cambridge: Harvard University, 1973), 32 and n. 199 rejects proposals associating the name of Semitic Tanit/Tannit with tnt "gift." "Such a derivation is impossible for the name of the goddess Tannit. The Greek transcriptions and parallel data are clear that nun is doubled and that a vowel in the i-class follows." In this essay we use the familiar spelling of Tanit with single /n/, though the evidence presented by Hans-Peter Müller (KAI 164,1 [et passim], tnjt, and tnnt) may move opinion in the direction of Tinnit. See Miiller's article "Tinnit," in Brill's New Pauly, 719. Proto-Sinaitic Text 347 tnt (tannittu) is an early attestation of the epithet "Tannit." Found on a sphinx in the Hathor temple, the epithet in this text may be a parallel epithet to lb['lt], "to the Lady [of Byblus]," reconstructed by W. F. Albright (Cross, Canaanite Myth, 32). Judges 11:40 displays a perhaps related root meaning "to lament" min1? (Lipínski, Dieux et déesses de l'univers phénicien etpunique [Leuven 1995], 199). It has been conjectured that linn in Hosea 8:9 means "receive a prostitute's pay"; the Hosea text however may be corrupt. Whereas the father of the gods presided over the Phoenician pantheon, a goddess was the principal figure in that pantheon. Die Welt des Orients, 43.

Christian served as quasi-priests4 at Phoenician-Punic grottos and similar out-of-the way shrines5 used by coastal communities6 and docked seafarers. The Achae menid period predominates in this study, though our exploration of its top ics mandates recourse to Hellenistic times as well.7 The Problem A curiosity in the literature meets us in the virtual non-mention of the mar iners possessing these skills, yet such expertise is assumed in the examples offered below, which should not be regarded as particularly exceptional. An cient literature tends to leave out details, for example, for rhetorical effect or things that might detract from the authorial/redactional agenda. The Book of Psalms barely mentions priests, and yet their involvement (particularly levitical priests) in the production and publication of the hymns was cer tainly significant.8 One finds a similar lack of detail in both biblical and clas sical literature regarding mariner proficiencies with skills other than general military or nautical competency. And yet mid-level religious proficiency is For proposals regarding (re)categorizing of religious officiants, see Mark A. Christian, "Middle-Tier Levites and the Plenary Reception of Revelation," in Levites and Priests in Bib lical History and Tradition (eds. M. Leuchter and J. Hutton), SBLAIL 9 (Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2011), 171-95, 187, 190-97; idem., Levites and the Plenary Reception of Revelation, Dissertation, Vanderbilt University, Nashville 2011, forthcoming in OBO, Fri bourg/Göttingen. The term "shrine" in this essay is not restricted to constructions inside temples, for example the "inner sanctuary" I'll and "holy of holies" in D'EHpn snp in the Jerusalem temple (1 Kings 6:16f.). Rather it includes small, natural sanctuaries such as the Grotta Regina. There could of course be a particularly holy sector within the sanctuary. For our purposes the emphasis is on the sacredness of the entire cave sanctuary. For thoughts on the applicability of Old Testament terminology to Levantine temples in general, see J. Kamlah, "Temples of the Levant - Comparative Aspects", in J. Kamlah (ed.) Temple Building and Temple Cult: Architecture and Cultic Paraphernalia of Temples in the Levant (2-1 Mill. B.C.E.), (ADPV 41; Harrassowitz: Wiesbaden 2012), 507-34, 507f. et passim. Though coastal communities do not face only toward the sea, their lives are impacted by a watery world. One may define non-maritime people as those who know little or nothing of the sea, ports, sea vessels and the people that live near and travel on it. Cf. Jesse Ransley, "Maritime Communities and Traditions," in The Oxford Handbook of Maritime Archaeology (Oxford: Oxford UP 2011), 879-903,895-97. Especially helpful for the Hellenistic era has been the article by Martin Eckert,"Die Aphrodite der Seefahrer," HEPHAISTOS 28 (2011), 99-124. I would like to thank Rüdiger Schmitt for making this important study available to me. Two additional, well-known examples meet us in the deuterocanonical Ben Sira; in his Praise of the Ancestors (chs. 44-50) Moses' brother Aaron and his high-priestly descendants are exalted over Moses. Opposite the emphasis on the Aaronite priests, Ben Sira never mentions Levites. On another front, we find details and pre-scientific elaborations (e.g., in Herodotus; Josephus) that prove distracting or tendentious, yet they were deemed important enough to be retained.</page><page sequence="3">Phoenician Maritime Religion 181 often assumed in ancient literature. Questions of how and to what extent these individuals received training are not treated in the present study.9 Filling in the blanks of ancient texts continues to be risky business, par ticularly at the stage of research when corroborating material evidence has not yet surfaced. This study endeavors to combine epigraphic, archaeolog ical and textual witnesses with anthropological and sociological reasoning. Texts are read literary-critically. Here my moorings in biblical studies will be evident. Aspects of my proposals are speculative and in some cases inten tionally provocative. They will need to be followed up with further research by specialists. It is hoped that this essay will induce further discussion, and that textual and other evidences will surface lending credence to our propos als and advancing the research into the maritime religion of ancient peoples of the Mediterranean. Raison d'etre One may describe Phoenician seafaring was an assortment of large and small exchange networks, with the ships differing in size, type of cargo, the routes they took, and economic origins. While the research into maritime religion of the Phoenicians is underway, the topic of the mariners performing rites needs to be explored. Some crew members would have been selected because of their multiple skills, e.g., training not only in seamanship and military ma neuvers but also in the distinctive mariner religion in which female deities such as Asherah, 'Astarte, and Tanit played vital roles in their watery-world existence.10 For the ancient mariner, successful voyages depended on more than knowledge of boats, weather, and sea. They must also curry the favor and protection of the god(dess). And yet such favor would not come by way of the ministrations of a full-time priest travelling with them. Instead, we propose that non-elite personnel (cf. middle-tier priests11) with a measure 9 I explore matters such as schools where non-elites received matters in detail in the publi cations listed in n. 4 above, primarily in Israel but with significant recourse to other Near Eastern cultures. 10 The discussion of where such training occurred is similar in some respects to the question of literacy beyond the urban context in the ancient world - a fervently debated and ongoing debate. I have argued elsewhere for the existence of non-elite "schools" in Israel where one could acquire a measure of literacy. Epigraphic and other evidences document a lower level of literacy. See, e.g., the lengthy discussion in Christian, Dissertation. 11 Analogies exist for middle- and lower-tier priests in Egyptian literature. The caste system of Egyptian priests, for example, was not altogether fixed. Although often appointed by the Pharaoh, the high priest (the sem-priest) in some instances climbed up the clerical ladder of success. The higher order of priests were the hmw-ntr (literally "servants of god") who were deemed "prophets" by the Greeks. The middle-tier priests (w'b; Grk oi aXXoi tepei? "the rest of the priests") had various specializations (e.g., in astrology, horology, and heal ing) and accordingly specific responsibilities. The "shrine-bearers" (wnw) were the lower tier religious personnel; they were quasi- or non-priests. Lowest on the religious functionary</page><page sequence="4">182 Mark A. Christian of cultic training facilitated essential rites, whether at the time of launch, on board, or at isolated coastal stops (e.g., cave sanctuaries). Healing activ ity known to have taken place in Phoenician-Punic caves was one of the rites that required an officiant of some kind. But remote conventicles could hardly support full-time personnel. Who might then instruct worshippers and as sist worship activities? Current State of Scholarship Scholars contributing to the study of the goddess Tanit, who figures cen trally in the religion of Phoenician and Punic mariners, include Giuseppe Garbati, Eduard Lipiñski, Bärbel Mörstadt, and Hans-Peter Müller. Archae ologist and biblical scholar Aaron Brody has brought together several of the subjects treated in this paper, including that of maritime religion and its practitioners. This includes instructive observations on the biblical story of Jonah12 on the one hand, and the Grotta Regina and the Goddess Tanit, whose sign is etched on the cave's inner walls, on the other. Brody has not to my knowledge explored questions regarding the skill set, particularly in the religious sphere, of the crew. He follows Piero Bartolom13 in interpret ing the ships drawn on the Grotta Regina's walls (Figs. 5-6) as not merely trade ships but military vessels. I agree with this assessment, which has pos sible ramifications for the interpretation of the other art work in the cave, as well as my proposal that some crew members were quasi-priests and/or part-time warriors - alternatively described as seafaring combatant-priests. In his seminal essay on Sicily, Gioacchino Falsone conjectures the existence of a coastal Punic établissement within which the grottos would have been linked.14 The hypothesis currently awaits corroborative archaeological evi totem pole lay magicians who instructed the community in the rudiments of Egyptian reli gion; cf.

Preliminary Comments on Phoenician-Punic Cave Sanctuaries The investigation of the location of Phoenician and Punic grottos and the artifactual evidence found within them reveals the non-professional and in deed "popular" nature of the etchings on the cave walls of the Grotta Regina, a prehistoric site located some 180 m. above sea level on the slopes north of Palermo, Sicily. Frequented between the fifth and first centuries BCE, the cave sanctuary shows evidence of ritual activities that commend it for our research, particularly with regard to those who officiated religious rites prac tices in them. 2. Phoenician Coastal Outposts in Sicily Whereas Greeks founded their first colonies along the Ionian coast of Eastern Sicily, the Phoenicians settled in the West, on the Tyrian coast (e.g., Solanto and Palermo) as well as the coast of the Libyan sea opposite North Africa (e.g., at the Island of Motya).16 They ventured far into the western Mediter ranean, establishing trading posts and founding colonies.17 With respect to Sicilian outposts, one sees a pattern of establishment com mon to Phoenician cities of the East in that they are often situated on rocky promontories or on small islands vis-ä-vis the coast.18 Such outposts bene 15 There is evidence suggesting the distance between Phoenician maritime trade posts was dis tanced equally, perhaps a reflecting the desire to have night harbors at reasonable distances; see Christer Westerdahl, "The Maritime Cultural Landscape" in The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology (1992) 21.1: 5-14, 7. 16 Falsone, "Sicile," 676f.; Edward Lipiriski, "The Phoenicians," in J. Sasson (ed.), Civilizations of the Ancient Near East, New York 1995, 2:1321-1333,1324, places the western expansion of Phoenicians in the 9th century B.C., "when the third and dominant group of Phoenician pottery, red-slip ware, was spreading from Phoenicia proper." The ware was introduced to Cyprus, North Africa, Sicily, Sardinia, and Spain toward the end of the tenth century; idem, Dieux et déesses, Leuven 1995,26-44. Western Sicilian coasts were first colonized by Phoeni cians, followed by Carthagians (ibid., 32). 17 "Trading lanes" in the east Mediterranean flourished already in the Late Bronze Age. Cyprus played a particularly key role in the region's trade during the years 1450-1230 BCE. See Dan E. McCaslin, Stone Anchors in Antiquity: Coastal Settlements and Maritime Trade-routes in the Eastern Mediterranean ca. 1600-1050 B.C., SIMA 61, Göteborg: Paul Äströms Förlag, 1980,116. 18 See the classic study of Mediterranean promontories by Ellen Churchill Semple, "The Tem pled Promontories of the Ancient MediterraneanAuthor," Geographical Review 17, no. 3 (1927): 353-86. The recently discovered Tells Beirut (1994-1998) and Burak (2001) were both built on promontories, the former on a rocky promontory near a natural port and the latter on an artificial promontory built on the massive ruins of a Bronze Age palace; see Héléne</page><page sequence="6">184 Mark A. Christian fit from good interior ports on creeks, coves, and natural inlets.19 One may characterize Motya as an insular city ("était une cité insulaire") similar to Tyre or Arwad, and other colonies in the Occident.20 Precipitous Coastal Établissements Other établissements21 have been identified in the mountains rising up on the coast west of Palermo. Small sites at the foot of the summit of Monte Pel legrino22 are characterized by the presence of coins, ceramics, and Punic ana phoras. With little possibility of agricultural endeavor at this rocky height, Falsone supposes garrisons of soldiers were stationed there to defend the mountain, perhaps during the episodes of the first Punic war in which Paler mo and its territory were implicated.23 It is plausible to think that the com mander selected a few soldiers with a measure of religious expertise qualify ing them to lead or assist religious activities in remote locations. Thucydides reports that subsequent to the earlier arrival of Phoenicians in Sicily, west ern areas of the island including Motya,24 Palermo, and Solanto25 provided Sader, "L'archéologie phénicienne en Orient: quel avenir?", in Nuevas Perspectivas I: La In vestigación Fenicia y Púnica, J. Vita and J. Zamora (eds.)&gt; Barcelona: 2006, 27-36, 30. 19 Falsone, "Sicile," 680. 20 Ibid., 680. Motya was destroyed in 397 B.C., after which its inhabitants emigrated to dry land where they founded Lilybée on a promontory of the same name. Lilybée thus replaced Motya as the principally strategic fortification of Punic Sicily. It was equipped with powerful forti fications and at least two ports that were very difficult to access. Indeed, navigation around the promontory, with its numerous banks and shallows, required great skill. For an aerial view of the archaic necropolis and industrial zone of Motya, see V. Tusa, "Sicily," in Moscati (ed.), The Phoenicians, London 1988,231-253, 235. 21 Ibid., 682. I retain Falsone's use of the French word établissement in several instances, as it conveys connotations such as "organization," "institution," "settlement," and "establish ment." 22 Monte Pellegrino is traditionally identified with Mount Heirkte. 23 Falsone, ad loe. S. Barbantani, "Goddess of Love and Mistress of the Sea: Notes on a Hellenis tic Hymn to Arsinoe-Aphrodite," AncSoc 35, 2005, 135-165, 155f., informs on two Cyprian sanctuaries situated in towns named after Queen Arsinoe. Located some 60 stadia apart, each had a mooring place and a temple. Palaepaphus was located high above the sea (ca. ten stadia), its temple dedicated to the Paphian Aphrodite. The other was situated near Cape Zephyrion. Each year took place a procession between the two town/sanctuaries of men and women from all over the island; cf. Strabo XIV 6.3. 24 During the 5th century BCE, Motya, situated on the modern island of San Pataleo, developed into a well-fortified town. Half of its population was Greek, which facilitated the flourishing commerce Motya enjoyed with Elymians and Greeks; CAHIV, 744. Tophets (cemeteries for the cremated remains of children, mainly boys of ages 6-12) have been uncovered at Motya. The victims were possibly sacrificed to Tanit or Ba'al Hammon; Corinne Bonnet and P. Xella, "La Religion," in Krings (ed.) La civilisation Phénicienne et Punique, 316-333, 331-333, emphasize the contrast between the evidence of tophets in the Occident and lack of such in the Orient; cf. A. J.

It is unlikely that no one would have the skill to facilitate basic or key rites. The sanctuaries and shrines of the area reflect a dynamic of retreat, of seeking solace and favor from the gods. There one finds a pronounced em phasis on deities of life, healing, protection, and war mixed with a resurgence of traditional (Phoenician) religiosity.27 To the extent semi-regular commu nication between these small sanctuaries had been desired it is worthwhile to think in terms of part-time, non-elite personnel providing for spiritual and doubtless other needs of worn travelers. Part-time "coastal ministers" may have supplemented their share of dedicated gifts with commercial endeav ors, for example, working as trading "middlemen." Similar officiants have been described as serving on ships patrolling the contested waters of the Mediterranean.28 the proximity of the necropolis and tophet on the northern coast of Motya in Tusa, "Sicily," 235; the "various levels of small urns containing the burnt remains of sacrifices" range from the early 7th to "well into the 3rd century" (ibid., 236). The term tophet does not appear in Phoenician-Punic texts, but rather in the Hebrew Bible (Valley of Ben Hinnom), associated with the lemma mlk, which may connote this practice. Michaela Bauks, "Kinderopfer als Weihe- oder Gabeopfer. Anmerkungen zum mlk-Opfer," in Witte and Diehl (eds.) Israeliten und Phönizier, 233-251,245-249 raises questions about the interpretation of a passage like 2 Kings 3:27, "der älteste Beleg." The passage may in some respects legitimate child sacrifice in 7th-6th century Israel, which would precede the Punic-Phoenician inscriptional evidence. Later texts condemn the practice, which did not originate among ancient Canaanites, nor was it necessarily regulated; rather, it constituted a desperate action taken in extreme situations. 25 Several km. east of Palermo sits a Phoenician colony on the Tyrian coast south of Cape Zafferano of which Thucydides makes mention: the colony of Solanto (Lat. Soluntum; Grk. SoXóeii;; Phoen. kfr). Of exceptional natural beauty, Solanto is situated where the coast is elevated and carved out. The colony saw its inception in the fourth century BCE. Recent ex cavations situate it on the actual promontory of Solanto and on the small plateau next to St. Cristofaro. Solanto integrates quite well into the typology of Phoenician étahlissements. 26 Falsone, "Sicile," 675. 27 Our use of the term "religiosity" is not pejorative but rather encompasses the broad, socio logical sense that connotes plethoric aspects of religious expression and activity. 28 Cf. Brody, "Further Evidence," 180. From the seventh century, Phoenician warships were rowed from an upper and lower levels. Round shields attached to the sides of the upper deck provided some protection for soldiers. Similar shields were known from reliefs to protect passengers on Phoenician ferries. See G. F. Bass, "Sea and River Craft in the Ancient Near East," in J. Sasson (ed.) CANE, 1421-31,1430.This indicates the diversity within the seafar ing demographic, which in turn suggests the likelihood of persons with various skills that serving in capacities unannounced in the literature. Just as an ancient captain would want to know of passengers or crew religious expertise, a modern captain would be interested in knowing of passengers or crew with crisis-averting skills, e.g., heart-specialist physicians, those bearing arms, etc. Aaron J.

Christian 3. The Grotta Regina Sanctuary Of particular interest for this study is a small, eminently distinctive site, the Grotta Regina cave sanctuary. Still accessible today, Grotto Regina is a prehis toric cave located on the northeastern slopes of Mount Cape Gallo in north ern Sicily29 (north of Palermo and above Modello). The grotto was used as a rupestral sanctuary in the late Punic era.30 We unfortunately lack infor mation on temples and sanctuaries31 in the Phoenician-Punic tradition. A number of those discovered in Motya date back to ancient times, though most (e.g., Solanto, Selinonte, Monte Adranone and and the Grotta Regina) show more activity in the Hellenistic era.32 Devotees of underworld and fer tility deities frequented the Grotta Regina at least from the fourth-century BCE.33 "Le lieu saint de la Grotta Regina"34 boasts uniquely painted walls - rare among the Punic tombs of Sicily. The walls are graced with numerous in scriptions and dedications to Semitic deities and religious symbols, includ ing a sign meaning "of Tanit" (Fig. 1). The style of the paintings has been noted for its distinctive popular characteristics.35 The sanctuary bears "little trace of official forms of worship ... [it] appears to have been devoted solely to popular cults and the worship of healing/health deities,"36 for example 29 Archaeological evidence confirms permanent Phoenician installations from the 8th century B.C. Although many have posited an earlier Phoenician presence in the 11th-9th centuries, beginning with Thucydide's "pre-colonization period" thesis and modern theories based on Canaanite prototypes, the most recent analyses of material evidence do not bear this theory out (Falsone, "Sicile," 675,677f.). 30 Ibid., 683. 31 A sharp differentiation between temple (Lat. Templum) and sanctuary is not drawn in this study. In general, the former is larger because it connotes both the holy place of a sanctuary and the sacral structure. The same apparently holds true in German; see Bärbel Mörstadt, "Phönizische Heiligtümer im Mitteimeeraum und ihre Kulteinrichtung," in J. Kamiah (ed.) Temple Building and Temple Cult: Architecture and Cultic Paraphernalia of Temples in the Levant (2-1 Mill.

To the extent official pronouncement of the healings occurring in these shrines was thought necessary, and depending on the circumstances or ailment, access to a local cultic functionary conversant in the proper procedures of thanksgiving could be important. The Bible provides examples of such officiation (cf. Lev 13:18ff., inter alia; Psalm 30; 107:17-21; Jer 17:14-16; Ezek 34:1-6 [absence of healing authorities]; Matt 8:4/ Mark 1:44 / Luke 5:14).</page><page sequence="9">Phoenician Maritime Religion 187 Shadrapa (Phoen. Sdrp'),37 one of the manifestations of Eshmun.38 Falsone wonders whether other grottos await discovery and conjectures the existence of a coastal Punic établissement within which the grottos would have been linked.39 There would be strategic benefit to the supervision of and com munication between shore-based facilities: the improvement to the ancient communication network could, for one thing, forestall threats to national or imperial interests in the region. Such supervision would not be disinterested in the religious practices and potential revenue retrieved from local sanc tuaries. The notion has economic benefits as well because of the distance decay relationships between items of trade and the distances of those items from their source such as an entrepot.40 Some cargo deteriorates rapidly and therefore must reach a destination within a day or two.41 Shorter voyages are sometimes characterized as tramping, a type of shipping that moves slowly between more closely spaced ports operating along the coast.42 As for the organization of these trade voyages, already in the Bronze Age there is evi dence of centralized authorities "exercising control over the production and trade" of important commodities such as ox-hide ingots.43 37 A. Brody, "Further Evidence," 180; Lipiñski, Dieux etdéesses, 195-199; Falsone, "Sicile," 689; C. F Bond!, "La Société," in Krings (ed.) La civilisation phénicienne et punique, 345-353, 330f.; cf. Ribichini, "Beliefs," 130-31: "In Amrith, the inscription on a 5th-century B.C. vo tive tablet mentions the name of the god Shadrapa ("Shed, the Healer"), which also appears on an ostrakon from Sarepta and in Punic, Palmyrene and Greek inscriptions from Syria; an other inscription at the end of the 5th century B.C. records the offering of a statue to the god Eshmun. Greek dedications from Delos mention, among the Phoenician gods of Ascalon, the Palestinian 'Astarte and a marine Ba'al." 38 Bonnet and Xella ("La Religion," 323) maintain that worshippers' desire to be close to their deities increased in the Hellenistic period "dans la religion phénico-punique comme dans la religion classique ... c'est dans ce cadre que fleurissent les cuites salutiferes et les divinités guérisseuses. A leur propos, on sait relativement peu de choses dans le monde phénico punique, mais on note un intérét plus grand pour Eshmoun - identifié ä Asclépios-Esculape, Shadrapa, Horan, les dieux égyptiens et des divinités demeurées anonymes qui voient af fhier dans leurs sanctuaires des offrandes representant les parties du corps atteintes par la maladie ou déja guéries gräce ä l'intervention du dieu." 39 Falsone, "Sicile," 683-684." 40 Richard A.

Gould does not remark on the skill set or religion of these seafarers. An al ternative explanation of the origin of Bronze Age Trade sees it evolving through regional exchange networks. The networks began as specialized trade by the wealthy, perhaps de veloping through formal gift exchanges operating outside more utilitarian modes of trade within or between differing cultural systems (ibid., 161-63).</page><page sequence="10">188 Mark A. Christian 4. Lower-ranking Religious Functionaries Let us look for a moment at urban religiosity while keeping rural worship contexts in view. Public worship typically took place in urban sanctuaries fi nanced by revenue such as sacrifices and votive offerings. In some instances builders constructed urban sanctuaries on large plots of land.44 Phoenician kings officiated at larger worship events such as seasonal festivals. The Sido nian kings Tabnit and Eshmun'azor carried the title KHN 'ASRT before their title. Byblian kings' religious functions were also important, though they do not carry the sacerdotal title.45 Priests would have officiated the other cere monies, though kings were known to take on priestly functions.46 The Phoenician priesthood divided into several hierarchical levels. "At the summit there was a high priest, who presided over a number of priests and priestesses; below them was a range of minor functionaries, from butchers to perfume masters, from scribes to slaves."47 It would have been the lower ranking functionaries that found opportunity to use their talents and sup plement their income as part-time personnel who could officiate events at rural sanctuaries, perhaps one as small as the Grotta Regina.48 If analogy to the sharp demotion of land priests (Levites) by urban priests (Zadokites) in the Hebrew Bible (e.g., Ezekiel 44:9-15) is worthwhile, one finds elite priests edging out the cultic competition, restricting access to the lucrative rites (e.g., altar worship) at larger temples, leaving lower ranking personnel in insecure positions, to the extent they are categorized among the personae miserae. Pentateuchal law regards the plight of the non-elite, middle-tier priests (Levites) very seriously, even enacting laws to provide a portion of the tithe for them and the other very vulnerable: aliens, orphans, and widows (Deuteronomy 14:27-29; 16:11, 14; 26:12-13).49 Whereas in the Pentateuch 44 Ribichini,"Beliefs" 137-38. 45 See Josette Elayi, Byblos, cité sacrée (8e-4e s. av.

Xella, "La Religion," 324; see also Bondi, "La Société," 346, who contrasts the society of Phoenician city-states oriented in the royal palace with the "very different echelon" consisting of "messengers, employees of diverse rank, functionaries, workers and 'slaves'" 48 On special occasions in which a sizeable number of people would be present the Grotta may have hosted an event along the lines of the marzéah, an admittedly problematic concept/term to apply in broad fashion. The term is known in Ugaritic, biblical, and Aramaic texts and denotes a kind of ritual symposium or sacred banquet (Ribichini, "Beliefs," 136). For use of the term in the Hebrew text of Amos 6:7; Jer 16:5, varied interpretations in LXX, and contextualization in the ancient Semitic east, see Briquel-Chatonnet, Les relations entre les cites de la cote phenicienne et les royaumes d'Israel et de Juda (OLA 46; Studia Phoenicia 12, 1992), 325-331.

Tanit was a powerful yet approach able deity for seafarers living precarious lives. The likelihood exists that some lower-ranking Phoenician religious per sonnel had other seasonal or part-time vocations. Some may have had mil itary experience. If Falsone's proposal of an interconnected group of Punic coastal sanctuaries has merit - one might envision seaman/lower-ranking functionaries participating and/or officiating at occasional events at such cultic locations and nearby inland sites. Although one cannot speak with certainty about a semi-professional offi ciant presiding over conventicles such as the Grotta Regina,50 rites such as healings would be performed and need to be verified. Moreover, aspects of worship in which slaves were involved may have figured in the activities of wayside chapels, and not just at larger sites. 5. Spiritual Intuition on the Mediterranean: Analogy from the New Testament The New Testament provides an intriguing account of one veteran traveler's experiences at sea. The Acts of the Apostles (ch. 27) give a glimpse of the cooperation between unlikely bedfellows, a Roman centurion and a prisoner bound ultimately for Rome who shows himself to be a man of the gods. The Apostle Paul survived three shipwrecks and other dangers (2 Corinthians 11:25-6). In Letter to the Romans 15:22-29 he recounts a voyage to Spain. Acts 27 recounts the deadly "northeaster" blowing from Crete that initi ated two weeks of nightmarish travel towards Italy. St. Paul's spiritual intu ition reportedly saves two-hundred and seventy souls, though the ship it self runs aground and rapidly breaks apart in the vicinity of Malta. The sol diers are wont to execute prisoners to prevent escape but the ship's centurion steps in to save Paul. While the story does not lack for the miraculous, the assumption of religious leadership by a man of the gods who provides guid ance during a protracted ordeal seems, for the ancient Mediterranean world, not so exceptional. The learned Paul had advised against setting sail in the first place, a sound forecast that led the centurion to rely on the man skilled in the sacred. Though there is nothing in the New Testament suggesting Paul was a priest, the centurion and other crew members may have viewed him as either a bona fide priest or, as we are proposing in this study, a part-time or 50 Cf. ibid., 324.</page><page sequence="12">190 Mark A. Christian quasi-priest. In popular settings religious titles and categories could be very fluid.51 The combination of Roman military might and desperate dependence on spiritual direction at sea presented in Acts 27 offers a sequence of events that the ancients thought possible on Mediterranean voyages. Regarding our in terest in seafarers with undeclared (at least in the literature) religious com petencies, a couple of points can be made: if the Jewish-prisoner Paul could become so valuable52 during this Roman voyage (which in some respects was not very exceptional), a captain or crew member with similar religious skill(s) would arguably be valued all the more.53 Moreover, crew members or seafaring soldiers that showed themselves particularly valuable would be recommended to others planning such voyages. The extant literature how ever neither designates them by title nor subcategorizes them. Finally, moderns should bear in mind that the navigational instruments of ancient vessels were limited to sounding rods and lines. Seafarers accord ingly sought direction from all available sources, particularly sources with reputations of reliability. 6, The Goddesses of Phoenician Mariners Let us now consider maritime religion, in particular its inclination for god dess worship. The following shines light on the specialized religion(s) of Phoenician seafarers in view of their distinctive religious needs and senti ments. Their goddess of choice was Tanit, the mother goddess54 of the west ern Phoenician or Carthaginian pantheon. The theonym Tan(n)it is attested in the Orient from the beginning of the eighth century BCE, but not until the fifth or beginning of the fourth century in Carthage. The Greeks called her 51 In Acts 14:11 Paul's involvement in a healing leads to the comparison of his skill with that of the gods, specifically Hermes. Walking away from a poisonous snake bite and further involvement in healings on Malta leads to similar attributions (28:1-9). 52 According to the Acts narrative, Paul's Roman citizenship had been made known to the cen turion in ch. 22:25-29. One would think such a detail would have been mentioned to his Roman captors. 53 In early Christian missions after Constantine (306-37 CE) priority was given to seafarers serving their land's goals of military expansion, defense, or exploration. Soldiers going to sea were to be accompanied by the people and things that enabled their faith to travel with them. The priest Leif Eriksson ministered to voyagers during his voyage to the New World (ca. 1000). Franciscan friars ministered to the navies of the Crusades, holding mass, hearing con fessions, and offering prayers. In the event priests sailed as passengers, the understanding was that they would offer the same services to the passengers and crew. See Robin Dale Mat tison, "Seafarer's Mission," Encyclopedia of Christianity (Eerdmans/Brill: 1999), 4:889-95. 54 It is unclear whether Tanit was viewed as a divine creator of a child by the Phoenicians like El, 'Astarte, Milk/Molk, Shalem, and Bastet. Cf. R. Albertz, "Personal Names and Family Re ligion," in Albertz/Schmitt, Family and Household Religion, 387-428, 346f.</page><page sequence="13">Phoenician Maritime Religion 191 0ENNEI0 or 0IN(N)I0. The Latinized name is Thinissut. The origin and meaning of the name has not been determined.55 In her study of small sanctuaries along the Spanish coast, Maria Semmler reports that the priests in charge periodically removed offerings left in caves such as Grotto Es Cuyam of Ibiza, where, incidentally, a number of Tanit statuettes have turned up (Fig. 2). We unfortunately lack further details of the type, status, and functions of the priests at Es Cuyam.56 The necropolis at the island of Ibiza (and see further comments below) is a large enough religious center to support a full-time cultic specialist, who would proba bly have regional jurisdiction that included some inland territory. The same could be said for the Umm el-Amed complex in South Lebanon,57 and per haps also Grotto Es Cuyam. Such would not be the case, however, at smaller and more remote shrines such as the Grotta Regina. This differentiation is not certain, but it does suggest another criterion could be added to defini tions of Naturheiligtümer, namely, in view of the size and accessibility of the sanctuary scholars should give thought to the type of personnel needed to serve that particular site.58 Tanit and 'Astarte Though in one sense an individual goddess, Tanit, like Asherah and 'Astarte, was a complex figure whose characteristics could be quite fluid. Associated first with 'Astarte in Carthage, she would eventually radiate out to Malta, 55 Müller, "Tinnit," 719. 56 Maria E. A. Semmler, "Spain," in Moscati (ed.) The Phoenicians, London 1988,279-304,303. 57 The ruins of Umm el-Amed, located between Acco and Tyre, stretch across a surface area of ca. 18 ha. Though this temple district experienced its flourit in the third century BCE, excavations have turned up evidence of pre-hellenistic settlement, including Cypriot-style statuettes and ceramic cultic items dating to Iron and Persian periods. J. Kamlah discovered two sanctuaries at Umm el-Amed that he characterizes as "intramural temenos types." Umm el-Amed is similar to Es Cuyam in that both sites served local and regional populations. In the case of Umm el-Amed, the center profited from the busy coastal traffic. See Jens Kamlah, "Die Bedeutung der phönizischen Tempel von Umm el-Amed für die Religionsgeschichte der Levante in vorhellenistischer Zeit," in Israeliten und Phönizier. Ihre Beziehungen im Spiegel der Archäologie und der Literatur des Alten Testaments und seiner Umwelt (ed. M. Witte and J. F.

Natural sanctuaries, which were not incorporated immediately into the city culture. 2. Extramural natural sanctuaries, which were incorporated immediately into the city cul ture. 3. Cult sites subordinate to cities in question, in which second-tier deities are worshipped. 4. City temples. Es Cuyam at Ibiza and the Grotta Regina fall in the first category, since they are not situated in relation to a city, rather, they are found in a less accessible area.</page><page sequence="14">192 Mark A.

Srpt, 13 km south of Sidon61 ).62 The inscription dates to the beginning of the sixth century BCE. Tanit, Asherah, and their Symbols Crescent Moon It may be through the Tanit avatar of Asherah that the latter survives.63 The lunar and maritime affinities shared by Asherah and Tanit have been em phasized in recent scholarship.64 Asherah's importance to sailors is demon strated in the dedication of harbors to her, much like the port consecrated to the storm god Ba'al Sapon.65 Both Asherah and Tanit were symbolized by the crescent moon or new moon. The combination of crescent and disk was a sign of Tanit and her consort Ba'al Hamon,66 a combination perpetuating the earlier motif found on the headdress of Qudshu/Asherah on poles and at the stern of galleys as depicted on Phoenician coins.67 The sign of Tanit and the symbol of the new moon appear to be interchangeable hallmarks.68 59 Müller, "Tinnit," 719. 60 Lipiñski, Dieux et déesses, 201-05. 61 Kamiah, "Temples of the Levant," 510, categorizes the Sarepta sanctuary as an Iron Age sub ordinated sanctuary, one of two categories of intramural settlement sanctuaries; see Table 1 (ibid). His three types of-mural sanctuaries are as follows: (1) intramural, which are inside settlements such as cities, villages, and fortresses; (2) extramural settlement sanctuaries, which are adjacent to settlements; (3) extramural sanctuaries, which are situated far from settlements. Intramural sanctuaries subdivide into (a) major and (b) "subordinated smaller sanctuaries" (ibid., 508). 62 The majority of Iron Age anthropomorphic figurines found at Sarepta were in the vicinity of the shrine. Most of these take the form of a seated, pregnant woman. A number of pillar type figurines were also found (R. Schmitt, "Elements of Domestic Cult," in Albertz/Schmitt, Family and Household Religion, 57-219,21 If., and see Table 3.4). 63 The Carthaginians are credited with spreading Tanit/Asherah worship beyond the Levantine homeland into Europe.

Stuckey, The Great Goddesses of the Levant, JSSEA 30 (2003), 127-57, 149. 64 Particularly helpful is Brody, "Each Man Cried',' idem, "Specialized Religions," 3; Tawny Holm, "Phoenician Religion [Further Considerations]," in Encyclopedia of Religion, 2nd edi tion, 7134. 65 Ibid., 29; "Im phönizisch-syrischen Gebiet war der Wettergott Baal Saphon für die maritimen Belange zuständig" (Eckert, "Aphrodite der Seefahrer," 115). 66 Cross, Canaanite Myth, 32.

Dolphins have long been regarded as important omens for sailors, who interpret their presence as harbingers of an impending storm or changing conditions. It is therefore not surprising to see devotees depicting dolphins alongside her sign.70 Tanit and "Personalized" Phoenician Ships Tanit has additional maritime attributes with specific connections to seafar ing worshippers of goddesses. Researchers have found various goddesses' symbols depicted on Phoenician ships, including the sign of Tanit. Brody tells of one such vessel: The "sign of Tanit," a stylized symbol of the deity, is represented on standards both fore and aft'1 on one vessel shown on a Carthaginian sacrificial stela, while numerous other stelae depict the "sign of Tanit" along with ships, parts of ships such as the prow or stem of vessels, and ship equipment like the anchor or rudder. And the prow of a warship is de picted with a winged staff entwined with two snakes (caduceus-topped standard), another symbol associated with Tanit (see Figs. 4-5).72 in the Ancient World in Honour of Paolo Xella; (ed.

Lipiñski (Dieux et déesses, 206) emphasizes that though the sign of Tanit often ac companies the mention of Tanit, "ne constituait done pas, semble-t-il, un Symbole issu de son cult." It is for example attested as Sarepta "independamment du nom de la deesse, et il ne fait plus guere de doute qu'il a une origine Orientale" (ibid.; cf. ibid. 206f.); see also Eric Gubel, "The Iconography of Inscribed Phoenician Glyptic," in Studies in the Iconography of Northwest Semitic Inscribed Seals: Proceedings of a Symposium Held in Fribourg on April 17 20, 1991 in B.

Christian In view of these data, one might then interpret the incense burners shaped as a Punic goddess (found on sunken ships such as the Pisa Hellenistic wreck) as a representation of Tanit, benefactress of safe navigation73 and indeed protector of the ship itself (see Fig. 3). It was not uncommon for a ship to be personalized and considered a living being, often a female, even the sea men's bride.74 At an Iron II shipwreck dubbed the Elissa,75 Punic mariners offered incense in their prayer to Tanit for her guidance from North Africa to Pisa.76 7. Tanit Worship Associated with Caves Es Cuyam Two additional grottos merit attention. The first, the aforementioned Es Cu yam was discovered in 1907 on the Spanish island of Ibiza, the "inevitable port of call for all navigators through the western Mediterranean area."77 Phoenicians from the Gadir area began making inroads into this uninhab ited Island in the seventh century B.C.78 Ibiza is well known for its 50,000 m. necropolis, perhaps the largest Punic necropolis of the West. As at the Grotta Regina, Tanit was venerated at Es Cuyam.79 The cave's structure betrays the existence of water in the area. This probably explains the preference for the site, as the cult of water was the impetus for many Punic sanctuaries.80 It likely served as a shrine for Phoenicians during their occupation of the is land.81 Strategically situated on the northwest coast along Punic navigation routes, Es Cuyam made an ideal place of worship for navigators and sailors.82 heuristically helpful to view some ancient ships as hybrids; see Jeff Emanuel, "Egypt, the 'Sea Peoples,' and the Brailed Sail: Technological Transference in the Early Ramesside Period?," paper presented to the 2012 Annual Meeting of the American Schools of Oriental Research, accessible at http://academia.edu/2069291/Egypt_the_Sea_Peoples_and_the_Brailed_Sail_ Technological_Transference_in_the_Early_Ramesside_Period, accessed 15 July, 2013. 73 Brody, "Each Man Cried," 179. 74 As noted by Eckert, "Aphrodite der Seefahrer," 103 and n. 11; 115. 75 Measuring 14.5 m. long by 7 m. wide, the ship is broader than the typical 1:3 width ratio of most merchant ships (Brody, "Each Man Cried," 177). 76 Upon arrival on the western Italian coast, priest-sailors or non-priests with some cultic training probably lit sweet smelling offerings to Tanit as a thank offering for their safe pas sage. The Elissa would later sink while moored in the Pisa harbor (ibid., 179). 77 Semmler, "Spain," 298. 78 Phoenicians had little in common with the wealth Phoenician society of Malaga and Granada (ibid., 299). 79 Lipiñski, Dieux et déesses, 205f. 80 Semmler, "Spain," 303. 81 Brody, "Further Evidence," 180. 82 Ibid., 180, quoting Semmler.</page><page sequence="17">Phoenician Maritime Religion 195 In the excavations of Grotto Es Cuyam, hundreds of votive offerings have come to light that date from the fourth-second centuries BC, with votive terra-cottas emerging from the great quantity of ash, burnt bones,83 and bronze inscriptions.84 Most of the statuettes are female. Those representing a female bust with large wings folded over the breast provide examples of the winged depiction of Tanit. Seafarers ostensibly offer up "prayers of clay" for healing in behalf of the success of their mission, safe passage of their vessels and themselves, and protection for their families back home. After all, Tanit was viewed inter alia as the symbol of life and protection. Would it not prove advantageous to have navigators and sailors with both military and cultic expertise participating on military voyages? The question receives further consideration below. Additionally, the two dedicatory inscriptions found in Es Cuyam bear on the discussion of Phoenician maritime religion. The first indicates the wor ship of the god of healing and pestilence Reshef-Melqart, the Phoenician Herakles and a patron deity of Phoenician sailors. Here a role as a sacred benefactor of commerce is likely. The second dedicatory inscription is to Tanit. Though the votives lack explicit maritime connections, Es Cuyam's proximity to the Mediterranean suggests worship in the cave had a seafaring component.85 Gorham's Cave Another grotto dedicated to Tanit meets us in Gorham's cave, situated on the eastern face of the Rock of Gibraltar. The grotto served sacral needs of Phoenicians as they made their way to the colony city of Cadiz.86 Synthetic studies of Tanit have not taken sufficient notice of the worship of the goddess in caves. The connection of the mother goddess Tanit with caves near the sea, at the Grotta Regina in Sicily, the cave of Es Cuyam in Ibiza, and Gorham's Cave on Gibraltar is an aspect of the worship of this goddess which has not been emphasized in synthetic studies of the deity, and fits with the general Mediterranean practice of worshipping various gods and goddesses in grottos from prehistoric times all the way down to the present.87 83 Semmler ("Spain," 303) believes devotees practiced animal sacrifice within the enclosure. 84 Ibid. 85 Brody, "Further Evidence," 180f. 86 Semmler, "Spain," 304. Cadiz is located on the southern Atlantic coast of Spain, outside the northern Pillar of Herakles/Hercules, promontories that border the Strait of Gibraltar. 87 Brody, "Further Evidence," 180.</page><page sequence="18">196 Mark A. Christian Brody does not remark on the preference for grottos as place of worship.88 Zamora López et al.89 emphasize the originality and individuality of the wor ship in Gorham's Cave, which is defined by the faithful (los fieles) and by elite priests, who would regulate cave practices and give them their essen tial definition.90 These sanctuaries required no "construction" (so, Germ. Naturheiligtümer). Were they thought created for worship by the gods? Their "internal nature" affords intimate contact with deities. The privacy also pro vides a measure of protection for the free exercise of worship and/or for those participating in activities thought unusual or illicit, which a more public sanctuary regulated by elite priests might restrict. In the coastal zones under discussion there exists a similarity of vocation and a penchant for divine protectoresses. A malleable deity such as Tanit with links to Asherah 'Astarte appeals to the seafarers' desire for a multi faceted deity that combines traditional aspects linked to ancient civilizations (e.g., Egypt) with more recent, "local" aspects associated with regional cities (Tyre, Sidon, Carthage) or even very small stops on Mediterranean travel routes. As one contemplates the importance of Tanit for "sea people" and indi viduals living on or frequenting coastal areas - islands, islets, and promon tories - the Tanit graffito on the walls of the Grotta Regina - in conjunction with drawings of Phoenician warships asserts itself. The "sign of Tanit" ap pears twice on cave walls, along with many other Phoenician inscriptions, including dedications to the male god of healing Shadrapa. The cave's wall art also depicts vessels in holy places, a common practice among seafarers in dicating worshippers' desires to dedicate ships to a deity.91 On this front, the thesis that ships had cultically-competent personnel to lead worship prac 88 Brody does note a Carthage shrine originally built over a natural crevice, which is rem iniscent of a cave. The small sacred structure, located just east of Carthage's merchant harbor, reportedly served as a sailor's shrine (ibid., 180-81). "The gods honored by child sacrifice, as is evident from inscriptions in Phoenician on the hundreds of stelae dedicat ing individual sacrifices, are Ba'al Hammon and Tanit, the chief god and goddess of the Carthaginian pantheon" (ibid., 181). The Iron Age archaeological evidences from the finds at Tell Burak show no trace of child sacrifice, a not uncommon lacuna in Persian period finds. "L'origine de la pratique funéraire représentée par les tophets serait une tradition typ iquement nord-africaine, plus précisément carthaginoise.

The ships on Regina's walls (Figs. 5-6) were not the drawings of profes sionals. They display the work of those associated with the religious mariner life. Some of these "artists" may have been part-time officiants, there to bless and sanction the seafarer life, greeting the docked sailors, ministering to and reciprocally benefitting from them. What the ship drawings lack in beauty they make up for in details, which suggest the artist was an astute crew mem ber of a ship like this - or someone who has considerable familiarity with such vessels.92 The stakes for sailors were high; during times of peril they implored their savior sea-deities fully expecting a response.93 It therefore makes good sense to assume that ship owners and captains made effort to include crew members knowledgeable in things of the sofer-Gottheiten gods in order to maximize the Mayday requests. Finally, these etchings by non-professionals were not emblazoned on an exposed wall or stela for all to see. Much to the contrary, they were created in relative secrecy. Such settings are far removed from contexts in which im perial authority could impose official forms of religion.94 During times of imperial pressure many Phoenicians sought out more secluded shrines. As we have seen, taxation of offerings and donations from these sites by urban elites is unlikely. Further research is needed to pursue the matter of non-elite officiants with regional jurisdiction who travelled with mariners. As sailors passed promontories and foothills they would perform ritual gestures that greeted land deities.95 Ancient Mediterranean mariners spared little effort to complete their voyages successfully. 8.

Kennerly resists the notion that sailors were more somehow less religious than their landed counterparts. "At a personal level, seafarers were likely to be as religious, agnostic, superstitious, or atheistic as nonseafarers were." 95 Cf.

We are told nothing about how the prince came to choose these particular men and nothing about their credentials for supervising the practices of pilgrims fre quenting the site. In later times98 it seems that some writers are more forth coming with these details, for example in reporting on priests serving mass on vessels involved in military operations.99 Religious Expression Onboard The number of ceremonies and rituals ostensibly overseen by someone on board could be extensive. These include rituals of departure, for example, appeasing land gods who could refuse to release the ship for travel; rituals during the trip; and rituals associated with landings and entering harbors.100 The ceremonies are to be understood as "rites of passage" that ensure a suc cessful transition from land to sea - and vice versa - as mariners move from the sphere of one local numen to another.101 A vase from early fifth-century BCE Thebes pictures the ship commander tossing a crown into the depths in conjunction with a euploia-prayer. A female savior-deity of uncertain iden tity appears in order to lead the ship and light the way (Fig. 4). The scenario suggests communication between the ship's captain and the goddess. The commander would not have presumed comprehensive spiritual leadership of the ship, however. A mariner with religious competencies would share 96 Diodorus, Library of History, V.58.2; Brody, "Each Man Cried," 25; idem, "Specialized Reli gions," 2. 97 Herodotus (7.192) tells of Greek sailors looking to Poseidon for protection. "Numerous temples and shrines were dedicated to this deity of the sea and marine winds, on headlands and in ports throughout Greece and its overseas territories" (Brody, "Specialized Religions," 2). Neptune was worshipped by Roman mariners and fishermen; the symbols of this Latin god of both fresh waters and the sea included the tuna, dolphin, and trident fishing spear. 98 In addition to his study of Canaanite and Phoenician maritime religion, Brody ("Special ized Religions," 1) has developed a helpful framework informed by the research on seafar ing and the religions of Greek and Roman cultures and by the anthropological study of the "religion of traditional seafaring communities." 99 The practice of liturgical observations at sea was common in the late medieval and early modern periods. The observance of mass required the presence of a priest. This was more likely on crusading and pilgrim voyages; cf. Kennerly, "Seafarer's Religion," 425. Kennerley does not speculate on the maritime or military expertise of such priests. As has been repeat edly emphasized in this paper, such skills would be both valued and largely unannounced in the literature of ancient expeditions. 100 This is not to suggest ancient engineers did not take pragmatic steps to maintain harbors. The Phoenicans were early (Iron Age) modifiers of the natural shore-scape in order to pro tect their anchorages. Evidence at both Sidon and Batroun suggests they cut rock walls to protect the anchorages. Cf. Ralph K. Pederson, "Emerging Maritime Paradigms for the Bronze Age in Lebanon," Skyllis 12 (2012): 5-10,6. 101 Eckert, "Aphrodite der Seefahrer," 105-07.</page><page sequence="21">Phoenician Maritime Religion 199 responsibility in maintaining the divine connection and advising the com mander in the event of divine leadings.102 Herodotus recounts an incident on a Persian ship from Troezen command ed by a certain Prexinus. Part of Xerxes' advanced guard, even after propi tiating the winds according to a Delphian oracle,10 the ship did not elude barbarian capture. The occupiers selected a victim, drug him to the prow and promptly slit his throat, regarding it "a good omen that the first Greek they had taken prisoner was the handsomest."104 The "offering" lines up with the belief that those who perish on voyages are receiving their just due for sin.105 That the reported execution was performed or overseen by a warrior with cultic expertise seems likely. Once again, nothing is said of this. Though it seems strange to modern readers accustomed to journalistic details, such was not the case in ancient literature. On the one hand, the apparent nor malness of the pronounced religiosity in these contexts would help explain the non-mention of details. On the other hand, ascribing skill to the uncre dentialed may have been problematic. The association of religion with business ventures such as copper smelting and anchor production was ancient, occurring already in Late Bronze Age coastal settlements such as Enkomi, Kition, and Hala Sultan Tekke.106 Crew lists were neither comprehensive nor concerned with secondary skills.107 102 In the tempestuous scene of Jonah 1 the mariners (□מלתי v. 5; התבל v. 6) divine Jonah's guilt, reject his macabre solution (v. 6) only to later carry it out (v. 12). The seamen asking Jonah for problem-solving advice may not be so far-fetched (Jack Sasson, Jonah [AB, 1990], 341), because the context is one that emphasizes the distinction between the gods in order not to leave any unappeased (w. 5f., 9f.). That the captain steps in, exempts Jonah from throwing cargo overboard, and spares him other indignities suffered at the hands of the crew (v. 6) suggests respect for Jonah and his god. The entire chapter attributes a high level of professionalism and religious sensibility - and expertise - to its characters. Ezekiel 27:29b employs the same two words used in Jonah l:5f. to describe sailors. Particularly the latter (תבל) appears to identify experts in seacraft; the book of Proverbs' usages of the root in 1:5; 12:5 reinforce the connotation of experienced knowledge (cf. Heb. הכמה and H.W. Wolff, Obadiah and Jonah: A Commentary, Augsburg Press, 1986, 107, 113 (ET by M. Kohl; Germ, edition Neukirchener, 1977). The similar terminology may hint at the religious training of the seamen. 103 The oracle followed the building of an altar to the winds; see Herodotus: The History (trans. D. Grene; Chicago: University of Chicago, 1987), 7:178-79. 104 Herodotus, 7:180. 105 For group punishment in similar contexts, see Herodotus (7.188; 8.10-13), who character izes storms wreaking havoc on the Persian fleet as the "work of heaven's providence"; cf. Sasson, Jonah, 91f. and 1 Kings 22:49-50/2 Chronicles 20:35-7. In the Chronicles passage Jehoshaphat's alignment with Ahaziah leads to the destruction of the fleet, which "becomes a sinister omen regarding the fate of Judah" (ibid., 92). 106 McCaslin, Stone Anchors, 117-19. 107 Lionel Casson, The Ancient Mariners: Seafarers and Sea Fighters of the Mediteranean in Ancient Times, 2nd edition (Princeton: Princeton University, 1991), 141.</page><page sequence="22">200 Mark A. Christian Phoenicians travelled from place to place peddling their wares in local mar ket centers many of which were linked to places of worship.108 Foreign Mercenaries and "Phoenicianization" As they adapt to alien cultures and contexts, foreign mercenaries may de velop an unusual repertoire of skills. Historians tell of Greek seafarers enter ing the service of Pharaoh Psammetich in the seventh century BCE. Some of these Greeks fought as mercenaries in Palestine for both the Egyptians and Babylonians as mercenaries.109 A Greek garrison was stationed at the Met sad Hashavyahu fortress around the turn of the sixth century, plausibly con nected with the reign of Jehoiachin. We should consider the ways in which these Greeks proved helpful beyond the requisite military abilities and rudi mentary facility in a second language. R. Wenning concludes an extensive survey by refuting the thesis of pre-Hellenism in Persian-period Palestine. He argues instead for a diffuse "Phoenicianizing" into which Greek elements were incorporated.110 Wenning does not comment on the religiosity of these soldiers, and the perspective of the Hebrew Bible says nothing of direct rela tions with Greeks in Palestine during the Persian period.111 Greek witnesses fare much better. 108 In Kition, shops and metal workshops were situated close to a Late Bronze temple. At Ele phantine we find references to a street opposite the Chnum temple. This is significant in that Elephantine was a strategic way station between Egypt and Nubia. In the Ptolemaic era there were shops and stalls selling amulets and other objects to pilgrims visiting the temple. See Maria E. A. Semmler, "A Phoenician Market in Spain," in Ana sadi Labnäni lü allik, B. Pongratz-Leisten, H. Kühne, P. Xella (eds) (AOAT 247; Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener, 1997), 11-22,15. 109 In addition to the state and state-less workers in the Near East, we find from the Late Bronze Aegean evidence of Minoan and Mycenaen mercenaries in the Egyptian army. See, e.g., Eric H. Cline, "Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sailor: Minoans and Mycenaeans Abroad," in POLITEIA. Society and State in the Aegean Bronze Age: Proceedings from the Fifth International Aegean Conference (R. Laffineur and W-D. Niemeier, eds.; Aegaeum 12: Liege/Austin 1995) 1:265 287, 270-73. Cline comments on the skill set of these mercenaries, which he refers to as a class: "There is now possible evidence for a number of other expatriate Minoans and Myce naeans, functioning overseas as mercenaries, interpreters, merchants, sailors, physicians, diplomats, weavers, and other types of craftsmen" (ibid., 267). 110 "..., und möchte stattdessen von einer verbreiteten Phönizierung sprechen, in die auch griechische Elemente also phönizische Lebensart eingebettet sein können," Robert Wen ning, "Griechischer Einfluss auf Palästina in vorhellenistischer Zeit?," in Stefan Alkier and Markus Witte [eds.], Die Griechen und das antike Israel: Interdisziplinäre Studien zur Religions- und Kulturgeschichte des Heiligen Landes [OBO 201; Academic/Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2004], 29-60). 111 "Aus dem Alten Testament erfährt man nichts über direkte Beziehungen zu den Griechen oder über Griechen in Palästina in der Perserzeit" (ibid., 39).</page><page sequence="23">Phoenician Maritime Religion 201 Warrior Priests in the Hebrew Bible As one considers a seafaring priest who also takes up arms during military missions, it may be helpful recalling the theme of bellicose priests in the He brew Bible/Old Testament. In the infamous "Golden Calf" incident of Exodus 32:25-29, the Levite quasi-priests work swift vengeance on their idolatrous "kinfolk," whom Moses' high-priestly brother Aaron reportedly led astray. Both this passage and the related account in Deuteronomy 33:8-10 remain oddities for reasons of rarity (Aaron's defamation is severe and enduring) and sanction of wanton violence (the Levitical priests' bloody remedy for the Aaron-led apostasy). The bellicose actions of the Levitical quasi-priests are recounted as if appropriate actions for priests to take in extraordinary situations. Although our biblical texts do not place Levites in a seafaring context, Is raelites probably did serve on Phoenician ships,112 and there is little that could speak against non-elite religious personnel (i.e., the Levites in most biblical texts) serving in this capacity. The mention of "Dan dwelling in ships" in Judg 5:17 may describe Danites working on ships at Tyre once the tribe had resettled in the north.113 In Israel, the Sharon was one of the few places Israel could participate in Levantine maritime trade. Its gener ally negative view toward the sea (and perhaps lack of familiarity with the Sharon?) may help account for the periodic dips in coastal settlement devel opments.114 Phoenician assistance appears to have been essential in Israel's involvement in that trade,115 and Yahwists from coastal areas of Israel likely played roles in strengthening that relationship. 9. Concluding Remarks In the exploration of Mediterranean cave sanctuaries we have examined ev idences of the worship of the goddess Tanit, a permutation of 'Astarte with connections to Asherah. In many instances we see visual evidence of Tanit 112 Rainer Kessler, The Social History of Ancient Israel: An Introduction (trans. Linda M. Mal oney; Minneapolis: Fortress, 2008), 41. A cylinder seal of Syro-Palestinian origin was found in a Bronze-Age shipwreck (The Cape Gelidonya Wreck) that suggests contacts with Phoenicia. Gould and others think the merchant was Syrian and the ship Phoenician; he characterizes the ship as a well-traveled tramping vessel of the eastern Mediterranean (Archaeology, 155f.) 113 Aaron Brody, "Ships and Sailing in the OT," NIDB 5,239-41,239. 114 E.g., the western areas of the Sharon were "almost devoid of large scale human activity during the Iron Age IIB" (Avraham Faust, UF 43,2011,117-30,120). 115 "Only when other peoples settled the region -the Canaanites (during the Middle Bronze and Late Bronze Ages) and Phoenicians (during the Persian Period) - was the Sharon more densely settled" (ibid., 126). Persian period sites included Tel Qasile, Tel Michal, Makhmis, Appolonia, Tel Mikhmoret, Tel Poleg, Tel Mevorach, inter alia (ibid.,</page><page sequence="24">202 Mark A. Christian in her stylized, etched sign (e.g., Fig. 1), occasionally in conjunction with her consort Ba'al Hamon. The popular etchings of the sign of Tanit along with Phoenician military on the internal walls of the Grotta Regina show ev idence of non-professional persons involved in both goddess worship and war. This has prompted the consideration of other Mediterranean contexts in which mid-level religious officiants likely worked, in part-time capaci ties, providing "religious" direction on board and officiating certain rites at coastal worship sites. Such services supplemented these non-elites' in come. Although ancient texts are not forthcoming about these persons and their religious skills, our close readings of classical and biblical texts have shown that, though unnamed and presumably uncredientaled, they appar ently played important roles during life-threatening events at sea and in coastal sanctuaries. Excursus: Tanit at Carthage Historians credit the Phoenicians for prolonging the veneration of the great goddesses of the Levant, Anat, Astarte, and Asherah and avatars such as Tanit (Figs. 1-2).116 The latter was arguably the principal deity of the Phoe nician colony of Carthage, North Africa,117 and was worshipped from the fifth-fourth century BCE.118 Phoenician settlements in the middle Mediter ranean tended to develop their own pantheon, and this is especially true of for Carthage.119 Inscriptions from the fourth-second centuries BCE mention both a temple of Melqart (CIS 1,4894.5575) and cult personnel of the Melqart temple (CIS I, 264) in Carthage. Another inscription tells of an offering for Tanit and Baal as well as for Melqart (CIS I, 55 1 0).120 Astarte, mentioned at Carthage from eighth-seventh century, is less prominent than Melqart. Few inscriptions from the fourth-second centuries BCE mention her vener ation in a temple (CIS I, 263.255.3779.4842.4843). She is mentioned along with Tanit at the cultic site of Burg Gedid, on the periphery of Carthage (CIS I, 3914, 4th-3rd BCE). In some contexts Tanit was the consort of Ba'al Hammon. Although the majority of inscriptions from Carthage refer to the goddess Tanit and the god Melqart (literally, "king of the city") the venera tion of other deities would continue. Goddesses may be venerated together and share the same cultic personnel (Astarte and Tanit, Astarte and Esh 116 Stuckey, Great Goddesses, 149. 117 Carthage was founded in the 9th century by Tyrian colonists. Numerous ancient literary sources divulge the close relationship between the two cities (cf. Diod. 17:41,8; 20:14). 118 Giuseppe Garbati, "Tradizione, memoria e rinnovamento: Tinnit nel tofet di Cartigine" in Ritual, Religion and Reason" (Loretz et al., eds., 29-42), 529. 119 See Mörstadt, "Phönizische Heiligtümer," 484 et passim. 120 The veneration of Sid-Melqart (CIS I, 256) and Milk-'Astart (CIS I, 250.2785.4839.4850. 5657) are also attested (ibid.).</page><page sequence="25">Phoenician Maritime Religion 203 mun). Newly introduced foreign cults were venerated using their own rites (e.g., Demeter and Kore). The dynamic between new and old, foreign and domestic, urban and rural, helps explain the fluidity of goddess worship and the eclectic worship forms as we have seen at the Grotta Regina.121 This does not suggest the utter absence of (a) specific manifestations of Astarte in a certain form, e.g., Astarte at Eryx, Sicily122 (CIS 1,3776.4910) or (b) mention of a priest of Astarte-Eshmun (CIS I, 245).123 The worship of Tanit spread from North Africa to Sicily thanks to maritime crews and soldiers.124 o /X Figure 1: Graffito Sign ofTanit, after Brody, "Further Evidence," 180, fig 13.5.

"In Carthage the introduc tion of Tanit/Tinnit into the tophets of Carthage seems the result of a process of incorpo ration/division, since a component of Phoenician religion comes to be established in the Punic city - perhaps following the repristinization of communications with the Levant - and read in a way of constituting a foundational element of a diverse cultural dimension. Even if it remains hypothetical, the "minor" role played by Tinnit in the Punic city may have facilitated the revaluation of the goddess, allowing her to represent the new world that distinguishes the Carthaginian oikoumene" (Eng. trans, mine).</page><page sequence="26">204 Mark A.
