Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008 Abstract When prehistoric archaeologists write accounts of the Epi-palaeolithic or Neolithic of southwest Asia, they resort to an archaic narrative style of culture-history that was formulated by Gordon Childe in the first half of the last century. These nar ratives frame their account of events within the format of a succession of archaeological cultures. In addition, the received form of the narrative is founded within a core-area of the Levant, the Mediterranean corridor zone; it is assumed that all the important social and economic innovations of the Epi-palaeolithic and early Neolithic occurred within that corridor, from where the cultures and their innovations spread through diffusionary processes to dominate wider parts of the region. The first part of this paper is a critique of the unwarranted assumption of the existence of archaeological cultures, and of the Levantine primacy hypothesis. The second part proposes an alternative to the notion of the archaeological culture. First, we review the evidence for wide-area cultural net working through the exchange of goods and materials and the sharing of cultural behaviours that characterises the Neolithic. We can view the Epi-palaeolithic and early Neolithic periods as a time when new cultural processes were being employed to build and maintain novel sedentary, permanently co-resident communities of unprecedented scale. At a higher level, we see communities engaged in the construction and mainte nance of more and more extensive networks of communities, in a form similar to, but not identical with, the peer polity interaction sphere model first described by Colin Renfrew in a different context.

Erwin Chargaff, biochemist (1905-2002) This paper arises from a workshop entitled Towards New Frameworks' that took place at the 4th International Congress on the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East in Berlin in April 2004.1 The organizers of the workshop, Hans Georg Gebel, Klaus Schmidt, Mehmet Ozdogan, and Gary Rollefson, wrote in their call for participants in the workshop: 'Many of us [have] become increasingly concerned over the past several years in the realization that the recent unexpected and exciting findings of Near Eastern Neolithic research cannot be interpreted and explained adequately within the explanatory frameworks generated in the past few decades.' The original short paper (Watkins 2003b) is here expanded into a treatment that naturally falls in two parts. The first is a critique of the existing narratives (or meta-narratives) underpinning syntheses of the Epi-palaeolithic or Neolithic periods. The second part proposes an alternative way of structuring the prehistoric information, in which people organize themselves in terms of networks at a multiplicity of levels both within their communities and among those communities. The key phrase in the quotation from the briefing paper for the workshop is 'explanatory frameworks'. First, let us be aware that no framework can be explanatory in itself; thus, we are concerned with frameworks within which we can articulate our interpretations and explanations. Together with the organizers, I feel that we have indeed continued to use inadequate frameworks for constructing our narratives of prehistory, putting the new and heady wine of new discoveries into leaky old wine-skins. Those narratives, reshaped to accommodate new data, are nevertheless condemned to being inappropriate and even misleading. As the quotation at the head of this paper indicates, learning to think of our prehistories in a different way is uncomfortable and difficult. In selecting examples of the style of narrative of which I complain, I hope that I have written economically, rather than been economical with the truth. I shall seek to show that the narratives that prehistorians have written in recent years remain cast in the form of culture histories in which the 'characters' are essentially the archaeological cultures, or cultural groups, as first formulated by Gordon Childe in his landmark prehistories of Europe written more than 70 years ago. This archaic style of culture history narrative has seemed to work well enough because it fits nicely with a particular view of the Levant as the pre eminent core area within which all the significant cultural and economic advances were first achieved, and from which these innovations were then diffused. The conclusion of the first part of this essay will be that the Childean mode of culture-history, with its implicit core periphery, diffusionist assumptions, is long overdue for replacement; the second part of the essay proposes a replacement mode for the early prehistoric periods with which we are concerned. Thus, this paper relates in a tangential way to Tim Taylor's argument that we think carefully about how we should now be writing prehistory (Taylor 2008). Gordon Childe, whose ground-breaking work was first published in the 1920s and 1930s, proposed an analogy between the writing of history and the writing of prehistory. Childe's solution was to think of prehistory as a drama, but to populate the stage not with individual actors or familiar institutions, but with archaeological cultures. The material culture of each cultural group represented not an ethnic, linguistic or racial group, but 1 Not all the pre-circulated contributions to this workshop found final form and no unified publication is envisaged. ?) Springer</page><page sequence="3">J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 141 simply those people who shared that common culture (famously, in the Preface of The Danube in Prehistory, Childe 1929: 'We find certain types of remains?pots, implements, ornaments, burial rites and house forms?constantly recurring together. Such a complex of associated traits we shall call a "cultural group" or just a "culture". We assume that such a complex is the material expression of what today we would call "a people"'). Using the model of an archaeological culture, Childe wrote powerful historical narratives throughout his career, covering both Europe and southwest Asia (Childe 1925, 1928, 1929, 1936, 1942), and continued until his death to produce revised editions of his most influential books. But archaeological theory has surely come a long way since Childe's death 50 years ago; the theoretical flaws and the practical failures of Childe's culture-history mode have been thoroughly documented (e.g. Renfrew 1974; Sherman 1978; Hodder 1982). However, prehistoric archaeologists working in southwest Asia have not developed a replacement mode for the making of prehistoric narratives. Part 1: Culture-History is Alive and Well in the Epi-Palaeolithic and Neolithic of Southwest Asia Narratives of Prehistory For our purposes it will be useful to think in terms of narratives (how we write our accounts of events and processes) and the meta-narratives that underpin the kind of narrative that we choose. Mark Pluciennik chided prehistoric archaeologists with being very slow to consider how they write prehistory, how they construct their narratives (Pluciennik 1999). He took history as the comparator discipline, drawing on the work of White (1973, 1987), and Ricoeur (1984) among many other historians and thinkers, to show how there had been much thought and discussion given to historical 'narratives'. Pluciennik (1999, pp. 655 656) defined the essential components of history, or a story?characters, events and nar rative. Since the archaeological material that we dig up can be reconstructed in stratigraphic sequences, we can speak of many sorts of 'events' (how buildings were constructed, modified, replaced; how the size of the settlement changed; or the burial customs; or the subsistence strategy; or the changing physical environment within which people operated). But 'narrative' requires more than the sequencing of events in time. In the terms of the historian, there is a difference between mere annalistic accounts or chronicles and an historical narrative. Pluciennik (1999, p. 655) quotes White (1987, p. 16) who wrote that narrative provides 'that summing up of the "meaning" of the chain of events.' A narrative is a 'fully realized story ... [that] endows events ... with a significance they do not possess as a mere sequence' (White 1987, p. 14). Narrative requires what Ricoeur (1984, pp. 31-51) terms 'emplotment', that is, the framework that gives the sequence of events coherence, and the whole account its logic, rationale or plausibility. That plausibility often depends on an implicit meta-narrative; we are generally aware that a historian writes from a socialist or neo-Marxist or a Whiggish perspective, and there are equally distinct perspectives, or meta narratives, that guide the prehistorian's narrative. What kinds of 'emplotment' underpin the narratives of prehistorians? Once, in the middle of the last century, they were para-historical, or cultural-historical. The processu alists of the 1960s and 1970s sought to dump culture-history, and shift archaeology into a scientific mode, concerned with process. But, after 30 or 40 years, there is little to show in the way of scientific-style accounts of mainstream human prehistory once the 'human revolution' of the Upper Palaeolithic, or emergence of modem Homo sapiens has brought Springer</page><page sequence="4">142 J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 the story of hominid evolution to is climax. Since the middle of the 1980s, 'post-processuaT narratives have been constructed that have much more in common with post-modern lit erature and social theory, and many archaeologists are equally unhappy with this complicated, polyvalent and multi-vocal world. At this stage, however, we shall concern ourselves first with 'characters'. The 'characters' in a 'narrative' are actually the most important component, pace Pluciennik. If we find that a young girl called Little Red Riding Hood, a bed-ridden grandmother, an anthropomorphized wolf and a woodsman with an axe are the main characters in a narrative, we know that the story will be very different from a narrative in which the leading characters are heads of state in totalitarian and democratic regimes, ambassadors, weapons inspectors and the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Identifying 'cultures' as 'characters', Pluciennik (1999, p. 660) remarks that the char acters in narratives of our European prehistoric colleagues are 'usually collective and may be communities, societies, traditions, cultures, styles, activities, technologies, sites, landscapes, or even regions', but he is happy to leave it at that, since he is more concerned with narrative and meta-narrative. Specialists in the prehistory of southwest Asia are, it seems to me, less imaginative. Specialists in the Epi-palaeolithic period usually refer to chipped stone tradi tions, often with little consideration given to what a shared chipped stone industrial tradition might mean in social and cultural terms, how small groups spread thinly over a landscape maintain such common traditions, or indeed why. Hereafter, I concentrate on the early Neolithic period (which was the focus of the original Berlin workshop), but the accounts of the Epi-palaeolithic in the Levant could be criticized in similar terms. Indeed, several archaeologists have recently criticized the muddled assumptions of their Epi-palaeolithic colleagues about the ethnic or social entities that made and used the material culture that they analyse and classify (for example, Maher in press, 2007; Olszewski 2006; Pirie 2004). When it comes to the Natufian in the late Epi-palaeolithic of the Mediterranean corridor (the oak?Pistacia open woodland zone, stretching from the southern part of the rift valley around Basta, northwards past the Dead Sea, through Israel and the Jordan valley, and reaching through Syria as far as Abu Hureyra on the Euphrates?see map, Fig. 1), we perhaps veer towards a traditional archaeological culture. In the Neolithic, we find implicit reference to the communities that are represented by the settlement sites that we excavate, and we continue to find references to technological traditions of chipped stone manufacture, as well as styles of projectile point. But in constructing narratives that synthesise, integrate and make comprehensible the archaeological data across individual sites, and at a higher level than shared chipped stone traditions, we have continued to use models derived from the notion of the 'cultural group' defined 80 years ago by Childe (1929). As long ago as 1974, Colin Renfrew took apart the simplistic logic of the traditional 'archaeological cul ture' and showed it to be seriously defective (Renfrew 1974). Stephen Shennan followed that with an empirical study of the locational aspects of material culture that conclusively dismantled the idea of coherent archaeological cultures (Shennan 1978). Ian Hodder's ethnoarchaeological fieldwork in Kenya (Hodder 1982) documented extensively the fallacy of thinking that it was possible to map the notion of the archaeological culture-group onto the material culture of people living in the real world. Childe's idea that there were blocks of time and definable areas on the map within which everyone shared common cultural beliefs, knowledge and practice worked neither in our own experience of the modern western world, nor in the simple, small-scale societies explored by ethnographers and ethno-archaeologists. Nevertheless, the Childe-derived 'PPNA' and 'PPNB' cultures, based on the type-site of Tell es-Sultan?ancient Jericho (see map, Fig. 1)?remain the mainstay of recent syn theses of the Neolithic of southwest Asia. Their original formation as archaeological constructs was unexceptional. The site of Tell es-Sultan was excavated in the 1950s by Springer</page><page sequence="5">J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 143 Fig. 1 Map of southwest Asia, showing sites mentioned in the text and significant obsidian sources Kathleen Kenyon, whose ideas on prehistoric archaeology were greatly influenced by Gordon Childe's established pre-eminence among British prehistoric archaeologists. She held a position at the Institute of Archaeology in London, where since the late 1940s Gordon Childe had been the Director and Professor of European Prehistory. The terms 'PPN-A' and 'PPN-B' were originally used for the successive Pre-Pottery Neolithic phases at that site (Kenyon 1957, as well as the preliminary reports through the Palestine Exploration Quarterly in the 1950s). But, in Kenyon's Archaeology in the Holy Land they were soon extended from the type-site to the southern Levantine region as labels for successive cultures (Kenyon 1960). Over the next two decades, Kenyon revised and updated the book's factual content three times, and it remained the most widely used synthesis; but the underlying culture-historical meta-narrative remained unaffected. Roland de Vaux wrote the relevant chapter of the new edition of the Cambridge Ancient History, Vol. I, Part 1 (de Vaux 1970) in similar vein, relying heavily on Kenyon's work. James Mellaart wrote a brief synthesis of the Epi-palaeolithic and Neolithic of southwest Asia for a glossy, illustrated book on prehistory (Piggott 1961), from which a slim paperback was derived (Mellaart 1965). When Mellaart came to write a book-length synthesis 10 years later (Mellaart 1975), his ideas were pre-formed, and only needed fleshing out with a good deal more of the detail of which he was the master. The 'narratives' of Mellaart's accounts were completely in the Childean cultural-historical mode. By a remarkable coincidence, Purushottam Singh published another synthesis within a few months of Mellaart's major work (Singh 1974). Singh's account was even more simply descriptive of the succession of cultural assemblages than Mellaart's. There is little sign of the white heat of the proces sualist revolution among the senior figures writing in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In North America, Robert Braidwood was the senior figure in the prehistoric archae ology of southwest Asia, and we could examine a number of publications to see what kind to Springer</page><page sequence="6">144 J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 of narrative of prehistory he preferred. However, we may most easily refer to the slim, popular, world prehistory in outline, Prehistoric Men, which he repeatedly revised and updated between its original publication in 1948 and its latest version in 1975. After the Second World War, Braidwood's research was focused on the origins of farming, first in northeast Iraq, then in western Iran, and finally at ?aydnu Tepesi in southeast Turkey. The successive editions of Prehistoric Men, therefore, were able to reflect the results of his own fieldwork. In the opening section of the 6th edition (Braidwood 1967), explaining how we can learn about people in prehistoric times, Braidwood says that we deal in 'assemblages' of artefacts found in the various strata of archaeological sites. In the section dealing with the origins of farming, Braidwood introduces the 'assemblage called the Natufian', as well as the 'Karim Shahirian' assemblage in the Zagros (Braidwood 1967, p. 102), but these are clearly not assemblages found at a particular site. In all but name, they are Childean archaeological cultures. The conclusion that Braidwood was avoiding using the term 'culture' is reinforced when we find him referring in the same paragraph to 'Natufian burials'. Burials are not artefacts that might be one of the components making up an assemblage; and burials are indeed the final item on Childe's list of the traits that go to make up an archaeological culture. Charles Redman studied at the University of Chicago, where Braidwood taught, and wrote as one of the most thoughtful and original of the processualists. He wrote a synthesis of the pre- and proto-historic archaeology of southwest Asia of a quite different cast from Braidwood's (Redman 1978). In Chap. 5, on the 'First Village Farmers' (a title that could have been written by Braidwood), Redman articulates his account in terms of sub-sections that discuss the important 'village' sites. In the following chapter, on the 'Development of the Village Economy', we are introduced to Hassunan 'communities', the emerging town of ?atalhdyuk and other Anatolian sites, and then to the 'Halafian assemblage' (Redman 1978, p. 200). We may conclude that (a) American prehistoric archaeologists working in southwest Asia substituted 'assemblage' for Childe's term 'culture'; and (b) the proces sualist revolution wrought little change beneath the surface. It is impossible to survey the work of everyone who has written on the Neolithic of southwest Asia; a consideration of two of the doyens, Jacques Cauvin and Ofer Bar-Yosef, whose teaching and written work influences all of today's practitioners, will be enough. Jacques Cauvin's final book was doubly welcome, both as the first synthesis after so much exciting excavation and research through the 1980s, and as the author's mature statement of his developed views (Cauvin 1994 was the original in French, published in a revised edition in 1997, but here the English language edition of 2000 will be used). However provocative and original the subject matter of the book is in many respects, Cauvin's 'characters' are cultures, and his 'narrative' is a sophisticated version of traditional culture history in the mould of Gordon Childe (of whom Cauvin was a great admirer). In Cauvin's book, for example, the first sentence in the chapter on 'The first pre-agricultural villages' states that 'Between 12,500 and 10,000 BC, the Natufian culture extended over almost the whole of the Levant, from the Euphrates to Sinai' (Cauvin 2000, p. 15)?a culture that could be defined by a cluster of cultural traits, and represented on a diagram or on a map as a block of time, in a block of space. And so it continues. In Chap. 4, 'The cultural lineage from the Natufian to Khiamian next engenders three distinct cultural groups'?the Mureybetian in the north Levant, the Aswadian in the centre, and the Sultanian in the southern Levant (Cauvin 2000, p. 34). The PPNB is the climax for Cauvin's account of the early Neolithic. In Chap. 8, it is introduced as 'a culture that is strongly characterised by traits that remain constant and widely spread over the whole of the Levant and south-east Anatolia'. In the PPNB, 'we Springer</page><page sequence="7">J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 145 find a real cultural unity', an 'acerarnic culture that lasts a long time' (Cauvin 2000, pp. 75-76). In the following chapters, Cauvin sets out to document the dramatic, expansive and imperialistic expansion of the PPNB by different means into different regions; in some areas, the superior PPNB culture reached out and swamped indigenous cultural traditions, while population expansion in the core area fuelled colonization by emigrant PPNB groups in other directions. In terms of its 'characters', 'events' and its 'narrative', Cauvin's account is standard, Childean culture history. Cauvin seeks to turn our attention away from the beginnings of plant cultivation and animal herding towards other, 'psycho-cultural' phenomena, but the mode of his account is based in Childe's culture-historical tradition. According to their title, Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen (1989) prefer the model of an 'interaction sphere' to account for the complexities of the PPNB phenomenon, but for other periods Bar-Yosef retains the standard culture-history model. The PPNB presents diffi culties for everyone, and Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen seek a novel solution, but then usage of the term 'interaction sphere' is not that of its original author (Caldwell 1958), as it was later developed (Struever and Houart 1972). Because the idea of interaction spheres will return in the second part, it is important to make clear how Bar-Yosef and Belfer Cohen explain their idea. The interaction to which the authors refer consists in patterns of social and economic exchange that become clearer as we progress from the final Epi palaeolithic Natufian, through the PPNA, into the PPNB. They argue that logistically organized long-distance hunting parties became progressively more necessary, as the farming of cereals and pulses increased the tendency to sedentism. And they then suppose that hunting parties, whether from mobile hunter-gatherer groups, or from farming villages, exchanged projectile points among other things when they chanced to meet. From these exchanges between hunting groups meeting by chance, there then grew more substantial and regular economic exchange relations (Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen 1989, p. 64). Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen note a growing dichotomy between settlements in the Mediterranean core zone, with their reliance on cultivation of crops, and, increasingly in the PPNB, the herding of sheep and goats. And they argue for the institutionalization of exchange of meat hunted by hunter-gatherer groups inhabiting the semi-arid zone for cereals and pulses farmed by the settled people in the core zone. Bar-Yosef and Belfer Cohen do not refer to the key texts on interaction spheres (Struever and Houart 1972), except by allusion in their title, and they do not employ the Hopewell interaction sphere as a model for their essay. And it remains unclear whether the PPNB interaction sphere replaces the PPNB culture, or is simply an articulation of relations within the culture group. Among his many essays of synthesis on periods ranging from the Lower Palaeolithic through to the Neolithic, Ofer Bar-Yosef collaborated with Richard Meadow in writing an account of 'The origins of agriculture in the Near East' (Bar-Yosef and Meadow 1995) for a multi-author book on the shift from hunting and gathering to farming worldwide (Price and Gebauer 1995). There, although he refers to the Natufian as a culture, describing a list of defining culture-traits (Bar-Yosef and Meadow 1995, p. 55), Bar-Yosef again describes the Levantine PPNB as an interaction sphere (Bar-Yosef and Meadow 1995, p. 81). Indeed, he also refers to the PPNA as an interaction sphere (Bar-Yosef and Meadow 1995, p. 63). But there must be a caveat, for his idea of interaction consists of the same social and economic exchanges among farming and hunting and gathering communities that we have already seen in Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen 1989. Further interaction is added, as Bar Yosef asserts that the large PPNB settlements (such as Abu Hureyra, 'Ain Ghazal and Basta) were the central places 'within local and regional networks of information, political competition, and exchange' (Bar-Yosef and Meadow 1995, p. 75). Apart from the Springer</page><page sequence="8">146 J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 universality of lithic reduction traditions and types of projectile point, Bar-Yosef cannot account for the shared cultural practices and symbolism of the PPNB. For the extension of the PPNB into southeast Turkey, Bar-Yosef adopts a similar explanation to that favoured by Cauvin (2000), namely demic diffusion (Bar-Yosef and Meadow 1995, p. 81). In a more recent synthetic chapter, Bar-Yosef shows that he retains the general culture history model at least from the Natufian, but with the idiosyncratic interaction sphere variation for the PPNB (Bar-Yosef 2002). Indeed, he maps the Natufian culture and the PPNA (Bar-Yosef 2002, Figs. 10.1, 10.2?the latter equals Fig. 3 in Asouti 20062). The PPNA appears co-terminous with the Levantine corridor, except that it has an uncom fortable gap where its middle ought to be; Bar-Yosef speaks of a single culture, but represents it as a pair of identical twins. In this most recent synthetic essay, Bar-Yosef illustrates the PPNB interaction sphere construct (Fig. 10.3 in Bar-Yosef 2002, equals Fig. 6 in Asouti 2006), and tells us a little more of how he understands its functioning (Bar Yosef 2002, pp. 120-121; unfortunately, bearing in mind that the context of his paper was a conference on the language dispersal hypothesis, he lacks the space and opportunity to discuss these matters adequately, and we should be sympathetic in our criticisms of his ideas). Fundamental to Bar-Yosef s PPNB interaction sphere are the east-west exchanges of subsistence economy materials (cereals and pulses in one direction, and hunted gazelle meat, hides and horns in the other) between 'herder-hunters' in the Mediterranean woodland zone and 'herder-hunters' in the drier territories further east. However, he remarks (and maps), but does not discuss, regional variations of material culture and cultural practice among the 'herder-hunters' that underlie a more general sharing of 'beliefs and an overall cosmology' (Bar-Yosef 2002, p. 121). For my part, I suspect that Bar-Yosef could have said much more to flesh out his idea of the formation of what amounts to nested interaction spheres. The idea of a PPNB interaction sphere surfaced again in the attempt to integrate new information about early sites in Cyprus (Peltenburg 2004a, b, with references to earlier publications). Leaving aside the unwarranted assumption of first colonisation, and the doubtful linkage of the material culture assemblages of the later 9th millennium BC Cypriot sites with contemporary assemblages either in the north or the south Levant (as discussed, for example, by Coqueugniot 2003; Stordeur 2003a), Peltenburg has left the nature and operation of the interaction sphere implicit. Peltenburg made the case for Cyprus as a 'regional component of the Levantine PPN' (but this time without mention of the interaction sphere concept) (Peltenburg 2004a). Kuijt (2004), one of the respondents, argued that we need to revisit the concept of the interaction sphere and re-think the loosely used term 'PPNB interaction sphere' (as the second part of this essay will do). In a recent paper in this journal Eleni Asouti has discussed critically Belfer-Cohen and Bar-Yosef s application of the construct to the PPNB phenomenon in the Levant (Asouti 2006). However, her own interest remains focused primarily on the Mediterranean corridor, the PPNB phenomenon, and the spread of agriculture. She concludes that the picture that is emerging shows more local and regional diversity than is comfortable for a simplistic Bar Yosef type of interaction sphere model. Outside the Levantine corridor (and its southeast Anatolian annexe), cultural groups have not been blocked out convincingly on the chronological diagrams. The investigated sites are generally so sparse that it is impossible to begin to define on the map clusters that might constitute a classic cultural group. In recent years two prehistoric archaeologists, 2 Eleni Asouti's recent paper in this journal (Asouti 2006) discusses Bar-Yosef s interaction sphere con struct, with redrawn versions of his maps, rendering it superfluous to reproduce those maps in this paper. Springer</page><page sequence="9">J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 147 Olivier Aurenche and Stefan Kozlowski, have boldly attempted such an exercise in taking a broad perspective across southwest Asia (Aurenche and Kozlowski 1999, and see Asouti 2006 for more detailed discussion and illustrative maps). Like Cauvin (2000), Aurenche and Kozlowski do not need terms like 'Natufian', 'PPNA' and 'PPNB' as chronological labels, because they use the Maison de V Orient chronological scheme of numbered periods (Aurenche et al. 1981). When in Chap. 4 Aurenche and Kozlowski reach the later aceramic Neolithic period (which others generally call the PPNB period), they feel it necessary to undertake a careful discussion of the nomenclature (Aurenche and Kozlowski 1999, pp. 58-59). Having pointed out some of the ambiguities and problems of a so-called PPNB culture, they conclude that the term is best reserved for 'la culture locale du Levant sud, dans la mesure ou elle suit revolution constatee a Jericho'. For the rest, they prefer to discuss the distributions of particular clusters of cultural traits under terms that are more neutral and less loaded, such as Kozlowski's 'Big Arrowhead Industry' (BAI, or 'culture a grandes Heches'), which brings together a feature that is very widespread, or the 'culture a grandes maisons rectangulaires', which concerns only sites in southeast Turkey, or the 'cultures agricoles anciennes', which are never clearly specified in their geographic extent, but certainly transcend the greatest claimed PPNB spread. Having declared their aversion to the archaeological culture concept, particularly in its PPNB form, Aurenche and Kozlowski map the period, and earlier periods within their field of interest, in terms of chipped stone industries, whether by means of technology or the widely shared typological traits of projectile points. In conceptual terms, it is the rejection of the archaeological culture in favour of an equally dated concept, that of the chipped stone industrial tradition. In summary, we find that writers of syntheses either continue to use the inappropriate Childean culture-history narrative, or experiment with their own versions of the interaction sphere as a substitute for the term 'culture', or misuse the term 'assemblage' in order to avoid the word 'culture', or revert to chipped stone technology as the defining charac teristic for mapping distributions. None of these is satisfactory, but they have served because most syntheses have focused on a supposed core area in the Levant. It is to the assumption of Levantine primacy (see Watson 1995 for an explicit discussion of the term) that we should now turn. The Levantine Primacy Illusion The Levantine primacy school maintains that the earliest complex hunter-gatherer societies were to be found in the Mediterranean, or Levantine, corridor, so that it is within that corridor that the earliest cultivators and, later, mixed farmers are also to be sought. This perspective on southwest Asia has become the unquestioned orthodoxy, and is at the basis of recent syntheses, written by the acknowledged masters, such as those discussed briefly above. It is convenient, because it limits the significant area of southwest Asia to one that can be argued to be a single cultural unit within a zone of some (fairly limited) envi ronmental coherence. Thus, innovations adopted within the Mediterranean corridor are the property of a single cultural group, usually termed successively Natufian, PPNA and PPNB, and the spread of farming becomes the spread of the PPNB culture or its influence on other, marginal and poorly defined, and usually unnamed, cultural groups in other parts of the region. The hypothesis of Levantine primacy is based on the notion that environmental con straints at the Last Glacial Maximum and afterwards made all but the Mediterranean woodland corridor, with its grasses, cereals and legumes, unsuitable for the emergence of Springer</page><page sequence="10">148 J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 sedentary hunting and gathering. As this is supposed to be the unique zone within which harvesting of wild cereals and legumes began, it thereafter saw the development of farming and the emergence of domesticated forms of those plants. I assert (a) that the environ mental evidence for this hypothesis is less than clear cut; (b) that the archaeological evidence contradicts the orthodox interpretation of the environmental account; and (c) that the hypothesis of Levantine primacy is in fact an untested, but testable, assertion. Faced with too few, too widely spaced sources of environmental data, with too few radiocarbon dates, environmentalists have responded cautiously and have made conserva tive reconstructions of the recovery from the Last Glacial Maximum. In contrast, however, their modelling of the impact of the Younger Dryas phenomenon has been melodramatic. The general view (there is not space here to discuss the matter in detail) is that there were two 'bottle-necks', the first in the Last Glacial Maximum, and the second caused by the Younger Dryas reversal. These relatively cold, dry phases severely restricted the habitat of oak-Pistacia woodland, together with the associated suite of grasses, cereals and legumes, to a Mediterranean corridor, where the impact of the colder conditions was moderated by proximity to the Mediterranean. After both cold, dry phases, a warmer, moister climate returned, and vegetation began to re-colonise territories beyond the Mediterranean refu gium. In optimum conditions, the natural vegetation of what Braidwood called 'the hilly flanks of the Fertile Crescent', plus a broad sweep of territory across southern Anatolia north of the Taurus Mountains, would be open woodland with a wide range of grasses, cereals and legumes. Gordon Hillman (Hillman 1996; Moore and Hillman 1992; Moore et al. 2000; Hillman et al. 2001) has revised the ultra-conservative dating and mapping of the recovery from the LGM as proposed by van Zeist and Bottema (1982, 1991). Hillman's revised model seems to have been generally accepted, but on the impact of the Younger Dryas in particular, Hillman is influenced strongly by the critical position of Abu Hureyra in the steppe region, and his reconstruction remains melodramatic. Crudely sum marised, the narrative runs that sedentary hunter-gatherers reliant on wild harvests of cereals and legumes had emerged in the early Natufian, and were then profoundly affected by the reduction in resources that was occasioned by the Younger Dryas reversal. As a result, they began to turn to the cultivation of some of those plant species, which led to domestication, and also to the herding of domesticated animals. When the journal Paleorient devoted an issue to the subject of 'Paleoenvironnement et societes humaines au Moyen-Orient de 20,000 BP a 6,000 BP' (Paleorient 1997, 23(2)), many of the invited contributors, with their special knowledge of different parts of southwest Asia, found that the Younger Dryas had left an ambiguous signal in their areas. The overall view, synthesised by Paul Sanlaville, was that the Younger Dryas had had quite different levels of impact in different parts of southwest Asia. The argument for the primacy of the Levantine corridor in the adoption of agriculture depends on the belief that sedentary or semi-sedentary hunter-gatherers, dependent on stored harvests of wild cereals, grasses and legumes, existed in the Epi-palaeolithic period only within that zone. Although we have very few investigated sites of Epi-palaeolithic date outside the Levant, there are clues that hunter-gatherer communities elsewhere also harvested and stored cereal and legume harvests. At the end of the Epi-palaeolithic period, there was an occupation of Shanidar cave, in the far northeast of Iraq, and a small, open village site nearby at Zawi Chemi (Solecki 1963, 1981; Solecki and Solecki 1983). Both sites produced sig nificant numbers of ground stone implements for pounding and grinding foodstuffs, and Zawi Chemi contained some circular stone structures, built within an accumulation of occupation debris that amounted to a couple of metres or more. At the beginning of the early Neolithic, there are several sedentary hunter-gatherer sites outside the Levantine corridor, three of which (Qermez Dere, Nemrik and MTefaat) are in north Iraq. These three communities ?) Springer</page><page sequence="11">J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 149 existed at or beyond the very limit of the distribution of the necessary plant resources according to Hillman's map for the period, and yet there is good archaeo-botanical evidence from MTefaat (Savard et al. 2003) and from Qermez Dere (Nesbitt, in Watkins et al. 1991, 1995) that pulses, wild grasses and some wild barley were in use, and that an open Pistacia woodland environment remained despite the Younger Dryas reversal. In southeast Turkey, east of Diyarbakir, the sedentary village site of Hallan ?emi was likewise established at the Epi-palaeolithic-Neolithic boundary. There, too, there is evi dence of the use of pulses and some wild grasses (Savard 2006; Rosenberg et al. 1995, 1998). Given their different cultural assemblages, there is no case to be made that any of these communities?spread from extreme southeast Turkey, across the plains of north Iraq and through the piedmont and into the intermontane valleys of the Zagros mountains? were recent colonists of these regions who had come from the Levantine corridor. At present we lack information on the situation in the Epi-palaeolithic period, but, at the end of the Younger Dryas phase, the archaeological evidence indicates that there were sed entary or semi-sedentary hunter-harvesters relying on stored supplies of legumes and cereals well outside the narrow confines of the Mediterranean corridor of the Levant. In any case, there is a serious methodological problem with the orthodox 'Levantine primacy' account of the emergence and development of Neolithic societies in southwest Asia, for it is a hypothesis that has been elevated to the status of orthodox account without testing. Further work in the Mediterranean woodland zone and its margins (in Jordan, the Palestinian territories, Israel, the Lebanon, western Syria and around the Euphrates in southeast Turkey) by supporters of the view does not test the hypothesis. If we wish to define the area in southwest Asia within which sedentary and semi-sedentary hunter gatherers operated in the Epi-palaeolithic and earliest Neolithic periods, we need to be able to demonstrate its extent by showing which areas were not part of the core area. Following the widely accepted ideas of the philosopher of science Karl Popper, in order to demon strate a hypothesis, we need to apply a test that is capable of falsifying the hypothesis (Popper 1960). How could we falsify the hypothesis? We need to find sites of the appropriate date outside the assumed core area of the Levantine corridor; if those sites are like those within the core area, then the hypothesis is shown to be false, and the geography of the core area needs revision. If we find sites of the appropriate date that were formed by non-sedentary, non-storing hunter-gatherers, then we know that we are outside the core area, and we are beginning to define the extent of that core area. In Anatolia there are the early signs of early aceramic Neolithic settlement, and even Epi-palaeolithic occupation, on and adjacent to the Konya plain (Watkins 1996; Baird 2002, 2005, 2007). For eastern Anatolia, north of the Taurus Mountains, Mehmet Ozdogan has recently reviewed the evidence, some from his own surveys, for aceramic Neolithic or earlier settlement (Ozdogan 2004). It appears that, when archaeologists knowledgeable of the period go and look, sites exist. Potentially, falsification testing could take place, but the situation will not be remedied in the short or medium term. Therefore, we should simply abandon the Levantine primacy model, and look at the general archaeological map of southwest Asia as best we can, relying most on the better-documented parts of the region, but not ignoring the less well-investigated parts. The Culture-Historical Impasse The first part of this essay has set out to show that most authors of synthetic accounts of the Epi-palaeolithic and Neolithic periods in southwest Asia have continued to use the Springer</page><page sequence="12">150 J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 framework of a culture-history narrative, which 30 years ago was shown to be conceptually neat but deeply flawed. As soon as we have bodies of archaeological data from a number of different sites, there are insoluble difficulties in fitting the data to the cultural-group model. We need to face the facts and admit that the notion of the archaeological culture is a very poor approximation of the cultural life of communities in prehistoric (or any other) times. Those who have pioneered the idea of the interaction sphere have at least sought to find some other kind of 'character' to populate their narratives; as Ian Kuijt has remarked, however, the users of the term need to tell us a good deal more about how they see the interaction sphere phenomenon as operating, especially as the use of the term in relation to the PPNB phenomenon is quite different from its use by its American originators. In the remainder of Part 1, the focus was shifted to a related matter, the assumption of a fun damentally diffusionist model, which has given us the core-periphery model of the Epi palaeolithic and Neolithic periods, defined by Patty Jo Watson as the Levantine primacy school. I sought to argue that the idea that a Mediterranean corridor was the area of southwest Asia within which new kinds of subsistence and settlement strategy were evolved, where later the earliest cultivation and domestication of plants took place, is poorly founded in the archaeological and environmental facts. I concluded that, as a hypothesis, it needs to be tested with what Karl Popper would call falsification tests, which means that we need investigations on sites that the hypothesis says are outside the core region: the Levantine primacy hypothesis cannot be tested by yet more investigations of archaeological sites or sources of environmental data from within that region. The continued use of a core-periphery model with cultural groups serving as the 'characters' in the narrative causes difficulties for archaeologists working within the pre sumed core region, and even greater difficulties for those working elsewhere. The interminable questions and arguments concerning the application of the PPNB cultural chronological framework to particular sites and regions are witness to that. Similar arguments occur over the application of the term Natufian (or early, middle, late or final Natufian) in relation to particular assemblages. But the difficulties are even greater for those who look beyond the Mediterranean corridor, where the cultural paradigms of the Natufian, PPNA and PPNB simply have no relevance, but are nevertheless applied. Fifty years ago, the solution to this problem might have been to recommend a lot more field investigation in regions of southwest Asia other than the Mediterranean corridor, in the hope of accumulating enough data from enough sites so that other cultural groups would gradually emerge. It is interesting to note that there have been very few attempts to define cultural groups of the kind that have long been standard in the Mediterranean corridor, even though clusters of sites have begun to build up, for example, across southeast Turkey and north Iraq, and in central Anatolia. Perhaps archaeologists have been reluctant to promote the names of sites to the status of type-site for new cultural groups. Whatever the reason, archaeologists working in the European Neolithic and others who have needed to look to southwest Asia have generally assumed that the Mediterranean corridor cultural sequence is good for the whole of southwest Asia. When it comes to looking at the dissemination of domesticated species and farming practices across Europe, for example, or the question of the expansion of the Neolithic as the front of a wave of advance of farming colonists (maybe speaking Proto-Indo-European), the point of origin is taken to be the Mediterranean corridor (e.g. Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza 1973, 1984; Colledge et al. 2004; Pinhasi et al. 2005). Whatever the case for hypothesising the spread of farming across Europe, such simplistic models are constructed in happy ignorance of the problems that the hypothesis poses within southwest Asia, where the core-periphery model is out dated and insupportable on present evidence. Springer</page><page sequence="13">J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 151 Part 2: Towards a Theory of Networked Communities in the Neolithic of Southwest Asia I have set out a critique of the culture-history model that was originated by Gordon Childe early in the twentieth century, but which remains the standard basis of syntheses of the period. Further, the standard culture-history model is compounded within a core-periphery narrative that assumes the primacy of the Mediterranean corridor. In this second part, I start with a brief overview of some of the evidence for extensive networks of exchange. I propose that, instead of cultural groups, we should think of these networks of exchange as multi-level, nested networks, similar to peer polity interaction spheres. This is a version of a model first proposed by Renfrew (1986), itself a more fully worked version of an original idea from North American prehistoric archaeology, the Hopewell interaction sphere (see below). In the final section of this essay, I broaden the discussion to consider the wider implications of the formation of the first, complex interaction spheres, concluding that interaction spheres should be the general model for the 'characters' in our prehistoric 'narratives' (using the metaphor from Pluciennik 1999). Communities Linked in Wide-Area Networks If we discard the old cultural groups (and with them the old difrusionist, core-periphery model that is assumed in the Levantine primacy hypothesis), we can start again from the level of the settlements that archaeologists have been sampling with their excavations. There has been interesting work in recent years on the social organization of sedentary Neolithic communities and the households of which they were composed (for example, Byrd 1994; Banning and Byrd 1987; Kuijt 2000a, b; Verhoeven 2002a, b). It has been clear for some time that in order to function coherently the larger Neolithic settlements must have had some kind of internal structure, intermediate between the basic family or household unit and the totality of the co-resident community. At one level, in the smaller communities, the household may have been the basic unit of social organization. The larger communities would certainly have needed another layer of structuring between the household and the overall community of several thousand people. Thus, we may observe that there are one or two layers of social organization to be inferred below the level of the co-resident community represented in the excavated settlements. These constitute nested networks of cultural, social and economic interaction. At this point, Clive Gamble's application of network theory in the European Palaeo lithic is useful (Gamble 1998, 1999, Chap. 8). Rather than analysing social structures and institutions from the top down, network theory views the individual's world from the bottom up, following precepts outlined by Hinde (1976, 1987). The key text on network theory is Turner and Maryanski 1991, and Clive Gamble has carefully documented much of the relevant sociological and anthropological work. In the negotiation of our personal interactions and relations with one another, we have emotional, material and symbolic resources with which to operate. Turner and Maryanski identify three circles of personal networks, the most basic of which is the intimate network, our close relatives, those with whom we have day-to-day contact (Turner and Maryanski 1991). The effective network consists of around twenty people 'who provide the individual with material and emotional assistance during the routines of everyday life', people we see at work, or the lady in the local shop (Gamble 1998, p. 434). The extended network consists of 'acquaintances and friends-of-friends' (Gamble 1998, p. 435) with whom we to Springer</page><page sequence="14">152 J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 have only occasional dealings; among contemporary small-scale societies the individual's extended network ranges between 100 and 400, but there are examples where it may be as high as 1000. Beyond the concentric circles of personal networks, there is a global net work, people who are 'them' rather than 'us', but with whom an occasional transaction may need to be negotiated, whether at first hand or through an intermediary; in contem porary small-scale societies living at low densities, the global network may number about 2500 persons. While we are concerned with how these circles of personal relationships may help us to gain insight into the working of Epi-palaeolithic and early Neolithic societies in southwest Asia, Gamble was using network theory to investigate Palaeolithic societies. He concluded that early Palaeolithic people operated intimate and effective networks, but that only in the Upper Palaeolithic is there evidence for the operation of extended networks (Gamble 1999). The small Upper Palaeolithic communities, spread at low densities across the landscape, used mainly symbolic resources, that is, material things with symbolic values, to obtain 'release from proximity', the ability to network with other groups and form larger, extended communities across considerable distances (Gamble 1998). What changed in the Epi-palaeolithic of southwest Asia is that the trend towards larger, permanently co-resident settlement communities meant that the intimate networks of each of the members (essentially the close kin group), the effective networks (those 25-40 people with whom each member comes into regular contact), and the extended network (of several hundred people, with whom each member may need to deal from time to time), all came together; each individual would have day-to-day contact with any number of members of the extended network, and the geographical spread of the extended network was reduced to a few hundred metres rather than tens or hundreds of kilometres. I have written elsewhere about the novel nature and scale of the networking that underpinned the co-resident communities of the later Epi-palaeolithic and Neolithic periods (Watkins in press). These sometimes substantial settlements were the first modern communities, in that they correspond to the anthropologist Anthony Cohen's description of the characteristics of a community: Community is that entity to which one belongs, greater than kinship but more immediate than the abstraction we call "society". It is the arena in which people acquire their most fundamental and most substantial experience of social life outside the confines of the home ... At the risk of substituting one indefinable category for another, we could say it is where one acquires "culture". (Cohen 1985, p. 15) In thinking of the settlement as representing the community that has constructed itself, we should not overlook the community functioning within its wider social and cultural setting. Earlier archaeologists sought cultural parallels between excavated sites as a means of defining cultural groups and establishing a relative chronology; if their site produced near identical cultural traits to an already published site, the two sites could be assumed to be parts of the same group and broadly contemporary. The difficulty that archaeologists have experienced with the definition of such cultural groups within the Levantine corridor is a function of the increasing detail from the growing number of sites excavated; things were altogether simpler for Gordon Childe, viewing the scene at long distance from his chair in Edinburgh or London, when there were so few sites known and so little information. For the PPNA, first defined by Kathleen Kenyon in the 1950s, Jacques Cauvin found it necessary to distinguish three cultural sub-groups on the basis of the lithic assemblages, only one of which, in the southern Levant, consisted of several sites (Cauvin 2000, Chap. 4). The northern sub-group, the Mureybetian, consisted of Tell Mureybet, and the Springer</page><page sequence="15">J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 153 central sub-group was likewise a single site, Tell Aswad (which more recent excavations indicate was wrongly attributed to the period). Within a generalized similarity of lithic tradition, there were distinct local traditions, and there were very few other cultural traits that could be added to the trait-list defining a PPNA culture. Definitions of a PPNB culture have fallen into similar difficulties, for there are distinct local variations on the text-book definition of a PPNB tradition of preparing cores, producing blades, and retouching tools, making mud-bricks and building houses. If we turn to domestic architecture, the typical buildings of PPNB Jericho, with their bricks and lime plaster finishes, are found at a number of sites in the southern Levant (Byrd and Banning 1988), but not at all sites, and not in the central or northern Levant, nor in the wider PPNB cultural province in which many archaeologists have believed. The more sites we have, and the more detail we are given from those sites, the more difficult it becomes to sustain the notion of traditional 'culture-groups'. Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen (1989) alluded to the idea of an interaction sphere as an alternative to the outmoded model of the archaeological culture. And Bar-Yosef retained the notion in two more recent syntheses (Bar-Yosef and Meadow 1995; Bar-Yosef 2002), but the interaction to which he referred is not that of the archetypal interaction sphere (Caldwell 1958; Struever and Houart 1972; Steponaitis 1986, pp. 381-384). As outlined in the first part of this essay, the interaction to which the authors refer consists in substantial and regular economic exchange relations between settlements in the Mediterranean core zone, reliant on crop cultivation and herding, and culturally related hunter-gatherer groups inhabiting the semi-arid zone (Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen 1989, p. 64). The idea of a Hopewell interaction sphere originated in Joseph Caldwell's doctoral dissertation, from which the original publication (Caldwell 1958) was derived. The burial and ceremonial mounds in Ohio and neighbouring states, dating between approximately 300 BC and AD 700, are intriguing both in their own right, and for the rich and varied cultural material buried with the dead. The inventory of artefacts consists mainly of per sonal ornaments (such as pendants, necklaces, ear spools, copper 'noses', gorgets and breastplates), and objects associated with ritual (such as smoking pipes). The artefacts share features of design, and imply a common imagery and symbolism. They are made from an extraordinary list of raw materials, ranging from Gulf of Mexico marine shell, barracuda jaws, ocean turtle shells, alligator teeth from Florida, mica from North Carolina, chlorite from the Appalachian mountains, chalcedony from North Dakota, copper from the Lake Superior area, silver from Ontario, obsidian from Wyoming, grizzly bear teeth from the Rockies, and hammered meteoric iron. The ceremonial earthworks, the burials and burial mounds, and the consistent iconography of the inventory of associated artefacts made of exotic materials, imply a common world view shared across an extensive area. Some American archaeologists have therefore spoken of a 'Hopewell cult' (e.g. Struever and Houart 1972). The special feature of the Hopewell interaction sphere, however, is the interpretation that the common symbolism and world view was spread, not by the expansion of some people who carried that package of knowledge, ideas and beliefs with them, but by the power of the ideas and symbols that attracted societies over a wide area to participate in the exchange network and share symbolic values. A different, more developed and explicit, formulation of the idea of the interaction sphere, however, is that of Colin Renfrew, who upgraded the term to 'peer polity inter action sphere' (Renfrew 1986). Since we shall suggest a modified version of Renfrew's peer polity interaction sphere model, it is useful to be able to see how his model differs from the Hopewell prototype. Renfrew was thinking particularly about the circumstances under which emergent states (early state modules, as he termed them) interacted, and how Springer</page><page sequence="16">154 J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 the dynamics of the interaction process moved them towards full-blown state-level orga nizations. Some of the other contributors to the conference volume that launched the idea (Renfrew and Cherry 1986) sought to apply the principles stated by Renfrew to situations that were well short of emergent state-level polities. David Braun brought the Hopewell interaction sphere idea into the context of Renfrew's further development of the notion in the same volume (Braun 1986). 'Polity' does not have to refer to a state-level, or near state-level, political entity; the term was intended 'simply to designate an autonomous socio-political unit', without reference to 'any specific scale of organization or degree of complexity' (Renfrew 1986, p. 2). Thus, any society or com munity that regulates its own affairs, whether corporately, or through elders, chiefs or more hierarchical power-structures, may be regarded as a polity. Renfrew, it should be remembered, had earlier argued that we should be seeking to identify 'polities' in the prehistoric and proto-historic archaeological record, rather than constructing the traditional archaeological cultures (Renfrew 1974). He argued that 'polities', representing socio political realities, rather than 'cultures', should be the basic units with which we investigate prehistoric archaeology, and tell the story of prehistory. The process and trajectory of change within a peer polity interaction sphere is different from the endogenous process of development within a single socio-cultural unit (Renfrew 1986, pp. 5-6). It is also different from the exogenous change that can be imagined as occurring within a socio-cultural unit under the influence of a more socially or culturally powerful neighbour. The Levantine primacy model involves seeing the initial innovations of our period within the Levantine core as endogenous developments within a sequence of cultural groups. Their diffusion to the rest of southwest Asia is then seen as exogenous change (through diffusion of whatever form). When investigators conclude that the innovations within the Levantine core were driven by ecological and economic pressures (through environmental deterioration, insufficiency of food resources, or population growth), they are once again devising models that involve exogenous change (whereby societies make cultural responses?changing their subsistence strategies?to external pressures). Peer polity interaction involves change emerging within a group of interacting polities, on a regional rather than a local scale. It involves a series of polities of more or less even and equal status, and the process within a peer polity interaction sphere spreads throughout the participant socio-cultural units, driven by the dynamics of the interactivity itself. Renfrew described the nature of the interactions under three headings: (a) competition (including warfare), and competitive emulation; (b) symbolic entrainment, and the trans mission of innovation; and (c) increased flow in the exchange of goods. The competitive emulation in Renfrew's original formulation was to be seen in the form of a sharing of symbolism and symbolic elements among the top tier of local hierarchies, enabling elites to differentiate themselves within their own communities by reason of their participation in a high-status, cosmopolitan, symbolic culture-system. As they emulate one another, neigh bouring polities may be spurred to ever greater displays of wealth or power in an effort to achieve higher inter-polity status (Renfrew 1986, p. 8). This particular aspect may not apply in the same way in our Neolithic world, where no-one has been able to produce a convincing case for social hierarchies. The active participants in Neolithic polity inter action may have been at the polity level of individual communities, or clusters of small village-communities. There is a case to be made for evidence of competitive emulation in rather different terms, in the form of the widespread possession of very particular forms of projectile point that were made using very specialized preparation and retouching tech niques. I have suggested elsewhere (Watkins 1992) that the projectile points (and the ?) Springer</page><page sequence="17">J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 155 massive wall and rock-cut ditch around Tell es-Sultan) were elements in a system of display, competition and even inter-community conflict that on occasion caused deaths (as evidenced by projectile points found embedded in buried human remains). In Renfrew's introduction to peer polity interaction, it appears that it is the competitive element in emulation that drives the system toward the intensification of exchange and the increasing convergence in imagery and symbolism. If we are to use the idea of peer polity interaction spheres in the context of the early Neolithic of southwest Asia, we shall need an alternative motive driving the system towards intensification and convergence. Symbolic entrainment, Renfrew says, 'entails the tendency for a developed symbolic system to be adopted when it comes into contact with a less-developed one with which it does not strikingly conflict' (Renfrew 1986, p. 8). He observes that symbolic entrainment may well be more significant than competition in many situations. Together with symbolic entrainment, Renfrew includes the transmission of innovation, even though the innovations may not seem to be of a symbolic nature (Renfrew 1986, p. 9). As Renfrew remarks, an innovation is only successful, and indeed detectable, if it meets widespread acceptance. That widespread acceptance is a mark of the close relations of the participant polities and their convergence over time. There may be a case to be made for understanding the rapid spread of cultivation and herding, and domesticated crops and animals, around much of 'the hilly flanks of the Fertile Crescent' within the context of the transmission of inno vations. One of the features of competitive emulation is likely to be degrees of intensification. The classic example in the anthropological literature is the practice of potlatch among the societies of the Pacific coastal peoples of the northwest USA and western Canada. Indeed, Hayden (1990, 1992, 1995a, b, 2001) has argued that the kind of competitive feasting that characterized the Pacific northwest coast peoples was fuelled by intensified food production. And he has suggested that the demand for foodstuffs beyond subsistence needs triggered the adoption of cultivation among hunter-gatherer peoples; further, the competitive aspect of institutionalized feasting, in Hayden's view, helped the process of social change from undifferentiated hunter-gatherer societies to ranked societies and chiefdoms. The third characteristic that Renfrew described is increased flow in information and the exchange of goods and materials, an archaeological signal of the increasing intensity of interaction within the interaction sphere. Archaeological Indicators of Networking Here I set out to show that there is much archaeological evidence for exchange and interaction of the kinds defined by Renfrew as characteristic of a peer polity interaction sphere. There are hard archaeological indicators of exchange of goods and materials, and of the sharing of cultural practices in the early Neolithic of southwest Asia, especially in the better investigated parts. Beyond thinking of these phenomena as evidence of trade or social exchange, we can see them as surviving indicators of extensive networking. Here, we can do no more than take a quick look at some of them, before seeing how we may adapt Renfrew's peer polity interaction sphere formula for application in early prehistory. Obsidian Exchange Networks The best documented example of networking is the exchange of obsidian from central and eastern Anatolia through much of the rest of southwest Asia (see Cauvin et al. 1998 for a recent and extensive study). Renfrew distinguished two kinds of use of obsidian (Renfrew Springer</page><page sequence="18">156 J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 et al. 1966, 1968; Renfrew and Dixon 1976). He showed that aceramic Neolithic com munities within two or three hundred kilometres of the sources in central and eastern Anatolia depended on the supply of obsidian, which they used for at least 80% of their chipped stone needs. It was critical to their economic functioning. Outside the zone in which settlements supplied their basic economic needs for chipped stone from the obsidian sources, there was a much more extensive zone where percentages of obsidian declined more or less exponentially with distance from the sources. From the central Anatolian sources, obsidian was spread to Cyprus, Cilicia and throughout the Levant, almost as far as the Gulf of Aqaba. Obsidian from the eastern Anatolian sources is found through the Anti Taurus piedmont, across north Mesopotamia, and down the Zagros valleys and piedmont at least as far as southwest Iran. This outer zone was called by Renfrew the contact zone?the zone within which people relied on exchange with their social exchange partners. Percentages of obsidian declined from 5% at 400 km, to 1 % at 530 km, and 0.1 % in southern Jordan, almost 900 km from the Anatolian sources. The tiny amounts of obsidian at sites in the Levant and through the Zagros region show that the material played an insignificant economic role. However, the ubiquity of obsidian and the persistence of the exchange network through time (beginning as early as the Epi-palaeolithic period) are indicative of the socio-cultural importance of the networking that moved the obsidian around (see Cauvin and Chataigner 1998; Chataigner 1998 for the most recent synthetic studies). At first, in the Epi-palaeolithic period and the earliest aceramic Neolithic, amounts of obsidian were tiny. The volume of obsidian in the exchange network increased with time; in general, sites of later aceramic Neolithic date have considerably more than sites of the early aceramic Neolithic. Interestingly, the situation in Cyprus is the reverse; amounts of obsidian are greater in the newly discovered, early sites that date to the middle of the mainland aceramic Neolithic, and percentages decrease as cultural relations with the mainland decline. In other words, the exchange of obsidian is part of a system of cultural relations. When the later aceramic Neolithic settlements of the Levant were abandoned, exchange of obsidian greatly reduced in volume in the successor settlements of the ceramic Neolithic period. There were other artefacts and materials of low functional significance in the material economy that were exchanged, notably marine shells from both the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. Red Sea shells were exchanged at least as far north as northern Syria, and Mediterranean shells that are found on many inland sites in the Levant occur also on sites in the centre of Anatolia. In the Levant, vesicular basalt for use in pounding and grinding implements, and various kinds of attractive stone used for making personal ornaments, were exchanged over considerable distances. While the stone is very good for use in querns, mortars, pounders and rubbers, it is very dense and heavy, and its transport by humans over tens of kilometres is an extravagant use of energy. Reduction Strategies for Chipped Stone Evidence of a different kind of networking is the practice of sharing technology. In the later aceramic Neolithic, it became common over a very large part of southwest Asia for people to use a particular and peculiar reduction strategy (Aurenche and Kozlowski 1999, p. 61). It takes variant forms, but in essence it involves forming cores that can be struck from either end?bipolar cores. Flakes or blade blanks were then struck alternately from either end of the core. At one extreme, the core had a robust 'keel' shape, the so-called naviform core. For reasons that cannot be explained in terms of changing technological Springer</page><page sequence="19">J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 157 demands, people wanted larger tools, and particularly larger projectile points (see next section). In southeast and central Turkey, an alternative reduction technique was used, especially on obsidian?the so-called bullet core, producing exceptionally narrow, thin and long blade blanks. Projectile Points From the very beginning of the Neolithic period, around 10,000 BC, there appears another cultural phenomenon?the common projectile point types throughout the Levant and beyond (Gopher 1989). It used to be thought that the types were shared up and down the Levantine corridor zone, but the area is wider than that. The earliest form of projectile point, the little double notched Khiam point, for example, is found at sites as far east as north Iraq (Qermez Dere on the south face of the Jebel Sinjar, west of Mosul, and MTefaat, in the piedmont east of Mosul). Like the common use of bi-polar core technology, shared projectile point types transcend other cultural traits. Point types also change quite quickly. A new form appears, and it is often shared widely. One type supersedes another without any obvious technical advantage. The early Neolithic projectile points may be prefigured by the careful elaboration of microlith types in the preceding Epi-palaeolithic period. In the later aceramic Neolithic period, projectile points are typically a good deal larger and heavier. The larger, later point types may have been lance-heads rather than arrow heads. Kozlowksi has bundled the large projectile point types of the later aceramic Neolithic period into his 'Big Arrowheads Industry', reaching from the northern end of the Levant to the upper Euphrates and Tigris headwaters in the southeast Anatolian piedmont, and across to north central Iraq (Aurenche and Kozlowski 1999, pp. 103-104; map reproduced as Asouti 2006; Fig. 5). Since it was mentioned above that the exchange network that moved obsidian was already in existence in the later Epi-palaeolithic period, it is worth adding that core reduction strategies, bladelet production, and particularly the intricacies of manufacturing highly specialized microlith types were shared up and down the Levantine corridor throughout the Epi-palaeolithic period. Architecture Archaeologists have noted particular architectural designs of houses that are shared across a number of sites. In parts of the southern Levant in the later aceramic Neolithic, the pier house is common, its walls and floors often finished in thick lime plaster, which might be coloured and burnished (Byrd and Banning 1988). In southeast Anatolia, settlements had very large and substantially built houses, constructed in mud brick on stone and mud mortar foundations (Schirmer 1990; Bicakgi 1995). At one time, the stone and mud foundations consisted of a series of square cells; at another time, they consisted of closely set parallel walls. It appears that the sequence of architectural changes?from grids to sleeper walls?is replicated at different sites across the region. These stereotyped regional house types (called by Aurenche and Kozlowski the 'culture a grandes maisons rectan gulaires') were built to quite elaborate designs, which suggest that their forms, construction methods and finishes were culturally constrained rather than driven by simply functional needs for shelter. There is also a generic architectural form to the special purpose buildings that have recently been found at Nevali ?ori, the latest of the enclosures at Gobekli Tepe, and the Springer</page><page sequence="20">158 J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 terrazzo building at ?ayonu Tepesi. The first to be recognized was the terrazzo building at ?aydnu Tepesi (Ozdogan 1999). We have better documentation for the similar structure found at the salvage archaeology site, Nevah ?ori, close to the Euphrates (Hauptmann 1988, 1992, 1993, but especially the well illustrated Hauptmann 1999). The latest of the enclosures at Gobekli Tepe was strikingly similar to the Nevali ?ori example, but the earlier structures are not only much larger but also circular in plan (Schmidt 1995, 1997, 1999, 2000a, b, 2002, 2006, 2007; Peters and Schmidt 2004). All of these southeast Anatolian special buildings were equipped with pairs of sculpted stone pillars. At Nevali ?ori and Gobekli Tepe the pairs of stone pillars in the centre of the floor area were complemented by more pillars set transversely in the stone 'benches' around the walls of the structures. When they meet at conferences, Klaus Schmidt and Danielle Stordeur compare notes on the similarities between the enclosures and their stelae at Gobekli Tepe and the communal buildings at Jerf el Ahmar, and some of their comparisons are refracted in Stordeur's recent essay with F. Abbes (Stordeur and Abbes 2002). As more sub-rect angular and sub-circular, subterranean enclosures with pairs of sculpted pillars are unearthed in southeast Anatolia, it becomes clear that the 'houses' at Qermez Dere (Watkins 1990; Watkins et al. 1991, 1995) may be examples of the same general phe nomenon, and their identification as domestic may need to be re-thought. Treatment of the Dead The hundreds of human burials and the caches of human skulls, especially the plastered skulls, from Jericho surprised everyone in the 1950s; the practice of intramural burial among the houses, and the retrieval and curation of skulls, became a key cluster of traits in the early formulation of a PPNB culture (see, for example, Kenyon 1957, 1960). Exca vating on other settlement sites of the same age, archaeologists soon began to record the same or very similar phenomena. The complex of cultural traits associated with the burial of dead bodies and the curation of detached human skulls began to be called a 'skull cult' (e.g. Bienert 1991). In fact, there is a lack of systematic regularity; the generalities apply through the Levant (as far north as Abu Hureyra in North Syria?Molleson et al. 1992), but what has been found at one site is not quite the same as what has been found at others. Indeed, a very variable range of practices can be found at a single site, and even within a single funerary complex, as recent work at Tell As wad shows (Stordeur 2003c; Stordeur and Khawam 2006, 2007). The most elaborate rituals, including a number of practices not paralleled at any other site, have been found at the unique site of Kfar HaHoresh (Goring Morris et al. 1998; Goring-Morris 2000). In southeast Turkey and in the Euphrates valley sites across the modem frontier in north Syria, the rituals are different. Only a few intramural burials have been found, for example in the base-level of houses at ?ay6mi. The so-called skull building at ?ayonu (Ozdogan 1999), with crania and bones of hundreds of individuals stacked in subterranean cells, has parallels in the 'Maison des Morts' at Dja'de, a small, four-roomed building containing remains of some 38 individuals (Coqueugniot 1998, 2000), and a small, house-like building at Abu Hureyra, into which remains of more than 50 individuals were crammed, some on the floor of a small room, others in a shallow pit below the floor of an adjacent room (Moore and Molleson 2000). At Qermez Dere, in north Iraq, the only human remains were parts of badly weathered skulls and mandibles placed in a subterranean building when it was dismantled and filled in at the end of its life (Watkins 1990). Once we move away from the southern Levant, we probably have too few sites excavated, and insufficient exposures at those sites, to Springer</page><page sequence="21">J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 159 in most cases, to allow us to begin to perceive other regional or local patterns. However, we can say that the emphasis on intramural deposition of the bodies of selected individuals extended over most of southwest Asia, beginning in the Epi-palaeolithic period, and growing in intensity and richness through the early Neolithic Period. Shared Imagery and Symbolism Jacques Cauvin thought that the key symbolic images of the early Neolithic were human female figurines and bull figurines (Cauvin 2000). Others have cast doubt on his analysis and conclusions. There are certainly lots of human figures, but only a few can be expressly identified as female. Similarly, few are expressly male. After the dearth of representations of humans in the late Palaeolithic, there is a host of human representations in the early Neolithic. Some are mask-like faces, others are heads, some are small, schematic whole figures. There are also, of course, the half life-size plaster figures from 'Ain Ghazal in Jordan (see Kuijt 2008 for a well-referenced review of all these phenomena in the context of an enlightening discussion of the function of these symbolic practices within the communities of the Levant). And perhaps we should include the curated and cached human skulls, especially those that have modelled facial features. Danielle Stordeur, the excavator of Jerf el Ahmar, has recently surveyed the recurring representational symbols, animal and human, illustrating a number of the most recently discovered examples (Stordeur 2003b; see also Helmer et al. 2004). She draws out some of the recurrent themes and associations, in particular human death and wild and dangerous animals, as remarked by Ian Hodder for Catalhoyiik (Hodder 1990, 2006) and generally for southwest Asia by Cauvin (2000). There are some particularly interesting objects with incised signs from Jerf el Ahmar in north Syria, some of which are known among archaeologists as 'shaft-straighteners' or 'pierres a rainure' (Stordeur and Jammous 1995; Stordeur 2003b). But there are also plaques of stone of similar size that are flat on both surfaces; they have no other function than to carry what has been incised into their surfaces. The carved motifs on these plaques and shaft-straighteners, however, are not simply covering a surface with decoration. One side of each of the flat plaques may be 'wallpaper', but the other side in each case is carved with a group of what can only be called 'signs'. The group from Jerf el Ahmar are no longer unique. Similar plaques carved with signs are now known from southeast Turkey, and another site in northwest Syria. And the repertoire of signs seems to be shared. A sign can operate as an index of the thing that it signifies, but when a vocabulary of signs is used in combinations, as in these examples and on the sculpted T-shaped monoliths, we can begin to think that we are in the presence of a system of symbolic representation (Watkins 2004, 2005). One of the most striking discoveries of recent years has been the series of monumental, non-domestic buildings on sites in southeast Anatolia and the Syrian Euphrates. In addition to the common architectural features (subterranean construction, 'benches'), the sculpted pillars are clearly symbolic, both in form and for the sculpted reliefs on their surfaces. Some of the T-shaped pillars reveal themselves as anthropomorphic through their lightly carved arms, bent at the elbows, and hands. It is now clear that the so-called flagstone building at ?aydnu was the eroded remains of a similar, subterranean building, which also had a pair of tall, stone pillars (Ozdogan 1999). Even more remarkable is the site of Gobekli Tepe, near Urfa in southeast Anatolia (Schmidt 1995, 1997, 1999, 2000a, b, 2006; Peters and Schmidt 2004). It sits on top of a bare limestone ridge, overlooking the extensive plains around Urfa and Harran. The site Springer</page><page sequence="22">160 J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 consists of heaped up cultural debris, into which large, subterranean, circular or sub rectangular structures have been excavated. The sides of the structures consist of massive, dry-stone retaining walls; and several of the structures show signs of having been recon structed with a smaller enclosure inside the original, larger structure. Each of the four structures so far excavated contains a central pair of T-shaped limestone pillars. The largest structure with the tallest pillars is currently under excavation, and the central pillars are at least 5 m tall, while many others are at least 3 m tall. Around the perimeter of the structure is a stone bench, and more pillars are set radially into the bench. Some of the pillars have details that make clear that, like those at Nevah f ori, they are highly schematised an thropomorphs. On their surfaces there are relief carvings of a range of animals, birds, reptiles and scorpions. At the end of the excavations at Jerf el Ahmar in north Syria, a similar structure was found, and a very similar carved stone pillar, too. Jerf el Ahmar, also, had subterranean special purpose buildings (Stordeur 1998a, b, 1999, 2000; Stordeur and Jammous 1995; Stordeur et al. 1996, 1997, 2000). Both Stordeur and Schmidt have remarked the similarity in the imagery and symbolism between their sites. Perhaps the subterranean structures at Qermez Dere in north Iraq, with their mud-plastered pairs of pillars, are another version of the same kind of architectural symbolism, though without the applied animal figures (Watkins 1990; Watkins et al. 1995). In the Levant, especially the south Levant, the use of human bodies, skulls, skulls with modelled facial features, masks and three-dimensional representations of humans can be said to be symbolic and shared imagery. The association of human figures (some headless) with dangerous and wild animals across a wide area in the north of our region is likewise conspicuous. Once again, for most other parts of southwest Asia we do not have enough information from the scattered sites that have been explored, mostly on too small a scale, to allow us to begin to observe regularities and patterns of distribution. Discussion: The Earliest Peer Polity Interaction Spheres What does the evidence for exchange, networking and sharing amount to? Some materials were exchanged, and prized (though there is no evidence of the economic exchange of basic subsistence materials as posited by Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen (1989)). The pat terns we can observe in the archaeological record may be seen as testimony to exchanges that are essentially cultural and social rather than economic. The exchange-networks implied by the various kinds of information sketched in the previous section involved the transfer of materials and goods, but their values were as information, shared ideas, com mon beliefs and converging symbolic representation. Renfrew's 'down-the-line' exchange networks carried obsidian in the Epi-palaeolithic and especially in the aceramic Neolithic period from central or eastern Anatolia to prac tically every community of the south of the arc of the Anti-Taurus mountains. The raw material might be formed into small cutting tools or delicate projectile points, or simply kept in the form in which it had been received, as blank bladelets ready for retouching, but the minute amounts (outside the 'supply zone', see above) should convince us that its value was not economic. It may have been a material prized for its attractiveness, its rarity, for being exotic, or for more formally symbolic significance; only further study may help us to understand the values that were put on it in different communities. Similarly, and even more clearly, the less well-documented transfer of marine shells from the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, or the Gulf to many communities deep inland, indicates that cultural values were placed upon these small objects, their exchange, and their exotic nature. It is easy to to Springer</page><page sequence="23">J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 161 prefer social and cultural motives, rather than functional or economic advantages, for the widespread adoption of distinctive core reduction strategies, or the changing fashions in projectile points across very wide areas. The shared practices of selection of corpses, their intramural interment, and the subsequent retrieval of skulls for further treatment clearly document common ideologies and common generic ideas concerning their expression. It seems to me that shared domestic architecture design, both within the community and among communities, is more than simply local traditions that produce effective weather proof and secure shelters. There was no obvious need for the large, rectangular houses with raised floors in southeast Anatolia, or the pier-houses of the southern Levant, with their lavish use of expensively prepared lime-plaster, burnishing and colouring, to be as they were. Just as there is no logic of improved design for greater functionality with the constantly changing projectile points, there is no obvious advantage in changing the design of the southeast Anatolian house sub-structure from cell-plan to grid-plan to large-room plans. In other words, the domestic architecture of many settlements served cultural per ceptions of domestic practices, and embodied symbolic values, as is commonly said of the domestic architecture of many of today's small-scale societies (for example, Rapoport 1969, 1982; Wilson 1988; Watkins 2004, for a fuller discussion). It is not difficult to point in turn to the various elements of exchange, networking and sharing that have been sketched, and relate each to one or more of those key dynamics of peer polity interaction sphere that Renfrew defined: (a) competition and competitive emulation; (b) symbolic entrainment, and the transmission of innovation; and (c) increased flow in the exchange of goods. We can chart through the late Epi-palaeolithic and aceramic Neolithic an increasing intensity of exchange in the obsidian statistics. And the intensity of shared rituals associated with the treatment of dead bodies and human heads can also be seen to increase over the long term, from the late Epi-palaeolithic to the late aceramic Neolithic. Another feature of the operation of peer polity interaction sphere that Renfrew observes is that change emerges 'from the assemblage of interacting polities ... at the regional level'. He notes that 'when a significant organisational change ... is recognised within one polity, it is generally the case that some of the polities within the region will undergo the same transformation at about the same time', in such a way that no 'single locus of innovation' is observable. These observations strike a chord when we consider the arguments that have raged over the years concerning whether some cultural phenomenon occurs first here or there within the region. Indeed, it seems likely that, however much more detailed information is gathered, these arguments are incapable of resolution in terms of defining the priority of centres of innovation and documenting the dissemination from those centres to other parts of our region. Conclusion: Nested Networks of Community I suggest that what we see in the early Neolithic in southwest Asia, at least in the western half of the 'hilly flanks' zone, is the emergence of the first local and regional peer polity interaction spheres. With the passage of time, there emerged out of these primal interaction spheres a powerful, supra-regional peer polity interaction sphere. However, there are significant differences between the interaction processes and the agencies defined by Renfrew in his formulation of the archetype peer polity interaction sphere (Renfrew 1986) and what we can see in the complex socio-cultural networks of the aceramic Neolithic. As we recalled above, Renfrew himself was interested in the interaction processes among 'early state modules', and the emergence of states controlled by rulers or tightly defined Springer</page><page sequence="24">162 J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 oligarchic elites. The other contributors to the key publication (Renfrew and Cherry 1986) were concerned with case-studies of polities that were similarly (believed to be) hierar chical. In the classic peer polity interaction sphere, it is the elites that chiefly engage in the interaction that brings them exotic and valuable goods and materials that mark their high status and distinguish them from the rest of their societies. A distinctive characteristic of our early Neolithic societies?the basic peer polities in our interaction spheres?is that they show no sign of containing social or political elites, or of being hierarchically organized societies. The indications are that the large settlements, and perhaps the local clusters of small settlements, were home to segmentary societies. Segmentary societies may be described as relatively small and autonomous groups, usually of agriculturalists, who regulate their own affairs; in some cases, they may join together with other comparable segmentary societies to form a larger ethnic unit. Such societies are often tribally organized. A tribe may be described as a descent and kinship-based group in which subgroups are clearly linked to one another, with the potential of uniting a large number of local groups for common defence or warfare. Individual communities tend to be integrated into the larger society through kinship ties. We can, therefore, expect to see little or no sign of competition or competitive emulation, and we indeed find no evidence that access to the goods or materials that were exchanged was restricted to a superior minority. The emulation that we see seems to involve whole polities. We can consider cultural interaction, or networking, in the early Neolithic as operating at two levels, both within polities (settlements, or communities), and among polities or communities. We may be able to appreciate what was involved in the maintenance of communality and a sense of community for these early sedentary societies through a reading of Anthony Cohen's concise but powerful book The Symbolic Construction of Community (Cohen 1985). Cohen's fundamental concern was to make the point that 'community' does not define a particular structural type of social form: rather, commu nities are symbolically constructed in the minds of their members (or recognized as different in the minds of members of other communities). He was engaged in an argument with sociologists and anthropologists, particularly the Chicago school, who have believed that 'community' is a feature of small-scale societies that is either redundant in contem porary advanced societies, or has been eliminated in the transformation from the 'primitive' to the 'modem' world. The importance of Cohen's work for us, however, is that it unfolds the cognitive and cultural complexity involved in the maintenance of the completely mental construct of community. It may be argued that the construct of community defined in part by kinship but more significantly by residence became possible for humans only with the emergence of minds that were capable of operating in terms of symbolic culture. Cohen discusses the relational nature of community identity, and he also analyses the essentially symbolic construction and functioning of communities of whatever kind. People identify with their community through the medium of the symbolic values that they share, and that differ entiate them from members of other communities. '"Community" thus seems to imply simultaneously both similarity and difference' (Cohen 1985, p. 12). This observation draws attention to the process of symbolic entrainment, central to the process within a peer polity interaction sphere, which would involve the progressive convergence of symbolic systems. Communities, according to Cohen, rely upon their singular differences from one another. The inevitable inference is that the motive for engaging in symbolic entrainment must be very powerful, if the desire to converge effectively overcomes the general tendency of communities to maintain their distinctive differences. Indeed, in several Springer</page><page sequence="25">J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 163 case-studies involving small-scale societies Cohen refers to the importance given to the maintenance of a community's symbolic culture as a defence against the powerful pene tration of modern western culture. He also illustrates his point that 'we find that all such categories [of social knowledge] are marked by symbolism' (Cohen 1985, p. 14) by ref erence to the observations of various ethnographers working among surviving small-scale societies, and to his own work among Shetland islanders and Newfoundland communities. Cohen concludes that 'the consciousness of community has to be kept alive through manipulation of its symbols' (Cohen 1985, p. 15). This capacity to build and maintain communities that were larger than the circle of immediate kin was necessary in order for early Neolithic groups to live together, for the first time in human history, in co-resident groups of several hundred or several thousand people in permanent settlements. Human cognitive and cultural faculties had been evolved to such a level of symbolic competence in the context of residence in larger sedentary groups (Wilson 1988; Watkins 2003a, 2004, 2005). Human social group size was growing rapidly relative to the rate of evolution of the human brain, and had out-grown the bio logical capacity of the brain to deal with the scale and complexity of social relationships (Aiello and Dunbar 1993; Dunbar 1996, 2004). Symbolic culture and minds capable of operating with systems of symbolic representation were essential for the formation and maintenance of communities in which notions of trust and the ability to detect 'free loaders' were vital (Dunbar 1999; Watkins 2003a). What I have been at pains to emphasize is something that we today take for granted (if we are aware of it at all) in our everyday social lives: the active participation of members of a community involves considerable abstract knowledge and symbolic competence, as well as continual active engagement. We generally find it easier to plug into small-scale, local communities?a faith community, a university institute, a residents' association?and more difficult to make a reality of membership of a nation state. Cohen (1985, pp. 13-14) dis cusses the increasing scale of cognitive difficulty that contemporary, western people have in making a reality of higher levels of 'community', at the regional, national and supra national level. It should be emphasized that we are considering societies that preferred to live together in numbers in the hundreds and thousands. If communities of sedentary or semi-sedentary hunter-gatherers of the Epi-palaeolithic period were larger and more permanent than the classic mobile hunter-gatherer bands of the Upper Palaeolithic by a factor of five to ten, then many early Neolithic communities were larger again. In economic and ergonomic terms, such large co-resident groups were stretching the capacity of their immediately accessible territory to provide them with the foodstuffs that they needed. They were also requiring some of the community to hunt, gather, harvest, cultivate or herd at distances from the settlement that involved substantial costs in terms of the time taken to go out and bring back the product of their food quest. In terms of ergonomic logic, it would have been more sensible to retain the small scale of the hunter-gatherer band, living in a scatter of small hamlet-sized communities, each in the middle of the territory that it exploited. Living together in large agglomerations permanently resident in one place was a high-risk choice, and the risk was increased with the adoption of plant cultivation and animal herding; it increased the risks of communicating infectious diseases (e.g. Cohen 1989); and it involved a substantial cost in time and effort in terms of hunting and gathering or cultivation and herding. As far as the Neolithic 'super-sites' were concerned, where populations probably numbered between five and ten thousand, those whose land was at the outer edges of the settlement's territory were virtual commuters, spending hours each day getting to and from their places of work. Why should people choose to pay those costs? Springer</page><page sequence="26">164 J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 Living in large population agglomerations seems to flout the rules of the game of evolu tion, because it makes human populations less fitted for their environment. It seems that we should redefine our idea of 'environment', and differentiate the environment within which we as biological populations of Homo sapiens operate from the cultural and symbolically rich environment within which most of our sentient lives are passed. If our present world may be taken as a guide (setting aside the economic drivers of our contemporary urbanised lives), then living in large, dense population agglomerations is attractive for many people. For many of us, the physical disadvantages of living in a big city or a large metropolis are outweighed by the rich cultural environment that the city offers, and the ability to engage with others of like mind, whether that is writers, painters, actors, musicians, political activists, intellectuals, senior tennis players, or any minority interest group. The cultural preference for the opportunities, stimulation and richness of living in high density settlements over-rides ergonomics, economics or biological ecology. Yet what we seem to be seeing in the early Neolithic is the deliberate engagement of communities, which were already complex and expensive to operate, in a higher level of networking for the creation of wide-ranging peer polity interaction spheres. And that must have placed even greater demands on people's time, energy and attention, as well as their newly evolved cognitive and cultural facility, with devising and operating non-verbal systems of symbolic representation. It is easy to suppose that this observation drawn from today's rich cultural environments may be generalised into a constant, something that people have 'always' needed or enjoyed. In the long view of human and hominin prehistory, that cannot be true. Rather, it is arguable from the archaeological record that cultural networking, and the ability to develop both large, strong and durable co-residential communities, as well as wide-area networks, or interaction spheres, is a phenomenon of the earliest Holocene, the early Neolithic, in southwest Asia. Why then? Why not earlier? The cultural ability, and wish, to live in larger, permanent communities can be traced back to the beginning of the Epi palaeolithic period, 10,000 years earlier. And the long-distance movement of materials, implying the existence of wide-ranging social networks, can be documented in the Upper Palaeolithic. The emergence of symbolically constructed communities, both at the local, co-resident level, and at the level of the wide-area networking of local communities, is not a 'big bang' phenomenon of the transition from the Epi-palaeolithic to the Neolithic periods. But there is a quantum change in the power of cultural networking at that Pleistocene-Holocene transition. And that leap in cultural faculties can be attributed to the capability of human minds to formulate fully symbolic cultures of the kind necessary to sustain peer polity interaction spheres, or multi-level and wide-area socio-cultural net works (Watkins 2003a, 2004, 2005). All sorts of social and economic reasons can be hypothesised to help us imagine why effectively self-sufficient communities spent energy and effort in active participation in a peer polity interaction sphere. In the original formulation of the idea of peer polity interaction spheres and their application in various prehistoric and proto-historic contexts (Renfrew and Cherry 1986), the dynamic driving all of the examples described was implicitly concerned with the advantages (to the social elites) of greater status, wealth or power, but these are circumstances that do not apply in our non-hierarchical, segmentary societies. In early Neolithic terms, Cauvin argues for the power of a PPNB ideology that was eagerly adopted by indigenous peoples beyond the Levantine corridor (Cauvin 2000, Chap. 8 and following). But Cohen (1985, p. 15) warns us that 'Symbols do not so much express meaning as give us the capacity to make meaning'. We may share a suite of symbols, but not necessarily share their meanings, as each of us makes and takes our own Springer</page><page sequence="27">J World Prehist (2008) 21:139-171 165 meanings. Cohen gives examples of the incorporation of symbolic values from elsewhere (for example, Christian beliefs and practices) by a community which provides its own meanings rather than those associated with the symbolism in the other society. We should not be misled by the adoption of common symbols into thinking that they had common meanings. In fact, the frustrating lack of uniformity in the traditions of burial of selected bodies within the settlement and the so-called 'skull cult' are perhaps evidence of the (partial) incorporation of patterns of symbolic behaviour within communities that each understand and articulate the symbolic values somewhat differently. In summary, from the latter part of the Epi-palaeolithic and the beginning of the Neolithic in southwest Asia, in subtle and complex ways, people were formulating and expressing multi-layered identities, not unlike our own contemporary situation, for instance, as members of a family, living in a particular neighbourhood, citizens of a particular town or city, as English and at the same time British, Californian and at the same time American. They were using, for the first time, sophisticated, symbolic means of articulating their multi-layered identities?as family or household, as lineages, as communities, as members of local clusters of villages, as participants in regional and supra-regional networks. As the aceramic Neolithic progressed, we may observe the increasing intensity and the growing extent of at least one such supra-regional socio-cultural network in what has been loosely and variously termed the PPNB phenomenon. I suggest that these were the first modern human communities to possess the cognitive and cultural faculties to enable them to formulate such abstract and complex constructs. Thus they were able for the first time in human history to forge and sustain permanently settled communities numbering hundreds and even thousands; and they were also able to form local, regional and supra-regional networks in the manner of nested peer polity interaction spheres. And I also suspect that in most of the rest of cultural history, between their times and ours, more or less peer communities operated as a norm of social and cultural behaviour in interaction spheres or cultural networks. Unlike ourselves, and unlike in any historical times, they were able to maintain large co-resident communities that were linked into very extensive interaction spheres, without the need for any vertical, or simul taneous, social hierarchies of socio-political control.
