<plain_text><page sequence="1">VII.-NEW BOOKS. iFroebet as a Pioneer in Modern Psychology. By E. R. MURRAY. George Philip &amp; Son, Ltd., 1915. Pp. 230. Miss E. R. Murray's little book on Froebel as a Pioneer in Modern Psychology deserves attention, for it comes at a time when the great educator is under a cloud. Of late years it has been the fashion in some quarters to speak slightingly of Froebel's work and power. His mysticism is often referred to with a sneer, and he is apt to be regarded by some of the younger generation of teachers as antiquated and little vworth troubling about. For them the Dottoressa Montessori occupies the stage, and they look uponI Froebel as a star long since departed. Miss Murray has set herself the task of helping Froebel to come to his own. She desires to prove that even in the light of our best and most modern psychologists, he does not stand eclipsed, but rather has antici- pated all the most important of their views. The plan of the book is to take one by one the modern views on the analysis of Mind, on Will, on the gradual evolution of Self-consciousness, on Attention and Instinct, and to show that Froebel has anticipated the conclusions of our foremost psychologists, of Dr. Ward, of Prof. Stout, of Mr. MacDougal and various American writers. The task set is admirably performed. Parallel passages are brought before us of the most striking similarity, passages that prove Froebel to be greatly before his age, and in really remarkable accordance with our pxesent-day leaders. E.g. in dealing with the gradual development of will from early mental activity Prof. Stout tells us that it is of the essence of conation to seek its own satisfaction, and this is only possible as the conation becomes definite. " Blind craving gives place to open- eyed desire," as the original conation tends to define itself. So, "the gradual acquisition of knowledge through experience is but another ex- pression for the process whereby the blind craving becomes more distinct and more differentiated ". This is compared with a passage in Froebel's paper on " Movement Plays '. " All outer activity of the child has its ultimate and distinctive foundation in his inmost nature and life. The deepest craving of this inner activity is to behold itself mirrored in some outward object. In and through such representation the child himself grasps and perceives the nature, direction and aim of his own activity, and learns also further to regulate and determine his life, that is his activity according to these outward phenomena." Froebel's conclusion that only as this unconscious or blind craving for action is satisfied does the child become conscious of the nature, direction and ends of his own activity, is but another way of stating Prof. Stout's conclusion that the grouping of cognition, which is the gradual acquirement of knowledge through experience, is " the way in which the conation itself grows and develops ". (See pp. 27, 28.) It is to Dr. Ward that we owe the wonderfully clear picture of the dawn of consciousness, the gradual development of " a total presentation</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS. 265 having the character of one general continuum in which differences are latent," but even here Miss Vlurray points out that Froebel probably avoided the " mental obscurity " of his contemporaries because he held somewhat the same view as his successors. " Although in itself made up of the same objects and of the same organisation, the external world," he writes, " comes to the child at first, out of its void, as it were, in misty, formless indistincttness, in chaotic confusion; even the child and the outer world merge into one another." The chapter on Instincts is particularly interesting, as Froebel is here brought into touch with Mr. MacDougal as well as Mr. Kirkpatrick and Mr. Ebby. Froebel is found to have admitted anl inistinct of Self-Assertion, and his views on Play and Imitation are held to be in close accord with those of Mr. MacDougal. In the chapter on Play Miss Murray takes each modern theory in turn and shows how remarkably Froebel has anticipated them. Of play as " surplus energy " Froebel, like our most recent writers, will have none, for according to himn there is not more than enough " healthy vital energy " in each child. But as far as our chief authorities, Groos and Stanley Hall go, Froebel, according to Miss Murray, really combines their theories of Preparation and Recapitulation. " You know that your sons need energy, judgment, perseverance, prudence, etc., and all these things they are sure to get in the course indicated" (i.e. through play) (pp. 138-139). " In the development of the inner life of the individual man, the history of the mental development of the race is repeated." " Each successive individual human being must pass through all preceding phases of human development." Having convincingly shown us Froebel's points of likeness to our modern writers, Miss Murray goes on with great frankness to consider Froebel's weak points. It is probably on this chapter that both earnest Froebelians and Froebel's opposers will have most to say. The former may criticise the author's evident objection to Froebel's mystic ten- dencies which she dis.misses with the assertion that " the average teacher is incapable of philosophy ". Philosophy and mysticism are not neces- sarily identical, but it is clear that Miss Murray has little sympathy with the mystic type of mind. In the chapter which answers some criticisms Miss Murray shows conclusively that many of Froebel's critics have never taken the trouble to master all his works and so take him " as a whole ". She proves by careful reference to the text that Froebel is by no means guilty of the accusation of making the educator's work merely passive. " Leidend " is not to be translated " passive " but rather " bearing with," " having patience with," and she brings forward one quotation after another in proof of her contention. Mr. Graham Wallas's objections are well dealt with, but it does not seem as though Prof. Adams's objection to the plant theory is quite so well handled. To the ordinary reader the book with its perpetual quotations may conceivably seem dull, but both to'the students of Froebel and those of Modern Psychology the book will appeal, for incidentally Miss Murray has given us a most useful summary of some of the most important developments of our modern psychology, but in such a way that the reader is bound to go to the sources themselves, if not already well- known. There is one curious omission in a book published at this date, i.e. there is no mention of Dr. Montessori, as one of Froebel's greatest</page><page sequence="3">266 NEW BOOKS. successors. Possibly the author felt that to add another chapter in proof of the likeness between the two leaders would contribute too much to the bulk of the volume. It is (uite evident that to her Froebel still reigns in the kingdom of childhood. We cannot close this convincing little book without a feeling or gratitude to the author who has done for us what we are all either too lazy or too busy to do for ourselves. She has gone straight to the original works, not only to a selected few, but to all, and with great patience has disinterred from what must be admitted is often vague and obscure, the very kernel of Froebel's teaching. This could never have been done had not our modern teachers shown the way, but with their lights to guide her, Miss Murray has certainly succeeded in giving us an interpretation of Froebel which will make us realise his greatness, and acknowledge ourselves, with a surer faith than ever before, his followers. ALICE WOODS. Berkeley and Percival. By BENJAMIN RAND. Cainbridge University Press, 1914. Pp. x, 302. Dr. Rand is rapidly laying under a heavy obligation all who are interested -and who is not ?-in the early eighteenth century. He recently dis- covered and published Shaftesbury's Philosophical Regimen and Second Characters; and in this volume he has edited the correspondence of Berkeley and Sir John Percival, afterwards first Earl of Egmont. All the letters here printed are in a manuscript collection in the possession of the present 'Earl of Egmont. Some use was made of them by Fraser and Lorenz, but this is the first edition to give them in their enitirety. The excellence of Dr. Rand's editorial and bibliographical work is so well known that it is almost unnecessary to say that he has discharged his task with skill and care. To the letters he has prefixed a " Bio- graphical Commentary," which is, for the most part, a paraphrase of the letters. From 1709 till 1733, the period in which nearly all the events of Berkeley's life occurred, the letters form an almost complete history, and very few lacuqnce require to be filled in. In this Commentary I have noticed only one serious error. WTith regard to the letter of March 1, 1710, Dr. Rand says, " In the same letter Berkeley also states that he had written to Samuel Clarke (1675-1729) to favour him with his thoughts on the subject of God's existence ". Now a little examination shows, I think, that this letter does not refer to Samuel Clarke. The passage runs as follows: " About the same time I wrote to Mr. Clarke, and de- sired he would favour me with his thoughts on the subject of God's existence, and the proofs he thought most conclusive of it, which I imagined would prove a grateful entertainment while his sore eyes pre- vented his reading ". Now for three reasons this cannot refer to Samuel Clarke: (1) The "Mr. Clarke" of the letter is known personally to Berkeley. " I am in pain for him," he says in the same letter, " having not heard from him this long time." But at this time Berkeley did not know Samuel Clarke personally. When, later, he wished to get the opinion of Samuel Clarke on the Principles, he did not write to him direct, but sent his letter to Percival, requesting him to deliver it (letter of November 27, 1710). (2) " Mr. Clarke " is known personally to Percival. Berkeley says to Percival: " Pray, if Mr. Clarke be alive, give my humble service to him ". But at that time Percival did not know Samuel Clarke (see letter of October 30, 1710). (3) Berkeley says of "MMr. Clarke": "I am often enquired of about his character, and I would fain add the love of letters and study to the rest of his good</page><page sequence="4">NEW BOOKS. 267 qualities ". It would be absurd to say this of one of the most erudite men of the day. And it is ridiculous to think of Samuel Clarke being requested to set down his thoughts on the being of God to pass the time while his eyes were sore. Only four or five years before, his Boyle lectures on the Being and Attributes of God made him the recognised authority on the subject. For all these reasons, the " Mr. Clarke" of the letter cannot be Samuel Clarke. Who then is " Mr. Clarke "? Possibly he is the same as the Mr. Clarke who is frequently mentioned in the letters, e.g. pages 64, 79, 98, 104, 106, 125, and who is shown by them to have been a friend of Berkeley and an initimate friend of Percival. He was probably no great authority on the being of God, but the form of Berkeley's re- quest seems to indicate that it was addressed to a man who was not an authority. And Berkeley's other letters at the time show that he was rather fond of interrogating the " plain man " on philosophic questions. But perhaps "Mr. Clarke" is some person of whom nothing else is known. Campbell Fraser's error in attributing to Berkeley a letter sianed George Berkeley, which Lorenz proved was written before Berkeley was born, should make us chary of inferring identity of indi- vidual from similarity of name. Two smiall points before we pass from the Commentary. Dr. Rand says that the first intimation in the letters of Berkeley's Bermuda project is contained in the letter of March 4,'1723. But ther, is a refereince to it before that, in the first paragraph of the letter of December 16, 1722. Again, Dr. Rand states that before his work it had been uncertain when and where Berkeley's well-known verses on America were written. This is not so. The origin of the verses was discovered by Campbell Fraser (Works of Berkeley, iv., 365). The student of philosophy who comes to these letters expectinig fresh light on Berkeley's thought will be disappointed. Most of the pas - sages of interest in connexion with Berkeley's philosophy have already been quoted by Campbell Fraser. In any case, there are not very inany of them, because, though Percival was an excellent man, he was not, as Berkeley soon discovered, much of a philosopher. After the first few letters philosophical matters in thWe narrower sense are never raised. The chief import ince of the letters is biographical The Iact that stands out with special clearness in them is Berkeley's extraordinary persistence in any project in which he happened at the time to be interested. The letters from 1721 till 1724 throw an interesting light on Berkeley's in- genuity and practical prudenice in his endeavours to obtain the Deaneries of Dromore, Derry, and Down. He displayed even greater perseverance in forwarding his Bermuda project. It seenms possible that the nisus to this scheme proceeded from Berkeley's disgust with his lawsuit over the Dromore Deanery. On March 4, 1723, he wrote to Percival that it was about ten months since he reached his determination on the missionary project. Now that puts the decision exactly at the time when Berkeley became immersed in his lawsuit, when in utter disgust he wrote, " God preserve your Lordship from law and lawyers " (April 14, 1722). Considered simply as letters, this correspondence is not in the first rank. In Berkeley's earlier letters, which are by far the most pleasing, he makes interesting remarks on many prominent men of the day Addison, Swift, Steele, Pope, Sacheverell, Arbuthnot, Whiston and many others. But somehow Berkeley did not have the qualities of the great letter-writer. Perhaps he was not sufficiently detached. His interest was always concentrated on some one scheme, and the great letter-writer must always be somethitng of a dilettante. Berkeley's. letters are rarely dull, but they cannot compare with those of Swift, of Cowper at Olney, Gray at Cambridge, or Fitzgerald at Woodbridge. G. A. JOHNSTON.</page><page sequence="5">268 NEW BOOKS. The Psychology of Revolution. By GUSTAVE LE BON. Translated by BERNARD MIALL. London: T. Fisher Unwin. Demy 8vo. Price, 10s. 6d. net. In this book, M. Le Bon, fresh from his study of the psychology of the Crowd-Mind, proceeds to apply his conclusions to the interpretation of the causes, course and significance of the French Revolution. The results are at once interesting and disappointing. The author's appli- cation of his doctrines to the history of that remarkable time is very interesting; but I am inclined to think that they do not materially alter one's opinions of the forces which controlled the conduct of the actors or shaped the course of events in tile drama. M. Le Bon's main contention is that history has failed to comprehend these matters, because it has insisted on regarding the ideals and beliefs of the time as based on rational grounds. He recognises that ideals and beliefs, religious, mystical and political, have always been the miain- springs of great historical movemenlts, and that to explain the move- ments, it is necessary to explain the origin of the beliefs. So long as psychology or history will regard these beliefs as voluntary or rational, he asserts, they will remain inexplicable: for it is not "the rational logic which conditions thought " that generates them. However, once in existence they infect the 'crowd' of iildividuals who compose the State: and spreading by the psychological "laws" which M. Le Bon has formulated in his work on Crowd Psychology they produce such revoluitionary movements as the Reformation or the French Revolution itself. But these movements, as M. Le Bon himself remarks (p. 29), " have usually commenced from the top, not from the bottom ": and whatever sort of logical bases tho ideals of Luther or Calvin may have had, I should have thought that those of Montesquieu, Voltaire, Turgot, Condorcet, Rousseau were pre-eminently 'rational'. The 'Sansculottes' may not have been rational, either in thought or action: but the ideals of their leaders (andileaders, as M. Le Bon affirms, are absolutely necessary for Crowd-action) had originally been formed by very logical deductions from abstractedly rational premisses. M. Le Bon's analysis of the psychology of the various Revolutionary Asseinblies and their leaders is extremely interesting, and succinctly summarises a great many important truths about their actions,-truths which political prejudices still existing often tend to obscure. But here, again, I am rather inclined to question the novelty of his conclusions. His description of the "Jacobin Mentality," for example (chap. ii.) seems to nme to reduce itself ultimately to the statement that the Jacobins were fanatics of the first water: and political fanaticism does not differ very markedly from religious fanaticism at any time. The really valuable point which M. Le Bon establishes seems to me to be the fact that political. assemblies are simply Crowds, -of a special kind: but subject to exactly the same psychological processes and pre- senting exactly the same psychological phenomena as the fortuitous collection of individuals that ma1ke up a mob. The passion of Fear, so potent in crowds, was undoubtedly the master-motive which dictated the conduct of the Constituent and Legislative Assemblies, and of the Convention. In a very interesting chapter, M. Le Bon discusses the results of democratic evolution, and the modern political psychology of France. If his conclusions are true, the fiery trial through which the Third Republic is passing to-day, may well be its salvation: but the deeds and conduct of the French nation during the last months of 1914 suggest that the colours of the picture are unnecessarily dark.</page><page sequence="6">NEW BOOKS. 269 The translator's work would have been more effective if it had not. been so literal. Some of the sentences in the book are certainly not English (e.g. p. 55, last line; p. 70, line 10; p. 73, line 16, where the English word 'momentarily' is actually a mistranslation; p. 128, line. 28; p. 140, line 18, where the sentence has no meaning at all to the English mind). J. W. William James and Henri Bergson: A Study in Contrasting Theories of" Life. By HORACE MEYEPR KALLEN, Ph.D., of the University of Wisconsin. The University of Chicago Press. The intellectual sympathy between Prof. James and M. Bergson, felt and acknowledged by both, was not, as generally supposed, due to an agreement between the two philosophers in their attitude toward the great problems. On the contrary they offer us and represent contrasting theories of life. This is Dr. Kallen's thesis which he defends with great zeal. He seems particularly anxious to show that the attraction which, James felt for Bergson's philosophy was not for that philosophy as a whole, nor for any of its distinctive doctrines, but only for the com- paratively unimportant negative feature of it, its critique of intellectual- ism. With Dr. Kallen it is a case of " Jacob have I loved, and Esau have I hated". The contrast is complete. Bergson is monist, James is pluralist. Bergson belongs to the philosophic tradition, he carries on the' line of the great system makers, his system is so logical and com- plete that it is difficult to state one of his opinions without becoming involved in a restatement of the whole system. James on the other hand is myriad-minded and empirical, looking forward to the future,, alert to the unique, the individual, the important. It is apparentlyw nothing to the point that this view of the relation of the two philo- sophers is inconsistent with the expressed declarations of both, that Bergson has described his philosophy as reversihg the Platonic tradition, and that James has spoken of himself as sitting at the feet of Bergson. What then is the 'ground of this extraordinary valuation of the two philosophies? It is a long-drawn argument, but it rests, as it seems to us, exclusively on the posthumous work of James, Essays in Radical Jimpirticism. At any rate without it the argument would be pointless. Some of these essays are among the best of James's writings, though they belong to very varied periods; they strike, however, the sympathetic note between Dr. Kallen and his master. Radical empiricism 'seems to D.. Kallen to point the way to New Realism, and New Realism is the philosophy of the future. The argument is singularly unconvincing, even on its own premnisses, less perhaps in its appreciation of James than. in its travesty of Bergson. It would be easy enough to make out a case for the exactly opposite contention, namely, that it is Bergson, not James, whio is pointing to a New Realism. But the misconception which regards Bergson's philosophy as a system is inexcusable. It is no doubt due to a failure to appreciate that view of a problem which Bergson, expresses by the term globale. No philosophical problem can be isolated,, its significance lies in its relation to the whole problem of life and know- ledge. To have philosophic vision, to see everything globalement, is not to be a system builder. Dr. Kallen's book is enjoyable reading, notwithstanding, perhaps partly on account of, its queer and remarkable terminology. The reader will learn much about "desiderates " and will be made acquainted with "prospective ultimacies" and " utter and transitive nextness," and ani uncanny thino called " a tychistic universe".

Mr. Shebbeare's lucid and attractively written book will help to imbue theologians who read it with a sense of the extreme value, of sound philosophic training for their special work. " The fault, surely, of much recent theology," he remarks, " is that its writers are devoid of intel- lectual hope. They do not expect more light upon the mystery of the divine nature: there is no evidence that they even wish for it." Against this Mr. Shebbeare argues capably that a theology which declines to Think out and through its problems must sink into mythology, though his book in great part is devoted to a competent and discriminating ex- position of Ritschlian method. He approaches Ritschl by way of Kant, on whom he has something fresh to say from an unusual standpoint, claiming, for - instance, that Kant has strengthened the case of the preacher " by describing moral consciousness in a way which may be seen -to be correct by those who possess it ". Indeed, he goes so far as to identify evangelical "faith" with the Kantian "good will," but here the argument is too brief to prove more than analogy. He agrees with Ritschl in basing religious belief on moral insight and historic fact, as -also in 'denying that theology can be studied to purpose in a spirit of entire detachment. He rightly dissents, however, from Ritschl's thorough dislike of metaphysics ; the doctrine of God, for any thinker, must pass into a theory of the uiiiverse. The argument from Design can be restated, and he ably restates an oesthetic form of it, but without raising the vital question whether the notion of Deity it may indicate would in the least satisfy the religious consciousness. In the next chapter it is rather unconvincingly urged that if conscious life has supreme value and matter is good, optimism demands the resurrection of sensible body as well as soul. Acute but unduly short notes are given on idealism as well as on the theory of knowledge involved in a fully equipped theology. rTlbese are the chief points of specifically philosophic interest, but the volume as a whole is delightfully and freshly relevant to the modern mind and will do real service in disseminating good philo- sophy in religious circles. Cheerfulness keeps breakinig in as with Dr. Johnson's friend who tried to be a philosopher; Mr. Shebbeare's com- ment on one aspect of Tractarian thought being that " God, Man, and the Universe,-rather than the special claims of the Church of England, -are, after all, the central subjects of theological inquiry ". H. R. MACKINTOSH. Konnen wir noch Christen sein ? Von RUDOLF EUCKEN. Leipzig: Ver- lag von Veit &amp; Co, 1911. Pp. 236. Price, M. 3.60. Eucken's question is, Can we still be Christians? His answer is that we can, and indeed must, but only on condition that Christianity is 're- novated,' i.e., emancipated from the fixed and rigid forms of creed and ,dogma on which the historical Churches insist, and brought into harmony with the thought and feeling of modern men. This reform of Christianity is, according to him, the task of the present age (p. 236). The book is written with unmistakable sincerity, and it hardly needed the assurances of the Preface to tell the reader that the problem which Eucken voices with all his eloquence, is one which he has deeply felt -within himself. It is the problem of the genuinely religious maii who is</page><page sequence="8">NEW BOOKS. 271 both attracted and repelled by Christianity in its present forms. The religious temper of Eucken's philosophy is, of course, obvious from all his writings. And in this book, too, the general need for religion in human life is deduced from the principle that there canl be no getnuine ' Geistesleben' which has not in it one element of religion (p. 122), a sense of the divine, acting within man and liftinig him on to a higher plane of life. In turni, all genuine religion is, in its essence, a form of ' Geistesleben ' ina this seilse, and Christianlity, like all higher religions, is a ' Geistes-religion' (p. 160). The questioni, then, is not whether the modern miind does or does not need religion, but whether it can accept Christianity in its traditional forms. The crucial poillt, I gather, is for Eucken the Christiani doctrine that in Christ, God took on human form and died for the sins of the world (pp. 184 ff.). He pays a tribute to the 'iron logic' with which Christian dogma has developed this central thesis, through the conceptions of sacri- fice and atonement, of Christ as the mediator between God and man, of the virgin-birth and the ascension, eveti of the descent into Hell. In short, the whole second article of the creed is in question. The problem is to distiniguish here between 'the permanent content of truth and its transitory formnulation' (p. 192). But Eucken explicitly decliiies to undertake this task. All we can gather is that this second reformation of Christianity for which he calls will discard all miraculous events, and revise the position of Christ. We shall do without the 'anthropomorphic' conception of God's wrath appeased by the blood of His -son. Christ will no longer be the only and necessary mediator between man and God. His life will no longer be the one exceptional event in history charged with metaphysical significance, the one entry of God into the world, the single source to us of divine grace and salvation. Christ will still be a most exceptional man, a pre-eminent leader, a religious genius, but he will take his place amongf the small band of similarly 'creative person- alities' (p. 193) to whom we owe the uplift to fresh levels of 'Geistes- leben'. The main thing, then, for Eucken is to eliminate the exceptional significance of Christ's life as an historical event, and of Christ's function as the only mediator. Instead, he thinks, ' religious conviction forces us to demand an immediate contact of human and divine throughout the whole breadth of spiritual life' (p. 186), and therefore a direct inter- fcourse between the soul and God, in the spirit of St. Augustin's: 'God and the soul would I know.-Nothing more ?-Nothino more' (p. 191). The Christianity of the future will retain the form of a Church, of a religious community (pp. 136, 137), but Eucken despairs of the possi- bility of reform from within any of the existing Churches, Catholic or Protestant. Apparently, then, we must look to a movement outside the Churches to bring about the reformation which is to give us the Christian Church of the future. Is this perhaps one of the reasons why Eucken appeals specially to Nonconformists ? The strenAth of Eucken's book is that it puts into eloquent words what many men and women feel who are not irreligious and yet are kept by conscientious objections from joining in the worship of the Churches. Its weakness is that of Eucken's whole philosophy, viz., that he calls for a new form of ' Geistesleben' which he cannot positively define to us. He is at best a forerunner, preparing the way for the coming of the spiritual leader who is to make all things new. At any rate, Eucken himself hqs shown so far no signs of becoming the Luther of a New Reformation. R. F. A. H.</page><page sequence="9">272 NEW BOOKS. Zuwn geyenw6trtigen Stand der Erkenntnistheorie (Zugleich Versuch einer Einteilung der Erkenntnistheorien). By THEODOR ZIE:EN. Wiesbaden: Verlag von J. F. Bergmann, 1914. Pp. 73. Price,. M. 2.80. This pamphlet gives a useful resuineof the same author's larger Erkenntnis Theorie, which was published last year. He starts from the Dualism of mind and matter, the psychical and the physical, as we find it presupposed by Psychology on the one side and Physical Science on the other. His, first point is that this Dualism is unstable. For Physical Science there is an almost irresistible tendency to treat the psychical side as epi- phenomenal; for those who begin from the psychical side there is the corresponding tendency to absorb the physical as 'object' or 'content' into the psychical. The burden of the author's criticism of all other- epistemological theories is that, in one way or another, they have been wrecked on the rock of this Dualism. His own theory-named in- elegantly 'Binomismus '-is that the distinction of physical and psychi- cal is neither original nor ultimate. Mind and matter are not two substances of which the world is, in last analysis, made up; nor can either be reduced to the other. Both are, as it were, groupings or orders of somethinm more fundamental, which is neither psychical nor physical, and therefore neutral. In this point, then, the theory is, as the author acknowledges (p. 72), monistic. But the neutral datum ex- hibits a twofold structure or order or law-' eine zweifache Gesetzmas- sigkeit,' hence 'Binomismus'. The one order, of which the principle is 'Kausalgesetzlichkeit,' is that of phenomena in physical nature. The other order, the principle of which the author calls (for reasons which are somewhat obscure) 'Parallelgesetzlichkeit,' is that of phenomena in a psychical context-the grouping which is found in a 'mind,' as Psy- chology studies it, and which is there dependent on such factors as the state of the sense-organs, the direction of attention, the nexus of as- sociations, etc. But the order of 'matter' and that of ' mind,' whilst dliffering in their 'law,' are both made up, in last analysis, of the sam- elements which the author calls 'das Gegebene,' or preferably 'Gigno mena '. These 'Gignomena' may be exhaustively classified as Sensations and Ideas ('Empfindungsoignomena' and ' Vorstellungsgignomena '), the latter term to cover judgments and volitions. Feelings are, somewhat cavalierly, asserted to be provided for in this classification through the fact that they are only found attached to these two kinds of gignomena. Reality is held to be identical with the totality of these gignomena, and: in thus rejecting a transcendent ' thing-in-itself,' the author declares his view to be both 'immanent' and ' positivist'. Lastly, in that Sensations are held to be prior in time to Ideas, the theory is characterised as ' prot- esthetic,' but in that the Ideas do not merely reproduce, but elaborate and interpret, the Sensations the theory is 'transformistic'. The busi- ness of 'Erkenntnistheorie' is thus to start from the totality of gigno- mena, classify them, trace their transformations, and formulate the laws of the groupings and orders which they develop. It is thus co-extensive- with Philosophy; it gives us a 'Weltbegriff'. The task which the author here assigns to 'Erkenntnistheorie,' viz., to give us a Theory of Reality, is obviously identical with that usually- assigned to Metaphysics. The author's polemics against Metaphysics are, therefore, beside the point. Moreover, they recoil on his own head. Metaphysicians, he complains, work with arbitrary hypotheses and a priori assumptions, whereas he stands on the sound basis of 'fact' and' ' experience'. A little self-criticism should have convinced the author that an appeal to fact and experience is only a cloak for the most in- sidious form of dogmatism. A statement. abaut what is 'given,' is always</page><page sequence="10">NEW BOQKS. 273 a theory, and one that is generally full of hidden and arbitrary assump- tions. So in this case. In talking of his ' gignomena,' the author takes for granted at the very start that they form a totality, that they consist only of sensations and ideas, that the latter have their sole source in the former, that time is the form of existence of these gignomena, etc., etc. All these statements are highly debatable, and I know of no ' experience' (as opposed to theory) by appeal to which they could be settled. Again, though the gignomena are supposed to be neutral as regards the dis- tinction of physical and psychical, the very terms 'Empfindung' and 'Vorstellung' inevitably import a psychical character. It would have been well if the author had learned a little more from the logic of some of the metaphysicians whom he criticises. R. F.

The first of a projected series of investigations into memory in the strict sense, as distinguished from memory in general. The present work is an analysis of the state of consciousness which constitutes remembering, leaving the later numbers to deal with the " kinds, forms and conditions" of tho process. It contains much valuablelcritical matter and as a positive analysis is also notable and is decidedly worth study. The most important part is the last which deals with the act of remembering (Erinnern) itself. The writer maintains vigorously the " actuality " view, according to which remembering is a direct occupation of the point of view of the past ex- perience, an act by which we put ourselves directly into our own past (p. 133). With this goes the important remark that we are aware in the present of the past as past, and that to be aware of something at the, present is not the same thing as to be aware of it as present (p. 92). The actuality view is contrasted with the representational view (Vorstellungs- ansicht) which declares -that when I remember my past experience this experience is before my mind in idea; and there is good and pertinent- criticism of the various shapes which this doctrine assumes, all of themt implying that my memory refers to something else which is not directly apprehended. There is useful handling of the recent German literature of the subject. When the writer treats of the object of memory, he in- sists that the object itself need not be past (e.g. when I remember that I am to go to a meetingf this evening, where the object is even future). It is only the ex2perience (Erlebniss) which is presented as past. But if the object is stated fully, can the time reference be omitted ? I remember reading Paradise Lost for the first time at school. The poem is not in the past, but the object remembered includes the circumstances of read- ing it. The writer of course sees this, but maintains the distinction of the object from the experience of it (Erlebniss). But is not this to desert the strictly descriptive point of view ? For what was experienced was not the object apart from the circumstances under which it was ex- perienced, but as it was experienced. If I see an object, what I see is how the object looks, not the object as a whole. So when I recall a past experience, that which I experienced, it would seem, must have its past date, though the 'thing' to which it belongs may not be confined to the past. S. A. Die Denkfunktion der Verneinung, eine kritische Untersuchung. Von Dr. NIcOLAUS PETRESCU. Teubner, 1914. Pp. viii, 81. Starting with " Function" as the most comprehensive description of thought, the author tries to co-ordinate the various problems in connexion 18</page><page sequence="11">274 NEW BOOKS. with negation by working from its different mneanings with reference to that function. Thought as functional involves (1) psychological phe- nomena, (2) logical forms, (3) metaphysical conditions, and the difficulties with regard to negation have arisen from a confusion of these different standpoints. In accordance with these the solutions of the main prob- lem, that of the relation of negation to affirmation, varies. Psychologi- cally, Dr. Petrescu finds that negation is the primitive type of judgment, as can be seen in our attitude to an object that is new to ins. Our first conscious act is to set it over against the self, and only secondarily do we identify the two in knowledge. For logic, on the other hand, which the author regards as formal, affirmation and negation are correlative. Sig- wart's argument for the primacy of affirmation trenches on metaphysics, while Lotze, who accepts the correlation, by bringing in the question of the validity of the relation between S and P in the two types, goes out- side of the limits of logic. The treatment of the metaphysical question is the fullest. Here the priority is assigned to negation, which is found to be dominant in the impulse to speculation, its dialectical procedure, and its resultant valuations. In contrast, the special sciences aim rather at affirming, and are condemned to finitude and externality. (In fact, as we might put it, "All affirmation is privation".) Whereas, with meta- physics the method is itself the result and the object. Negation, then, is a product of pure thought, but is not itself a function, not a constructive category. Thus Hegel was wrong in tryingfo to apply the dialectical method of metaphysics to the empirical world. Negation is " ideal," and cannot be equated to any " real " opposition or distinction among objects. There is in this connexion an interesting criticism of the treatment by Kant and by Bergson of the notion of " nothing ". The bearing of this position on the question of Infinity tends to sug- gest an alternative solution to those which attempt to find for the term a positive signification, e.g. the various metaphors and analogies in con- nexion with the phrase " concrete universal ". Why not rather insist on the characteristically negative nature of metaphysical or dialectical think- ing'? The auithor's argument, however, is suggestive rather than full. The notion of " function " itself remains vague, and in fact at the one place where its applicability to thought is discussed is dismissed along with "spontaneity" and "activity " in favour of " movement ". The only form of judgment considered is thc categorical, qnd that throughout as the connexion or differentiation of two notions. The relevance of this analysis in the psychological argument is not made clear. On the other hand this does no harm in the second section, with its strict view of logic. W. ANDERSON. Die Psychologie und ihre zentrale Stellung in der Philosophie, eine Ein- fidhrung i,n die wissenschaftliche Philosophie. By JOSEF EISENMEIER. Halle, Max Niemeyer, 1914. Pp. viii., 111. In spite of a rather dogmatic and over-confident mode of statement, this is a clearly and vigorously written little book. Its contention is that psychology is the central discipline for the whole of philosophy, because " all philosophy is either psychology outright or intimately connected with psychological research," and rests entirely upon it (p. 105). This the author endeavours to prove by examining the philosophic sciences seriatim, and by tracing the scientific backwardness of philosophy to its neglect of psychology. Psychology is an empirical science, though it has not yet succeeded in subjecting many psychic facts to experiment; but it must not be separated from philosophy. In consequence of this attitude</page><page sequence="12">NEW BOOKS. 275 towards psychology he repudiates 'disinterested' knowing, denies that a purely theoretic science exists (p. 30), makes their practical application a test of the value of cognitions, and declares that "the much-abused practical interests are the most powerful impulse to research, and its most attractive aim " (p. 29). In short he is brought very near to pragmatism. Nevertheless he departs from it again by not consistently using 'practical' in the wide pragmatic sense in which every object of interest is 'useful,' by uncritically making all 'genuine knowledge' rest on self-evidence, and by taking far too formal a view of logic. That he should not have perceived the need for testing the experience of self- evidence, and inquired how sane and useful is to be discriminated from insane and harmful 'self-evidence,' is the more curious because he sees quite clearly that the practical application of a principle is a real test of its truth (pp. 90-91). F. -0. S. SCEILLER. Wissenschaft und Methode. By H. POINCARE. Authorised German translation by F. and L. LINDEMANN. Teubner. Pp. vi, 283. This is an excellent translation of Poincar6's well-known book into Ger- man. It appears in the ' Wissenschaft und Hypothese' series, which began with a translation of his Science et l'Hypothese. In some ways this edition is better than the original French one, for it is provided with copious explanatory notes and references to other literature on the subjects treated. The name of F. Lindemann is a guarantee of the accuracy of these notes, so far as they deal with mathematical subjects, as they mostly do. C. D. B. Orthopddische Behandlung deq Nervenkrankheiten. Von Prof. Dr. K. BIESALSKI, Direktor und leitender Arzt der Berlin-Brandenbur- gischen Kriippelheil- und Erziehungs-anstalt, mit 162 Figuren im Text. Jena: Verlag von Gustav Fischer, 1914. Pp. 166. This small volume is a section of a larger text-book of orthopeodics. The author rightly claims that, by bringing together in a single volume all nervous diseases so far as they are capable of orthopadic treatment, it avoids the specialist's danger of dealing only with symptoms. The volume is es.entially a medical treatise; but it has a double interest for the student of mental processes: first, it contains a good summary, with excellent diagrams, of the elehieuts of the nervous system; second, it shows, indirectly, how subtly involved the forms of paralysis are. Even in the peculiar contractures of hysteria and the muscular habits induced by them, various forms of orthopaedic apparatus give good results. lRe- cently we have had such a flood of " mental " methods of treatment that we are apt to forget how much " mind " is embodied in the physical ap- pliances here involved and in the physical methods of treatment. Whether we are "animists" or "parallelists," whether we regard writer's cramp as a mental or a physical condition or both, we have to recognise the curative value of change of pen and a,tered shape of penholder.

Zermelo is mentioned with praise as having devised a method for separating legitimate from illegitimate classes. Such methods are not uncommon among mathema- ticians, and seemn to be prompted by a strange fear of philosophy and logic. The case is exactly analogous to the action of a keeper of what he thought was a china shop, when a bull, entered it. His practice was simply to deny that that part of the shop where the bull was destroying things was a china shop, and to assert that it was a drapery establishment. Unfortunately it was by no means certain that the bull would confine his. attentions to the drapery establishment. P. E. B. JOURDAIN.
