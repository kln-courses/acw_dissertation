<plain_text><page sequence="1">EGYPTIAN FAIENCE AMULETS IN THE MUSEUM OF APPLIED ARTS AND SCIENCES (POWERHOUSE MUSEUM) IN SYDNEY* Paul Donnelly The Powerhouse Museum is Australia's largest museum with a diverse collection that has grown consistently since its inception over 100 years ago. The Museum was established after the huge success of the Sydney International Exhibition of 1879, a mammoth event which ably demonstrated the benefits of public display of technology, and led to the establishment of a number of public institutions in Sydney. Initially known as the Technological Museum, the collection moved from a temporary structure in Sydney's Domain to a purpose-made building at Ultimo in 1893. It evolved through various name changes to become eventually the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences, a name reflecting the expanded range of collection fields that had become its focus.1 Philosophically the muséum has long embraced a wide range of material that demonstrates human endeavour and creativity, both at a local and at an international level. Curators and collection policies early on recognized the futility of imposing a cut-off date for the collection, and antiquities were, and still are, frequently acquired as examples of both technological and artistic development. For over a century the museum's accession books have swelled with private and institutional donations as well as purchases of material from all over the world, with a bias towards the Mediterranean region. * I thank the Trustees of the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences for permission to publish this material. The bulk of the research for this catalogue was conducted for my BA Honours thesis which I submitted in 1988 to the Department of Archaeology at the University of Sydney. It was my initial contact with the museum, and it is with much pleasure that I now publish this up-dated version as a curator of decorative arts and design at the same institution. My thanks go to Dr Lisa Giddy, my supervisor at the time, who suggested the topic; the late Bill Roberts who as Assistant Registrar supervised daily access to the collection; Dr Tiffany Urwin for editorial suggestions and encouragement; Linda Sullivan for re-typing the original text; Amanda Donnelly for support and encouragement; Dr Stephen Bourke, University of Sydney Research Fellow, for support; finally, Vanessa Mack, Director of the Macleay Museum at the University of Sydney and at the time of my thesis Senior Registrar at the Museum of Applied Arts, for support, example, and inspiration during and since the project. For whatever errors remain, I naturally take full responsibility. All drawings are by the author and are at the scale of 1:1.

Donnelly A number of small collections acquired this century either consisted entirely of, or contained ancient Egyptian amulets. The pieces presented in the following catalogue come from five different sources which are reflected in their accession numbers. They are without exception unprovenanced, but certain remarks can nevertheless be made about them as a group: they are in the main depictions of deities (such as Nefertem) or aspects of deities (such as the Wedjat or eye of Horus), they are without exception of glazed composition (also known as faience), and they are rarely complete. As a whole they are the types of amulets that could have been used by the living and eventually, as suggested by their survival today, for protection of the mummy after death. The amulets date largely from the Late Period, and even as a random sample reflect the burgeoning use of amulets documented in the period after 664 bc. The 28 amulets described represent the following deities or symbols (in alphabetical order): Anubis (8), Apis Bull (22), Bes (1-3), composite amulet (Hathor) (27), Harpocrates (12), Horus hawk (23-24), Isis with child Horus (13-15), Lion (25-6), Nefertem (16), Ptah Seker (17-20), Sekhmet (9-10), Serapis (21), Taweret (4—7), Wedjat-eye (11), Uncertain (Thoth?) (28). They are subdivided into four groups: animal-headed gods (1-10), human headed gods (11-21), animal deities (22-6), and composite amulets or amulets of uncertain subject-matter (27-8). ANIMAL-HEADED GODS BES Though not a truè god, and with no temples of worship, Bes (together with Taweret) was an extremely popular household deity. He was mainly a protector of women, and most especially of children. This is well displayed in the cemetery at Matmar of the XXII-XXVth Dynasties where 94% of children's burials contained Bes amulets, as compared to 6% of women's burials.2 It is speculated that the origins of Bes are not Egyptian—an idea supported by the unusual convention of two-dimensional depiction en face? 1 (Mus. no. 194a).

TAWERET Like her 'partner' Bes, Taweret's ferocious appearance belies her purely beneficent role as protector of women—primarily in childbirth. For such a beneficent god, her hippopotamus body is unusual due to the malevolent association with Seth. This potentially negative connection is undermined in the mythology—where Tawaret deserted her concubine Seth in favour of Horus in the dispute over the Egyptian throne.4 4 (Mus. no. 196a). Faience.

ANUBIS The god of the dead and of embalming with the epithets 'Lord of the Hallowed Land', i.e. the necropolis, and 'He who is before the Divine Booth', in which mummification took place.6 It is uncertain whether the form he took was a dog or a jackal. (The latter is usually preferred.) He was often depicted as a recumbent jackal guarding the mummy from evil forces. During the embalming process, a priest as the representative of Anubis wore a jackal mask. According to some legends he was the son of Nephthys and Osiris, who mistook that goddess for Isis.7 Other legends refer to him as the son of Re. The belief in him leading the mummy into the presence of Osiris survived into Christian times. An example of this is a faience plaque in the British Museum (22874) where a jackal-headed Anubis is depicted standing next to a bier. On the reverse is a Coptic inscription, 'May she hasten to arise'. V 5 In 1988,1 wrote to Mr R. D. Sansom of New Zealand from whom the museum acquired a selection of antiquities in 1975. They were accessioned as A6494, and nine of them were amulets which feature in this catalogue. He replied as follows: Ί collected all except one of these in Cairo whilst on R &amp; R leave there during the war, in 1943. They were obtained from a dealer, who informed me that they had been found in tombs in Memphis or Saqqara (I visited many sites there with him on one occasion), I think it was probably correct'. 6 Lurker (1980) 28. 7 Budge (1925) 279. 8 Ibid. 280.</page><page sequence="6">80 P. Donnelly 8 (Mus. no. A4538-1). Faience, mottled effect, uneven surface. Green (5G 5/4) with bluish mottles. H. 9.3 cm; W. 4.5 cm; D. 1.7 cm. Provenance unknown. Date of acquisition: 1955. Complete. Very angular, simple incised details. Very similar in style (and probably provenance) to 5 and 22 with which it was acquired by the museum. Back pillar. No exact parallels of same deity, but stylistically, see 5. On back pillar: J.-L. Chappaz, Les figurines funéraires égyptiennes du Musée d'Art et d'Histoire à Genève et de quelques collections privées (1984) 9. From XXVIth Dynasty, back pillars were common on shabtis, as they were on amulets.9 Date: Saite (XXVIth Dynasty). SEKHMET Her name means 'the mighty one', and she was the goddess of war. Somewhat paradoxically she was also reputed to be 'great of magic' whose knowledge is associated with healing.10 It was probably this last aspect which explains the use of her form as an amulet. Sekhmet was the second deity of the triad of Memphis, the other two being her husband Ptah and her son Nefertem.11 She spread terror wherever she went, piercing hearts with her arrows, a fiery glow emanating from her body. Sekhmet was depicted as a lioness or as a woman with a lion's head. In some representations Sekhmet is hard to differentiate from Bastet.12 A case in hand displaying this difficulty is 10. Bastet was first regarded as the mother of the savage-faced lion god Miysis. With the Middle Kingdom the cat appeared as Bastet's sacred animal, and it was not until the New Kingdom that she was depicted with the cat's head. By this stage she was the friendly opposite of the destructive Sekhmet to whom her earlier savage aspect had been transferred. 9 (Mus. no. A6494-9). Faience, even finish.

Date: XVIIIth-XXXth Dynasty. HUMAN-HEADED GODS WEDJAT-EYE The left eye of Horus restored by Thoth was a popular symbol of protection in many forms.15 Together with the right eye they represented the sun and the moon.16 As the moon waned, it represented the ailing eye of Horus. In relation to the sun it was a symbol of the power of the god of light.18 The wedjat-eye was also used as protection against the evil eye.19 11 (Mus. no. A6494-19). Faience, details painted in (faded) black with (ostrich) eggshell inlaid for white of the eye. Glaze light blue (5BG 7/2); black details (5P 5/1); eggshell buff (2.5Y 8/4).

Cp. for dating: Petrie (1914) no. 141c, gr. fa. very similar shape, note high rounded top of lid and double striation of cosmetic stripe. Though dated because of added gods to XXIIIrd Dynasty, still relevant. Lucas (1962) 29, notes that ostrich was fairly common until very late in both eastern and western deserts. Up to XVIIIth Dynasty, it was found as far north as Heliopolis: an inscription on a fan of Tutankhamun mentions this. Resin used to fix inlay was often tinted to same colour as inlaid piece.2 It is probable that the shell of our piece has faded and that the fixing agent has kept its colour. For (undated) examples of wedjats with inlay, see G. A. Reisner, Amulets (1907) 75 (eye with traces of 'reddish plaster' [sî'c] with which setting was fastened). Date: Third Intermediate Period (XXIIIrd Dynasty). HARPOCRATES A form of Horus depicted with a young boy's head, i.e. a side lock and his finger in his mouth. In Graeco-Roman times he was a popular deity represented in various ways, e.g. as sitting on a lotus flower, or on the lap of his mother Isis. He was commonly depicted on 14 Petrie (1914) 41. 15 Lurker (1980) 128. 16 Petrie (1914) 32. 17 Frankfort (1948) 28. 18 Lurker (1980) 129. 19 Ibid. 20 Lucas (1962) 8.</page><page sequence="8">82 P.

ISIS WITH CHILD HORUS Isis, daughter of Geb and Nut, married her brother Osiris.22 Her name probably meant throne, the hieroglyphic sign for which she wore on her head. She is often depicted with her sister Nephthys on the sides of coffins with their kite's wings outstretched protecting the deceased. Through protecting her son Horus (Harpocrates) from predators and other dangers she was known to be 'great of magic' and it was expected that she would protect mortal children also.23 For her son Horus, see also Harpocrates, 12. 13 (Mus. no.

Very crude workmanship, the child Horus is barely visible. Cp. for dating Giddy (1992) pi. 54 no. 78/269 which is a perfect parallel. Found in a fill context it is attributed to the Late Period Cemetery (though not associated with a specific burial), i.e. between the XXVIth Dynasty and just prior to the Ptolemaic period. Petrie (1914) no. 148 d, bl. fa., is not as crude and displays how 13 is interpreted as a degenerate-styled Isis with Horus. Petrie states that Isis on throne is common from the XXVIth Dynasty to the Roman period. The back pillar is a typically Saite feature: see 8.

Slight possibility that legs are not broken; if so must have been exposed to weathering as 'break' is very smooth. No direct parallels. Petrie (1914) 35, states that Isis on throne is dated XXVIth Dynasty to Roman. The piece provides some interesting clues regarding the manufacturing process. The glaze is mainly on the high-points—not on the low such as the gap between the arms and body—and is also very thin, implying that it was made by means of the efflorescence method (the glaze migrating from within the core to the surface as salts rather than the more common method of dipping before firing). The way the preserved arm joins the body and the clean break of the missing arm both suggest that the arms were made separately and attached to the body before firing. Date: Saite (XXVIth Dynasty) to Roman. NEFERTEM Nefertem was the son of Ptah and Sekhmet and represented the power of the heat of the rising sun.24 His symbol was the lotus, which he wore on his head, often with the addition of two vertical plumes.25 As the lotus was a symbol of the sun, Nefertem became associated with the solar divinities and 'dwelled each day' with Re. When represented in faience he is often depicted standing on a recumbent lion, a solar animal.26 16 (Mus. no. A2612). Faience, brown staining.

Lower body missing from navel, right arm missing, chips on lotus bloom and nose. Very fine piece with well-rendered features and detail. Petrie (1914) 38, states that figures of this deity occur only in XXVIth Dynasty. The fine quality as well as the back pillar corroborate this date. Petrie (1910) fig. 118, gr. fa. head of Isis, quality and style very similar. The shabti published by J.-L. Chappaz, Les figurines funéraires égyptiennes du Musée d'Art et d'Histoire à Genève et de quelques collections privées (1984) 126, is similar with regard to facial features, style, and quality. According to Chappaz, its inscriptions date it to the XXXth Dynasty, while stylistically it belongs to the XXVIth. Dows (1930) fig. 1 is very similar and dated to the Saite-Ptolemaic period.

Donnelly PTAH SEKER Ptah-Seker was a composite god formed from Ptah, Seker, and Osiris.27 He represented Ptah's connection with the resurrection and the nether world—hence the association with the other two gods.28 Seker was the Memphite earth and mortuary deity, and through this association Ptah was connected with Osiris. He is depicted as a little squat boy30 or dwarf with bent legs and his hands on his hips. This dwarf type of figure can also be referred to as a pataikois,31 17 (Mus. no. A4538-9). Faience.

On arm is an armlet—or just stylized musculature? Similar feature on 18. The only parallels found with side lock are without context: see G. Daressy, ASAE 8, 1907, pi. 42 nos. 38.797 and 38.808. Date: Saite (XXVIth Dynasty). SERAPIS Serapis was a composite god introduced into Egypt in the Late Period under Ptolemy I. He gained great popularity, even beyond Egypt.32 He was associated with the corn supply and so wore a corn measure (modius) on his head. He assimilated the characteristics of many deities from both Egypt and Greece, namely Osiris, the Apis bull of Memphis, Zeus, Aesculapius, and Dionysus. 21 (Mus. no. A4539-2). Faience. Glaze light blue (7.5BG 7/4); core grey (10YR 7/2). H. 2.5 cm; W 1.9 cm; D. 1.3 cm. Provenance and date of acquisition unknown. Head only. Not crisp moulding, but good detail, e.g. hair forms a pattern on forehead. No parallels found, but the god was introduced by the Ptolemies. J. E. Stambaugh, Serapis under the Ptolemies (1972) 14, mentions how the god's hair forms undulant arrowpoints on head, as on this piece. Date: Ptolemaic-Roman. ANIMAL DEITIES APIS BULL Apis was the name given to the sacred bull at Memphis. He was the divine servant (not the incarnation) of the god Ptah,34 and was rarely represented anthropomorphically.

Donnelly bull chosen had to meet certain requirements, mainly in the hide's colour and markings, and only one was ever kept at a time.3 Upon his death he was buried with great ceremony in the Serapaeum at Saqqara and associated with the god Osiris: Osiris-Apis when Hellenized becomes Serapis. 22 (Mus. no. A4538-3). Faience. Glaze light blue (7.5BG 7/2); core dark brown (7.5YR 4/2). H. 1.8 cm; W. 0.8 cm; D. 1.5 cm (extant). Provenance unknown. Date of acquisition: 1955. Hindquarters missing. Very angular, incised details similar in style to 5 and 8, with which it was acquired by the museum. No parallels but, on stylistic similarities to 5 and 8, could be Saite (XXVIth Dynasty). Petrie (1914) 43, notes that the Apis bull was made as an amulet from XXVIth Dynasty to Roman. Date: Saite (XXVIth Dynasty). HORUS HAWK The hawk (falcon) was sacred to Horus and often wears either the crown of Upper or Lower Egypt, or both crowns combined.37 As the sky god in the form of the hawk, Horus was equated with the king, who in other words was a manifestation of Horus.38 Since the sun and the sky were seen as a hawk, the king, sun, and sky became identified and commonly depicted as the royal symbol of the winged disk.39 23 (Mus. no. A4538-6). Faience. Glaze emerald green in patches (2.5G 5/10); core grey (10YR 6/4). H. 1.4 cm; W. 0.6 cm; D. 1.0 cm. Provenance unknown. Date of acquisition: 1955. Chip on crown. Simply rendered, wears the Double Crown. Cp. for dating: Brunton (1948) 82 pi. 60: 3, an excellent parallel from undisturbed cemetery, confidently dated to the XXII-XXVth Dynasties. Petrie (1914) 48, notes that hawk amulets were made over a long period, prehistoric-Ptolemaic, but the colouring also indicates a date after the XVIIIth Dynasty. Date: XXIInd-XXVth Dynasties. 24 (Mus. no. A6494-8). Faience, very glossy, mottled. Glaze mixture of blue (2.5B 4/8) and green (10G 4/6); core grey (10YR 7/2). H. 3.6 cm (extant); W. 1.0 cm; D. 1.3 cm. Provenance: Saqqara or Memphis? See 7. Date of acquisition: 1975. Legs, tail, and part of suspension loop missing. Very vivid colouring. Double crown on head. Date: XVIIIth Dynasty-Ptolemaic (cp. 23). LION The lion was a solar animal, and to begin with the lion image was only equated with the sun god.40 As a solar animal it could symbolize both destruction and death at night, and rebirth in 35 Budge (1925) 282. 36 Lurker (1980) 28. 37 Budge (1925) 300. 38 Lurker (1980) 64. 39 Ibid. 40 Ibid. 77.</page><page sequence="13">Egyptian Faience Amulets 87 the morning.41 Through this solar symbolism the lion was connected with Nefertem (see 16), and was frequently depicted with two heads, and so able to follow the course of the sun.42 In addition to this the lion is a symbol of power, able to instill terror in all.43 25 (Mus. no. A4540-1). Faience, quite glossy. Glaze light brown (10YR 7/6) with some green along bottom; core grey-brown (10YR 5/4). H. 2.2 cm; W. 2.8 cm; D. 1.3 cm. Provenance and date of acquisition unknown. Complete. Well proportioned. Difficult to tell whether green colour along bottom edge is intentional or due to over-firing as glaze 'splays' out at base and makes whole object lean backwards. No good parallels could be found. Petrie (1914) 45, dates couchant lion generally from prehistoric to Ptolemaic. B. Schlick-Nolte-V. von Droste zu Hulshoff, Museen der Rhein-Main-Region (1984) features a couchant lion in the Hessisches Landesmuseum in Darmstadt (AeII,34), which is of similar style though in limestone and with its head forward; it is dated to the Ptolemaic-Roman period. 26 (Mus. no. A4540-2). Faience, rough finish. Glaze light grey (10G 9/1); core grey (2.5G 8/2). H. 1.6 cm (extant); W. 1.2 cm; D. 2.6 cm. Human figure once on back, now missing except for the remaining feet. Provenance and date of acquisition unknown. Simple but well done. The figure once on top was probably Nefertem—possibly Qadeshet. Modern glue has stained the right side of the base and right flank. Back pillar. Martin (1981) pi. 38 no. 996 (a surface find from the animal necropolis at North Saqqara dated Late Period-Ptolemaic) provides an excellent parallel. The Saite-Ptolemaic lion, Dows (1930) fig. 1, is far more detailed but shows a figure of Nefertem on top with feet in exactly the same position. If the figure on 26 was Nefertem, a date to the Saite period (XXVIth Dynasty) is probable (see 16). COMPOSITE AMULET 27 (Mus. no. A6494-38). Fired clay. Colour of body: brown (10YR 5/4). H. 3.1 cm; W. 1.6 cm; D. L0 cm. Provenance: Saqqara or Memphis? See 7. Date of acquisition: 1975. Complete. Unusual iconography on hanging pendant. Suspension hole not fully pierced through, only 4 mm deep. Appears to have traces of glaze in depressions. At first authenticity questioned, but see below. Iconography consists of the following: i. Feathered head-dress: Bes. ii. Cow ears: Hathor. iii. Uraei: Knowledge, divine life. iv. Tet Symbol: powerful protective symbol. v. Baboon face: Thoth, god of knowledge. 41 Ibid. 42 Budge (1925) 298. 43 Lurker (1980) 77.</page><page sequence="14">88 P. Donnelly The design is convincing, e.g. the tails of the uraei merging into the Tet symbol. W. M. F. Petrie, Tell el-Ajjul (1932) 14-16 pi. Ill: 27, a gold example from Tell el-cAjjul found in tomb 1514 with Late Bronze IIA and IIB pottery, including Base-Ring II. P. E. McGovern defined this ■amulet as his type I.C.3, 'Hathor head/face with flanking uraei'.44 It is the only example of this type in his whole catalogue with the distribution of 8 similar Hathor-faced amulets (without the uraei) coming from Lachish in good Late Bronze Age contexts. Two unprovenanced pendant amulets of exactly the same shape, but with different iconography, are in the Nicholson Museum at the University of Sydney (no. 62.941). One of them is 3.5 cm high and features: i. Scarab, Ra mn hgr inscribed on it; ii. Uraeus; iii. Wedjat eye. The other also has a uraeus on it. Cp. also J. Vercoutter, Les objets égyptiens et égyptisants du mobilier funéraire Carthaginois (1945) 278 pl. 24: nos. 902, 903,. who states that the shape is a common Egyptian form; his examples have rounder shoulders and are dated after 800 bc. Reisner (1958) no. 12791, bl/gr. fa., similar shape with head of Hathor flanked by 2 uraei. For examples of parts of the iconography, see the XVIIIth-Dynasty seal base in G. Brunton, Qua and Badari II (1928) pi. 57: 23, which has the same baboon-type face with 'feathered' head-dress and flanking uraei. Ibid. pi. 57: 17 a XVIIIth-Dynasty scarab base with similar features including Hathor ears. Both pieces come from dated tombs at Sedment. Petrie (1914) 21 no. 76 a and b, describes a similar form as representing a writing tablet; dated to XXVIth Dynasty and later. Date: New Kingdom-XXVIIIth Dynasty. 28 (Mus. no. A4538-4). Faience, rough finish. White-grey (2.5Y 8/2). H 1.9 cm; W. 0.6 cm; D. 0.8 cm. Complete. Provenance unknown. Date of acquisition: 1955. Extremely crude workmanship. Possible identification is Isis with child Horus, or, most likely, Thoth. Cp. for dating: Giddy (1992) pi. 50 no. 78/271, gr. fa., described as striding animal-headed deity, probably Thoth. It was found on the right wrist of a child within a cemetery accurately dated to the Late Period (just prior to the Ptolemaic). 44 Ornamental and amuletic jewelry pendants of Late Bronze Age Palestine: an archaeological study (Ph.D. thesis, University of Pennsylvania, 1980) pi. 6: 14; chart 8 on p. 86 shows the distribution of Class I Egyptian deity pendants, totalling 78 examples. Although the amulet in question is made of gold, it is sufficiently close to our piece to be considered a parallel for dating purposes.</page></plain_text>
