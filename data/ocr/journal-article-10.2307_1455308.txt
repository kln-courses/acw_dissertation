Smelik's volume on the Targum of Judges is a masterpiece. Its content is so accurately described in the dust cover as to merit citation in full: "This book forms a contribution to the vexing question of the origin and growth of the Targum to the Prophets. It provides an in-depth analysis of the Targum of Judges on the basis of new materials (unpublished manuscripts), a new tool (bilingual concordance) and a new method (analysis of consistency). A critical review of previous research concerning the Targum's origin and growth is followed by an analysis and collation of many Western manu- scripts, a systematic comparison of the Targum with the ancient translations, a study of its exegetical traditions and a thorough examination of its con- sistency. On this basis it is suggested that the Targum assumed its basic form in the second century CE, due to the emergenc[e] of the rabbinic tradition, but outside the context of the synagogue." Smelik's volume contains all that one would wish to know about the Tar- gum of Judges and other targums connected with it, and this is all clearly laid out, with the necessary cross-references. It has six parts, each called a chapter, with subsections, each (where appropriate) with a recapitulation. The first (pp. 1-112) is headed: "The present state of research reviewed." In a very orderly fashion it reviews the present state of research on many things: language (multilingual Palestine, Aramaic diglossia in Palestine, the classifi- cation of T[argum]Jon[athan]'s dialect); the Targum's setting in life (private study, school and academy, the liturgical setting, the ban on written trans- mission); the early history of TJon (overview and assessment of previous re- search; some additional notes; historical allusions in TJon; provenance; the question of an older Targum to the Prophets); Palestinian and Tosefta-targum (previous research); the character of TJon (genre, translation techniques, the theological position, anthropomorphism and anthropathism, Memra, Shek- inta, Yeqara); desiderata for future research. As to the provenance of TJon, E. Cook has convincingly demonstrated the fluid borders between Middle Aramaic dialects. The absence of any supra- local standard, he argued, deprives Tal's theory of its basis for the Western provenance of TJon. Whether he has been successful in proving the geo- graphical location of TJon's dialect (within the triangle Damascus, Edessa and Assur) is, however, still very much open to question. The old Geiger theory of a Babylonian provenance for Onkelos and TJon has not been quite</page><page sequence="2">226 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW disproven. The language of TO-TJon may have originated in Palestine as a development of Literary Aramaic. When it was rejected as such in Palestine, it kept its position in Babylonia for a long time. The origin of TJon cannot be conjectured from the custom of having the reading of the Bible accom- panied by a translation into Aramaic. On the other hand, the liturgical ap- plication of TJon from the 2nd century CE iS certain. The proof text of Neh 8:8 has no bearing on a written targum, or on any Targum at all, and cer- tainly not on a Targum of the Prophets. (The meaning "translation" for Vin-z is unwarranted. Conversely, the meaning "clearly, articulated" is established beyond doubt and fits the context well.) There is no hard evidence in favor of the theory that there ever existed a complete Palestinian Targum of the Prophets other than (proto-)TJon. The 'zovir) onin readings in the Codex Reuchilianus 3 and medieval references to a Palestinian Targum could pos- sibly allude to a Palestinian Targum based on TJon, expanded with small and larger glosses in the course of its textual transmission. The chapter on the text of Targum Judges finds just six errors in the main text of Sperber's edition (three times ov for ox), but many in the apparatus. Desite Sperber's critics, Smelik agrees with Gordon that Sperber's choice of a well-executed Yemenite manuscript for his edition was not so injudicious after all. Once again, in this chapter we have a good survey and assessment of research, a study of the Western text, and likewise a study of the manu- scripts together with a provisional stemma. Chapter 3 examines the ancient translations: the Septuagint, Aquila, Sym- machus, Theodotion, Peshitta, and Vulgate. The LXX and TJon are clearly shown to represent two independent translations; Aquila, Symmachus and Theodotion have hardly any of the targumic deviations from the Hebrew. The Peshitta and TJon represent independent translations of the Hebrew, although there are many points of similarity between the Peshitta and TJon. Occasionally, Jerome's Vulgate bears the stamp of Jewish exegesis in which a targumic ingredient may well be discerned. Since TJon, Peshitta and Vul- gate often display a similar interpretation, the study of Jerome's relation to the Targum should take the exegetical traditions of the Peshitta into account. The central part of this work, of course, is the text and translation of Tg Judges, with a commentary, comprising almost half of the work (pp. 322- 631; 309 pages out of 681), and 1835 footnotes (yes, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-five footnotes). We are first given an introduction, and then a special section on the consistency of TJon (Judges)-a very important fea- ture of this special study, indicating a unified approach from its very origins. Treating of Tg Judg 1:8, Smelik has a good discussion of :inr zmno as a rendering of the Hebrew :nn ')fl, generally translated "at the edge of the sword." He notes that the equation of ph with mno does not in itself imply the meaning "edge" for mno, which normally means "word, matter, thing."</page><page sequence="3">SMELIK, THE TARGUM OF JUDGES-MCNAMARA 227 He notes the view of Jastrow and (hesitatingly) Dalman, suggesting a hala- khic connotation "law of war" (seemingly derived from the usual meaning "word, order, command"). He favors a third possibility, viz. to assume that mno) has the same idiomatic function as ')fl in postbiblical Hebrew, in which case mno denotes "matter, things," and mno) "by means of," and :nirr mno) "with the sword." This is how he renders throughout, with a cross-reference to his note in 1:8 in all occurrences. It is hard to go along with his omission of any translation for the Aramaic twno. Its presence in Targum Jonathan (and in the Pentateuch Targums as well) has exegetical significance. J. Levy (Chaldaiisches Worterbuch iiber die Targumim, p. 307, s.v.) recognizes the problem and renders: "with the sharpness (decision) of the sword" (mit der Schiirfe [Entscheidung] des Schwertes), which does not help too much. The Targum rendering is apparently an attempt to make sense of the exegetical problem posed with regard to the meaning of :nn )fl~ which is not at all clear to lexicographers. F. Zorell (Lexicon hebraicum et aramaicum Veteris Testa- menti, Rome, 1963, p. 643) says that perhaps the phrase means "according to the right/law of war" (frt. 'secundum ius belli'), with reference to his entry on :nn (p. 266), where he renders as "according to the (mouth=) judgment or right/law of war" (secundum [os=] iudicium seu ius belli), with an ex- planation. TJon recognizes the exegetical question, and I believe a transla- tion should reproduce mno by some word, whether it be "means" or some other. As a further indication of Smelik's attention to detail, I may cite his comment on the Tg translation of pve by '2p at 2:2: "13 out of the 21 times mvY (qal) is rendered by 5npq 8 times by mvY. The first rendering has a moral connotation of obedience and due acceptance, the latter is more neutral. 5npj is also used to describe God's listening to what man has to say" (p. 353). I note from the concordance that Tg Judges has few instances of ln 5)p in the sense of "listen to," a usage found in the Palestinian Targum. What I have in mind is the rendering of aip in Tg 6:3 as (rrn Irt) p5apno and how to render: "receiving one from the other," or "listening to one another." Smelik translates )5) vn1a of 5:2 as "openly," rightly rejecting the rendering "at the head of the exiles." As well as referring to Onqelos, where it renders nez iva, one might also note the occurrences in Neofiti and Neofiti margins, always in connection with the Exodus from Egypt-for instance Neofiti mar- gin Lev 26:13, "I led you out with stature erect and with head uncovered" (5)) v)12a no)i -nwpa). He has a very thorough treatment of the midrashic expansion in Tg Judges 5:4, "Your law which you have given to them ... Lord, on the day that you revealed yourself from Seir to give it, and mani- fested your glory over the territory of Edom, the earth trembled, yes, the heavens bowed, yes, the clouds poured down rain." This he studies in con- junction with the Palestinian Targum tradition (Judg 5:4; Deut 32:2 and Gen 21:21). In his view, "[t]here is no reason to cast doubt on the Palestinian</page><page sequence="4">228 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW character of the traditions embedded in PT Judges 5:4 since its three main aggadic elements appear to have their roots in ancient Palestinian exegesis, namely the notion of inclining heavens, the initial offer of the Torah to the nations surrounding Israel, and the tradition of the celestial dew, poured down from heaven to revive the dead" (p. 412). I believe that it is very im- portant to regard the Palestinian Targum paraphrase of Deut 32:2 as arising from exegetical considerations, rather than from some independent midrash. Smelik also has a fine treatment of the dispute between the mountains in TJon Judges 5:5, with a section on the exegetical origin of the dispute. Chapter 5 contains the author's conclusions with regard to TJon and TJon Judges, summarized in good part in the passage already cited from the dust cover. It covers the language, the setting in life of TJon, the early history of TJon Judges (dating of Tg Judges, development of the various textual fam- ilies, the importance of the Western manuscripts), the Palestinian Targum and Tosefta-Targum, with an epilogue on Judah ben Ilai's saying on the Targum. Although any attempt to write the prehistory of TJon's text remains specu- lative, Smelik argues that TJon combined a literal approach with a midrashic one from the outset. The 2nd century CE is a suitable point of reference for the bulk of TJon Judges. It seems reasonable to assume that the proto-Targum of Judges existed prior to the Bar Kokhba revolt, underwent at least one re- vision in the second half of the 2nd century CE, and was perhaps occasion- ally revised in the Amoraic period so as to bring TJon into agreement with later exegesis. The work ends with an equation index (to the notes on key translation equivalents), and with indices of authors and subjects. The thoroughness of Smelik's work is in part due to his use of the bilin- gual concordance to the Targum of Prophets being edited at the Theological University of Kampen, The Netherlands, with Johannes C. De Moor as Proj- ect Director. De Moor introduced this series in the first volume that was pub- lished (Joshua, 1995). The Bilingual Concordance contains both the Aramaic word and the Hebrew term translated (when available), together with an En- glish translation of both. This permits us to judge the uniformity (or other- wise) of the translation, what the pluses of the Targum may be and in what context they occur or tend to occur. This is a project of fundamental im- portance for the future of targumic research, as indicated in the preface to the first volume, and made clear by Willem Smelik in his monograph on the Targum of Judges. Smelik himself has edited the Concordance of Tg Judges, using the text of Sperber's edition, and expanding the collection of manu- scripts used by Sperber for his edition (adding Babylonian manuscripts and other manuscripts of the Western tradition). The present volume includes the testimony of 12 complete manuscripts of Tg Judges, 18 haftarah manu- scripts, and the Mahzor Romania as published by the Bomberg Press in Ven- ice in 1523.</page><page sequence="5">SMELIK, THE TARGUM OF JUDGES-MCNAMARA 229 In the preface to The Targum of Judges, Smelik thanks his Spanish teach- ers, L.
