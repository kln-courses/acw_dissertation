<plain_text><page sequence="1">Joseph Patrien: The Formation of Nabatean Art, Prohibition of a Graven Image among the Nabateans, The Magnes Press, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem ? EJ. Brill, Leiden, 1990. 231 pages, 60 illustrations.* The interest in the varied aspects of Nabatean civilization is a felicitous phenomenon of recent scholarship. Scholars of many nations have taken part in the study of its archaeological heritage, especially in Petra, and Israeli researchers occupy an important position in this field, since the western part of the Nabatean realm is included in present-day Israel. To judge by its title, the subject of J. Patrich's book is art. The artistic production proper of the Nabateans, however, and of the artists employed by them, plays but a subordinate role in his analysis. Thus, the typological situation, the art-historical evaluation of Nabatean rock-architecture and its at times high-quality decoration in relief receive only marginal treatment. However, those genuinely autochthonous attestations of the Nabatean heritage, in which the author is mainly interested, should be assigned to the field of art with considerable reservations only. Among these should be counted in the first place the original face-stelae with their generally highly abstract form, as well as a series of rock-drawings. Unfortunately, the author worked with premises that differ markedly from accepted views on Nabatean art. The ideas he has put forward are undoubtedly original, but remain unproven. The book's thesis, as expressed by the subtitle, is the antithesis between opposition to graven images on the one hand, and foreign influences in the form of figurative representations on the other. It is the author's opinion that the systematic destruction of such motifs on the decoration of the reliefs on rock cut graves is the result of this antithesis (pp. 153-157). These acts are generally, and in my view correctly, regarded as a consequence of Islamic hostility to graven images after the caliph Yazid IPs edict of 721 CE. Patrich's contention that these acts of vandalism had taken place already under the Nabatean kings (he even considers royal toleration of these acts; p. 157) is an entirely unsupported theory. According to Patrich, this conjectured victory of the Nabatean iconoclasts belongs to the same tradition as the above mentioned eighth-century prohibition of graven images, although the favourable attitude to figurative art of the Omayyad period is clear evidence against such an association of ideas: one should consider Quseir 'Amra in Jordan or Hisham's * The author and the editors thank Prof. J. Geiger, Jerusalem, for translating this review from German.</page><page sequence="2">280 REVIEWS Palace at Jericho. The phenomenon of non figurative images of deities, among which the above-mentioned eye-stelae belong, is surely an autochthonous element. Yet, as admitted by Patrich himself, they cannot be narrowed down to a phase of Nabatean artistic production which precedes figurative representations of the deity. We clearly are dealing with parallel forms of representation. Anthropomorphic iconography of the gods is unthinkable without the influence of the Greek-Hellenistic world; the conservative stone-images, however, continued to exist at the same time, as can be clearly seen from the images of Dusares on coins of the period of the Roman Empire. It is also highly improbable that all of the limited number of marble statues of divine images from Petra derive from the period after the Roman annexation of the Nabatean kingdom (p. 150). This is particularly so because there is good evidence in Nabatean minor art in the round for figurative divine images. The Formation of Nabatean Art is thus to a large extent connected with the influence of Hellenistic ideas in the realm of plastic art. These developments can be understood in the first place in the domain of architecture and its decoration. Furthermore, the minor arts, especially figurative terracottas, provide important conclusions. The hostility to graven images assumed in the coinage is disproved by the facts adduced by Patrich himself (p. 75). The numerous portraits display powerful foreign influences, as do the diverse types of illustrations on their reverse. The author's preconceptions are demonstrated once more by the anti-figurative ideology that he constructs for the numismatic material. The origins of foreign artistic influences have been a matter of scholarly discussion for a long time, but Patrich does not pay particular attention to these questions. Such influences were not simply a formal matter. Alongside the artistic connections with Ptolemaic Egypt, the integration and amalgamation of its chief goddess Isis with Aphrodite al-'Uzza and its importance for cultural history can hardly be overestimated. The author's earlier contribution to the subject, 'Al-'Uzza Earrings' (IEJ 34 [1984], pp. 39-46), contains interesting details in connection with this question. The identification of the Nabatean chief goddess with Isis is also treated in more recent studies, not incorporated by Patrich. The inadequate state of the research must be noted. The statement that the Hebrew University of Jerusalem M.A. thesis of 1981 has been brought up to date (p. 7) is valid only with reservations. The author quotes literature in some cases down to 1986, but certain important subsequent contributions are ignored, of which only a few can be mentioned. R. Wennig: Die Nabat?er ? Denkm?ler und Geschichte ? eine Bestandsaufnahme des arch?ologischen Befundes (1987) is quoted in the bibliography, but has not been used. One also misses the important exhibition catalogues La voie royale ? 9000 ans d'art au Royaume de Jordanie, Paris, 1986/87 (German edition Der K?nigsweg, K?ln, 1987), especially the section on the Nabateans prepared by F. Baratte, F. Zayadine and J. Starcky, pp. 152-193. The most important recent literature on representations of el-'Uzza-Aphrodite Isis is also absent: F. Zayadine, in La Mythologie gr?co-romaine ? Mythologies p?riph?riques, Coll. Internat, du CNRS No. 593, 1979 (1981), pp. 113-118 with 2 plates; idem in Lexicon Iconographicum Mythologiae Classicae 2 (1984), pp. 167-169, Pl. 169-170, s.v. al-'Uzza Aphrodite; M.-J. Roche, Syria 62 (1985), pp. 313-316; M. Lindner, ZDPV104 (1988), pp. 84-91, Plates 2-11A (Plate 10: eye-stele with emblem of Isis) = Der K?nigweg, loc. cit., p. 213, No. 201bis and Fig. This is all the more disappointing since the apparatus suggests at first glance a solid grounding in the scholarly literature incorporated. This is not the matter of a few incomplete references, but rather lacunae which pertain to fundamental problems.</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 281 The book is attractively produced from a typographical point of view, but unfortunately also has a regrettable drawback in its appearance: the low quality of many figures, especially of numerous objects which are informative from the artistic point of view. Exceptions are the careful drawings (Figs. 4-9, 18-26, 29, 31, 32, 34 and 59a-d), as well as the dust-jacket figure wrongly described on p. 148 as 'two humped camels' (sicl). The book, rich in material and attesting to great industry, is undoubtedly stimulating, but the hypothetical character of its theses diminishes its usefulness. Klaus Parlasca</page></plain_text>
