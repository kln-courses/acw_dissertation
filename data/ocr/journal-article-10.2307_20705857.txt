<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHORTER COMMUNICATIONS SAMOAN FIGURATIVE CARVINGS AND SAMOAN CANOES Roger Neich National Museum of New Zealand In view of the current interest in Samoan sculptures of the human figure (Davidson 1975, Scott 1982), it may be useful at this point to record some obser vations and suggestions which set these sculptures in the wider context of 19th century Samoa. In particular, I will seek to relate these human-figure sculptures to a broader but little recognised tradition of animal-figure sculpture in Samoa. Then, I will emphasise the associations of this Samoan human and animal figurative carving tradition with the various types of canoes and boats in use in Samoa through much of the 19th century. Finally, I will support Larsson's (I960) viewpoint that these human-figure sculptures from Samoa need to be considered in relation to acculturated art, perhaps as earlier forerunners of the later animal carvings that tended to replace the human images, possibly as missionary opposi tion to ''idols'' gained ground. The existence of Samoan figurative carvings from the 19th century is recorded in a few rare references. It is likely that other observers regarded this art as atypical and hence barely worthy of comment. After describing the increasing popularity of the taumualua type of canoe, Turner goes on to list the decorations of Samoan canoes: They do not paint their canoes but decorate them with rows of white shells (Cypraea ovula) running along the middle of the deck at the bow and stern, and also along the upper part of the outrigger. Now and then you see a figure head with some rude device of a human figure, a dog, a bird, or something else, which has from time immemorial been the "coat-of-arms" of the par ticular village or district to which the canoe belongs (Turner 1861:269). This statement does not differentiate very carefully between the taumualua and the outrigger types of canoes, but Turner's illustration (Fig.l) clearly shows a taumualua with a small figurehead carving of a bird surmounting the raised pro jection at the forward end of the boat. Writing just two years after Turner, Hood borrows Turner's phraseology to describe Samoan canoes seen in 1862 when Hood was there on H.M.S. Fawn. Hood states: Along the bow and stern is generally a row of white shells (Cypraea ovula) and some have a raised prow thickly studded over with these shells, and above, the figure of some bird or beast, the armorial bearing of the village to which the canoe belongs (Hood 1863:47). 191</page><page sequence="2">3</page><page sequence="3">SAMOAN FIGURATIVE CARVING 193 Certainly such carvings are associated with canoes, and in particular with the taumualua war canoe. Kr?mer (1903:265) explicitly states that the taumualua often had the figure of an animal on a post in the prow as a figurehead, the emblem of the village community in war. On a taumualua from Falefa, Upolu, Kr?mer saw a carving of a fua'o (a seabird) which he collected and took to Stuttgart. Buck (1930:405-7) gives a comprehensive description of the taumualua with its plank construction, single hull lacking an outrigger, and the high projection at both of the bow-shaped ends. Kr?mer (1903:266-7) provides photographs of a taumualua in the water and two models. Another fine old Samoan-made model taumualua, 168 cm long, has recently been identified in the collections of the National Museum of New Zealand (National Museum No. FE. 1194). None of these photographs or models has an animal carving as figurehead. According to Ella (1898:247), the taumualua was introduced into Samoa in 1849 by Eli Jennings, an American living at A'ana, who built two boats for the A*ana and Atua forces opposing Malietoa. The design was quickly adopted by Samoans, who used their traditional technique of planks sewn together with sen nit lashings. Later they also used the introduced clinker-built technique. Later still, these boats apparently evolved into the even longer whaleboat-style fautasi. As far as we know, the fautasi never had carved figureheads, although modern ones seen in Samoa in 1980 sometimes had a painting of a human face, or perhaps a lagoon scene, near the bow. The years just before 1849 are also the time of what is probably the oldest definite Samoan carved canoe figurehead still preserved in a museum. This is the human figure in the Peabody Museum of Salem, Massachusetts, described by Scott (1982). An old faded handwritten label on the back of this figure identifies it as "Figure Head of Canoe". It was collected some time between 1844 and 1849, during the 52-month circumnavigational voyage of the Connecticut whaler Stieglitz, commanded by Captain Youngs. From an examination of the log of the Stieglitz, Scott (1982:591) suggests that the figure was collected at either Manu'a or Tutuila on December 8 or 9, 1845, although the old label itself bears the date "August 1846". The latitude and longitude noted on the old label actually designate a point about 4 km inland from the south-east coast of Upolu, in the Falealili district, but this may simply have been Captain Youngs' nearest fix for the "Navigator's Islands". I had the opportunity to examine this figure myself in 1982, and noted at that time that the old label also bore the word "Oahterwhal", obviously a European's attempt to transliterate a Samoan word. I will return to this point below, but just to complete the record, I should like to add to Scott's description of the figure. The carving has the form of a free-standing, naturalistic, nude male figure, 69 cm high, with the hands in front holding a black painted object on the chest, and remains of black paint or charcoal over the ears. There were also signs of red paint about the head, according to the Peabody Museum catalogue (the carving is registered No. E 5309). It has been sawn and carved out of a single piece of light brown wood, with the legs cut off at the ankles, and then mounted on a separate base of darker wood with typical Samoan-style notches cut by a sharp tool along the two front edges. I noted a</page><page sequence="4">194 ROGER NEICH straight saw cut between the thighs and buttocks, and a small hole drilled at the neck and the anus. In the context of his ideas about culture contact affecting the form of Polynesian images, Larsson (1960:109) wonders whether the object held on the chest may be similar to a Maori mere. However, to my eye, the object sug gested a small mammal's head, with an elongated snout and perhaps even an in dication of strongly slanted eyes. This identification would be consistent with the animal form of many of the other recorded figureheads. Another use of carved animal representations on canoes, this time a Samoan 'alia double canoe, is confirmed by a Thomas Andrew photograph taken in the 1890s of an 'alia at Olosega (Kr?mer 1903: plate 103), showing low relief carvings on the two panels fronting the platform between the hulls. Another view of this same 'alia taken at the same time by Thomas Andrew is preserved in his collection of glass-plate negatives, now held in the National Museum of New Zealand (Negative No. C.1429). Detailed enlargements of the carved panels from this negative (Figs. 2,3) clearly show low relief renderings of a pig and a dog on the left panel, and on the right panel one rather indeterminate horse and another definite horse with a human rider. The animals are painted a darker brown than the light natural wood colour of the panels. The last two animals bear a noticeable stylistic resemblance to the animal imprinted on a modern piece of Samoan siapo collected in 1950 (Kooijman 1972:248). Cultural influence from Fiji needs to be considered when trying to account for the carved animals on the 'alia, since this type of double canoe is a Samoan adoption of the Fijian ndrua form of double canoe which had superseded the indigenous Samoan va'a tele double canoe by about the 1830s (Haddon and Hornell 1936:241). In fact, Williams (1858:plate facing page 88) illustrates a 4'pilaster of a deckhouse" of a Fijian double canoe with two small human images apparently carved in low relief. However, Larsson (1960:161) quotes a note from Williams' own manuscript "Sketch Book" where he comments about this particular decoration: "I copied from a Na Vitilevu canoe: it is a whim and not common". Apart from these figurative carvings, all associated with canoes, a few others have been recorded in different contexts. In a letter written in 1892 from Apia, Robert Louis Stevenson describes a "great house" decorated for a royal kava ceremony with "two carved and coloured model birds" set in the rafters (Steven son 1895:209). Judd (in Buck 1930:614) recounted a story of a wooden idol, about one foot long, with large eyes and mouth, kept in a small box in the house of a Leone chief. It was exhibited on rare occasions, and was seen by Judd's in formant as a child, that is, probably in the later part of the 19th century. This last figure sounds similar to the best-known Samoan carved human figure, the wooden image now in the British Museum recently documented by Davidson (1975) using early missionary accounts. Seen by missionaries at Amaile in the Aleipata district of Upolu in 1836, this figure was associated with the preserved bodies of two important chiefs. It is almost exactly the same height as the Peabody Museum figurehead, with which it also shares certain stylistic and structural similarities. If the Peabody Museum figure is, in fact, a canoe figurehead, then the British Museum figure could have served the same purpose originally. It is quite conceivable that the British Museum figure was cut off the</page><page sequence="5">SAMO AN FIGURATIVE CARVING 195 FIGURE 2.

Although the missionaries who saw the figure with the bodies commented in their writings that this was the first anthropomorphic carving they had encountered in Samoa, there seems to have been a general association in their minds between figurative carvings and Samoan double canoes. Hence the Methodist Matthew Wilson described the platform on which the bodies rested as "a stand made for them like a double canoe" (Wilson in Davidson 1975:353), this stand being the same height as the wooden image. Then later, Turner (1861:232) who did not actually see the figure, wrote about the bodies: "They are laid on a platform, raised on a double canoe", notwithstand ing the fact that this structure was inside a house. There is still further possible evidence of a relationship between these two figures. The British Museum figure was first seen by Europeans in 1836, while the Peabody Museum figure was collected in 1845 or 1846. Captain Youngs' latitude and longitude suggest that he might have collected his figure on or near the eastern end of Upolu, perhaps even from a canoe encountered at sea. The ex treme eastern end of Upolu is the Aleipata district, where Amaile village is located. Even more intriguing is the possibility, however tenuous, that Captain Youngs' label name of "Oahterwhal" may be an attempted transliteration for Utufa'alalafa, a coastal village just one kilometre south of Amaile. Therefore, one can speculate that these two figures might have been collected from almost the same locality, or at least from the same district, within 10 years of each other. This would provide some evidence for a restricted figure-carving tradition in the Aleipata district of Upolu during the early decades of the 19th century. Just how much this tradition might owe to culture contact for its beginnings is another question, beyond the scope of this essay. However, we have now been able to assemble fairly convincing evidence for a continuous Samoan tradition of figurative carving extending from the 1830s and 1840s to the turn of the century, in close association with the various types of canoes in use during this period. For the earlier double canoes and perhaps the larger 'iatolima and amatasi types of outrigger canoes, the evidence for carved figureheads is rather tenuous, especially since there were probably never moFe than a few rare examples. The human image in the Peabody Museum constitutes the most solid evidence for this. Then this practice of using carved figureheads was transferred to the newly introduced taumualua boats of the latter half of the 19th century, when the carving of animal and bird figureheads flourished, becom ing more common than human forms had ever been. Then, finally, the concept of animal carvings associated with canoes found its last expression in the carved panels of the 'alia at Olosega, one of the last surviving large double canoes to be seen in Samoa. Of course, there is no need to assume that all figurative carvings from Samoa are necessarily canoe figureheads, but we can now accept them as part of a documented tradition of figurative art. Such an interpretation may seem to detract from the dramatic rarity of human figure sculptures from Samoa, but at least it makes their occurrence and function more understandable.</page><page sequence="7">SAMOAN FIGURATIVE CARVING 197 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I thank Dr. Peter Fetchco and his staff at the Peabody Museum of Salem for enabling me to examine the figure there.
