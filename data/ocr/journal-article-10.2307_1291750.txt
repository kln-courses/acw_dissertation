Such faith in the painted image, and in fact in the image itself, as described later in this apocryphal Coptic account, saved Euphemia on the several occasions in which the Devil appeared to her. After the death of Euphemia, the icon of the archangel Michael mysteriously ap- peared in the apse of the nearby church of the Archangels. We are told, at the end of the story, that this image of Michael, which was painted on an olive wood tablet, would blos- som from its corners on the archangel's feast days and produce fruit. The fruit and leaves were curative, and various sick people were said to have been healed there, including a woman with a tumor who ate of the fruit of the picture, and a man who suffered head- aches before placing one of the leaves upon his head. The attribution of medicinal power to an icon is certainly not uncommon in Byzan- tium, nor is the belief in its role as a protector of believers, as shown in the passage above. Intercession, understood both as intervention and defense, was the main function of any Byzantine icon.2 However, among the vast number of surviving Byzantine icons, it is the This study was delivered as a paper at the twentieth Byzantine Studies Conference held at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, in October 1994. I would like to thank my colleague Charles Barber for his assistance with the translation of this final version. 'The encomium by Eustathius, a historically unidentified "bishop of the island Trake," is dated to the early seventh century: Saint Michael the Archangel: Three Encomiums by Theodosius, Archbishop of Alexandria, Severus, Patriarch ofAntioch, and Eustathius, Bishop of Trake, ed. E. A. Wallis Budge (London, 1894), 74-108, with quoted passages on 78 and 104. Trake supposedly refers to a district around the Black Sea, since it is described by the author of the legend as the place where John Chrysostomos was banished and died. Aristarchus was a general in the service of the western emperor Honorius (384-423): ibid., xxvII. The same legend, probably translated from another manuscript, is published by E. Amdlineau, Contes et romans de l'Egypte chritienne, I (Paris, 1888), 21-48, with Euphemia's wish on 23 and 46. Here "saint Anastase, eveque de l'ile de Turquie," is denoted as the legend's author. 2The theory of the icon is a much discussed topic in the literature. For the meaning of icons, cf. a selection of texts translated by C. Mango, The Art of the Byzantine Empire, 312-1453 (Toronto, 1986), 169-77, and D. J. Sahas, Icon and Logos: Sources in Eighth-Century Iconoclasm (Toronto, 1986), esp. 8-9, 216A and 216c-E, passim.

About the per-</page><page sequence="2">346 THE ARCHANGELOS XORINOS, OR THE BANISHER exception when the depicted saint-protector is inscribed as an "exorcist"; that is, the one who-being capable of defending-literally "exiles" (the evil). We have observed such an epithet on a post-Byzantine icon of the archangel Gabriel from Cyprus. In its essence, this caption expresses the function of any painted saint, which is to mediate and to pro- tect from harm. The icon of the archangel Gabriel Xorinos-6 'Ap[6"yygelo;] FapptjilX 6 Eoptv6;-was previously located in the church of the Virgin Chrysaliniotissa in Nicosia (Fig. 1). In addition to its caption, the shape and dimensions of this icon are also unusual- 1.90 m high, 1.86 m wide. The icon is published in a book dedicated to the icons of this island written in 1937 by Tamara and David Talbot Rice, with a contribution by Rupert Gunnis.3 The archangel is presented half-length and full-face, holding a staff with the inscribed Trisagion AFIOX AFIOZ AFIOZ in his right hand, and a sphere with Christ's bust in the other. According to the description in Talbot Rice's book, the archangel's dress is a dark blue-green and has ochre bands on the sleeves. His cloak is red with floral applications on the shoulders. A dark ochre loros is crossed over the chest and is decorated with green medallions bearing red cherubim. We do not know where this icon is today. Talbot Rice has already pointed to the large scale of this icon, as well as to its almost square form. The proposed dating of the icon to the sixteenth century, generally accept- able, can be extended to the second half of the previous century, too.4 However, the inscription "Xorinos"-Banisher or Exiler-written between the head and the wings of the archangel Gabriel, has not been explained. Before turning to the issue of the inscrip- tion, I will first expand upon the discussion of the form of the icon. Because of its enlarged dimensions, this icon can be said to belong to the group of Cypriot "gigantic" icons. From the same church, the Virgin Chrysaliniotissa, come three well-known large rectangular icons: Christ with Archangels and the Donors Michael, Euphemia, and Maria (from 1356); Saint Eleutherios with Three Deceased Persons (end of the fourteenth century); and St. Paraskevi with a Kneeling Donor (ca. 1400).5 These icons are kept in the Byzantine Museum (Phaneromeni Collection) in Nicosia.6 In 1934 a collection of icons, including all of those mentioned above, was installed in a monastic ceived roles of icons in Byzantium, see R. Cormack, "Miraculous Icons and Their Power," Arte cristiana 76 (1988), 55-60. On the social function of images, see A. Kazhdan and H. Maguire, "Byzantine Hagiographical Texts as Sources on Art," DOP 45 (1991), 1-22, esp. 14-15. On the intercessory power of holy images and their ability to protect from harm, as recorded in certain saint's vitae, see, most recently, L. Brubaker, "The Sacred Image," in The Sacred Image, East and West, ed. R. Ousterhout and L. Brubaker (Urbana-Chicago, 1994), 6-8 (with further bibliography). An interesting example of the invocation of saints as "active helpers," specifying their visualization as images, is found in the dedicatory poem to Emperor Basil II in his menologion, Bibl. Marciana gr. 17: N. P. Sev:enko, "The Walters 'Imperial' Menologion," JWalt 51 (1993), 60. For the concept of the intercession of icons after Iconoclasm, see H. Maguire, "Magic and the Christian Image," in Byzantine Magic, ed. H. Maguire (Washington, D.C., 1995), 51-71, esp. 66-69, with important remarks on the difference between the magical and the Christian use of images. 3D. Talbot Rice, The Icons of Cyprus (London, 1937), 235, no. 73. 4The rendering of the facial features of the archangel, and the wide setting in general, bring to mind the paintings in the churches in Platanistasa, Palaeochorio, and Pedoullas that date from the second half of the fifteenth to the middle of the sixteenth centuries.

In the Troodos, the church of Panagia Katholiki has an icon of St. Mamas on a lion, from the beginning of the sixteenth cen- tury.9 In Paphos, there is a large icon of St. George the Perivolatis, dating from the same century, that is today kept in the Byzantine Museum there (Fig. 2).1o The question is Where were the large and squarish icons originally located within the church? The majority of these icons do not have the usual form of a vertical rectangle and their top edge is not horizontal, but is in the shape of a four-centered arch." This same shape is also to be found in the fresco decoration of Cypriot churches. For example, the fresco of St. George on a horse and flanked by scenes from his life, depicted on the west wall of the south aisle of the church of the Holy Cross in Pelendri, also has an upper portion that is a pointed arch. Among frescoes of archangels, there are a number of similar examples, usually of extra-large dimensions. In the church of St. Demetrianus in Dali (1317), for instance, such a fresco appears in the niche on the north wall (Fig. 3), and in the church of the Transfiguration in Palaeochorio (beginning of the sixteenth century) in the recess on the north wall.12 (Fig. 4) From the identity of the content, scale, and shape of both the frescoes and the icons, we can conclude that the large-scale icons from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries were intended to be placed over existing fres- coes of the same subject, dimension, and form. We may speculate that such a practice was the result of a new donor's activity and that, for all intents, it represents an instance of particular devotion. There are surviving instances of such a practice in two post- Byzantine churches in Cyprus-the archangel Michael in Pyla and Kokkinotrimithia.' In the niches in the north wall in Pyla and in the south wall in Kokkinotrimithia, we find that an older fresco of the archangel has been covered by an icon with an identical archangel's figure of a later date. Thus we may presume that the large icon of the archangel Gabriel Xorinos once covered a fresco of the archangel in a church. It is possible that the church bore the same epithet, that of the Xorinos. We have no way of knowing, however, whether the assumed fresco of the archangel carried the same epithet "the Exiler." This epithet, in any case, is the product of a tradition much older than this rather late, Cypriot icon. It derives from the magical practice of exiling one's enemy, which was ascribed to a local Cypriot "divin- ity" known either as Agios Georgios Xorinos or as Archangelos Xorinos. 7R.

'Short notes on these churches are given by Gunnis, Historic Cyprus, 406-7 (the church dedicated to the archangel Michael, the principal church of the village of Pyla, and, as Gunnis wrote, probably of medieval origin) and 276 (the chapel of the archangel Michael, outside the village of "Kokkini Trimithia," was suppos- edly constructed in the early sixteenth century).</page><page sequence="4">348 THE ARCHANGELOS XORINOS, OR THE BANISHER This custom of "exorcism" was recorded almost a century ago in writings on the patron saints of two churches on Cyprus, one in Famagusta, and the other in Pano Lefk- ara. Camille Enlart and Harry Charles Luke have stated that the so-called Nestorian Church in Famagusta-founded, most probably, in the fourteenth century-was re- named by the Orthodox Ayios Georgios Xorinos, or St. George the Exiler. Luke describes a custom connected with this church: "Whoever would be rid of his enemy has but to drop in the house of the victim a little dust from the floor of the church ...",4 Enlart gives the same explanation for the name of the church of St. George the Exiler in Fama- gusta. He also provides a description of the church, which was already in ruinous condi- tion but with some paintings preserved. In its southern aisle, among other figures of the saints, a colossal ("over-life-size") picture of the archangel Michael-qualified as "Byzan- tine"-was depicted. These paintings were later destroyed.15 As for the church in Pano Lefkara that was dedicated to St. George Xorinos, Rupert Gunnis explains the origin of its name as follows: "Any person who has a grudge against another goes into the church and collects a little dust from the floor: this is then taken away, placed in a small rag and cast into the sea in the belief that the person will thus exile his enemy from the island."'16 Concerning the same church in (Pano) Lefkara, there is an older statement by George Jeffery, who writes that the church, "a mere shed," was dedicated to George or Archangelos Xorinos. "In this case," he writes, "it is the Archangel Michael who is supposed to act as exorcist";'7 he assumes that churches of the Xorinos represented a peculiarity of the Cypriot branch of the Orthodox Church, and he provides a description of the ceremony-"supposed by a simple minded Cypriot to have the de- sired effect of exiling his enemy from the island"-saying that a package containing dust from the church floor was mixed with some part of the clothing of the object of the spell and was then brought to the shore and "with certain incantations" cast into the sea.18 The epithet the Banisher or Exiler ("Xorinos") that is given to the archangel Gabriel on the Cypriot icon derives from the word +4opf'o, to exile, or A4opxtico, to exorcise, and is thus understandable in connection with the described custom of the expulsion or ousting (of an enemy, or demon) from a place, which is a form of exorcism. It is analogous to the well-known exorcist's formula "I expel you (Satan)"-'EEopxtpi( oe ( C atava_)- which is found on a great number of early Christian amulets and papyri; it appears in Acts 19:13 and on Greek magical plaques, lamellae, as well as in various modern exorkismoi in the form 6p9i'(m; the epithet obviously belongs to the world of magic and superstition. 14H.

The belief that damage done to a man's clothing may lead to harm being inflicted upon that person is held in many religions. See W. H.

Straightforward exorcism was a means of "healing" people believed to be possessed by demons, and hence sick; the use of certain words and actions was believed to lead to the expulsion of the demons.21 In Orthodox culture, it was thought that maladies, above all, those of the mind, were a consequence of the Devil's machinations; thus illness was considered a form of demoniac possession.22 The Devil would conduct his activity, so it was believed, hidden inside a man's body until he was forced to reveal himself, at the name of the Lord. He could also dwell in various places, such as trees, mountains and the like. During the exorcistic rite, the demon would speak to the practioner addressing " Cf. L.

During the catechumenate service, the devil would be rebuked and adjured by God ("who now commands you through us") to come out and depart. At the same time, a number of apotropaic actions could be performed-prayers, fasting, imposition of a sign of the cross or holy object, etc.25 Apart from Christ and his followers, the saints also had power over demons. Evidence for the powers of such holy men goes back to the time of Greek papyri and early amu- lets.26 As a magician, King Solomon had an eminent and long-lasting reputation. Among Christian Jews, it was believed that Solomon possessed powers over evil spirits and that he could have used them in "medical" ways, such as chasing demons from the sick." In Byzantium, those holy fathers dwelling in the provinces, and whose lives were a constant struggle with demons, were particularly endowed with healing powers as a distinctive sign of their sanctity.28 They were said to have cured instantly and painlessly, quite the opposite of trained physicians.29 Many appeared to sick people during sleep, prescribing the adequate treatments: Sts. Cyr and John, Cosmas and Damian, Artemius,30 Nicholas,3' 23C. Bonner, "The Technique of Exorcism," HTR 26 (1943), 39-49. 24The exorcisms performed by Jesus himself, and his disciples-according to New Testament stories Matt. 8:28-34, 9:32-34, 12:24-28, 15:21-28, 17:14-20; Mark 5:23, 6:5, 7:22, 8:23; Luke 4:40, 13:13; and Acts 10:38-underpinned and maintained exorcistic beliefs and practices. The commands and demands drew heavily on biblical language, as shown in Greenfield, Late Byzantine Demonology, 142-43. While the Old Testa- ment condemns magic-Exod. 7:8-13, 22:18; 1 Sam. 28; 1 Kings 18-the New Testament contains passages presenting magicians-Acts 8:9-24, Matt. 2:1-17.

In addition, angels and archangels were also considered exorcists. Demonstration of this identity is crucial to our interpretation of the epithet on the Cypriot icon of the archangel Gabriel. This notion is to be found in a number of Byzantine textual sources, but only exceptionally is it presented in pictoral representations. A survey of the literary tradition might start with the famous early Christian book of healing and magic, the so-called Testament of Solomon, which remained in constant use until the late Byzantine period. One cannot overlook that it was "Michael the archangel" who brought Solomon a ring, as a gift from the Lord, thus investing the king with the "authority over demons."3" The archangel Michael is given here a mediating role, draw- ing upon his basic angelic function as messenger. In a similar vein, evidence from the vita of St. Symeon the Younger (512-592) can be cited. Three times, in succession, angels appear to Symeon explaining the methods and meaning of healing. First, in a vision, Michael and Gabriel (the archangels) accompany Christ, who himself gives to Symeon the power of expelling evil spirits. Next, three angels appear to Symeon, "more in reality than in vision," writes the author of Symeon's vita, explaining that "illnesses are to be cured by the laying on of the saint's hands" and "mak- ing a sign of the cross," while saying "in the name of the Son of God, who is crucified for us, leave unclean spirits" ( 0a~azet: atn' auczvv, cOapta  vejata).34 On the third occa- sion, the three angels declare that in the future such healing is to be done through Sy- meon's agency. There follows a proper list of techniques of exorcism that Symeon must pursue in order to heal.35 From this we can conclude that the power of exorcism was handed down from Christ through the angels to the saints. The instructions given to Symeon were part of a widespread repertoire of words and methods of medieval healing magic. In a number of saints' vitae from the eleventh century, for example, there are records of the procedure for the laying on of the cross, also of the Gospels, and the use of oil, holy water, relics, etc.36 While St. Symeon's vita and the Testament of Solomon give us a generalized notion of angels as transmitters of the function of the doctor-exorcist, the idea of an angel behaving in an exorcistic manner is to be found in other hagiographical literature. One instance is in the tenth-century vita of St. Luke of Steiris. Luke's rescue from sexual temptation is 12C. L. Connor and W. R. Connor, The Life and Miracles of Saint Luke of Steiris (Brookline, Mass., 1994), chaps. 74-76 and 82.

St. Neophytos the Recluse (twelfth century) describes in one of his writings an attack by the Devil that occurred in his encleistra near Paphos. He thanks the Trinity, the Virgin, the cross, and the archangels Michael and Gabriel (the two flamebearers of God) for his rescue following his fall from a rock and, for protection from the "tyranny of demons," he thanks the angel of God.38 So, for Neophytos this angel possessed the ability to protect him from Satan, and, more importantly, he perceived the angel's activity in real, physical, terms. An angel imagined in a fully active role is but a short step from the notion of the angel as doctor-exorcist. This latter notion is elaborated in texts written to celebrate the archangels Michael and Gabriel, the two main archangels. Within Byzantine angelology, only "biographies" of these archangels were individualized to the degree that pictorial art was used to illustrate their deeds, almost as if the archangels were "real" saints. Their actions, especially these of Michael, emerged out of their characterized traits and quali- ties, for which they were glorified in texts. The archangel Michael has the distinct role of fighting and defeating Satan and his rebel angels. Michael's military position among all the angels, whose chief commander he was, and the belief that illness of spirit and body could be overcome by force-as demonstrated by Michael in legends, the most famous being the one of Chonae39 ex- plains why it was that this archangel was often invoked as a powerful protector and de- fender, or propugnator.40 The epithet "propugnator" is, in fact, a literary commonplace; however, the archangel can also be literally called an "exorcist" (daemonum exterminator), as is the case in the encomium on archangels and angels by Sophronius ofJerusalem (633/ 4-638), where this epithet is applied to the archangel Michael in a list of his outstanding characteristics, and on account of which he is begged to be Sophronius' protector or patronus.41 The same thought was expressed in a more subtle manner by the Constantino- politan deacon Pantaleon in his encomium on the archangel Michael (end of the ninth or the beginning of the tenth century). He addresses Michael as the great principal of the heavenly hosts (magnus princeps) and as the strongest fighter and defender. Among other tasks, his role was "to chase enemies, heal the sick and to push away the devil's attacks" (daemonum impetus propulsat).42 37 Connor, Saint Luke of Steiris, chap. 29. 38I. Ch.

In this Oratio, the archangel Michael is asked to "exile every horrible thing," to protect the author on the day of the resurrection by "preventing the demon's assaults," and to bring the elected to God.43 Such generally formulated views on the archangel's role in protecting one from evil, valuable as they are, do not, however, invoke an image of the archangel actually expelling this evil. It is the miracula of the archangels that contain descriptions of the deeds of the archangels Michael and Gabriel as exorcists. In the "Ninth Miracle of the Archangel Mi- chael," a Coptic account dating from a period between the fourth and seven centuries, we are told that in a church in Cyprus-whose location is deduced from comparison with pre- vious miracles-a madman is hindering the liturgy. The possessed man is addressing the archangel Michael, crying out, "It is because of you that we left heaven"-"we" obviously meaning devils or ex-angels-"and you exile us from every place on earth, too."44 Then Michael appears, dressed in an imperial robe and with a sceptre in his hand, seizes Satan, and throws him down in the middle of the church. Satan cries out to the archangel to let him go, promising that he will never again enter anyplace that bears Michael's "name." Hearing this, the archangel lets Satan go. Satan exits the church, and the sick are cured.45 From the content of this story, we see that Satan's being driven out and the healing of the madman are equivalents, and that the archangel Michael's method of healing, although without verbal commands, was that of exorcism. Michael behaves in the same manner in legends about the female demon Gilou, who is also forced to confess, as Satan has done, that she may be prevented from harming men (by means of threats or actual violence).46 The second-ranking archangel, Gabriel-Michael's co-archangelos47-also appears in the role of doctor in one of the accounts of his miracles. In his sanctuary in Rome, the archangel Gabriel appears to a sick baker in a dream, addressing him with these words: "I will heal thee so that to everyone shall be manifest the impotence of the Devil and that help of God and of His archangel which protecteth all mankind."48 After this, the archan- gel makes the sign of the cross over the baker and the man is delivered from the "snares of Satan" i.e., healed. We have here a curative action of the archangel Gabriel against the Devil, who was a cause of the baker's illness, although later in the legend it is explained that prayer is the thing that liberates. Following his verbal statement, Gabriel here uses the most powerful weapon for resisting demons, the Christian's victorious sign of Satan's defeat-the sign of the cross.49 43Michaelis Pseli scripta minora, ed.

Because of this widespread use, manifested also in the baptis- mal rites, such practices penetrated even the euchologion, the important liturgical book that was frequently used in the everyday life of Christians. In a magical formula called "Against the Abra"-recorded in euchologia from the twelfth and fifteenth centuries- "proto-archangel" Michael, after arguing with the female demon Abra, who came to do harm to people, casts her out.50 For our investigation, this is yet another example at- testing the existence of the idea of archangels as exilers, here expressed in liturgical prayers. Within the Christian pantheon, archangels-invoked immediately after the principal figures, Christ the Lord and the Virgin-are not, of course, the only mediators and pro- tectors. In the writings of St. Neophytos, for instance, quite a number of saints are given credit for providing protection against demons: St. Alypios is described as a "victor over demons," St. Sabas as a fighter "against passion and demons," St. Nicholas is a "destroyer of demons," while St. Mamas is the healer of "demonic wounds."''51 Another powerful and very popular representative of mankind is St. George, the patron saint of the previously mentioned churches in Famagusta and Pano Lefkara, there being named the Exiler and associated with the archangel. St. George is considered to be the Christian equivalent of Solomon the Cavalier, the most powerful figure in the magic rituals of the Greco-Roman world.52 Along with four archangels-Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel-and other saints, George's name is used to conjure the demons, as shown in certain Greek texts.53 In apocryphal tradition, St. George was occasionally confused with the archangel Mi- chael, for this saint is also a heavenly warrior and reliable fighter against evil. They some- times appear together: In some Coptic legends, Michael, together with St. George, over- throws Diocletian and makes Theodosius emperor.54 In the vision of the emperor Theodosius, George is riding on a horse accompanied by the archangel Michael.55 In another case, following God's command, Michael reassembles and revives St. George's broken body.56 It is thus no surprise to find that the famous exorcist Theodore of Sykeon (d. 613) had a double church in Galatia, Asia Minor, dedicated to these two saints, George and Michael, while the co-patronage of George and Michael of the church in Pano Lef- kara in Cyprus seems less confusing. Both saints were venerated as particularly strong 50L. Arnaud, "I'exorcisme cart t'i;g alppa attribue a saint Gregoire," EO 16 (1913), 293.

The vita of Theodore of Sykeon narrates how a cleric, Solomon, who was troubled by evil spirits, slept in the side chapel of the church of the Archangel, and that he later presented an image there as a token of his recovery.59 This text is full of instances of healing exorcisms that Theodore performed in Sykeon and elsewhere. Often he exer- cised his powers in the church of the Archangel in Germia, famous from literary sources on the archangels.60 Theodore cured there a great number of individuals-men, women and children61-as well as groups of people by means of processions.62 Mass healings were preceded by overnight prayers, while for a single person it was enough to invoke the Holy Protectors-God, the Virgin, the Holy Archangel, and St. George63-then to make a sign of the cross and to command the demon to leave. Although sometimes hesi- tant, the Devil would eventually depart. A physical act was occasionally necessary. Once or twice, Theodore beat upon a possessed man's chest,64 and he had to strongly shake and pull the hair of two women.65 Earlier we saw that the archangel Michael acted in a 57Iconographically, images of riders always have more potent connotations. Those of the archangel are rarer than those of St. George. The earliest known example of an angel on a horse was found in Arilje (1296) within the composition of the Nativity: M. Garidis, "L'ange a cheval dans l'art byzantin,"' Byzantion 42.1 (1972), 37. There is an interesting fresco of the archangel Michael riding a horse in the narthex of Lesnovo (1349), above the entrance to the naos, distinguished also by the red color of the archangel's figure. In all likelihood, it reflects a Constantinopolitan tradition and is based on literary passages from accounts of this archangel's appearances. See S. GabeliC, "Crveni konjaniEki lik arhandjela Mihaila u Lesnovu," Zo- graf 8 (1977), 55-58, fig. 1. The equestrian presentation of the archangel Michael was popular in the fourteenth-fifteenth-century wallpaintings of Crete. The archangel-rider is either in a row of saints in the first zone of the wall decoration, next to other warrior-saints also represented on horses, or within certain compositions from the Cycle of the Archangels (Assembly of the Archangels [in Prines]) and the Fall of Jericho [in Kouneni, Sarakina, Arkalochori, and Prines]).

It should be stressed, however, that not all Byzantine saints had contact with devils through the act of casting them out; devils did not even appear to a number of them. This conclusion was reached by Perikles Joannou on the basis of more than two hundred vitae dating from the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries.66 Generally speaking, in By- zantium the notion of the devil was rather imprecise.67 On various aspects, such as the nature of the devils and their hierarchy, differences and ambiguities arose, ranging from apocryphal and even extreme dualistic positions to moderate and official ones. The main point of difference was the degree of a devil's independence from or of his subordination to God. Naturally, Orthodox thought could not permit Satan's full autonomy, nor its manifestations in the world as such. The church tried to bind and confine the power of demons, though not systematically. The existence of devils and their malicious activities were thus inevitably tolerated. In certain areas, just as in exorcism, Orthodox and alter- native positions expressed very similar beliefs and, as Greenfield stresses, employed al- most identical practices and devices. Due to the general concept of diabology in Byzantine theology-which was inconsis- tently understood and applied-in pictorial art, the presence of devils is perhaps rarer than in literature. Satan gained his most prominent iconographical role within the com- positions of the Temptation of Christ, of Christ Healing the Possessed, of the Last Judg- ment, and the Fall of Satan. Rarely independent, the Fall of Satan was usually attached to the archangels' "history" and was thus illustrated in the iconographical cycle dedicated to the archangels. However, even within this unit this scene does not belong among the popular scenes. Of seventy-four preserved Cycles of the Archangels, from the eleventh to the eighteenth centuries, the Fall of Satan is included only in eight of them. The com- position features the triumph of the archangel Michael and angels over Satan and the fallen angels, sometimes with elements of the struggle between the angels or, when it is somewhat dualistically conceived, with the motif of taking power from Satan (symbolized by Satan's crown). Most commonly, the Byzantine Devil is a dark anthropomorphic male figure with demonic characteristics, such as claws or a tail.68 As for illustrations of the possessed, it is hardly possible to find them if Christ's healing miracles are excluded. Byzantine monumental art, as the Orthodox belief itself, did not favor this theme. Its appearance seems to be restricted to narrative cycles, where it is illustrated as one among other compositions.

It is illustrated within the narrative cycle of this saint in the parecclession of St. Euthymios in Thessaloniki (1303). Euthymios is shown blessing the young man who stands in front of him, with his arms and legs chained, and held by two men.69 Further examples are illustrations from hagiographical cycles of St. Cyril of Alexandria, St. Eustratios (Fig. 7),70 and St. Nicholas. The rarity of illustrations of the possessed can be demonstrated in the cycle dedicated to Nicholas, which is certainly one of the most popular and frequently illustrated saint's lives in Byzantine art. Only six out of fifty-six examples contain the composition of Nicho- las healing the demoniac. There are compositions of this cycle (preserved from the end of the twelfth to the end of the fifteenth century.) As Nancy Sevi~enko points out, the iconography of the scene is based on Christ's healing miracles. On one side of the compo- sition, the saint is standing and raising his right hand in the gesture of blessing, while on the opposite side a nude or half-nude figure of the possessed man is shown, usually standing and with his hands chained behind his back. A black winged spirit may issue from the possessed man's mouth-as in the late-thirteenth-century painting in the church of Nicholas in Agoriane, for example (Fig. 8)-or be shown running away, as in the church of Sts. Constantine and Helena, formerly St. Nicholas, in Ramada, from ca. 1392.71 Within the icongraphy of the archangels, which is both rich in variety and rather well documented, there is only one extraordinary representation of an archangel as exorcist (Fig. 9). This composition differs from the usual iconography of the saint's healing mira- cles, for the madman is shown lying down. Still, its main action is again divided into two sides: the practitioner, the exiler, on the left, and the possessed figure on the right. It is a fresco from the church dedicated to the archangel Michael in the monastery of Les- novo, painted ca. 1346 in the naos, which features an archangel's healing of the possessed monk Michael, i.e., the archangel expelling the demon (i ishcheze ot nego demon). From the inscription we learn the name of the possessed, and also that the event takes place while the monk sleeps in a cave (prished k peshtere i vzleg spashe). The cave is on a shore, and a three-aisled church, certainly the archangel's, is in the background. The setting of this unidentified archangel's shrine by the water suggests that the literary inspiration for such a composition might have originated in Constantinople or Asia Minor, where the cult of the archangels was closely connected with water. In Lesnovo, we see a vision of a certain monk Michael, who is visited during his therapeutic dream by the shrine's holy doctor, the archangel. It is an illustration of the 69T.

The archangel (Michael?) is depicted immediately outside the cave blessing with his right hand, while carrying a staff in the other. He is attired in antique robes. The monk, dressed in the mega schema habit, lies on his back inside the cave. He is lifting one hand toward the archangel. A small, black, naked, and winged devil with a tail comes out of monk Michael's mouth. The devil looks toward the archangel, lifting both hands in his direction, while one of his legs remains in the monk's mouth. The monk Michael has his eyes open, which calls to mind passages in Theodore of Sykeon's vita in which it is specifically mentioned that during the exor- cistic rite the possessed shall see, with their own eyes, how the devil emerges out of their mouths.72 Quite similarly, in one of the healing miracles ascribed to St. Luke of Steiris in his vita, after drawing the demon out of the patient's open mouth, Luke significantly asks, "Do you see your enemy?" and immediately declares, "Now you are released from the one who tyrannizes you."73 The Lesnovo artist possibly expressed this detail realisti- cally, being aware of the fact that to see the departed demon is the finale of an exorcistic process and a mark or proof of its fulfillment. The other monk represented in the fresco at Lesnovo may perhaps be the same monk Michael, painted for the second time, but his identity is still uncertain, since the textual source for this composition is unfortunately not known.74 The vision of the monk Michael in Lesnovo has no preserved medieval analogies. A later copy of this fresco has survived as one of the scenes on an icon of Christ with the archangels Michael and Gabriel and the Cycle of the Archangels, which was painted in 1626, most probably in the Lesnovo monastery. Its painter changed only the appearance of the second monk, presenting him as a bust. All other details, including the small figure of the devil, correspond to the fresco from Lesnovo.75 Unique representations of angels and defeated demons survive on the capitals of the church of Markov manastir near Skopje (1376). Next to fourteen flying angels, whose hands are upraised, two demons with monkeylike bodies are shown. (Figs. 10 and 11) One demon is on a leash held by an angel. In accordance with the apocryphal commen- tary of the liturgy attributed to St. Gregory the Theologian, angels are here depicted lifting the roof of the church, so that during the service prayers can reach heaven. Pre- viously, as the same text describes, a demon tried to obstruct the liturgy, preventing the people from participating, and was expelled by the angel. Hence in Markov manastir demons are deliberately painted on the capitals of the east columns that are in the sanctu- ary of the church.76 72Festugibre, Vie de Thdodore de Sykeo^n, chaps. 84 and 86. 73Connor, Hosios Loukas (as above, note 32), 137. 74On the fresco of the archangel healing the mad monk Michael, which belongs to the Cycle of the Archan- gels, cf.

This episode, whose, perhaps, cautious form is illustrated in Markov manastir, received its detailed artistic expression at a much later date. Nikolai Pokrovskij describes how, in the altar space of the church of John the Baptist in Jaroslav (second half of the seven- teenth century), as part of the composition representing St. Gregory the Theologian's commentary on the liturgy, an angel is painted as defeating Satan, who stands behind the crowd attending the service." In Markov manastir it is only angels and demons that are presented, chosen in order to stress an apocryphal role of the angels during the liturgical service. The same exorcistic episode-set during the liturgy, showing an angel arguing with the devil, who stands in the doorway-is to be found in a Greek manuscript from 1600 housed at the Vatican Library (no. 2137, fol. 7r). According to a new investiga- tion, it originates from Crete.78 The miniature also shows the officiating priest, a deacon, a hegoumenos, and, among some other details, the open roof of the sanctuary (Fig. 12). Both images from Lesnovo (the fresco from ca. 1346 and the icon from 1626), the painted capitals in Markov manastir (1376), the miniature from the Greek manuscript (1600), the composition from the church in Jaroslav (seventeenth century), and, in terms of its epithet, the icon of the archangel Gabriel Xorinos from Cyprus, testify to the belief in the archangels as healer-exorcists, which is a comparatively rare and little-known role for the archangels. Although chronologically late and rare, it belongs to a distinct aspect of the cult of the archangels as miraculous healers, which did not assume major impor- tance within Byzantine angelology. Michael, foremost, and in certain regions Gabriel, also, in the early stages of their cult enjoyed considerable reputations as healer-physicians, along with their other tasks. Michael's curative role is most clearly reflected in the veneration of this archangel as a protector of public hospitals, michaelions, attested in the fifth and sixth centuries. In addi- tion to a church, such sanctuaries had a bath and a hospital or shelter for the sick and poor. The custom of spending the night in a shrine in the hope of a cure, an instance of which we see represented in Lesnovo, was a popular method of faith healing practiced there. As the medical cult associated with the archangel Michael, and incubation in par- ticular, was strongly reminiscent of pagan deities, the church fathers neglected it. Not one affirmative commentary on the healing function of the archangels written by an early Christian theologian is known.79 Preventing any infringement upon the idea of Christ as the main thaumatourgos, early condemnations of the angels' cult-with the archangel Mi- (1980) (Kraljevo), 121, passim.
