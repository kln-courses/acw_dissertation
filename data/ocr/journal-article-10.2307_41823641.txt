Martin Schongauer, Tribulations of St Anthony , engraving, 3 1 2 x 230 mm (London, British Museum) .</page><page sequence="2">Schongauer's Tribulations of St Anthony Its Iconography and Influence on German Art Jean Michel Massing When Grünewald painted the devils attacking St Anthony on one of the wings of the Isenheim altarpiece (fig. 122) he was following the description of the temptation of the saint as first set down in the ninth chapter of the Vita Antonii of Athanasius and codified in later accounts. 1 Athanasius's text, known in the Middle Ages mainly in Evagrius's translation, records how the saint was living in a sepulchral cave when the Devil and his consorts came to attack him and left him half-dead. A friend found him lying on the ground and brought him home. Recovering con- sciousness, the saint asked to be taken back to fight these enemies, who then further provoked him in the form of beasts. The place was found to be filled with lions, bears, leopards, bulls, wolves, scorpions and serpents which attacked according to their different natures. St Anthony, however, was not disturbed by these creatures which were driven away by the apparition of Christ.2 Athanasius's story was popularized in several vernacular translations; it is also found in abbreviated form in works such as Vincent of Beauvais's Speculum historíale and the Abbreviatio in Gestis et Miraculis Sanctorum and also, of course, in Jacopo da Voragine's Golden Legend. When these collections were made in the thirteenth century the devil had assumed forms quite different from those prescribed in the demonology of the Fathers of the Church. Devils were not simply envisaged as specific animals ; it was their particular bestial nature which was emphasized along with I would like to thank Dr E. McGrath for her help. their characteristic mode of attack. The Legenda aurea reflects this response to the ambiguities found in early patristic sources. Jacopo da Voragine mentions only that the devils returned as animals to attack the saint with horns, claws and teeth.3 As in this text, the devils in Grünewald's painting use their teeth and nails to attack the hermit and deprive him of his attributes, the very symbols of his power ; how- ever, the words on the cartellino , fixed to the tree trunk in the lower right corner, testify to a direct use of the Vita Antonii. 4 That this painting should have had a rich, even complex literary background is hardly surprising, since St Anthony was the founder of the order that commissioned it. The texts which record the attack on the saint pro- vide few very precise descriptive details upon which an artist could draw. For his illustration of the event Grünewald relied on the Italian formula first found in connection with St Anthony in Gherardo Stamina's fresco in the Castellani Chapel in Santa Croce in Florence.5 His specific model is closer to the panel by the Maestro dell'Osservanza, a follower of Sassetta, which shows St Anthony being beaten by two devils.6 Here the saint is lying on the ground, leaning on his right arm ; the pose is similar to that of Grünewald's figure, except that the left arm is in a modified form of the traditional gesture of protec- tion. Also, the devil behind the saint is raising both arms to one side to hit him with greater force; this attitude, if not its function, is close to that of the i.

Further, the second devil in the Sienese picture holds both arms over his head to strike Anthony and this gesture, as well as the position of his legs, have a precise parallel in Griinewald's painting. It was of course only when the Isenheim altarpiece was fully opened that the scene of the attack on St Anthony was visible. Then it was matched, on the other side of the corpus , by the Meeting of Anthony with Paul the Hermit , a subject reflecting another aspect of monastic life, its serenity. The sculpted figure of St Anthony in the centre was flanked by those of Augustine and Jerome, patrons of the order of Antonite monks, and exemplary models for the canons.7 Griinewald's polyptych was painted for the Church of the Isenheim monastery during the first two decades of the sixteenth century. The fact that the church was divided by a screen, with the choir reserved only for the monks, explains the confusion in early accounts as well as the obscurity which sur- rounded this, Griinewald's most important commis- sion, until its transfer to Colmar at the time of the French Revolution.8 The earliest plan of the church shows that the altarpiece could be seen only through a narrow door in the screen, and even then from quite a distance.9 The curative powers of the saint, or perhaps the beneficial effect upon pilgrims to an Antonine monastery of a better diet, may account for the richness of the order and of the Isenheim pre- ceptory in particular.10 Certainly the church was lavishly adorned;11 in front of the choir screen, on the north side of the central opening, was an altarpiece with a carved corpus and wings by Martin Schongauer: on its outside was the Annunciation , on the inside a Nativity flanked by St Anthony protecting Jean d'Orliac, who was elected preceptor of the con- vent in 1466 and who was succeeded on his death in 1490 by Guido Guersi, the patron of the Isenheim altarpiece.12 Here Anthony, the Egyptian hermit, appears with his traditional attributes, the staff with the Tau and the pig,13 as well as with a book bound as a Beutelbuch (girdle book) . 14 This feature is likewise included in another work by Schongauer, done more or less at the same time and perhaps also for the Isen- heim An toni tes, the engraving of the aerial Tribula- tions of St Anthony (fig. 121). Martin Schongauer, son of a goldsmith, was born in Colmar in the early 1450s. His exact date of birth is unknown, but he is recorded as having matri- culated at the University of Leipzig in 1465. 15 As students entered university at the age of twelve or thirteen, it can be assumed that Martin was born shortly after the middle of the century, in 1452 or 1453. He did not renew his registration the following year, probably because he became apprenticed to Caspar Isenmann, Colmar's leading painter. During 7. For the sculptures, see R.

He must have begun making engravings at about this time, but his prints, unfortunately, are undated. Their chronology is therefore based on the existence of dated copies, and on the internal evi- dence provided by the artist's technical and stylistic development.18 Ten of Schongauer's engravings are signed with a monogram which differs from the version he used later; the outer lines of the 4M' are here vertical instead of being slightly slanted. These ten prints also share certain stylistic and technical features, such as an undisciplined modelling, which reveal an artist not yet fully master of his craft, and still exploring its potential.19 The aerial Tribulations of St Anthony is one of these early prints, and was presumably made around 1470. 20 Here Schongauer has suc- ceeded in conveying the serene patience of the saint in the face of the fruitless violence of his opponent by building up the composition around him. But if the sharp, irregular forms of the devils present a rich and expressive texture, they can hardly be said to convey a very convincing spatial effect. At the same time the graphic quality of the print, although vigorous, does not have the control - the systematic network of lines - found in later works, even if the nervous, comma-shaped strokes seem appropriately expressive of the dramatic subject-matter. The fact that the attack on the saint is shown tak- ing place in the air can be related to the description of Anthony's ecstasy in the sixty-fifth chapter of the Vita Antonii of Athanasius : 'Once, for example, when he was about to eat and stood up to pray, about the ninth hour, he felt himself carried off in spirit and - strange to say - as he stood he saw himself, as it were, outside himself and as though guided aloft by certain beings. Then he also saw loathsome and ter- rible beings standing in the air and preventing him from passing through. As his guides offered resistance, the others demanded on what plea he was not accountable to them . . . Then as they brought accusations but could not prove them, the way was opened up to him free and unhindered and presently he saw himself approaching, so it seemed to him, and halting with himself, and so he was the real Anthony again.'21 The Neoplatonic tone of the Greek text, which was written in Egypt at the end of the fourth century, explains the reference to, and emphasis on, good and bad spirits, which in the Middle Ages were understood as angels and devils.22 Athanasius goes on to describe the power of the 123.

Bosch, (A Terminus ante quem for two of Martin Schongauer's Crucifixions', The Art Bulletin , LXIV, 1982, pp. 632-35, who has shown that the traditional dating of Schongauer's Passion engravings (c. 1480) must be adjusted 'to the middle third of the 1470s, at the latest'. 19.

Anthony, he writes, 'was astonished to see against how many we battle and what labours a person has to pass through the air; and he remembered that this is what the apostle said - according to the prince of the power of the air ( Ephes . 2, 2). Herein precisely lies the Enemy's strength, that he fights and tries to stop those who pass through.'23 The ambiguities contained in this text, as well as the visionary aspects of the tribulation explain why only a small number of illustrations of this passage exist, and also the great variations found within them. An anonymous Milanese sketchbook probably made around 1400, which contains many scenes from Anthony's life, shows the saint on a throne, sur- rounded and also carried by angels ; some of these, armed with swords and small round shields combat the devils who seek to harm the saint.24 On the other hand, in the illustrated life of St Anthony completed in 1427 at Saint Antoine de Viennois, the chief house of the Hospitallers of St Anthony, the episode has been divided into three scenes whose captions orig- inate from a single sentence in Evagrius's Latin translation of the Vita Antonii (chapter 65). 25 In the first miniature Anthony is depicted 'caught up in spirit, discovering how difficult is the way to heaven on account of the multitude of man's enemies and of their wrestlings' ; behind him three angels on one side and three devils on the other fight over his alter ego.26 A panel from a Spanish altarpiece from Monzon, painted by Jaime Ferrer II, is probably contemporary with the miniature. In this picture the praying saint is carried by two angels while devils on the ground try to catch him with their snares.27 This version of the subject gained some popularity in the last thirty years of the fifteenth century, in woodcuts illustrating the German editions of the Vitae Patrum (fig. 123), but these woodcuts are all later than Schongauer's print.28 The earliest work to depict one of the devilish assaults described in the Vita Antonii 29 must be the 1 24.

It has also been claimed that two capitals at Vezelay, on the eighth pier of the North side of the nave, represent the earliest illustration in western art of the Temptation and of the Tribulation of St Anthony .30 But even if one were to concede that the sculpture on the east side depicts St Anthony being beaten by devils31 - and this seems debatable - there is no doubt that the capital on the north side (fig. 124) illustrates not the vision of Anthony but the fall of Simon Magus. As the scene has, since Viollet-le-Duc, been more or less univer- sally accepted as a representation of St Anthony (either during his vision, or, more tentatively, simply when torn by devils),32 and no alternative theme has been convincingly proposed, it seems worth pausing here to establish its real subject.33 The apocryphal Acts of Peter describe how the rivalry between Simon the Magician and the Apostle reached its culmination with Simon's decision to demonstrate his power by flying over the hills of Rome - a feat which he actually performed until the prayers of Peter brought him to the ground.34 Later compilations, the Passio sanctorum apostolorum Petri et Pauli and the Passio apostolorum Petri et Pauli , add fur- ther details: that the magician's flight began from a tower, that Paul accompanied Peter and asked him to act against the sorcerer, and the precise way in which the saint conjured up the devils who were carrying his enemy.35 These details, adopted by medieval authors, helped to formulate the iconogra- phy of the fall of the magician.36 To either side of the Vézelay capital (fig. 124) two bearded men, one of whom is clearly tonsured, are shown with their hands clasped in an attitude of prayer. Before them, high in the air, a figure clad in rich costume is being precipitated from a tall building which is clearly intended as a tower. The artist has illustrated the moment when, the power of the devils ceasing to function, Simon comes to fall.37 It is notable that the embroidered dress of the sorcerer is similarly represented on another of the capitals, probably of a slightly later date : this depicts the two apostles resurrecting a young man and, next to this, Simon Magus before Nero.38 The subjects of the fall of the magician and Peter's victory over Nero, are not uncommon in Roman- esque art.39 The attempted flight of Simon Magus, and its dramatic conclusion, are carved on capitals at Au tun and on the Porte Miégeville at Toulouse. Outside France the fall of Simon Magus is depicted on the portal of Ripoll and on the archivolt of the porch of Sessa Aurunca.40 In England it appears on 30. See Cuttler, op. cit., p. 36.

In both works Simon is carried through the air by devils ; the central tower and the praying saints also appear, as in the Vézelay capital.42 The identification of the subject of the Vézelay capital makes it evident that the theme of the aerial tribulations of St Anthony does not appear in art before the end of the fourteenth or even the early years of the fifteenth century. The question, how- ever, remains as to whether Schongauer's engraving represents the moment in St Anthony's vision when he battles against the Enemy who tried to stop him as he 'saw him entering the air and struggling until he became free'. Most probably this passage, indeed this very line, is in fact the text which inspired Schongauer : certainly this would explain the omis- sion of the angels, or rather the substitution of devils for them.43 The Vita Antonii , as well as the numerous abbreviated lives of the saint, give no information about an attack in the air. An Arab legend, translated by Alphonsus Bonhominis in 1341, des- cribes how the devil, disguised as a queen, tries to corrupt the hermit, but when he recognizes in her his old Enemy, the woman is turned into a black mountain belching fire and terrible fumes. At this moment the devilish inhabitants of the queen's city attack the saint and beat him, dragging him ignominiously through the desert. In another legend, the devils, after beating Anthony, pull the saint from the top of the mountain to the valley and then back up through the valley again, but this text cannot be considered the source of the image of the aerial attack ; for however much the saint is hauled about the desert, valley or mountains, he is nowhere elevated into the air.44 That Schongauer's print does in fact illustrate the battle in the air is clear from the attitudes of the devils, some hanging as they try to stop the saint in his ascent, and others beating him down with their clubs. This interpretation is supported by the inscription on a sixteenth-century copy (fig. 126), which reads that man does not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world : 'Non est nobis colluctatio adversus carnem, et sanguinem, sed adversus principes, et potestates, adversus mundi rectores tenebrarum' ( Ephes . 6. 12).45 The copyist was evidently aware of the subtleties of the iconogra- phy, as this specific passage from Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians had been used and quoted by Evagrius in his translation of the description of Anthony's ecstasy in the Vita Antonii. Such an identification of the sub- ject is also confirmed by the embroideries, based on Schongauer's image, found on a chasuble which can 41. For this sculpture, see J. G.

The other inscription, Non coronabitur nisi qui legitime certaverit, can be traced to the second Epistle to Timotheus (II : Tm. 2.5).</page><page sequence="9">228 SGHONGAUER'S 'TRIBULATIONS OF ST ANTHONY' be dated to the second quarter of the sixteenth cen- tury.46 In this work, now in the Catholic church of Gillrath near Aachen, Anthony is seen being attacked by two devils hanging from his clothing, while above is a pair of angels, each fighting against a demon - one of which is easily recognisable as the lizard-shaped creature in the print. Here the ecstasy of the saint was illustrated by taking as a starting point a reversed copy of Schongauer's engraving and adding to the scene the angels which are described as present at this event in the Vita Antonii. An earlier illustration from a cycle of pictures by the Master of the Kaufbeurer Sakristeischrank must also be taken into consideration; this represents different scenes from the life of the saint in chronological order. The panel which shows Anthony attacked by three devils (fig. 131) is here given an inscription, 'hie entfuren in die tiefel in die luP, which suggests an allusion to the ecstasy scene described in chapter sixty-five of the Vita Antonii.47 That this image is based on Schongauer's print is indicated not only by the pose and facial features of the saint, but also by the characteristics of the devils tormenting him. In elaborating upon the idea of St Anthony's ecstasy, in which the saint saw himself struggling in the air with his enemies, Schongauer may have recal- led how lévitation by devils is described so often in medieval texts.48 Adolph Goldschmidt specifically connected the engraving with an illustration of the torment of St Guthlac, carried by devils high into the air and down to Hell; in this illustration - a miniature from an early thirteenth-century roll - two devils hold the saint by his shoulders and his feet, while others beat him with knotted whips. However, even if the Life of Guthlac was modelled on the Vita Antonii ,49 there is no particular link between these images. The similarity is generic and can be paral- leled in quite a number of other works. An example of course is the capital from Vezelay with the Fall of Simon Magus (fig. 124), as well as later represen- tations of this subject ; others can be found in scenes from completely different contexts with souls or human beings carried off by devils - for example, a striking illustration of Radbod, King of Friesland transported in this way appears in a manuscript of the Chroniques of Hainault for which the painter Guil- laume Wielant was paid in July 1468. 50 In all of these works the devils and their victims are in the air ; in a number they are also clinging and hanging in attitudes similar to those used by Schongauer. The major difference which can be observed is that in Schongauer's print Anthony remains upright, as he is likewise depicted in scenes of his lévitation, and in the manner of the subject of the Vision of Mary Magdalen , an image which may have been influential on Schongauer's conception.51 Connections have also been made with illustrations of St Michael com- batting the devils by followers of Van Eyck.52 But here again we are dealing with a general relationship to the motif of a saint trampling devils, rather than 46.

Parallels can certainly be found in the work of the Master E.S., a direct pre- decessor of Schongauer: two prints showing the archangel fighting the demons, dated to within the 1460s, are certainly as close as the Netherlandish pictures to Schongauer's image. 53 More persuasive is the proposal made by Cuttler that the motif of a standing saint attacked by perse- cuting devils derives from the iconography of St Anthony himself. He related Schongauer's print to a lost work by the Master E.S.54, known from a num- ber of slightly later woodcuts (fig. 125) and engrav- ings.55 In this composition the saint stands on a fire fanned with bellows by an armed demon. Above, a winged devil brandishes his lance, while a com- panion, on the other side, has grasped the hermit's beard with one hand while he tries to hit the saint with a club; a fourth devil is hanging in front of Anthony and catching his hair with one hand - an attitude which Schongauer copied. It is probable that this lost woïk antedates the Tribulations engrav- ing. It is thus evident that Schongauer's contribution to the iconography of the subject was the choice of the aerial setting rather than the actual visual for- mula of the attack. It should be noted too that repre- sentations of the standing saint surrounded by devils - and indeed by flying devils - appeared in both paintings and miniatures as early as the beginning of the fifteenth century, for example in the work of the Rohan master.56 It was not so much the general formula but rather the specific characterisation of the devils which made Schongauer's work so influential.57 This certainly seems to have been its attraction to Michelangelo. In his Life of Michelangelo Vasari tells us that the artist made a drawing after the print and then coloured it. 58 Condivi's Vita records the same anecdote, except that he claims that Michelangelo's copy was on 125.

It was claimed by one author that Michelangelo's coloured drawing was in Milan at the beginning of the century,61 and two attempts were made to identify it with extant paintings. Neither of these is acceptable. The first claim, made by Gualandi in 1840, concerns a picture then, and presumably still, in a Bolognese collection, which Hoogewerff attributed to a seventeenth-century Flemish follower of David Teniers and which is certainly later than Michelangelo.62 The second copy, formerly in the collection of Henri-Joseph- François, Baron Triquet de Triqueti, who bought it in Pisa in 1837, was sold in London in i960, when the attribution did not carry much conviction, to judge from the price it fetched. The most one can say about this work is that it testifies to the popularity in the seventeenth century of Schongauer' s fantastic composition.63 126. M.

ANTHONIUS ) is shown near his hermitage, set between the mountains in the foreground. The inscription - Qui non est tentatus quid seil? ( Sir., 34. 9) - is taken from the end of the passage on dreams in Eeclesiasticus , while the Latin text at the top - Varie sunt afflictiones iustorum, de omnibus autem iis liberabit illos dominus . Psalm - is taken from the Psalms. Israel van Meckenem was particularly interested in the forms given to the various devils, as is evident from his use of them in his own work.71 In the Madonna on the Crescent , two of the six angels fight devils, at least one of which is directly derived from 128.

Schongauer,72 while in another of his prints the wicked woman who beats her husband is egged on by a devil whose physiognomy is derived from the same creature.73 Schongauer's print was certainly well known in Nuremberg. In one of the woodcuts from the famous Nuremberg Chronicle of 1493, The Fall of Antichrist , all three devils reflect their counterparts in the engraving : the two lower devils are simply adapted to the new subject, while that on the left combines different features from two or three of Schongauer's devils, with the upper part of his body and long, pointed nose borrowed from the lizard-like creature.74 As for Dürer, even though Schongauer 130.

Clearly, however, the artist did not under- stand the aerial character of the tribulation, even though it was evident in his immediate model, a woodcut by Hans Springinklee from Koberger's Hortulus Animae printed by E. Reypus at Nuremberg in 1518 (fig. 1 29). 78 This woodcut is clearly based on a reversed copy of the Schongauer ; the prominent feature of the scapulary and the devil hanging onto it testify to a direct dependence. Springinklee's woodcut was also the model for a Swabian glass roundel with the inscription Martinus Widman Pfarrer Cappel and the date 1532 (fig. 130); here the pose of the saint and that of the devil pulling down the scapulary are conclusive.79 Not understanding that the vision was meant to take place in the air the designer of the Freiburg window reverted to a traditional inconographic for- mula. This is also the case with other artists such as the Master of the Kaufbeurer Sakristeischrank, active from the early 1470s until the 1490s. He is best known for his panels in the chapel of St Blaise at Kaufbeuren, ten of which represent scenes from the life of St Anthony.80 One, as we have seen, illustrates chapter sixty-five of the Vita Antonii , showing the ecstasy of the saint, (fig. 131) but another panel by him, now in the Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts in Brussels (fig. 132) is also directly dependent on Schongauer's print.81 This is suggested by the physio- gnomy of the saint and some details of his dress and 131.

Unlike Michelangelo, or even Israel van Meckenem, the Bavarian artist was evidently not attracted by the complexity of Schongauer's composition, its rich textures, or its fantastic forms; he confined himself to borrowing individual gestures which he adapted to his own formal vocabulary and to his rather simplistic con- ception of the nature of the devil. This also involved what one might call an iconographie regression, since the subtleties in Schongauer's imagery are ignored. The same is true of a drawing by Jörg Schweiger which shows St Anthony being dragged about by a considerable number of demons (fig. 133). Halm rightly saw in this the general influence of Schongauer; he might have also added that some of the devils have direct counterparts, for example that pulling the hermit's clothing or that tearing his hair.82 Another work, however, seems to capture 1 34.

Schweiger, see pp. 101-02).</page><page sequence="16">SCHONGAUER'S TRIBULATIONS OF ST ANTHONY* 235 something more of the spirit of Schongauer's expres- sive imagery. Nicolaus Manuel Deutsch's painting of 1520 (fig. 1 34) 83 used a traditional Italian formula for the attack of the devils on St Anthony,84 but enlivened it dramatically by showing the saint falling under the weight of his tormentors, visibly suffering as one of the creatures tugs his beard. This devil of course recalls Schongauer's hanging demons; and the relationship with the print is underlined in the characterisation of the four other monsters - of the same kind, if now from quite a different artistic generation. Most obviously related, certainly, is the descendant of the familiar lizard-like demon with the long, pointed nose. The picture is an eloquent testimony to the lasting influence of these products of Schongauer's imagination on demoniac imagery right up until the time of the Reformation. All of these 'borrowings', a good number of which have not previously been noted, indicate the import- ance of the print in popularizing specific motifs, such as the attitude of the falling angels; but their role in establishing a new iconography of the devil is par- ticularly significant. In his painting (fig. 122) Grünewald gave his devils bestial characteristics - the Golden Legend , after all, catalogues the horns, teeth, paws and nails with which they attacked St Anthony - but superimposed these upon a basically human form. Schongauer, some forty years before, produced by contrast what might be seen as a more modern conception of the devil by sometimes depart- ing quite freely from anything anthropomorphic; two of his most prominent demons even terminate in fish- or insect-like tails. This feature of course appealed to Michelangelo, as we know from the story of the fish-market. Still more important, perhaps, is Schongauer's contribution to the iconography of St Anthony ; after him the attack in the air becomes one of the standard ways of representing not only the saint's ecstasy, but all kinds of assaults on him by devils. A woodcut by Cranach dated 1506 (fig. 135) illustrates this, adapting the formula to an earlier one whereby the saint is shown lying down.85 So too does 135. Lucas Cranach the Elder, Tribulations of St Anthony , woodcut, 400 x 268 mm (London, British Museum). an anonymous German panel painting, probably made around 1520; although the link with Schongauer's print is unspecific, the composition could not have been conceived without some know- ledge of it.86 The influence of Schongauer's print can likewise be traced to the Netherlands, where it even served to modify the saint's legend. In his fundamental study of Bosch, Dire Bax was able to show how the anonymous Dutch translation of the life of St Anthony in the Golden Legend included an extra line not found in the Latin original or in any other abbre- 83.

But then, he added, 'They cast him up into the air, they hurled him down again, in such a manner that they had almost brought him to death'.88 This detail, first found in an edition of 1478, can only have been inspired by a visual source more or less directly connected with Schongauer's imagin- ative invention. 87.
