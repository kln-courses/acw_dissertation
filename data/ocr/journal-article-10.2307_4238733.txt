<plain_text><page sequence="1">PATRONAGE AND THE VISUAL ENCOMIUM DURING THE PONTIFICATE OF URBAN VIII: THE IDEAL PALAZZO BARBERINI IN A DEDICATORY PRINT John Beldon Scott A n engraved folio sheet in the Barberini Collection of the Vatican Library (fig. 1), designed in Rome by one Orazio Busini in 1631, rivals the most complicated and revealing iconographic curiosities produced in the period of Baroque encomiastic imagery., Three bees in the upper left corner denote the family of the reigning pope, Urban VIII Barberini. This seal, with the radiating initial T, establishes the dedication to the pope's nephew, Don Taddeo, whom Urban, as announced by the inscription around the circumfer- ence, had appointed prefect of Rome in the same year indicated in the lower right of the engraving.2 The crowned column to the left refers to Taddeo's wife, Donna Anna Colonna, whose family coat-of-arms carries a similar device (fig. 2).3 Both plan and elevation recall the new Barberini palace, begun by Carlo Maderno, which by this time had reached a significantly advanced stage of construction. The tripartite divi- sion and projecting upper story of the loggia-like central block resemble the palace faqade as built (fig. 3). A bee-shaped weather vane on the roof and the shield above the central door of the portico support this identification, as do the parterre plots below, where plantings take the form of bees, suns, tiaras, and cardinals' hats, in addition to Barberini and Colonna arms.4 I wish to thank Robert Alexander, Francesca Consagra, Frederick Hammond, Irving Lavin, Louise Rice, and Patricia Waddy, all of whom contributed significantly to the research and completion of this study. In the course of preparing the text for publication, it was a delight to discover that Joseph Connors, too, had encountered, in a rather different context, the obscure author of our en- graving, Orazio Busini. The results of Connors's research on Busini's early career appear here in the appendix. I The only known copy of the final state is in the Fondo Barberini of the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana (BAV), Stamp. Barb., X.I.31, f. 25. It measures 48.6 x 34.1 cm.

Little is known of the engraver, Daniel Widman [Vidman], but a 1652 contract between Giovanni Domenico De Rossi, of the Roman print publishing firm, and him indicates that he was active at least until midcentury. He seems to have specialized in lettering and the copying of maps. His brother or cousin, Giorgio, was the son of Giovanni Vidman, a German baker living in Rome. F.

It may be possible, nevertheless, to discern the meaning and function of the sheet by identifying its signs and placing it within the context of Renaissance architectural theory, Roman encomiastic imagery, and innovative Barberini patronage. 1. Ideal versus Real The engraving maintains an absolute bilateral symmetry in the configuration of rooms, as we can see more clearly in a seventeenth-century tracing that excludes everything but the plan (fig. 4).6 This balance and uniformity could not be achieved in the actual building, which, based on Maderno's original design, needed to take into account many practical exigencies (fig. 5). Moreover, one plan is almost square, enclosing a courtyard, whereas the other forms an H-shaped configuration. The main axis of Busini's palace penetrates from the faqade, through an oval entrance hall, under an interior loggia, to the courtyard, and finally into a gallery leading to the garden plots. Maderno's design, by contrast, cannot be traversed along a central axis at ground level.7 Instead, the visitor must turn left or right to stairs ascending to the piano nobile salone (fig. 5, Si and S2). Busini's version conforms to the Renaissance ideals of balance and proportion, whereas the built palace displays many inconsistencies de- termined by the sloping topography of the site. We can appreciate the grandiosity of Busini's Palazzo Barberini if we compare it to the Farnese palace, the most imposing secular residence of the Roman cinquecento (fig. 6).8 Palazzo Farnese has but a single file of rooms flanking the courtyard, while the engraved Barberini design shows an extra inserted range of spaces on each side of the cortile, accom- modating pendant fountains, chapels, stairs, and apsidial rooms.9 The emphatic axiality and uniformity in arrangement of rooms seen in Busini's plan com- prised the rarely achieved ideal of Renaissance palace design.'0 Such detachment from untidy realities, however, often proved difficult to accomplish except in the illustrations of architec- tural treatises, as we can see, for example, in Serlio's plan for a villa (fig. 7).11 In his Quattro libri Palladio, too, presents ideal plans of absolute symmetry, even when the actual buildings 5Waddy 1973, 163. By the summer of 1631 the palace was at an advanced stage of construction, the vault of the salone having been closed already in September 1630. M. A.

On the advantages of this arrangement of rooms, see Waddy 1990, 16-18. A relatively new development in Roman palace architecture, this feature shows how Busini's design is progressive in some of its components. The oval entrance hall on the transverse axis, the pen- dant stairs leading to separate apartments, and the pro- jecting upper story of the central block also represent contemporary ideas in palace architecture. Similar fea- tures appear in the actual palace as built and may reflect Busini's knowledge of some aspects of Maderno's design. 'OH.

In his print, Busini takes as his point of departure this Platonizing tradition in architectural rendering. More remarkable than any formal aspect of the engraved plan, however, is the symbol- ism of the rooms. The two chambers on either side of the entryway carry dedications to Saints Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure, standing for letters and arms, respectively-although the cannon placed between the fagade piers might suggest the dominance of the latter.'3 Passing into the oval room with eight interior columns labeled as the Beatitudes, the visitor finds doors, left and right, leading to the fountain rooms and the chapels dedicated to the Trium- phant and Militant Church.14 The flanking stairs entered from under the interior courtyard loggia carry the names of the Patriarch Jacob and Saints Romuald and Dominic, all of whom, appropriately, had visions of heavenly ladders. Four moderately sized chambers, positioned at the front and back between the central block and the outside suites of rooms, contain inscriptions of the four seasons and to the Church Fathers, both Western and Eastern. The twelve rooms of the main apartment suites contain glyphs of the zodiacal constellations. This combination of ecclesiological and cosmological elements introduces an important theme for the overall meaning of the print-the harmonious relationship between the visible world of the created universe and that of the moral order established by God. 2. Plan as Microcosm, or the Iconography of Ichnography The assemblage of sundry symbols and ideas may leave the impression that the iconographer failed to arrive at any true synthesis of thought. Busini's sheet does contain some unassimilated components, but the middle section of the composition provides a unifying theme. We see superimposed over the center of the plan a group of interlocking geometric shapes-circle, triangle, square, hexagon, and oval-yet without consistent correspondence to the architec- tural parts. In the middle of this configuration appears a Mercator projection of the earth, while, to the right of the Colonna column, an inscription provides useful identification: "A single globe of the universe, the chain of the four elements." The four piers supporting the cortile loggia form the "chain." Like Plato's world soul (Timaeus 35A-D), Busini's circle com- prises three sections, with the cryptic label, "He weighs out with three things." The theological 12 The disparity between the ideal and the real in Palladio's architecture emerges especially in his palace designs, which, in the Quattro libri, appear symmetrical and regular in the distribution of rooms but, in reality, often had to conform to preexisting irregularities in the urban topography.

The three words "sum qui sum" appear inside the angles of the triangle at the points where they penetrate the hexagon, just as God uttered to Moses in the Book of Exodus (3:14), "I am who I am." Centered on the two apsidial rooms and the oval configuration of the en- trance hall columns, the triangle's vertices reveal Busini's effort to point out a hidden trinity of spaces within the distribution of palace rooms.'5 The print's imagery thus posits a con- junction among God, world, geometry, and architecture. Man as the microcosm or "little world" who in his physical parts reflects the larger order of the universe is a perennial concept in premodern Western philosophy'6 and holds a funda- mental position in medical astrology.'7 A print from a late fifteenth-century almanac demon- strates in schematic fashion how the twelve zodiacal components of the heavenly macrocosm influence corresponding parts of the human microcosm (fig. 8).18 Busini's Christ-microcosm, tied into a system of superimposed geometric forms connecting it to the flanking rooms marked with zodiacal glyphs, points to this theo-philosophical tradition.'9 A line paraphrased from Plato's Timaeus, inscribed at the top of the hexagon, unites the theological-cosmological themes with architectural values: "T. All things are arranged in mea- sure and number and weight."20 Here we find explication of the triadic principle of the inscrip- tion around the Mercator projection of the world. The "three things" are therefore the mea- sure, number, and weight through which the creator gave unity and order to the universe. A similar statement appears in the Book of Wisdom, "But thou hast ordered all things in measure, and number, and weight" (Wisdom 11:20), which St. Augustine quotes in his dis- cussion of the number six, as in the six days of creation, taking it to mean that God fashioned the world on numerical principles.21 Busini acknowledges this patristic source in one of the lines inscribed to the left of the column: "The work of six days, the paradise of delight."22 The relationship between God's creation and number furnishes the point of intersection between "The oval entrance hall being larger than the other two rooms, Busini added the dotted lines around the perim- eter of the eight columns to enhance their rather strained correspondence with the two flanking apsidial rooms. 16 A.

Omnia in mensura, et numero, et pondere sunt disposita." Although there is no comparable line in the Timaeus, the dialogic initial "T." must refer to this source. It could be that Busini extracted the maxim from a Latin commentary on Plato's work or that he simply synop- sized this major theme of the dialogue. See especially Timaeus (32B-C, 53B, and 56C), where Plato discusses God's ordering of the elements of which the universe is composed. Busini's line is almost identical to the verse from the Vulgate: "Sed omnia in mensura, et numero, et pondere disposuisti" (Sapientia 11:21). 21 De Civitate Dei (11.30). See W. J. Roche, "Measure, Number and Weight in Saint Augustine," The New Scho- lasticism 15 (1941) 350-76.

God is the architect, the world his edifice. Busini knew the Renaissance interpretations of Vitruvius, as seen in an illustration from Cesariano's edition of 1521, in which a diagram demonstrates the Pythagorean harmony of the spheres (fig. 9).24 The Vitruvian commentator means the figure on the left with its har- monic progression of 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 degrees to correspond on the right with the superimposed geometry showing the matching angular relationships or aspects of the planets represented by the ideal forms of a hexagon (60 degrees), square (90), and triangle (120), all inscribed within the circle of the zodiac.25 Interpreters of Vitruvius noted that the common mathematical structure of all created things binds together the universe. In his edition of the De architectura Daniele Barbaro ex- plains it: "the rules of arithmetic therefore are those which unite music with astrology, be- cause proportion is common and universal in all things subject to being measured, weighed, and numbered."26 Busini's use of the triadic "measure, number, and weight," shows that his theme concerns the philosophical premises of Renaissance architectural theory. How man fits into this scheme is also important for the overall meaning of the print. For Vitruvius, man embodies ideal proportions and geometry, as illustrated in sixteenth-century editions of the ancient treatise, where the extended limbs of the figure with navel in the exact center correspond to the archetypal forms of the circle and square (fig. 10).27 With reference to Vitruvius (3.1), Renaissance theoreticians made this concept a commonplace of humanis- tic thinking about the anthropomorphic nature of architecture: The human body, which is a perfect work made by Almighty God in semblance of his own image, with very great reason is called little world because it contains within itself with the most perfect composition and with the most secure harmony all the numbers, mea- sures, weights, movements, and elements. So that from him principally, and not from some other construction turned out by the hand of God, and from his members was taken the norm and the model to form the temples, the theaters, and all the buildings with all their parts, such as columns, capitals, . . . and every sort of artificial thing.28 Busini's configuration, as displayed between the rows of zodiacal signs, denotes the 23 The classic study of the ordering tenets of Renaissance architectural theory remains Wittkower (as n. 12) esp. 27-32, 101-54.

Even the frieze inscription on the fagade el- evation reiterates the notion of architecture as the vehicle of a sapiential harmony of parts: ORGANUM NUMERICAE SAPIENTIAE-"Instrument of Numerical Wisdom."30 A visual clue to the unifying idea of the sheet appears in the Colonna column, for this contains the module, the standard unit for the arithmetic proportions of classical architec- tural design. Busini's column conforms to Serlian proportions for the Corinthian order-the base, shaft, and capital equal nine diameters.31 The inscriptions flanking the column hint, however obliquely, at a numerical relationship between macrocosm and microcosm-"The earth at once in 3, 4, and 7 parts divided"; "One tripartite house placed in the square"; "Angles within, 3, 4, 7, 13, outside, 4"; "The functions are many, 3, 4, 9, 12"; "The work of six days [like the world], the paradise of delight"; and "Columns together, 8, 12, 24, and many." The eight central and twelve peripheral columns of the oval room, and the twenty-four columns of the fa,ade elevation, positioned in the canonical sequence of orders, now take on more significance. Here these correspondences affirm that the perfectly proportioned palace is the microcosm of the God-constructed universe. Superimposition of the microcosm over an architectural plan suggests Busini's knowl- edge of a specific passage in Scamozzi's L'idea dell'architettura universale. Following a dis- cussion of God as the great architect and microcosm-man as a "little world," Scamozzi ex- plains architectural drawing as the "gift of God" that represents the idea of the architect and provides the means by which "both the terrestrial and celestial worlds are reduced to most small form."32 The text is essentially a gloss on Vitruvius's section (1.2.2) that mentions the three ways of representing a building (plan, elevation, and perspective view) as the ideas or "noble thoughts of the architect. "33 The drawn plan of a building is the "little world," prefig- uring the yet uncreated macrocosm of the full-scale structure existing only in the mind of the inventor. The label MICROCOSMUS in Busini's plan of Palazzo Barberini refers not only to 29Here, as elsewhere, Busini is not too literal in his bor- rowing. Unlike the model for the aspects, his shapes over- lap one another in a disjunctive fashion in order to achieve some correspondence with the configuration of rooms. Even so, most of the geometric lines do not con- form to the major architectural elements. The circle, for example, is centered neither on the overall plan nor on the cortile. 30Vitruvius (10..1-4) uses the term organum to refer to architectonic engines that operate with the guidance of a single workman, as opposed to a machina, which re- quires the application of several men. 31 Serlio, 4:169r. 32V. Scamozzi, L'idea dell'architettura universale (Venice 1615) pt. 1, 38-39, 47. "I disegni che gli antichi chiamarono graphidi, cioe descritione di lineamenti, come dice Vitruvio, sono quelli, per mezo de' quali esplicamo ad altri la volonta nostra, e secondo noi non vengono ad esser piu, che di tre sorti; cioe la pianta, o superficie; l'impiedi, o faccia, &amp; il profilo; &amp; ambedue questi servono allo elevato del corpo dell'edificio: e questa e una via infallibile per conoscer tutte le cose cosi naturali, come artificiali, &amp; anco in parte le sopranaturali: essendo che per mezo del disegno si riduce in picciolissima forma il mondo terrestre, &amp; anco il celeste: intanto, che e l'uno, e l'altro dimostra chiaramente sotto al senso, quasi tutte le cose nella sua vera somiglianza, e manca solo di corporeita, la quale si aspetta al modello. Di modo che per via del disegno si esprime molto facilmente tutto quello, che non pu6 far la moltiplicita delle parole espresse, o descrite in carta; e perci6 a ragione si pu6 dire, che il disegno sia piu tosto dono celeste di dio, che cosa ritrovata dall'ingengno humano." 33 The notion of the unbuilt house in the mind of the architect as the idea of the structure originated with Aristotle (Metaphysics 7.7-8) and was perpetuated by Philo (De Opificio Mundi 5). See E. Panofsky, Idea: A Concept in Art Theory, trans. J. J. S. Peake (Columbia, SC 1968) 27-29. Aquinas (Summa Theologica 1.15.1) stated it plainly: "The house pre-existed in the mind of the architect: and this can be designated as the Idea of the house, because the artist intends to assimilate the house to the same form that he has conceived in his mind." As quoted in Panofsky, 40-41.</page><page sequence="7">PATRONAGE AND THE VISUAL ENCOMIUM 203 cosmic geometry and to the architectural theory derived from it but also to the concept of the scaled drawing.34 Busini's theo-architectural thinking was inspired by more than just the texts of commen- taries on Vitruvius. Even the format of the engraving shows knowledge of the conventions for the illustration of architectural treatises. The stacking of plan and elevation is a common device, as seen, for example, in a plate from the Caporali Vitruvius edition of 1536 (fig. 11), where, as in the seventeenth-century print, a portion of the field remains open for explana- tory text and diagrams." Busini's square plan, displaying a rigidly symmetrical distribution of rooms with interior loggia opening into the cortile and rear gallery leading to the compart- mentalized garden, echoes on a more imposing scale some designs by Serlio (fig. 7)36 Even the idea of the Corinthian column as a dominant element of the sheet recalls the format of such pages as seen, for example, in Palladio's Quattro libri, where the author discusses entasis (fig. 12).37 Notwithstanding its overload of images and symbols, Busini's engraving belongs to a well-established genre of architectural imagery-a type familiar to educated amateurs and princely patrons alike. 3. Perfect Architecture Busini's plan, however, differs from the conventions of the treatise illustrations in the degree to which its creator freights the image with weighty symbolism in the form of geometric ab- stractions, astrological glyphs, and numerous inscriptions. For example, the design has a marked religious tone, as most of the written labels take Christological or ecclesiological form. The idea of creating a perfect building and loading it with symbolic meaning has a famous precedent and, although we cannot be certain it inspired Busini directly, this possible source should not go unacknowledged, for it demonstrates that Busini's plan, however bizarre, is not unique. The same combination of sacred iconography and perfect architecture seen in the ideal plan of Palazzo Barberini was notably formulated in 1604 with the publication of Juan Bautista Villalpando's theoretical reconstruction of Solomon's temple-a project underwritten by Philip II.38 Its author, like Busini, was a priest. A Jesuit mathematician and architect, Villalpando de- veloped his version of the temple from the exegesis of the Book of Ezekiel (40-43), in which the prophet recounts the building described to him by an angel in a vision. The biblical text is detailed, even providing exact measurements, but far from comprehensive in its description and, as critics noted, nowhere mentions that the edifice is the temple. The scripture, moreover, contains a significant number of inconsistencies on points crucial to a precise and complete reconstruction of the building. Thus, much interpretation lies behind Villalpando's engraved plans and elevations of the temple complex, but his work gained widespread attention due to 34 Busini has troubled to include a scale in palmi romani for the imaginary plan. His Palazzo Barberini, at 280 palmi across, is smaller than the actual building, which measures 350 palmi in width. 35 M. Vitruvius Pollio, Architettura con il suo comento et figure. . . , ed. G.

A common sacred ideality provides the primary link between temple and palace. Solomon's temple, as re-created by Villalpando, is perfect architecture because its measurements and shapes came from God himself. God is the architect, and, significantly, He applied Vitruvian principles to the design, at least according to the Jesuit's reading.40 Not only did Villalpando make Solomon's temple a classical building; he declared it to be the first such structure and the origin of all classical forms and proportions. Even the Greeks, so the argument continues, obtained their architectural ideas from this divine archetype. Following a more conventional exegetical tra- dition, Villalpando also equated the temple with the body of Christ and the Christian Church.41 In order to underscore for his reader the divinity of the design, Villalpando reports that when he showed drawings for the temple reconstruction to his teacher, Juan de Herrera, the Spanish royal architect exclaimed, intuitively, that: "He was able to . . . scent something of divine wisdom in the proportions of the architecture, in such a way that . .. he was easily able to judge that this building had been imagined by no human intellect but designed by God himself with infinite wisdom. "42 Herrera's declaration that the temple design showed divine wisdom in its proportions might remind us of the inscription of the top-story frieze of Busini's elevation: "Instrument of Numerical Wisdom." Villalpando's plan, like Busini's, conflates architecture and theology. In the Barberini print ideal geometry stands for the Christ-microcosm, as labeled at the top of the circle and as in the godly "I am who I am" of the triangle's vertices, whereas in Villalpando's the entire building represents the body of Christ and hence the Church. The palace plan, too, expresses the Church but in the form of its Fathers, both Eastern and Western, as contained in four small rooms at the top and bottom. Flanking the elliptical entrance hall, the two chapels, designated "Triumphans" and "Militans," reinforce the identification between the palace and the Church. The theological perfection of Busini's design also plainly emerges in the obtru- sive designation of the columns as the Eight Beatitudes (Matthew 5:3-11), for "theirs is the kingdom of heaven," as the evangelist recorded Christ's words. They represent the highest form of Christian perfection known in this world. In the palace, as in the temple, ideal archi- tecture mediates between the earthly and the celestial realms. Villalpando's temple also serves as a precedent for the astrological components of Busini's engraving-the zodiacal rooms of the apartments. There the twelve perimeter towers of the main block refer to the tribes of Israel, each paired with a depiction of one of the zodiacal signs, while seven courtyards carry glyphs of the planets (fig. 14).43 The four interior towers in front of the sanctuary stand for the Levitical camps and portray the four elements, just as the four courtyard loggia piers of the Barberini plan symbolize the "chain of the elements." 9 On the fame of Villalpando's effort and the contro- versy surrounding his interpretation, see Taylor 1952, 411-73; 1972, 73-80. Taylor also finds that Villalpando's ideas reflect those of his teacher, Juan de Herrera, and appear in the design of the Escorial, where Herrera was administrator.

The geometry has a Platonic origin, but its labeling is Trinitarian and Christological. Busini's Palazzo Barberini, however, is perfect architecture not only because of its Christian meaning but also because of its ideal form. 4. The Print as Panegyrical Puzzle On a more humorous level, Busini's print also shows the influence of Vitruvius in the fan- tastic assemblage atop the Colonna column. The apparatus above the capital is a hydraulic mechanism-labeled "Fountain of Winds, Symbol of Honor." The globe of the earth mounted on a water pipe and surrounded by three metal rings in the form of an armillary sphere con- stitutes the core of the device. A puncture in the orb produces a jet of water, while a flange above spins the sphere in the wind. This incredible contrivance has the general appearance of some hypothetical reconstructions of the Athenian Tower of the Winds and a water clock described by Vitruvius (1.6.4-5; 9.8.2), as illustrated in commentaries (fig. 15).44 The inscrip- tion above the pinnacle and below the Vitruvian wind wheel offers an explanation: "Although the wind may blow, the glory of the partners is secure. In a circle as the waters drip, thus moves their fame through the world." Given the combination of Barberini and Colonna he- raldic devices, we may be justified in identifying the "partners" as the prospective palace residents, Taddeo and Anna. On either side of the column's pedestal are two additional oddities that reveal the author's iconographic horror vacui (fig. 16). To the left, a map of Europe forms an anthropomorphic shape. Again, a nearby inscription provides the meaning: The angelic form expresses Europe protected by the Archangel Michael, who presides at Rome.... Spain supplies the head, France the chest, Belgium the back, England and Ireland the wings, Germany the stomach with Bohemia as navel, Denmark and Norway shape the left arm which is provided with a shield. Indeed, Italy is the right arm extended with the sword set on fire by three-cornered Sicily, always blowing forth from Mt. Etna. This conceit did not originate with Busini, as observed in an Hispanocephalic map of Europe from the 1628 edition of Sebastian Miinster's Cosmographia (fig. 17).45 Spain forms the impe- rially crowned head of the continent, and Britain a mere banderole on the Spanish royal scepter. Bohemia even maintains its status as navel. Busini, however, makes his Europe in the form of its own guardian angel, the Archangel Michael-a heavenly protector not only for Europe but, as we shall see, also for the Barberini. To the right of the pedestal appears a variation of the Christological chi rho, desig- nated as "the double axis cross of heaven." An inscription informs us that the wings are, again, those of the archangel, with one wing dedicated to "Faith" and the other to "Con- templation." The extremities of the cross arms contain the names of animals symbolizing the Four Evangelists, while the shafts of the arms indicate the current condition of each crea- ture. Matthew's angel is "homo nascens"-man being born-an apparent reference to the 4"Vitruvius Pollio 1521, XXIVv. See Krinsky, 127-30. Busini's wind wheel, located beneath Taddeo's seal, re- inforces the connection with commentaries on Vitruvius's discussion of the winds.

Urban carefully planned the date and time of his nephew's investiture to coincide with the eighth anniversary of his own election to the papal throne, which he deemed astrologically propitious. The chart for the time of the cer- emony (fig. 19) shows Leo rising toward the Mid-Heaven Point and Taurus, Busini's "vitulus," descending or "dying" toward the horizon.'0 In the engraving these important events occur under the protective wings of St. Michael, whom Urban and Taddeo had adopted as their patron saint." This astrological component of the print's signification returns us to the ideal geometry overlaying the architectural plan. The aspects, or angular relationships among the planetary bodies, diagrammatically presented there were important factors in calculating the felicitous moment of Taddeo's investiture. As dominant components of Taddeo's natal chart, the Sun and Jupiter brought benefic astral influences to the Quirinal ceremony, at least in the eyes of those individuals who considered such calculations important.'2 Since they were 120 degrees apart at that time, these two heavenly bodies formed the aspect known as trine, which makes a triangle.'3 Jupiter was also in square (90 degrees apart) with the Mid-Heaven Point and in sextile (60 degrees) with Mars, thus forming a square and a hexagon.'4 Conjunction is the most potent of all aspected relationships, symbolized by the circle, and present in the investi- ture chart by Mercury at the Mid-Heaven Point." Thus, the triangle, square, hexagon, and circle at the core of the palace plan reiterate important astrological realities operative at the 46Pecchiai, 213, 217-18. 4 F.

Lat. 2819, 67r-70v), but consistories usu- ally took place in the morning. Leo would have been on the Ascendant between 9:45 and 11:45 A.M., local mean time. The Sun, in Leo, would have arrived at the Mid- Heaven Point soon after that. Leo was on the Ascendant at the births of both Urban and Taddeo, and the Sun was in Leo at Urban's election to the papacy. The trine aspect (120 degrees apart) of the Sun and Jupiter was another benefic component of the chart. See Scott 1991, 76-82, 86-87, figs. 136, 138, 140.

The imagery of the print thereby reveals ideal geometry as the basis for divinely sanctioned papal events (Taddeo's appointment as prefect) and for harmonious architectural design (the new Barberini palace in its ideal form). Signs of heavenly benefaction appear both in the stars and in the harmonic principles that serve as the basis for the design of Palazzo Barberini. The blessings received and antici- pated by Taddeo, the print seems to imply, are part of the larger order of things. Busini makes this flattering point quite unambiguously in the inscription just below the one confirming the measured, numbered, and weighed nature of the universe: "You also having been weighed will deserve greater gifts." These rewards manifest themselves in three dominant themes of Busini's panegyric: Taddeo's appointment as prefect, the marriage alliance between the Barberini and Colonna, and the continued heavenly favor and protection of the papal family. Taddeo's attainment of the prefecture, in particular, marked a significant political accomplishment for the Barberini, as this office was hereditary and would remain a permanent sign of the family's status even after the death of the pope. The history of the prefect's ceremonial bonnet tellingly reveals the importance attached to matters of imagery by the Barberini. As payment documents show, this bizarre headgear was freshly designed by Pietro da Cortona (fig. 20) 56 Not content with the generic antique helmet worn by predecessors, Taddeo radically upgraded this component of his insignia."7 As contemporary critics complained, the hat possessed the noticeable quality of looking like a papal tiara, only without the crowns."8 Emblazoned with suns and bees, the bonnet permit- ted no mistake about the family identity of the prefect. The object even appears sculpted into the metopes of the Barberini palace (fig. 21). Perceiving the distinctiveness of this secular miter, Busini placed it on the pennant of the column apparatus and in the garden plantings, where it appropriately balances with the tiaras in the parterre on the left, symbolizing, re- spectively, the secular and ecclesiastical branches of the family.'9 Widespread opposition to Taddeo's promotion further underscored the significance of the appointment, as many powerful people considered him unworthy of the honor.60 Urban, in reaction to the perceived effrontery of such defiance of his will, made much of the 56 BAV, Arch.

We see, for example, to the right of the tiaras, in the interstices between the arms of a moline cross, the crests of four cardinals-the three Barberini cardinals (Anto- nio the Elder's with the Capuchin crossed arms of St. Francis, Francesco's without differentiation, and Anto- nio the Younger's superimposed over a maltese cross) and Cardinal Girolamo Colonna, whom Urban raised to the cardinalate as a member of the old baronial family with whom the Barberini had made the important mar- riage alliance (DBI, 27:346-47). The sun to the left of the tiaras may allude to Rome, the seat of Barberini eccle- siastical power, whose foundation chart is Ruled by the Sun (L. Gaurico, TractatusAstrologius [Venice 1552] bk. 1, 5r). Without doubt, the fleurs-de-lis in the correspond- ing plot to the right of Taddeo's hats are Florentine lilies representing the ancestral city of the Barberini family. The motif of bees surrounding the sun to the left of the prefect's helmets reiterates the configuration of Barberini devices sewn into the front of Taddeo's headgear, as seen in Maratta's portrait of the prefect (fig. 20). 60 See the entry in G.

The huge painting the pope commissioned from Agostino Tassi, depicting the exact moment Ur- ban crowned Taddeo with the prefect's hat (fig. 22), makes clear the importance of both im- age and event for the pope and his family.6' Busini's engraving thereby provided visual rein- forcement where needed and congratulated Taddeo on his controversial political achievement. On the social front, Urban's arranged marriage for his secular nephew had enormous implications, since the Colonna were an older and better established family than the parve- nus Barberini. Busini includes the Colonna heraldic column and thus emphasizes the part- nership of Taddeo and Anna, who were soon to take up residence in the new palace. The blessings enjoyed by Taddeo and the Barberini family emerge from the astrological and angelological references in the engraving. These themes, in particular, found visual form in the palace's pictorial decoration, being completed precisely at the time Busini produced his engraving. Andrea Sacchi's ceiling painting in the main antechamber of Donna Anna's apartment depicts the Old Testament personification of Divine Wisdom, surrounded by vir- tues who hold attributes of the constellations (fig. 23). Cosmic themes indicated by the globe of the earth appear here, as in the center of Busini's palace plan, where the flanking rooms carry the zodiacal glyphs. We know from Barberini horoscopes that the main point of Sacchi's configuration of constellations assumes the natal astrology of both Urban and Taddeo, as well as the election chart of the pope (6 August 1623). We can see, for example, that the lion of Leo rises in the upper left of the painting and that the eagle ascends above the northern hemisphere of the earthly orb, just as Busini indicated on the arms of his "double axis cross of heaven."62 In astrology the Barberini saw confirmation of God's providential wisdom and of their birthright to rule. The written program of the Sacchi ceiling (1629-30), composed by the Dominican philosopher Tommaso Campanella, patently states that Divine Wisdom is appro- priate to the house of the Barberini "in order that it be understood that since that happy family was born and elected to rule the Church in the place of God it governs with Divine Wisdom."63 This assertion recalls Busini's inscription on the frieze of the palace elevation, where the edifice is termed the "Instrument of Numerical Wisdom." The mathematical har- mony of the spheres appears in the architectural design, just as those same heavenly bodies emerge in the actual palace decoration to indicate the preordained preeminence of the Barberini. As we have seen, the Barberini regarded themselves not only chosen by God, as indicated by their high station, but protected in particular by the Archangel Michael, who served as their special guardian angel. Urban designated the feast of St. Michael and All the Angels for his coronation, an event commemorated in papal medals with the archangel crowning the new pope', and in Andrea Camassei's ceiling painting of God Creating the Angels (fig. 24), located in the room adjacent to the one with Sacchi's Divine Wisdom.65 Girolamo Teti, in the official guide- book to the palace, confirms the significance of this ceiling by noting that some angels attend to the protection of specific princes and churchmen.66 In the painting, God's commanding gesture 61 G.

The monumental scale of the canvas (approximately 3 x 2 m) indicates its importance for Urban. 62 Busini's celestial cross recalls the constellation Crux, the most Christian of all the traditional stellar configu- rations and one Sacchi had taken care to include in his astrological fresco, seated just to the right of the en- throned central figure of Divine Wisdom. 63 BAV, Barb.

Taddeo felt his guardian angel to be present particularly at significant moments in the life of his family, as when they moved to the new palace. His household accountant recorded the follow- ing entry in his ledger: "On 13 May 1632, with praise to God, the Blessed Virgin Mother Mary, and all their saints and with the protection of our guardian angels I came to live in the new palace at the Four Fountains at about 22:00 be it with the health of soul and body and peace of everyone."67 Busini's references to St. Michael knowingly exploit Barberini family beliefs about the privileged protection they received from God and his angelic ministers. God's stewardship of the Barberini, along with the role of their palace in that divine guidance, also appears in the four inscriptions Busini placed above the palace elevation, where text reiterates the imagery. Two passages from Psalms declare the hoped-for protection against enemies: "I shall not die, but live: and shall declare the works of the Lord" (117:17); and "Delight in the Lord and he will give thee the requests of thy heart" (36:4). The third quota- tion comes from Augustine's commentary on the Gospel of St. John and posits the Barberini palace as the dwelling place of God: "Let us also make a house into which He may come and teach us, and have converse with us" (7.9). Finally, Taddeo appears as God's chosen and willing servant in the last passage, from the Book of 1 Kings: "Speak, Lord, for thy servant heareth" (3:9). Major themes of the engraving reappear in other forms of Barberini family iconography, both visual and literary. What distinguishes Busini's contribution is the idea of linking those motifs to architectural theory and symbolism-the palace in the form of its Platonic arche- type. His Palazzo Barberini repeats the ideal harmony of the cosmic order in architectural form, just as the Barberini saw their social and political station as earthly sign of the supramundane moral order. The engraved sheet presented to Taddeo thus made a resonant, congratulatory image for the papal nephew and prefect on the eve of his occupancy of the new family palace, reflecting through architectural symbolism his exalted and harmonious position within the macrocosm. 5. Attracting Patronage Having examined the intrinsic meaning of Busini's engraving, we may now consider the pur- poses behind its creation and the mechanism of patronage it evinces. The identity and mo- tives of the mysterious Busini provide keys to our understanding of the print's intended func- tion. What we know of his activities in Rome is due to Waddy's research in the archives of San Lorenzo in Fonte, the church of the Congregazione Urbana.68 This confraternity, of which Busini was a founding member in 1624, served as a mutual welfare society for courtiers (mae- stri di casa, gentiluomini, and segretarii) attached to the papal household or to those of cardi- nals, foreign ambassadors, and other noble families in Rome.69 The group operated a hospital at San Lorenzo for the ill, aged, and poor among their members.70 Busini participated regularly in the organization's meetings, involved himself in its finan- cial affairs, outfitted his burial chapel in its church, and, in 1630, became treasurer (camerlengo) 67 BAV, Arch. Barb., Ind. IV, 13, at date. 68 For Busini's early career in the service of the Venetian nobleman, Pietro Contarini, see the appendix. 69 The "Congregazione dei nobili aulici," as it was called.

This inscription provides useful insight into Busini's purpose. Since Taddeo's elder brother, Cardinal Francesco Barberini, was cardinal protector of the congregation,74 it would have been logical for the recently made camerlengo to encourage further Barberini patronage of the organization-named after the papal uncle-through the cultivation of Taddeo's interests. This must have seemed an especially well-timed maneuver just at the moment of Taddeo's triumphal investiture as prefect, an achievement that rein- forced his position as head of the ranking secular household of the city and made of him a promising potential patron of the Congregazione Urbana. Understanding the mechanisms of seventeenth-century patronage is the key to opening the meaning and purpose of Busini's engraving. Although printmaking in Baroque Rome had a more developed entrepreneurial base than did art production in other major media, it still depended in many cases on traditional princely patronage. Professional artists and engravers often followed a well-established procedure to gain subventions for their prints.7' The artist promised to dedicate a print to a prospective patron if that individual covered the costs of production. The dedicatee then received copies of the print, but the maker retained the cop- perplate and rights to further reproduction. Inscriptions were a particularly expensive part of the printmaking process, and early states, minus the lettering, were usually shown to the targeted patron for approval prior to the addition of this final costly component.76 Such a state of Busini's print exists in the British Museum, where the dedication is already in place but most of the inscriptions are missing.77 Yet, as a commercial venture on its own, an en- graving with so much esoteric symbolism linked to the specific patron would seem to have a rather narrow appeal. The motives behind the print must involve an ambition greater than mere exploitation of its market potential. Since, in this case, the role of the engraver, the obscure Daniel Widman,78 is likely to have been that of mere executant, Busini must be the principal in the play for patronage, yet he was, as far as we know, not an artist, much less an architect. Beyond what we can infer from the print, little can be said about Busini's architectural expertise, but the archival sources 7'Waddy 1973, 160-61. 72 "Che si fece un instrumento con il sig.r Oratio Busino per scudi cento che ha speso in fare il soffitto alla sagrestia, et in altre cose utile alla congreg.e li quali cento scudi egli dona, e, si mette alla congreg.e con peso et obligo che la medesima cong.re gli fece dire dopo la sua morte una messa il mese."

If his plan and elevation of Palazzo Barberini cannot represent a real alternative to the design under construction at the moment of the print's publication, the timing nevertheless suggests that Busini used the important occasion of the new edifice as an opportunity for advancing the interests of his beloved congregation in the eyes of the soon-to-be resident of the palace. Busini's effort, through the publication of a dedicatory print, to attract additional patron- age or maintain support already promised for the organization is consistent with his documented expenditure of personal resources for the benefit of the association of courtiers.8' Circumstances suggest, moreover, that the patronage he sought from Taddeo was specifically architectural and that it concerned the congregation's church of San Lorenzo in Fonte in the Via Urbana. With a bull of 1628 transferring the church to the courtiers' organization, Urban had already shown great interest in the congregation's welfare.82 About 1630 the pope engaged Domenico Castelli and, possibly, Luigi Arrigucci to enlarge the mostly mid-sixteenth-century preexisting structure.83 From 1625 to 1629 Castelli had worked under Carlo Maderno's su- pervision at Palazzo Barberini and, by 1633, had assumed the role of superintendent of con- struction.84 Also around 1630-31 Busini built and decorated the chapel to the left of the presbytery at San Lorenzo, as recorded in the congregation's minutes and by an inscription on the chapel wall dated 1631.85 This chapel carried a dedication to SS. Giovanni and Paolo, the 79 At the meeting of 10 January 1630 Busini presented Martinelli to the congregation for membership. ACU, vol. 1, Decreti, 1624-34, at date. Martinelli authored two impor- tant guidebooks to Rome: Roma ricercata nel suo sito . .. (Rome 1644) and the manuscript "Roma ornata dall' architettura, pittura e scoltura ...," published in C. D'Onofrio, Roma nelseicento (Florence 1969). But his ear- liest work was a short history of the organization's church, Ecclesia S. Laurentio in Fonte de Vico Patricio (Rome 1629). It is tempting to imagine Martinelli, later the friend of Borromini, as a link between Busini's geometric abstrac- tions and the complicated geometries of Borromini's sub- sequent plans at San Carlino and S. Ivo, as discussed, for example, in L. Steinberg, Borromini's San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane (New York 1977) 15-43, and L. Benevolo, "II tema geometrico di S. Ivo alla Sapienza," Quaderno dell'Istituto di Storia dell'Architettura 3 (1953) 1-14. Whereas Borromini's geometry is integral to the construction of his plans, however, the contrasting ideality of Busini's super- imposed shapes comes through in the nearly total discon- nectedness from the plan. The point of Busini's configura- tion is precisely its detachment from the real world. Also see the appendix for Connors's discussion of Busini's architectural interests. 80 P.

The inscription on the wall of Busini's chapel also informs us that he was born of a noble family in Thessaly and held degrees in both canon and civil law.87 He must have been a cultured individual, as we might expect from his status as secretary in a patrician household. These were the men who helped generate the personal and family iconography of high- ranking patrons,88 and Busini at one time held such a position in the household of Pietro Contarini, the Venetian ambassador in Rome.89 We can easily imagine the atmosphere of icono- graphic play that must have existed among the professional courtiers at San Lorenzo. Having built and maintained their careers by producing eulogistic texts and images for their respective patrons, members of the congregation must have continued to exercise their wits among them- selves. For Busini's part, the complicated iconography of his sheet betrays its author's enthusi- asm for such conceits, which he once expressed in a letter to a fellow member of the Congregazione Urbana upon receipt of a drawing containing "clever" imprese alluding to the organization.90 One example of this love of emblematic expression remains above the door to the congregation's house adjacent to San Lorenzo, where an incised plaque displays the impresa of the organization (figs. 25-26).91 Recognizing that the courtiers' patron saints had served the Constantinian household, Busini's group took as its symbol the chi rho (X + P) of the 86Moroni Romano, 23:138; Sartorio (as n. 82) 26; Barroero, 65-66. The saints are the fourth-century brother martyrs who were courtiers in the household of Costanza, the daughter of the emperor Constantine. They also served in the Scythian Wars as soldiers under Gallican, a Constantinian general, and successfully per- suaded him to make a vow to God that resulted in his victory and ultimate conversion. Gallican later founded a hospital at Ostia and devoted himself to charitable deeds similar to those engaged in by the Congregazione Urbana. Bibliotheca Sanctorum, ed. F. Caraffa, 13 vols. (Rome 1961-70) 6:12-13, 1046-49. The much repainted anonymous painting now above the altar of Busini's chapel depicts the martyrdom of the courtiers' saints at the hands of Emperor Julian's captain of the guards, Terenziano, and appears to date from the late seventeenth century. 87 As records an inscription on the right wall of Busini's chapel: D.O.M. / HORATIVS BVSINVS I.V.D.

To the right of the author's arms on the column pedestal, for example, the "Double Axis Cross of Heaven" with its corresponding Labarum-like initials (including the alpha and omega of the impresa) indicates that Busini introduced in modified form the device of the worthy organization for which he sought sup- port through the engraving's publication. The "C.V.C." in the circle at the cross axis of the engraved chi rho must therefore stand for Congregationis Urbanae Crux, thus referring to the Labarum-cross of the Congregazione Urbana as seen at the center of the plaque. The little evidence contained in the congregation's archive does not specify when Busini left the service of the Venetian ambassador, but, since he was living at San Lorenzo from at least 1628, he is unlikely to have had duties at Palazzo Venezia after that time. It is clear, more- over, from the dispute over precedence that arose between Taddeo and Giovanni Pesaro, the Venetian representative at that time, in September 1631, less than a month after the investiture, that Busini's connection with the ambassador's household had ended, for, otherwise, he would have had little hope of Barberini patronage.93 We have no firm documentary record of the success of Busini's quest for direct support from Taddeo, although it may be relevant that the copy of his print in the Barberini Archive is the only known example of the final state. Still, the reconstruction of San Lorenzo in Fonte by Castelli and Arrigucci, two architects frequently engaged by the pope and his nephews, indicates that the Barberini continued to look favorably upon the congregation's endeavors. Busini's engraved panegyric perhaps played a positive role in this sponsorship. Within two years of its issue, however, the author fled Rome under clouded circumstances.94 Busini's success in procuring and maintaining patronage through his graphic architec- tural encomium is perhaps the best index of the quality of his project. He rightly calcu- lated that Taddeo, riding the crest of nepotistic extravagance, was a potential patron with 92Martinelli 1629 (as n. 79) XXX. The outer circle of the impresa reads: LABARUM LABORUM FINIS AULI- CORUM. On the standard itself: IN VINCULO FACIS / AMEN. The inner circle carries the letters C and V (Congregatio Urbanae), separated by the letter tau (T), known as the crux commissa or tau cross. On the history and salubrious qualities of the mystical tau, see H. Rahner, "Antenna Crucis, V: Das mystische Tau," Zeitschriftfiir Katholische Theologie 75 (1953) 385-410. The encircling words are IN TRINITATE SALUS, and a ribbon below unites the components of the chi rho. These inscriptions and symbols concern the beneficial association of the courtiers through their confraternity and charitable activities of its hospital. 93 The statutes of the congregation required that prospec- tive members had to have served in a noble household for fourteen years before being eligible to join the orga- nization. Since Busini was a founding member in 1624, he must already have had behind him a long career as courtier. In November 1627, the same year his master Pietro Contarini returned to Venice from Rome, Busini successfully petitioned for the privilege of occupying a house adjacent to S. Lorenzo in Fonte, the church given to the congregation by Urban VIII through the interces- sion of the organization's cardinal protector, Francesco Barberini. In December of that year Busini took respon- sibility for regular priestly duties at the church. His resi- dence and office suggest that Busini, who was sixty-eight years old at the time, must have already left the service of the Venetian ambassador and would therefore not have been implicated in the Barberini-Pesaro altercation of 1631. Pesaro had assumed duties as ambassador only in 1630, at least two years after Busini had established him- self at San Lorenzo in Fonte. Even so, Busini made no effort in the print to deny his Venetian connections. One of the inscriptions above the "Double Axis Cross of Heaven" at the bottom of the sheet reads: "The Vene- tians hope to lead life untouched while this Michael pro- tects them under his wings." "His last recorded attendance at a meeting of the con- gregation occurred on 14 April 1633. ACU, vol. 1, Decreti, 1624-34, at date. In a letter of 24 September 1633 from Cittanova d'Istria [Novigrad] Busini expresses his desire to return to his beloved congregation, but, in a subsequent letter of 7 September 1634, from Venice, he laments his exile and hopes, elliptically, that God may forgive the individual who was responsible for his de- parture from Rome: "O quante volte mi vado augurando la mia quiete di S. Lorenzo in Fonte: Dio perdoni a chi n'e stato la cagione della mia partenza.

The ideal plan of Palazzo Barberini even contains a suggestion of the major design feature contributed by Taddeo. In the actual plan two major stairs, left and right, lead to one salone connecting independent apartments on the piano nobile for secular and ecclesiastical members of the family (fig. 5, S1-S2).95 In the engraved version, two comparable stairs lead from the central courtyard to separate enfilades of rooms on the floor above. Moreover, as head of the pre- eminent secular household of Rome, Taddeo must have seemed a logical patron for the con- gregation of courtiers. Where Busini may have nearly miscalculated was in his apparent belief in the cerebral nature of Taddeo's interests, when, by all indications, the prince's architectural concerns tended to be of a more practical order.96 Taddeo's down-to-earth thinking in such matters was mani- festly remote from Busini's Platonic plane, and we can hardly imagine the busy prefect pass- ing much time pondering the engraved brainteaser. Yet, if Busini had any knowledge of the complex allegorical programs of the imagery planned for the apartments of Taddeo's family in the new palace (and actually being realized in the years prior to the publication of the print), he would have had good reason to suppose the prince would be pleased with the clever conceits of the panegyrical puzzle. Even the astrological component of the print reflects Taddeo's attentiveness to astral events.97 Not- withstanding personal limitations, Taddeo, like his cardinal brothers and papal uncle, favored imagery he understood, however dimly, to advance his family in the eyes of others. Through this attitude, novel and even obscure poetic caprices became for the Barberini a means to trump the patronage of social rivals in the competitive arena of Roman art production. The recondite and sometimes ambiguous meaning of imagery produced for the Barberini became a hallmark of their patronage. However convoluted in form, the print's obvious references to the socially significant matrimonial link with the Colonna, to the recent investiture as pre- fect, and to the ongoing construction of an imposing new family edifice of pontifical scale surely appealed to Taddeo's sense of self-worth. 6. Visual Encomia and the Barberini Of the many visual encomia dedicated to Urban and his nephews, three typical examples, each made for a different family member, will help place Busini's print in the repertoire of images produced in the quest for patronage. The analysis will also demonstrate the importance of iden- tifying the motives of the encomiast as a basis for interpreting the subject. These samples show the means for acquiring and maintaining patronage in seventeenth-century Rome. Matthaus Greuter's engraving of three bees, entitled Melissographia ("honeyed lines") and dedicated to Urban VIII (fig. 27),98 provides a well-documented case of how a corpo- rate entity sought through the use of the print medium to gain patronage during the Barberini papacy. Under Federico Cesi's direction the Accademia dei Lincei committed itself to the empirical study of nature for the sake of pure secular knowledge, but, notwithstanding claims to intellectual detachment, the worthy publication program of the academy required financial support. The leaders of the group were attentive to this reality, just as they were 95Waddy 1990, 228-29. 96 For Taddeo's architectural thinking and activity as a patron of architecture, see ibid., 282-90. 97 See above, n. 52. 98BAV, Racc.

Nothing in all nature is more remarkable. The bee, an achievement worthy of the companions of the Lynx who have examined it with closer gaze, has been set forth and expounded in pictures (with the spirit of Cesi urging on the sacred toil and the art of Pallas aiding the eager men), while under the polished glass rise the greatest marvels and the eye learns to magnify its faith. Who would have known that there are five tongues in the body of the bee, that the neck is like a lion's mane, that the eyes are hairy, that there are two sheaths to each lip, were it not for the divine discoveries of the new art? Thus it is fitting that, while the world looks up to thee in wonder, the bee should show itself to be a yet greater wonder.104 Here poetic allegory and the scientific revolution coexist in odd alliance for the sake of at- tracting patronage. Cesi's associate, Johann Faber (1574-1629), reported on his success in distributing the print at the papal court and that it had "pleased" Urban himself, who looked forward to seeing the full text on the history of the bee, the Apiarium planned for subsequent publica- tion by the academy.'05 This concerted panegyrical project aimed to secure and maintain Urban's patronage.106 99In addition to the DBI (24:256-58) entry on Cesi, see Federico Cesi, Atti dei Convegni Lincei 78 (Rome 1986).

Greuter's print also influenced other engraved images of the Barberini heraldic insect, which there- after appeared in two forms: the rather generalized version, as seen, for example, in Contelori's frontispiece (fig. 18); and the more accurate and detailed rendition, as in Busini's engraving. Cesi's Lincean bees made a spectacular impression and contributed greatly to the apimania that gripped the Rome of Urban VIII.108 The Melissographia demonstrates how a corporate group could em- ploy print imagery to promote the patronage of their enterprise, and it provides us with a docu- mented precedent for Busini's effort on behalf of the Congregazione Urbana. If the Lincean print represented a group effort, another type of visual encomium might advance the career of an individual. Giacinto Gigli, the diarist and Roman civic official, in 1634 drew with "his own hand" a scene ostensibly depicting the gardens behind the Barberini palace (fig. 28).109 The arms held by putti indicate a dedication to Cardinal Francesco, but the sun on the horizon and especially the bees busy at work among the flowers make clear the Barberini allusion. We understand from the poem in the cartouche below that the mod- est caretaker carting a pot of roses into the palace garden is the author himself, whose name means "hyacinth lilies," as is clear in the blossoms growing in the foreground, left and right, and being attended by bees-the metaphor for Barberini patronage.110 "I can securely hope for my comfort in the drops of choice honey," the poem confidently reads."1 The idea being, here as elsewhere in Barberini imagery, that the bees release honey to the worthy recipients.112 Gigli thereby seeks to cultivate Francesco's well-known interest in floriculture and poetry."13 '07As of 1 October 1623.

"I0The text of the poem is as follows: "Gigli, giacinti, e rose / In angusto giardin chiuse, e serrate, / Solo al mirar, solo all'odor son grate. / Ma se sian trasportate / In un prato, ove sian l'api ingegnose: / Porta l'agricoltore/Sperarn', oltr'alla vista, oltr'all'odore; / Di raccorre anco il miel dolce, e perfetto. / Tal lo; che dal mio tetto / Questi fioretti porto / Nel prato Barberino almo, e ridente; / Dove, albergan le pecchie, al ciel dilette; / Porto securamente / Sperar, per mio conforto, / Di dolcissimo miel le stile elette." For an- other, more ambitious poem penned by Gigli, "La Gloria Barberina" (1633-34), with the aim of procuring Barberini patronage, see the analysis and transcribed dedication to Urban in A. Ademollo, Giacinto Gigli ed i suoi diarii del secolo XVII (Florence 1877) 101-3. Nussdorfer, 111. 112 This visual metaphor of patronage appears on Roman fountains commissioned by Urban and Cardinal Francesco where large sculpted bees spout water. In ad- dition to the portico fountain at Palazzo Barberini (above, n. 14), the Vatican Fontana delle Api (1626) ex- emplifies the type. C. D'Onofrio, Le fontane di Roma (Rome 1957) 188-90; R.

The bee-poet equation, repeatedly invoked by versifi- ers during the reign of the Barberini poet-pope, has its locus classicus in Horace: "Ego apis Matinae / more modoque / grata carpentis thyma per laborem / plurimum circa nemus uvidique / Tiburis ripas operosa parvus / carmina fingo." [I, after the way and manner of the Matinian bee, that gathers the pleasant thyme laboriously around full many a grove and the banks of well-watered Tibur, I, a humble bard, fashion my verses with incessant toil.] Q.

Some printed visual encomia came only after the receipt of monetary benefaction, al- though, to be sure, not without a hopeful eye to the future as well. An elaborate, multifigured engraving dedicated to the brother of Taddeo and Francesco, Cardinal Antonio Barberini the Younger, and based on a drawing by the Barberini favorite, Pietro da Cortona, offers a marked contrast to Gigli's clumsy effort, as well as to the scientific exactitude of the Lincean print and the static symbolism of Busini's folio (fig. 29).116 Cortona's design differs, moreover, from the encomiastic imagery we have thus far exam- ined in its acknowledgment of patronage ex post facto. It served as the thesis plate of Giovanni Battista Labia, published in 1635 in thanks to the cardinal, who, we may imagine, sponsored his studies at the Collegio Clementino in Rome."7 The iconographic conventions of thesis prints have yet to receive a full analysis, but we may recognize in the imagery the characteris- tic heraldic reference to the patron of a visual encomium. The involvement of Cortona, who, at the time, was engaged with completing his fresco for the ceiling of the Barberini salone, indicates that the cardinal authorized and probably also paid for his own thanks. Seated on a high support, the cult figure of a round temple holds a scepter and book, indicating Wisdom."8 To her right we see the arms of Cardinal Antonio (with the distin- guishing Maltese cross), whose portrait medallion appears held aloft by putti and against the backdrop of his bee imprese between the interior dome ribs.119 River gods of the Arno and Tiber below indicate the cities of origin and current residence of the Barberini family.120 The urns, pouring forth, may also suggest the liberality of the cardinal's largess. l Drawn by Andrea da Ancona (Andrea Lilio), View of a Garden behind a Palace, illustrated in Hollstein, 12:76- 77, no. 90.

For another thesis-related engraving connected to Labia's graduation, see Hollstein, 12:59, no. 41. This is the frontispiece of G. B. Labia, Barberina mella, ad harmonicos concentus expressa in propugnatione triplicis ... (Rome 1635), a short poetical work published at the time of Labia's graduation. The print represents personi- fications of History and Poetry flanking the coat-of-arms of Cardinal Antonio Barberini the Younger. The pamphlet consists of four poems celebrating bees, honey, and Barberini patronage: "Apum Religio in Perductis ad Mercurii Templum," "Supremus Gloriae Apex Triplici Apum Prodigio Praesignatus," "Priorum Patrocinium ab Apibus Susceptum in Sustentato Comate Relucens," and "Divini Cultus Incrementum per Apes Factum Evecto ad Heroum Honores Onesilo Rege Cyprio." "8C. Ripa, Iconologia . . (Padua 1611) 467-68 (Sapienza). 119 Cardinal Antonio was the prior of the Knights of Malta. The imprese are "Spes Omnis in Uno" and "La- bor Omnibus Unus." 120 The composition of two river gods flanking an en- throned deity is reminiscent of the Roma, Tiber, and Nile group on the Campidoglio.</page><page sequence="22">218 JOHN BELDON SCOTT Personifications of the disciplines related to natural philosophy'2' enter from the left and offer their attributes to the reigning deity-a scene paralleled in the bas-relief of the statue's pedestal, where bees and aged figures reverently approach a temple illuminated by a radiant sun.'22 Three statues of personified virtues occupy the intercolumnar spaces,123 but more im- portant for the meaning of the narrative action are the figures located to the extreme left and right. To the right, behind the cult figure, Mercury'24 readies his purse, while, to the left, Fame prepares to crown with laurel the male figure (personifying Merit?) entering with a tablet.'12 Despite the obscurity of some details, the acknowledgment of patronage received as an earned award in the promotion of learning seems clear enough.126 Antonio's munificence in sponsoring the student benefits the arts. Here the print, in contrast to the other examples we have seen, commemorates the patron's generosity through an elaborate expression of gratitude. In some instances it may be possible to suggest a correlation between the eulogistic ico- nography of a visual encomium and the patron to whom the image is dedicated. In such cases the encomiast selects a specific individual for potential patronage and conceives the imagery to exploit the known interests of that person. We have seen examples of this "targeted" en- comium in Busini's engraving and in Gigli's drawing, where architectural and horticultural symbolism, respectively, show an attempt to tailor the eulogy to the specific patron. The mi- croscopic view of bees, coupled with a poetic dedication, reveals the Linceans' desire to im- press Urban, above all because of his early support of Galileo's telescopic endeavors but also because of his own poetic activities.127 The Melissographia, too, would therefore belong to this "targeted" category of encomia. Often, however, there is no obvious effort to customize the imagery to an individual, as in the more generic allusions to learning in Labia's thesis engraving dedicated to Cardinal Antonio. Here the imagery, except for the portrait medallion and Maltese cross behind the 121 Astronomy, with celestial globe, leads the group, fol- lowed by Mathematics carrying an armillary sphere and compass. Ripa, 33 (Astrologia), 328-31 (Mathematica). The kneeling figure holds cartographic plates, and the male figure entering from the extreme left holds a tablet showing a bust and the lower part of a column. See also the interpretation of Bean (as n. 116) 102-3. 122 Labia's dedicatory inscription on the thesis broadsheet identifies the scene. The relief depicts four old men, one of whom appears to follow a swarm of bees toward a tetrastyle temple with a standing cult figure, as the sun shines above. Pausanius (9.40.2) tells of the Boeotian envoys who were sent to Delphi in search of a remedy for the drought. The priestess of Apollo advised them to go to Labedeia to seek out and consult the oracle of Trophonios. Not knowing the exact location of the oracle, the group, led by the eldest among them, followed a swarm of bees to the place. Trophonios was known as the architect of the Temple of Apollo at Delphi, thus the solar imagery, which, according to the inscription, represents Urban. I thank Louise Rice for providing a transcription of Labia's dedication. Her forthcoming study of thesis prints will more fully explicate the imagery of his graduation sheet. 123 Among them, Religion, veiling her head before an al- tar, Minerva with a crane holding a rock in one claw (per- sonifying Learned Vigilance?), and Rhea, with her son the infant Jupiter fed by bees at her feet (representing the Golden Age). Ripa, 458 (Religione), 531 (Vigilanza), 62 (Carro di Minerva). 124 Mercury's presence here is due to his function as the god of eloquence, since this is fundamental to all fields of learn- ing. As suggested by K. Noehles, La chiesa dei SS. Luca e Martina nell'opera di Pietro da Cortona, trans. C. Passanti (Rome 1970) 6. Mercury often appears in the company of the Graces as the patron of learning. See, for example, the Education of Marie from the Marie de' Medici cycle (Lou- vre, Paris). J. Thuillier, Rubens' Life of Marie de' Medici, trans. R. E. Wolf (New York 1969) 75-76. The purse at- tribute usually occurs in contexts emphasizing the god's role in commercial activity, as on Roman coins and in Rubens's Mercury Departing from Antwerp, designed for the entry of the Cardinal-Infante Ferdinand in 1635. J. R. Martin, The Decorations for the Pompa Introitus Ferdinandi (London/New York 1972) 178-87, esp. 186. Cortona's in- clusion of the money bag must symbolize the munificent promotion of the arts as personified on the left. 125 The act of crowning with laurel that appears in the scene is the visual analogue of taking a degree. Laurearsi = to receive a degree. The figure being crowned appears to be a modified version of Ripa's Merit-a bearded old man crowned with laurel and wearing a rich robe. Ripa, 336-37 (Merito). 126 Noehles (as n. 124) 6 believes the male figure on the left to be Cortona himself and suggests that the engrav- ing is related to the Accademia di San Luca, of which the artist was principe (1634-38). 127 Urban's early support of Galileo, see S. Pieralisi, Urbano VIII e Galileo Galilei (Rome 1875) 14-68.</page><page sequence="23">PATRONAGE AND THE VISUAL ENCOMIUM 219 coat-of-arms, would be appropriate to almost any Barberini family member. Only an analysis of a fuller range of Barberini-dedicated visual encomia will show how common were the cor- relations between patron and image. There are, however, some qualities characteristic of Barberini patronage in general. Coming from a family without exalted pedigree or illustrious deeds, Urban saw poetry and the visual arts as means to achieve intellectual ascendancy in compensation for the rela- tive modesty of his background. The pope's conception of himself as a poet, creative thinker, and promoter of all sorts of novelties is fundamental to understanding the motives behind his munificence in encouraging others in their artistic and scientific endeavors, especially when such enterprises directly enhanced the image of the pontiff and his family. This thinking no doubt led to Urban's daring early support of Galileo and other Linceans. Leone Allacci entitled his biographical dictionary of poets and learned authors living in Rome during the Barberini pontificate the Apes urbanae-the bees of Urban-as the pope himself enjoyed the epithet "King of the Bees."1'28 With this background, the production of honey, the sweet words of poetry, and the bounty of Barberini patronage became linked, producing an abundant flow of literary and visual encomia. In the Melissographia, for example, the liter- ary-artistic and the scientific impulses of Barberini patronage merge. If Urban first showed the way, his nephews eagerly followed suit, introducing an era of iconographic innovation. 7. Conclusion The Barberini nephews, following the lead of Urban, delighted in promoting iconographic extravagances by which they might neutralize the pretensions of their peers and rivals at the papal court and in Roman society in general. Through abundant patronage they encouraged artists and humanists to engage in pursuits that contributed to this enterprise. We often focus our attention on the works of leading figures like Cortona, but this system of patronage also affected persons who were not trained practitioners but rather amateurs in art. The Linceans, as well as individuals like Gigli, Labia, and Busini all provide examples of how such people used visual encomia in their quest for attention and patronage from the rich and powerful. Busini's print is a characteristically novel product of the period of Barberini political and social hegemony in the 1630s, demonstrating that even someone of obscure stature could participate, if modestly, in the phenomenon of seeking patronage through visual encomia. In just the years when entire teams of painters, sculptors, and architects were busy at the new Barberini palace in projects of scarcely paralleled material and thematic dimensions, Busini engaged in a venture of smaller scale but of no less grandiose intellectual conception. His distinction is to have couched the iconographic enigma in praise of Taddeo in the symbolism and imagery of architectural theory. Busini's exceptional contribution indicates the depth of architectural culture in seven- teenth-century Rome and the fecundity of the patronage system during the pontificate of Urban VIII. Neither architect nor artist, Busini managed to devise a panegyric in the lan- guage of architecture tailored to the perceived inclinations of a potential Barberini patron just at the instant of that individual's greatest triumph and as he anticipated installing his family in its majestic new home.

He began his career as a priest and doctor of laws in the service of the Contarini family of Venice. He held the benefice of rector of the church in Piazzola, a Contarini fief on the Brenta.' He accompanied the Venetian ambassador Pietro Contarini on important legations to London and Madrid in 1617-19, serving as chaplain and private secretary. The embassy entered Lon- don on 19 October 1617 and left for Spain on 1 December 1618. During this time Busini composed a relation entitled Anglipotrida, of which a manuscript has been preserved in the Marciana.2 He was a keen observer of both English architecture and society. He reported at length on the severity of English penal laws and the frequency of capital punishment. He noted in England the same inflation of honors that could be observed in Rome: Et giornalmente si veggono diversi a cangiar fortuna, buona parte, per6, lo fanno in meglio, poiche, a guisa di Roma, ancor qui si costuma di far le promottioni, creandosi un semplice gentilhuomo Cav[alie]re, doppo Barone, poi Viconte, e Conte, e March[e]se, et anco Duca. Et questi gradi, dano commodita alla M[aes]ta Sua di buscar molte migliaia di scudi, canonicamente.3 Busini traveled frequently and recorded visits to the London suburbs, Greenwich, the great houses of Audley End and Theobalds, and the university towns of Oxford and Cam- bridge. That he was a keen observer of architecture in general may be inferred from the occa- sional small sketch in his notes, such as a garden parterre with a fountain in England (c. 95v) or, on his next embassy, a balcony at the corner of a Spanish palace (c. 49v). He is generally laconic in his reactions, but it may be noted that he had a low opinion of English domestic architecture, with its half-brick construction and wooden stairs. Still, almost unique among Italian travelers of the period, he took the trouble to visit King's College Chapel in Cam- bridge and the Palace of Nonsuch. An interest in architecture was in ferment long before he composed his encomiastic print to Taddeo Barberini. Busini has entered the annals of English literature thanks to his reluctant attendance at a performance of a Ben Jonson masque, Pleasure Reconciled to Virtue, performed for the nobility ' Pietro Donazzolo, I viaggiatori veneti minori, Memorie della Reale Societa Geografica Italiana 16 (Rome 1928) 194-98. 2Marciana Ital.

The music failed to make a good impression, "massime a gusto nostro, come suogliati delle gratiose, et sonore musiche d'Italia." Such were the stan- dards of a Venetian of the generation of Monteverdi. The banqueting following the masque revolted him. Nevertheless, he liked the dancing, and his lengthy report of the evening's fes- tivities is a precious source for the conditions of performance of a Jonson masque. Busini accompanied Pietro Contarini on his subsequent embassy to Madrid,5 and it seems that he also continued in Contarini's entourage when it moved to Rome.6 It is not known when he dissociated himself from the Venetian embassy, although as John Scott notes, he was living at S. Lorenzo in Fonte by 1628. His Venetian origins and his career would have been a great liability during the crisis caused by Taddeo's assumption of the title of prefect of the city in 1631. We last hear from him in involuntary exile in Venice, in a letter of 1634 quoted in n. 94 above. How brightly Taddeo may have smiled on him, and how intimate his connections with the rest of the Barberini family may have been, we will probably never know. His print led to no direct patronage. Yet it is interesting to remember the presence in Rome of well-traveled courtiers like Busini, full of information and opinions on theatrical practice elsewhere in Eu- rope and willing to share their knowledge at precisely the time when the Barberini were inau- gurating a operatic productions in their own palace with the performance of the sacred melo- drama, II Sant'Alessio, in 1632.7 4Reprinted in extenso with an English translation in Stephen Orgel and Roy Strong, Inigo Jones: The Theater of the Stuart Court (Berkeley 1973) 1:277ff.
