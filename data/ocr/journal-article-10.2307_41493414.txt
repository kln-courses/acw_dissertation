The Taj-ul-Mulh , or the Royal Crown of Jewels, is an ancient treatise dedicated to the royal family written in classical Jawi (Arabicized Malay script). It contains matters relating to astrology, natural sciences, medicine, physiognomy, alchemy, the interpretation of dreams and directions for building among others. The Pawang's Book , which is included in the Appendix to Skeat's Malay Magic,2 is a compilation of texts copied from a Malay charm book which belonged to a pawang (magician) named Abdul Razzak from Klang, Selangor. Apart from describing the customary practices of magic measurements as a means of ascertaining luck and fortune during house building, this article explores magic measurements from a mathematical point of view. Despite their apparent simplicity, the magic measurements contain within themselves relatively sophisticated mathematical properties. This article also attempts to analyse the possible role of magic measurements as an ordering system in traditional Malay architectural form. The Architecture of the Traditional Malay House It is a well-established fact that the earliest Malay house form was the long-roof type.3 Reliefs on Dongson drums4 and at Borobodur5 are evidence of the early presence in the region of stilt buildings with a single long ridge roof, or what is known in Malay as 1 Illustrations and information about the traditional Malay house appearing in this article are based on the Measured Drawing Collection at the Centre for Studies of the Malay Built Environment (or KALAM), Uni versiti Teknologi Malaysia.

I would also like to thank Margaret Ackrill, Sue McGlynn and Nicholas Walliman for their comments. 2 Walter W.

The most common of all Malay house types is the rumah bumbung panjang (long-roof house),6 also known as rumah tiang duabelas (12-column house, although it can also be of 16 or 20 columns), hereafter referred to as the traditional long-roof Malay house or long-roof house.7 There are several regional variations of long-roof houses. Although some houses are clearly of the long-roof type, variations are sometimes so explicit that it is necessary to sub-classify them according to the state in which they are found, such as the rumah bumbung panjang Pahang (the Pahang long-roof house).8 The characteristics of a traditional long-roof Malay house are as follows. All such houses have a pitch roof and are built on stilts. The floor plan comprises a serambi (reception area, particularly for male guests) at the front of the house, a dapur (kitchen) at the back, and a rumah ibu (main house) in between. The placing of the kitchen may vary slightly, with some being positioned more to the left or right of the main part of the house. For a small long-roof house, a kitchen proper is not built. Instead, a hearth placed at one of the rear corners of the rumah ibu defines the kitchen area (see H2 in Fig. 2). Frequently, the serambi is constructed slightly lower than the rumah ibu , and in this instance is called a serambi gantung (hanging serambi). The serambi can be designed to have lots of window openings and be very bright and airy or it can have few window openings. The roof form is basically a single ridge double-pitch roof spanning longitudinally over the floor space of the rumah ibu. A lean-to roof usually covers any spaces added to or extended from the rumah ibu , including the serambi and dapur. Any extension to the house is usually made in parallel to the existing main house, with the new roof eaves meeting the old ones. Between the two house blocks a space may be introduced, thus distancing the eave-to-eave arrangement of the roof. In a closed eave-to- eave extension, a gutter made of dug-out timber or zinc is used. In the east coast states of Malaysia, a connection with a new part of the house is made by introducing an unroofed floor space, much like the jemuran or the selang (gap, link or connector) in the Negeri Sembilan house type (see Hll in Fig. 2), or the courtyard in the Melaka house (HI 6 in Fig. 2). Most houses have two entrances. The main entrance to the house is placed in the serambi ; mostly on its front façade, but occasionally on one of its sides. The number of steps on the main staircase is usually odd. The second entrance is placed either on the kitchen wall or on the spaces between the rumah ibu and the kitchen. Ornaments and decorations are placed on the serambi , and occasionally flow into the rumah ibu. In line with the anthropomorphic idea of front-back or head-tail, the kitchen is left bare compared to the serambi , where the household's identity is manifested. As mentioned above, other house forms have emerged from the typical long-roof house to form regional variations within the same type, while others vary so considerably as to form a subtype, such as the Thai-influenced Kelantan Malay house. The Kelantan Malay house adopted a slightly different floor layout and was often not subjected to the popular alignment (longitudinally over the rumah ibu) of the perabong bumbung (roof ridge line). The main entrance is not necessarily placed on the house front. An unroofed internal platform, the jemuran , is adopted, to form some kind of 'decking', making the 6 To avoid confusion with the roof of the longhouses of the aboriginal peoples of Sabah and Sarawak, this study has adopted the expression 'long-roof' throughout. See Chen Voon Fee (ed.), The Encyclopaedia of Malaysia, Vol. 5: Architecture, Singapore: Archipelago Press, 1998, pp. 33-6 7 As this study focuses on house forms rather than layout, it was felt that the term 'Rumah Bumbung Panjang' to refer to the long-roof house is the most appropriate term. 8 Abdul Halim Nasir and Wan Hashim Wan Teh, 1996, pp. 39-41 . 92</page><page sequence="3">JMBRAS VOL. LXXIII plan layout more flexible than the eave-to-eave roof and floor arrangement (Fig. 1). FIGURE 1: The Kelantan Thai-influenced Malay House The Spiritual Dimension of House Building The fundamental objective in building houses in Malay culture is to live in harmony with the environment. This means that the object (the house) and the subject (the occupants) are expected to be compatible. The occupant hopes to live in his dwelling in utmost comfort - physically, spiritually and emotionally. One of the important elements of house building in traditional Malay society is to achieve rasi. Rasi or serasi means padan (fit), sepadan (fitness), or sesuai (suitable) and selesa (comfortable). In house building, rasi may be understood as the outcome of achieving fitness, suitability and comfort for a human dwelling or habitation on a chosen site or in a given environment. Rasi is accomplished by the application of three interdependent components of the traditional Malay building tradition: adab (assigned values to human behaviour or ethics), adat (customs, common practices or convention), and tertib (order of procedure or discipline). In other words, for rasi to be achieved, the values (adab) of each of the customary building practices (adat) must be respected and implemented in their prescribed order (tertib). If rasi is not properly achieved, or it fails to materialize, the house and its environs is claimed to be panas ('hot'; this will cause 'emotional discomfort' or 'a feeling of restlessness') and could become berhantu (haunted). Signs or indicators that are revealed after symbolic rituals, such as magic measurements, are performed, guide decision making in house building. When every ritual procedure is accompanied by a good sign, it is believed that the owner and the house will be suited to each other and to the universe. The house and the owner are blessed, and are likely to live in continuous state of harmony. Rasi is achieved when 93</page><page sequence="4">PART 1, 2000 there is equilibrium in material and spiritual dimensions between the owner and his dwelling place. The measuring activities depend on none other than the body measurements of the most important woman ('the mistress') of the house. On the surface, a traditional Malay house may look similar to others of the same region, but this is not the case. Indeed, each house is unique. The rasi of one might not be suitable for another. Various other aspects of house building have been documented elsewhere and will not be discussed here. For example, Hilton has given an account of Malay house building explaining, step by step, the building elements of the Malay house from the foundation to the roof.9 An investigation into building typology has been made by Noone with reference to the characteristics of houses in Banggul Ara, Perak.10 Sheppard has filled the gap left by Hilton and Noone in investigating houses in the east coast states.11 Several other authors have described circumstances relating to the spatial aspects of a Malay house, particularly Winstedt in his description of the house interior and furnishings.12 One can also find cross-ethnic architectural influences among the peoples of Southeast Asia.13 The specific materials used and the construction methods employed in traditional Malay architecture are covered in other works.14 Magic Measurements Many articles have been written about the measurements of the traditional Malay dagger or keris}5 All of the techniques described in keris measurements are a form of charm by themselves. In fact, each is more of a charm than a measurement. As hand-held objects, keris might not need an anthropometric measure. Being the most sanguinary weapon in Malay culture and history, it is understandable that luck with keris is a very important aspect. No analysis has been made of the magic measurements in buildings other than what has been written elsewhere in the form of notation, the source of which is rooted in customary building practice. 9 Hilton, 'The Basic Malay House'. 10 Noone, 'Notes on the Kampong'. 1 1 Sheppard, 'Traditional Malay House Forms'. 12 R.

Magic may be defined as the seeming control of natural forces by ritual invocations of supernatural beings. In Malay, magic is called sihir, from the Arabic s ihr , and is defined as whatever is caused by hidden or subtle forces, often used with ill intent by manipulative minds.16 In anthropology, 'magic' usually implies the practice of using spells to invoke supernatural powers to influence events.17 The term 'magic measurement' refers to a kind of action- initiated charm applied to a peculiar technique of measuring. It is likely that the use of this term in Skeat's Malay Magic has given some sort of endorsement to this usage. For the purpose of this article, the term 'magic measurement' is considered appropriate, so no attempt is made to explore other possibilities.18 Magic Measurements of the Taj-ul-Mulk and the Pawang's Book No in-depth study of the content of the Taj-ul-Mulk and the Pawang's Book has been undertaken. Skeat copied the Pawang's Book from the pawang's personal copy but provided no further information about it. However, it is believed that the Taj-ul-Mulk is one of the main sources of the Pawang's Book because of the number of similarities between the two in their charms and prescriptions. Winstedt mentioned that the author of the Taj-ul-Mulk was Shaikh 'Abbas, an Acehnese who died in 1895. 19 According to the introductory page of the Taj-ul-Mulk , the book is presented in two interrelated sections: part of the main text contains the work compiled by the scholar and al-Hafiz (the one who memorized the Qur'an), Abdul Adhim al-Munzary, and is translated by Tuan Hassan Besut (from Besut, Terengganu) bin al-Marhum Tuan Ishak Patani (from Patani, Thailand). The texts placed in the side margins are translated from 'the book of creation' by Sheikh Nuruddin bin Ali Jinji al-Dani as-Shafie. The Taj-ul-Mulk is written in narrative form. No full stops nor commas are used within paragraphs. One has to observe carefully the rhythm of the words in order to be able to differentiate each sentence. Apart from the magic measurements cited in the book, there are several other prescriptions related to building, which are still subject to investigation. Measurements used in formulating the shape and the form of artefacts or buildings in Malay culture can be placed in two categories: magic measurements, used to determine omens for a house or object; and constructional measurements, that is, normal measuring practices used to determine the shape and form of artefacts and building components. Though magic measurements are used to induce good luck, the significant role they play could inspire the form of a building. Magic measurements are methods of measuring designed to regulate any significant linear dimension or to position an element, for example, a door opening, within a prescribed length, where it is believed some form of ritual is necessary to ensure the beneficial outcome of such a decision. As the decision is often intimately related to the spiritual world, or is made to seek harmony with the unknown events of the future, magic measurements have been widely used in traditional Malay society with the hope 16 Edward William Lane, An Arab-English Lexicon, Edinburgh: William and Norgate, 1865, pp. 1316-7. 17 R.

In other words, it is hoped the decision made will be a blessed one. This aspect can be seen in the magic measurements prescribed in the Pawang's Book (hereafter referred to as the 'first text') as follows: Measure off (on a piece of string) the stretch (fathom) of the arms of her who is to be mistress of the proposed house. Fold this string in three and cut off one third. Take the remainder, fold it in eight and cut off seven-eighths. Take the remaining eighth, see how many times it is contained in the length of the threshold [bendul], and check off the number (of these measurements) against the 'category' of the 'eight beasts.. . .20 The eight beasts, if arranged in numerical order one to eight, should be like this: 1 - dragon, 2 - cow, 3 - lion, 4 - dog, 5 - bull, 6 - donkey, 7 - elephant, and 8 - crow. Each of these beasts is associated with either a good or a bad omen: the dragon is a good sign; the cow signifies sadness; the lion will bring security and happiness to the household; the dog will bring shame and humiliation; the bull symbolizes wealth and respect; the donkey is a sign of loss of wealth; the elephant means the owner is blessed and will have good fortune; the crow implies illness and is a sign of death. These beasts are pronounced alternately in the prescribed order during measuring. Indeed, it is the beasts that are important rather than the numbers; thus, the numbers are never used or uttered. To evaluate the numerological significance of this technique of measuring, the beasts are replaced with numbers, as indicated above. As one can see, the desirable beasts are the dragon, lion, bull and elephant - numbers 1, 3, 5, and 7 respectively - while the remaining numbers 2, 4, 6, and 8, even numbers, are to be avoided. It is the odd numbers that possess good luck and the even numbers contain bad luck. This leads us to question of the significance of these odd numbers.21 The application and meanings given to odd and even numbers can also be seen in the culture òf other ethnic groups in the Malay Archipelago. Their significance has been dealt with ^elsewhere.22 This article attempts to understand the significance of these particular magic measurements. Assuming that a depa (fathom or arm span) of a Malay woman is 1500 mm (an average adult depa is 1600 mm), when the fathom is divided into three, each division will be 500 mm long. The remaining two-thirds of the fathom equals 1000 mm. If this is divided into eight divisions, each will be 125 mm. When the length of a bendul 23 is to be set up, its linear dimension has to be contained within the odd beasts' numbers of 1, 3, 5, and 7. Measured from one end, a bendul should be contained within these lengths - 0 to 20 Skeat, Malay Magic , pp. 145-7. 21 Yaakub Idris has briefly observed this and its implications for overall floor dimensions.

It continues with 1000 to 1125, 1250 to 1375, 1500 to 1625, and 1750 to 1875 mm and so forth, and one should stop at the point where it reaches the desired length for a room or house. One must avoid everything other than these ranges of linear dimension.

The 'first texť of the Pawang's Book suggests the need to investigate the application of its magic measurements to a building. However, it should be noted that it may not be possible to state precisely the actual practice of magic measurement when each house was built, as this requires historical inquiry into the beginning of construction of each of the houses. The exercise here is simply to see the possible application of the magic measurements prescribed above and hopefully to be able to draw some conclusions from it. For this purpose, sixteen traditional Malay long-roof houses with similar characteristics were selected at random from various parts of Peninsular Malaysia (Fig. 2). As decorative effort on the Malay house is mostly directed at the serambi , this re- creation of the magic measurements will therefore focus on this part of the house. The linear dimensions of the serambi in several traditional long-roof houses in Peninsular Malaysia, measured at their bendul , are given in Table 3. The data in Table 3 below shows overwhelming agreement between the prescription of the first text's magic measurements and the actual length (or building width) of the serambi in the selected houses. Of the sixteen houses, only three have undesirable dimensions for the width of the building. Though one can not say exactly how magic measurements were applied to most of these buildings, the exercise conducted here shows the possibility of its widespread application. The measurements might have also been practised throughout all the regions in Peninsula Malaysia as indicated by these sample houses. 98</page><page sequence="9">JMBRAS VOL. LXXIII The bendul of the Bugis house at Parit Pecah in Johor (H14) was 10.125 m long (see Table 1). The length of 10.125 m or 10125 mm is contained within the division of beast number 1 and, in this example, a depa of 1500 mm long is adopted. If a 1600 mm depa is used (see Table 2), the bendul length is within 5. The Bugis house might have been measured based on a different depa. If the unit of depa used in the Bugis house is known, then it is possible to calculate precisely whether its bendul is indeed governed by the four lucky beasts.

The manipulation of numbers in magic measurements is sometimes categorized as an aspect of numerology. Petungan , as it is called in Java, is more sophisticated and played a greater role in determining the form of Javanese architecture24 than did the magic measurements in Malaysia, especially those presented here. The first example is concerned more with numerology and omens, whereas the next example, from the Taj- ul-Mulk (hereafter called the 'second texť) embodies ideas of composition: Take a piece of string or rope and measure the bendul , divide it into nine parts by folding it evenly into nine pieces. The sixth part from the right is considered to be the best location for a door. Measure the inside of the door opening with a piece of string and fold it into nine equal parts. Four of the parts plus two widths of the door opening will be the height of the door.25 The first two sentences seem to indicate the method of positioning a door along a bendul. Usually a wall is placed on top of or close to a bendul. The text suggests that a door opening be built at the sixth of the nine parts of the bendul. Apart from seeking hidden luck, as magic measurements are intended to do, this prescription presumably relates to wall construction and plan layout. The third and last sentences explain how to determine the height of the door opening. Instead of interpreting the second text numerically, this study examines them graphically. Fig. 3 translates the above text graphically. 24 J.

LXXIII The Influence of Magic Measurements on Malay House Form In earlier days, the anatomically-based system of measurement was the only means of measurement used in house building. The mistress of the house, as representative of the household, was the one upon whom the unit of measure was based. Her depa was transferred to a timber rod, rattan strip, rope or string. Any other units within the depa system of measurement were derived from this timber rod. The Malays used the string or rope left after following the rules of folding and throwing the prescribed pieces away and, assisted by their collective memory, settled on an auspicious dimension for house building. For the purpose of this analysis, what is thought to be the 'hidden rationale' of magic measurements is converted into tables, to further clarify the point being made in this article. Undoubtedly, the dimensions prescribed in Tables 1 and 2 above played an important role in determining the dimensions of a building plan, and hence a building's form. These tables can be extended downwards until the intended dimension for a building is reached. The types of traditional Malay houses are sometimes recognizable by observing the number of principal columns. These range from the four-column to the 24-column house type.26 Often a 6 ft or 1800 mm long woven nipah (Nypah fruticans) panel is used to cover the roof, with a side overlap of 300 mm (6 inches) when one sheet is laid over another. For a 16-column house, the cross-sectional length of the house was often settled at 8100 mm (27 feet).27 In Table 1, the length of 8100 mm is contained in column 1 (see boxed figure), that is, the dragon, which is a good sign. If one refers to Table 2, based on a 1600 mm depa , the 8100 mm length is also contained within number 5, that is, the bull (see boxed figure) which symbolizes wealth and respect. Therefore, a difference in arm span unit length does not seem to interfere with the measuring technique. What matters most is to induce good fortune when deciding on the right dimensions in building. At first glance, the second text looks straightforward, with almost no indication of magic prescription. The 'magic' is revealed only when the design is translated into a geometrical drawing (see Fig. 3). The third and fourth sentences of the second text lead us to a door opening as prescribed in ABCD; included in it is a square resting on a square, the sides of which are the length of a part. The sixth part is divided into nine equal parts, and four-ninths of its length is added to the top of a double square ABGH, to form a complete door opening. Alternatively, one can also construct this door opening geometrically by plotting a circle. When a circle with centre E and radius EG (r) is drawn, it meets at two places along the edge of the door opening at D and G, and another two places along the bendul datum at В and I. Radius EG produces the 1:V2 rectangle of CDEF. One can argue that the meeting points at B, D, G, and I, when a circle is inscribed onto the graphic representation of the magic measurement, may simply be coincidence. However, the use of a circle as shown here suggests that it is possible to construct a door opening within a bendul length without using the method prescribed in the second text. In other words, the magic measurement represented in the second text is not simply a string folding exercise; it contains a geometrical relationship.28 26 Hilton, 'The Basic Malay House'; Hilton, 'Defining the Malay House'; Sheppard, Traditional Malay House Forms'. 27 Yaakub Idrus, Rumah Tradisional Negeri Sembilan , pp. 60-3. 28 It is fascinating to know that international A-series paper sizes, such as the popularly used A4, are also derived from the 1 :&gt;/ 2 rectangle. 101</page><page sequence="12">PART 1,2000 FIGURE 3: Graphical Translation of the Text from the Taj-ul-Mulk If this geometrical analysis is regarded as possible only as a result of a happy accident, one has to prove it so. On the other hand, it is also possible that the anatomically-based units of measure and the string folding and throw away rules might be the source of this geometrical relationship. One is tempted to speculate on the numerical and geometrical analysis of the magic measurements presented above. In the first text, the purpose of the sequence of folding and throwing away pieces of the string until only 125 mm is left is difficult to ascertain. It is very likely that the folding and throwing away of portions of a string is a process of transforming the length of a depa to the smaller unit of a jengkal (the distance between an outstretched thumb and index finger); 125 mm is a measure of a jengkal. In a way, one could also surmise that this folding process is about maintaining the magic dimensions within an anatomically-oriented measurement. Whenever two-thirds of a depa is divided into eight divisions, this should give a measure of a jengkal , or closer to a jengkal than to any other anatomical unit of measure. The working out of a jengkal unit of measure by hand every time this unit is used is impractical, especially when the jengkal has to be taken from the mistress of the house. Taking the measure straight from the mistress's jengkal would not be right, as it has always been her depa that was measured before erecting a building. Therefore, it is logical to use a jengkal string, since it maintains a consistent measure. One can only guess at the reason for the introduction of the 'eight beasts' into the magic measurements. The eight beasts and other similar ways of identifying good and 102</page><page sequence="13">JMBRAS VOL. LXXIII bad luck belong to ancient practices, perhaps originating from the Hindu-Buddhist culture or even the Chinese practice of feng shui, which must have made contact with this part of the region. The second text looks like an instruction to be applied when a length for a bendul has been established: as if this is to be applied after the instruction of the first text is carried out. It does not refer to any anatomical unit; instead, it begins by stretching a string to the length of a bendul , subsequently folded into nine divisions. The reason for folding the string into nine parts is probably due to the custom of associating counting practices and measurements with odd numbers. But why nine and not other odd numbers are used is not known. It probably has something of a symbolic nature. As explained earlier, the way the door opening is set out is remarkable. What is most interesting is that the four-ninth portion that is added to the top of the two squares that make the top of the opening touches the arc at D (see Fig. 3). The appearance of 1:V2 rectangular - CDEF - is also difficult to grasp. Admitting the simplicity of technique the Malays used, and the absence of explanation of these magic measurements, it would be too ambitious to find the answer at the first attempt, as this article has shown. Most intriguing is the existence of a comparatively complex mathematical underpinning of measuring technique in an innumerate society. More studies are needed in order to understand the extent to which these texts have affected door and wall design, plan layout, and the building form as a whole. Conclusion Any conclusion about magic measurements practised by the Peninsular Malays as applied to building at this juncture would be premature. The sole purpose of this article is to expose and explore the operational meanings of the two chosen texts. As the meanings are uncovered, discussion of their significance follows. It is the influence of magic measurements on building form that interests the author. There may be too little evidence to show whether the magic measurements presented here had any impact on other features of the built form (for example, the roof, door and window openings). The important thing is that one knows that magic measurements played an important role in building, apart from their customary function as a means to induce good luck. Perhaps the next task is to search for more techniques of magic measurements and investigate them in a way similar to that described in this article. More texts like the ones presented here need to be discovered and explored before any definitive conclusions can be drawn.
