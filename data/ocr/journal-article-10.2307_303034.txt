And Time seemed to die in my heart. 1 By situating himself, as Heidegger says in the epigraph above, "in the pres- ence of something perpetual" which is also therefore a "moment when time opens out and extends" towards the eternal, that is, the timeless and epiphanic moment the Romantics so valued, he can begin to understand something of his own life. In describing Faulkner's work in an interview in 1957, Warren stresses the importance of such moments of consciousness: "That's the frozen moment. Freeze time. Somewhere, almost in a kind of pun, Faulkner himself uses the image of a frieze for such a moment of frozen action .... Some of these moments harden up an event, give it meaning by holding it fixed."2 And yet for Warren, perhaps the most time conscious poet of this century, such a moment only becomes significant as it reveals the "changeable" in our lives, as it returns us to time. Thus the speaker in "Snowshoeing" continues: So I stood on that knife edge frontier Of timelessness, knowing that yonder Ahead was the life I might yet live Could I but move. This act of projection occurs simultaneously with an act of remembrance as he realizes how his "past flowed backward" from that stilled moment. The moment is Janus-like; the absent past and future are modulated into the present now to create a sense of the presence of the three extases of time. So the poem ends as the speaker reinserts himself into this structure of time that has emerged: Remembering, too, that when a door upon dark Opens, and I, fur-prickled with frost, Against that dark stand, one gaze Will lift and smile with sudden sheen Of a source far other than firelight-or even Imagined star-glint. This new understanding of the self is coincident with a new understanding of time as what Heidegger calls a "presencing." The trick is that the poet must "convert what now is was/ Back into what was is." Such a presencing of the past, in turn, establishes a teleological ground that is the source of the self's hope-"This/ Is the process whereby pain of the past in its past- ness/ May be converted into the future tense// Of joy." 2</page><page sequence="4">Now this "retrieve" of the past, as Heidegger calls it, is not a simple nostalgic return, but rather a presencing that uncovers lost possi- bilities, a going back to go forward. The "moment of vision" for Heidegger is characterized by "anticipatory resoluteness." That is, Dasein hands down to itself its own pastness in order to "throw" itself upon the world in an essentially futural manner. Its resoluteness about its own finite situa- tion, its "heritage," is given purpose by anticipating or projecting itself, by attempting to understand and structure its own direction in history.3 Thus, ironically, "Its own past... is not something which follows along after Dasein, but something which goes already ahead of it" (BT, p. 20). History and the future, inextricably bound, become the responsibility of Dasein; they do not constitute a passive field to be entered, but rather a structure always yet to be determined. In fact, the moment of vision, says Heidegger, simply cannot be clarified in terms of the simple "now," as a simple "making present," but rather temporalizes itself in terms of a fu- ture, the emerging structure of the moment that cannot be summed up in any single instant (BT, pp. 337-38). The focus, for both Heidegger and Warren, is always upon potential, possibility; the moment is always futur- al, always a function of will and conscience. It is through such responsible "presencing" of Time that one situ- ates and defines himself. This is perhaps the central discovery in Warren's A Place To Come To. At one point, Jed Tewksbury, facing as he often does the sense of himself as a mysterious other living in a pre-conscious and timeless state, is suddenly made aware of the pressure of time, and through that, of himself. What is learned, and here Warren's philosophy of time both resembles and is as emphatic as Heidegger's, is the notion that one's "authentic" being is a temporal "dwelling" or "abiding"- I knew that I myself was very strange to me. I thrust forth a hand to regard it. I did not, in the deepest sense, know whose hand it was. I stood in the middle of time- lessness, lit by the brilliance of snow, and carefully drew in each breath slow and deep, trying to live in this new medium, in which there was no past and no future, only the strange present that existed only breath by breath. But, suddenly, I did know that the past and the future did exist, and I must live in them, too. For from the old weight-clock in the hall came the tiny whir and bong an- nouncing that it was one o'clock.4 Warren's texts typically present such homecomings in which the home is not simply a physical place, but the more elusive temporal "sheen" com- prised of mortal "firelight" and eternal "star-glint," what Heidegger calls the "shining forth" of Being. As Heidegger suggests in "What Are Poets For? ," the poet's role is to "unveil" to us "a presence grounded in a tem- 3</page><page sequence="5">porality whose essential time, together with essential space, forms the original unity of that time-space by which even Being itself presences."5 And so, Heidegger would say, the experience of Being, of the self's es- sence, is an experience of an authentic, poetic, and inner temporality. Ob- viously, then, it is not clock time which is at stake here, though a relation- ship between inner and clock times is always implicit. "But Time is not time," as Warren's Valery understands when he observes a gull glide through clock time from the privileged and governing position of a mo- ment which has its own Time ("Paul Valery Stood On the Cliff and Con- fronted the Furious Energies of Nature"). So, Heidegger remarks in Time and Being, "time itself is nothing temporal,"6 but rather a means of pres- encing times. There is always the difference, Warren says in an interview, between "chronological time and history," passage and coherent struc- ture.7 Man's duty, Heidegger says in the Introduction To Metaphysics, is to "transform the being that discloses itself to him into history and bring himself to stand in it."8 One must learn to live, that is, in a structure that provides a more complete experience than in sensations that follow "breath by breath" in some sequence of unrelated, pure presences, and in a more coherent structure than the ticks of a clock. But how is this transformation from metaphysics and timelessness into history and time effected? We can refer to Heidegger's teacher, Ed- mund Husserl, who describes in The Phenomenology of Internal Time- Consciousness a more dynamic version of the proleptic moment of memory we have encountered thus far in Warren: Recollection is not expectation; its horizon, which is a posited one, is, however, oriented on the future, that is, the future of the recollected. As the recollective process advances, this horizon is continually opened up anew and becomes richer and more vivid. In view of this, the horizon is filled with recollected events which are always new. Events which formerly were only foreshadowed are now quasi-present, seemingly in the mode of the em- bodied present.9 The moment, that is, always redefines itself, always transforms itself in an ever expanding movement; prophetic history and historical prophecy merge as the "horizon" is always dissolving. The "truth" of a moment is dependent upon this structure. For example, Heidegger says in his analysis of Nietzsche: "In order for the real (the living creature) to be real, it must on the one hand ensconce itself within a particular horizon, thus perduring the illusion of truth. But in order for the real to remain real, it must on the other hand simultaneously transfigure itself by going beyond itself, surpas- sing itself ir the scintillation of what is created in art-and that means it has to advance against the truth."110 Truth, as Heidegger explains in the In- 4</page><page sequence="6">troduction to Metaphysics, is based upon physis and involves the self's "placing-itself-in-the-limit" to achieve a sense of ever-emergence which alone authenticates it (IM, pp. 60 and 109). The truth of the moment, then, resides in its dynamic process of appearing, emerging, expanding its horizons. This transformation of the moment as such, then, is also a trans- formation of, emergence of the self. It is consciousness, the self, then, that not only creates but is Time. As Coleridge long ago realized, "an act of consciousness is indeed identical with time considered in its essence."1 1 The relation of self and Time goes back at least as far as Kant. For him, the operation of "opening up" through futural recollection that Husserl describes, and which Heidegger and Warren in turn adapt, is based upon a "categorical" structure of thought that imposes its own temporal- ity. So Kant, in describing the workings of human consciousness, writes of "the generation of time itself in the successive apprehension of an object," and more specifically, of "my generating time itself in the apprehension of the intuition."12 Thus, Heidegger says of Kant: "Pure imagination, thus termed because it forms its images spontaneously, must, since it is itself relative to time, constitute time originally."13 Time as the structure of in- tuition, then, and its content, is not an indifferent field in which things are enacted, but rather a complex of forces originating in the self. Time and the "I think," as Heidegger interprets Kant's innovative yoking, become one. Imagination forms images of the present, reproduces them from the past and anticipates those of the future in a constant flux as an ever changing but unified world structure is produced. These syntheses, as Kant calls them, provide continuity for the self: they "form" time in that they intuit and order images so that we can perceive them, and it is this intui- ting and ordering which is the essence of time formation. Thus, for ex- ample, in the mode of the present, "This pure synthesis of apprehension does not first take place within the horizon of time, rather, it is this synthesis itself which first forms the now and the now-sequence." And so for Kant, "the self originally and in its innermost essence is time itself" (KPM, pp. 185 and 201). It is in such a Kantian tradition that Henri Bergson says in Time and Free Will: "Within myself a process of organization or interpretation of conscious states is going on, which constitutes time duration."14 The moment of duration, then, is a hermeneutic one, a moment of deployment and organization of the self. It is not a quantity but a quality; it suggests, as Bergson says, a question of valuation. And so too, for Warren, in "Heat Wave Breaks" (Now And Then)- In the gasp of silence that follows your new heartbeat Do you catch the echo of one only just now spent? Or does Time itself, in that timeless and crystalline heat, Hang transparent, a concept bleached of all content? 5</page><page sequence="7">At this moment can you recall what your own life has meant? For Kant and Bergson, too, Time is the result of seeing oneself, as Jed Tewksbury does, as a detached (metaphysical) "object" that must "re- trieve" itself by creating its own history. This does not mean that one simply deciphers or decodes a past, for as Husserl and Heidegger have shown us, the past is always seen in relation to a teleology. To recall what a life has meant is to create that life as an act of Bergsonian will. It is in this context that Heidegger writes in his essay on Holderlin's originating imagination, "Poetry is the foundation which supports history," and more specifically- The essence of poetry belongs to a determined time. But not in such a way that it merely conforms to this time, as to one which is already in existence. It is that H6lder- lin, in the act of establishing the essence of poetry, first determines a new time.15 And it is in this context of the self which embodies time that Warren's "Saul" exclaims: I am the past time, am old, but Am, too, the time to come, for I, In my knowledge, close my eyes, and am The membrane between the past and the future, am thin, and That thinness is the present time, the membrane Is only my anguish, through which The past seeps, penetrates, is absorbed into The future, through which The future bleeds into, becomes, the past even before It ceases to be The future. Am also The knife edge that divides. Apart from us, Kant had written, the past, all time, is nothing; it is a "purely subjective condition."16 Such knife-edge moments, through which an historical future can be "appropriated," are signature in Warren's work. Heidegger often calls such threshold pauses moments of "betweenness" (BT, p. 409). For War- ren, these moments are always eventually narrative ones. Thus in "Tale of Time" he exclaims: 6</page><page sequence="8">the future is always unpredictable. But so is the past, therefore At wood's edge I stand, and, Over the black horizon, heat lightning Ripples the black sky. The developing narrative of the poem, as in so many of his poems or se- quences of poems, is predicated on the vision that repetitions, re-begin- nings, "thrusts" of "heat lightning" supply to the dark horizons of past and future. The narrative emerges as the duration created by the stillness, the deferral of ends, the temporal expansiveness we have seen characterize such threshold moments. Such a deferred Time, for example, provides the occasion for "Forever O'Clock" (Or Else): "The clock is taking time to make up its mind and that is why I have time/ To think of some things that are not important but simply are." The kind of spacing that Warren evokes here is not of the Derridian variety that suggests the "nonpresent" and the "nonconscious," the absence of the subject.17 On the contrary, this spacing denotes an internal presence and a 3ergsonian duration, for the sound the clock "makes trying to make up its mind is purely meta- physical./ The sound is one you hear in your bloodstream and not your ear." It is during the spacing that the narrative moment of the poem emerges, a storied portrait of a Black girl sitting in the dust of a farm. It is a story in which the speaker presences himself as the central consciousness of the moment at the same time he attempts to redefine himself as a pos- sible absence from it, pressing towards the horizon. Thus at one point the girl watches the car and the speaker meditates: "I watch the car that I know I am the man driving as it recedes into distance and approaches the horizon. This "doubleness," manifest in the speaker's simultaneous pres- ence and departure, detachment and participation, is a defining character- istic of the "between," and we should briefly explore it. On an ontological level, the narrative "between" is Heidegger's mode of "abiding" not only in the sense of the "homecoming" discussed above, but also as a "wait- ing," a "lasting." This "lasting" is not a simple extension and coagulation of "nows," but an expansiveness inherent in the structure of the moment itself. That is, if Being's "destiny," as Heidegger explains it, "lies in the ex- tending of time" as an act of appropriation or presencing, that extending or "opening" is also a "withholding." Presencing is a "constant abiding that approaches man," but to sustain this approach is to realize that it is never completed (TB, pp. 12-22). The clock never strikes, the waited-for moment never arrives and the deferred "now" never ends except arbitrari- ly in the last line, in "Forever O'Clock." The experience of Being is of a continual "nearness," but the "nearing of nearness keeps the approach coming from the future by withholding the present as it approaches" (TB,, 7</page><page sequence="9">p. 15). Thus in the Heideggerian moment of vision, "When such a moment makes the Situation authentically present, this making-present does not it- self take the lead, but is held in that future which is in the process of having-been. One's existence in the moment of vision temporalizes itself as something that has been stretched along in a way which is fatefully whole in the sense of the authentic historical constancy of the Self" (BT,, p. 410). The relationship between the ontological and the narrative levels of a text is a complex but important one. The moment of vision manifests itself as a "span," a "stretching along" of "historical temporality." But the two levels are not simply identical. So, for example, Heidegger defines the ontological moment of the opening and withholding of presence as an "epoch," which "appears" as a result of the "retrieve" I described earlier, that is, as an "emerging," constantly qualified structure. "Epoch does not mean here a span of time in occurrence, but rather the fundamental char- acteristic of sending, the actual holding back in favor of the discernibility of the gift, that is, of Being with regard to the groundings of beings" (TB, p. 9). And we might add, of Time with regard to the grounding of time. The ontological moment of Being is "articulated" as the difference be- tween Being and beings, Time and time, in the form of "perdurance."18 The ontological structure determines an historical existence, determines the structure of events and discoveries, the structure of retrieves manifest in a poem. This structure, a "span," is the structure of the poem itself as a process of "articulation" and "interpretation" which make up the "be- tween" and which are the poetical means for expanding its horizon. (BT, p. 409). I return now to "Tale of Time" in the context of this move from ontology to history. The poem or moment, really a sequence of poems or "epochs" as so many of Warren's texts are, moves from a sense of mere seasonal time-October, the depression, night-towards a more "authentic" time. The actual occasion is the death of the poet's mother. Immediately following her burial is a duration of utter emptiness- What Was there in the interim To do, the time being the time Between the clod's chunk and The full realization, which commonly comes only after Midnight? That "interim" becomes the text of Time's Tale, the poem itself as it de- fers its own end, comprehending an expanding moment-from the particu- lar life of speaker and mother to the very span of Being itself. The expan- sion occurs as the speaker attempts to "retrieve" his mother's past as a set of new possibilities: "I come back to try to remember the faces she saw everyday," he says, and later, "What were you thinking, a child, when you 8</page><page sequence="10">lay,/ At the whippoorwill hour? " The speaker, then, would, "Pacing the cold hypothesis of Time, enter/ Those recesses." The solution, when mem- ory fails, is thus to imagine in his own terms, to appropriate her past as his own. Thus he can remember at least how he himself, "A child, in the grass of the same spot, lay,/ And the whippoorwill called, beyond the dark ce- dars." The moment, focused always upon that dark horizon, upon the mother's possible pasts and what the son might make of them for himself, always approaching the mysteries of that horizon yet finally withholding them, produces a questioning of time: Whom we now sought was old. Was Sick. Was dying. Was Black. Was. Was: and was that enough? Is Existence the adequate and only target For the total reverence of the heat? The question here is Bergson's qualitative one, and its dynamic nature is underscored by the line break patterns around the copulatives. The begin- ning of this questioning is the beginning of the realization of a more authentic time. In fact, Heidegger says, this inquisitiveness about Being is itself a basis for creating one's history: "The asking of this question is his- torical in the fundamental sense that this questioning first creates history" (IM, p. 143). The withholding of a final presence of the mystery of Being provides the "span" in which the narrative of the speaker's approach be- comes articulated, in which the Time of the poem is generated, in which the text is produced. This authentic time transcends particular circumstance. The "be- tween" occurs as "span" in which the question of Being articulates the question of the self: Between the clod and the midnight The time was. There had been the public ritual and there would be The private realization, And now the time was, and In that time the heat cries out for coherence. Between the beginning and the end, we must learn The nature of being, in order In the end to be. And so the speaker would, in "Pacing the cold hypothesis of Time, enter/ Those recesses" of his mother's past to "Reach out" and "offer" the possi- bility of protection to her, at the same time he imagines her hand recipro- 9</page><page sequence="11">cally "reaching" to his cheek. The gesture brings not simply a knowledge of her, but as he says, "The hand has brought me the gift of myself." That "gift" of Being, as Heidegger too calls it, is the gift of one's "heritage" that becomes transformed into the self's history (BT, pp. 383-86). What began as a nostalgic moment ends as an appropriation of Being and the discovery of an authentic, historical self in the emerging narrative. The poem ends with an affirmation of presence, even under the guise of the absent prest ence of the heat lightning on the far horizon. Thus, says Heidegger: "Th: vast reach of presencing shows itself most oppressively when we consider that absence, too, indeed absence most particularly, remains determined by a presencing which at times reaches uncanny proportions" (TB, p. 7). What provides a "presence" to absence, what sustains continuity is this sense of "heritage," as Heidegger calls it, which is given by the poem. The moment of vision involves a "handing down to itself the possi- bility it has inherited" (BT, p. 385). That is, any "retrieve" is in a sense a "repetition," but repetition with a difference, that is, the difference of having an anticipatory structure, a desire to question, to transform, to make one's own. This structure is the very theme of Warren's Brother To Dragons. In that poem the setting begins as "No Place" and the time "No Time," but a more authentic Time and Place emerge-the Heideggerian "site" of Being or "opening" of a region. The characters trace or repeat their own pasts, but in doing so they come to such realizations-for ex- ample, Jefferson's of his pessimism, Isham's of the scope of guilt-that they in effect create another history in their metaphoric languages of discovery. While the participants seem under the burden of a chronological and fated historical time throughout, the possibility of making a personal Time be- comes most strong towards the end in another climactic "touch" scene. Jefferson exclaims: Touch him-touch him-yes? Yes, look! I've touched. Oh, may we hope to Find- No, thus create- The repetition of words here suggests something of the larger pattern of creative repetitions or "retrieves" in the poem itself-in all of Warren's poems. The result is the sort of "suspending" structure J. Hillis Miller sees in any narrative repetition. Not content to simply repeat without differ- ence, the structure of repetition "tends to organize itself into links, chains, strands, figures, configurations"19-into, for example, the sectioned or chaptered poems Warren is so fond of writing. That is, repetition itself erects a superstructure that "retrieves" or presences what is absent; "recol- lection," as Husserl describes it in the passage cited earlier, expands the horizon of the moment as a futural enterprize. 10</page><page sequence="12">II The Abyss in the Mirror The time is destitute because it lacks the unconcealed- ness of the nature of pain, death, and love. This destitu- tion is itself destitute because that realm of being with- draws within which pain and death and love belong together. Concealedness exists inasmuch as the realm in which they belong together is the abyss of Being." -Heidegger, "What Are Poets For? " In the midst of the deferred moment that is Warren's "Tale of Time," a problematic of presence as such briefly emerges. The Kantian co- alescence of perceiving self and its intuitive form, Time, is challenged by the very structure of history it creates: The sound of water flowing is An image of Time, and therefore Truth is all and Must be respected, and On the other side of the mirror into which At Morning, you will stare, History Gathers, condenses, crouches, breathes, waits. History Stares forth at you through the eyes which You think are the reflections of Your own eyes in the mirror. Ah, Monsieur du Mirror! Your whole position must be reconsidered. The poet's vision of Time begins to gain an authority that threatens the self-Frankenstein's monster, as the Romantics well knew, lurks in our own texts. In "Tale of Time" a pure presence later reasserts itself in the "cold hypothesis" that Time has, like the soul, many faces, or as Heidegger says, "veils" which simply "mask" pure presence. But the question arises with increasing force in Warren's career. Or Else, for example, re-intro- duces the mirror image in its opening poems. In "The Nature of the Mir- ror," Warren describes the ennui of a summer solstice with the sun slowly sagging, and ends by realizing once again that the time of an outer land- scape and the Time of consciousness are implicitly connected-"Time// Is the mirror into which you stare." But that poem in turn is followed by the brief "Introjection" (such "Introjections" questioningly punctuate the text of Or Else, undercutting its assertions): 11</page><page sequence="13">Is it really me? Of course not, for Time Is only a mirror in the fun-house. You must re-evaluate the whole question. This re-evaluation of the nature of Time, then, is a re-evaluation of the status of the self. This revaluation or questioning, as we called it in the pre- vious section, itself constitutes a form of historicizing which we must fol- low here. What abyss lurks here beneath the distorting mirror of simple presence, and even in absence that the referentiality of presence seems to veil? What does this calling into question mean for the structure of the moment of presence I have sketched in the first section? What does it mean for the self whose stability seems so bound with the continuity of Time? In his essay on Heidegger, Jacques Derrida deconstructs the struc- ture of Time and Being that is based upon the "now."20 For Derrida, Heidegger's "now" as "pure presence" and as "present" is always slipping away, yet always relying on the spatialized metaphor of the horizon to provide it with continuous extension. In Warren's scheme, the resulting "presence" of past, present, and future within the horizon of the moment provides a referential structure through which the self can define its own history. But ironically, the very structure of "links" and "chains" that es- tablishes presence in so many of Warren's poems, also produces gaps be- tween sections where absence opens up. This whole referential structure of presence is most vulnerable, then, when the continuity of the "now" is broken. Thus Derrida calls into question the self's continuous horizon in his essay "Violence and Metaphysics": "The present of presence and the presence of the present suppose the horizon, the precomprehending antici- pation of Being as time. If the meaning of Being always has been deter- mined by philosophy as presence, then the question of Being, posed on the basis of the transcendental horizon of time . . . is the first tremor of philo- sophical security, as it is of self-confident presence."21 Such a tremor occurs, for example, in "Youth Stares at Minoan Sunset" (Now and Then). In this poem Warren describes a horizon line upon which the sun seems to rest suspended, but unlike the moment in "Snowshoeing Back to Camp in Gloaming" (Now and Then), the moment here dissolves, the defining limit of the horizon turns blank: On that line, one instant, one only, The great coin, flame-massy and with The frail human figure thereon minted black, Balances. Suddenly is gone. A gull Defiles at last the emptiness of air. The abyss here is the darkening world that escapes the structuring cate- 12</page><page sequence="14">gories of any self, of any Time or "instant" that would provide a continu- ous order. There are two textual strategies that attempt to veil this abyss. The first is the referential "human figure" on the metaphoric coin, but that is, after all, only a symbol for a presence; and besides, it too lasts only "one instant." The second is the gull which "Defiles at last the emptiness of air." Despite the fact that "Defiles" seems to suggest a confusing ad- miration for the purity of "nothingness," the gull becomes by the end of the poem an anthropomorphic symbol of consciousness-"He spreads his arms to the sky as though he loves it-and us." The conditional "as though" is asserted so forcibly by the incantatory rhythms that the absence of an actual, full presence in nature is overlooked. The figure and the strategy recall Stevens's "pensive man" who "sees that eagle float/ For which the intricate Alps are a single nest,"22 and who thus assumes by mere force of faith an order of presence in the midst of the chaos of absence. That is, the eagle and the gull are symbols for a presence which is itself given only as a possibility; the referentiality of the pure presence is at once called into question by the thematic of the poem and supported by the rhetoric of the poem. The youth thus defines his own position in the broken moment with a certainty that defies the actual situation and which restores continuity to the moment itself. This rhetorical overcoming of the conditional or subjunctive does not always work so smoothly, however. In "Chain Saw At Dawn In Ver- mont In Time Of Drouth" (Or Else), the poet wakes to the song of a saw in the far off woods; the saw Sings: now! Sings: Now, now, now, in the Lash and blood-lust of an eternal present, the present Murders the past, the nerve shrieks, the saw Sings now, and I wake, rising From that darkness of sleep which Is the past, and is The self. It is Myself, and I know how, Now far off, New light gilds the spruce tops. The saw, for a moment, ceases, and under Arm-pits of the blue-shirted sawyer sweat Beads cold, and In the obscene silence of the saw's cessation, A crow, somewhere, calls. When the "now" ceases there is an utter absence of Time that must be "supplemented," to use Derrida's term, by the sound of the crow, the call 13</page><page sequence="15">of the presencing voice. It is this voice, like the projected visions of eagle and gull, that attempts to veil the discontinuity of the "nows," the impos- sible irony of a temporal "eternal present." The voice of the crow provides what Derrida would call the "trace" of whatever lost past the self emerges from and which has not been retrieved as yet. The trace, a notion I will re- turn to later, provides no referential basis for reconstituting the self's his- tory, but only the basis for the question, "Have I learned how to live? " The answer is couched again in the deceptively confident "must" and "may," but in the end the poem slips back into what Heidegger calls the "ordinary conception of time" when it subordinates its hope to the clock: I must endeavor to learn what I must learn before I must learn The other thing. If I learn even a little, I may, By evening, be able To tell the man something. Or he himself may have learned by then. The function of the other man here, a dying neighbor, is similar to that of the birds; he provides another consciousness, a supplement to the poet's own point of view who might in turn provide the answers that the poet's failed, discontinuous vision cannot. Thus the man functions like what Jacques Lacan calls the Other as a symbolic link to the referential world of time from the frozen, Timeless abyss within which the poet finds his mo- ment frozen. A similar function is maintained by the generalized "you" in Warren's poems that always serves as both an indicator and supplement for the abyss the poems articulate.23 These discontinuities that are supplemented in "Youth" and "Chain Saw" occur between Time and what Warren often names "no- Time." In "There's A Grandfather's Clock In The Hall" (Or Else), he writes: "The minute hand stands still, then it jumps, and in between jumps there is no-Time." The empty abyss of the Timeless is, after all, only a form of clock time which can be restructured by the self's Time: "Hold your breath and wait.// Nothing happens, nothing happens, then suddenly, quick as a wink, and quick as a mink's prick, Time thrusts through the time of no-Time." Time becomes a kind of comically procreative act that supplements the gaps opened by a series of discontinuous "nows"-Time replaces time as the "time of no-Time." The repetition, through negative beginnings and re-beginnings where "nothing happens, nothing happens" thus establishes a structure of consciousness, a veil, across the abyss. The problem that Warren faces here, and throughout Or Else, is that although "we must think of the/ world as continuous" in order to es- tablish a coherent order, 14</page><page sequence="16">only, oh, on- ly in discontinuity, do we know that we exist, or that, in that deep- est sense, the existence of anything signifies more than the fact that it is continuous with the world. ("Interjection #2: Caveat") Derrida has explored how this "difference," founded upon a kind of Nietz- schean forgetfulness of the past, marks the relation between Being and beings, presence and absence, act and potential, center and horizon, au- thentic Time and everyday time,-the whole system of oppositions that founds Heidegger's thought. It is a forgetfulness, then, of authentic Time, a "falling" back into everyday time.24 It is this difference which allows Dasein to repeatedly recenter its world in the face of its dissolving mo- ments. Later in this poem, for example, Warren directs the reader to focus his eyes upon a single piece of gravel on a highway under construction: Then, remarkably, the bright sun jerks like a spastic, and all things seem to be spinning away from the univer- sal center that the single fragment of crushed rock has ineluctably become. What will result, eventually, is "the moment when, at last, the object screams// in an ecstasy of// being." The aim of such an intense conscious- ness of difference is what Heidegger calls the "rescue of things from mere objectness" (PLT, p. 130). In his essay, "Language," Heidegger describes "difference" as that which "stills the thing, as thing, into the world" (PL T, p. 206). It isolates the thing as stilled center-Warren's gravel-and yet that center sets in motion a world-Warren's "spinning away"-so that "the stil- ling of stillness, rest, conceived strictly, is always more in motion than all motion and always more restlessly active than any agitation" (PLT, pp. 206-7). The aim here is to convert stasis into action, the broken mo- ment into a new beginning. The roots of this notion go back, in modern times, to Hegel's moment of difference as both a "whirl" and a "repose" and which forms the basis of all Truth-"The appearance [reality, being] is the coming to be and passing away that itself does not come to be and pass away; it is in itself and constitutes the actuality and the movement of the life of the truth. The true is thus the bachanalian whirl in which no mem- ber is not drunken; and because each, as soon as it detaches itself, dissolves immediately-the whirl is just as much transparent and simple repose."25 The problem in "Chain Saw At Dawn" and "There's A Grandfather's Clock," for example, is that these two phases are not one; the stillness of the frozen moment has not been integrated with the passage of time. 15</page><page sequence="17">The whirl and the repose, difference itself, is manifest only in lan- guage. In "Brotherhood In Pain" (Can I See Arcturus From Where I Stand), Warren again asks us to focus upon an object: "You will suddenly observe an object in the obscene moment of birth." But here, coming to birth is a function of how we "name" the object, for we ourselves "exist only in the delerious illusion of language." Ultimately, then, it is language which overcomes the abyss, which fills it; in any work of art, Being itself is brought into, made manifest, in the "cleft" or "rift" as Heidegger calls it. Language, he says, "calls" us, suggests to us something of the nature of 3eing as the process of "homecoming" described earlier, and the "place of arrival which is also called in the calling, is a presence sheltered in absence" (PLT, p. 63). In An Introduction To Metaphysics Heidegger describes in detail how Being, Time, and language are intertwined; "the question of being will involve us deeply in the question of language," he says (IM, p. 51). As he analyzes the situation, "logos" meant originally a "gather- ing," and then, in relation to speech, the way things gradually, temporally appear in language's "calling." Precisely such a calling occurs in "The True Nature of Time" (Or Else). Here Warren describes the constantly deferred approach of a lover towards his beloved and the suspended time of a re- membered past which they shared when "a gull, in the last light, hung." Called by the sound of gulls, he senses Time again coming to a stillness. At the end of the poem he asks- How May I know the true nature of Time, if Deep now in darkness that glittering enclave I dream, hangs? It shines. Another Wind blows there, the sea-cliffs, Far in that blue wind, swing. Wind Lifts the brightening of hair. The distant wind of Time stirs almost imperceptibly at the heart of time- less Being; but the center and the absent, invisible horizon are related by the language of the poem: Out of the silence, the saying. Into The silence, the said. Thus Silence, in timelessness, gives forth Time, and receives it again. It is in the breaking out of the abyss of silence through language that Time is created as the supplement of that abyss. It is in silence that one drowns in timelessness, as Warren says in "Timeless, Twinned," in which it seems that one has "forgot all other nights and days,/ Anxiety of the future's 16</page><page sequence="18">snore, or nag of history (Being Here). It is for this reason that language, as Heidegger says in "Holderlin and the Essence of Poetry," is the foundation of Being: it is only language that affords the very possibility of standing in the openness of the existent. Only where there is language, is there world, i.e., the perpetually al- tering circuit of decision and production, but also of commotion and arbitrariness, of decay and confusion. Only where world predominates, is there history. Lan- guage is a possession in a . . . fundamental sense. It is good for the fact that . .. man can exist historically.26 It is the poet who manipulates language best, who makes of it the "span" which crosses the abyss. For Heidegger, all works of art create and fill this abyss; the poem itself is its own "cleft" marking the difference between Time and "no-Time," engaging the utter emptiness of that abyss, its utter loss of referentiality, loss of relation to the self-but also remaking that self, that Time in recentering the moment (PLT, pp. 220 and 63). In this way, all art is a beginning, a re-founding, a futural projection, a "leap." Thus he writes: "A genuine beginning, as a leap, is always a head start, in which everything to come is already leaped over .... The beginning al- ready contains the end latent within itself" (PLT, p. 76). It is in this way, he goes on to say, that history, as a "grounding" of the self, begins. The "leap," in fact, is related to the "retrieve" we saw in the first section in that the aim of the "retrieve" is to "transform" the past "into a new be- ginning." But, says Heidegger, "we do not repeat a beginning by reducing it to something past and now known, which need merely be imitated; no, the beginning must be begun again, more radically, with all the strange- ness, darkness, insecurity that attend a true beginning" (IM, p. 39). The in- security, the "tremor" of any leap stems from a consciousness of the abyss, the knowledge that a profound absence hollows at the presences we make for ourselves. One of the clearest examples of such a Heideggerian leap, and a poem which also charts the progress of the moment as I have given it thus far in this essay, is "Sunset Walk in Thaw Time in Vermont" (Or Else). The poem, which is divided into four parts, begins with a sudden loss. The poet confronts the sudden "Rip, whoosh, wing-whistle" of a partridge which "plunges" towards the sky and suddenly "Is/ Gone." Now, "In the ensuing/ Silence, abrupt," the poet stares at the western horizon, emptied, and hears, "In my chest, as from a dark cave of/ No-Time, the heart/ Beat." The sense of loss and absence, of timelessness, is overcome as the poet "begins to hear" in the second section a "stream, thaw-flooding." The sound provides the sort of "calling" I described above, and it leads the poet to "see" in his "imagination" the water itself. The call, that is, pro- 17</page><page sequence="19">vides the basis upon which the horizon is expanded and the repose again infused with the whirl; the darkening frozen landscape is counterpointed against the beginning sounds of movement, of whirl, under the ice. Yet by the third section the integrated movement of the moment of vision again breaks down and a radically new discontinuity opens up: On the same spot in summer, at thrush hour, I, As the last light fails, have heard that full Shadow-shimmered and deep glinting liquidity, and Again will, but not now. Even the hope of future repetition becomes thwarted, though. For as he continues to stare westward, hearing only a vague sound of ice-locked water, and trying to discover "Whatever depth of being I am" and what- ever "soul-stillness" he still has, he confronts again the frozen landscape that seems to overcome him. As darkness "coagulates," he finds himself lost in an abyss, surrounded by an impersonal, "massive geometry," a deathly repose. The solution emerges as suddenly as the problem and con- stitutes the leap itself. The poet projects ahead fifty years, to when his son is an old man, and with the hope- That some time, in thaw-season, at dusk, standing At woodside and staring Red-westward, with the sound of moving water In his ears, he Should thus, in that future moment, bless, Forward into that future's future, And old man who, as he is mine, had once Been his small son. For what blessing may a man hope for but An immortality in The loving vigilance of death? In this sudden futural expansion of the moment from out of the abyss of the previous section, a new beginning is made, a new history for the self is written in the Wordsworthian language of the blessing. The blessing pro- vides what Heidegger calls a "saying" in which occurs a "projecting of the clearing, in which announcement is made of what it is that beings come into the Open as (PL T, p. 73). This projecting-clearing is the expansion of horizons, the creation of Time. The blessing is a "saying" in a distinctly Heideggerian sense; it both calls and is called by Being (BT, pp. 163-65 and 273-75). It is, he says, a "listening," what he sees as analogous to the "holding back" or resoluteness in the "anticipatory resoluteness" that we saw defines the moment of vision (PL T, pp. 209-10).That is, it is a "voice" that establishes presence by both inserting itself and recognizing itself as a 18</page><page sequence="20">Time structure in the world. Saying is the means by which possibility is ap- propriated, what is anticipated is brought near, and the silence of the abyss filled. The burden, then, is upon the imagination to generate "nows," how- ever discontinuously they seem to be brought into consciousness. In "Identity and Argument for Prayer," Warren writes, for example: Thinking now that at least you are you, Saying now, saying now, for Now now is all, and you you. At least, for a minute. The saying is always provisional, always preparing for its own unsaying, its own silence, the abyss that lurks within the voice, the falling towards inau- thentic time that the voice cannot avoid. III The Earliness of the Moment Saying, as the way-making movement of the world's fourfold, gathers all things up into the nearness of face- to-face encounter, and does so soundlessly, as quietly as time times, space spaces, as quietly as the play of time- space is enacted. -Heidegger, "The Nature of Language" In his essay, "The Way to Language," Heidegger distinguishes be- tween two functions of language-"stipulation," which designates the way in which we are directed from one object to another-and "showing," which "makes something come to light" (OWL, p. 115). It is this second function which Heidegger evokes in his analyses of "Saying," but as useful as the notion is, it is not without its difficulties. In Kant and the Problem of Metaphysics he had associated the full presence of the moment of time- formation with the representational power of language and of mind. In- deed, it is this representational power which allows Warren in "Sunset Walk" to conjure up the picture of the river, and a new horizon from its slight sound, and then to leap toward, presence, represent the "now" fifty years hence. This "showing" power of language to represent presence is evident, Heidegger says in the old German word, "sagan," which meant both an allowing to be seen and to say (OWL, p. 142)-it acts to construct a referential theory of art. But, if beneath the language of the moment the abyss still lurks, if the moment itself, moreover, is hollowed by absence, how is representation grounded? how can there be a referential art? how can a poem then mean? The problem, for Warren, is faced in "Two Poems 19</page><page sequence="21">about Suddenly and a Rose" (Tale of Time) when Warren once again de- scribes a sudden discontinuity: Suddenly, Is. Now not what was not, But what is. From nothing of not Now all of is. All is. Is light, and suddenly Dawn-and the world, in blaze of is. Later, he tries to provide the discontinuity with meaning-"suddenly, everything/ Happens// . . .. suddenly/ Life takes on a new dimension"- but then he undercuts himself: "Christ, believe that/ And you'll believe anything." He finally ends by exclaiming "Suddenly is too sudden to tell," thus acknowledging a failure at least of "stipulative" language. Yet the poem does "tell" something, "shows" a sense of the Being of the moment. If, as Warren says, we "exist only in the delirious illusion of lan- guage," it is this language of "showing" that we need to explore further. Heidegger writes: "The nature of language does not exhaust itself in signi- fying, nor is it merely something that has the character of sign or cipher" (PL T, p. 132). What we must give attention to, Heidegger says in several essays, is rather the "path of saying." Thus his "teacher" says in a dia- logue: "A word does not and never can re-present anything; but signifies something, that is, shows something as abiding into the range of its expres- sibility."27 For Heidegger, language is a form of energia, a "force" as Derrida would call it that motivates and reveals Being as a temporal activi- ty: "Language speaks in that it, as showing, reaching into all regions of presences, summons from them whatever is present to appear and to fade. We, accordingly, listen to language in this way, that we let it say its Saying to us" (OWL, p. 124). What we experience in this saying is a "nearness" which "manifests itself as the motion," the path, "in which the world's re- gions face each other" (OWL, pp. 106-7). It is, in fact, this very motion, the trace of the path itself, which constitutes authentic Time. This is some- thing, for instance, of what Warren is trying to express at the end of Audubon, where he hears geese passing north: Tell me a story. In this century, and moment, of mania, Tell me a story. Make it a story of great distances, and starlight. The name of the story will be Time, But you must not pronounce its name. Tell me a story of deep delight. 20</page><page sequence="22">For Heidegger, such an evocation reveals the "design" of language as the unity of Time and Being; it is the metaphoric impulse at the heart of all language. The "design" cannot be known outright, is always veiled like Warren's geese; it is a "trace" cut out of or into a larger ground (OWL, p. 121). More specifically, then, Being and Time are given metonymically in poetry. They must always be talked around, traced, recentered. It is the poet's task, Heidegger says in "What Are Poets For? ," to recover some of the "traces" from the abyss. Rather than a statically centered, purely ref- erential moment, a moment of clear origins, there is instead the moment of traces, of re-beginnings in the shadows of the abyss (PL T, pp. 93-4). In fact, instead of continuing to think of the moment in terms of the "hori- zon," Heidegger increasingly thinks in terms of the more evasive "release- ment," something akin to the "opening up" we saw earlier. The Heideg- gerian trace can be understood as a concealment or denial of Being by the historical self, the sort of withholding I described earlier that produces the "lasting" quality of authentic Time: Never-yes, never-before these months just past Had I known the nature of Time and felt its strong heart Pulse, stroke by stroke, against my own, like love, But love without face or shape or history: Pure Being that, by being, Being denies. The trace suggests something of the repose of Being and Time amidst our historical experience of being and time. The voice of the trace becomes like that of the murdered slave in Brother to Dragons who speaks only three lines. Warren says of him in an interview: "I wanted him to be there all the time. I wanted his presence to speak, his experience to speak,"28 Yet if, as Warren echoes in Audubon, "For everything there is a season," there is also "the dream/ Of a season past all seasons," a dream of pure, stable communication, pure referentiality. But such a dream is only that, and impossible-in fact, it becomes a part of Time's language itself. To fully and purely secure such a dream, anyway, would be simply to fall into the abyss. The abyss of the origin is simply the incapacitating en- tanglement of endless nostalgias. This is the problem in "Heart of the Backlog" (Now and Then). The poem is addressed to someone who simply measures the past as it literally burns in the old logs of a fire, and who wonders with the speaker, "What, oh, is Time! " but who remains passive, a victim of nostalgia. Warren prescribes instead a going forth, the radical new beginning, the new "listening," I described at the end of the previous section: Has the thought ever struck you to rise and go forth- yes, lost 21</page><page sequence="23">In the whiteness-to never look upward, or back, only on, And no sound but the snow-crunch, and breath Gone crisp like the crumpling of paper? Listen! Could that be the creak of a wing-joint gigantic in distance? No, no-just a tree, far off, when ice inward bites. No, no, don't look back-oh, I beg you! I beg you not to look back, in God's name. Yet the temptation persists, as it has through the history of poetry, that we might conjure with our words some pure origin, untouched by our am- biguities, revealing some absolute, eternal truth beyond language: If only I could say just the first word with breath As sweet as a Babe's and with no history-but, Christ, If there is no history there is no story. And no Time, no word. For then there is nothing for a word to be about, a word Being frozen time only. ("How to Tell a Love Story," Now and Then) But to achieve an absolute origin would be to arrive at a moment when no- thing has happened, a time "bleached of all content." In addition, the meaning of an origin, the past, can only be known, can only be verbalized, in retrospect, in time. So the origin, as Heidegger suggests, continually withdraws as the poet's language attempts to approach it ("The Nature of Language," Now and Then): If only the story could begin when Time truly began White surf and a storm of sunlight, you running ahead and a smile Back-flung-but then, how go on? For what would it mean? Perhaps I can't say the first word till I know what it all means Perhaps I can't know till finally the doctor comes in and leans. 22</page><page sequence="24">The coincidence of founding word and original time never occurs; we can- not arrive at "when Time truly began," even in language, for there is al- ways an echo, a trace, a "ghost," sounding from farther back. But because of this labyrinthine structure of time given over by language, the moment can be understood not as a vanishing point in a regressive sequence, but as part of a vast, ever-emerging architecture. Rather than positing an origin, Heidegger writes, "True time is the arrival of that which has been. This is not what is past, but rather the gathering of essential being, which pre- cedes all arrival in gathering itself into the shelter of what it was earlier be- fore the given moment" (OWL, p. 176). Rather than positing an origin, the moment appropriates the trace of a past, even a history, in its own futural enterprise, its own re-beginning as a form of what Heidegger calls "earli- ness." And so, as Warren says, "Moments not quite ready to be shaped are already there, waiting, and we feel their presence."29 Perhaps it is worth amplifying further the danger of attempting to simply "repose" in the nostalgia of a static origin. "American Portrait: Old Style," the opening poem of Now and Then, relates something of the life- long relation between the narrator and "K," beginning in a time, years earlier, when they were unable to feel the civil war history in the land around them and so "had to invent it all" in their play. Imagination thus becomes their supreme fiction, a means to mold and alter time- Yes, a day is merely forever In memory's shiningness, And a year but a gust or a gasp In the summer's heat of Time, and in that last summer I was almost ready to learn What imagination is-it is only The lie we must learn to live by, if ever We mean to live at all. The danger is that the fiction, to "lie," may become merely solipsistic, nostalgic, and that the sectioned form of the narrative wander in its own nostalgias; hence that time may not be given direction. K, an aimless drunk later in his life, lives lost in a lost past; even the poem nearly succumbs to a return to his nai've past: "How the late summer's thinned-out sky moves,/ Drifting on, drifting on, like forever,/ From where on to where, and I wonder/ What it would be like to die." But the very consciousness of the mortality of his life reinvests the moment in time, and the poet simply re- begins, moves on: "But why should I lie here longer? / I am not dead yet." It is the poet's meditation on his present and past language for grasping the world that leads to his re-beginning; he effects what Heidegger calls a "de- struction"30 of his old metaphors and, in the abyss that is left and which almost entraps him, he finds a "clearing" through which he will propose new metaphors-the poems, in fact, that constitute the rest of the book. 23</page><page sequence="25">As Heidegger says in his analysis of Nietzsche's destructions, "meditation on language and its historical dimension is always the action which gives shape to Dasein itself."31 The language of poetry, then, is a language of silences, is itself constituted by traces, by words that cannot fully embrace the dynamics of being. In "Code Book Lost" (Now and Then) the speaker wonders what a veery says: "There must be some meaning, or why should your heart stop,// As though, in the dark depth of water, Time held its breath." Later in the poem he exclaims: "The whole world pours at us. But the code book, somehow, is lost." Even when the poet can stand where the present "landscape now reduplicates" the old one where he "once stood," there is an "immense distance" across which he glimpses "without being able/ To make adequate communication" ("Mountain Plateau," Now and Then). Thus not only the moment but the whole structure of time remains eva- sive: Yes, I once stood there, and now have Just dreamed, in painful vividness, of standing Again there, but if I should, I have it on good authority, that There is not there any more, Having dropped through Time into otherness. But what did happen there is-just now In its new ectoplasmic context- Happening again even if The companion who smiled in that dusk long ago, and Smiles now again-ah, new innocence, For now freed from Time- Is long dead, and I Am not always readily certain Of the name now. ("Identity and Argument for Prayer") The amorphous structure of time is revealed by the play between a vague "earliness" and forgetfulness, perception and anticipation in the dream context. The structure recalls Freud's analysis of the temporality of fan- tasy-a "current" impression "wanders" back towards a past in a way that recalls the structure of the moment in Husserl and Bergson: "Then it cre- ates for itself a situation which is to emerge in the future, representing the fulfilment of the wish-this is the day-dream or phantasy, which now car- ries in it traces both of the occasion which engendered it and of some past memory. So past, present and future are threaded, as it were, on the string of the wish that runs through them all."32 This evasiveness of the trace, the unnamable essence of being, is owing to the difficult connection be- tween language and dream, the unconscious. In Audubon, the speaker 24</page><page sequence="26">listens: "The world declares itself. That voice/ Is vaulted in-oh, arch on arch-redundancy of joy." But he also asks: "Why/ Therefore, is truth the only thing that cannot/ Be spoken? " The answer, he goes on to speak, is that truth "can only be enacted, and that in dream." There is a distinction implicit here between language as "enactment"-Jacques Lacan has demonstrated how the unconscious is structured like a language-and lan- guage as communication of facts, a distinction along the lines of Heideg- ger's "showing" and "designating" functions of language.33 Warren ends the poem, for example, by once again appealing to the primacy of lan- guage in determining and receiving Time-"Tell us, dear God-tell us the sign/ Whereby we may know the time has come." What he is after, as he says in speaking of Ransom's work, "is a very intense reality which exists in the language, created in the language."34 How, then, is a sense of the depth of Being uncovered in a Warren poem where "adequate communication" is impossible? How, in the realm of our own language, are signs told to us? How can we say them? It is helpful to refer to Paul Ricoeur's discussion of poetic referentiality. Using Ramon Jakobson's notion of "split reference," of the priority of the "poetic function" over any "referential function," Ricoeur suggests that "the meaning of a metaphorical statement rises up from the blockage of any literal interpretation of the statement .... The entire strategy of po- etic discourse plays upon this point: it seeks the abolition of reference by means of self-destruction of the meaning of metaphorical statements, the self-destruction being made manifest by an impossible literal interpreta- tion."35 But what this blockage or self-destruction of the "referential" in favor of the "poetic" accomplishes is "the negative condition of the ap- pearance of a more fundamental mode of reference." This mode of refer- ence is broader than the word or even the sentence; it involves a "suspen- sion" of a primary "meaning" in order to allow the physical, iconic nature of language to form the basis of a "reality" that is difficult to penetrate: Language takes on the thickness of a material or a medium. The sensible, sensual plenitude of the poem is like that of painted or sculptured forms. The combi- nation of sensual and logical ensures that expression and impression coalesce within the poetic thing. Poetic sig- nification fused thus with its sensible vehicle becomes that particular and "thingy" reality we call a poem.36 For Ricoeur, as for Jakobson, the poetic "meaning" is ambiguous-and there is always a hermeneutics that can uncover it; for Warren, as we saw in Audubon, the name must not be pronounced. Thus, Heidegger says, "Poetry's spoken words shelter the poetic statement as that which by its essential nature remains unspoken."37 What, we must finally ask in the face of this suspension of meaning and 25</page><page sequence="27">the role of the unconscious, is the status of the self and the moment it cre- ates? In "Dream" Warren writes: Waters, hypnotic, long after moonset, murmur Under your window, and Time Is only a shade on the underside of the beech-leaf Which, upward, reflects a tiny refulgence of stars. What can you dream to make Time real again? The dream of time, though, is not a passive one, not purely unconscious, for it involves active struggle, an almost Hegelian fight for self-definition: Yes, grapple-or else the Morning Star Westward will pale, and leave Your ghost without history even, to wander A desert trackless in sun-glare. For the dream is only a self of yourself-and Jacob Once wrestled, nightlong, his angel and, though With wrenched thigh, had blackmailed a blessing, by dawn. And of course this blessing lasts only until the next night, the hypnotic moment we saw Jed Tewksbury trapped in earlier, until the dream and struggling birth into time again. More problematic is the teleology of the whole process,-of the self, too, for "Dream" is followed in Now And Then by "Dream of a Dream." In "Dream of a Dream" Time becomes not a matter of logical meaning or presences, but the random "flux" of absences, of the "no- thing" that "glimmers," the unconscious that undermines consciousness: Moonlight stumbles with bright heel In the stream, and the stones sing. What they sing is nothing, nothing, But the joy Time plies to feel In fraternal flux and glimmer With the stream that does not know Its destination and knows no Truth but its own moonlit shimmer. In my dream Time and water interflow, And bubbles of consciousness glimmer ghostly as they go. What we encounter is the imagination's, language's, labyrinth of endless referentiality-"deferred" by the traces, the "nothing" that is sung. 26</page><page sequence="28">Symbols, signifiers, times, mean other symbols, signifiers, times: "From what dream to what dream do we/ Awake." Even towards the end of this poem, when the poet seems finally on the threshold of finding "what moon/ Defines the glimmer and froth of self before it is gone," he must concede that "this, of course, belongs to the dream of another dream." Time becomes known by the differences established between discontinu- ous moments, experienced by a central self which yet finds "definition" in that very experience. Even the self, then, must be understood as a "trace," a "ghost" that must always be marked over once again, that dissolves and is created in the process of generating its own history. This is not to sug- gest, in the end, that Warren's view of the self and its time is simply inco- herent, especially in the light of the way his characters rest their being in empirical experience; it is only that he recognizes, with Heidegger in Intro- duction To Metaphysics, that "the understanding of being resides first and foremost in a vague, indefinite meaning, and yet remains certain and defi- nite" (IM, p. 83) as a temporal experience. Warren's vision of Time, finally, is one of "generosity," a "hand- ing over," as Heidegger calls it, of the self through the language of the poem, a handing over of the history the self generates through its own verbal presences. Time is a presencing of the self to and for the world; it is a "saying" that includes but goes beyond words-that goes beyond, final- ly, the abyss of the isolated moment itself, for in the end all moments be- come part of the dissolving and solidifying. I want to conclude by referring to "Night Walking," a recent poem which is like a companion piece to "Sunset Walk in Thaw Time" but which provides, despite its abysses, a more continuous sense of rebeginning.38 In the poem Warren describes his son "breeched but bare/ From waist" rising one night and climbing a hill to face the moon, and the poet too watches, remembering a past far away, turning his attention to the horizon of mountains and then to the move- ment of his son disappearing over a ridge. Then, at the end of the poem, Warren himself pauses, remembers one of his own moments of vision and resulting experience of Being too intense to name, but a moment nonethe- less that can be "said" in the "path" the poem takes. It leads him finally to address the now absent son, to presence him (and us), to gather the son along with the two moments of vision into the moment of the poem itself, to gather in a sense the whole vision of Time I have been describing in this paper. The abysses within and between these moments are filled so gener- ously by the last lines. What is recognized there, what is spoken, is not a static meaning, but the drama of our existence in a Time we must always make, always remain open to, even as we always fail to name it: I stop As one paralyzed at a sudden brink opened up, For a recollection, sudden, has come from long back- Moon-walking on sea cliffs, I 27</page><page sequence="29">Had once dreamed to a wisdom I could not name, I heard no voice in the heat, just the hum of the wires. But that is my luck. Not yours. At any rate, you must swear never, Not even in secret, the utmost, to be ashamed To have lifted arms up to that icy Blaze and transforming light of the world.
