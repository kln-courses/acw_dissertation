<plain_text><page sequence="1">COUNTING POTS IN EARLY NEOLITHIC GREECE' (PLATES 1-3) INTRODUCTION POTTERY is usually found in large quantities filling up the available storerooms very quickly, to the dismay of the Museum's curators. After collecting, washing, marking, and finally studying thousands of sherds from the settlement under study, the archaeologist can often be under the impression that pottery was plentiful. Ceramic vessels, however, are fragile and many sherds are needed to restore a single vessel. Thus, in order to form an idea of the number of vessels used by the inhabitants of a site, we have to move-with the help of quantitative analysis-from sherds to vessels. Combined with technological, functional, and contextual data, the estimated number of vessels can help us to address questions about the organization and function of the ceramic production. In the present work, we shall review the available data on the quantity of pottery found at the Greek Early Neolithic sites, and try to assess the role of the ceramic containers in this early period. Discussion will be based mainly on the analytically studied and published ceramic data from the sites of Nea Nikomedeia in Macedonia, Achilleion in Thessaly, and Franchthi in the Peloponnese (FIG. 1). Whenever possible, discussion will be enriched with data from other Early Neolithic sites. The first quantitative analysis, concerning the Early and Middle Neolithic material from Franchthi, was published in 1989.

A similar conclusion was reached for the absence or limited use of cooking vessels among the Early Neolithic pottery from Achilleion and Nea Nikomedeia.4 In consequence, the Early Neolithic pots from Greece are interpreted, as special-occasion, high status objects, used mainly for ceremonial purposes and display.5 It seems, however, that the early Neolithic pots were not so rare as has been suggested. In the present work it will be argued that ceramic containers were quite common at Nea Nikomedeia, where, according to the quantitative analysis of the material, c. 75-270 pots were used simultaneously in an area occupied by four to six buildings. Nea Nikomedeia provides the only relatively large-scale excavation of an Early Neolithic village in Greece. Furthermore, re-examination of the published data from Franchthi indicates that annual ceramic production may have been higher than was originally estimated. The same could be suggested for the site of Achilleion. Review of the data from other ceramic assemblages reveals that in most cases the available information is too poor to provide a safe basis for comparisons between assemblages. It would seem, however, that the data from the few better documented sites do not support the rarity of pottery in the Early Neolithic. Perhaps, a limited use of ceramics could be argued for the Early Neolithic I Sesklo (Monochrome Phase) and the 'Aceramic' strata from a few sites, if we accept as non-intrusive the ceramics found in them. In this article, the symbolic character of ceramics is not denied, but it will be argued that the available data do not support an exclusively symbolic character of the Early Neolithic ceramic production as a whole. Clay cooking vessels were most probably absent or very limited in number, but pottery which is varied in shape and size, and not necessarily rare, has a relatively uniform distribution over the excavated parts of the settlements, and is found in habitation contexts in association with other classes of tools and the remains of subsistence activities. It could then be suggested that ceramics had an active role in everyday activities, and were used for a variety of tasks such as storing, manipulation of raw materials (including food), transport/transfer, etc. The present work falls into three sections. The available quantitative studies of the Early Neolithic ceramics are examined first, followed by the functional analysis of pots from Nea Nikomedeia, Achilleion, and Franchthi. In the light of this, the role of the pottery in the Early Neolithic sites is discussed in the final section. The process of adoption of pottery, although a related topic, is not discussed in the present work. 2 Vitelli 1989 and 1993a. 3 Perlis and Vitelli 1999; Perlis 2001, 215; D. W.

In order to estimate the average surface area of the Nea Nikomedeia pot, the average surface area of each form was calculated.7 This was accomplished by using the data from the histogram of rim-diameters for the sherds of each form. Taking into consideration the frequency of occurrence of each vessel form, the average surface area of the Nea Nikomedeia pot was calculated to be equal to 1,205 cm2. Dividing the total surface area (1,343,400 cm2) of the ceramic material from the main excavation grid by the average surface area of the Nea Nikomedeia pot, the equivalent number of vessels was found to equal 111 5. Of course, we can not expect that re-assembling the 140,00ooo sherds recovered from the main excavation grid would produce 1115 whole or almost whole vessels. As Orton remarks, 'even if we suppose that all pots used at one site were discarded there and the site is completely excavated, there always seem to be some sherds missing'.8 A variety of post-depositional factors (such as natural weathering processes, scavenging etc.) can be responsible for this. Excavation techniques also have an impact on recovery. During the excavations at Nea Nikomedeia, for example, sieving was not employed. Thus, although sherds with a surface area of 3-4 cm' were regularly present during the macroscopic examination of the material, smaller fragments were absent. How can the absence of smaller sherds affect estimations of the minimum number of pots from the site? Data from Franchthi indicate that after sieving, the amount of the recovered material increased by c. 17%/0.9 Partial excavation of archaeological sites also affects such estimations.1o Human beings can alter their living space while they are occupying it. Thus, in the case of repeatedly occupied sites, the preparation of the ground for the building of new structures is expected to have affected the number of sherds deposited in the earlier strata. At Nea Nikomedeia three phases of Early Neolithic occupation were distinguished. Traces of a Late Neolithic occupation have also been found. The three Early Neolithic phases appear to follow in relatively swift succession and their structures are wholly or partly overlapping." Thus, even if we suppose that the debris of the old structures (building material and the 6 Rodden, in his post-excavation work, counted and measured the surface area of the monochrome and decorated sherds from Nea Nikomedeia. The surface area of the pottery from the main excavation grid (squares A1-M8) was calculated to be equal to 1,343,4oo cm'. It has to be pointed out, however, that he did not record the number of sherds (and their surface area) of all excavation squares from the main excavation grid. In all, the relevant information is available for 83% of the main excavation grid. Therefore, when the main excavation grid is mentioned in the text, only 83% of this is represented. This corresponds to 264 m' from spit 1 and 184 m' from spit 2 (see P. Yiouni, 'The Pottery from Nea Nikomedeia in its Balkan Context', unpublished Ph.D. diss. University of London, 1991, fig. 6. 7-8). 7 The ceramic material from the site was grouped into six vessel forms: neck-jars, vessels with rim angle &gt; 1150, vessels with rim angle 91o-1140, vessels with rim angle 850-900, vessels with rim angle 6oo0-840 and vessels with a rim angle &lt; 60o.

Broken pottery may be recycled and used for a variety of purposes.12 In other cases, new items are produced from the broken ceramic material. At Nea Nikomedeia such objects are the so-called clay roundels, which are quite common: more than 400 items have been found in the main excavation grid. Similar objects have been found in other Neolithic sites.'3 Recycling is a destructive process because in order to produce, for example, a clay roundel, parts of the sherd must be chipped away or even pulverized. In order to assert the relationship between the amount of pottery originally deposited at a site and the amount of pottery actually recovered from the site, the recovery rate of the ceramic material should be estimated. At Nea Nikomedeia the opportunity for such an estimate was offered by two very rare categories of decorated vessels: the white-on-red painted pottery and the pottery with impressed decoration, which amount to 4%/0 and 9%/0 of the decorated pottery respectively; decorated pottery amounting to 4%/ of the total ceramic assemblage. Taking into consideration the number of different vessels distinguished-by macroscopic examination- for each of these two categories, and the portion of vessels bearing decorative motifs, the recovery rate of the ceramic material from Nea Nikomedeia was estimated to be c. 25- 30%/0. This figure means that the material originally used at the site might have been 333- 400%/0 more than the material collected during the excavation of the settlement. It can be proposed then that the number of vessels that entered the archaeological deposit of the main excavation grid at Nea Nikomedeia range from 3,700 to 4,500. It should be acknowledged that some of the sherds within the excavated area may be 'intrusive' from other parts of the site. The 'intrusions' increase the number of pots distinguished by macroscopic examination, thus decreasing the estimated recovery rate. This effect depends greatly on the proportion of the site that had been dug. At Nea Nikomedeia the main excavation grid, opened at the central part of the settlement, covers around 8%/ of the site. On the other hand, the method of assigning the white-on-red and the sherds with impressed decoration into individual vessels increases the recovery rate, since only very distinct sherds (in terms of shape/paste/decoration) were considered as individual vases. It is probable then that sherds from different vases, which showed similarities in form, paste or decoration, were grouped as a single vase. Early Neolithic Nea Nikomedeia was occupied over a period of 50 to 15o years.'4 Thus the minimum annual production can be estimated to be roughly 25-90 pots per year. It should be pointed out that this estimate concerns only the main excavation grid of Nea Nikomedeia. In this area parts of six structures of the first and second building periods have been revealed. In the third period the area was more sparsely occupied since parts of only four structures have been identified. The main grid accounts for around 8%/0 of the mound of Nea Nikomedeia. We have to suppose however that the sample of pottery available at any time at Nea Nikomedeia was larger because we cannot assume that all vessels were broken within one " Rice 1987, table 9.3.

The available estimates-based on the ethnographic data--of the longevity of vessels indicate a life-expectancy of between three and five years, with a few ceramic assemblages with lower or higher longevity.'s Of course, these data cannot be taken at face value, since the longevity of vessels is affected by many factors such as the attitudes towards ceramic production, the quality of fabric, forming techniques, intended use, presence of children or animals, etc.'6 Such estimates, however, can give a good idea about the bulk of the pottery available to the Neolithic people. As it is important to know that the sherds found in the main excavation grid can be 'translated', after the estimation of pottery recovery rate, into c. 4000 pots instead of the original estimate of 1115, it is equally important to realize that each building of the main excavation grid at Nea Nikomedeia was probably furnished with a large number of vessels (c. 13-45 pots simultaneously, assuming an average life-expectancy of three years).'7 QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE VESSELS FROM FRANCHTHI The weight of sherds was the analytical currency used by Vitelli in order to estimate the minimum number of vessels from Franchthi. Taking the weight of a typical Early Neolithic vessel as an average, together with the total weight of pottery recovered from Early Neolithic contexts, and adjusting for an estimated percentage of the site actually excavated (2/0%) and the length of time represented by the Early Neolithic deposits (c. 400 years on the basis of C'4 dates), the annual production for the whole site (the cave and the Paralia settlement) was estimated to be roughly i 2-13 pots per year.18 Compared with the data from Nea Nikomedeia where each building was estimated to have 13-45 pots simultaneously, the annual ceramic production at Franchthi appears to be very limited. Could this variation be attributed to differences between the two methods employed in the quantification of the ceramic assemblages? Measurement of surface area and sherd-weight are comparable methods.'9 At Nea Nikomedeia closer estimates were made possible because the method developed for the quantification of ceramics takes into consideration both the frequency of occurrence and the size-range of each vessel form. This factor alone however, cannot explain such a great difference. One factor that greatly increases the minimum number of pots from Nea Nikomedeia is the estimation of the recovery rate of ceramics. This parameter is not estimated for the ceramic assemblage of Franchthi, although the amount of pottery originally deposited at this site was affected, as at Nea Nikomedeia, by many factors. As Vitelli remarks, most of the Franchthi deposits probably represent secondary disposal of materials. Moreover, 15 Data presented in Rice 1987, table 9.4. See also A. Mayor, 'Durbes de vie des c~ramiques africaines: facteurs responsables et implications archdologiques', Terre cuite et sociiti: la ciramique, document technique, iconomique et culture. Actes des XIVeme rencontres internationales d'archiologie et d'histoire d'Antibes (Juan-les-Pins, 1994), 179-98. Cooking vessels usually have a shorter life-span than the other functional categories. Since cooking pots were not clearly identified among the Early Neolithic ceramics, the estimates on the longevity of clay pots do not take into consideration the data for cooking vessels. 16 For more discussion see Rice 1987, 298. 17 The minimum annual production has been estimated to be roughly 25-90 pots per year. Thus for the first and second building periods we can estimate 4.2 to 15 pots per year per structure. Assuming three-year longevity of the vessels, our estimates increase to 13-45 pots per structure. Assuming five year longevity, our estimates increase to u1-75 pots for each structure of the first and second building periods. In Yiouni 1996c, 185, the number of pots estimated in use is considerably smaller, since the data on the life-expectancy of the clay vessels were not taken into consideration. '8 Vitelli 1989, 21.

Vince, Pottery in Archaeology (Cambridge, 1993), 168.</page><page sequence="7">COUNTING POTS IN EARLY NEOLITHIC GREECE 7 repeated occupation resulted in considerable reworking of the cave sediments.20 Vitelli was very careful in studying material from contexts undisturbed by post-Neolithic digging. Such a practice secures the formation of sound typological classifications. But as far as the quantification of the assemblage is concerned, it can be expected that the successive occupation of the space somehow influenced the distribution and the amount of the material from the earlier phases. Recycling of pottery also occurred at Franchthi and the excavations of the cave offered evidence for the collection of Neolithic sherds, in Post-Neolithic periods.21 Of course, Vitelli was aware of these factors; that is why she comments that 'even if the estimate (12-13 pots) is off by a magnitude of two or three, production was still within the capacity of a single potter'." Vitelli's estimates concern the whole site of Franchthi whereas the minimum number of pots estimated for Nea Nikomedeia comes from an area covered by parts of four to six buildings. This points to a significant difference between the two assemblages. Can this difference be attributed to the different role that pottery played at these two settlements? Before we examine this hypothesis, however, we need to consider other factors such as the type and the duration of occupation of each settlement. The site of Franchthi comprises a cave and an open area in front of it (Paralia). In contrast to Nea Nikomedeia, the architectural remains from Paralia are very poor, consisting mainly of retaining walls and parts of clay floors which most probably define activity areas. If these areas were sheltered, the inhabitants of Franchthi must have used light structures built of ephemeral materials. In terms of duration of occupation and settlement, the use of such materials may represent mobility and portability."3 The shallowness of the Early Neolithic deposits and the absence of repeated occupation horizons indicate, according to Vitelli, that a limited number of people must have moved their locus of activity at Paralia periodically. As a result, the same sequence of events did not take place in any two excavated areas.24 Few Early Neolithic remains were discovered in the cave. It is argued by Vitelli, however, that if the cave was used during the Early Neolithic in a pattern comparable with that suggested for Paralia, the trench locations within the cave may not coincide with the Early Neolithic locus of activity. Alternatively, if the Early Neolithic activities were concentrated near the mouth of the cave, boulders from the brow collapses would now cover them. 'Thus, it seems safest to conclude only that both cave and Paralia were utilized in FCP 1 and that neither area was occupied in its entirety and continuously throughout that phase.'25 It is of interest to note here that for the Middle Neolithic of Franchthi, where more pottery has been estimated, Vitelli has suggested a more regular occupation of the site: 'In FCP2, when similar sequences do occur in more than one area, the pattern of using Paralia space and probably the size of the population had changed. More people in the FCP2 conducted similar activities at one time on Paralia'.26 20 Vitelli 1993a, 31, 32~, 34 n. 8. 21 SIbid., 41, lo8, 34 n. 13. 22 Vitelli 1995, 6o. 23 SD. W.

Faced with these data, a number of problems arise in relating the quantitative analysis of ceramics with the duration of occupation and the number of people that used the pottery. According to Vitelli's quantitative analysis, the amount of pottery recovered from the excavated section of the Early Neolithic settlement at Paralia (c. 74 kg of pottery from an area of c. 65 m2) can be 'translated' into 74 vases.'28 If this area was occupied continuously for 400 years, it is clear that pottery at Franchthi was very rare. However, if the site was occupied periodically or for only a short period, the amount of pottery available to inhabitants must have been greater. Furthermore, if the inhabitants of Franchthi were given to moving their locus of activity horizontally, it is probable that the material collected from any excavation trench will be representative only of a brief period of the settlement's life. The estimated amount of vessels in use is increased if we take into consideration the ethnographic data on the longevity of vessels. More precise estimates cannot be reached, but on the basis of the above data it could be proposed that the minimum ceramic production, per year, at the settlement of Franchthi may have been greater than it has been originally estimated. Early Neolithic Nea Nikomedeia on the other hand, has the form of a low hill with an estimated total surface area of 24,200oo m2. The settlement consists of closely spaced, square or rectangular post-framed structures built repeatedly in the same area. The average surface area of these structures is 67 mi' in the first and second building periods and 44 m' in the third.29 Construction of buildings required significant investments of time and labour, and to judge from the size and depth of their post-holes, the buildings must have been sturdy and fairly permanent structures.so Furthermore, excavation data indicate that each occupation phase followed the other in swift succession. There is no reason to assume that the occupation of the village was continuous within each building phase, but the size and the organization of the settlement indicate that Nea Nikomedeia was more regularly occupied than Franchthi. Nea Nikomedeia provides the only relatively large-scale excavation of an Early Neolithic village in Greece. The limited excavations of the other Early Neolithic tell-sites indicate that the general layout of Nea Nikomedeia seems not to differ from that of the other contemporary villages.31 27 Thissen (n. 5), 146. 28 The discussion is restricted to the data from Paralia because functional differences in terms of human occupation between the cave and the open settlement could be expected. The horizontally exposed surface area has been estimated from plan 6 in Vitelli 1993a.

Winn and Shimabuku originally studied the ceramic material from Achilleion.33 In 1995 Bj6rk conducted a technological and functional analysis of the Early Neolithic assemblage. Owing to the limited area excavated, she did not proceed to estimate the minimum number of pots from the site. However, the underlying assumption, throughout her work, is that the frequency of pottery was limited: 'Pottery, being a new and relatively rare material, seems to have had a high value at Early Neolithic Achilleion, and the case was apparently the same at the other settlements in Thessaly.'4 TABLE 1 presents the amount of pottery collected from the Early Neolithic phases from Achilleion, together with the total surface area revealed in each phase and the identified architectural features.

Bjark states that a visual examination of the paste, wall thickness, burnishing and colour of the Achilleion ceramic material showed that 'one to four, small/medium (light) sherds could originate from the same vase, while only one larger and thicker (heavy) sherd represented a single vessel'.35 Although she does not comment on that, this picture indicates that the recovered ceramic material presents only a small fraction of the pottery originally 32 Perlis and Vitelli 1999; Perlks 2001; Bailey (n. 3). 33 Winn and Shimabuku 1989. 34 Bjark 1995, 128. 35 Ibid., lo9.</page><page sequence="10">o10 PARASKEVI YIOUNI used at Achilleion. If we try to divide the number of sherds collected from the various occupation phases by four, and take into consideration the duration of occupation, a very large number of vessels could be estimated. This is of course a very crude method which may not provide a reliable estimate of the minimum number of pots from the excavated sectors of the site, since classification of sherds as individual vases was a simple field exercise and does not represent Bjiirk's work or intentions. However, it is worth keeping in mind that her macroscopic study of the material suggests a rather low recovery rate of the ceramics from the excavated parts of Achilleion. It is probable that the number of 2,192 sherds collected from a pit in phase Ia is indicative of a pottery discard pattern rather than of pottery production or use pattern. On the other hand, we have to admit that we lack sound evidence upon which to base the conclusion that pottery at Early Neolithic Achilleion was rare. On the contrary, if we take into consideration the rather low recovery rate and the amount of 2,720 or 5,764 sherds, collected from an area of 20 and 35 m2 respectively where part of houses and food preparation areas were revealed, it could be suggested that the pottery at Early Neolithic Achilleion was not rare.36 Most of the other Thessalian Neolithic sites are known from small, excavation trenches.Y In all cases the Early Neolithic ceramic material does not appear to be, proportionally, sparser than the material from the later occupation phases of these sites. In Macedonia, the excavated sectors of the sites Yiannitsa A, Axos, and Servia V produced great quantities of ceramic material. At Servia V the Early Neolithic ceramic material was 'enormous in quantity, greater in proportion to the earth dug than that from any other period'.38 Similarly, Early Neolithic sites in South Greece, according to the excavation reports, have plenty of sherds.s9 Summing up, it can be concluded that in most of the cases the available data are too poor to be used for the type of quantitative analysis applied to Franchthi and Nea Nikomedeia material. The rare cases, however, where either a larger part of the settlement has been excavated and/or quantitative data exist, do not support the argument that pottery was scarce in the Early Neolithic settlements. 36 It is also worth mentioning here that Theocharis in his trial excavations of the site in 1961 collected a very large number of sherds from the Early Neolithic strata so that, initially, he was under the impression that he was digging a ceramic-producing area.

In fact, the preliminary study indicates that there are no differences in the quantity of pottery from the two occupation phases (EN I to EN II) of this settlement.

For Sesklo, both Theocharis and Wijnen have reported that pottery was very scarce in the level directly overlying the 'Aceramic' stratum. In the subsequent phases of the Early Neolithic, the quantity of ceramics increased.4o For ENI Sesklo, Wijnen estimated a very low ceramic production.41 According to the author, 'contrasting the amount of rim-sherds, retrieved from a deposit covering a certain time- span, with the general size of the vessels, it might even be doubted if an average yearly production of five pots was reached'. The analytical method is very summarily presented and not well documented. It is probable, on the basis of the excavator's qualitative description, that the pottery at ENI Sesklo was rare but as Wijnen herself remarks, a lot of research remains to be done on the estimation of the annual ceramic production for this site. At Early Neolithic Knossos the amount of pottery present in the lower strata (Stratum IX to Stratum VIII) was very limited. After this the quantities found became rapidly much greater.42 Such a picture would agree with the limited use of pottery in the early phases of the Neolithic settlement. However, as the excavator of the site remarks, the pattern of the distribution of sherds, through the various strata, matched that of the rest of the material since the quantities of all find-categories were very markedly falling off below Stratum VI.43 It is very probable, then, that the limited appearance of pottery should be attributed to the nature of the excavated contexts rather than to the limited use of pottery during the early phases of the settlement. A very limited use of ceramics has been suggested, for the 'Aceramic' strata from Argissa, Sesklo, and Franchthi, by questioning the intrusion of sherds found in them.44 Instead, it has been proposed that during this 'Aceramic' phase a few ceramic containers were in fact present, which were rarely used and consequently, rarely broken. It has been proposed then, by Vitelli, that pottery-being a new material-was restricted to a segment of the population and/or used on special occasions.45 Although Bloedow's arguments for 'Aceramic' Argissa are fairly convincing, we cannot come to a definite conclusion about the intrusion of these sherds, since the available data remains problematic. 40 D.

While speaking about the characteristics of the Early Neolithic pottery in the area which stretched from Corinth in the South to Servia and Nea Nikomedeia in the North, she suddenly proposes that 'the quantity of pottery made during the first pottery bearing phase was extremely small; during this period [it] certainly has not been produced on a regular basis'. It is a general statement, which, however, has to be interpreted as referring only to the ENI Sesklo (contrary to Perles 2oo1, 214), for the following reasons. The ENI (monochrome phase) is not represented at Nea Nikomedeia and Servia; in any case the quantity of pottery unearthed from these two sites was certainly not small. The same seems to be true for the sites of Elateia and Corinth, referred to by Wijnen (see above). Furthermore, her main topic of research was the Early Neolithic pottery from Sesklo; at p. 323 she states that she studied only a sample of the pottery from the other sites included in her text. 40 J.

According to Vitelli, the small number and size of the Early Neolithic vessels from Franchthi argue for the limited use of ceramics, which amounts to special- occasion uses. Early pots served probably as containers for special plants such as medicines or poisons, and thus they were perceived as sometimes imbued with magical powers. Ceramic vessels could also be regarded as evidence of wealth.46 Perl~s considers that the Early Neolithic pots remained limited in quantity, were produced with time-consuming techniques and were used infrequently for ceremonies and rituals, or were high-status objects.47 In accordance with the above authors, Bjork suggests that the Early Neolithic pottery from Achilleion was used primarily for symbolic purposes and secondarily for domestic needs. Ceramic, as a material, was highly valuable probably because it was new and not easily accessible. Although around 70% of the material could have been used for short-term storage, it is proposed that vessels were mainly intended for display, cult-related purposes or might have served as symbols for social importance.48 In the following paragraphs, the available data about the function of the Early Neolithic pots from Nea Nikomedeia, Achilleion and Franchthi, are discussed. COOKING VESSELS Vitelli in her pioneering work was the first to challenge the assumption that the primary function of the Early Neolithic ceramic containers was for cooking, because traces related to the use of a vessel over a fire (soot deposit) were absent from the Early Neolithic vessels from Franchthi. Burnishing, present in the great majority of vessels, also suggests that the pots were not intended to be used over a fire, because the high gloss would have been destroyed by repeated contact with fire.49 Wijnen also expresses doubts about the presence of cooking pots at ENI Sesklo because the ceramic material from this site does not show clear traces of use in food preparation activities.5o Negative evidence for the existence of cooking pots emerges from the examination of the Early Neolithic pottery from Achilleion. This conclusion is based on the macroscopic and microscopic study of vessels' clay fabrics, forms, and surface treatment and on the examination of the use-wear traces. Most of the Early Neolithic pots from Achilleion were well burnished and/or slipped, and sooting, cracking due to thermal shock, or traces of food-stains on the fabric are absent.51 Furthermore, although shapes with round profiles were numerous, bases more suitable for this purpose, i.e flat, round, or conical, were very rare.5' Petrographic analysis of the Nea Nikomedeia vessels indicates that, in theory, all clay fabrics used were well suited for the manufacture of cooking vessels, since they contain 46 Vitelli 1989, 26; ead. 1993b, 253. 47 Perls 200oo1, 217. 48 Bjork 1995. 49 Vitelli 1989; ead. 1993a, 214. 50 Wijnen 1993 (n. 40). 51 Bjork 1995, 97-1o02. 52 Ibid., 97. At p. 89, however, Bjork argues that the percentage of round bases may be not accurate because it is often difficult to ascertain whether a round-contoured sherd is part of a round base or a curved portion of the vessel.</page><page sequence="13">COUNTING POTS IN EARLY NEOLITHIC GREECE 13 abundant non-plastic inclusions.53 After macroscopic examination, black patches were noticed in c. 30o% of the beige bases from Nea Nikomedeia. Owing to the fragmentation of the material, it is difficult to decide whether the fireclouds are due to the original firing of the pots, or to their function.54 Black patches were also present in 12% of the red- brown slipped and 7% of the pink coated bases. If we presume that the Nea Nikomedeia potters did not cover the exterior surface of their cooking vessels-which would eventually have turned black-with colouring materials, the black patches on the red and pink pots should be attributed to their original firing. By analogy, at least some of the fireclouds of the beige vessels are attributed to their firing. Beige vessels amount to 27% of the pottery from Nea Nikomedeia. So, even if some of the black patches on the vessels are attributed to their use over a fire, it is clear that the amount of pottery that probably can be connected with cooking is very limited.55 Thus, although the suitability of the Nea Nikomedeia pots for cooking activities cannot be ruled out, we lack the evidence to support such a use. However, we must be aware of the probability that cooking vessels may be not be easily detectable by traditional criteria.56 OTHER VESSEL GROUPS If cooking in ceramic vessels has been excluded as a primary function, Early Neolithic ceramic containers could have been used for food preparation (not involving heating), eating/serving, and transfer or transport. Soaking hides and bark, and other similar activities, should not be excluded. Inferring the functions of vessel assemblages in archaeological contexts is not as straightforward as we may wish. First, because pottery shows a remarkable uniformity in spatial distribution at all Early Neolithic sites, it is not possible to proceed, on the basis of the contextual data, to accurate functional interpretations of the ceramics. At Franchthi most contemporary EN and MN deposits are very similar in ceramic content and include sherds of all contemporary wares. The same is true for Nea Nikomedeia and Achilleion, with the exception, at the later site, of the twelve painted sherds which were found 'concentrated' at two locations.57 53 Almost 72% of the monochrome pots were made from fabrics rich in calcite and limestone inclusions (Fabrics A and C), and the clay of c. 18% of the pottery contains abundant feldspar and volcanic inclusions (Fabric B). Fabric D, used for the manufacture of 3%/ of the vessels is characterized by the presence of schist, greywacke, shale, and quartzite fragments whereas serpentine and quartzite fragments are the major inclusions of fabric E. In all fabrics inclusions amount to 25o/0-3oo/0 of the matrix. For more details see Yiouni 1996a, 71-5. 54 Yiouni 1996c, 190, mentions the presence of one askoid vessel with firing clouds and a lighter area near the base. These features were originally interpreted as indicating exposure of the pot in hot oxidizing flames. Re-examination of the vessel, however, revealed that the pot was, at places, vitrified. Vitrification should most probably be attributed to an accidental refiring of the pot and not to the original firing or to the use of the vessel. Thus it is probable that the dark and light areas on the vessel's surface should also be attributed to the accidental refiring of the pot. 55 The Nea Nikomedeia vessels have rounded profiles and the fireclouds were present mainly on flat bases, so that the use of these vessels for cooking cannot be excluded. From base-sherds it is not possible to infer the exact shape of these pots. 56 For discussion on this subject see Z. Tsirtsoni and P. Yiouni, 'Neolithic cooking vessels from Dikili Tash (Eastern Macedonia, Greece): a technological and functional approach', in V. Kilikoglou, A. Hein and Y. Maniatis (eds), Modern Trends in Scientific Studies on Ancient Ceramics: Papers Presented at the 5th European Meeting on Ancient Ceramics, Athens 1999 (BAR Slolo; Athens, 200oo2), 103-10. 57 For Franchthi see Vitelli 1989, 19; for Achilleion, Bjork 1995, '05-7. At Nea Nikomedeia, all types of pottery decoration are found in similar amounts all over the excavation grid, the only exception being the absence of the W/R pottery from the structures in Group 2.</page><page sequence="14">14 PARASKEVI YIOUNI Trying to identify clear-cut functional groups is perhaps utopian, since pottery throughout its life-cycle may have, simultaneously or sequentially, a variety of uses. Ethnographic examples from Mexico, for example, show that vessels were not specifically identified as storage vessels, but while the vessels themselves were being stored they often held a variety of foods, dry goods and other supplies.58 In other cases when a vessel loses its effectiveness for its original function it may be switched to some other use.59 I. Nea Nikomedeia The ceramic assemblage from Nea Nikomedeia includes a variety of forms ranging from neck-jars and hole-mouthed jars to open, plate-like pots. In terms of size there is a continuous range from the miniature vessels to the large neck-jars reaching up to 60 cm in height. If we take the rim-diameter as an estimator of the size, the majority is of medium size since the most common group of diameters range from 10-24 cm (see TABLE 2). Larger ceramic containers, offering greater storing capacity, are also regularly present.6o Estimates of the storage capacity of the Nea Nikomedeia vessels indicate that the available pots were enough for the storage of seeds kept for sowing, but not for the storage of the annual crop production.6' It appears, then, that the inhabitants of Nea Nikomedeia were also using containers made from perishable materials. A comparable attitude on Early Neolithic artisans' part towards the raw material categories has been noted by Perlks, in relation to tools: 'On the one hand, not all stones are equal, and stones were not randomly selected for specific tasks. On the other hand, if shells or bones presented comparable functional properties, the prehistoric artisan did not hesitate to use either stone, bone, or shell for a given task.'6' Around 45% of the vessels from Nea Nikomedeia belong to closed forms. Such vessels could have been used for storing. Of course, since pots range in height from 8 cm to 60 cm, a variation both in the amount and the products stored in them should be expected (see FIG. 2). Furthermore, since their orifices are not very narrow, some of these pots TABLE 2. Relative frequency of vessel forms from Nea Nikomedeia and the range of their rim-diameters.

Examples of monochrome vessels from Nea Nikomedeia.</page><page sequence="16">16 PARASKEVI YIOUNI could also have been used in processing raw materials. Such a use could be proposed for the closed, beige, coarse-textured vessel found in excavation square A8/1 (PLATE 1). Its rim-diameter is 23 cm and its height 25 cm. The interior walls are marked by a number of lines suggesting an intense circular movement with an instrument (stone, bone, or wood). Use-traces are concentrated in the upper part of the vessel, since the base and the lower part of the walls are free from use-traces. Another, red, unslipped vessel found in square BA/2/X was used differently, in this case it is in the lower part of the interior walls and bottom that they are cut by deep lines. The vessel is made from fine/medium-textured fabric and its surface is well smoothed and lightly burnished. Many bases from closed or open vessels from Nea Nikomedeia are worn on the interior and/or exterior surface. The use traces on the interior surfaces are not so clear as to be connected with specific jobs. The wear on the exterior surface of bases, where the vessels were standing, clearly indicate that, during their use, vessels were rubbed against hard, working surfaces (PLATE 2). Furthermore, both interior and exterior wear indicate that the Nea Nikomedeia vessels were regularly in use. Open vessels have an unrestricted orifice so that either the hands or a utensil can be used for mixing or stirring their contents (FIG. 2). Moreover, the open orifice allows the contents to be viewed, which might be important in vessels used for serving. Thus the open pots from Nea Nikomedeia could have been used for various purposes: short-term storing of small quantities, food-processing or manipulation of other raw materials, transferring of materials and perhaps serving. Vessels for serving food are likely to vary greatly in size, depending on the type of food and the number of people partaking and the social or cultural attitudes towards consumption. 2. Achilleion Winn and Shimabuku have classified the ceramic assemblage from Achilleion into neck- jars, closed, and open pots and plates. As can be seen in TABLE 3, throughout the occupation of the settlement (EN-MN) open pots are predominant. In Early Neolithic their amount ranges from 88% in phase Ia to 54% in phase IIa. As for the size of vessels, the Early Neolithic assemblage from Achilleion is characterized by the abundance of medium-sized vessels (rim-diameters ranging from 16 to 25 cm). Compared with the Middle Neolithic assemblage from the same site, Early Neolithic pots are remarkably greater in size."% Bjork, examining the size and storage capacity of Achilleion pots, estimates that containers of a relatively suitable size for storing (5-50 1) constituted c. 72% of the Early Neolithic ceramic assemblage.64 Grains, pulses, fruits, plants, and liquid, and semi-liquid substances such as fat, honey, or alcoholic beverages were the commodities most probably stored in these vessels, mainly for a short period.65 The interior face of many sherds is marked by very light scratches, indicating the use of vessels for very light activities, or contact with soft materials."66 Thus grinding or mixing of ingredients in food preparation, or other activities, seems less likely. Moreover, apart from storing, the vessels could have been used for soaking, serving, or transferring/transporting materials. 63 See table B.11 in Winn and Shimabuku 1989. 64 Bjork 1995, 115. 65 Lipids and proteins are identified by chemical analysis of organic remains from three sherds from Achilleion.

Accordingly, she suggests that the small vessels from Achilleion were used for display, in social or in cult-related activities."68 3. Franchthi The vessels from Franchthi fall in terms of size between cups and very large pots, covering the whole range between the two.69 The most commonly occurring forms are cups, bowls and jars (TABLE 4). Vitelli characterizes the Early Neolithic vessels from Franchthi as small. Comparison of the range of vessels' rim-diameters from Nea Nikomedeia, Achilleion, and Franchthi suggests that the pots from the three settlements were more or less comparable in size. A number of rim-sherds with a maximum diameter in excess of 35-40 cm have been found at Franchthi. Such vessels could offer a considerable storing capacity. Their use however, as storing vessels is questioned by Vitelli owing to difficulties in identifying TABLE 4. Occurrence of vessel forms from Franchthi. Vessel form Frequency Range of rim-diameters (cm) Neck-jars Very rare 9-15 Jars and bowls Common 16-32 (the most common group from 17-28) Cups Common 10o-12 Small, shallow open bowls Limited and ambiguous 8-30.5 Very large vessels A number of rim sherds 35-40 Based on Vitelli 1993a 67 In contrast to Winn and Shimabuku, who used rim- diameter as an estimator of the vessel's size, Bjork followed Nordstrom's system of estimating vessels' size: Bjork 1995, 95-6. 68 Ibid., 128. 69 Bowls have openings that approximate the maximum diameter, jars have narrow, restricted openings and cups are open, small-sized vessels.

Instead, it is proposed that these open-ended vessels could have been used as portable kilns for pot-firing.7o However, no firing clouds or fire-blackened spots, which could correlate this vessel form with its proposed function as a moveable bottomless oven-chimney, are referred to. Vitelli, in analogy with the functional interpretation of the Middle Neolithic ceramics from Franchthi, suggests that the Early Neolithic vessels from the site were mainly related to ceremonial needs: 'The small numbers and sizes of FCP 1 vessels argue for the limited use of ceramics, which amounts to special-occasion use'.7' The variability in ceramic production, both in wares and in forms, would be explained by their being made for ceremonial uses: different ceremonies called for pots made from different ingredients, with different surface appearance, perhaps even specific makers.Wo Thus pots may have served as containers for special plants such as medicines or poisons. The rare sherds with carbon soot centred on the interior are considered as the functional predecessors of Middle Neolithic saucers and basins that, according to Vitelli, were used for incense-burning. Vessels could also have been used as musical instruments (i.e. drums). DIscussIoN One argument against the daily, domestic use of Early Neolithic pottery is the good craftsmanship and the high quality of the Early Neolithic pots. Indeed, vessels were carefully built and the evidence of the primary forming techniques were obliterated by subsequent, often time-consuming, processes such as scraping, smoothing and burnishing.73 Furthermore, a large percentage of pots are covered with an external surface layer. At Achilleion, the proportion of slipped vessels range from 14% to 28%/, whereas at Nea Nikomedeia 73% of the ceramic material is covered with a surface coating.74 Being meticulous in the work, maintaining the good quality of products, and taking pride in the production of beautifully made objects does not necessarily imply the production of exclusively special-purpose objects. This is clear from the ethnographic record. For example in the Maghreb, in North Africa, the housewife herself annually replenishes her stock of domestic utensils. According to Balfet, 'all of her attention, all her available technical awareness, is mobilized in this effort to reconstitute the chain of traditional steps, the single, brief use of which, once a year, ensures their perpetuation and transmission from one generation to another.'75 In this case, utilitarian pottery testifies to the potter's skill in providing well-functioning utensils and adornment for her house. It is also worth noticing that although infrequent, the principal purpose of potting was the production of everyday, utilitarian pottery. The craftsmanship of the Early Neolithic chipped stone tools is also usually of very good quality. Chipped stone tools, however, are not considered as status-objects. Instead, it is proposed that the sophisticated methods of production were aiming at the fulfilment 70 Vitelli 1993a, 99, 184-5. 7' Ibid., 216. 71 At any given time within the Earlier Neolithic, the potters were making from 3-5 different wares. The lime- gritted ware dominates every deposit, accounting for as much as 80-90% of the total: Vitelli 1989, 19. 73 Perlks 200ool, 217-18; Bjark 1995, 135. 74 For Achilleion see Bjork 1995, table IV.6, for Franchthi see Vitelli 1993, 96-7, and for Nea Nikomedeia Yiouni 1996b, 84 and fig. 5. 1. 75 H.

Matson (ed.), Ceramics and Man (Chicago, 1965), 161-77.</page><page sequence="19">COUNTING POTS IN EARLY NEOLITHIC GREECE 19 of special functional requirements and the optimal exploitation of raw materials.76 Similarly, the high frequency of Early Neolithic vessels with a good gloss and/or a surface colouring layer could be attributed not only to symbolic and aesthetic but to functional causes as well. Thus, on the one hand the use of a red or pink-coloured slip may produce an attractive result, or have a specific meaning for the users of pots.77 On the other hand, both burnishing and slipping can affect the vessel's hardness and longevity. The application of an external layer could also contribute to the reduction of the vessel's porosity or permeability.78 The practice of reusing pottery is also considered as an indication of the implied symbolic value of the early ceramics. Thus Bjork suggests that the social function of ceramics is confirmed by the practice of reusing broken body-sherds as pendants (clay roundels with a central hole) and possibly also of broken bases as 'serving plates' for the display of fruits, seeds, etc.79 Reuse of broken pottery is widely attested ethnographically. The fragmented material can be used for a variety of purposes such as receptacles for dry or liquid commodities, animal feeders, water troughs, hide scrapers, etc.8so The underlying idea is that, as long as a material can be useful for any purpose, it is not discarded. After taking into consideration the recovery rate of the ceramic material from Nea Nikomedeia and the available ethnographic data on the longevity of vessels, it has been estimated that at each house of the main excavation grid of the Early Neolithic settlement 13-45 vessels were in use simultaneously. It seems also that the pottery recovery rate at Achilleion was rather low. Consequently, the number of sherds found in the excavated parts of the settlement does not seem to support the suggestion that pottery was rare. For the site of Franchthi precise estimates cannot be reached, but as has been discussed above, the annual ceramic production at the open air settlement of Franchthi (Paralia) may have been greater than was originally estimated. It may be worth comparing the estimated number of vessels from Nea Nikomedeia with the quantity of vessels used by traditional communities. The data from ceramic censuses concerning a number of cases, recording the amount of vessels per household, are presented in Rice 1987.81 In most communities, the average number of pots per household ranges from to to 20o. In a few cases, it was greater, reaching up to 85. Apart from clay vessels, plastic and metal containers were also in use. If we consider, however, that during the Neolithic period some of the containers may have been from perishable materials (wood, basketry, or leather), it could be suggested that the relative numbers of clay pots to other containers may not be very severely distorted.82 As has been suggested in the previous section, the inhabitants of Nea Nikomedeia, apart from ceramic vessels, were also using containers made from perishable materials. During the Early Neolithic period in Greece, cooking vessels were most probably absent, or extremely limited in use. Ethnographic ceramic censuses indicate that cooking vessels usually are the most often occurring functional category of household vessel assemblages. 76 Perlas 2ool, 2oo-lo. 77 D.

Morphological features (form and size) indicate that Early Neolithic pots from Nea Nikomedeia could have been used for a variety of purposes such as storing of varying quantities of dry, liquid or semi-liquid substances, food preparation activities, transferring, transport, or serving. Since the contextual data are not informative about the function of vessels, these interpretations are based on common sense and comparisons with ethnographic data. In some cases, functional interpretations are supported by the examination of pottery use-traces (see previous section). Residue analysis and more detailed use-wear studies could help to proceed to more accurate determinations. Nonetheless, the multi-functional character of pottery should always be considered. At Achilleion, 72%/0 of the material could have been used for storing and/or for light activities such as soaking, serving, or transferring/transporting of materials. Around 3o/0 of the vessels are small sized. These are considered, by Bjork, as pots used for display, in social or in cult-related activities, including drinking in cultic contexts. Although the excavations at Achilleion have not revealed any spatial patterning in relation to these pots, the presence of containers for special members (defined by gender, age, affiliation, etc.) of each household or the use of clay vessels in cult-related activities performed at the house, cannot be excluded. On the other hand, since pottery was most probably not rare at Achilleion, these small vessels could have been used for serving in combination with larger containers, for short-term storing, transporting or transferring of small quantities. The Early Neolithic pottery at Franchthi was produced according to Vitelli by 'ritual healers' who used it 'mainly in occasional rituals for the resolution of conflicts among their immediate neighbors'.84 This is in complete contrast with what has been proposed for the ceramic production and use at Nea Nikomedeia. Based on the homogeneous spatial distribution of all wares and vessel forms, the identification of the raw materials as local, and the estimated amount of ceramics, it is proposed that at Nea Nikomedeia pots- produced perhaps at the household level-were an important element of the everyday activities of the inhabitants of the site. In contrast, the model put forward for Franchthi limits the production and use of the rare pots to an 'elite' segment of the population. Are we to suppose that the ceramic production and use was organized differently at Nea Nikomedeia and Franchthi? Perhaps we are not justified in assuming a priori that pottery played the same role in every community, especially during the early period of its adoption. Since the shapes and uses of the vessels are culturally prescribed, it may be assumed that the ceramic production was affected by the social or economic organization, and the prevailing ideologies, of each community. Nea Nikomedeia and Franchthi present two different settlement-types showing differences in the labour and time invested to built their living environment, in the stability of occupation and in the organization of space. Apart from defining differences in the permanency of occupation or the economic organization of each site, it is probable that these features are material manifestations of 83 Ibid., 295. Estimates for cooking vessels range from 260/o to 87%/o of the ceramic assemblages. 84 Vitelli 1993a, 253, cf. Perlas and Vitelli 1999, lo04.</page><page sequence="21">COUNTING POTS IN EARLY NEOLITHIC GREECE 21 different ideologies about hoarding or sharing and/or reflect differences in the social organization of each community. In turn, they could also affect the role of pottery in each community. The shape of the vessels indicate that the inhabitants of Nea Nikomedeia were using a greater variety of clay pots than the inhabitants of Franchthi: evidence for plates at Franchthi is very limited and ambiguous and neck jars are extremely rare, being present only among the painted, Lime Patterned ware, which accounts for less than 2% of the pottery in FPC1 units.85 The almost exclusive presence of neck jars in the Lime Patterned variety may suggest a specialized function of this vessel form.86 At Nea Nikomedeia neck jars and plates, although not plentiful, are better represented amounting to 9% and 6% of the ceramic assemblage respectively.87 Perhaps we may recognize in these trends a differentiation in the use and meaning of pottery from Nea Nikomedeia and Franchthi, but this does not necessarily imply a strict differentiation between settlements with 'utilitarian' and 'non-utilitarian' ceramic assemblages. As has been argued above, the minimum annual ceramic production at Franchthi may have been greater than it has been originally estimated. If we accept a larger number of pots at Franchthi, the issue of pottery production and use at this site remains open. It is not within the scope of the present essay to deny the symbolic or ritual use of ceramics in the Early Neolithic strata. Decorated pottery is one class of ceramics that could be connected with such activities. Although not spatially restricted, painted pots are present always in very small amounts.88 Vessels with anthropomorphic or zoomorphic representations are even less abundant. The rarity of decorated vessels, the excellent quality of craftsmanship of some of them (i.e. 'porcelain ware' from Nea Nikomedeia) or the technical difficulties in manufacturing them (i.e. the larger 'face vessels' from Nea Nikomedeia), the additional time and skills required in order to produce their decoration, and the messages conveyed by this decoration, all suggest a special-occasion use for these vessels. Indications of the special character of certain classes of monochrome, undecorated, pottery are also offered by the archaeological record. We can mention here the Early Neolithic cemetery at Soufli Magoula in Thessaly, where the twelve cremation burials, apart from burnt human bones and fragments of carbon, contained sherds, a few stone tools, fragments from two figurines, one stone ear-stud, and a stone rubber.89 In all, 17 vases were restored, 6 of which are badly made miniature pots.9O Clay pots could have been deposited either as containers of foods', and/or as burial offerings per se. It is also 85 Technologically, the vessels are not of inferior quality. Instead, pots were very carefully manufactured. 86 Vitelli 1993a, 101. 87 Since most of the neck jars from Nea Nikomedeia were slipped, it seems that the vases were not used for storing or carrying water. Liquid and semi-liquid substances such as fat, honey, or alcoholic beverages are the commodities that most probably were stored in these vessels. 88 At Nea Nikomedeia decorated pottery amounts to 4%/0 of the ceramic material. The great majority of them bear painted patterns (88%/ of the decorated vessels). At Achilleion the ceramic sample of 12,528 sherds included 12 painted body sherds. At Franchthi, decorated pots amount to c. 40/0 of the ceramic assemblage. 89 K. Gallis, Ka6aotg Nexeoiv ano6 nr Neo.tOzxoi Exrozp orl Oecaaaoa (Athens, 1982). According to Chourmouziadis (n. 37), sherds and flint blades are also accompanying the secondary burials at Prodromos, in Thessaly. 90 Of the remaining vessels, eight are small-sized with slightly closed walls, carefully made and burnished (one of them perhaps was painted). Two of the larger vessels have also slightly closed walls although one of them is ovaloid; the third is a 'fruitstand'. 91 In Gallis (n. 89), 58, animal bones are reported from cremation no. 14.</page><page sequence="22">22 PARASKEVI YIOUNI probable that pots were playing an active role in the funeral ceremonies: one vessel at least has been interpreted by the excavator as having been purposely broken in the cremation burial, and the miniature vessels present in almost every undisturbed cremation give the impression of having been fired in the flames of the funeral pyre.92 The connection of badly made miniature vessels with funerary rituals is of particular importance since it warns against the generalizing association of ceremonies with carefully or elaborately made objects. Miniature vessels (up to 5-6 cm in height) are also present in Early Neolithic settlements (Nea Nikomedeia, Achilleion, Franchthi). Some of the miniature vessels from Nea Nikomedeia are well made, but many are carelessly manufactured. Made by pinching, sometimes they are left un-scraped so that their surfaces are marked with adjacent grooves. In other cases, the scraping marks are clearly visible on the interior walls. As might be expected, vessels are not symmetrical in shape and have thick walls (PLATE 3). The careless appearance of these vessels is in complete contrast with the appearance of the larger pots from Nea Nikomedeia, which are carefully manufactured. It seems, then, that either the badly manufactured miniature vessels were made by people who had not mastered the process of making pots, or their bad manufacture (and small size) was considered a necessary attribute for their intended function. Although the data from a burial context cannot be equated with the data from the habitation units, the special characteristics and the small numbers of the miniature vessels may indicate a ritual function. Alternatively, these vessels could be interpreted as the first attempts of children at pot making. Taking the argument further, it could be proposed that the miniatures that survived firing were subsequently used as toys. We lack the evidence to support either of these two hypotheses. Yet it may safely be concluded that the inhabitants of Nea Nikomedeia had a different attitude towards the miniature and the larger vessels. In summary, our review of the available quantitative, technological, typological, functional and contextual data from the Early Neolithic sites in Greece suggests that pottery, varying in size and shape, was most probably a regular component of material culture and had, even at this early period, a variety of functions. As we have seen, there are indications that pots were used in ceremonies and in mortuary activities. It is very probable that some vessels were high-status objects. Furthermore, as has been argued in this essay, pots-in combination with other containers made from perishable materials-had an active role in daily life with regard to the storage and transportation of supplies, as well as the preparation (most probably excluding cooking) of food and the manipulation of other raw materials. Variations in the use and meaning of pottery may be expected, from site to site, since pottery-like all the components of material culture-could have been affected by the social and economic organization of each community. So far, the documented differences between the ceramic assemblages from Nea Nikomedeia, a more 'typical' Early Neolithic settlement, and Franchthi do not unquestionably imply a clear-cut differentiation between settlements with 'utilitarian' and 'non-utilitarian' ceramic assemblages.
