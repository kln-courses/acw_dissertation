<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Worship of South Indian Deities in Martinique1 Michael M. Horowitz Harpur College The study of overseas colonies of established cultures has long been of interest to social science. Its increasing prominence is due in part to the difficulty in dealing directly with the mother country, as in con? temporary China (e.g., Fried 1958), and in part to the interest in cultural persistence and change. Recent studies of overseas East Indians have importantly demonstrated some of the processes in? volved and have shown the varying degrees to which a culture can be maintained where its members form a numerical and/or social minor? ity (see Benedict 1961; Firth et al. 1957: 291-294, 306-342; Jayawar- dena 1962: 43-64; Mayer 1961; Niehoff and Niehoff 1960; Pocock 1957: 289-300). Klass (1961: 231), writing of a village in Trinidad settled by East Indians, notes: "The settlers in Amity succeeded in recon- stituting a new community. It exhibited the structure of what might be called the generalized north Indian society" in that it included hierarchical caste organization, village exogamy, virilocal residence, an "Indian" kinship system with emphasis on the patrilineal joint family, Hinduism, and an Indian rather than Creole life cycle. Arensberg, in his introduction to the study by Klass (1961: xvi), writes: "Reconstitution has been possible . . . through making good an escape from wage labor and economic assimilation to partial self- subsistence, to land-ownership, village residence, and through re- establishing in temple and rite, without great communication back to India, some touch with the mother civilization and its religious lore." In Martinique, more than 25,000 East Indians were recruited as indentured laborers to replace those emancipated slaves who in 1848 abandoned the sugar plantations to establish small peasant farms in the hills (Renard 1955: 64). In contrast to Trinidad, these In? dians have for the most part been unable to escape from an economic dependence upon the estates. A preliminary examination of their social organization indicates its strong "Creolization," i.e., the Eskimoan kinship system, the nuclear and frequently matrifocai household, the nonexistence of caste, and the general absence of corporate village functions characteristic of the plantation Carib- bean (see Wagley 1957: 8; Horowitz 1960). 339</page><page sequence="2">340 ETHNOLOGY Yet the Martinique East Indians have maintained a complex and vigorous religion which thrives despite the active discouragement of the Roman Catholic Church to which they also belong. Since the East Indians have been in contact with the Catholic Church from the moment of their arrival in the island, it would be surprising indeed if no elements of the Church had found their way into the Indian re? ligious system. We were initially quite impressed with such examples as the identification of Indian deities with the Christian celestial hierarchy and the use of the sign of the cross. The cult seemed to be an instance of the syncretism which has been demonstrated for the Creole folk religions of Haiti, Cuba, Trinidad, Brazil, etc. (see Herskovits 1947: 321-339; Simpson 1945, 1962; Bascom 1950; Pierson 1942: 275-317). Further examination, however, revealed the essentially Hindu nature of the ritual. In an earlier description of the cult (Horowitz and Klass 1961: 94-100) it was made clear that the ceremonies are derived from the propitiation of village deities {grama-devata) in South India through shamanistic possession and animal sacrifice. Harper (1959: 227-228) reports the classification of supernaturals recognized in at least one South Indian region: In terms of ritual purity, vegetarian gods, devarus, are at the top of the hierarchy. These are followed by meat-eating deities, devates, with a dualistic character of benevo- lence and malevolence. At the bottom are blood-demanding spirits, devvas, with whom one should not have contact. . . . These categories can be renamed as Sanskritic gods, local or secondary deities, and malevolent spirits. . . . Within this scheme the deities worshipped in Martinique fall into the middle or devate class. The absence of Sanskritic gods is probably related to the overwhelmingly Sudra and untouchable origin of Martinique East Indians, who were denied entree to the worship of Brahma, Vishnu, etc, in the Madrassi villages from which they came. Except for one claimed Brahmin, informants identified their parents as Pariah, Patachi, Tulkechi, and Pandaron. Speaking of vegetarian deities in a South Indian village, Beals (1962: 35) writes: "Direct access to these gods is restricted to members of vegetarian castes who are sufficiently pure to handle sacred images without danger to themselves." Although each of the seven temples in Martinique may contain as many as twenty images of the deities, only three, the ones invoked during the temple ceremonies, are found universally. These are Marie-aim^e, Maldevidan, and Munadian. (A fourth deity, Naga- rumida, is propitiated with a special sacrifice at home.) Marie- aimee is a variant of Mariamma, perhaps the most prominent of the South Indian devates, especially associated with disease (Whitehead 1916: 24, 26-27; O'Malley 1935: 143). In Martinique she is always painted yellow and is often multi-handed. Maldevidan, an eques- trian figure, usually with sword in hand, is probably derived from Madurai-Viran, who is reported to be an attendant deity in Tamil villages, the one to whom the sacrifices are often directed (Whitehead 1916: 94, 98, 101). In Martinique the sacrifices are performed out-</page><page sequence="3">SOUTH INDIAN DEITIES IN MARTINIQUE 341 side the temple, where they are directed to Munadian, who is repre? sented by a simple stone, usually unpainted, and occasionally with no anthropomorphic depiction at all. In the Tamil-speaking region of India Munadian is reported to be an attendant deity, serving the higher gods (Whitehead 1916: 97-98). Each temple contains a number of other deities, generally re? ferred to by the Creole words zange and bon di, "religious statue.'' Among these are Katarai, Tanonmadiri, Katan, Amigani, Kali, Mariai, Virai, Shukarrama, Bouminaman, Sida Laitchini, Kariai, Samaki, and Anibal.2 It is difficult to get any consensus as to their names and attributes. Harper (1959: 234) notes that this is also characteristic of his Indian village, where "informants frequently differ in their opinions as to what or who a particular supernatural is," and he explains this in part as a consequence of great differences in "sophistication and knowledge of philosophical Hinduism." Six of the Martinique temples are on lands donated by the estate owners to their Indian laborers. Each temple has a sexton who is charged writh keeping it clean and seeing that the oil lamps are filled and burning. In an earlier report (Horowitz and Klass 1961: 96-98) we de? scribed the sequence of ritual activities involved in the propitiation of Maldevidan. In this paper I shall relate these activities, where possible, to their Indian antecedents. The ceremony begins with a procession bringing offerings which are displayed on a banana leaf before the image of Munadian. These invariably include: kandyi, a mixture of rice, coconut, onion, and salt; dry coconuts, split in half with a machete; green coconuts, with an opening at the top; flowers; bread; lighted cigarettes; lighted candles; soda; Madeira wine; rum; and partially peeled bananas. The image and the trident before it, with a lime stuck on each tine, are garlanded. Whitehead (1916: 74), Bishop of Madras around 1900, reports a Canarese ceremony in which "Four measures of boiled rice are then poured in a heap before the image, while flowers, betel leaves, nuts, plantains, and coconuts are offered, and camphor and incense burnt." He also notes (1916: 143) that cheroots are offered "to the coarser male attendants, like Madurai-Viran . . . because it is assumed that these gifts will rejoice their hearts and propitiate them." The priest (Vabbe coolie) presents burning incense first to the image and then to the congregation. This he follows by slicing a lime in four, tossing a section in each direction, and then asperging the congrega? tion with saffron-colored water. These actions are explained as chasing out "demons" which lurk about the temple, thus rendering the area ritually pure. From Whitehead (1916: 47, 51, 63) we learn of several instances in India in which limes are thrown in the air to drive away or to distract evil spirits. While the altar is being prepared and the initial offerings made, a procession of drummers and singers led by a young boy walks slowly through the nearby village, inviting people to attend the ceremony and asking for financial contributions. Each donor is</page><page sequence="4">342 ETHNOLOGY blessed by the boy, who rubs a mixture of incense and ashes on the forehead. Nalli Krishnan of Metturdam, Madras, notes that this procession is identical to that in his own village, except that food may be contributed in lieu of money. Whitehead (1916: 46) similarly reports a collection made to provide for the expenses of the ceremony in a Telegu village. The procession returns to the temple yard, where the boy presents the bowl to the priest, who prepares for possession by prayer and lying prostrate before the stone image of Munadian. This is followed by further asperging, presentation of incense, and slicing a coconut held in the hand with a single blow of the machete. Whitehead (1916: 53) says that in the village of Gudivada the pujari (officiant) offers incense and breaks a coconut to the deity Pallalamma. During this period the drummers play, stopping only to tighten the skins over a fire. The drums cease when the priest, wearing a ceremonial apron and with small bells tied to his ankles, attempts to communicate with Maldevidan by means of a small hand drum. He then emerges from the temple, ecstatically dancing in the open courtyard, beating his chest with the flat sides of two machetes, "grunting, shrieking, over-breathing, hopping shoeless [first] on one foot, and then the other. As he dances two assistants face each other in the yard . . . holding [the] freshly sharpened machete[s] . . . hori? zontally, sharp-side upward, about three feet off the ground" (Horo- witz and Klass 1961: 96). The priest mounts the blades, the sign that his body is now possessed by Maldevidan. This is the ritual climax to which the preliminary activity has been devoted; the deity is present in the body of the priest, who speaks with the voice of the god. The proof of the deity's presence is that the feet are unmarked. This is almost identical to the instance of shamanistic possession reported by Harper (1957: 269) from the Malnad of Mysore in the words of an informant: Ramappa is carried while standing on two swords' blades resting on the shoulders of two men. This is done because when the deity comes to him it says, "Now I have come. To show my presence I want to stand on the swords, so that no one will dis- believe me." Harper (1957: 272) further reports: Next, one of Ramappa's assistants came out in the veranda of the temple and attached three semicircular blades to three pairs of chains from the roof beams. . . . Ramappa came abruptly out of the temple, jumped into the middle of the three blades and then stretched out on all three, swinging back and forth for several minutes. Informants pointed out that this offered proof that the deity was possessing Ramappa, as any person not protected by a deity would be badly cut. While he is possessed by the deity, the priest's words are not intel- ligible to the congregation and are interpreted by a ritual assistant. The priest descends from the blades, the drums resume, and he hops about exhibiting his uncut feet. He remounts the blades three to five times. His final descent is sometimes followed by fire-eating, but often he simply is supported by assistants and given something to drink from a coconut.</page><page sequence="5">SOUTH INDIAN DEITIES IN MARTINIQUE 343 A second collection is taken, its placement somewhat variable; it may be held before or after possession or following the sacrifice. Usually the priest does it himself, blessing the donor with incense on the forehead, but if he is too fatigued following the possession it may be done for him. The priest prepares the sheep and cock for sacrifice by dousing them with saffron water and placing incense before them. White? head (1916: 46-47) mentions numerous instances of such ritual purification in South India. For example, "When the appointed day arrives, the buffalo is sprinkled all over with yellow turmeric, while garlands of margosa leaves are hung round its neck and tied to its horns." Also (Whitehead 1916: 95): "Camphor is burnt between the animal and the Viran." In Martinique the priest does not actually perform the sacrifice, and the immolator has had no prior role in the rites, although he is expected to follow the same purifying regimen as the other officiants. The animals are permitted to graze freely, while the garlanded im? molator watches carefully, for he is expected to decapitate the animal with a single blow of the machete (one of those on which the priest stood while possessed). A successful decapitation is considered to have been acceptable to the gods. The heads of the victims are placed at the altar before the image of Munadian, with the foreleg crosswise in the mouth of the sheep. This may be compared with the description of a Tamil rite from the Tanjore district (Whitehead 1916: 98; see also O'Malley 1935: 144): On the tenth day of the festival, in the evening, animal sacrifices are offered, consisting of fowls and sheep, to Madurai-Viran and Munadian. People who have made vows, in times of sickness or distress, or in order to secure some boon, bring their victims to the shrine. Water and turmeric are poured on the whole body of the animal, and some mantrams are recited by the pujari. If the animal is a sheep or a goat, it is then seized by the offerer and his friends, some of whom catch hold of its hind legs, while others hold fast to a rope fastened round its neck, and its head is cut off with one stroke of the chopper by one of the pujaris. The head is placed in front of the image of Madurai- Viran with its right foreleg in its mouth. The second part of the rituals occurs at the home of the sponsor of the temple ceremony and is devoted to the deity Nagarumida. A procession of drummers and porters, led by the priest, walks from the temple to the home, often a considerable distance. There a meal, to which all who attended the temple rites are invited, is pre? pared with the meat of the sacrificed animals. Near the house a small altar is made at the base of a tree, in? volving the same kinds of material presented to Munadian: candles, bananas, rum, incense, etc. A small coin offering (20 fr.) is buried beneath the altar, and a flag is attached to the end of a long bamboo pole. This time the priest performs the sacrifice, sawing rather than chopping the head off. As this is done, several men climb the tree and fasten the pole such that the flag can be seen from a great dis? tance. Throughout these rites the drums play constantly.</page><page sequence="6">344 ETHNOLOGY The Nagarumida ceremonies are followed by feasting on lamb and chicken curry with rice. The meal is defined as the charity part of the sacrifice (cf. Beals 1962: 54-57). The evening is spent in secular singing and male dancing to the accompaniment of drums and finger cymbals. Occasionally special dances are held at night, in which the dancers are masked and costumed. We have noted throughout the ceremony the theme of ritual prophylaxis. Since this is so strikingly a feature of Indian religious activity, it is useful to summarize here its Martiniquan occurrence. 1. Dietary and sexual regimen. The direct participants in the cere? monies?the priest {Fabbe coolie), his assistant {le pretre), immolator, host, flag maker?and the members of their households are expected to be sexually continent for the week preceding the ceremony and to follow a special vegetarian and nonalcoholic diet. Harper (personal communication) says that nonvegetarian castes in India may tem- porarily avoid meat and alcohol at certain ceremonial occasions. Similar avoidance is reported from Fiji, where Mayer (1961: 93) quotes an informant saying: "So a week before the rite I stopped eat? ing fish and meat, and slept apart from my wife. In this way I became clean." Possibly related to this is the avoidance of leather around the temple, i.e., wearing a rope belt. Further, each temple has a large sign asking that shoes be removed ("Enlevez Vos Chaus- sures Avant d'Entrer dans la Chapelle"). 2. Purifying materials. Limes, incense, and saffron water are used singly and in concert to render pure the elements of the rites, including the courtyard, the machetes on which the priest stands, the sacri- ficial animals, and the congregation itself. Incense mixed with ashes is applied as a blessing to a contributor. The use of yellow coloring is extended, as we have seen, to the images of the deities. 3. Prayer. While any one can direct prayer to the deities, this is especially a feature of the priest's behavior before possession. He is supposed to be particularly vulnerable to impurity, which if present may cause him harm. In fact he is reported to have cut himself on the machetes in 1962, and this was explained as a consequence of im? purity ("II n'?tait pas sain"). Finally one can see the general emphasis on purification in the sextons' concern for the cleanliness of the temples in their charge. Horowitz and Klass (1961: 98-100) have earlier discussed the twofold syncretism which has occurred in Martinique: first, a fusion of ritual elements from the many villages of South India which sent their people overseas; second, a partial reliance on Christian theology derived from contact with the Roman Catholic Church. The ap? parent ease with which many East Indians accept this may well be related to the fact that Sanskritic Hinduism itself was largely an alien or at least an external element in the Indian village. White? head (1916: 17) has remarked on the relative absence of High Tradi? tion in the cults: [Siva and Vishnu] and the system of religion connected with them are the outcome of philosophic reflection on the universe as a whole. But the village deities . . . have no</page><page sequence="7">SOUTH INDIAN DEITIES IN MARTINIQUE 345 relation to the universe. They symbolize only the facts of village life. They are related, not to great world forces, but to such simple facts as cholera, small-pox, and cattle disease. The replacement of Hindu by Catholic theology demonstrates the ability of the ritual practices to articulate with quite different meta- physical systems. The cult serves to reinforce a feeling of community among the East Indians. In addition to involvement in ceremony different from that of the Creole majority, the very movement of persons, assembling now at this temple, now at that, feasting and dancing at homes scattered throughout the northern sugar lowlands, creates a network of relations far beyond the immediate village. In this sense, Mar- tiniquan East Indians have developed a structural alternative to the circle of exogamous villages which, as Arensberg (1961: 255) notes, is characteristic of community in India. I have shown in Martinique a continuity of religious activity with that of India, a persistence existing despite severe discontinuities in economic, educational, political, and social life?and a persistence which is still the focus of interest to the bulk of Martinique East Indians. NOTES 1. A version of this paper was read at the 1962 meetings of the American Anthro? pological Association in Chicago, Illinois. Field research in Martinique was carried out in 1956, 1957-1958, and 1962. The author gratefully acknowledges financial aid received from the Social Science Research Council, the Department of Anthropology, Columbia University, and the Research Foundation of State University of New York. Special thanks are due to Edward B. Harper, who generously commented on the paper in manuscript; to Nalli Krishnan, who shared with the author his intimate familiarity with Madrassi villages; and to Jacques Robert Senet, for his many kindnesses in the field. 2. An incipient syncretism is occurring in the identification of these deities with Christian figures, but there is by no means consensus. For example, different informants equated Maldevidan with Christ, St. Michel, and St. Jean-Baptiste. To another informant Amigany is St. Michel. Some deny any correspondence at all, and one denied the very existence of a Marie-aimee. I think that the identifications may be convenient ways of explaining the deities to outsiders but are not functionally signifi? cant to the members themselves. BIBLIOGRAPHY Arensberg, C. M. 1961.
