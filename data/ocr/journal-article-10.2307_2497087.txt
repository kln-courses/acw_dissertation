<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROGER B. ANDERSON Mythical Implications of Father Zosima's Religious Teachings One of the miost perplexing qtlestions in The Brothers Karaiazov is the manner in which Father Zosinma serves as Dostoevsky's spokesmlan on m1atters of spiritual faith. Zosilma's teaclhings emlplhasize hutlmlility, a mystical union of nman anld the world', and tindifferentiated love, the key to faith for him is the individtual's own emotion, the wisdomll of the heart.' In keeping witlh the deeply personal quality of Zosima's mlessage, lhe teaches in the form of short honlilies and stories from his own past. These often lack logical connectives, relying instead on repetition of certain imlages of nature andc mystical conmnunity. MIalcolm Jones has aptly remarked that Dostoevsky withholds specific gtlidelines froml his seekers of faith, giving only the personal experience of incdividual characters, whiclh is bound ulp with the symbolisnm of their own interpretations.2 Because Zosinma's teaclhings are personal and symbolic, they are at odds with logical formulations and intellecttual programls. His nmystical love inspires awe in those he imeets, btit he offers no clear means for following or reproducing his insights. He is as m1utte before ordinary standards of consistency as Clhrist is before the Grand Inquiisitor. The loss is not so great, perhaps, when we remlem- ber how the Grand Inqulisitor uses the logic of hulmlianiistic "love" to advocate enslavement of nman throtuglh the perversion of mairacle, mystery, andl atuthority. Dostoevsky ftully realized the cliffictulties his reaclers miglht face in attemlptinlg to unclerstand Zosinma's message, and hle defenided the difftuse appearance of his elder's teachings. AMloreover, his placement of Zosima's homllilies and stories shortly after the Grand Inqtiisitor's cynical philosophy was intentional.3 Th-e most disturbing problemii in Zosima's symlbolic andl fragmentary teach- ings is the difficulty of labelling themll as unambiguously Christian. Zosima's model was a composite of the O1-thodlox stare'tS,4 but the chutrclh was divided in its attittude toward the fictional elder, and imanly ecclesiastics were less than 1. For a critical reviexw of Zosinia's sentimienitally based faith, see Nathaln Roseln, "Style and Structure in 7/it I3rothicrs Karnama-ozv,' Ritssimi Literatitre Triqitarterly, 1, nlo. 1 ( 1971): 252-54. Rosen contends that it is ilnherelntly wNeaker thani the Grand Inquisitor's critique againist belief. For a discussion of the Grand Inquisitor as victor in his logical attack on Christ andcl faitlh for its owN'tn sake, see Edward Wasiolek, Dostoevskv, Thc JVIaior Fiction, (Camiibridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1964 ), pp. 164--70. 2. See M. V. Jones, Dostocvskv: The Novel of Discord (New York: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1976), pp. 190-91. 3. In his well-kniow,\n letter- of August 7, 1879 to K. P. Pobedlonostsev, head of the Russian clhurch, Dostoevsky emphasizes his anticipatioln of Zosima as anl answer "in artistic form" to the Granid Inqulisitor's logical clhallenige to God (see F. M. Dostoevskii, Pis'ola, 4 vols., ed. A. S. Dolinin [Moscow, 1959], vol. 4, letter 694). 4.

George Gibian refers to the elder's sense of the soil as a mixture of Christianity and anim-iism.6 The Russian critic, R. Pletnev, goes further, writing that Zosima leads us back to the ancient Russian folk image of "Moist Mother Earth" and its antecedents in anthropomorphism and pan- theism. He considers Dostoevsky to be close to the Strigol'niki heresy, the old Russian practice of confessing to the soil rather than to Christian priests.7 We are left, apparently, with a significant contradiction-Dostoevsky's primary spokesman on faith seems too unique and eclectic to fit his own church. But that paradox does not necessarily mean that Zosima's teachings are incon- sistent. Perhaps the critical lens througlh whiclh we have sought to view those teachings needs to be refocused. I propose that Zosima's spiritual vision is clearer whein we view it from the perspective of myth that is, his teachlings represent a cluster of discernible themes-which refer to questions of nature, the related issues of time and im- mortality, and the notion of the individual's place within his group (his nation or his people)-that are similar in outline and function to motifs common to myth. Zosima's teachings diverge from the specifics of church doctrine. They refer to an older spiritual impulse in mlan that is fundamiielntal to mythical tlhought. By adopting this view we are mlore able to appreciate the symbolic collerence of those teachings than are critics who seek a specifically Christian source for each of the elder's mysterious pronouncemenlts. As a point of departure, thenl, it is helpful to point out those elements of Zosima's beliefs that differ from accepted teachings of the Orthodox church. After that, we will he able to examine the elder's beliefs in terms of their own synmbolic structure. Zosima's ecstatic attachimnent to nlature and the earth distances himn from his church. He calls for his listeners to venerate the soil, to water it with tears: "love all God's creation, the whole anldl every grain of it. Love every leaf, every ray of God's light. Love the animals, love the plants, love everything."8 In his book on Dostoevsky, L. A. Zander speaks of Zosima's "love for the earth and 'loyality' to it" as allusiouis to "pagan virtues."9 Zander uses the colmpromlissary 5. Moclaulsky states that "lnot oily liberal criticismii, but also those who venerated the 'old monks and prelates,' such as Konstantin Leont'ev, did not acknowledge the Elder Zosima as the ideal of the 'Russian monk.' Thle image that Dostoevsky created was likewise rejected by the Elders of Optina" (see Konstaintini Mochulsky, Dostoevsky, trans. M. A. Minihan [Princeton: Princetoni University Press, 1967], p. 589). In 1886, governimleint censors wxNithheld permissioni to publish a separ-ate edition of Zosimla's biography and teaclhings on tlhe basis of their subversive potential.

G. P. Fedotov, in his classic The Russian Religious .Mind, speaks miore bluntly of Dostoevsky as a typically Russian expression of pre-Christian attachment to the soil. Father Zosima seems a fitting example of what Fedotov terms "sensual mysticism," "the greatest religious temptation for a Russian will be theism of a sensual (hylozoistic) kind."10 And Konstantin Mochulsky can- didly calls Dostoevsky's elder pantheistic.1" The specific goal of A. B. Gibson's posthumously published book on Dostoevsky is a Christian assessment of the author. But Gibson is also openly bemiused by Zosinma's place in such a scheme, and writes: "Not only nature but supernature is glorified witlhout mention of God." Immediately afterward, however, he states that "Dostoevsky's natural approach to God was through his manifestations; at the end of his life through the joy and gladness of nature."'12 Zosima has a radical and qualitatively different kind of colnsciousness which directly perceives the secrets of cosmic unity. He preaches an undifferentiated unity that extends laterally without exception, connecting each individual to all other manifestations of existence. Included here are not only all other people, but vegetable life and inanimate objects (rocks and soil) as well. The union also extends vertically to join all forms of existence to God: "It's all like an ocean I tell you . . . pray to tlhe birds too, consumed by an all-embracilng love, in a sort of transport, and pray that they too would forgive you your sin. Treas- ure tlhis ecstasy, however senseless it may seem to men" (p. 400). Corresponding to Zosimna's mlystical naturalism is his special attaclhment to h-is dead brother M\arkel. It is tlhe memory of his brother's ecstatic deification of nature and a related emphasis on humlility that resound through the elder's later teachings. It is Markel's words to h-is motlher and servants, "Am I wortlh your waiting on me ?" (p. 373) tlhat Zosinmia recalls just before his duel. He repeats the phrase to hinmself, thinking of how he has just abused his orderly, who again uses the same phrase when Zosima bows down to h-im, asking for forgive- ness (p. 374). While recounting the story, Zosima again brings Markel's mes- sage to life in his teaching of indiscriminate love: "MNly brother asked the birds to forgive him. That soutnds senseless, but it was right" (p. 400). M\arkel, of course, was not an active member of the cltrclh; h-e did nlot observe the Orthodox holidays before his illness and he miade jokes at the church's expense. Nor is Markel's spiritual enlightenment described as emanatinlg from-i the church. He attends services "simply for your sake, mlother, to please andl comfort you" (p. 360). When a nurse wishes to light the icon lampl) in his room, M\arkel does not stop her as he had before. Dostoevsky sidesteps the issue of Markel's identity as a Christialn when he quotes hiim as saying: "Light it, light it, dear, I was a wretch to have prevented your cloing it. You are praying when you light the lamp, and I am praying when I rejoice seeing you. So we are praying to the same God" (p. 361). Zosima pointedly refers to 'Markel, not the teachings of the church, as the cause of his becoming a monk: "For had he not come into my life, 10. See G. P. Fedotov, The Russian Religiouis Alind, 2 vols. (Camlbridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1946 and 1966), 1:56, 63, 20. 11. See Mochulsky, Dostoezsky, p. 589. 12. A. B.

Moreover, in the same breath Zosimna reveals an- other mystery-he considers Alesha to be the source of the same spiritual inspira- tion he attributed to AMlarkel. Zosima's mystical insights into natuire, spiritual enlightenment, and the influence of the dead upon the living emerge without reference to the organized church. Examining Zosima as a representative of the starets tradition reveals more specific discrepancies. In 1921, the miietropolitan of Volhynia, Antonii Khrapo- vitskii, suggested that Zosimla is an aulthentic evangelical representative of the Orthodox faith within the starets tradition. But Sven Linner, who has recently discussed Zosima's links to the historical startsty, considers this opinion to be oversimplified and a distortion of Zosima's essent-ial teachings. He quotes Kon- stantin Leontiev's assertion that withiin the Orthodox tradition, Dostoevsky's religious views, as articulated by Zosima, were "rosy-colored" and inauthentic. Specifically, Leontiev was dissatisfiedc withi Zosima's lack of any "fear of the Lord,"13 for the elder considers our eartlhly life joyful rather than a vale of tears, as tauglht by the churclh. Further^more, Zosinma reflects none of the rigorous regime of the Christian starets as represenlted by Aimvrosii of Optina and Tikhon of Zadonsk, the proclainmed models for Dostoevsky's elder. Amvrosii reflects Ortlhodoxy's view that earthly life for a 1mlonk is a constanlt battle against his passions; the monk hopes for salvation only in the afterlife, and in fear of the Last Judgment. But, as Linner puts it: "This certainly differs from the bright hope witll which Zosima faces eternity."'14 Zosimla preaclhes celebration in this life, because, if the individual but acknowledges it, paradise is already achieved. In the same vein, there are basic differences between Dostoevsky's elder and Tiklhon of Zadonsk. Zosima sees life as part of a great chain linking tlhe individual to eternity, a nmythical intertwining of life and death; on the other hand, Tikhon, says Linner, "looked upon death as the borderline between a life of constantly growing uncertainty and eternal bliss or danmnationl."5 Turning to Zosinma's place witlhin the historical starets tradition, divergences from the ustual mold of Orthodoxy are evident as well. The starets institution is itself a developnment of the Hesyclhast movemenlt of the early Eastern church.16 Hesyclhasm was a special form of miystical asceticism, wlhich took its inspiration from the churclh fathers of MWount Athos, especially from Gregory of Sinai who livTed in the late thirteenth century. The growtlh of tlis tradition in Russia owes a ,reat deal to Nil Sorskii wlho studie(I on Mount Athos in the late fifteenth century. He was, as George i'Ialoney says in lis book on the subject, the most important Hesycllast theorist and writer ill Rtissia.17 As a spiritual practice, Hesyclhasm prinmarily emphasized the heart and tlhe efficacy of sentiment, and minimized the intellect. The mind was to be emptied of all tlhouglht, regardless 13.

Even harmless thouglhts were considered the devil's temptation, wlhich coulld keep the Hesychast from concentrating onI Gocl. Detaclhlmienlt fromll worldly miiatters (Hesychia) was the starting point. Nepsis (sobriety and watchfulness) was the intellectual activ- ity by which tlhouglhts, passions, and ilmental inmages were purged from the Hesy- chast's conlsciousiness. Solitude andl silence were the primary means to this end. To help in such ascetic practices, mlournful contemlplationl of one's own deatlh and the awesomle Final Juldgimienlt (Penithos) were basic.19 The Hesyclhasts held the Neoplatonic view that thoughts, passions, and sensory experience exist in the imind independently and cannot be entirely expelled by the individual. To achieve freedoml froml these, the Hesychast focused onI the wisdcom of the lheart. Subordinating the m-iiid to the heart anld making the heart guardian of all thoiglht were central to both traditional Hesychasmll and Nil Sorskii.20 Spontaleous weeping was hiighly prized as a spiritual gift, a mark of special divine grace: the gift of tears becamle the key to all ascetic activity. Tears were important in two ways: First, they spelled release from tlle ordinary (worldly) workings of the miind, subordinating them to the custody of senti- ments; seconlid, tears openedl the supplicant to a special awar-eness of this life as unavoidably sinful and necessarily fillecl witli grief. Spontaneous weeping linked the Hesychast to the imournful humllan state of original sin and Adaml's fall, resulting in a potent form of lhumljility that placed the Hesychast squarely in the center of the humlan clilemniila of broken comlimlunioin witlh God. Nil Sorskii emphasized that weeping delivered mlan from eternal fire and other punislhnment. The ultinmate blessing of weepinlg was a joyful reestablishillent of union witlh God and a sense of removal froml this world. However, contact with the Divine was achieved only througlh grief anld adcmission of mlan's inevitable failure to avoid sin. The gift of tears was actively souglht by the Hesychast; it was to be prayed for while striving to keep the mind free of thouglhts about worldly miiatters. To this end, certain mieditative practices were followed as a regimen. In addition to the nmore comlmiion ascetic practices of silence, fasting, and prayer, the Hesychast devoted himilself to the constant repetition of the Jesus Prayer (or one of its accepted variationls): "Lord, Jesus Christ, have nmercy Uponl mle." Like the Hesychasts of the M\ounlt Athos tradition, Nil Sorskii suggested the practice of slowinlg the breath and calmling the lheart beat. These bodily functions were to be aligned witlh the cadlence of the prayer for long periods of tinme, often to the point of physical exhaustion. Nowhere in Zosimla's teachinlgs do we encounlter the Jesus Prayer or the idea of a nmonk renouncing the secular worild. Instead, Dostoevsky's elder re- peatedly exhorts his followers to beconme involved in the lives of their secular brethrenl. His menmories of his ownI spiritual growth uniiformily refer to personal details and influences froml outside the churclh (such as his brother, his orderly, the duel, or the miurderer who has long, mlutually influenltial talks with Zosima). Zosima insists that his listeners partake actively in the lives of the simple people, both by teaching them the gospels and, just as imlportant, by sharing their identity 18. Ibid., p. 115. 19.

And the Russian nmonk has always been on the side of the people. We are isolated only if the people are isolated" (p. 394). Thlus, in contrast to the Hesyclastic tradition of seeking salvation througlh solitude and withdrawal from the secular world, Zosimla's repeated miiessage to the mlonks is that salvation lies in active love anld ilivolvement in the otutside world. He issues his fanmous coni- nmancd to Aleslha (in book 2, chapter /7) that he leave the mloniastery and par- ticipate fully in sectular life, yet lhe simultaneouisly ascribes an imiiportant spiritual destiny to the yotung Karamazov. The incidlenit is synmptomlatic of the leader's special and hiighly untraditional visionl: whereas Ortlhodox Hesychasnm sought to separate the secular fromi the sacred, Zosimla seeks to weave thelmi into one fabric. Unlike Hesyclhasts, Zosinma preaclhes that there is no mlaterial hell: 'Tlhey talk of lhell fire in the m-iaterial sense. I dlon't go inlto thiat mlystery anid I shuln it" (p. 404). Even mlore unusual is the elder's tintderstalnditng of lheaven. Disnmissing the basic cloctrine of the Last Jticlgimeint and personal salvation after death, Zosima verges on heresy wlhen he declares that heaven is contemiiporaneotus with man's earthly life: "anld we don't tnitderstand that life is paradise, for we have only to understand that and it will at once be ftulfilled in all its beauty, we shall embrace each other and weep" (p. 375). MXIoreover, Zosima charges lis followers to "water the earth with the tears of votur joy anld love those tears. Don't be ashaamed of that ecstacy, prize it, for it is a gift of God and a great one . (p. 403). He sees tears as a sigin of celebration anid joy; the Hesychasts emnplha- sized tears as acknowledgment of grief and sin in this life. Zosimla espouses tears as a joyful link betweenl man and a harmjionious cosnmos in the here and now. Tears for him join tenmporal life to heaven- tlhrotuglh ecstacy; on the other hand, even Nil Sorskii considered that tears were penlai-ce for sin andl that rentlnciation of this life was a necessary burden.21 The liberties Zosima takes with traditional Orthodox doctrines are noted and emplhasized by other characters in the novel. Several mnonks are eitlher sus- picious of or hostile to the elder's unusual religiotus views. Father Ferapont and the traveling monk fronm Obdorsk are clearly presented as examlples of perverted and overly formlalized asceticism, and their aversion to Zosinma elicits the reader's sympatlhy for the elder's virtues. These two aberrant monks are not alone in their criticism of Zosina, however. MAany of the nmost respected ascetics in the monastery condemn several of Zosima's spiritual practices: "His teaching was false h-le tauglht that life is a great joy and not a vale of tears"; "he did not recognize material fire in hell"; "he was not strict in fasting"; "'he abused the sacrament of confession,' the fiercest opponent of the institution of elders added in a malicious whisper" (p. 415). Earlier in the novel, this charge of improper confession was also brought again-st Zosimla by Fedor Karalmlazov. The early decomposition of the elder's body, of course, is testimony to many that Zosimla had strayed far from the regtular teaclhings of the church, tlhat the rapid corruption of his body revealed his spirittual "corruption" while alive. Zosima's constant modification and loosening of Christian doctrine, whicl were discussed above, raise the question of what constitutes the elder's spiritual 21. Maloney attributes to Sorskii "tlbe necessity of weeping for our sills in order to receive forgiveness in this life before the general judgment when tears will be useless to remit our sins" (Maloney, Ruissiant Hesychlasin, p. 133).</page><page sequence="7">278 Slavic Review vision. Christianity teaches m-zaln to seek the mleaning of his life and his world throtugh specific theological (lognilas (suclh as the Trinity, the virgin birtlh, grace, salvation, the Resurrectioln, and so forthl), tenets which are instrumients of mediation standilng between nmaln in his world and a hiigher order of existence whiclh is called God. In this sense, mlain's belhavior and actions take on meanillg ancd are judged in terms of values that are above and outsicle 1his natural world. Myth, as Richard Chase hias phrasedl it, is different froml religion, in that it conceives of the sacred as raw "voltage," which is inmmlanent in the natural world.22 Since myth regards the ordinary world as already filled witlh preter- natural significance, it tends to have a muclh looser conception of creeds, ecclesias- tical categories, and definitions of the spiritual thaln does developed religion. Thus, myth weaves the sacred into the texture of ordinary life, into the here and now. This distinguishes it from teaclhings of the organized church, througl which we confront the duality of temiiporal, as opposed to sacred, planes of life. Surely Zosinia sinmilarly mixes the sacred alnd the tenmporal in his teachinlgs about heaven and hell as being part of this life, in his adoration of all existence as being holy, and in his adnmonition to partake in all of life as spiritual practice. Philip Wheelwright, a promlinent contemporary critic of myth, speaks of the immanence of the sacred in the nattural world as the "transcendental tenor [which] looms darkly behind the scene as sometlhillg vague, inarticulate, vet somehow of tremendotus, even final, imlportalnce and consequentiality."23 Myth predates organized religion in imali's cultural evolution, and has remained too elastic to serve as an explanatory instrulmient in any developed theological or philosophical sense.24 Simnilarly, Zosimla's holmiilies seeml mlore suggestive and evocative than the more orgalnizedI teaclhiings of Ortlhodoxy. M yth is productively approaclhecl as a psychological process, a state of mind in which symbols of cosmlic order ancl their role in mlaln's life are displayed through images. As a starting point of our discussioln, Alan XVatts's definition of myth can be profitably cited: "Myth is to be (lefine(l as a comlplex of stories . . . which, for various reasons, hutmlialn beings regard as denmonstrations of the inner meaning of the universe andI of humllaln life."25 The potential for human action within this all-embracing sclhemiie of tlhings is the key issue. As Northrop Frye has phrased it, nmytlh brings together some sacred order of mys- teries that holds a place for humllani experience and action.26 The creator of myths is one who intuits the symbols and imiages of how sacred forces pertain to his society's own experience; he is the poilnt of contact between sacred and temporal planes for his group and keeps before his people a continuous blending of the two within their own1 lives. William Righlter makes the samle point when he terms nmyth a primary hum-ian level of consciousness in wliclh mlain-as-clharacter 22.

It is convenient to mlailntain that mythical thought has long since been rejected as a molde of tlinkinig, that its mysteries are mere superstitions which have been supplanted bY scientific objectivity and plhilosophi- cal (or tlheological) explanation. Zosinma seems to suggest that archetypal inmages of total union filled with sacredc mystery contilnuied to hold their special attraction for nineteenth-century nman. Seeking evidence of a mixture of his own finiteness (the factual, temporal) with some immutable order (the sacred) is basic to man. The hulmian need for mytlh is constant; it is the forms of expression that are variable. The view of Zosimna's faitlh as mytlhical is necessarily geared to the network of images he provides. Th-ere is no developed explanation of his mysteries. As in myth, those images are themiselves parts of the divine order and are to be participated in directly, withotut explanatioln.28 The colnstituent parts of Zosima's message are lhis emphasis oll nature, his utlderstalncding of timle and immortality, and his enigmatic idea of the group ancl its organaic national identity. Each com- ponent contributes to his message of holistic ulnlion and simultaneously repeats that union through integrated sylmibols. Myth provides a framework for treating Zosilma's teachings separately, while allowing an appreciation of how tlhose teach- ings fit into a major principle withlin the novel. Zosima develops his vision of faith witlhin the context of nature. He speaks of watering the soil witlh tears of ecstacy, of venerating birds, rocks, and trees; of blessing the sun each mlorning andl evening. He says life is a garden sown by God, and wlhatever grows "lives andl is alive only throulgh the feeling of its contact with other mysteriotus worlds. . . . Water it [tlhe soil] and it will bring forth fruit" (p. 401). For him, human participation in nature's harmony is an integral part of religious faith, it is lheaven realized on earth. The central symbol linking humaln life to transcendlent harlmiony is the el(ler's repeated image of the kernel of wheat. (The key wordc here is harmony and its implication of continuity and stability.) The wheat kernel decomposes in the earth and, by its dissolution, produces new life: "Except a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abicleth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit" (John 12:24). Zosima's focus on the generation of life from deatlh is a fundamental symbol of fertility in world mythology; it is present in the first Egyptian solar myths (which also use the image of the grain of wheat in reference to Osiris), in Slavic myths referred to by Fedotov and Sokolov,29 as well as in the Christian reference of John 12:24. Decomposition and the apparent death of nature each year inten- sify manl's sense of his own death. Frye speaks of myth as a means of displacing primal psychological preoccupations by symmetrical and archetypal forms (usu- ally vegetative symbols), which can then be worked out in a satisfying manner, 27.

For Zosimia, too, cleath is niot aan encl but part of a greater repetitive process; life is nlot lost at cleatlh but reemlerges in new forms, botlh in the vegetative cycle alnd in each hlumliani genieration. In mlyth and for Zosima, the kernel of wheat implies the principle of rebirth andl continuity of hmtnian life, albeit in altered formi. As the elder says, onice an event occuirs, it contilnuies to have an impact on all existence. The death of Markel, for examlple, was not an end but the 1hutmus otut of whliclh Zosimla's owIn faithi had glownl: "I was young then, a child, but a lastilug impression, a hiddeln feelin-g of it all, remaineed in my heart, ready to rise tip anid responld when the timle camiie. So indeed it happenlecd" (p. 363). He coln- siders Markel "alive," nlot only in his ownI life, but in Alesha's spirituial de- velopmiient as well: "He appeared first to mie inn my childhood and here at the enid of niy pilgrimiiage, he seemiis to have comle to me again. It is mlarvelous, fathers andl teaclhers, that Aleksei, who has sonme, thoughi not a great, resemblance in face, seemls to mle so like him spilittually, that imian-y timles I have taken hiinm for that young mialn, my brother, mysteriously come back to me at the end of mly pilgrimage, as a reminder anc an inspiration" (p. 358). The decoml-position of Zosimlla's body tipon his cleath is particularly interesting in this regard, for it re-creates precisely wlhat nattule does each atuttulnl1 (tlhe time of year of the elder's death). He nlot only decomlpposes in physical terms but, like M\/arkel, he "fertilizes" the livAes of those wlho follow him, especially Alesha's. WVhat we lhave, thenl, is three geenerationls of hmtljialn life MIIarkel, Zosima, anld Alesha- each of whomll is linlked to the samiie spirittual inisights. It is clear that there is no encd to the spirittual energy that flows throtughl each of themll; it does not die any mlore thanl nlatture dies at the end(l of its cvcle. All life, lattural and lhtluman, reappears in new forml-s as part of the samiie generativTe process. The denial of deatlh in mlanl and natture lhas always been the essence of tlle mlytllology of the sunli and fertility, reflected in Persephone, Adoniis, Osiris, Moist MA/other Earth, alnd so forth. In regard to the latter, Fedotov writes: "In MAIother Earth, who remiiains the core of Rtussianl religionl, con-verge the miiost secret and deep re- ligiotus feelinlgs of the folk. Beneath the beautiful veil of grass and flowers, the people veTnerate witlh awe the black ioist deptlhs, the soturce of all fertilizing powers, the nloturislhing breast of nature, alnd their own last resting place."31 Zosimlla's exlhortation that people tinite in spirittual love is anl appropriate restatemiient of what miian has always conisideredl a conistanlt in nature the un- dlifferentiated blending of the seasons, of life within deatth.

Natture is the womb of life for the elder, not its grave. Nevertheless, there are characters in the novel who cannot or illii not accept a mlystery that entails their personal dissolution, alnd Dostoevsky uses themii as a cotunterpoilnt to Zosimla's notion of faith. As a result of the elder's deatlh, tlhe town and molnastery alike anticipate miracles. Stuclh predictability, a lolngstandinlg topos in saints' lives, would be most sootlhing. For theimi, mliracles are events that alter the nattural process (a pleasant odor from the corpse or a halt to putrefaction altogether, for example). They wouldl have nature's rhythmii subordinated to their owin static measure- ments of proof. They deem "ullnseemiily" the very heart of Zosima's visionl of faith-tlhe decomposition of one life from wlhiclh new forms iighlt grow. Here again the kernel of wlveat is a touchstone for understanding tlle necessity of dissoltition anld the question of pi-ocess and repetition in tlle vegetative cycle. Even in deatlh, Zosima denmolnstrates that maln gains spiritual faith by yielding his individuality to the wlhole of natture, not by demalnding that nature adjust to his personal system of tenmporal expectations. The expectation of proof as a prerequisite for faith directs otir attention to the Grand Inquiisitor and to Ivaan. The Grand Inqlutisitor jtudges mlaln to be weak, that is, if there is no promise of immortality, mankind calnnot believe. Ivan had earlier eimbellislhed this idea in "WVhy is Such a Mtan Alive," in whiclh he imiaintaiined that virttue is impossible witlhout a gtuaranltee of immor- talitv. Madamle Khoklhlakova plhrases the samiie central propositioni in purely personal terms when she says in "WVoman of Little Faitlh": "I oinly believed when I was a little child, mieclhanically, withotut tlhinking of anything. How, h-ow is one to prove it?" (p. 73) In each of these cases, the colmipression of faitlh into a syllogism is inherently egocentric and limlited. In order to be real, things have to make sense to the intellect oni its owIn termls. Ivan sees this level of thotught as rectilinear. The indlividutal's isolation within his owIn logical standards emerges as a crtucial ontological isstue in the novel. Btut, as Roger Cox lhas poilntecl otit in hiis sttudy of Zosilmia, the elder miiailntainis that the ex- perience of love cannot be contained within sch limits.33 Love simlply bonds man to m1an ancd lm-an to natture. The experience of tlhe broad sense of comnmunity provides a firmler basis of reality in tlhe novel. Active love refers to the primacy of feeling alnd stubordinates the lesser factulty of intellect. For Zosima, the ex- perience of love is real in and of itself, it is an irreducible basic aspect of life. Logic, on the other hand, necessarily stands otutside experience anld caln only interpret reality within the narrow limits of its own propositions. Looic is thus restricted by its own powers of observation. It can describe active life, but it cainiot, by itself, participate in that life; it canniot live. Consequenitly, those wlho clecitice fromii Zosilmia's decay a signl of his spiritual failture are excluded froml the organic lharmloiny of nature anld tlhe eldler's teaclhings on love. They are also subject to barbed satire in Dostoevsky's description of their shallow intellectual pride. Desire for palpable proof among the educated class only reinforces the view held by the Grand Inqcuisitor tlhat moderln mlan is terribly weak wlhen it comes to overcomling his owI secular limitations in matters of faith.

Zosima's emphasis on the vegetative cycle implies a special relation to time. As lhe blends life anid deatlh witlhin hiis ideal of faitlh, h-e also blends tlle usual notions of past, present, aiid future into one repeating entity. For Zosinia, eaclh molmieint can reveal the sacred, and, tllerefore, ordinary concepts of "past" or "future' lose their imeaninig. The elder is an example of wlhat Joseph Campbell lhas described as a primary quality of mytlh-tlhe special capacity of the mmciid to perceive a traiuscendenit secret wlhiclh is timleless and wlhiclh lholds all life togetlhel-, regardless of its tenmporal framiie.34 Graplhic exanmples of Zosimla's special uinderstandlinig of timle occtur as hle retells the story of Job: "the greatness of it lies in the very fact that it is a miiystery-tlhat the passing sllow and tlle eternal verity are brought together in it. In tlhe face of tlhe earthly truth, tlhe eternal trutlth is accomllplished' (p. 365). He speaks of a sacred nlystery that, onice revealed in timlle, becomes unchangeable, applicable to all future momllents in its original potency: "And joh's pr-aising the LordI serves not only Himl but all creation for- gener-ationls and generationls, and forever and forever (p. 365) . The present and ftittire for himil, tlhen, repeat a single process of contact between dlivine revelation aind lhumiian awareness. 'We are again remllinded of the elder's intrigtling remark about the presence of lheaven now, all arotuind nman if lhe couldI only realize it, ratlher than sealed off in somle ftuture condition. Tlhrotughlout, Zosimla insists on a special, ti fflidereintiated utnionl of states (whlether it be life and deatlh or temlporal categories'), wlhereas logical ilan seeks to keep those states separate. Zosimla's freedoml from linear time is one of the basic preocctupations of myth. As Franlik Kermocle lhas stuccintly plirased it, tlle notion of cyclical time is a priimiar-y vehiicle of the lhtluman imlaginlationl for lhandllilng the question of immlortality.35 By associating lhumlnani action witll the mlystery of nature's yearly cycle, says Kermode, mianl overcomlles the idea of hiis own dis9ppearance in time. Mlircea Eliacle, wlho has written extensively on tle (qtuestion of the conception of time in imytlh, conisiders tlhat timlle is otutsidle hiistory in mlytlhical tlhouglht, it is repetitive, a reflection of sonme ulnclhalnginig cosmllology.36 To speak of one's life as a series of events terminated by deatlh is tunacceptable anld absturd for nlyth. Tlhtus, for Zosimla, the sacredl referenlt of one's temporal life is not cli- iminishecl by deatlh, but goes on. Speakiing of tllose wlho m-ighlt refuse to listen to Ilis lhomlilies hie says: "Andl if they are not savedl liereafter, then their sonls will be saved, for your light will not die even wl-hen you are dead.

He sees each person attaining faith at h-is own pace: "If, after yotur kiss, hie [the criniiial] goes away untoucched, mocking at yoti, do not let that be a sttulmbliing block to yotu. It slhows his time has not yet come, btut it will come in dtle couirse" (p. 402'). Zosima's patience is based on lhis own past experience: Markel's visions of nature affect him only after several years have passed, duiring Ihis conversion at the dtuel. He also, of course, tllilnks of the past as repeatilng itself in the ftuture in that Alesha bears the spirittial features he remiiembers in Mfarkel. In Zosima's mlind, timlle de- marcationis fade as he dwells on the constant inftusioln of a single cosmiiC truth within all timie. He feels no haste in reaclhing a different or improved futture; nothilng is in danger of being lost. He possesses the klnowledge-conilimmon in nmTyth-that the present and ftutture will oinly reveal wlhat lhas been votuchsafed in the past. Acknowledging an unclangilng sacred nmystery in one's temporal life is the irreducible stuff of faith. It brings witlh it a sense of contact with an order that is absolute, free of ordinary limilits. In suclh a case, the individual's life on earth becomes part of anl eterncal harmiiolny, freeing himl from the dread of his owln end. To use Eliade's terml, the result is an "overleaping" of time's ordinary limits,38 with man enterinlg into union witlh the sacred wlvile still on this earth. Unlike Zosima, lhowever, anv clharacters in the novel are bound to linear time and insist on distinoutishiln, between present and futture. Maadame Khokhla- kova, for exaimple, craves som1e special satisfaction and fulfillmelnt in the futture that she feels is lacking in the present. She is first given to religiotus zeal, but it muvtst lhold otut assturance of personal iimmilortality. When her hope for nliracles at Zosima's death are "betrayed" and her grasp on immlilortality seems to slip, slhe tturns away fronm religion. However, since the present is still domlinated by the need for a stuperior ftutture, slhe mlerely tturnls to another system aind coln- tinutes looking for the sanme gtuarantees. Science and liberalism, with their prolmiises to control the ftutture and mlantufactture a social paradise, come to absorb as muticlh of her enthusiasm. as did the elder. She is not alone in hier wish to bargain for a special and different ftitture. Altlhotugh the contexts vary, several clharacters color their lives in the present witlh the sam1e anticipation of a quali- tatively hiiglher plane of existence. Witlhotut somne promlise of a breakthrough, their lives are in danger of collapsing and, like AMadame Khokhlakova, they ruslh to aniotlher conveniielnt systenm. Rakitin, for examlple, starts otut as a semli- narian btit quickly switclhes to science ancd socialisnm as better gtiaranitors of the ftuttire; he expounds on the comling glories of science when all the chemical and neurological aspects of the brain will be understood. Father Ferapont cle- votes all of his monastic life to mortifying his body in order to save his soul in the afterlife. His strict fasts and hunts for the devil are meant to gain paradise beyond the grave. The rigiclity of his rules, however, leads him into inevitable conflict witlh Zosima's looser sense of religious revelation as part of the present.

He talks of proof that will olyl be known after the bodyl- lhas been in the eartlh many years, the bones tturniing to one color or anotlher, as the trtue indlicator of whether tlle elder's teaclillngs were trtue or false. Ivan reduices the lhumiian tlirst for a gtuarainteed ftuttire life to its clearest principle. His treatise on clhurclh anld state in book 1 of Tlze Brothers Ka,raiiia.-v,'o centers on mlaln's fear of losing his -i-immortality. Tlhrotuglh the instrumiielnt of excommunication the clhurclh anld state can tlhreaten Iimi with excltusioni fromii that better ftutture: "If everytlhling became the Clhuirclh, tlhe Clhturclh wotill excltulde all the criminial and disobedient, alndl wotuld not ctit off tlheir lheads" (p. 82 ). Later, the Grandl Inlutisitor, the embodiment of Ivan's treatise, states m ore explicitly that mlost of mankind cannot bear life witlhotit the promise of p)ersonal immortality alid will worslhip wlhomlever lholds its gutarantee otut to tlheml: "Peacefully they will die, peacefully tlhey will expire in Thy nanme, and beyolld tlle grave thev will find notlinig but dleatlh. But we slhall keep the secret, andl for their lhappiness we slhall entice tlheml witlh the reward of heaveen and eternity" (p. 326). WVithout a promlise of a ftutture, life becomes unbearable for the average mlaln: "IMan seeks not so much God as the nmiractulotus. And as mlanl cann-ot bear to be witlhotut the nmiractulotus, lhe will create newv mliracles of hiis owln for himlself and will worslip deeds of sorcery and witclhcraft" (p. 321). WVhether it be false religionl, science, or socialisnm (not far fronm sorcerv andl witclhcraft for Dostoevsky), the sedutctive appeal of tlhe placebo of paradise, slhtut off froml the here and now, is the sanme. Zosinma's special visiolns of nlatture andl time slhare a sense of vTast uilionl and continuity. Eaclh conltainls symbols of a broad commlutinity in wliclh the indivicltual gains a special kind of identity as part of a single mlystical process. That process is revealed inl natture's cyclical repetition and in life being recon- stittuted in perpetually nlew formiis. Tillme andl natture miiglht seem like different issues, but Zosima teaches tlheir tinity as cosmllic mystery. There is one otlher modality of this vital tinion for Zosimlla, one that was especially imiiportalnt to DostoeVsky toward the endl of hiis life. Zosillma dwells consistently onI tlle idea of the indlividutal's identity as inextrical-Av botund witlh that of lis comlmultinity, the Rtussian nation. In Zosinlias view there is notlling that lhappens in the grotp that does not affect the in(livi(lllal hle can do notling that will not affect tlhe enitirety of hiis grotup. W/Ve are again reminded of the elder's famiiotus reference to life as an ocean in whiichi eachi individual movement milakes a difference to the wlvole bodv of water. The tlhenmatic reperctussions of muitittual ties and(I responsibility wvitlin an ex- pandlec sense of conmmnity are present tlhrotughotut the novel and are far too extensive to treat lhere in any svstematic faslhioni. Otur task is to disctuss the type of consciotusness in Zosinlia wlhiclh gives rise to that web of mutttuality. Myth is a social plhenolmielnoln, an enter-prise that takes place as a grotup effort. Tlle fact of being a member of the grotup, of slharilig its idlentity, is itself expressive of the continuity that Ernst Cassirer lhas called anl "intrinsic law of mlythI."39 Dostoevsky's eldler emphasizes the valtue of integrating one's personal ego with the larger identity of a grotup, specifically in termls of Rtussian nationalisml. He carries the autihor's treasured principle of Russians as a clhosen, God-bearing 39. Erinst Cassirer, Language and Mlthi, trans. Susannie K.

Here the oppositioln is between the analytical gifts of the WA'esterni miiind andl the synthetic, lholistic capacities Dostoev lsky ascribed es- pecially to the Rtussians. The Wi test, says Zossima, prizes indlividutalism and the mutltiplication of one's owiH personal desires, witlh the restult that the individutal is excltuded froml grotup consciotusness, a variation on Zosima's special idea of lhell: "Ancl wlhat follows froml the riglht of mutiltiplication of desires ? In the riclh, isolation, alnd spirittual sticide . . . men even commit sticide if they are uinable to satisfy it [personal desire]" (1). 392'). But Ruissia, says the elder, bears a comulnnal identity alnd is tlhtus special in the mloderln world. He assures hiis listeners that the Russian individutial draws lis identity frolmi the collectivity of Ills countrymien: "The salv7ation of Rtussia comles fronm the people" (p. 394) "Salvation will comle fr^oml the people, froml tlheir faitlh alnd tlheir meekness" (p. 395) "Eqciality is to be fotundl onlly in the spirittual dignity of mlaln, and that will olnly be uinderstood amlonig uis [Russians]" (p. 395). Zosinia's homlilies on comlmultinity lea(l to hiis ideal of Rtussia as an extended famiily. A crimlinal or sinner never loses lis identity as a member of the group, any nmore than hiis deeds can depriv7e him of lis Russian birthlright. Tlhe Russian church is a very special union for Zosima, for its auitlhority derives nmore from the identity of the Russian aggregate tlhaln froml ordinary tlheological soturces of autlthority. Certaini transcenldelnt inmplications of colimmunlity are also evident in DostoevTsky's NVotebooks, an indicatioln of the novelist's earlier experimiientation with the v alue of the conmmunity for Zosilma: "If tlhere were brotlhers there wotuld be brotherhood. And witlhotut brotherlhood there wouild be notlhing."40 Both the codified beliefs of churchi dognma alnd the emlotiolnal bonds of comllllunal worslhip are features of Christian faitlh and, mlore specifically, of Russian Or- thodoxy. Zosima, howeveer, is mute on mlatteirs of ecclesiastical dogma and directs virtually all of hiis attentioln to the emlotiolnal experience of commlutnal faitl. In lis view, the Russian clhurclh is first and foremlost the body of believers, directed by a sense of their organic umlion, a Unlionl wliclh has definite national overtolnes. By focusing on the poptulist aspect of the conmliulnity, Zosinma skirts tlhe issue of codifiecl theological authority. The Russian clhurch and the colim- mlunitv of nlatiolnal believers are inseparable. He energetically dissociates hiis conception of organiic union of the Russian faitlhful frolmi the Western clhurclhes whichl, hle contenlds, "have long ago striven to pass froml the lower form, as Clhurch, ilnto the hiiglher form, as State, alnd to disappear completely" (p. 85). Zosima's emlplhasis on the individual (lerivillg identity fronm tlle "family" of his fellow Russialn believers can be seen as an outgirowtlh of the Slavophile ideal of sobornost', as propounded by Khomiakov in the 1850s. Tlle idea of sobornost' does not necessarily claslh witlh the Clhristian notioln of conmmlunity as part of general Clhristian belief, even tlhoughl the hiistorical foundation of sobornost', as a way of thinking, witlh its focus on the indlividual's identity being derived from the niir or commllunity, was firmly established in pagan Russian culture, as in most traditional and primlitive cultures, long before the intr-oduction of Clhris- tianity.

If they clhoose to participate, they enter ilnto a commun1111Iity that iincludes the dea(l alolng witlh the living, ald, in so doiino the living retuirn the dead's love to life. If tlhey deny love by emllphasizing tlleir individuality, theyr cut tlhemselves off froml their forefatlhers, for denial of love mleans rejectionl of the essence of their dead predecessors. The callous indi- Vidual wlho so denies hiis anlcestors destroys the clhance for tlheir continued life witlh the living.47 To aclhieve personal spiritual fulfillmllelt, says Zosinma, tlhe individual nmust acknowledge lis idenltity as a iienmber of the Russiali collective anld tlhe single body of belief it represents as anl organic entity. Againi the essenitial simlilarity between mleml1bers of a family aind the nationi is clear for DostoevTsky. As Fedotov explains, the direct participation of a dea(l family miielmiber in the affairs of tlle liviing refers more to the ancienlt folk beliefs of the rod or gens in Russia thaln to Ortlhodox teacllings of personal resurrection.48 If Zosiimla's vision of spiritual collectivity is undlerstood as reflecting age-old Russian practices, somae apparent aml)igutities in his teaclhings gain clarity. The rod cuilt was a Slavic formii of anicestor worship. Onae of its clhief practices was the venleratioll of the departed ancestol- at a feast at whliclh the respected deceased was tlhouighlt to join tlle livi-ng in an atmiosplhere of celebrationl. At that tilmie, tlhe dead, lhopeftlly, gave advice to the living as to lhow to miieet the ftuture. Sokolov remiiarks olI tlhe sim--ilarities of certain rituals of the ancestor lholidays witlh tlhose of Russian xveddings.49 Aleslha's vision of Zosilmia (lutring tlhe elder's ftineral dtuplicates these folklore topoi: Aleslha dreamls lhe is at a wedding feast wlhere lhe shlares winle and food wvitlh Zosinia (now dead buit inlteractinlg witlh the lnovice dluring thle feast) wlho advises him about hiis ftutture: "Begin your work, dear one, begin it, genltle one" (p. 399). The rod ctult is itself an extenlsionl of Slavic agrictulttural mythology.50 Zosilma's central inmage of the kernel of wlxeat "dying" recapitulates riot otnly hiis owti death, btut the postliarvest period-nature's "death"-during whicl Zosiimia dies. The kernel's renewal of life in the spring is, as Sokolov mllaiiltains, connected to the powver of ancestors to affect a goodl crop and offer spirittual advice to the living. This is certaiinly evidence of Zosimia's effect onl Alesha wlho grows enormotisly in spirittial termis after h-is visioln of the elder. Aleslha 47. Such theories about the living having a direct respolnsibility for resurrecting the dead are apparently close to the philosoplhy of Dostoevsky's contemporary, N. E. Fedorov. N. 0. Losskii summarizes Fedorov's main idea: "One must live not for oneself (egoism) and not for the others (altruisnm), but witlh everyone and for evelyone; this is the ulnionl of the living (sons) for the resurrection of the clead (fathers)" (N. 0. Losskii, History of Ritssian Philosophly [New York: International Universities Press, 19511, p. 78). Svel Linner puts the apparent similarity to Fedorov in clear perspective, \vhen lhe says that Fedorov had in mind a science fiction scheme by which future manl wrould gain such techno- logical control over life and the physical world that he would be able to call the dead back to actual physical life (Linner, Starets Zosinia, pp. 199-203). Such notions were basically alien to Dostoevsky's inmagination. His references to Fedorov's "scientific" visiolns undoubtedly have more to do with the author's curiosity about their coincidenital resemblalace to his own thenme than actual influence by Fedorov. 48.

The significance of commiiiaunity for the elder is visible in Dostoevsky's notebooks for the novel. Notes for book 6, in wlhiclh tlhe elder's teachings are concentrated, refer even mlore emplhatically than the novel to tlhe samle idea: "History consists in tlhe fact that all will be united . . . the fanmily becomes mlore encolmlpassing; other tllan relatives enter into it, the beeginning of a new organisml begins to develop . . . from1 an individual organisml to a general organism."52 The inference of ancient rod beliefs clarifies Dostoevsky's idea. Fedotov stuggests that by slharing ancestor holidays at a conlmon time the village (and, bY implication, all of Rtussia) becomes somletlinlig of an extenclecl family: "In tlhis procedure all social life is shaped as the extension of famiily life and all n-loral relationls among miien are raised to the level of blood kinshjip."'53 Fedotov sinmilarly describes the pagan Rtussian emlplhasis on tlhe iclea of the individtual's inmmortality as meaningful only in terms of the greater entity of hiis people's immortality: "Russian pagan- ism (as well as the primlitive Greek) considered the ilclivicltlal only as a transient mlolmaenit in the eternal life of the rod."54 In this sense. Zosiima's view of heaven as acknowledged union and lhell as the individtual's exclusion frolmi hiis grotup takes on special significance. The elder clearly states: "Salvation will come from the people, from their faitlh alnd tlheir maeeknless" (p. 291). Zosinma's myth, like Russian myth, insists that the individual can gain immortality only by acknowledginlg the greater spiritual reality of the grotup. The grotup is eternal, immiutable. The indlividtual, if alone, perislhes; btut if lhe becomes part of that grotup his life goes on as part of the wlhole, regardless of lhis own passing. Again we confront Zosim-ia's mlystical reference to tlhe kernel of wlleat anld hlis special notion of regeneration in life. The examliiiation of lhow Zosima's teaclhings are constittuted and tlle assess- ment of lhow they fit togetlher into a colherent wvlhole lhas shown tlhat, in large 51. The folkloric alId mytlhological imlplicatiolns of the novel are by no m-leans restricted to Zosima. V. E. Vetlovskaia has assesse(d the structul-al simlilal-ities between Aleslha and the thiird son of Ruissian folk tales (tlhe wise fool). AMoreover, slhe suggests that the folkloric elemelnts of the tlhird son also correspond to several saints' lives (see V. E. Vetlovskaia, Poctika r-omain Broat'i. Karoama,vo'v [Leningrad, 1977], pp. 194-97). In a related article, slhe cliscusses Aleslha as a miioderln literal-y version of the revered Saint Aleksei Man-of-God. She concelntirates oin the Ruissian folk versionis of that ,lhitic, in whl1iclh she finds a combina- tion of the worldly anid divine in ilnldiscriminiate love (see V. E. Vetlovskaia, "Literaturnye i fol'klornye istochniki Brat'ev Karamazovykh [Zhitie Alekseia cheloveka bozlhiia i dukhovniyi stiklih o nem] ," in V. Ia. Kirpotin, ed., Dostocvskii i russkwi pisateli: Traditsii, niovatorstvo, iuasterstzo [Moscow, 1971], pl). 345-50). Whereas the typical saint's life emphasizes the separationi of daily matters frolmi ascetic (levotion, Vetlovskaia says that Alesha, like Aleksei Mfan-of-God in folk versions of his life, joinls the duality into one all-inclusive love. The source of such interpenetrationi of secular and divinie love in the novel itself is, of course, Zosima. Indirectly, then, Nve have adcled evidlence of a broad folkloric clesign behinid the elder's meaninig for the reader. 52. Wasiolek, Notebooks For "Tle BRrothers Kaoaranz iov," p. 93. 53.

Ibid., p. 18.</page><page sequence="18">Father Zosima's Religious Teachings 289 measure, unity is clearest when we depart from a traditional Christian focus. The elder most certainly reshapes some Christian doctrine (such as the Hesy- chast doctrine of tears), ignores other tenets (such as the usual ecclesiastical definitions of heaven and hell), and emphasizes still others with a fervor that exceeds conventional church definitions (such as llumility and communal identity of the believing body). Althouigh Zosimiia's teaclhings do not deny any Christian reference-for it is clear that they do apply-it is more accurate to say that his Christian vision relies in a basic way on nmythical elements of Russian folk culture. As a result, to understand fully Zosima's teaclhings on the sacred we must appreciate the extent to which mythical sources penetrate and color his teachings. Dostoevsky's elder and the strtictural conistants of myth both perceive a pervasive unity between sacred and tenmporal planles throuiglhout creation. That unity integrates man with his fellows (his tribe or rod), with his physical world (nature and its rmarvels of the generative cycle), and with timle itself (the sacred force that vitalizes all existence with eternal meanling). Zosima con1- ceives of worship, therefore, as an active acknowledgnment of tlhe spiritual mean- ing of his own world and the people wlho inhabit it. He considers spiritual truths to be revealed and open everywhere, in all aspects of their daily lives. To see others and the physical world as manifestations of the Divine means that all existence is charged with the sacred. To see all things, events, and people as aspects of the sacred nmeans the extension of the notion of union to include the past and future as well as the present, that is, a broader form of pantheism. Markel teaches this to Zosima, who teaches it again to Alesha, who, at the end of the novel, teaches it yet again to the "society of children." The mythical urge toward integration of all factual life within divine meaning is the center of Zosima's message. As in myth, there is no progress toward unity for Zosima; the interpenetration of sacred and temporal is already there and only needs to be acknowledged.</page></plain_text>
