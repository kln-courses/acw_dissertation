<plain_text><page sequence="1">Concepts in Wood and Stone - Socio-religious Monuments of the Konso of Southern Ethiopia Hermann Amborn Institut fiir Ethnologie und Afrikanistik der LMU, Oettingenstr. 67, D-80538 Miinchen Abstract. Carved figured stelae like those of the Konso are a rarity in contemporary Eastern Africa. In this paper, their cultural importance and position within a larger regional context and their historical depth - up to the most recent changes - are to be discussed. While interpreting the meaning of the sculptures of the Konso the focus moves from looking at the characteristics of a single statue on to their arrangement in groups in public space. By turning to their aesthetic aspect the question arises what contents are imparted by these ensembles and what are the life situations depicted by Konso carvers? Which cultural concepts are visualized here, structured in matter? I wish to propose that the statues and their attributes constitute scenarios similar to those on a stage. Their function as memorials for the dead is transcended by their role as representations of the ideal image of the individual and of the social, ethical and religious values of society. Indeed, they are meant to evoke these images in the eye of the beholder. In addition they symbolize the transformation of the living to ancestors, as well as the community of the living with the ancestors and with generations to come. [ensembles of stelae; ancestors; visual representation of values; person and community; interpreting meaning] Anyone travelling through Konso country in recent years constantly found his/her curiosity aroused by groups of wooden figures at the roadside, which seemed to stare at the observer. Some of the figures are radiant in reddish-brown and white paint, but most are quite weatherworn. Sometimes one can recognize a stone stela among the group of figures.1 1 Konso is situated south of Lake Chamo. The main divisions of the Konso speaking area are: Karatti andTakkadi; Kolme; Turo and Arfayte; Pa ayti and Kusuma [Kusumi] (also known as Gato). Between the first three of these divisions and Turo, Arfayte and "Gato" there are slight dialect differences (Black 1973). Karatti and Takkadi are considered here as constituting "core Konso". It is the most densely populated area and walled towns are found only here. Here in particular, (except in the newly-founded Karati-Katama) the specific Konso culture was preserved right up to recent times. Konso Special Warada with a population of approx. 250,000 today also includes Gumayde (populated by Konso, Dirasa, Burji and northern Ethiopians), Gollango, Guma and Gawwada (the last three are Dullay-speaking, with approx. 12,000 inhabitants.) I visited Konso for the first time in 1973/74. In this time I mostly did ethnographic research in the Dullay region, but also stayed for a couple of weeks in Turo. My second visit was in 1980/81. I visited Zekschrift fiir Ethnologie 127 (2002) 77-101 ? 2002 Dietrich Reimer Verlag</page><page sequence="2">78 Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie 127 (2002) It was R.P. Azais who as early as 1931 drew the attention of Africanists to these statues with 15 excellent photographs. The "South Ethiopian Expedition" of 1934-35 was also intended to document explicitly these monuments, a task for which the painter A. Bayrle was appointed. A. E. Jensen and Leo Frobenius were fascinated by the idea of incorporating the monuments of Konso along with other products of their culture into an intercontinental megalithic culture with stone-settings and ritual human killing. In spite of these overblown initial theoretical expectations the Konso monuments only managed to attain a rather more modest existence in scholarly literature. To be sure, although frequently mentioned as a peculiarity, they appeared too isolated for comparison, for East Africa was long considered almost lacking in sculpture. Even in works on Ethiopian art, the Konso monuments were seldom mentioned. Whoever spoke about Ethiopian art meant the Abyssinian-Christian art of the North. Today, however, these monuments are of interest to us for two reasons. First of all, the austere style has a peculiar fascination for the observer and prompts many questions related to aesthetics and meaning: What is the aesthetic intention here? What are the sculptures meant to express or communicate? What is their significance for us and what can they teach us about the Konso? I will not go into the artistic aspects. I will even forego the use of the concept "art", since it addresses an area which is tied up with a specific, modern Western set of issues. Rather, I am initially attempting to describe the formal aspects of the Konso monuments. Then I want to put them into a cultural relationship on the basis of the statement of the Konso themselves. Leaning towards hermeneutic procedures, I will ask which cultural concepts are converted into sensual perceptions structured in material form. Further, how can understanding of the fundamental conceptions about living together in a social system and of the ethics and spirituality of the Konso be achieved from the cult meaning of the monuments in their relationship to ancestors. We know that the Konso stelae are memorials to specific ancestors. The Konso are required to acknowledge the stelae - known as waakaa - but they do not worship them, although many passers-by place a bunch of grass as a mark of respect for the deceased. The stelae are not cult images, and yet they are inseparable from the spiritual ideas and the ethos of the Konso. The second aspect concerns the relationship of these stelae to other African repre sentations made of wood and stone. A glance at distribution patterns of African sculp ture shows that the Konso figures represent a meeting point between African wood carving traditions from the West and the South. Once it becomes evident that these phenomena are not limited to the Konso, we will comprehend even more about the basic structures of socio-religous thinking. places in Konso for shorter periods in 1984 and 2000. In 1991 I visited the Konso living in the Baddaa Huri in northern Kenya.</page><page sequence="3">Hermann Amborn: Concepts in Wood and Stone 79 Fig. 1 Group of stelae: The deceased with headdress (xallassa), shield and spears placed between his wife and an enemy killed by him (photo: H. Amborn 1981). I Description Before turning to interpretation and questions of date and place, let us take a closer look at the sculptures, as we find them in core Konso (Fig. 1 and 2).2 Konso sculptures have clearly defined contours. The trunk and extremities are almost without shape except for the sexual characteristics. The arms are only roughly indicated, while the 2 In addition to my own observations, I can draw first and foremost upon the detailed and sensitive description by the painter Alf Bayrle in Jensen's book ?Im Lande des Gada" ("In the Land of the Gada") (1936: 431pp.)- Hallpike (1972), in a book showing waakaa on the dustjacket, refers to the stelae in</page><page sequence="4">80 Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie 127 (2002) Fig. 2 Ensemble for the deceased with enemies and wild animals killed by him and small stone stelae (drawing: Bayrle in Jensen 1936: 434, Fig. 141). legs form a single column. The figure is anchored in the ground below the place where the knees would be. The head and the hair are fully formed. Disks with a hole in the center, made from the shells of ostrich eggs, are placed on the circular-shaped eyes by the artist. "The teeth are of finely carved goat bone, driven into the figure."3 The nose is always narrow and straight, and occasionally beard is indicated. Individual characteristics are clearly not meant to be represented. The greatest variation is seen in the hairstyles, but there are also differences in neck, arm and head ornaments on the figures within a single group. The main emphasis is always on the front view, and the most prominent line is the vertical. An essential characteristic of Konso sculpture is that the figures always appear in groups. These are arranged in a straight line, and the central figure - the only one with a penis ? is always taller than the others. There are frequently wooden models of spears behind the group of figures, and in front of the stelae are models of monkeys and large several places (e.g. 30; 137ff.; 156ff.). The stelae became known through the good photo documentation published by Azais and Chambert (1931) dating from the 1920s. Cowen (1979) provides accurate for mal and stylistic descriptions based on collectors' items and pictures. The waakaa have been comprehen sively documented and registered during the last years by the French Center of Ethiopian Studies in Addis Ababa. 3 Bayrle in Jensen 1936: 423.</page><page sequence="5">Hermann Amborn: Concepts in Wood and Stone 81 wild animals.4 The figures are painted with red earth pigments. Occasionally the hair is colored black or white. More rarely, the beard or the eyebrows are indicated with black paint. The whole arrangement stands on a low stone platform. On the horizontal surface in front of the figures there are often stones 20-40 cm high standing upright, and one or more menhirs about lm in height made of columnar basalt. The dense, compact single elements, especially the figures, appear static when considered alone, and yet a strong tension is created through the relationship of these elements to each other and to the surrounding space. These ensembles are usually placed on much frequented routes, at crossroads, in public places or where roads leave village or town (paleeta).5 I would like to stress that they are not grave figures. Graves are in clan cemeteries or in the family fields. Usually they are marked by stones about half a meter high and sometimes by carved sticks or models of weapons, but normally no human figures.6 But we would not be in a polycephalous society, with their multitude of choices, if groups of stelae on graves did not also occur when situated close to main roads. According to Konso people, the central figure represents the deceased man with all his status symbols, such as xallassa (a ceremonial headdress), headscarf, necklace and bracelet.7 On his right is usually the stela of his wife. If the deceased had more than one wife, they are on both sides of him. In addition to their sexual characteristics, the figures can be identified by their hairstyles. Next to the wives are the statues of enemies who have been killed and castrated. The Konso can determine ethnic identity from the coiffure. Stylized wooden models of spears and shields represent booty or they show how often the deceased was successful in battle. If there are leopards and other large wild animals, these indicate that the man was a successful hunter. Monkeys and small stones in front of the row of stelae symbolize wealth in the form of many children;8 the stones may also stand for sons. The big menhir corresponds to the central figure. 4 For an examplary illustration, see Jensen 1936: 434. The biggest group of figures contained 21 figures (423). 5 I use ensemble' for these groups of figures and stones to express the general effect of the whole work, where all parts are considered only in relation to the whole. 6 Important lineage or clan heads {poqalla) and their senior wives {poqallteta) are buried in burial woods. On their graves there is one single figure in the style of the waakaa. Photo: Frobenius Archive no. 23 Hal 15-01 and -02: Grave of "Bamballe" (Of a senior wife: Fig. 3). In this respect the inhabitants of Pa'ayti and Kusuma follow a tradition which deviates from that of core Konso (see below). 7 For a picture of the poqalla "Bamballe" with his insignia, see Jensen, Fig. 119, p. 389. See also Tadesse Wolde (1992): "The preserved body of the {poqalla H.A.) Kalla prior to his burial" (p. 15). For a description of the religious role of the poqalla see: Hallpike 1972 chapt.VII; Watson 1998 chapt. 6. 8 "Little monkey" is a synonym for a child. According to a proverb: keltayta kisaa kela waajiror. "Happy time for children at home".</page><page sequence="6">82 Zeitschrift far Ethnologie 127 (2002) Fig. 3 waakaa on the grave of a poqallteta (photo: Elise Demeulenaere 2000). If there are several big menhirs in a group, this is a sign that other groups of wooden stelae stood on this spot in earlier times. Killers who died before reaching a particular gada grade, which entitled them to wear the xallassa, were not depicted in sculptures of humans. But their ensembles include the usual representations of weapons, shields, large wild animals, and stones (Fig. 4). II Interpretation Let us now turn to the aesthetic aspect of the waakaa, in other words to the question of intended sensual perception and the life situations depicted by the Konso woodcarvers. What cultural concepts are visualized here, structured in matter?</page><page sequence="7">Hermann Amborn: Concepts in Wood and Stone 83 Fig. 4 Ensemble for a man who killed enemies and a leopard, but who did not achieve the gada grade of orsayta before his death (photo: H. Amborn 1974). In the first place we should note that in the traditional ideas of the peoples in southern Ethiopia, God is thought of as a being whom we can best interpret as a deus otiosus. As in other parts of Africa, there is no special cult for him. The ancestors are considered to be the greatest spiritual powers. They have a fixed relationship with social elements and watch over the ideal order. In Konso one hears many different and apparently contradictory opinions con cerning the details of what is manifested in the statues, and what is supposed to be conveyed through them. For example, people have different ideas concerning the in tensity of the link between the statues and the deceased person. These extend from the opinion that the statues are there to evoke the memory of the dead, to the view that those who have become ancestors prefer to stay close to them, and even to the belief that at least some of the time ancestor and waakaa are of the same essence.9 For an thropologists this is not surprising, since in Konso religious and spiritual ideas are not ordered in a hierarchical system or canonized in a written system, as is the case for instance in the Christian North of Ethiopia. Rather, they consciously allow the possi 9 In Dihina, where forked posts are set up instead of waakaa, the destruction of a post had disastrous consequences for the direct descendants, because of its essential identity with the soul of the deceased (Amborn 2001:49).</page><page sequence="8">84 Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie 127 (2002) bility of development in a world that is conceived as unfinished.10 Even the myths themselves might appear inconsistent to us, yet one must ask whether they thereby do not do justice precisely because of the contradictory diversity of the world. In any case, the Konso have several interpretive variants for their statues and stone-settings. This underlines the fact that these ensembles should not be considered apart from the sociopolitical, and religious and spiritual aspects of society. The strict separation of observer and object, as we are accustomed to in our present-day art, does not exist (cf. Forster 1990: 67; Vogel 1997: 17). The waakaa are not artifacts that in the end re main external to the human being; rather, they are connected in a common existential context, to which sacredly charged things belong just as much as people. With them and through them areas of central social values are brought to the center of attention. In my opinion, the moral appeal of these ensembles seems to be significant. As we have already indicated, only particular deceased personalities are selected to serve as idealized ancestors in the waakaa, and thus to embody the social values of the Konso. On the one hand, these are religious dignitaries, especially those who also function as lineage heads, and, on the other, persons who have reached at least the penultimate level (orsayta) in the generation group system, and who have also distinguished themselves as successful warriors or hunters of big, dangerous game and are therefore considered "heroes".11 These persons can be recognized within the groups of stelae by their xallassa, the sacred adornment worn on the forehead. Their whole life is exemplary of the proper social order. Stelae of slain enemies or beasts and trophies won by lineage members and assigned to the lineage elders who - after their appointment - were not allowed to kill, are aligned beside the main figure. In the waakaa these elders, now transformed into ancestors, represent the existence of their lineage and the guarantee of its continuation. The transfer of a killers insignia to the lineage elder, as representative of the institution, shows that the act of killing is a social ? because communal ? matter. Killers, whether men who have actually killed an enemy, or those who, like the lineage elder, symbolically unite in their person the killers of a lineage, are identified in the waakaa by the sexually neutral figures accompanying them. In their lifetime, killers are distinguished from other men by their use of certain forms of greeting used only by them. They are also privileged to wear special trousers or bracelets. In the polycephalous societies of Southern Ethiopia they enjoy high social prestige which they can take advantage of in public assemblies, for instance (cf. Braukamper 2001: 10 On the concept of the unfinished creation in the Burji-Konso group, cf. Amborn 1997a. 11 On the generation grading system (gada system) of the Konso, cf. Jensen 1942; Hallpike 1972: chap. VI. Metaphorically they are called xorma (bull). English speakers in Konso use the term hero.</page><page sequence="9">Hermann Amborn: Concepts in Wood and Stone 85 223). Killers are not only considered as heroic, but also as clever, honest and of strong character. One who has been brave enough to kill an enemy or a dangerous animal is assumed to be capable of fearlessly defending a just cause against resistance during difficult negotiations.12 Being able to settle complicated disputes to the advantage of the lineage, the generation group, or the town, is considered a particularly masculine virtue. The representation of wives and sons in the waakaa is also a sign of probity and reproductive ability. If wives and slaughtered enemies appear together, this indicates legitimate issue conforming to social and ritual norms. Fields are a sign of diligence, good health and intelligence. The fact that a man has survived up to the penultimate gada level is proof that no disease has been able to pose a serious threat to him. And dying at a suitably advanced age shows that he is not guilty of any serious offences and has never given anyone cause to kill him. The slaying of male enemies or of big game during ritual killing raids was considered by the Konso, as by many peoples in Ethiopia (Braukamper 2001: 222), as necessary for maintaining the cycle of life, death and ancestors, and thus also as a condition for assuring the reproductive powers of the group. But it would be a mistake to regard killing and procreation in a ratio of one to one. The concepts of procreation, biological and intellectual maturity, death, becoming an ancestor and killing are all part of the socio-religious content of the gada system. As Jensen (1942: 89) pointed out: ?Die Konso haben zutiefst ,erkannt\ dafi die Zeugungsfdhigkeit des Mannes neben dem biologi schen unbeeinflufibaren Prozefiauch einen geistig-religiosen Aspekt hat, der aus einerAn schauung dergesamten Wirklichkeit der uns umgebenden Natur undals ein schopferischer Akt in der Urzeit verstanden werden kann." These ideas are conveyed by the stage-like arrangement of the figures and objects in a specific cultural ensemble. During the extensive funeral rites held about a year after the burial, they are indeed comparable to a stage setting. These lavish celebrations signify the end of the mourning period and the final transformation of the deceased into an ancestor (cf. Amborn 2001: 47). The climax of the festivities is the public erection of the waakaa. During this ritual the deeds of the deceased are recounted in songs of praise. In the groups of figures spectators can recognize the children playing like monkeys at the feet of the "hero" (see above), they recognize the wives, they see the fields acquired by the deceased and they learn of his heroic deeds in hunting and war. However, this picture is not "true to life"; the waakaa, with their static and stiff frontality, demonstrate in an almost dramatic way the confrontation with extraordinary time. This "stage setting" is left in place after the celebrations. It points permanently 12 By way of example, during big assemblies, discussants support their (civil) arguments by pointing to their clever, calm and fearless performance of heroic deeds, to whatever extent they deem to be necessary. I was able to observe the connection between such warlike and peaceful aspects of masculinity during many public assemblies.</page><page sequence="10">86 Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie 127 (2002) to another dimension of existence and, together with the other waakaa, is an admonition to remember what was heard in the songs of praise and at the same time a confirmation of the observers own identity. For lineage members, therefore, the waakaa are far more than just memorials. They are witnesses to the vitality of their lineage. In their three-dimensionality the ensembles fit into a concept of meaningful places which involves the whole landscape. As I have explained elsewhere (1997b), the people of Konso, as a result of their socialization, are able to perceive their landscape as a readable system of meanings, with structured signs, in which all cultural systems are integrated, whether economic, aesthetic or moral. The groups of stelae are among the mnemographic locations which make it possible to traditionalize culture, i.e. which enable the creation of a cultural tradition, and to grasp it as a whole through associative links. This is also the reason why only certain personalities can be chosen for the waakaa\ the deceased must have been a successful warrior, hunter, husband, citizen and farmer. The ancestor presented in a public place is a social model who has contributed to the strength, fame and honor of his lineage and his town. In addition, the link between killer and ancestor serves to symbolize the cosmic relationship. Besides the religious concepts associated with the gada system, we should also mention other concepts relating to the clan or lineage. In Konso the lineage can be interpreted as a corporate unit (to follow the usage of British social anthropology), which in addition to the living also includes the ancestors and the unborn. The lineage elders, who are considered the direct descendants of the first people, represent these paradigmatically. They symbolize the unbroken sequence of birth ? life - death. In a spiritual sense each individual is a part of this socially unified body. Deceased persons who have shown respect for the corporate moral system during their lives become ancestor-heroes. Transformation into the community of ancestors follows those rites which culminate in the erection of the waakaa. It was the community of almost completely depersonalized ancestors who, in the distant past, created the existing order as willed by God. Now intermediaries between God and living human beings, they ensure that this order is properly observed. All rites and ceremonies are held in honor of the ancestors. They are the guarantors of the fertility of land, livestock and people. In his study of the Tallensi in West Africa, Meyer Fortes emphasized the phenomenon and the role of the depersonalised ancestor and showed it to be one of the main pillars of African ancestor worship. He also pointed out that without the help of the descendants who have to perform the transformation rites, they could not become ancestors. They would be forgotten (Fortes inter alia 1961). Even if we can hardly construct any connection between the Konso and the Tallensi beyond the realm of comparative religion, Fortes' interpretation model in respect of ancestors can largely be applied to the Konso and thus shows the wide distribution of comparable religious conceptions (cf. Amborn 2001: 43).</page><page sequence="11">Hermann Amborn: Concepts in Wood and Stone 87 With their monuments the Konso have succeeded in releasing a tension inherent in their conception of the ancestors. On one hand the monuments are supposed to show the exemplary deeds of an individual, while at the same time they should allow for the entry of the deceased into the company of ancestors and thus be an idealized depersonalization. By emphasizing individual deeds in a generalizing and idealized monument the Konso have succeeded in creating a relationship both between personal and shared experiences and vested social values. Here the avoidance of individual features is an important stylistic principle.13 Just as the ancestor has become an idealization of man, "the image of the ancestor is an abstraction obtained from the human figure55.14 The whole ensemble congeals into a type and thus becomes a communicative symbol. A Konso wood carver does not work with a human model. On the contrary, he often secludes himself from human company for several weeks to create his sculptures. During this period of isolation he is in contact with the ancestors through the agency of sorghum beer, while every evening dances are performed close by.15 The process of producing the figures is already part of the ritual. The wood is not obtained from ordinary trees, but only from trees which are reserved exclusively for ceremonial purposes. Juniperusprocera is the favorite species, frequently chosen after consulting a seer. The cut logs are buried in the floor of a temporary hut especially erected for the wood carver, and soaked with water for a period of one week. Later, while the work of carving is in progress, they are buried in the hut at night, where the carver stays until his work is completed (Jensen 1936: 422). In the act of carving - which takes place away from daily matters - life and death become one through presentation (Vergegenwdrtigun$ of the ancestor in the figure that is being created. In order to be able to work "properly55, the carver retreats completely into himself, into his inner vision. "Properly55 means: by executing and preserving certain vested forms, whose symbolism is readable for the community and which ensure the identification of the carving as an ancestor. The carver must be skilled with his hands and have a feeling for shape and proportion; individual modifications are allowed only to a small extent.16 The intention is to represent the 13 But there are characteristic differences between the figures within one ensemble. 14 Kramers (1990: 40 translation H.A.) general account of African representations of ancestors is also applicable to the waakaa of the Konso. 15 Jensen 1936: especially 422f, based on information recorded by his companions, Wohlenberg and Bayrle. I myself had no direct contact with Konso carvers, but I have spoken with other people about their work. Wood carvers are not included among the professional artisan groups (xawd'd) who are determined by birth. They belong to the "skilled people" (harmitta). But I have heard that there are also people among the xawd'a who make waakaa (cf. Amborn 1990: 300f). 16 It would be wrong to see the carvers as craftsmen in the contemporary Western sense. Since, for instance, consistency in material quality can not be assumed, it is not enough just to learn a few manual skills. The carver transforms his spiritual activity into "culturalized" matter through the organization and coordination of manual skills and various actions (cf: Amborn 1990: 410).</page><page sequence="12">88 Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie 127 (2002) Fig. 5 waakaa for a woman, in the Kusuma style. Cultural Centre in Karatti town, confiscated from thieves (photo: H. Amborn 2000). idea of a personality and the concepts of dignity, courage and greatness (Bayrle in Jensen 1936: 433). However, this does not mean simply the reproduction of stereotypes. Above all, there are striking regional differences. It is also possible to detect changes which have taken place within one region on the basis of statues preserved in museums or from photographs (from Azafs until today).17 Of course this applies in Konso as well, but in this case such an investigation is necessarily limited to a small number of features, due 17 Cowen (1979), in particular, has attempted to show this on the basis of a few examples which he had at his disposal. Further analysis of the French photo documentation (see note 2) should give us important insights into stability and innovation, and the conditions on which they depend.</page><page sequence="13">Hermann Amborn: Concepts in Wood and Stone 89 to the severe weathering of statues that are more than fifty years old. On closer examination, the objects also reveal the individual features characteristic of different carvers. Obviously, a family in Konso who wants to commission a waakaa knows where to find a skilled carver who not only can make waakaa in the proper way, but who will also produce an optically "pleasing" result. There are clear differences in form and concept between the waakaa in core Konso and those in Pa'ayti and Kusuma (Gato) (cf. note 1). Due to a lack of reliable sources, however, interpretation of the conceptions associated with the stelae must remain vague.18 A striking stylistic feature of the statues in Kusuma is that the sides of especially the upper part are more carefully worked, which shows that the figures are also meant to be viewed from the side, while in core Konso it is clearly intended that they should be viewed from the front (fig. 5).19 This is probably connected with the fact that groups of stelae in Kusuma (and Pa'ayti) contain a smaller number of figures than in core Konso, and that here they are single monuments standing on graves within burial places. There is no concentration of waakaa groups in public places, and thus no demonstrative public exhibition. Every adult person is given anthropomorphous grave figures, and, unlike in core Konso, not only killers are entitled to wear the xallassa. Praise of successful individuals, especially killers and hunters, is obviously less important here, which is probably due to the fact that the gada system was observed less strictly and finally completely abandoned.20 Jensen (1936: 427) supposes, probably correctly, that "civil" deeds are given more emphasis among the Kusuma. He reaches this conclusion on the basis of symbols of wealth placed on the graves and because of a local feature frequently seen in the arrangement of the stelae: the deceased person is accompanied by two people (one of them without a face), who represent neither wives nor children, nor slain enemies. On the basis of his information, Jensen (1936: 428) compares their appearances to those of an European advocate and a debtor respectively.21 18 Jensen, who admired the stelae of the "Gato", draws upon statements made by the painter Bayrle in 1935. As an ethnologist Jensen had little success there: ?Die Gato sind im Gegensatz zu den benachbar ten Konso ein ausserordentlich unfreundliches, murrisches und verschlossenes Volk, die uns bei alien Expeditionen ablehnend und auf alle Fragen schweigend begegneten." (Jensen and Haberland n.d. [around 1957] Ms.: ?Gato Maschile, Gidole und Bussa" [14 pages].) I myself have seen only a few sculptures in situ in Kusuma. Tourists and other interested parties had helped themselves liberally even before the 1970s. In former times the road to Konso and Yabello passed through this area, and the burial places are also not far from Gidole, which until recently was the important regional capital. But there are still many waakaa in Pa'ayti (pers. comm. Nicole Poisonnier). 19 Further striking formal differences are the representation of the beard and a lack of emphasis on other sexual characteristics. For illustrations, see: Jensen 1936: Fig. 72; 128; 142; 144; 145. Tf. 26-30. Cf. also Cowen 1979:219; plate VI. 20 In 1935 already, there was no longer a gada system. Kusuma was under the sway of the influential priestly chief of Dirasa (Jensen 1936: 399 and in the manuscript mentioned above). 21 The figure to the left of the main figure symbolizes the "bidd\ according to Jensen a kind of lawyer or business friend of the deceased, who witnessed all business transactions during his life (Jensen 1936: 428).</page><page sequence="14">90 Zeitschrift far Ethnologie 127 (2002) Fig. 6 Slightly weathered waakaa, with menhir (photo: H. Amborn 1974). Working with wood and stone: a creative discourse of permanence and temporality Let us return to core Konso. If the observation of certain formal criteria already marks partial depersonalization of the one who has become an ancestor, the successively increasing assimilation of the ancestor into the corpus of the ancestors is conveyed by deliberately leaving the wooden sculptures exposed to the destructive effects of the weather. For a time following erection of the stelae, the central figure is crowned on certain occasions with the same climbing plant (xalaalaa) as killers, to honor the memory of the deceased. Otherwise the ensemble is not be touched again by anyone. Eventually the little hut collapses first which protected the stelae in the beginning; the paint is washed away by rain. Slowly the contours become more and more unclear (Fig. 6).</page><page sequence="15">Hermann Amborn: Concepts in Wood and Stone 91 Over the years insignia of rank and sexual differences disappear; insects attack even the best quality wood, until at last after three or four generations nothing remains of the wooden figures.22 Like the transitory wood, memory of the individual also slowly disappears. But new ensembles next to the weathered ones show that there is no end to the processes of death, transformation into ancestors, and childbearing, and that in the final analysis life is stronger than death.23 The slow decay of the wooden sculptures is a kind of challenge to following generations to perform deeds like those of their forefathers and to continue erecting new wooden waakaa as proof of these deeds. The transitoriness is obviously deliberate.24 The waakaa figures are meant to be reproduced, just like the cultural values which they embody. Through this reproduction a link is set up between past and future generations, and perceived as a member of an apparently eternal chain. But at the same time the waakaa remain open to reinterpretation in this polycephalous society. It is not a contradiction when the unhewn basalt menhir remains as the only stable element in the whole ensemble after the rest has disappeared.25 It takes its place among the many other menhirs as a depersonalized symbol of the whole lineage. Classic British social anthropology, based on ideas of Henry Maine, interpreted lineages as corporations. Maine's well-known saying, "corporations never die", is obviously applicable to the Konso. After all, with their monuments they have clearly demonstrated the truth of this interpretation. All that has been said up to this point justifies the assumption that it is no coincidence when the Konso use both wood and stone within an ensemble.26 We are hardly mistaken when we assume that they use this pair of opposites - transitoriness (wood) and 22 In the burial wood for poqallteta of the Kalla line, the state of decay can be observed and reconstructed, since the death dates of the last three poqallteta are known to the present-day Kalla (information: Woldedawit Kayote Kalla, November 2000). 23 There is a proverb in Konso according to which: "We triumph over death through our children." 24 Examples of the temporary character of laboriously made ritual objects are known from many non state societies. One of the best known cases is the Malanggan carvings for the burial and initiation ceremonies of the same name from New Ireland (Biihler 1933). 25 Setting up stones with religious associations is known in many parts of the world. Certain parallels with areas as distant as Southeast Asia cannot be overlooked. There are also striking external similarities with prehistoric stone-settings. These phenomena have fascinated not only the academic world. The attempts that have been made to create a coherent cultural horizon are associated with terms such as "megalithic culture", "megalithic system" or "megalithic complex" (see especially v. Heine-Geldern 1958, Schuster 1960). German cultural historians in particular saw a connection between megaliths and the so called feast of merit, among which they included human killings (for a critical account of the "meritorious complex" see Braukamper 2001). For our present purpose we shall limit our discussion in chapter III to parallels in closely neighbouring areas. 26 In my opinion, Jensen (1936: 426) does not go far enough when he assumes that this is simply a case of double representation.</page><page sequence="16">92 Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie 127 (2002) permanence or eternity (stone) ? deliberately for the endowment of meaning.27 The Konso are qualified to do this on the basis of their knowledge of materials and the embedding of these in their visible environment, as gained from their intensive daily contact with stone and wood. Like human beings, the living tree is in a process of natural development. Once it has died and become lifeless wood, its transformation into a waakaa symbolizes the transformation of the dead person into an ancestor. Stone, on the other hand, especially columnar basalt, retains its shape, mass, size and weight as well as its inner structure. Stone (d'aka) is the material used for house foundations and for the terraces that enable the cultivation of food crops on the hills where erosion is a constant threat. Here, stone symbolises permanent securing of the means of livelihood.28 So-called "stone manuring' helps to retain vital humidity in the fields;29 and meetings are held on the platforms covered with big stone slabs inside of and in front of the men's houses. At the most important ceremony in the life of a man, however, his entry into the gada cycle, a wooden post (olahitta, made of juniper wood) is erected for the new group; the same applies when a new lineage chief (poqalla) is installed. Like the waakaa these posts are left in place to rot away and are a symbol of the constantly recurring generations. In the Karatti region a stone is also erected on this occasion, not far from the ceremonial ground. It takes its place in a series of stones which serves to recall the cyclical return of the generation groups.30 To document military victories of a town community, menhirs that often exceed the height of a man and made of columnar basalt, are erected in public places (mora), in order to show the community's strength and resistance. Public oaths are sworn beside stones at particular mora. At another mora there is a stone used by warriors to sharpen their weapons, just as their victorious ancestors did, before going off to fight, in order to be properly armed for battle. In the men's houses are heavy, obviously deliberately oversized wooden beams bearing the marks of the gada group who put them up. From the Konso conception of temporality and permanence, it can be assumed that these beams are meant to last until a new generation group with the same name is installed again after several generations.31 In 27 "Deliberately" can be used to refer to "unconscious activity of the human spirit" (Levi-Strauss). 28 For example: A farmer from the neighbouring Dirasa, whose fields are at about the same altitude as those of the Konso, told me he envied the Konso their stony ground, because it enables them to "preserve the fertile land for so many generations." 29 In stone manuring, stones are spread over the fields as a protection against evaporation and to collect dew (see for example Amborn 1987: 62). 30 The stone is added to other stones previously erected for the same purpose in a wood below the ceremonial ground (Hallpike 1972: 192 note 1). 31 In the Southern Ethiopian generation group system, the names of the generation groups recur in a cycle. The duration of the cycle varies in different regions. The connection of these cycles with the life of the wooden beam is based on only one statement recorded during my stay in the Konso town of Pattankalto in December 2000.1 have not yet had an opportunity to check it.</page><page sequence="17">Hermann Amborn: Concepts in Wood and Stone 93 living houses, certain wooden supporting beams and the wooden entry to the compound are of sacred significance. The roof and walls of a house seldom last longer than a human lifetime, but the next generation must build a new house on the raised foundation, which is made of stones. However, there are other features in addition to these external ones. Objects are endowed with a specific essential being, as a result of their respective particular material and their relationship to other objects. Essential being is not the same as animate being.32 Sensory perception and knowledge gained through practical experience initiate a cognitive process, thus making social discourse possible, a process, which, once initiated, contributes in turn to the growth of the domains of experience and knowledge. They are an integral part of the Lebenswelt of the Konso and help to situate symbolic messages within a current ontological context.33 All the above mentioned practices, concepts and elements are interconnected with each other and with elements not mentioned here, such as ethos and soul,34 forming a common Sinnhorizont (Gadamer; i.e. approx. a horizon of meaningfulness) - a culturally-specific unity of understanding - in which the Konso experience, recognize and grasp their world. The knowledge, gained through the cultural context, that mat ter contains meaning, penetrates the waakaa, while the waakaa in turn are an integral part of the entire Sinnhorizont of the Konso. Reference to the Sinnhorizontis continually renewed through waakaa erected in prominent places, also allowing the individual person the possibility to understand themselves, and thus to define or find their identity. waakaa in the year 2000 In the past ten years dramatic changes have occurred. During Imperial times, under the Italian occupation, and under the rule of the Derg, the Konso successfully resisted all outside attempts to spoil their culture. The far-reaching changes which affected many other neighboring groups did not take place. Under the new federal order, indigenous officials were placed at the local centers of power, which in principle was a 32 In my opinion, describing this kind of essence as a force comes close to the idea, but is still unsatisfactory. At any rate it is clear that lifeless objects in the sense we mean do not have a "soul". 33 Lebenswelt (life-world) is used here in the sense proposed by Gadamer (1990: 251): ?...der Begriff Lebenswelt (ist) cdlem Objektivismus entgegengesetzt. Eristein wesenhaftgeschichtlicher Begriff, der nicht ein Seinuniversum, eine ,seiende Welt' meint. ...(Lebenswelt ist) das Ganze, in das wir alsgeschichtlich Lebende hineinleben." 34 Amborn 2001. In this paper I mainly concentrated on the ideas of the neighbouring Dullay In my paper "Soul, Person and Ethos", presented at the 14th ICES in November 2000 in Addis Ababa, I referred to the close links between these ideas and the conceptions of other ethnic groups in the Burji Konso cluster.</page><page sequence="18">94 Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie 127 (2002) good thing. These "educated people" received their training in the only way possible, at either mission schools or state schools where Amharic was the first medium of instruction - and still today is in Konso.35 Especially those who have received their education through fundamentalist protestant churches from the United States or who are members of these churches, look down upon their own culture (at best) with shame and disdain. The resulting effect of this change in power relations is that criticism and pressure against deep-rooted conceptions and values in the society now no longer comes from outside but from inside. For in many families, or at least in every lineage - whichever Konso town they may live in - there will be an educated person. Up to 1990, Western missions had only relatively little success and the Ethiopian church conducted no mission work at all, but after this date the situation changed abruptly. Today the majority of Konso - at least the younger generation - are Christians. But here there are at least two camps: fundamentalist protestants adopt an extreme position which involves categorical refusal to take part in traditional rites and ceremonies, while members of the Ethiopian Orthodox church in rural areas are more liberal in this respect. But instead of honoring the old sacred places, members are just as likely to found revering cheap prints as if they were icons, such as one in which a white, fair haired St. Michael attacks a dark-skinned devil with his sword. This development has naturally not been without effect on the waakaa. To start with the worst: they have been dug out by the local people themselves and sold to art dealers through organized gangs. What once was part of the meaning of the waakaa, standing openly outside the towns in publicly accessible places, is now their undoing. Even indigenous officials are said to turn a blind eye to the sale of this "heathen stuff". But the art collector commits a double sacrilege: he takes a religiously charged object out of its socio-religious context, thus reducing it to a mere object to be handed over to "western" art which is impervious to the originally intended aesthetic, and further he degrades this "naked", alienated object to the level of merchandise to be traded on the market. In recent times the police have been able to confiscate a large number of figures, and reportedly the number of cases of theft has dropped. Nevertheless unrest among the population has remained, not only for peoples fear of loss, but also due to a deeper sense of insecurity anchored in their religious convictions. How could indigenous thieves desecrate the forbidden places without suffering the revenge of the ancestors? One suspect did indeed die after a short illness, and many a "traditionalist" may still be hoping for further deaths. But for most people the waakaa have lost their threatening sacredness. 35 Under the Imperial and Derg governments, the pupils at the secondary school in Gidole, for example, had it drummed into them that they should give up their "useless and outdated culture and instead strive to copy Amharic models". It is true that today other cultures may be studied in school, but, as far as I know, this has not been taken advantage of in Konso.</page><page sequence="19">Hermann Amborn: Concepts in Wood and Stone 95 Officials are surprised when families do not want to have the waakaa of their forefathers returned to them. One frequent explanation for this is the high cost of the ceremonies that would be necessary in order to re-erect them. This may well be one reason. In the light of the religious conceptions bound with the waakaa, refusal to re erect the waakaa once they have been destroyed seems plausible to me, for however painful the loss may be, this would not be justifiable in religious terms. The wooden figure is not intended for eternity (as shown above), and its original erection not only marked the end of the period of mourning, but also ensured protection from death, which was a threat to the families of the deceased s sons during the period of mourning. However, there are cases where ensembles damaged by theft - usually the central figure is missing - are supplemented. In one case known to me, the remaining figures were also repainted.36 In some places the waakaa are even valued and protected as a tourist attraction. A fee can be asked from people who wish to take photographs. Nevertheless, there are still places where tourists should beware of approaching the waakaa too closely, for even Christians fear that the severe drought of recent years is a warning signal from the ancestors. For many young Christians the question whether a waakaa should be erected for a deceased (non-Christian) father has become a serious matter of conscience. Superficially this is a conflict between pious feelings towards the deceased father and the conviction that "heathen" customs should be rejected. But the matter is really far more complex than this. For the Christian son, with his new communication system, the waakaa, in its former function as a multi-layered set of signs, appears reduced in its complexity and removed to another level of consciousness. The fact is that many Konso are caught up in a crisis of meaning, and the fast changes that have taken place in their Lebenswelt in the last ten years have resulted in a steep increase in cases of mental illness (communication from Dr. med. C. Otto). However, one thing that has not changed is the esteem in which killers are held. There was no problem in integrating this form of hero-worship into the modern scheme of things. It was deliberately appealed to and successfully exploited in the name of the national state ideology, when soldiers were being recruited for the recent war. But the idea of the hero was stripped of its central element: knowledge of the connection between death, becoming an ancestor, life, future generations and ethos. It is remarkable how, in recently erected waakaa, the Konso try to take social changes into account, at least as far as external appearance is concerned. For example, the central figure may hold a Kalashnikov, or he and the wife at his side wear crosses. Some ensembles are even decorated with the Ethiopian national colors. There are also changes in the use of materials, a process still going on at the moment. It is considered progressive to make the platform on which the monument stands out of concrete, 36 Photo documentation by the French Center of Ethiopian Studies in Addis Ababa.</page><page sequence="20">96 Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie 127 (2002) Fig. 7 Dancing puppet, h. 19,2 cm, 1981, photo: A. Laurenzo 2001). instead of stone slabs as in earlier times. All these things do not necessarily imply changes in the meaning of the ensembles. Some symbols are certainly interchangeable, and could even contribute to enlivening the whole concept. But there are signs that with the disappearance of traditional rites and the reduction to a now alienated cult of the hero - unless attempts are made at revitalisation - the monuments become mere memorials. Their sensory connection with Christian tombs would then only be logical. Yet the connection would remain an external one, because the temporary end of a cut off indigenous context of tradition (Traditionszusammenhang) cannot simply be connected with symbols that belong to another frame of reference - unfamiliar and therefore not understood or misunderstood.</page><page sequence="21">Hermann Amborn: Concepts in Wood and Stone 97 Who knows, perhaps some day we will find graves in Southern Ethiopia with waakaa as a mere folkloric adornment. Of course, it is still too early to present a definitive interpretation of changes in meaning and new developments. Not only with regard to the waakaa, the Konso have entered a critical time of upheaval, later than many other African ethnic groups, and we can only wait and see how they create new meanings under changed conditions - perhaps learning from the mistakes of others. There is a further development that should also be mentioned: Wood carvers have found a new direction for their skills. This is linked to the tradition of wooden dan cing puppets that have been made for the last few decades. These puppets are seldom more than 20cm high and were used by singers to rhythmically accentuate their songs.37 They resembled the waakaa in style, but there were also more naturalistic forms. The new figures are far bigger, but they are never as big as the waakaa (Fig. 7). The present day motifs cover a wide range. In addition to animals, some of which have mobile limbs, the tourist will find, for example, men making butter, women holding children in their arms, or young girls in the latest Konso fashions. Ill Distribution and dating There is no doubt that the Konso stelae form an independent stylistic group, but there are a number of links with other regions, where chronology can help us to reach certain conclusions. I would like to look briefly at related phenomena in the west and the south, and then to examine parallels in the Rift Valley. But first it should be mentioned that at least until the end of the 19th century sculptures in the Konso style were also erected by neighbouring ethnic groups. Of particular importance here are the immediate neighbours (Dullay and Burji), where forked posts are usually used instead of figures, whereas grave figures are made for one lineage-head family in Gollango and another in Diginti (Amborn 1990: 300f.). The Gollango stelae are, at most, half the height of those in Konso, without limbs or sexual characteristics and with no distinct face. According to recent information, received in the year 2000, the lineage-head family concerned has since become so impoverished that it had to give up this tradition. A little less certain is a source relating to an example from the Wolamo (Wallaytta) region (Frobenius 1923: Plate 173), but wooden anthropomorphic sculptures appeared even in Wollega (Cerulli 1933: 39 ff. PI. 7). In 37 On the puppets' underside is a central hole, in which a wooden stick, serving as an axle and planted in the ground, is affixed. A string connects them to the hand which is used to strike the lyre, so that the puppet can be moved up and down and made to rotate. In the year 20001 no longer saw them in Konso.</page><page sequence="22">98 Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie 127 (2002) a westerly direction we find comparable objects, from the Bari (Junker 1889,1: 309) to the ancestor memorial sites of the Bongo in eastern Sudan (Bahr el Ghazal). Among the Bongo, where it is possible to see some cultural parallels with Konso, we find ensembles containing several wooden figures.38 Wooden figures obviously were also made by the so-called Ingassana - Mt. Tabi, to the west of Roseires in Sudan (Seligman 1924: 113f.) and to the south of Sennar (Djebel Guke), probably also "Ingassana" (Zoeppritz 1877: 8). The latter were post sculptures; more about their form is not known. However, they obviously were connected with ancestor worship. Comparisons can be found in the south: Within the Mijikenda Group in Kenya specially the Giryama erect memorial effigies. The body is represented as an ornamented board without extremities or sexual characteristics (Champion1967: Plate II; Schlegel milch 1982: pp. 44). Even if we go as far away as Tanzania, we find some parallels, but in this case between the Konso dancing puppets and certain puppet figures of a marionette type.39 If we turn our attention to the north, we find the prehistoric stone stelae of the Rift Valley and the more recent monuments of the Arsi. The relationship between the Konso stelae and these monuments has been pointed out by several scholars.40 Here I do not intend to illustrate and discuss the pattern of distribution or historical connections; I would only like to point out some parallels that suggest a meaningful relationship between the monuments. In the light of recent research we can conclude that most of the prehistoric stelae and the recent ones in the Arsi area were erected for outstanding deceased persons. This is clear from their association with burials. We can draw further conclusions from the subjects represented. In Konso certain dispositives were joined together to form ensembles, and in the stone documents we find parallels to this in the decoration. A link is formed by the often brightly coloured monuments of the Arsi, with their relief motifs.41 They draw attention to the man of merit and serve to perpetuate his deeds. They tell of his successes as a warrior, and the number of his wives, children and cattle. Here, too, as in Konso, killers enjoy special distinction. The ensembles consist of several flat stone stelae ? mostly in circles ? which, unlike in Konso, are erected directly at the grave. The greater the merit of the deceased, the more stones he is given. Although the Islamization of Arsi was completed about forty years ago and despite the fact that it is forbidden in Islam to make pictures of people, the custom of erecting figures or pictures painted on stone slabs, representing the 38 Schweinfurth 1922: 150?; Jensen 1936: 580; Kronenberg 1981: chapt. 9 and 10, e.g. fig. 55 ff. 39 Cf.

Braukamper 1999). deceased (most frequently as a horseman), in stone circles has developed there, cf. Fig. 8 (Braukamper 2001: 230). The nearest analogy to these stelae are the prehistoric stelae in Gurage, of which those from Tiya as described by Joussaume are investigated best (1995). Striking here is the representation of rows of swords, which are obviously based on the same idea as in Konso, adding groups of trophies for killings in order to enhance the heroic nature of the ancestor. As regards the interpretation of the prehistoric round sculptures in the same area, which often appear in publications as "phallic stelae" - a nonsensical term springing from the Western imagination -, our conclusions must remain hypothetical.42 The lines on the bodies of these anthropomorphic stelae are obviously tattoos or scarifications. On the basis of comparative investigations with recent cultures, Hel mut Straube (1964) became convinced that they were "killer markings", to which the motifs of the semicircle, the circle dot and the bird s wing belong. In this case it is especially the bird which as a representation of the soul forms a link with the ancestors. Joussaume has dated the stele complex that he investigated in Tiya to the 11th ? 13th centuries.43 Using this date as a basis, we can assume - even if no continuous 42 Archeological investigations by Anfray 1982; 1990. 43 Joussaume 1995: 163f.; Metasebia Bekele 1997: 370.</page><page sequence="24">100 Zeitschrift fur Ethnologie 127 (2002) historical relationship between the examples mentioned can yet be proven ? that the notions of life, death, conception, and solidarity of the living with both the ancestors and future generations, which also found aesthetic expression in the ensembles of the Konso, were developed over the course of 900 years in the area of southern Ethiopia under consideration here.44 Zusammenfassung. Geschnitzte figiirliche Stelen, wie wir sie im sudathiopischen Konso finden, sind im ostlichen Afrika eine Seltenheit. Im Zentrum der vodiegenden Betrachtung steht ihre kulturelle Bedeu tung, daneben wird ihre Stellung in einem groEeren geographischen Bezugsrahmen sowie ihre zeitliche Tiefe bis hin zu den jungsten Veranderungen diskutiert. Wenn nachvollziehbar wird, dass die behandel ten Phanomene keine Ausnahmeerscheinung sind, wissen wir damit etwas mehr iiber grundlegende Struk turen religiosen Denkens im ostlichen Afrika. Bekannt ist, dass die Konsostelen Erinnerungsmale fur bestimmte herausragende zu Ahnen gewordene Verstorbene sind. Die Stelen verlangen von den Konso Beachtung, doch finden sie keine Verehrung. Es sind Kultbilder, dennoch sind sie untrennbar mit den spirituellen Vorstellungen und dem Ethos der Konso verbunden. 44 The setting up of the first stone in Konso in connection with the gada system was calculated by Hallpike (1972:192) to have taken place in the first decade of the 17th century, on the basis of their rotational erection.
