<plain_text><page sequence="1">WEST AFRICAN MUD GRANARIES1 By LABELLE PRUSSIN Antaeus, the son of Terra the Earth, was a mighty giant and wrestler whose strength was invincible so long as he remained in contact with his mother Earth . . . Hercules encountered him, and finding that it was of no avail to throw him, for he always rose with renewed strength from every fall, he lifted him up from the earth and strangled him in the air2. Man's attempt to define the nature of architectural quality derives from his philosophic stance: from the way he chooses to see himself in relation to the universe around him. Indigenous aesthetic judgments in turn, reflect an assessment of the extent to which, as an antagonist, he is able to harness and control the material world around him and the elegance with which this is done. Definitions of structural and tectonic expression suggested by Seklar (1965) are precisely such an attempt to define this relationship be- tween the ideational and the empirical3. Studies of African architecture in the past have chosen to focus on one to the exlcusion or slighting of the other4. It is my intent to examine both as they relate to a particular architectural form, the granary. Rather than treat the ideal and the real, the sacred and the profane as antagonisms, or as mutually exclusive to each other, it is my intent to seek out those congruities which, in merging, create a unity between the "almost per- fect realization of a structural principle" and an "unequivocal tectonic expression" (Seklar, op. cit. p. 94). It is at the point where aesthetics and technology become one that we may speak of great architecture in Africa. In effect then, this study proposes to methodologically bridge functional explanation, the language of use and technology, with formal analysis, the language of art history and aesthetics. In a broad sense, it pro- poses to bridge the sacred and the profane. It is my hypothesis that those facilities which a society recognizes, consciously or unconsciously, as being essential to its existence, will be imbued with the greatest mean- 1 This paper was originally presented to a Conference on Traditional African Architecture held in September 1970 under the sponsorship of the Social Science Research Council, and is expected to appear shortly in a collec- tion edited by Robert Farris Thompson for the Yale University Press. Drawings were genereously made by Mrs. Wittner, Frobenius-Institut, Frankfurt M. All photographs are from the author's collection. 2 The tomb of Antaeus, according to tradition, is near Tingis in Mauretania (Seyffert, 1956, p. 34). Thus, the myth of Antaeus is doubly appropriate to a consideration of African architecture, for not only was he buried in African soil, but the myth coincides perfectly with African belief: the Earth is a lifegiving and life-sustaining force. 3 Sekler (1965, p. 89) suggests that "structure" refers to an ordered arrangement of constituent parts result- ing from, or replying to, forces at work. The term tectonic is reserved for the expressive qualities which are the visual result of such an arrangement, but cannot be described in terms of construction and structure alone. 4 Most ethnographic accounts speak only of building technology, as may be expected from Notes and Queries on Anthropology, a British manual on the methodology of social anthropological fieldwork. No where does the term architecture even appear. Griaule on the other hand (1965) has chosen to ignore completely the technology of Dogon building forms in his discucssion of the cosmological implications of their residences.</page><page sequence="2">WEST AFRICAN MUD GRANARIES 145 ing5. As such, they will be endowed with the most elaborate craftsmanship. The highest skills available to the society will be brought to bear in their creation. Meaningfulness, expressing itself through the artistic media, combines with the limits of technological potential to create the aesthetic values of a given culture6. It is those facilities which can become the bearers of a culture's aesthetic. Such is the case with some West African granaries. The correlate to the above-stated hypothesis is that there is also a relationship between the aesthetic level of a particular granary and those features of a socio-economic system which are essential to its wellbeing. In other words, by isolating and ranking those ele- ments in a society which are crucial to its continuity, it should be possible to establish a series of aesthetic levels for assessing the West African granary form. The vast West African savannah, with its mosaic of randomly scattered building types, is punctuated with two tectonically perfect forms : the mosque and the granary (PL I, 1, 2). The mosque, a cluster of pyramidal buttresses, rises vertically above the urban landscape, whereas the granary, rounded and swelling, lies low, fully indulging the pull of the earth. Initially, one might conclude that the mosque embodies the sacred, the granary the profane. Yet, each can become its opposite: the mosque a material ex- pression of spirituality, the granary a spiritual expression of material wellbeing. Conse- quently, one discovers aesthetic drive devoted to both traditions. Yet, in each instance, aesthetic drive is phrased differently. The nature of each form derives from the different techniques used in handling the same basic building material: mud. The mosque is built in sun-dried brick, the granary in wet - or puddled - mud7. This distinction is fundamental and controls the conception as well as the development of the form itself. The granary is, first and foremost, a storage container for grain. Since cereal grains in bulk generally behave according to hydraulic laws, the function of a granary closely approximates that of a water container. Hence, one may assume that the form, as well as the techniques employed in creating the form, would be similar in both instances8. Such is indeed the case. But grain storage presupposes longterm storage; hence gran- 5 A facility is defined as a material measure or feature which is critical to the maintenance of a socio-cultural system, which permits a society to exploit its environment and to sustain itself. Granaries, fishing canoes or hydro- electric dams are all facilities. 6 Technological perfection is relative to the potential for the exploitation of resources at a given historical period. As an example, the Bororo of South America build a suspension bridge using lianes or vines, but the span and scale of the bridge is extremely limited. The Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco uses the same struc- tural principle, but because it makes use of steel cables, a much longer span is possible. 7 There has been much confusion in designating the techniques of building in mud. For our purposes, we distinguish them as follows : The term wet-mud is equivalent to the French term banco, itself a borrowing from the Bambara term (Brasseur, 1968, p. 72), and designates the process of building up a wall by using wet balls of mud, spiral fashion. Sun-dried brick, either hand-molded or molded in a wooden form, is equated to the French term touby etymologically derived from the Arabic ottub (Adam, 1951, pp. 26-7). The tetmpise from the Latin pisare, which has been used by French writers to describe one or another of the above mentioned techni- ques, describes a North African building process, in which the mud is tamped into sliding wood coffers, not un- like our use of shuttering for reinforced concrete. 8 Similar solutions for the storage of liquid and cereals are illustrated by the equivalent forms used for oil tanks, water tanks and grain silos. 10 Paidcuma</page><page sequence="3">146 LABELLE PRUSSIN aries must have a larger capacity. The comparison in technique and choice of material then, suggests a continuum in magnitude, as well. Such a continuum is well illustrated by the large clay pots used to brew millet beer, in which cereals are fermented into a liquid9 (PL III, 6). The making of both a water and a grain container involves some variant of a coil technique. This technique, often but not always associated with pottery in West Africa, is also widely used in an architectural context. The wetmud technology mentioned previously involves essentially the same spiral procedure in which clay is continually added to achieve the required volume. Hence, the same principles of structural creativ- ity apply not only to smaller water containers and larger grain containers, but to the curvilinear walls of roundhouse construction (Fig. I)10. Fig. 1. Interior walls, Tallensi compound, Tongo, northern Ghana (converted from photo). Although the structural principles may be similar, the skills and technology brought to bear in the construction of compound walls contrasts sharply with those demanded in the creation of granary walls. The compound residence of necessity requires flexi- bility to accomodate the constantly changing needs of its residents. Imbued with neither 9 The perfectly formed spherical Senufo granaries from Nassian, Ivory Coast, might even be considered as a further extension of the suggested continuum. (PL I, 2). 10 Although tangential to our present concern, it is interesting to note that the use of a coil technique in wet- mud for granary construction travels hand-in-hand generally, but not exclusively with roundhouse construction in the savannah. The abrupt change can be seen clearly in Ghana where the Black Volta, flowing west to east, forms a boundary for the existence of mud granaries as well as for roundhouse forms.</page><page sequence="4">WEST AFRICAN MUD GRANARIES 147 permanence nor long-term durability, the compound among many West African peoples assumes an ephemeral, transient quality. Upon the death of the compound owner and the subsequent dispersal of the viable family unit, the compound structure is allowed to crumble back to earth. Like land tenure, non-occupancy is meaningless and leads to neglect and deterioration. As a result, the residential building complex as a whole is rarely assigned a sacred meaning11. Only specific elements within it do. The granary on the other hand, stands out by its embodiment of potter-like skills, by the more selective use of materials which contribute to its permanence and smooth- ness and by a refinement of the form itself. The walls of the mud granary incorporate elements which are designed to endow it with greater durability, such as straw, kaolin or lime. Soils with a higher clay content are selectively chosen for its creation (PI. II, 3) 12. The successful functioning of a granary, i. e. the storage of life-sustaining contents, is truly vital, and its structural failure forebodes the doom of the family unit. As in other art forms where usage is a scritical factor, there is little room for mediocrity in structural design or its execution13. The range of formal variation is more limited than in other art forms, yet it is precisely this limitation which in turn becomes a challenge for the West African builder. The focus of the study is narrowly circumscribed to the savannah land of northern Ghana, Togoland, Dahomey and the Ivory Coast, an area inhabited by the Dagomba, the Mossi, the Konkomba, the Lobi, the Tallensi and the Somba (Fig. 2). With the exception of the Lobi and the Somba, these ethnic groups are contiguous. All have a common life-style generated by a savannah sedentarism, but the elements which com- prise the life-style vary in importance from group to group14. The savannah vegetation zone ranges from a grassland in the northern reaches to occasional woodland growth in the south. The two major staples grown in the area are sorghum (giant millet or guinea corn) and pearl millet. Pearl millet grows more satisfactorily in the northern reaches and sorghum, generally the most important West African cereal crop, is preferentially grown in the southern savannah. The alternating wet and dry season dictates a single annual planting cycle15. Millet and sorghum, as the basis of a subsistence agricultural economy, are essential to the maintenance of life 11 The cosmologic interpretation suggested by Zahan (1950) for instance, is based on meaning assigned to specific elements within the residential complex, whereas Griaule (1965, p. 97) suggests that a Dogon complex as a whole represents a man lying on his side. 12 The plastic quality of wet clay as well as its hardness when sun-baked or kiln-fired derives from the particles of hydrous aluminum silicates present in the soil structure. 13 The same observation may equally be made in considering the canoe or paddle among people whose basic subsistence activity is fishing, the basket among people who depend greatly on gathering, the spear among hun- ters, or the animal trappings so essential to a nomadic people. 14 The life-style of these peoples, all part of the Voltaic subfamily of the Nigritic linguistic stock, is described by Murdock (1959, pp. 77-88). 16 The rainfall, decreasing from 60-20" as one moves north, occurs during a single, five-month wet season. Since pearl millet requires less annual rainfall than sorghum (it can be grown in areas having as little as 11-16" of rainfall), it is more commonly grown in the northern reaches. Millet also benefits from the greater diurnal tem- perature variation which occurs in the upper savannah. Although rice and maize are grown to some extent in areas of 30-60" of rainfall, or near rivers where flooding eliminates the need for artifical irrigation, they are secondary crops. See Church, 1960, pp. 21-163. 10*</page><page sequence="5">148 LABELLE PRUSSIN SON/NKE T} MAStNA ^ r^~***~\ \ U°ALAM \\.

Hence, for our purposes of storage, their need is basically a con- tainer for sorghum and/or millet which can accomodate an annual crop. And indeed, it is precisely in this area that clay granaries abound. Pearl millet is a much smaller grain than sorghum. When it is threshed, pearl millet in bulk more closely resembles the action of a liquid than does sorghum. An analogy which clearly illustrates this difference is that of sand and pebbles. Hence from a purely functional point of view, it would be reasonable to expect that granaries in the northern savannah would more closely approximate large pottery water containers, whereas those further south would not adhere as rigidly to an ideal for water storage16. 16 The suggested parallel is not intended to negate or even overlook the question of culturally determined aesthetic choice, but merely to call attention to an objectively imposed structural principle. Some illustrations which support the suggested parallel are the Songhai millet granaries reported by Desplagnes (1907, p. 368) the reference by Tauxier (1912, p. 520) to millet granaries which look like "enormous ink bottles" in the northern part of Mossi territory, and to the Senufo granaries (PI. I, 2, Fig. 2) photographed near the Mali border.</page><page sequence="6">SOME NOTES ON MANO BELIEFS 149 As one moves south from the grain-growing belt to the rainforest, rice and maize appear as important cereal crops, but they are, in fact, secondary to the cultivation of tubers. Rice and maize are stored in basket-type granaries or on the ear and tubers call for quite another type of storage17. Yams, a tuber staple, are harvested twice a year and can be preserved for only four to six months. As a consequence, storage time is not as critical a factor as it is for cereal crops. In addition, the storage of yams entails different structural requirements. In contrast to the fluid quality of grain in bulk, yams are dead weight, i. e. they can be stacked; they do not need to be contained. Thus, clay granaries tend to disappear as one moves into the rainforest. Another factor which should be considered is the relative humidity of the savannah in contrast to the rainforest. Not only does the greater rainforest humidity preclude the creation and maintenance of a usable mud container without firing, but mud walls themselves retain moisture. Dry rot and early germination would cause deterioration of the contents. Hence, ecology not only delimits geographic distribution of the mud granary but prescribes to some extent, its functional and formal limitations. In addition to the role played by ecological adaptation, it is also important to consider the extent to which crops constitute subsistence in the local economy. The economic levels which appear applicable to the area under concern are as follows : I. Non-monetary trading which applies to peoples with regular regional markets and/or caravan trade, using a medium of exchange mainly other than money, or engaged in large-scale barter. II. Monetary trading which occurs where money is used as a general medium of ex- change, although other trade media may co-exist. III. Cash cropping which entails the growth of specific staple crops for cash return and large-scale export18. Although all these levels are present, they are present in varying importance. The mean- ing attached to a particular storage facility, as well as its spatial disposition in the com- pound complex, will in turn reflect their relative importance. These levels are one of the keys in assessing the depth of cosmologic significance assigned to the granary. Non-monetary and monetary trading prevail among the Lobi, Tallensi and the Somba, taking the form of regional and local markets operating in three or five day cycles. Large-scale barter still persists at a local level. The cultivation of pearl millet and sor- ghum is almost exclusively for subsistence. Cattle-herding performs no economic func- tion; its role is primarily in reinforcing the social structure, such as bridewealth or for sacrifice at prescribed socio-religious rituals. If tuber crops are cultivated, they are sup- plemantary to the cereal staples, and no special accomodation is provided for them. It 17 The storage of rice par excellence is described by Thomas (1964) in his discussion of the Diola habitat, where basket-type granaries are incorporated into the attics of the compound complexes. Gallais (1967, p. 291), in his discussion of Bambara granaries, specifically distinguishes the mat-type granaries used for storing rice from the 'classical' clay millet granary. Coulibaly (1961), in his discussion of Senufo agricultural practices, illustrates the storage of rice on wooden platforms raised two or three feet above the ground. 18 These economic levels are part of the full range of economic activities found among the peoples of Africa suggested by Reader (1964, p. 29). His detailed exposition includes Subsistence, Non-monetary trading, Mone- tary trading, Cashcropping, Migrant labor and Industrial labor.</page><page sequence="7">150 LABELLE PRUSSIN is among these peoples that the granary emerges with the highest sophistication and technological skill. Monetary trading and cash-cropping are more prevalent among the Dagomba, the Mossi and the Konkomba. Not only does monetary trading exist among the Dagomba, but yam comprises the major crop in their subsistence pattern, serving on occasion as a cash crop. In addition, tobacco is grown as a cash crop and cattle serve an economic function19. The Mossi, among whom pearl millet is a staple crop, have historically been involved with the cross-savannah trade routes, and their economy is heavily oriented towards monetary trade based on cattleherding. To the best of my knowledge, clay granaries are non-existent in Dagombaland, and their presence in Mossiland, despite the cultivation of millet, is precarious and haphazard. In other words, the emphasis is on exchange, rather than storage. It seems fairly safe to generalize, in fact, that peoples in close contact or intimately involved with the centuries-old trans-savannah trading routes have a less articulated system of storage facilities than peoples like the Tallensi, the Lobi and the Somba whom such routes bypassed. The role of economy in explaining the presence and perfection of the granary is clearly illustrated in Konkombaland. Although millet and sorghum are traditional subsistence crops, there has been a marked increase in yam cash-cropping in recent years, accompa- nied by a gradual exodus to the more favorable southern yam-growing climate. As a consequence, it is only in northern Konkombaland, where cereal cultivation continues to be of primary importance, that the striking Konkomba granaries can still be found. Jurisdiction over crops is another factor bearing on the presence and spatial dispo- sition of granaries. The ownership of the harvested crop (implying rights over its distribution) corresponding to the prevailing pattern of social organization, will deter- mine the location of the granary. Among the LoWilisi (Lobi), whose social structure is characterized by matrilineal descent and inheritance, the granaries are sited out in the open fields rather than within the compound walls20. This is perhaps so because the residence pattern is patrilocal and the compound complex itself is under the jurisdiction of the senior male. The Dagomba and Konkomba, where patrilineal inheritance and patrilocal residence are the rule, illustrate the point further. Groundnuts, planted on horticultural plots adjacent to the compound are cultivated by, and belong exclusively to, the women in the family group. Although groundnuts may be used in the cuisine, they are not crucial to the family's sustenance and are often sold or bartered in the mar- ket. The basket-like (and not clay) groundnut granaries belong to the women and are always located outside the compound walls, thus expressing the secondary and less meaningful role in the family's viability. The technological skill brought to bear in granary construction is also critical to our study. As previously noted, mud granaries are all created by using a wet-mud technique which closely resembles the creation of a basic mode of African pottery itself, and has 19 The specialized butcher's role in Dagombaland is a highly profitable and prestigious one. 20 Another striking example of the field location of granaries can be found among the Senufo as illustrated by those from Nassian in the northern Ivory Coast. Like the LoWilisi (Lobi), the Senufo are a matrilineal society, and the stark, precisely shaped spherical forms of their granaries, standing alone in the fields, contrast sharply with the desolate setting of the blazing dryness. (Fig. 2).</page><page sequence="8">SOME NOTES ON MANO BELIEFS 151 traditionally been used for compound wall construction. It is important to note however, that although a pottery technique is used, in no instance is it the potters who build the granaries21. Among the Mossi and Dagomba however, this wet-mud technique is grad- ually being replaced by mud-brick construction. Although the introduction and adop- tion of a mud-brick building technology are outside the purview of this discussion, it is relevant to note that there appears to be a marked correlation between the presence and sophistication of granaries and the continued practice of a wet-mud coil technique for compound walls. In other words, the skills which are in common use are more easily transferred to and perfected for specialized structures such as the granary. Such appears to be the case for the Tallensi, the Konkomba, the Lobi and the Somba. The introduction of, and receptivity to mud masonry among the Mossi and Dagomba on the other hand, has led to a declining mastery of the wet-mud techniques. This deterio- ration would in turn affect the quality of technological perfection in granary construc- tion. The same pattern of decline may also be observed in urban centers scattered amongst rural populations, where not only is commerce a more important economic cate- gory, but where urbanization itself is accompanied by a preference for rectangular housing forms. It is also of interest to note that the coil technique is most highly per- fected and more universal in those cultures which claim autochthony, that is among peoples who have no traditions of migration or incursion into the areas they currently inhabit. Claims of autochthony also correspond closely with the extent to which social and political relationships are sanctioned by a cosmology rooted in the deification of the Earth. All the peoples we are considering view the Earth as a lifegiving, life-sustaining force, and among aJl of them land tenure as well as the fruits of the soil relate in some way to an Earth Cult. But where political authority has been secularized to any extent, the belief in the life-giving and life-sustaining efficacy of the Earth has also been weak- ened. Thus, it is in the granaries of those peoples whose socio-political relationships are most strongly validated by Earth ritual, that one finds the richest cosmologic assign- ment, symbolism and interpretation. It was suggested earlier that the process of aesthetic creation emerges in the granary when the sacred or conceptual meaning assigned to the form merges with supreme mastery of execution to produce a form which corresponds wholly and most adequately to its function22. The foregoing discussion also suggested that there are levels of aesthet- ic creativity whose values or qualities might be hierarchically ranked. Such levels would be determined by the extent to which the three aspects of meaning, mastery and usage successfully merge. In order to assess qualitative level, the granaries among each of the peoples concerned will be considered in detail. 21 Tauxier (1912, p. 521) specifically points out that the"baouref huge jars where the threshed millet is stored . . . in the northern part of Mossi territory, are not made by the potters. They are built in each compound by the inhabitants". The distinction is apparently a reflection of the more general differentiation between the sexes in which it is usually the women who are the potters and the men who build the compound walls. 22 This formulation closely follows that of Levi-Strauss (1968, p. 27) who notes that the process of artistic creation consists of three elements : communication with the model (conceptual meaning), with the materials (mastery of execution), and with the future user (function).</page><page sequence="9">152 LABELLE PRUSSIN Dagomba Dagombaland, the first of our examples, has no kind of mud granary at all. It might then be viewed as a control, since it would represent zero on our scale of qualitative value. Although it can be assumed that because yam consitutes the subsistence crop there would be no reason for a long-term storage facility, there are a number of addi- tional factors which help to explain the non-existence of mud granaries23. Dagomba history is one of incursion and migration into the present area, during which the indigenous system of land tenure was weakened by the development of a secular political organization. Verbal traditions which recall the slaying of Earth priests by invading Dagomba cavalry suggest a process of severe curtailment of the Earth's sanctions. The increasing influence of Islam further served to weaken the indigenous cosmology so that today there appears to be an almost complete absence of visual evi- dence suggesting a symbolism associated with the Earth or its products. Although the Dagomba (as well as their relatives and neighbors, the Mamprussi), do not build or use mud granaries, they are nevertheless master potters. The giant pots used in brewing millet beer illustrate the intermediate link (PL III, 6), previously refer- red to, between a small water container and its counterpart elsewhere, the large grain container. These pito pots are indeed transitional, inasmuch as the fermentation process which takes place in them involves the conversion of solids to a liquid. The ancient trans-savannah trade routes which cut through Dagombaland encouraged the growth of cash-cropping as well as a receptivity to the use of sun dried brick. Life's sustenance no longer depended solely on staple cereal crops ; trade and Islam filled the vacuum of meaningful storage with its emphasis on material values. As a consequence, the major architectural expression among the Dagomba may be found in the highly decorated, ornate doorways whose purpose, it is claimed, is to communicate the prestige and material wealth of the compound elder to the passing observer (PL II, 4). The sur- rounds of these doorways, cut into the mud wall after it has been completed, are care- fully rendered with a more durable clay and shells or broken crockery are set into them. Thus, it is not the granary which carries aesthetic significance among the Dagomba, but the compound portal. Mossi The Mossi, closely associated to the Dagomba both linguistically and politically, live north of them, in an area where millet is the crop par excellence. In contrast to the Dagomba, millet does indeed form the basis of Mossi diet (Dubourg, 1957, p. 300). Yet despite the fact that millet is their staple diet, Mossi mud granaries are of rather meagre aesthetic quality (Fig. 3). There are two types: a smaller round clay jar whose walls taper in to form a narrow opening at the top, and a larger square based granary with flat vertical walls, one of which is pierced by a small, high window (Hammond, 23 The basket-type granaries previously referred to are neither permanent nor durable and no meaningful value appears to be attached to them beyond that of personal property and serviceability.</page><page sequence="10">WEST AFRICAN MUD GRANARIES 153 1966, pp. 38-40) 24. As among the Dagomba, reasons for the absence of aesthetic quality are not difficult to ascertain. It is well established that the Mossi migrated northwards from Dagomba and Mam- prussi country some centuries back. Their ultimate political allegiance still lies at Nale- rigu, the Mamprussi capital in the heart of the Gambaga highlands of Ghana (Fage, 1964, pp. 182-4). Coming out of a southern area which appears to have no tradition of granary construction, i. e. Dagombaland, it seems logical to assume that the Mossi granary building tradition would be weak and shallow. Fig. 3. Mossi granaries, Hammond, 1966, p. 39 (converted from photo). Compounds are patrician residences whose core is the household and courtyard of the lineage elder, surrounded by his wives' rooms (Fig. 4). Distributed around the core but within the mat walls circumscribing the complex, are the housing clusters of his younger brothers and his sons. The two types of granaries appear to be indiscriminately scattered through the compound courtyard, and neither their form nor location suggest any preferential disposition. It has been suggested that the smaller earthen jars are used to store threshed millet and the larger square-based ones to store unthreshed millet. (Hammond, op. cit.) Those granaries containing communally cultivated and harvested grain are under the jurisdiction of the patrician elder25. In addition, each household 24 It should be pointed out that Hammond's description of two types of granaries is inconsistent with his photograph. The illustration suggests three different forms as follows: first, a conical pillar, second a square based prism and third, a spherical form. No explanation is given for the barely discernable nodules on the sphe- rical granary. 25 Communal cultivation refers to cultivation and harvesting which involves participation by all members of the patrician.</page><page sequence="11">154 LABELLE PRUSSIN head has separate granaries which house the crops from his own fields. The available literature offers no data which suggest any formal distinction between granaries belong- ing to the patrician elder and those belonging to the separate households within the patrician. It is possible to surmise however, thac the two different shapes, one rounded and the other square, may have evolved in response to the different ways in which threshed and unthreshed millet behave in space. Earlier reports suggest that the unthreshed pearl millet is kept in small straw basket- type granaries mounted on a stake frame (Tauxier, 1912, p. 16, p. 56). These stand in a long curved line encircling the compound (PL III, 7). In addition to these and to the large clay granaries belonging to the cultivating groups, Tauxier also commented on the large earthen jars, made by and belonging to the women, in which the husband stores the harvest from his household fields. These last are found, not in the courtyard, but in the wives' rooms. At any rate, although the reports on granary usage appear to be some- what contradictory, it is evident that ample facilities for millet storage do exist. How- ever, it is also apparent from their rather low aesthetic quality that they are neither of prime importance, nor do they assume great symbolic meaning in the life of the Mossi. The decreasing importance of Earth sanctions may be one of the factors explaining the absence of aesthetic quality. Weakening of ritual is manifested not only by the ab- sence of correspondences between religious and political jurisdiction, but also by actual conflict between the Earth priests and political authorities (Hammond, op. cit. p. 170). Such dichotomy would be reflected in a weakening of the cosmologic role assigned to the Earth's fertility and is indeed seen in the subordinate and auxiliary position of Ki Wende, the life force of the millet26. The weakening of conceptual ties with the Earth can also be attributed to the histor- ical significance of trade and markets among the Mossi27. Cotton and indigo, crops hav- ing the greatest market value, are grown extensively (Skinner, 1962, p. 238). Cattle, horses and donkeys are herded for their commodity value28. Hence, although millet is a staple crop and requires storage, it is not as important in the Mossi subsistence pattern as it is among those peoples who were bypassed by the trading routes. Contact through trade with the Islamized north may also account for the fact that wet- wall construction techniques are no longer as strongly embedded in the Mossi reper- 26 Mossi believe that all aspects of their environment were created by the supreme being Wende, and are ani- mated by his force nam. The specific manifestations of his power are differentiated into particular environmental aspects with which they are identified. For example, Tenga Wende is the earthly manifestation, Tido Wende is the vegetal manifestation and Saga Wende is that aspect of the deity from which the rains come. Ki Wende, the source of life in the millet fields, is a further differentiation of Tido Wende (Hammond, 1966, pp. 163-71). The Mossi earth priests, Tenga Soba Namba, are clearly distinct from the Bogaba, the priests through whom Tido Wende is worshipped. It is these latter who perform the main role in the observation of the Mossi harvest, not the earth priests. However, that an association between the earth's fertility (the harvest) and a woman's fertility still persists is evident from the prevailing belief that the Bogaba can assist barren women in becoming fertile. 27 Dupuis, Bowdich, Barth andBiNGER, 19th century visitors to West Africa, all commented on Mossi trad- ing activities. 28 Skinner, (op. cit.) quoting Lt. Marc, a French administrator and ethnographer, suggests that between 1904 and 1905, 16.000 head of cattle and 75.000 sheep and goats passed through the customs post between Upper Volta (then the French Soudan) and Ghana (then the Northern Territories of the Gold Coast). Even today, almost all available meat in southern Ghana is driven down on the hoof from Upper Volta and Mali.</page><page sequence="12">WEST AFRICAN MUD GRANARIES 155 toire of skills. The preference for rectangular, mud brick construction can be seen in every Mossi patrician complex (Fig. 4), where at least the clan elder, and frequently his older sons, live not in roundhouses but in rectangular houses built of mud bricks. © O® , - p © \ i (29) !

The Mossi prestige attached to residential building units is not unlike the Dagomba emphasis on doorway design as a testimony of man's material wealth, and indeed the Mossi do attach great symbolic value not only to the total complex but to the dwelling door in particular. Among the Dagomba it is the entrance frame which carries the artistic genius and the indication of material wellbeing; among the Mossi the door and its lock, metaphysically associated with procreation, sustain the Mossi aesthetic29. The greater cosmologic emphasis on the entrance opening (in preference to an em- phasis on either the Earth itself or the granaries associated with the earth's fertility) is reinforced by a myth of origin of the Tenga Soba Naba, priests of the earth. They trace their origin to an ancestor who descended from the sky into a house without a door. 29 Zahan (1950, pp. 227-28) suggests that every door closure indicates, in the domestic plan, the sexual union of man and woman, and at the cosmic level, the union of male and female, because at the moment when the door is closed, the bolt (the male phallus) is engaged in the jamb plate (literally, the vagina of the lock). Neither the greater emphasis on entrance design, nor its sexual symbolism, is limited to the Dagomba-Mossi culture, as is illustrated by the elaborate tracery on Walata doorways and the equally elaborate incised carving of the Mousgoum interiors.</page><page sequence="13">156 LABELLE PRUSSIN Only when an opening was cut into the house was the ancestral priest revealed with the accoutrements of his office (Hammond, 1966, p. 168; Zahan, 1961, p. 13)30. The reve- lation suggests the beginning of a spiritual awareness and by the same token an archi- tectural consciousness significantly vested not in the granary, but in a doorway. Thus, among the Mossi, it is the portal and not the granary which serves as the critical link between the sacred realm within and the realm of the profane without. Konkomba The Konkomba are northeastern neighbors of the Dagomba and for centuries their history has been interwoven with the latter group. Among other features which they share is an architectural tradition of roundhouse construction and compound arrangement. However, in contrast to the Dagomba, the Konkomba include the creation of magnificent tripoidal and quadrupedal granaries in their architectural reper- toire. First, the granary's aesthetic quality derives from the way it stands alone and inde- pendent at the entrance to the lineage elder's reception antechamber (Fig. 5). Sheer magnitude and perfect symmetry bear witness to the superb technological skills applied in its creation and to confident and complete control of the means to satisfy the canons of Konkomba beauty. Konkomba command much greater skill in erecting wet-mud compound walls. Finished surfaces are more even, more polished and smoother than those of their Da- gomba or Mossi neighbors. Only at this level of technological perfection is it possible to achieve the perfect proportion and magnificent volume evidenced in the Konkomba granary. Thinness of shell is only possible when the narrow mud coils are most precisely laid, and when the ingredients are carefully selected and mixed in exact proportions. In this instance, lime ground from the shells gathered on the banks of the Oti River is added as an indigenous cement or binding agent. A conscious recognition of hydraulic behavior places the granary supports precisely along the axis of gravity. The weight of the grain is distributed within the container into three or four compartments and the three or four legs mark the point of concen- trated load (Fig. 6). These legs are molded into the granary surface itself visually suggest- ing the arteries through which the Earth's force is transmitted. The basic Konkomba foods are millet and yams, but yams also constitute a surplus cash crop31. Although yams are the basis of nourishment for part of the year, they are more perishable and it is the millet which becomes a critical food source as the year wears on into the dry season. During the first months of the new, wet season when the greatest expenditure of effort is required for planting and early cultivation, it is the millet which is the source of energy for the Konkomba farmers. 30 The tall red felt tarboosh, included in the accoutrements of the earth priest's office is of North African origin, hinting at a possible Islamic influence. •" JhROEHLiCH (1954, p. 57) notes that even in northern Konkomba country, traditionally a millet growing area, great quantities of yam are grown and sold to the Chokossi who grow none themselves.</page><page sequence="14">WEST AFRICAN MUD GRANARIES 157 Each family, comprising a lineage, consists of an elder, his younger brothers, his sons, their wives and children, resident in a hamlet. This hamlet, sometimes consisting of several such lineages, is equivalent to the Mossi patrician residence. In contrast to the Mossi compound which is clearly circumscribed within a set of walls, the Konkomba lineage extends over a much greater area.

LoDagaba granary, northern Ghana, Rattray, 1932, Fig. 122 (converted from photo). Communal farming practices follow a pattern similar to that of the Mossi. However, instead of the group of smaller granaries under the jurisdiction of the Mossi patrician elder, the Konkomba combine these into one major communal granary, again under the jurisdiction of the lineage elder. Hence, there are only as many such major grana- ries in a hamlet as there are lineages. Each family unit has, in addition, its own small granaries, hidden from view within the compound rooms. The contents of the communal</page><page sequence="15">158 LABELLE PRUSSIN granary are used to cover all expenses of general interest to the lineage. It thus symbolizes, in a single artistic statement, the unity and wellbeing of the lineage32. The sitings of the Konkomba communal granary contrasts sharply with those of the Mossi, suggesting greater architectural consciousness as well as a new spatial percep- tiveness. As previously noted, the Mossi communal granaries are enclosed within the walls of the patrician compound, walls which appear to circumscribe the spatial juris- diction of the elder. The Konkomba granary, standing majestically at the entrance to the lineage elder's residence, commands the whole geography of the hamlet, at the same time establishing a unity with the most important entrance in the hamlet. The correspondence between the communal granary and the lineage elder's entrance parallels, and is perhaps explained by, the corresponding relationship between the lineage elder as a political head and the Owner of the Earth, the spiritual head of the religious unit of jurisdiction. This dual structure, in which the conceptual realm parallels that of the material realm, is not unlike the Mossi division between political and religious organization. Among the Konkomba however, the two systems are more closely inter- woven, and it is precisely this closer correspondence which not only brings granary and entrance together in space, but conceptually unites them. In other words, the entrance is in essence symbolic of the unity of the family and this is where the compound elder has jurisdiction. The granary on the other hand is under the jurisdiction of the head of the Cult of the Earth, and hence is symbolic of the Earth's fertility. The two stand in close proximity to each other. The religious unit of jurisdiction is geographically delimited in reality, but in Kon- komba mythology this same area is also viewed as the wife of Uumbwar, the most dis- tant of forefathers who "created man and woman and placed them on the earth". Uumbwar's wife is also viewed as "the life and fertility of the hamlet"; hence many precautions must be taken when a new communal granary is built, to ensure continued life and fertility (Froehlich, 1954, pp. 220-21). First, a chicken is sacrificed in calling upon Uumbwar and the ancestors. Then, the belly of the granary is sprinkled with the chicken's blood and the feathers are stuck in the blood to insure that the seed will be good seed. The importance of a libation in blood derives from the Konkomba belief that blood (fero), is synonymous with force (Froehlich, op. cit. p. 226). Konkomba say that "it is the blood which forms the man". Thus when the blood of the chicken is ritually applied to the walls of the granary, the act conceptually implies the creation of a human and the granary is invested with a life force. Then, large red bands, as 'medicine' are traced on the granary walls to protect the seed against those who are able to eat the 'substance of the grain'. A similar procedure is also followed on the day of sacrifice in honor of twins. On that day, a black powder is prepared and kneaded with karite butter into a paste. The paste is used to paint black crosses on the granary to insure that the seed will be fruitful. In these two rites, the analogy which is suggested is that the granary, having been imbued with life, is then 32 Communal storage in a single container is not unique to the Konkomba. Wherever it is common practice, it results in granaries equally spectacular in size, as may be seen in examples from both Dyerma and Songhai communities (Fig. 7).</page><page sequence="16">WEST AFRICAN MUD GRANARIES 159 periodically anointed with protective medicines, and indeed, similar protective rites are performed after both the yam and millet harvests. Lobi On the broad plain formed by the Black Volta, live a group of culturally related peo- ples including, among others, the LoWilisi and the LoDagaba (Labouret, 1 931 ; Rattray 1932), traditionally grouped together under the generic name Lobi. More recent studies have differentiated these groups into two distinct clusters, those speaking Dogon-related dialects such as the LoWilisi, and those speaking Mole-related dialects, such as the LoDagaba33. The transition from Dogon-speaking peoples in the west to Mole-speaking peoples in the east is accompanied by a transition from matrilineal to patrilineal de- scent as well. In other words, among the LoWilisi in the west, wealth and property are passed on along the matrilineage and among the LoDagaba, an easterly cluster, wealth is inherited patrilineally. Cultural differences are further emphasized by a range of granary forms from west to east terminating at each end of the continuum in a dis- tinct prototype. Between the two termini, gradual changes transform one into the other. Far in the west, the LoWilisi granaries (neighbors to the aforementioned Senufo) stand isolated and alone, silhouetted against Earth and Sky, in the midst of cultivated fields (PL III, 8). As one approaches, it becomes clear that the granary is not in the form of a spherical pot, but is rather an elongated mud cube whose four sides rise from a square base and clearly meet at the corners. The intersections are sometimes further em- phasized by a suggestion of corner buttressing, structurally necessary to effect a con- tinuity between the faces (PL III, 9). Female attributes, breasts, vulva, face, representing the essence of womanhood, clearly express the metaphysical association between the granary form, its contents, and femininity. Building techniques employed in compound construction are similar to those noted elsewhere, but the forms which emerge more closely approximate rectangles with round- ed corners. In fact, deviation from a circular room unit necessitates the introduction of supporting wood pillars to resist horizontal thrust and to support the flat terrace roofs. In the same way, granary construction, while it is based on a coil technique, does not appear to derive from a concept of pottery-like form or process, but rather from stone or mud-brick construction34. The form appears to be closely related to those of the Dogon who do in fact use stone for their granary walls which converge to complete a four-sided dome at the apex. Dogon granaries are also similar in their surface repre- sentation of the female form35. This similarity in both form and surface symbolism would reinforce hypotheses of historical reconstruction as well as linguistic evidence both of which suggest LoWilisi migrations from the north (Labouret, 1954, pp. 15ff. ; 1958, pp. 21 ff.). 33 Lobi, Dogon and Bobo are combined, in Westermann's linguistic classification, into one sub-group of the Voltaic-speaking peoples and the Mossi or Mole-Dagbane into another subgroup (Goody, 1967, pp. 2-3). 34 This area is rich in ruins of stone construction, as is illustrated by numerous descriptions in Labouret (1954, pp. 15-20) as well as comments by Savonnet (1956). The richness of data is suggestive of a building tradition in stone. 36 See, for instance, Desplagnes, 1907, Fig. 88.</page><page sequence="17">160 LABELLE PRUSSIN A tradition in stone or mud-brick construction would, this writer suggests, diminish the possibilities of metamorphous expression, and call into play rather, an aesthetic dependent upon surface representation. In other words a distinction should be made between a creative process which depends upon applied elements to convey meaning and one in which the main mass itself expresses meaning. Furthermore, the suggested attributes of femininity in the LoWilisi granaries do not directly suggest productivity or continuity, but among the peoples of West Africa, a woman is not a woman unless she bears a child. Although femininity and fertility are synonymous conceptually, such an association is difficult to convey in an angular form. As one moves eastwards, the isolated field granary is gradually embraced within the walls of the residential structure. The writer suspects that encompassing the granary into the compound itself reflects not only a transition from matrilineality to patrilin- eality, but is suggestive of an increasing association between soil fertility and family fertility. The incorporation of the granary is suggested by the construction process itself. The first granary is built at the same time as the elementary residential unit, and it is located in the heart of the 'longroom' or long central chamber onto which the other rooms open (Goody, 1967, pp. 38). While it may be true that the 'cattle-byre' or live- stock yard is most important in symbolizing ancestral ties and hence the lineage continu- ity, it is the longroom with its granary which expresses family unity and viability36. Each compound residence possesses only one cattle yard, but the number of granaries is an ac- curate indicator of the number of farming groups which j ointly inhabit the complex. When a new farming group is established, a new granary is built immediately outside the exist- ing walls of the compound, and when it is completed, new walls are extended around it. The adjacent wall is torn down and the new granary spatially integrated into the interior. Incorporation into the compound complex is accompanied by a gradual but major transmutation of the granary form itself. In general, anthropomorphic surface relief of a female disappears in favor of a formal expression of pregnancy itself. The cubical forms with their square bases are gradually replaced by spherical pottery-like forms. This crea- tive transmutation can most clearly be seen by examining the eastern LoDagabaprototype. The cosmology of the Mole-speaking LoDagaba, like that of all the peoples under discussion, again suggests a close association between fertility, food production and food storage. The earth's fertility and rain are central to the sources of the harvest and 36 The ancestral shrines are located adjacent to the cattle-yard and it is here too that childbirth takes place (Goody, 1967, p. 38).

(Goody, 1967, p. 32). Sky and Earth are intermediaries between man and God (Wen) and propitiatory rites via these inter- mediaries are performed on the compound terrace, close to the mouth of the main gra- nary in the compound (Girault, 1959, p. 335). In contrast to the Konkomba granary, which symbolizes the continuity and pros- perity of the whole hamlet lineage, and which finds aesthetic expression in magnitude and isolation, the LoDagaba granary, like that of the LoWilisi, contains the sustenance of a single viable family unit. It is not the magnitude which arrests our attention, nor the surface representation, but the heroic form of the pottery itself (Fig. 8)37. It was previously noted that for the peoples of West Africa, it is procreation which is the most crucial aspect of femininity, since only through fertility is social continuity secured. Since there can be no substitution for the procreative powers of a woman, a pregnant woman is a quintessential element of humanity. Unlike the LoWilisi granary in which surface attributes in low relief convey the notion of femininity, the LoDagaba granary form expresses pregnancy itself. To draw in clay the taut fullness of the swelling womb high above the earth portrays not only the crucial promise of life but communicates a vernacular defiance of the laws of gravity. The technological skill of the potter is measured by his success in resisting those forces which tend to pull weight down to earth. In a virtuoso move, the granary stands poised in space precisely at the point of balance between the opposing forces of Earth and Sky. The embracing of the granary into the compound might also be analogous to the greater concern and protection felt by the family as the moment of birth approaches. As the granary increases in volume and hence in fullness of content, it is as if the moment of birth were approaching and greater precautions, expressed in physical enclosure, must be exercised. Empirically, the importance of a LoDagaba granary might be explained by the way in which the properties of mud are taxed to their utmost in order to approach the struc- tural potential of the form38. Here the structural potential is increased by the addition of kaolin to the mud. Quantities of kaolin are present in this area and when it is added to the clay mix, adhesiveness, hardness and durability are increased (PL II, 3). When kaolin hardens, it turns white and the whiteness of the granary walls, contrasting with the reddish brown of the compound walls around them, is conceptually related to the general emphasis on white as a purificatory aspect (Goody, 1962, pp. 69-70). Moreover, the color white is closely associated with both birth and death. The balance between opposing forces of Earth and Sky noted above appears to relate to concepts of reversal and separation accompanying LoDagaba mortuary customs (Goody, 1962, p. 61 ; 72; 76, etc.), The concept of reversal procedures at death derives 37 The illustration used here is taken from the peoples whom Rattray has called Lober. (1932). This people however, is the same LoDagaba described by Goody (1962). 38 By structural potential I mean the design maxima which a particular structural form of a given material can be expected to reach, under maximum loading conditions. More simply, a wooden beam of the same size and length as a concrete beam without reinforcing can carry far more tensile stress before it fails. 11 Paideuma</page><page sequence="23">162 LABELLE PRUSSIN from the recognition that the funeral celebrates the antithesis of life. The granary, symbolic of life itself, would also be subject to death. Hence, it seems reasonable to assume that similar conceptual antithesis would be aesthetically expressed. And indeed, the height to which the center of mass in a LoDagaba granary is lifted is directly inverse to the normal behavior of weight with respect to the earth's surface. If, as Goody suggests further, reversal procedures are expressed by the formal transgression of cer- tain strongly held social norms, attempted defiance of the laws of gravity would like- wise constitute an aesthetic transgression. At a higher level of meaning, the inverted pearlike granary form could also be interpreted as an opposition inherent in conceptual unity with the earth. The dialectic is analogous to that which takes place at the precise moment of birth or death. Each is a conceptual point of contact with the Earth and among the LoDagaba, at these two points in time, at the beginning and at the end, the body must never be allowed to touch the earth (Goody, 1962, p. 49). Tallensi Among the Tallensi, the metaphysical form and location of the LoDagaba granary merges with the Mossi emphasis on the doorway in a synthesis which gives rise to a further transmutation. Not only is the granary enclosed within the spatial confines of the compound walls, but it assumes a central, pivotal position, acknowledging the recognition that the earth's fertility is the focal point of all life, at all levels of meaning (Fig. 9).

Its contents are the property of the compound elder and may only be distributed by him, but at the same time the granary constitutes a point of unity between the head of the family compound and the other members. The continuity of the lineageis expressed in the entrance way as it is among the Mossi, but now two pillars stand like sentinels, guarding the gateway into the livestock yard and the compound elder's room (PI. IV, 10). This room is the sanctuary of the compound elder's lin- eage ancestor and the cattleyard shelters his most valuable possessions. Livestock is not viewed as material wealth, but rather as the social medium assuring lineage continuity, since it represents bridewealth. It is in this area that the lineage shrines may be found, that the last funeral rites take place, and from which the corpse of the compound elder is carried out. This spatially delimited area is the realm of masculinity and sacrosanctity. The interior defining walls which divide it from the remainder of the compound radiate out from the granary. The subcompounds beyond, whose floor levels are two or three feet higher than that of the cattleyard an the earth beyond, are the self-contained quarters of the wives and accomodate the intimate domestic family life. These subcompounds are the secular, feminine realm, the counterpart to the sacred, masculine realm. Apart from functional explanations for the higher floor level of the wives' subcompounds, it also seems rea- sonable to assume that the elevation from the earth's surface carries a cosmolgic mean- ing, not unlike that which operates for the LoDagaba. The physical transition, or passing over from one area to the other, from the livestock yard to the subcompounds, from the sacred to the profane, is effected by a set of stairs, adjacent to the granary and breaking through the divider walls (PL II, 5). Just as a new set of gateway pillars is cut into the perimeter walls of the compound when a segment of the extended family unit breaks away to establish a new farming unit, so a new set of stairs is cut into the dividing walls between the two realms, architecturally expressing a new branch from the geneological trunk. Masculine control of, and identity with the granary is expressed in the Tallensi belief that a man's soul, during his lifetime, resides in his granary (Fortes, 1957, p. 57, Rattray, 1932, Vol I, p. 291). When a man dies, "someone descends into the deceased's granary and takes out a single stalk of corn [millet?], squeezes the grain off it and lets it scatter on the ground of the cattleyard.", an eloquent metaphoric gesture that a man's life-force has departed (Rattray, 1932, Vol. I, p. 213). At the same time, the unity in opposition between the masculine and feminine resi- dential counterparts is expressed by the chameleon whose clay image is modelled in low-relief high on the granary wall. The Tallensi believe that when a senior woman dies, (e. g. the mother of the compound elder), her spirit may enter the chameleon thus rep- resented. As a shrine, sacrifices are offered to it before the annual planting and harvest- ing of millet (Rattray, 1932, Vol. II, pp. 295-6). The Tallensi granary does not command attention by contrast with its surroundings or singular isolation in space or by magnitude or perfection of form. Its beauty lies in its pivotal position, its integrative role as a mediator between vital forces in opposition, 11*</page><page sequence="25">164 LABELLE PRUSSIN between male and female, sacred and profane. As such, the granary is life itself. But its expression is oriented internally. Meaning is communicated only to the inhabitants of the compound who have created it, who are intimately involved and dependent upon it. It can only be read by them, for the compound walls hide it from the outside. When the granary does indeed emerge and is visible to the outside world, as among the Somba, then a new aesthetic also comes into being. Somba Somba, commonly used to designate a group of peoples who live in the environs of the Atakora mountains of northern Dahomey, is actually a French administrative term39. Like Lobi, it designates not a single ethnic group, but a cluster of groupings who, while they speak different dialects, do manifest a common way of life, of which their archi- tecture is a striking example. One of these so-called 'Somba' clusters, the Betammadibe in the east, have evolved a granary which forms the aesthetic peak of the continuum we have outlined. Another cluster, the Tayaba, illuminates the process of transmutation from Tallensi to Betammadibe. Now, in a different world of two-story architecture, horizontal balance is replaced by a vertical one: the profane is balanced above the sacred realm (PL IV, 11). Generally speaking, the Somba have taken the domestic elements of the Tallensi compound and superimposed them over the sacred, masculine realm. By effecting this separation in levels, the compound complex is transformed into a single massive block, within which a three dimensional rhythm flows. While it is conceivably possible to break up a Tallensi compound into its component elements, Somba architecture is gestaltic, and cannot be divided up without violating its reality. The lifting up in space of the profane elements of the plan has also led, in turn, to the extension of the curvilinear walls, creating the visual, tower-like effect and suggesting a 'castle like' appearence (Mercier, 1954, p. 31 ; Bertho, 1947, p. 100). The association in the mind of the Western observer of Somba compounds and European castles has undoubtedly been responsible in part for the commonly suggested explanation that such 'fortifications' indeed resulted from preoccupations with defense40. This writer would 39 The generic term Somba is used here in describing features common to all the, ethnic groups clustered under the administrative term, although the Tayaba, a fragment of the Natimba, are linguistically distinct from other Somba-speaking groups (Mercier, 1954, p. 34). 40 The regularity of towers, perhaps that feature which is so suggestive of a quality of fortification to the French researcher, is reminiscent of the numerous tatas or fortified residences built in Malinke country over the last centuries (Meillassoux, 1967; Binger, 1892), which in themselves echo the medieval French chateau- forts such as that of Angers.

The Tayaba compound in the west most closely resembles the spatial and functional configuration of a Tallensi compound in that the granary remains the fulcrum of bal- ance (Fig. 10). The entrance facade is indicated by four tapering conical pillars not unlike the two which designate the entrance to the Tallensi cattleyard. Ancestral altars, molded in mud and projecting from the external wall, are adjacent to these pillars. An opening between the two central pillars leads us directly into the groundfloor level of the com- pound and access to the upper terrace is by ladder only. Scattered among the forest of gnarled tree trunks which rise to support the mud terrace above are calabashes, fire- wood and fodder. The conical pillars are molded into nesting enclosures for fowl. Although it has been suggested (Mercier, 1954, p. 54) that the groundfloor level is not ideologically important to the Tayaba, the similarity in function and architectural expression between Tayaba and Tallensi compounds suggests that a conceptually as- signed meaning does indeed exist, i. e. the lower cattle area is sacred while the subcom- pounds above are secular. The granary itself, in the shape of a huge clay ostrich egg, sits in the center of the terrace, supported from below by a central conical pillar, identical in form and on axis with those which mark the entrance facade41. Domestic life revolves around the open terrace space which serves as a visual setting for the granary. This writer would like to suggest that it is precisely the supporting pillar below the granary which, like a ful- crum, establishes a unity between the two realms. The fertility expressed in granary and contents is linked to the earth and the sacred realm below, while at the same time the pillar supports and sustains the family's continuity, both figuratively and literally. But like the Tallensi and the LoDagaba before them, the Tayaba's source of life is hidden from the outside world, cradled within protective walls. The Betammadibe, integrating the entrance gateway, symbolic of the family's con- tinuity and viability with the granary, symbolic of fertility and the beginnings heroically announce the synthesis and the source of life to the ouside world in their granary- fa$ades, thereby achieving a quintessence of architectural expression42. Entrance into a Betammadibe world is heralded by more than a pair of gateway pillars; the entrance pillars have become towers and above and within them, at terrace level, nestle two granaries, swollen with millet. It is these two granaries which more than all the others, possess social and ceremonial value (Mercier, op. cit., p. 36). The granaries are modelled in place like vases, with clays especially prepared, as among the Konkomba and LoDagaba. Again, they are divided into three, four or six sections, but instead of supporting legs, the tower parapet itself provides a continual earthen support for the bulging granary walls. As among the Tayaba, the entrance leads directly into the groundfloor level, but now many more architectural manifestations of sacred meaning are visually evident. The 41 The granary, reduced to almost formal perfection, suggests an appropriate parallel to Brancusi's sculp- ture, The Beginning of the World. 42Mercier (1954, p. 34, fn. 11) suggests that the term Betammadibe itself is derivative of the expression "those who work the ma or banco", hence simply masons.</page><page sequence="28">WEST AFRICAN MUD GRANARIES 167 central, granary-supporting pillar of the Tayaba has been enlarged into the compound elder's room, a room paralleling that of the Tallensi. But now, the room is at the pivotal center, closer to the ancestors in time as well as space. Altars and devices of magical protection have been moved (with one exception) from the exterior of the compound walls close in to the precise point of linkage between past and present. Extending immediately above this central sacrosanct space and accessible only from the main terrace, is the room in which the compound elder's mother lives (Fig. 11). Her social status is perhaps the most revered of all and it is this room which is used by the young men during their initiation rites (Mercier, op. cit., p. 36). Her position may be likened to that of the Tallensi mother whose subcompound is also the most important in the life of the family and whose spirit is embodied in the granary shrine after death. Thus, the Tallensi granary's male-female, sacred-profane antithesis is expressed among the Betammadibe by the superimposition of one space above the other in an expanded tower, therebycreating an architectural synthesis in space. The unity is further conveyed by fashioning the ancestral altar from the earth cut out of the terrace opening which permits passage between the lower and upper levels of the compound (Mercier, 1954, p. 48). This altar however, is located on the exterior, adjacent to the towers which lift high the most significant and ritually important granaries and which enclose and announce the entrance opening. Thus, the family's viability and continuity is communicated to the outside world via a symbolism in which the act of procreation, linked to the Earth, is expressed by the opening and the fertility of Earth and family are symbolized by the granaries and their contents. The Betammidibe, by integrating both into a single com- position, achieve thereby, a new level of architectural consciousness. In other words, the Mossi and Tallensi allegories have been synthesized into a more complex symbolism, in which the granary above is the fruit of union between male and female below. The granary has become both the seed and the fruit. Intrinsic to all the visually meaningful granaries is the relationship between fertility and beauty. The aesthetic expression of this relationship increases as the relationship itself increases in conceptual complexity, thus suggesting the levels of creativity. Among the Dagomba, the granary has no meaning at all, because cereal grains are hardly culti- vated. Among the Mossi, where millet is a staple crop, other economic activities play a more important role in life subsistence and traditional building techniques from which the granary builders' skill would have derived, have been dissipated. Hence, granaries have very little meaning and the level of creative activity with respect to them is mini- mal. On the other hand, creative energy is directed towards an aesthetic expression emanating from the significant meaning attached to the entrance. Among the LoWilisi, indigenous skills are traditionally oriented towards mud-brick or stone construction and the potter's skills are minimal, but millet is a subsistence crop of prime importance to life's continuity. Only the attributes of womanhood can be re- presented through surface relief imagery and the granary stands isolated in the fields which nourish it. The LoDagaba on the other hand carry their potter-like skills to a higher level as they use the basic shapes themselves, expressively contoured hollow volumes, to symbolize not womanhood per se, but fertility and pregnancy. It is these latter qualities which are critical to continuity.</page><page sequence="29">168 LABELLE PRUSSIN Among the Konkomba who create the largest of the granaries in this series, it is not merely symmetrical form but magnitude which becomes an aesthetic concern. Tech- nological perfection merges with the more important role played by a cosmology em- phasizing communality to create a single majestic container attesting the continuity of the community. The conceptual integration between fertility and continuity, between the sacred and profane, finds expression in the Tallensi architecture where not only are granaries inte- gral with homestead, but are raised to higher symbolic levels by their pivotal position in the universe. And finally, the highest levels of technology and skill unite with com- plexity of meaning among the Betammadibe and aesthetic expression is transformed into aesthetic communication. The granary is placed, for the whole world to read, at the very entranceway signifying architectural consciousness. In the process, the essence of their architectural style, the granary-facade, has been brought into being.
