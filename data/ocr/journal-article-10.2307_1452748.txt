<plain_text><page sequence="1">HEINRICH HEINE -A BIOGRAPHICAL ANTHOLOGY DR. HUGO BIEBER finished his Heinrich Heine A Biographical Anthology* along with the Introduction and Notes before his death, and the manuscript was turned over to Dr. Moses Hadas to produce an English version. The book was well worth translating, and a valuable feature in it is passages from letters, though one would have welcomed more *Heinrich Heine A Biographical Anthology Edited by Hugo Bieber.

Both the Introduction and Notes are informative and sound in their critical comments, for Dr. Bieber was a student of Heine for many years and had written a number of books about him. Gustav Karpeles had compiled a similar work of which a translation into English had been made over two generations ago by Arthur Dexter, who is not referred to in the list of books used for the present compilation. The reader will be fascinated by this work which is virtually an autobiography. Poetry, however is not too well represented, in ac- cordance with the policy designed. Of course a volume of snippets, as it were, is not a substitute, for a complete book by Heine like his Travel Pictures, Religion and Philosophy in Germany and Germany, three masterpieces that should be read in their entirety, and which have all found translators in English. The publication of this book offers an opportunity for again reverting to the subject of how much of a Jew was Heine. The tide as such has turned in his favor. Heinrich Graetz deserves credit for hastening this trend, Karpeles continued it, and Meyer Waxman has properly included him in his history of Jewish literature. But a misapprehension still prevails on one point. It is embodied in the section in Bieber's book entitled "Return to Judaism." There was no return for there really never was an abandonment of Judaism. As Zangwill, really quoting Heine, has him say in the portrait of him on his mattress grave, "I never returned to Judaism, for I never left it." It has been made out by some that Heine was a lost sheep, and returned to the flock, that he was disloyal to his people and their religion, finally saw the light, and became converted to his childhood faith. His confes- sion has been put in the same category as those whose authors have related their progress from their crude heretical beliefs back to the old religion. This was not the case with Heine. True, Heine underwent a formal baptism, which he regretted, to attain a position and to be allowed to practise law; he married in the Roman Catholic Church because he wanted to spare his wife deep pain and mortification; but no one has ever urged that he was a believer in the Lutheran doctrines to which he was supposed to become an adherent. All his life he detested what he called Nazarene asceticism, which as a youth he mistakenly thought was a feature of Judaism as well as of Christianity. He loved the Greek writers and attached himself to what has been called Hellenism. But he held to a philosophy of life that was really Jewish in its concern with matters in this world instead of in the next, and in</page><page sequence="3">68 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW its preserving a proper balance between one's spiritual and physical welfare. His love poems were startlingly reminiscent of The Song of Songs, of which he was an admirer with the rest of the books in the Bible. A Jewish spirit unconsciously entered into all or most of his literary work. Heine's statements in some letters, later prefaces, and his Confessions must not be taken too literally or even too seriously. In the process of his "conversion" he repudiated what some regard as his masterpiece Religion and Philosophy in Germany, but his admirers have not heeded him any more than have the lovers of Tolstoy who repudiated War and Peace after he entered the phase of his spiritual life; and Bieber wisely includes selections from the Heine work in his book. Heine said he had been an atheist - which he never was - being really a pantheist, with leanings towards eighteenth century deism. He now pretends to be a full fledged theist, a believer in a personal anthropomorphic God, and at the same time he calls it "an old superstition." He said in his will that he wanted no priest of any denomination to officiate at his funeral. The lack of seriousness in his pretense that his religion now was now naive like that of Uncle Tom appears in the frivolous manner in which he states his embracement of the doctrine of immortality of the soul which accompanied his return to the acceptance of a personal God. This immortality he said, "is then thrown into the bargain just as the butcher throws in some good marrow-bones into the shopper's basket gratis if he is pleased with the customer." There is Heine all over, the same mordant wit after his "conversion" as before. While he rightly emphasized that he was now a Jew in spirit and a lover of the Hebrew scriptures, he did not want to be misunderstood. He took care to state that he had not renounced his philosophy of life or accepted irrational dogmas; while he had the highest regard for Moses and loved the Jewish people more than ever, he did not cease having a great love for Greek literature and philosophy as of old, nor was his later attitude correct or true that he could not tolerate Judaism in the old days. He had a Hebraic cast of mind and - though he probably would not use the designation, a "Jewish soul." It has been supposed that Heine's "return to Judaism" was prompted by his reading Michael Sachs's book on the religious poetry of the Jews in Spain. Rather he learned much about the literary history of the Jews, in particular that they had good poets, who not only wrote love poetry, but were steeped in religious fervor, and were masters of their art. He particularly was attracted to one with whom he felt some</page><page sequence="4">HEINRICH HEINE-MORDELL 69 poetic kinship and whose work he had not known, Jehudah Ha-Levi. He was inspired to write a poem about him to which he gave a title that was a misnomer, Jehudah ben Levi, and he introduced in it the names of other medieval poets. It was as a literary critic that he was influenced by the Sachs book. But in one sense, as a poet, Heine belongs to the world at large. With some exceptions his writings are secular so that they may be appreciated by people of all religions because they can find in his work the appeal to emotions that are common to all. Yet the Jew in spirit is in his work; only in the early stage he is not as vociferous as in the later. Here he protests too much that he had once cared too little about Judaism and now he regards it overmuch; as a matter of fact he was unconscious that he had not underestimated it in the past. He always believed in the moral principles of Judaism, he held to it on its human side, even when he did not use the name. He had some Jewish training; he found-much magic in the very words Seder and Shalet (Cholend) the Sabbath meal - the words would evoke nostalgic memories. Karpeles has shown that the nature of Heine's wit was of ancient Jewish texture, and Freud has found it typical of his people. But Heine never accepted in the past certain dogmas and therefore may be believed when he said that in his later stage, he still remained aloof from them. "My religious convictions and opinions," he said, "have remained free from any church." George Eliot called Heine's confessions "mocking recantations," and added that his profession of Theism appear in a strain of irony that "repels our sympathy and baffles our psychology." While this shows she recognized the insincere sentiments here and there, she overlooked the fact that he was in deadly earnest when he eulogized the Jewish people, something she herself was to do later. She was not a Theist herself. It is stated in the unsigned brief Preface that Dr. Hadas translated part of the book but also had recourse to the translations of others. We are not told which of the prose selections were translated wholly by him, or the names of the others whose translations were revised by him. Their names do not appear at the end of the prose selections, as do the names of the translators of the poetry in most cases. We are given in the preface the names of a few translators in English, whose works were used, but the reader is left without any knowledge as to the name of the translator of each section or passage. Dr. Hadas's reputation for scholarship is sufficient attestation to the fact that his</page><page sequence="5">70 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW part was well done, that his translations and revisions were on the side of faithfulness and idiomatic English with very few exceptions. He had translated books from the German before. Nevertheless there arises much confusion, and the preface is replete with errors. It states that much of the prose "has been borrowed from the translations, edited for the Camelot Series, by Charles Godfrey Leland." Leland did not edit the Camelot Series and the volume in it that contains among others, three Heine selections taken from Leland's translation, was edited by Havelock Ellis. It is entitled Prose Selections of Heinrich Heine. Leland made his first translation of the Travel Pictures in 1855, and it was published in Philadelphia by J. Weik, who also inaugurated the first complete German edition of Heine, there and then- while Heine was still alive. The Ellis volume ap- peared in the late eighties. Again the Preface says many of the transla- tions in this Camelot Series are anonymous. Not at all; only two of the selections are given anonymously but presumably were made by Havelock Ellis himself who edited the book and revised all the transla- tions therein. The other five selections we are informed in the Ellis volume were by "Mr. Fleishman." This was S. L. Fleishman who issued in Philadelphia in 1876 his volume of selections from Heine entitled "Prose Miscellanies." A comparison of a passage taken from the Confessions in the Bieber volume with the translation in the Ellis volume shows that the former was taken from the latter, a matter which the reader might like to have known. Incidentally, Bieber has only six pages from the Confessions, the Ellis volume in the Fleishman translation has 27 pages. Again there are two other volumes of Heine translations in the Camelot Series done by Elizabeth A. Sharp, one of these is Art and Letters, not mentioned in the Preface, and the other Heine's Italian Travel Letters, mentioned but not as of the Camelot Series. We are told Dr. Bieber approved of the translations, but one wonders if he ever saw the English volumes from which they were selected. As to the translation of the Introduction and explanatory notes by Dr. Hadas, one confidently accepts it. Sometimes one might quibble over the question whether the proper word was used. Take the following sentence: (p. 22). "Heine's ideal was a civilization in which the life of the spirit and sensuality were in harmonious equipoise so that both could attain unhampered development." Sensuality? The German manuscript is not before us but Bieber could not have meant that Heine approved of sensuality attaining "unhampered</page><page sequence="6">DEAD SEA SCROLLS: FANTASIES-ZEITLIN 71 development" as an ideal of civilization. Sensuality means extreme indulgence in the fleshly appetites and is used always in a derogatory sense. Heine believed that the senses should be given their proper right to be exercised as in Judaism, but not that they should be un- hampered entirely and rise to voluptuousness as an ideal of civilization.
