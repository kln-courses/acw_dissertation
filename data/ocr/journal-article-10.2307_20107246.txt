<plain_text><page sequence="1">William Neues Beyond the Bird's Eye: Animal Focalization This term [personnages] is used here for lack of a more neutral or more exten sive term which would not unduly connote, as this one does, the "humanness" of the narrative agent, even though in fiction nothing prevents us from entrust ing that role to an animal ... or indeed to an "inanimate" object. (G?rard Genette, Narrative Discourse 244, n. 74) As Genette's trademark understatement suggests, there is something in fiction that virtually demands the production of animal narrators. One might then consider whether there is something in animal narration that demands the production of ani mal focalization. Most narratologists have repeated Genette's casual gesture of dis missal or deferral here, but writers' efforts to produce animal focalization display a broad spectrum of approaches meriting closer study. In some narratives the presenta tion of animal focalization can be accomplished through fairly realistic conventions: in the cartoon series The Simpsons, for example, scenes viewed through the dog's eyes can be shown in black and white.1 But written narratives, inherently limited to verbal representations of consciousness, quickly encounter stumbling blocks when depicting animal focalization.2 At first glance such examples might seem to present few wrinkles: every case is arguably straightforward internal focalization, in which the narrator tells us what the (animal) character sees and thinks. But first-person or homodiegetic examples do pose the problem of assigning human language to animals, who by definition cannot speak. As Genette explains, "homodiegetic narrative, as a consequence of its 'vocal' selection, submits a priori to a modal restriction, one that can be sidestepped only by an infraction, or a perceptible distortion. To designate that constraint, perhaps we William Nelles is Associate Professor of English at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. His publications on narrative theory include Frameworks: Narrative Levels and Embedded Narrative and nu merous articles in such journals as Style, Poetics Today, Comparative Literature, Studies in the Literary Imagination, and American Literature. NARRATIVE, Vol. 9, No. 2 (May 2001) Copyright 2001 by The Ohio State University</page><page sequence="2">Beyond the Bird's Eye: Animal Focalization 189 should speak of prefocalizationT {Revisited 78). Homodiegetic narration by animals would thus constitute a special instance of "free prefocalization" (Nelles 82), in which the narrating self's knowledge exceeds that of the experiencing self?here in its command of human language. The simplest analysis of these breaches in focal ization would be simply to attribute them to convention. Some awkwardness or cir cularity occurs here in that the original stipulation that internal focalization be restricted by plausibility is itself already attributed in part to convention (remarked by Genette, Revisited 11). That we ascribe violations of convention to convention threatens to reduce discussion to a shell game in which the object is to explain away rather than to explain marginal and unusual cases. A handful of examples must suffice here to represent the continuum of ap proaches developed for representing animal consciousness. Homodiegetic narra tives, partly because of the problem of linguistic competence, present the more complex instances. In some cases, despite nominal attribution to nonhuman agency, an animal's narrative is indistinguishable from human narrating. Consider the clos ing sentences of Julian Barnes's "The Stowaway": "Now, it's true Noah couldn't have predicted how long his Voyage was going to last, but considering how little we seven ate in five and a half years, it surely would have been worth the risk letting just a pair of us on board. And after all, it's not our fault for being woodworm" (30). Only the final word of the story triggers the recognition that the narrator has been a wood worm; that shock is of course the response Barnes targets, and his purpose demands that nothing in the narrating has suggested a woodworm's focalization. Bruno Zer weck has argued of this narrator that "real-world models of human personality or psychology are not proper standards by which to judge him (or it)" (n. pag.). On the contrary, the "woodworm's" personality and psychology are entirely human throughout, and the final realization that one has been reading an insect's discourse in terms of human personality is essential to the story's effect. More commonly, authors do take some pains to naturalize or motivate their assignment of the narrating to an animal, often by weaving in stereotypes distinc tive to the species doing the narrating, as in Cervantes's "The Dialogue of the Dogs": I gave so many signs of delight and jumped around so much that my master gave orders that I should be untied and allowed to roam free both day and night. As soon as I found myself free I ran up to him and ran circles around him, but without daring to touch him with my paws. I recalled to mind that Aesop's fable in which the ass was such an ass that it wanted to caress its master in the same way that a pampered lapdog of his did, for which it earned itself a good beating. I interpreted this fable to mean that what is elegant and graceful in some people is out of place in others. (261) As the interpretation and application of Aesop's fable indicates, Cervantes's real tar get is human rather than animal nature. But much of the behavior described is stereo typically canine (even the ass imitates dog behavior), as are the narrator's motives and concerns (getting free of his leash, displays of affection toward his master). The</page><page sequence="3">190 William Neues narrative frame?a common feature of animal narratives?in which a sick and fever ish (hence, possibly unreliable) narrator overhears two dogs speaking to one another, offers further mitigation of the unreality of the combining of a dog's vision and a dog's voice. The narrator's greater knowledge in such narrative situations of free pre focalization is typically rendered verisimilar by attributing it to retrospection, and a variation on this approach is offered here as well: the dogs, unable to speak during the experiencing of the adventures they recount, have later become enabled to speak. The premise underlying the technique in standard situations lies in the natural plau sibility that older characters may be wiser than their youthful selves and is of course not logically equivalent to older dogs learning the trick of human speech. Neverthe less, the implicit parallel of these narrative situations is witty and entirely appropri ate for Cervantes's story. Barnes and Cervantes approach the two ends of this spectrum of homodiegetic texts: some offer the bare assertion of their animal provenance in a single sentence, while others closely fit structural, thematic, and diegetic elements together as semi otic markers of animal focalization. A second category of homodiegetic texts ap proaches the paradox of the talking animal by creating a dual narrator, in which both human and animal elements are more closely integrated, as illustrated by Big Bill Broonzy's "Horny Frog": I'm the horny frog from Texas, I just hopped up here. Yes, I left Texas to have a good time, I believe I'll go back there. I know you're wondering how I live in a hollow log. Babe, I will live anywhere, before I will be your dog. Hey baby, tired of flopping on my belly for you. Yeah, you said that you loved me, now look what you made me do. I hop around in the summer, when I go down deep in the sand. Yes, so you mean mistreaters won't know where I'm found. Beginning with the very title, the human and animal contexts run in parallel through a series of double entendres that layer two focalizations in a single speech. "Horny" simultaneously identifies the variety of the animal?horned frog?and, one might say, the variety of the blues singer. The frog itself is not just an animal that flops on its belly but also a stock symbol for sexuality and genitalia.3 The double reading provides something like allegorical focalization, in which the separate but equal points of view of the man and of the animal are both expressed on different levels throughout the song. Narratologically, the human side of the narrator justifies his speech, while the frog side of the narrator justifies the range of thematic and be havioral components. A particularly ingenious example of this dual focalization is played out in Robert Olen Butler's "Jealous Husband Returns in Form of Parrot": For a moment I think she knows it's me. But she doesn't, of course. I say "Hello" again and I will eventually pick up "pretty bird." I can tell that as soon as she says it, but for now I can only give her another hello. Her fingertips move</page><page sequence="4">Beyond the Bird 's Eye: Animal Focalization 191 through my feathers and she seems to know about birds. She knows that to pet a bird you don't smooth his feathers down, you ruffle them. But of course she did that in my human life, as well. (72) Here the narrator's thinking is not only linked to traits of a parrot's behavior, but is constrained by its mental capacities. Whether or not parrot brains are "hard-wired" for delayed responses to stimuli (he will repeat "Hello" even though the wife has al ready gone on to say "pretty bird"), that premise functions in this passage as a marker of nonhuman thought, where our previous examples have been limited to thought processes thoroughly familiar to human agents. In heterodiegetic examples, by contrast, the few ambiguities are not much dif ferent than those encountered in human focalization. But his wife was a sensible bird, and she knew that cobra's eggs meant young cobras later on; so she flew off from the nest, and left Darzee to keep the babies warm, and continue his song about the death of Nag. Darzee was very like a man in some ways. (Kipling 257) The question as to whether "Darzee was very like a man in some ways" represents the thought of Darzee's wife (internal focalization) or the "omniscient" narrator's com mentary (free focalization) parallels the example of Phileas and Passepartout in the opening chapters of Around the World in 80 Days (famously litigated by Genette and Mieke Bal). We might conclude, with Genette, that "so far as our information about Phileas [or Darzee] is concerned, the two positions are equivalent and that in this re spect the distinction between them can be disregarded' (Revisited 75 Genette's italics). The distinction does gather significance if applied instead to our information about Darzee's wife. If the sentence represents her thought, the narration has reached that suspension on the "threshold of verbalization" that Dornt Cohn has identified as one of the characteristic effects of narrated monologue, "leaving the relationship between words and thoughts latent" (103). Genette's more rigidly binary model, which dictates that "narrative always reduces thoughts either to speeches or events" (Revisited 63), broaches an issue central to animal focalization. In internal focalization, the narrative "can tell us everything this character perceives and everything he thinks.... In princi ple, it is supposed to tell us nothing else. If it does, that is again an alteration (paralep sis), in other words, an infraction, intentional or not, of the modal position of the moment" (Revisited 74-75). The attribution of verbal thought to a bird?I see no way to read the sentence as an "event"?would thus be paraleptic here (taking for granted that birds do not think in English), though entirely justifiable artistically, as Kipling hu morously anthropomorphizes her with stereotypical (human) gender attributes. Finally, in passages such as the following, from Jack London's White Fang, the focus veers sharply away from anthropomorphic interest toward imagining what an animal's focalization?both literally and psychologically?must be like. It was this last [their capacity to change the very face of the world] that espe cially affected him. The elevation of frames of poles caught his eye; yet this in</page><page sequence="5">192 William Neues itself was not so remarkable, being done by creatures that flung sticks and stones to great distances. But when the frames of poles were made into tepees by being covered with cloth and skins, White Fang was astounded. It was the colossal bulk of them that impressed him. They arose around him, on every side, like some monstrous quick-growing form of life. They occupied nearly the whole of his field of vision. He was afraid of them. They loomed ominously above him; and when the breeze stirred them into huge movements, he cowered down in fear, keeping his eyes warily upon them, and prepared to spring away if they attempted to precipitate themselves upon him. (123) London brilliantly supplements features of the animal's mental perspective (focal ization proper) with features of his physical perspective (Fran?ois Jost's "oculariza tion"), as he emphasizes the dog's "field of vision" and the height of objects relative to the level of the canine gaze. Even here, where the primary concern is the imagina tion and depiction of the animal's consciousness, an interpretation of human behav ior hovers, perhaps supporting the claim made by many narratologists that "human interest" (Bremond 62) or "experientiality of an anthropomorphic nature" (Fludernik 26) is one of the minimal requirements of narrative. London's development of his an imal filters, while intrinsically interesting, also serves his theme that animals' beliefs are more rational than those of humans: "Unlike man, whose gods are of the unseen and the overguessed ... the wolf and the wild dog that have come in to the fire find their gods in the living flesh, solid to the touch, occupying earth-space and requiring time for the accomplishment of their ends and their existence. No effort of faith is necessary to believe in such a god" (130-31). These six examples may be plotted as points on a line representing the relative congruence of the animal's consciousness and the narrator's representation of it. The matching of the discourse to an animal's consciousness may be perfunctory (Barnes); a range of characteristics conventionally associated with that animal may be incorporated into the content (Cervantes, Kipling); nonhuman thought patterns or constraints may determine some elements of the discourse (Butler); the nonhuman focalization may be sustained throughout, though accompanied by human focaliza tion (Broonzy); or a thorough attempt may be made to reproduce something like the texture or content or shape of nonhuman thought (London). At one extreme the nar rator's subjectivity is nominally located within an animal filter, but skews incongru ously from that premise through details inconsistent with cultural discourses about that animal. At the other extreme the narrating limits itself rigorously within the ani mal's natural and/or conventional sphere of interest and reference. While heterodiegetic narration is not a sufficient condition for the closest con gruity in animal focalization (as the Kipling example indicates), it does seem to be a necessary condition. Homodiegetic narration, constrained to attribute the implausible capability of human language directly to a nonhuman narrator, compromises the verisimilitude required for a convincing illusion of representation. Dorrit Cohn has demonstrated the truth of the paradox that heterodiegetic psycho-narration, "the most indirect and traditional of the modes . . . may be regarded as the most direct, indeed the unique, path that leads to the sub-verbal depth of the mind" (56-57). Het</page><page sequence="6">Beyond the Bird's Eye: Animal Focalization 193 erodiegetic psycho-narration is the mode perfectly suited to narrative situations grounded upon "the narrator's superior knowledge of the character's inner life and his superior ability to present it and assess it.... The cognitive and linguistic dispar ity between a narrator and his character is of particular relevance to the narration of those levels of consciousness that cannot be clearly shaped into verbal patterns by the fictional mind itself" (29). As our examples suggest, however, writers have devel oped two techniques for mitigating, or rather highlighting and playing off of, the in herent problems posed by homodiegetic animal focalization. The first is an adaptation of the general technique of embedding, in which the animal's narrating is explained by an outer frame featuring an unreliable narrator or naturalizing circum stances. Embedding may function in such cases as a marker of both verbal and modal shifts, signaling not only a shift of narrator and narrative level, but of the rules of the world, creating a formal equivalent of verisimilitude for the animal narration (Nelles 134). The second is the highly specific technique of the double human/animal narra tor, ? la Broonzy and Butler, which precisely targets this narrative crux. But let me rest my case here. My purpose is simply to propose a preliminary model against which readers can test their own pet examples of animal focalization. ENDNOTES My thanks to the SSNL conference organizers and participants (both at and around the big table), especially Emma Kafalenos and James Phelan; to my students in the spring of 2000, who helped me work out (and throw out) parts of this argument; and to Nancy Easterlin, Janet Gardner, Patrick J. McCorkle, Ray Purdy, Dan Shen, Scott Vaszily, and Lori Williams, all of whom offered valuable advice. 1. As in the episode "Bart's Dog Gets an F," which also features audio "focalization" (Jost's "auricular ization") when the dog hears Bart's speech as indecipherable mumbling. 2. The locus classicus for critical discussion of animal point of view is Victor Shklovsky's 1917 essay "Art as Technique": "Tolstoy uses this technique of 'defamiliarization' constantly. The narrator of 'Kholstomer,' for example, is a horse, and it is the horse's point of view (rather than a person's) that makes the content of the story seem unfamiliar" (21). But apart from a handful of explicit cues?"the other horses," "us horses"?nothing in the passages quoted is "motivated" by or reflective of a horse's point of view per se. The technique is, as Shklovsky notes, no more than Tolstoy's characteristic "method of seeing things out of their normal context," "as if they were unfamiliar" (24). None of this is a criticism of Shklovsky's essay, merely a reminder that his topic is defamiliarization?which he treats brilliantly?not animal focalization, about which he has little to say. 3. Bruno Bettelheim identifies the frogs in fairy tales as symbols for sexual relations generally, and specifically remarks that "The frog's ability to blow itself out when excited arouses ... associations to the penis' erectability" (290). And Anne Sexton reminds us that "Frog is my father's genitals" (282). WORKS CITED Bal, Mieke. "The Narrating and the Focalizing: A Theory of the Agents in Narrative." Style 17, no. 2 (1993): 234-69.
