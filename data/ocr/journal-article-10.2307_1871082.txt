<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES SOME PROBLEMS RAISED BY HISTORICAL RELATIVISMt BERT JAMES LOEWENBERG A CCORDING to the relativist dogma, the past always eludes us. Nothing is so fleeting as memory; nothing so pallid as the documents that record the throbbing life of a bygone age. Only a part of the past can be rescued from the oblivion in which yesterday has already en- shrouded it. The deepest experiences of life hap- pen to individuals, and neither art nor science can truly transmit them to posterity. Lofty aspirations and vibrant passions are buried with those once stirred by them, beyond the power of manuscripts, coins, and monuments to recall. Since the whole of the past can never be recap- wtured, once it has been lived it is literally gone forever. To hope that disciplined imagination and scholarly effort can re-create what was actually thought, felt, and done in former times is sheer illusion.2 But while these arguments lack logical vigor, they present one of the vital problems that the relativist critique of certainty has thrust upon modern scholarship. What kinds of knowledge does the historian seek? Are there any special characteristics attaching to historical knowl- edge? And how much of the nature of knowledge itself is it needful to know before tentative answers to these questions can be formulated? The crux of the relativist contention, however, makes these questions even more compelling. Every intellectual effort is limited by the psy- I This paper and the following one by Willson H. Coates were read at the annual meeting of the American Historical Association, Cleveland, Ohio, December I947. 2 M. MANDELBAUM, The problem of historical knowledge (New York, I938), PP. I9, 20, 23, 86, and 87. The argument that every event is infinitely richer than any later account of it can be involves the fallacy of equating "knowledge" with complete knowledge (ibid., p. 84 and chaps. ii and v). J. H.

While the validity of this position is undeniable, the relativist goes further in maintaining that the degree of truth assignable to any assertion depends upon the prior knowledge of who says what as well as what is said.3 Even if it were possible somehow to circum- vent the elusive character of the facts with which the historian deals, it is impossible to circumvent the limitations which beset the his- torian. For mortals including historians-are not free; and the objectivity and neutrality pursued so avidly by an earlier generation be- long to the immortals alone. The great names of historiography-Herodotus, Polybius, Nie- buhr, Ranke, Greene-have long supplied critics with an irresistible opportunity for a dis- play of erudition.4 In the process a platitude was elevated to the rank of a postulate, namely, that every age must re-write history in its own terms. For the sophisticated, every man became his own historian; for the vulgar, history became "bunk." But the result in both cases was more or less the same-an anarchy of individual judg- ments, the sole and indefeasible right to a private world of historical truth.5 For this as for everything else philosophers have a word subjectivism but the conse- quence, called by whatever name, is chaos.6 An infinite regress of relativisms is inescapable, for if an analyst evaluates a proposition or a fact in terms of the elements conditioning it, that evaluation in turn demands an analysis of the 3 MANDELBAUM, p. 84; for his discussion of Karl Mannheim see pp. 67-82. 4 F.

And when knowledge is conceived as "an act of faith,"7 it comes perilously close to the same confusion unless the phrase implies that postulates of social knowl- edge, like all other knowledge, are ultimately as- sumptions. To reject the vicious relativism of infinite regress does not demand a rejection of all relativisms. Neither does it suggest an en- dorsement of any variety of absolute truth or necessarily propel its critics in the direction of absolutism.8 Nevertheless, historical relativism compels a re-examination of the idea of the past. If only a fragment of the past is discernible a frag- ment, moreover, selected in response to issues, principles, and concepts rooted in the present- it is manifest that the past can no longer be em- ployed with customary looseness. Whimsical though it may appear, historians have overesti- mated the past. Acceptance of relativist premises makes it difficult to understand the past in the traditional sense of a literal past. The past is no longer relevant to itself alone; the major significance of any past belongs rather to the culture whose members are engaged in interpreting it. Relativism has shifted the his- torical center of gravity to the present. The ob- ject of the historical quest is no longer a past, 7C. A. BEARD, "Written history as an act of faith," American historical review, XXXIX (I934), 2I9-3I. Report, p. 2I, represents, I think, a doubtful usage of the term. An "act of faith" is not an as- sumption in the same sense that an assumption is an "act of faith." Apart from this the usage is dubious on semantic grounds since the phrase con- notes psychological elements of belief which the word "assumption" is designed to avoid. The paragraphs following, pp. 20 and 2I, raise the basic questions of judgment and value in an acute form. See MANDELBAUM s criticism of Beard, pp. go, 9I, and I78; and C. A. BEARD and A. VAGTS, "Currents of thought in historiography," American historical review, XLII (I937), 460-83. 8 MANDELBAU1K, p. 98. Exponents of naturalism may ignore absolutism or any type of idealism if they choose. Such hypotheses, however, are clearly legitimate, competing ones. Accordingly, a major criticism of the Report is its emphasis. Beard's intro- duction is adequate as an introduction, but "Con- trolling assumptions by RANDALL and HAINES requires expansion (pp. I 7-23 and esp. 20-23) . The "problems of terminology," "propositions," etc., are less propositions than hypotheses stemming from the major philosophy upon which the whole volume is based. For the most part, they are valid only if the philosophy itself is valid. for insights into social life and human behavior of vanished eras are sought for something; the resolution of a contemporary dilemma, the validation of a contemporary judgment. What is compelling in the past is determined by what is compelling in the present. The key to sig- nificance is always supplied by assumptions currently held and based, in turn, upon future considerations currently entertained. The past is endowed with meanings for living men only in the sense that segments of the past are impli- cated in contemporary relations. Watt's con- tribution to the steam engine is a part of the living past; the death of X in Tudor England is as dead a part of the past as he. "There is no material," says John Dewey, "available for lead- ing principles and hypotheses save that of the historic present." And, he comments in another place: "Only when the past event which is judged is a going concern having efects still di- rectly observable are judgments and knowledge possible."9 The past has become a moans rather than an end. Moreover, no past is ever more than a partial past, fragmental not only because incomplete but also because always re- fracted through the eyes of succceding pres- ents.IÂ° 9J.

BEALE'S con- clusion (Report, p. 9I), "the constantlyshifting ka- leidoscope of hypotheses about the causes of the Civil War," is exact]y what we should expect accord- ing to this thesis of "past and present" interrelations. "Scientific exactitude" may not be a reasonable or realizable ideal for social science; it may also be a descriptive phrase in physical science. In any case, the essential problem seems to be how to assess, control, evaluate, "already held theses" (Report), not to esorcise them-how, in other words, to in- corporate them into hypotheses and repeatedly to test them.

Knowledge results from differing perspectives of progressive generations who look at different aspects of posterity as altering contemporary goals dictate. Knowledge of the past, it is true, comes out of the past but in a reverse temporal order. The so-called "facts" are latent in the past, but it is a con- tinuing series of presents which shapes the con- tour of objectives. Geological facts, for example, were always imbedded beneath the surface of the earth, but the pre-uniformitarians exca- vated one set of facts; evolutionary geologists another. The epic engraved on the timeless rocks spelled out one story to Georges Cuvier and a different story to Charles Lyell. And the facts of natural history did not impress Louis Agassiz as they later impressed Charles Dar- win. In short, we reconstrouct the past as we reconstruct any other body of data, and changes win interpretation and depths of understanding are gauged by present orientations tinged by considerations of an impending future. The meaning of the shift in temporal empha- sis becomes even more apparent when it is re- called that the writing of history is inevitably selective. Once this proposition is accepted, the crucial issue for all past reconstruction becomes the choice of principles of selection and the criteria by which they are chosen. As principles of selection grow out of present problems, it follows that the present is the matrix of his- torical judgment-both with regard to con- trolling issues and to standards of importance and value. The present, therefore, is always with us; it is an unalterable part of the historian's universe. The problem then becomes not how to know the past in any older sense but how attainable knowledge of the past can be ren- dered precise, accurate, and objectively veriS- able. What consequences follow from an acceptance of the proposition that history is anchored in the present even if indissolubly linked with the past? If this is intellectually XLII (I945), I73; M. G.

Self-styled conservators of the past who attack something called the "cult of the contemporary" represent a confusion of ideas rather than of words, if the interpretation of the past presented above is tenable. respectable doctrine, is objective historical knowledge possible?II The fatal weakness of the historical enter- prise, runs the contention7 lies in the intellectual process of reconstruction rather than in the "facts" which are its ingredients. Ancient his- toriographical principles and modern relativistic ones have combined to imprison the historian in a cul-de-sac of futility. Without concepts, hy- potheses, and laws, a science of history is im- possible; with concepts, hypotheses, and laws, a science of history is inconceivable. That his- tory deals with the concrete and the particular and science with the universal is a doctrine as old as Aristotle. Both science and philosophy were crowned with the virtue of universality whereas history was relegated to a concern with singular events. The office of the historian was to ferret out the "facts"; it was the function of others to generalize them. But there are two sides to this quandary. On the one hand, the particular, rigidly bounded by time and space, cannot be transcended; on the other hand, his- torical events are unique and hence unrepeat- able. If the historian elects to reside in the realm of "facts," however unique, he is mortgaged by their nature; if he chooses to explore the uni- verse of abstractions, even if confined to infer- ence from documents, he may transcend the particular only under the liabilities of relativ- ism. Facts are determinate; concepts the off- spring of reason. A part of the texture of these assumptions must be unraveled before our major problem can be resolved.I2 I1 BECKER, PP. 242-43; A. N.

To do so was to conform to the canons of science, to obey the injunctions of induction. The result for the historiography of the nineteenth century was the same as for the science of the sixteenth-the banishment of values from critical scholarship. Relativist aversion for value judgments is in part predicated upon a misunderstanding of the methods of physical science. The "facts" of the past-or the facts of any social situation are something other than the facts of science. The facts of science are held to be objective and certifiable in a way in which the facts of social life and individual behavior are not. Physical and astronomical concepts refer to concrete realities; ethical, logical, and mathematical concepts do not. The former are based upon tangible particulars; the latter upon abstrac- fi tions without physical referents. The source of confusion does not stem from hoary distinctions between particulars and universals; it derives rather from the notions of scientific method popularized by Bacon and Renaissance think- ers. Under Baconian precepts a precise distinc- tion existed between induction and deduction, between observation of the facts of nature stripped of valuational factors and all other varieties of phenomena. Concrete externalities, supremely neutral and completely indifferent to human considerations, when weighed, meas- ured, and analyzed in terms of their simple parts and compound structures, allegedly permitted investigators to induce hypotheses free of sub- jective elements. Deduction inevitably pro- ceeded from principles fashioned by human beings infected, to that extent, with human aspirations, motives, and ends. The facts of the external world were grasped, and in some mysterious way they spoke for themselves.I3 I3 M. R. COHEN, Preface to logic (New York, I944), P. I57; LEBERGOTT, loc. cit., p. 393; P. P.

It is important to note But the acquisition of "fact" is not the re- ward of patient and careful observation. Indeed a fact may be said to be a fact only after investi- gation, or, to borrow a distinction already well known, it is postanalytic rather than pre- analytic. And the beginning of wisdom, as Goethe once observed, is the recognition that every fact was once a theory. Facts in this sense are made; they are the products of intellectual effort. They do not, as Morris R. Cohen af- firmed, "stream into empty minds." He con- tinued: "We need ideas or hypotheses. It is only when we have an hypothesis that we have some- thing to look for. Without ideas, nature is only one big blooming confusion.''l4 But trafiic with ideas or concepts, it need hardly be added destroys the sacred character of concrete par- ticulars, rendering them as vulnerable to relativist attack as any other species of human intellectual endeavor. Yet if the kind of fact defined by the philos- ophers of science in earlier cellturies and the "scientific historians" who followed does not that if one of the implications of relativism is cor- rect, there could be no concept of historical causa- tion since the "structure" of events inheres in the historian rather than in the "facts" (ibid., PP. 34 and 35; Report, PP. 24, 25, 3I, 32, and I29). TEG- GART (p. 40), however, afErms that scientific move- ments of the latter nineteenth century had little influence on historiography. I4 COHEN, Prefacetologic, p. I5 7;andH.BLUMER, "Science without concepts," American journal of sociology, XXXVI (I93I), 520. J. DEWEY writes: "The performance of analytic observation . . . in- volves experiment; it does not precede it. And it is guided by some idea or suggestion in most cases" ("An analysis of reflective thought," Journal of philosophy, XIX [I922], 33; see also 29-38). See Re- port, PP. 26, 32, and reference there cited; and R. POPKIN, "Definitions in social science," Journal of philosophy, XL (I943), 49I-95. Priority of conceptu- alization obviously alters the nature of "fact" and its meaning. The sanctity of fact must derive from characteristics other than its primacy. While per- ception is thereby complicated, it is also rendered more meaningful. The alteration, moreover, demon- strates, as Cohen remarks (Preface to logic, p. I57), that "science is not a knowledge of mere particulars but rather a knowledge of the way in which classes of things are related." Consequently, "induction" is a process no longer definable in the older sense, and the supposed dichotomy between inductive and de- ductive methods, stemming from such assumptions, can no longer be made the basis of "primal fact" or the warrant for ostracizing value from scientific study.</page><page sequence="5">SOME PROBLEMS RAISED BY HISTORICAL RELATIVISM  exist, it is futile to seek it. Even if we are com- pelled by the nature of the process to commence with concepts, objective knowledge is not there- by rendered impossible. But the burden of scholarship has altered. Instead of striving to eliminate concepts in order to deal with "pure fact," scholars are charged with the necessity of sharpening concepts, of making them public, and of exposing them to constant examination. These liabilities may, to be sure, make knowl- edge more difiicult and less confident, but it will also make the knowledge gradually and pro- gressively achieved more adequate. Concepts must be made "scientific" in the sense that they demand explicit statement and restatement; they must be made open to repeated challenge which is the basic test of all hypothecation. Historical relativists are under further obli- gation. They must painstakingly distinguish between types of relativism between subjec- tive and objective relativism, for example-and face the consequences of altered intellectual standpoints with candor. Above all, they must render their assumptions as clear as language permits. Assuredly this is the most difiicult of tasks, but to shirk the attempt is to abdicate in favor of the absolutism of past certainties or to surrender to the subjectivism of individual judg- ments. "The formation of historical judg- ments," in Dewey's words, "lags behind that of physical judgments not only because of greater complexity and scantiness of data, but also because to a large extent historians have not developed the habit of stating to themselves and to the public the systematic conceptual structures which they employ in organizing their data to anything like the extent in which physical inquirers exposv their conceptual framework. Too often the conceptual frame- work is left as an implicit presupposition.''l5 Precise formulations and sharp distinctions assure the continuing clash of opposing doc- trines, indispensable to such intellectual assur- ance az we are permitted to enjoy. "Unless," Cohen warned, "we are willing to examine minutely and critically all the logically possible alternatives to the various accepted moral judgments with the same detachment with which the mathematician studies non-Euclid- ean geometries, the physicist non-Newtonian I5 DEWEY, Logic, p. 233; and Report, p. IO5, con- cerning need for definition of terms. BEARD leaves out of account the fact that if precision e2rists in certain areas of scholarship, it exists for historians too (Report, p. IO5); and BLUMER, loc. cit. mechanics, or the biologist new theories of path- 2I ology, we are advocates, not genuine philoso- phers."I6 Historians are not likely to achieve any greater degree of detachment than biolo- gists or philosophers, but emotional identifica- tion with a point of view can be exposed, if it cannot be dissolved, only by the competition of hypotheses in the arena of analysis. Relativists are therefore charged with meeting all the ob- jections directed against the more general philosophy upon which the inferences of rela- tivism rest. Specifically, they must answer to the bill of intellectual indictment drawn up against the instrumental-operational-functional theory of knowledge and must be prepared to meet, not to parry, the objections of its critics who proceed from different metaphysical as- sumptions. Is Dewey's philosophical system a methodology and not a metaphysic? Do the limitations of relativism apply only to time and place and not to meanings? Are value judgments mere "ejaculations of emation"; or are values capable of scientific validation? Values cannot be ostracized from the de- mocracy of learning without violence to its in- herent nature and final purpose. The effort to make the social studies chaste by eliminating human personalities must be appraised in the light of the specific compulsions and interests which dictated the attempt. Although scientific objectivity was created to eradicate value judg- ments, it was never more than an instrument or an operational technique. Subsequently it was identified with scholarly purpose, and a passion- ate neutrality became one of the supreme values of scientific inquiry. Whether history can be made "scientific" is no longer pertinent. Not only is the yearning for the halo of science, as Cohen often pointed out,I7 a question of honor and prestige, of status in the hierarchy of knowl- edge, but the consequence of a confusion of the nature of the method of physical science and the methods and the goals of history. To eliminate value judgments reflects a wish- ful urge no less confounding because compre- hensible. Relativist analysis makes them as I6 M. R.

His struggle to understand and control the world, given these assumptions, is not likely to be enhanced simply by ignoring their existence. And the dismissal of values means the dismissal of criteria of import from the province of exact and forthright criticism, a procedure fatal to meaningful scholarship. "Neutrality" is a tyrannous word which needs redefinition. "It is hard," remarks a contemporary philosopher in a comment equally applicable to any field of knowledge, "to see how a philosophy that is without sig- nificance can escape being an insignificant philosophy.''l8 The function of the historian is to cope with values, not to strive to circumvent them.I9 To choose between values in a given social context is a practical imperative.

Specifically, why do certain rela- tivists labor the point that history is devoid of meaning if a fuller knowledge is impossible? Knowledge partial, relative, conditioned-is none the less knowledge even if rigorously limited by the conditions imposed. Even opinion, so often maligned, is a type of knowl- edge. Some opinions, after all, are better than others. What in terms of knowledge so condi- tioned and limited are legitimate and realizable historical goals? Is it not reasonable to ask that the hypothetical response to this query should define the scope of the historical function? Clearly, however, nothing is gained by con- founding academic division of labor with aca- demic particularism. The historian is not obliged to explain the cosmos,2I but he cannot avoid a working knowledge of those aspects of the uni- verse which condition his activities. It is obvi- ous that the historical scholar cannot be an epistemologist, but it is equally obvious that he cannot elude a theory of knowledge. If special- ists who cultivate this rich philosophical field warn students of man and society not to invade it,22 they must assist social inquiry by sharing the harvest, by clarification, criticism, and all other kinds of co-operation. Nor will it longer suflice to assert that since knowledge of every- thing is beyond human realization, mastery of a smaller and smaller segment of it offers its own justification. To state such a truism in this manner is inept and misleading. The argument that we cannot know everything has induced us in practice to evade the issue of what we cannot afford to ignore if our efforts are to be signifi- cant. Historians cannot become psychologists, but no historian unless he accepts an interpre- tation of fact ne longer tenable and endorses the maxim that such facts speak for themselves- can avoid theories of human behavior, of the learning process, of the unconscious.

The record reveals that only those scholars hostile to logic have derogated reason and sought refuge in the particular; only those scientists wary of metaphysics have exalted "pure fact" and transformed empiricism into a credo; only those social students, aping scientific procedures mistakenly conceived, have made the very phrase "value judgment" a term of scorn and have placed value itself under a scientific ban. Logic, scientific method, psy- chology, and metaphysics are the true auxil- iaries of the historical discipline. Only scholars more concerned with prestige than with under- standing will question who is auxiliary to whom. Relativism has made value theory crucial to the success of historical scholarship. A hallowed principle of the historian's creed and a cardinal assumption of all learning must therefore be re- appraised; its opposite must be restored to a level of respectability suflicient at least to make it entertainable. Given value judgments, what kinds of meanings can the historical search yield? What levels of insights and meanings are realizable? What are the limits imposed by the nature of the materials and the nature of the historian which thereby condition the nature of the quest? The unexamined life is as worthless to the historian as to the philosopher. Both examine the compelling issues of existence, albeit on dif- ferent levels, in response to the deepest inner drives as well as in response to the deepest cul- tural drives. But neither historians nor philos- ophers can afford to "become contemporary students of the past rather than historically- minded students of the present."23 In the very 23 SEARS, loc. cit., p. 148. But the plea of Sears, a persistent theme of scholars if not of scholarship, does not answer the classical objections, given classic form in modern times by COHEN ("Phi- losophy in wartime an apologia," Faith of a liberal, pp. 84-92), that the scholar best serves society by remaining aloof from its most insistent problems. But no one has answered the questions "When" or act of examination both are making history in the act of reconstructing it, for the reconstruc- tion provides the clues to a newer past. If philosophers continue to ask "Why" long after others have ceased to do so, the historian is forced by the very nature of history constantly to review human values, to redefine human aspirations in the cold light of the possible, and to reformulate the grounds upon which they rest. History, as Ernest Cassirer said, is funda- mentally and irrevocably "anthropomorphic" and "to efface its human aspects would be to destroy its specific character and nature."24 For the historian the owl of Minerrra does not fly at twilight; the historian must always labor under the smarting rays of the sun, and what- ever the earthly metaphor, it is a physical fact that the sun never sets. This, in the stimulating words of John Dewey, is "a plea for the casting off of that intellectual timidity which hampers the wings of the imagination, a plea for speculative audacity, for more faith in ideas, [for] sloughing off a cowardly reliance upon those partial ideas which we are wont to give the name of facts."25 SARAH LAWRENCE COLLEGE "How much." Scant help is afforded by the dictum that, "in the last analysis," it is a matter of indi- vidual temperament. Perhaps it might not be un- wise to attack the problem frontally once again. What are the uses of knowledge; what is knowledge for? 24 E. CASSIRER, Essay on man (New Haven, I944), p. I9I- 25 J. DEWEY, Philosophy and civilization (New York, I93I), p. I2. The query propounded in the Report "What do we do now and how?" a ques- tion formulated in this instance by BEARD (P. 5), and one repeatedly asked since the beginning of scholarly self-examination, seems to me to be the most important statement in the book. It need hardly be said that the question cannot be answered without standards of import and value; and, if the more extreme views of relativism are granted, it cannot be answered at all. RELATIX7TSM AND THE USE OF HYPOTHESIS IN HISTORY WILLSON H. COATES A LTHOUGH Loewenberg is obviously not in- diSerent to the philosophical obligations of historians, he has, it is clear, been concerned in this inquiry with what historians actually do. This is indeed a philosophical question and one with which the professional philosopher is occu- pied.I It is the kind of philosophical question which, because of doubts about the authenticity of historical knowledge, cannot with impunity x Among many American philosophers evidently concerned with this question in their writings are Morris R.
