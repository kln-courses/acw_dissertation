 Europe: Early Modem and Modem 
  
  
 cence of the earth and the motion of the sun as 
 concessions to ignorance, and the Protestant contro- 
 versialist Andreas Osiander, who saw Copernicus's 
 book through the press, contributed to it an unsigned 
 preface warning readers against seeking truth in as- 
 tronomy, "lest you go away from this book a greater 
 fool than when you came to it." 
 Howell's contribution is an analysis of the positions 
 of moderate realists who sought solid principles on 
 which to unify their knowledge and beliefs. Many of 
 them tried to buttress and refine their natural philos- 
 ophy by reference to scripture. Howell points to Tycho 
 Brahe and Johannes Kepler. Brahe worked out a 
 compromise so adroit that the Jesuits adopted it: by 
 placing all the planets in motion around the sun, and 
 the sun (and moon) in orbit around the stationary 
 earth, Tycho had a system with most of the advantages 
 of Copernicus's and many fewer openings for the 
 literal scripturalist or dogmatic Aristotelian. As for 
 Kepler, his numerological expressions of his belief in a 
 triune God and a world created by weight, number, 
 and measure inspired him to find mathematical rela- 
 tions that, in Isaac Newton's hands, would underpin a 
 new world view. 
 These examples concern the protagonists of the 
 scientific revolution. Howell has looked at secondary 
 actors as well; for example, on the Protestant side were 
 the mathematician Georg Joachim Rheticus, who 
 helped pry Copernicus's manuscript from him, and 
 Christoph Wittich, who professed Cartesian cosmology 
 in the Netherlands. Rheticus upheld creation but 
 otherwise found nothing in scripture, properly con- 
 strued, to constrain his cosmology. Wittich wrote 
 widely and subtly about accommodation and ended 
 with a double fragmentation of knowledge: scripture 
 and natural science differ both in content and in 
 method, the one concerned with salvation and sense 
 perception, the other with reason and natural knowl- 
 edge. On the Catholic side, Howell discusses Libert 
 Froidmont, professor of theology in Louvain and the 
 successor of Cornelius Jansen, and the maverick Do- 
 minican Tommaso Campanella, who refined his epis- 
 temology as a prisoner of the Inquisition. Froidmont 
 applied accommodation to God's anthropomorphic 
 attributes but not to cosmology: had Joshua been a 
 Copernican, he would have issued his command to the 
 earth. Joshua was not a Copernican; Froidmont would 
 not be one either. In contrast, Campanella undertook 
 to improve the fit between natural philosophy and 
 theology begun by St. Thomas Aquinas. An apparently 
 patent passage in Deuteronomy links the sun, moon, 
 mountains, and hills (Deut. 33:13-15). Campanella 
 applied Galileo's discovery of mountains in the moon 
 to find a deeper meaning in the text and to censure the 
 theologians who had censured Galileo: "after so many 
 centuries he vindicates the Scriptures from ridicule 
 and distortion by observable evidence." 
 For Brahe and Kepler, the desire to preserve old 
 scripture and embrace new philosophy was a source of 
 creativity in natural science. Wittich found the combi- 
  
  
 nation untenable and compartmentalized his truths. 
 Froidmont, who had inclined toward Copernicus's 
 ideas before the Holy Office's ruling of 1616, preferred 
 dogmatism to relativism. Rheticus, Campanella, and 
 the many others Howell treats complete his demon- 
 stration that the usual dichotomy drawn between 
 friends and foes of Copernicus does not do justice to 
 the inventiveness of the human mind.

 Alcohol, Sex, and Gender in Late 
 Medieval and Early Modern Europe. (Early Modern 
 History: Society and Culture.) New York: Palgrave. 
 2001. Pp. x, 200. 
 A. Lynn Martin documents and interrelates the sexual 
 double standard and the drinking double standard in 
 England, France, and Italy from 1300 to 1700. Premod- 
 ern Europeans expected women to preserve chastity 
 and secondarily sobriety. His book provides abundant 
 evidence that men were more in need of the prescrip- 
 tion for sobriety. Martin judiciously examines studies 
 of household accounts and statistical charts of drinking 
 consumption, yet concludes that inebriation was a 
 common popular condition in premodern Europe. 
 While women brewed much of the ale, with the 
 dominance of beer in the sixteenth century, male 
 brewing became more dominant. The daily lives of 
 women,.as well as of men, included ale and beer 
 drinking in the north and wine drinking in the south. 
 Martin argues that premodern Europe was more 
 heavily inebriated than modern Europe; and while 
 anecdotes of disorderly behavior fill his book, his 
 overall view is that male and female alcohol consump- 
 tion led to "social integration and jollification" (p. 
 118). He portrays a world where alcohol marked 
 lifecycle events and civic and religious ritual, served as 
 a pharmacy and as source of nourishment, and con- 
 tributed to the integration of social groups. He might 
 have discussed the Catholic Church limiting the wine 
 during the Eucharist to the priesthood, and the Hus- 
 site to Protestant sharing of the wine with the laity. He 
 does discuss the Puritan disapproval of alehouses. 
 In most of his chapters, Martin's sources are pre- 
 scriptive literature and fictional sources, as well as 
 court cases. He includes women authors Christine de 
 Pizan, Margery Kempe, Marguerite de Navarre, and 
 Madame de Sevign6 and is careful to indicate that 
 most of the time he is documenting men's views and 
 expectations. In particular, Martin elaborates the pop- 
 ular images of drunken men and drunken women: the 
 man as either violent and sexually aggressive or impo- 
 tent in a stupor, and the woman as unruly or promis- 
 cuous. Men perceived men drinking as forging bonds 
 of identity and solidarity and women drinking as 
 encouraging insubordination to men. Male stereotypes 
 of unruly women included the gossiper, the scold, the 
 infant-killer, and the witch. With regard to images of

 the violent man, there are cases of arguments over the
 bill, male rivalry, and desire to defend honor of class,
 area, or individual. Protests against taxes contributed
 to male violence according to court cases, as well as in
 literary stereotypes.
 It was widely believed that drinking led to sexual
 acts. Utilizing distinctions relevant to campus life
 today, Martin gives examples of uninhibited drunken
 sexuality, nonconsenting sex, and rape with violence.
 The seventeenth century witnessed a shift from public
 festive drinking occasions with both genders and all
 ages present to men drinking in alehouses and taverns,
 often amid prostitutes (respectable women were there
 only in daytime, and more likely in England than Italy
 or France).
 While there is a small literature on the good men
 married to unruly drunken women, there is a very large
 body of literature and court evidence on a husband
 depleting family budget, committing adultery, and
 committing violence upon his wife. Martin exposes the
 premodern acceptance of wife-beating and shows that
 alcohol was sometimes the cause then as now of abuse
 or murder. He surmises that alcohol more usually
 aided marital bonding, as in the Anglo-Saxon cere-
 mony of wife idyllically greeting husband with a cup.
 Previous books on popular drinking behavior in
 early modern Europe include Peter Clark, The English
 Alehouse: A Social History, 1200-1830 (1983); Thomas
 Brennan, Public Drinking and Popular Culture in Eigh-
 teenth-Century Paris (1988); and Judith M. Bennett,
 Ale, Beer, and Brewsters in England: Women's Work in a
 Changing World (1996). Martin's book might be an
 inspiration for further cross-cultural research on
 drinking patterns and power relationships; for exam-
 ple, Martin might have related his book to studies on
 the influence on the indigenous peoples of the Amer-
 icas and elsewhere of European alcohol consumption
 and trade. By focusing explicitly on the relationships of
 alcohol to sexuality and violence, Martin contributes to
 the history of sexuality, the history of gender relations,
 and to public policy today.

 RICHARD HELGERSON. Adulterous Alliances: Home,
 State, and History in Early Modem European Drama
 and Painting. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.
 2000. Pp. 238.
 As recent exhibitions, historical novels, and scholarly
 ventures amply demonstrate, the early modern home is
 a hot topic. The early modern Dutch home, whose
 order and disorder were so frequently thematized by
 seventeenth-century artists, holds special appeal. The
 well-tempered maintenance of this arena, largely oc-
 cupied by women and children, has drawn huge audi-
 ences at recent museum shows. Seventeenth and eigh-
 teenth-century dollhouses-replicas in miniature of
 stately Dutch homes, replete with copies of actual
 furnishings-in such collections as the Rijksmuseum,
 Amsterdam, are a high point of most visits. Within the
 scholarly realm, the domestic arena represented so
 frequently and compellingly by painters has undergone
 an important shift: whereas, a century ago, the interi-
 ors and activities depicted were held to comprise so
 many records of daily life, recent studies by Martha
 Hollander, Simon Schama, and Mariet Westermann,
 among others, view the Dutch home as a space con-
 structed by way of such pictures, which in their views
 articulate social, civic, political, and gender relations.
 Schama's influential The Embarrassment of Riches: An
 Interpretation of Dutch Culture in the Seventeenth Cen-
 tury (1987), for example, holds that the Dutch home
 was a microcosm of the Dutch Republic, and the
 cultivation of the domestic arena was one way of
 carrying out civic duties. Such active interest in the
 lineaments of home and its meanings should only
 amplify the impact of Richard Helgerson's rich, nim-
 ble, and far-reaching study of early modern represen-
 tations of the home.
 Helgerson's subject is a central one, and his purview
 is admirably broad. In the course of six chapters, he
 surveys what he takes to be a common preoccupation
 of English, Spanish, and French drama as well as of
 Dutch painting of the early modern period: the rela-
 tions among home, state, and history. Herein lie the
 adulterous alliances of the title. Helgerson presents his
 study as an "episodic macrohistory that stretches over
 two centuries, four countries, and a large number of
 plays and paintings" (p. 3). Beginning with the anon-
 ymous sixteenth-century English domestic drama, Ar-
 den of Faversham (1592), he leads the reader along a
 route that includes the figure of Jane Shore, The Merry
 Wives of Windsor, Dutch seventeenth-century genre
 paintings, Spanish peasant drama, and eighteenth-
 century French bourgeois drama. All of these works
 "put [the non-aristocratic] home into a significant and
 signifying narrative relation with the monarchic or
 potentially monarchic state" (p. 3). Many of them do
 so through the figure of a sexually predatory intrud-
 er-the lover, the king, Falstaff, soldiers-who threat-
 ens to or actually does disrupt the domestic balance
 and, by so doing, plays out the adulterous alliance
 between home and state.
 Contrary to general expectation, Helgerson main-
 tains, the representational space distinct from history
 painting or narratives of the great affairs of state-the
 home, the company of women rather than court or
 battlefield-is not immune to and indeed becomes the
 locus of the elaboration of questions about the relation
 between the individual and the state. "Domestic drama
 and domestic painting emerged as a by-product of
 early modern state formation," Helgerson argues,
 "and defined themselves by their difference from the
 newly invented or newly revived genres of state: history
 painting, tragedy, historical drama, and history itself'
 (p. 6). This holds true across the range of material and
 for the variety of political backdrops he surveys; in the
 early modern period, the domestic is the political.
