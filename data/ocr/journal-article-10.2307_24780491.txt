<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Social Other: Don Juan and the Genesis of the Self KIM IAN MICHASIW In "Autobiography as De-Facement," Paul de Man observes that "autobiography ... is not a genre or a mode, but a figure of reading or of understanding that occurs, to some degree, in all texts" (70). That is, autobiography is generated between the reader and the text; the reader projects an author through the lens of the specific work. Certain texts—titled Confessions, Life and Opinions, An Apology—are openly offered as lenses of this sort. At the opposite pole are works offered as pure fiction or poetry, which condemn to chilly exile those who read through texts for evidence of their authors' lives. More intriguing, perhaps, or at least more problematic, are those literary works that articulate consciously the contractual arrangement between reader, text and author. The roman à clef, for instance, functions as an entirely different semantic field for those within the charmed circle of interpretation and those without. No density of scholarly notation will permit the late twentieth-century reader to assume, even toward so "transparent" a work as Thomas Love Peacock's Nightmare Abbey, the stance available to certain privileged early readers. Our capacity to read that work's Mr. Cypress is limited by our knowledge of Byron (Cypress's original), by our capacity to imagine the Byron who acted on the mental stage of the literati's mind in 1818, and by our nagging sense that, urbane, intelligent and sophisticated as it is, Nightmare Abbey requires a mode of reading that is tainted with anti-esthetic vulgarity. More complicated still is the case of the popular author of scandalous reputation whose works' appeal is all but inseparable from the readers' desire to read through Mosaic 22/2 0027-1276-89/010029-20S01.50©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">30 Kim Ian Michasiw the text to the life implied. This is not the occasion to consider the reasons for Byron's fame, but we cannot deny that at least some members of Byron's audience saw his works as a way to knowing their author and scanned the adventures of Childe Harold, Manfred, et al. for signs of the author's secret sins or guilt. Neither can we dispute Byron's awareness of his audience's appetite for scandal, nor his alternation between pandering to and railing against that appetite. As W.W. Robson suggests, Byron, unlike many poets, "is perpetually aware... that he has a reader." At the same time, "his friendship with that reader" does little or nothing to restrain his "aristocratic anarchism and will to épater le bourgeois" (93).1 Separating Byron's situation from those of the formal autobiographer and the author who "unwittingly" discloses the self, and thus prefiguring our contem porary enmeshment in celebrity cultism, is Byron's conscious manipulation of his audience's curiosity. This attempt is both encouraged and hobbled by the unknow ability of the hermeneutical procedures this curiosity employs. Readerly gossip mongering becomes a rhetorical resource, but one of uncertain potential and potency. Jay A. Ward suggests that "Contemporary reviewers were almost totally unable to separate their opinions of Byron the man from the opinions of his works The man was known to live immorally; therefore, his works must necessarily be immoral also" ( 14-15). Keith Walker, however, observes that Byron the man meant different things to different readers: "those who met Byron expressed their surprise that he was not like his heroes, while those who did not know him, wrote of him as if he were Lara, Conrad, Harold, or Cain" (25). In the earlier, "Byronic" works, that potential is tapped most consistently by means of the shifting elision of author and hero. Childe Harold is Byron, we say, casually asserting an identity that problematizes entirely the copula. If the two figures are set beside one another—Harold from the poem, Byron from his letters and journals, from the recollections of his contemporaries —what about either suggests their common identity? Perhaps the safest ground is tropological, the discovery of parallel or homologous patterns of figuration. Harold and Byron style themselves similarly, but is this more than a play of the linguistic light? It is possible that the limits of figurative language leave all self-stylings somehow analogous. Yet the simple equation above is, in some sense, true. Or rather, it has had the effect of truth on those readers and purchasers who transformed Byron from an obscure young man to a figure in the world, a sign, a signature (even in afterhours dance clubs in 1987).2 Between Childe Harold and the opening of Don Juan, Byron effects a series of formal, temporal, generic displacements upon his characteristic protagonists, displacements possible only because an assumed identification of Byron and his heroes acts as a rest point. It would be useful, perhaps, to test readers entirely unfamiliar with Byron, to have these groups read The Giaour, Lara and Manfred in the hopes of gauging how much our sense of the Byronic hero is a "biographical" imposition upon an heterogeneous body of material. This imposition is biographical rather than heuristic or polemical because it asserts homogeneity rather than denies heterogeneity. The Byronic hero or "Byron," as this figure might be labeled, may collapse differences but it does so by positing a coherent being toward whicn a variety of signifiers, coyly or adamantly, gesture.</page><page sequence="3">Byron and Autobiography 31 I will try to demonstrate in this essay that Byron discovers in "Byron" a socially created figure too like himself for comfort. Whether or not the individual has an essential, pre-social being is not at issue. What is important is that the English Romantics wanted to believe in such a being. The essentialist faith of Romantic ontology is disturbed by the thought that the self is not self-originating. Romantic fiction's consistent recourse to confessional tropes that defend the self against public opinion (Caleb Williams, Frankenstein, Hogg's Justified Sinner) indicates a need to defend the self against charges of social construction. That is, for most Romantics, social controls on the individual are post facta impositions against which the sovereign subject struggles. Byron's relation to the social is rather more complicated, given his refusal to accept entirely the model of an essential subject onto which the vulgar fictions of society are pasted. Byron may complain that he has been misunderstood but this misunderstanding has been, to some degree, manufactured, received, articulated. As Jerome J. McGann notes, "the poet's public protests against those critics who read his earlier work autobiographically were partly well taken, for of course his kind of imaginative autobiography did not normally work itself out in a simple correspondence between 'real' and 'poetic' events At the same time he was uneasy with his tales because they seemed constantly to 'run into reality' and to encourage autobiographical readings" (Context 40).3 Moreover, Byron, with his self-conscious adherence to "pre-Romantic" ideals, is never so secure in his rejection of the self's social determination as Shelley is in his claim that "no person can be truly dishonoured by the act of another" (Cenci 276). Separating the essential from the acquired within a metaphorical structure of inside/outside or form/deformation is not an option Byron considers open. His heroes are products; they move in response to determinate stimuli, usually transgressions of some sort. That is, their essential beings are deformed by a social or legal force. In this "deformation," however, they discover something that looks strikingly like a true self. Thus social mediations and the essential core of being are not so easily dissociated as a Shelleyan enthusiast for the self's purity might hope. There are ways to weasel out of this problem. One is to view social life as a sort of language into which the essential being translates its aboriginal impulses—the greater spirit tending to find some mode of successful expression. Byron, however, is too firmly Aristotelian to embrace this possibility: one is as one acts and in acting the self achieves itself. Manfred, Conrad, Harold et al. know who they are in rela tion, or rather in opposition, to social codes, which is not to say that their beings are defined only negatively (or are experienced merely as negations). Manfred's courtesy when addressing the Chamois Hunter and the Abbot of St. Maurice sug gests a continuing sense of partial integration with human society (especially when set against his arrogant rudeness to spirits). In Manfred's sequential rejection of natural and supernatural spirits, he effects an exaltation not only of the individual human, but also of the social, from which he persists in being excluded. Manfred's figuration of himself as synecdoche and scapegoat is not our present concern but this splitting within the self finds its fuller reflection in the ontological crisis that afflicts Don Juan's narrator or "Byron" in that poem's Canto 11.</page><page sequence="4">32 Kim lan Michasiw * * * In Byron's poems a dual movement discovers itself. Paul West offers one formulation of this movement: "Reduce everything [Byron] ever wrote, and you will find an essential act of repulsion: either self-emptying into a persona, or a repudiation. He pushes away what he is; he repudiates even the persona of Don Juan. He has the insecure person's fierce need of elimination And yet, by a method approaching 'double think,' he seeks to eliminate this lust for elimination" (12-13). Although repudiation is a key element in Byron's creative method, West's suggestion too readily lumps Don Juan with the rest of the canon. It also assumes an essential (and insecure) self that is engaged in an ill-advised program of self defense. If we reverse West's formula, and suggest that the poet is attempting to create an essential self, free from social determination, in which he cannot quite believe, then we may be in a better position to understand both the poet's repudiations and the oscillations in his relationship to his readers. It is in these relations that Byron's doubleness is most apparent. First, there is a conscious project—from Childe Harold on—of employing the audience's desire to read biographically as a rhetorical resource. This method serves, at least in part, as a defense against the suspicion that Byron is what his audience has made him, that his most authentic being exists in the reception of his poems. Secondly, we may observe a later-developing recognition that a popular author's public reception recapitulates ontogeny. That is, in being made by his public, Byron re-experiences the social formation of the self against which romantic manifestos of ontological autonomy lie. These movements coexist with, and perhaps spawn, the polar alternation of selves that appears in Byron's personae. While we tend to recall the splendid egoists of the plays and the Oriental Tales, another potential is always present, as trace, or ghost or Lake Poet. If we take Manfred as paradigmatic figure and recall precisely how he defines himself, two perceptions force themselves upon us. The first is that Manfred, like Wordsworth, is a subject created by memory. His primal desire is oblivion, self-oblivion. He demands that the spirits deliver him from his memory, a process that will decompose his identity, open him afresh to the stimuli of the world from which his selfhood has alienated him. The memory at the center of Manfred's identity is that of transgression—sister-incest—a crime that separates him from nature and humanity. In believing that his crime has this effect, Manfred subscribes to the notion of transgression that Michel Foucault dismisses as the "repressive hypothesis" (Sexuality 36-49). Yet Foucault himself, earlier in his career, proposes a seductive figuration of transgression in terms that might be Manfred's own: "Transgression is an action which involves the limit, the narrow zone of a line where it displays the flash of its passage, but perhaps also its entire trajectory, even its origin" ("Transgression" 33-34). The line crossed is that of origin, the origin of the self. Thus, while Manfred claims to desire oblivion, he knows that his crime and its memory have served him well; they have made of him his own idol.</page><page sequence="5">Byron and Autobiography 33 I have known The fulness of humiliation, for I sunk before my vain despair, and knelt To my own desolation. (II.iv.39-42) Manfred confirms the sovereignty of the self through this return to aboriginal sin. His transgression becomes the site of self-origin and both marks him out and defends him from change. Yet, and this is the second constant, transgression is inevitably artificial. There must be law, a socially mandated code, before there can be transgression. In the state of nature, or in Eden before the arborial interdict, there is no line to cross. Thus the marking out of an autonomous self is possible only by grace of a social code which preexists the individual and has, at best, a dubious theological authority for its transcendental claims. The incest that defines Manfred is, in Cain, the normal order of society. Cain and Abel have no one to marry but their sisters. This situation is, however, as Lucifer explains to Cain's sister-wife, Adah, temporary. Adah: Cain! Walk not with this spirit Bear with me what we have borne, and love me—I Love thee. Lucifer: More than thy mother, and thy sire? Adah: I do. Is that a sin, too? Lucifer: No, not yet; It one day will be in your children. (I.i.858-62) In his role as heir to the Enlightenment, Byron invokes a standard argument against transcendental morality. Only one transgression—murder—survives the scrutiny of the enlightened eye. This crime, however, has been worn out by history, by the enthusiastic carnage of patriotic wars. Murder marks Cain and his children, but what meaning has this sign after Waterloo? The alternative is the unfixed self, an identity that may be transformed, shuffled, replaced, that is situational, temporary. Byron's most positive portrait of this potential is that of Junius in The Vision of Judgment, a passage whose centrality in Romantic investigations of ontology has been underrated. "The man was a phantasmagoria in / Himself," a shifting shape onto which the onlookers project some firm identity. When the shade is called to bear witness against George the Third, the spectators see in it the image of their own fantasies: "and one could swear / He was his father: upon which another / Was sure he was his mother's cousin's brother"—which confusion prompts an hypothesis from the poem's "I": "'Tis, that what Junius we are wont to call / Was really, truly, nobody at all" (77, 76, 80). The theory is urbanely proposed but this serves only to obscure what, for Byron, is a serious possibility. The author may be only a fictional effect of the text. In the same way, the author's sense of self may be but a reflection of his readers' desires. Junius's case invokes the possibility in its most positive form, in unified texts that conjure a stalwart, oppositional author. To Byron, who elsewhere expresses distaste that Sir Philip Francis had been "proved" to have written Junius's letters.</page><page sequence="6">34 Kim Ian Michasiw {Letters 3: 124-25), the letters are the effect of a single steadfast voice, the voice of a being far greater than Sir Philip. At the opposite pole, however, the absence of identity spawns the multi-scribbling Southey and the poetic man-midwife, the placeman Wordsworth. The Vision of Judgment's Southey presents a firm face, an appearance of stable identity: The varlet was not an ill-favour'd knave; A good deal like a vulture in the face, With a hook nose and a hawk's eye, which gave A smart and sharper-looking sort of grace To his whole aspect... (stanza 94) This face, however, is an empty sign. Southey, the revolutionary author of Wat Tyler, has lived to sing the praises of tyrants. Like Wordsworth, he had his price and reformed according to society's approved model. The implication is that, without a fixed identity, however created, the self will be scripted by a corrupting social order. Yet, given Byron's suspicions that any identity is mutable unless fixed by the memory of transgression and that transgression itself is socially created, there may be no defense against the colonization of the self by the social order. This is the problem confronted by the popular poet whose being as poet is centered on his relations to the author created by his readers. Implicit in my own phrasing of this problem is a fairly naîve dualism, a model of a split subject that grants priority to a Byron preexisting social molestation. This is, I think, a model to which the poet takes defensive recourse, at least until the later Cantos of Don Juan. It is not dissimilar to the peculiar subterfuges encountered in Shelley's "Defense of Poetry." There the author asserts both the poet's immersion in and separation from social and historical determination (12). Shelley posits a poetic personality that preexists history but is not exempt from historical deformation, a deformation occuring in the translation from transhistorical inspiration to inscription. With language and metalinguistic structures of theme and conscious morality come the deformities of social concession. In corrupt times these mediations produce monsters. The example of Shelley is important, both because Shelley stands as the pre eminent English spokeman for the sovereign ego and because he was another of Byron's readers (see Robinson), one who misread at an oblique, but covertly complementary, angle to the popular view. Shelley consciously attempts to impose upon Byron the form/deformation model suggested by the "Defense." He proposes a fiction that has obvious appeals, of a great spirit nearly ruined by his succumbing to popular appetites. This narrative dies hard, and has been reinvigorated by Philip Martin's recent study of Byron's relations to his readers and critics. Martin's innovation is to cast Shelley as one of Byron's most damaging misreaders, one who encouraged delusions of a high prophetic calling (148-50). Yet the model proposed by Shelley and revamped by Martin presupposes both a seduced innocence on Byron's part and the high Romantic notion that poetic identity was separable from the social determinations that create the poet's being in the world. In Byron's case neither supposition is justified. It may be that his pride in being</page><page sequence="7">Byron and Autobiography 35 an aristocrat, in his social origin, made him aware of the bourgeois taint to dogmas of the autonomous poetic identity. The self-made poet, like the self-made man, appears a climber to a Lord. Bourgeois ideologues, like Hazlitt, decried Byron's inability to forget his class (125-26). Yet this position, which has been revived recently by J. Michael Robertson, is tenable only by those who regard as neutral their middle-class assumptions. Moreover, Byron's annunciations of surprise at his audience's response notwithstanding, proofs of his innocence of growing up in public are hard to come by. His being an author, like his being a peer, is socially constructed; like his heroes, he has been made by forces beyond his control. This process is represented by the passivity, not only of Don Juan, but of almost all of Byron's heroes. Juan's passivity only magnifies Conrad's waverings (in The Corsair) between compulsive aggression and service as the manikin onto which Medora's and Gulnare's fantasies are projected. In this, the Byronic hero reenacts the famous poet Byron's own formation which, in turn, recapitulates the formation of any human identity. The various challenges made by the Oriental Tales to the reader's imagined Byron are then formations that strive to defend the poet against the social determination of the author but, in doing so, confirm it. Structures of outrage serve only to keep the poet one step ahead. Like the face of Junius, or like Southey's multi-faced Satan, the poetic figure changes, transfigures itself. These transformations are, however, defensive gestures, keeping at bay the collapse of poetic identity into the script written upon a human life by the socially encoded desire of the other. * * * Byron's career, to the point of his commencing Don Juan, suggests that there are but two modes of identity open to him as author. The first is the absolute egoism, secured by the memory of transgression, that marks the heroes of the Oriental Tales. This identity may be gained at the expense of purposive activity in the world, may construct a passive individual, but it secures a core of being that is immune to change. The second is the total dissolution of personality for which Manfred longs. Neither of these, however, guarantees autonomy. Who would Manfred be in a world lacking the incest taboo? Incest is a sin only because the prevailing order has declared it one; no transgression is more than the crossing of a social boundary. Thus, the poet as rebel or pariah exists parasitically at best, playing out a society's bad dream of itself. The poet without a self, on the other hand, has no defense against social modification. Southey's hollow selflessness (which looks very much like selfishness) obliges him to change color at the world's whim. Even Junius, who may have no being at all, finds his works eclipsed by the mystery shrouding their origin, a mystery that breeds ascriptions. The words are tyrannized by an author whom readers, and even non-readers, have invented. In beginning Don Juan, Byron addresses the problem of his own identity as author more directly than he has hitherto. He recognizes that this new work will be read as autobiography and moves gradually to the secondary realization that his shifting personae have only deferred the problem of his implication in the society</page><page sequence="8">36 Kim Ian Michasiw which has both exiled him and hailed him as the greatest living poet. His popularity cannot be dismissed as accident; the author of the Oriental Tales cannot be written off as a hack totally unlike the true Byron. We are back with de Man's observation that autobiography is an effect of reading, save that now we must number Byron among his own readers. De Man's rejection of any contractual relation between author, text and reader does not, however, apply here. Within the contractual model, "the reader becomes the judge, the policing power in verifying the authenticy of the signature and the consistency of the signer's behaviour, to the extent to which he respects or fails to honour the contractual agreement he has signed" (71-72). De Man goes on to argue that this "contract" folds back into tropology, that both consistency and authenticity are tropic effects and that the reader assumes an authority that collapses into a structure of tropes identical to those assembled into the imagined author. To whatever degree we allow this objection, it still floats above the workaday relations between reader, author and text. The reader constructs on certain principles, seizing upon socially mandated materials and assembling these in conformity to equally coded notions of personal identity. The author, accepting this inevitability, can intervene by providing materials that are better adapted to one form of construction than another. Moreover, the author has equal access to the building code and may present, prefab, a socially assimilable construct, or one that obliges the reader to work upon resistant or intractable stuffs. Even without accepting fully a contractual model, we are obliged to recognize the potential for some curbing of the tropological drift, especially in cases of overt denial of the identity between poet and narrator. Byron's denial of this identity takes several forms in the opening Cantos of Don Juan. The intrusive "I" of Canto 1 assures us that "I never married" (1. 53), an assertion that follows closely descriptions of marital discord and ugly divorce enough like Byron's own marital career to prompt complaints from the poet's friend and agent John Cam Hobhouse (Don Juan 675 and plate 11). If Hobhouse thought the details of Don Jose's marriage to Donna Inez too like autobiography, there is no reason to doubt other readers making the connection. The narrator's denial of marriage is, therefore, also a denial, however specious, of identity with Byron. So too are those passages insisting on the narrator's Spanish descent and his residence in Seville (11. 23-24, 33-35, 51-53, 203). These passages suggest that the Spanish Gentleman introduced as the narrator in the prose Preface is not without reflection in the poem proper. McGann's edition of Don Juan relegates this Preface to the status of unincorporated material and it does so on the unimpeachable grounds that the piece was never published in Byron's lifetime and that it is demonstrably incomplete (xx-xxi). On the other hand, that Byron composed the Preface at all suggests that he had considered creating a fully characterized fictional narrator for his epic. We might then consider briefly the effect that such a creation would have had on readers of Don Juan, an effect that it has had on those of us who first read the poem in Pratt and Steffan's or Marchand's edition. In the Preface, Byron parodies Wordsworth's introduction to "The Thorn" and produces a middle-aged Spaniard</page><page sequence="9">Byron and Autobiography 37 as narrator. He challenges his reader to read through or past a fiction that is imposing both in elaboration and detail: "The Reader... is requested to suppose... that the following epic narrative is told by a Spanish Gentleman in a village in the Sierra Moreno on the road between Monasterio and Seville—sitting at the door of a posada with the Curate of the hamlet on his right hand, a segar in his mouth, a jug of Malaga or perhaps 'right Sherris' before him on a small table, containing the relics of an olla-podrida" [and so on for another twenty-seven lines] (Don Juan McGann ed. 82-83). Had Byron retained the Preface, with its difficult request that the reader sup pose "as much of this as the utter impossibility of such a supposition will admit," and its addition of an interpolating English editor, the reader's position would be awkward indeed. To whom does one assign the pronoun "I"? To read the poem as autobiography, the Spanish narrator and the English editor must be dismissed, unless we compromise and consider the latter to be Byron, a program that solves nothing. To read past these figures would, however, trangress the contractual arrangement proposed by the author of the Preface. The same Preface, however, also assures us that imagining the Spanish narrator it proposes is an "utter impossibility." Why this is so is unclear. Supposing a narrator who is not the author is a difficult task only for those readers primed to regard a poem as the immediate expression of its author. The proposal of the Spanish gentleman emphasizes the reader's desire to brush aside personae and to under stand the poem's "I" as the poet's. Even if we attempt to read obediently, as have some readers since the Preface's "restoration," the fading of the Spanish Gentleman cannot be denied. His presence thins until it vanishes. Yet, even as this disappearing act is taking place, the tricks of rhetoric that sculpt his voice remain. In rejecting the Preface, while retaining hints of the Spanish narrator, Byron makes more subtle, but no less important, the task of assigning a determinate origin to the poem's "I." Without a fictional narrator, the "I" must be the poet's, but in what sense can Byron write "I never married"? Moreover, the notion of the poet is a readerly creation. The reader is tempted to impose a referent upon the "I." The temptation takes the form of the "I" 's consistent self-references, his open likes and dislikes, his aphorisms and opinions. So distinctive a voice (or pattern of preferred tropes) must emerge from somewhere, but this location is never specified. Byron appears to be acceding to the reader's demand that he write in and of himself, but he is merely opening a possibility, a space. The erased presences of the Spanish Gentleman and his English editor remain. Like the Ghost of the Black Friar, they describe a narratological space that may be made flesh by someone's desires. The Duchess Fitz-Fulke fleshes the Friar; Don Juan's reader invents a Byron to play the poem's "I." Our complicity is as overt here as it is in Sterne's non-description of the Widow Wadman. Byron constructs a blank space at the point of the text's origin into which we place our portrait of the poet, a move that the author both necessitates and rebukes. Canto 14's notice of autobiographical content also warns the reader that the author neither tells all nor writes in a way that all may interpret.</page><page sequence="10">38 Kim Ian Michasiw "Haud ignara loquor." these are Nugae, "quarum Pars parvafui" but still Art and part. Now I could much more easily sketch a harem, A battle, wreck, or history of the heart Than these things; and besides, I wish to spare 'em, For reasons which I choose to keep apart. "Vetabo Cereris sacrum qui vulgaret"— Which means that vulgar people must not share it. (14.21) This, as Cecil Lang has pointed out, is Don Juan's most explicit statement of autobiographical intent (168). It is also among the poem's more defiant assertions of its autobiographical illegibility. Byron concludes the following stanza, "there is much which could not be appreciated / In any manner by the uninitiated" (emphasis mine). Yes, the English episodes do describe a part of the "I'"s life, but no, they cannot be understood by the vulgar, the uninitiated. And what reader may claim exemption from these castes? The passage is more complex still. The Latin quotation, unintelligible to many in itself, is slightly changed from its original in the Aeneid, substituting ignara for Virgil's ignota, adding nugae (trivialities) and changing magna (great) to parva (small). The initiated reader is one who may both translate and note small transformations. These qualifications aid little, however, for the descriptions remain partial and artificial. Moreover, although the English scenes are true in a way that the earlier portions of the poem—"a harem, battle.. ."—are not, they are related evasively, in code. We read, then, a roman à clef from which we are excluded but which cannot be read properly without breaking the code. Byron's history of the ton and of the part he played in it is further compared to the history of Freemasons which, the narrator insists, is both "lower'd" and "leaven'd." The implication of this simultaneous falling and rising is, to me at least, undecidable. A canceled earlier version is somewhat more intelligible: Lowered—heightened—like a history of Freemasons From which you no more gather what is real Nor from the Argonautic voyage of Jason's. (Variorum 3.419) The real exists but only in masked form; the secret society and its secret rituals are reflected by the transformed surface of the official version but no outside reader can know the prospect from which to view the real. Only the initiated may assume so privileged a vantage on the Grand Arcanum. Yet what does it mean to be initiated, to have undergone the rites of passage and entry? * * * To be initiated is to be begun. In raising the question of initiation, Don Juan's English Cantos relocate the question of origin posed by the poem's narrator. The problem is no longer how the reader constructs an identity for the narrative "I," but rather, how that "I" understands its own coming into being. The progress of Don</page><page sequence="11">Byron and Autobiography 39 Juan has demonstrated, and remonstrated against, the reader's constructive urges. And, to the end of Canto 8, the poem's deployment of the narrator suggests a satisfaction with being one step ahead of the audience. In Canto 9 and in the English Cantos, however, the focus shifts and the poem's "I" commences an enquiry into its own origins. No longer content to define itself negatively—I am not what the reader presumes I am—the "I" turns upon itself to demand whence and how it came to be. This shift in concern is caused, or at least is represented, by an abrupt narrowing of the distance between narrator and hero. Until Juan enters Moscow, the narrator has kept him at a comfortable, ironic remove. Juan's adventures are viewed tolerantly, but with the eye of one who has aged past the temptations of love and martial glory. If McGann is correct in suggesting that the poem operates in two times—Juan living through the age of Revolution and the narrator dwelling in the period of Reaction that followed (Inflections 268-69)—we might propose that Juan's early adventures are those of a more hopeful age. The narrator sees them as antiquarian relics to be cherished, as past-oral. The autocratic court of Catherine the Great, however, marks a transition; in the 1790s Russia maintained the despotism it took the rest of Europe twenty years to reestablish. There Juan encounters an order of society and a form of temptation that the narrator, in 1822, knows only too well. Juan's sojourn in Moscow leads his narrator toward the political present and Juan to England. It poses also the ontogenic questions that lead the narrative voice to its "crisis" in Canto 11. It is necessary, then, to commence an enquiry into this crisis by asking what happens to the hero in Russia and why this should so shake the poem's "I." Juan, as male whore in the clutches of Catherine the Great, reaches his lowest point. He has met his sexual match and his moral antipodes and is saved from sickness unto death only by leaving for England's moral clime. His physical health mends soon enough but the tainted identity that the Empress has impressed upon him is not shed so easily. Throughout his travels Juan has been made, remade and even made "maid" by the desires of women. His passivity has presented him as a screen onto which desires are projected. Even in England, he is "all things unto people of all sorts" and "likewise could be most things to all women" (14.31). It is one thing, however, to be fashioned by young women—Julia, Haidée, Dudù— whose desires are not prescriptive. It is worse to be transformed by women with determinate ideas but limited or escapable power—Inez, Gulbayez. Intolerable, though, is the determining, plenipotent Catherine who completely reauthors Juan's being. Worst of all, Juan offers no conscious resistance; he finds the role of whore flatteringly seductive. The true temptress is not, however, Catherine. It is Juan's self: He, on the other hand, if not in love, Fell into that no less imperious passion, Self-love. (9.68) As Catherine's desire transforms Juan into an image, if not of herself, at least of the lost, internalized object of desire, so Juan falls to his desires and finds in Catherine</page><page sequence="12">40 Kim Ian Michasiw (at age sixty-one or sixty-two) a serviceable metaphor for any woman: "he was of that delighted age / Which makes all female ages equal." The pair couples as if through a two-sided mirror with an opportune aperture. It is tempting to overread this episode as an allegory of Byron's relations with his public. Lang demonstrates the centrality of the Russian scene to what he terms Byron's "biographical imperative" and concludes by insisting that "Canto 9 is the very climax of the poem viewed as a whole" (166). Without agreeing whole heartedly, one may note that the entanglement with Catherine marks Juan's nadir, that point at which he ceases to love objects in themselves and loves them only as they reflect him. In the popular poet's case the object is the poetry itself, an object too easily lost. And, without acceding entirely to Martin's notion of Byron as victim of his readers, one can suggest that in Byron's heyday it was easy enough for writing poetry to become a form of prostitution and for the popular poet to be moved to write only by self-love, by the highly polished image his readers have made of him. As Juan discovers how love becomes a duty and the body a vendable commodity, the popular writer learns how poetry becomes product and the poet a monger of wares. Against this notion Byron protests, "I thought that poetry was an art, or an attribute, and not a profession" (Letters 6:47). In the flush of Childe Harold's popularity, however, Byron discovers writing for money and, like Juan, finds himself feted and paid for services rendered to the fantasy life of his public (Martin 39-44). If Juan and Byron are seduced innocents, they are self-seduced. If one sighs for beauty in vast royalty's arms and the other longs to be a gentleman and a poet while mongering his Oriental Tales, both yearn for an identity that is not formed by the desires of others. Byron's entire career questions the possibility of such an identity; is the author of Don Juan in any way separable from the "most famous writer in the Western world, [whose] works were the most saleable products on the English literary market"? (McGann, Inflections 115). The desires of the other transform the self's sense of self, and that self has within it a fifth columnist: self-love. Posited in Juan's fall to Catherine is the notion that egotism, even Berkeley's "universal egotism" with which Canto 11 opens, is only apparently an indulgence of the self. It is, in fact, a defensive reaction to the dawning recognition that the self has been colonized by the other. Juan's firmest sense of identity, his greatest access of selfishness, is the direct result of Catherine's absolute control over his being. Similarly, Byron, in the fulness of his fame and in the most programmatically self-indulgent posturings of his poetic personae, is the most in thrall to the purchasing public. The latter half of Canto 10 offers two defenses against this fall: the body and tradition. There is a certain irony in the first, in that it is Juan's body that makes him serviceable to Catherine. On the other hand, the Empress's desires and pleasures, like those of the cerebral ladies of the English Cantos, are of the mind and the will. In thrall to the mind the body eventually screams; Juan, his body intervening across both the Cartesian split and the master-slave dialectic, grows sick and in his illness is delivered from his self-imposed sexual servitude. Bodily limitation's rising to smite down the mind's delusions of omnipotence is</page><page sequence="13">Byron and Autobiography 41 an eighteenth-century satiric commonplace whether it is regarded with horror or as a salutary brake upon hubris. Don Juan, in accordance with Byron's announce ments of his ties to the Augustan satirists, has consistent recourse to the authority of the body. In few poems is the body, with its unfortunate capacity to bleed and die, and its appetites for food, water and sex, so constantly in evidence. The poem's greatest monsters are those who impose their imperial wills upon the body, and especially upon the bodies of others. It is in the bodily potential for decay and death that the narrator finds himself and finds a way to save, at least temporarily, his hero. A reprise of this saving moment forms the opening of Canto 11 when Berkeley's assertion of the mind's dominion is confuted by a disturbance in the bowels: For ever and anon comes indigestion (Not the most "dainty Ariel") and perplexes Our soarings with another sort of question. (11.3) The mutterings of the intestines serve as ancestral voices prophesying the dissolution of the imperial self, and with that prophecy comes the appearance at least of a bodily self that exists independent of social mediation. (This, as Byron recognizes, is patently a pipe-dream: peasants receive no physic, no tickets to England. They waste and die.) Human mortality is not the most secure fix for identity; it is certainly not the most reassuring. Its remembrance does, however, teach the mind humility and, however ironically the poem phrases it, a belief in something beyond self-will: I don't know what the reason is—the air Perhaps; but as I suffer from the shocks Of illness, I grow much more orthodox. (11.5) Orthodoxy leads to tradition, the second ground of fixed identity. Canto 10 presents this possibility in the figure of Leila, the Moslem girl whom Juan saves from the sack of Ismail. Leila, though exposed to scenes of horror and luxury, though nagged by Nazarenes and beset by bishops, refuses to be converted, refuses to be changed in any way except to the degree that her love for Juan as her savior and guardian inflects her being. She refuses also to be impressed: ([She]... saw all Western things with small surprise, To the surprise of people of condition, Who think that novelties are butterflies To be pursued as food for inanition) ( 12.27) Leila's identity, in contrast to Juan's, is constant. She is secured against mutability by belief in the tradition into which she was born. In this it is Leila rather than Haidée who is most recalled by the introduction of Aurora Raby who "held [her family's] old faith and old feelings fast." Aurora's fidelity has the result that She gazed upon a world she scarcely knew As seeking not to know it</page><page sequence="14">42 Kim Ian Michasiw Her spirit seem'd as seated on a throne Apart from the surrounding world, and strong In its own strength—most strange in one so young! (15.47) In simplicity of faith and absence of doubt, both Leila and Aurora find a distance from the world and in that distance are able to achieve a firm identity. In this they are utterly unlike Juan, his narrator and their author. The two young women gain identity by accepting a social script upon their being. Importantly, both women are orphans. Their relations to the symbolic and social order are not, as Juan's are, mediated by parents. That is, in Freud's or Lacan's terms, their introjection of custom is achieved free of the distortions deriving from actual parents. The social script they accept as authoring their beings is unconflicted, idealized, almost Imaginary (Freud 67; Lacan 135-37, 143-44). This script is not, then, the quotidian palimpsest of fashion and mutability but rather the graven letter of which moral cant is the hypocrite's translation. Like a Richardson heroine, these women are true to the faith that the world merely mouthes and are at once at the very center and on the furthest margins of the social world. Their traditional faith contrasts starkly with the Enlightenment (and Romantic) conviction that the individual was formed by rejections of accepted ideas and social dogma. They find themselves most truly (and others find them most strange) in a felt adherence to custom and in a refusal to accept the Enlightenment's bracketing of custom's transcendental ground. In acknowledging and accepting a self-origin outside the self, they discover an ontological stability unattainable by those who have embraced "doubt... thou sole prism / Of the truth's rays" (11.2). Yet structurally, the ontogenic process governing Leila and Aurora is identical to that creating the narrator and "Byron" and any other human subject. In a hopeful moment the narrator sketches himself: Temperate I am—yet never had a temper; Modest I am—yet with some slight assurance; Changeable too—yet somehow 'Idem semper' : So that I almost think that the same skin For one without—has two or three within. (17.11) This at the unexpected close of the poem when the narrator, like Juan, has resigned himself to a fluctuating identity. In Canto 11, however, the mood is not so hopeful and the problem of ontogeny has yet to be resolved. The ontogenic process is identical in all subjects but the results differ sadly. The social force that has identified Leila and Aurora has sadly split the narrator. One skin covers a multiple subject, a subject pressed on one side by bodily determinacy and on the other by Romantic (Shelleyan) demands that the subject should be self-created and unitary. Yet the issue in Don Juan is never mere being; it is being in the world and one is not in the world solely as a purgative trial. The impositions of sad reality upon the human are not merely skins to be cast, temporary garments to be discarded. Byron discovers in Leila a positive vision of custom's implication in</page><page sequence="15">Byron and Autobiography 43 the genesis of the subject, of the introjection of the symbolic order into the psyche. The conscious rejection of social and historical determination—the program urged by Shelley when he laments Byron's inability "to eradicate from his great mind the delusions of Christianity" (Letters 2: 699)—is doomed to failure and dooms its practitioner to bad faith. The ideal of the sovereign ego is a social construction, as the social and political privilege of Don Juan's most sublime egotists—Catherine, Gulbayez, Suvarrow—demonstrates. Kate the dairy maid has not the latitude of Catherine the Great but neither is free from the toils of custom and privilege. The question, then, is what has composed the narrator. More than the bodily clay and genial fire that Manfred asserts, but what more? This is the crisis addressed by the narrator in the latter half of Canto 11 when his hero and he arrive in London. They arrive "out of synch." Juan lands in 1791, while the narrator, who writes in 1822, finds himself in an England eight years out of date, frozen some time around 1814, at the mid-point between Byron's accession to fame and his exile. Here (in space and time) the narrator confronts the thing within the self, his structural equivalent of Leila's Islam and Aurora's "old faith and old feelings." The moment of confrontation fairly bursts upon him: "Where is the world," cries Young "at eighty? Where The world in which a man was born? Alas! Where is the world of eight years past? 'Twas there— I look for it—'tis gone, a Globe of Glass! Cracked, shivered, vanished, scarcely gazed on, ere A silent change dissolves the glittering mass." (11.76) The passage, with its (apparently forged4) quotation from Edward Young, its allusion to The Tempest's Prospero, its revision of Wordsworth's five years and its foretaste of Proustian nostalgia, acquires its poignancy from the narrator's failure to find his reflection in the shattered glass. He finds himself "the ghost of vanished pleasures once in vogue," the creation of an age that is now extinct. The clue is that in the gallery of vanished and transient figures, of "statesmen, chiefs, orators, queens, patriot kings, / And dandies" one portrait is signally missing, that of the age's greatest living poet. Byron has dealt with his poetic career before the catalog of the vanished commences, but the reader still feels the absence of "the grand Napoleon in the realms of rhyme," a metaphor that indicates among which company the now-spectral Byron should appear. Like the Emperor, the poetic hero has fallen into decay, exile, oblivion. In this he meets the same fate as all the Regency's stars; poets, politicians, social lions have all burnt out in the firmament. All sought immortality and none has found it and none will know to whom posterity shall award her finally valueless laurels: Since odds are that Posterity will know No more of them, than they of her, I trow. Why, I'm Posterity—and so are you; And whom do we remember? Not a hundred. Were every memory written down all true, The tenth or twentieth name would be but blundered. (12.18-19)</page><page sequence="16">44 Kim Ian Micliasiw The question of immortality is important, yet it is crucially separated from this parade of ephemera because immortality, poetic or otherwise, has no meaning in the present. It is only the future perfect of fame and, in the present tense, the day's notoriety is all one can know, or should crave. The fleetingness of the moment when the sun falls upon the day's bubbles is not Byron's central point. That center is the essentially formative role—one that parallels that of Nature in Wordsworth— of the social moment. The self is located in time and that time is in constant flux leaving the self two options: to fluctuate with it or to be fixed and thus accept anachrony. The times move and with them move all who do not wish to be passed by: in seven [years] I have seen more changes, down from monarchs to The humblest individual under heaven. Than might suffice a moderate century through. I knew that nought was lasting, but now even Change grows too changeable without being new. (11.82) The constant, drumming repetition of "I have seen" is less the affirmation of poetic identity that Mark Storey considers it (35-36) than an admission of the poet's acceptance of voyeurism. He has found himself to be no more, and no less, than a camera. Thus, his recommending the pleasures of the ogle, of what Freud would have called scopophilia, is no surprise (11.72). Yet there is more here: the narrator's expansive ogle and the specularity of England's social world are the creations of exile. Byron's retreat has fixed his England in time and granted him a prospect from which to review the spectacle as it passes on its way to oblivion. The emphasis on seeing, however, has other echoes, for what are these flashes of memory but Byron's version of the visionary gleam, sparkling from the shattered glass of 1814, a glass that once contained the image of Byron but can no longer. Society was the mirror in which the poet saw and knew himself for what he was, the reflection of a popular desire, but that society and that desire are no longer in view. They have been replaced by another, and so shall it be: "Tomorrow sees another race as gay / And transient" (11.86). Time itself has become a voyeur; all has been reduced to image. The heavy emphasis upon verbs of seeing in Canto 11 congeals into the narrator's final injunction to Juan and to other citizens of the world: "be / Not what you seem, but always what you see" (11.86). I hope that I am not alone in finding this command gnomic. The canceled manuscript version is far more clear, counseling that Juan "be / A Scoundrel" (491). The final version, however, insists on its importance by picking up the verb "to see" that has governed the six preceding stanzas. Yet what precisely are we to make of the command? The negated option—being what you seem—appears to be a conventional injunction to align reality with appearance except that the phrasing grants priority to seeming. Moreover, the injunction ignores Juan's multiple problems with his seemings to others; he has tried to live up (or down) to those seemings and the project has culminated in his slavery to Catherine and self-love. Being what you see is more</page><page sequence="17">Byron and Autobiography 45 curious still. How is one to go about this? Have we any models? An ambulant, anthropomorphic mirror perhaps —save that this ideal is more than a mere reflector; its being is more than a chameleon's protective coloration. Rather, it is a revisionist return to Berkeley, a philosophically ambitious, though peculiarly skewed, translation of the Bishop's esse est percipi, with Byron reversing the active and passive verbs, making "being" subject to the object of perception. This advice, despite the irony of its being counsel about survival in a fallen world, appears to be Don Juan's, attempt to fuse the subject/object dualism that bedevils the romantic project. The subject becomes the object, or at least the sum of the objects open to sight. The negative and conventionally moral cast of the previous line, "Be hypocritical, be cautious," is transformed utterly. The viewer and the scene become mutually reflecting mirrors; both "play out the play" their interimplication writes upon them. The dancer and the dance are one, but only for today; tomorrow they are another. A stable identity is impossible without leaving the dance, without being exiled—by age, death, traditional morality, factitious will, or some other accident—from the scene of being. Yet fictions of identity remain. Both the identity protected by the narrator's protest, "that I sing of neither mine nor me" (11.88) and that projected upon him by the world, survive. The momentary fusion of self and world cannot be maintained and Byron's narrator is soon separate in his "free thoughts" and is again "the subject of attack By those who love to say that white is black" (11.90). The adversarial relation between the narrator and what he sees and the audience's vision of him is reasserted. There has, however, been a change, and a change that might help to explain the poem's narrative transition from picaresque episodes to chapters in a novel of manners (McGann, Context 129). The parade of the transient marks an acceptance, though a limited and grudging one as the beatific aura surrounding the stable Aurora indicates, of an alien and shifting presence within the self. Byron grants here the social construction of at least a significant portion of the individual self. This acceptance is a crucial moment because it is one poet's response to the nightmare side of the romantic dream of ontological autonomy. Each of the major English Romantic poets is haunted by the possibility that something that is not one's self persists at the base of consciousness. This putative presence goes by a number of aliases. When viewed daemonically, it is Imagina tion (which may be considered the name for a defensive trope guarding against the mind's recognition that it is not self-identical, self-creating). Viewed demonically, this alien is custom, habit, the specter of rational thought and doubt, the weight of daily life, the reality principle, the fading of being, the body, the unpurged animal part.... This "alien" presence operates under the sign of inspiration and of the sublime but also of acidie, despair, apostasy. And always, except in Don Juan and perhaps in the later Keats, the negative phase or face of this alien is treated as what Julia Kristeva has called "the abject." The abject rises from within the self, "a massive and sudden emergence of uncanniness, which, familiar as it might have been in an opaque and forgotten life, now harries me as radically separate, loathsome" (2). Like Wordsworth descending into psychic chaos in the Gondo Gorge, or Shelley's</page><page sequence="18">46 Kim Ian Michasiw Beatrice Cenci finding the spoor of her monstrous father at the root of her conscious being, or like Blake's Zoas beset by specters that are their own, the romantic dream of autonomous selfhood confronts with loathing the alien portion of being and abjects it, spits it out, cleaves it off, repudiates. This should be the result of Don Juan's hailing of the socially created self—as all of Byron's earlier heroes are scapegoated to the degree that they unveil within Byron a replica of the audience's image of him. The expected repudiation does not, however, occur. Don Juan's narrator is not only what he has been made, not only what he sees, but these are portions of his being that can not be cast out as loathsome parasites. They are intermixed inseparably with what Byron in his moments of romantic self-assertion would claim as his best, true self, his "free thoughts." The project of Don Juan after Canto 11 is no longer what it might have been at first. Byron no longer writes so as to "remain in the world and yet keep free of the world" (McGann, Fiery Dust 85). Self and world cannot be so distanced except by artificial means. The self is a social product even when that self is not involved directly with the world. The model is not of an entirely constructed self, but autonomous ontogeny has suffered a demotion. There is something of Byron that is not the world's making but it is only a something and it is not the essential something. The project then is to write the life of Juan, of the narrator, of Byron, in light of this recognition. The individual's history becomes the history of the times. No longer can there be a separation between the hero and the world, between the poet and the specular image projected upon him by the desires of the audience. The fiction of the Byronic hero hopelessly out of time cannot be maintained, nor can that of the true but masked poet deluding his reader with personae and phantoms and pandering stand-ins. The masks have always adhered to, or have been aspects of, the face behind. If Byron or his narrator is born for opposition, as he claims in Canto 14, it is opposition to a world in the context and terms of a world that is not without the self. In Canto 11 of Don Juan the romantic aspiration to autonomy and auto-ontogeny implodes on itself. The narrator joins his hero as a cultural artifact and pulls the author with him. Which is not to say that the remainder of the poem is a cultural materialist autobiography, simply that this is now an option, a potential effect of our reading.
