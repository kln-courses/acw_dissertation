<plain_text><page sequence="1">Historical Notes The Great Chernichewski by ULF HANNERZ Stockholm, Sweden. 24 v 71 While browsing among the shelves of an antiquarian bookseller in London recently I came across a slim volume entitled Anthropological Report on a London Suburb which may interest an- thropologists with a taste for the curi- osities of their discipline. Published by Grayson and Grayson of London in 1935, it is supposedly edited by Charles Duff from the notes of "Pro- fessor Vladimir Chernichewski, The Eminent Scientist." According to Duff's preface (p. 9), the notes were handed to him "by Professor Cher- nichewski immediately before his de- parture for Cambridge to make final preparations for his famous forthcom- ing expedition to the Island of Capri." Duff goes on (p. 10): Chernichewski used to say to me: "Men of science are often less honest and less ac- curate than writers of unabashed fiction. I believe nothing until I have investigated for myself!" The result of this fine freedom of mind and healthy distrust of his fellow scientists is that, in matters anthropological, to quote the authority of Chernichewski is the same as it would be in matters theologi- cal to quote the authority of His Holiness the Pope. Given the name of this renowned anthropologist and the year of publi- cation, the volume is obviously par- tially intended as a parody of Mali- nowski. Charles Duff, then, is apparently himself the author-there is a list of his other works, including A Handbook on Hanging and The Truth About Columbus, at the back of the book, and excerpts from reviews of these works indicate that he special- ized in satire. Those who are knowl- edgeable about the circle around Malinowski in the middle '30s could perhaps tell us whether there was any personal contact between him and Duff or any reaction to the book on the part of Malinowski or anybody else. Anthropological Report on a London Suburb may also be seen, not too seriously, as one of the earliest con- tributions to urban anthropology. Chernichewski's introduction (p. 12) provides an excellent statement of the rationale for anthropological studies in modern communities: I would emphasize that the science of an- thropology is not only concerned with the naked savage, but with the man or woman in plus fours or evening dress. To the true man of science it matters little whether he is dealing with suburb or jungle, modern jazz dancing or savage sex orgy, forest magic or the anthropomorphic deism of a suburban greengrocer, the cures and charms of the Bantu medicine-man or the work of a Fel- low of the Royal College of Physicians. The difference between ourselves and savages is often more apparent than real; plus fours may conceal a brute, and a coat of paint may cover a tender heart. As for the general description of life in the suburb of Hamperleywood, it might not appeal very strongly to the sense of irony of today's reader-par- tially because he is distant from the object, but perhaps also because the idiom of social satire has changed since 1935. Yet it strikes me as curious never to have come across any reference to Anthropological Report on a London Sub- urb in the anthropological literature. 172 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page></plain_text>
