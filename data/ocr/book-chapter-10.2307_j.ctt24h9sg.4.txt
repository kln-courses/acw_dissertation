Although 50 years of  archaeological research in the southwest Pacific have yielded more than 200 sites distributed from the  Bismarck Archipelago to western Polynesia where Lapita pottery has been found (see Bedford and Sand  this volume), and archaeologists have gained a detailed understanding of regional and temporal variations  in decorative styles and vessel forms, sampling problems have prevented them from recovering anything  like the full range of material culture associated with Lapita communities. One kind of sampling problem has to do with the scale of excavations. Few Lapita habitation sites  have been excavated on the large scale needed to recover a fully representative range of materials - artefacts,  settlement patterns, faunal remains, etc. This sort of sampling deficiency is likely to be ameliorated by  further research. But there is a second kind of shortfall that cannot be remedied because it is in the nature of  archaeological assemblages. In Neolithic societies a very high proportion of artefacts are made of perishable  materials. This means that even the most artefact-rich assemblages will contain only a small fraction of the  total range of artefact types. Kirch and Green (2001:164ff) examined ethnographic records of artefacts for a  sample of five traditional Polynesian material cultures and found that, on average, only around 18 percent  of artefact types were durable (the range was 14-23 %). And when it comes to drawing inferences from non- material culture, archaeologists generally have even less material to work with. These sampling problems, of  terra australis 26    </page> <page sequence="2"> Oceanic Explorations: Lapita and Western Pacific Settlement course, apply not only to Lapita sites but to the cultural traditions that preceded Lapita in the archaeological  record for the Bismarck Archipelago and Island Southeast Asia. This paper will focus on two questions: 2 1.  What can lexical evidence from historical linguistics add to the accounts of Early Lapita culture  provided by archaeology? 2.  What can lexical evidence tell us about the antecedents of Early Lapita culture in the Neolithic  cultures of Island South Asia?  A third question will also be briefly addressed: 3.  Can comparative linguistics tell us anything about the interaction between speakers of Austronesian  and non-Austronesian languages in the Lapita period? Historical linguistics can, under certain circumstances, provide evidence that supplements the  archaeological record. The lexicon of a language (its store of words and fixed multiword expressions) is a body  of intangible artefacts that tells much about the way of life of the speech community. By tracing the histories of  words, but more especially tight-knit terminologies, sets of words representing particular semantic fields, we  can learn a great deal about continuities and changes in the way of life of the people who used these words. However, anyone seeking to marry a (reconstructed) linguistic prehistory with a (reconstructed)  archaeological prehistory faces a number of methodological challenges. The most fundamental one is to match  particular archaeological assemblages with particular languages. In many regions of the world, this sort of  matching has proved impossible to achieve with any degree of confidence. It happens that in Pacific prehistory  we have a rare piece of good fortune: there is a well-attested archaeological horizon, namely Lapita, that can  be securely correlated with a well-established linguistic dispersal, namely, that of the Oceanic languages. In  particular, the bearers of the Early Lapita culture who occupied parts of the Bismarck Archipelago around  3300 BP can be equated with the speech community that spoke Proto Oceanic, the Austronesian interstage  that was the immediate ancestor of all the Oceanic languages. The argument will be that if it can be shown that Proto Oceanic speakers retained a named concept  from an earlier stage, Proto Malayo-Polynesian, generally regarded as having been spoken in the Philippines  (see below), then (by definition) that concept was part of the cultural apparatus they brought with them into  the Bismarcks. I will present evidence from terminologies belonging to 11 cultural domains, most of which  concern material culture. The domains are 1. canoes and sailing, 2. houses and settlement patterns, 3. fishing  methods and technology, 4. agriculture and arboriculture, 5. domestic animals, 6. pottery, 7. cooking, 8. cutting  implements, 9. clothing, weaving, ornaments and decoration, 10. kinship, and 11. leadership and other social  categories. How Southeast Asian is Lapita? The debate about Lapita origins In the 1970s a case was built up that Lapita pottery forms were simply the most visible part of a culture  complex whose distinctive elements were fairly homogeneous throughout the geographic range of Lapita  habitation sites (Bellwood 1978; Golson 1971; Green 1979). A number of scholars argued that the spread of the  Oceanic branch of Austronesian languages across the southwest Pacific was associated with Lapita and with  other Neolithic cultures of Island Melanesia which were roughly contemporaneous with, or in some cases,  possibly even earlier than Lapita, and that all were ultimately derived from Island Southeast Asia (Bellwood  1978; Pawley and Green 1973; Shutler and Marck 1975). Lapita was seen as being a culture quite different from any which preceded it in the record for  Melanesia. Its most prominent markers are earthenware vessels with red-slipped surfaces, made in a characteristic  terra australis 26    </page> <page sequence="3"> The origins of Early Lapita culture: the testimony of historical linguistics variety of shapes, including large carinated jars and bowls, globular and spherical pots, flat-bottomed dishes  and pedestal stands. A minority of vessels were decorated with precise and elaborate geometric motifs, done  by dentate stamping, i.e. with repeated applications of a set of toothed implements.  In Lapita sites representing permanent settlements the pottery is part of a cluster of elements -  artefact types, architecture, settlement patterns and items representing long distance trade. Settlements are  in the hamlet to village range and are nearly always situated on small islands or on the coast of large islands  and close to beaches that would provide good launching sites and reef passage for canoes. Lapita assemblages  contain ground and polished stone and shell adzes; obsidian and chert flake tools, often imported from  remote sources; one-piece shell fishhooks; pearlshell knives and scrapers; various kinds of conus shell disks  and pendants. Houses were typically rectangular. In some settlements houses were built on stilts over the  reef flat. Middens are typically full of lagoon fish and turtle bones, attesting to the importance of fishing and  to a variety of fishing techniques. The bones of chicken and pig are sometimes present, indicating that these  animals (neither of which was native to Near Oceania) were kept as domesticates. By 3300-3200 BP Early Lapita communities were established over a wide area of the Bismarcks,  including north New Britain, south New Britain, Mussau in the St Matthias group, the Anir group off the  southeast coast of New Ireland and (though less well attested in the archaeological record) almost certainly also  in the Admiralty Islands. There are several signs that the dispersed communities formed a network of societies,  probably related by kinship and marriage, that kept in regular contact at least for two or three centuries. The  clearest indicator is the long distance movement between these communities of obsidian from one or both of  the only two sources in the region (the Talasea region, on New Britain’s Willaumez Peninsula and the Manus  group), and also the movement of chert, oven stones and adzes. Another indicator is the parallel changes in  pottery styles over the New Britain-Mussau-Anir region over the period 3300-3000 BP (Summerhayes 2000a,b,  2001). By around 3000 BP the intensity of contacts had diminished markedly. In the meantime, by 3200-3100 BP,  people carrying Early Lapita had moved beyond the Bismarcks and settled parts of Remote Oceania. During the 1980s and 1990s, as the archaeological record improved and the history of regional  archaeological sequences was clarified, it became evident that the carriers of Lapita were, in fact, the foundation  settlers of all those parts of Melanesia that lie in Remote Oceania, as well as of western Polynesia, and that  the Lapita dispersal took no more than three or four centuries to reach the Tonga-Samoa area (Burley and  Connaughton 2007; Burley et al. 2001; Irwin 1981, 1992; Green 1991a, 1999, 2003; Kirch 1997; Spriggs 1997). A contrary case for Lapita origins was developed in the latter half of the 1980s and 1990s by a number  of scholars associated with the Lapita Homeland Project (Allen and Gosden 1991). This project, beginning in  1985, added greatly to knowledge of the Upper Pleistocene and Early and Mid Holocene archaeological record  for the Bismarck Archipelago. Having demonstrated that the Bismarck archipelago has a continuous history  of human occupation going back some 30-40,000 years these scholars proposed a predominantly local origin  of the Lapita cultures of the Bismarck archipelago (Allen and Gosden 1996; Allen and White 1989; White et  al. 1988). They pointed out that the pre-Lapita materials contain precedents for up to 10 elements of Lapita  technology and trade patterns, including lagoon fishing, trochus shell armrings, one piece shell fishhooks,  earth ovens, and trade in obsidian. Green (1991a, 1997, 2003) argued against a single source for Lapita. He proposed a “Triple I model”,  in which some elements of Early Lapita were intrusive, i.e. brought from South East Asia into northwest  Melanesia, some were local innovations, developed by Lapita people in Melanesia, and some were of local  (Melanesian, presumably non-AN speaking peoples of Melanesia) origin that were integrated into (adopted  by) Early Lapita communities.  In broad terms, the Triple I model seems now to be accepted by most specialists. However, “broad” is  the operative term. The debate continues over which Early Lapita cultural elements are intrusions, innovations,  or borrowings, in the above senses. Kirch (1995, 1997, 2000) emphasises continuity, observing that “the early  terra australis 26    </page> <page sequence="4"> Oceanic Explorations: Lapita and Western Pacific Settlement Lapita assemblages ... fit comfortably within the range of varieties ... for cultural complexes dating to the  second and third millennia B.C. in island southeast Asia (1995:2832). Having asked ‘How South-East Asian  is Lapita?’, Spriggs concludes (with Green) that it “is basically of South-East Asian Austronesian origin, with  added elements innovated in the Bismarcks, and some integration of pre-Lapita Melanesian elements” (Spriggs  1997:102). As to the balance between these three components, he comments as follows: Lapita elements of South-East Asian origin would appear to be pottery (or at least particular kinds  of pottery), domestic animals, quadrangular adzes, polished stone chisels, various shell ornament types,  rectangular houses (some on stilts), large villages, language, and probably aspects of boat technology, tattoo  chisels, pearlshell knives, trolling hooks and various stone-artefact classes (Spriggs 1997:101-102). Unique to  Melanesia on current evidence were very few elements: some crops, obsidian-stemmed tools and possibly,  dorsal-region Tridacna adzes (Spriggs 1997:102).  Spriggs points to a third class of artefacts that are indeterminate between intrusion and integration:  items that were present in Melanesia in pre-Lapita times but were also present in early Neolithic assemblages  in Island South East Asia. These include “grindstones, hinge-region Tridacna adzes, pierced shell pendants,  shell beads, Trochus armbands, one-piece fishhooks, bone points or awls, vegetation clearance by fire, most of  the Oceanic domesticated crop complex, shellfishing and reef fishing, earth ovens (at least in Maluku), and  some level of long-distance exchange” (Spriggs 1997:102). (He also includes oval/lenticular polished adzes,  but there are no pre-Lapita polished stone adzes in Island Melanesia and oval as well as quadrangular adzes  are known from Island Southeast Asia (R. Green pers.comm.)).  I turn now to the linguistic evidence bearing on these issues.  The subgrouping and dispersal of Austronesian languages Although the outlines of the Austronesian family were discovered in the eighteenth century, it was only in  the 1930s that Otto Dempwolff established conclusively that most of the Austronesian languages of the Pacific  Islands belong to a single branch of the family. Building on a series of papers he wrote in the 1920s, and on the  work of earlier scholars, Dempwolff published a three volume work which provided by far the most systematic  reconstruction of the Proto-Austronesian (PAn) sound system (phonology) to date along with more than 2000  reconstructed roots (Dempwolff 1934-38). (Because his sample, crucially, did not include the then little-known  Formosan languages Dempwolff’s “Proto Austronesian” reconstructions are nowadays equated with “Proto  Malayo-Polynesian” (PMP), the largest first-order branch of Austronesian, to be discussed below.) Dempwolff’s sample of some 30 languages from Melanesia showed largely regular correspondences  with PMP consonants and vowels. They also showed something even more striking. In vocabulary inherited  from PMP, the Austronesian languages of Melanesia shared a sizeable set of common changes to the PMP sound  system, changes not present in Austronesian languages west of New Guinea. Furthermore, he observed that  the Polynesian languages have undergone the same innovations. This body of shared innovations thus defines  a subgroup, nowadays called “Oceanic”. Subsequent work has confirmed and extended Dempwolff’s main  findings in this respect. The innovations of the Oceanic group are shared by all the Austronesian languages  of Melanesia east of 138 degrees (from the Sarmi coast of Irian Jaya) but excluding those of Cenderawasih  Bay and the Bird’s Head of New Guinea, and they are also shared by all the languages of Micronesian except  Chamorro and Palauan.  The main phonological innovations attributable to Proto Oceanic (POc) are as follows. (For convenience  I refer here to contemporary reconstructions, which make various modifications to Dempwolff’s reconstructed  sound system and orthography.) In the consonants, there were several mergers (where contrasts between certain  pairs of PMP consonants were lost) in POc. PMP *p and *b merged, as did *k and *g, *d and *r, and *s and *Z.  terra australis 26 20 </page> <page sequence="5"> The origins of Early Lapita culture: the testimony of historical linguistics PMP *h was lost. Several new consonants were added: the labiovelars *bw, *pw, and *mw. In the vowels, PMP  *e and *aw merged as *o and *i and *uy merged as *i. The sequence *-ay, which occurred only word-finally,  simplified to *-e. There were some other rather complicated developments in the sound system that need not  detain us here (for a fuller account see Lynch et al. 2002:63-67). There are also a number of morphological and  lexical innovations defining Oceanic.  The proofs of an Oceanic group, now known to contain some 450-500 of the 1000-1200 languages in  the Austronesian family, was the first important breakthrough in the high-order subgrouping of Austronesian  languages. Subsequent work has shown that Oceanic is no higher than a fourth-order division of Austronesian.  The sequence of branchings in the topmost parts of the Austronesian family tree have only become reasonably  clear over the past 30 years, mainly due to the work of Robert Blust. Blust has pointed to evidence that supports  an initial division of Austronesian into a number of branches represented only in Taiwan and a branch that  contains all members of the family spoken outside of Taiwan. This large branch, labelled Malayo-Polynesian  (MP), is defined by a number of phonological and morphological innovations (Blust 1977, 1982, 1995b, 1999;  Ross 1992, 2005). Blust (1999) now thinks that the Taiwan languages fall into as many as nine different primary  subgroups, reinforcing an already strong argument that Taiwan was the Austronesian homeland.  Malayo-Polynesian is in turn classified into (a) a Greater Philippines group (Blust 1991) and an  indeterminate number of groups represented in Sulawesi and the Austronesian-speaking areas west of Sulawesi,  including Madagascar (Blust and others tend to refer to these groups plus Greater Philippines, collectively, as  “Western Malayo-Polynesian”), and (b) a Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian (CEMP) branch that contains  some 650 languages (Blust 1983-84a, 1993). The dispersal centre of Proto MP was almost certainly the northern  Philippines - the Batanes Islands and Luzon - an area settled at around 4000 BP by bearers of a Neolithic culture  with close affinities to cultures of south and eastern Taiwan (Bellwood and Dizon 2005). Proto CEMP was evidently a dialect complex, centred in the Moluccas, that soon broke up into a  Central Malayo-Polynesian (CMP) dialect complex and an Eastern Malayo-Polynesian (EMP) branch. CMP  comprises chiefly the languages of the Moluccas, the Lesser Sundas east of Sumbawa, and the Austronesian  languages of the south side of the Birds Head of New Guinea. EMP divides into the large Oceanic group and a  smaller South Halmahera-West New Guinea (SHWNG) group (Blust 1978a). Proto EMP was probably spoken  around Cenderawasih Bay, at the neck of the Bird’s Head, where the greatest diversity of daughter languages  is found. Figure 1. Austronesian family tree: higher order branches. terra australis 26 2  </page> <page sequence="6"> Oceanic Explorations: Lapita and Western Pacific Settlement Figure 2. Distribution of the major subgroups of Austronesian. The Oceanic branch stems from a movement of EMP speakers from the Cenderawasih Bay area  of western New Guinea east to the Bismarck Archipelago. The considerable number of innovations defining  Oceanic suggests that a significant period of time, probably a few centuries, elapsed between (a) the separation  of this branch from the SHWNG subgroup and (b) the breakup of Proto Oceanic (POc). Given that the closest relatives of Oceanic lie around the neck of the Birds’ Head, one might  reasonably expect that speakers of pre Oceanic (the phase between Proto SHWNG and Proto Oceanic) at one  time lived along the coast of north New Guinea or its offshore islands west of the Bismarcks. But there are no  linguistic survivors of such settlements, only tantalising traces in the form of loanwords to Papuan languages  of Madang Province (Ross 1988:21). All the Oceanic languages of the north coast of New Guinea are relatively  recent “backwash” from the Bismarcks. The centre of genetic diversity within Oceanic, and the most likely primary dispersal centre for the  surviving Oceanic languages, is in the Bismarck Archipelago, where three groups are found that have claims  to be first-order subgroups: Admiralties (Blust 1978b, 1996; Ross 1988), Western Oceanic (Ross 1988) and St  Matthias (Mussau) (Blust 1984; Ross 1988).  Proto Western Oceanic appears to have been a network of dialects spoken over parts of New  Britain, the French Island (Bali-Vitu) and New Ireland (or its offshore eastern islands). It broke up into (a) a  Meso-Melanesian dialect complex, initially occupying much the same area as Proto Western Oceanic but later  spreading into the northwest Solomons, (b) a North New Guinea dialect complex, extending from the Huon  Gulf to Jayapura, and including parts of New Britain, and (c) a Papuan Tip branch, consisting of the Oceanic  languages of the Northern Milne Bay and Central Provinces of Papua (Ross 1988). There is less agreement about the high-order relationships of the Oceanic languages spoken in the  eastern half of the main Solomons group and in Remote Oceania. A conservative view is that the following  groups may be first-order branches: Southeast Solomonic (Guadalcanal, Gela, Malaita and Makira) (Pawley  1972), Te Motu (the non-Polynesian languages of Te Motu Province, in the eastern Solomons) (Ross and Naess  2007), Yapese (Ross 1996a), Micronesian (Bender 1971; Bender and Wang 1985; Jackson 1983, 1986), North- Central Vanuatu, Southern Vanuatu (Lynch 2001), New Caledonia-Loyalties (Haurdricourt 1971), and Central  terra australis 26 22 </page> <page sequence="7"> The origins of Early Lapita culture: the testimony of historical linguistics Pacific (Fijian, Rotuman and Polynesian) (Geraghty 1983, 1996; Grace 1959; Pawley 1972). However, there is  some evidence for linking certain of these groups (reflected in the groupings outlined in Lynch et al. 2002).  Figure 3 gives a conservative view of the more important high-order subgroups of Oceanic.  Figure 3. Internal classification of the Oceanic languages. Equating particular Austronesian stages with archaeological entities It seems reasonable to make the following equations between particular Austronesian stages and particular  archaeological traditions (Bellwood 1997; Green 2003; Kirch and Green 2001).  Proto Austronesian  Neolithic cultures of Taiwan 5000-4,000 BP Proto Malayo-Polynesian Neolithic of the Batanes Is. and N. Luzon c. 4000-3600 BP  Proto Oceanic Early Lapita of the Bismarcks 3400-3100 BP Proto Central Pacific Lapita of Fiji-Tonga 3000-2900 BP Proto Polynesian Post-Lapita cultures of the Tonga-Samoa region c. 2000-1500 BP terra australis 26 2  </page> <page sequence="8"> Oceanic Explorations: Lapita and Western Pacific Settlement As a consensus about the subgrouping of Austronesian has emerged, it has become ever more  apparent that the initial spread of the Lapita culture and the initial dispersal of the Oceanic languages were part  of one and the same event. The spread of Early Lapita across the Bismarck Archipelago around 3400-3300 BP  can be equated with the first stage in the diversification of Oceanic into its surviving branches. When Lapita  was carried into Remote Oceania, reaching Reefs/Santa Cruz, Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Fiji and Tonga, in the  period 3200-2900 BP, all the indications are that the carriers spoke still mutually intelligible dialects of early  Oceanic. There is no linguistic evidence for a lengthy pause at any point along the way, between the Bismarcks  and West Polynesia, in the first few centuries after the breakup of POc. Such evidence would take the form of  a sizeable body of innovations linking some languages located say, in the main Solomons group, to languages  spoken further east, or linking languages of Vanuatu to the Fijian and Polynesian languages, or linking the  Fijian languages to Polynesian. Insofar as any subgroups have been proposed along these lines, they rest on  very few innovations - nothing that would require a pause of more than a century or two.  By contrast, there is ample evidence for some significant pauses in the expansion of Oceanic languages  over Polynesia and Micronesia. The Polynesian subgroup is defined by a massive set of shared innovations,  consistent with a period of common development of 1000 years or more in the West Polynesia area (Clark  1979; Pawley 1996a). The innovations defining Micronesian are not nearly so extensive but nonetheless point  to a significant period of unity.  By contrast, evidence for a unified Proto Central Pacific (PCP) stage (ancestral to the Fijian and  Polynesian languages and Rotuman) is slender. There is one phonological innovation, loss of *R (e.g. POc  *baRa ‘fence &gt; Standard Fijian baa, PPn *paa, POc *tiRo ‘oyster’ &gt; S. Fijian tio, PPn *tio, POC *paqoRu ‘new’  &gt; S. Fijian vou, PPn *foʔou. There are a few lexical innovations, e.g. POC *matuluR ‘sleep’ is replaced in PCP  by a non-cognate word, *moðe, giving S. Fijian moðe, Rotuman mose, Tongan mohe, Maori moe, and a very few  grammatical innovations, e.g. Fijian and PPn developed a preposition *ki ‘to towards’ and came to use the  locative preposition *i to mark cause as well as location. The distribution of innovations indicates that PCP  took the form of a chain of dialects centred in Fiji, possibly extending to Tonga, that the Polynesian branch  diverged from the eastern part of this chain (Geraghty 1983) and that Rotuman diverged from the western  part of this chain (Pawley 1996b).  Reconstructing the lexicons of different stages of Austronesian The recoverable part of the lexicon of a prehistoric proto-language is that which has left residues, in the form  of cognate vocabulary, detectable in daughter languages. How large that detectable residue will be depends  on a number of different factors: (1)  The number of languages in the group. The more languages, the more witnesses there are to  attest features of the proto-language. (2)  The quality of the descriptive data available for contemporary languages. (3)  The subgrouping or family tree structure. Agreement between a pair of closely related witnesses  has a different value from agreement between a pair of distantly related languages.  (4)  The time depth of the language group. The greater the time depth the more languages change  and the smaller the residue of elements retained from the proto-language. (5)  How conservative the languages have been. The nature and rate of linguistic change will be  shaped by the demographic and geographic history of speech communities, e.g. whether they  were isolated or in close contact with other communities, how large the communities were, and  whether they moved from one kind of environment to another, and so on. terra australis 26 2  </page> <page sequence="9"> The origins of Early Lapita culture: the testimony of historical linguistics The Austronesian family has proved to be something of a historical lexicographer’s paradise. Several  factors have combined to make it easy to reconstruct a relatively high proportion of the lexicon of various stages.  Austronesian is a very large family, with more than 1,000 member languages, and it has a highly structured  family tree. Many of the subgroups are widely separated geographically, thereby reducing the problem of  sorting out borrowings from shared inheritances. Some of the interstages (intermediate proto-languages)  have many daughter languages, providing many independent witnesses when it comes to making decisions  about reconstructions. The time depth of the family (the interval since the breakup of PAn) is not very great,  probably on the order of 4000-5000 years. The following is a brief account of works which give reconstructions with supporting cognate sets  for particular stages of Austronesian that are relevant to the present discussion. Proto Austronesian, Proto Malayo-Polynesian, Proto Central-Eastern Malayo- Polynesian, Proto Eastern Malayo-Polynesian For lexical items attributed to these early stages by far the largest database is Blust’s (1995a) Austronesian Comparative  Dictionary (ACD), a computer file equivalent to several thousand pages of printout, based in the Department  of Linguistics at the University of Hawaii. Blust’s cognate sets in many cases also include Oceanic material and  reconstructions attributed to POc. Other important sources for early Austronesian reconstructions with cognate  sets are various articles by Blust (esp. 1970, 1972a, 1980a,b, 1982, 1983–84b, 1986, 1989, 1991, 1993, 1994). Proto Oceanic3 An important source is the Lexicon of Proto Oceanic project based in the Department of Linguistics, Research  School of Pacific and Asian Studies, The Australian National University. This aims to produce a six volume  series that examines various semantic domains and critically evaluates cognate sets and reconstructions in  each domain. Although the main body of reconstructions is at the level of POc, particular cognate sets allow  reconstructions to be attributed to particular lower-order proto-languages, as well, as is the case with Blust’s  ACD. The first two volumes, dealing with material culture and with the physical environment, respectively,  have been published (Ross et al. 1998, 2003). The third and fourth volumes, on plants and animals, respectively,  are almost complete (most chapters have either been published separately or are available in electronic form).  The fifth, dealing with people and society, is partly drafted, and the sixth is still in the planning stage. Other  sources for POc cognate sets include Chowning (1991), Osmond (1998b, 2000), Ross (1988, 1996b), Pawley  (1982, 1985, 2005), and a number of papers in Pawley and Ross (1994). Proto Central Pacific There is no general compilation other than a problematic early attempt by Hockett (1976). But see Biggs (1965),  Geraghty (1983, 1986, 1990, 1996), Ross et al.

A very rough indication of the number of lexical reconstructions made to date for certain stages of  Austronesian is given below. The variations in the totals for different stages have to do both with the factors  listed above and with the amount of work that has been done.4  Proto Austronesian  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,000 Proto Malayo-Polynesian. . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,000  Proto Oceanic  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1500-2,000 Proto Central Pacific . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1000-1500 Proto Polynesian . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3000 The total lexicon of an average Austronesian language spoken by a Neolithic community was  probably in excess of 30,000 lexical units, counting each distinct sense of a word and each derived word and  compound as a distinct lexical unit. By this measure 4,000 lexical units is just a small part of the total lexicon  (though 4,000 roots would be a high proportion of the total number of roots). Even a set of 1000 reconstructions  will typically include extensive terminologies for many fundamental domains of material and non-material  culture and gives us a large body of material to work with. Lexical evidence for selected cultural domains This section gives reconstructed terminologies for 11 semantic fields in five Austronesian interstages: Proto  Austronesian (PAn), Malayo-Polynesian (PMP), Proto Oceanic (POc), Proto Central Pacific (PCP) and Proto  Polynesian (PPn). We are chiefly interested in the comparison between PMP and POc. PCP and PPn reflexes  of POc reconstructions are included as well, to exemplify patterns of lexical retention and loss in languages  associated with Lapita and post-Lapita archaeological traditions in the Fiji-West Polynesia area. Because of  the large number of reconstructions treated the supporting cognate sets cannot be included and the discussion  will necessarily be very sketchy. The reader is referred to the primary sources for supporting cognate sets and  more detailed commentary.  Canoes and sailing More than 20 terms for canoe parts and associated items are attributable to POc (Pawley and Pawley 1994).  These includes names for parts of a five piece built up hull, end pieces, projecting parts of the outrigger  complex, platform, sail, boom of sail, steering oar, paddles, bailers, rollers for beaching and launching canoes,  and anchor, indicating that POc speakers built substantial ocean-going outrigger canoes. terra australis 26 26 </page> <page sequence="11"> The origins of Early Lapita culture: the testimony of historical linguistics Thirteen of the POc terms continue PMP words (Blust 1995c). Several terms for parts of the canoe  complex are missing from the PMP list, but in some cases we can infer that names for these items were present  in PMP because their existence is logically implied by the presence of other terms, e.g. although there is no  PMP etymon for ‘outrigger float’ the presence of PMP *(c,s)a(R)man ‘outrigger boom’ indicates that it must  have been present. No term for double canoe is attributable to POc. PPn *faʔurua ‘double canoe’ (from *faʔu ‘lashed,  constructed (of house, canoe)’, *rua ‘two’, i.e. two hulls lashed together) is well supported, e.g. by Rennellese  ha ugua, Maori hourua, Tuvalu foulua ‘double canoe’. Compare also Samoan fou-lua-lua ‘bind together, as 2  canoes’, Tongan fo u-vaka ‘build a canoe’. Forms outside of Polynesian that resemble PPn *faʔurua, e.g. Kiribati  baurua, Lau (Malaita) foorua, are very probably loans from Polynesian sources. Fijian drua ‘twin, double canoe’  is likely a separate development. Terms for double canoes in South East Papua and New Caledonia are not  related to the Polynesian cognate set.

Architecture and settlement patterns Seventeen PMP terms have been reconstructed for types of house and parts of the house (Green and Pawley  1999). POc retains 11 of these and has another six that have no known cognates in PMP. The POc house terms  point to solidly built rectangular houses, sometimes raised on stilts, with thatched gable roofs. The existence  of a term for ‘village’ or ‘nucleated settlement’ in POc is uncertain. *panua and *pera are candidates. *panua  is a polysemous word whose senses included ‘land’, ‘inhabited place’ and probably ‘people of a community’,  and it has reflexes that mean ‘village’ in various languages (Pawley 2005).

Fishing technology and methods Fishing and collecting sea invertebrates were clearly very important parts of the economy of PMP and POc  speakers. Table 3 lists 28 POc terms for fishing technology and methods (Osmond 1998b). Continued from  POc are names for one kind of fish net, fishnet float, basketry fish trap, fishing line and pole, spear, corral, fish  drive, fish poison continued from PMP (Blust 1995c). Several other POc terms having to do with fishing have  no known etyma in PMP, including two for kinds of net, one for netting needle and one for dragline. About 140 POc terms for kinds of fish have been reconstructed (Osmond in prep.) and another 50  or so terms for kinds of molluscs, crustaceans and echinoderms (Pawley 1996c) - too many to be listed here.  The totals for PMP are not much smaller. As ethnographic observations show (Dye 1983; Kirch and Dye 1979)  different kinds of fish require different capture methods. Thus, indirect evidence for several fishing techniques  can be found in the archaeological record, in the range of fish species caught (Walter 1989).  terra australis 26 2  </page> <page sequence="14"> Oceanic Explorations: Lapita and Western Pacific Settlement Table 3: Terms for fishing methods and technology 1.

Blust (1995c) argues that one term (*beRek) referred solely  to domestic pigs and the other (*babuy) was a generic name for pigs, and was used in compounds to denote  categories of pig and pig-like animals. At any rate, only *beRek was retained in POc. There is some evidence  for a second POc term for ‘pig, (?) sow’, *bukas, which had no PMP etymon.  No POc term for ‘domestic fowl, chicken’ is well supported, although chicken bones occur in  Early Lapita sites. The PMP name for the domestic fowl, *manuk, appears in POc as the generic for ‘bird’  (Clark 1994). PMP had a generic term for ‘dog’ but this was not preserved in POc. There are several candidates for  a POc term for ‘dog’ but all are problematic to some extent (Hudson 1989). This is consistent with the absence  of dog remains from early Lapita sites. Its earliest appearance is in Reefs/Santa Cruz plainware assemblages  dating to about 2600 BP, after which it disappears (R. Green pers. comm.).  Table 7: Terms for domestic animals 1.

POc had a second term for axe/adze but there are no clues to how it differed in reference  from *kiRam. Two terms for cutting tools are continued from PMP, one made of turtle shell (named after the  Hawksbill turtle), the other, probably, of bamboo. POc continues PMP *saRum ‘(bone) needle’. Oceanic reflexes  commonly apply to bat-wing needles used for tattooing. POc *nad(r)i appears to have been a general term for any kind of stone whose flakes have a  very sharp edge, such as obsidian, chert and flint. There is, however, a PWOc reconstruction for obsidian,  *qa(r,R)iŋ, that may continue a POC etymon that has been lost elsewhere.  Table 10: Terms for cutting implements and processes 1.

Reflexes often refer to tattooing needle, typically made of wing bone of fruit bat (Osmond and Ross 1998:87).  Clothing, weaving, ornaments and decoration Blust (1995c:493-494) argues that weaving and bark cloth manufacture were both practised by PAn, PMP and  POc societies, though with different emphases. PMP clothing was probably chiefly made from woven cloth,  as indicated by the considerable number of terms relating to weaving of garments that can be reconstructed.  None of these terms have known reflexes in POc, which may point to a greater use of bark cloth. No reflexes  of PMP *qatip ‘backstrap loom’ are known from Oceanic languages. Although Blust observes that the  backstrap loom occurs in several Oceanic societies (in the Banks Is., the Carolines and Santa Cruz) and that  this distribution suggests that it was known to POc speakers, the ethnographic record indicates that the loom  terra australis 26    </page> <page sequence="20"> Oceanic Explorations: Lapita and Western Pacific Settlement spread to Melanesia more recently through Micronesia and Polynesian Outliers.

Table 11 shows only terms of  reference for the relevant proto-languages. About half of the POc reference terms continue PMP etyma, including  those for ‘grandparent’, ‘father’, ‘mother’, ‘mother’s brother’, ‘younger sibling of same sex’, ‘grandchild’,  ‘spouse’, ‘parent-in-law’ and ‘sibling-in-law’. The presence of terms for siblings of opposite sex implies the  existence of descent groups (Blust 1980b, 1994; Hage 1998, 1999a,b). Table 12: Kinship terms of reference PAn PMP POc PCP PPn A.

Only a few of these are known to  come from PAn and/or PMP etyma. There has been some debate over whether POc society had descent groups  and hereditary chieftainship. Hage (1998, 1999a) and Marck (in prep., b) propose, on a variety of grounds, that  POc society had unilineal, probably matrilineal descent groups, and unilocal, underpinned by matrilocal or  matri-avunculocal residence rules. Green (1994, 2002:25-6) proposes that the POc reflex of PMP term *Rumaq  ‘house’ was also used to designate a descent group of some sort, as it is in any societies of eastern Indonesia  but there is little support for this second sense among Oceanic witnesses. Pawley (1982) proposed a pair of POc reconstructions *qalap(s) ‘hereditary leader of a lineage, chief’  and *qadiki ‘son or heir of chief’. He also proposed two further reconstructions: POc *tau mwala, ‘commoner,  person of low rank’ and (to an early Oceanic stage, ancestral to Micronesian and Polynesian) *kainaŋa ‘lineage,  higher descent group’. Lichtenberk (1986) revised the form of the first reconstruction to *ta-la(m)pat (a compound  of *ta- ‘man’, *la(m)pat ‘big, great’) and argued that its meaning is indeterminate between ‘chief’ and ‘big- man’. He also proposed that the reconstructed meaning of *tau mwala is indeterminate between ‘commoner’  and ‘worthless person’. Hage (1999a,b) and Blust (1995c) give other reasons for thinking that POc society had  hereditary rank. Archaeologists point to features of Lapita pottery, especially the highly decorated vessels  with stands, which suggest differential rank in Lapita society. Lichtenberk (1986) also revised the gloss for  POc *adiki to ‘eldest child’ (we now write this form as *ariki), and argued that it was preceded by the personal  article *qa to mark it as a kin term.

The initial dispersal of the Malayo-Polynesian languages appears to be a classic case of this type  of rapid spread. In the space of 1000 years, between about 4000 and 3000 BP, people speaking the descendants  of a single ancestral language-culture system spread from the Philippines into the Indo-Malaysian archipelago  and Northwest Melanesia and then on into Remote Oceania. We can only date this sequence of movements  by correlating it with archaeological events. Such a large demographic and cultural event should have left  archaeological footprints and clearly this is so. Lexical reconstructions greatly extend the archaeological record for the Austronesian-linked Neolithic  cultures of the Philippines c. 4000-3600 BP (equated with PMP), the Bismarck Archipelago c. 3300-3100 BP (POc),  Fiji ca 3000 BP (PCP) and the Tonga-Samoa region c. 2000-1500 BP (PPn). The extensions apply particularly to  non-material culture but also to material culture. For example, the outrigger canoe complex is missing from  the relevant archaeological records, as is most of the house complex and almost all traces of the fishing net  complex but these are all well attested in the linguistic record.  It can be seen that in most of the 11 lexical fields considered here there is very considerable continuity  between PMP and POc, strongly supporting the conclusion that the Early Lapita cultural complex in large part  continues a Southeast Asian tradition, and that there is considerable continuity in PCP and PPn. Many elements  of this tradition were continued in PCP and PPn society. The powerful linguistic evidence for an Austronesian  dispersal of the outrigger canoe complex, fishing techniques, house types and settlement patterns, agriculture  and so on, does not preclude the possibility that some of the same cultural elements already existed in northwest  Melanesia in pre-Lapita times. All it shows is that Austronesian speakers already had these elements when  they entered northwest Melanesia.  What of those artefacts in the archaeological record considered to be indeterminate between “intrusion”  and “integration”, i.e. between an Austronesian-linked Southeast Asian origin and a pre-Austronesian origin  in Near Oceania? Recall that Spriggs’ list for this indeterminate category includes oval/lenticular polished  adzes, grindstones, hinge-region Tridacna adzes, pierced shell pendants, shell beads, Trochus armbands, one- piece fishhooks, bone points or awls, vegetation clearance by fire, shellfishing and reef fishing, earth ovens  and most of the Oceanic domesticated crop complex. There is continuity in the general terms for axe/adze and handle but these give no indication as to  the material or shape of the axe/adze itself or manner of hafting. The absence of a PMP term for stone oven  or earth oven suggests that this method of cooking may have been borrowed by Austronesian speakers when  they entered the Moluccas or Melanesia. There is continuity between PMP and POc in terms for angling (words  for fishhook, line, and trolling lure) and in the term for the Trochus shell and armbands made from this.  PMP terms for the root crop complex and for some of the tree crops persist in POc, along with a  number of words for agricultural practices. The fact that POc speakers carried their tradition of root and  tree crop cultivation with them with them does not preclude the possibility that some of the plants were  first domesticated in the New Guinea area, and that they moved westwards into Island Southeast Asia in  the millennia before the Austronesian dispersal. A number of domesticated plants of New Guinea origin are  candidates for this status (Kennedy 2007; Kennedy and Clarke 2004; Yen 1991). However, that is another story,  separate from the question of the immediate origins of the Lapita culture. terra australis 26    </page> <page sequence="24"> Oceanic Explorations: Lapita and Western Pacific Settlement On interaction between Austronesian and non-Austronesian communities  in the early Lapita period Finally, let us turn to the third question: Can linguistics say anything about the interaction between speakers  of Austronesian and non-Austronesian languages in the early Lapita period? Some bold speculations recently  put forward by Spriggs can serve as a point of departure:  My current view is that ... Lapita represents a new ethnic identity in the western Pacific,  forged around a new prestige language (now labelled Proto-Oceanic Austronesian), which was spoken  by people of originally disparate geographical and genetic origins. The new language was used to  encode powerful origin myths to unite this disparate population, and Lapita pottery designs had an  originally important role in the ritual performance of this group’s identity ... This new iconography  in the material culture, often representing an anthropomorphic face - perhaps the putative ancestor  figure? - was an important mobilising and legitimating force as the Lapita culture was spread from  the Bismarcks out into the Pacific ... (Spriggs 2003:205) I read Spriggs as implying, in the first part of this passage, that while the Proto Oceanic language and its  original speakers were intruders to the Bismarcks this language was soon learnt by diverse communities  in the Bismarck Archipelago who were originally speakers of non-Austronesian languages and who were  biologically distinct from the immigrant Austronesians. Learning the Lapita language was essential for these  outsiders to gain entry into Lapita society. A further implication is that these originally non-Austronesian  speaking communities also adopted much of the immigrants’ material culture and social organisation while  also retaining elements of their own.  What evidence can be found to test these speculations? I will leave aside the matter of biology and  concentrate on language. On the linguistic front we have to look for evidence that might distinguish between  acquisition of POc by communities of second language speakers and continuous transmission by successive  generations of native speakers.5 Unfortunately, it is virtually impossible to find direct evidence of specific  lexical borrowings from non-Austronesian languages into Oceanic that may have occurred in the Bismarcks  some 3000 years ago – for one thing, the donor languages are unlikely to have left descendants. However,  statistical evidence of borrowing may be sought by examining the number and nature of replacements in the  lexicon of POc itself, compared with earlier stages, or in that of the immediate descendants of POc, namely  proto-languages ancestral to high order subgroups of Oceanic, compared to POc. Blust (1993) reconstructed PMP, PCEMP, PCMP and POc forms for the Swadesh 200 item basic  vocabulary list and calculated the number of retentions and losses in each of the daughter proto-languages  below PMP, with results as shown in Table 14. Table 14: Percentages of PMP basic vocabulary (Swadesh 200 word list) retained in PCEMP, PCMP and POc Proto Central-Eastern MP . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  98 Proto Central MP  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  94 Proto Oceanic . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  88 POc replaced 12 % of PMP items on the PMP list. If we assume a 600 year gap between PMP and POc  (a rough estimate based on the archaeological dates for the arrival of an Austronesian-associated Neolithic in  the northern Philippines and Bismarcks, respectively) this gives a replacement rate of 2 percent per century,  or 20 percent per millennium, which is almost exactly the mean rate of loss recorded for the sample of Indo- European languages used by Swadesh in his pioneering studies of rates of lexical replacement in the 1950s.  terra australis 26  0 </page> <page sequence="25"> The origins of Early Lapita culture: the testimony of historical linguistics There is no evidence here that extensive borrowing from non-Austronesian sources took place in the line of  descent leading from PMP to POc.  The next place to look for signs of major perturbations in basic lexicon is in the proto-languages  of the better-documented high-order subgroups of Oceanic. If language contact in the Bismarcks in the  immediate post-POc period led to many lexical replacements these should show up in reconstructions of the  proto-languages.  A recent study (Pawley 2007) compares retention rates for a sample of basic vocabulary in two  subgroups of Oceanic, Northwest Solomonic and Southeast Solomonic, that are believed to have had very  different histories of contact. In the area occupied by the Northwest Solomonic subgroup (Buka-Bougainvillle,  Choiseul, the New Georgia Group and Santa Isabel) some 10 non-Austronesian languages still survive in two  locations; Bougainville and the New Georgia Group. Two more non-Austronesian languages are spoken on  Savo and Russell, small islands close to Guadalcanal on the eastern margin of the Northwest Solomonic group  and the western margin of Southeast Solomonic. These 12 or so languages fall into several apparently unrelated  families and are thought to be the relics of a much larger number of non-Austronesian languages that occupied  the region when Oceanic speakers arrived. By contrast, there is reason to think that the region occupied by  Southeast Solomonic languages had very few occupants when Oceanic speakers arrived. No non-Austronesian  languages survive there (although two are spoken immediately to the west, on Savo and Russell).  The baseline in this study consisted of reconstructions of the 60 POc words with the highest high  retention rates. A retention rate for each word was established by comparing basic vocabulary in 40 different  contemporary Oceanic languages. Some 3000 years after the breakup of POc the more conservative Oceanic  languages, such as those of Fiji and Polynesia, generally retain around 80 percent of these 60 words without  significant change of meaning. The study found a very large difference between the two subgroups. All Northwest Solomonic  languages in the sample have replaced many more of the POc words than any of the Southeast Solomonic  languages. Among Southeast Solomonic languages the average percentage of retentions is 73. The highest  single percentage is 86 and the lowest is 65. Within Northwest Solomonic the average percentage of retentions  is 49. The highest is 59 and the lowest is 40. The explanation given for this striking and consistent difference  was that Northwest Solomonic languages have borrowed heavily from non-Austronesian languages while  Southeast Solomonic languages have not. There seems to be no other reasonable explanation. When did the large scale replacements take place in Northwest Solomonic? It can be shown that the  replacements take different forms in different branches of Northwest Solomonic. The proto-language of the  Northwest Solomonic group was lexically quite conservative: it had replaced only about four of the 60 POc  words, giving a retention rate of 93 percent. (The figure for Proto Southeast Solomonic is similar.) That it to say,  most of the large scale lexical change in Northwest Solomonic languages occurred after Northwest Solomonic  speakers had dispersed across the region and, presumably, after they had established stable contacts with non- Austronesian speech communities, leading to long-term bilingualism and language shift.  The same study found that Proto Central Pacific (ancestral to Fijian, Rotuman and Polynesian)  retained all of the 60 POc lexical items and Proto Polynesian kept 55 of the 60. By this measure, PCP was a  very conservative Oceanic language and PPn also very conservative, considering that it belongs to a time 1000  years or more after the breakup of POc. No precise figures are available for other high-order subgroups, such  as Proto Admiralties, Proto Western Oceanic, Proto Meso-Melanesian, Proto North &amp; Central Vanuatu and  Proto Micronesian but my impression is that all will be found to retain 55 or more of the 60 items.  I read the lexical evidence as indicating that when Oceanic speakers first moved into Remote Oceania  at about 3200-3100 BP they spoke a language little changed from POc. This in turn suggests that in the first few  generations after Oceanic speakers arrived in the Bismarck Archipelago contact with non-Austronesian speakers  was seldom of the kind that led Oceanic speakers to borrow basic vocabulary or for non-Austronesian speech  terra australis 26    </page> <page sequence="26"> Oceanic Explorations: Lapita and Western Pacific Settlement communities to shift to Oceanic languages. Events of that kind were to become commonplace in various parts of  Northwest Melanesia but not until somewhat later (see various papers in Dutton and Tryon 1994 and also Bradshaw  1995, Pawley 2006, Ross 1996c for a consideration of social and linguistic mechanisms associated with large scale  borrowing and language shift in Melanesia). These conclusions are not inconsistent with archaeologists’ findings  about the preferred site locations of Early Lapita sites in the Bismarcks and the maintenance of intensive contacts  between dispersed Lapita communities for the first few generations. The DNA record indicates that outsiders who  entered Lapita communities as spouses were chiefly males. This is consistent with POc society as being matrilocal,  with children growing up speaking the language of their mother and mother’s sisters (Marck in prep., a). Notes 1. I am grateful to Roger Green, Jeff Marck, Malcolm Ross and Matthew Spriggs for helpful comments on drafts of this  paper. 2. I draw on a considerable literature on Austronesian culture history viewed from the standpoint of lexical reconstructions  and subgrouping and, in particular, on a masterly overview by Blust (1995c). Other relevant works include, for the early  stages of Austronesian, Blust (1976, 1980a,b, 1985) and Zorc (1994) and some of the contributions to Pawley and Ross  (1994), for Proto Oceanic, Chowning (1991), Green (1994), Pawley and Green (1973, 1984), Pawley and Ross (1995) and  Ross et al. (1998, 2003, in prep.), for Proto Polynesian, Kirch and Green (2001) and Marck (2000), as well as more general  inter-disciplinary syntheses by Bellwood (1978, 1997), Kirch (1997, 2000), Shutler and Marck (1975), Pawley (2002) and  Spriggs (1997). See also the references in the section on Austronesian lexical reconstructions. However, none of these works  explicitly examines the lexical evidence pertaining to questions (1)-(3).  3. For a fuller bibliography of comparative historical works on Oceanic see Lynch et al. (2002).  4. Of course the words reconstructed for each stage are not all retentions from earlier stages. In every language there is  constant lexical change: over time some words are completely lost and others undergo shifts of meaning. For example,  about 140 fish names have been reconstructed for POc (Ross et al. in prep.). Of these, 85 have reflexes in PCP and about  57 in PPn (Ross et al. in prep.). That is to say, according to these data, PCP lost about 40 % of the fish names reconstructed  for POc and PPn lost about 60 %. The interval between POc and PPn was probably on the order of 1500 years - plenty of  time to accumulate many changes. 5. Spriggs (pers.comm.) suggests that, given that the Lapita language became a badge of membership in the new prestige  society in the Bismarck Archipelago, non-Austronesian speakers had to acquire it ‘properly’, without lots of foreignisms, and  that this would explain why we don’t find traces of extensive borrowing in POc or its immediate descendants. Unfortunately  this claim, which assumes nativelike transmission in all cases, is not falsifiable linguistically. Indirect evidence for it must  be sought in the genetic makeup of populations of Oceanic speakers.  References Allen, J. and C. Gosden (eds) 1991. Report of the Lapita Homeland Project.
