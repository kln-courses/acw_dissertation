The sensationalistic title of this new work by Nutini and Roberts clashes with the strict academic tone of most of its content. Bloodsucking Witchcraft is a lengthy, painstak- ingly researched and compiled monograph treating a specific component of the magico-folk religious complex in central Mexico. Indeed, Tlaxcala is an area Nutini knows well, having conducted fieldwork in the state for over three decades, resulting in numerous detailed studies on topics ranging from the Day of the Dead (Todos Santos in Rural Tlaxcala, Princeton University Press, (1988) to godparenthood {Ritual Kinship, Princeton University Press, 1980). However, the relevance of this particular study extends beyond Mexico, since Nutini and Roberts are dealing with the phenomenon of witchcraft itself, a celebrated topic in anthropology since Evans- Pritchard. Bloodsucking witchcraft in Tlaxcala involves witches, called tlahuelpuchis, believed to transfer themselves into animals to suck blood from sleeping infants. The book is topically compartmentalised into chapters providing background for the analysis of this specific expression of supernaturalism. The reader is taken through meticulous description of the ideology of bloodsucking witchcraft, an in-depth history of the syncretic development of anthropomorphic supernaturalism in Mesoamerica, and a fascinating empirical account of an actual witchcraft epidemic, including its analysis in several aspects. The authors then use their examination of bloodsucking</page><page sequence="2">100 BULLETIN OF LATIN AMERICAN RESEARCH witchcraft as a vehicle by which to forward their 'epistemological approach' to the study of magic and religious supernaturalism. Nutini and Roberts argue that previous examinations of witchcraft have failed to attend sufficiently to both normative structures and psychological components in their explanations of witchcraft phenomena. Their own response is an attempt to explain a concrete case of supernaturalism focused on a native theory of knowledge, in which people's understandings and interpretations are shaped by a normative system which is made manifest in a very specific cultural context. By seeing how a combination of 'etic' psychological factors and 'emic' normative expectations are played out in a parti? cular event attributed to supernatural agency, the authors feel they have arrived at a formula which can illuminate how people draw a logical relation between supernatural beliefs and actual physical occurrences. In some ways this aspect of analysis represents the most interesting facet of their study, largely because it has been accomplished so thoroughly and in such fastidious detail. However, Nutini and Roberts may be overestimating the value of their proposed analytical model. Some criticisms which may be levelled at their study are rooted in the problematic framework in which it is set. Their data are derived from research under- taken in the 1960s, and the analysis represents a retrospective exploration of a pheno- menon which the authors claim no longer exists. But the book does not move outside ofthe parameters of a somewhat stiff, positivist, clinical approach to supernaturalism, concerned more with tracing the path of epistemological causation and sociopsycho- logical function and effect rather than the articulation of bloodsucking witchcraft with the wider cultural sphere. This criticism is lent weight when one notices that only a tiny portion of references cited in the bibliography are more recent than 1980, more current approaches to witchcraft (dealing, for example, with the problems and com- plexities in interpreting the ontology of metaphysicad phenomena) having been over- looked. While one cannot include everything, what has been left out here favours a lop-sided understanding of the overall phenomenon. True, in addition to their epistemological preoccupations, Nutini and Roberts are presenting an essentially historical account of witchcraft in Tlaxcala (using that deceptive trope of the eternal 'ethnographic present') but their evolutionist per? spective tries to make sense of cross-cultural differences in witchcraft practices according to typologising 'stages' of technological development and rising rationahty according to 'natural law' (perhaps inclusion of analysis of the authors' own epistemo- logy would have been appropriate?). Further, the process of change of Tlaxcalan supernaturalism is envisaged as one of externally generated 'culture loss and decay', rather than simple transformation. The result is a remote, vague sense of the social context of bloodsucking witchcraft, the people who are the 'objects' of study (indi- vidual Tlaxcalans are absent except for scanty inclusion of the testimonies of relatives of victims or of those accused as witches), not to mention the reader's confusion as to the temporal context of the diagnostic, speculative remarks with which the book ends. Thus on one level, Bloodsucking Witchcraft stands as an exemplar of dated 'salvage ethnography', involving Tlaxcalans who are supposedly 'losing the cultural identity which they've had since the Spanish Conquest'. Nutini and Roberts solemnly forecast the demise of supernaturalism, claiming that folk religion is heading towards orthodox Catholicism and that in some communities few folk elements still exist. The huge diversity within Tlaxcala's religious climate (even in rural settings), not to mention the myriad changes to current belief or ideological systems presently taking place, are here glossed over in a manner which is seriously misleading. Despite the very apparent academic rigour evidenced elsewhere in the book, the above problems undermine this study's capacity to provide a contemporary under? standing of the dynamics of religious/ideological change in rural Mexico. Yet, even in</page><page sequence="3">BOOKREVIEWS 101 view of its faults, Bloodsucking Witchcraft undeniably merits praise for its significant contribution to the ethnographic record of Mexican supernaturalism, and is surely worthwhile reading for anyone interested in aspects of the analysis of witchcraft, sorcery and magic within anthropology, or psychological/medical anthropology generally.
