<plain_text><page sequence="1">Marketing Management and the Computer: An Overview of Conflict and Contrast ROBERT J. KEGERREIS A few marketing groups are engaged in sophisticated computer applications; others are at an elementary stage and in conflict with computer service departments. Most firms operate marketing in- formation systems which lag behind computer techniques. An overview of the situation is offered with organizational recommendations. W HEN John Diebold wrote "ADP-The Still Sleeping Giant" he referred to the power of computer technology as contrasted with the relatively low order of applications.' In large measure the situation still persists. Computer equipment continues to ad- vance in dimensions of speed, storage capacity, and interactive capability. Utilization of the computer by marketing management remains at a level far below that made possible by the latest technology. There is widespread support for this kind of con- clusion. Amstutz, Edelman, Weinberg, and other theoreticians and practitioners have made similar observations.2 Background An understanding of the current state of affairs is aided by recalling the sponsorship of the first computers to be used in most companies. Fifteen years ago computers were a corporate novelty that often were purchased under a justification that payrolls could be reduced by a figure greater than the expenses of renting the computer. The early computers were used primarily as high speed, large capacity calculators that could digest quantities of routine data and relieve corporate personnel from the drudgery of repeti- tive bookkeeping tasks. Therefore, one of the original internal organizational sponsors was the accounting department. The other typical sponsor was the technical staff of the corporation-the engineers, scientists, technicians, and the R&amp;D group-who needed the computer to handle mathematical problems which were too com- plicated for the electric calculators of the day. Marketing departments were neither advised nor consulted in the acquisition and utilization of the corporate computer in this stage of development. The continuation of these early influences remains highly visible in many companies, both large and small. In several large corporations in a basic industry studied by the author, the computer services department is found to be still under the control and leadership of the controller. In these cases, ac- counting needs come first, and the remaining computer time is allocated by the controller's office on the basis of direct cost savings justification-a criterion which does not permit adventuresome experimentation in solving marketing problems. One writer con- tends that most companies continue to make decisions about com- Journal of Marketing, Vol. 35 (January, 1971), pp. 3-12. 1 John Diebold, "ADP-The Still Sleeping Giant," Harvard Business Review, Vol. 42 (September-October, 1964). 2 "The Dawn of the Age of Computers," Marketing/Communications, Vol. 298 (March, 1970), pp. 47-53. 3</page><page sequence="2">4 Journal of Marketing, January, 1971 puter usage on the basis of the wrong criteria entirely.3 Controllers, however, tended to be more open to alternative corporate users than in those early cases in which computers were acquired by the engineering-technical area of corporate organiza- tions. Technicians fostered very little subsequent diffusion of computer services within the total or- ganization. Instead there was a tendency to pro- tect the specialized computer center from inroads by more mundane users like marketers. This con- dition eventually forced the acquisition of separate computer facilities for the remainder of the or- ganization. These twin historical movements explain, in part, the interesting lag in marketing usage of the com- puter. The lag is most pronounced in companies that have not yet abandoned their production ori- entation. These firms tend to view marketing sim- plistically as the function of selling products whose characteristics are determined elsewhere in the organization. At the other extreme are companies that have adopted the marketing concept; therefore, they have a buyer orientation and tend to supply their market- ing executives with computer-based assistance. These "marketing companies" can be found in a variety of fields, but appear usually to be most prevalent among manufacturers of consumer or convenience products that are frequently purchased, or in situa- tions whose characteristics compel the successful company to develop an understanding and affinity with their customers. Early Marketing Leaders in Computer Usage In a "marketing company" today easy access can be gained to the computer for the handling of mar- keting problems. In these companies the marketing orientation or the marketing concept dominated the organization from the executive suite to the travel- ing salesman. Computer services were acquired as a part of the total marketing management capabili- ties, and information systems were inaugurated that were specified and supported by top manage- ment. This relatively ideal situation is found in such marketing companies as Pillsbury, where trained computer communicators are located in marketing, production, research and planning groups in every division and subsidiary in the firm.4 There are many other well-known companies which have model information systems that encompass the marketing areas-Standard Oil of Indiana, First National Bank of Chicago, Litton Industries, Inc., Boeing, Martin-Marietta, and General Foods to name a few. Litton's information system receives monthly data from 225 profit centers and produces comprehensive output that is only eight days older than the original data. The plan at Litton is to install picturephone screens in executive offices in order to answer the "what if" type of inquiries. Marketing strategies are reviewed regularly based upon the data supplied by the MIS report. The included cost data enable managers to probe profit areas that are below normal and to uncover the relevant marketing, engineering, or production problems.5 In addition to the preceding heterogenous cate- gory of "marketing companies" are more specific subfields in marketing which contain many pio- neers in the exploitation of computer potentials. These include: (1) segments of retailing and whole- saling, (2) independent marketing research agen- cies and academic marketing departments, and (3) advertising agencies and their research departments. As a class example, department stores, grocery chains, and variety store chains took the lead many years ago in developing systems of warehouse and retail store inventory control. The earlier, hand- operated systems were based on simple arithmetic involving enormous detail, making the transfer to computers logical, welcome, and relatively simple. Since those days (in the late 1950s) these systems have grown in sophistication to the point where some organizations have continuous control of order- ing, product movement analysis, and inventory re- porting "driven" directly from the cash register on the sales floor.6 Marketing and advertising researchers both in the field and in academic institutions have, over the past 15 years, developed increasingly complex ana- lytical procedures for exploring certain aspects of marketing such as consumer behavior that can be handled only by computers with fairly large core capacity.7 The development of multivariate statisti- 3John Diebold, "Bad Decisions on Computer Use," Harvard Business Review, Vol. 47 (January- February, 1969), pp. 14-176. 4 Address by Terrance Harold, president, The Pills- bury Co., to the Founders Conference of the Society for Management Information Systems Proceedings, Minneapolis, Minnesota, September 8, 1969. 5 "Litton's Electrical Information Machine," Business Week (March 28, 1970), pp. 158-162. 6 Diana Daly, "The Computer as Middleman in Chain Retailing," Computer Decisions (September, 1969), pp. 38-60. 7 W.

At an earlier date, researchers used external data (from census and trade sources) and internal data to develop sales territory analy- sis, product evaluation, and gross segmentation strategies. Research departments in advertising agencies have taken the lead in developing algorithms that produce optimal solutions to media mix problems. These techniques are almost always based on linear programming or derivative forms of this mathe- matical model.13 New variations of these techniques have appeared with regularity.14 One example of the complexity of problems that can be handled only by computers is a multivariate regression analysis that included 1,070 Life magazine advertisements and employed six readership models.15 Among the interesting possibilities is further research involv- ing heuristic programming approaches, which Aaker, and Little and Lodish have advanced, and which were analyzed by Shocker.16 Situational Analysis Prior to this point, this article has constituted a study in contrasts, an examination of the poles of the spectrum, rather than an attempt to con- struct a composite profile of marketing computer users. The author has had experience with billion- dollar corporations in which there is little inter- action between marketing personnel and those who head the computer service department. On the other hand, there are firms that actively use com- prehensive computer-based marketing information systems together with simulation techniques, sen- sitivity analysis and other sophisticated techniques that rely on computer support. It seems the bulk of American firms lies between the two extremes and cluster about the middle. The explanatory data and prescriptive comment for the current situation appear to be classifiable into three groups: (1) organization, (2) the "na- ture" and standing of marketing, and (3) socio- psychological and economic variables at work among the principal participants-marketers, and com- puter service executives. To set the stage for the development of these three categories, an actual case is presented in the following scenario: The author is discussing computers and market- ing with the president of a multinational com- pany that manufactures and markets convenience (novelty) food items and associated packaging, labels, and machinery. Sales and production op- erations are conducted at seven locations in the United States and in several foreign countries. The president has just finished his explanation of the monthly computer printout of the market- ing program package that had been developed for the company as a part of the purchase arrange- ment for their third generation computer. The printout displayed tables that contained sales of every product by territory, by salesman, and by customer. It presented inventory levels and data on gross margins, expenses, and profitability by products and by customers, and also compared certain items with the preceding month and with year-ago data. Q: How do you use this printout? A: I look for changes that mean something-a drop in sales to a big customer (competitor switched strategy ?), an unusual increase in sales of a product (our price too low?), a steady decline in a territory (salesman drinking again?), or a product that no longer is carrying its weight (redesign needed?). Q: What is your own background ? A: I became a salesman on the road with this company after college and World War II; later I became a vice president of sales and finally presi- dent four years ago. Q: Do the salesmen use these printouts? A: Oh yes. We expect each salesman to study his 8 Jagdish N.

Q: How about planning-do these tables help there? A: Yes and no. Having the data in hand tends to make the salesmen forecast simple percentage increases rather than analyze their real market potentials; but on balance the data help make our forecasts more realistic. The difference between actual and forecast performance has narrowed since we began to produce these printouts. At first, we reacted too soon to any changes, now we check more carefully before taking action. Another ad- vantage is that everyone knows exactly how profit- able each product is, and we now expect our sales- men to try to balance their sales rather than to push our low margin items only. Q: Does this report help you in introducing new products, or in entering new market areas? A: No, not really. For one thing, we don't trust those models of new products you talk about. This report, of course, may show growing strength in a class of products, leading us to expand our of- ferings selectively at an earlier point than we might have otherwise. Basically though, we rely on our accumulated experience to decide on new products and new markets. We take a gamble now and then, and try to limit our risks. We get some surprises, too, that no computer could predict. For example, Australia turned out to be a far bigger, more profitable market for us than compact, densely populated England. Another example-one of our products doubled in sales when we changed the package design. Could computerized information have predicted either outcome? Q: Who controls the use of the computer? Who would decide whether to spend $7,000 to develop a new computer program for the marketing division? A: Well, our director of computer services re- ports directly to me, but the executive committee would advise me in deciding the issue you are posing-whether to spend the $7,000. Q: Do you foresee any expansion of your com- puter programs for marketing within the next year or so? A: No, we're satisfied with the present service. We are also afraid that if we expand the printouts very much, our people may not read the larger flow of information as carefully as they do now. They are already complaining about the paper blizzard. The above discussion is a good example of that group of firms whose poles are the marketing com- pany with a complete marketing information system (at one end) and the production-oriented firm with little or no computer support for its marketing management (at the other end). The scenario shows that this particular but typical company does use its computer for a rather analytical treatment of sales data, followed by managerial reaction. It is fully aware that the computer can be used effec- tively to produce useful cuts across its disaggre- gated data base at a level of detail and speed not previously available. On the other hand, the com- pany prefers to tackle many critical marketing de- cisions without the aid of computer-based analyses, relying instead on intuition and experience. Three Explanatory and Prescriptive Categories Variations in the degree with which companies use the computer to assist marketing managers can be best described by three classes of explanatory data: organization or structure, nature and stand- ing of marketing itself, and sociopsychological and economic information. Organization Charts.-Organizational charts frequently do not reveal very much to a researcher, especially if they are supplanted on the job by active sociometric patterns, or by temporary task force or ad hoc relationships. In Figure 1, however, the reader views a working chart that traces actual power flows in a major U.S. manufacturing corporation. The computer services have been centralized and the organizational line (emphasized in the chart) goes vertically into the vice-presidential level with- out passing through any of the traditional func- tional divisions such as manufacturing, research, finance, or marketing. Administrative services in this kind of company command such a significant share of the corporate resources that it can stand alone. This design has predictable advantages and disadvantages. Benefits include the semblance of freedom from the domination by any one of the functional managers (the primary reason for the choice of this plan by this particular company), and the capacity to provide very specialized mana- gerial research and analysis. A drawback, often present, is the lack of com- puter knowhow and consequent communications gap in the areas outside the administrative ser- vices department. This knowledge gap has developed into a very real organizational problem in many companies. Certain manufacturing managers, in General Electric, for example, were finally forced to employ translators to work as communicators between computer systems personnel and the pro- duction and marketing staff. At Ashland Oil, the author found that the computer services director had adopted a team approach to counteract this condition, and had staffed his own systems group with specialists in marketing, finance, operations research, chemistry, physics, geology, and account- ancy. At Pillsbury the problem was approached by placing computer specialists in each of the major operating areas so that each manager had a "man of his own" to carry out the liaison with the com- puter department. This "gap" can also have im- portant psychological aspects, as discussed later in the article.</page><page sequence="5">Marketing Management and the Computer: An Overview of Conflict and Contrast 7 CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD PRES I DENT EXECUTI VE VICE PRESIDENTS FOR COMMERC I AL AND I NTERNATIONAL CONSUMER I NDUSTRI AL TECHN I CAL ADMI NI STRAT ION OPERATIONS PRODUCTS PRODUCTS I VICE PRESIDENTS FOR *TECHNICAL OCORPORATE *FINANCE OCORPORATE FACILITIES OPERSONNEL *GENERAL *NEW PRODUCT DI RECTOR PLANN I NG COUNSEL PLANN I NG I ANID FOR SEVERAL OPERATING &amp; MANUFACTURING DIVISIONS DIRECTOR OF INFORMATIONAL SERVICES AND COMPUTATIONAL CENTER I I I I I MANAGER OF DIRECTOR OF CHIEF, DIRECTOR OF DIRECTOR OF COMPUTER OPERATIONS SYSTEMS ECONOMIC MARKET OPERATIONS ANALYSIS AND ANALYSIS AND ANALYSIS AND RESEARCH SECTION FINANCIAL SALES ANALYSIS FORECASTING SECTION DIRECTOR OFI LIBRARY AND MANAGER, PUBL I CATIONS TECHN I CAL TRAINING FIGURE 1. Computer services in a large corporation. The typical organizational format for smaller companies is that in which the services of the computer are housed in and dispensed by a tradi- tional department, such as finance. However, this situation offers no more guarantee of relief than that portrayed by Figure 1. In this kind of com- pany the author found that on the average only a relatively shallow level of sophistication had been reached in dealing with marketing problems. Man- agers in these companies tend to agree with the con- clusions of Greiner, Leitch, and Barnes who doubt that management supplied with more objectively quantified information will make better judgments about the performance of their operating units and contend that computer generated statistics are no substitute for management intuition.17 Services for marketing performed at this level include sales analyses, inventory control, and distribution costs analysis. These are very helpful and tend to pro- duce greater efficiencies within the firm, but they, like all accounting systems, are backward looking. The manager must make his own interpretive con- clusions about how these data relate to his optimal future action. An Ideal Organizational Framework.-The author weighed the competing claims for the various or- ganizational styles and concluded that, on the aver- age, marketing needs can most effectively be justi- fled and served within the framework of a neutral or independent computer operations department headed by an information systems specialist and reporting directly to a vice president for adminis- tration (or in even larger companies, to a vice president for information services). A combination functional and partial organiza- tion chart (Figure 2) sets forth the recommended format for informational services in a medium to large company. In this environment, marketing activi- ties need not suffer from ignorance of or inexperience in the computer world on the part of marketing executives. The marketing manager calls upon the services of the computer in a way similar to that used for the secretarial pool or duplicating machines. He has a specialist in group B (Figure 2) who is a communicator-translator and liaison between the computer and marketing. At those benchmark de- cision points in which the company may be con- sidering, for example, a move into market simula- tions, the task force concept is applied. Group A organizes the general attack on the problem, utilizes appropriate systems concepts in acquiring repre- sentative memberships from groups A, B, and C and from the operating departments involved-par- ticularly marketing, marketing research, product managers, sales managers, and distribution man- agers. Finally, this organizational design embodies the 17Larry E. Greiner, D. Paul Leitch, and Louis B.

Recommended organization. service billing concept in which the total cost of the information services department is "billed out" to users in the form of charges for transformation of data (and transcription), systems design, pro- gramming, and computer time. As Mogni states, this enables management to evaluate computer ser- vice to marketing on the classic basis of costs against returns, and should enable marketing to make an effective case for expanding its programs.18 However, the adoption of an organizational plan like that in Figure 2 does not prevent the marketing department from housing its own marketing infor- mation system, such as that suggested by Beren- son.19 The relationship between the system por- trayed by Figure 2 and the total organization is shown as a dynamic interaction in the form of Figure 3. Note that the three groups-A, B, and C (at the left side of Figure 3)-were presented in detail in Figure 2. Feedback in the system is pro- vided both by the multiple linkages among the five major operating elements and by the two vice presi- dents at the level of the executive committee. The Effect of Organizational Format.-While the organizational framework in which computer ser- vices are housed cannot affect the basic nature of the function involved, it can have a powerful in- fluence upon the level of efficiency and utilization of the system. Either inappropriate organizational modes or managerial myopia (from the marketing point of view) can introduce high levels of both noise and friction into this system. For example, in a recent study by Dean, the top computer ex- ecutive was found to report to the controller in 35% of the cases and to other finance officials in an additional 23% of the cases-a dominant in- fluence, compared with the other line divisions.2o In a few striking instances, the author found that key marketers were not consulted about any of the aspects of the development of the corporate computer services department. For example, the director of marketing research for a large com- pany that produces both industrial and consumer goods has never been a part of the planning process for his company's computer services. He has not been approached by the staff of system analysts or designers, and his statistical analyses have not been included in the software package specified for the third generation computers now forming the base for the department. As a result, he buys his com- puter time outside the company. The intracompany customers of the center are finance, engineering, research, "sales," accounting, production, and long- is Ben J.

Flows between systems and groups. range (economic) planning-not marketing re- search. The explanation for this particular case lies in three areas: (1) lack of a top management com- mitment to marketing as a basic orientation for their corporate decisions, (2) lack of marketing knowledge on the part of the computer center staff and conversely the dominance of nonmarketing types in the information systems design phase, and (3) historical background of computer entry into the corporation through a sponsorship far removed from marketing. Figures 2 and 3 specify organizational format, informational flow patterns, and data bases for maximizing the synergistic effect of the systems components. When these concepts are incorporated in an integrated management plan, the full capacity of marketing for exploiting the utility of the com- puter can be developed. Nature and Standing of Marketing Nature of Marketing.-Many marketing problems do not yet yield satisfactorily to quantitative manip- ulation. This truism, rather harmless in isolation, has been used as a defense against expanding the role of the computer in marketing. Marketing is a complicated subject and is composed of an almost infinite number of interacting and interdependent variables. In contrast to a laboratory situation in which conditions can be controlled, measurements taken accurately, and experiments can be expressed in finite mathematical terms, marketing is very complex. Also, because of the aggressive pace of com- puter development, observers often overlook the fact that some theoretical marketing applications depend upon a knowledge of the market that few executives possess, or upon data that are difficult to supply. For example, the most advanced general category of computer programs for marketing is simulation. To build worthwhile simulations, how- ever, marketing managers must provide the system programmer with a detailed, integrated description of all the relevant interacting factors in the market and with approximate weights and values. These factors should incorporate the present detailed data base or should specify the dimensions of a new set of corporate data, and in a framework of logical flow that can be understood and implemented by the programmer. This composite demand, for most marketing executives, is quite formidable. In other words, despite the intriguing array of sophisticated computer-based decision techniques that have been developed by researchers in adver- tising agencies, marketing research departments, and universities, there are very few marketing managers who know about or know how to use these higher order programs. Amstutz discovered in his 1969 survey that dramatic differences exist between the theoretical capabilities of management systems described in the literature and those actu- ally used or planned by operating companies.21 The great bulk of marketing-computer activity is centered on sales data: sales reports, forecasts, and performance measures by salesmen, by product, and by district. Marketing management simply does not yet use, for example, the Urban product line mathe- 21 Arnold E. Amstutz, "Market-Oriented Management Systems: The Current Status," Journal of Marketing Research, Vol. 6 (November, 1969), pp. 481-496.</page><page sequence="8">10 Journal of Marketing, January, 1971 matical model for finding the best marketing mix for each product in a line.22 Similarly, the use of a published and tested model for new product de- mand is still confined to a miniscule portion of the pharmaceutical industry.= In some companies, marketing problems are han- dled within the context of broader corporate analy- sis, investment evaluation, competitive evaluations and other decision factors. Such a firm may have a management information system but not have a separate marketing information system. In an in- terview with the director of corporate research and information systems for a large company, the au- thor found that almost every one of the classic marketing questions was embedded in the frame- work of a comprehensive data analysis program akin to the integrated concept portrayed in Fig- ure 2. For significant decision making, input from the information service concentrated on a full cor- porate review, seldom contemplating marketing by itself. The vice president of marketing and several salesmanagers were provided detailed regular re- ports of more conventional content, while the for- ward decisions of corporate direction were ad- dressed within a total systems context. There is some evidence that business executives have not been impressed by the apparent competi- tion for resources between management information systems and marketing information systems. A forced managerial choice usually favors the former, suggesting that marketing theorists should reap- praise their advocacy of the latter. Insistence upon the total envelope of programs comprising a market- ing information system could delay approval sequen- tially of some of the advantageous analytical parts, such as a submarket simulation, a new product interaction model, a diffusion model, a cluster analy- sis of market segments, or a sales productivity re- view. Nevertheless, there is strong evidence that the computer will be less confined to finance and to administrative services in the future than in the past. Dean's study showed that increasing emphasis on service to operating functions is forecast, and that the use of the computer for planning and con- trol will also increase over the next few years.24 Standing of Marketing.-The author's prolonged investigation supports the observation of Bailey and others who noted that marketers currently use the computer primarily as a reporting device on past and current business, rather than for predic- tive or decision models.25 Why has marketing man- agement proceeded at such a pedestrian pace? One significant factor is the level of commitment to marketing information systems on the part of top management. Almost every researcher who has in- vestigated this field emerges with the conviction that this element (commitment) is absolutely criti- cal in determining the degree to which the system satisfies its users and attains its objectives. A sur- vey of a cross section of companies by McKinsey added further verification to this widely accepted principle.26 In the case scenario presented earlier, the system worked well because each subordinate was keenly aware that the president read each month's com- puter printout thoroughly and promptly, and that he would begin asking questions almost at once. As a result, the data in the printout were regarded as legitimate and meaningful throughout the com- pany. Under conditions of "low commitment," how- ever, it is usually found that new computer print- outs are relatively ignored by the majority of recipients. Data may not be displayed in an easy-to- interpret format, and often there is a lack of both background information and/or a bridge from old to new presentational styles. Finally, the debugging phase often continues for extended periods, during which many managers lose interest and confidence in the new programs. Furthermore, marketing may not be the primary focus of management. It is not unusual for ex- perienced observers in this field to hear statements like that made by a top executive when he told the author that questions about computers and market- ing were not especially interesting to his company because they had "relatively few customers" (1,400 in all) and therefore had little need for the kind of detailed analysis that extensive computerized analysis would provide. This executive was in a metal producing and fabricating corporation in a basic industry known for its conservatism, slow growth, and near absence of the marketing concept. In these situations, the utilization of the computer by marketing will continue to lag. In some companies the needs of the marketing staff are obviously ranked below those of manufac- turing and finance. The situation is further ag- gravated when, as Bailey reports, the computer ser- vices department chief reports organizationally to a financial administrator in two out of three cases, a finding supported by Dean's work.27 Social, Psychological, and Economic Factors This final category of explanatory factors con- tains attitudes, conflicting views among system par- ticipants, communications gaps, and costs and other economic conditions.

Men make decisions by means of a variety of processes, some simply economic and rational in nature, others com- plex and not necessarily repetitive in character. Economic: Costs and Conditions.-Management frequently reports discouraging experiences with grossly underestimated costs for designing and pro- gramming new systems, a history that militates against open receptivity for proposals for still more extensive marketing data analysis. Even when costs are accurately known, justification of the expendi- tures is anything but automatic because these com- pete for corporate resources with other programs. Budgetary tightening tends quickly to dampen expansionary plans for computer applications. Soft- ware firms report that clients' postponements and cancellations of proposals increase drastically in periods of recession. The vulnerability of the growth rate of computer programs design to eco- nomic trends has been convincingly exposed. Some- what surprisingly, despite the depressant of an eco- nomic downturn, the demand exceeds the supply for certain sophisticated classes of systems analysts and designers. The author found in several cases that corporate computer centers were well below authorized strength in specialties, a factor that re- tards growth in applications even when other in- fluences are encouraging. Communications and Generation Gap.-The com- munications gap can easily be documented, indeed it is quite pervasive.28 The author found in his current survey (as did Stasch) that the communi- cations gap which exists in the stereotype organi- zation is aggravated by a "generation gap." Com- puters are new to business organizations while marketing (or at least "sales") is not. Computer service executives on an average are 15-20 years younger than their organizational peers in the sales and/or marketing departments. Marketing execu- tives today can be classified generally as "pre-com- puter types," having received all their formal edu- cation and much of their training before computer technology became a part of the corporate scene. The combination of the inherent communications gap heightened by the age differential produces what an electronics executive described to the au- thor as his most persistent high level sociopsycho- logical problem. On the hopeful side, the director of computational and analytical services for a chemical company told the author he believed that this gap would dissi- pate at an accelerated rate as college graduates from the 1970s and the late 1960s began to work their way up in the corporate hierarchy. In turn this implies to universities that henceforth a mini- mum education in business must include a conversa- tional capability with computers. Attitudes Toward Computers.-In many cases, top executives portray an interesting paradox. On the one hand they extoll the coming of age of the computer while on the other hand they complain about the inadequacy of computer analyses of their situations. They express a lack of confidence in "computer solutions" as being too quantified, having too many assumptions and restrictive conditions, especially those that are implicit but unstated. Some computer service departments, eager to display their potential usefulness, certainly have been guilty of promising too much too soon. Earlier output often contained irrelevant data and outright errors. Several respondents related tales of mis- applications and misalignments which eroded the confidence of the user. An example was the case of a company that developed a program to identify new sales prospects. Census data, SIC groups and the national input-output table were analyzed in combination with the current customer list of the company. The resulting printout was a list of prospective customers by salesman's territory. Un- fortunately, the salesmen had not been conditioned to expect any errors, but there were many. The basic data were four to five years old, companies had moved or gone out of business, and in many cases the salesmen had already fruitlessly called for years on some of the "prospects" specified by the computer program. The salesman was also affronted by the clear implication that a computer "knew" more about his territory than he did. "Let the com- puter get out here and sell," was a typical reaction. It has been repeated ad nauseam that computers are inanimate, nonjudgmental, mechanical, dumb, and completely servile, yet managers persist in characterizing the computer as possessing a per- sonality, usually diabolical. The anthropomorphic computer is a staple conversational gambit and a perceived threat to some marketing managers. The greater the manager's familiarity with the com- puter, the more stable and rational is his attitude toward it. Conclusions and Forecast The author consulted marketing managers, cor- porate executives, computer hardware and software representatives, managers of computer and compu- tational centers, other researchers, public reports, and private publications, in preparing this over- view of marketing and the computer. A wide range of computer usages was found among companies of the same size and type, and an even broader dis- tribution of usage existed when the whole field of marketing was studied. Many marketing execu- tives are unfamiliar with or mistrustful of what computers can do for them or to them. In addition, there is a gulf between the academic computer model and its marketing application. The age of simulation has not arrived in the executive suite. Much of the variation among companies can be 28 Stanley F. Stasch, "Systems Analysis for Con- trolling and Improving Marketing Performance," JOURNAL OF MARKETING, Vol. 33 (April, 1969), pp. 12-19.</page><page sequence="10">12 Journal of Marketing, January, 1971 explained by analyzing the influences of the his- torical background of computers in business, the organizational structures that exist and their effect on usage and users, the nature of marketing and its adaptability to quantification, the status of market- ing in the company, the social and psychological factors at work, and the economic considerations. Regardless of the mixed picture of computer usage, the trend is unmistakable. The use of com- puters will grow inexorably both in scope and rigor. Tomorrow's top marketing executive will have been trained in college in computer applications, will have a miniature desktop computer-printer at his elbow with instant access to the data bases in his company, in his trade association, and in numerous public and private sources. Also on his desk will be a pictorial display console with input, output, design and computational capabilities. A visual mode de- vice completes the set of components of the com- munications and information systems. This is the picturephone, by which the executive can link his branches and subsidiaries in a multidimensional conference, in which each participant may calcu- late, design, propose, question, hear, and see every other participant's contributions to the group mar- keting decisions. The end of the intuitive marketer? Not at all. The forecast is simply for a better informed, better supported, better educated marketing man who will always encounter problems in which there are im- ponderables, risks to take, and intuition and ex- perience to call upon. MARKETING MEMO What Trends are Ahead for Business ... Let me try to forecast the trends based upon the best thinking of our intellectuals and business leaders. 1. Business is moving into new fields of social responsibility at a rate higher than is the tired federal bureaucracy. The marketplace, domestic and foreign, is confronting the cultural environment for the first time. 2. The trend toward multi-national and transnational corporate structure is both eroding the base of the nation-state and, as Michael Crozier has pointed out, business and government policymakers are being pushed into an uncomfortable alliance with relation to change and the status quo. Witness, for example, the unparalled and recent influence of the World Bank, the GATT structure, the Inter-American and Asian Development Banks, the International Telecommunications and Satellite Consortium, and the regional Common Market concept. 3. Business, foreign and domestic, is broadening its perspectives and moves in a long-term movement across frontiers which will see a lessening of historic antag- onisms between enterprise and the rest of society. Business will be the standard- bearer of a new drive toward more rationality. 4. Creativity will emerge as a basic value of international business, and with it will increase tolerance for individual idiosyncrasies. How else can one accommodate a board of directors with French, German, Latin and American membership? -Robert F.
