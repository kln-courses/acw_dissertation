In this companion volume to On Being a Christian, Hans Kiing under BOOKS takes to raise the question of God's ex istence in a dialogue between theology and modern philosophy, science and culture. He attempts to discover whether modern man can understand God today without Greek, medieval, or early modern assumptions and argues 455</page><page sequence="2">that there are grounds for the reason- cord with which the separation of God able affirmation of his existence.
