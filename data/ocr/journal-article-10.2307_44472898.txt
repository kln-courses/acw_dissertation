Spenny Air Force Institute of Technology Wright-Patterson AFB, OH ABSTRACT Performance criteria are presented for head response of an anthrqpomorphic test device that is to be used for predicting the level of secondary impact force during frontei flexion. The criteria consist of all significant velocity response observed in a group of volunteers, thereby assuring that a dummy head with the proper mass distribution characteristics will possess the proper momentum at all times during unobstructed response to the primary impact imparted to the torso. A dummy with momentum or impact load predicting fidelity is an improvement over one which merely predicts contact. INTROIXJCITON For a seat restrained dummy that is to be used for prediction of secondary impact force levels on the head, the head must possess the proper momentum at all times during unobstructed response to the primary impact imparted to the torso. Further, a dummy that is to be used for predicting internal loads of the neck during unobstructed response must possess humanlike acceleration levels. Each of these capabilities is more demanding than insistence only that displacement of the head be sufficiently humanlike, the latter assuring adequate prediction of contact but not of levels of contact or internal force. To formalize the distinction that can exist in degree of fidelity which the head and neck of a dummy may possess, it is helpful to define three levels of fidelity: 1. Position fidelity-head displacement relative to the torso is sufficiently humanlike so that the occurrence of secondary contact can be adequately predicted. 2. Momentum fidelity-momentum of the head is sufficiently humanlike so that head injury resulting from secondary head impact can be adequately predicted. 3. Load fidelity-peak internal neck loads are sufficiently humanlike so that neck injury during unobstructed head response can be adequately predicted. These three levels are stated in terms of desirable dummy performance characteristics. A pertinent question is: What criteria must be imposed to achieve each level? lhe most basic performance requirement is specification of peak head excursion for a specified peak impact level. When the time of occurrence of peak excursion is also stipulated, then the dummy can be expected to have seme degree of position fidelity at any time prior to peak excursion. Accuracy is improved if intermediate amplitudes and their times of occurrence are also matched to measured human head response. The degree of position fidelity is then dependent on the number of match points. It is also dependent on hew good the match is at each point. Mass distribution characteristics of the head and neck need not be included when specifying position fidelity. Hcwever, momentum and load fidelity do require humanlike mass distribution characteristics in the dummy. When such exists, velocity and acceleration become the response specifications for momentum and load fidelity, respectively. Position fidelity would also imply velocity and acceleration fidelity if precise position match occurred at each point on the continuum (i.e. the infinite number of points) of the response variable during the loading phase. Since this precise match is never achieved by the common practice of stipulating that position response be within prescribed performance cor- ridors, position fidelity does not provide direct specification for velocity or acceleration fidelity. A separate specification is required for each. The most direct means for achieving a higher level of fidelity is to specify velocity or acceleration, as desired, at a prescribed number of points over the loading phase. In this paper, velocity fidelity requirements for frontal flexion are proposed. 3.1360 0096-736X/88/9603-1 360$02.50 Copyright 1988 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">BACKGROUND ļp previous papers by Wismans and Spenny(l,2) , Wismans(3) and Spenny(4,5), the significant kinematic and load variables are identified which must be included in performance requirements for position and load fidelity. Requirements are formulated for frontal, lateral and oblique impact response based on tests conducted by the Naval Biodynamics Laboratory (NBDL) . In light of the three levels of fidelity defined in this paper, it should be noted that references (1-5) extend the performance requirement of Mertz(6) to became both the necessary and sufficient conditions for load fidelity. It is obvious that momentum fidelity is more demanding than is position fidelity and load fidelity is more demanding than either of the others. Thus, momentum fidelity would imply a certain level of position fidelity and load fidelity would imply certain levels of both momentum and position fidelity. Both the cost and usefulness of the dummy would increase with increasing fidelity. The significance of having a dummy with momentum fidelity is that 1) a dummy that adequately predicts head injury severity is much more useful in crash impact research than is one that merely predicts contact and 2) a dummy that can achieve load fidelity is probably beyond economic if not technical feasibility at this time. Further, load measurements are not required to establish momentum fidelity in a dummy. STUDY OBJECTIVE AND METHODOLOGY The objective of this study is to develop performance requirements for use in establishing whether velocity fidelity exists in a dummy. *Numbers in parentheses designate references at end of paper. 872199 Only what is judged to be significant response is included and consideration is given to ease of measurement in the dummy as a frequent use is verification of calibration of dummies used for compliance testing. The methodology of this study is similar to that followed in reference (4) . Using data from sled tests of volunteers, the significant rate response characteristics were identified, response variables were defined in terms of measured data that quantify the significant response, response corridors were established by superimposing the results of comparable tests of all subjects and peformance requirements were developed from statistical analysis of the corridor response. DATABASE DESCRIPTION Data for developing the performance requirements came from sled tests of volunteers conducted by the Naval Biodynamics Laboratory. Linear and angular displacements of both the head and T1 vertebral body, derived fremi film analysis, were used to describe head motion relative to the torso. Accelerometer clusters mounted on the head and upper torso provided the acceleration and velocity data required. A detailed description of the test methodology is provided in reference (7) . Eight tests of 6 volunteers at a nominal peak sled acceleration level of 15g's and with an acceleration profile designated by the NBDL as lew rate-of onset, long duration were used for this study. Table 1 summarizes the test characteristics for the eight runs. This particular set was chosen because they represent the highest level of frontei impact to which the volunteers were exposed. Tests are also available for analysis at lower levels of frontal impact, for other acceleration profiles and for other directions of impact. All test conditions were conducted on a comparable number of subjects. Because the number of tests at any one level is small, the reader is cautioned regarding TABLE 1 - SUMMARY OF SLED ACCELERATION PROFILES FOR THE TESTS ANALYZED SUBJECT TEST NO.

To that end it is also important to document the anthropometric characteristics of the subjects for which the velocity response has been developed. lhe only anthropomorphic information required for analysis of velocity response was the position of the occipital condylar point relative to the head anatomical origin. Estimated values were used based on the results of Ewing. and lhcmas(7). Table 2 lists the anatomical components.

Table 3 contains the anthropometric measurements made by the NBDL( columns 1 to 6), estimated mass distribution characteristics of the head as prepared by Wismans(3) (columns 7 to 10) and initial neck length from the T1 vertebral point to the occipital condylar point (column 11) . The estimated moments of inertia are principal moments and are located by a rotation of 36 degrees about the y-axis of the head anatomical frame (reference (8)) so that the positive x-axis of the principal set points outward through the forehead (See appendix and figure Al) . Estimated location of the head center of gravity (principal axes origin) relative to the head anatomical origin is presented in table 2 and is based on the results of Beier(9) . Neck length was computed from the initial sensor data. It includes correction to the database for error in the position of the T1 vertebral point as described in reference (4) . Statistical averages for all subjects are included in the table. The information in Table 3 and the head center of gravity in table 2 are relevant in sizing a dummy to produce momentum fidelity. DEFINITIONS Table 4 identifies the noteworthy response characteristics of the volunteers for frontal response that were used for developing position fidelity requirements (4) . The variables used to quantify these characteristics are defined in figure 1. For frontal impact, three variables, neck length and two angles, characterize the significant response. Expressions for these variables in terms of measured volunteer test data are derived in reference (4) . To illustrate the significance of momentum fidelity requirements, rate of change of the angle variables of figure 1 is used. The neck length variable is not included because its rate of change is small compared to rate of change of the angle variables.

Some deviation is noted between the two after peak excursion, apparently the result of accelercmeter bias. The absence of the small dimple in the nonintegrated curve of figure 3 just prior to peak excursion is illustrative of one kind of loss in velocity fidelity that can result when applying position fidelity criteria. This higher frequency response was apparently not observed in digitization of the photographic data. In making a fidelity check of a dummy, similar discrepancies could be expected, the result of digitizing at a finite number of points. Failure to include the angular rate that produces the dimple would imply infidelity in angular rate estimated to be 15 radians per second. The corresponding infidelity of velocity of the head anatomical origin relative to the torso would be of the order of 1 nýte if a distance from T1 to the forehead is assumed to be .075m. The peak velocity of the head anatomical origin relative to the sled is approximately 4.0 nyte as indicated in figure 4. Since impact force level is dependent on the relative velocity between the impacting bodies, infidelity of forehead velocity would be 25% of peak velocity if this event occurred at peak velocity. Since it occurred near peak excursion when velocity was near zero, the percent error approaches infinity. Large error in head angular rate is also possible when the head angle is only constrained to fall within a corridor. Analagous to figure 2, the neck angular rate 0y is plotted versus neck angle in figure 5.

Considerations that influence the performance requirement development are 1) the test procedure must be easy to perform and repeat 2) instrumentation should consist of simple, reliable off-the-shelf components 3) the amount of data reduction should be minimal and, perhaps most importantly, 4) the variables monitored should be robust measures of all of the significant head response- relative to the torso observed in human response. It is also desirable to have the same instrumentation be used for conducting tests for impact in any direction and for tests of both whole-body and detached head/neck systems. It is not possible to include all of these considerations without some compromise. The amount of data processing required to verify fidelity could be minimized by simply duplicating the output of the NBDL sensors, considering the dummy neck sensors to be input and its head sensors to be output. There are two disadvantages to this approach. First, the output is inertial so the sled response is included thereby reducing the sensitivity of measured head response relative to the sled and torso. Secondly, interpretation of out-of-spec response would, in most cases, require that the data processing be performed anyway. The procedure espoused here assumes that the dummy contains accelerometer clusters on the head and upper torso whose output can be translated into the head and T1 anatomical components of velocity defined in this paper. Use of the angular rate variables identified in the previous section assures all significant response is monitored. However, a concern is the accuracy with which the angular rates of the volunteers is known.

They are plotted versus velocity of the torso (T1 anatomical origin) in the direction of sled motion, which will be considered as the input for the performance requirement test. (This torso velocity can also be considered fixed in direction in the torso since the volunteers were restrained so that little torso motion occurs (4) ) . If these plotswere used as the bounds on performance for a dummy, the dimple discussed above would only be partially incorporated because the width of the corridor is not sufficiently narrow. A more rigorous corridor is that created by using as bounds one standard deviation above and below the mean of the 8 tests. Figure 10 is the statistical based corridor of response for the head. A similar corridor could be created for the neck. However, it is possible to identify a proxy variable to neck angular rate that has less variation between volunteers. The laboratory x- ccmponent of the linear velocity of the head anatomical origin with respect to the torso was selected as the second variable in lieu of e^. This variable is the principle contributor to neck angular velocity and is given by the first term on the right-hand side of eq. (A-ll) . The second term of eq. (A-ll) is of second-order throughout the loading phase because there is little rotation of the T1 vertebral frame and the third term is equal to zero under the assumption that the head is a rigid body. The last term of eq. (A-ll) is always smaller than the first but its contribution is not second order. However, it is a contribution resulting from head rotation. Since variable specifies head rotational rate, there is no loss in control of neck fidelity when specification of linear velocity of the head is used in lieu of as the second performance requirement variable. As noted above, the primary reason for making this change of variable was to produce a tighter performance corridor. There is also less data processing required to obtain this variable. Figure 11 shows the bounds on head linear velocity in the laboratory x-direction relative to the torso as formed by the extremes of the volunteer tests. Figure 12 shows the corresponding statistical bounds. The input for conducting a test of velocity of a dummy is the velocity of the T1 anatomical origin in the direction of sled motion relative to the laboratory. Figure 13 is the statistical generated corridor that defines the allowable range of input at Tl. Figures 10 and 12 in conjunction with figure 13 constitute the performance requirement for velocity fidelity in response to frontal impact. SUMMARY A distinction has been made in the degree of response fidelity that a dummy may possess and response criteria were presented for the level of fidelity defined as momentum fidelity. The results are related to previous work in which criteria for other levels of fidelity were developed. Momentum fidelity assures a dummy that will adequately predict the severity of head injury resulting from secondary contact. Results are presented only for frontal impact. The database also contains volunteer tests for lateral and oblique impact. An effort is underway to formulate velocity criteria for these cases. ACKNCWIEDGMENT The computing facility and NBDL database maintained at the U.S. Department of Transportation, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was used to conduct this study.

Three of these have been previously defined by NBDL(7) and the last previously by Spenny(4) . They are repeated here for completeness: 1. The laboratory reference coordinate system (L) is fixed at thę point occupied by the sled chair target center prior to the onset of acceleration. The +z-axis is opposite in direction to gravity and the +x-axis is opposite in direction to the sled acceleration stroke. 2. The head anatomical coordinate system (H) (See figure Al) is derived from an anatomical plane which is specified by the superior edge of each auditory meatus and by the infraorbital notches. The origin is at the midpoint of a line connecting the superior edges of the right and left auditory meati. The +x- axis is from the origin through the midpoint of a line connecting the infraorbital notches in the anatomical plane. The +z-axis is from the origin in the superior direction perpendicular to the anatomical plane. 3 . The spine anatomical coordinate system (T) (See figure Al) has its origin at the anterior superior corner of the first thoracic vertebral body (the T1 vertebral point) . The +x-axis is defined by a line connecting the midpoint of the superior corner of the posterior spinous process of T1 to the anterior superior corner of Tl. The +z-axis is perpendicular to the x-axis in the plane of the above three points and in the superior direction. 4. The 'initialized1 spine anatomical coordinate system (T ) is fixed in the torso with its origin at the Tl vertebral point and its axes such that they are coincident with those of the L- frame at the start of each test. Angular position of the H-frame with respect to the L-frame is defined by three sequential (Euler) angles: 1. Rotation 0-, about the x-axis of the L- frame. ** 2. Rotation 0,- about the carried y-axis. 3. Rotation efji about the carried z-axis. nZ The matrix tranformation of L-frame components into H-frame components is: co.«Ht «.«Hy I • ""'n, I ♦ co..Ht .ln»Hy I - co.eHl 'S, * "•'"»H, Coi%y "'V CO,,H.
