But though the history of Blanchot's political involvements is now quite well documented (albeit frequently misrepresented to polemical ends), much remains to be understood about Blanchot's concep- tion of the political. Prompted in part by his support for the 'Not In Our Name' appeal, which was to be one of Blanchot's last political gestures, this essay fragment, which is part of a longer inquiry, reconstructs the writer's thinking on the question of the subject of politics and the closely related issue of the relationship between law and violence. It examines Blanchot's response to Hölderlin's translation of a famous fragment from Pindar entitled 'Das Höchste' ('The Most High') and places Blanchot's writing within the wider context of the political thought of Benjamin, Schmitt, Agamben, and Derrida. Keywords: Blanchot, Hölderlin, Benjamin, sovereignty, law, violence, the neuter, refusal I Politics, Blanchot wrote in 1984, had always been his passion, and public events a constant source of provocation. But political thought or the thinking of politics, he added, was something that perhaps remained still to be discovered. Politics, in other words, corresponded to no stable, universal category. It evoked a concern inseparable from the struggles of the present, but it also implied a demand that, exceeding the present, reached into the future - a future that, according to Nietzsche, as Blanchot's friend Georges Bataille liked to remember, was essentially unpredictable and uncertain. Either way, responsibility was not something it was possible to avoid. So it was, for instance, in November 2002, only months before his death and perhaps for the very last time, that Blanchot lent his name and signature to the international campaign launched in New York earlier that year under the heading: 'Not in Our Name', which voiced in those terms its opposition to the 'war on terror' declared by the Bush Paragraph 30:3 (2007) 141-159</page><page sequence="2">142 Paragraph administration and its European allies, culminating shortly after in the British- American invasion of Iraq.1 In the first instance, the purpose of the watchword was to appeal to an alternative, more original, more authentic, sovereign political subject, and this no doubt explains its implicit evocation of the Amer- ican constitution, which famously begins, as many have observed, with the inescapably aporetic words: 'We the People of the United States. . .'.2 But this was not all. Something else spoke in the campaign, more in tune with the challenges posed by the new world order it sought to confront. For alongside the call for a more fully present political subject, there lingered a residual doubt as to the possibility of any properly identifiable, communal first-person plural at all. In this respect, what the declaration 'Not in Our Name' suggested was not simply that 'we' were deprived of political representation. Implicit within it, intentionally or not, was the more radical suspicion or hope, in this beginning twenty-first century, that 'we' - whoever the word may be thought to designate - might henceforth no longer be arraigned as an 'us' and identified as such on the basis of species, race, nationality, class, gender, or any other mark of communal affiliation. And if 'we' were nevertheless intent on making 'our' voices heard, it was perhaps only as a tardy memory or citation from former times: as a "'we'" without 'we', inassimilable to any communal 'us'. What signed itself 'not in our name', in the words of the New York pledge, could not, then, by that very token, speak in 'our' name. It could only intervene by bearing witness to an essential exclusion, which was nothing less than a radical absence of name. The question it raised, in other words, was the abiding political question of the whole twentieth century and of the early twenty-first century too - not: what do we want, when do we want it, how shall we get it?, but: who are we, and what, if anything, are 'we' called? The key question, in other words, was not that of the subject of politics, as addressed or interpellated by the authority of the State, positioned as a self-present national entity, and invoked as a largely fictitious source of political legitimacy - but, innumerably, that of another or the other. 'Qui vient après le sujet?', 'Who comes after the subject?', Blanchot and others were asked by Jean-Luc Nancy in 1988. Blanchoťs response, by his own admission, was necessarily insufficient. It was nonetheless far-reaching. For in it he evoked the impersonality of the neutre or neuter, that category without category that exceeded the positing of any present subject and marked the coming of the non-self-identical future only in so far as, by way of the</page><page sequence="3">'Not In Our Name': Blanchot, Politics, the Neuter 143 neutre , 'appeal was thereby made to the coming [ avènement : the coming of a messiah or new epoch] of what does not arrive [ce qui n'arrive pas : does not occur], of what might be said to come without ever arriving [viendrait sans arrivée ], beyond being [hors être] and having so to speak slipped its anchor [comme par dérive ]'.3 And in an extraordinary mise-en-abyme, Blanchot concluded, he said, by borrowing from the philosopher Claude Morali the title of one of that author's books, Qui est moi aujourd'hui? ( Who is Me Today?), and the quotation from which that title was derived - which some fifteen years earlier had first appeared, in Blanchot's hand, in the pages of Le Pas au-delà (though the point, precisely, was that there was never any first time nor place of origin where writing or words were concerned), and in which an anonymous narrator had wondered, in a digressive hypothesis released from the authority of any main clause, as follows: 'As though the muffled and yet joyful sound of children playing in the garden echoed forth as they called to one another: "Who is me today?", "Who's going to be me? [Qui tient lieu de moi : who is standing in for me, i.e. who is playing at being the first person singular?]". And the reply, joyful, endless: him , him , him [lui, lui , lui ].'4 II This was not the first time that Blanchot had turned his attention to the question of sovereignty and of the subject of politics. Throughout the 1930s, in his career as a political journalist and dissident revolutionary nationalist, he had arguably done little else. Much of course in recent years has been written about Blanchot's politics during the period between 1931 and 1944, but while the main episodes in Blanchot's prewar career are now well documented, relatively little attention has been paid so far to the conceptual implications of Blanchot's political thinking in general, with commentators contenting themselves all too often with hasty misrepresentation, inept generalization, and misplaced polemic, as the work of Jeffrey Mehlman, Steven Ungar, Philippe Mesnard, or, more recently, Richard Wolin, sadly confirms.5 Soon after the Liberation, as readers will know, Blanchot quickly began to concentrate his energies on his own fiction and literary criticism. This has often had the effect of distorting understanding of Blanchot's relationship to the political. The image of the writer that has dominated as a result is that of an artist retreating from politics during the immediate postwar period in order to devote himself solely to literature and preferring to veil the memory of his prewar</page><page sequence="4">144 Paragraph extremism in what some critics, with more fidelity to stereotype than to historical fact, have denounced as a guilty silence. This version of events is, however, misleading at best. It assumes that politics and literature can be securely and reliably delimited, and that, in any case, the relationship between the political and the literary is one of uncomplicated opposition, as though what was merely literary could not by essence also be political, and vice versa. Plainly, nothing could be further from the truth. Indeed, as I have suggested elsewhere, there is every reason for considering Le Très-Haut , for instance, Blanchoťs third and final novel, written shortly after the Liberation, and delivered to the publisher in May 1947, far from being a symptom of aesthetic disengagement, as an urgent political novel about politics.6 What Le Très-Haut makes clear is that the absent centre upon which Blanchoťs postwar writing turns is not the writer's own past history nor any belief in aesthetic transcendence. It is the crucial problematic that for Blanchot and many of his contemporaries was inseparable from politics as such: the question of the law, its status and demands. For it was in the name of the law that throughout the 1930s Blanchot the political commentator attacked the ineffectual contractual politics of the League of Nations, on which French foreign policy - this 'politique de juristes' he called it in February 1935 - was largely based, together with the unstable parliamentary democracy given over to endless compromises and factional intrigues that was in its image, and both of which, in the face of Fascism, were to be found cruelly wanting. For in the meantime, France's national interest and the interests of a stable peace went undefended, and when it was thought crucial by some, like the journalist Maurice Blanchot, to intervene by force of arms in March 1936 to prevent Hitler's remilitarization of the Rhineland, all Albert Sarraut's Radical French government and Stanley Baldwin's Conservative British government thought it appropriate to do was to demur politely and concede. The fact was, Blanchot maintained, if it was not to be treated everywhere with contempt, the law had to be defended: if necessary by force. Here was the nub of a critical dilemma. For how to tell the difference between the force that maintains and protects the law and the force that usurps and overturns its authority? How to separate illegitimate violence from legitimate force, and how to distinguish measure from excess? Was it always the case that the legitimacy of the end justified the means, or could only the legality of the means guarantee the justice of the ends? And if it was a matter of challenging</page><page sequence="5">'Not In Our Name': Blanchot, Politics, the Neuter 145 prevailing legal conventions in order to appeal to more pressing principles not enshrined in statute, in whose name was it legitimate to do so? Who or what, in other words, was the proper subject of politics? Who or what was the source of political sovereignty? In the 1930s, one after the other, Blanchoťs contemporaries made their choices, putting their faith now in the consensuality and compromises of parliamentary democracy, now in the revolutionary mission of the European proletariat under the leadership of the Third International, now in the mystified nationalism and racial purity of the Volk, gathered under the tutelage of a charismatic leader, and so on. But throughout that whole turbulent period, it is striking that none of these so-called political solutions ever held any attraction whatsoever for Blanchot, who rejected all three outright, and turned instead to the only subject remaining, still separated from itself, still absent, still mired in abject humiliation, but which Blanchot fervently hoped might be restored to its past grandeur, reawakened to proper immediacy, and returned to its commanding sovereign presence, not unlike an irrepressible and sublime work of art: the nation of France itself. During the 1920s and 1930s, Blanchot was not the only commen- tator to be exercised by the question of the relationship between law and violence. Writing in 1921 in the essay 'Zur Kritik der Gewalt' (Critique of Violence), read at the time with some interest, it seems, by the influential legal theorist (and later apologist of the Third Reich) Carl Schmitt, Walter Benjamin had responded to similar problems by distinguishing between two types of violence, one that laid down the law, and one that upheld it.7 'All violence [ Gewalt : meaning violence and power]', he wrote, 'as a means is either law-making [ rechtsetzend , i.e., it poses or constitutes the law] or law-preserving [ rechtserhaltend , i.e., it maintains the law]'.8 If violence or power in the second of Benjamin's two senses referred to the role of authority in preserving at least a certain form of (repressive or protective) legal order, in the first sense it was premissed on the aporetics of constitution, that paradox, embodied among others in the American constitution, by which law can only be founded by that which is illegal, as Blan- chot was surely aware when he spoke for instance in 1933 of the need for spiritual - national - revolution to overturn the State, and predicted, logically enough, that any such upheaval would be exces- sive, violent, illegal: 'pitiless, bloody, and unjust, our last chance of salvation [dure, sanglante , injuste , notre dernière chance de salut]' . 9 There remained however the problem, as Benjamin was quick to point out, that the boundary between constitution and enforcement, between</page><page sequence="6">146 Paragraph the posing and the imposing of law was anything but clear, either in law or in fact. Whenever the police were involved, he remarked, referring likewise to the early Weimar Republic as well as the French nineteenth century, it was always possible for the one to tip uneasily and eerily into the other 'in a kind of spooky amalgam [einer gleichsam gespenstischen Vermischung]' What this implied was that no law was ever wholly in accord with itself. No law could not not correspond, in part, to an act of illegitimate foundation, and every statute, however legal, retained the memory of the time when, still belonging to the future, it was paradoxically outside all law. Here lay both a chance and a danger. The violence inherent in all law meant, on the one hand, that it was always legitimate - in the name of the law itself - to challenge the law; but, on the other, there was no guarantee that to do so would not simply culminate in further violence. There was always the risk, then, that the force of law might be overwhelmed by the law of force, and legitimate violence become no different from its illegitimate double. In the end, however, Benjamin argued, questions of legality and legitimacy could not be divorced from the demands of something far more pressing and immediate than the inconclusive circle of legitimate ends and justifiable means allowed: justice itself. Accordingly, he went on in his 1921 essay to distinguish further between two radically opposed aspects of law-making ( Rechtsetzung ). Here too there was a division, an alternative, a choice, between what Benjamin boldly described on the one hand as mythic violence (or power), whose object was to enact, found, and constitute law, and, on the other, what he termed divine violence (or power), whose goal was the singularity of justice in so far as it was irreducible to any given human statute. 'If mythic violence is law-making [rechtsetzend]' he argued, 'divine violence is law-destroying [ rechtsvernichtend ]; if the former sets boundaries, the latter boundlessly destroys them; if mythic violence brings at once guilt and retribution, divine violence only expiates; if the former threatens, the latter strikes; if the former is bloody, the latter is lethal without spilling blood.'11 'Mythic violence [Die mythische Gewalt]', Benjamin added, 'is bloody power [Blutgewalt] over mere life [das bloße Leben] for its own sake; divine violence is pure power [reine Gewalt] over all life for the sake of the living [um des Lebendigen willen , i.e. that which lives]. The first demands sacrifice; the second accepts it.'12 These are no doubt exalted as well as chilling words, and Derrida was surely right to find their ambiguity both troubling and revealing: troubling for what they make thinkable, but</page><page sequence="7">'Not In Our Name': Blanchot, Politics , the Neuter 147 revealing, too, of the challenges and temptations of political thinking in 1920s and 1930s Europe. Benjamin, however, was not alone. Blanchot too, as some of his more vehement editorials from 1936 and 1937 testify, was often given to excessive, over-heated prognostications, laden with menace and promise alike - probably no more so than when, barely a month after the precarious formation of Léon Blum's first Popular Front coalition government in June 1936, in a gesture born of the very political impasse it aimed to overcome, he dryly appealed over the heads of his faint-hearted readership to unnamed others who might be ready to embark on acts of terrorism: as a method of public safety. 'We are not among those who judge it preferable to do without a revolution or who speak hypocritically of a peaceful, spiritual revolution', Blanchot fulminated. And he went on: Such hopefulness is absurd and cowardly. It is necessary for there to be a revolution, because it is impossible to modify a regime that has everything in its grip and its roots everywhere, it must be killed and utterly destroyed [on le supprime , on l'abat]. It is necessary for this revolution to be violent because it is not possible to find the force and passion required for renewal in a people as weakened [aveuli: lacking willpower] as our own by employing respectable measures [mesures décentes ], but only by administering bloody shocks [secousses sanglantes] and unleashing a violent storm that will bring it to its senses [qui le bouleversera afin de V éveiller]. 14 Blanchoťs philippic was no doubt rhetorical before it was practical, but it conveys accurately enough the uncompromising ferocity with which, in 1936, the writer challenged the legitimacy of the newly elected government. This was not the first time Blanchot had done so in his career as a political commentator. Nor was it to be the last. Indeed, though much else would change, it is fair to say that politics in general for Blanchot were to remain largely synonymous with precisely those sporadic yet recurrent moments of crisis, inter- ruption, or upheaval that featured regularly in French political life in subsequent years: the Munich accords of September 1938, the armistice between Pétain and Hitler signed at Compiègne on 22 June 1940 and the illegal self-dissolution of the Third Republic eighteen days later (which Blanchot is reported to have witnessed personally), the Liberation of Paris in 1944, de Gaulle's alleged coup d'etat of 13 May 1958, and so on. For also belonging to this strangely persistent historical sequence were the events of December 1965 - a legitimate transition for some, for others an unjustifiable coup de force - when</page><page sequence="8">148 Paragraph France prepared for the first time to elect its head of state by direct universal suffrage, under a modification to the constitution put to referendum by de Gaulle three years before, with the express purpose of weakening the legitimacy of the National Assembly in favour of the personal authority of the President. Blanchot's response, as the election campaign began, was in the form of an essay on Sade's famous pamphlet of 1795, similarly written at a time of constitutional transition that, soon after, would allow a previous first consul to iden- tify himself, with quasi-religious hubris, with the fate of the nation: 'Français, encore un effort si vous voulez être républicains. . .' ('Citi- zens of France, Try Harder If You Wish To Be Republicans. . .').15 And as he made the parallel between Bonaparte and de Gaulle explicit, Blanchot commented: What Sade calls a revolutionary regime is that pure moment in time when history, having been suspended, marks an epoch, the time of between-times [ce temps de Ventre-temps] when between the old laws and the new reigns the silence of the absence of laws, that interval which precisely corresponds to the gap in speaking [Ventre-dire, i.e. both speaking-between and inter-diction] when everything ceases and stops, including the eternal drive to speak, because, then, there is no longer any prohibition [interdit].16 In 1936, in order to contest the legitimacy of the state, Blanchot's rhetoric had urged a series of exemplary, cathartic acts of political violence. In 1965, the writer turned instead to something more resembling a work of literature, albeit in the unusual form of a detachable supplement contained within a larger, fictional work whose confines it nevertheless exceeded, and authored by a writer who, for some, was the embodiment of violence itself, yet who, for that very reason, had begun to figure as early as 1947, for Blanchot, as the writer par excellence. This was not simply a matter of replacing a political discourse with a literary one, assuming it can be said with confidence where the one ends and the other begins. It was to testify to a radically different relationship to the law. For what revealed itself now in the explicit or implicit interregnum that was a precondition of all politics as such for Blanchot was not, as entrusted in 1936 to a determined few, the effervescent, ebullient, and immediate sovereign presence of the people.18 No, what spoke now, in December 1965, as Blanchot remembered Sade, was something other; it was the loquacious, neutral silence of the absence of all laws, 'social, moral, natural':19 law without laws, so to speak, law before laws, law in excess of all laws, law as a neutral suspension of all laws.</page><page sequence="9">'Not In Our Name': Blanchot, Politics, the Neuter 149 But of what, and to whom, and in whose name, did this interruption of law now speak? 'For a period', wrote Blanchot in 1949 in the voice of one of his narrators, arguably summing up the distance his own thinking had travelled during the previous decade and a half, I lived a public life [ j'ai été un homme public]. I found the law appealing, and loved the multitude. I was obscure in others. As a nonentity, I was sovereign. But one day I grew tired of being the stone that castigates men alone [lapide les hommes seuls]. To tempt the law, I called out gently to her [la loi is in the feminine], 'Come closer, let me see you face to face.' (I wanted, for a moment, to take her aside.) These were incautious words. What would I have done had she replied?20 But if the law declined to answer, this did not mean Blanchot was tempted or even allowed to do the same. On the contrary, once Blan- chot began to exchange daily journalism for another kind of writing, undertaken by necessity at night, a very different exposure to the law's demands began to affirm itself. This, I suggest, is what principally is at stake in Le Très-Haut , and why the novel asks to be read as a sustained settling of accounts or explanation with politics or the polit- ical. Already the title of the novel provides an important, if enigmatic clue. For alongside its standard theological meaning, with which Blan- chot was familiar, it was also the title, in the neuter ('Das Höchste', 'The Highest'), given by Hölderlin around 1805 to his translation of a famous fragment from Pindar (Fr. 169), attested in Herodotus and Plato, which Hölderlin, most likely taking his text from Górgias 484b (where, for polemical purposes of his own, Plato cites an amended version of Pindar's text), renders as follows: 'Das Gesez [nomos], /Von allen der König [basileus], Sterblichen und/Unsterblichen; das fuhrt eben/Darum gewaltig/Das gerechteste Recht mit allerhöchster Hand' (The Law, /Of everyone the King, mortals and/Immortals; which is just why/It mightily guides/The rightest right with the very highest hand).2 Also accompanying Hölderlin's translation was a commentary by the poet, which Blanchot is certain also to have known since it is cited by Heidegger in the course of a famous essay on Hölderlin's unfinished Pindaric hymn, 'Wie wenn am Feiertage. . .' ('As on a holiday. . .'), which, shortly before sending his novel to the publisher, Blanchot reviewed for Critique in December 1946. 22 More partic- ularly, Heidegger in the essay had quoted the two famous opening paragraphs of Hölderlin's commentary, which are as follows:</page><page sequence="10">150 Paragraph The immediate [Das Unmittelbare ], strictly speaking, is impossible for mortals, as it is for the immortals; a God must distinguish different worlds, according to his nature, since heavenly goodness, because of itself, must be sacred, unalloyed. Man, as a knowing creature, must also distinguish different worlds, because knowledge is only possible through opposition. For this reason, the immediate [das Unmittelbare] is, strictly speaking, impossible for mortals, as for immortals. Strict mediacy [Die strenge Mittelbarkeit], however, is the law [das Gesez].23 Interpreting these lines, Heidegger explains that only immediacy, which is not itself communicable, can give rise to that which is communicated (or mediated), in much the same way that, for Benjamin and others, that which grounds the law cannot itself be subject to it. And this is the reading Blanchot also proposes, at least up to a certain point, by drawing on Heidegger's gloss. 'What is the Sacred?', Blanchot asks, and answers: 'It is the immediate, says Heidegger, taking his lead from a prose fragment by Hölderlin, the immediate that is never communicated, but is the principle of all possibility of communicating.'24 The ramifications of Pindar's fragment are extensive, and reach far beyond Hölderlin's translation and the subsequent interest shown in it by Heidegger and Blanchot. In his book Homo sacer , for instance, Giorgio Agamben identifies in Pindar's enigmatic pronouncement an essential topos in Greek and later philosophical thinking regarding the fundamental relationship between law and violence: 'Pindar's fragment on the nomos basileus ', he writes, 'contains the hidden paradigm guiding every successive definition of sovereignty: the sovereign is the point of indistinction between violence and law, the threshold on which violence passes over into law and law passes over into violence'.25 In the ensuing discussion, Agamben points, too, to the presence of Fr. 169 in Carl Schmitt's Der Nomos der Erde of 1950, where Hölderlin is taken to task for mistranslating Pindar, at least according to Schmitt, in so far as Hölderlin, in rendering nomos as Gesetz , that is, in Schmittian terminology, as a derivative convention posed or posited as such [i.e. gesetzt] and reliant for its legitimacy on prior, constituent sovereign power, misses the proper sense of the term as an unmediated originating principle. 'Nomos in the original sense', Schmitt contends, 'is precisely the full immediacy [Unmittelbarkeit] ofjuridical power not mediated by laws [Gesetze]; it is a constitutive, historical event [ein konstituierendes geschichtliches Ereignis ], an act of legitimacy which alone gives the legality of mere law [des bloßen Gesetzes] its meaning.'26 Schmitt's purpose, then, not unlike Benjamin's in 1921, was to isolate and radically privilege the violent primacy of nomos as an originary,</page><page sequence="11">'Not In Our Name' : Blanchot , Politics, the Neuter 151 immediate and unmediated foundational decision, irreducible to any legal statute in so far as the latter was always authorized, mediated by the former. This at any rate is the forced, some might say violent, construction Schmitt puts on Hölderlin's remark, cited above, to the effect that '[sjtrict mediacy, however, is the law [Gesez]'27 One of the significant causes for the divergence between Hölderlin and Schmitt, as Agamben rightly observes, is that, in addressing the status of nomos basileus, Hölderlin, unlike Schmitt, was not concerned with legal theory, but with epistemology, not with sovereignty as such, but with the conditions of possibility of knowledge, and thus, paradoxically, not only with what was highest, but also what was lowest. This becomes explicit at the end of Hölderlin's commentary when the poet remarks that ' "King" here means the superlative, which is only the sign for the highest ground of knowing [den höchsten Erkenntnißgrund ], not for the highest power [nicht für die höchste Macht]'. But like Schmitt, Agamben at this point probes no further, and abandons Hölderlin's alternative reading of Pindar's fragment in order to develop a politological account of the state of exception or state of emergency, that strange, seemingly self-contradictory moment when constitutions are required to suspend themselves (as does de Gaulle's 1958 constitution, for instance, under its notorious Article 16, invoked from April to September 1961, which de Gaulle threatened to use again in May 1968), and which, in a Schmittian perspective at least, Agamben argues, 'is not so much a spatio-temporal suspension as a complex topological figure in which not only the exception and the rule but also the state of nature and law, outside and inside, pass through one another', and as a result of which, adds Agamben, what happened [in the wake of the First World War] and is still happening before our eyes is that the juridically empty' space of the state of exception (in which law is in force in the figure - that is, etymologically, in the fiction - of its own dissolution, and in which everything that the sovereign deemed de facto necessary could happen) has transgressed its spatio-temporal boundaries and now, overflowing outside them, is starting to coincide with the normal order, in which everything again becomes possible.28 But what if what was precisely at stake in Hölderlin's translation from Pindar, rather than pointing, under the auspices of sovereignty, to a threshold of indistinction between violence and law, was more like an interruption of possibility, a deferral or difference that, like a caesura, voiced in the neuter, and irreducible to any opposition between immanence and transcendence, divided the origin from</page><page sequence="12">152 Paragraph itself, put immediacy at a distance, ruined all prospect of foundation, and revoked the supremacy of sovereign power as such? And what if what was at issue for Blanchot in his encounter with Hölderlin was an experience of the law far removed from the nihilistic principle of absolute, unmediated sovereignty? Blanchot approaches 'Das Höchste' very differently to Heidegger, Schmitt or Agamben. First, in the whole of his work he quotes from it explicitly perhaps three times at most, admittedly in three strategically important contexts: the first in 1946, in the course of his discussion of Heidegger, where the barest of allusions to 'absolute mediacy [médiatité absolue ]' allows him to complicate Heidegger's claim that 'chaos' for Hölderlin is 'the sacred' or 'holy' as such, the very essence of nature 'physis] and Being in general; the second in 1955, in an essay on Hölderlin originally entitled 'Le Tournant [The Turning]', and incorporated later the same year in L'Espace littéraire, which gave the writer the opportunity of amplifying his remarks on 'Das Höchste'; and the third in 1969, in L'Entretien infini, in a page added to an essay on the poetry of Yves Bonnefoy first published ten years earlier.2 Though on each occasion the reference to 'Das Höchste' arrives like a marginal afterthought, this is arguably in inverse proportion to its significance, for it would not be hard to show its implications exert a binding influence on Blanchot's reading not only of Hölderlin but of modern poetry in general, and that its lesson may be found echoing like a distant murmur through Blanchot's own fiction too, including the pages of the shadowy twin or double of Pindar's fragment: Le Très-Haut itself.30 But in what way? Everything turns on the singular character of the supreme law to which Fr. 169 alludes. What law Pindar himself had in mind when those lines were first composed is impossible to say. But from Blanchot's and even Hölderlin's perspective this is unimportant. More revealing are the names of those to whom the law applies, those mortals and immortals evoked in the second line of Pindar's fragment. This suggests that the law in question is none other than the law of dying itself, in that its necessity is laid on the ones as inescapable possibility and on the others as inescapable impossibility, for if humans are forever promised the unrelieved prospect of dying, so the gods for their part are perpetually threatened with the relentless inability to die. This apparent opposition, however, is more tortuous than it might appear. For as Fios Arietos observes, Hölderlin, unlike Pindar, introduces a line break or caesura between the mention of the ones and that of the others,31 as though to mark the fact that, yes, the</page><page sequence="13">'Not In Our Name': Blanchot, Politics , the Neuter 153 possibility of dying is what separates men from gods, but that also, at the same time, this separation is what joins them together, since in neither case is dying truly possible: for if the gods are condemned never properly to die, so too are humans, who, as Hölderlin implies, and Blanchot never tires of insisting, are equally unable to make death their own and bring it within the orbit of power, potency, or possibility. Dying, in a word, is not something one can do as an object of will, mastery or power, since death, as it occurs, destroys precisely these faculties. 'Mortal, immortal', Blanchot would ask in 1980: 'does this reversal have any meaning?'32 Nomos was all-powerful, then, according to Hölderlin's commen- tary, not because its authority was grounded in the omnipotence of the gods, but because it was a condition of both possibility and impossibility which, as such, deprived both gods and humans of sovereignty over it. Rather than empowering mortals or immortals, it set a limit on their condition; and even as it constituted that which was most singular to them, the relationship to dying, by that token it also remained unapproachable and ungraspable as such: an empty, but nonetheless compelling enigma or secret. As the law promulgated itself, then, it also withdrew, simultaneously inscribing and effacing itself, the one as the other, and the other as the one, in a paradoxical intertwining of the two, not unlike the relationship between blindness and vision explored by Blanchot (as Derrida has shown) in La Folie du jour , the implication of which was that the law, far from embodying the immediacy or plenitude of the origin, was but a singular case of the neuter: infinite detour, irreducible otherness, unspoken futurity. It could not therefore be made present in the guise of some constitutive sublunar sovereign authority, and therefore conferred no power upon those whom it addressed, gods or humans alike. As Hölderlin rightly contends, in so far as it was immediate, it was impossible, available only at a distance from itself, in indirect, oblique, or mediated fashion. It could not be named or appropriated in or for itself. It was not itself therefore properly founded nor could it found anything in its turn. Its only authority in the end was that of interruption, deferral, alterity. From Hölderlin's perspective, and as Blanchot discovered in his turn, the law to which writing was exposed, which it obeyed just as much in the breach as it did in the observance, was no figure of sovereign power or violence. It was experienced instead as a compelling, nameless demand synonymous with an abyssal suspension of possibility. So although the law reigned supreme, what it proposed or imposed was not power as such, nor anything that corresponded to a</page><page sequence="14">154 Paragraph threshold of indistinction between law and violence, to use Agamben's formulation, but an affirmative powerlessness or non-power (not to be confused with impotence) which, as Blanchot's friend Robert Antelme testified in L'Espèce humaine , was also a radical resistance to power.33 It was this, perhaps, that Blanchot was able to read in Hölderlin's commentary, which echoes much of what Blanchot wrote about death and dying in Le Très-Haut and elsewhere. For death too is immediate, in that it escapes all possibility of mediation; its supremacy, however, can never be made present, and it can only be approached as a suspension of possibility. Sovereignty, in these circumstances, as Bataille famously observes, 'is Nothing'.34 It constitutes no subject - of desire, meaning, or politics - that is not already undone by the stringent limits within which it is bound. Gods and mortals, Hölderlin went on, are under an obligation to differentiate. They come together under the law, which is itself inaccessible, only as a function of this logic of separation, the effects of which are singular in that they affect each differently and universal in that they affect all without exception. The law enjoins, then, but also disjoins, and to obey the law is to attend to both movements at once: fragile necessity and necessary fragility. Writing follows a similar logic, for if language imposes a measure shared by all ('One thing is sure even now', writes Hölderlin in the poem 'Brod und Wein' (Bread and Wine') that Blanchot was fond of quoting: 'at noon or just before midnight, /Whether it's early or late, always a measure [ein Maß] exists, /Common to all, though his own to each one is also allotted/Each of us makes for the place, reaches the place that he can'35), it is by effecting a separation between this person and the next, without which no communication would occur at all. What is measured, then, by language is also the immeasurable, and the task entrusted to literature in such circumstances, Blanchot puts it, was nothing short of mediating the immediate, communicating the incommunicable, testifying to the impossible. The lesson is a political as well as a poetological one, and argues in favour of effusiveness and sobriety alike, urging patience as well as impatience, and a responsiveness and responsibility both to the immediate and the impossible which cannot be posited as such, and to that which is mediate, which comprises an infinite detour - without either of these demands being confused as one, or the one subordinated to the other. And if it followed that the law was somehow supreme, this was not because all had to be sanctioned by law, but because the law, following the dictates of the neuter, always appealed to what was</page><page sequence="15">'Not In Our Name': Blanchot, Politics , the Neuter 155 more originary than any letter of the law, in much the same way as that which Derrida, in reading La Folie du jour, calls counterlaw - in which Blanchot in his turn was able to recognize, without piety or anthropomorphism, the entanglement of the one with the other, as witnessed by the neuter, and which he formulates thus: Responsibility or obligation towards the Other [Autrui: Blanchot uses the imper- sonal neuter form] which does not derive from the Law, but from which the Law itself may be thought to derive, in respect of everything that makes it irreducible to legality in all its forms, through which necessarily the attempt is made to regulate it, even as it is declared to be the exception or extra-ordinary that cannot be uttered in any previously formulated language.36 Ill There was something in the enactment of the law, then, that exceeded all laws, which was equivalent not to supreme force, violence or power, but to a neutral (or neuter) interruption of law which was also, perhaps more importantly, a law of neutral (or neuter) interruption: not the law as a guarantee of possible force, but the weakness of the impossible as the ground without ground of the law. And from 1958 onwards at least, in a series of explicitly political writings, this affirmative caesura, hiatus, and interval, this neutral suspension of power, irreducible to any form of negativity, was to receive in Blanchoťs writing a decisive, uncompromising, always abyssal appellation: that of refusal. 'Refusal, here', he wrote, 'is absolute, categorical. It does not enter into discussions, nor does it argue its case.'37 Incontrovertible and peremptory, it was anything but transgressive of any established legal norms. It was both more radical and more original; like writing, its only responsibility or responsiveness was to its own anonymous, fragile, and singularly insurmountable necessity: which always exceeds the presence, propriety, property, or properness of any name, including the one we dimly call our own.

'Who signs', asks Derrida, 'the declarative act which founds an institution, and with what so-called proper name?' (16; 470; translation modified). An important moment in Derrida's analysis is marked by his reading of Blanchot's La Folie du jour which he presents as follows: 'Resorting to force [le coup de force] makes law [fait droit], founds law [fonde le droit], gives right [donne droit], gives birth to the law [donne le jour à la lot]. To give birth to the law: read The Madness of the Day by Blanchot' (23; 50; translation modified). 3 Maurice Blanchot, 'Qui?', Cahiers Confrontation, 20 (Winter 1989), 49-51 (50); 'Who?', translated by Eduardo Cadava, Who Comes After the Subject?, edited by Eduardo Cadava, Peter Connor and Jean-Luc Nancy (New York, Routledge, 1991), 58-60 (59); translation modified. 4 Maurice Blanchot, 'Qui?', 50; Who Comes After the Subject?, 60; translation modified.

It follows from Blanchot's formulation that lui, here, cannot be identified with one gender rather than another, but with the multiplicity that exceeds any single given gender. Lui, therefore, refers not only to him, her, or it, but always: the other. 5 See Jeffrey Mehlman, Legacies of Anti-Semitism in France (Minneapolis, Univer- sity of Minnesota Press, 1983); Genealogies of the Text: Literature , Psychoanalysis, and Politics in Modern France (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1995); Steven Ungar, Scandal and Aftereffect : Blanchot and France since 1930 (Minneapolis and London, University of Minnesota Press, 1995); Philippe Mesnard, Maurice Blanchot : le sujet de l'engagement (Paris, L'Harmattan, 1996); Richard Wolin, The Seduction of Unreason: the Intellectual Romance with Fascism from Nietzsche to Postmodernism (Princeton, Princeton University Press, 2004). 6 On Le Très-Haut as a political novel, see Georges Préli, La Force du dehors: extériorité, limite et non-pouvoir à partir de Maurice Blanchot (Paris, Editions Recherches, 1977), 93-139; and my Bataille, Blanchot, Klossowski: Writing at the Limit (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2001), 181-206. 7 See Walter Benjamin, Gesammelte Schriften, edited by Rolf Tiedemann and Hermann Schweppenhäuser, 7 vols (Frankfurt, Suhrkamp, 1974-89), II: 1, 179-203; 'Critique of Violence', translated by Edmund Jephcott, Selected Writings, edited by Marcus Bullock and Michael W.Jennings, 4 vols (London, Harvard University Press, 1996-2003), I, 236-52.

It is worth noting that Benjamin in his analysis ( Gesammelte Schriften , II: 1, 190; Selected Writings , I, 243-4) also anticipates one of the key objections made by Blanchot, among others, to French foreign policy, which was that neither national nor international law could be protected by contractual agreement alone, as successive governments appeared to believe. 8 Walter Benjamin, Gesammelte Schriften , II: 1, 190; Selected Writings , I, 243; translation modified. 9 Maurice Blanchot, 'La Révolution nécessaire', Le Rempart , 62, 22 June 1933, 2. 10 Walter Benjamin, Gesammelte Schriften , II: 1, 190; Selected Writings, I, 243.

Blanchot pointedly cites these words twice over in L'Écriture du désastre, 142, 200; The Writing of the Disaster, 90, 131; as he does so, his principal concern is to disengage Bataille's nothing from any positive or negative dialectic, since in either case the result would be to ground sovereignty in subjective presence. 35 Friedrich Hölderlin, Werke und Briefe, edited by Friedrich Beißner and Jochen Schmidt, 3 vols (Frankfurt a.
