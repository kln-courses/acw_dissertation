<plain_text><page sequence="1">'Shining Legs' The One-footed Type in Hindu Myth and Iconography by ALESSANDRO GROSSATO The various hypotheses of interpretation that were put forward so far on the subject of the Hindu One-footed type have been of a too exclusive character (1). In order to give a more comprehensive interpretation of this complex subject, we must realize that any 'reading' of it in univocal terms inevitably turns out to be either superficial or insufficient, when it does not go so far as to be distorting. Few scholars understand that, together with a natural development and stratification of the meaning that a symbol acquires with the passing of time, there is also an analogical type of overlapping of these meanings which is therefore synchronic rather than diachronic (2). Many of these different meanings often hold good simultaneously and it is more useful to investigate the sometimes intricate reciprocal connections between them rather than give preference to one to the detriment of the others (3). A direct consequence of (1) As far as we know, there are only seven articles, of varying extent, that deal specifically with the symbolic type ekapdda, indeed almost exclusively with Aja Ekapada: Przyluski 1930-32 and 1932-33; Dumont 1933; Pattabiramin 1958; Horsch 1965-66; Banerjee 1972; Donaldson 1982. Each time Aja Ekapada has been identified differently as the Sun, the Moon, the Thunderbolt, the Storm, the Waterspout, etc. The considerable difference in the theses put forward by these scholars is mainly due to the fragmentary use of the textual evidence taken from the Sanskrit sources. From this point of view the most complete is certainly Horsch's, though with some reservations regarding the interpretation, as we shall explain. Of course, many of the misapprehensions over Aja Ekapada could have avoided if the only certain representation, that was not published until the end of the 'fifties' (Shah 1960). The only true iconographical study on ekapdda, that takes into account the representation of Siva Ekapa-da in Orissa, is Donaldson's. (2) In actual fact this process concerns not so much the symbol in itself as the phases which a tradition, in this case Hinduism, goes through in the course of its history, and which constantly entail adjustments and reinterpretations of its mythico-symbolic heritage (Eliade 1971, chap. XIII). Of course the diachronic study of a symbol is also important (Panofsky 1961: 229). (3) As we shall see, it is essential to distinguish different examples of One-footed beings. In fact, it is probably from a more debased type of ekapdda that the western legend about the Sciapodes in India derives. Concerning the concept of 'degradation of symbols' see Eliade 1971: 440-43. [1] 247</page><page sequence="2">this way of considering things is that we must examine not only one One-footed type but all of its significant variants, unlike what has been done up till now. There is still no iconographical study that examines the subject of the ekapdda in its main varieties (4), in spite of the fact that it could contribute somewhat towards solving some of the 'mysteries' of the One-footed type, even more so if the comparison were to be extended to some parallel iconographies which give further useful clues (5). Indeed, when we contemplate now the final result, iconographically speaking, of the One-footed type, namely Siva Ekapdda Trimirti, we must already have acquired an awareness of a great number of things, since in this complex image everything becomes indissolubly condensed. On the other hand, we too are convinced that one of the meanings of ekapdda is more directly connected with the original formulation of this peculiar symbol. In fact, almost all the references that are ascribable to the One-footed type can be traced back essentially to a single, immediately evident one, namely the axis mundi (6); we car be far more precise and state that originally the ekapada refers specifically to the polar axis (7), and later on it mostly does too. In actual fact this interpretation is not new at all (8), but neither can we say that it has ever been sufficiently documented and developed as we think it deserves to be. And this is what we have attempted to do here, casting a glance at some extra-Indian 'facts' that appear to be highly significant. The polar interpretation has moreover the advantage of being able to be directly connected, on the basis of the Dhruva myth, to an intuition that first came to the German scholar J.W. Hauer (9), and was later expressed independently by Bosch (1960), and lastly taken up again by Horsch (1965-66). We refer to the supposed relationship between the representation of the ekapdda and a Pathosformel that is typical (4) Donaldson's article is an exception, though his analysis is limited, geographically and otherwise, to only one variant of the type. The study also falls short as far as interpretation is concerned. (5) We have confined ourselves to pointing out some possible comparisons, some of which are outside of India. (6) 'L'Unipede est donc la colonne qui soutient le firmament, autrement dite l'axe du monde dont I'importance est capitale dans diverses cosmologies asiatiques' (Przyluski 1932-33: 322); 'The goat One foot is a vertical symbol, an axis ...' (Kramrisch 1961: 416). Dumont's inversion of the relationship between axial symbol and One-foot (Dumont 1933: 331) is absurd, as it is clear that the former precedes the latter. As is known, the symbolism of one-footedness is not exclusively Indian. G. de Santillana (1983: 159) recalls that an amazing number of one-footed personages, having different functions, are found all over the world. (7) In our opinion, the single human or animal leg signifying the immobile cosmic axis and thus sometimes 'seen' in some circumpolar constellations, was only subsequently to be identified with the zenithal sun's ray or with the thunderbolt. (8) The first to formulate it seems to have been Brunnhofer 1910: 147 ff. (quoted in Hillebrandt 1981: vol. II, 386, fn. 622). (9) Horsch 1965-66: 20, fn. 86. 248 [21</page><page sequence="3">of Hinduism (10), the sthinu-vrata or vrksdsana (fig. 7), a relationship of which we, too, are deeply convinced and for which we believe we can give a full explanation, on the ground of the equivalence between sthanu-vrata and dharmapida. One-footedness The symbolism of the human form is of very great importance in India for a whole lot of reasons that it is impossible to dwell upon here. Indeed for the Hindus, too, man is the symbol par excellence, by definition. For this reason the Devas can be represented in the form that they assume in their manifestations of a more complete nature (puirnivatdra). In actual fact, in Hinduism traditionally 'human form' does not so much mean the bodily form, sthila-s'artra, as such, but the 'subtle body' or linga s'arira (11), which corresponds to the former only in part. According to the myth, this 'subtle body' or 'body of light' was outwardly manifest for the human race in the Satya Yuga, whereas for the degraded human race of the Kali Yuga it is concealed in the occult photisms of the cakras and the nadis as they are described by hatha yoga. If the entire body as a whole, and thence in the various configurations (dsanas) that it may assume, is symbolic, so are its component parts or members taken separately. For the aforesaid reason they too participate from an archetypal view-point of the light of the liniga-sarira, and are therefore members of light. To this basic characteristics of anthropomorphic symbolism we must add another very important one that is common to all Hindu figurative symbolism, namely the fact that it can generally be traced back to elementary geometric forms (yantra). This stylization, which in art has obvious consequences where composition and style are concerned (12), applies both to the whole body and to its single members in the different postures and attitudes (asanas, mudras, nyasa). If we now consider in greater detail the symbolism of the leg and its component parts, in particular the thigh and the foot, and apply to it what we have just said, the meaning of axis of light or shining support that it comes to have generally is obvious (13). We must therefore bear this constantly in mind when we examine the (10) We use this term in the sense given it by Aby Warburg. Some students of Indian art, in particular Pratapaditya Pal (1970) have chosen to refer explicitly in their work to the iconological method, especially as formulated by Erwin Panofsky, forgetful of the fact that the original conception of this method was mainly connected with the study of the art of 'the expression of emotions'. In this sense it has not yet begun to be used consciously with regard to Indian art. (11) On the importance of the notion of 'subtle body' in Indian art, see in particular Kramrisch 1960. (12) See especially the works of Boner (1962) and Vatsyayan (1983). (13) In fact pdda can also mean 'ray', 'beam', in so far as it is the 'foot of a heavenly body'. In this sense it is legitimate to speak of 'Shining Legs' with regard to the One-footed types. [31 249</page><page sequence="4">various meanings and secondary applications of which this symbol is susceptible, depending on the sphere in which it is specifically used. Actually we may improve on what has been said about the mainly axial meaning of the human leg by observing that at the base of the vertical element a short horizontal stroke is to be added _, corresponding to the widening of the sole of the foot. It is clear that such a diagram may apply to a great many other symbols that are not anthropomorphic, and for that very reason equivalent to each other. It is easy to imagine how many completions of meanings can actually be added on each occasion to the main one, as we shall see in the course of the present study (fig. 1). \SUNS AOTATION I0 0 Fig. 1 - a) Schematic representation of the zenithal sun and its vertical ray as axis mundi (from Irwin 1976: 738. b) Asokan pillar at Sarnath (reconstruction) (from Irwin 1973: 720). c) Apollo as a column at Amyclae, near Sparta in Laconia, as described in Pausanias III, 18, 6 ff. (from A. Furtwingler, Meisterwerke der griechischen Plastik, Leipzig-Berlin 1893). Let us make one last point clear before going any further. According to another fundamental law of symbolism (1), the part always corresponds to the whole, and the latter can be understood in a more or less fuller sense, e.g., to come back to the case in question, the leg may correspond to the whole human body, or to the Cosmos as a whole, or even to Brabman, the Supreme Being. In particular, as far as its ( Cf. Grossato 1979-80: 216-17. 250 [41</page><page sequence="5">correspondence to the Macrocosm or Tribhuvana in Hindu times is concerned, the thigh corresponds to the Heavenly world (15), the knee to the Middle World (16), the foot to the Earth (17). The foregoing applies also to the particular case of the One footed type, that is to say, of an anthropomorphic or theriomorphic being that possesses either naturally or as a result of mutilation only one lower limb. Dumezil has made the keen observation that, with regard to the Indian myths, we can speak, generally, of what he calls 'mutilations qualifiantes' (Dumezil 1968: 150-51). In actual fact, we have to deal not so much with 'mutilation' in the true sense as with 'congenital deformities' so to speak, that are understood as monstra both in the positive, divine sense of the word and, by far more seldom, in the purely negative sense of real deformities. We have said that many other non-anthropomorphic symbols can be traced back geometrically to the previously described diagram. Obviously, the 'nearest' of these symbols to the human leg are all the animal legs, all the more so if we consider the fact that man is strictly, the central symbol in the category of animal symbolism (18). On the contrary, we must add that, in spite of the marginal position that animals (15) On account of its corresponding to the top of the cosmic mountain. In fact the summit of Mount Meru widens out into a broad plateau, where Paradise, Uttarakuru or Indraloka (cf. fig. 2) is situated. The Apsards Urvaii, a 'nymph' of Heaven, is born from the thigh (urv) of the hermit Narayana. It is, on the other hand, a widely diffused mitologema (cf. for example the myth of the birth of Dionysus). (16) Because of its function as a joint. In this regard, Pliny refers to a curious superstition (Naturalis historia, XI 103): 'In accordance with the usages of various nations, certain religious ideas have been attached to the knees. [.. perhaps, because in them is centred the vital strength'. (17) According to the gunas, all that is manifest is tripartite, and this traditional principle can be applied to all parts of the human body. On the correspondence of the head of the Mahdpurusa with Heaven and of his feet with the Earth, cf. Rgveda X 90, 14 and Maitry Upanisad VI 6. Some of the many reasons that determine the 'terrestrial' significance of the foot are the widening of the sole, the number of the toes that refers to the symbolism of the four cardinal points plus the centre and to that of the five elements, etc. According to the description given in the texts, the front and back parts of the Buddha's foot are unnaturally symmetrical in relation to the ankle, to which corresponds the laksana of the Wheel. That the foot corresponds to the Earth and therefore to the Sakti is evident from the iconography of Visnu Anantasayana, where Laksmi caresses the feet of her Spouse. This is also so in the typical attitude of ritual reverence that the disciple has for the Guru and the bhakta for God. The pdda is the foundation, the part (pdda) of the Deity that is most closely connected with this kalpa. It is said in the Puranas that the Kali Yuga could not begin as long as Krsna's foot remained in contact with the earth. Mortality that resides in the heel of one foot (and not both of them) of demigod heroes of various traditions is a fairly significant mythical theme: the vulnerable part, the mortal nature of one who would otherwise be invulnerable (Achilles) or immortal (Krsna) is the lowest part, that is directly in contact with the earth and therefore with humanity. The consistency of the various components of a mitologema is sometimes quite incredible. Graves (1981: 303) gives an interesting list of similar mythological examples, though he does not make any attempt at interpretation with regard to these mythical concordances. (18) On the notion of 'central symbol' within a given category of symbolic forms, cf. Grossato 1979-80: 7-8. [51 251</page><page sequence="6">have in the spiritual sphere compared with man, on account of the inverse sense of analogy that is another important principle of symbolics (19), the relationship sometimes appears inverted so that the animal forms assume more important meanings that the human equivalents (20). As we shall see, as far as one-footedness in Hinduism too is concerned, the earliest examples are predominantly theriomorphic, and this is not due to chance. Brahmapada and dharmapada We must begin by saying that in Sanskrit the term pdda, besides meaning 'foot', also has the meaning of 'quarter' or, more generally, 'support', 'foundation', or, as in English, a metrical significance as a unit of verse. The term lent itself perfectly to symbolic usage, and hence the Veda speaks of the 'foot' or 'feet' of Brahman or of other beings. It is clear that Brahman as such, being the Infinite, can in no way be considered as being made up of 'parts'. It is only a convention of language that makes it legitimate to use such an expression, otherwise quite unsuitable. Indeed, the question of the 'feet' or 'quarters' of Brahman was to continue to be dealt with extensively in subsequent Sanskrit literature, up to the works of the Veddnta. The relationship between the four pddas of Brahman can be considered from two different points of view. If it is true that Brahman in himself, i.e. as not manifest, is one because he is without parts whereas, as manifest, he is subject to the triple form of the gunas, it is also true that, from a 'three-quarter' viewpoint, he persists in his essential unmanifest nature, allowing himself to be involved in the cosmogony only with the smallest 'part' of himself. According to the first point of view, Brahman has one foot in the manifest world and the other three outside it. This division can already be found in the Rgeda (X 90, 3-4) in reference to the Superior Being, and it turns up again in the Maitri Upanisad (VII 11,8) and the Bhagavad Gita (XV). Therefore the one foot most commonly means the manifest aspect of Brahman that can be identified with the axis mundi and with the symbolism of sutrdtman, the 'thread' that binds all creatures and things together (21). This 'foot' will tread on the central point (ndbhi) of each kalpa or manifest world that he crosses perpetually with his immense foot, leaving his impression or vestigium pedis. And since at the centre of every kalpa, according to another mythical representation, there is a section of the Cosmic Mountain (19) Ibid.: 15. (20) Although Kramrisch's statement that 'Aja Ekapa-d is a cosmogonic and ontological symbol of the total creation that is of the macrocosm and of the inner world of man' generally holds good (Kramrisch 1961: 416), we may state more precisely that the meaning of the theriomorphic one-footed beings tends to be macrocosmic, whereas the meaning of the antropomorphic ones is mostly microcosmic. (21) Fot this reason in some passages, from a more synthetic viewpoint, he is attributed with only one foot at all. 252 [6]</page><page sequence="7">(see fig. 2), he, like a true Pddukara will brand its top with his foot of light: 'And if the Tree and Fiery Pillar are supported by such feet, it is because He is firmly established (pratistha) [...] in the world, that is in the last analysis "within you", in the lotus of the heart' (Coomaraswamy 1935: 17). And this, incidentally, is the reason for certain impressions (Buddha-pdda, Visnu-pdda, Siva-pdda) of a 'single foot' that are still the destination of pilgrims, because 'He should be a knower of the tracks of Brahman' (Brhaddranyaka Upanisad, IV 4, 23; ibid. I 4, 7; quoted in Coomaraswamy Fig. 2 - Mount Meru in its canonical proportions ..I***h~sw4 (from Kirf el 1967: Taf . 1.). [7] 25 3</page><page sequence="8">1935: 16), sited on those very mountain- and hill-tops that are local substitutes of Mount Meru (22). As we have mentioned, there is a way of dividing the four padas according to a cosmological, and therefore more analytical perspective. Brahman's 'four feet' are then thought of as being allotted one for each of the Three Worlds, with only the fourth foot (caturtha) remaining in the Non-manifest. A rare iconography of Agni, that we could define as being of Agni-Tripada, is certainly directly connected with this second viewpoint (cf. Rao 1914-16: vol. II, part II, pls. CLII-CLIII, fig. 2). We shall come back to this later. Suffice it to mention here that each one of Agni's feet corresponds to one of his mythical births in Bhub, Bhuvah, and Svah. The same symbolism lies behind the myth of the 'three steps' of Visnu, or Visnu Trivikrama, that has given rise to a well known iconography. In some examples of this, and we refer in particular to the type evidenced at Mamallapuram (fig. 6) (23), the right foot of the Deva is placed firmly on the ground and the whole leg is stiffened in a perfectly straight position that certainly alludes to the 'one foot' of Brahman, with whom Visnu is identified in the Vaisnava aspect, that is intended as axis mundi (24); the left foot is raised as high as it can go, flung out in the impetus of crossing the whole manifestation in three strides (in an upward direction, it should be noted, in the same way as the process of 'releasing' the three gunas from prakrti is traditionally described). It is the 'dynamic' aspect of the God, the one that is apparently involved in the cosmic becoming, in the attempt to sustain it in all its fundamental parts (pddas). We may point out by way of contrast how, in another well known iconography, viz. of Siva Nataraja (or other similar ones too, e.g. of Siva Gajintaka (25), an apparently similar position takes on the opposite meaning. Here, too, the right leg of the Deva, more or less straight, with the foot pressing down on an animal or human support, stands for the axis mundi (26), while the left leg is flung upwards to indicate the possibility and the (22) Perhaps the most famous of these footprints is in Sri Laika-. The Mahavamsa I 77 ascribes it to the Buddha: 'When the Teacher, compassionate to the whole world, had preached the doctrine there, he rose, the Master, and left the traces of his footsteps plain to sight on Sumanakuta'. But Hindus and Muslims consider it a sacred place of theirs own. The phenomenon, however, is common to other religions too. Suffice it to recall the footprint left by the Prophet Muhammad on the top of the rocky hill where the Mosque of Omar stands. The footprint left by God or the Enlightened is a sort of seal that confirms the spiritual power of both the one and the other on this earth. (23) The most complete analysis of this representation has been made by Boner 1962: 96-106. (24) According to Kuiper (1983: 49), Visnu 'by his position in the center must also in Vedic belief have been immediately associated with the cosmic pillar (Skambha)'; in addition Griswold (1971: 283) explains, 'For the highest step of Visnu is described in language which clearly identifies it with the position of the sun in the zenith'. (25) Banerjee (1972: fig. VIII) describes a very peculiar image (8th century) of Siva Gajantaka with only one elephant leg, like Aja Ekapa-da. The clay figure now in the Museum fiir Indische Kunst, Berlin, discovered near Kizil by A. Griinwedel. (26) See especially Coomaraswamy 1974: 83-95 and Zimmer 1951: 146-68. 254 [81</page><page sequence="9">direction of release from the samvsdra, that is symbolized by the circle-cycle of fire: it is mahdpralaya for the kalpa, or moksa for the sddhaka of tantric laya-yoga. However, it is raised to destroy and not to strengthen the Triloka, and we may note that while Visnu raises the left leg to the left, Siva on the contrary bends it backwards and to the right. This inversion is not a chance one, alluding as it does to the doctrine of the 'two ways'. Visnu Trivikrama cannot be considered as an exemplification of the ekapdda theme, but his meaning can be fully grasped only by referring to this theme, all the more so as Visnu Ekapada is explicity mentioned in the Mahdbharata (XIII 149, 95). But let us come back to Brahman, or rather Saguna Brahman or Brahma, facing towards the manifestation that He has produced. As is known, his vehicle (vhana), which 'hatches' the Egg with the same name floating on the primeval Waters, is Hainsa. And he is also the first theriomorphic one-footed type we have to deal with. This is how he is described in the Sanatsujdtiya (Udyoga Parva 45, 1762): 'The Gander, ascending, does not withdraw his one foot from the sea, and were he to lift that outstretched (ray), there would be neither death nor immortality'. In later tantric literature the name of this mythical bird was to be interpreted as a compound of ham and sa, or, onomatopoetically, from the sounds emitted in two phases of Brahman's breathing, manifesting with exhalation (sa), dispelling with inhalation (ham) (27). Hainsa is therefore virtually an equivalent of the sitrdtman, 'axial breath', which at once manifests and sustains all things, keeping them united with Itself. On the other hand, it is clear that the one leg immersed in the Cosmogonic Waters is the axis mundi again, in this case descending from above like a bird (28). We may remark, by the way, that similar reasons probably lie behind the symbolic importance that some species of wading birds have in various traditional forms. As is known, these birds are accustomed to standing up straight in the water, first on one leg and then on the other. This is a characteristic to which we must pay particular attention. In India one of these wading birds, the marabou, is particularly venerated by the people (29). To be sure, this may be a 'superstition' of the myth of Harhsa-Ekapdda, but it is important to note that this animal is 'sacred' to the Hindus in that, by standing at lenght on (27) Cf. Avalon 1974: 165-74. The symbolic relationship between the 'breath' and its 'winged' manifestation is evident. (28) To use the language of physics, the direction of the axis being established, the sense can be considered as ascendant or descendant, depending from which point of view we look at it. On the twofold course of the cosmic axis in connection with its ascendant and descendant creation, now see also Verardi 1985. (29) Cf. Charbonneau-Lassay 1974: pp. 583-85: 'En Asie, les Hindous lappellent le Philosophe, et lui pretent de singuliers privileges d'ordre extra naturel. [...] Aussi bien, au Bengale, pr6tend-on que chaque marabout porte en soi 'ame d'un saint Brahmane. [..] En Asie brahmanique, comme en Afrique islamique le marabout repr6senta symboliquement I'ascete meditatif et pieux, le scrutateur et 'appr6ciateur des choses divines, le sage'. Oddly enough, in northern Africa the Sufi members of the Turuqs get their name from this bird, viz. the Marabouts. 191 255</page><page sequence="10">one leg, it is supposed to constantly do 'penance' (vrata), and what is more, a particular type of penance, namely sthanu-vrata, that we mentioned at the beginning and that we shall come across several more times in our itinerary. On the other hand, Brahma himself is sometimes represented in this singular posture. In this case the reference to the 'one foot' of Brahman in the manifested is explicit (30). Other theriomorphic one-footed types are the pair formed by Gauri, the cosmic Cow equivalent to Vdc, the 'primordial word', and the Bull of the dharma, of which in a way Gauri is the attendant. Indeed it is to the two of them that the passage in the Rgveda about the first theriomorphic metamorphosis of Purusa and Prakrti in view of the production of all manifest beings should be referred. The speculations about the sacred monosyllabe OM, which were to be formulated most completely in the Upanisads, and which there is no point in dwelling upon here (31), are also closely related to the symbolism of the four legs of Vac-Gauri and the Bull of dharma. In a sense, here we are at the half-way point between the still metaphysical meaning of the one-footedness and the solely cosmological one, with quite strictly astronomical overtones. In fact, what is said about Va-c-Gaur! is an exact copy of the aforesaid speculations about Brahman, but, as we said, it is not mere chance that a cow is being spoken of (32). According to the Manu Smrti (I 81-82; VIII 16), the dharma or 'cosmic law', personified in a mythical Bull of the same name, gradually diminishes throughout the course of the present Manvantara: with every Yuga that passes one leg of the Bull is mutilated as it were, so that in the present quarter, the last age or Kali Yuga, he is left standing unsteadily on only one leg. As we were saying, the four pddas of the Bull are still Brahman's, but in a cosmological sense. Therefore, apart from a numerical symbolism that evidently follows upon the cosmic one illustrated above with reference to a definite temporal cycle, and apart from an obvious use of a 'moral' or, better still, dharmic kind in a narrow sense, we may observe that the dharma, given its axial connotation (33), always has one pdda anyway, which, like Brahman's 'foot', in this case leaves its 'print' or nandi-pdda in the middle of the kalpa (34). Thi nandi-pdda is, then, a true dharmapdda, the 'Print of the (30) We refer in particular to a four-headed Brahma with the aspect of a penitent Rsi carved on a pillar of the Sesagirirayar mandapa at Srirangam, that is reproduced in Hari Rao 1967: 80-81. (31) On this subject we refer the reader especially to Horsch 1965-66. See also Padoux 1975, in particular pp. 32-34. (32) Of the divine Cow, born on the Churning of the Milky Ocean, the Mahdbharata says that she did penance by standing on one leg (Anuasana Parva, Section LXXXIII). It is interesting to note that she devotes herself to this ascetic task on the top of Mount Kailasa, and that in the end Brahma tells her: 'You are now above the three worlds - Heaven Earth and Hell'. (33) It should be borne in mind that danda, the club that is the symbol of the Law, is thought of as a 'son' of Dharma, e.g. in Manu VII 14 and Visnu Purdna I 7. (34) It is interesting to recall that, according to the Sioux mythology, the bison standing to the West to repel the waters is losing a hair every year, and a leg at every age. When hairs and legs are lost, the waters will invade the world again, and the cycle will come to an end (see Brown 1970: 23, fn. 19). 256 [10]</page><page sequence="11">Law' (3). Footprints of this type, ascribed to the vdhana of Siva, are venerated at Padana, near Bombay, in compliance with the Vedic exhortation 'ward the footprints of the law of heaven and in the innermost are pregnant of the ultimate ideas' (Rgveda, X 5, 2). Agni is also directly connected with the Bull: 'Yet in fact the designation "Nandi's track" and the actual representation of hoofprints at Padana accord well enough with the Saiva associations, the notion of hoofprints equally well also with an original connection with Agni; that Siva and Agni can be assimilated and in certain aspects identified needs no demonstration here. The designation 'taurine', employed by some authors, is probably the best available for our symbol, being appropriate equally to Agni, Siva and Buddha. In Rg Veda, I 65, 1 (padaih), and IV 5, 3 (where Agni is a "mighty bull", and the Saman chant "naught other than the hidden track of an ox", padark na gor apagiilhaii), the metaphor is employed of tracing the lost Agni by his footprints' (Coomaraswamy 1935: 16). At this point it is hard to account for Rao's perplexity (1914-1916: vol. II, part II, 524) over the fact that in some cases '[...] a bull (not a ram as required by the dgamas) is sculptured behind Agni as his vehicle', which is certainly an exception on a strictly iconographical level, but with good reason. But the symbolism of the Bull's Leg as a pillar of heaven is not exclusive of India. We come across it especially in Egypt, and it is strange that until now no one has compared the mythical data of these two traditions. In Egypt 'Bull's Thigh' (Maskheti) was the name of the constellation of the Great Bear (36). In the circular zodiac of Dendera, that is reproduced here (fig. 3), Ursa Major stands out almost in the centre of the representation of the heavenly vault, which emphasizes its axial meaning (37). (35) 'Dhammapada should perhaps be translated in this sense as "Vestige of the Law", dhamma padani as "traces of the Law" ' (Coomaraswamy 1935: 16). Banerjea (1974: 51), remarks that '[...] Rudra himself is called a bull in some Vedic verses (cf. R. V. II 33, 8: Pra babhrave vrsabhdya i"vitice etc., or II 33, 6: Unma mamanda vrsabho marutvan, etc.). Now, on the basis of this very fact, Rudra-Siva is sometimes primarily conceived in the form of a bull, and there are definite numismatic data in support of the representation of Siva as a bull'. (36) It probably refers to the thigh of the bull Api, in which case we have a conception that is altogether analogous to the Hindu one. The strange story related by Herodotus about the killing of the sacred bull by the Persian emperor Cambyses seems to confirm that the thigh of Api somehow stood for the 'dharma' of Egypt: 'When the priests led Apis in, Cambyses - for he was well-nigh mad - drew his dagger and made to stab the calf in the belly, but smote the thigh [...] So the Egyptian festival was ended, and the priests were punished, and Apis lay in the temple and died of the blow on the thigh. When he was dead of the wound, the priests buried him without Cambyses' knowledge' (Herodotus, III 29). Still stranger is the divine sanction that later struck the emperor who wished to replace the Egyptian 'Law' by his own: 'As he mounted, the cap slipped off the scabbard of his sword, and the naked blade struck his thigh, wounding him in the same part where he himself had once smitten the Egyptian god Apis; and believing the blow to be mortal, Cambyses asked what was the name of the town where he was' (III 64). Other 'symbolic wounds' on the thigh could be recalled here. (37) Many other traditions have seen in this bright circumpolar constellation an animal or human leg. We could mention in particular the Altaic, Maya, Incaic and Aztec mythologies. For South America, see in particular Levi-Strauss 1980: 287 ff. [111 257</page><page sequence="12">. lot1( Fig. 3 - The zodiac of Dendera, detail showing Maskheti (Ursa Major) as a bull's thigh (from Franz Boll, Sphaera, Leipzig 1903, Taf. II). We do not wish to prove anything by this, except that other traditions have also used the symbolism of one-footedness with reference to the circumpolar area of the sky. But there is an iconographical variant of Maskheti that we shall have to come back to that is perhaps even more closely connected to the Hindu data. For the moment we shall merely mention that in Egypt 'Cape of the Thigh' was an epithet of the Pole. The One-foot would thus have the meaning of the cosmic and polar Axis, that is to say, it would be a symbolic equivalent of Mount Meru, on whose peak Dhruva, the polar star, shines (38). Mount Meru is sometimes described and represented as a reverse cone, a form that remarkably recalls the stylization of a leg (fig. 2). The ekapada is no other than one of the countless axial symbols, therefore an equivalent of the (38) Cf. Mukherii 1969: 20: '[...1 the summit of Sumeru i.e., the north pole of the earth'. 258 [121</page><page sequence="13">Tree of the World too, as is shown by one of the Sanskrit names of the latter, Pddapa ('drinking through the foot'). The importance of polar symbolism in Hinduism, as in other traditions too, has often been spoken of, more or less far from the point. This has inevitably thrown discredit on an extremely important field of mythico-symbolic research that is widespread almost everywhere, because it is closely linked to the observation of precise astronomical phenomena. It is not a question of demonstrating the existence of an 'Arctic Home' of Vedic man (39), which is, historically speaking, problematical to say the least, but of recognizing the reality, mythologically speaking, of this constant reference in Vedic, epic and Puranic literature. There is a strange and obscure passage of the Mahdbhdrata about the ki Visvamitra, which is also the name of one of the seven stars of Ursa Major (Saptarksa) that gives the essential facts of our research, i.e. on the One-footed type, Tribhuvana, Meru, circumpolar constellations: 'It was Visva-mitra who in anger created a second world and numerous stars beginning with Sravand [...] He can burn the three worlds by his splendour, can, by a stamp [of his foot], cause the earth to quake. He can sever the great Meru from the earth and hurl it to any distance' (Mahdbharata I 71). So it is to this area of the sky, near the star that shines on the peak of Mount Meru, that we must now devote our attention: 'The region between the seven Rsis and Dhruva, the third region of the sky is the excellent celestial path of Visnu (Vispupdda) and is the splendid abode, 0 twice-born one, of the ascetics, who have controlled their senses and are freed from sins and in whom virtue and vice are annihilated [ ...] In this portion the splendid Dhrmva is stationed as the pivot of atmosphere' (Vispu Purdna, II 8) (40). It is along this 'pivot' (skambha) among other things that the Ga*ga, the vertical river, flows and it is not by chance that 'She issues from the nail of the great toe of Visnu's left foot' (41). 'Dhruva, with devotion, holds her on his crown day and night. And thence the seven Rsis practise their devout austerities in her water wreathing their braided locks with her waves. The orb of the Moon, surrounded by her accumulated current, increased in lustre by her contact. Having issued from the moon she falls on the mount Sumeru and thence to purify the world, flows to the four quarters of the earth' (Visnu (39) We refer, of course, to L.B.G. Tilak's work. With all the aforesaid reservations it is still a useful point of reference for the documentation it contains. (40) It is significant that this part of the sky takes its name from the 'third step' of Visnu: 'The portion of the heavens lying to the north of the Rishis in the constellation Saptarshi Mandala, which is surrounded by the circle of Dhruvas i.e., the northern pole stars of successive ages and at the centre of which lies the Kadamba i.e., the Pole of the ecliptic, is called the Tritiya Vishnu-Pdda or the param-pada of Vishnu' (Mukherji 1969: 19-20). (41) The stream passes through the Saptarshis in Kasyapiya Mandala (= constellation Auriga). At last it falls on the Summit of Sumeru (Mukherji 1969: 20). It is not by chance then that the Gariga sometimes appears beside Siva Ekapa-da (cf. Donaldson 1982: 155, fig. 13, here fig. 8). [13] 259</page><page sequence="14">Purina, II 8). The left foot of Visnu, Dhruva, the Saptarksa, Meru, are all located along one and the same axis. That the mystery of the 'One-foot' should be solved by investigation along these lines is not, as we said, a recent idea (42). The Bhagavata and Visnu Purdna tell the story of the prince Dhruva, who stood motionless on one leg for more than one month. It is at the invitation of Kubera that, in order to attain Freedom, he plunges into a yogic contemplation of the Visnupdda which abides in the heart of every one of his bhaktas: '0 son of Uttanapada, we have learnt that you are very close to Visnu's feet [...]'; 'For terminating sarkzsira, please worship him whose feet are worth resorting, and who destroys sar,ksara [...]' (Bhagavata Purdna, IV 12, 6-7). Thus, Dhruva 'When he used to stand upon his left foot (for praying) one-half of the earth bent beneath him and when he used to stand upon his right foot the other half of the earth sank down. And when he used to stand touching the earth with his toes, the whole earth shook with its mountains and rivers, o twice-born one' (Visnu Purdna, I 12). It is the sthanu-vrata, the 'vow' that consists precisely of standing motionless on one leg like a column (sthdu; see fig. 7). In the works on yoga this position is also called vrksasana, or the position (dsana) of the Tree (vrksa). It is the position of Harksa-Ekapdda and of the marabou (43). Thanks to it Dhruva succeeds in getting Visnu to manifest himself before him, and the prince then confirms his bhakti: '0 lord, do thou grant me the understanding of placing my praises at thy feet'. Visnu replies by revealing to him the divine metamorphosis that is due to him as his reward: '0 boy! Thou shalt, by my favour, o Dhruva, attain to a station which is above the three worlds and become the stay of stars and planets: there is not the least doubt about it. I do confer upon thee, o Dhruva, a station, which is above those of the Sun, the Moon, stars, Mercury, Venus, Saturn, and all other constellations; above the regions of the seven Ris and the divinities who traverse the atmosphere. Some of the celestial live for four ages; some for the reign of a Manu; but thou shalt live the duration of a kalpa' (Visnu Purina, 1 12). Thus, Dhruva is destined to live for a whole kalpa, that is, for the duration of that world on whose summit he has placed his celestial foot: 'He is still the support of those whose span of life is upto the end of a kalpa' (Bhagavata Purana, V 23) (44). (42) As hold above this interpretation was suggested first by Brunnhofer (1910: 147 ff.), whose work we could not see. Hillebrandt (1981: II 386, fn. 622) refers to it saying: 'I think that Brunnhofer's view that he [= the ekapdda] is the Pole Star should not be dismissed out of hand as has happened, Not great value should be attached to the verses in TBr III 1. 2. 8'. (43) Cf. above, fn. 29. (44) Probably the variant given in the Bhagavata Purdna IV 12, 30, according to which, when he is about to get into the chariot of Visnu's emissaries that are about to take him to his lofty destination, he places his fateful foot on the head of Death that has unexpectedly appeared, signifies precisely the immortality that he has won: 'At that time, when the son of Uttanapada saw that the god of Death had come, he placed his foot on the head of that god and mounted that wonderful aerial mansion'. Later, in the iconography of Siva Ekapada, a corpse is sometimes seen crushed beneath his foot (see fig. 10) 260 [141</page><page sequence="15">In this perspective he can be likened to the Adi Manu. On the other hand the same posture is attributed to Manu Vaivasvata (cf. below). It is the 'wheel hub' function that a cakravartin fulfils (45 Aja Ekapdda In late Egyptian times the constellation Ursa Major was sometimes symbolized by a Ram's leg instead of a Bull's. It is the iconographical variant of which we made mention above. A one-footed ram, called the 'foreleg of Khnum' is represented at Edfu (46). We merely point this out without making any inferences as to its possible connections with the Indian iconography of Aja Ekapada. Aja Ekapa-da, who is almost always associated with Ahi Budhnya (47), is the last example of a theriomorphic one-footed type that we have to take into consideration, but it is also the one for which the most diverse and apparently contradictory interpretations have been proposed. He is one of the 'Ekddas'a-Rudras, [...] The enumeration of the names of the Rudras are quite different [...]' (Rao 1914-1916: vol. II, part II, 386). And to make matters more complicated, especially from the standpoint of astronomical symbolism, he is also the deity that presides over the 24th Naksatra (lunar mansion) (48). Aja can also mean 'goat' as well as 'unborn'. As usual, many authors have become divided on this point, rejecting now one and now the other translation of the word. In actual fact it is, we think, a false problem. In traditions like Hinduism there practically never exists the unisemantic use of words, quite the contrary (49). (45) This could perhaps explain at least in part the similar position assumed ritually by Far-Eastern sovereigns, for example the ritual dance with one leg of the Chinese emperor, which was identified with the constellation Ursa Major (cf. Granet 1971: 55; de Santillana 1983: 159-60). In this way they are likened to the polar axis, the symbol par excellence of imperial office in Shakespeare as well (cf. Julius Caesar, Act III, Scene I). In China the wise man is frequently compared to the Polar Star (cf. Louen-yu II 1). (46) von Dechend (de Santillana 1983: 460) refers to Monumenti dell'Egitto e della Nubia, ed. by Ippolito Rosellini (1844: vol. III, fig. 24). Horsch, who also mentions Chnum (1965-66: 23, fn. 105) is evidently unaware of the one-footed example. (47) We definitely agree with the interpretation of Ahi Budhnya that Bosch suggests: 'it is the macrocosmic counterpart of the Devi Kundalini, the snake dwelling in the lowermost body-cavity and closely associated with the stambhta of the microcosm' (1960: 208, fn. 168). More generally we might also say that Ahi Budhnya, being apodal by definition, is opposed to Ekapa-da just as the formless chaos is opposed to the 'divine ray' that is destined to illuminate and organize it. (48) See especially Ghosh 1932, but also Kane 1974: 504 and Kirfel 1959: 65. This is an aspect that we shall to overloock completely here. (49) We agree with Kramrisch (1961: 412), who writes: 'It seems that both these meanings are present in this image of the manifesting and at the same time transcendental One'. [151 261</page><page sequence="16">Therefore aja in the sense of 'unborn' will refer to the superior meaning of the God, who exists ab aeterno in the Unmanifested (with his other 'three feet', as we might well say now). The terracotta from Rang Mahal in the Bikaner Museum (fig. 5) is the only surviving figurative example of this deity that we have so far. The head is that of a ram, the torso and the two arms are anthropomorphic, the leg, as has been said, is that of an elephant. There is a yajnopavita around the torso. The right hand is missing, while the left holds 'a leafy basket full of fruits or sweet balls'. In the lower part of the body a lihgam is visible. According to R. Nath (1969: 21, fig. 30), it 'is even more definitely influenced by Graeco-Roman ideas of form'. L'Hernault (1978: 34-36) has moreover brought attention to a sort of 'proto-Naigamesa' (50) represented on a terracotta of Kusana times from Mathura (fig. 4) where the head of a ram can be clearly seen on the mouth of a pot-bellied jar (51). According to the French scholar the scene represents the performance of an animal sacrifice, perhaps with the aim of beseeching the birth of a son. In any case, we think it is right to conclude that 'La parente de cette figuration avec l'Aja-Ekapada est manifeste' (ibid.: 35). The opinion that 'le pied de l'6l6phant est sans doute l'animalisation de la jarre at offrande' is rather more debatable. In actual fact the two symbols are equivalent on the basis, as we said at the beginning, of the common geometric pattern. Aja, being one of the eleven Rudras (52), is also a form of Agni - as Durga clearly states in his Commentary to the Nirukta (XII 29) (53) -, the Deva that has the ram or the goat as his vdhana (Agni is often represented with one or two ram's heads) (54), and as choosing to be 'born' in the manifest Three Worlds, were Brahman has 'only one foot'. It is curious to note how three of the hypotheses most frequently put forward by scholars identify Aja Ekapa-da alternatively with the Sun, the thunderbolt and the column of fire or smoke rising from the sacrifical altar; we say curious because these identifications correspond in fact to Agni's three forms of manifestation. They are located at three different height levels along the cosmic or polar axis (55). In (50) A personification of sacrifice, that is also one of the four aspects of Skanda, sometimes identified with the sixth head of this Deva (cf. L'Hernault 1978: 30 ff.). (51) See Joshi 1968. (52) In the Vilvakarma-silpa Aja and Ekapa-da are taken as two distinct Rudras, occupying the first and second places respectively in the list of Rudras, while Ahi Budhnya comes third. (53) In an invocation made to him in the Vdjasaneyi SarMhitd V 33, he is called adhvapati, 'Lord of the Way', a characteristic epithet of Agni. We should note that what is meant here is the 'straight way', in a vertical sense. (54) See e.g. in Rao 1914-16: vol. II, part II, pl. CLII. (55) We may observe that fig. 5 has symbolic connotations on three superimposed levels: ram's head, Phallus, elephant's leg. The first corresponds to the Sun, since '[...] it is well known that in the mythology the sun is often represented by a horned animal' (Dumont 1933: 332), the second to the middle or subtle (which is also the literal meaning of Lirigam) world, and the third to the Earth, the elephant being a recurrent Hindu symbol of the earth's stability. 262 [161</page><page sequence="17">Fig. 4 - A Kushan plaque from Mathura showing Naigamesa, the sacrificial ram, whose head is posed over a jar (from L'Hernault 1978: 34). particular, in the course of the present study we have made mention on several occasions of the fact that the sun is always, originally and eminently, in its zenith: 'The "one foot" of the Sun as Aja Ekapada, e.g., in RV VIII 41.8, where Varuna "with his bright foot ascends the vault, with the Pillar holds apart the paired spheres, upholds the sky" ' (Coomaraswamy 1977: 377, fn. 3). In this connection we may also recall what is said in the Visnu Purdna (II 9): 'And the sun, 0 foremost of Munis, is upheld by Dhruva [...]'. In our opinion there is another precise reference to the polar position of Stiirya, who appears there with the appellation Rohita, in Atharvaveda (XIII 1, 6-7): 'Rohita begot heaven and earth; there the Paramesthin stretched the thread. There Aja Ekapa-da fixed himself; by his strength he made firm heaven and earth. Rohita made firm heaven and earth; by him the heavenly light was established, by him the firmament. By him the atmosphere and the spaces were measured out; through him the Gods obtained immortality' (56) Here Rohita overlaps and is almost identified with Aja Ekanpida. (56) According to V. Henry and M. Bloomfield, Aja Ekapa-da is definitely 'the sun', and interpretation that was subsequently agreed with by Dumont, according to whom 'their interpretation [171 263</page><page sequence="18">Fig. 5 - Aja Ekapdda from Rang - Mahal, Gupta Period, Bikaner Mu seum (from Agrawala 1960: pl. ~L k ~XXIV) fig. 15). Both of them, the one with his 'ray', the other as the 'polar axis', are none other than the 'thread' of Paramesthin, or a manifestation of the suitrdtman, and they pass through 'heaven', 'atmosphere' and 'earth', steadying them, as is shown exactly by the same is almost certainly the correct one' (1933: 326). From a roughly positivist point of view Dumont writes (ibid.: 327): 'I think, that it was conceived as the necessary support of the sun as a sort of pillar supported by the earth, rising with the sun in the morning, supporting it in its perilous journey through the sky, and coming down with it in the evening'. It is quite unnecessary to ascribe to the Hindus the ingenuous idea of some sort of material support that helped the sun to stay up in the sky. The one foot is one of its own rays, moreover, its only normal ray on the earth's surface. 264 [181</page><page sequence="19">Fg.6 'F4 Fig. 6 -Visnu Trivikrama at Mimallapuram, 7th century (from Boner 1962: pl. IX). expression 'made firm' that refers consecutively both to one and to other: '[...] in as much as the one foot of the Sun, which is also the Axis of the Universe and lance where with the Dragon was smitten, is itself "a golden shaft at dawn and one of bronze (ayas) at dusk", RV V 62.8' (Coomaraswamy 1977: 446, fn. 50) (57). This symbolism (57) 'Called the shining one, he who, as a dark foot (or as a dark ray), holds the waters in the sky, he sends in showers the water in the rainy season - what can be more wonderful than that? But for eight months, with his shining ray, he takes back, in time, the water that was poured - what can be more wonderful than that?' (Mahdbhdrata XII 362, 7-8). Przyluski chose to see in this passage a reference to waterspouts. On the contrary, it clearly refers to the sacrificial cycle (and in this case the dark limb is also the column of smoke rising from the Vedic altar) or the cycle of the waters, and to the twofold ascendant and descendant direction of the cosmic currents along the ekapada or axis mundi. The year's cycles of the universal manifestation. The symbolism of the 'black foot' (asita pdda) is also found in some Celtic tales and those of the later Courtly cycles: '[...] continue until you come to a great cleared field with a mound in the centre, and on that mound you will see a great black man, no smaller than two men of this world. He has one foot, and one eye in the middle of his forehead [...]' ('Oewin, or the Countess of the Fountain, in Gantz 1979: 196; cf. also Zimmer 1983: 121). [191 265</page><page sequence="20">3. Fig. 7 - A yogin practising sthanu vrata. Sri Minaksi temple at Madu rai. 17th century (from Schwarz 1980: fig. 417). provides, amongst other things, the clue to the interpretation of the so-called 'ASoka pillars', as has been admirably demonstrated by Irwin (1973-76: fig. 1, b) ( 8). This 'solar' equivalence was to acquire special importance in the development of one of the principal darsanas of Hinduism, Sdtkhya. In it buddhi, the divine ray of the sun, was considered the first production of purusa and prakrti, identifying it with transcendental Intellect. This ray is considered to be a single one, therefore with 'only one foot' as long as it is in the formless dominion (in the world of the Devas), and then branches out indefinitely in the formal dominion, in correspondence with each (58) The same analogical process that led to the representation of the Sun's vertical ray, its 'one foot', in the shape of a column, probably also lies behind the image of the God Apollo at Amyclae, near Sparta, in Laconia, where he was represented as an antropomorphical column placed on a throne (see fig. 1, c; cf. Polybius V 19, 2 and Pausanias III, 18, 6, ff.). 266 [201</page><page sequence="21">separate manifest being: 'It is by this "best ray", the "one foot" of the Sun, that the "heart" of each and every separated essence is directly connected with the Sun' (Coomaraswamy 1977: 421). As for the identification with the thunderbolt, this lends itself to many interesting comparisons outside of India (59). If as a 'ray of Sun' it descends to earth and as a 'column of fire' it ascends to give sacrificial vigour to the Sun, as a 'flash of lightning' it moves simultaneously in both directions, as is evident in its traditional stylization. It is clear that the flash of lightning unites, like an axis of fire and light together, all three of the 'navels' (ndbhis) of the Triloka. This motif of the 'axis of fire' was to appear again in the Puranas with the myth of the flaming liigam of Siva. In this connection it is interesting that the only representation of Aja Ekapada known to us has a conspicuous lihgam, as we shall see later in the iconography of Siva Ekapada. Within Hinduism itself there are many references that could be expanded on. A particularly interesting one, as has already been pointed out, is the relationship between the identity of Aja Ekapada and Skanda (60). As for the column of fire or smoke, evidently the idea is of Agni in the quality of sacrificial fire, and therefore of his terrestrial birth. The dark colour of the fleece, in particular, is supposed to refer to the colour of the smoke. The rare image of Agni published by Rao, that we referred to above, seems to us to sum up what we have said so far. Its two goat or ram's heads (61) remind us of Aja, whereas its three human feet stand for the three births of the Deva. This image is all the more interesting if we compare it with those of Siva Ekapdda Trimurti (figs. 12-14), where three legs can also be seen. In both cases we must also consider a superior meaning of the three feet, in reference to the three padas of Brahman unmanifested. In the particular case of the Siva Ekapdda Trimuirti a combination of these different meanings would thus be expressed. On the other hand, Banerjea (1974: 232) also admits that the Siva Ekapdda Trimzirti is 'evidently based on the Vedic Aja Ekapada', as it is possible to note the transition from one form to the other in epic literature where Aja Ekapada is described 'both as one of the eleven Rudras and an epithet of Siva' (ibid.). (59) Macdonell was the first to refer to Aja Ekapa-da as 'lightning', interpreting the one foot as 'the single streak which strikes the earth'. (60) Cf. L'Hernault 1978: 33-35; see also Grossato 1982. Etymologically the name Skanda means 'he who jumps', probably referring to the characteristic war-dance that the God was said to perform on one foot. In this connection we may also mention the Danavas, demoniac beings that are sometimes considered as a sub-category of the Asuras, and sometimes as non-Aryan peoples with the peculiar trait of 'leaping' when they were to go into battle (cf. Harivathia, quoted by Przyluski 1932-33: 317). The Celtic God Lug, who was already identified with Apollo in antiquity, also had a similar characteristic: '[...] debout sur un seul pied, tenant un seul oeil ouvert, il fait, en chantant, le tour de l'armee de Tuatha De Danann' (de Vries 1975: p. 61). (61) As is known, Agni is traditionally two-faced, with the purpose of referring to the two aspects of fire, light and heat, or to the flames and the smoke. [211 267</page><page sequence="22">Siva Ekapdda As Gaudapada writes in his commentary to Chapter XLVI of the Sahkhykdrika, 'Impediment is doubt, that is, ignorance; which is when, for example, a man, on seeing a post, is in doubt as to whether it is a post or a human being'. On the other hand, it is not only through 'ignorance' that Indians are led to identify, sometimes unwittingly, the human figure with all the main axial symbols. That this is a symbolic assimilation that is deeply rooted in Indian psychicism can be seen from a curious scene that is described in the play Jivanandana by Anandarayamakhin (Act V 4), where one of the characters wishes to escape notice: 'Well, surely, taking the posture of a pillar, I will stand here; and when this man passes along, I shall go away at a quick pace'. Upon seeing him, a slave in turn remarks: 'I can see neither hands nor feet, and I cannot see anything moving there. What I can see is the characteristic of its height, whence [I infer that] that is a pillar'. Nor must we forget the existence of a precise symbolic element that was in frequent ritual use, the Indradhvaja, Indra's standard, that 'receives the epithets of this god and is also materially identified with him as is shown by the identification of its foot, central part and top with the god's feet, trunk and head' (Bosch 1960: 186-87). We must reconsider more carefully the sthdnu-vrata or vrksasana. We have already said that J.W. Hauer had sensed the connection between this yoga position and the representation of Siva Ekapada, and authors like Bosch and Horsch have approached the question from various angles. In fact, it is natural that the anthropomorphic one footed 'type' follows the example of real human attitudes and behaviour and, more particularly, as in all Hindu iconography, of the sddhus and the yogis. This should be connected with what we said earlier (fn. 20), namely that the anthropomorphic version of the one-footed type has a primarily microcosmic meaning, in the sense that it alludes especially to the spiritual fulfilment of him who becomes a Universal man by uniting Heaven and Earth. As we have seen, the position on the one leg can correspond to the 'descent' of divine action (a cosmogonic or stabilizing action of the dharma), as well as to the 'ascent' into heaven, e.g. of Dhruva. In this latter case One-footedness alludes to the Superior Being (Mahdpurusa), to the Fulfilled, to the jivanmukta made jagatguru: and this takes us back to the symbolism of buddhi that we have already considered (62). The mukta, as Universal Man, is then assimilable to (62) In a 11th-century Vragal reproduced by Donaldson (1982: fig. 25), that is tripartite like most Viragals, an ithyphallic Siva Ekapada appears in the upper part of the stele, corresponding to Svah. Apart from the obvious allusion to the 'one foot' crossing the Tribhuvana, there is a clear reference also to buddhi, the 'divine Ray' of the devayanic Kramamukti that the vira at his death must ascend as a dead Ksatriya. The moment of death is represented in the lower register of the stele, corresponding to Bhzih. It is important to note that the Ekapa-da here is placed between Si-rya and Candra, in a perfect polar station (Dhruva Dik). 268 [221</page><page sequence="23">the axis mundi, to the 'Fiery Column' or Vanaspati, the Tree of Fire (63). First of all, as far as the sthanu-vrata as such is concerned, we think a fundamental meaning that the assumption of this particular posture has is that of conforming to dharma, viz. the restoration to a situation of unchanging stability, in correspondence with the specifically axial significance of dharma itself. The sthdnu-vrata of Manu Vaivasvata described in the Mahdbharata, thanks to which the epiphany of the Matsya Avatara occurs, is dharmapdda par excellence: '0 King, 0 foremost of men, there was a powerful and great Rsi of the name of Manu [...]. And standing on one leg and with uplifted hand, that lord of men did severe penance in the jujube forest called Visala. And there with head downwards and with steadfast eyes he practised the rigid and severe penance for ten thousand years. And one day, whilst he was practising austerities there with wet clothes on and matted hair on head, a fish approaching the banks of the Cirini [...]' (Vana Parva, Section CLXXXVI). The penitent becomes a sort of 'personification' of the axis mundi, just like what happened primordially in the case of Dhruva before he became the Polar Star. On the other hand, the 'Great Penitent' in the sense of Mahayogfis Siva himself, one of whose epithets is Sthanu, 'Column'. This asana is a characteristic prerogative especially of a particular Hindu sddhana that has almost completely disappeared nowadays, namely that of the sauras, those who have devoted themselves specifically to SUDrya. The yogi balances alternately on one foot with the other leg raised and bent horizontally, the arms raised above the head with the hands joined, the eyes turned up towards the Sun, this is the classical pose of the sauras (64). It is clear that in this ritual usage the 'solar' meaning prevails, with a reference to the Tree of the World as Pddapa as well (65). Let us come back for a moment to the Adam's Peak at Sri Lanka-. The footprint, interpreted as Siva's by the Hindus and as Buddha's by the Buddhists, has had a further, Islamic, interpretation as the footprint of Adam, whence the name 'Adam's Peak' given to this height, which is also called Mount Sarandib, '... one of the highest in the world' according to the historian Ibn Battuta. And the Islamic version is the one that gives us the most interesting details. In fact it is said that Adam left that footprint while (63) Sedlmayr (1958: 86) says that the phenomenon of standing, which reveals itself both in the human body and in the so human experience of the 'column' has also a moral and spiritual counterpart. 'The simple erect standing posture (i.e. the ordinary vertical stance of man) can assume cosmic propor tions' (Vatsyayan 1983: 55). But, as Bosch points out (1960: 207), an objection to the symbolic assimila tion man-column is 'the fact that the lowest part of the human body, the continuation of the trunk downward, is bifurcate by nature'. (64) Aristobulus, a historian in Alexander the great's retinue in India, was perhaps the first to de scribe this yogic position exactly. On the other hand, these ascetic practices do not seem to have been exclusive to the Indian world, if for example we consider the following passage from the Mabinogion: 'Sol could stand all day on one foot' ('How Culhwch Won Ciwen', in Gantz 1979: 145). (65) The fullest modern description of this rite is the one given by Oman (1905: 231-33). See also Bosch 1960: 210. [23J 269</page><page sequence="24">he was standing on one leg as a penance to expiate his expulsion from Paradise: 'The blessed Footprint, the Foot of our father Adam, is on a lofty black rock in a wide plateau. The blessed Foot sank into the rock far enough to leave its impression hollowed out. It is eleven spans long. In ancient days the Chinese came here and cut out of the rock the mark of the great toe and the adjoining parts [...]' (66). As far as we know there is no evidence of similar practices of penitence being carried out normally in Islam, whereas we have been able to see that there are plenty of examples in Hinduism. Coming back to what we said earlier about the essentially 'axial' meaning of one footedness, and therefore about its close connection with the symbolism of the column, it is important to call to mind here that 'References to the presence of Siva on columnar altars are to be found in the earlier sections of the Mahdbharata' (Banerjea 1974: 462) (67). This type of Saiva image was formerly supposed to have been 'a combination of the god's human as well as his columnar form' (ibid.: 462), called precisely sthdnu, 'column', which, of course, brings us back to the sthanu-vrata (68). From a strictly iconographical viewpoint there are two quite distinct traditions, the iva Ekapdda Murti in the strict sense of the word, certainly the earlier one (figs. 8-11), and the Siva Ekapdda Trimuirti (figs. 12-14), The first is originally a variant of the 'terrific' (Bhairava) form of Siva, which is also marked by the bare leg and the erect phallus. The terrific and ithyphallic characteristics tend to disappear in the images from southern India (see fig. 11), where, amongst other things, the leg is always 'clothed'. Images of Siva Ekapada are found, as parsvadevatds, in the external lateral niches of the earliest Saiva temples in Orissa (from the 8th century onwards). Normally they are placed on the north side of the temple, but from the 9th century they also appear on the eastern and southern sides (69). Beginning with the 13th century these images become increasingly rarer. Generally Siva Ekapdda is represented with two or four arms, according to the dimensions of the mzirti. The facial expression denotes it as a variant of the bhairavic aspect of Siva (70). In only a few cases the lower limb (66) Ibn Batttita 1929: 259. Cf. section V, devoted to Adam, of the Qi9a9u-Z-Anbiyd of Ath-Thalabi, better known by the name of Ardisu-1-Majdlis. According to Gabrieli (Ibn Battuta 1961: 289) the Moslems followed here a legend whose origin was probably Christian-Gnostic. (67) In particular Mahdbharata X 7, 13-14 speaks of 'a huge golden altar with all-spreading flames of fire on it'. (68) If Sthanu was also a name of Siva, sthdnubhita, 'he who has become a pillar' or 'he whose essence is a pillar' was called the sddhu 'who has made the vow that for months, or even years, on end he will assume the posture of an immovable pillar' (Bosch 1960: 187), thus reaching the point of identifying himself with the Deva. (69) In this connection Donaldson (1982: 159) observes that 'The south is the direction governed by Yama, the god of death and sovereign of the infernal regions'. (70) Interesting information is given by Donaldson (1982: 159), according to whom 'the pillarlike 270 [241</page><page sequence="25">Fig. 8 - Siva Ekapada in the Someivara temple. Fig. 9 - Siva Ekapada in the Chaunsat Yogini pit ha Mukhalifigam. 10th century. Hirlipur, 11th century (from Mookerjee 1971 pl. 30). seems to resemble, perhaps intentionally, an elephant's leg (cf. figs. 11 and 13) rather than a human one. In the images from the North the Tantric connotations are decidedly noticeable, and thus a serpent sometimes takes the place of the mrga in the upper left hand, and once again a serpent replaces the sacred thread (fig. 8). An interesting feature in some cases is the presence of a corpse underneath the Deva (fig. 10), as can clearly be seen in some of the examples reproduced by Donaldson (1982: figs. 15-16). Alarming figures of vultures or jackals (like the ones here in fig. 10 at the bottom, to the right of the body) sometimes form a frame for this gruesome iconographical element. According to Donaldson, 'the corpse added beneath the god's foot, suggest the idea of human sacrifice, a major feature of many of the Tantric rituals' (ibid.: 158). But we cannot rule out the possibility that the body also signifies Siva-Sava, in reference to the Vedic myth of. the sacrifice of the mahapurusa, one pada of which makes up the Triple World. form of Ekapada may have been favoured because of its resemblance to pillar deities worshipped by tribal peoples throughout Orissa. [...] On a symbolic level, the adoption of the ithyphallic pillar form of Ekapada may have been influenced by the Paupata practice of setting up lihgas to represent their dead teachers'.

Schwarz 1980: fig. 304). In the iva Ekapada Trimzirti, which is traditionally classified as the sixth of the eight Vidyes'varas (cf. Rao 1914-1916: voi. II, part II, 396 ff.), Siva still appears as one-footed but he is no longer ithyphallic, and, most important, he no longer has a terrific attitude. This type of Trimzirti is frequently found in the Sivaitic temples of eastern and southern India, with a great many variations. It is prescribed that Brahma should spring from the right side of Siva and Visnu from the left, both carved in the proportional measurements (talamana) customarily used for female deities almost as though the two Devas were no more here than Siva's 'Saktis'! Just below there protrude the two detached, sharply bent legs of the subordinate members of the Trima~rti, one for each Deva (cf. Agni Tripada). Now this representation closely recalls that of Siva' s flaming lihgam, whose infinite length was explored by Brahma and Visn~u. In that case Aiva appears as a lihgam alone, whereas here Siva himself, as Ekapitda, is assimilable to a liizgam (71). In both cases he is essentially a 'Pillar of Fire', with one-footedness and liizoam, if they are co-present, reciprocally exalting their axial significance. (71) As Sastri (1974: 97): 'Perhaps, images called Ekapadamarti or Ekapada Trimi-rti: [...1 are either 272 [261</page><page sequence="27">Fig. 12 - Siva Ekapada Trimiirti.

There is here perhaps a more conscious symbolic integration with the muirti of the exploration of the Lid~gam and with another type of Trimuirti where 'Brahma and Vishnu may be sculptured as issuing from either side of a large lidga' (Rao 1914-1916: vol. II, part II, 399), which confirms the close relationship between the Mahdlioam theme and the Fkapada one. We might add developments of Lingodbhava wherein the superiority of Siva over the two other members of the Hindu Triad was established, or an invention of the Indian sculptor in which is symbolized the underlying unity of the three gods'. 274 [281</page><page sequence="29">that the scheme of this mirti immediately recalls the vajra one, which we have seen is connected with one of the meanings of Aja Ekapada, and 'Vajra is one of the eight names of Siva' (Kausitaki Brdhmana, VI 9). As Coomaraswamy (1935: 15) says, 'Further as to the shape of the vajra, Aitareya Brahmana, II, 35, tell us that it was narrow at the beginning, and divided above like a club or axe, comparison being made with the bifurcartion of human legs'. When the respective vahanas of three Devas are represented (see fig. 12) (72), two of them, the Bull and the Swan, belong to the above-quoted examples of one-footed theriomorphic beings (73). Various authors, including Banerjea, maintain that there is a 'Vaisnava counterpart' of this representation, that is, an iconographical tradition of the Visnu Ekapada Trimirti as well: 'Accordingly, we sometimes find Vishnu occupying the central place' (Sastri 1974: 97, fn. 2). In actual fact we have not succeeded so far in finding any certain example of this. Devi Ekapddl A divine figure of the Hindu pantheon is never conceived of without his corresponding akti. And from this point of view we have ascertained that the Ekapada is no exception. In actual fact, apart from the one-footed Cow, there is no explicit evidence of any Ekapddi known to us in Sanskrit literature. However we cannot rule out the possibility that it could emerge from a really systematic analysis of the texts, in particular the tantric ones. As often happens, artists have directly made up for this theological 'gap'. We present here two examples of Ekapadi. The first appears in a Buddhist wall-painting in the Monastery of Namchy, in Sikkim, dating to the first half of the 19th century. It is of Ekajata or Ekajati, an emanation of Aksobhya (cf. Schwarz 1983: ill. 258) (see fig. 15). In spite of the poor quality of the illustration, we can clearly make out a sort of usnisa, the frontal eye, a single upper tooth, a single breast in the middle of the chest and the one foot. The whole figure appears to balance even more precariously owing to the fact that this foot is standing on the heel only. In reality, the texts do not prescribe one-footedness for this deity either. Literally Ekajati means (72) We may remark that the four legs of the Bull stand for the square of the earth, whereas Siva's leg placed on the humped back of the Nandin (the equivalent of Meru) is the axis of dharma. (73) It is also interesting to note, with regard to what has been said earlier, that the Sanskrit dictionaries give us a secondary meaning of Dhruva: 'An epithet of Brahma, of Visnu, of Siva' (V.S. Apte, Sanskrit-English Dictionary, vol. II, Poona 1958). [291 275</page><page sequence="30">'she who has but one chignon' (74). It is interesting to note that the foot is clearly a left foot, i.e. of the side that is traditionally thought of as female. With regard to Siva Ekapada, with few exceptions, the foot represented is usually the right one. The impressions of the two feet, the right male one and the left female one, white and red respectively, appear together, as left by Ardhanarivara, in some Nepalese yantras (cf. for example, Mookerjee 1982: 24, pl. I). In the second example (fig. 16), a purely Hindu one, we see, in a Pahari miniature, another unique Ekapadi with fifteen arms, dishevelled and half-naked. The names inside the circles that she either holds or points to with her several hands, are the names of States or Sovereigns for whom the members of a family of artists, the Nainsukhs, worked (11). The wrinkled forehead, the Medusa-like eyes and the open mouth that threateningly reveals the teeth, show that it is unequivocally a Bhairavi, a terrific form of Devi and therefore a perfect attendant of Siva Ekapada (76), from whom she differs not only in sex, but also in the greater dynamism that is peculiar to her nature, artistically expressed by the marked flexion of the torso. One-footedness as Instability The Chandogya Upanisad (IV 16, 3) says: 'As he who walks with only one foot or a cart that runs on only one wheel is defective [...1'. Therefore being one-footed can, in the Indian tradition, also have an entirely negative meaning, according to the law of polarity of symbols. We must not forget that ekapdda in Sanskrit can also mean 'incomplete'. In particular, some 'races' of intermediary beings that are described in the epics or the Purdnas appear as 'one-footed', but these are also present in the folklore of only partly Hinduized peoples like the Santals, where the disfigured appearance and the fact that they are manifest as mobs is a sign of a fragmentary and composite nature (part human and part animal, like the Vydlas), which connotes them (74) This epithet belongs to various female deities of Vairaydna Buddhism, that are distinguished by different shapes and colours (cf. de Mallmann 1975: 161). Probably the Ekajati we reproduce here is the Ugratara Ekajata, 'redoutable Tara au chignon unique', since 'elle est figuree avec un oeil unique, frontal et vertical', and, as in our wall-painting, has a 'couleur brune' (ibid.: 163, fn. 11). (75) Goswamy (1972: 131) writes: 'The document has something of the character of an aide-memoire in which the activity of generations of artists is condensed and recorded. Slowly we realize that there is distinct logic in the number of spider-like arms which emanate from this great and awesome tantric deity: it was the patrons who helped her weave her web of painting across the hills'. (76) As proof of the importance that the theme of divine one-footedness had in certain sectors of Tantrism. 276 [301</page><page sequence="31">*.e. Fig. 16 - Devi Ekapidi. Pahari Miniature, 18th-19th century. Collection of Shri B.P. Raina and Shri Chandu Lal Raina (from Goswamy 1972: pl.

In the Mahdbhdrata (section L of the Sabhd Parva), amongst the tributary peoples of Yudhisthira that come to pay tribute to him on the occasion of his rjasuya, there (77) The fact that for Hinduism uncivilized peoples assumed a monstrous aspect is no more than a consequence, an adaptation of the theory of the Dvipas and their alternate manifestation corresponding to the different Manvantaras, the past human races that have passed on the subtle domain. In the literature intended for ksatriyas the past human races are identified with contemporary foreign races, in the same way as the diachronic succession of the Dvipas is understood as being a simultaneous unfolding of different continents. Jean Przyluski (1932-33) is without a doubt the author who has more developed these psychic and demonic meanings of one-footedness, and made a comparative study of them, especially in the sphere of Far-Eastern tradition, though in this way he loses sight of its superior significance. [311 277</page><page sequence="32">is also a picturesque description of a race of one-footed people: 'And many tribes coming from different regions, of whom some possess two eyes, some three and some had eyes on their foreheads, [...] some cannibals and many possessing only one leg'. They bring gifts of gold and many-coloured horses (11). The strange association of one footed men with horses is also found in the superstitions of a Munda tribe, the Santals. The demons that they fear include the Ekagudias or Ghormuhas, which 'have heads like horses and bodies and arms like men and their legs are shaped like men's but they have only one leg each, and they eat human beings' (Bompas 1909: 132). The 'subtle' nature of these cannibalistic monsters is sometimes expressed more explicitly when they are described as having 'only one leg and a head (or just the mouth)' (Datta Majumder 1956: 48). It is quite likely that these debased and negative forms of ekapddas are the origin of Western superstition about an Indian people of Monocoli or EXt1robS, which are described in particular by Pliny the Elder: 'he also describes a tribe of men called the Monocoli who have only one leg, and who move in jumps with surprising speed; the same are called the Umbrella-foot tribe, because in the hotter weather they lie on their backs on the ground and protect themselves with the shadow of their feet' (Pliny, Naturalis Historia, VII 23). We may remark that if, on the one hand, the characteristic jumping gait is still a sign of the psychical nature of these beings, or of the discontinuous way in which they manifest themselves, on the other hand it is also a 'superstition' of one of the 'superior' meanings of this symbol, namely the thunderbolt (79). It is legitimate to speak of a total inversion of the symbol if we consider that from the original meaning of 'shining ray' which the one leg had in the case of the Hindu ekapdda, the Exto 17oVS, as the name itself shows, uses his one foot to shade himself from the sun, in a position which is the exact reverse. The ancient meaning of the symbol is literally 'obscured' here (80). One-footedness as 'Pathosformel' In what sense can we speak of Hindu Pathosformel in connection with one footedness? In at least three senses in our opinion. First, the most abstract one, the (78) The Purinas give different geographical locations of this people (cf. e.g. Kirfel 1967: 156). (79) We have already mentioned the Ddnavas, a sort of leaping demons, in note. For an interesting comparison with the Taoist demon of Indo-China, D6c Cu0c, see Przyluski 1932-33: 314. Przyluski (ibid:. 312 ff.) also mentions a Chinese one-footed drum that, on account of its purpose, can be connected with thunder. (80) And this meaning remains equally obscure to many present-day scholars. For example, according to Jacques Le Goff, (1977: 277), the one-footed who take shelter under their raised foot, like all the other 'monsters' that western ancient and mediaeval traditions located in India, is nothing but the transfert of the psychic complexes of primitive mentality to the level of geography and civilisation. It is a dream of abundance and extravagance, of disconcerting juxtapositions and confusions created by a poor and limited world... 278 [321</page><page sequence="33">position on a single foot, owing to a congenital situation in divinis, is a sign of the greatest possible equilibrium and stability, in addition to the sense of being able to act as a fixed, immobile pivot to a whole surrounding Cosmos, and there cannot be more than one pivot around which something turns. In an opposite sense, which is foreseeable if we take into account the law of polarity of symbols, the one leg as a result of mutilation or congenital malformation is a sign of a painful situation of privation that means outward and inward unbalance. This is so in the case of the Bull of dharma, and it is so for the monstrous one-footed people of the epics and the Puranas, who are obliged to proceed in leaps and bounds, in a discontinuous, discordant fashion. The third sense is half way between the other two previous ones. It is no longer a case of there being either naturally or accidentally only one leg, but of a one-footed position deliberately assumed by man (the literal meaning of vrata is 'will'), a position which is essentially a codified ritual gesture (sthanu-vrata) but also the expression of an emotion (rasa, bhava) within the man himself. It denotes the voluntary assumption of a penitential state or, more commonly, that of expiating a sin (which is always internal unbalance) or of an ascetic exercise (vrksasana) in view of obtaining spiritual fulfilment. In its expiatory sense the position of instability assumed is the bodily reflection of inner perturbation. In the ascetic sense it is the desire to overcome all human instability in view of the attainment of a superhuman state of the utmost, perfect equilibrium, to an extent that we could no longer say whether it is the sddhaka that imitates the attitude of Siva Ekapa-da, or whether it is Siva Ekapdda Muirti who is the hypostasis of an expression that is typically and absolutely human, where the strain and the suffering of a position that espresses the congenital unbalance of every life are resolved by means of a conscious and explicit assumption of them into a superior equilibrium.
