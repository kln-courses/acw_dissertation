<plain_text><page sequence="1">Another Source for Shelley's "Destroyer and Preserver" THE OPENING section of"Ode to the West Wind" concludes with the following well-known couplet: "Wild Spirit, which art moving everywhere; / Destroyer and Preserver; hear, O hear!" In their invaluable edition Donald H. Reiman and Sharon B. Powers supply the following annotation to the phrase "Destroyer and Preserver": "These titles come directly from the titles of the Hindu gods Siva the Destroyer and Vishnu the Preserver, known to Shelley from both the trans- lations and writings of Sir William Jones and Edward Moor's Hindu Pantheon (181 o)."' The note's pertinence is clear, but another source is nearer to hand. As M. H. Abrams and others have observed, Shelley's rejection of Christianity did not prevent him from acquiring a rich knowledge of the Bible and the Christian tradition.2 In this case, it is the Anglican Book of Common Prayer to which Shelley is ironically alluding. After the delivery of the ring in "The Form of Solemniza- tion of Matrimony," in words that have remained unchanged from 1662 through Shelley's time to the present, the priest prays as follows: "O Eternal God, I. Shelley's Poetry and Prose (New York: Norton, 1977), P. 22 I, note 6. Various religious analogues are adduced by Coleman O. Parsons, who finds that the poem avoids "obvious Judaeo-Christian terminology": "Shelley's Prayer to the West Wind," Keats-Shelley Journal, I I (1962), 31-37. 2.

"3 As is often the case-indeed, as is true of "Ode to the West Wind" considered as a prayer- Shel- ley adapts Christian sources to suit his own ends. Here the West Wind is apos- trophized as a force at once destructive and creative, in striking contrast to the purely benevolent God invoked by the Anglican priest. The allusion is ironic because Shelley is as far from Christianity as the "Ode to the West Wind" is from The Book of Common Prayer. A similar irony occurs in the fourth stanza of "Hymn to Intellectual Beauty," where "Love, Hope, and Self-esteem" replaces "faith, hope, and charity."4 Both allusions are deliberately blasphemous, since they audaciously undermine their sources. For Shelley, the "Wild Spirit... moving everywhere" is neither anthropomorphic nor evidently benevolent. Because Christianity thinks otherwise, it is but a "partial apprehen- sion of the agencies of the invisible world,"5 to use the language of A Defence of Poetry. Shelley undermines the Christian apprehension of nature by showing its partiality, which inheres in its failure to recognize that the spirit that orders and preserves nature is as much a "destroyer" as a "creator." Such an idea may be closer to Hindu than to Christian thought, but an awareness of Shelley's Anglican source reminds us that Shelley's point of departure is often the Chris- tian tradition that provides the best measure of his difference.

It was at the wedding of fellow Romanticist J. Douglas Kneale that David Clark and I were struck by this allusion. Since then, Jennifer MacArthur has informed me that the phrase "Creator and Preserver" also occurs in the "Prayer for all Conditions of men" in the "Morning Prayer." 4.
