<plain_text><page sequence="1">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON AND THE ESOTERIC CHARACTER OF THE GUIDE OF THE PERPLEXED by AVIEZER RAVITZKY I Samuel ben Judah Ibn Tibbon, translator of the Guide of the Perplexed and of other treatises of Maimonides,' is in many ways also the first inter- preter of Maimonides' philosophic teaching. The orientation of his interpre- tation of Maimonides' philosophy is already seen in his early writings2- epistles, critical notes appended to his translations of the Guide, a philoso- phic glossary and the introductions to his translations. His interpretation was extensively developed, however, in his later and more comprehensive 1. Ibn Tibbon translated the Guide of the Perplexed, Maimonides' introductions to Pereq .Heleq and to 'Avot, Maimonides' Commentary on 'Avot, the Epistle to Yemen and probably also the Epistle on Resurrection (cf. D. Z. Baneth, "Judah Albarizi and the Chain of Transla- tions of the Epistle on Resurrection" [Hebrew], Tarbiz 11 [1940]: 260-70, and the literature mentioned therein). The translation of Maimonides' epistle to Joseph ben Judah attributed to Ibn Tibbon is very doubtful. (See Baneth's introduction to his edition of the epistles of Mai- monides [Jerusalem, 1946], p. 47.) Ibn Tibbon also translated Aristotle's Meteorology (based on Bitriq's Arabic version), as well as Averroes' Treatises on the Intellect. Other translations attributed to Ibn Tibbon are very doubtful. See Moritz Steinschneider, Catalogus... Bodleiana (Berlin, 1852), pp. 2481-94; idem, Die hebraeischen Uebersetzungen des Mittelalters (Berlin, 1893), index. 2. We shall comment below on Ibn Tibbon's independent writings when appropriate. 87</page><page sequence="2">88 AVIEZER RAVITZKY treatises-the Commentary on Ecclesiastes3 and Ma'amar yiqqavu ha- mayim.4 These treatises are explicitly devoted to philosophic exegesis of bib- lical verses, but are deeply impregnated with the proper interpretation of Maimonides' philosophy and with its problematics. Samuel Ibn Tibbon's writing had a decisive influence on Maimonidean thinkers throughout the thirteenth century, among whom may be numbered the authors of two comprehensive commentaries on the Guide, Moses ben Solomon of Salerno,5 and Zerahiah ben Shealtiel Hen.6 3. Hereafter: CE. The citations will refer to MS Parma 2182. I. Sonde attributed to Ibn Tib- bon a commentary on Proverbs, since he found in manuscript a comment by Ibn Tibbon on Proverbs as "a book we are about to elucidate." (See Isaiah Sonne, "Ibn Tibbon's Epistle to Maimonides" [Hebrew], Tarbiz 10 [1939]: 150.) However, the comment he found was taken from CE, where the discussion concerned some verses of Proverbs. S. Salfeld believed Ibn Tib- bon wrote a commentary to the Song of Songs, after having found in Moses Ibn Tibbon's com- mentary on the Song of Songs a comment about his father's exegesis of some verses of the book. (See Siegmund Salfeld, Das Hohelied Salomo's bei den juedischen Erklaerern des Mittelalters [Berlin, 1879], pp. 85-86.) Moses' comments, however, refer to some problems in the Song of Songs discussed by his father in CE. See fols. 1 lr, 25r, 50r, 76r, 94r, 123v-124r. See also A. S.

L. Bisseliches (Pressburg, 1837). While writing MYH, Ibn Tibbon began to write another book entitled Ner ha-hofes, which was to deal with the esoteric interpretation of various verses of the Torah. (See M YH, pp. 9, 14, 18, 24, 41, 59, 70, 92, 103, 114, 160, 175.) This book is not extant and we have no way of knowing whether the book went further than its first pages. The "Commentary on the Views of our Master Moses on the Account of Creation" (MS Bodl. Hunt. 46) is not in line with Samuel Ibn Tibbon's views on a number of matters. It is possible that it was written by his son, Moses. Renan's conjecture that Ibn Tibbon wrote a complete commentary on the Bible is not correct. See Ernest Renan, Les Ecrivains juifs francais du XIVe siecle (Paris 1869), p. 340. 5. This commentary exists only in manuscript. The following references will be to MS Munich 370. See G. B.

The following references will be to MS Cambridge Add. 1235. On Ibn Tibbon's influence on the commentaries of Moses of Salerno and Zerahiah Hen, see Aviezer Ravitzky, "The Possibility of Existence and its Accidentality in Thirteenth Century Maimonidean Interpretation" [Hebrew], Da'at 2-3 (1978-1979): 67-97; idem, "The Hypostasis of Divine Wisdom in Thirteenth Century Jewish Thought in Italy," Italia 4 (1981); idem, "The Thought of Zerahiah ben Isaac ben Shealtiel Hen and Mai- monidean-Tibbonian Philosophy in the Thirteenth Century" (Ph.D. diss., Hebrew University of Jerusalem, 1978). Ibn Tibbon was cited innumerable times in the commentary of Moses of Salerno, and he is the only Jewish philosopher with the exception of Maimonides who is men- tioned in the commentary of Zerahiah .Hen. Dr. M. S. Nehoray recently called my attention to "Solomon ben Judah Nasi and His Commentary on the Guide" (Ph.D. diss., Hebrew Univer- sity of Jerusalem, 1979) in which he also mentions only Ibn Tibbon and his son-in-law Anatoli. (See Nehoray, "Solomon Nasi," pp. 11, 16. The commentary was written in the fourteenth century.)</page><page sequence="3">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON AND THE GUIDE 89 Ibn Tibbon's treatises were composed prior to the great wave of contro- versy over the Maimonidean writings, which took place in the early thirties of the thirteenth century; yet his books evince the impact which the early waves of the anti-Maimonidean polemic already had.7 Ibn Tibbon's anoma- lous stand against the controversy over the teaching of Maimonides in the Jewish communities is worthy of note and is an appropriate beginning for our discussion. In the introduction to his Commentary on Ecclesiastes, Ibn Tibbon describes how the communities split into an anti-Maimonidean majority and a pro-Maimonidean minority, where "many of our generation" find what Maimonides said distasteful and only the chosen few-"one in a city, two in a family"-react positively to his teaching.8 However, in contradis- tinction to the usual approach of the pro-Maimonideans, who tried to deny or reject accusations that Maimonides held daring views with far-reaching implications from a religious point of view, Ibn Tibbon chooses to empha- size, even in this connection, that Maimonides' words indeed conceal a dar- ing and esoteric tendency. Ibn Tibbon even declares that the few who defend Maimonides' teaching do so because they do not fully understand its true intentions. Had they truly understood the hidden teaching of Maimonides, they would for the most part have also joined the camp of those who deride him: For I have seen what they have done with the light which the true sage, the great rabbi, our master and teacher, Moses, servant of the Lord, had dis- seminated to those who are righteous when he spoke of the way of true wis- dom in his Book of Knowledge and in his Commentary on the Mishnah-Pereq .Heleq and 'A vot-as well as in his exalted treatise the Guide of the Perplexed. Many of our generation despised what he said in these treatises, and some of them spoke about them and called their light darkness. Those whom the Lord 7. The scholars of Lunel who were close to Ibn Tibbon were already involved in 1203 in the controversy of Meir ben Todros Halevi Abulafia. Meir Abulafia's first epistle attacking Mai- monides was addressed to Jonathan ha-Kohen of Lunel and to Aaron ben Meshullam. (See Kitab al-rasc'il [Paris, 1871; reprint ed., Jerusalem, 1967], pp. 13-40). Aaron ben Meshullam was the person referred to in the will of Samuel Ibn Tibbon's father as one "in whose love and wisdom you [Samuel] should have confidence." See Derekh tovim, ed. Hirsch Edelman (Lon- don, 1852), p. 6. 8. This description of a social schism does not conform with the assertion that prior to the polemic of R. Solomon ben Abraham of Montpellier only a few opposed Maimonides. Cf. Joseph Sarachek, Faith and Reason (Williamsport, Pa., 1935; reprint ed., New York, 1970), p. 71.</page><page sequence="4">90 AVIEZER RAVITZKY graced with a little wisdom and who opened their eyes a little to those words [of Maimonides], who are but one in a city and two in a family, approve of what he said. Yet that happened-by the living God-only after they bent [his words] to some extent to conform with their wishes and with the opinions which had been instilled in their hearts, those in which they believed while growing up. They partly transform what [Maimonides] said so that his words become tolerable to them. Had they, however, fully understood the profound intention of the Master they would have undoubtedly acted just as their [anti- Maimonidean] colleagues mentioned above, and only a very few would have remained [Maimonidean]. You know that the Master spoke about matters which are secrets of the Torah only by way of allusion and, [in summary fashion], by the transmission of chapter headings.9 This uncompromising stand, which does not affect graciousness even for rhetorical purposes and does not expect to gain the support of an audience which has not grasped the esoteric teaching of the Guide, was taken by Ibn Tibbon before the events which led from excommunication to public burn- ing of Maimonides' philosophic writings. But Ibn Tibbon was not unaware of the danger of attack and criticism which could bring about the suppres- sion of a book. He himself was warned by a colleague to take care that this did not happen to his writings, and, indeed, he explicitly states his apprehen- sion that the Commentary on Ecclesiastes might be suppressed,'0 were it to be perceived by readers "as contradicting the set opinions to which they have grown accustomed, and this would make them enraged and infuri- ated." I At any rate, Ibn Tibbon considered himself as almost unique among the Jewish community in his esoteric reading of the Guide of the Perplexed, and he directed his words at those few men 2 of reflection who "know that 9.

Contemporaries of Ibn Tibbon, too, connected his personality with the secrets of the Guide. This can already be seen in the writings of central figures in the Maimonidean controversy shortly after Ibn Tibbon's death. When David Qimbi, the grammarian and exegete, wished to have a scholar- ly discourse about problems and doubts raised by the Guide, problems and doubts which should be dealt with only in oral and not written communica- tion, he complains that "since our brother, the great sage Samuel Ibn Tib- bon, has been gathered to join his ancestors, I have found no one to talk about [my problems and doubts]."'3 Abraham Maimuni, the son of Mai- monides, testifies, while defending his father, that Maimonides considered Ibn Tibbon a sage who understood the secrets of his teaching: "Toward the end of his life, he received the epistles of the Father of the Translators, the sage theologian, the distinguished Samuel son of the distinguished Judah Ibn Tibbon.... Indeed he was a great and respected sage of great under- standing; my righteous father and master.. . told me that [Ibn Tibbon] reached all the way to the depths of the secrets of the treatise Guide of the Perplexed as well as the rest of [Maimonides'] writings, and understood his [or: its] intention."'4 We shall later note which of Samuel Ibn Tibbon's views were already evident while Maimonides was still alive. At any rate, Ibn Tibbon was thought of by Abraham Maimuni, too, in connection with the question of "the secrets of the Guide." And in the other camp, Solomon of Montpellier, leader of the anti-Maimonideans, attacked Ibn Tibbon for his allegorical interpretation of Scripture" and described him as one who reveals in public secrets concealed by Maimonides.'6 A few years later there 13. o n nu i )m n '3Y %)n 'r f 1'1n Tnp r nvj n v 'i u-r Pnn Iw'nx r'rx LK lox) ivxK nyt; David Kimbi's letter to Judah Alfakhar, in Qoves teshuvot Ha-Rambam ve-'iggerotav (Leipzig, 1859; reprint ed., Jerusalem, 1967), pt. 3, pp. 3b-4a.

He intended to say . . . that the Master [Maimonides] deceives with his words which are faithful to the Torah, and that his assertions are directed to the multitude."" Here, Ibn Tibbon is not represented as one who reveals what Maimonides conceals but one who invents hidden intentions "to say about clear words ... which fortify religion and faith [i.e., Maimonides' words], that they were only used to mislead the multitude, but were not truly believed by him."'" Thus we see that Samuel Ibn Tibbon was perceived by himself as well as by his contem- poraries, admirers as well as detractors, not only as the translator of Maimonides, but also as a spokesman par excellence for an esoteric interpretation of the text.19 What is the nature of this interpretation? How did Ibn Tibbon view him- self as distinct from his contemporaries in understanding the intention of Maimonides' teaching? We are concerned here with the first appearance of a question which was to be discussed throughout the Middle Ages, and which constantly appears in modern scholarship devoted to medieval Jewish philosophy.20 The problem of esotericism and exotericism in the Guide of the Perplexed arises of course with Maimonides' own pronouncements about lator who has revealed all that the Master had concealed that he used to say in public about our Torah that all its stories are allegories as well as all the commandments which are customary, and I have heard a vast number of things like that, people ridiculing the words of our rabbis."

Moses of Salerno, Commentary on the Guide, fol. 269v; Zerahiah Hen, Commentary on the Guide, 1:6. 20.

That opened the way for a variety of interpreta- tions. One interpreter would assert that Maimonides' declaration about concealment should be the primary, almost exclusive, key for the profound understanding of the Guide, chapter and verse. Another interpreter would see it only as one of the tools to be used in connection with some of the issues covered by the Guide. The first perceives Maimonides' esotericism to be all inclusive, penetrating to the roots of his teachings, its theological foundations not excluded. The second limits Maimonides' esoteric layer to some specific, but not necessarily central, issues. Those who upheld a radical interpretation of the secrets of the Guide, from Joseph Caspi and Moses Narboni in the fourteenth century to Leo Strauss and Shlomo Pines in the twentieth, proposed and developed tools and methods for the decoding of the concealed intentions of the Guide. Can we already find the roots of this approach in the writings of Samuel Ibn Tibbon, a few years after the writing of the Guide? The assertion that in the thirteenth century-especially in the first half-the Guide was studied "unprofessionally," and that only in the fourteenth century was there systematic study of the Guide21 does not stand up under examination of the writing of Samuel Ibn Tibbon, his son-in-law Jacob Anatoli and his son Moses Ibn Tibbon, not to speak of the systematic commentaries composed in the second half of the thirteenth century. However, does the attempt to propose a systematic and precise method for the decoding of Maimonides' far-reaching intentions already appear in the writings of the first translator and interpreter of Maimonides, one whose writings were clearly influential in the generations which followed? Ibn Tibbon taught that "wise men ... assert something novel which is not in harmony with the belief of the many when their reflections warrant it, and when the belief of the many is beneficial and greatly needed for the stability 21. Cf., e.g., D. J. Silver, Maimonidean Criticism and the Maimonidean Controversy (Leiden, 1965), p. 34. Generally speaking, the interpretation and work of the Maimonidean scholars of the thirteenth century have not yet gained appropriate scholarly attention. Commentaries on the Guide from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries are the ones which were printed (the only thirteenth century commentary to be printed was that of Shem Tov Falaquera) and discussed in Maimonidean scholarship, whereas earlier Maimonidean thought has been treated by modern scholarship only in the context of the controversy regarding the writings of Maimonides and philosophy in general. This polemical literature by nature is not concerned with serious textual analysis or profound discussion of philosophical problems.</page><page sequence="8">94 AVIEZER RAVITZKY of the world and for the political order, they will assert their novel teaching in a way which the vulgar will not grasp, but will try as much as they can to conceal it by using riddles, parables and hints, so that only the wise may understand."22 We propose to examine how this approach of Ibn Tibbon is reflected in his study of the Guide.23 The history of the written interpretation of the Guide of the Perplexed begins with an epistle concerning Divine Providence addressed by Ibn Tib- bon to Maimonides in 1199.24 In this epistle the translator asks about cer- tain contradictions which appear in the Guide's discussion of this problem, and proposes an out and out Aristotelian interpretation of Maimonides' teaching about "Providence which is consequent upon the intellect" (Guide 3:17). There are two distinct strata in this interpretation. In the first stratum, Divine Providence is identified with the supreme human intellectual attain- ment, the intellection of God, a degree of intellectual attainment which is essentially connected with the disregard of material afflictions which becomes irrelevant for the intellecting person.25 Divine Providence over the perfect human being is not reflected in external occurrences, but in the nega- tion of the significance of these occurrences on account of "[man's] ultimate perfection and his consequent immortality."26 In a second stratum, Provi- dence is treated through the perspective of the Divine Will as reflected in nature, both of the universe and of man. Every natural event is ultimately related to the Supreme Will which brings into being nature's laws.27 Cor- 23. The relationship between this position and the writings of Al-Fardbi, and even more so those of Averroes, call for a separate treatment. See below, n. 106. Here we are concerned with the way it is reflected in the interpretation of the Guide. 24. This epistle has been published. See Zvi Diesendruck, "Samuel and Moses Ibn Tibbon on Maimonides' Theory of Providence," Hebrew Union College Annual 11 (1936): 341-66. 25. Cf. CE, fol. 57r. 26. Cf. MYH, p. 41: "And one of the separated intellects [the active intellect] ... will purify his intellect from its impurity, which is ignorance and error, and will make him attain perfection to the greatest possible extent: That is the end of Divine Providence for the human species."

For the purposes of this paper, we are concerned with the methodology of the interpretation of the text and with the assumptions underlying it in regard to the Guide's intentions. Samuel Ibn Tibbon constructed his interpretation from a detailed examination of various chapters of the Guide and called into question those passages which do not accord with this interpretation. He was especially concerned with certain things said in the Guide 3:51, from which it would appear that there is an external, miraculous Providence ("by way of sign and miracle") which protects the one who intellects in actu from catastrophe--as long as he does not cease to intellect his intellectum (only when "he aban- dons Him ... and is thus separated from God, does he become in conse- quence of this a target for every evil that may happen to befall him"). Ibn Tibbon paid specific attention to this passage because it contradicts both strata of his interpretation, but he noted further difficulties.28 Ibn Tibbon's comments which accompany his analysis reveal his general approach toward the nature of the contradictions in the Guide: The interpreter need not be troubled by contradictions when one assertion is consistent with the "philosophic view" whereas the other is completely satisfactory to "men of religion" (or "men of religion of our time").29 Such contradictions are to be expected, and the worthy reader will know the reason for them and the direction they tend to, and he will be able to distinguish between those "said truly" and those "said for purposes of concealment." The difficulty lies else- where, when the text appears to support a middle position between the philosophic view30 and the common religious view, a position which is con- sistent with neither of the two adversaries. For example: Ibn Tibbon will not be in any quandary when one Maimonidean passage appears to support belief in corporeal rewards for the righteous while another asserts the philo- 28. For example, a contradiction between a passage in the Guide 3: 17 and the Guide 2: 48 and chap. 8 of the Eight Chapters (see the edition of Diesendruck, p. 357). Maimonides distin- guished in the Guide 3: 17 between a natural disaster such as "the foundering of a ship . .. and the falling down of a roof, ... [which] are due to pure chance" and the human activity of going by ship, which occurs "by divine will." Ibn Tibbon rejected this distinction in his epistle relying on the Maimonidean text itself. 29. See Diesendruck, "Samuel and Moses Ibn Tibbon," pp. 358-61. 30. Maimonides advances his proposal for the solution of the problem of providence in the Guide 3: 51 as a solution which would satisfy the philosopher's doubts about the existence of providence over individuals.</page><page sequence="10">96 AVIEZER RAVITZKY sophic view according to which Divine Providence is equal to the level of intellectual attainment.3' When the text, however, appears to support a synthesis-external miraculous Providence over the intelligent (3:51)--a synthesis which combines one element of the common religious faith (exter- nal miraculous Providence) and one philosophic element (Providence as a function of intellectual attainment), the attentive reader is in a quandary. It is clear that this approach is in fact a universal method for the interpretation of the Guide, and is not limited to this question. Ibn Tibbon relates that he found in the Guide characteristic contradictions in regard to several sub- jects, contradictions between the consistent philosophic view and the tradi- tional view of the "men of religion," but he was always able to distinguish between what was said "truly" and what was said "in order to hide and to conceal"32 alone.33 The contradiction which appears in the Guide 3:51, 31.

But the amazing dis- cussion in 3: 51 cannot be properly attributed by me to either of these two categories: it does not seem to belong among those assertions establishing [true] opinions any way you look at it.

On concealment from "the men of religion," see also Zerahiah Hen, Commentary on Job in Israel Schwarz, Tiqvat 'enosh (Berlin, 1862; reprint ed., Jerusalem, 1969), pp. 177-78. See also MYH, p. 62: "He [the writer of the Psalms] as well as others used [the following method] in all secrets of the Torah and of faith, ...

See below concerning the continuity of esoteric writing from the Bible to the Guide. The great similarity between what is asserted in these citations and the views advanced by Leo Strauss in his interpretation of the Guide is self-evident. Cf. Leo Strauss, "The Literary Character of the Guide of the Perplexed," in Persecution and the Art of Writing (Glencoe, Ill., 1952), p. 73. 33.

It is not surprising that Moses Ibn Tibbon, son of Samuel, who in many cases did not follow in the footsteps of his father's Aristotelianism, also did not adopt the methodological approach underlying his father's interpreta- tion. Explicitly critical of Samuel Ibn Tibbon's way, Moses Ibn Tibbon sought to harmonize those passages of the Guide which treat Providence. According to Moses Ibn Tibbon, those passages which propose the philo- sophic view of Providence refer to a lower manifestation of Providence, whereas 3:51 describes its supreme, supraphilosophic, manifestation: "God's Providence over his worshippers and adherents in emanating toward their divine and prophetic wisdom."34 For the purpose of harmoni- zation, Moses Ibn Tibbon attempts to graft onto the words of Maimonides the views of Ibn Sina35 and Ibn Ezra36 about the perfect man's power to con- trol mentally external bodies and to fashion them at will. Samuel Ibn Tib- bon, on the other hand, constructed his interpretation on the basis of differ- ent premises as to the character of the Guide's text,37 and those premises do someone understand.") However, since a recent paper asserts that the Guide's commentators had a hard time finding a contradiction of this type, I note the following places: Ibn Caspi 1: 3; 1: 4; Efodi and Shem Tob, 1: 3; Moses of Salerno, fols. 9v, 123v; Michael ben Shabbethai Balbo, MS Vatican 105, fol. 127. Cf. also Shem Tob Falaquera, introduction (p. 10). The commen- taries on the Guide are cited here according to the following editions: Falaquera, Moreh ha- moreh, in Qadmonei mefareshei ha-Moreh (Vienna, 1852; reprint ed., Jerusalem, 1961); Ibn Caspi, Maskiyyot kesef, ibid.; Moses Narboni, Be'ur la-Moreh, ibid.; the commentaries of Efodi, Shem Tob ben Joseph, Asher Crescas and Isaac Abravanel were printed in the popular editions of the Guide in the translation of Ibn Tibbon. The commentaries of Moses of Salerno and Zerahiah Hen are cited according to the above mentioned MSS unless otherwise noted. 34. Cf. Diesendruck, "Samuel and Moses Ibn Tibbon," pp. 363-65. I believe that a more comprehensive study would make it possible to juxtapose the differences between father and son on a variety of issues as the first example of the continuing controversy about the proper interpretation of the Guide. Cf., e.g., Samuel Ibn Tibbon, MYH, p. 22 against Moses Ibn Tib- bon, Sefer Pe'ah, MS Bodl. Opp. 241, fol. 14r; Cf. on this also Moses of Salerno's comment on Samuel Ibn Tibbon in MS Bodl.

Cf. the commentary on Numbers 20:8, 22:28; the short commentary on Exodus 3:15. Different variations of this view were held by many Jewish thinkers. Some are noted by Colette Sirat, "Pirqei Mosheh of Moses Narboni," Tarbiz 39 (1970): 290-95. See also Moshe Idel, "On the influence of Sefer 'Or ha-sekhel on Moses Narboni and Abraham Shalom," AJSreview 4 (1979), Hebrew sec., p. 3; Falaquera on the Guide, 3: 51. 37. No wonder that an interpreter such as Moses Narboni preferred Samuel Ibn Tibbon's position to that of his son, who "did not understand the words of the Master at all, and did not know what made his father say this" (Narboni on the Guide 3: 11).</page><page sequence="12">98 AVIEZER RAVITZKY not allow for harmonization. He continued to wonder about these things more than twenty years later, when writing his Ma'amar yiqqavu ha- mayim:38 "As to 3:51, ... I have not understood his intention in that chapter, by God! Unless he said it so as to conceal his views even more ad captandum vulgi."39 The radical nature of the method of interpretation which first appears in the epistle on Providence may also be represented by the way Samuel Ibn Tibbon uses the other key provided by Maimonides to the reader of the Guide, his warning about his having scrambled the subjects he discussed in the Guide and scattered them among various chapters. In order to recon- struct Maimonides' position on any subject, the reader is called upon "to connect its chapters one with another" and to search meticulously for the proper context of comments whose subject matter does not fit their textual setting. Here, just as on the problem of intended contradictions, Samuel Ibn Tibbon evinces the beginning of the radical esoterical interpretation of the Guide. The comments found in this epistle regarding the Guide 3:23 may serve to exemplify his approach. In order to arrive at an adequate interpretation of Maimonides' theory of Providence, Ibn Tibbon compared dozens of scat- tered passages. Inter alia he made use of Maimonides' comments on the sig- nificance of the Book of Job. Maimonides distinguished between Job's early view, which denies Providence-as a result of the many catastrophes which befell him-and his later view, which Job adopted after he decided to reject the body and "admitted that true happiness, which is the knowledge of the Deity ... cannot be troubled ... by any or all the misfortunes."40 Job's earlier view, which denies individual Providence, was declared in the Guide 3:23 to be identical to Aristotle's view. But according to Ibn Tibbon's own conclusion, after connecting the chapters one to another, it is Job's latter view, the one confirmed by revelation and "divine testimony," that is identi- cal to Aristotle's teaching: 38. MYH was written after 1221.

Guide 3: 23.</page><page sequence="13">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON AND THE GUIDE 99 Having gotten to know the Creator truly, Job was no longer concerned with the various sorts of pseudohappiness ... having attained the knowledge of immortality .. . for indeed permanent happiness is the knowledge of God, and it seems to me that Aristotle agrees with this view; indeed so do most true philosophers, and certainly those among them who believe in immortality.... As far as I can see, the view of Job, subsequent to his having rejected [the body] and regretted [his earlier view], is identical to Aristotle's view ... and the purpose of God's testimony is to reject the views of Job's friends, or some- thing like it, and to give preference to Job's views. This, it seems to me, is what comes out of these chapters of the Guide. The best proof is what Maimonides says toward the end of 3:25.4' Ibn Tibbon's analysis is not hard to follow: Job prior to his change of attitude (A 1) and Job subsequent to this change (A2) do not represent differ- ent views about the existence of Providence over external concerns. The transformation of Job represents, rather, a change in his personal attitude to the afflictions of matter, toward external occurrences, following A2's becoming aware of "permanent happiness" and "immortality." But Ibn Tibbon knows-from other sources-that this awareness of the possibility of permanent intellectual happiness is shared also by many Aristotelians (see below). Thus, the view of A2 is identical to Aristotle's view, and this is the view preferred by God in his speech to Job. (Cf. Ibn Caspi: "Aristotle's views about this ... are identical to the view of our Torah as interpreted by the Guide.")42 Can we find in the Guide any hint to support this view? Ibn Tibbon believes we can: "The best proof is what Maimonides says toward the end of 3:25."

Further on Ibn Tibbon progresses from the discussion of the first level of providence-spiritual felicity and immortality- to the discussion of the other level, reflected in natural existence. He characterizes natural events as a result of "eternal Divine Will, not individually created." In MYH, Ibn Tibbon will distinguish between "the truth of Providence," which is the principal theme of Ecclesiastes and "the truth of immortality," which is the principal theme of Job (p. 70). 42. Maskiyyot kesef on Guide 3: 18. Cf. also Shem Tob on Guide 3: 18 (p. 27b); 3: 23 (p. 35a). Ibn Caspi makes Aristotle's view conform to that of the Guide. See also Falaquera against Ibn Tibbon's interpretation of this problem: "The harmonization of the Master's view ... and the philosophers' view, . . . the view of Aristotle ..., is the harmonization of two opposites."</page><page sequence="14">100 AVIEZER RAVITZKY ("actions"), attributes natural actions to Divine Wisdom and ends by say- ing: "It is upon this opinion that the whole of the Torah of Moses our Master is founded.... If you consider this opinion and the philosophic opinion, reflecting upon all the preceding chapters in this treatise that are connected with this notion, you will not find any difference between them regarding any of the particulars of everything that exists." Ibn Tibbon finds in this identification of the view of the Law and the view of philosophy43 a hint regarding the chapters dealing with Providence and its identification with natural law.44 That is to say, the true intention of the Torah regarding Providence is not at issue with the view of the philosophers, either about the identification of Providence with natural law, or about its identification with intellectual happiness and immortality, which are the two strata of Ibn Tib- bon's interpretation mentioned above. III The correspondence between philosophy and the Bible regarding eternal intellectual happiness subsequently becomes a central topic in Samuel Ibn Tibbon's writings and a pivotal point of his philosophical exegesis of the Bible.45 He follows Arabic philosophy when he identifies this question with the question of the possibility of conjunction with the Active Intellect, the lowest of the separate Intelligences according to medieval Aristotelian ontology. According to an Aristotelian principle, the intellector unites (is conjoined) with his intellectum, and becomes identical with it. Thus, if indeed man is able to intellect an eternal intellectual object such as the Active Intellect and to unite with it, immortality is possible. Ibn Tibbon's Commentary on Ecclesiastes shows that he was well aware of the controversy among the Arab Aristotelians regarding this question. He says: "Abu Nagr 43. A strictly esoteric reading of Ibn Tibbon himself could hint at the following contradic- tion: on the one hand, Maimonides presented Aristotle's view on Providence as "consequent upon his opinion concerning the eternity of the world" (Guide 3: 17); on the other hand, the passage in the Guide 3: 25 to which Ibn Tibbon points as confirming the identity between the view of the Torah and the view of philosophy in regard to Providence, ends as follows: "You will find no difference [between them] other than that which we have explained: namely, that they regard the world as eternal and we regard it as produced in time. Understand this." 44. A substantial portion of MYH is devoted to the development of some fundamental ideas referred to in his epistle on Providence. See MYH, pp. 61-121. 45. Another pivotal point would be a comparison between the Bible and philosophy on the problem of creation and nature.</page><page sequence="15">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON AND THE GUIDE 101 al-Farabi said that conjunction of the human soul with the Active Intellect is stuff and nonsense,46 but Averroes said about this utterance of Abu Nagr [al-Farabi] that it is not theoretical reflection which brought him to this conclusion. But since Al-Farabi himself was cognizant of the superiority of his wisdom, yet found that he did not attain this level of conjunction,47 he asserted that no human being can attain it."48 As we noted above, Ibn Tibbon's epistle of 1199 already mentions the view of "most true philo- sophers, and certainly those among them who believe in immortality."49 At any rate, in his Commentary on Ecclesiastes (written after 1213),50 we find indications of vigorous and detailed knowledge of Arabic philosophic texts dealing with the human soul and immortality, at least of two Averroistic treatises-Averroes' Long Commentary on the De Anima and his Treatises on the Intellect-treatises which were translated by Ibn Tibbon into Hebrew. In these works Averroes argues with Al-Farabi's rejection of the possibility of 46. Cf. Averroes, Essays on the Intellect, translated by Ibn Tibbon, ed. J. Hertz (Berlin, 1869), p. 10; see also Ibn Tufail, Hayy ben Yaqdhdn, Institut d'Etudes Orientales de la Faculte des Lettres d'Alger, vol. 3, trans. and ed. Leon Gauthier (Beirut, 1936), p. 14.

Alexander Altmann, "Ibn Bajja on Man's Ultimate Felicity," in Harry Austryn Wolfson Jubilee Volume, 3 vols. (Jerusalem, 1965), English sec., 1: 48-49. Samuel Ibn Tibbon attributed to Al-Farabi the view which denies the possibility of uniting with the active intellect, as this doctrine was presented and criticized by Averroes in his essays on the intellect, which Samuel Ibn Tibbon translated into Hebrew. Moses Ibn Tibbon attributed to Al-Farabi the opposite view, which asserts the possibility of uniting with the active intellect, a doctrine in Al-Farabi's book, The Principles of Beings (also called The Political Regimes), which Moses Ibn Tibbon apparently translated into Hebrew. See Moses Ibn Tibbon, Commentary on the Song of Songs (Lyck, 1874), p. 9. Cf. Al-Farabi, Sefer Hathalot ha-nimya'ot, ed. Zwi Filipowsky in Sefer ha-'Asif (Leipzig, 1849), pp. 2, 5.

Those who reject immortality do so as a result of their view that human nature does not admit of conjunction with the Active Intellect."54 It is in that context, too, that Ibn Tibbon perceived the pro- found real topic of Proverbs, of the Song of Songs, and of the secret of Adam in Genesis, all in accordance with allusions glossed from the Guide. This field of inquiry was to remain esoteric not only on account of the correspondence between philosophic problematics and biblical stories. The view according to which the grasp of the intelligibilia is the supreme end which brings about intellectual perfection and immortality, subsumes to this end all other religious tasks and vocations."5 This view limits immortality to the acquired intellect,56 and moreover points to a way open exclusively to the superior few, and denies to the many the possibility of attaining ultimate happiness.57 This view should be concealed from the many.

A few instances of Samuel Ibn Tib- bon's discussion of these topics may help to clarify the method which guides him in his esoteric reading of the Guide. The accounts of the creation of Adam and Eve, the tree of life and the tree of knowledge, the creation of man in the image of God, and so forth, are allegorically interpreted by Ibn Tibbon,58 who systematically follows the various chapters of the Guide. "Man" represents the formal-intellectual aspect of mankind and "woman" the material aspect,59 the origin of desire and annihilation. The creation of the first woman, and her being "taken out" of Adam represents man's vocation and power to exist as a pure intel- lect60 in actu who prevails upon his corporeality and potentiality, just as his recurring recourse to woman and to her temptations represents his decline into materiality. The secrets of the creation and generation in God's image6' and the eating of the fruit of the tree of life62 (Guide 1:42: "Correct opinions are called life")63 point to the vocation and end of man to conjoin with the supreme intelligibilia and to attain intellectual immortality. These ideas demand double concealment. This is so, first, because of the preferences of the allegorical level of meaning of the biblical story, the universal story of man qua man, over the historical one. (Cf. Ibn Caspi: "The Master hints at a certain concealment in the Account of Creation, for the man who is mentioned there is not one single individual, but the collective man";64 and Samuel Ibn Zarza: "So it 58.

Ibn Caspi not only interprets the story of Adam as the paradigmatic account of man, but explicitly hints that he denies the historical significance of the story. See 1: 14 and 2: 29: "The name 'Adam ha-rishon (the first man) is attributed according to the Guide's concealed view to Moses, for he was the first man who ever existed" (i.e., whose intellect became active). See also the editor's view there (1: 14) on Narboni's and Ibn Caspi's secret, and Abravanel's reaction to their "deceitful act" (ma'aseh ta'tu'im). So also for Samuel Ibn Zarza</page><page sequence="18">104 AVIEZER RAVITZKY seems that according to Ibn Tibbon ... the secret ... is as follows: The intellect was called Adam.")65 Second, these ideas contain hints as to the secret of "life" and "death"66 and thus about a philosophic transformation of the beliefs in the resurrec- tion of the dead and the world to come. (Cf. Zerahiah Hen: "The secret of the chapter yalad and the chapter bay [in the Guide] mentioned by the sage Samuel [Ibn Tibbon]. . . . It seems to me that the secret of the chapter bay is that the author [Maimonides], tried to show that the word 'dead' is attri- butable even to someone who is not dead .. and that 'life' is attributable to true opinions ... and he who understands will understand.")67 Third, the term "man" is the connecting axis between the two most esoteric topics in the Bible, "the Account of Creation" (Adam) and "the Account of the Chariot" (the likeness of man upon the throne).68 "Man" in its profound sense refers to any intellectual being in the lower as well as the heavenly realm.69 (This has of course important implications also in regard to the nature of the ideal of imitatio Dei and to the interpretation of the last chapter of the Guide.) (see n. 60), but this is not necessarily so in the case of Efodi on the Guide 1: 2 (pp. 2, 17), where he cites Ibn Caspi and adds: "Everything which happened to the first man happens to everyone in our own age many times over." See also Shem Tob, ibid., p. 16: "And it seems to us in every generation that everything that happened to the first man is the account of the history of man."

This is not so. Maimonides mentioned many biblical terms having to do with a secret of the secrets of the Torah or the secrets of faith,70 although there is no need to mention them in connection with God. The chapter on 'ish, yalad, bay and 'adam 71 are in this category.... Should anyone reveal the real intention of any of them, he would betray the oath of the Master who abjured anyone who would understand any novelty in his treatise not to reveal it.The intention of the chapters is the essence of what was innovated by him, or-you may say-all of what was innovated by him. Maimonides said explicitly that he scattered the topics [in the Guide] to separate topics which are of one kind so as to conceal their true intentions from the multitude. There is no doubt that anyone who reveals the intention of even one of them is a true trans- gressor.72 The species of man ... includes the masses and the superior few, ... for "man" is an equivocal term as was mentioned in the Guide 1:14. Although "man upright" [Eccl. 7:29] according to our interpretation ["man" as intellect which prevails over its material element]73 is not mentioned explicitly in that chapter, it seems that it is the first meaning of the three meanings of man [namely, Adam]. Understand this. The best demonstration for this is that before Eve was taken from man [Adam], his name was Man [Adam], and after she was taken away from him, the part that was left of him was also called man. .... For the true wise man [Maimonides] used the equivocity of the name "man" in many instances, and certainly in the chapter about the Account of 70. Cf. CE, fol. 6r; MYH, p. 62 and n. 106 below. 71.

The "intention of the chapters" is more or less completely devoted to secret teachings and is the "essence of what was innovated"77 by Maimonides. From the two para- graphs cited above, we may cull Ibn Tibbon's guidelines for decoding the aims of the Guide: 1. Among the many chapters in the first part of the Guide, which deal with anthropomorphic terms in the Bible, there are dispersed lexicographic chapters dealing with a different class of terms (such as the chapters dedicat- ed to 'ish, yalad, bay and 'adam).78 Ibn Tibbon's competitor as translator of the Guide, Judah Albarizi, ignored these deviations and understood all the chapters as having a single purpose-the negation of anthropomorphism (see "The Intention of the Chapters" which he appended to his transla- tion).79 Ibn Tibbon emphasizes, in his strong criticism of Alharizi,80 that the 74. The reference here is apparently to Guide 2: 30. Cf. CE, fols. 86v, 126v, 2r. See also Shem Tob on 2: 30 (p. 61b), 2: 46, 2: 29 (p. 55a). 75. This chapter in the Guide is devoted to the interpretation of ur in the Bible. Two possi- bilities for an esoteric interpretation of this chapter were proposed later to Ibn Tibbon: Zerahiah Hen identified sur with the first man "who is the beginning of mankind, from whom the human species was quarried; he was created in the image of God." (It may be that H.en and Ibn Tibbon find here an additional allusion for the allegorization of the first man as the quin- tessential intellectual element in man.) The second possibility is proposed by Ibn Caspi on 1: 17 (and cf. Introduction, p. 7). 76.

(Jerusalem, 1935-1959), wondered at this point: "Is this all that Maimonides innovated?" He was thus constrained to conclude that Ibn Tibbon is here referring to Albarizi rather than to Maimonides. However, Kaufman's approach to the Guide is very different from Ibn Tibbon's and Ibn Tibbon's explicit words fit well with his method of reading the Guide. They should consequently be understood as they stand. 78. Cf. Zerahiah Hen on 1: 14: "Many are perplexed saying, why did the author [Maimo- nides] point out the equivocity of the name 'adam [man], for it does not signify the creator ..., but his intention was to allude to a very important matter, which is implicit in what he says. It must not be explained. He who understands will understand it." 79. Albarizi interpreted the intention of these chapters by the general context of their loca- tion in the Guide-the negation of anthropomorphism. These four chapters refer in his opinion</page><page sequence="21">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON AND THE GUIDE 107 irregular chapters allude to a unique esoteric teaching, to an intention beyond the explicit content of the sequence of the chapters. The basic notion behind this method was developed in great detail (perhaps too great) by modern scholarship on the Guide. 2. The correct reading of the Guide's chapters should be carried out in two complementary directions: on the one hand, one should distinguish each chapter from the rest, and on the other, one should combine different chapters and construct out of them a single topic. Again, on the one hand, one should get to the bottom of the specific subject matter of each chapter, its specific "innovation,""' an innovation not necessarily limited to the explicit subject matter of the chapter ("Although ... it is not mentioned explicitly in that chapter."). On the other hand, one should combine scat- tered chapters which allude to one single subject, so as to reconstruct the full scope of the topic.82 This method applies also to the chapters dedicated to the equivocity in the Bible, and chapters far removed from a certain chapter can provide additional hints and guidelines for the correct understanding of the notions and concepts treated in that chapter."83 (For example, "man ['adam]" is used as a proper name in the Account of Creation and also as a common noun referring to the species of man. It refers to the common human individual, including both his form and matter, but also to the superior individual whose intellect transcends his matter. To all these mean- ings of "man" may be added the one used in the "Account of the Chariot.") Maimonides himself may follow biblical usage and conceals his to God and not to man. See Sha'ar kavvanat ha-peraqim, printed in a number of popular edi- tions of the Guide in the translation of Ibn Tibbon. 80. Cf. Narboni on 1: 59. 81. See Ibn Caspi, introduction ("Instruction with Respect to this Treatise"); Shem Tob on 1: 36 (p. 58a). 82. Cf. Zerahiah Hen on 1: 6: "He alludes to you in many chapters regarding matters which you need in order to understand other chapters which are very far removed from them." 83. A typical example of this method is implicit in his critique there of Albarizi, who made the chapter on 'adam refer to the "man" in Ezekiel's Chariot. Ibn Tibbon thinks that Maimo- nides scattered the various significations of this term in various places in the Guide, and one should not confuse the significations of the various chapters. The specific subject matter of the Guide 1: 14 1 is the equivocity of this noun when signifying a human being and his potential for transcending the level of the multitude and being substantiated as an intellect, like "the first man." The specific subject matter of another chapter, 3: 5, is the "man" in the Account of the Chariot (see M YH, p. 50). By joining these and other chapters together one can reconstruct the general intention of "man," as signifying any intellectual substance, human or superhuman. Cf. also Ibn Tibbon's critique of Maimonides' positing of the supreme signification of "man" in Ezekiel's Chariot in MYH, p. 52.</page><page sequence="22">108 AVIEZER RAVITZKY intention by making use of the differing connotations of terms in different chapters of the Guide. The present discussion is primarily concerned with methodology. A detailed analysis of the content of Ibn Tibbon's interpretation of Maimon- ides' view on this subject calls for a detailed discussion of various chapters of the Guide and is outside the purview of this article. I do believe, however, that a discussion of this sort would uncover elements discussed at length in the post-Tibbonite interpretation of Maimonides from the thirteenth cen- tury onward. (Even two recent studies devoted to two specific issues in the Guide-the equivocity of "man"84 and the Garden of Eden,85 which use an esotericist method of interpretation, independent of Ibn Tibbon's, reveal interesting and clear similarities in detail to Ibn Tibbon's interpretation.) We have restricted ourselves here to comments on Ibn Tibbon's method of interpretation and to some illustrations of the content of this interpretation. IV In his well-known study of the Guide, Leo Strauss developed a detailed conception of the unique literary character of the Guide of the Perplexed, an "oral" character which serves as a mean between writing and speaking:86 In keeping with the esoteric character of his teachings, Maimonides searched for a literary method which would be a substitute for private discussion with a worthy student, one which enables constant testing of the interlocutor's reactions. A private discussion allows for a gradual increase in the level of allusion or for a retreat to conventional teaching when a student reveals himself as unworthy. This tendency is reflected in the use of various literary devices such as the scattering of subject matter, the breaking of the formal continuity of the chapters, contradictions, obfuscating the construction of the Guide and allusions by way of "chapter headings." Maimonides em- phasized that "the Account of the Chariot ... is subject to a legal prohibi- 84. Cf. Harvey's dissertation, cited in n. 56, Appendix A. Compare this with Ibn Tibbon, CE, fol. 11 v: "Whoever understands the Guide of the Perplexed would not deny that 'man' is identical to 'man's spirit."' See also fol. 60r. 85. In a colloquium of the Center for Judaic Studies at Harvard (held February, 1980), Sarah Klein-Braslavi presented an outline of a study to be published, entitled "Maimonides' Interpretation of the Story of the Garden of Eden." 86. See Leo Strauss, Persecution, pp. 47-78. See also L. Strauss "How to Begin to Study The Guide of the Perplexed," in Moses Maimonides, The Guide of the Perplexed, trans. S. Pines (Chicago, 1963), pp. xxi-lvi.</page><page sequence="23">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON AND THE GUIDE 109 tion against its being taught and explained except orally,""87 and that he who understands will never fully explain an esoteric teaching even "by speaking directly to an interlocutor, how then could he put it down in writing?""88 Maimonides' method of writing tries, therefore, to reproduce as much as possible the advantages of a private discussion. Strauss also connected the unique literary characteristics of the Guide to Maimonides' view about the transmission of secrets, orally and in hints scattered in writings, during the period of the Bible and the Talmud up to the philosophical decline of the Jews during the time of Exile. Now, an explicit discussion about the nature of esoteric writing which reproduces the advantages of oral teaching and imitates the possibilities of revelation and concealment inherent in face to face conversation already appears in the work of the first translator and interpreter of the Guide, Samuel Ibn Tibbon. He too discussed this problem in conjunction with a review of the tradition of oral and written teaching by allusion in the earlier history of the Jews, a tradition revived by the composition of the Guide. Among the disciples or commentators of the Guide in the thirteenth century, from Abraham Maimuni89 to Isaiah ben Moses of Salerno90 and Zerahiah Hen9' we find time and again comments hinting at the necessary tension between public writing and private or esoteric conversation. But it was Samuel Ibn Tibbon who devoted a detailed discussion to this question and to a characterization of the nature of esoteric writing as a substitute for oral conversation. Ibn Tibbon taught that "this wisdom ... no man was permitted to teach publicly, but only to transmit chapter headings to those who have under- standing and are worthy of it, so that they may from those principles [the chapter headings] understand the whole issue, and that can only be done face to face. This may be easy for those who are wise and understanding, for there are many devices and twists and turns which the wise teacher may use 87. Guide, Introduction to Part 3. 88. Guide, Introduction.

All this he can do without making things explicit, something that cannot be done in writ- ing.""92 Ibn Tibbon distinguished between two sorts of "devices93 and twists and turns" used in oral teaching: there are external rhetorical devices such as tone of voice and facial expression, but there is also the rhetoric of the language itself and the words it employs. Devices of the first sort facilitate allusion and even make it possible to communicate the opposite of what one is voicing aloud, "just as one would say to another, 'you did very well in so doing,' and the hearer would understand that the speaker in fact thinks ill of those deeds."94 These devices cannot be directly reproduced in esoteric writ- ing (although it may be that Ibn Tibbon thought that this effect may be achieved in a more complicated, indirect way by employing intended contra- dictions). On the other hand, rhetorical devices of the second type, which are linguistic, are obviously imitable in writing. A skillful writer will know how to allude by context-by "adjoining one subject to another," by "transmis- sion of chapter headings," and by "appending comments." This writer will then approximate the advantages of private, intimate conversation which enables contemporaneous revelation and concealment and his writing will make it possible "to whisper [!] and to hint until his intention becomes clear." Ibn Tibbon maintains that this is the literary character of those parts of the Bible which call for special philosophic interpretation (i.e., the Account of Creation, the Account of the Chariot, portions of the Psalms, Ecclesi- astes, Proverbs, the Song of Songs and Job). This is also the literary character of the midrash and of the Guide. Thus it is no wonder that the esoteric methods used by the Guide will be found to be already present in the Bible. For example: "This is the way of concealment used by Ecclesiastes in his book in order to make his rhetoric more difficult, by the use of equivo- city, by both dropping and adding necessary connections [between themes], and this makes it possible for someone to interpret in a way counter to the intended interpretation .. . but the man of understanding will under- stand. .... It should not occur to you that [Ecclesiastes] is needlessly repeti- tious. This is not the way of this book. Any time he repeats himself or 92. CE, fol. 3v. 93.

Elsewhere we learn also that the exoteric level of a biblical writing is identified with those assertions which are common and constantly repeated, whereas the concealed truth is to be found in that assertion which is rare or isolated: "He [the writer of the Psalms] as well as others used [the following method] in all secrets of the Law and of faith, ... [namely], that when they write about a certain subject, they write in most places according to the needs of the multitude . . where- as in one place or .. . in a few places they allude to the truth regarding that subject."''96 He who writes esoterically will repeatedly and publicly declare his adherence to conventional opinions, and will insert into these declara- tions his concealed true view. The emphasis on the oral character of the Jewish philosophical tradition is connected to Ibn Tibbon's intriguing notion of the dynamic nature of the spiritual history of Israel and the gradual purification of the religious con- cepts of the community throughout the ages. His comparative study of the sources makes Ibn Tibbon conclude that there was a gradual disclosure of the secrets of the Torah (which are identical to philosophic truths), a deve- lopment which came about as a result of changing spiritual and cultural conditions. A decisive factor in the formation of this process was the cul- tural, religious and philosophic status of the non-Jewish environment. To cite one example, the Torah was addressed to a community inured to pagan- ism, against the background of a universally held materialism, and thus it was constrained to conceal the philosophic truth about the existence of the 95. -Ty ,miminn TIn mrivp T-inonI Tn rosa In n~m i- T , -r ,Snm imnn5 ny n nj nnP y n i nonn in ran- nIm x55 mrn-Tr -my Ki Iniv nISr xv ... imnm 5Y nny ',l?1vn-mi ... in pimi - ID -m 0K w m IDv * Tlmn nbn riw xin rriion 13vn y , N1m , iynv nn1 in m1m' zmn5 nm n T,'nn r ,mmn 5, 1 5 ; CE, fols. 135r-136v.

It had to conceal this lest these intermediaries, the separate intelligences, be personified, materialized and deified.97 This was no longer necessary in the days of David and Solomon (Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and the Song of Songs) when "the [belief in the] existence of God and the angels [i.e., separate intelligences] was already widespread, the relation [of the angels] to [other] existents and their relation to God became widely known. There was thus no further need of concealment, and Solo- mon no longer refrained from mentioning the existence of the intermedi- aries, though he did it by allusion.""98 However, even the writings of such authors, which have more philosophic content than does the Torah,99 face a community given to pagan and materialistic influences, though on a differ- ent level. This is so, for example, in regard to the belief in immortality which "in those days . . was not set in their hearts, . .. for the Sabean faith existed then all over the world, .... and they could not avoid the faith of those un- believers. . .-the more so in regard to the ascent of the soul which was not mentioned in the Torah explicitly."'00 The historical approach does not apply to the philosophic or religious content itself which is the domain of the few in every generation, beyond time and place,'0' but is strictly applied to 97. See CE, fol. 68r: "Moses gave the Law when the Sabaeans prevailed over the whole world, and they denied the existence of anything not perceived by the senses .... They thus had declared the higher bodies to be divinities of the lower bodies. They did not believe in the existence of existents having no body nor power in a body, i.e., they denied the existence of intelligences separated from matter or any other subject." MYH, p. 173. Cf.

In his treatment of another issue, the investigation of nature, Ibn Tibbon speaks also of progress which comes about as a result of the theoretical and empirical development of the sciences by succeeding generations. After disagreeing with the static view which does not believe in the possibility of such a development "since I can do nothing not done already by the ancients," Ibn Tibbon notes: "By nature, later seekers after wisdom augment the knowledge and deeds of earlier ones. For when a later student having a fine intelligence and a pure under-</page><page sequence="27">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON AND THE GUIDE 113 the style and nature of the written literature. "The Torah speaks in human language (dibberah Torah ki-leshon benei 'adam)," not only according to the general language of man as man, not only in accordance with the "vulgar imagination" of every generation,102 but in a language which adapts itself to the intellectual world of specific hearers, to their time and place.'t3 It is pre- cisely the emphasis on the existence of an additional unwritten stratum which is the common legacy of the intellectual elite throughout history,104 independent of any specific context, an emphasis intended to provide a guarantee against an historicist relativization of philosophy or faith. It is this which allows the interpreter greater freedom in the historicization of the written text. To cite one example: "Moses ... had to conceal many beliefs and to present them as something other than what they were.... Now whereas he did conceal them from the multitude and showed them to be dif- ferent from what they were, he undoubtedly transmitted them [orally] to Joshua and to the seventy elders together with the rest of the oral Torah. He also alluded to many of them to let the wise know about them in their proper place, .... until David and Solomon ... came and added hints to those secrets, once they saw that the need to conceal them had lessened."'05 A standing understands what the earlier ones knew-either by hearing them directly or by hearing those who studied their writings-he will make branches grow from the roots which they put forth and will reach further conclusions from what they had to say, not to speak of what can be added by experimentation and theorizing. This is just as we find in astronomy, in medicine and in the other arts, that the latter adds from his own theorizing and understanding," CE, fol. 55r. "For the student senses what the master did not, and the latter senses what the earlier one did not; this is the way that knowledge increases," CE, fol. 68v.

Ibn Tibbon does not cease emphasizing the continuity of oral teaching, beginning with "Shem and Eber, and others, who had not written books but would lecture and teach face to face, orally" until Moses (citation in the text of the paper below) and the prophets, whose books are but a partial revelation of their oral teaching ("there is no doubt that Isaiah taught more to his disciples orally"), to David who "taught more to the people of his time orally" than he did by writing, and to Solomon "who also taught his generation orally, and then apparently compiled in writing some of what he said orally."

Here we are concerned with the way Samuel Ibn Tibbon fitted these things into his special view of intellectual and literary history. Finally, it is interesting to note that this dynamic conception is not limited to an overview of the classical sources but is directly applied to Ibn Tibbon's own contemporary scene and to the philosophical work of his generation. Here too, the cultural state of the non-Jewish milieu is a decisive factor influencing the character of Jewish literature. In his work, Ma'amar yiqqavu ha-mayim, Ibn Tibbon described the development of non-Jewish religious concepts up to his own time, in a way similar to what he says in his Commentary on Ecclesiastes about the development of the peoples of the world in biblical times. The enhancement and intensification of philosophi- cal education in the non-Jewish world compelled Maimonides and his disciple, Ibn Tibbon, "to add more clarity to their hints," just as David and Solomon had done as a result of a similar process. Yet Maimonides and Ibn Tibbon had to surpass David and Solomon as a result of the deterioration in theoretic knowledge and wisdom of the Jews during their time in Exile.'08 This is the context in which Ibn Tibbon viewed the enterprise of Maimo- nides and the esoteric-exoteric character of his work. It also allowed him (Ibn Tibbon) to reveal daring intentions in the Bible and in the Guide beyond the "simple meaning of Maimonides' words." He was constrained to 106. Cf. MYH, pp. 62, 132, 21: CE, fols. 45r, 135r; Anatoli, Malmadha-talmidim, introduc- tion, p. 3. On Joseph Ibn Caspi's approach which denies to many biblical verses the rank of philosophic truth and finds in them an expression of the views, beliefs and customs of the multi- tude, see Isadore Twersky, "Joseph ibn Kaspi, Portrait of a Medieval Jewish Intellectual," in Studies in Medieval Jewish History and Literature, ed. I. Twersky (Cambridge, Mass., 1979), pp. 238-42. Ibn Tibbon and Ibn Caspi share the view that not every biblical assertion is absolutely true, and not every verse deserves philosophic allegorization. (Ibn Tibbon explicitly presented his views on this issue as more extreme than those of Maimonides, and noted that in his lost book, Ner ha-fhofes, he elaborated his position. See MYH p. 132). Both Ibn Tibbon and Ibn Caspi maintain that their position holds also for issues not directly connected to the issue of anthropomorphism. But Ibn Tibbon's position is connected to the pedagogic-political context of the Bible; he does not share Ibn Caspi's general hermeneutic principle regarding the adop- tion of the opinions and customs of the multitude even beyond this context (see Twersky, ibid.). This particular theme in Ibn Tibbon's teaching goes beyond our present concern with his interpretation of Maimonides. I hope to be able to treat it elsewhere. 107. See G. Vajda's studies cited in n. 99. 108. See the Guide 1: 71, 2: 11, 3: 10.</page><page sequence="29">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON AND THE GUIDE 115 do this as a result of the transformation in the status of philosophy which he witnessed: "For I have noticed that those truths which have been concealed by our prophets and the sages of our Torah since days of yore are today all widely known to the peoples of the world ... and they are now deriding us, saying that we have only the outer peel of the words of our prophets, and similar insults and aspersions .... I have noticed too that the true sciences are far better known among the nations under whose rule I live than they are in the Islamic countries."'09 This illustrates the fact that in Ibn Tibbon's time the ascendancy in philosophy passed from the Moslems to the Chris- tians for the first time since the tenth century:"' yet it reflects historical sensitivity and social consciousness rather than profound knowledge of Christian scholasticism. Ibn Tibbon's teaching is still inextricably inter- twined with Arabic philosophy. At any rate, the transplantation of the philosophic center and the dissemination of theoretical truths in Ibn Tib- bon's non-Jewish environment legitimized a transcending of Maimonides' esotericism, called for by the continuous dynamic process of the uncovering of secrets in the history of Israel. This process, which had been stalled during the period between the codification of the Talmud and the writings of Maimonides, who revived it, was to be continued by his disciples in dis- seminating his teachings and continuously developing them. (One hundred and forty years after Ibn Tibbon, Moses Narboni said the following: "The Master [Maimonides] briefly hints at what we reveal to you in extenso, for times naturally change and so do people, and so we can now widen the small holes of the filigree-work with more truths than it was possible to do in the past, for accepted convention is no longer at loggerheads with intellectual truth as much as it was in the past. This is due first and foremost to Maimonides.""'I Revealing the secrets of the Guide becomes possible due to changing times and the spreading of philosophic truth.)

A work such as the Guide, which is said to react against a situation in which "those truths which have been concealed by our prophets and the sages of our Torah are today all widely known to the peoples of the world" cannot be fully grasped outside the context of the non-Jewish philosophic literature of its time and place."2 Indeed, these assertions cannot be divorced from their apologetic context directed toward the nonphilosophic or semiphilosophic contemporary Jewish society. Yet it was not by chance that Ibn Tibbon chose in this context to emphasize the need for an apologia vis-a-vis his non-Jewish philosophical environment.'3 Our conclusions may be summarized as follows: Samuel Ibn Tibbon underscored the esoteric and oral character of the 112. Cf. Joseph Ibn Caspi, Menorat kesef, in 'Asarah kelei kesef, ed. Isaac Last (Pressburg, 1903), p. 77, who justifies revealing secrets with the following argument: "I simply copy what the philosophers like Aristotle and his colleagues, who wrote about these things in their books, say. What I wish to do is to clarify the three worlds, what we call the Account of the Chariot. Their books are well known to everyone, though, truly, they are unknown by our people, due to our transgressions." Abravanel would later use Ibn Tibbon's argument in a way counter to Ibn Tibbon's original intention, in order to argue against the identification of the secrets of the Torah with philosophic truths: "It would be very strange if intellectual investigation were iden- tical to prophetic emanation . . . for philosophic lectures are delivered to a public of thousands in the academies of the wise of the gentiles . . young and old, and they do not try to conceal it at all. Ibn Tibbon has already sensed the doubtful nature of this argument." See "Te'anot lequbot mi-teva' ha-ketuvim yema'anu mah she-peresh ha-RaMBaM be-merkevet Yebez- qe'el," printed in the popular editions of the Guide, pt. 3, pp. 71-72. This issue was already a source of contention between Zerahiah Hen and Hillel of Verona at the end of the thirteenth century. Note the former: "For you search for secrets where they are not.... It is the things found in their treatises on natural science . . which he calls secret, not because they are written in the books of the natural philosophers, but because they are hinted at by the prophets" ('OSar nehmad 2 [1857]: 132).

The argument that it is obligatory to disseminate the sciences among the Jews, and to reveal the intellectual truths hidden in the Jewish sources on account of the contemporary philosophic inferiority of the Jews vis-a-vis their neighbors is constantly repeated in the writ- ings of scholars influenced by Ibn Tibbon in the thirteenth century.

Jewish literature, from the Bible onward, adopted the pedagogic method used in face to face teaching and concealed at the same time as it revealed. This literature reflects also the tension between its ahistoric philosophic content and the historic-pedagogic neces- sity arising from the cultural environment. The gradual uncovering of philo- sophic truths reveals the historic transformation and gradual development of concepts of faith of both Jewish and non-Jewish society in the course of time. The Guide of the Perplexed is a foundation stone as well as a new starting point within this "oral" esoteric tradition. Ibn Tibbon viewed himself as occupying a unique position from which to appreciate Maimonides' daring intention and emphasized it even in the face of the controversy regarding the Maimonidean corpus. In order to decode the secrets of the Guide, one must grasp the method of allusive and concealed writing, in addition to hav- ing a philosophic education and philosophic power of reflection. The fundamental methodological principles which guide Ibn Tibbon's esoteric reading are: highlighting the role of intentional contradictions and avoiding the attempt to harmonize the true, esoteric teaching and the vulgar teaching which is used to conceal the former, and according to the biblical paradigm, that would also mean identification of the concealed truth with the rare or unique statement appearing in the text and identification of the vulgar, conventional teaching with common or frequent statements; a strict reconstruction of the teaching of Maimonides on any specific issue by a meticulous comparison of the chapters and "connecting" one to another; distinguishing each chapter's unique subject matter while combining scat- tered chapters dealing in effect with a single issue; a search for the esoteric context of comments which seem out of place; special attention to chapters whose subject matter breaks the continuity of a series of chapters; special attention to the elucidation of biblical equivocal words and to various and scattered uses of those equivocal words in Maimonides. 14 Basic elements of this method already guided Ibn Tibbon during the lifetime of Maimonides, around the time of his translation of the Guide. 114. This refers to biblical terms. It should be noted that in his translation of the Guide, the translator did not take care to translate an Arabic term by the same Hebrew term in every case. This is also true for terms which have a paramount importance in the Guide, as, for example, the Will of God. The Arab terms mashiyya and irada were not translated in every case as raSon or hefe? respectively. See Abraham Nuriel, "Ha-RaSon ha-'elohi be-Moreh nevukhim," Tarbiz 39 (1970): 39.</page><page sequence="32">118 AVIEZER RAVITZKY From the point of view of the substance of the views attributed to Maimonides, this method has been exemplified here by the strict Aristo- telian interpretation of the issues of Providence and nature, intellectual per- fection and immortality, in the allegorization of a biblical story and in other allusions connected to it. Does this method apply also to the roots of Maimonides' theological views, his concept of God, His Will and creation ex nihilo? It is difficult to give an unequivocal answer to this question since it depends on our interpretation of Ibn Tibbon himself and of his own esoteric writing; there is also the difficulty of distinguishing between the views which he attributed to Maimonides and those he considered as having developed himself. Nevertheless, it appears that even in these fundamental aspects of Maimonides' theology, Ibn Tibbon distinguished between an esoteric and an exoteric teaching. In the epistle on Providence we already note his ten- dency to prefer those sections dealing with Divine Will as embodied in natural reality over other sections of the Guide, and to treat Providence as reflected by the Will which is mediated by nature and its laws. In the Com- mentary on Ecclesiastes, belief in a single unmediated act of Creation was maintained to be "the simple sense of some of the Master's words which he explains in some sections of his distinguished treatise.""'5 In the Ma'amar yiqqavu ha-mayim we find an undercurrent of criticism of Maimonides' explicit statements about creation and the Divine Will, a critique which very carefully hints at a Saadianic-Kalam context of certain sections of the Guide,"6 and refers to another section as "the simple sense of his words con- 115. CE, fol. 67v. 116. 1. Saadia Gaon interpreted "And God said let there be light-God willed that there should be light." See Saadia Gaon, Commentary on the Torah, ed. Joseph Kafib (Jerusalem, 1963), p. 11. His interpretation identifies the creating speech with the causing will which is not directed at any particular object, and indeed that is the interpretation which is most appro- priate to a belief in a direct and simultaneous creation ex nihilo of all existence. Ibn Tibbon, fol- lowing Abraham Ibn Ezra, had reservations about this interpretation and explained that God's "speeches" (ma'amarim) are directed toward intermediary beings (intellects and spheres; see below) between God and his creatures, in the Account of Creation. It was convenient for him to point to his predecessors' controversy (MYH, p. 125), but a reader who is well-versed in the text of the Guide will recognize the drift of what is being said, and will note that the approach which is being criticized is the very one adopted by Maimonides himself in what seemed to Ibn Tibbon to be "the plain sense of his words." Maimonides had in fact noted that "this has already been said by an individual other than us and is very well-known." Guide 1: 65. Cf. CE, fol. 67. 2. Maimonides distinguished between belief in an arbitrary voluntary action of God-"by will alone" (a belief similar to that held by the Ash'arite Kalam) and the belief of "our scholars and of our men of knowledge" in a voluntary action of God which is subsequent to wisdom, to</page><page sequence="33">SAMUEL IBN TIBBON AND THE GUIDE 119 tained in the Guide, 2:30.""' At any rate, Ibn Tibbon's independent writings have recourse to Divine Will only in the sense of its embodiment in natural reality. The Will is the power of guidance intrinsic to the world order and the laws of nature-"in accordance with Divine Will which is in accordance with that nature which emanated from Him""I8 (italics added). The Will is the activating power reflected in the motion of the spheres, in the recursive- ness of generation and corruption, and so forth. I have not found in Samuel Ibn Tibbon's writings any usage of the attribute of Will taken as a Free Will beyond reality, a Will whose essence is "to will and not to will."'9 The same is true for Ibn Tibbon's theory of creation, which expropriates the Aristote- lian eternal beings-intelligences, spheres, elements-from the act of crea- tion. The Account of Creation takes place against the background of eternal beings and is limited to the process of generation of the individual beings of the sublunar world. Maimonides' identification of the Account of Creation with Aristotelian physics was taken advantage of by Ibn Tibbon to the fullest. This paper has treated Samuel Ibn Tibbon as an interpreter of Maimonides, and it has generally avoided dealing with his own teaching. Ibn Tibbon viewed his independent work as having grown out of Maimo- nides' philosophy, and yet he did not hesitate to take issue with his master on many details of the philosophic interpretation of the Bible and on a number of theoretical problems. His unbounded admiration for the man, the life of whom "in any branch of learning we have not known since the days of Rav Ashi,"'20 did not place Maimonides beyond error, and it might be possible that "immersed in his work he did not reflect on this, for that is what habit a telic intention (Guide 3: 25-26). Ibn Tibbon cautiously bestowed on these terms a new mean- ing. Every belief in a direct simultaneous ex nihilo creation of all reality is called by him a belief in creation "by will alone," as against creation "by wisdom"-which would mean henceforth a caused mediation of existing beings (MYH, p. 126). Thus, by taking advantage of Maimo- nidean linguistic usages, "the plain sense of his [Maimonides'] words in 2: 30" (MYH, p. 128) are included in the criticized view. 117.

We are dealing with a scholar whose interpretative career started during Maimonides' own lifetime, through a personal correspondence with the Master, who was his first translator and interpreter, and who laid down the rules for a whole school which was active for more than a century. Finally, we noted what the scholars of his time thought about Ibn Tibbon a propos the secrets of the Guide. I would therefore like to conclude with a comment about the contacts and the nature of the relationship between Maimonides and Samuel Ibn Tibbon, a comment which could be relevant to the problem of the interpretation of the Guide. Maimonides put his imprimatur on Ibn Tibbon's translation of the Guide, recommended him to the scholars of Lunel as his worthy trans- lator,'25 and replied in detail to Ibn Tibbon's queries about the style and the ideas contained in the work and about his evaluation of some philosophical 121.  mn?n nn nv1y-,m ,~,yi nT 1 I-~'T~1 K? - ,V, a?ni, CE, fol. 65v.

Their correspondence began apparently in 1197,126 while Ibn Tibbon's last letter to Maimonides was sent during the last year of Maimonides' life, 1204.127 It appears that Maimonides refrained from reply- ing to Ibn Tibbon's letter concerning Providence (1199). It it true that we do not possess all of the correspondence between them,'28 but it appears that this is not the reason for lack of reply to this particular epistle, since Ibn Tibbon continuously wondered about this question more than twenty years later. His son Moses Ibn Tibbon, Shem Tov Falaquera and Moses Narboni also studied and commented on this epistle,'29 and it is difficult to believe that all of them disregarded a reply written by Maimonides. Seven months after the writing of the epistle on Providence, Maimonides replied in writing to other questions (Tishri 1511 [Seleucid Era]-September 1199) and did not mention the question of Providence.130 A. Marx's view that Maimonides had not yet received the epistle on Providence is not the only possible expla- nation for the absence of a Maimonidean reply."' It appears that Mai- monides refrained from reacting even afterwards. It should be noted that Maimonides rejected Ibn Tibbon's request to come to Egypt to study with him personally, although he wrote graciously about Ibn Tibbon's plan to visit him: "Come, O blessed of the Lord, and most blessed of visitors, I am very happy and delighted about this.... Do not, however, expect to spend even one hour alone with me either by day or by night, and do not expect any gain in wisdom or learning [by coming]."'32 Maimonides wrote in detail 126. There is a disagreement about the reconstruction of the various phases of the cor- respondence. See Alexander Marx, "The Correspondence between the Rabbis of Southern France and Maimonides about Astrology," Hebrew Union College Annual 3 (1926): 333-36; idem, "Maimonides and the Scholars of Southern France," in Studies in Jewish History and Booklore (New York, 1944), pp. 58-62. Cf. also I. Sonne, "Maimonides' Epistle." 127. See CE, fol. 5v. 128. For example, Maimonides answered Ibn Tibbon's request to visit him (see below), yet we do not possess the original letter of request. Ibn Tibbon reports too on his last letter to Mai- monides (CE, fol. 5v), but we do not possess this either. There might have been other exchanges of letters. 129. See A. Marx, "The Correspondence," p. 335, n. 54; Diesendruck, "Samuel and Moses ibn Tibbon," pp. 348-50. 130. Cf. M. Steinschneider, Catalogus ... Bodleiana, p. 2490; I.

Should we con- clude that Maimonides altered his positive attitude toward Ibn Tibbon after reading his epistles such as the epistle on Providence? That is not what we learn from Abraham Maimuni, who wrote, "Toward the end of [Mai- monides'] life, he received the epistles of the Father of Translators, the sage theologian, the distinguished Samuel, son of the distinguished Judah Ibn Tibbon. Indeed he was a great and respected sage of great understanding; my righteous father and master . . told me that he [Ibn Tibbon] reached all the way to the depths of the secrets of the treatise Guide of the Perplexed as well as the rest of his [Maimonides'] writings, and understood his [or: its] intention."'33 These words do not refer, to be sure, to Ibn Tibbon's later independent writings, but as we noted above, central elements of Ibn Tibbon's approach to the interpretation of the Guide could be anticipated even during Maimonides' lifetime.'34 However much we want to rely on Abraham Maimuni's testimony, it appears that Ibn Tibbon himself never 5t5 m' 5,mn -K n,253 , n 1K Tt2 inK I v 1' '!x rnlmnnl1, Qove? teshuvot ha-RaMBaM ve-'iggerotav, pt. 2, p. 28b (that letter is from Tishri 1511, Seleucid Era). Prof. Jacob Levinger has suggested (in an oral communication) that Maimonides tried to hint to Ibn Tibbon that he should not expect additional revelations about Maimonides' views of problems such as providence, even in a private conversation. 133. See above. 134. In addition to what has been said above, I would like to note the following: In Ibn Tibbon's introduction to Maimonides' commentary on 'Avot, the translator hints at his dis- satisfaction with the concluding chapter of the Guide, which might be thought to imply that the moral virtues (besed, mishpat and $edaqah) are preferable to the theoretical virtues, i.e., to intel- lectual union (haskel ve-yado'a 'oti) in contradistinction to other chapters in the Guide. Ibn Tibbon prefers an alternative interpretation of Jeremiah 9:22-23; henceforth the primacy of intellection would no longer be in doubt: "Although the Master interpreted this verse well in 3: 54 ... I have a different interpretation of some of its words, .... an innovation. I have no doubt that it is a good and true one. .... It seems to me that there is another interpretation, . . . which is that the main thrust of the hint in the phrase, 'For in these things I delight, saith the Lord,' refers to 'that he understands and knows Me' (haskel ve-yado'a 'oti), for here he gives a reason why one should glory in these two [understanding and knowing], and not in the other three noted [besed, mishpat u-?edaqah-lovingkindness, justice and righteousness]; the reason is that these two, i.e., haskel ve-yado'a 'oti, are His ultimate desire and intention in man" (xnnv "aK1 T'-qK w-gn ... nn?K int 1rrfL ny~ lpp 1n,5 w -, ... ,vv 1n p5n;i In "n I n 3v v1'r -1,D pinnl- 1T 7V, "T t1Km )nyvi fl~K2 'n-r1nK2 Tnz1 17-gyv K1m1 .. . tril2 un- IY,1T n 'i 1-95zwi ...lnnn K1 m=t 2 'xpK inO atK2 imnniDi inn n,~ n on ,'InlK ix' mnI); (MS Vienna Heb. 156, fol. 8r).

What was the nature of their relationship in the years 1199-1204? Did Ibn Tibbon distinguish between Maimonides' refraining from directly answering him and avoiding a face to face meeting between them and his possible agreement to a written work alluding to the secrets of those biblical books which call for greater philosophical interpretation? We have no answer to these questions. Samuel Ibn Tibbon's conviction that he was unique in understanding the secrets of the Guide cannot be doubted. The ultimate question of the intention and aims of the Master himself is thereby not solved. Department of Jewish Thought Hebrew University Jerusalem, Israel hebraeischen Uebersetzungen, p. 438. The addition of ZaL [of blessed memory] is attributed to a later copier.) Thus we must consider the possibility that Maimonides saw this passage and could be informed about Ibn Tibbon's tendencies from yet another angle. Modern scholarship on the Guide (beginning with Herman Cohen) was concerned with the problem treated here by the Guide (from the point of view of the interpretation of the Guide). See, e.g., Eliezer Goldman, "Ha-'Avodah ha-meyuliedet be-massigei ha-'amittot," Bar Ilan Annual 6 (1968): 287-313. See also L. V.
