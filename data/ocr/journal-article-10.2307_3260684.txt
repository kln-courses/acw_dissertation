<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews of the prophet is being reconceived-from spokesman to servant-and there is a greater frequency of mimetic and symbolic actions. In the penultimate section on exilic-deuteronomic reactions to exile, Ezekiel, and Second Isaiah, Blenkinsopp broaches the sixth century. Basic to his analysis is the claim that "prophecy did not come to an end" (p. 188) but instead underwent a series of transformations. For example, Ezekiel exemplifies "prophecy as a form of pastoral ministry and community leadership" (p. 204). In the final chapter, Blenkinsopp addresses Palestinian Judaism in the early Persian period (Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi, Third Isaiah, Temple prophecy, the eschatological reinterpretation of prophecy, and Jonah). This chapter is probably the most original part of the book. When discussing Third Isaiah, he argues that Ezra's reform program was accepted and enforced by the group associated with Third Isaiah. Also, he maintains that one of the major transformations of prophecy was its absorption into the cult. Further, Deutero-Joel, Deutero-Zechariah, and the Isaianic Apocalypse, are adduced as evidence of further transformation, "the gradual consolidation of what might be called an eschatological doctrine" (p. 267). The final book treated is Jonah. Here he thinks the author is pioneering a new understanding of the "office" of the prophet, "apostolic prophecy," a view of the prophet "based on the conviction that God's will is to save." Nevertheless, this tantalizing notion is all too tersely sketched. For a one-volume work which includes summary pieces on individual pro- phetic books, incorporates recent higher critical scholarship, and integrates the course of Israelite history into the discussion, there is probably no better study. And yet a problem remains. What is a prophet and what transformations occurred within prophecy over its more than five hundred year history? The reader receives no clear answer to the first question (cf. R. Wilson's notion of intermediary). One senses a "canonical" definition implicit in the book. If someone is described as a prophet, e.g., Saul, or if a book occurs as part of the prophetic canon, e.g., Jonah, then that figure or book qualifies for inclusion in the survey. For a critical assess- ment of Israelite prophecy, this procedure will not suffice, nor will it provide the conceptual leverage to enable a history of Israelite prophecy. It is one thing to talk of transformations, but one needs to know what is being transformed. The absence of a summary section for the individual chapters or for the volume as a whole is, perhaps, indicative of the volume's essential character. It is more an introduction to the various prophets in chronological order than it is a history of prophecy per se. As such, it is a valuable work, either as a reference tool or as a potential text for a course on Israelite prophetic literature. David L. Petersen Iliff School of Theology, Denver, CO 80210 The Achievements of Biblical Religion: A Prolegomenon to Old Testament Theology, by Simon J. De Vries. Lanham/New York/London: University Press of America, 1983. Pp. xxxviii + 519. $32.50/19.75. In this book Professor De Vries posits and elaborates upon five theological themes of the OT: (1) the transcendence and immanence of God; (2) the divine 691</page><page sequence="2">Journal of Biblical Literature image mirrored in human personhood; (3) a life fulfilling integrity within a cove- nant community; (4) history as responsible dialogue with God; and (5) a meaning and purpose amidst the evils of finite existence. De Vries is concerned to set forth the distinctiveness of what he considers to be the chief intellectual and theological accomplishments of the OT. In respective chapters he focuses upon God as Holy, Righteous, Jealous, Living, and Caring. The author has made it something of a methodological principle to examine related ancient Near Eastern texts (either summarized or in direct quotation, or both). Citations are followed by brief and often insightful comments. Another methodological practice of De Vries is to in- clude in each chapter a section on the NT appropriation of, or variation on, the OT theme. De Vries writes with theological sophistication, independence of judgment, and self-assurance. He constantly and helpfully seeks to summarize the positions of the various writers by means of conceptual tags. For example, he contrasts the "immanentistic monism" of many nonbiblical religions with "biblical personalism" or "personalistic dualism"; in the Lipit Ishtar Law Code he sees an example of "pragmatic prudentialism." Throughout the book De Vries levels several brief but sharp and telling volleys against Protestant fundamentalism and propositional the- ology (pp. 22, 30-31, 223, 331). Chapters conclude with bibliographic references, often helpfully outlined. De Vries acknowledges particular indebtedness to the theological studies of T. Vriezen, G. von Rad, and S. Terrien. The apologetic stances taken in defense of biblical religion are informed by an independent blend of Calvinism, Methodism, recent scholarship, and the tenets of the movement in biblical theology which has been regnant for the past half century. Along with biblicism, three other foes which De Vries singles out for harsh treatment are apocalypticism, Torah rigorism, and mysticism. What is most appealing in this book is its freshness. We do not have here simply a rehash of well-known and predictable positions. Thus, in his opening chapter on the transcendence and immanence of God, De Vries bravely examines the use of anthropomorphism in other ancient Near Eastern religions, the unavoidability of "myth" ("archetypal images appearing in various kinds of imaginative conceptual- ity"), sexual imagery and divine fatherhood, etc. In this chapter, which commences with a consideration of the Holy God and holiness, one might have anticipated De Vries would have discussed the differences between the prophetic and priestly understandings of the requirements of holiness. Instead, focus on ethical matters is postponed to chap. 3; here De Vries sets forth his "covenantal ethics" on the basis of an examination of the Shema', Leviticus 18 and 19, selected passages in Deu- teronomy, and the second table of the law. In chap. 3 De Vries also explores the meaning of election and ethnicity, and how the apotheosization of the Torah in apocalyptic strongly influences the development of "the concept of biblical in- errancy in Judaism" (p. 267). In the case of the last mentioned observation, one wonders if De Vries has not somewhat artificially manufactured in his study of antiquity a rather remote and strained analogue of contemporary biblicism. In chap. 2 De Vries expounds his anthropology, hamartiology, and soteri- ology. Even though he continues to affirm the "paternal immanence" of God, he shows himself to be a staunch defender of a radical and full equality of male and 692</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews female as "an authentically biblical principle." Apocalyptic once again, however, becomes a whipping boy; in De Vries's view, apocalyptic dualism, on the one hand, allows an explanation of evil to arise which removes from humankind the full responsibility for evil and, on the other hand, idolatrously fosters a narrow particularism and egocentric ideology. The discussion of myth, legend, and tales of wonder and miracle in chap. 4 is especially helpful. "They [the tales of wonder and miracle] are not historiograph- ical, but ideological. They are testimonies not to what God has done, but to what God can do" (p. 334). De Vries, however, yet again seems compelled to exorcize that demon apocalyptic (my characterization) -this time for being deistic, mech- anistic, and subversive of purposeful human activity. Other reflections of De Vries on the sabbath as a symbol of God's lordship over time, on canon and continuing revelations, and on the biblical differentiation between quantitative and qualita- tive time are closer to the mark of sound rather than exaggerated perception. De Vries's final chapter, "A Meaning and Purpose in Finite Existence," reads like a sermonic essay on the several superior answers which the OT, in contrast to other ancient Near Eastern literature, offers to human beings confronted by the limits of existence and the ultimate limit of death. In sum, De Vries has written a unique prolegomenon to OT theology. At times the author is prolix and awkward, but at others remarkably concise and telling. This work is a testament of a faithful laborer and independent thinker. It is occa- sionally flawed stylistically, but its main messages are clear and provocative. In addition to the twelve dozen errata noted in a mailing to the Editor of this journal, I found another two dozen or so. Out of sheer self interest, the directors of the University Press of America should take steps to see that typescripts are not reproduced unless they have been carefully scrutinized. Readers are apt to con- clude that the quality of proofreading is an accurate measure of the quality of the content of the volume. In the case of the present work, such is decidedly not the case.

Everett Fox has produced a translation of the Book of Genesis ideally suited for readers and listeners who cannot read the Hebrew text but would like as much as possible of the style and flavor of the original. In his preface to the work he has explained his intention succinctly. This translation is guided by the principle that the Hebrew Bible originated largely as a spoken literature, and that consequently it must be translated with careful attention to rhythm and sound. The translation tries to reflect the particular rhetoric of the Hebrew wherever possible, preserving such devices as repetition, allusion, alliteration, and wordplay. It is therefore in- tended to echo the Hebrew, and when read aloud, to lead the reader back to the sound structure and form of the original. 693</page></plain_text>
