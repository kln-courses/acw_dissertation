<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROSMARIN'S RELIGION OF REASON-EFROS world" -an abstract freedom resulting only in casual, really unfree, activity, but rising through the striving of the spirit to concreteness, actuality, and self understanding. Does this religion signify a relation to God? No, for relation means mutual dependance and God is not contingent. Religion means man's being self-related and God is the transcendent creator of that freedom, its ground and root; and yet in man's dialectical march from abstract to concrete freedom there is also a concomitant progress from an abstract to a concrete conscious- ness of the Inspirer of this human march. This anthropological-ethical tendency lies at the center of his thought when he re-interprets Hegel's principle of contradiction in order to show that sin is not a necessity, but only a possibility implicit in the abstract stage of freedom; and man must keep it only as a possibility but not as an actuality - all this in opposition to Pagan determinism and the Paulinistic doctrine of original sin. It is on this theory of freedom that he bases his construction of the history of religions showing that religion moved in three spirals, always culminating in nought until Abraham came and inaugurated the absolute religion of which Judaism is the intensive stage, and Christianity the extensive stage, with the ultimate blending of both in the religion of mankind. It is a thoughtful critical study in which, however, one misses such modern Jewish thinkers as Solomon Maimon, Nahman Krochmal, Samson Raphael Hirsch; Ahad ha-Am, A. D. Gordon; Hermann Cohen, Martin Buber, and Franz Rosenzweig. To S. L. Steinheim, the second volume of this work is to be devoted. ROSMARIN'S RELIGION OF REASON3 THE central doctrine in Hermann Cohen's Jewish religious philos- ophy as sketched in this book is that of correlation. Ethics finds its material and concrete expression in nature; and the harmony between the two, between the ideal and the real, theory and practice, is truth. In order therefore to assure its eternal validity, ethics demands the eternity of its medium of expression; and hence it posits the God-idea as the guarantor that its material will not fail. But logic, too, seeks its eternal validity; so that both logic and ethics unite in affirming 3 Religion of Reason. Hermann Cohen's System of Religious Philos- ophy. By TRUDE WEISS ROSMARIN.

God then as truth is to be freed from all primitive anthropomorphism and should be con- ceived as an idea, amenable to scientific understanding; nor is He, as the Spinozists maintain, identical with nature, but transcendent; for truth does not mean unity, but harmony. He is never entirely ethics, nor completely nature, but their harmony. Truth is one and indupli- cable, hence God is one, or rather singular, one with Being (I am that I am); so that everything else, the whole physical world, has no being but only existence; the difference between these two terms being that the first is a rational concept, while the second is sensual, physical. Hence both the mythologists and the Spinozists are in error, having adulterated the God-Idea with sensuality, having confused the terms Being with existence. Being is the cause and container of Becoming, so that God is the crea- tor and carrier of the universe. But reason can understand creation only as a constant renewal. Revelation is also regarded rationalistically as the driving force of intellectual and ethical progress -the Sinai that flames in the human heart. It is through reason that man enters a correlation with God, because reason is part of God as well as of man. Man is God's creature, but God is man's discovery. Yet we must guard ourselves against hypostatizing reason or spirit into an objective mediator and also against assuming that God and man, linked in spirit, can at any time become identical. No, spirit or reason remains only a link, a bridge across an abyss. But the link lies not only in the realm of reason and causality, i. e., revelation and creation, but also in that of purpose or action. God's thirteen attributes are, as mediaeval philosophers pointed out, qualities not of being but action; they are patterns of human conduct; and they are reducible to love and justice, or, in biblical terminology, holiness and goodness. Yet in this second correlation too we find no identity, but a long link; because God's holiness is being, while that of man is becoming, a task, a never attainable but ever more approachable ideal. Nor is holiness a mediator; it is not a holy spirit, but a spirit of holiness. The correlation between God and man presupposes a correlation between man and man; for while the primary concern of mythology is the life of the gods, that of religion is the life of man, that is, his social life. Religion elevates the "other man" to the rank of a "fellow- man" and teaches us that social suffering, and particularly poverty, which to the prophets was the main riddle of life, the question mark on divine justice, should not be met with Stoic apathy, but with pity 140</page><page sequence="3">RAUFMAN S EDITION OF MOREH NEBUKIM-EFROS 141 which Spinoza deprecated but which Cohen regards as the "original form of human love." Out of this love for the poor there is born a love for God who has implanted pity in the heart of man and whose Heart itself must go out to all men, for they are all to be pitied; and so, in addition to reason and ethics, we have now social love as the third type of correlation between God and man. But there is also a fourth type - an individual and personal correlation which comes into being in man's commitment and in God's forgiveness of sin; for while mythology speaks of the clan and arbitrary fate, and Paulinism - of original sin, and the earlier Hebrew prophets see sins transmitted from generation to generation; in advanced monotheism which felt the impulse of the Ezekielite revolutionary doctrine of individual responsi- bility, the sinner recognizes that he himself and alone is the bearer of the stain and the blame of the sin. Thus in moral suffering man dis- covers that he is not only one of a group, a sharer in the general fate and destiny, but also - and, in that moment, mainly - an individual for himself with his own sorrows; and in atonement and reconciliation crowned with God's merciful forgiveness, we have the individual, the completely personal type of correlation between the I and the I am. Thus religion, though not independent of philosophy, though indeed a part of philosophy, sharing with it the fundamental problem of God, man and being, and also the same criterion of truth - reason, is not entirely a borrower, is not lost in the united states of culture, but brings something new and distinctive; for religion has Eigenart. The book ends with a comprehensive bibliography of books, essays, and reviews on Hermann Cohen and his philosophy. KAUFMAN'S EDITION OF THE MOREH NEBUKIM4 THIS first volume of Kaufman's edition of the Moreh Nebukim, containing the first forty-nine chapters, has many helpful features for which the reader will surely feel grateful. It begins with a lengthy introduction dealing with the generation of Maimonides, his teacher, the cultural climate, his wanderings from Spain to Morocco and thence 4 3 tY0 1 ,ll'p'n 1?4 +XXvI W 'I npnynz 1o' I n rJwo i Dlrnn~ C 1mm . sD nIp n ' ,nr :n rI ln mnnDmi -lvrl Dwm:iN O'D1,m-T "y nni1D1oi n-plao l:K mrl', nrn wI's ' yl .nlllpD 'l0nl rnlyl ,nnrllll ,wnl l:y: 'ml ,' znyn .n":r'n lD1 "':WX. nlVIn ;I:':-~n .(R) l-wmn pin ,(lsP nnrr "T-r) ,lmww 30+442 +LXXXVII y"y.</page></plain_text>
