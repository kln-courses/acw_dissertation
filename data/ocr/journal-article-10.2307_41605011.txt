Maria in Agro at Pallanza Rodolfo Baroncini Università degli Studi di Parma, Istituto di Musicologia almost circular ensemble: an angel organist in the right-hand group and an angel "conductor" with a partbook on the left. In the more regular right-hand group, the circle is completed by angels in poses of ecstatic contemplation [fig. 2]; in the left-hand choir, the freer design is completed by two part-holding putti [fig. 3]. A total of thirteen instruments are included in the composition: seven on the right and six on the left. The right- hand first ensemble consists of a lute, shawm, cornett, buccina, "violin", bass violin, and organ; the less eccentric and more homogeneous second group has a trombone, lute, portative harp, flute, "violin", and viol. Before passing on to a critical reading of the two ensembles, it is worth briefly considering the personalities and styles of the two painters concerned. Though both Aurelio Luini and Carlo Urbino operated in the Milan area, they exemplify the two opposing attitudes of the Lombard artistic tradition towards Mannerism: the resistance and the acceptance. Luini's style is poised, eloquent and full of intimate and restrained devotion, and as such is entirely in line with the schools of Leonardo and Gaudenzio. To him are attributed the angels of the left-hand group with their softly defined bodies and their graceful faces topped with curly, fair hair.3 Urbino's style, on the other hand, is more up-to-date and clearly influenced by the Mannerist taste. His angels (in the right-hand group) adopt more strained poses, with a more linear interplay of drapery.4 But despite these differences, the overall result is reasonably unified. The two artists adapted each other's style and engaged in a subtle dialectic between Mannerism and the upholding of tradition. Far from being irrelevant, the whole stylistic issue is funda- mental to our understanding of the overall composition of each ensemble and the individual characteristics of each instrument. A freedom with which painters were depicting instruments and 39 Situated near the towns of Suna and Pallanza, on the west bank of Lake Maggiore, the church of S. Maria in Agro (better known as Madonna di Campagna) stands on the site of an earlier building. It was built in 1526 to the plans by Giovanni and Pietro Beretta of Brissago, though consecrated only in 1547. It is surmounted by a lantern which is very similar to the one that Giovanni Antonio Amadeo, the Lombard architect and sculptor, designed for the sanctuary of Saronno.1 Despite continuous dis- cord between the communities of Suna and Pallanza over the jurisdiction of the new building, during the second half of the 16th century this simple country oratory was gradually transformed into an important center of Marian devotion. It was during this period, and more precisely in the mid-1570s, that decorating of the interior began. Painters and craftsmen of high reputation were given commissions by the church's council of maintenance: Bernardino Lanino to create a tabernacle (1581); Camillo Procaccini to paint an extensive Marian cycle for the Cappella delle Grazie (1594-96); Andrea Merzagora to erect the wooden choir; and finally, Aurelio Luini and Carlo Urbino to provide the great fresco decorations in the presbytery and apse (1576-57). These paintings, and particularly the impressive Assumption in the apse which has been recently rescued from the neglect and scholarly indifference,2 will be the focus of our investigation. The fresco, which occupies the whole of the apse vault, was equally apportioned between the two Lombard artists. It shows the Virgin surrounded by a group of flying angels in attitudes of prayer; below, on each side of this imposing central composition and over each of the two large apse windows, depicted are two choirs of angel musicians [fig. 1]. Each group has the identical number of participants: seven angel musicians, in addition to a few secondary figures, arranged according to the same geome- trical criteria, with a central figure acting as the pivot in an</page><page sequence="2">RIdlM/RCMI Newsletter XXI/2 Fall 1996 О GO &lt; a CÍ o3 s ui -о а оо &lt;D IS U oí N Он &lt;5а С •2 S X о с V-4 D TÜ оЗ U -о с а '£ 'В ■J .2 'ÕJ &lt; 40</page><page sequence="3">Fall 1996 RIdlM/RCMI Newsletter XXI/2 musical scenes was already common in the late 15th- and early 16th-century paintings, despite a general tendency to aim for faithful and naturalistic representation. In the Renaissance paint- ing - as, for that matter, in the figurative arts of all centuries - the representation of reality is consistently filtered, for obvious aesthetic reasons, through the artist's personal view. With the advance of the Mannerism, a style naturally tending towards extravagant, decorative, and artificial representations of reality, this tendency became more emphasized and more central. Annibal Caro, a contemporary man of letters, acutely observed that the followers of "manner" gave their objects "a measure that is beyond the natural", with both painting and poetry thriving on "the immeasurable, the excessive, and the impossi- ble", for in art "excess is counted among the honest things".5 In this respect, the musical scenes in Paolo Veronese's paintings are highly instructive: here the artist's decorative, theatrical, and somewhat wayward instinct almost loses contact with reality,6 to the detriment of the realities of contemporary instrumental practice and organological detail. If, for example, we look at the consort of unusual and artificial-looking viols occupying the center of the Marriage at Cana (Paris, Musée du Louvre; fig. 4) or the instruments decorating the interior of Villa Barbaro [fig. 5], 7 we observe that Veronese freely introduced elements that were either purely invented or, at the very least, out of the ordinary if compared to the more customary forms of contemporary instruments. But the point to stress here is not so much whether these instruments are genuine or not. After all, equally bizarre viol shapes have survived in certain museums, though admittedly not such early ones.8 The point is the fact that art systematically tends to transform the elements of ordinary organological reality, whether or not the object depicted is an exceptional, or even wholly fantastic, "instrument of sound". Exception and excess, therefore, prevail over the norm; the unusual over the usual; distortion and fantastic invention over strict imitation; the creation of theatrical tableaux over the ordered representation of reality.9 In overlooking such consi- derations the musical iconographer is easily misled and prompted to reckless conclusions. Veronese himself alerts us to the risk, as we read in the records of his testimony before the Inquisition, when in July 1573 he was summoned to explain the presence of "licentious and blasphemous" details in his Last Supper.10 To the Inquisi- tors' increasingly pressing questions, he answered with great simplicity, revealing at the same time a surprising awareness of his artistic methods: [...] We painters take the same licenses that are taken by poets and madmen; that's why I put in [... ] the figure in jester's costume holding a parrot [... ] for ornament as one usually does [...]. Christ and his apostles are there [at the Supper]; but if space is left over in the picture, I decorate it with figures, as I am commissioned to do and as my invention takes me [...]. I paint my pictures considering what seems most fitting and what my mind conceives [...]. 11 Bearing these words in mind, we will now proceed to examine our two ensembles and consider the two basic issues: the degree of realism of the two scenes (i.e., the choice and coherence of the instruments making up each group) and the authenticity of the organological detail. Regarding the first issue, one's initial impression is that the two ensembles are not so much naturalistic representations of instrumental practice as totally artificial groupings. Instead of recreating the realities of contemporary music making, the arrangements would appear to be conforming to the requirements of the subject-matter, incorporating the topoi established by the painting tradition12 and to be responding to a concept of figurative varietas consistent with the aesthetic demands of decoration.13 Artifice is particu- larly conspicuous in the right-hand group, not surprisingly that painted in the more self-willed Mannerist style of Urbino [fig. 2] . Apart from the striking variety of timbres represented in the group (clashing with what we know of the tendentially homoge- neous sonorities of 16th-century instrumental ensemble music), the most suspect and openly inconsistent feature is unquestion- ably the presence of the buccina, a common enough topos in the Assumption iconography. Here it is glaringly coupled with three string instruments (two bowed and one plucked).14 A close examination of the scene reveals that this is an assemble of small homogeneous groups and that each group, considered on its own merits, is very realistic or at least characteristic of contemporary instrumental practice. For example, the group occupying the center-right section of the scene, consisting of four angels playing the "violin", bass violin, organ, and cornett, is very plausible and seems to have been drawn from instrumental practice super organis, documented at the main churches of northern Italy from the early 16th century.15 Equally convincing is the cornett and shawm duo, an abbreviated version of one of the most widespread contemporary ensembles: the wind band of piffari. Even the buccina itself, if we disregard its symbolic value and the fact that it was most likely introduced for the sake of variety and to create a fine play of diagonal lines with the other two wind instruments, could form a "group of one" and stand for the category of trumpets. A similar reading could also apply to the left-hand group, for again the artist appears to have aimed at creating a richly varied scene, though here there are fewer evident incongruities. While such varietas was essentially motivated by aesthetic considerations, the end result was a situation of "total represen- tation", showing the full complement of instruments then in fashion, an effect that incidently well accorded with the lauda- tory Marian subject of the fresco.16 Taken together, the two choirs show eleven different instruments and as many as ten different families or typologies of instrument: violins, viols, lutes, harps, organs, flutes, cornetts, trombones, shawms, and trumpets. As for the individual organological details, their interpreta- tion is less problematic, but not without its snares. Though the representations are reasonably true to life, there are a number of inconsistencies and distortions. The most conspicuous license is the inverted ordering of the organ pipes [fig. 2]. This would appear to be neither accidental nor suggested by abstruse symbolic meaning (inappropriate, in any case, in a devotional context such as this), but merely dictated by the artist's sense of design and by the geometric and internal balance of the composition. In this way, the highest pipe (which is also dispro- portiona tely long compared to the others),17 forms a perpendicu- 41</page><page sequence="4">RIdlM/RCMI Newsletter XXI/2 Fall 1996 2.

Other licenses are: the decorative detail on the sides of the proto-violin in the left- hand group (suspect because it reappears in the details of the player's clothing); the intentional over- or under-estimation of the dimensions of certain instruments (the buccina of the right hand group, for example, is noticeably stunted when compared to the long shawm with which it crosses); and a tendency generally to introduce too many pegs and holes, a fairly common failing in contemporary fresco paintings.18 In spite of these inaccuracies and distortions, the fresco does offer elements of considerable historical and organological inte- rest. The most valuable is undoubtedly the representation of the imposing basso da b razzo in the right-hand ensemble [fig. 6], an instrument already recognizable as belonging to the violin family and displaying the shape and proportions of the mature cello, at least as far as the body is concerned.19 Our interest in this instru- ment is further heightened by the presence, in the left-hand group, of a bass (or perhaps tenor) viol clearly showing the structural attributes of its own family.20 The rarity, at this early date, of finding both instruments in the same picture (instruments as close to one another in appearance as they are distant in sub- stance) is such that for once the musical iconographer may be thankful that the artificial criterion of varietas has involuntarily furnished a valuable opportunity for comparison. 42 Notes: 1 On the history of building work at the church, see Madonna di Campagna: Pallanza (Novara, п. p., 1961), with texts by E.

What essentially distinguishes the Mannerist approach from that of the preceding tradition is the way in which the instruments are arranged. Whereas in 15th- and early 16th- century painting the angelic band is often realistically ordered either by family or by timbre (i.e. trumpets, piffari, strings), in Mannerism the anti-naturalist and aestheticist approach tends to create a disordered and theatrically arranged throng. 13 Leaving aside certain extreme cases, such as Gaudenzio's fresco at Saronno (where the freer and more imaginative grouping was dictated by the complexity of the project and the size of the painted space), the musical scenes represented in the Assumptions 43</page><page sequence="6">RIdlM/RCMI Newsletter XXI/2 Fall 1996 4.

Baroncini, '"in choro et organo': Musica, strumenti e sperimentazione in alcune cappelle dell'area veneto- padana nel XVI secolo", Strumenti, musica e ricerca. Proceedings of the International Conference Cremona, 28-29 October 1994 (Milan: Electa) in print. 16 Every available musical resource is called upon to glorify the ascending Virgin, thus offering a theoretical justification for the variety of instruments depicted (and making the criteria of selection relatively unimportant). In some way, however, it also reflects the way the patrons of the great 16th-century ecclesiastical chapels justified the variety, refinement and splendour of sound proffered in their celebrations; i.e., the greater and more sumptuous the music, the greater the praise rendered to the Lord. 17 It is also worth pointing out that the rendering of the pipes themselves is anything but exact: they are too wide (which means that fewer pipes fit in) and their lengths decrease steeply and unrealistically (clearly so as to create a jagged backdrop to the cornett-playing angel). Considering that Urbino cannot have lacked a live model in this instance (by then the church was surely of the early and high Renaissance are on the whole more realistic and closer to contemporary ensemble practice. Indeed, they are remarkably faithful at times, despite the metaphysical context into which they are projected. See, for example, all the paintings showing trios or quartets of angels playing harp, rebec (or lira da braccio ), and lute, indicated by documentary sources as one of the most common contemporary ensembles: e.g., the Assumptions by Raphael (Rome, Pinacoteca Vaticana) and Bernardino Lanino (Biella, San Sebastiano). On this subject, see also R. Baroncini, "Contributo alla storia del violino nel sedicesimo secolo: i sonadori di violini della Scuola Grande di San Rocco a Venezia", Recercare VI (1994) 61-190: 74 et passim. 14 While 16th-century instrumental practice was not averse to blending timbres, especially in liturgical contexts (a frequent combination, from the seventh decade of the century onwards, was that of "violins" plus cornetts or trombones), the buccina/lute or buccina/violin combination seems highly implausible and is utterly devoid of documentary support. 44</page><page sequence="7">Fall 1996 RIdlM/RCMI Newsletter XXI/2 equipped with an organ), this is convincing evidence that the distortions served an aesthetic and functional purpose. 18 A few examples: though the "violin" of the right-hand choir has four strings as it should (and as is consistent with the size of the fingerboard), there are six pegs in the pegbox; similarly, if we look at the wind instruments, the shawm in the same group has too many holes, whereas there seem to be no holes at all on the cornett held by the neighbouring angel (the instrument lacks its customary shape, but is recognisable as a cornett by the fact that it is side-blown). 19 However, if one looks closely, what still distinguishes it from the shape of the standard cello (and the violin family in general) is the neck and pegbox: the neck is too long (a feature typical judging from other iconographical evidence of the 16th century bass vio lin) and the pegbox is distinctly crescent-shaped and inelegant. The latter feature is shared (with rare exceptions) by most of the violin-family prototypes in the 16th-century iconographie sources. On this particular point and, more generally, on the structural characteristics of the 16th-century violin, see R.
