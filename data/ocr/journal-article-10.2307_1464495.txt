CAMPO The subjects of sacred space and pilgrimage are key topics in the comparative and critical study of religion. These phenomena are unquestionably evident in Islamic contexts,1 where-as is widely known-pilgrimage to Mecca is a religious requirement, and visita- tions to sacred sites in Medina, Jerusalem, Karbala, and many lesser shrines from Africa to Indonesia are so commonly practiced. Recent studies and events demonstrate that in modern times the feelings Mus- lims hold for their religious centers have remained constant, to say the least, and are even waxing noticeably.2 This article explores several types of significance Muslims today assign to the pilgrimage centers of Mecca and Medina. In particular, its focus is the .hajj murals that decorate the fagades of pilgrims' dwell- ings in Egypt. Standing in marked opposition to the aniconic bias of Juan E. Campo is Assistant Professor of Religious Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara, California 93106. 1 The contents of this article are based on careful analysis of thirty-six murals, located mostly in the Qena Governorate in Upper Egypt, accompanied by meetings with pil- grims, their families and friends, with painters, and with Egyptians from a variety of walks of life. Regional surveys were conducted in Greater Cairo, Suez City, and the Fayum to establish a firmer basis for comparison. Detailed information on individual items in the murals, as well as explication of a sampling of mural-texts are to be found in my doctoral dissertation (Chap. IV). 2 Since the end of the Second World War, the number of haji pilgrims from outside Saudi Arabia has grown (with some setbacks) by approximately 278%, from 266,000 in 1945 to 739,319 in 1977. The total number increased from over 1.6 million in 1977 to nearly two million in 1982, with most pilgrims coming from the Arabian Peninsula, Nigeria, Turkey, Algeria, Pakistan, Iran, Indonesia, and Iraq. In 1977, Egypt sent nearly 31,000 pilgrims, reflecting an increase of about 159% since 1966 (Long: 129-35; Robin- son: 194-95, Ruthven: 23). Nearly 100,000 Egyptians went in 1985, meaning an astounding 322% increase in just eight years (al-Ahrdm [Cairo], 30 July 1985: 6). These numbers do not include the tens of thousands of pilgrims who flock to the Hijaz at other times of the year to perform the 'umra, or Lesser Pilgrimage. Despite a slight decrease in the total number of pilgrims allowed into Saudi Arabia in 1985, we are nonetheless witnessing a major development on the world religious scene.</page><page sequence="2">286 Journal of the American Academy of Religion formal Sunni Islam3 in an overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim environment, the murals integrate the imagery of the "center out there"-to use the late Victor Turner's appellation-with the values of everyday life in the domestic context. Pilgrimage acquires an essential aspect of its sig- nificance through appropriation at the local level, at home. Viewed in this way, pilgrimage as a concept and as persistent religious practice is a formation of domestic Islam.4 Establishing a valid interpretation of what haji murals signify requires an appropriate method of analysis. This entails determining not only what they mean and to whom (semantics), but also how they mean (semiotics). It is often claimed not only that the murals are unstructured congeries, but also that they are virtually meaningless. The following discussion, therefore, examines how their meanings are structured. Pragmatic Description of Egyptian Pilgrimage Paintings Pilgrimage paintings are colorful murals drawn on the walls of houses and apartment buildings in connection with performance of the required hajj to Mecca by one or more of the occupations (male and female). The practice, though not endorsed by religious law, is followed by Muslims living on the southern and eastern rims of the Mediterranean basin, as far west as Libya and as far east as Syria and Israel-Palestine. Their heartland, however, is Egypt, where the paint- ings are concentrated in villages and neighborhoods of the Sa'id, the Fayum, the oases, and in the working class and rural-urban sections of Cairo and Suez City. They are seen less commonly in the Delta, in the cities of Egypt's Mediterranean coast, and in the settlements of the Bedouin in the Western Desert. When a pilgrim is fortunate enough to dwell in a private resi- dence, as is likely to be the case in village Egypt, the mural is com- 3 Aniconism has usually been endorsed by the Sunni legal schools, based largely on acceptance of authoritative hadfths. However, this has not prevented the occurrence of figural religious art in the past in Sunni communities. Today, the publications of even the most conservative Muslim groups are replete with figural representations. It should also be noted that Shi'a Muslims have normally held more liberal views on this subject (Paret). 4 The appellation "domestic Islam" designates the set of interpretations of Islam formed within the sphere of domestic life. It differs in locus from the 'official Islams' of the literati and ruling elites, which are centered on the palace, the madrasa, and the archive. It is also not to be regarded as identical to 'popular' or 'folk' Islam. Indeed, it is more precise than these terms because it focuses on a specific type of analytical context. Moreover, the term is intended to call into question the assumptions of those who have been led to believe that Islam is either solely a public religion, or essentially a mystical one--or that it is of such an alien and terrifying character that the utterance "domestic Islam" itself is a veritable oxymoron.</page><page sequence="3">Campo: Shrines and Talismans 287 monly situated on the fagade, around the threshold, and in the reception room. For Egyptians living in urban flats, the most likely wall space available to them for painting will be around the building threshold, in the stairwell, the balcony, or the flat's facade. Occasion- ally, one can find murals decorating places of business. In most cases, this is to be explained by the fact that it is customary in this part of the world for shops and offices to be placed on the ground floors of residen- tial buildings. Hence, the paintings are not so much connected with the business as they are with residents living in the same building. The paintings, composed of complexes of figures and Arabic epi- graphs, are done during the pilgrim's absence-usually in less than a week-late in the eleventh Islamic month of Dhfi'l-Qa'da, or early in Dhfi'l-Hijja. The custom is to have them finished in time for his (or her) return, and the attendant week of festivities, sometime after 'Id al-Adhl ( 10 Dhfi'l-HIijja). They are drawn either by a talented mem- ber of the family, or by a contracted artisan, who otherwise makes his living as a mundane house or sign painter, carpenter, art instructor, or even taxi driver. Though women commonly engage in decorating house walls with floral motifs and embroideries; pilgrimage paintings proper are predominantly a male enterprise. The monetary cost for labor and supplies ranges between thirty and sixty dollars. Alone, this may seem to be a modest sum, but given the low per capita income in Egypt ($580), and considered together with the other costs entailed by a pilgrimage-travel packages from Egypt cost between $1500 and $5000 per person, excluding tips, gifts, momentos, and homecoming festivities-a mural amounts to a sizable expenditure. In this regard, some maintain that God will eventually compensate pilgrims for their financial sacrifices. Creating a ha"j mural is a collective enterprise. The artist may use a style and motifs that bear his signature, but his project must respect the expectations of the pilgrim, his family, and the neighborhood com- munity. Society's involvement with painting content begins with the selection of the artist and continues into the choice of the particular elements to be included, the actual drawing of the mural, and even extends until after the artist has completed his work. Should the pil- grim conclude that some aspect of his mural is inappropriate, he may ask that it be changed or removed altogether.5 Something of the reciprocal nature of the relations between a community, a mural artist, and his work is evidenced in the following personal recollection by an artist in Port Said: 5 For example, a scorpion was drawn over the entrance to the guest room of a house in Naj' al-'Atiyit (near the Valley of the Kings), but was removed at the request of the pilgrim shortly after his return.</page><page sequence="4">288 Journal of the American Academy of Religion When I was a child, I was infatuated with the cinema. I would always frequent movie houses to see the heroic deeds of cowboys and the courage of the silent screen heroes of that time. The images of those heroes made an indelible impression on me. The great fascination I had for them prompted me to make chalk drawings of them on walls. I enjoyed doing this. My talent became known to the kids in the neighborhood, who started call- ing me by the nickname 'Taha the Painter'. Then, one day my neighbors called upon me to engage in a paint- ing contest with a professional painter that they were bringing in especially from Cairo to paint the house of a well-to-do .haji, and to decorate its facade with the traditional drawings. At that time there were no professional painters in Port Said. When my neighbors saw what the painter from Cairo had done, everyone said at once, "I'll bet little Taha the Painter can paint better than that." So the painter from Cairo asked them to bring this wonder child, that he might meet him. When I arrived, I took one look at the camels he had drawn, and said, "Are those camels or frogs?" Then I started to draw the camels in my own way. The painter from Cairo was astonished. He went to my father and proposed that I work with him for a monthly wage of thirty pounds. But my father refused, saying that he was preparing me to take over the [sweet] shop, and that he felt that painting pictures was a forbidden profession. (al- Akhbdr [Cairo], 7 September 1979: 12) Besides illustrating the reciprocal field of relations from which particular paintings emerge, this personal testimony also draws atten- tion to unanticipated sources for an artist's ideas (western cowboy films!), and to tensions arising from conflicting interpretations of the religious tradition. Although some would argue that pilgrimage paintings are a dying art form, the weight of empirical evidence contradicts this. A simple reading of commemorative epigraphs indicates that most extant murals have been done since 1974. Area surveys of new housing projects in Cairo and Suez City reveal that the practice is still regarded as legitimate among Egypt's baladi working class, which shares affini- ties with rural (rifi) populations in this regard. In the neighborhoods of Zaynhum and 'Ayn al-Sira (in Cairo), and in Madinat Faysal (in Suez City), one finds an average of one mural per apartment building (with fifteen to twenty domestic units in a building). Explanations for the vitality of this phenomenon will be considered below. For now, it is worth mentioning that there is little evidence of the practice in resi- dential areas inhabited by bureaucrats and technocrats (e.g., down- town Cairo, Giza, Muhandisin, Madinat Nasr), or in foreign quarters (e.g., Ma'adi and Heliopolis). Egypt's Christian population has no simi- lar practice currently, although there is evidence to suggest that Copts</page><page sequence="5">Campo: Shrines and Talismans 289 once decorated their homes with figures and epigraphs when they made pilgrimages to Jerusalem. Curiosities and Congeries: The History of their Interpretation6 European travelers have mentioned Egypt's pilgrimage paintings since the first decades of the eighteenth century. Described briefly, they generally tended to be displayed as oriental curiosities, as among the 'manners and customs' of eastern peoples. Paul Lucas wrote in 1714 that "the entrances of the houses of those who have returned [from the pilgrimage] are painted [and] embellished with various orna- ments" (Canova: 92, n.1). A century later, although the chief author of the ethnographic volume of the massive Description de l'Egypte patently refused to discuss any of Egypt's indigenous painting and sculpture (Chabrol): part 2, 395), his British contemporary, Edward W. Lane, described the murals, calling them "rude" and childlike (308, 438). Others repeated Lane's judgment, sometimes going so far as to describe them as "bizarre" and "hideous" (Klunzinger: 4-5). Euro- pean aesthetic judgments were exercised with little concern shown either for explaining the murals, or for eliciting native understandings of them. Until the twentieth century, observers simply noted that the practice contradicted formal Islamic injunctions against images. A shift in perspective can be detected in writings published since the Second World War. Though Jacques Jomier, the noted interpreter of Egyptian Islam, called the murals naive, he nonetheless proposed thatthey be understood as a kind of "poesy" that expresses popular sentiments in urban areas and villages (207). Kriss and Kriss-Heinrich, marvelous collectors of information on folk Islam in the Nile Valley and the eastern Mediterranean region, concluded that the paintings contained "memories of things seen on the pilgrimage to Mecca.... The camel and mahmal from Cairo, a train, a boat, presumably all things the painter had seen somewhere during his pilgrimage to Mecca that had impressed him" (1: 112-13). A more disciplined study of pilgrimage paintings in the Sa'id included the suggestion that they be interpreted as collective representations of semiotic nature (Canova: 91). The latest discussion of the murals, by the French art 6 The earliest mention of pilgrimage paintings that I have found to date occurs in the late sixteenth century C.E. memoirs of a Turkish official in Egypt: "This nice custom is also highly praised by wise people that one of the relatives of the person that undertakes the pilgrimage, one who is known to be sincerely devoted to him, has the Koran verse on the pilgrimage [3 Al-'Imrdn 97] inscribed with large letters on the wall of his door. Some even decorate it with embellishments and colors. Those who pass through that street will know for sure that the owner of that house has gone on the pilgrimage that year" ('Ali: 33). References to the murals in nineteenth and twentieth century literature can be found in Michot (19, n.2).</page><page sequence="6">290 Journal of the American Academy of Religion historian Jean Michot, also recognizes their communal character, but ends by stressing that they especially reflect "the Islam of the painter." This is the symbiosis of mystical and common sentiments: the restlessness and joy of the voyage, nationalism, the presence of the natural world. The Islam of Cairene pilgrims' houses consists variously of God and the evil eye, of Mecca and boats, of love for the Prophet and Egypt, of Abraham and peasants, of al-Buraq and flowers, of supplicant pilgrims and musicians, of angels and birds.... (18) Although these treatments suggest a growing awareness of the semiotic nature of the murals and strive to interpret them within the context of Egyptian social life, they nonetheless have serious shortcom- ings. Jomier intimates that the murals have little religious or political significance. Kriss and Kriss-Heinrich confuse painters with pilgrims and make a simplistic set of assumptions about the imitative character of the representations. Canova neglects to analyze the interrelation of epigraphs with figures in specific murals. Finally, lacking an appropri- ate schema for defining the rules that tacitly operate to control the arrangements of features in the murals, Michot is misled into propos- ing that, No unity is evident in the frescos. They are a constellation of scenes distributed indifferently on surfaces unbroken by doors and windows. The facade is the foundation, limiting the size of the frescos; it bears little resemblance to signification .... The designs alone speak. Since the frescos have such a fragmentary character, one must analyze the individual themes that appear in them, rather than the facades as a whole. (8) In addition to the question of order, these remarks also raise the issue of the role of the home in the constitution of a mural's signifi- cance. The following discussion, in rebuttal to Michot's views, argues on behalf of the ordering of elements in the mural to express meaning and on behalf of the integration of domestic space into its general semantic field. Semiotic Analysis For many Egyptian Muslims-with important exceptions--haj" murals possess at least some linguistic coherence. One of the first sorts of explanation encountered in the field is that the murals are "announcements" ('ildndt) that someone has succeeded in performing the pilgrimage duty. But what regularities govern these announce- ments? What sorts of statements do they proclaim? Given the effec- tiveness of wide-ranging neighborhood networks for circulating information, certainly the murals must do more than function like a billboard advertisement.</page><page sequence="7">Campo: Shrines and Talismans 291 The paintings consist of two chief semiotic classes: epigraphic for- mulae in Arabic and iconic figures. While murals composed exclu- sively of one class or the other may occasionally be encountered, as a rule both classes are used in concert. Epigraphs and figures occur together in groups, or complexes, of several types: associations (items a, b, c, etc. are related by a single perceptually compelling trait), col- lections (items a, b, c, etc. differ, but complement each other in an obvious way), chains (items a, b, c, etc. are weakly linked by some remote similarity), and oppositions (items a and b, etc. are linked by their opposition to each other).7 Complexes contribute to the forma- tion of semantic fields, which in turn may contain specific sorts of semantic enclaves (Wallis: 22-23, 27, 59-60). For example, in Figure 1, the trees and potted plant form a semantic enclave constituted as an associative complex. The Arabic inscriptions comprise another associative complex. Plants and inscrip- tions, together with the figures of the birds, the palanquin-bearing camel, the plane, and the boat together constitute a collection com- plex wherein the obvious differences are nonetheless complementary within the indigenous frame of reference. Relating the pilgrim's house to this mural raises the possibility of establishing an even more inclu- sive semantic field. The reference to "house" (bayt) in the long inscription over the boat-"God requires of mankind the performance of the pilgrimage to the house if they are able to do so"-suggests a chain or collection complex relationship between the Ka'ba in Mecca and the pilgrim's home. Moreover, an obvious complementarity exists in Arabic between the phrase hajj al-bayt in the inscription and the phrase bayt al-hadji "the pilgrim's home." There is also an implicit relationship between the dwelling and the iconic figure of the mosque, which in this mural is intended to represent not the mosque in Mecca, but the Prophet's mosque in Medina-his home and burial place. In light of just this one example, views such as those of Michot are open to serious question. The same case can be made with most of the other paintings. 7 In seeking terminology suitable for describing regularities in the murals, I have adopted Vygotsky's idea of the complex, a mode of human thought that lies between thinking in congeries and concepts (Chap. V). Inhelder and Piaget's concept of the place of the collection in the development of logical thought is analogous (Chap. I). L6vi-Strauss' use of the term bricolage to discuss both mythical thought and art is illumi- nating, but he does not develop a useful typology of relations (16-33).</page><page sequence="8">292 Journal of the American Academy of Religion 6"CN:r %Nib~ lift j a dW ~ W 40 ~ e ;ii' aV 4ft2 FIGURE 1. Hajj mural in Imbaba, Cairo.</page><page sequence="9">Campo: Shrines and Talismans 293 The epigraphs are formulaic in nature. Drawn from the Quran, everyday speech, and from popular ritual utterances, they are brief, energetic in tone, and sometimes rhyme. That many of them carry proper liturgical designators; e.g., basmala, kalima, talbiyya, tasliyya, takbir, etc., underscores their ritual character. Even lengthier epi- graphs, such as commemorative inscriptions, can be reduced to clus- ters of formulaic units. Iconic figures likewise possess a quotidian character, usually showing only the most basic concern for perspec- tive, proportion, and detail. Expression of feeling and immediate com- munication of meaning appear to be the dominant concerns in this regard. Despite the figures' impressionistic nature, both they and the epi- graphs are generally placed on the fagade of a house or apartment with a sensitivity to balance and an awareness of architectural features. They respect the natural limitations of a wall, and frequently are ori- ented towards openings, tending to cluster around doorways and win- dows. When a mural extends into the home, it gravitates towards the areas where guests are received, not to the most private areas. The marked opposition of inside: outside, typical of domestic space in this part of the world, must not be overlooked in analyzing the murals, which can often function to make what is private public and what is public private. The dwelling place itself participates in the semiotic system that gives coherence to a mural in a way that distinguishes it from the semantic vacuum of an artist's sketchbook or canvas. Together with epigraphs and figures, it constitutes an important part of a painting's semantic field.8 In sum, hajj murals are best classified as three-dimensional, highly metaphoric forms of discourse. Although they are not as fragmented as Michot and others have assumed, neither are they elaborate legal or philosophical discourses. Their modality is more like that of certain types of myth, epic, poetry, and ritual, without being completely iden- tical to any one of these forms of expression. Semantic Analysis and Transformations The sign units contained in each semiotic class can be organized as a lexicon divided into five thematic groupings per class, making ten groups in all. In order of frequency, epigraphic formulae consist of those concerning: 8 The colors used in murals may also contribute to their significance. White represents ritual purity and sinlessness, while green stands for the Prophet, holiness, and the gar- dens of paradise. The color blue is believed to contribute to the prevention of evil and misfortune.</page><page sequence="10">294 Journal of the American Academy of Religion I. God II. The Prophet Muhammad III. Pilgrimage and Holy Places IV. Divine Blessing V. Victory over Adversity Among the houses surveyed, the most popular epigraphs in Cate- gory I were: 1, "In the name of God, most compassionate and merciful" (the basmala); la, "God is most great!" (the takbir); and lb, "There is no god but God" (the kalima, or first part of the shahdda). Epigraph Category II was dominated by: 1 and la, invocations of blessing upon the Prophet (the tasliyya); and 2, "Muhammad is God's messenger" (the second part of the shahdda). Leading epigraphs in III were: 1, "God requires of mankind the performance of the pilgrimage (.hajj) to the House [of God in Mecca] if they are able to do so" (Quran 3 Al-'Imrdn 97); la, "A pious pilgrimage, sin forgiven, a worthy effort"; and 2, "Whoever visits my [Muhammad's] tomb [in Medina] deserves my intercession." In IV, the chief epigraph was the apparently enig- matic command, "Enter them [or it] securely, in peace!" (Quran 15 al- H.ijr 46, discussed below). Category V was led by: 1, "Truly, we have granted you a manifest victory" (Quran 48 al-Fath 1); and 2, "O Lord, your protection!" In general order of frequency, iconic figures included representa- tions of: I. Pilgrimage and Holy Places II. General Islamic Religious Motifs III. Egyptian Culture IV. Trees, Plants, and Animals V. Arabesque Designs and Talismanic Figures Iconic Category I was led by representations of the Ka'ba in Mecca and the Medina mosque, followed by pilgrims, the mahmal (a camel-borne palanquin), modes of transportation (planes, boats, trains, cars), and Abraham's sacrifice. Stereotyped mosques, people at prayer, al-Buraq (the miraculous steed of the Prophet), and new moons were predominant in II. Category III included images of musicians and dancers, horsemen and soldiers (cf. Taha the Painter's cowboys), huntsmen, family scenes, and replications of artifacts and monuments from pharaonic Egypt. Leading figures included in Category IV were flowers, palm trees and acacias, birds, and camels. Finally, an assort- ment of geometric figures, rosettes, hand prints, and anthropomorphic statuettes (al-'arayyis) composed the contents of Category V. Even from this cursory summary of painting contents several important points emerge. One is that the event of the haji is compre- hended in discourses that include statements about God, the impor- tance of the Prophet and his city (the visit to which is not officially part</page><page sequence="11">Campo: Shrines and Talismans 295 of the hajj requirement), national identity, and the values of commu- nal and family life. Furthermore, although the murals are blatantly iconic in character, they nonetheless respect orthodox injunctions against figural representations of God and Muhammad. Indeed, one can go so far as to say that on the surface the semantic units of each semiotic class harmonize well with the body of Sunni Muslim beliefs, values, and practices. However, the particularity of the murals, aside from their iconicity, arises from their tacit meanings and transformations. The thematic divisions in each class are not mutually exclusive. Nor is one class completely independent of the other. For example, the degree of unity attained among epigraphic formulae becomes apparent when it is recalled that God (I) is the ultimate agent of bless- ing (IV) and victory (V), the creator of space (sacred and otherwise) and authority behind the institution of pilgrimage rites (III), and that Muhammad (II)----founder of the community and mosque at Medina, pilgrimage reformer, and conqueror of Mecca-is his instrument. Within the class of iconic figures, flowers (IV) can be linked with little difficulty to talismanic figures (V), to native definitions of femininity and family life (III), and to the symbology of holy places (I) as gardens and earthly bits of paradise-to give but one example. On the more abstract level of semiotic classes, the relationship between iconic figures and oral or written discourse should be recog- nized. Given the high rate of illiteracy in Egypt (55%-60%, especially pronounced in areas where haji murals are most common), the iconic capacity of Arabic script itself becomes apparent; i.e., it comes to resemble that which it signifies apart from its explicit content. Thus, when an illiterate believer beholds an Arabic word or formula in the mural, he or she may comprehend it as a manifestation of God and his Prophet or as a representation of blessing. The words can not be read for content in the usual way. Virtually any selection from the Quran or hadith in such instances functions to link the here-and-now with sacred centers of time and space through subtle notions of resemblance. Pilgrimages can be comprehended as a type of rite de passage, whereby pilgrims are ideally transformed into a new condition-attain a new status-as a consequence of their journey to a sacred center (Turner). This holds true for the Muslim pilgrim, who, as we know from the formulae employed in the murals, becomes a special per- son-as he was on the day of his birth-free of sin and deserving of heaven. His new status is indicated by the honorable title now attached to his name: "Hajj."9 9 In view of points that will be raised in the last section of this study, it is important to</page><page sequence="12">296 Journal of the American Academy of Religion The murals interpret this transformation in terms of the localized belief system: the pilgrim, loaded with surplus blessing (baraka) from the holy land, has become a saint, or nearly so. Correspondingly, his home has been transformed into a center of blessing for the local com- munity. This double transformation can be illustrated by shifting the semantic analysis from the level of lexicon to that of the actual utterance. Over the threshold of a pilgrim's house in al-Ballas (Figure 2) was written the following collection complex of epigraphic formulae:1' IV.1 II.la I.ld Commemorative Epigraph + III.la V.3 (cont.) V.3 The lengthy commemoration proclaims: "In the name of God, most compassionate and merciful. HaIjj Sa'd al-IHjjj 'Abd al-HIa'it made the Greater and Lesser Pilgrimages, circumambulated God's Sacred House, and visited the tomb of al-Mustafa [Muhammad], blessings and peace be upon him. He made the pilgrimage in 1975 A.D./ 1395 A. H." (Italics indicate use of formulae I.1 and II.1a respectively.) In this text, the individual pilgrim's experience of the haji is objec- tified in a highly formulaic statement that explicitly ties him to the domestic spaces of Mecca (God's house) and Medina (Muhammad's house-tomb). His name, furthermore, is situated on a level with those of God and the Prophet. The placement of the names of God (I.ld) and Muhammad (II.la) again to the upper right and left sides of the commemorative text underscores the importance of what has hap- pened to the pilgrim. Few believers have the satisfaction of seeing themselves, represented by name, placed in such august company. The transformation of the pilgrim is further substantiated by the hadfth formula (III.1a) that proclaims that through the pilgrimage a person's sins are forgiven. Where is the evidence for the transformation of the pilgrim's home? In part, it is to be found in formula IV.1, situated immediately above the commemorative text, classed under the semantic category note that this title-also used in addressing elders with respect-is subject to abuse. Egyptian politicians who have never been to the Hijaz use the appellation as a vote getting ploy. Anwar al-Sadat, Egypt's late "believing president," reportedly went by the assumed name "Hiijj Muhammad Nfir al-Din" as a young adult, without actually having performed the pilgrimage (Haykal: 39). 10 Specifically, the epigraphs are: IV.1. "Enter them [or it] securely in peace." II.la. "Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace." I.ld. "God, may he be exalted." III.la. "A pious pilgrimage and sin forgiven." V.3. "Patience is the key to relief."</page><page sequence="13">Campo: Shrines and Talismans 297 loAJJ "4 L) iis FIGURE 2. Detail of mural inscriptions over threshold in al-Ballds, Upper Egypt.</page><page sequence="14">298 Journal of the American Academy of Religion of blessing. The key word in it is the pronoun "them" (actually the feminine singular pronomial object suffix -hd, which also functions as a non-human plural pronoun). In its familiar quranic context (15 al-H.ijr 46), this statement refers to paradisical gardens reserved for the faith- ful in the hereafter. In the present context, a double entendre is clearly involved. Read in terms of its semantic field-i.e., in relation to its placement over the house threshold-the pronoun can also be understood in its singular meaning: "Enter it [literally 'her'] securely in peace." Interpreted this way, the pronoun must refer to the house (fem. ddr) itself. Aided by the ambiguous use of a pronoun in a quranic verse, the pilgrim's home is transformed from everyman's house- meaningful under the normal conditions of female sacrality (horma) and male honor (sharaf)--into a paradisical sanctuary. Thus, it enters into symbolic association with the house of the Prophet (in Medina) and Sacred House of God (in Mecca). The iconic figure of the Medina mosque, situated above and to the right of the doorway (between two windows) so as to form the center of the entire mural, restates these associations. Among the epigraphs inscribed on the mosque are labels such as "The Noble Garden" and "My garden." These interpretations neither stretch the case, nor are they idio- syncratic. They are congruent with the persistent Egyptian Muslim formulations of the holy man figure as a warrior-saint-a formulation rooted deeply in the histories of Islam, Mediterranean Christianity, and the Hellenism of antiquity. Having successfully overcome the challenges of a difficult journey to the holy land, loaded now with baraka and gifts from the Hijaz, the Egyptian pilgrim is considered by his countrymen to have the "right stuff" for sainthood. When he returns, he is feted in much the same way as a holy man is during his saint's day (mulid), with communal processions, feasts, Quran recita- tions, and dhikrs. His home--cleansed and newly decorated with cal- ligraphy, pilgrimage motifs, paradisical scenes, soldiers, horsemen and lions-now bears resemblance to only one other kind of structure in the Egyptian landscape: the saint's shrine, a local pilgrimage center and source of blessing (see Kriss and Kriss-Heinrich: I, plates 48-55; Castel and 'Ali). In its transformed condition, the house is like the shrine, is like the sacred centers in Medina and Mecca, is like Paradise. The murals are instrumental to accomplishing this transformation. Furthermore, by the rules of sympathetic magic (like produces like, and the idea of contagion), the murals generate more blessing for the household, for its visitors, and for its neighbors. In general, the system of semiotic relations that produces meaning</page><page sequence="15">Campo: Shrines and Talismans 299 in the murals is bi-directional." It objectifies the condition of the pil- grim and his home at the same time that it subjectifies forces associ- ated with God, the Prophet, and the holy land. Without the struggle to create religious discourse in its domestic modality, embodying this bi-directionality, the continued existence of centers "out there" becomes doubtful. They must be appropriated on the local level. One more symbolic transformation accomplished by pilgrimage murals deserves consideration. In the case of the al-Ballds house dis- cussed above, it is suggested by the incorporation of epigraph V.3a, the placement of rosettes on either side of the doorway, and the use of a lion-with-sword-versus-serpent figure on the far right hand side of the mural. Identical or analogous items--such as spells against the evil eye, petitions for God's protection, hand prints, snakes, crocodiles, and scorpions--occur in other murals, sometimes becoming the dominant features. Thus, in addition to resembling the epigraphs and figures drawn on saints' shrines, the inventory of mural components is also strikingly similar to motifs used on zdr amulets (Kriss and Kriss- Heinrich: II, Chap. I and pp. 149-55; Schienerl) and in tattoo art (Keimer; Kossiakov). Each of these art forms is understood by rural and rural-urban Egyptians to promote the healing of body and soul, and serves as a device for appeasing or repelling demonic forces. The use of amulet and tattoo motifs on the faqade of a pilgrim's house seems to be a puzzling practice until seen in light of the changed status of the pilgrim and his household. On the one hand, talismans can be viewed as complementary to the function of the warrior-saint figure, popularly recognized as a con- queror of demonic beings. On the other, with the marked rise in sta- tus of the pilgrim in the eyes of the local community, and the concomitant surplus of baraka obtained from the visit to Mecca and Medina, the privatized sacrality (horma) of the household is exposed to the danger of public envy (commonly identified by the terms al-hasad and al-'ayn). The talismanic element in the murals, therefore, acts as a defensive instrument against any demonic powers that would threaten the household with illness and misfortune, believed to arise from this envy. The foregoing discussion advances an understanding of an icono- graphic modality of religious expression in an Islamic society. It argues for the presence of meaning in an Egyptian milieu where other observers (Muslims and non-Muslims) have claimed there was little or none. The meaning is exhibited by reducing the assemblage of mural components to a "treasury" of two semiotic classes and ten semantic 11 Munn's study, which focuses on the relationship between native Australian myth and territory, is the source of this term.</page><page sequence="16">300 Journal of the American Academy of Religion categories. The complexes and fields of meaning that components combine to form in the murals are integrated with the spatial features and significance of Muslim homes--particularly with native ideas of domestic sacrality (horma), honor (sharaf), and blessing (baraka). Haji paintings perform transformations of domestic space such that it comes to be manifestly comprehended in relation to holy places and talismans. Context, Comparison, Explanation With such an analytical framework, it is possible to classify the pil- grimage murals according to whether epigraphs or iconic figures are dominant and whether they stress the symbolism of shrines or of talis- mans. Figure 1 exemplifies a type wherein figures and epigraphs are balanced to stress shrine symbolism and the power of blessing. Another class of murals emphasizes epigraphy, their owners proudly proclaiming faithful adherence to Sunni aniconic values. Yet others stress talismanic and apotropaic figures and formulae, suggesting a dis- trustful attitude to neighbors or the outside world. Attention should also be given to regional variations and the pref- erences of individual artists. For example, pharaonic images are most likely to be found in murals near the tourist sites of Luxor and the Valley of the Kings. The painter 'Ali Sayyid 'Ali of al-Ball.s prefers to use lion figures and al-Buraq in his work. Further afield, representa- tions of the Dome of the Rock occur in .haj murals on the West Bank, while Syrian examples often contain images of the cypress tree. Much work remains to be done in the field to elicit native commentary on individual items that occur in the murals. Rather than providing an elaborate inventory of informant inter- pretations of individual motifs, however, the remainder of this paper raises two more basic issues: the explanation of the occurrence of .haj" murals, and the definition of their place in relation to other Islamic discourses in Egypt. One of the leading theses of structuralism is that "meaning is the effect of non-meaning" (Descombes: 95). In the field of religious phe- nomena, where the pilgrimage paintings have their place, non-mean- ing is not to be taken simply as an a priori "clearing," or as a semantically neutral space from which meaning emerges. Rather, it entails the humanly conceived threat of meaninglessness. For Egyp- tian pilgraims, their families, and neighbors, this threat appears in sev- eral guises: as death, illness, or personal misfortune occurring in relation to the pilgrimage itself; or in the concern that the sheer number of pilgrims combined with the passage of time will diminish the value of one's own personal accomplishment. Meaninglessness</page><page sequence="17">Campo: Shrines and Talismans 301 might appear as disenchantment whenever the anticipated experi- ence of the sacred journey and of the holy sites has been trivialized by bureaucracy and unabashed commercialism. Thus, for all the ideal- ized accounts of the pilgrimage to Mecca (e.g., the texts excerpted by Cragg and Speight: 56-63), there are most certainly some akin to that of the modern Iranian pilgrim, Jalal Al-e Ahmad. I'm now sitting on the second level of the outer corridor, writing. From up here the Ka'ba is just half the size I had imagined. That devotee of God who was the architect of this new outer corridor was evidently unaware of the fact that when you destroy proportion you change the architecture. The Ka'ba is still the same size, but they've made the outer corridor twice as wide, and twice as high. How about destroying the Ka'ba itself and making it higher and larger? Out of reinforced concrete, no doubt? ... Neon fills the streets everywhere. It's even on top of the House's minarets and the Ka'ba itself. When it pleased God to have a house built on the surface of this land, he should have real- ized that the land would one day fall into the hands of the Saudi government, and that its doors and walls would be covered with neon because of the exigencies of oil exportation. . . . Why shouldn't they order specially designed lamps from these compa- nies that would be worthy of such grandeur, and not have even the House of God become a common consumer for Penn- sylvania? Doing things this way means tainting even the world of the unseen for company profits. (Al-e Ahmad: 58-59) Finally, the threat of meaninglessness can be encountered in the guise of developments witnessed by Egyptians in their recent history: the failures of revolutionary Arab nationalism, the loss of wars and land to Israel, a crisis in moral leadership, the weaknesses of the national infrastructure in the areas of housing, jobs, and education--compli- cated by a phenomenal population growth rate (nearly 3% annually) and severe urban crowding. Thus, while the murals strive to represent centered visions of an ideal reality using authentic Islamic symbols, they are largely produced out of a decentered practical reality which they seek to mask or convert. Aside from the marked improvement of conditions under which the pilgrimage is performed today, other secondary factors that con- tribute to the occurrence and spread of the pilgrimage painting phe- nomenon in recent times include the numerical growth and urbanization of those sectors of the Egyptian population who assign greatest validity to the practice; the widespread availability of paints in a panoply of colors; and an increase in the number of painter-arti- sans resulting from the Egyptian government's promotion of commer- cialism and tourism. The iconographic heritage from Egypt's past- consisting of African, pharaonic, Hellenistic, and Christian strands-</page><page sequence="18">302 Journal of the American Academy of Religion should also be counted as a contributing factor, so long as due caution is exercised to avoid resorting to a fallacious genetic explanation. However, none of these factors alone sufficiently explains the phenomenon. As pilgrimage paintings represent one form of the quest for authenticity and integrity in the modern era, they have their place alongside other prominent Islamic discursive formations, namely those of the rulers and of militant opposition groups (Ajami: 50-75, 116-19, 164-200). Unlike the Islam of the rulers (who ignore the paintings), they do not serve to legitimate the power of the few who, in actuality, enjoy the material and spiritual comforts of the west at the expense of the many. Unlike the Islam of the militant opposition groups (who object to the paintings as illicit products of innovation [bid'a] or disbe- lief [kufr]), they do not urge millennial emigration and combat to real- ize the perfect Islamic community, nor do they represent a retreat to the home as a defensive enclave amidst an impure world.12 Rather, the paintings testify to a concern for linking mundane domestic space and its realm of familial values with Islamically formulated definitions of sacred power and space. Indeed, one can argue that domestic dis- courses of Islam, such as those expressed in the murals, not only under- lie the discursive formations of rulers and opposition groups, but also contribute to their possibility. For it is in the home that Islam is first inculcated, regardless of the trajectories it later takes in the lives of believers and their cultures.13 REFERENCES Ajami, Fouad 1981 The Arab Predicament: Arabic Political Thought and Practice Since 1967.
