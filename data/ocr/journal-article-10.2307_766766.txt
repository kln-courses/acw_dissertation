<plain_text><page sequence="1">Classicism in Romanesque Sculpture in Tuscany CARL SHEPPARD University of Minnesota Of the Italian schools of Romanesque sculpture, that of the Val d'Arno, Tuscany, is perhaps the least well known. The major texts published soon after World War I: Walter Biehl, Toskanische Plastik des fruhen und hohen Mittel- alters, Leipzig, 1926, and Mario Salmi, La Scultura Roma- nica in Toscana, Florence, 1928, remain essential to any study of the material. Since that time only a few aspects of Tuscan Romanesque sculpture have been treated in per- iodical literature-in particular, problems of style, date or iconography of a single or restricted group of monuments. Major attention has been given to the question of antece- dents for the style of Niccolo Pisano,' a subject that, of necessity, deals with Romanesque sculpture as ancillary to another period rather than for itself. Tuscan sculpture has also become the focus of several investigations concerning the origins of other schools of sculpture, particularly those of Norman Italy and Provence.2 In neither of these studies has the investigation considered Tuscan monuments in their own context; rather, the material is cited without further interest. General observations backed by detailed investigation, have recently emphasized the importance in Sicily/Cam- pania and Rome of a revival of interest in Roman antiquity and in Early Christian art.3 The same phenomenon oc- cured in Tuscany. The need for a style in stone carving capable of utilizing anthropomorphic forms obliged sculp- tors to turn to the only source at hand for inspiration- Late Antique and Early Christian sculptures. The earliest historiated Romanesque sculpture of Tus- cany is the pulpit executed by Guglielmus between 1159 and 1161 for the Cathedral of Pisa, now in the Cathedral of Cagliari, Sardinia (Figures 1, 2, and 3).4 For their general style, he and his contemporaries looked to antique Roman and Early Christian and Byzantine sculptures already in Tuscany. Sculptors active around 1180 returned to similar sources and created a variation on the established manner; and for a brief period at the beginning of the thirteenth century sculptors so completely assimilated current By- zantine style that it dominated their work. In each instance there was but a moment of purity before assimilation by the Romanesque aesthetic. The recurrent exploitation of classic Roman and Early Christian material for the tech- niques of relief carving in stone and marble and the con- sequent carry-over of stylistic traits are more frequent in Tuscany than anywhere else in the west. Typically in Italy throughout the twelfth century, artists struggled for ways to express the developments in mediaeval thought that in- corporated Aristotelian concepts.5 There is ample evidence of Roman sculpture at Pisa during the twelfth century. Among numerous examples, one can cite the antique sarcophagus of the Countess Bea- trice, mother of Matilda, Marchioness of Tuscany, in the Campo Santo; the sarcophagus which serves as a monument to Buschetto on the facade of the Cathedral; and the frag- ment used as a lintel at San Frediano. It is equally important but more difficult to demonstrate the existence of Byzantine sculpture at Pisa. Unfortunately, the bronze doors of the two side portals of the facade of the Cathedral have disappeared. The set that came to Pisa in 1100 as a gift from Godfrey de Bouillon6 had a series of scenes in niello of the "Life of Christ." Certainly By- zantine in origin, these doors were similar to ones of this date in Southern Italy, e.g., those at the Sanctuary of San Michele on Monte San Gargano. The second set at Pisa was part of the booty taken from Mallorca in 1114.7 There remains, however, a very important group of sculptures in the Byzantine manner at Pisa which can probably be dated late in the decade of the 1150's.8 These decorate the portals of the Baptistery, particularly those at the east and north, and include all the reliefs on the jambs, lintels, and archivolts. At first glance, the flanking columns of the east portal appear so classical that they resemble reused second-century examples (Figure 4), but the terminus post quem for this sculpture is 1153, the date of the founding of the Baptistery by Diotisalvi after the sack of Amalfi by the Pisan fleet. The additional evidence for the construction of the Baptistery is insufficient to establish a terminus ante quem. Evidence of a more circumstantial nature is provided by analysis of the decorative reliefs of the portal-columns which are characterized by rich foliate motifs or rinceaux. The earliest dated example of this type of decoration in Tuscany is the lintel of Sta Maria, the Pieve Nuova, at Sta Maria del Giudice, which has an inscription recording the date 1156.9 The kind of architectural decoration current in Tuscany before this time can be seen on the facades of the Cathedral of Empoli, the Badia at Fiesole, the church at San Miniato al Monte, Florence, and the east end of the 185</page><page sequence="2">FIGURE 1.

Cathedral, Cagliari. 186</page><page sequence="3">Cathedral of Pisa. The carving of cornices, window and portal frames, and of capitals is very precise, sharp and angular. Mouldings cut so incisively that they produce strong black and white contrasts give a linear effect. The incrustations covering these buildings are laid out in de- signs which also stress linearity and angularity. Compare the execution of the decorative reliefs covering the columns of the Pisan Baptistery with those on the outer face the porch at the Cathedral of Lucca (Figs. 4 and 5), particularly the one attached to the pier on the right of the central arch dated before 1204.10 The rinceaux on the examples at Pisa give the effect of undulating freely over a surface because of the considerable use of modeling, under- cutting and drilling. The carving on the baptistery columns is rather shallow along the lower part of the shafts and increases gradually as it rises. In the brillant sun, the de- coration remains as sharp to the eye at the summit as at the base. The sculpture at Lucca lacks the subtle exploitation of light, of position and degree of relief found at Pisa. Instead of emphasizing the variations and undulations of the leafy forms, the sculptor maintained the same degree of relief for each part of the rinceaux which he executed without undercutting. He also stressed solidity of form and sim- plified the rinceaux so that the abstract design of the motif is well defined. Here the classicism of the Pisan sculptures has been transformed by Romanesque prin- ciples (Figure 5). There is no way to ascertain the origin of the anony- mous master who carved the columns of the Baptistery. He nevertheless indicated his relation to Byzantine art by inserting among the rinceaux of the south column of the eastern baptistery portal three female figures. One sits playing a stringed instrument; the other two appear to be searching for flowers in the forest of acanthus leaves (Figure 4). Stylistically and technically, these graceful fig- ures are similar to those of the unmistakably Byzantine reliefs on the jambs of the portal. Since there are no known Byzantine examples of architectural decoration in the twelfth century which are similar to these columns and reliefs, one might suppose that the Baptistery master copied from an antique fragment. In the 1825 catalogue of the collection of classical sculptures gathered in the Campo Santo, a plate reproduces a possible prototype. The close- ness of the resemblance suggests that the Baptistery col- umns might even have been copied from the original reproduced in the catalogue.1 In many ways, the work of Guglielmus and his con- temporaries is related to the decoration of the east Bap- tistery portal. All the decorative details of the Cagliari pulpits (Figures 1, and 3) belong to the foliate style initi- ated at Pisa. The design of the capitals, for instance, is derived from the rinceaux of the Pisan columns instead of from the normal Tuscan prototypes, classical Corinthian or FI(UJRE 4.

Among the mouldings decorating the pulpits, two in particular belong to the foliate style which could have derived from the Baptistery portals. The motif on the beveled edge of the crowning moulding (Figure 3) consists of a vine meander interpreted as a definite pattern of repeated circles containing a variety of leaves connected by tendrils. On the underside of the cornice the second motif, repeated with little variation consists of a single five-petaled flower enclosed by a stem or tendril (Figure 1). The intarsia decorations (Figure 3) covering the back- grounds of many of the narrative panels of the pulpits also belong to the same foliate style and are essentially adapta- tions of the two motifs just described. In summation, a plausible relationship exists between the work of Gugliel- mus and that of the artists who carved the reliefs for the east portal of the Baptistery. Both similarities of technique and an identity of decorative vocabulary link them stylis- tically. Yet in spite of those points of contact between the work at Cagliari and the sculptures of the Baptistery portals, the figure-styles have little in common. Occasionally, figures such as Christ in the "Betrayal" at Cagliari and the Christ of the "Harrowing of Hell" at the Baptistery share similar stances, gestures, and proportions, but these coincidences do not establish the Baptistery portals as the exclusive source of the figure-style at Cagliari. From the available evidence, it seems that the Baptistery sculptures stimu- lated Guglielmus to produce a series of historiated bas- reliefs. But probably his lack of interest in elements essen- tially un-Romanesque in feeling explains his failure to emulate the figure-style. The Cagliari pulpit and Guglielmus stand at the begin- ning of a school which continued its activity until the end of the twelfth century. Dated monuments establish the following chronology of the work of this school: pulpit, Cathedral of Cagliari, 1159-61; pulpit, San Ginesio, San Gennaro, 1161; lintel and capitals, Sant'Andrea, Pistoia, 1166;12 lintel, San Bartolomeo in Pantano, Pistoia, 1167;13 and the pulpit, San Michele, Groppoli, 1193.14 Other mon- uments of the same school include fragments of a pulpit from the Cathedral of Pistoia (Figure 6), now in the Canonical Museum,15 the pulpit of the Cathedral of Vol- terra,16 the lectern group of an Evangelary pulpit, Cathe- dral of Pescia, and the two lectern groups from San Paolo 188</page><page sequence="5">All'Orto, Pisa. These works are all united by type of mon- ument, figure-style technique, decorative motifs, and by iconography. Certain peculiarities in the treatment of the human fig- ure which differentiate this Tuscan sculpture from that of other Romanesque schools appeared first at Cagliari (Figure 3). Characteristically, body proportions tend to stockiness; facial types appear rather squarish and symmetrical, with the eyes drilled and filled with dark green paste or stone; and the correct anatomical relation of the knees to the rest of the body is never expressed plastically. Even in the large, strongly projecting figures of the lectern groups, either the point where the knee breaks the drapery is so low or the saliency so slight that the lower part of the limbs appears to dangle (Figure 2). In the narrative scenes at Cagliari this characteristic feature recurs in the flying angels of the "Ascension," the hovering Gabriel of the "Annunciation," and the kneeling apostle on the lower right in the "Trans- figuration." Only a few changes took place during the life of the style. For example, in the "Visitation" relief from the former pulpit of the Cathedral of Pistoia (Figure 6), a carving dated slightly later than the work of Guglielmus, the drapery, especially that of Elizabeth, shows a more devel- oped concern with pattern. During the last quarter of the twelfth century, a new style of sculpture began to rival that of the established school. The earliest date for this style, 1180, appears in an inscription on the lintel of the main portal of the Pieve at San Cassiano a Settimo- a lintel signed by Biduinus, who also engraved his name on the relief of the "Entry into Jerusalem" (Figure 7) in the court of the Palazzo Mazzarosa, Lucca-and on the well-known sarcophagus in the Campo Santo, Pisa.'7 Still another "Entry" carved on the lintel from San Leonardo al Frigido, now in The Cloisters, New York, is also attributed to him.18 The new style grew naturally from that established dur- ing the late fifties. Distinguished by a closer relationship to Early Christian sculpture than to Antique or Byzantine models, the sculpture also emphasized new subject matter and appeared on different types of monuments. Besides revivals of Early Christian themes, the most important new subject is the "Entry into Jerusalem." Not a single pulpit, so prevalent in the older tradition, can be associ- ated with the new style which was favored for the decora- tion of lintels. Relief sculpture was also used for baptismal fonts replacing the usual intarsia panels. Biduinus and his colleagues used sarcophagi of the fourth century, both arcaded and narrative, as their primary sources. In the Mazzarosa relief (Figure 7), Biduinus organized the drapery in loops and swirls which look like the twistings of tape or rope. Many small components in high relief create bold patterns, features of Early Christian technique. Biduinus found another device for representing a crowd whereby people are placed in planes behind instead of above one another. To some extent at Cagliari in the scene of the "Ascension," Guglielmus had already achieved some recession of planes, but there the result is restricted to staccato shifts in the degrees of relief. Biduinus did not employ the device to define space, which would have been contrary to Romanesque principles; he simply modeled the figures in the background in lower relief, while the spatial definition remained ambiguous. The unfinished Baptismal font at Calci (Figure 8) and the well-published font at San Frediano, Lucca, stand even closer to Early Christian sculpture than does the work of FIGURE 7. "Entry into Jerusalem," Mazzarosa Palace. Lucca. 189</page><page sequence="6">Biduinus. The elaborate drapery patterns typical of Biduinus are simplified, and the projection of the folds is greatly exaggerated. For both monuments, the motif of single figures under an arcade is used as a compositional device. The whole of the Calci relief is organized this way. At San Frediano the section of the base signed by Master Robertus follows the same disposition.19 Related to this style is the only large work of bronze remaining in Tuscany from the Romanesque period. Doubtless Bonanus, civus pisanus, was responsible for the doors of the San Ranieri portal of the Cathedral of Pisa.20 The shift from marble to clay and bronze may, however, account in part for the differences between the Pisan style of Bonanus and that of his contemporaries. Extremely pliable as a medium, clay proved ideally suitable for im- plementing the new style and its potential for abstraction. Bonanus adapted the style of the Calci and San Frediano fonts to his medium and produced a lively shorthand modelled in clay to describe his narrative events (Figure 9). The San Ranieri portals must date, then, somewhere near 1180 but before 1185, the date of the bronze doors at Monreale, which show a definite shift towards Byzantine style.21 Material was at hand for Bonanus to use for this personal development since the cathedral possessed one set of Byzantine bronze doors with figurative scenes and probably a second pair, too, although not in relief. If, during the twelfth century, Byzantine sculpture served as one of the formative influences on the earliest Roman- esque style of Tuscany and again in the 1180's on the personal style of Bonanus, it exerted a dominate force at the beginning of the thirteenth century. The sculptures of the main portal of San Michele degli Scalzi, Pisa, dated 1203 by inscription, are clearly Byzantine in style.22 The Archangel Michael from the Oratory of San Giuseppe, now in the Canonical Museum at Pistoia (Figure 10), shows the complete assimilation of the style of the Christ from San Michele degli Scalzi. Both monuments were executed in the same technique, and both were conceived according to similar stylistic conventions. Other examples of this early thirteenth-century adaptation of Byzantine style in- clude the two reliefs high up on the facade of San Paolo a Ripa d'Arno. Only a slight evolution was necessary for the emergence of the style of the reliefs on the inner fagade of San Martino, Lucca, or for the style of Guido da Como as seen in his pulpit at San Bartolomeo in Pantano. The creative impulses and the commissions for sculpture during the second half of the twelfth and the early thirteenth century were all concentrated in the lower Arno Valley. One may conclude that the Tuscan Romanesque school of sculpture is Pisan in origin and development. Predictably, the next intrusion of classically inspired work in Tuscany would also be commissioned by Pisa-the Baptistery pulpit of Nic- colo Pisano. FIGURE 8.
