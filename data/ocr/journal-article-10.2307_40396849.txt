Bowman (USA) These comments about corporate strategy include ideas about research and teaching and practice and, to the extent I am able to do so, tie in some of the concepts explored in the other conference papers. The three topics - research, teach- ing, and practice - can be illuminated by three images: the helix, the human feet, and the hourglass. The ideas of images and metaphors in intellectual pursuits and corporate strategy will be further explored in their own right. Research Some may feel that research and scholarship in business administration essentially move over ground that has been covered before. Rather than circling back and forth, the posi- tion put forth here is that as this intellectual pursuit circles, it also continues to move to higher levels - hence the helix image. A first stage, going as far back as half a century, was description, and at an elementary and perhaps pedantic level. Much business -school education, including the associated re- search, followed this mode. The next major swing was toward normative or prescriptive treatment of business decisions. These normative models were drawn from applied mathematics Professor Bowman is with the Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass., USA. 100</page><page sequence="2">Corporate Strategy and Corporate Governance 101 and economics, and coincided with the Ford Foundation's re- port on business schools of the 1950s. At least in retrospect, these models, which many thought were an improvement over pedantic description, might be judged naive in their astringency or parsimony. The next loop upward in the helix is vividly illustrated by the papers presented here, and might be labeled sophisticated de- scription. The work draws on the behavioral sciences and their theories and concepts in making detailed and careful observa- tions. Most of the work, in a scientific sense, is replicable. At least some of the work is generalizable across functional, institutional, and even cultural boundaries (e.g., the work of Professor Witold Kiez√ºn, of the University of Warsaw). One possible criticism is that not as many ties to established so- cial-science theories are made as should or could be. The next and future stage of the research/intellectual helix involves both prediction and some urging. Having come from naive prescription, to sophisticated description, we should now turn to sophisticated prescription. This normative work can also be called policy and design, and can follow many paths, only some of which are suggested here. Using some of the concepts and language of this conference, we can indicate that managers and organizations do not entirely follow either "syn- optic or "muddling through" problem solving, but some com- bination or sequencing of the two polar extremes. Perhaps normative work can now be addressed to a sensible switching instrument for choice between the two. Similarly, if "prede- fined backgrounds" (nondecision) precede "energized fore- grounds" (decision), as described by Professor David Hickson and the Bradford group (1), how can we appropriately "set" the predefined backgrounds? If, as James March says, "sys- temic intelligence" dominates "calculating intelligence," how can the systemic intelligence (or, to throw it into currently fashionable anthropomorphic terms, the right hemisphere of the brain) be fed or primed? Another, and perhaps minor, illustration of this thrust would be a guide to "the optimal am- biguity" in organizational policy and strategy. Ibsen's play</page><page sequence="3">102 Edward H. Bowman (USA) The Wild Duck (or was it A Doirs House?) sadly illuminates this issue. Even Henry Mintzberg's "retrospective/emergent/ realized strategy" can benefit from some normative guides. Certainly one of the roles of leadership is to describe to its members, and make sense out of, where the organization has been going, so that the next moves defined by strategic or sys- temic intelligence - the new predefined backgrounds - will also make sense. Teaching Teaching about strategy can benefit from an approach illus- trated by Jonathan Miller's recent book The Body in Question. Miller is a British medical doctor perhaps better known for his coauthorship of the theatrical entertainment Beyond the Fringe. He makes the case that it is metaphors that have per- mitted medical science to advance. An early Greek described the heart as a lamp or a furnace; he did not have available the metaphor Harvey had, a millennium and a half later, to de- scribe the heart: a pump. The development of science, and perhaps worldly practice, may depend on effective metaphors and images. This workshop has seen two papers that use "arena" (Bradford's) and "recipe" (Professor Peter GrinyerTs) more as rich metaphors than literal objects (see the Butler et al. paper in this issue and the Grinyer and Spender paper in the previous issue of this journal). Teaching corporate strategy should productively combine theory, methodology, and practice. It is important that the teacher help - perhaps as role model - the student jump back and forth between theory and practice. It is the produc- tive interaction - sometimes reinforcement, sometimes dia- lectic - between the real and the ideal that can prime the sys- temic intelligence James March talks about. Metaphors, im- ages, and concepts are aids to decision making. Theories are used heuristically by worldly people if at all. Whereas the helix was the first image used here, the human feet will be the second. Any professional school, including</page><page sequence="4">Corporate Strategy and Corporate Governance 103 search on the food-processing and minicomputer industries has also touched on these issues (Bowman, 1978). Interesting, and I should say rather profound, changes have been taking place since professor My les Mace (1971) wrote his book Directors: Myth and Reality. He indicated that their three roles were: (1) advice and counsel, (2) encouragement of "self -discipline," and (3) action in crisis situations. The myths included the directors* hand in setting corporate strategy. If corporate strategy, prospective or retrospective, calculating or systemic, foreground or background, can be thought to in- clude: (1) choosing of environmental domains, (2) determining the nature of the interaction with these environmental domains, and (3) making the internal adjustments suggested by these choices - then corporate governance may be changing; and boards of directors may currently be more involved in cor- porate-strategy decision -making than previously. This now introduces the third image of these remarks (fol- lowing the helix for research, and the human feet for teaching). Many believe that organizations are like pyramids, with the chief executive officer (CEO) on top. I believe that in fact they are in the process of becoming more like an hourglass, with boards and board committees on top and the CEO at the neck of the hourglass. Management directors, who are employees of the company, are becoming less numerous; and Chairman Williams and the Business Roundtable both endorse and encourage this trend. Ko rn/ Ferry reports that the average board (over 500 large American companies) has 13 directors, of whom 4 are insiders and 9 are outsiders - a shift of several members toward out- siders in the last few years. (Professor George Farris's Mul- tinational Resources, Ltd., with all inside directors, will be an all but extinct species in the United States in a few years.) The directors are busier than before, meeting an average of 8 times a year and spending a total of 89 hours each year on the assignment. The question of "independent" outside directors has been the subject of discussion by the SEC as well as by other commen-</page><page sequence="5">104 Edward H. Bowman (USA) management or business schools, has a latent tension between theory and practice. Some faculty members have both feet in theory, and some have both feet in practice. Fortunately, there are two other types of faculty. A third type has one foot firmly in theory, and continually reaches the other toward various kinds of practice. This is perhaps the archetypical modern business -school professor - potentially a very fine teacher. The fourth type (and my favorite) has one foot firmly in prac- tice and continually reaches the other toward various kinds of theories. Although the able student can usefully learn from each of the first three, it is the fourth teacher who, explicitly and implicitly, can be the role model. Where else will the stu- dent be upon graduation but in practice, looking for some use- ful theory (ies)? Practice Many of the papers presented at this research workshop are strongly practice -oriented, and do search for theories and metaphors for illumination. The helix has been used as a way of describing and predicting a future step in research (sophis- ticated prescription), but now the stage is set to describe and predict the impact of some present and future steps in corpor- ate practice. A topic of visible interest for policy and strategy in the in- dustrial world today is that of "corporate governance," dealing largely with the role, nature, composition, and organization of the board of directors. I have recently read, in preparing for these remarks, three documents: (1) "Corporate Accountabil- ity - One Year Later," an address by Harold M. Williams, Chairman of the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC); (2) "Board of Directors Sixth Annual Study, February 1979," done by Korn/ Ferry International, an executive search firm; and (3) fThe Role and Composition of the Board of Di- rectors of the Large Publicly Owned Corporation," a position paper by the Business Roundtable following a Scholars' Sym- posium (in which I was a participant). Some of my own re-</page><page sequence="6">Corporate Strategy and Corporate Governance 105 tators. There is some disagreement about the appropriate role of people like bankers and lawyers serving jointly as MvendorsM and directors. It is a fact, as Korn/Ferry reports, that these directors are also becoming less numerous. As an extreme position, Chairman Williams advocates no such "affiliated" di- rectors and only one inside director - the chief executive officer. He goes on to advocate that the job and role of chairman of the board not be held by the same person as chief executive officer. Because the chief executive officer does, and should, report to the board, the argument goes, he should not control its agenda. Perhaps not surprisingly, the Business Roundtable, composed of chief executive officers, does not support this proposal. Perhaps it is surprising that of the five-hundred- plus companies reporting for the Korn/Ferry survey, slightly over a quarter have separate board chairmen and chief execu- tive officers. Although board committees have been receiving greater at- tention and publicity recently - and audit committees' investi- gative role in some recent publicized cases is noteworthy - the newly developed nominating committee experience is per- haps most important. Korn/Ferry notes, fThe most significant change in board committee structure is the fact that thirty - seven percent of the respondents now have a nominating com- mittee. This represents an eighteen percent increase (over last year) in the use of the nominating committee to screen potential candidates for board service. Moreover, an addi- tional sixteen percent of the respondents who do not already have a nominating committee are considering establishing one within the next year" - and this would make over half the companies. To overstate the case, this would make the corporate situa- tion more analogous to that of the public university, in which the next board member may be essentially a stranger to the president at the time of appointment/election. Though this would be the polar situation, the growing role of specialized committees composed largely of truly independent directors</page><page sequence="7">106 Edward H. Bowman (USA) may well change the ways decisions are made and issues are addressed in our industrial society. Illustrative of this posi- tion is the Korn/Ferry report, which notes, "Of those respon- dents who feel that the role of the board has changed within the past year, fifty -four percent note greater concern with corpo- rate ethics, followed by greater concern with managerial suc- cession (43%) and financial results (38%). " The growing importance of the board and its committees, not just ideal but real, is highlighted by an annual report re- ceived while these remarks were being prepared. The General Electric Company, one of AmericaTs larger and more success- ful companies, has as a complete front page cover of its 1978 annual report a presentation, "GE Board Committees - one key way to assure 'corporate governance/ " On the cover are listed the committee names plus a functional phrase: a) Nominating Committee - Assessing Director candidates and committee memberships b) Operations Committee - The Board1 s monitor of GE operating performance c) Technology and Science Committee - Seeking the great- est potential from GE research and development d) Management Development and Compensation Committee - Maintaining the quality of General Electric managerial leadership e) Public Issues Committee - Assuring a thoughtful GE voice on key issues f) Finance Committee - Appraisal of General Electric financial planning g) Audit Committee - Independent assessments of audits of General Electric Will all these board committees and attention to corporate governance make any difference in decision making by the company about choice of domain, interactions with the environ- ment, and internal adjustments ? With a move toward f Independent people independently chose," it is hard to believe they will not.</page><page sequence="8">Corporate Strategy and Corporate Governance 107 In the language of this workshop, they will help to set the predefined backgrounds, choose the arenas, write the recipes, and even (re)construct the retrospective strategies. The in- fluence of this process is more subtle, more pervasive, and more compelling than the Business Roundtable comment that ". . . strategic plans and board consideration of such plans should be an integral part of the strategic planning process. " The dialogue that currently transpires in board meetings and committees will now more than before feed and prime the sys- temic intelligence that most papers presented here address in one guise or another.
