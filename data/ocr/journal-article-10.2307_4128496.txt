ROWLEY There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. Shakespeare, Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, act 1, scene 5 Occasionally when I am teaching I find students whose narrow way of ap- proaching a subject restrict their ability to see the problem from another per- spective. When this happens I take a silver dollar from my pocket and ask the student to close one eye. I then hold the coin a few inches from the open eye and ask, "What do you see?" The answer is of course a silver dollar. I then hold the coin a few yards away from the student and tell him to open both eyes. I again ask what do you see and the response is again a coin. I ask again and I get the same reply. I then inquire if he cannot see the table, his classmates, out the window, or a number of other things. The answer is that of course the student could see all those things if asked or pointed out. I then make my point. All that the student could see or was interested in seeing was that upon which he fo- cused. His focus caused him to be blind to the world around him. Occasion- ally, when approaching literary criticism our focus can often be limited due to the questions that are asked and the choice of methodology. As a result, our commitment to one perspective limits our ability to see the rest of the world. Rudolf Otto, in The Idea of the Holy, makes a similar observation. He claims those modern students who pursue research in religion all fall victim to an in- ability to think outside the realm of rational thought.' This failure to see other perspectives causes them to not recognize the value of the supra-rational. Howard Eilberg-Schwartz, in The Savage in Judaism, agrees that "certain kinds of questions are asked rather than others, that particular types of comparisons are considered fruitful while others are treated as uninteresting or irrelevant, AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 2002/VOL. 26, NO. 3 491</page><page sequence="2">and that certain methods are adopted to answer questions interpreters deem important."2 Referring again to my experience with students, their limited perspective causes them to have a limited understanding of Native American myth com- plexes. Responses by students fall into two general categories. The first cate- gory consists of comments made about the myth's words. An interpretation of this sort is concerned with logos. The second category concerns itself with the function of the myth in society or, in other words, the myth's ritual aspects. Comments begin with statements made about the "beauty" of the myth. Most often comments such as these are referring to the natural elements in the complex. A point is made regarding the respect for nature found in the text. They notice how the human characters refer to animals, plants, and Mother Earth and conclude that Native Americans have a reverence for all of nature. Beauty is also found in the animation of animals, plants, and the earth. Atten- tion is focused on the Native American belief that every thing is alive and many complementary comments are made about the animism in the stories. Others look for meaning by searching for symbols and motifs. Unknow- ingly, many apply a Jungian interpretation and search for recognizable sym- bols by drawing from their collective conscience for meaning. Colors are scru- tinized for their meaning-red is for passion, white is for purity, blue is for mystery, and so forth. Still other students try to draw comparisons. This approach is common as students strive to understand non-Western perceptions of reality created by myth complexes. Rhetorical comparisons are made. Myths are categorized as poems, epics, or songs. Comparing archetypes is yet another approach. These comparisons generally come from the Judeo-Christian or Greek traditions. From this perspective, students notice similarities between creation myths. Commonly, when a flood sequence is encountered, students comment, "This is just like Noah's ark." The comparison opens an avenue of understanding, but it also limits that understanding to a Western perspective. Advanced com- parative interpretations contrast rather than compare using a Levi-Strassian approach. Here juxtapositions are made between oppositions to find a medi- ating center. The other types of responses can be grouped by an interest in the ritual end of myth. This is manifest by a simple obsession with plot and action or more commonly with a concern with how the myth intersects with society or how myth is placed in historical events. When exploring the ways myth intersects with a culture, approaches can range from economic, political, or religious. Currently, gender role and the representation of the feminine in tribal societies are in discussion, and repre- sentations of women in myth are under examination. Questions of voice, ob- jectification, political enfranchisement, and sexual orientation are asked. The 492 Commentary</page><page sequence="3">answers to these questions are found in their practice in society. The text is used as a starting point from which a larger social commentary can begin. Another approach is to read the myth for clues that would place it histori- cally. These clues verify the event in history and then analyze the myth in terms of how the historical influenced the creation of the myth. From this perspec- tive the myth of White Buffalo Woman is seen as an outgrowth of migration and displacement. A reader notices that the event took place before the advent of horses into the Lakota culture. Noting this, the myth is placed in the early to mid-eighteenth century. With the acquisition of firearms came mass migra- tions. Many nations were forced to move to a new environment where old hunting, gathering, and cultivating techniques were not viable. These factors facilitated a need for new social orders. Consequently, the myth of White Buf- falo Woman evolved as a tool to institutionalize societal change caused by un- controllable external pressure. The problem with these approaches is their participation in the debate over myth and ritual that mythologists have been participating in for the greater part of this century. The interpretations concern themselves with either the words of a myth (that is, symbols, personifications, or comparisons) or ritual (that which is acted out in a community). While mythologists believe there is a connection between ritual and myth, there is disagreement as to which came first. "Some believe that ritual is an enactment of a myth," giving myth supremacy, "while others feel that myth tells about the ritual in story form," thus privileging ritual.3 This debate is bound to continue as each side focuses on its own perspective. The observation that has been overlooked is that "myth and ritual are based on visionary experience." 4 This basis of both myth and ritual has been overlooked because, first, mod- ern mythologists do not give credit to visionary experiences the same way visionary people do. Second, modern methodologies do not accept the supra- rational. In The Sacred Hoop, Paula Gunn Allen points out, "It is seldom as- sumed that a given tribal version of its own history is true or that it might be seen as true from some perspective other than the social science paradigm common to western ideas of fact finding." 5 This attitude allows modern schol- ars to dismiss Native Americans' descriptions of their experiences as anthro- pomorphic, primal, savage, and primitive. By using these terms, scholars can blithely dismiss this perspective and concentrate on legitimate scholarly en- deavors of sociohistoric and literary analysis. This sentiment is evident when Eilberg-Schwartz states that his view of culture allows him "to arrive at inter- pretations of given practices that would in some stances be unacceptable to the people whose practices [he is] interpreting."6 How can he do this? Because a tribal interpretation would somehow be less valid than his own scientifically objective approach. With the rejection of the supra-rational, visionary experiences are also re- AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 2002/VOL. 26, NO. 3 493</page><page sequence="4">jected. Once the visionary experience is rejected the formation of Native cul- ture is no longer the result of revealed religion but rather the cause of socio- historic factors. When scholars focus only on the historical aspect of Native American experience, they narrow their perspective to the extent that they cannot see the larger world of mythopoetic vision. When one leaves the realm of mythopoetic thought, words about gods, spirits, katchinas, and so on, be- come rational abstractions of ethical conventions. This view privileges the ra- tional over the supra-rational, and the result of this privileging is the denial of mythopoetic vision. What is the consequence of this choice? It is much the same as when a Navajo cradleboard is taken from its context and placed in a museum. It may be an object that is pleasing to look at, but it becomes a useless item. Those that observe it do not have the ability to know how effective it is in calming a col- icky child, nor are they aware of its ability to develop observational skills in children. The object becomes at best a curio. The same is true with Native American literary studies. When a myth is taken out of mythopoetic vision, it "can not be understood more that peripherally by the adding machine mind; for when [it] is removed from its special and necessary context, it is no longer myth, it is a dead or dying curiosity." 7 The tragic end of a myth is when foot- notes are mistaken for scholarly endeavor. Given this critique, the task at hand is to re-inscribe mythopoetic vision in Native American literary studies. The important point to remember when try- ing to develop mythopoetic vision is that myth and ritual emanate from a vi- sionary experience. When a person is given a visionary experience, they are also given the responsibility to relate it and share the sacred power that came with it. As a result, myth and ritual are transmitters of sacred power. There- fore, if a mythopoetic worldview is re-inscribed into the field of Native Amer- ican literary studies, a re-examination of myth and ritual will follow, with the understanding that both are an extension of a visionary experience. The myth narrative is an articulation of an experience with transcendence. Because of the other worldliness of this experience, the language of myth in- volves the use of metaphysically charged symbols to convey its message. The challenge of the visionary is to put nonordinary realities into ordinary lan- guage. This is the imaginative aspect of visionaries; however, it does not mean that the visionary experience was imagined. Instead, it is these creative devices mythopoetic people look for when listening to visionary experiences. Allen provides four characteristic devices that indicate something scared is happen- ing: "the supernatural characters, the nonordinary events, the transcendent powers, and the pour quoi elements in a visionary narrative."8 In other words, what one with mythopoetic vision would look for in a myth complex are all the enigmatic happenings that scholars blithely disregard as anthropomorphic and primitive and that students find problematic to text comprehension. 494 Commentary</page><page sequence="5">Basic to mythopoetic vision is the acceptance of supernatural characters. Supernatural characters can come in many forms; common is the creational being. The creational being of the Yumas is Kokomaht. Kokomaht existed as two beings or twins before being born out of the spray and foam of the waters. Once born, he assumed the role of a good twin, while the bad characteristics became Bakotahl. Kokomaht creates the world and its inhabitants through physical actions. By walking in each direction he makes the four directions, stirring his hand in the waters and causing a foaming whirlpool makes the earth, and molding clay into dolls makes inhabitants of the world. For the Acomas the creational being is Tsitchinako. The creative process for her is one of thought. In these myth complexes Tsitchinako's thinking or talking about something creates the context for existence. Thus, the earth, sunrise, and at times people, plants, and animals are created through a cognitive act. In addi- tion to the different ways these supernatural beings create are their personal characteristics. They can be male, as in the case of Kokomaht, female such as the Hopi's Huruing Wuhti, or asexual as many claim Tsitchinako to be. Mystical beings are another form of supernatural beings. Monsters inhabit a prominent place in the myth complexes of many Native nations. Great water monsters are spirits and common to many tribes. For the Sioux it is Unktehi whose great fossil bones are strewn across the badlands of Nebraska and the Dakotas. The Iroquois have tales of the great Flying Head that would soar through the night devouring every living being. A third form of mystical beings is ghosts and spirits. Among the Southwest tribes, ghosts come out only after dark, and their appearance may foreshadow the death of a close relative. Ghosts, however, are not necessarily always evil or threatening. Some spirits are harmlessly funny and play tricks on people, while others come in dreams to bless or warn a person of danger. Spirits can take the shape of humans, or they may only be the whistling sound behind a tipi or a whirlwind on the prairie. A supernatural being can also be human. In such cases they function as a mediation character whose role is to bring sacred power into the world or dis- cover sacred power through a series of quests. A common manifestation of such beings is culture heroes. The birth and maturation of culture heroes are often strange in circumstance. Rabbit boy, of the Brulk Sioux, was born from a blood clot that a rabbit played with in a mysterious way, causing the blood clot to form a gut, arms, feet, and a head. Kut-toe-yis of the Blackfoot Nation matured by successively being tied to twenty-nine tipi poles. After being re- leased from the last pole, Kut-toe-yis was a fully grown man. Another device of mythopoetic vision is the employment of transcendent powers. These powers are characterized as supranatural knowledge or power that is given from an ethereal source. Knowledge of this type comes from a source other than human reason or ingenuity. Even the most ordinary and AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/SUMMER 2002/VOL. 26, NO. 3 495</page><page sequence="6">commonplace task can be revelatory in nature. For example, White Buffalo Woman appeared on the Plains and instructed the Sioux in food gathering and cooking techniques. It was through a dream that the Blackfoot Nation was in- structed in the ritual smoking of tobacco. Transcendent power can be the more mystical powers of nurturing, protection, and healing. The White Mountain Apache attribute their healing powers to the One Who Made the Earth. The chants, drumming, and positioning of the healers were acquired through con- versation with One Who Made the Earth. When dealing with supernatural characters and transcendent powers, a nat- ural accompaniment is nonordinary events. In the above discussion of the other two devices of mythopoetic vision, a number of odd, enigmatic events have been mentioned but not discussed. Floating heads and a child born from a blood clot are not ordinary events. Nonordinary events are happenings that are not part of everyday occurrences. Their function, however, is not to chal- lenge our concept of normal reality but to lend validity to the myth complex. When dealing with supernatural beings and transcendent powers, why would not the events surrounding them be supranormal? In a myth that deals with supernatural characters, there is an expectation that they will use supernatural means to accomplish their tasks. The absence of such events would bring into question whether they really are supernatural in character. Many Southwest emergent stories involve climbing a large, tall corn stalk to escape extermina- tion. While this event is questionable in our understanding of reality, it is per- fectly acceptable and expected when dealing with supernatural characters and transcendent powers. The absence of such events when dealing with the first two devices would be nonordinary. Last, the pour quoi element also indicates that something sacred is happen- ing. The pour quoi element at the very basic level answers the question "Why?" An example of this in Native American literature would be a story like "Why does the squirrel have a bushy tail?" or "Why does the coyote walk alone?" They are tales that answer some question. Given this question the pour quoi story provides an answer. However, the pour quoi element does more than an- swer a question with an imaginative story. It inscribes the story on the squirrel so you cannot help but think of the story when you see a squirrel. It also shows the type of reality in which myth actually participates. Whatever the answer is to the above questions, the fact still remains that the squirrel has a bushy tail and the coyote walks alone. Because these things are true, they retrospectively lend legitimacy to the story. The squirrel explains or validates the story rather than the story explaining the squirrel. While this form of reasoning is a paral- ogism, the point of this discussion is to examine myth complexes from a per- spective other than a Western tradition and standards of logic that are cultur- ally based, as Otto argues in The Idea of the Holy. 496 Commentary</page><page sequence="7">The pour quoi element is the physical element that points to the fact that the visionary event occurred. For the Sioux the physical element is the sacred pipe. This item was given to them at the same time they were instructed on how to hold and use it. The story of White Buffalo Woman is impressed on the pipe, but more importantly, the story of White Buffalo Woman is validated because the pipe exists. The pour quoi element is further entrenched through the exis- tence of a tribal pipe kept by the Looking Horse family at Eagle Butte in South Dakota. This pipe is made from a buffalo calf's leg bone and is said to be the sacred pipe White Buffalo Woman brought the people. Both pipes, the one be- ing used and the one owned by the Looking Horse family, will always be phys- ical symbols of the appearance and teachings of the Buffalo Maiden. However imaginative or mystical the relating of the events at the coming of White Buf- falo Woman might be, the reality is that there is the existence of the pipe. Mythopoetic vision, however, is more than just categorizing elements of the mythic narrative. As Allen points out, it "is a kind of story that allows a holis- tic image to pervade and shape consciousness, thus providing a coherent and empowering matrix for action and relationship." 9 Laguna storyteller Leslie Marmon Silko refers to this connection between myth and relationships when she writes, By recalling these other stories which are somehow linked to this place or to this person or to this kind of activity, it begins to put everything into kind of... not just into a context, but it puts things into proportion, and it begins to link the people, individuals. It begins to link the individual to the rest of the people in a kind of essential way.' Mythopoetic vision achieves the almost insurmountable task of creating con- sciousness and relationships in a fragmented and insolated modernity. Out of the four devices of myth, the pour quoi element is best equipped to create consciousness and relationships. It provides a real place from which identity can begin. However, in order to articulate and talk about identity, there must be an identifying act. The identifying act is not with culture but with landscape. Wendy Rose (Hopi/Miwok) provides a Native perspective on this. She remembers, "My father told me ... that Hopi earth does contain my roots and I am, indeed, from that land. Because the roots are there, I will find them. But when I find them, he said, I must rebuild myself as a Hopi. I am not merely a conduit, but a participant." " As Rose's father points out, character- istic of the pour quoi element is a referent to a physical place. It can be a moun- tain, a cave, or any element of the landscape. As the tribal person willfully en- ters into a relationship with the landscape-the place where the events of his life have taken place-the person begins to develop an identity. Identifying AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY/ SUMMER 2002 / VOL. 26, NO. 3 497</page><page sequence="8">with the landscape allows a person with mythopoetic vision to identify himself or herself with something that is not as transitory as cultural conventions. However, identifying with the landscape does provide a person with the ability to enter culture. According to mythopoetic vision, the life story of an individual and the life story of a cultural group are but two expressions or ar- ticulations of a common pretextual experience. That pretextual experience is one of acquiring visions of the living landscape that the individual and cultural group both occupy. Because culture is created out of a relationship with the landscape, to truly enter a culture one must identify with the environment. For a person to enter his culture he must first identify with the landscape, in other words, that thing from which custom was created. This identifying act is done at sunrise. Thomas Yellow Tail, a Crow Holy Man, states the importance of the sunrise experience: "The manner with which we walk through life is each man's most important responsibility and we should remember this every new sunrise."12 A translation of "The Hako: A Pawnee Ceremony" offers a morning song for our examination. Reshuru rira risha Reshuru, the Dawn. Rira, coming toward one. Risha, something scarcely to be seen because of its distance; it eludes, Seems to appear and then to disappear.'3 Ku'rahus offers an explanation of this stanza, which emphasizes the song's call to its singers to remember what is important: As we sing this stanza we are still standing at the west of the lodge, look- ing through the long passageway toward the east. Now in the distance we see the Dawn approaching; it is coming along the path of the Morning Star. It is a long path and as the Dawn advances along this path sometimes we catch sight of it, then again we lose it, but all the time it is coming nearer. The Dawn is new born, its breath has sent new life everywhere, all things stir with the life Tira'wa atius has given this child, his child, whose mother is Night.14 First there is the land, made visible at sunrise, a beginning time. The singer is also there to witness the sunrise, and in so witnessing he or she becomes part of that landscape's re-animation as Tira'wa atius gives life to all things. At this event, one is not a distant observer of an other but a participant in the event. It is an identifying event from which one can begin to articulate experience. Ontologically speaking, the mythopoetic experience articulates that creation or landscape precedes existence, which precedes essence. The preexisting state 498 Commentary</page><page sequence="9">of landscape provides continuity and eventually community. As one engages the landscape and its extension, culture, individuals can engage other people. The ritual aspect of the visionary experience is equally important to the de- velopment of community. To begin, ritual is the re-enactment of significant portions of the visionary experience. However, in the mythopoetic worldview, ritual is "a language construct that contains the power to transform something (or someone) from one state or condition to another." 5 In Native American studies, the transcendent power that is given through ritual performances is that of community identification. To put it in other terms, ritual has the power to transform a person from a state of alienation and place him or her into a con- dition of community. A very practical way this is achieved is through participa- tion. Ritual requires the person to confront the other. Black Elk needed to share his visionary experience to find fulfillment. After Black Elk shared his vision with the holy man Black Road, the holy man offered the following counsel: Nephew, I know now what the trouble is! You must do what the bay horse in your vision wanted you to do. You must do your duty and perform this vision for your people upon earth. You must have the horse dance first for the people to see. Then the fear will leave you; but if you do not do this, something very bad will happen to you."' 6 By re-creating the rainbow tipi and engaging people through the Horse Dance, Black Elk was cured from his alienating illness. In addition to Black Elk's personal benefits, the ritual becomes the basis and beginnings of community life. As Black Elk recalls, the community was happy again and was good. The fear that was on me so long was gone.... Before this, the medicine men would not talk to me, but now they would come to me to talk about my vision. Form that time on, I always got up very early to see the rising of the day- break star. People knew that I did this, and many would get up to see it with me, and when it came we said: "Behold the star of understanding!" 17 The ritual prescribes conduct as it enunciates responsibilities. In short, ritual is the vehicle for engaging the other. By re-inscribing the mythopoetic worldview into Native American studies a new perspective is provided for discussion. Students can engage Native Amer- ican literature on a level different from the unexamined terms of "beautiful" and "spiritual." The new level of discussion involves the function mythopoetic vision provides in a method of thought that resists alienating assumptions. Mythopoetic vision is a view of existence that creates identity and community. In this broad sense, mythopoetic "vision is a way of becoming whole, of affirm- AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY / SUMMER 2002/VOL. 26, NO. 3 499</page><page sequence="10">ing ones' special place in the universe, and myth, song, and ceremony are ways of affirming vision's place in the life of all people. Thus it renews all: the vi- sionary and his relatives and friends, even the generations long dead and those yet unborn."'8 NOTES 1.
