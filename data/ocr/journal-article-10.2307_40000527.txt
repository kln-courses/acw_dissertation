<plain_text><page sequence="1">Relationships of the Nubian A-Group Sabrina R. Rampersad Introduction Since the discovery of the A-Group culture in 1907, emphasis has been placed upon A-Group relations with the Egyptian Nile civilizations of Upper Egypt.1 As a result, little discussion has been ventured about Sudanese interconnections or Eastern and Western Desert relations for the A-Group. An examination of A-Group material for broader interconnections, as attempted here, shows that the A-Group was very much a part of the Saharan and Sudanese ceramic traditions. This is evidenced primarily by the wide distribu- tion of impressed and incised decorative motifs in A-Group ceramics. While the emphasis here is on the pottery, certain A-Group burial fea- tures and subsistence modes are also examined for evidence of cultural relationships. The geographic areas from which material is drawn for comparison are: Lower Nubia, includ- ing the Nubian Desert, Egypt's Eastern and West- ern Deserts, including the oases, the Dongola Reach, the Central Sudan, the Butana, the Atbai, the Gash Delta, the Wadi Howar, the Wadi Shaw, and the Laqiya region. Also considered are the Tibesti region of northwestern Chad and the Ennedi area of eastern Chad. Nordstrom 's detailed work on A-Group ceramic classification2 forms the basis of the comparative approach taken here with the ceramics. Nord- strom's efforts represent the culmination of a short history of A-Group ceramic study, begin- ning with Reisner's loose classification of Egyp- tian wares from A-Group contexts in northern Lower Nubia.3 It was G. Steindorff, however, who formed the first formal typology of A-Group in- digenous pottery, which consisted of seven broad categories based largely upon the external char- acteristics of vessels from the site of Aniba.4 Later, during the Nubian High Dam Campaign, Nordstrom began his classification by incorpo- rating and cross referencing Steindorff 's system into his own.5 The non-A-Group material used in this study is drawn from published site reports resulting from surveys and excavations through- out the Sudan and the Egyptian deserts.6 A-Group Ceramic Relationships Table 1 shows all of the ceramic designs that the writer has identified as shared A-Group traits in industries and sites throughout the Sudan and eastern and western Egypt. In most cases the A-Group designs are exactly comparable to those same patterns found elsewhere, both in terms of the appearance of the decoration and, often, the location of the design on the vessel. Spe- cific exceptions to this rule are discussed below. Table 2 presents a summary of the distribution of A-Group patterns in the various sites and 1 Specifically referred to is the strong trade relationship between Egypt and Nubia in A-Group times.

The summary of the data has produced some surprising results. In terms of ceramic design, the A-Group appears not to be closely linked with the industries geographically nearest to it, i.e., those cultures in Lower Nubia and the Dongola Reach. Rather, connections further abroad are definitely suggested. Table 2 demon- strates that the number of A-Group decorative motifs shared by certain Khartoum Neolithic sites of the Central Sudan far exceeds the number of shared A-Group motifs in any other area of the Sudan and Egypt. The sites of Kadero, Sha- heinab, and Geili figure most heavily in this re- gard. Strong Khartoum Neolithic relationships for the A-Group are confirmed by the Khartoum Variant, the next industry to yield comparatively substantial A-Group ceramic traits. By contrast, the number of Khartoum Neolithic traits in the Abkan is less than half the number of A-Group ceramic traits displayed at either Kadero or the Khartoum Variant sites. The compelling sig- nificance of these data is that many of the im- pressed and incised decorative elements in the A-Group ceramic industry did not develop in- digenously in Lower Nubia, and that the likely place of origin for these motifs was the Cen- tral Sudan in Khartoum Neolithic times. It re- mains to be determined whether the Khartoum Neolithic traits in the A-Group were acquired directly from the Khartoum region itself, or more indirectly through the Khartoum Variant and Dongola Reach industries. This question is answerable to a limited degree by the simple counts presented here. A comparison of the shared A-Group traits between the Khartoum Variant and the three Khartoum Neolithic sites of Kadero, Shaheinab, and Geili, shows that there is only a marginal de- gree of overlap of A-Group traits between the Second Cataract and Khartoum areas. Only half of the A-Group traits in the Khartoum Variant are also found in the three Khartoum Neolithic sites in question. Furthermore, of the twenty- two traits listed for the combined sites of Ka- dero, Shaheinab, and Geili, most (68 percent) do not appear in the Khartoum Variant. The impli- cation of this is that the A-Group was likely not dependent solely upon the emergence of the Khartoum Variant Industry in the Second Cata- ract for the acquisition of Khartoum Neolithic ceramic traits. Nor does it seem likely that these traits developed indigenously in Lower Nubia, due to the scarcity of these motifs in the Abkan assemblages. Of the three patterns listed for the Abkan, only two may have derived from the south, while the other (pattern 2, rectangular impressed dots) does not appear at all in the Khartoum area. The question then arises of how the A-Group obtained many of its Khartoum Neolithic traits. If one assumes a direct acquisi- tion or diffusion of traits from the Khartoum region into the A-Group area, then one would also have to assume that Khartoum Neolithic designs in the Khartoum region survived at least</page><page sequence="6">132 JARCE XXXVII (2000) as late as the emergence of the Early A-Group in Lower Nubia. If this was the case, the A-Group should be envisioned as having absorbed Khar- toum Neolithic traits directly. There is a second possibility for explaining the existence of so many Khartoum Neolithic ceramic motifs in the A-Group. The data from Table 2 show, surprisingly, a heavy representa- tion of A-Group ceramic traits at Shaqadud and Khashm el Girba in the Eastern Sudan (Butana). All, or one hundred percent of the A-Group traits at Shaqadud also appear in the Khartoum Neolithic Nilotic sites, but only forty percent of the Shaqadud traits appear in the Khartoum Variant. One may surmise that the A-Group had either direct or indirect contact with Shaqadud, and thus absorbed certain Khartoum Neolithic traits from outside the Nile Valley. The proposed relationship is possible given the later duration of Khartoum-like assemblages in the Butana. Mo- hammed-Ali and Jaeger have argued for a delay in the spread of pottery-making and ceramic de- sign eastward into the Butana (and the Atbai) from the Nile Valley.8 Thus the Butana appears not to fall into Hays's model of rapidly diffusing cultural traits from a central region or regions of the Nile.9 The evidence from Khashm el Girba on the easternmost edge of the Butana does not, unfortunately, add to the argument for a predominantly Butana origin for the Khartoum Neolithic designs in A-Group ceramics, as op- posed to a Khartoum Variant origin. Although almost all of the Khashm el Girba traits (86 per- cent) appear in the Khartoum Neolithic, all of these same traits also appear in the Khartoum Variant Industry. Whatever the precise origin and route of trans- mission for the Khartoum Neolithic ceramic traits in A-Group pottery, it may be certain that the direction of the movement of these traits was from south to north and from the southeast to the northwest, given the earliest occurrence of the shared traits in the Khartoum region of the Nile. If the A-Group did have cultural connec- tions with the Eastern Sudan, these likely had their limit at Khashm el Girba because of the noticeable reduction of A-Group ceramic traits further east in the Gash Delta. It could be argued that a more realistic easterly limit for A-Group interconnections is at Shaqadud and not as far east as Khashm el Girba. This is based on the general lateness of many of the shared ceramic motifs in the Khashm el Girba region, which often post-date the Terminal A-Group. Further- more, the lack of archaeological assemblages from the vast area lying between Shaqadud and Khashm el Girba does not encourage one to favor the possibility of A-Group connections further east of Shaqadud. Lack of A-Group connections in the Gash Delta is suggested by the stylistic variation in the Gash Delta shared motifs. The design of cross- hatching (pattern 9), for example, is similar to but not identical to the A-Group cross-hatched motifs.10 The only other shared features of ob- lique lines (pattern 18) is not contemporaneous with the A-Group. These observations contribute to the assessment of Gash Delta extra-regional contacts made by Fattovich.11 Generally, the Gash Delta did not develop geographically wide trade networks until relatively late in prehistory, not until after the demise of the A-Group in Lower Nubia. Earlier relations, when they did occur, appeared not to have been in the direction of Lower Nubia, but further east, as far as Yemen. The only other possible source of Khartoum Neolithic designs in the A-Group is the Karat Industry, where six shared motifs between the A-Group, the Khartoum Neolithic, and the Karat Group are noted (Table 2). Strong Shaheinab influences in the Karat Group pottery are some- what substantiated by similarities in their lithic 8 A. Mohammed-Ali and S. E.

On the other hand, a more complete publication of the Karat Group pottery may well change this view if it were dem- onstrated, for instance, that a greater range of Khartoum Neolithic traits is present in the Karat Industry. One suspects that the Karat Group has the potential to produce such evidence, certainly more so than any other industry in the Dongola Reach. Based on current evidence, however, it appears that the Early A-Group was only loosely linked to the Dongola Reach through the Khar- toum Neolithic ceramic traits of the Karat Group. The Pre-Kerma industry, as promising as it is for elucidating A-Group relationships with Up- per Nubia in the future, is too scantily known to allow for definitive comparisons. The occurrence of the cross-hatched design and the variegated haematitic ware alone says little for A-Group re- lations in Upper Nubia. The same statement applies to the presence of only three A-Group ceramic motifs in the Karmakol, Tergis, and El Melik Groups combined. It should be noted that the El Melik pottery is gravely in need of de- tailed study. The combined corpus of A-Group ceramic traits in the Shendi Reach is weakly suggestive of specific A-Group relationships with this area. All traits counted from the sites of Kadada, El Ush- ara, El Ghaba, and Shendi are also present in the Khartoum Neolithic. The same may be said about the decorative attributes listed for the Blue and White Nile regions. Taken as a whole, about 78 percent of the Blue and White Nile designs correspond with Khartoum Neolithic motifs, thus attesting to the spread of Khartoum traits to these regions south of Khartoum. Turning now to the evidence from the West- ern Sudan, there is sparse but compelling evi- dence of A-Group links with this region. These connections appear to have been independent of A-Group relations with the Khartoum area. Two designs attest to this: pattern 14, the her- ringbone punctate, and a modified (elongated) version of pattern 30, the checkered arrange- ment of lozenges, both of which have appeared in the Laqiya region and in the A-Group. These designs, to the writer's knowledge, are totally unknown in the Khartoum area or in the deserts and oases of Egypt. However, the former pattern is probably related to the solid and dotted line versions of the herringbone design seen all along the Sudanese Nile. As for the source of these two distinctive patterns, little can be ventured at pres- ent. Did they originate in the Western Sudan and then spread to Lower Nubia, or vice-versa? The researchers of the B.O.S. (Besiedlungsge- schichte der Ost-Sahara) expedition have consid- ered the problem of the direction of influence between the Nile and the Western Sudan, but they conceded that the direction of A-Group in- terconnections with the west is a difficult issue to decide.13 The writer, too, is unable to offer any insights into this problem from the ceramic study presented here. A further question yet to be an- swered is whether A-Group relations with the west were as well developed or as extensive as the A-Group Nilotic connections with the Khar- toum region. Little can be said in favor of A-Group links with the Eastern and Nubian Deserts, although in these cases one suspects that some evidence is there waiting to be uncovered. These regions are still little known archaeologically. A-Group connections are suggested by the discovery of A-Group rock drawings in the Eastern Desert and by some of the burial material from Bir Abraq.14 That these regions were also affected by the wide dispersal of Khartoum-like traits is attested by the presence of a few such traits in 12 For the lithic evaluations see A. E. Marks and C. R. Ferring, "The Karat Group: An Early Ceramic Bearing Oc- cupation of the Dongola Reach, Sudan," in The Prehistory and Geology of Northern Sudan, edited by J. L.

Much work remains to be done in both these eastern desert regions separately before any assessment of their relationships can be attempted. We come now to the Egyptian Western Desert and oasis regions, where there is not much certain evidence of A-Group links through the ceramics. The writer, however, proposes the possibility of a Western Desert origin for a few A-Group traits. A few ceramic traits of the Western Desert ap- peared as early as the Abkan in Lower Nubia, a circumstance that attests to links between the Western Desert and the Nubian Nile Valley well before the emergence of the A-Group. That these connections continued to flourish during the time of the A-Group is now becoming clear, but the evidence in support of this process is still scant. Those traits in the Western Desert that predated the arrival or the emergence of their counterparts in the Khartoum region are: (1) the cross-hatched pattern (no. 18) from Bir Kiseiba, (2) pattern 9, oblique parallel lines from Nabta Playa, (3) pattern 23, a double row of dots on the rim band, also from Nabta Playa, and (4) pattern 13, the dotted herringbone motif, specifically ar- ranged in panel format, from Wadi Bakht and Gebel Kamil. Of these designs, pattern 23 does not appear in the Early Khartoum and Khartoum Neolithic assemblages at all, although strangely, its presence has been noted all round the Khar- toum region. This includes the sites of Guli and Haj Yusif south of Khartoum, as well as in the Khartoum Variant and Tergis Industries. While its lack of occurrence in the Khartoum area would tend to strengthen the possibility of a Western Desert origin for the trait, it is difficult to explain its occurrence in every other region of the Nile, especially south of Khartoum. The very early presence of these four motifs in the Western Desert suggests that not all ceramic innovation in the Sudan originated in the Khartoum region, but that there may have been some diffusion or transmission of a few motifs from the Eastern Sahara in a southeast direction toward the Nile Valley. If this did indeed occur with selected ceramic traits, then Lower Nubia would have been among the first areas to have assimilated these characteristics. The data from Table 2 show a disappointing lack of evidence for interaction between the oases of the Western Desert and the Nubian Nile Valley, including the A-Group. The only possi- ble exception may be Dakhleh Oasis, but more research and analysis is needed before a solid argument may be made for Lower Nubian con- nections. Based largely on the lithic material, McDonald argues for the placement of Dakhleh Oasis within the Saharo-Sudanese Neolithic tra- dition,13 but according to Tangri, the ceramics support a more regional development within the Dakhleh Oasis.16 Whatever the outcome of this debate, there are at present few A-Group de- signs in the Dakhleh Oasis pottery. Black-topped ware is present, but it has been noted that "the Dakhleh black-topped vessels are very rarely red coated or burnished as are those from the Predynastic Period in Egypt and their exterior is generally rough or striated."17 The same com- parison of course holds true for the A-Group black-topped wares. In addition, incised rims with vertical strokes (not oblique) have been found at Dakhleh, as well as the horizontal punc- tate design and the cross-hatch motif. From these and other features of the ceramics it is generally agreed that links between Dakhleh Oasis and the Nile Valley existed in Neolithic times, but their exact nature and extent eludes us at present. The only ware type indicative of Sudanese but not A-Group links is the woven mat design, the equivalent of Tangri's basket-impressed ware. Attention must be given to the possibility of western connections for the A-Group that may have extended beyond Egypt and the Sudan. Pattern 2, rows of impressed rectangular dots, occurs in the Abkan Industry as well as in the A-Group. Another occurrence of the motif is in the Khartoum Variant, where it is one of only two "anomalous" ceramic traits, that is, traits that do not seem to have derived from the Khar- toum ceramic traditions. In addition, Chlodnicki has published two variants of the pattern con- sisting of a single line of rectangular dots used lD M. M. A.

Also, the design occurs in very low frequencies at Kadero, between 0.11 and 0.15 percent. The writer has not noted the occurrence of the trait elsewhere in the Sudan, or for that matter, in the Western Desert regions of Egypt. The trait, however, is known at Enneri Wour, in the Tibesti area of Chad, where the arrangement and align- ments of the "dots" (long sides oriented upward) is exactly the same as the A-Group design.19 Ac- cording to Vita-Finzi and Kennedy, the motif from Enneri Wour was likely made "... with an instrument of rectangular cross section."20 Al- though the exact instrument employed is not known for either the Chadian or A-Group mo- tifs, it is possible that rectangular awls were used, at least in the A-Group case. A few exam- ples of rectangular or quadrangular awls are known from A-Group contexts.21 It is not possi- ble to decide whether pattern 2 in A-Group ce- ramics represents a diffusion of ceramic ideas eastward into the Nile Valley, or contact with Chadians who had knowledge of both the motif appearance and its method of manufacture. Direct contact may have resulted from trade between the A-Group and western populations. If the rectangular dot motif diffused eastward into the Nile Valley, then it is not unreasonable to expect the future discovery of the design in the western areas of the Sudan and Egypt. If, on the other hand, the trait is not found in these desired regions, this forces a consideration of more direct relationships between A-Group and Tibesti populations. This is entirely likely given the evidence for Chadian connections with other areas near the Nile Valley, such as the Faiyum.22 Non-Ceramic Relationships of the A-Group The question to be answered now is: Do other types of evidence validate or negate the pro- posed relationships for the A-Group based on ceramic decoration? Fortunately a few arguments may be added to the ceramic comparisons to substantiate some of these relations, but there are still no large bodies of data from which to draw. There is, however, growing evidence to suggest that the A-Group may have received its pastoral impetus from the Libyan Desert,23 from where it is now being argued that African pasto- ralism developed independently from southwest Asia and subsequently spread from the desert re- gions into the Nile Valley.24 Such a claim has re- ceived some support from the discovery of early domesticates in the Middle and Late Neolithic assemblages of Bir Kiseiba and Nabta Playa. The latter stage of this pastoral development may well have involved a migration of nomads into Lower Nubia, thus adding to the indigenous Ter- minal Abkan /Early A-Group population. That such a process may also have contributed to the pastoral element of the Karat Group in the Don- gola Reach is worthy of consideration. So far it is very difficult to explain the economic shift to pastoralism that is evident in the Karat Group, and that industry stands alone in the Dongola Reach in displaying a strong pastoral element.

McHugh, "Late Prehistoric Cultural Adaptations in South- west Egypt and the Problem of the Nilotic Origins of Sa- haran Cattle Pastoralism," Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt (1974), 11: 9-22, and E A.

The likely contem- poraneity between the Karat Group and the A-Group makes this scenario somewhat easier to envision. Furthermore, it is known that desicca- tion was occurring in the deserts at a time coeval with the emergence of the A-Group in Lower Nubia, thus providing impetus for an eastward migration of pastoralists to the more favorable riverine environment. One cannot, however, sup- port a totally Western Desert origin for A-Group pastoralism because this would ignore both the indigenous cultural developments within Lower Nubia and the Egyptian influences to the north. Rather, a more realistic theory for A-Group pas- toral origin is a mixing of indigenous and non- indigenous Nile Valley populations with a desert pastoral population, all elements of which con- tributed to the growth and expansion of the A-Group economy through its Classic and Ter- minal phases. It is likely that the A-Group agricultural ele- ment was separately acquired from its pastoral el- ement. The traditional view is that the A-Group received its agricultural impetus from Egypt and that this is evidenced by the food producing sub- culture of the Khor Bahan Early A-Group. This culture, with its knowledge of agriculture, was gradually absorbed southward into the more in- digenous segments of the A-Group population. There is, however, growing evidence to suggest that the Western Desert oases may have been the origin of Nile Valley agriculture, thus again chal- lenging the traditional theory of a southwest Asian origin for domesticated cereals in Egypt. As with animal domestication, the most impor- tant evidence of an indigenous African origin for cereal domestication comes from the Bir Kiseiba/Nabta Playa region from where it is ar- gued that ". . . food production in the oases of Kharga, Baharia and Farafra, was introduced."25 Barich and Hassan indicate that the wheat and barley from the Nabta/Kiseiba region date to the Middle Neolithic, c. 7700-6200 B.P.26 The implication of this theory for the A- Group is that the Lower Nubian Nile Valley also may have absorbed a west to east spread of agri- culture if such a movement did indeed occur. It has always been assumed that the Khor Bahan agricultural element spread from Upper Egypt southward along the Nile, but this view should now be questioned in light of the new evidence from the Western Desert. Therefore two alterna- tives should now be considered with regard to the question of the A-Group acquisition of agri- culture: (1) the traditional theory of direct bor- rowing from Upper Egypt, with the provision that Egyptian agriculture may have derived from the Western Desert, and (2) direct acquisition from the Western Desert itself. The possibility of strong links between the A- Group and the Kadero culture, as suggested by the comparatively large number of shared ce- ramic motifs, is enhanced by the discovery of "elite" burials at Kadero.27 The material found in these graves (maceheads, malachite, etc.) is suggestive of either direct or indirect trade or contact between Kadero and Egypt. If Kadero was involved in trade with Egypt, the Nubian A-Group certainly would have been the middle- man in that trade. The other possibility is that the A-Group dealt directly with Kadero in pro- viding Kadero with Egyptian specialty items. Furthermore, the existence of an elite group at Kadero seems to parallel our understanding of A-Group social organization. No other Sudanese culture displays evidence for social stratifica- tion, not even Geili, whose funerary rite closely parallels that of Kadero, and whose graves also contained maceheads, albeit in low numbers. Is it possible that Kaderan society had a chiefdom class similar to that of the A-Group? If this was the case it would imply a much closer relation between the A-Group and Kadero cultures than even the ceramic analysis here has shown. Un- doubtedly, more research and analysis is needed before such a question may be answered. Despite the weak connections suggested by the few shared ceramic motifs between the A-Group and the Shendi area, other shared cultural as- pects such as dog burial and the infant pot 25 B. E.

Kadada is particularly illustrative of both customs. In addition, its sin- gle anthropomorphic figurine, from a burial con- text, is like the A-Group examples in terms of the steatopygia and the incised lines on the thighs that may indicate a type of garment.28 In gen- eral, however, an analysis of the figurine tradi- tion throughout the Sudan and in Egypt is not decisive in pinpointing A-Group connections.29 The main problem with this type of material is the lack of enough specimens for a good com- parative analysis. In terms of A-Group relations it is significant that within the Sudan, both the dog burial and the infant pot burial are restricted to the Shendi region of the Nile. The A-Group animal buri- als share features similar to animal burials in Egypt as well as the Central Sudan, although the Central Sudanese burials, unlike the Egyptian examples, tend to be restricted to dogs and goats only. The sites in which animal burials are known to occur in the Central Sudan are re- stricted in numbers and distribution. Bonnet (et al.) has shown, for example, that dog burials have occurred at Kadada,30 but the absence of this type of burial at El Ghaba, which is in the immediate vicinity of Kadada is not yet under- stood. From what is known about the Kadada burials, it appears that dogs were treated with a similar degree of sanctity as in the A-Group and Egyptian cultures. Bonnet (et al.) estimates that most of the dog remains from the Kadada graves testify to particular funerary rites,31 the nature of which eludes us at present. Furthermore, the sacrificial dog burial and the independent dog burial are both present at Kadada. As in the A-Group, there appears to have been no sepa- rate cemeteries devoted entirely to dogs, and their graves are scattered within human ceme- teries. The work of Bonnet and his associates has also demonstrated the continuation of the practice of dog burial well into Meroitic times, including the C-Group and Kerma cultures. Per- haps a study of the practice in later Nubian times could shed light on the Neolithic practice. Comparative material for the A-Group infant pot burial is equally sparse. The burial type is known nowhere else in Nubia and the Sudan ex- cept at the site of El Kadada, but it is also known in the Naqada II phase in Egypt. In predynastic Egypt, however, the burial type is rare, suggest- ing a possible importation of the custom from the south, either from the A-Group or elsewhere in the Sudan. One infant burial was found inside a vase at El Amrah,32 without grave offerings. At Abydos at least one infant in a pot was found interred with grave goods consisting of a wavy- handled jar and two additional vessels.33 This material in no way approaches the variety of burial goods seen in infant pot burials at Kadada. In the Egyptian examples, Vandier has noticed a preference for a southward orientation of the vessel opening. This feature has not been noted in the A-Group or Kadada examples. Reinold has done a preliminary study of the Kadada material, but A-Group comparisons are difficult because so few examples are known in the latter case, and these have not been as well documented as at Kadada. At Kadada, seven- teen vase burials were found sparsely distributed around the main mound of the site, essentially bordering the inhabited area. The burials did not appear to conform to a particular spatial organization, as some were isolated, while others occurred adjacent to one another, and others had cut into slightly earlier pot burials. Reinold was not able to define either a consistent orien- tation of the bodies inside the vessels or a con- sistent orientation of the vases inside the graves. In this respect, i.e., the lack of any preferred ori- entation, it seems that the Kadada pot burials parallel those of the A-Group rather than Egypt. The graves themselves were simple pits placed near the habitation area, which has led Reinold to the conclusion that the vase burials did not 28 For a depiction of the object from Kadada see F. Geus, "La section francaise de la direction des antiquites du Soudan: Quatre annees d'activites (1975-1979)," in New Dis- coveries in Nubia: Proceedings of the Colloquium on Nubian Studies, The Hague, 1979, edited by P. van Moorsel (1982), Plate 13. 29 A comparative discussion is given in Rampersad, op. cit, 404-9. 30 See C.

The objects were deposited on or underneath the bodies or were placed against the walls of the vessels. They included mollusc shells, beads, items of amazonite, agate, carnelian, quartz, elephant ivory bracelets, pot- tery, palettes, and fragments of palettes. By contrast, the inclusion of objects inside A-Group pot-burials has not been noted. Could this situ- ation indicate that Kadada represents a more evolved form of the infant pot burial? A sig- nificant contribution of Reinold's study was to determine the ages of the infants interred in pots, something not attempted for the A-Group examples except in obvious cases where the in- dividuals were newly born. Reinold observed a maximum age of six years for the Kadada in- fant pot burial, an age he claims may corre- spond with a stage of initiation from childhood to adolescence.35 This fascinating idea could supply a logical reason for the infant vase burial in both A-Group and Kadada contexts. Perhaps, too, the enclosure of an infant in the vase is symbolic of the enclosure of the individual in the womb, thus emphasizing the childlike status of the uninitiated person six years of age or younger. Such an ideology might adequately ex- plain the choice of a vase for burial, as well as why older children and adults were not buried in such receptacles. Summary The total analysis presented here has yielded some significant results. From the ceramic counts it would seem that both southward and south- eastern interconnections around the Middle Nile region are most strongly suggested for the A- Group in terms of shared ceramic decoration. The model that the writer presents for these re- lationships (see fig. 1 below, "Model for A-Group Relationships") considers the Khartoum area as the central region of dispersal for ceramic traits, which is entirely consistent with Arkell's original idea36 of a wide distribution of both Early Khar- toum and Khartoum Neolithic traits, especially to the west of the Nile Valley. The emphasis of the present work is that the A-Group was very much a part of this "dispersal process" despite its strong Egyptian connections, and it should be regarded equally as a product of Sudanese as well as Egyptian influence. Indeed, what has emerged here is a very multidimensional picture of A-Group relationships. It can now be certain the Egyptian dimension formed only one aspect of A-Group relations. The importance of the Khartoum region for the development of Sudanese and A-Group ceramics cannot be underestimated. It is now understood that Sudanese pottery was likely in- vented in the region of Sarurab, and thereafter the knowledge of its technology and earliest de- signs spread rapidly from this area. Thus Hays's Horizon Style theory has proven a reasonable model for the spread of Sudanese ceramic traits, except, as mentioned, for the eastern Sudan. Khabir has written: "Sarurab 2 has provided the earliest reliable dates so far for the Early Khar- toum complex in the Nile Valley and thereby increased the probability that, as has been pos- tulated by Arkell . . . and Clark . . . , the wavy-line and other wares of the Early Khartoum were an early and independent development on the Upper Nile."37 The lack of the earliest traits of wavy-line and dotted wavy-line motifs in the A-Group can no doubt be explained by the lack of contempo- raneity between the A-Group and the Early Khartoum complexes. Not only were numerous traits of the more contemporaneous Khartoum Neolithic absorbed by the A-Group, but so too were those important characteristics of burnish- ing and black mouthed and black-topped wares. 34 J.

Model for A-Group relationships.</page><page sequence="14">140 JARCE XXXVII (2000) Both the black-topped and highly burnished wares of the Khartoum Neolithic at Shaheinab are thought, probably correctly, to have been the progenitors of the fine rippled wares of the A-Group.38 Both traits were also known in the Abkan, and thus reached Lower Nubia prior to the emergence of the A-Group. Returning to the model for A-Group relation- ships, it seems likely that Khartoum Neolithic ceramic motifs were acquired through contact with or diffusion from the sites of Kadero (prin- cipally), as well as Geili, Shaheinab, and possibly Zakiab. From these regions a northward diffu- sion of traits is likely to have occurred through the Karat Group of the Dongola Reach and the Khartoum Variant of the Second Cataract re- gion. The possibility of diffusion does not, of course, preclude direct or indirect A-Group con- tact with these areas. Cultural exchange along the Nile does not account for all of the Khar- toum Neolithic motifs in A-Group ceramics, as is clear from the presence of shared pottery de- signs between Shaqadud and the A-Group that do not appear in the Dongola Reach. Thus, direct A-Group links with the site of Shaqadud in the Butana is favored. This probability is helped by the partial contemporaneity between the A-Group and Shaqadud complexes. A-Group relationships in the Shendi Reach are only weakly suggested by ceramic traits, but other types of evidence such as the dog burial and the infant pot burial at Kadada strengthen the arguments for A-Group/ Shendi Reach interconnections. The other regions with which the A-Group seems to have had substantial relationships are the Western Desert of Egypt and the western regions of the Sudan. It is difficult to ascertain at present whether the links with one region outweighed those of the other. Accumulating evidence now suggests the possibility of stronger links with the Wadi Howar through the branch of the Lower Wadi Howar that connected with the Nile in antiquity. It is also difficult to decide at present whether A-Group relations with the Wadi Howar operated primarily from east to west or from west to east. The likelihood of a Western Desert origin of some A-Group ceramic motifs greatly increases the chances of finding further evidence of A-Group relations with this area. There seems little doubt now that the in- habitants of the Western Desert and the west- ern Sudan had contact with the Abkan peoples of Lower Nubia prior to the emergence of the A-Group. Given this circumstance we can spec- ulate about the possibility of a migration of pas- toralists eastward into the Lower Nubian Nile Valley, thus contributing a strong pastoral ele- ment to some of the cultures there. Both the A-Group and the Karat Group are strongly sug- gested as recipients of such an influx. As for the oases of the Western Desert, nothing substan- tial can be ventured about the possibility of A-Group connections with these regions, except for the possible influx of agricultural knowl- edge. The only other exception may be Dakhleh Oasis, which has potential for showing connec- tions with the Nile Valley, if McDonald is cor- rect in her assessment that some material belongs to the Sudanese Neolithic tradition. The little evidence that exists concerning the Nilotic rela- tionships of the Dakhleh Oasis is not yet sug- gestive of specific links with the A-Group, but rather, is more suggestive of links with the sur- rounding desert regions. The same may be said of all of the Western Desert oases. Lastly, the preliminary nature of this study must be acknowledged. It is only recently, with the discovery of new archaeological assemblages in such regions as the Butana, the Atbai, and the Wadi Howar, that the networks of cultural ex- change between Nile and non-Nile environments in the Sudan have been somewhat elucidated. However, the detailed analytical and comparative work that would define these types of intercon- nections have not generally been undertaken. A study of A-Group interconnections such as this could not, until recently, be reasonably well attempted. University of Toronto 38 For a discussion of the earliest black-topped pottery see A. J.
