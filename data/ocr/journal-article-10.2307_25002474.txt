<plain_text><page sequence="1">READING THE RACED AND SEXED BODY IN THE COLOR PURPLE Repatterning White Feminist and Womanist Theological Hermeneutics Margaret D. Kamitsuka Since the publication of such groundbreaking texts as Carol Christ's Div ing Deep and Surfacing and Katie Cannon's Black Womanist Ethics, white feminist and womanist scholars in religion have promoted the notion that vital theological and ethical writing must remain connected to the subtleties of human experience as a source and norm.' Literature has often been an impor tant means to this end. Theological uses of a diverse canon of literary works have captured the imagination of a broad spectrum of women. The scholars' intentions and literary sources may be multicultural, but some troubling read ing practices are also evident. Whereas womanist theologians tend to empha size differences of race in their readings of women's literature, white feminist theologians tend to obscure those differences. If we turn to other markers of difference (specifically sexuality), an analogous problem often emerges in both white and African American feminist reading practices-that is, there is a ten dency to overlook sexualities outside of the dominant heterosexual paradigm. Indeed, the very notions of sexuality and sex differences remain largely unthe orized, with disturbing effects, especially for constructive theology and ethics claiming to be grounded in women's experience. This article brings critical at tention to some ways in which differences of race and sexuality are overlooked in white feminist and womanist theological readings of Alice Walker's The Carol P. Christ, Diving Deep and Surfacing: Women Writers on Spiritual Quest (Boston: Beacon, 1980); Katie G. Cannon, Black Womanist Ethics (Atlanta: Scholars, 1988). A note about ter minology is important from the start. The term "womanist" is now widely used by African American women scholars who call attention to how "feminist" has long functioned as an unmarked code for white feminism. To help break this code, some white feminist theologians, myself included, are call ing for an intentional naming of white feminist theology, which could clear the way for "feminist" to function as a neutral, uncoded term-if care is taken by hegemonic positionings to self-name.

Armour, Deconstruction, Feminist Theology, and the Problem of Difference: Subverting the Race/Gender Divide (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1999).</page><page sequence="2">46 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion Color Purple. I will propose tools for theorizing selfhood and agency (applying concepts borrowed from secular feminist theorists Judith Butler and Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak) that could help to repattern feminist theological reading practices toward a hermeneutic more attentive to women's differences of race and sexuality.2 The broader context for thinking about feminist hermeneutical practices is the debate over the validity of appealing to the notion of "women's experi ence." Appealing to women's experience as a norm for feminist theology has a stormy history. Until recently there were two major camps: first-wave (mostly white) feminist theologians who appealed to a common women's experience of oppression, usually linked to the objective of combating the hegemonic forces of patriarchy;3 and feminist theologians from minority communities who chal lenged the validity of any such appeal, because of the way it overlooks or un derplays differences in women's experiences. Women scholars within this sec ond group have focused on the particularities of women's experiences within their own (African American, Hispanic, lesbian, etc.) communities where en ergies have been directed to consolidating communal identity as a basis for po litical action.4 Recently a small number of feminist theologians have begun to dispute, from a more postmodern perspective, the validity of an appeal to women's experience, whether universalized or particularized. This third group argues that notions of unitary selves and common experience have become so problematic as to have lost their purchase as authoritative sources or norms for theological claims and political programs.5 It would seem that feminist schol arship in religion is deeply fractured because of the lack of a common vocabu lary, let alone consensus, about how to address differences among women's ex 2 There are, of course, many other issues relevant to differences among women where women have experienced discrimination: class, ethnicity, education, age, and so on. For reasons of space lim itations, I am focusing on race and sexuality. 3 Texts manifesting this approach are well known and include Rosemary Radford Ruether, Sexism and God-Talk: Toward a Feminist Theology (Boston: Beacon, 1983); and Mary Daly, Beyond God the Father: Toward a Philosophy of Women's Liberation (Boston: Beacon, 1973). Serene Jones sees certain "universalizing gestures" persisting in second-wave feminist theological writings as well; see her "Women's Experience between a Rock and a Hard Place: Feminist, Womanist, and Mu jerista Theologies in North America," in Horizons in Feminist Theology: Identity, Tradition, and Norms, ed.

This article attempts to negotiate a path that moves between the concerns voiced by theologians in the second and third groups about the ap peal to women's experience. I am not suggesting that no attempts have been made thus far among fem inist theologians of diverse races and sexual orientations to avoid essentializing and to learn of one another's differences. Notable among these attempts was that of the Mud Flower Collective, a group of women scholars in religion whose multicultural reflections were compiled almost two decades ago in God's Fierce Whimsy.6 Such interchange is important, but we must be careful about concluding that, because groups of women from diverse backgrounds have previously come together and shared with each other in this way, the bases for understanding women's differences and forming women's alliances have been established. One example from the Mud Flower Collective's dia logues will make my point. Emerging from their reading of Walker's The Color Purple, African American theologian Katie Cannon and white lesbian theolo gian Carter Heyward began a dialogue through letters entitled "Can We Be Different but Not Alienated?" which continues to be reprinted and circulated widely.7 In this exchange Cannon and Heyward explore themes of racial dif ference and the possibility of finding commonalities among black and white women's experiences. In one especially frank and poignant moment, Cannon addresses Heyward's experience of being molested as a child by a black man an experience Cannon also suffered. Cannon uses themes from The Color Pur ple (Celie, the protagonist, is also sexually abused) to share with Heyward how she is finding healing and to encourage Heyward in her path of recovery. An uncritical reading of these letters might lead one to conclude that find ing experiential commonalities of a significant sort (e.g., having suffered sexual abuse) can be the basis for conversation in which differences melt away. In par ticular, a "sentimental" reading of these two women's letters might attempt to dispel differences of race and to forge sisterhood through "the invocation of tears" on the part of the empathetic reader.8 However, the discovery of this shared, very personal, and painful experience is also a discovery of deep racial differences; differences of class or sexuality are not really discussed. Heyward makes a frank confession of experiencing a disturbing distrust of black men. 6 Katie G. Cannon et al., God's Fierce Whimsy: Christian Feminism and Theological Educa tion (New York: Pilgrim, 1985). I refer to Katie G. Cannon and Carter Heyward, "Can We Be Different but Not Alienated? An Exchange of Letters," in Feminist Theological Ethics: A Reader, ed. Lois K. Daly (Louisville, Ky.: Westminster/John Knox, 1994), 59-76. 8 Robyn Wiegman discusses this reading strategy in relation to Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin where Uncle Tom's suffering is used to evoke, via a regime of sentiment, a "political al liance between slaves and [the] white women" who made up a large segment of Stowe's original readership. See her American Anatomies: Theorizing Race and Gender (Durham, N.C.: Duke Uni versity Press, 1995), 195.</page><page sequence="4">48 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion Cannon empathizes with the ongoing trauma of living with a "place inside you that has not healed from violation" but expresses no similar aversion to black men as a whole-only to "those who remind me of the boy who molested me."9 One sees immediately that Heyward's trauma is shaped by a dominant white racist cultural myth of the predatory black male, whereas Cannon's trauma is not. The two women cry the same salty tears as a result of their childhood vio lation, but the experience and its effects are different. A reader's sentimental appeal to shared suffering masks the differences between interracial versus black-on-black sexual molestation within a white racist society.10 Does this mean that merely naming visible racial differences brings us in touch with the "real facts" and that all we need to do is uncover them to find what really separates women? Or can naming visible differences itself serve as an essentializing mask? If so, then "difference" itself is a complex notion that needs to be theorized. This article proposes some tools for theorizing differ ence in relation to women's selfhood and agency-tools that could be used as part of a critical hermeneutic in feminist theological reading practices. I will argue that white feminist and womanist theologies would benefit from a hermeneutic informed by (1) an identity-politics approach to fostering com munal identity and agency in opposition to structures of oppression; (2) a post structuralist approach to analyzing how selves are discursively produced in re lation to power/knowledge mechanisms (to use Michel Foucault's concepts);1 and (3) a postcolonialist approach to fostering political resistance by subaltern subjects. The first approach is found in many womanist theological writings and can be used to contest color-blind literary interpretations of African Amer ican women's literature. The second approach exemplifies a relatively new postmodern perspective in feminist theology, so far espoused mostly by white feminist theologians (I will focus later in the article on Butler's poststructural ist notion of the self as discursively constructed and "performed"). The third, postcolonialist approach is the newest for feminist religious scholarship, repre sented here by Spivak's notion of "strategic" essentializations of the subaltern self.12 Can these approaches to theorizing identity and difference be seen as 9 Cannon and Heyward, "Can We Be Different?" 73, 74. 10 Black literary critic Valerie Smith's discussion of race and rape is pertinent to the submerged racial subtext in the Cannon-Heyward correspondence.

I believe that it is possible to draw on the valuable insights from all three perspectives.'3 We need a certain amount of identity politics to contest hegemonic, idealized abstractions about women and to promote mod els of liberation and well-being for oppressed communities. To the extent that those models rely on essentialisms, one could, from Spivak's postcolonialist perspective, view them as contextually and politically strategic, hence tempo rary. In so doing, one could affirm an emancipatory identity politics without employing static essentialisms of what it means to be, for example, African American, Latina, lesbian, or Asian American. One could also promote a post moder view of discursively produced agency while avoiding any "dismissive gesture that consigns everything but the act of poststructuralist problematizing to a bankrupt and naive humanism."l4 Walker's The Color Purple-still one of the most often quoted pieces of lit erature in feminist theological writings-is a novel well suited to test my the sis. I want to bring critical attention to bear on how some white feminist and womanist theological reading practices either promote or inhibit awareness of differences of race and sexuality in women's experiences as they are portrayed literarily. Specifically, some white feminist theologians tend to engage in what I would call color-blind appropriations of the spiritual themes in Walker's text. Further, many white feminist and womanist theological readings of The Color Purple largely ignore or downplay the protagonist Celie's lesbianism and the way that her discovery of her own sexuality is part and parcel of her discovery of a divine, loving Spirit in the world. In effect, these readings render the les bian body invisible and risk constituting a hegemonic assertion of what Butler calls "naturalized heterosexuality."15 These problems occur even when every good intention is exerted to be open to racial and sexual otherness. Intentions, however, are not my focus here. I am interested not in blame laying but in hermeneutical repatterning. How we read texts reflects how we "read" the world, and that hermeneutic plays itself out in ways of which we are not often consciously aware. My analysis of how certain interpretations and uses of The Color Purple promote a disembodied spirituality-manifested by color-blind litically engaged, oppressed subject while also acknowledging that any revolutionary or liberationist consciousness must be read in terms of its discursive complexity. The selfs essence is seen as a kind of "theoretical fiction" invoked for "strategic use ... in a scrupulously visible political interest" (213, 214). See also Laura E. Donaldson and Kwok Pui-lan, eds., Postcolonialism, Feminism, and Reli gious Discourse (New York: Routledge, 2002). 13 For debates between feminist proponents of identity politics and postmodernism, see Linda J.

This critical study of white and womanist theological reading practices is not without its risks and is therefore addressed to this forum, which promotes interactions and roundtables from diverse women's perspectives. To bring a critique to bear on womanist theological reading practices should not be seen as an excuse by white feminists such as me to be less vigilant in interrogating racism in our own reading practices. Indeed, the point of this essay is to remain vigilant on that front and, by extension, others. Some white feminist scholars believe that they "should not presume to be addressing black women at all. We middle-class, white women must learn to listen and educate ourselves."16 Mo tivating this observation is the legitimate concern about the effects of the his tory of white liberal entitlement, so trenchantly critiqued since the advent of the black power movement and still affecting academe today. Interrogating whiteness and its hegemony remains an extraordinarily difficult task. However, I do not believe that white feminist theologians should undertake this project while recusing themselves from multicultural critical dialogue.17 Indeed, the opposite is the case. To refuse to engage critically the views of feminist schol ars from minority communities is to patronize them, which insidiously rein forces white privilege. "Seeing" Color in The Color Purple In some ways, Alice Walker's The Color Purple almost invites color-blind readings from a white readership. Because of the personal, introspective, time less tone created in Celie's letters to God, white readers are tempted to forget that Celie's story begins in the pre-World War II, rural, segregated South. Be cause of the novel's focus on the abuse of women within black families,l8 white readers are tempted to forget that this is also a story of white racism. But, just as readers of The Diary of Anne Frank should not forget that Anne was Jew ish, with all that being Jewish connoted under Hitler's rule, white readers of The Color Purple should not forget that Celie is a poor, semiliterate black woman, with all that connotes in the United States.

Ikenna Dieke (Westport, Conn.: Greenwood, 1999).</page><page sequence="7">Kamitsuka: Reading the Raced and Sexed Body 51 in The Color Purple-the focus of most white feminist theological readings can be understood only as it intersects with, among other things, racial dis crimination. The novel opens with the voice of Celie's sexually abusive stepfather threatening the fourteen-year-old Celie-"You better not never tell nobody but God"-thus implicating God in the conspiracy of silence surrounding the sex ual abuse of which Celie is a victim. Before she is twenty years old, Celie has been impregnated twice by rape, has been forced to give her babies up for adoption, and has been married off to a much older and abusive man. All the while, she prays and writes letters to a silent God: "Dear God ... Maybe you can give me a sign letting me know what is happening to me."19 Her suffering and the silence of God galvanize an image of God in Celie's mind that is dis lodged only after Celie meets Shug Avery, her husband's mistress. Shug be friends Celie and eventually becomes her lover, giving Celie some of the af fection and nurture she has never had as either a child or an adult. While encouraging Celie to stand up to her husband and to enjoy her own sexuality, Shug also teaches her a new spirituality-a belief in a divine Spirit that imbues all creation. The spirituality Celie embraces has concrete interpersonal ramifi cations for Celie's family and friends. The story culminates in a reconciliation between Celie and her husband, Albert (previously identified only as "Mr. - --" by Celie), who himself undergoes a kind of conversion that allows him to see Celie as a person to whom he must make amends. The closing scene, in which Celie is reunited with her children and her long-lost sister, is an idyllic vision of a black woman who has battled for personal survival and, having achieved it, reaps reconciliation and peace for her extended family as well. I agree with womanist readers that Celie's rejection (under Shug's tute lage) of the belief that God is "big and old and tall and graybearded and white" (201) cannot be divorced from her firsthand experience of oppression by white people. Walker does not engage in diatribes against racism and white privilege, but the theme is powerfully communicated narratively in one episode in par ticular, when Celie's stepdaughter-in-law, Sofia, a formidable-looking woman who does not suffer fools of any color, drives into town with her children. The narrative about Sofia continues in Celie's voice: ... Clam out on the street looking like somebody. Just then the [white] mayor and his wife come by. All these children, say the mayor's wife, digging in her pocketbook. Cute as little buttons though, she say. She stop, put her hand on one of the children head. Say, and such strong white teef. Sofia ... don't say nothing. .... Miss Millie finger the children some more, finally look at Sofia. .... She eye Sofia wristwatch.

Sofia say, Hell no. (90)20 The mayor intervenes, tempers flare, and a physical altercation ensues. The in evitable happens: Sofia is beaten to within an inch of her life and imprisoned. I contend that the meaning of Celie's rejection of a white (male) God is defined by this scene, in which Sofia dares to challenge-directly and physically white (patriarchal) privilege and is cruelly punished for her defiant act. White feminist theological interest in this story is a positive move; how ever, as Susan Brooks Thistlethwaite warns in Sex, Race, and God, white fem inist theologians such as her should not "use the fiction of black women as a source in the same way [we] ... have been able to use the fiction of white women ... for white feminist theology."21 Not only have white feminists often overlooked the racial component of the texts of African American women writ ers, but also the way they have read these texts reinforces their tendencies to universalize women's experience under white racial and cultural codes of women's authentic spirituality. Thistlethwaite notes that white feminist theolo gians are drawn, in particular, to the reimaging of God in a conversation be tween Shug and Celie where Shug explains, "My first step from [God as] the old white man was trees. Then air. Then birds. Then other people" (203). How ever, as Thistlethwaite rightly observes, "no white feminist who has quoted this passage from The Color Purple has ever remarked on the rejection of the whiteness of God."22 She is not suggesting that it is illegitimate for anyone out side the African American community to interpret or use its literature; rather, her point is that white feminists need to recognize that their interpretive lenses are different from those of womanists. White feminists deceive themselves if they believe that the ways they have theologically interpreted texts like The Color Purple-a novel quoted, Thistlethwaite notes sardonically, by "virtually every white feminist I know"-are not implicit assertions of their "class pre rogative" of whiteness.23 Thistlethwaite's text, published in 1989, set us on a needful course of thinking regarding race and color-blind white feminist ap propriations of African American literature. Nevertheless, color-blind uses of The Color Purple can still be found in many white feminist theological writings. 20 This scene has been highlighted as an example of the "'sass' and impertinence" of the "out raged mother figure" depicted in African American women's novels in Joanne M. Braxton, "Ances tral Presence: The Outraged Mother Figure in Contemporary Afra-American Writing," in Wild Women in the Whirlwind: Afra-American Culture and the Contemporary Literary Renaissance, ed.

Daphne Hampson uses The Color Purple as part of her attempt to recon ceptualize God from a post-Christian feminist perspective in her Theology and Feminism.25 Her theological project is aimed at "a non-anthropomorphic un derstanding of God, in which God is not conceived of as a discrete entity of which a personal pronoun [whether He or She] could be used."26 Hampson credits Walker with exemplifying the type of feminist theological imagination free from the strictures of the anthropomorphic, androcentric Christian para digm. She quotes at length from the section of Walker's novel in which Celie and Shug discuss the nature of God: "I believe God is everything, say Shug. Everything that is or ever was or ever will be. And when you can feel that, and be happy to feel that, you've found It" (202-3). Given that Shug tells Celie that "[a]ny God I ever felt in church I brought in with me" (200-201), Hampson concludes that Walker's text teaches us that being religious means getting rid of a church-linked God and relating to a divine Spirit who is everywhere and inside everyone.27 Although Hampson is on target in identifying the nonanthropomorphic orientation of Shug's spirituality, I would argue that Hampson reads that spiri tuality through a too exclusively white feminist interpretive grid and thus misses the meaning that Shug's words might carry for many African American women readers. As Thistlethwaite might point out, on the one hand, Hamp son's interpretation of Shug's spirituality highlights white feminist religious sensibilities (e.g., themes of connectedness with nature and distancing from God the Father).28 A womanist identity-politics approach, on the other hand, might highlight the African American aspects of Shug's spirituality. For exam ple, when Shug says, "[O]ne day when I was sitting quiet and feeling like a motherless child ... it come to me: that feeling of being a part of everything" (203), womanist readers might point out the African American Christian sub text for Shug's words. Shug is referring to "what 'everybody knows' in the black 24 As Robyn Wiegman writes, "Too often .. white women situate themselves as the moral guardians of'race,' policing other white women for evidence of racist transgressions, as if [this] ... demonstrates our own willful noncomplicity" (American Anatomies, 189). The temptation to moral superiority can be averted, hopefully, by refusing any claim to an unimpeachable, "policing" author ity on discussions of race, sexuality, and other sites of identity construction. 25 Daphne Hampson's Theology and Feminism (Oxford: Blackwell, 1990) appeared the year following Thistlethwaite's book, so while Hampson was writing her book she most likely was not aware of the charges Thistlethwaite would level against white feminists who quote from The Color Purple. Hampson is virtually silent on the issue of race in her subsequently published After Chris tianity (Valley Forge, Pa.: Trinity, 1996), presented as a follow-up to Theology and Feminism. 26 Hampson, Theology and Feminism, 149-50. 27 See ibid., 165-66. 28 See Thistlethwaite, Sex, Race, and God, 60-76, 110-25.</page><page sequence="10">54 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion church, that 'God is a mother to the motherless and a father to the father less'"-biblically derived images found in many black-church sermons and hymns.29 In other words, Shug's non-anthropomorphic experience of spiritual oneness with nature through love for "the color purple in a field" (203) can be read as mediated via her particular experiences as an African American woman.30 Furthermore, her spirituality, though not traditionally Christian, is articulated at times via imagery from the black church. Hence, although Walker distinguishes Shug's spirituality from the institutional black church, she nevertheless portrays that spirituality as retaining important links to the eman cipatory struggles of the African American Christian community by sharing its imagery. When Hampson describes the spirituality of Celie and Shug, she affirms the post-Christian aspects of their spirituality but makes no reference to how the two women are linked to the black community. The unavoidable, if unin tentional, effect is that womanist spiritual exploration is appropriated into a white feminist paradigm, and a rift is created between the spirituality of Celie and Shug on the one hand and more traditional black Christian spirituality on the other. A womanist identity-politics reading, however, might emphasize that Celie's non-institutional spiritual journey and the religious commitment of her missionary sister, Nettie, are never put into conflict. In the narrative world of Walker's story, these two spiritualities coexist peacefully, joined by the love and solidarity between the two long-separated African American sisters whose lives have taken such divergent paths.31 From this perspective, the racial differences between Hampson and Shug are at least as significant as the theological dif ferences between Shug and Nettie. I have no doubt that Hampson quotes from Walker's novel to convey an appreciation of nature-oriented spirituality and to credit Walker for showing her a post-Christian way toward God. However, by rendering race an extraneous detail of Shug's spirituality, Hampson's reading elides the racial differences between womanist post-Christian and white femi nist post-Christian spiritualities. Furthermore, the solidarity between Christian 29 Cheryl Townsend Gilkes, "'Mother to the Motherless, Father to the Fatherless': Power, Gender, and Community in Afrocentric Biblical Tradition," Semeia 47 (1989): 61. See also ibid., 116. 30 Thistlethwaite argues that "the natural world is always mediated by human consciousness and its social conditions," and "no assumptions of... women's capacity, to relate to their 'sister,' the earth, can be made without considering the factor of race" (Sex, Race, and God, 58, 70).

Carol J. Adams (New York: Continuum, 1993), 191-204. 31 Deborah McDowell explores how the writing relationship between Celie and Nettie fosters Celie's identity development as a writer-and, by extension, symbolizes the development of African American women's literary voice.

In Hampson's reading, we see how white feminist theology can impose a universalizing, color-blind grid on Walker's text. This seems to confirm the need for a strong womanist identity-politics approach to contest color-blind reading practices. Delores Williams and Emilie Townes do not discuss theories of identity politics; nevertheless, their readings of The Color Purple model some aspects of this hermeneutical approach and stand in contrast to Hamp son's. Williams and Townes are interested in promoting African American women's moral and spiritual identity as a basis for ethical and political engage ment on the part of the black church. Williams asserts that The Color Purple exemplifies a "catalyst and moral-agent model" of "black women's social and religious experience" whereby one strong black woman is instrumental in help ing another move from abuse and bondage to "full moral agency" and "libera tion."32 Williams is saying not that this model functions only in an African American setting but that it reflects the reality of how and why Celie needs black women as catalysts in her life, because of the specific "racial oppression and cultural traditions shared with all black people." Shug helps Celie see a loving Spirit beyond the old-white-man God, and Celie learns (especially through Sofia) how her own personal survival is precarious unless it is part of a communal "black family liberation."33 In other words, Celie's moral and spir itual liberation takes place in the context of racial marginalization. Williams would insist that a reading practice that pays attention to racial markers of dif ference also illumines white women's need to liberate themselves not just from patriarchal victimization but also from their own "participation with white men in the oppression of black women."34 Townes paints a similar liberationist image: "As Celie's horizons expand, she moves from her restricted, individual world in which exploitation is daily common fare into a universe of Black folk moving into Spirit-filled tomor rows."35 Townes lauds this new spirituality, which not only clearly indicts a white racist God but also transcends any particular image of God as male or fe male by presenting God as living Spirit. She heralds Walker's portrayal of Celie's spiritual journey as paving "the way for a new understanding of God for Black children, men and women ... a pathway to a deepening spirituality and a liberating hope" that can renew the African American religious community.36 32 Delores S.

Their emphasis on the (visible) markers of race-based oppression in Walker's novel has all the marks of an iden tity-politics account of black women's experience in a racist society.37 However, they depart from a strict identity-politics approach especially on the subject of black women's sexual identity. This suggests the need to theorize the intersec tions of race, gender, and sexuality beyond an identity-politics perspective.38 In the following section I will argue for using poststructuralist tools for theorizing selfhood as a complex discursive site open to multiple performative resignifica tions of identity, while also insisting on the importance of postcolonialist tools for retaining certain strategic essentializations of subaltern political subjects and their communities. Reading the Black Lesbian and Bisexual Body A troubling pattern shared by many white feminist and womanist theolog ical readings of The Color Purple is overlooking or downplaying themes of les bianism and bisexuality. In general, most theologians tiptoe delicately around issues of spirituality and sexuality. The reasons for this are too historically, cul turally, and theologically complex to investigate here.39 Suffice it to say that all Christians suffer from negative body attitudes that have infused the church for centuries, and that gays, lesbians, bisexuals, and persons with other marginal sexual and gender identities suffer in particular from legacies of heterosexism. Attitudes toward embodiment and sexuality have a manifestation in the African American church that is inextricably connected to the experience of slavery and ongoing white racism (as we will see Williams and Townes emphasize in this section). Feminist scholars have initiated much new thinking about the 37 Another forceful identity-politics reading of Walker's novel is Cheryl Townsend Gilkes, "'A Conscious Connection to All That Is': The Color Purple as Subversive and Cultural Ethnography," in Embracing the Spirit: Womanist Perspectives on Hope, Salvation, and Transformation, ed.

Even feminist theolo gians accustomed to discussions of women's bodies shy away from Walker's de pictions of physical affection between Shug and Celie: I believe God is everything, say Shug.... It sort of like you know what, she say, grinning and rubbing high up on my thigh. Shug! I say. Oh, she say. God love all them feelings. (202-3) Few theologians affirm Shug's sexually expressive spirituality. The feminist the ological gaze is discretely averted from that thigh rub.40 If white feminist theology is going to rectify its tendency to overlook dif ference, it will need to do so across the board, as there is a danger that one eli sion of difference tends to lead to another. Abstracting the black female expe rience in a color-blind way often goes hand in hand with overlooking black female sexuality, with the effect, in the case of Walker's novel, of rendering the black lesbian and bisexual body invisible. With womanist theology we have a different but related situation. In some womanist theological readings of The Color Purple, the black body is pulled into focus as a site of racial oppression while lesbian and bisexual markers of difference are downplayed. Among white feminist and womanist theologians, one type of reading practice that renders the lesbian and bisexual body invisible is the practice of characterizing Celie and Shug's relationship as primarily friendship or sisterhood. This reading practice is often quite subtle. I highlight two examples to show how feminist theologians might helpfully repattem the ways we talk theologically about bod ies, sexuality, and spirituality. I use as my first example an article by white feminist theologian Mary Catherine Hilkert, who explores how feminist thinkers negotiate fidelity to a religious tradition in light of new contextual challenges. Hilkert turns to Walker's text because it exemplifies the notion that "God is to be discovered in human experience ... in the depth of the human heart." This revelatory dis covery of the divine within humankind happens especially, she argues, in the experience of women's friendships. Hilkert refers to The Color Purple as an il 40 One notable exception is womanist theologian JoAnne Marie Terrell, who explicitly high lights this passage in Power in the Blood? The Cross in the African American Experience (Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1998), 129, and supports Walker's womanist principle of loving women and men "'sexu ally and/or nonsexually'" (137). For Walker's definition of womanist, see In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens: Womanist Prose (San Diego: Harcourt Brace, 1983), xi-xii. The sexual component of Walker's definition has made the term controversial, and some African American women theologians do not accept it. See Cheryl J. Sanders et al., "Roundtable Discussion: Christian Ethics and Theology in Womanist Perspective," Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion 5 (1989), and the response by Kelly Brown Douglas in The Black Christ (Maryknoll, N.Y.: Orbis, 1994), 101.</page><page sequence="14">58 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion lustration: "Human friendship, such as that between Celie and Shug, is often used as the key metaphor for the experience of divine-human relationship."41 I agree with Hilkert's theological insight about the importance of the metaphor of friendship, but I raise a cautionary flag. Appeals to friendship without qual ification can mask important particularities. In this case, Celie and Shug's race is not mentioned, and lesbianism is only alluded to by Hilkert's citation of Mary Hunt's Fierce Tenderness in a footnote.42 The problem here is twofold. First, the significance of Hunt's text is lost on all but feminist theological insiders who are aware of the lesbian perspective in Hunt's book. Second, the text by Hunt, who is a white lesbian, is left to do the work of marking the sexual orientation of Celie, a black woman. I believe Hilkert would agree with me that this is an opportunity for hermeneutical repatterning in white feminist reading practices in order to give more emphasis to the complex interworkings of racial and sex ual identity and thus to increase appreciation of differences in women's experiences.43 A different but related dynamic is at work in an article by womanist scholar Cheryl Kirk-Duggan, who emphasizes the black sisterhood of Celie and Shug but de-emphasizes their lesbian relationship. Kirk-Duggan approaches Walker's novel by setting it within a larger context of "the violent abuse that characterizes the human condition," using as her theoretical framework Rene Girard's psychosocial philosophy of religion as an approach to the issue of vio lence and sacrificial death.44 From his study of religious rites, Girard concludes that scapegoating and violence, which originate in mimetic desire, are central to (Western) religion and have pervaded all kinship, civil, and taboo structures in the west. The cycle of violence continues because the tendency to resolve desire through conflict is learned and passed on. Kirk-Duggan insightfully reads Celie's story as marked, in some respects, by the kind of primal scape goating myth of which Girard speaks. For example, Celie, in an effort to pro tect her younger sister from their stepfather's sexual abuse, "offers herself to be raped instead. Thus Celie as victim of incest becomes her stepfather's 41 Mary Catherine Hilkert, "Experience and Tradition-Can the Center Hold?" in Freeing Theology: The Essentials of Theology in Feminist Perspective, ed.

Hunt, Fierce Tenderness: A Feminist Theology of Friendship (New York: Crossroad, 1991). 43 Hilkert elsewhere strongly promotes attending to the particularities of marginalization and relates this point to the use of the literature from minority communities: "But attending to 'the other' does not mean borrowing their stories ... without entering into real relationship with them and join ing in the struggle to change unjust social and political systems. To do so, however, requires that members of dominant groups recognize their own complicity in systems of oppression." See Naming Grace: Preaching and the Sacramental Imagination (New York: Continuum, 1997), 176. 44 Cheryl A.

Nonetheless, Kirk-Duggan states that instead of "mimetic vi olence ... intensify[ing] between them ..., Celie and Shug become friends!"46 This statement is appropriate insofar as it attempts to show how Walker's novel breaks the Girardian pattern. However, Kirk-Duggan goes further when she argues that "many readers conclude that The Color Purple is a story about les bian love. Yet Walker's novel focuses more broadly on the bonds of love shared in sisterhood." Here Kirk-Duggan seems to prioritize sisterhood over lesbian love. One sees this prioritizing subtly played out when she discusses how Celie and Shug's relationship developed out of the "natural bonding between women as sisters and as mother and daughter."47 Lesbianism is not mentioned among these "natural" liaisons-even though Walker does everything she can in her narrative to portray Celie and Shug's lesbian love as a natural event in their community of heterosexual friends and family.48 Here again we have an oppor tunity for hermeneutical repatterning in order to avoid any unintentional hier archies of sexual and non-sexual forms of love among women based on unin terrogated notions of naturalness. I believe Kirk-Duggan would agree with such a hermeneutical move, given that elsewhere she takes an explicit stance affirming black women's various sexualities.49 What sort of hermeneutical approach would cultivate attentiveness to racial and sexual particularity and would avoid hierarchies in models of woman 45 Ibid., 273. 46 Ibid., 274. 47 Ibid., 284,284 n. 63. 48 For Barbara Smith, the lesbian relationship in The Color Purple has an almost idyllic air to it. She concludes that Walker's story is not a "realistic work" vis-a-vis lesbianism; yet she writes, "I am moved by the vision of a world, unlike this one, where Black women are not forced to lose their fam ilies ... because of whom they love." The complete lack of homophobia makes the story function as a moral "fable"-a happy vision of how things might be. See Smith's "The Truth That Never Hurts: Black Lesbians in Fiction in the 1980s," in Braxton and McLaughlin, Wild Women in the Whirlwind, 237, 232. By contrast, bell hooks concludes that the "ideal world of true love and commitment" that Walker creates is a dangerous "fantasy of change without effort ... a brand of false consciousness that keeps everyone in place and oppressive structures intact." See "Reading and Resistance: The Color Purple," in Alice Walker: Critical Perspectives Past and Present, ed. Henry Louis Gates Jr. and K. A. Appiah (New York: Amistad, 1993), 287, 295. Townes would agree that Celie "lives an interior liberation [that] is no threat to the social order," but Townes nevertheless believes Walker's story is an important spiritual "guide" for African Americans (In a Blaze of Glory, 71, 72). 49 In her "Justified, Sanctified, and Redeemed: Blessed Expectation in Black Women's Blues and Gospels" (in Townes, Embracing the Spirit), Kirk-Duggan highlights the rich mix of spirituality and sexuality in the songs of blues singer Ma Rainey, a "big-hearted woman [who] was sexually in volved with men and women." In Rainey's music, "[o]ne experiences hope and salvation through living life to its fullest... as a Black woman, especially sexually" (145, 157).</page><page sequence="16">60 Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion to-woman bonding? Delores Williams's womanist identity-politics reading of The Color Purple combines attentiveness to racial and sexual particularity by virtue of the way she construes Celie's lesbianism as integral to the novel's mes sage about her survival and transformation as a black woman. Because, as we have seen, Williams emphasizes the role of a strong black woman as a catalyst in the life of another oppressed black woman, Shug's relationship with Celie re ceives direct attention. Although Williams points out that sex is not the sum total of their relationship, she nevertheless presents Celie's spiritual journey as inextricably linked to her lesbian sexual self-discovery. Celie's development into "a self-confident lesbian woman" and "fully responsible moral agent" enables her to confront the sexism of the black men in her extended family-which in turn ultimately precipitates restitution and healing in those relationships. Williams draws from The Color Purple the theme that lesbian relationships can be "redemptive" and strengthening for the fabric of the black family.50 Williams includes Celie, a lesbian, and Shug, a bisexual, in the list of people who com munally nurture one another's children. At the end of the novel, Williams ex plains, "Celie refers to her children as 'our children,' meaning she, Nettie, Samuel, Shug, Mr. Albert, Sophia, and Harpo will provide care and nurture" for them.51 Thus, Williams's reading exemplifies attentiveness to color in The Color Purple (i.e., to the racist exploitation of black women's bodies, the fragility of the black family, black women's moral agency, and Celie's rejection of a white God) as well as attentiveness to diversity in the sexual identities of African American women. It is a rich and complex identity-politics reading and one that could be used to combat racism and heterosexism in the church. Nevertheless, Williams also indicates that understanding African American women's identity, particularly sexuality, requires a more historicist analysis that would seem to go beyond identity politics. Williams investigates the complex history of the exploitation of black women's bodies by white slave mas ters and by black men who, "since slavery, have tended to re-create their man hood to conform to the [patriarchal] model of manhood."52 She points out that colonialist white attitudes have insidiously influenced black aesthetic values so that light skin and smooth hair are valued among many African Americans.53 Townes also analyzes the way in which the "Black body has long been a site of 50 Delores S.

Poststructuralism, I would argue, not only sets selves in historical and cultural discursive contexts but also specifically addresses the issue of a natural sexed self. It is the concept of natural sex differentiation that Judith Butler argues is at the root of heterosexism. Historically, the theoretical context for Butler's questioning of gendered and sexed naturalism is Simone de Beauvoir's statement "One is not born a woman, but, rather, becomes one," which first established the notion (now broadly accepted) that gender (masculine and feminine) is culturally con structed.57 Butler's poststructuralism goes beyond Beauvoir's gender-construc tion position to posit that "'sex' is as culturally constructed as gender."58 There is no natural sexed subject prior to the discursive regimes that regulate and "contour the materiality of bodies."59 Butler is not questioning the biological realities of bodies; she is attempting to unmask poststructurally how the dom inant heterosexual matrix promulgates a binary male-female opposition by positing a "causal relation among sex, gender and desire" such that "sex can be understood in some sense to necessitate gender."60 That is, man is constructed as the male sex who desires the female; woman is constructed as the female sex who desires the male. This "naturalized heterosexuality requires and regulates gender as a binary relation ... accomplished through the practices of hetero sexual desire."61 According to this view, any other form of desire is an incoher 54 Townes, In a Blaze of Glory, 77. 55 Ibid., 70, 77. 56 Ibid., 87 (Townes's emphasis). 57 Simone de Beauvoir, The Second Sex, quoted in Butler, Gender Trouble, 8. 58 Butler, Gender Trouble, 7.

A number of other feminist theorists have questioned the givenness of the binary of male and female bodies, tracing historically the rise, around the eigh teenth century, of the discourse of men's and women's biological differences as "polar opposites." See Linda Nicholson, "Gender," in A Companion to Feminist Philosophy, ed. Alison M. Jaggar and Iris Marion Young (Malden, Mass.: Blackwell, 1998), 290. Feminist scholars in religion have noted the Greek-influenced theological tradition of viewing the female binarily as a deficient male.

Analyzing what Adrienne Rich has called compulsory heterosexuality in this poststructuralist manner reveals that its hegemony is a factor of its multi ple disciplinary force.62 That is, the institutional and cultural mechanisms of heterosexual society (advertising, education, religion, medicine, and so forth) manipulate discourses of natural and unnatural to produce subjects who con ceive of themselves as having a coherent sexuality secure in the intermeshing of biology and libido. This power/knowledge loop can be broken only by resig nifying gender, sex, and sexuality as discursively produced or, as Butler de scribes it, "performatively constituted"63-a notion she develops, drawing on the theories of speech-acts philosopher J. L. Austin and deconstructive philosopher Jacques Derrida. Butler states that a "performative act is one which brings into being or enacts what it names" (Austin's classic example of a performative utterance is the vow "I do," which constitutively inaugurates a marriage). Derrida takes in an intertextual direction this idea of words consti tuting a reality. Inherent to any discursive performance is (con)textual conven tion; when one acts, one is "citing" previous "texts" (with "texts" meaning not just writings but any signifying activity). The conclusion Butler draws is that "[t]o be constituted by language is to be ... open to resignification, redeploy ment, subversive citation from within."64 The agency thus produced comes from performatives (i.e., bodily performative acts) situated in terms of societal conventions that one both cites and resignifies in the process of one's utter ances or actions. In short, women and men perform cultural conventions of maleness and femaleness. For the most part, our performances are based on scripts of natural sexed identity that appeal to the materiality of bodies. The dominant script for sexuality historically has been heterosexuality. If, however, as Butler contends, heterosexuality is discursively produced, lesbianism is as well. Some lesbian feminists might object, charging that, if the naturalness of lesbian sexuality is discursively destabilized, lesbians will lose the foundational basis for combating discrimination. Monique Wittig's strategy has been to undo society's "heterosexual contract" by positing lesbians as a third sex outside the dominant heterosexual paradigm.6 Butler is both deeply influenced by this les bian identity-politics agenda and critical of its humanistic assumptions about 62 Adrienne Rich, "Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence," in The Lesbian and Gay Studies Reader, ed.

Butler argues, along Foucauldian lines, that heterosexuality is a power/knowledge discourse that cannot be transcended by asserting an alter native identity (the lesbian) outside its discursive sphere of influence. A lesbian identity-politics approach that insists on the notion of a natural lesbian sexual identity ironically strengthens the heterosexual regime it intends to overthrow, because it does not address heterosexism's discursive workings-namely the discourses of a normative male-female binary at work in any appeal to a natu ral, binarily sexed self. One subverts compulsory heterosexuality by exposing its power/knowledge script. Moreover, Butler argues for a Foucauldian analysis of power that focuses on the ways in which the disciplinary force of oppressive regimes is disseminated in local institutional networks. It is at the local level that one finds the emergence of transgressive practices-what Foucault calls "an insurrection of subjugated knowledges. 66 Foucauldian theory and Butler's version of it are not without controversy.67 Feminist theorists of color in particular have been wary of such theories and their links to white academe.68 Some, however, have found postmodern theory, Foucault in particular, to be an essential tool for critical analysis, especially when trying to decipher the workings of power in cultural attitudes toward bodies, sexuality, deviance, and moral compliance. Womanist theologian Kelly Brown Douglas uses Foucault to develop a womanist sexual discourse of re sistance to sexism and homophobia.6 Butler's particular theory of gender/sex construction may have a shock value, even for many progressive feminist thinkers today. It took many years for early feminists to convince men and women that biology is not destiny and that what it means to be masculine and feminine can change over time and across cultures. The claim that the notion of "natural sexed bodies" is also a 66 Foucault, Power/Knowledge, 81 (Foucault's emphasis). Foucault theorizes that power is not just coercive, it is also productive: "Power must be analysed as something which circulates.... It is never localised here or there" (98). "[Moreover,] there are no relations of power without resist ances ... [and,] like power, resistance is multiple and can be integrated in global strategies" (142). 67 See the debate encapsulated in Susan Hekman, ed., Feminist Interpretations of Michel Fou cault (University Park: Pennsylvania University Press, 1996). 68 See bell hooks, Yearning: Race, Gender, and Cultural Politics (Boston: South End, 1990), 24; and Paula M.

I do not promote frivolous identity deconstruction; I do, how ever, believe that heterosexism will persist as an (unwanted) entailment in fem inist scholarship in religion unless we take steps to unmask the roots of het erosexist privilege-namely the assumption of the givenness of (heterosexually determined) binary maleness and femaleness. There is no readily available way to prove definitively that binary sex/gender/desire discourse causes heterosex ual privilege. Nonetheless, given the long-standing link between a presumed natural male-female sex binary and heterosexism, it seems only prudent to plage the burden on those who continue to appeal to the natural sexed subject to prove that such an appeal does not entrench heterosexual privilege. Returning to our hermeneutical agenda, does this poststructuralist per spective on sexual identity illumine our reading of The Color Purple? Is Celie's black lesbianism best read not as a natural identity but rather as an identity constructed and performed in relation to discourses of race, family, religion, and so on? A poststructuralist way of construing sex, gender, and sexuality may come the closest to capturing what Walker is narratively theorizing in the fol lowing conversation between Celie and Mr. Mr.- ast me the other day what it is I love so much bout Shug. He say he love her style. He say ... Shug act more manly than most men. I mean she upright, honest.... Just like Sofia. ... I tell him. You not like this. What Shug got is womanly it seem like to me.... Sofia and Shug not like men, he say, but they not like women either. You mean they not like you or me. (276) Celie loves an "other" whose gender shifts and whose sexual desire is multiple. Shug, the object of Celie's and Mr. 's desire, is both manly and womanly but like neither men nor women. Furthermore, this gender description is ap plied to both Sofia, who is (performatively) heterosexual, and Shug, who is (performatively) bisexual. In this way, Walker can be read as interrupting the "causal relation among sex-gender-desire"70 and destabilizing the heterosexu ally linked man-woman binary. Celie's desire cannot, in this instance, be seen as an inversion of natural heterosexual desire. With the breakdown of the nat uralized heterosexual paradigm, Celie's lesbianism must be renegotiated as well. That is, her lesbian identity is not natural but performative. One could counter with the observation that within the story Celie's sexuality seems quite stable and natural (as opposed to Shug's, which is more fluid and changing). Even after Celie reconciles with Albert, she seems quite set and secure in her lesbian identity. Here we must clarify that the notion of performativity does not necessarily mean one is incapable of a perduring identity performance. It 70 Butler, Gender Trouble, 22.</page><page sequence="21">Kamitsuka: Reading the Raced and Sexed Body 65 merely signals that all identities are contextually situated and performed within a nexus of discursive relations-including discourses of natural sexed selves. The issue of losing the ability to bring a "real" lesbian body into focus is es pecially pertinent for feminist ethicists and theologians speaking to religious institutions that would like "out" homosexual believers simply to disappear. White feminist theologian Mary McClintock Fulkerson responds by insisting that the kind of poststructuralist deconstruction of sex/gender identity Butler offers is a needful approach for battling homophobia in Christian churches. She argues that to deconstruct claims of identity coherence follows the tradi tional Christian mandate to resist idolatries and to affirm the notion of human finitude and fallibility: "This Christian grammar of iconoclasm ... is, in short, intrinsically expandable-even to gendered identity itself." She believes that this deconstructive approach gives new (nonessentializing) meaning to the bib lical call for reconciliation and unity in Galatians 3:28, one of the New Testa ment passages most often quoted by Christian feminists: "There is no longer Jew or Greek, there is no longer slave or free, there is no longer male and fe male; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus" (NRSV). Christian communities have always interpreted Scripture through some conceptual filter; Fulkerson suggests that this passage could be read postmodernly as affirming that "we are all performing our sex/gender."71 The implications for constructive theologians or ethicists who appeal to women's experience are enormous. Whether one is formulating doctrinal or ethical claims, one must eschew attempting definitively to ground one's claims in some supposedly self-evident (racial, sexual, etc.) women's identity. Using poststructuralist theories like Butler's is an effective way to accomplish this. Viewing selves in terms of complex power/knowledge negotiations subverts es sentializing epistemologies of the visible while also (as Fulkerson claims) echo ing sound Christian grammars about resisting idolatry. Furthermore, this ap proach moves us toward a position that exposes and resists assertions of privilege by highlighting difference, fluidity, and the workings of power. However, I resist (perhaps more than Butler) throwing out the identity politics baby with the modernist bathwater. Given the kinds of color-blind and desexualized reading practices one can still detect in some feminist theological writings, there is still a good deal of benefit to be reaped from, at times, in voking visible markers of "real" difference to contest such disembodied read ings. Hence, my criterion is a pragmatic one of judiciously applying a hermeneutic informed by identity politics (strategically employed, as Spivak would say) as well as poststructuralism. Strategically essentialized identity pol itics can effectively highlight markers of difference, expose the insidious work 71 Mary McClintock Fulkerson, "Gender-Being It or Doing It: The Church, Homosexuality, and the Politics of Identity," in Que(e)rying Religion: A Critical Anthology, ed.

Poststructuralism, by virtue of its focus on identity con struction and performance, can help prevent a reinscription of new hege monies of the "real." Hopefully, this is not a crude and unaccountable pragmatism but one that could foster new and rich contestational religious nar ratives of otherness and responsible poststructuralist critiques that tumble our idols of identity without the moral indifference of endless postmodern play.</page></plain_text>
