The anti-capitaHst debate has traditionaUy drawn up battle lines between oppressed individuals on the one hand, and an oppressive system on the other. While this has high rhetorical value, it is based on imprecise use of language. The language confuses an amoral system with im/moral agents but at the same time uses anthropomorphic language to lend capitalism moral agency. This inevitably leads to a confused debate. Given that aU opponents of capitalism want the reformation of what they see as a flawed system, precision in the use of the language employed would move the debate into arenas of action, and thus the debate is more likely to generate change. KEY WORDS: anti-capitalism, capitalism, globalization, language, morality, theology Introduction It is curious that Daniel BeU's defiandy-named Lib eration Theology After The End Of History ? The Refusal To Cease Suffering has an entry in its index for "capitalism", but not one for "capitalists". On the other hand, throughout his book he refers to "lib erationists", establishing battle lines between "lib erationists" on the one hand and "capitalism" on the other. Where he does vary his terminology, seem ingly only for effect, he tends to refer to "the cap italist order" or "discipline": again the club and not the members.1 While it may be disingenuous to argue semantics over what remains a robustly argued book, this observation resonates with the general position taken in the modern anti-capitalist debate: both sides tend to discuss capitalism, but pay little attention to the role of capitalist, exercising a working assumption that the two terms are linguis tically interchangeable. Furthermore, "capitalism" does not appear on its own in BeU's index: its entry reads "capitalism, savage", which, apart from revealing his thesis, highlights a common tendency to take this logical confusion to its natural conclusion by anthropomorphizing the system as a whole. This paper wiU examine this linguistic confusion, with particular reference to theological writers, and discuss what effect it has on the debate, before offering a perspective on how precision in the lan guage employed wiU help to clarify the fundamental issues at stake. It wiU show how the rhetoric employed in the debate creates a false relationship between the protagonists, by setting individuals against a system, then by conferring upon this system anthropomorphic characteristics, thereby creating a chimera and robbing the debate of its ability to effect real change. It wiU then introduce some of the in sights that are revealed when this tendency toward obfuscation is avoided, showing how those involved in business ethics might, through the precision of language, transform a sterile and intractable debate into one with the potential to transform. Liberationists versus capitalism BeU's first sleight-of-hand above was to present the argument as one between liberationists and capital ism. This kind of David-and-Goliath positioning is rhetoricaUy attractive, and has the immediate effect Eve Poole lectures in leadership at Ashridge Business School, following earlier careers working for the Church Commis sioners and Deloitte Consulting.

This positioning of the system as protagonist also facili tates a degree of generalization that lends itself to cleaner argument, so the two devices combine to achieve a heady combination of rhetoric and clarity. This kind of syntax has been examined by Douglas Griffin, a proponent of the complexity sciences, and attributed to the emergence of classical "both.. .and" thinking, rooted in Kantian argument that humans are both subject to the laws of nature and free to set their own goals (Griffin, 2002, p. 4). He argues that this loose use of language has given rise to the common habit parodied in HoUywood court room dramas of locating ethical responsibiUty in both the system being attacked, for example a large corporation, and in the few individuals "leading" the system. The ultimate paradox for him is that the individuals critiquing the system are often simulta neously part of it, and are therefore actively if not self-consciously involved in its furtherance (Griffin, 2002, p. 3).3 While Griffin argues from a perspective that is radicaUy individuaUstic (capitaUsm for him is redefined in each daily interaction between capital ists), he does highlight the confusion that this use of language creates, aUowing individual responsibiUty to slip out of the door. System as enemy BeU is not alone is his use of "capitaUsm" as the focus for the debate. Tim Gorringe writing in the UK a few years before BeU in the US uses similar termi nology. As a comparison, his index has no entry for capitaliste, but his entry for capitalism tops the league table for number of page references, beaten only by his references to individuals such as Marx, Aristotle and Smith (Gorringe, 1994).5 In Germany, Ulrich Duchrow, writing in 1986, foUows suit. In arguing that the Churches should regard global capitalism as of the same order as Nazism and apartheid and adopt a status confessionis against it, he explicitly justifies his choice of the system as the enemy, on pragmatic if not philosophical grounds: "The view is also frequently expressed that if only the individuals could be converted, an industrialist, for example, then the structures would automaticaUy be changed as weU. This is beHed not only by the expe rienced fact that in spite of aU the undeniable efforts of individuals in recent times, the existing system of market relationships, which (as Weber insists, on principle and not out of personal malevolence) accepts no moral responsib?ity, has deepened the gulf between poor and rich, but also by the fact that, in the final analysis, none of the institutions engaged in the market process is ready to accept responsibility for something which affects countless human beings in the most devastating and painful way." (Duchrow, 1987, p. 156 f.)6 The invisible hand Nor are the critics alone in their use of this device. Indeed, this displacement of responsibiHty appears to be sanctioned by the reputed author of capitahsm himself, Adam Smith, in his rhetoric of the "invisible hand" (Smith, 1999b, p. 32). Further, the capitalist is discouraged from attempting to take any active responsibility for the common good, because it is only through the mysterious actions of the invisible hand, left free to its own devices, that its alchemy can work. The displacement of responsibility to wards the "system" is also reflected in the pro-cap itahst Bishop of Oxford's use of language about capitalism: "perhaps structural injustice is a better phrase than structural sin, in that sin implies personal accountability" (Harries, 1992, p. 172). TechnicaUy, this use of language puts capitahsm beyond moral reach, because systems are amoral constructs, while morals are a property of individuals. So BeU's use of "capitalism" as protagonist, by dint of the language used, necessarily creates not only a remote but an amoral enemy, and this is reinforced by the use of similar language on the opposite side of the debate. Anthropomorphisation BeU's second ruse was to anthropomorphize capi talism, with the epithet "savage". This in some ways contradicts his earHer displacement, in that it at tempts to bring capitahsm back into the human sphere to address the inconvenience caused by its having been placed out of moral reach by the technicalities of the language employed. Addition</page><page sequence="3">On the Use of Language in the Anti-Capitalist Debate 321 aUy, the projection of human attributes on to the system usefuUy enables direct comparisons with the humans ranged against it in the debate. However, this Hnguistic practice, in spite of its popular cur rency, fails to honour the fact that the use of pecu liarly human adjectives to describe the abstract is a necessarily barren pursuit, because the act of ascribing such characteristics cannot pygmalion them into being. This point was made from an unusual quarter foUowing a public appeal for virtue in public life made by the Roman Catholic and Anglican Archbishops of Melbourne in 1991. In reply, the Leader in The Australian newspaper said: "Capital ism, that diverse enterprise, was said to be stained with sin, but how could it repent, let alone attain paradise?" (Harries, 1992, p. 172). Personification and powerlessness Anthropomorphization does, however, make argu ments easier to characterize, as the verb would suggest. LinguisticaUy this leads to personification, and as such has an established and ubiquitous pedi gree. For example, Max Weber uses the concept of the "ideal type" to generalize reality and produce stereotypes to facilitate "pure" criticism (Gerth and Wright 1970, p. 59 f.). In this context, such practice also builds on the concept of homo oeconomicus used in classical economic theory, and so inherits a template coloured by a predominantly rationalist understanding of economics, and of economic man as a rational agent, which resonates with the amo rality wrought by BeU's initial displacement.10 However, the moral philosopher Mary Midgley argues that such personification actuaUy contributes towards the powerlessness that displacement creates: "A melodramatic tendency to personify physical forces and other scientific entities can represent them as de mons driving us, rather than humble general facts about the world, which is aU they have a right to be seen as. This produces fataHsm, which certainly is incompatible with a belief in free-w?l, since it teaches that we are helpless in the hands of these superhuman beings. ... Writers whose point is reaUy just to show us some general fact about the world are led on with astonishing ease, by way of saying that we cannot change this general fact, to treating it as if it were itself an agent manipulating human beings, and as if aU real human agency had been absorbed into it." (Midgley, 1997, p. 94 ? and p. 101) When elsewhere BeU caUs capitalism "naked", "the master", and talks about its "clutches", he is again foUowing a traditional precedent, with both sides of the debate standing accused of hiding behind this device (BeU, 2001, e.g., p. 11, p. 71 and p. 35, to take a sample at random). Duchrow (1987, p. 151) and Gorringe (1994, p. 164) both complain about capitalism's use of anthropomorphic stereotypes, with Gorringe asserting that: "the way the market is spoken of iUustrates this idolatry in a rather pathetic way. The market is endowed with personal qualities as were the attributes of God in post-exilic Judaism." Smith's "invisible hand" motif is perhaps the most famous example of this practice. Of course, the various instances cited here could simply be lexical flourishes, or merely examples that serve to indicate the limits of language, but they also iUustrate the common tendency towards anthropomorphization within this debate. Capitalism = capitalists Thus far, then, in his use of the language of "savage capitalism", BeU foUows his peers on both sides of the divide in estabUshing a debate focused on a system, but a system which bears human characteristics. This in linguistic terms leads on to an elision between the system and its adherents, so that capitalism = capi talists, in that the language of an anthropomorphic system necessarily resembles the language used in relation to people. For BeU, although the words are semanticaUy different, "liberationists" versus "capi talism" is therefore a fair match of like-with-like. The paradox But having observed the process by which this lan guage comes to be used, a paradox emerges which affects a crucial element of the debate, namely ethics. Using Griffin's nomenclature, capitalism is both moral and amoral. It is moral (or immoral) because it is personified, but, as was noted earlier, as a system it is also amoral by definition, since morals remain a property of persons not abstractions.</page><page sequence="4">322 Eve Poole This paradox tends to be concealed by the capi talism = capitalists equation, in that capitaUsts, being persons, can be moral (or immoral). However, this is now revealed to be a linguistic assumption, because the language actuaUy used, although it may be in tended to denote or include capital/sis, is actuaUy capital/sm. The assigning of moral responsibility to something that is by definition amoral appears to assume that those proponents of the system, who do have moral responsibility, wiU take on this respon sibility on behalf of the system, without being di rectly asked. It is this last fact that lends the debate its rhetorical air, and both sides of the argument are guilty of this practice. If the critic says, "capitalism is evil", and the capitalist ripostes with the "invisible hand" argument, both effectively keep the debate at the level of the abstract, and thus avoid any need for either party to take responsibility for the issues raised, rendering the whole debate at best academic. The necessary effect of stereotyping A further consequence of the capitalism debate is that, unlike a debate concerning specific capital/sis, the use of an abstract adversary, however weU dressed up in famiUar human garb, wiU go the way of aU use of stereotypes and fail to find a target. The economist Robert Lucas explains why: "'Capitalism' is, I think, best viewed as a loose descriptive term that allows great scope for differing roles of the State in economic affairs. I do not think this term defines a specific economic system, and it certainly does not define a complete social philoso phy." (Lucas, 1992, p. 72)13 Resulting problems The use of abstract and stereotypical language that cannot fix on a specific target is particularly prob lematic here. The fundamental point of the anti capitalist debate, whether in this or a secular context, is to use rhetoric to inspire action to change capital ism, variously by overthrowing it or, increasingly, transforming it from within. For liberation theolo gians such as Bell, this was their father Guti?rrez' caU to arms in 1971: "If theological reflection does not vitalize the action of the Christian community in the world by making its commitment to charity fidler and more radical... then this theological reflection wiU have been of Httle value." (Guti?rrez, 2001, p. 269)14 A further problem of the use of the imprecise and stereotypical language of "savage capitalism" is that, before any weapons are drawn, the use of the col lective disenfranchises the individual by marginaHz ing their role in the debate. Midgley, again, pinpoints this clash in the language between the corporate point of view and that of the individual: "Trouble only arises when [Marxist and other large scale conceptual schemes] are taken to compete with and annihilate the individual point of view ? to prove it unnecessary by demonstrating that everybody is only the pawn or product of their society. This looks like a causal argument, but it cannot reaUy be one. CausaUy, it would be just as true that the society was only the product of its past and present members. It is a manifesto, issued on behalf of corporate ways of thinking which are suitable for certain purposes, and designed to extend their empire over other purposes, eliminating aU rivals. This imperialism is sometimes seen as a matter of metaphysics, individuals being actuaUy "less real" than their communities." (Midgley, 1997, p. 52) In a debate that prides itself on speaking out for oppressed individuals, it is unfortunate if the way the language is used itself becomes a tool of oppression. Precision in the use of language So how might greater precision in the language employed help clarify the fundamental issues at stake? The discipline of using specific language immediately alters the focus of the debate. The substitution of "capitalist" for "capitalism" encour ages a focus on specific capitalists to avoid obvious and indefensible stereotypes. This would also help avoid the temptation prevalent in the debate to generalize the generalization, by turning "capital ism" into "global capitalism", which magnifies the problems of language already identified. Talk of specific capitalists attracts "active" language, and so inevitably leads to discussion of specific behaviours,</page><page sequence="5">On the Use of Language in the Anti-Capitalist Debate 323 or of decisions taken or not taken, which naturally brings the debate into the realm of action. For in stance, the exhortation "capitaHsm should change" necessarily remains just that, an exhortation. How ever, "the capitaHst should change" invites the question "which one, how, and why?" Insights Looking at the debate at the level of the individual rather than the system also offers some surprising in sights. The Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto has pointed out the sheer number of the kinds of individuals championed in this debate that have already quietly opted out of "capitaHsm" (of the kind assumed by BeU) and, as individual capitalists, are making their own "extralegal" or "grey market" arrangements. He says that "according to most esti mates, the extralegal sectors in the developing world account for 50?75% of aU working people and are responsible for one-fifth to more than two-thirds of the total economic output of the Third World" (de Soto, 2001, p. 87). A debate focused on the individual might ask questions about the differences between "grey" and other capitalists that might prove fruitful. Another issue that is thrown into reHef by a genuinely personalized debate is that of individual power. Recent economic thinking has recognized the importance of the individuals or "nodes" in a connected economy, with Joseph Stiglitz' work on asymmetries of information focusing attention on individual power and powerlessness, particularly in an Internet age (Stightz, 2002, p. xi).15 Again, a relentless focus on the system rather than the indi vidual misses this crucial debate. A third perspective is that provided by modern developments in Game Theory. A focus on the ac tions of individuals led to Robert Axelrod's ground breaking book The Evolution of Co-operation, which prompted a re-examination of the assumption underpinning the debate on capitalism that being "nice" doesn't pay. He estimates that, for a system to change into "something nicer", it only requires the concerted efforts of 5% of the system's population (Axelrod, 1990, p. 65).16 These are but three possible perspectives opened up by a re-focus of the debate from the abstract to the level of the individual. AU three, by their nature, have the virtue of being suggestive of action, and are therefore more likely to generate change. Conclusion This paper has examined the Unguistic confusion that characterises the anti-capitaUst debate. It has shown that, through a process of setting individuals against a system, then conferring on this system anthropo morphic personality, the critics create a chimera and rob the debate of its ability to effect real change. By using language precisely and focusing on the indi vidual rather than the system, a number of avenues are opened up for further exploration. Not only does this exercise show how those involved in this debate might, through precision of language, create more productive conversations, but also that, in the field of business ethics generaUy where emotions can run high, paying attention to semantics might serve to resurrect hitherto stale-mated ethical debates. Notes 1 BeU (2001, passim), e.g., in the Introduction alone there are 50 references to 'capitalism', with the use of the word 'capitalist' only appearing 18 times, always as an adjective, to describe, variously, the capitalist market (p. 1, 3), the capitalist order (p. 2, 4, 5, 7), the capitaUst discipline (p. 4, 7, 8), the capitalist captivity (p. 4, 5) and the capitalist subject/ivity (p. 8). The remaining three instances of the word 'capitalist' (p. 1; 7) are again adjectival and are both quotations from the same, pro-capitalist, source. Bell uses the term 'savage capitalism' in homage to the Uberationist Franz Hinkelammert (BeU, 2001, p. 3), but uses it interchangeably with mere 'capitalism'. A consequence of the concentration of blame on the system and its leaders is to reinforce the 'great man' theory of leadership, which encourages the passivity portrayed in his ultimate paradox. 4 The tendency of this language to displace personal responsibility has also been examined more generally by the theologian Graham Shaw, in the context of his arguments against the existence of a 'real' God. His view is that man has evolved a sophisticated set of arrange ments to avoid taking personal responsibility. This is seen in the clever use of class and hierarchy, ritual and distance, to create a line of authority that extends</page><page sequence="6">324 Eue Poole beyond man to 'God'. For example, if an Emperor or King is divinely ordained, they cannot be held to earthly account, so subjects can escalate responsibiHty up through the hierarchy until it effectively dissipates in the ether. His arguments would suggest that the inexactitude of language noted by Griffin is symptomatic of a pathological unwiUingness on the part of humans to take personal responsibiHty for their actions. Shaw (1987, pp. 164 ff). Gorringe's index references 12 pages on capitaHsm, dwarfing the other '-isms' such as Social Darwinism (4), UtiHtarianism (4), Nazism (3), Puritanism (3), sociaHsm (3), consumerism (2), feminism (2), protectionism (2), racism (2), Stoicism (2), unionism (2), agapaism (1), Deism (1), fundamentaHsm (1), individuaHsm (1), legaHsm (1), Manichaeanism (1), Marxism (1), Methodism (1), pantheism (1), pluraHsm (1), relativism (1) and totalitar ianism (1). Comparing this lengthy Hst of -isms, and noting that the only references exceeding those on capitaHsm are 27 for Marx, 21 for Aristotle, 16 apiece for Jesus and Paul, 15 for Adam Smith and 12 for Alasdair Maclntyre, Gorringe's index as a whole serves as a graphic iUustration of Griffin's thesis that ideological debates tend towards discussion of 'the system' at one end and 'great men' at the other, with little in between. This edition was translated from the original German by David Lewis, but the German Kapitalismus has the same meaning as its English equivalent capitalism (G -ismus = E. -ism). The invisible hand motif has been reprised more recently by the economist Friedrich von Hayek: "If individuals are aUowed to pursue their self-interest, if prices are aUowed to respond to changes in information and if players in the game have the assurance that there exists a rule of law which guarantees their contracts, the market economy left to itself wiU secure the best outcome for society as a whole." As summarized in Griffiths (1982, p. 34). However, it should be noted that Adam Smith's capitalism did assume a moral foundation, The Wealth of Nations (1776) being written after and to an extent bu?ding upon his Theory of Moral Sentiments (1761), see Hay (1989, pp. 158-60), and Skinner's Introduction to the Penguin edition of Smith (1999a). 8 See for example Swinburne (1997, pp. 231 ff.) for a succinct restatement of the classic argument that, because morals are a feature of free wiU and, unHke animals, free wiU of the kind that permits moral reasoning and thus moral responsibiHty, morals are therefore an exclusively human property. 9 See for instance the discussion held during the 1990 Vatican CoUoquium on economics, and especiaUy Lucas (1992, pp. 71-8). In particular, Neoclassical economics holds that its work is ethicaUy neutral, rejecting Smith's moral under pinning and the ethical Protestantism that Weber held to have served the capitaUst system so weU in its infancy. See Dow (1999, p. 127). Although, in the quote cited above, Duchrow himself complains that the system "accepts no moral responsibility", and so is himself guilty as charged. This fusion is paraUeled in recent attempts to afford organizational systems personal status, whether meta phoricaUy in the case of 'brand personality' or legaUy in the case of corporate manslaughter charges. This represents a stark example of where a metaphor ? describing an organization as thought it were a body or 'corporation' ? has taken on a Ufe of its own and become a reality. While it is hard to uncover a research base for it, there is an ancient tradition that the act of naming in some way confers nature. This would suggest that in this debate there is a danger in assigning negative traits to a personified system then applying them in general to adherents of that system, in that the act of naming an evil may in some way bring that evil into being. Whether or not naming can mean creating, name-caUing can have the opposite effect from that intended, strengthening opposition rather than margin ahzing it. Writing in 1704, Charles Davenant observed: "In aU ages, and aU places, hereticks and sectaries have rather been increased than diminished by persecution. It brings them to unite in a firmer band with one another; it makes them fortify themselves with industry and council, and purify their reUgious discipline, which is always popular". MeUtz and Winch (1978, quoted on p. 166). 13 Some of the varieties of capitaUsm currently operating have been outlined by Kay (2002) and in Hampden Turner and Trompenaars (1994). Guti?rrez himself appears to take more care in the debate, noting that it is not enough to focus on ideological confrontations. Admittedly, he helps himself by restricting his generaUties about oppression to the Latin American situation, rather than attempting a global condemnation of capitaUsm per se, unlike the majority of his foUowers. 15 An example of the radical transformation of the informational landscape is provided by the statistic cited by former US President BiU CUnton in a recent lecture at LSE, that when he became President in January 1993, there were only 50 sites on the World Wide Web. When he left office eight years later, there were 350 miUion.
