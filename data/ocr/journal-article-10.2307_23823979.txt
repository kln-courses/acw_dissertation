<plain_text><page sequence="1">"What Manner of Man Is He?": Humor and Masculine Identity in Captain Marvel's World War II Adventures Brian Cremins When I think of the enormous thundering herd of kids who grew up on com ics and are today just coming into positions of importance in our society, a process that can only go up in magnitudes as each year throws in another million or two, I sense that comics—for good or bad—may actually have a great impact on the cultural/philosophical/whatnot directions America takes through the rest of this century. —Otto Binder in a letter to Jerry Bails, 18 October 1964 (qtd. in Schelly 168) The ghost of Captain Marvel has long haunted comic books and popular culture. The character has never really disappeared entirely—both Marvel and DC Comics continue to publish variations on the hero, if for no other reason than to retain their respective copyrights—but the Captain Marvel created by Bill Parker and C. C. Beck, like other popular cartoon characters of the 1930s and 1940s, remains largely a figure of nostalgia for contemporary readers of a certain age who remember him.1 Chip Kidd and Geoff Spear's 2010 photographic history of Captain Marvel, Shazam! The Golden Age of the World's Mightiest Mortal, ends with an enlarged image of a distressed-looking, blond-haired boy staring at silhouettes of Captain Marvel, Captain Marvel, Jr., and Mary Marvel and crying out, "Holy Moley! What happened to the Marvel family?" These characters, among the most popular of the Golden Age of American comic books, generated interest in many of the early, non-academic studies of se quential art, including Dick Lupoff's "The Big Red Cheese" in the anthol ogy All in Color for a Dime (1970) and artist Jim Steranko's The Steranko History of Comics (Volume 2,1972). The character also provided the source material for Mick Anglo's Marvelman, which in turn formed the basis of Alan Moore's Miracleman series.2 While recent comics scholars including Bradford W. Wright, Mark Best, and Christopher Murray have provided thought-provoking insights into the character, the Captain Marvel stories of the 1940s and early 1950s represent a largely unexamined resource for crit ics and historians fascinated with American popular culture during World War II and its immediate aftermath. In what way did the genial Captain Marvel—the super-powered adult who appears when his alter ego Billy 33</page><page sequence="2">34 Batson says the magic word, "Shazam!"—embody concepts of masculinity in the United States during World War II? If Billy's magic word transforms him into a man, what sort of man is he? As a critical reading of one of the hero's World War II adventures will show, Captain Marvel is more innocent and often less cunning than Billy Batson. His power, then, lies not in his ability to engage with the adult world but to neutralize it through laughter, parody, and slapstick. The trans formation of Billy Batson into the "World's Mightiest Mortal" is actually a reversal: as the Captain, he is more pure and childlike than his alter ego. As a result, Captain Marvel represented an ideal of American innocence that had enormous appeal for readers coping with the anxiety and uncertainty in the United States at the beginning of World War II. After an overview of the character and his history, which will provide the necessary context for readers unfamiliar with his mythology, this essay will examine one of the many stories in which Captain Marvel did his part in fighting the Axis powers. "Capt. Marvel and the Mark of the Black Swastika" from Captain Marvel Adventures #20 (dated January 22, 1943), is an adventure in which the hero battles Nazi pilots, incendiary bombs, Adolf Hitler, Joseph Goeb bels, Hermann Goring, and Satan himself. In early histories of American comic books, texts often derived from the fanzines of the 1960s, Captain Marvel plays a prominent role. His sig nificance in the work of Lupoff, Steranko, Jules Feiffer, and Roy Thomas reflects the character's enormous popularity in the 1940s and early 1950s. As Bradford W. Wright points out in Comic Book Nation, Captain Marvel was one of the most popular characters of the era along with Superman, Batman, Captain America, and Wonder Woman, who are more familiar to contemporary audiences. Created by Bill Parker and artist C. C. Beck for Whiz Comics #2 (February 1940), Captain Marvel "became the best-selling character of the early 1940s, outdoing even Superman for a time" (Wright 18).3 While "Captain Marvel was every bit the mythic hero that Superman was," according to Christopher Murray, the character also possessed "some thing that tilted the balance in his favor: Beck's simple, appealing artwork and the sense of fun and adventure that writers Bill Parker and, later, Otto Binder brought to the stories" (Murray 26-28). The hero generated a num ber of popular spin-off characters who became part of the Marvel Family, including his sister Mary Marvel, his biggest fan Freddy Freeman (better known as Captain Marvel, Jr.), the talking tiger Mr. Tawky Tawny, and even the super-powered anthropomorphic hero Hoppy the Marvel Bunny. Captain Marvel, unlike Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's creation Su perman, had his origins in a corporate directive from Fawcett Publications'</page><page sequence="3">35 Board of Directors. In 1939, after witnessing the success of Superman and Batman, Fawcett, the publisher of popular magazines including Mechanix Illustrated, "decided to institute a line of comics for the company"; Ralph Daigh, the company's executive director, gave the assignment to Bill Park er, "a bright, young staffer who was a supervising editor on Fawcett's movie magazines" (Steranko 11). When Parker began his tenure as the company's comic book editor in the fall of 1939, he came up with a rough idea for six individual heroes, each of whom would possess different characteristic powers "with which to balance the scales of justice. One was to have great strength; another to have courage; the next, speed; the others, stamina, wis dom, power" (Steranko 11). Daigh suggested Parker focus his attention on a single character, so Parker revised this concept and created a hero origi nally called Captain Thunder (see Steranko 11 and Hamerlinck 69). In the newly revised formula, the orphaned newsboy Billy Batson meets the ancient wizard Shazam, who grants the boy the wisdom of Solo mon, the strength of Hercules, the stamina of Atlas, the power of Zeus, the courage of Achilles, and the speed of Mercury. When Billy speaks the magic word, he is transformed by a bolt of lightning into Captain Marvel, who will serve as the old wizard's successor and become "the strongest and mightiest man in the world," a being charged with the "sacred duty to defend the poor and helpless, right wrongs and crush evil everywhere" (Parker and Beck 12). Science fiction writer Otto Binder would take over as Captain Mar vel's head writer in 1941, going on to write 986 stories featuring the char acter (see Steranko 12). C. C. Beck would be associated with the character for the next four decades, even returning in the 1970s to illustrate a short lived revival of the hero published by DC Comics. Steranko points out that Binder's influence on the character, coupled with Beck's clean, uncluttered, and deceptively simple artwork (even the members of his studio, Steranko explains, adopted Beck's unique and instantly recognizable style), produced a character whose appearance and behavior proved to be a stark but success ful contrast to the comic books published by Fawcett's main competitors, National (Detective Comics) and Timely (which would eventually evolve into Marvel Comics): "[Binder's] once-upon-a-timers might be viewed in retrospect as folksy, low-key adventures as contrasted to Timely's pervasive climate of fear and National's focus on ultimate power" (Steranko 15).4 Beck, like Binder, was a Midwesterner. Born in Minnesota, the art ist studied at The Chicago Academy and at the University of Minnesota. Binder, who began his writing career in pulp science fiction magazines, was born in Bessemer, Michigan, in 1911 (Steranko 11 and 13; see also Barrier and Williams 79). As he admitted to Steranko, Beck had little use for the</page><page sequence="4">36 early comic book art of the late 1930s: "I never read comic books because most of them were tasteless. I considered my magazines to be illustrated boy's adventures and handled the art accordingly" (qtd. in Steranko 11). The simplicity of Beck's art was a large part of Captain Marvel's appeal, ac cording to Jules Feiffer, who describes Beck's depiction of Billy Batson "as an oval-faced, dot-eyed, squiggly-haired boy familiar to any child who sent away for a how-to-draw-heads course. The magic for readers in Captain Marvel was that not only did it appear easy for readers to become him, it looked easy to draw him. Deceptively so" (Feiffer 21). What Feiffer refers to as the "virginal simplicity" of the art found its match in Binder's scripts, which emphasized the same humanistic values of, for example, Binder's early collaborations with his older brother Earl. They had begun publish ing stories under the pseudonym Eando ("E" and "O") Binder in 1930 with "The First Martian" in Amazing Stories (Steranko 13). Binder's recollections of his experiences writing Captain Marvel provide readers with significant historical details on the early years of com ic book production in the United States, the "Golden Age" discussed by fans and critics alike. Binder described writing comics as a kind of addiction: "Comics were like a drug, or a hypnotic spell, to me" (Steranko 14). Binder also emphasized the distinction between Captain Marvel and Superman: The Big Red Cheese was human to the core, whereas, in my opinion most of the other super-characters, from Mr. Big (blue suit) down, were alien, almost austere, infallible, haughty—doing a machine-like job of nabbing crooks and crushing evil, without once taking off a moment to lounge around and relax, (qtd. in Steranko 14)5 Superman ("Mr. Big"), like Batman, exists in an urban landscape, a world of organized crime, labor unrest, social decay, and disintegration. While Captain Marvel's debut in Whiz Comics #2 featured a shadowy, ominous cityscape as its setting, Binder introduced a lighter sensibility to the stories, one which served to transport the character from the desolate urban spaces of his origin to the suburban world of postwar America in the late 1940s (see Barrier and Williams 79). Although it is unclear if Binder scripted "Capt. Marvel and the Mark of the Black Swastika," he was responsible for other pieces in the same issue, and his humanistic, satirical sensibility underlies the mocking parodies of Hitler, Goebbels, and Goring that open and close the story.6</page><page sequence="5">37 Both Beck and Binder saw Billy Batson as the true hero of the se ries. According to Beck, "Captain Marvel would have been merely another overdrawn, one-dimensional figure in a ridiculous costume" without his al ter ego (qtd. in Hamerlinck 70). For Otto Binder, the Captain Marvel stories gave him the opportunity to write gentle satire (sometimes biting) and also develop a most unique personality—a sort of kind, bumbling, hulking crusader without armor, using his super-powers sparingly (one of the secrets of his success) and subject to all the whims and dreams and human fallacies which are part of all of us. I'd hate to add up how many times Billy saved him with his wits. (qtd. in Steranko 14) Despite significant differences between Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's Su perman and Parker and Beck's hero, Captain Marvel and his allies in 1953 finally fell victim to a copyright infringement lawsuit first undertaken by Detective Comics, Inc. (National Comics Publications) in the early 1940s.7 However, as Wright argues, Captain Marvel and Superman, aside from superficial similarities in appearance and superpowers, embody different myths of masculinity and heroism: "Whereas Superman evinced self-as suredness and control, Captain Marvel seemed more like a bumbling over grown child, and his adventures had a distinctly whimsical quality about them" (Wright 19). These differences are also significant when considering the cultural impact of Siegel and Shuster's Superman, which has inspired numerous and often complex readings by critics ranging from Umberto Eco to Michael Kimmel. Kimmel, for example, includes a brief analysis of Superman, Clark Kent, and Lois Lane in his influential study Manhood in America. In order to, as Kimmel describes his process, "map the meanings of manhood over the past two centuries," he draws on a variety of sources in cluding "novels and popular fiction in magazines and comic books, film and television," particularly texts produced "in moments of crisis when mascu linity was seen as threatened and people worked hard to try and salvage, revitalize, and resurrect it" (10). Scholar Tomas Glover Pollard elaborates on Kimmel's archaeology of masculinity in his study of the relationship be tween gender and humor in the World War II novels of Joseph Heller, Kurt Vonnegut, and Thomas Pynchon. As Pollard argues in his dissertation, Humor can offer a mode for presenting a critical</page><page sequence="6">38 response to dominant versions of masculinity. Within male-dominated societies structured by discourses of rationality, law, and objectivity, some writers finding cracks in the cultural foundations of gender may use humor in their writing as a response to the rifts between social claims and social practices, between cultural constructions of the "natural origins" of genders and the polymorphous experiences of them, between the conventional, observable genders and the other imaginable or less visible ones. (4) While addressing Kimmel's definition of the "Self-Made Man" as the dom inant role performed by American men from colonial times to the close of the twentieth century—a figure "who compulsively seeks to acquire the things to prove his manhood such as wealth, physical strength, trophies, and coveted places in the workplace and all-male preserves" (Pollard 3-4)— Pollard argues that humor and comedy provided writers like Heller and Vonnegut with strategies to examine the "conflict over the precise nature of masculinity" as it manifested itself in "multiple versions [of masculinity] circulating in a culture, indeed, in each performer of masculinity. Different types of masculinity evoke, encourage, and applaud other performances" (4). What results, according to Pollard, is "a 'dominant' version of mas culinity in popular culture that gains most of the attention and respect and 'alternative' versions that respond to or ignore the dominant version and thrive alongside it, much as comic inversions are humorously juxtaposed to a 'dominant' perspective" (4). Pollard's discussion of the ways in which humor provides a means of intervening in these definitions is critical in understanding the role Cap tain Marvel played in the rhetoric of masculinity during the early days of America's entry into World War II. If Kimmel's analysis of Superman pro vides us with a "dominant" masculinity, Pollard's arguments on "alterna tive" discourses of manliness offer a means of understanding why Binder viewed Billy Batson as the true hero of Captain Marvel's adventures. While Superman is the alien outsider who possesses secret powers and is the heir to an ancient, doomed race of advanced beings, Captain Marvel is a being whose true power lies in his innocence and purity. Although, as Kimmel admits, Superman's transformation into his alter ego Clark Kent "was actually the [Charles] Atlas program in reverse— a superhuman extraterrestrial who transforms himself into a wimpy bespec tacled newspaper reporter in order to fit unnoticed into the emasculating</page><page sequence="7">39 metropolis," the character also "gave a promise to every other obsequious office worker: Behind those glasses and that mild-mannered demeanor beat the heart of the hero" (Kimmel 212). Kimmel adds a discussion of Clark Kent's often complex relationship with Lois Lane: "As Clark constantly pursued Lois Lane, seeking the comforts of marital stability, Lois had eyes only for his more manly alter ego, who could not, and would never be, tied down into a life of domestic drudgery." He concludes this discussion of Superman by drawing parallels to Natty Bumppo and Huck Finn who, like Superman, were "also born to run—or rather, fly" (212). The story of Billy Batson and Captain Marvel, however, reverses this familiar trajectory. Although over the course of his career Captain Mar vel had many adventures in which he dismissed the advances of his female fans, notably those of Beautia, the daughter of Dr. Sivana, his arch-nemesis, he was also the patriarch of the Marvel Family which, as Mark Best points out, provided a model for the Superman and Batman "families" which be came popular in the 1950s and 1960s (complete with superdogs like Krypto and powerful felines like Streaky the Supercat).8 As Christopher Murray argues in Champions of the Oppressed, "Belief in the self-made man, the hero as underdog who overcomes seemingly unassailable obstacles, was reflected in most superheroes, who were frequently orphans" (11). Billy Batson, however, is not a Self-Made Man. Batson embraces the paternal affection and guidance of the wizard Shazam and thrives within the confines of the super-powered Marvel Fam ily. As a consequence of his trust in and dependence on the other members of his "family," Captain Marvel came to embody an iconic figure in the American popular media of World War II. As Michael C. C. Adams writes in The Best War Ever, the reality of combat, "it was thought, would not be good for morale and the war effort. Ads showed the troops as happy war riors, boyish and eager to be at the front, like a scout troop at camp" (91). Read in this context, Captain Marvel's version of masculinity is quite dif ferent from Superman's: while Superman is, as Murray suggests, the "un derdog who overcomes seemingly unassailable obstacles" (11), the Captain is the all-powerful adult who retains the simplicity, humor, and goodness of the ideal American boy. This myth of the American soldier as a figure who, as Adams de scribes, "gave candy bars to enemy kids, did not shoot prisoners, and tried not to harm civilians," had dangerous consequences for returning GIs. In Up Front, his 1945 collection of Willie and Joe cartoons, Bill Mauldin out lines the effect of these myths on soldiers, especially veterans about return ing to a culture changed radically by the war. Mauldin describes the fears</page><page sequence="8">40 and doubts he encountered when his cartoons of infantry soldiers began appearing in American newspapers: One of the foremost objections to a steady portrayal of the troubles and lives of combat infantrymen and those who work with them—medical aid men, combat engineers, artillery observers, and others—has been that these guys are going to feel that the nation owes them a living, and that they will become "social problems." This feeling has been so strong in some places that veteran combat men are looked at askance by worried and peaceable citizens. That's a sad thing for a guy sent off to war with a blare of patriotic music, and it's really not necessary. (8) This description of the fear and uncertainty concerning the condition of soldiers returning from service in World War II might prove surprising for contemporary readers raised on depictions of the "Greatest Generation," a part of the national narrative whose mythology has grown even stronger in the last two decades with the popularity of films like Saving Private Ryan and histories such as Tom Brokaw's books and TV documentaries (Wood 76),9 Mauldin makes a plea for these returning soldiers, one which leads several pages later to a discussion of the new sense of humor born as a result of the horrors of combat. While, Mauldin argues, the infantry soldier "is fundamentally no different from his countryman at home," he also admits that "now he has changed. His sense of humor has changed." While the returning soldier "can grin at gruesome jokes, like seeing a German get shot in the seat of his pants," a GI who has experienced combat "will stare un comprehendingly at fragile jokes in print which would have made him rock with laughter before" (33-34). The Captain Marvel stories are, in a sense, a series of fragile jokes. Dick Lupoff, Jim Steranko, Larry Ivie, John G. Pierce, and Martin Wil liams all refer to or describe what Mark Best calls the "humor and gentle parody" central to the mythology of Captain Marvel (Best 89). The goal for the returning soldier, as Mauldin points out, is to learn once again to enjoy this form of humor, to remember what is it to laugh out loud at jokes free of violence and irony: Perhaps he will change back again when he returns, but never completely. If he is lucky, his memories of</page><page sequence="9">41 those sharp, bitter days will fade over the years into a hazy recollection of a period which was filled with homesickness and horror and dread and monotony, occasionally lifted and lighted by the gentle, the humorous, and sometimes downright funny things that always go along with misery. (34) Captain Marvel offered readers humor as a means of problem solving. The Allied victory in the war, at least in the world of Captain Marvel, was inevi table, not because the Captain was more powerful than villains like Captain Nazi (see Ivie 26), or because he was smarter (though Billy Batson might have been), but because he had a uniquely American sense of humor.10 Christopher Murray, in his wide-ranging study of American comic book heroes and propaganda during World War II, argues that characters like Superman and Captain Marvel provided readers with the opportunity to "imagine themselves fighting the enemy, joining their fathers or brothers on the battlefield" (155).11 According to Murray, the character's popularity in the 1940s can be attributed to "the central fantasy that the hero, Captain Marvel, was in fact a young boy" whose magic word changed him from a lowly newsboy into "an adult superhero" (28). The magic word "Shazam!" did not grant Billy Batson unlimited power, however, as Steranko has sug gested (15). Rather, Billy Batson's transformation represents the possibility of innocence and the desire for a return home. This mixture of humor and despair, as John G. Pierce has pointed out, would have been familiar to reg ular readers of Captain Marvel Adventures, a series which often included a variety of stories which emphasized different aspects of the character (see Pierce, The Fawcett Companion 38). While Captain Marvel Adventures #20 opens with the rather ominous "Capt. Marvel and the Mark of the Black Swastika," it concludes several pages later with a story depicting a bizarre encounter between the hero and Attila the Hun.12 The first page of the comic, in addition to a brief summary of Cap tain Marvel's origin as well as a list of the stories in the issue, includes a text box that names the "Editorial Advisory Board of Captain Marvel Adven tures" (see Fig. 1). The Board includes Eleanor B. Roosevelt, "Past Presi dent, Girl Scouts Council of Greater New York"; Richard E. Byrd, "Noted Explorer, Aviator, and Author"; Dr. Allan Roy Dafoe, "The famous Quintu plet doctor"; and the Reverend John W. Tynan, a member of the "Fordham University Faculty." Fawcett's president, W. H. Fawcett, Jr., assures read ers that these advisors have helped the publisher "maintain high standards of wholesome entertainment" (3). The list of advisors draws on the social</page><page sequence="10">42 and moral authority of the medical profession, academia, and the clergy. This authorization echoes the "Code of Ethics" which governed Fawcett publications. Chip Kidd includes a copy of these "writing guidelines" in his recent Shazam! book. These 1942 rules, which have remarkable similarities to elements of the Comics Code which the industry instituted as a form of self-censorship in the 1950s,13 include injunctions against "scenes of actual sadistic torture"; "vulgar language"; "a humorous or glamorous treatment" of divorce; and "dialects and devices" used "to indicate ridicule or intoler ance of racial groups" (although, as Kidd points out, this last stipulation did not prevent the stereotypical "Negro" character Steamboat from appearing in the comics until finally being removed in 1945). The first in these guide lines is a rule against any depiction of a challenge against the existing power structure: Policemen, judges, officials, and respected institutions must not be portrayed as stupid or ineffective in such a way as to weaken respect for established authority. Crimes against the law shall never be presented in such as way as to throw sympathy with the crime as against law and justice or to inspire others with the desire for imitation.14 Captain Marvel is designed as a force for good; that goodness, in fact, blinds him to the being who, in the opening pages of Captain Marvel Adventures #20, grants Hitler his evil powers for the first time.</page><page sequence="11">43 tm tm mmm ; CAPTAIN MARVEL ADVENTURES #, - MANOR ».

London is under attack from Nazi airpower and Captain Marvel arrives to aid the British forces. The opening pages of the story feature a dramatic image of Captain Marvel flying over a burning city: in the distance, an image of Big Ben is framed by spotlights, explosions, and anti-aircraft fire (see Fig. 2). On the devastated street below, small figures struggle to douse the flames as a crew of ambulance workers point to the familiar red-costumed hero: "Wot's that flyin' up there, a man?" one shouts. Another, pointing to the incoming Nazi bomb, replies, "Duck, 'arry! That bomb's gonna hit 'im!" The last figure, standing over a wounded civilian lying on a stretcher, reminds his fellows that they have no need to fear, as the "flyin"' man has arrived to rescue them: "Don't worry. That's Captain Marvel!" Captain Marvel's presence in the foreground of the image high lights the hellish landscape arrayed before him. The artists and letterers have arranged the title of the story in such a way that the eye is forced to scan the accumulated horror of the flames, the demolished buildings, and the falling bombs. First, to the left-hand side of the spread, "Capt. Marvel" appears in bold letters; then, in the lower right-hand corner at the top of page 5, the words "and the Mark of the Black Swastika" complete the title (pages 4-5). Above this yellow text box there appears a solitary, cloaked figure on the roof of the only building still standing. His silhouette is indis tinct, but his clawed hands and horned head suggest that supernatural forces are at work.</page><page sequence="13">45 CATOHN MMVS mm / flCWT, [iMirv &lt; ■ &gt; j Fig. 2: Captain Marvel arrives in London to fight the forces of evil on pages 4 and 5 of Captain Marvel Adventures #20.

Having now transformed back into his identity as the "famous boy radio reporter," Batson broadcasts from the scene just as London experiences "one of the worst bombings" of the war (6). When he sees the figure on the roof of what appears to be a cathedral, Billy says, "There seems to be someone on the roof of that one building that remains unhit! That's funny!" (6). Always more suspicious than Captain Marvel, as Otto Binder indicated in his discussion with Jim Steranko (14), Billy inves</page><page sequence="17">49 tigates, but quickly utters his magic word when he sees the figure "hit by an incendiary bomb!" (7). Captain Marvel's first goal is to rescue the man "or he'll be burnt to a crisp!" After Captain Marvel disables the bomb, the Devil, surprised, speculates, "Fancy that! A mortal who can play with fire! You must be— one of us!" (8). In the next panel, Captain Marvel demands, "Who are you? And what are you doing here?" (see Fig. 4). In his innocence and his zeal to rescue London, the hero does not recognize the Devil, who replies, "Well, let's just say that I'm ... er ... director of the underground heating system!" (8).

Captain Marvel © 2013 DC Comics Billy soon discovers the basement of the Devil's beloved building is in fact a sanctuary for German pilots whose aircraft have been shot down by British forces. "So this is where all the Nazi pilots disappear to, after they are shot down over England!" he thinks as he watches a room full of soldiers (11). A few pages later, the Nazis capture Billy, but find themselves fighting Captain Marvel who, as he clobbers one of the pilots, exclaims, "I wish you could take that back to Berlin with you, and give it to your Fuehrer with my regards!" (13). Just as Captain Marvel is about to destroy the Nazis' radio equipment, however, the Devil returns and requests the hero's presence "across the channel" in "occupied France" (15) (see Fig. 6). There, Captain Marvel finds Flitler arguing with his subordinates in a scene that echoes the childish squabbling on page 5. Captain Marvel returns to England, where he asks a British crew if he might "borrow" a bomb (16). He flies back across the channel and drops the bomb on the Devil and his Nazi "apostles" (14). Although Hitler and his henchmen disappear—"They cannot die!" he tells the Captain because "[t]hey belong to me, and cannot be killed until I order it!" (17) —the Devil remains buried under a pile of burning rubble. Three French children, one</page><page sequence="19">51 of them in an obligatory striped shirt, offer their help. The Devil rejects their offers and backs away from them as they douse him with water: "No! No! Don't be good to me—I can't stand it!" He shrinks until he disappears with a "poof!" and Captain Marvel explains to the children, who appear as puzzled as he did earlier in the story, "You children killed him with kind ness!" (18). Captain Marvel flies away but promises to visit again "after the war" (19).</page><page sequence="20">52 Fig. 6: The Devil's "apostles" argue over control of Europe on page 15. Captain Marvel copyright © 2013 DC Comics In the story's closing panel, Hitler orders that no one must know that he and the others "haff been vounded" (19). Joseph Goebbels, the little boy</page><page sequence="21">53 who wished to one day be "der biggest liar in der vorld," admits to Hitler that, although he has tried to convince the German people that the Fuehrer is "resting at Berchtesgaden," "dey don't belief my lies anymore!" Hermann Goring, who wished "to be der richest man in der world," comments, "You must be slipping, Joseph!" Billy Batson, of course, has the last word of the story. He appears in a circle within the larger rectangular panel in which we see Adolph, Joseph, and Hermann. Standing once again before the micro phone at WHIZ, Billy assures readers, Folks, they're all slipping, now that their evil master has gone back to where he came from! For it was from that very day that the Axis began to lose the war! It's only a matter of time, and a good push from us will soon put an end to the whole evil business! (19) Following this pronouncement are ads for the next issue of Captain Marvel Adventures and for Spy Smasher Comics, featuring another of Fawcett's popular wartime heroes. As they wait for the next installment of Captain Marvel's adventures, readers might support the war effort through the pur chase of war bonds and stamps, which are advertised with an illustration of the hero on the first page of the comic: "Don't forget! Buy war bonds and stamps," reads the ad, which features an image of the Captain, his back straight and his chin forward, saluting his readers (3). As this brief summary of the story suggests, all of the characters are ridiculous. The hero cannot name the villain, a failure that gives readers the opportunity to identify the source of this evil for themselves. So, the Devil himself is behind this! Of course. There can be no other explanation. Captain Marvel, however, like the French children at the end of the story, is too innocent to recognize pure evil. When he does confront this being, he asks, "Who—who are you, anyway?" (15).15 The panoramic view of the destruction of London tells a different story, however: it is a vision of hell, complete with falling bombs, burned buildings, and clouds of toxic orange smoke and flame. The presence of Captain Marvel and the Devil in the story's opening sequence adds a strange touch to an already disturbing image (see Fig. 2). As Scott McCloud argues in Understanding Comics, "iconic" characters are drawn in an almost abstract style—that is, rendered in a simple, more ste reotypically "cartoon" fashion than, for example, realistically drawn com ics such as Alex Raymond's Flash Gordon or Mac Raboy's lush work on Captain Marvel, Jr. in Master Comics (see Chapter Two of McCloud, espe</page><page sequence="22">54 cially pages 46-50). When an iconic character like Captain Marvel inhabits "unusually realistic backgrounds," this "combination" provides readers the opportunity to "mask themselves in a character and safely enter a sensually stimulating world" (McCloud 42-43). In this case, Captain Marvel arrives in London not only to protect these soldiers, but also to usher readers into this world of combat. The horrors of the war have been transformed into cartoon images, and therefore have been mastered, just as the Nazi lead ers have been reduced to absurdity in these caricatures. Captain Marvel's presence is also a dreamlike inversion of these terrors and anxieties. The "mask" the story offers the reader is one of ease and control. Billy Batson is a boy who sheds adult fears, anxieties, and vanity when he becomes Captain Marvel. Meanwhile, these Nazi leaders, the story suggests, were never chil dren. Even as boys the villains dreamed of violence and domination. They existed in a world void of the "kindness" which exiles the Devil at the close of the story (18). To return to McCloud's argument, a "cartoony" figure with a "realistic" background results in a complex reading experience: "One set of lines to see. Another set of lines to be" (43).16 The drawings on pages 4 and 5 of a burning London provide the "set of lines to see": the burning buildings are markers of the horrific consequences of the actions of evil men. The figure of Captain Marvel, however, offers a different "set of lines to be": a rejection of lies, physical violence, and the pursuit of material wealth, those desires and fantasies best left to the corrupt adult world. The defeat of the Axis, the story suggests, is inevitable anyway. The Nazis would rather fight amongst themselves and serve their evil master than pursue a path to victory. As they argue in the middle of the story, Hitler shouts, "Am I not the boss—der Fuehrer? Does not efferyt'ing belong to me? Haff I not told you so a million times?" Joseph replies, "Yah-h! Ve know, Adolph! Ve let you think so, because you are der biggest stuffed shirt of us all!" (15) (see the last two panels of Fig. 6). Not only are the Nazis narcissistic fools, but they are also, as Goebbels suggests, stuffy. Even the Devil in the story has a witty sense of humor which his "apostles" lack (pages 15-16). Captain Marvel embodies an ideal of American innocence that satis fied the desires of his many readers in the 1940s, especially during the war. He has never regained the popularity he enjoyed in those years. While in the last decade Hollywood has produced a series of financial and some times critically successful Hollywood films, including Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and Joss Whedon's big-screen reinvention of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's superhero team The Avengers, it has yet to produce a Captain</page><page sequence="23">55 Marvel movie, and it is unlikely that the character, at least as imagined by Otto Binder and C. C. Beck and their assistants, will feature as the hero of a blockbuster franchise. Most recent Hollywood adaptations of popular su perhero characters attempt to reinvent superheroes for an adult audience— that is, for an audience with an established familiarity with and nostalgia for these existing properties. The essence of the Captain Marvel myth—the boy who turns into a man who is in fact more boyish and innocent than the child himself—is a remnant of an era in which, as Michael C. C. Adams reminds us, those "GIs who had not been in combat looked and acted very young." These young soldiers, Adams argues, "seemed immature because they had not grown up amid war and because their parents had worked to prolong in them the sheltered innocence that Americans feel is part of their national dream" (91).17 Attributing Captain Marvel's popularity during World War II to this illusion of innocence, however, would be too easy, and perhaps misleading. The hero's adventures, despite their frequent absurdity, reveal the workings of this dream, which is not Batman's fantasy of revenge or Superman's vision of escape. When Superman's planet explodes and his rocket ship finds its way to earth, the child discovers a new world which promises fame and opportunity. When Billy Batson discovers the under ground subway tunnel, he is not made whole, or newly powerful; instead, he is rewarded for his persistence and for his humility. He becomes Captain Marvel because he has embraced what and who he is, and this discovery of his secret self finds its reward in the promise of the infinite possibilities of childhood play. Notes 1 As Richard A. Lupoff points out in his introduction to Bill Schelly's 2003 biography of Captain Marvel writer Otto Binder, "Cap and his family still hover around the edges of the comics publishing industry, making ghostly guest appearances in various DC periodicals, and a feature film is rumored to be in production, but I doubt that we will ever again see anything to match those grand adventures scripted by Otto Binder and drawn by C. C. Beck" (Schelly 9). Schelly's book provides a vital portrait of Otto Bind er's influence on the worlds of twentieth-century science fiction and comic books and offers readers significant details on the creation and development of Captain Marvel; see especially chapters 7 and 8 ("Seduced into Comics" and "Lightning Strikes!").</page><page sequence="24">56 2 For more information on Alan Moore's Miracleman, and how Moore developed the character based on Mick Anglo's original version of Mar velman from the 1950s, see George Khoury, Kimota! The Miracleman Companion (TwoMorrows Publishing, 2001). Moore also explains his fas cination with Marvelman, the British version of Captain Marvel, in the es say "M*****Man: Full Story and Pics" in Miracleman #2 (Eclipse Comics, October 1985). 3 As Bill Schelly points out, the character "would go on to surpass" Super man in terms of sales, "reaching a peak circulation of 1,300,000 in his self titled comic book" in 1946 (see Schelly 87). Captain Marvel also had "a vast audience" of "millions of children and teenagers, as well as large num bers of servicemen who were within reach of a PX" (Schelly 87). Reprints of the early Captain Marvel stories are available in DC Comics' Shazam Archives as well as in Shazam! The Greatest Stories Ever Told, which in cludes Parker and Beck's origin story from Whiz Comics #2. Although there are multiple histories of the character available to readers, the most comprehensive remains the first chapter in the second volume of Jim Ster anko's The Steranko History of Comics. As Steranko's history can be dif ficult to find, more easily accessible histories of the character are included in Lupoff and Thompson's All in Color for a Dime; Wright's Comic Book Nation; Gabilliet's Of Comics and Men: A Cultural History of American Comic Books', Christopher Murray's Champions of the Oppressed', and in Barrier and Williams' The Smithsonian Book of Comic-Book Comics. Roy Thomas's Alter Ego devotes a section to P. C. Hamerlinck's Fawcett Col lectors of America in each issue and often includes essays and interviews with the writers and artists who worked on the character during the 1940s and 1950s. Alter Ego: The Best of the Legendary Comics Fanzine, ed ited by Thomas and Bill Schelly, also includes several 1960s-era articles on Captain Marvel, including letters and reminiscences from Binder himself. See, for example, Thomas's "One Man's Family: The Saga of the Mighty Marvels," pages 102-109. 4 Chip Kidd emphasizes Captain Marvel's "charm" when he describes his childhood memories of the character: "At age eight, when I first saw him, I was a bit thrown by Captain Marvel. That was in 1973, when DC reintro duced him to the comics-buying public after a twenty-year hiatus. As an already diehard fan of Batman, Superman, and the DC gang, I thought this guy seemed a bit, well . . . happy. And red. Not that there was anything</page><page sequence="25">57 wrong with that, but it was different from what I was used to." Kidd then reminds readers of the key differences between Captain Marvel and char acters like Batman and Superman: "Batman was Menace. Superman was Power. Captain Marvel was ... Charm." 5 Captain Marvel's nickname, like his magic word "Shazam!" and his fa vorite exclamation "Holy moley !", remains one of the strip's most enduring contributions to the American vernacular. As Binder explained to Steranko, much like the Captain's arch-nemesis Dr. Sivana, "Beck and I always called him the 'Big Red Cheese,' not in disrespect, but as a friend ... and because sneaky little Sivana used it too" (qtd. in Steranko 14). 6 The Grand Comics Database suggests that there is doubt concerning the identities of the writer and artist of "Capt. Marvel and the Mark of the Black Swastika." While the scriptwriter is not known, it is possible, according to the Database, that Beck's assistant Pete Costanza was the penciller and inker (the Database entry also lists the main characters of the story as "Cap tain Marvel [Billy Batson]; the Devil; Adolf Hitler; Herman Goering; Jo sef Goebbels"). See www.comics.org for more information. For more on Binder's satirical sensibility and his debt to writers including Jonathan Swift and Lewis Carroll, see Schelly page 83. 7 For more on the lawsuit, see Dick Lupoff's "The Big Red Cheese" and Steranko pages 20-21. 8 Mark Best provides a detailed and insightful reading of Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family in "Domesticity, Homosociality, and Male Power in Superhero Comics of the 1950s." His essay, however, focuses largely on one of the final stories of the original Captain's career, "Captain Marvel's Wedding" from Captain Marvel Adventures #150 (Nov. 1953), the series' final issue. Captain Marvel Adventures #20, the focus of this essay, in cludes an amusing scene in which Beautia, who has warned Billy Batson about her father's successful attempt to revive Attila the Hun, swoons, only to be rebuffed by the Captain: "Er—look now, Beautia! Let's stick to busi ness!" (58). It should be also be noted that Otto Binder played a significant role in developing the Superman Family. For more information on Binder's work for DC Comics, see Schelly's biography, Chapters 12 and 13. 9 For a more detailed discussion of the myths of World War II, especially as popularized in film and television, see Edward Wood, Jr., Worshipping the</page><page sequence="26">58 Myths of World War II: Reflections on America's Dedication to War (espe cially his notes on Steven Spielberg, Tom Brokaw, and Stephen E. Ambrose on pages 76-86); Michael C. C. Adams' The Best War Ever: America and World War II; and Paul Fussell's work, including Wartime: Understand ing and Behavior in World War II. For a discussion of comic books and superheroes during World War II, see Christopher Murray's Champions of the Oppressed: Superhero Comics, Popular Culture, and Propaganda in America During World War II. 10 For Pierce's comments on Captain Marvel, humor, and camp, see "Levity, Learning, and Lightning Bolts" in The Golden Age of Comics #1 (December 1982). 11 Murray also draws a parallel between Captain Marvel and Joe Simon and Jack Kirby's Captain America, characters whose transformations served "as inspirational fantasies for children, and young boys in particular, who might well have dreamt of finding a way to participate in a more direct way than buying war bonds" (156). 12 As Pierce points out in his review and summary of Captain Marvel Adven tures #66, these comics usually featured a mixture of the whimsical and the serious: "[While] comics historians have generally presented the Golden Age Captain Marvel as one who fought madcap villains such as Dr. Sivana and Mr. Mind in lighthearted, tongue-in-cheek tales, it is often forgotten that he had many adventures of a more serious nature" often "with an over riding sense of moral value and perhaps even social concern" (Pierce, The Fawcett Companion 38). 13 For more information on the development of the Code, see David Hadju's The Ten-Cent Plague: The Great Comic-Book Scare and How It Changed America and Chapter 6 of Bradford W. Wright's Comic Book Nation. 14 Kidd and Spear's photographic history of Captain Marvel does not in clude page numbers. 15 Captain Marvel's reference to the Devil as "Old Scratch" suggests a link to Stephen Vincent Benét's popular short story "The Devil and Daniel Web ster," which was first published in 1937. The film version, directed by Wil liam Dieterle from a screenplay cowritten by Benêt himself (see Singer 265 and Cooksey 20), was released in the autumn of 1941. In the story, when</page><page sequence="27">59 asked his name, the Devil declines to provide a direct answer: '"I've gone by a good many,' said the stranger carelessly. 'Perhaps Scratch will do for the evening. I'm often called that in these regions'"(Benêt 37). See Thomas L. Cooksey and Robert Singer for discussions of the cultural sig nificance of the film version of the story as America entered World War II. As Cooksey argues, "Webster and Scratch embody two conflicting interpre tations of America and American history, a dichotomy that took on special significance when the movie appeared in 1941, during the dark days of the Second World War" (21). 16 As McCloud remarks later in Chapter Two, "Ironic that the two bastions of cartoony art are underground and children's comics! Pretty far apart as genres go" (McCloud 56). For a recent discussion of Captain Marvel and the character's place in the history of comics for children, see "Toon Trea sury Think Tank!: A Colloquy on Classic Kids' Comics," moderated by Art Spiegelman and edited by Jeet Heer, in issue #302 of The Comics Journal (January 2013), pages 240-246 and 335-336. 17 Adams points out the significance of comic books as reading material for American soldiers: "The media age also spawned comic books, whose su perheroes further simplified the issues and made them black and white. By 1942, twelve million comic books a month were sold, one-third to people over eighteen. They were the favorite reading of the private soldier" (Ad ams 10-11). In his analysis of the early superhero teams during World War II and the Cold War, Robert G. Weiner explains why many soldiers found these costumed heroes so appealing: "Illustrated stories about hero exploits helped the soldiers get over their boredom during periods of inactivity, and many of the four-colored characters fought the same enemy as the service men. The superheroes served as tremendous morale boosters" (Weiner 83). Works Cited Adams, Michael C. C. The Best War Ever: America and World War II. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins U P, 1994. Print.
