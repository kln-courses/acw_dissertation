<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOCIAL SCIENCE AND POLITICAL REALITY: THE PROBLEM OF EXPLANATION BY JOHN G. GUNNELL Une of the most interesting characteristics of American politi- cal science is the extent to which this discipline has insulated itself from contemporary philosophy and especially from the growing body of literature in the philosophy of the social sciences. Political scientists, both proponents and opponents of behavioral- ism, have largely avoided any substantive analysis of the philo- sophical problems involved in the empirical study of politics. The purpose of this essay is not only to pursue a particular thesis about explanation in the social sciences but to discuss, at least tentatively, a series of philosophical problems which must be of continuing concern to political and social scientists. The eschewal of such problems, however, is once again evident in the recent American Academy monograph which, despite its declared con- cern with "a broad philosophical context/* * focuses principally on hackneyed controversies over scope and method. Questions about the boundaries of political science and the definition of politics have degenerated into pseudo-problems, and much of the discussion has led to obfuscation rather than clarification. Yet it is too easy simply to dismiss these issues as trivial disputes and argue "that scope should be left entirely up to the individual scholar." 2 Methodological issues tend to become meaningless when detached from their philosophical roots, but significant problems often remain concealed beneath the residue. Many would maintain that it is a precious, and probably fruitless, en- i James C.

But although one may agree that "we are not students of some subject matter but students of problems/' 3 such a posi- tion may be ultimately unsatisfactory because it tends to beg the question of specifying the criteria by which we distinguish problems and evaluate the relevance of explanations. I What I wish to stress from the outset is the circular or, follow- ing Thomas Kuhn's now familiar and fashionable description, the paradigmatic character of any science.4 It is impossible ration- ally to sustain any problem orientation, analytical framework, set of definitions, model or methodology except in terms of prior assumptions about the nature of the universe that is to be ex- plored. "The final problem in science is the justification of one's distribution of emphasis," 5 and any such justification is a philo- sophical problem. The "regulative principles" 6 that govern our vision of reality and constitute the paradigm that gives coherence and direction to scientific activity are not given and incorrigible. But neither are they empirically demonstrable. These princi- ples comprise "the philosophical dimension of social science" and "its primordial way of looking at the world," 7 and the criteria for defining problems and formulating and assessing hy- potheses depend on these philosophical categoricals which lie at 3 Karl Popper, Conjectures and Refutations (New York: Basic Books, 1962), p. 67.

Once this paradigmatic aspect of science is accepted, the level at which meaningful discussion about competing approaches and defini- tions must take place becomes apparent. It must be conducted not on the level of the approaches themselves but rather in terms of the prescientific conceptualizations of reality which justify these approaches. Conceptual problems such as the specification of political data can neither be reduced to empirical problems nor solved by formalization and the operationalization of terminology. Such issues as well as the prior question of the nature of social reality in general belong to the philosophical dimension of social science. Even terms such as logic, science, explanation, theory, hypothesis, empirical and observation, while to a certain extent universal or "field-invariant" in regard to their force, are "field- dependent" or contextually diverse in regard to substantive meaning and criteria of application.8 The dependence of a vocabulary on a philosophical paradigm means that a mere standardization of concepts cannot, as many social scientists have hoped in the past and others apparently still assume, create a community of scholarship. "Language can reflect underlying consensus; it cannot create it." 9 As long as controversies in the discipline are conducted at an inappropriate sub-paradigmatic level and definitions and approaches are justified in terms of such vague criteria as heuristic value, which remain empty without a substantive view of what explanation means, discussion will re- main bound to the familiar and perennial, and apparently sterile, debate about scope, purpose and method. But it may be worth- while inquiring why so much importance is attached to the search for a delimiting definition of politics and political science and why it is assumed that "the definition of politics with which one starts is obviously of crucial significance." 10 » These terms are borrowed from Stephen Toulmin, The Uses of Argument (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1958). »Natanson, op. cit., p. 15. loVernon Van Dyke, "The Optimum Scope of Political Science," in Charles- worth, op. cit., p. 9.</page><page sequence="4">162 SOCIAL RESEARCH Usually definitions serve to state the meaning of a word or its use in a language, yet this can hardly be the purpose for which such definitions of politics as "the authoritative allocation of val- ues for a society" or "any persistent pattern of human relations that involves, to a significant extent, power, rule, or authority" are offered.11 Most of the definitions that are suggested would be meaningless unless general familiarity with the use of the term "politics" was presupposed. Since it would probably be a mistake to ascribe to those who pursue the search for definitions the naive belief that there is some definite, objective, and incontrovertible meaning or reference for the term, it is reasonable to presume that these definitions are offered as providing some information about, or insight into, the general range of activity that the term denotes, that is, that they are theoretical definitions that serve to explain political activity. But as theoretical or explanatory definitions they are deficient, because they have no necessary empirical con- tent; they do not contain or depend upon any propositions that are open to refutation. It may be plausible to view these defini- tions as part of an attempt to explain, in the sense of specifying, a delimiting or differentiating characteristic that distinguishes politics from other activities. Such a view, however, comes up abruptly against at least two difficulties. First, there is little to support the contention that what is offered as a defining character- istic is anything more than an attribute of politics rather than the necessary or distinguishing feature. Second, such definitions are usually of equal or greater generality than that which is being defined, and thus rather than an explanation or meaning- ful distinction the result is conceptual reduplication. Although this pervasive concern with definitions and questions about the "what" of politics closely resembles the essentialist view that a definition gives the meaning of a term by designating the essence of its reference, it would seem, despite the similarity, that what 11 David Easton, The Political System (New York: Alfred Knopf, 1953), p. 129; Robert Dahl, Modern Political Analysis (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall, 1963), p. 6.</page><page sequence="5">PROBLEM OF EXPLANATION 163 is involved here is a set of assumptions that are closer to a Hob- besian nominalism. But what is common to both positions is the mistaken view that science, and knowledge in general, pro- ceed from definitions that serve as non-contingent and primitive principles or propositions.12 Whatever the precise basis for the demand for definition, it is clear that the presuppositions have not been philosophically examined. This failure has moved political science not only towards a further proliferation of definitions and analytical frameworks but also toward an increasing formalism which, de- spite its avowed empirical emphasis, has no clear relation to empirical inquiry and offers a terminology for classifying data that appears generally less illuminating than ordinary language. The discipline has been marked by a continually widening gap between both taxonomic and methodological refinement on the one hand and empirical relevance on the other; Wittgenstein's remarks on psychology seem appropriate for much of contempo- rary social science: The confusion and barrenness of psychology is not to be ex- plained by calling it a "young science;" its state is not comparable with that of physics, for instance, in its beginnings. . . . For in psychology there are experimental methods and conceptual con- fusion. The existence of experimental methods makes us think we have the means of solving the problems which trouble us, though problems and methods pass one another by.13 Social science is, no more than physical science, "just a systematic exposure of the senses to the world/' 14 and the development of complex analytical schema and quantitative techniques is no substitute for philosophically specifying the character of social and political phenomena and the nature of explanation.

These frameworks, however, are devoid of any clear philosophical foundation and are unsup- ported by any explicit paradigm, and it is a lack of any such foundation that makes any meaningful choice between them impossible. No approach is self-justifying, and the common pragmatic appeal to "usefulness" is hollow when there are no theo- retical criteria for determining what is "useful." Such approaches as structural-functionalism and systems analy- sis, as well as their manifold variations, seek to establish their identity, legitimacy and differentiation from a vaguely defined activity understood as the traditional study of politics by a com- mitment to "a science of politics modeled after the methodologi- cal assumptions of the natural sciences." 15 Yet the content of this commitment to the "scientific method" is rarely explicated or justified except by nebulous references to the "web of 'if then* relations" and "testing ... by evidence obtained by standardized and impersonally reproducible procedures." 16 The superficial appropriation of the language of science is not sufficient to insure identity, and an examination of these approaches reveals little similarity to theory in natural science. They appear to provide little more than quite arbitrary categories for the classification of data; each analytical framework seeks to reduce the flux of phenomena to order by the magic power of naming. Rather than philosophical justification for such approaches as systems analysis, we are confronted with an orthodox posture and the warning that dissenters will be marked as "obsolescents" and that is David Easton, A Framework for Political Analysis (Englewood Cliffs: Prentice- Hall, 1965), pp. 8, 17. is Karl W.

There are fewer still who would be wanton enough to undertake some empirical research without seeking to tie it, however modestly, into a broader theo- retical context.17 "Theoretical context" here means analytical framework, and it is unfortunate for the discipline that there are only a * 'wanton" few who do not attempt to bind their research to some such framework, no matter how irrelevant it may be for inquiry and explanation. In the "theoretical" literature of political science there is little reasoned argument supporting this increasing formalism other than the ill-defined appeal to the authority of the canons of natural science and certain misconceived notions about the his- tory of science. Many political scientists appear to have an inadequate understanding of the role of formalism in the scientific enterprise and often confuse the finished product of science or the logical justification of theories with the procedure of inquiry. Also there is a tendency to adhere to the naive belief that there is a necessary and natural progression in any science from taxonomy or description and classification to explanatory theory. More important, however, is the unreflective acceptance of cer- tain epistemological assumptions of natural science. Despite a continuing debate in the philosophy of science between theoreti- cal realism and instrumentalism,18 natural science, continually wary of the pitfalls of essentialism, has accepted as a regulative principle the idea that the structure of the physical world is 17 Easton, A Framework for Political Analysis, p. 3, and Bertram M.

Although this assumption has be- come an integral aspect of the paradigm of natural science, there has been little consideration of whether such an assumption is appropriate for the explanation of social phenomena. Yet this general view appears tacitly to inform much of the recent theo- rizing in the social sciences.19 The work of Parsons and Easton presents archetypes of this mode of approaching the social world. Here social and political phenomena are assumed to be intelligi- ble and gain meaning only through the imposition of an a priori set of categories which begin to take on ontological autonomy.20 Problems such as the definition of politics lose their grounding in the phenomenal world, and every event is either redefined in terms of a category of the analytical framework or loses its status as reality. Within the discipline of political science, the philo- sophical question of the nature of political reality and the gen- eral problem of the "epistemology of the social world1 ' 21 have seldom been raised, yet it is the decision on these matters that in the end determines and justifies what is meant by science, concept formation, and explanation. Explanation is an epistemo- logical concept, and any attempt to universalize its substantive meaning and separate the criteria for its application from a specific context or class of problems must fail. i» In sociology, the origin of this view is apparent in such thinkers as Durkheim, but it is also a legacy of the manipulative concerns of modern political philosophy as well as earlier conceptions of social science as an instrument of social change. Since an applied science measures its effectiveness by the ability to predict and control, theory must be viewed primarily as an instrument, but the predominance of the idea of a purely explanatory science in contemporary social science raises questions about the instrumental perspective. 20 For a perspicacious analysis of this trend see Paul Kress, "Self, System, and Significance: Reflections on Professor Easton's Political Science," Ethics, Vol. 77, Oct., 1966. 2i Natanson, op. at., p. 9.</page><page sequence="9">PROBLEM OF EXPLANATION 167 Current attempts by social scientists to produce formal theory appear hopelessly inadequate if measured by the logical impera- tives of natural science which they profess to accept, and this deficiency cannot be explained in terms of subject matter limita- tions in the same way that one might understand the differences between physics and meteorology. Neither can these shortcomings be rationalized by metaphors suggesting temporary theoretical immaturity or malnutrition. The difficulty with contemporary theorizing is not that it is underdeveloped but that its assump- tions are not viable. Social science has adopted some of the ritualism of natural science with little regard for its relevance to social inquiry; it has devoted more attention to a definition of science than to a definition of what is to be explained. My point is not that a cogent argument for the application of the logic of explanation employed in the natural sciences to problems encountered in social investigation cannot be formulated since my principal concern is to challenge such a position. But social scientists, and especially political scientists, have, except in a few instances, neither developed such an argument nor carefully ex- plored its merits. Instead they have dogmatically and superficially embraced a particular, and indeed controversial, model of science and a position on the unity of empirical inquiry advocated by certain philosophers of science without considering alternative views or the applicability of such a model to the problems of explanation with which they are confronted. In other words, the so-called "behavioral" 22 approach in political science may be criticized from at least two perspectives: first, the adequacy of both its understanding and application of the logic of natural science, and, second, the relevance of the naturalistic approach, even if properly understood, for the explanation of social phe- nomena. It is essentially the latter problem which I wish to address here - not the quite obvious deficiencies of social and 22 Easton, A Framework for Political Analysis, Ch. I.</page><page sequence="10">168 SOCIAL RESEARCH political science in applying the modes of theory and explanation characteristic of natural science but the epistemological question of the very possibility of such an endeavor. II I will assume that the central task of social science, the core of the social scientific enterprise, is the explanation of that species of human behavior that is understood as action and that the primary concern is with social action or action performed in a social context. This does not mean that social science is not in some instances concerned with individual action or even other forms of behavior, nor does it imply that the circumstances or conditions of action are not legitimate areas of inquiry; but the concern with rendering action intelligible is the defining char- acteristic of social science whatever else might be entailed in the totality of the enterprise. This presupposes a commitment to certain categoricals pertaining to what is meant by science and explanation, and this commitment in turn demands a specification of social reality and a clarification of the concept of action. From its inception, social science has been marked by a controversy whose poles have been variously characterized but which, if the many tertiary issues that have been generated by this controversy are bracketed, can be reduced to the philosophical question of whether there is symmetry between the natural and social sciences with regard to concept formation and the logic of inquiry and explanation. Much of contemporary social science accepts the thesis of symmetry however inadequate its justification of this thesis and however deficient its attempts to implement it when judged by the very canons of procedure that it seeks to emulate. It is this assumption of symmetry that I wish to demonstrate is inappropriate. The challenge to the symmetry thesis is certainly as old as Max Weber, and in recent years has received support from such ostensibly divergent quarters as phenomenology and the various philosophical trends deriving from the later work of Wittgenstein. My approach draws substantially on these sources although its principal focus may be best characterized, without</page><page sequence="11">PROBLEM OF EXPLANATION 169 identifying too closely with Cassirer, as a philosophy of symbolic forms.23 Those who accept the idea of symmetry do not, except in a few extreme instances, maintain that there are no significant differences between the subject matter of the natural and social sciences, but they do maintain that there is nothing about ex- planations of human action ' 'which differentiates them in principle from explanations in the natural sciences, or which requires for their validation a distinctive logic of inquiry/' 24 Although it may be admitted that the subject matter of social science may limit what can be accomplished with the "logical rules/ ' they insist that this nevertheless does not alter these rules and that "the logic of explanation holds good whatever the subject matter under investigation, and the mode of explanation used in science is valid in any discipline/' 25 Although it is often urged that the characteristics of social phenomena may place limitations on the production of powerful universal theories, either in principle or because of the present state of our knowledge, and may limit social science to probabilistic or trend theories, it is argued that the basic features of the logic of explanation must be considered uniform because: To hold that the social sciences are methodologically distinct from the nonsocial sciences is to hold not merely (or perhaps not at all) the banal view that the social sciences employ different tech- niques of inquiry, but rather the startling view that the social sciences require a different logic of inquiry. To hold such a view, moreover, is to deny that all of science is characterized by a com- mon logic of justification in its acceptance or rejection of hypoth- eses or theories.26 23 1 have elsewhere discussed this approach and its application to a specific problem in concept formation in social science. 24 Ernest Nagel, "Problems of Concept and Theory Formation in the Social Sciences," in Natanson, op. cit., p. 206. 25 Quentin Gibson, The Logic of Social Inquiry (New York: Humanities Press, 1960), p. 91; Eugene J.

The assumption that the logic of inquiry and explanation, even in the natural sciences, is monolithic or the idea that there is any clear agreement among philosophers of science or scientists on this matter is clearly wrong, as the classic debate over induction well demonstrates. On the other hand if all that is meant by "common logic" is simply the empirical testing of hypotheses, the whole argument is trivial. But even this emphasis on testing may be misleading for "while testability is vital for scientific explanation it is not the criterion for explanation." 27 The crucial question would seem to be to what extent such terms as logic, test and observation can have equivalent meaning in different areas of inquiry. Often, in support of the symmetry thesis, a great deal is made of a distinction between the source of an hypothesis or the context of discovery and the testing and valida- tion of an hypothesis or the context of justification, that is, that while the rules relating to the former vary from discipline to discipline or may not be governed by logic or rules at all, the logic pertaining to the latter is invariant.28 From one point of view this is an important distinction since it would seem that in no inquiry is there a logic of discovery and hypothesis formation in the sense that one may speak of a logic of testing and justifica- tion,29 but it is necessary nevertheless to emphasize that there can be no radical disjunction between these contexts since both the formulation and testing of hypotheses takes place within a wider philosophical context, within a paradigm that governs the con- ception of the subject matter and the meaning of explanation. Although it may be true that there have been instances where a failure to distinguish these contexts has resulted in misconceived 27 John W.

But more importantly, no such distinction meets the principal objections to the sym- metry thesis and the model of explanation advocated by its pro- ponents. This thesis, which has become a working assumption of much of social scientific theorizing and finds expression in the idea that there must be a uniform epistemological and logical requirement for approaching any empirical investigation, has resulted in a distorted conception of the subject matter of social science and what constitutes valid explanation.30 The symmetry thesis has been defended in a systematic manner not so much by social scientists as by philosophers of natural science who have devoted only limited attention to social science theory and the problems of inquiry 31 and whose views on the gen- eral question of explanation are by no means unchallenged by other philosophers even with regard to their application in natural science. When political scientists such as Easton and Dahl argue that the concern of social science is with "discoverable uniformities in political behavior " that "can be expressed in generalizations or theories with explanatory and predictive value" and that "ex- planation [is] simply the subsuming of a particular event or class of events, the occurrence of which we wish to 'explain/ under a more general law or hypothesis," they are appealing to the familiar deductive model of logical empiricism.32 This is the proposition so A.

Whatever the merits of this view as either a descriptive or prescriptive model for the natural sciences, the insistence on the application of "deductive causal explanations" 33 in history and social science not only raises grave philosophical questions about its relevance but recommends a method that has yet found no significant application in social science and that also takes little account of much of the actual practice of social scientists in producing explanations of social phenomena. The deductive model as explicated by philosophers such as Hempel and Nagel may be intended principally as an ideal typification which serves to make scientific practice and hypothesis justification intelligible rather than as a precise description of any particular phase of normal science. But there can be little doubt that in the course of explication the model takes on prescriptive overtones, and, as viewed by many social scientists, the role of the model as a typification has been entirely transformed into a stan- dard to be followed in the course of inquiry.

In social science not only is the frequent asym- metry of explanation and prediction obvious, that is, the relevance of explanations that are in no way predictive and the possibility of statistical prediction without answering in any significant manner the question "why;" but the whole idea of explanation as the subsumption of particular events under universal laws has little or no application. The frequent and strained attempts to salvage the deductive model either by arguing that the subject matter of social science merely limits the comprehensiveness of deductive explanations and that the model can be modified to accommodate such traditional social science explanations as functionalism or by maintaining that, as compared with physics and chemistry, social science necessarily possesses only "imperfect knowledge" about social phenomena, simply will not withstand careful scru- tiny.34 So-called laws of human behavior as well as the elements of most analytical frameworks tend to be truisms and tautologies or: at best merely summaries of explanations accepted for individual cases; they are not generalizations which, by the manner in which they embrace instances, explain them.35 Such abstracted summaries and inventories, unlike the theore- tical explanations of physics, add nothing to particular ad hoc ex- planations and only serve to obscure what may be most relevant in a particular context. What is set forth as a nomothetic explana- tion is usually "covertly idiographic." 36 The point is that social scientific explanations are not "imperfect" or inferior instances of naturalistic explanations but qualitatively different modes of "making intelligible." Explanation is a radically context-bound 3* Cf. May Brodbeck, "Explanation, Prediction, and 'Imperfect' Knowledge," in Feigl and Maxwell, op. cit. 35 Louch, op. cit., pp. 40, 38.

Even if one could demonstrate the validity of philosophical deductivism or the epistemological as- sumption that all human knowledge is somehow a process of de- ductive inference, it would in no way require the acceptance of methodological deductivism for the generic pattern of explanation is its systemic or contextual character. Not deducibility, but intelligibility constitutes the basic feature of the logic of explanation. Understanding and in- telligibility are the basic controls operative in every context. Test- ability and deducibility are the specific controls of the physical sciences. When the controls of testability and deducibility are set aside for the more generic form of explanation, we do not retreat into some vague common denominator shared by early perceptual responses, myth, and metaphysical constructions.37 What the advocates of the symmetry thesis and the deductive model in social science address themselves to, essentially, is the contention of those who maintain that the subject matter of the social sciences, that is, social action, "requires that it should be explained in terms additional to those adequate for the natural sciences'' or "fundamentally different in kind." 38 In other words the symmetry thesis is not only a recommendation for the conduct of inquiry but equally, and perhaps primarily, a critique of a diverse group of arguments that are united by the common assump- tion that any adequate explanation of human action cannot be given without reference to mentalistic concepts such as purpose and intention and cannot be replaced by or translated into state- ments about overt behavior. These arguments maintain that it is logically impossible to give a complete description or sufficient explanation of action without reference to "what it means to the participants" 39 and that such explanations cannot be reduced to explanations that have the same logical structure as explanations of physical events and processes.

Sometimes the issue is posed in terms of whether there is, or can be, a general science of society or human behavior. From one perspective, that which would equate science with physi- cal science, the answer must be "no," yet if the meaning of science is not restricted to a single epistemological base and one particular pattern of explanation, the answer must be "yes." It is the search for a uniform mode of explanation employing universal laws and the attempt to avoid mentalistic concepts in describing and ex- plaining action that are futile.40 To reject explanations utilizing mentalistic concepts in favor of analogies with physical processes and to define action in terms of "behavioral dispositions, bodily states, and environmental cir- cumstances" similar to "viscosity" or "electrical resistance" 41 which can be treated statistically is to engage in a curious sort of reverse anthropomorphism or mechanomorphism. Modern science may attribute much of its success to the exorcism of men- talistic explanations of natural phenomena, but there is no reason to suppose that the imposition of a physicalist language is relevant for the description and explanation of either social phenomena or human behavior in general. To believe that, since part of the success of physical science was accomplished by introducing a vocabulary and epistemology suitable for explaining physical proc- esses, this program should be extended to explanations of social phenomena is to commit the same type of mistake as did primitive man when he projected his own mental and social world on to the 4&lt;&gt;Louch, op. cit., p. viii; Runciman, op. cit., Ch.

Attempts to operational ize mentalistic con- cepts and reduce them to physical language rests on the fallacy that all explanation must be stated in terms of one data language and one language of explanation. It is quite easy to demonstrate that many of those who cling to the notion of symmetry and inveigh against mentalistic explana- tions and a method based on "an imaginative construction of either rational or irrational activities" 42 have created a straw man, for, except for Dilthey and possibly Collingwood, few, and cer- tainly no contemporary opponents of symmetry, have ever advo- cated what appears to be the primary object of the symmetrists' attack, that is, the imaginative reliving of a situation or the em- pathetic understanding of other minds as a procedure for explain- ing social action or validating hypotheses.43 This has sometimes been taken to be the necessary implication of any reference to mental episodes in explanations of action, and it has become al- most commonplace for philosophers of science who direct their attention to the social sciences to ascribe to Weber the view that verstehen is a method whereby an observer both introspects "in light of his own 'subjective' experiences the 'internal meanings' of social action" and validates hypotheses about such actions.44 But any careful reading of Weber would reveal that he main- tained no such thesis. Although this is not the place to enter into a detailed analysis of Weber's work, it is necessary to clarify his position not only because he has become a pivotal figure in the debate about symmetry and is seen as "the greatest symbol . . . of the old methodology which has proved so wasteful" 45 but be- « Popper, The Poverty of Historicism, p. 21. 43 Cf.

Weber never advocated verstehen or interpretive understanding as a means of testing or validating explanations, and he explicitly stated that "verification of subjective interpretation by compari- son with a concrete course of events is, as in the case of all hy- potheses, indispensable." 46 Weber stressed that knowledge emanating from verstehen, or the "meaning" of an action, was never a priori or incorrigible; explanations referring to the in- tentions of actors were not to be taken as certain and were con- sidered adequate only when corroborated by observations of be- havior and other elements in a social situation.47 Weber's conception of subjective understanding is not an appeal to in- trospectionism or intuitionism.48 Such understanding is sub- jective not because it is private or an imputation of one's beliefs and feelings to others but because it is directed toward an illumi- nation of the ideational bases of action; 49 and does not involve an intuitive probe of either the individual or group psyche but rather an attempt to give a rational account of observed behavior in situation-motivational terms. Weber clearly maintains that "to imagine oneself performing a similar action is not a necessary prerequisite to understanding" and that in regard to social action "explanatory understanding" involves "putting the act in an in- telligible and more inclusive context of meaning." 50 For Weber "action is social insofar as, by virtue of the subjective meaning attached to it by the acting individual (or individuals), it takes account of the behavior of others and is thereby oriented in its 46 Talcott Parsons (ed.), Max Weber: The Theory of Social and Economic Organi- zation (New York: Oxford University Press, 1947), pp. 96, 97. 47 Ibid., pp. 89-90, 96, 99-100. « Cf.

Although Weber takes the intentional action of individuals as the basic unit of social reality, explanation of such action is to be accomplished not by a penetration of the mind but through an elucidation of what might be termed "external motivation." This becomes intelligible only in terms of a conceptual clarification of what Weber termed a "style of life" with its network of symbols, rules, conventions and the structural relationships that would justify observed action. For Weber verstehen did not so much designate a method or procedure for either inquiry or the testing of hypotheses as it did a kind of explanation.52 Following Weber, I would suggest that the model of explana- tion attributed to natural science, and consequently the logic of inquiry, concept formation and theory construction, are inap- propriate for social science, because they derive from an otiose conception of social reality. It is necessary, though, to demon- strate that this assertion has nothing to do with such singular and incomprehensible issues as that of an empirical versus nonem- pirical science or even scientific as opposed to historical or human- istic explanation. All that "empirical" and "scientific" can mean in a "field-invariant" sense is that no explanation can be accepted as non-contingent or beyond criticism, and that observations can always disqualify an hypothesis. But what is often overlooked is 6i Ibi d., pp. 88, 89, 98-99. 52 For further discussion see William Tucker, "Max Weber's Verstehen" The Sociological Quarterly, Vol. 6, 1965; Peter A.

There is no such thing as an independent or autonomous observation, for "language . . . con- tributes to the formation and participates in the constitution of a fact," 53 and what will count as an empirical or crucial observation depends on the distribution of emphasis or the theoretical context in which explanation takes place. It has been this version of the "myth of the given," the insistence by much of the modern tradi- tion of empiricism and positivism on the existence of a class of authoritative, incorrigible, and intersubjective sense-datum obser- vations as the foundation and source of all valid claims to knowl- edge and such correlates as overdrawn distinctions between the contexts of discovery and justification and the reification of the logical difference between theoretical and observation language, that has been accepted by many contemporary advocates of the deductive model and the symmetry thesis and that has produced a distorted picture not only of explanation in the social sciences but in the natural sciences as well.54 To argue that the essential aspect of the explanation of social action is the conceptual clarification of a social situation or style of life in no way entails a retreat to a priorism or to a non-empirical intuitionism which is the parody often presented as the only al- ternative to the causal-deductive model.55 It only means that social science must concern itself "with those processes in which symbols, or at any rate meanings, play an essential part." 56 Part of the difficulty here should be quite obvious. Once the subject matter of an inquiry is formulated and terms such as "empirical" and "objective" are defined in such a way as to exclude reference to subjective meaning, then any methodology or explanation based 58 Waismann, op. cit., p. 141. 54 See Wilfrid Sellars, "Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind," in Herbert Feigl and Michael Scriven (eds.), Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1956), Vol. I; Popper, Conjectures and Refutations, "Introduction"; Louch, op. cit., pp. 43-45. 55 Cf.

What must be considered is the philosophical problem of social reality and the paradigm of investigation; arguments on the level of methodology are necessarily insoluble. Although the question of a priorism versus empiricism creates difficulties even among those who are in general agreement about the character of social scientific explanation,67 the few instances where a charge of a priorism would seem to hold would be those involving theorists such as Parsons and Easton who approach all investigations with a predetermined and complex analytical apparatus which lies be- yond the pale of falsification. Like the physical scientist, the social scientist seeks to render the encountered world intelligible and "obtain organized knowl- edge of social reality." 58 But, unlike the natural world, the struc- ture of social relationships and the meaning of social events are not principally functions of the scientist's theory. What the social scientist confronts is not a first order but a second order reality. This is a world of intersubjectively shared symbols, a logically ordered world that has been pre-constituted by the participants and in whose terms action is conducted and justified; and the illumination of these symbols must be the central aspect of ex- planation. It is up to the natural scientist and to him alone to define, in ac- cordance with the procedural rules of his science, his observational field, and to determine the facts, data, and events within it which are relevant for his problem or scientific purpose at hand. Neither are those facts and events pre-selected, nor is the observational 57 See the debate between A. R.

Although Winch, The Idea of a Social Science (New York: Humanities Press, 1958), appears at times to suggest that social knowledge consists of something like empathetic understanding (p. 88) and does tend to suggest that explanation is largely a matter of analyzing the language and symbols of a society and specifying its values, the issues between Winch and Louch are not substantial, for Winch never denies that social inquiry includes detailed empirical work both in terms of formulating and justifying explanations. ss Schutz, op. ctL, p. 236.</page><page sequence="23">PROBLEM OF EXPLANATION 181 world pre-interpreted. The world of nature, as explored by the natural scientist, does not 'mean' anything to the molecules, atoms, and electrons. But the observational world of the social scientist - social reality - has a specific meaning and relevance structure for the human beings living, acting, and thinking within it. By a series of common-sense constructs they have pre-selected and pre- interpreted this world which they experience as the reality of their daily lives. It is these thought objects of theirs which determine their behavior by motivating it. The thought objects constructed by the social scientist, in order to grasp this social reality, must be founded upon the thought objects constructed by the common- sense thinking of men, living their daily life within their social world. Thus the constructs of the social sciences are, so to speak, constructs of the second degree, that is, constructs of the con- structs made by the actors on the social scene, whose behavior the social scientist has to observe and to explain in accordance with the procedural rules of his science.59 This position which attributes an intrinsic meaning to the social world and social action involves neither a retreat to essentialism nor a commission of the "reproductive fallacy," 60 or the idea that concepts must somehow reproduce the reality to which they refer, but it does rule out the instrumentalist view of explanatory con- cepts which informs much of current social science theorizing. The language of social science necessarily takes precedence over the language of everyday life in describing and explaining the social world. Ordinary language and the ontology of the Lebenswelt are not an ultimate datum or "given" to which all other realms of discourse must be reduced, despite the fact that they are the source of all more specialized realms of discourse and conceptions of reality. (And similarly the language and logic of social science cannot be reduced to that employed in describing and explaining the natural world.) 61 While the language and view of reality of 59 Ibid., p. 242. so Rudner, op. cit., p. 70. eiWaismann, "Language Strata," in A.

While the natural scientist and social scientist alike are concerned with the intersubjective concepts constituting their science, the social scientist must also be concerned with the inter- subjective order of everyday life and language.62 Peter Winch's exaggerated, and consequently frequently mis- understood, claim that the explanation of social action is in fact philosophy rather than science since it must concern itself with the clarification of the concepts, beliefs, conventions and rules operative in society - that is, the view of reality that constitutes the limits of social action - and with the epistemological question of the relationship of mind to reality, presents the same difficulty that is evident in the arguments of those who maintain that any empirical social science must be logically symmetrical with natural science. But properly to clarify Winch's argument, it must be understood, first, that he is concerned with demonstrating that "the central concepts which belong to our understanding of social life are incompatible with the concepts central to the activity of scientific prediction" 63 and, second, that the object of his attack is the symmetry thesis or the attempt to assimilate social scientific explanation to natural science as well as both certain trends within contemporary philosophy which have tended to hold that since philosophy is concerned with problems of language it is not con- cerned with the "world" and the tendency of science in general to divorce itself from philosophical questions or reduce them to empirical questions. The latter issue can perhaps be clarified somewhat by noting that while previous generations did not dis- tinguish the philosophy of science from science (as well as political philosophy from social science), the contemporary differentiation and relative autonomy of these enterprises has led, especially in 62 winch, op. cit., p. 87. ea Ibid., p. 94.</page><page sequence="25">PROBLEM OF EXPLANATION 183 the social sciences, to a temptation "to confuse the sound idea that philosophy is not science with the mistaken idea that philosophy is independent of science." e4 In regard to the first and more central issue, granting the fact that Winch's thesis may be at cer- tain points misleading, I would nevertheless propose a somewhat similar thesis based on a different but related line of argument. I would submit that given the view of social reality indicated above, the role of the social scientist - and I wish to stress this point - is closer to that of the philosopher and historian of science than to that of the natural scientist. While the philosopher of science is concerned with under- standing the activity of the scientist in terms of the paradigm and logic that inform scientific activity - that is, the conception of physical reality, the rules of concept formation and criticism in the intersubjective community of science, and the process of para- digm transformation - the social scientist is concerned with similar data in wider communities. Both the philosopher of science and the social scientist are concerned with the illumination of second order realms. For the philosopher of science to understand, ex- plain and evaluate the theory and practice of science raises no questions of intuition, introspectionism, or imaginative reliving on the one hand and demands no deductive causal explanations on the other. To ask for a general theory of social action and to endeavor to construct definitive analytical frameworks and con- structs for describing and explaining the social world would be as logically queer as asking for a general causal and predictive theory of scientific activity. The principle task of general theory in the social sciences must be to determine the character of symbolic transformation in a social context and the "social construction of reality." 65 This view of explanation would solve several of the persistent dilemmas of social science. First, it would provide the social scientist with a justification for performing the critical and 6*Sellars, "Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind," p. 301. «5 For an important beginning in this direction see Peter L.

Second, to understand the role of the social scientist in these terms would aid in clarifying the relationship between theory and prac- tice or between political science and public policy. Social science is often broken down into the categories of pure and applied, but these categories, appropriated from natural science, create con- tinual difficulties when they are used to refer to the relationship between the social scientist and the adminstrator or statesman. The relationship between the social scientist and the social practi- tioner is an important and meaningful one, but it is a mistake to assume that it is analogous to that holding between the scientist and the engineer; the associative tie between social science and social policy cannot be equated with that between natural science and technology. The worlds of social science and social policy are far from mutually exclusive, but the social scientist no more de- velops a quarry of knowledge that awaits implementation than the philosopher of science provides the theoretical basis for normal science. Just as the philosopher of science seeks critically to evalu- ate and render intelligible the theoretical basis and activity of science, the social scientist must aim at illuminating the symbolic context that gives meaning to social action. Finally, the analogy advocated here should contribute to disabusing social science of its hope for a monumental theoretical breakthrough in developing universal laws of human behavior modeled on those that have been discovered by natural science. This hope is as vain as would be the hope for a definitive philosophy of science. In seeking a coun- terpart to Galileo, the social scientist would be better advised to look to the social philosopher or social reformer than among his own ranks.66 All forms of social life, not merely science, are paradigmatic, 66 I would suggest that much of the theoretical confusion in social science, in teaching as well as research, is the result of a number of such inappropriate analogies.</page><page sequence="27">PROBLEM OF EXPLANATION 185 and the configuration of intersubjective symbols that comprise a paradigm and that are expressed in actions, institutions, and social relationships constitute social reality and provide "the directly observable data of sociation." 67 Man as a social actor is best under- stood as homo symbolicus, for it is through symbols and the sym- bolic forms of communication which mediate both the individual's and society's encounter with the world, that a virtual reality is created. The modes of action are defined by this symbolic con- struction for "the habits and rules of my thinking limit the possi- bilities of action for me." 68 It is this convergence of symbolic forms that produces what Weber terms a "style of life" or what Wittgenstein refers to as a "form of life," 69 and to ask what social reality is beyond this orientation in whose terms a society organizes itself is meaningless as far as the explanation of behavior on the level of social interaction is concerned. Symbols are not epipheno- mena; they are the phenomena of social investigation. Social ac- tion and the objectified products of action are expressions of ideas about reality and can only be sufficiently explained through an understanding of the symbols presented in both the discursive and nondiscursive languages of social communication wherein social reality is manifest. We cannot now separate the world as we now see it, as a result of the infinitely complicated evolution of our ways of thought and speech as civilized human beings, from the world as it really is, somehow divided into its elements by a 'natural' system of classifi- cation . . . Nature has always been overlaid by, and approached through, a set of social conventions, the conventions of a language in being.70 The acceptance of such a conception of social reality 71 entails «7 Hugh Dalziel Duncan, Communication and Social Order (New York: Bed- minster Press, 1962), pp. xvi-xvii. «8 Stuart Hampshire, Thought and Action (New York: Viking Press, 1960), p. 206. 6» Wittgenstein, op. cit., 226e. to Hampshire, Thought and Action, pp. 39-40. 7i I have elsewhere discussed in greater detail the theory of symbols summarized above.</page><page sequence="28">186 SOCIAL RESEARCH both a significantly different view of explanation and logic of in- quiry than that employed by natural science and a rejection of the deductive model. The search for generalizations either in the sense of general laws of behavior or a system of analytical cate- gories is a misplaced objective.72 To a large extent social explana- tion must be ad hoc,73 since it is directed toward the understand- ing of action in a particular context, and what will count as relevant, both in terms of observation and explanation, will de- pend on that context. This is to suggest not that such explanation is nothing more than a series of historical accounts but that the subject matter requires temporally and spacially limited generali- zations and a continual interaction between social scientific con- structs and social reality in order to avoid conceptual reification. Such a requirement will be viewed as a limitation only if it is as- sumed that the science of physical mechanics must somehow serve as a standard of all explanation. But this is a prodigious and un- warranted assumption. Since the symbolic construction of social reality, and consequently the configurations of social relations which express that reality, are in principle infinite, the vocabulary of social science can never be definitive. The concepts of social science must refer to and reflect, although not necessarily dupli- cate, the symbols operative in social interaction; these concepts refer to a second order reality just as the terms and definitions employed by the philosopher of science must be intimately con- nected with the discourse and the activity of science. The con- cepts, rules, conventions and values through which society creates and organizes its reality, in fine, the symbolic crystal that consti- tutes society as a form of life, must be the starting point of in- quiry, for although the social scientist defines his own problems and utilizes a vocabulary of his own, his concepts insofar as they are explanatory must convey and illuminate the subjective mean- 72 It is worth noting that even if compared with the natural sciences the search for general theories of human behavior or general theories of society appears odd.

The general explanatory constructs employed by the social scientist must be typifications of social reality or intersubjectively shared symbols similar to Weber's ideal types which serve to make the meaning of patterns of action accessible and intelligible.74 Any such view of explanation necessarily raises questions about judging their validity. Although it may be proper in some sense to speak of testing explanations based on the interpretation of ac- tion in a social situation, any attempt to assimilate such tests as those associated with the deductive model that is allegedly char- acteristic of natural science will be misleading. In natural science the idea of a test of an hypothesis or theory usually refers to crucial, well-defined and pre-specified observations, the results of which will be taken either as a falsification or corroboration of a pre- dictive hypothesis or theory. For most explanations of social ac- tion, however, such a formulation tends to be inappropriate be- cause any such appeal to a crucial test often has little meaning, especially where prediction is not in question. It may be more profitable to view the critical assessment of explanations of social action in terms of an analogy with the rational justification of value judgments. One does not usually speak of "testing" a value judgment but rather of providing good reasons for or against its application or validity in a particular context or set of circum- stances. In social science what are often referred to as tests of hypotheses do not refer to predictions and are not strictly de- ductive tests at all, and these "tests" are better understood as sup- porting or challenging reasons, justifications, or evidence directed toward the validity of contextually limited explanations. Ill Much of what has been discussed is inextricably intertwined with two problems that, although alluded to above, demand more explicit treatment because they have been the object of an appar- 74 See Alfred Schutz's elaboration of this perspective in Collected Papers (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1962).</page><page sequence="30">188 SOCIAL RESEARCH ently interminable debate in recent philosophical literature and must be considered in the course of any satisfactory account of the nature of explanation in social science. These are the prob- lems of the knowledge of other minds and of the relationship between mental episodes and action. To suggest that an adequate explanation of social phenomena must refer to symbols is simply another way of stating that such explanations must be on the level of action. The concept of action logically entails reference to symbols and such mentalistic concepts as purpose, intention and motive; to answer the question "why" with regard to an action is to clarify its significance for the actor or actors and to answer the question "what" is to specify a form of symbolic activity such as religion or politics. The con- tention that the proverbial Martian observer unfamiliar with the rules, conventions, and modes of reasoning inherent in a par- ticular social situation could not provide an adequate description and explanation of that situation cannot be dismissed as based on spurious assumptions about the psychological capabilities of extraterrestrial creatures and their ability to formulate hypoth- eses.75 Neither can statements about the meaning of action be viewed as hypothetical limited to the context of discovery and corroborated or falsified by statements referring to sense-data observations, for to redescribe observed behavior and render it intelligible as action requires an elaboration of the symbolic world and principles of conduct assumed by the actor, and no amount of evidence adduced on a logically different level can "verify" such explanations. To explain an action requires a com- prehension of the actor's conception and perception of his situa- tion,76 but the inevitable question must be how is such understand- ing accessible and how can it be brought within the framework of an empirical inquiry? 75 Cf.

If a sufficient explanation of a pattern of action is taken as one that is justified by reference to a symbolic context, the epistemological question of gaining access to individual mental states, and even the metaphysical question of whether minds and mental events as such exist, need not be raised. Yet many of the apparent difficulties revolving around knowledge of mental epi- sodes have been generated by an improper formulation of the problem in terms of a dichotomy between introspectionism and behaviorism and by a failure to clarify the concept of action. The Cartesian conception of the mind as a place containing private mental events and processes describable and explainable in non- physical terms and to which each person has a special access by introspection or an inner faculty, enjoys little currency in con- temporary philosophy. This dualistic view of an individual as both mind and body, the notion that mental concepts necessarily refer to mental entities as opposed to physical language which refers to publicly observable objects and events, and the idea that mental events interact with and causally explain physical behavior were partly the product of a mistaken view about meaning and language. But to reject this position, as well as the idea that knowledge of other minds can be gained only by imaginative reconstruction through analogies with the mind of the observer, requires neither the acceptance of philosophical behaviorism, which either denies the existence of mental episodes altogether or reduces them to physical processes in the brain,77 nor certain formulations of methodological behaviorism which hold that, al- though such episodes may exist, all explanation must be in terms 77 The question of whether mental episodes are identical with physical brain states is a somewhat different problem.

Feyerabend and Grover Maxwell (eds.), Mind, Matter, and Method (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1966), Part I; Wilfrid Sellars, "The Identity Approach to the Mind-Body Problem," and Richard Rorty, "Mind- Body Identity, Privacy, and Categories," in Stuart Hampshire (ed.), Philosophy of Mind (New York: Harper and Row, 1966).</page><page sequence="32">190 SOCIAL RESEARCH of public observations since any such episodes are not open to inspection and cannot form part of a scientific investigation unless operationally defined in terms of overt behavior. The dilemma created by this dichotomy between introspectionism and behavior- ism has been largely the result of a propensity to think of all explanation in terms of cause and effect. For the moment, how- ever, it is enough to demonstrate that both of these attitudes toward mental episodes are untenable, that an acceptance of ex- planations that refer to such episodes and employ mentalistic con- cepts does not necessarily entail introspectionism, and that a re- jection of introspectionism does not require a leap to behaviorism in either of its traditional forms. To accept the existence of such a class of events as mental epi- sodes implies neither that they are logically analogous to physical events nor that they are always or necessarily private, and to un- derstand statements about such episodes as meaningful in a public and intersubjective sense does not require that they be reduced to statements about observable behavior or dispositions.78 There would seem to be no reason why there cannot be perfectly proper categorical statements about mental episodes as long as the mind is not regarded as some mysterious inner substance on which such episodes are predicated. To say that men have minds is not to postulate some invisible entity that explains mental episodes. It is simply another way of saying that men are capable of sym- bolic activity, and to talk of mental episodes is to refer not to a class of occult inner happenings but to symbolic performances. Any claim to knowledge of other minds that is taken as a claim to an infallible introspective access to another's sensations, feel- ings, or thoughts is of course "barking up the wrong gum tree," 79 but it is equally implausible that mental episodes are, or can be, 78 H.

Mental episodes are of course not perceptual objects, but this does not mean that they cannot be objects of knowledge; to say that such episodes are private merely means that they belong to individuals, not that communication about them is impossible; to say that one cannot experience the mental episodes of another person does not mean that one cannot know the conscious states of others in some acceptable sense of the term "know." Thoughts find natural expression in verbal and other forms of activity, and, to the extent to which they do, they become part of a public realm and are intelligible in terms of that realm. But beyond this, the ability to engage in the vari- ous performances understood as speaking and doing, as well as the very capacity to have thoughts at all, whether private or overtly expressed, depends on acquiring an intersubjective symbolic language. In fact, it may be argued that "one can ascribe states of consciousness to one's self only if one can ascribe them to others." 80 The ability to perform actions and make statements presupposes the ability to use a language. To have thoughts, and even perceptions, requires the possession of and ability to use a conceptual apparatus, and although an individual's particular thoughts and impressions are something to which he has, in some sense, a special access and which may or may not be expressed in verbal reports, action, or other symbolic gestures, they are rooted in and presuppose participation in an intersubjective world from which these concepts are derived and in whose terms they are intelligible. Although Wittgenstein has sometimes been construed as deny- ing private mental episodes by his references to intentions as located in a social context, it would seem that, like Weber, he was attempting to demonstrate that the dimension of the mind and references to mental events have meaning only in terms of a realm of public symbols.81 Even Ryle, who would view the mind as so P.

The concepts denoting mental episodes refer no more to phantasma or inscrutable private experiences than do the theoretical concepts that occur in the explanatory language of the natural sciences.83 What is required is that the concept of a person or agent be under- stood as logically primitive and as an "entity such that both predicates ascribing states of consciousness and predicates describ- ing corporeal characteristics . . . are equally applicable," 84 and to be "scientific" puts no such strictures on empirical inquiry as speaking of only sense-data observables. Concepts that refer to mental episodes are appropriately employed in explanations of action despite the fact that such episodes are in a sense private and unobservable, because these concepts are logically part of the language of action; observed activity may be explained by refer- ence to mental episodes because the concept of action implies that "doing" is an expression of such episodes. In regard to social action, explanation requires that it be justified in terms of the symbols and concepts operative in the social situation, and these 82 Gilbert Ryle, The Concept of Mind (New York: Barnes and Noble, 1949). 83 Sellars, "Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind," p. 319; Mrawson, op. ctt., p. 34. 84Strawson, op. cit., pp. 97-98.</page><page sequence="35">PROBLEM OF EXPLANATION 193 symbols which give meaning to action are accessible to empirical investigation. The meaning ascribed to action and speech is not private but public since this meaning is ascribed primarily to an intersubjective social life. My assurance of my own position in the world, and my knowl- edge of other things, develops in this communication and could not conceivably develop except in this social context. To learn to speak and understand a language, as a child, is to enter into a set of social relationships in which my own intentions are con- tinually understood and fulfilled by others and in which I en- counter their corresponding intentions. I learn to describe and to think about things, and to think about my own actions, only because of this interchange and through the social conventions that constitute the use of a language.85 Many of the puzzles about other minds derive from, and ac- cordingly melt away with the rejection of, attempts to describe and explain action in terms of cause and effect. Whatever the source of the assumption that explanations of action must be causal, whether it is the wish to be "scientific," the convention of language whereby in supplying a reason for an action one employs the term "because," or the metaphysical assumption that all events have causes, any thoroughgoing attempt to explain action and the relationship between mental episodes and observed behavior in causal terms, that is, the language of physical events, will necessarily founder and lead to insuperable theoretical prob- lems. Explanations that refer to such factors as purposes, motives, reasons and intentions provide the paradigm case of explanations of human action. The attack on the extension of this general mode of explanation to social science is based on the assumption that such explanations are not empirically relevant since they require the postulation of and reference to unobserved antecedent mental events which function as causes. First of all, it should be clear by now that reference to mental episodes and such factors 85 Hampshire, Thought and Action, p. 89.

But it is equally important to demonstrate that although causal explanations can be given for such behavior as bodily movements, redescription of such events as actions involves a data language different from that used in explaining physical processes and a mode of explanation in which causes as antecedent events have no logical place.86 Ideas, thoughts, desires, motives, intentions, purposes and reasons, function differently in explanations of actions, sometimes designating kinds of explanations and some- times designating factors in explanations; 87 and recent philo- sophical analysis has contributed much to clarifying the logical status of such concepts, but they cannot be treated as referring to antecedent causes. The intuitive appeal of the idea that thoughts are somehow causes of action is considerable since ordinary language condones speaking of ideas, beliefs, and the like in this sense, and there is no necessity for eliminating the word "cause" from explanations of action, either in ordinary language or social science, as long as care is taken not to allow such use unreflectively to lead to an inappropriate logic of explanation. To treat beliefs and inten- tions as causes of action in the sense of prior events or, like meth- odological individualism, to view statements about mental epi- sodes as premises in a deductive argument in terms of which particular instances of behavior can be explained and predicted is a further attempt to save the symmetry thesis.88 There is no doubt that Weber, in his attempt to reconcile verstehen with what he understood as the requirements of an empirical science 86 For a detailed defense of purpose-explanations and a critique of behaviorism in psychology see Charles Taylor, The Explanation of Behavior (New York: Human- ities Press, 1964). 87 Alan R. White, The Philosophy of Mind (New York: Random House, 1967), p. 135. ss Methodological individualism as a thesis about the explanation of social action has been most persistently defended by J. W. N. Watkins. For one example of his statement of this position and an answer to some of the critics see "Historical Explanation in the Social Sciences," in Gardiner, op. cit.</page><page sequence="37">PROBLEM OF EXPLANATION 195 and in his discussion of "causally adequate" explanations and the corroboration of subjective understanding by statistical regular- ities involves himself to some degree in this kind of conceptual confusion, that is, postulating subjective meaning and observed behavior as causally related events and treating ideal types as restricted general laws.89 This difficulty is continually apparent in much of contemporary social science which still appears to accept a naive interactionist's view of thought and action, espe- cially in its attempts to establish causal relationships between attitudes and behavior. Once it is realized that what is involved here is the confusion of two levels of discourse and explanation and that the logic of explaining an event as an action is different from the logic of explaining it as a physical movement, the prob- lem can be solved. To reject the idea that mental episodes are internal events causing actions or external events, either in the sense of physical interaction or the Humean notion of observed regularities, need not mean a rejection of explanations referring to such episodes. Mentalistic concepts are an integral aspect of the description of an action; in describing and explaining an action, something addi- tional or different is involved than in describing and explaining bodily movements. Actions cannot be broken down and analyzed into cause and effect in the sense of internal events causing external behavior. To refer to the cause of an action is to refer to an agent who brings it about, not to an antecedent thought; mental events do not ' 'cause" anything although they feature as factors in the explanation of an action. An action, as distinct from a physical movement, does not require an explanation in terms of something else to make it intelligible. Where physical move- ments are present, we may be able to speak of action but not in the same language, for to explain an action is to provide the meaning that makes it intelligible or the reasons for which it was performed and of which it is an expression, and the meaning 89 Weber, op. cit., pp. 99-100.

This in no way rules out discussion of the context or conditions of an action, but correla- tions between contexts and actions cannot substitute for explana- tions. Social scientists too often fall into the trap of believing that "science" carries some inherent demand that purposes either be treated as causes or excluded from empirical explanations.90 But attempts to treat symbols and beliefs as variables only lead to such Scheinproblems as the question of whether ideology is the cause of certain modes of action or whether it is caused by certain patterns of social relationships. Behavior which is to be understood as action must be viewed not as an effect caused by a mental episode but as the expression of such an episode. Actions are logically linked to mental episodes, and this means simply that reference to mentalistic concepts is necessary for the description of an action and a sufficient explana- tion of it. The logical link is somewhat the same as that between a value judgement and the ethical principle or decision on which it is based. This does not mean that mental episodes cannot occur independently of or temporally prior to an action, but because the formulation of an intention, for example, is temporally prior does not mean that it can be treated as a cause analogous to an event in a physical process. When the explanation of an action is required, the cause, in a strict sense, is already known, that is, the agent; what is required is the meaning or the symbols that the action expresses. Although there might be some sense in which one could speak of intentions as causes, it has nothing to do with a general causal theory of action; it is not an explanation of how action takes place but only a specification of what is meant by an action and how it is distinguished from other forms of behavior. This thesis may be further clarified by stating that mental episodes relate to action in a way similar to the relation between spoken words and meanings.91 Speaking and doing are performances to be explained, and the explanation of an action »o Dahl, "Cause and Effect in the Study of Politics," pp. 76-77. 9i Maclntyre, op. cit., p. 51.</page><page sequence="39">PROBLEM OF EXPLANATION 197 is not a matter of providing a cause any more than to give the meaning of the word is to give its cause. The cause of speech and action is the agent, but for both speech and action, which are symbolic gestures, to explain is to give the meaning. Either speaking may be understood as a species of symbolic action, or action may be understood as a form of symbolic language, but to explain such performances is to supply the meaning, and the meaning is not a separable event but a logical aspect of one per- formance. In a social situation, when it is possible to point to the concepts or symbols that within a particular context would justify observed action and make it intelligible, an adequate and sufficient explanation has been presented although any such explanation is always corrigible. There is no need either to condemn the use of the term "cause" in explanations of action or to rule out defining explanations referring to purposes and reasons as a form of causal explanation as long as both the Humean sense of cause is avoided and the endeavor does not lead to conceptual confusion or constitute an attempt to assimilate social explanation to the model of physical explanation. But even those who wish to salvage the concept of cause and apply it to explanations of action are forced to admit that such an undertaking requires considerable ' 'redeployment " of this concept.92 Although it may be true that everyday language demonstrates that "cause" and such terms as "reason" and "pur- pose" are used interchangeably, we do not speak of the causes of the doings or the actions of per- sons in the way in which we speak of the causes of the movements of wheels in a machine or of the fibers in one's muscles, but of what causes a person to do this or that, or of the causes he has for so acting.93 Finally, it is necessary to add that arguments against causal 92 D.

Dommeyer (ed.), Current Philosophical Issues (Springfield: Charles C. Thomas, 1966), p. 128.</page><page sequence="40">explanations of action, which attempt to reduce explanations of action to the fact that "man is a rule-following animal" or "inten- tional' ' animal, are too restrictive.94 Rules and intentions as well as purposes, reasons, values, principles and motives, may all be necessary aspects of the language of action-explanation, but they are derivative and encompassed by the conception of man as homo symbolicus or the fact that his actions gain meaning only in rela- tion to an intersubjective symbolic context. The relationship between action and symbolization is one of mutual entailment. To ascribe one implies the ascription of the other; to ascribe the capability of acting requires the ascription of the ability to use symbols, not merely to form intentions and perform in accord- ance with rules. Without the idea of man as a symbol-creating and symbol-using animal, the concept of action as differentiated from other forms of behavior would lose all meaning. IV Although the issues discussed in this essay have not been di- rectly related to the problem of defining politics and the subject matter of political science, at least a tentative answer to this prob- lem may be given from the perspective that has been developed. Few political scientists would argue for the autonomy of political science or its differentiation from sociology and the other social sciences on the basis of a particular method or mode of explana- tion. Although some have maintained that method should be the "bond" of the discipline,95 it would seem that the social sci- 94 R. S.

Yet although it is commonly accepted that divisions within the social sciences must be, or should be, dis- tinguished by more than simply traditional concerns and his- torical accident and must be justified on the basis of subject mat- ter and problems, the search for such justifications of what is distinctly political has been largely a futile one. There are at least two significant reasons for this. First, scholars are not happy about any restrictive definitions of the subject matter that bar them from what they as individuals believe are interesting prob- lems, and second, and more important, the debate about subject matter has, as I have repeatedly stressed, been conducted on the level of definitions rather than in terms of informing philosophi- cal assumptions about social reality. Behind the search for defi- nitions lies the premise that I have attempted to refute: the belief that the specification of the political is essentially a function of an instrumental analytical construct. If this assumption should be correct, then the problem of definition that political scientists set for themselves is necessarily an insoluble one, and political sci- ence must ultimately be a matter of dealer's choice. I would submit, however, that it is not, or should not, be a matter of dealer's choice any more than the philosopher of science may analytically and arbitrarily isolate on an a priori basis what he wishes from the corpus of human thought and action and designate it as science. What I am suggesting is that politics is a relatively concrete and identifiable phenomenon, a distinctive symbolic form of life with a distinguishable history. This does not imply an essentialist outlook or an assumption that politics does not change any more than the assumption that science re- mains uniform. When the symbols and concepts of science and politics change, these activities change accordingly. Nor does it</page><page sequence="42">200 SOCIAL RESEARCH imply that the social scientist should not be critical of the direc- tion that politics takes any more than the philosopher of science should remain aloof from evaluating trends of theory and prac- tice in the scientific community. What it does imply, however, is that politics is not a theoretical creation of the observer in the way that physical reality is essentially a theoretical creation of the scientist. When politics is constituted analytically there are two dangers. First, the construction may be so narrow as to miss what may be significant and /or it may fail to take account of changes in political symbolization as is so apparent in the study of American politics today. Second, in an attempt to overcome cultural boundaries, the subject matter may be constituted so abstractly and broadly that, as appears to be the case in many comparative studies, it is found everywhere both spatially and historically from highland Burma to ancient Egypt. The result in both cases is to make the concept of the political meaningless in any explanatory sense and useful only as a tool of classification, and consequently one loses a grip on the very thing that one seeks to make intelligible. To argue, as I would, that politics and political symbolization had a definite historical beginning and is essentially an aspect of Western culture will inevitably invite the charge of provincial- ism and exacerbate the previously mentioned uneasiness about undue restrictions on the political scientist's field of investigation. But the diffusion and transformation of political symbols and political life in the modern age as well as the need for comparing political and non-political forms of life would seem to open suffi- cient avenues of research. To maintain that it makes little sense to use the term "political" for anything but a classificatory purpose in discussing many primitive, ancient, or non- Western societies may be met with incredulity, but to apply the concept of the political as an a priori premise of empirical investigation, as is the practice today, is reminiscent of the early anthropologist who started out armed with concepts derived from his own symbolic world and made such mistakes as believing that ancient myth</page><page sequence="43">PROBLEM OF EXPLANATION 201 was primitive science. Contemporary social scientists engaged in comparative research often are guilty of simply a more sophisti- cated version of the same fallacy. Ethnocentrism is not over- come by creating highly abstracted constructs from limited his- torical experience and turning these back to explain a world in which they are not phenomenally grounded. Although there may be no ultimate right or wrong use of words, it is necessary to distinguish between the classificatory and explanatory use of concepts, and it is gravely misleading to speak of politics in a society where there is no tradition of political symbols and no such differentiated mode of thought and action. It is fatuous to assume that politics is a necessary and universal aspect of social existence or that it is meaningful, in an explanatory sense, to refer to anything as political that appears to be a functional equivalent. It has been a long while since anyone has taken seriously the Kantian thesis that Western time is a necessary category of apper- ception, yet political scientists seem to persist in the view that politics is a necessary category of life.</page></plain_text>
