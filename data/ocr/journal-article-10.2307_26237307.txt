<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> SaRah wymaN Beyond the Veil Indeterminacy­and­Iconoclasm­in­the­Art­of­Robert­Hayden,­ Janet­Kozachek,­and­Tom­Feelings     i. Robert Hayden employs innovative modes of signification to unveil and expose  race- based violence in the United States. In “Night, Death, Mississippi” (1966) he  defies bildverbot1 traditions, or the customary injunction against representing the  sacred or, in secular times, the secret. This policy pertains to what must not be  shown because it lies beyond the reach of representation (traditionally, God or the  Shoah) and also applies to what must not be shown because its portrayal under- mines hegemonic ideologies that maintain and naturalize systems of oppression  (as in the phenomena of lynching and slavery). Some topics are designated un- speakable, “beyond the veil,” or simply lack first- hand witnesses. Yet, this barred  access or knowledge gap due to iconoclastic tendencies in the culture does not in- hibit a poet accustomed to poetry’s mode of meaning by indirection. While we live  in a time of relative freedom of speech and expression, vestiges of the prohibition  against depicting unrepresentable subject matter have led writers and artists to seek  alternate aesthetic strategies that insist on historical and contemporary realities  even as they dismantle conventional realism.  Hayden’s innovative portrayal of the ostensibly obscene (ob scaena) matter of a  death by lynching works according to ambiguous modes that depend on the ma- teriality of the medium (language), rather than the materiality of the desecrated  body itself. By treating language as a revelatory concrete substance—a clay of  sounds, a stack of stanzas, a shifting web of syntax ruled and unruled—Hayden  calls attention to his creative activity, and by extension, to the hidden or forbidden  subject matter as well. Thus, the medium’s material qualities anchor the poem as  does the space/time referent: Mississippi, U.S.A., in the mid 1960s. From this fixed  point, the poet then raises metaphysical questions about society and human suf- fering. In defiance of restrictions against using art to signify certain categories of  experience, Hayden tears away the rhetorical veil that falls over episodes too ter- rible to recount (to use a common collocation from slave narratives), employing a  poetics of indeterminacy that both tempers and intensifies the truth with its rhe- 263 </page> <page sequence="2"> torical power. The poet’s insistence on the subject matter, examining a generalized  episode of a recurring event, serves as a call to witness for both those who follow  his line of vision and those who avert their eyes. Dispersing perspective among at  least four entities, Hayden offers a polyphony of internal and articulated voices that  stage a quasi- narrative spanning past, present and future experience, both actual  and imaginary.  The trope of the veil occupies a central position in U.S. literary history, due in  part to the ways W. E. B. Du Bois uses it in The Souls of Black Folk (1903) as a sign of  mourning, an instrument of separation or concealment, and a marker of prophecy.  Werner Sollors explicates Old Testament references to demonstrate the metaphor’s  function to “separate Afro-A mericans from American culture at large but also  [to give] them a more profound vision and higher destiny” (49; qtd. in Gates and  Oliver xxviii): Du Bois imaginatively adapted two biblical images of the veil as a division  within the Temple [Exodus 26.33] and as the cover that the divinely inspired  Moses wore when he came back from Mount Sinai and spoke to the people  [Exodus 34.33–35]. (49) Hayden transposes this metaphoric configuration into an aesthetic strategy as he  writes “Night, Death, Mississippi,” using language to obscure and reveal in delicate  tones of lament that ultimately solidify the protest nature of his poem.  Hayden twice evokes the notion of iconoclasm, literally “the breaking of icons,”  in his essays on Harlem Renaissance-e ra activism (Prose 46) and on later aesthetic  innovations (“Recent Poetry” 69). According to Hayden, Harlem Renaissance art- ists shattered inauthentic images of the Black experience, asserting their own new  depictions in place of old stereotypes.2 In a classic example, Alain Locke attempts  to reject the received image of the Old Negro, one that “never existed except as a  White fiction” (Hatcher 58). He replaces this demeaning depiction with a radical  (verboten / forbidden) and complex image of the New Negro in The New Negro: An  Interpretation (1925). Locke explains, “The Old Negro, we must remember, was a  creature of moral debate and historical controversy. He has been a stock figure per- petrated as an historical fiction partly in innocent sentimentalism, partly in delib- erate reactionism” (693). In similar fashion, Hayden puts forth an alternate image  of the lynched African American man, deconstructing the received type promoted  in popular culture.  Hayden perhaps follows Jean Toomer’s innovations in Cane (1923) as well,  staging new depictions of a crossover U.S. culture.3 The radical import of Toomer’s  brilliant theatrical approach—collaging many styles, perspectives, poetic registers,  and voices—was not fully acknowledged or appreciated until the time of the Black  Arts Movement in the 1960s. “Night, Death, Mississippi” resembles the poetry from  264 The CompaRaTiST 36 : 2012 </page> <page sequence="3"> Cane’s second section by employing anti- lyrical devices of modernism including,  “dissonance, disjunction, and visual imagery” (Ford 6). While both Hayden and  Toomer would distance themselves from Locke’s and Langston Hughes’ essential- izing approach to Blackness during the 1920s, they certainly committed themselves  to a parallel project of destroying old, inauthentic images of African-A mericans,  and offered instead their own versions of a hybrid culture, “the result of intricate  interplay between African American cultural styles and white American institu- tions” (Farebrother 514). The politically charged, composite image- sign Hayden  creates in “Night, Death, Mississippi” destroys stereotypical tropes (icons) of North  American identity even as it depicts a deracinated aesthetic reality. Hayden boldly  asserts his fairly cryptic message against censoring or bildverbot impulses and in- junctions in the society at large.  The politics of both breaking images, iconoclasm, and forbidding the construc- tion of new ones in the bildverbot tradition, are one legacy of the medieval con- troversies in the West and in Byzantium that bring to the fore the rhetorical and  seductive power of the graven image. Struggles over the provenance of the image  tended to follow lines of inter-e thnic discord. As a man who refused to identify as a  Black poet, Hayden was keenly aware of the impact of verbal/visual identity- images  in his life and in his art. His dismissal of ethnic categories despite his celebration  of African- American realities not only recapitulates Toomer’s strategy, but signals  as well a recognition of discursive practices that compromise Black identity, and  by extension, well- being. Debates involving the role of images in medieval culture  went beyond concerns about educating and indoctrinating the illiterate masses  or threatening the spiritual, other- worldly focus of the church. A theologically-  based assault on the Christian icon or graven images in general usually masked  the anti- Muslim and anti-S emetic political platforms that actually motivated these  policies.4 The legacy of iconoclastic and bildverbot practices offers a critical lens  through which to evaluate the policing of representation, including the case of de- picting racially motivated crime.  Two North American paintings by Janet Kozachek and Tom Feelings serve as  companion pieces to Hayden’s poem. As in Hayden’s work, they demonstrate the  fact that while all objects and activities are subject to representation at some level,  some events are better represented via absence or ambiguity than presence. Read  against “Night, Death, Mississippi,” these paintings highlight powerful aspects of  Hayden’s experimental work. Like Hayden’s poem, each foregrounds its medium  (paint / ink), emphasizing its own artificiality as a representation, while referencing  concrete fact. The artists treat the theme of violence enigmatically, employing the  figure of the cross, not as a Christian symbol, but rather as a material foundation,  a supporting structure from which to invite a philosophical response. This loaded  symbol participates in an underlying grid structure, as Rosalind Krauss would   Beyond the Veil 265 </page> <page sequence="4"> have it, insisting on the materiality of the victim’s (absent) body while asserting  metaphysical messages. Kozachek’s painting Roadside Effigy (1995) (Figure 1) does  not employ human perspective beyond that of the artist’s vision, yet its enigmatic,  draped cross and its memorialization of a generalized event relate to Hayden’s ex- periments in narrative focalization. In Tom Feelings’ image of a captive and cap- tors on a slave ship from The Middle Passage: White Ships / Black Cargo (1995)  (Figure 2), the artist denatures difference between black and white in a type of  deposition scene, with the ship’s grid-l ike rigging as a geometric backdrop.  Each of these works, like Hayden’s poem, deals with violence cast in sacred  terms of sacrifice. The substance of the act—a racially prompted murder—remains  off- stage, rhetorically veiled in the bildverbot tradition. Both the unpictured event  and the missing body, then, correspond in Lacanian terms to the real itself, or to  that which language cannot contain.5 Consequently, each work also serves as a call  to witness, relying on the human impulse to fill that lack. The aesthetic motivation  becomes infused with a sense of longing or yearning that may or may not be spiri- tual in nature. The power- inflected subject matter itself renders each expression  politically charged, for, in Raymond Geuss’ terms, “to talk about politics is to do  politics.” Each of these expressions, in words or in images, testifies to an episode of  violence in aesthetically rich terms that draw in the reader/viewer despite any urge  to turn away from the horrifying subject matter.  The attempt to police depictions of traumatic subject matter creates a space in  which identities can be transgressively represented by means of indirection. Thus,  one poet and two painters contribute to trauma discourse in which the crisis both  centers the work and escapes direct representation. Their innovative approaches  recall the iconoclastic efforts and prophetic nature of early modernism, as new  techniques of indeterminacy and defamiliarization replaced clichéd modes of rep- resentation. Yet each artist enacts the contemporary longing for the lost referent  by staging a search for the dishonored body. Their works foreground the medium  and insist upon an overt constructedness of the verbal/visual object that references  the real world tragedies they engage. Each work thus maintains an internal logic  based on structures of meaning. Nevertheless, the external relationship between  each work as a physical object- in-t he-w orld (with its contingencies lodged in both  historical fact and in time/space- specific events of creation and reception), merits  equal emphasis to demonstrate Hayden’s connection to the 1950s transformative  resurgence of avant- garde tendencies.  “Night, Death, Mississippi” demonstrates what Edward Pavlic has described  as Hayden’s historically contingent confrontation with modernism. According to  Pavlic, “Hayden’s artistic vision achieves a depth of perception from which the divi- sions that inform oppositional politics become unstable” (534). While reverent of  T. S. Eliot and William Butler Yeats, Hayden expands aesthetic and social parame- 266 The CompaRaTiST 36 : 2012 </page> <page sequence="5"> ters of concern in a more comprehensive way, one that I argue allies him closely (if  never completely) with the avant- gardes of the 1950s and 60s.6 Coining the term  “post- traditional” to define Hayden’s symbolist work, Brian Conniff has expertly  delineated the poet’s relation to high modernism, arguing that, “Hayden was able to  challenge the modernists’ sense of social crisis and give voice to his personal doubts  about modernism’s moral limitations” (490). Jim Murphy cites Hayden’s widely an- thologized “Middle Passage” (1944) as operating from a modernist avant- garde (111)  that I find even more convincing in the Mississippi poem in question. By analyzing  the complex stylistic choices employed in “Night, Death, Mississippi” and com- paring the poem to other expressions of similar subject matter in word and image,  I demonstrate the poet’s affinities with the forerunners of artistic experimentation  in mid-c entury America. Hayden’s style as it intersects with political issues demon- strates a truly innovative approach allied to the Négritude writers he admired and  to the Black Arts Movement from which he was contentiously estranged.  Hayden’s elegiac poem7 is a stylistically innovative work that references a pre- cise historical moment by radically defamiliarizing a traumatic episode. The poet  both obscures and reveals aspects of a ritualized lynching as though veiling and  displaying elements of the human condition itself. His exquisite diction and musi- cality create images of layered meaning while the cadences of the free verse lines  work deftly on the reader’s ear. In part one, a beastly old father vicariously enjoys  his son’s murder of a man, then participates in the aftermath of the act. In part two,  lines of elevated religious lament break in to mourn the martyred victim.8 The  ambiguous style, combining multiple perspectives, differing poetic registers, and  modes of unspoken communication, mimics the avoidance urge of those called  to witness such atrocities. The verbal equivalent of a grid structure emphasizes the  deviation from linear narrative and a foundational structure from which to launch  metaphysical questions.  The poem, then, as representation as well as refusal to represent, becomes a po- litical statement about a historically specific U.S. phenomenon and a meditation on  the perpetuation of human violence. The victim’s body, an index of the traumatic  event, is paradoxically nowhere to be seen and everywhere present. As in contem- poraneous art works by Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, the body itself is  “figured by absence” (Jones 653). A lover of modern art in all its forms, Hayden  would have been familiar with these aesthetic strategies of negative representation  via silence, absence, and, in George Steiner’s terms, linguistic devaluation and de- humanization.9 The loss or lack in Hayden’s violent terms participates in trauma  discourse10 in which “the subject is evacuated and elevated at once” (Foster 168;  Lyotard). As a marker of the ostensibly sacred, the represented body—or the real— becomes an illusory presence within the space and time of the poem referencing  more than 3,446 recorded lynchings between the beginning of Reconstruction   Beyond the Veil 267 </page> <page sequence="6"> (1882) and 1968. In the poem’s visual manifestations, the human form, if depicted  at all, achieves a sense of detachment, a deflation of the expected intimacy between  martyr and viewer, through strategies of de-i ndividuation or outright absence.  Hayden’s, Kozachek’s, and Feelings’ works gesture towards the modernist legacy  in this country, yet clearly break away from it as well, treating subject matter be- yond the purview of high modernism, or the many avant- gardes that attended it.  Each work critiques institutionalized violence by figuring hate crime as an expres- sion of a culturally precipitated historical reality. Each piece tests conventional  limits by both exposing and estranging customarily veiled topics, inviting the  reader to simultaneously bear witness and respond critically. Stylistic intricacies in  these highly symbolic representations elaborate an arguably minimalist selection  of details rendered in foregrounded media of language and paint.11 The artists thus  draw upon avant-g arde devices of the 1910s and 20s including the flattened pic- ture plane of the collage, the modernist grid structure, and the overtly constructed  object. They also participate in Peter Bürger’s somewhat romantic project for this  early movement, re-i njecting art into the social praxis, or returning art from the  élitist museum to the masses.12  Yet these three works do so by operating within the juncture between art and  life as redefined in terms of the neo- avant-g arde13 that arose in the 1950s and 1960s  in the U.S. They participate in a reaction against expressionism and in a rejection  of the highly personalized confessional mode. Works such as Hayden’s, Kozachek’s,  and Feelings’ shift the focus from the poet/artist’s expression to the reader’s re- ception, conditioned as it is by culture, contingent as it is upon particular points  in space and time.14 The effects prove disorienting and intellectually provocative,  as familiar events are “recoded in terms of resistant or alternative articulations of  the artistic and the political” (Foster xvi). Hayden not only represents the hidden  crime: ritual execution outside the legal system; he portrays it from the perspective  of the white lyncher himself. Kozachek conflates recognizable Christian symbolism  with unholy sacrifice in a mode that deconstructs the precepts of Abstract Expres- sionism. Feelings documents the brutality of slave-s hip suffering in a children’s pic- ture book, folding shackled bodies in fetal positions.  The formal structure of each art- sign, the constitution of the subject as contin- gent or even absent, the emphasis on audience, and the degree of cultural critique  involved links these works to both Minimalist and Conceptual art. Instead of pro- posing a postmodern opposition between art and life, these works continue the co-  articulation of the artistic and political that is so fundamental to the avant-g arde  project (Foster 5). According to Foster, the false dichotomy between art and life  intrinsic to postmodernism “cede[s] to art the autonomy that is in question and  position[s] life at a point beyond reach” (15). Foster insists that the artist’s project  268 The CompaRaTiST 36 : 2012 </page> <page sequence="7"> is instead to “sustain a tension between art and life, not somehow to reconnect the  two” (16). Hayden, Kozachek and Feelings inhabit a gap between art and life, styl- izing their expressions in anti- realist ways, yet insisting upon real world referents  more palpable indeed than the nostalgic shadows of meaning most poststructural- ists would allow.  Consider the way Hayden’s arguably geometric text engages the voices and views  of an old man reminiscing over his own lynching days, his son who perpetuates  ritual killings in the present, and the mother/wife involved in the violence. Look  for disembodied traces of the castrated victim,15 and consider the elegiac refrain  that serves as a counterpoint to the main anti- narrative. The very indeterminacy of  Hayden’s signifying, the uncertainty as to what exactly we are seeing and hearing,  takes this poem beyond the fragmentary shifting perspective of high modernism,  beyond the challenging innovations of the early twentieth- century avant-g ardes,  into a realm both material and transcendent. Night, Death, Mississippi I A quavering cry. Screech- owl? Or one of them? The old man in his reek and gauntness laughs— One of them, I bet— and turns out the kitchen lamp, limping to the porch to listen in the windowless night. Be there with Boy and the rest if I was well again. Time was. Time was. White robes like moonlight In the sweetgum dark. Unbucked that one then and him squealing bloody Jesus as we cut it off. Time was. A cry? A cry all right. He hawks and spits, fevered as by groinfire.  Beyond the Veil 269 </page> <page sequence="8"> Have us a bottle, Boy and me— he’s earned him a bottle— when he gets home. II Then we beat him, he said, beat him till our arms was tired and the big old chains messy and red. O Jesus burning on the lily cross Christ, it was better than hunting bear which don’t know why you want him dead. O night, rawhead and bloodybones night You kids fetch Paw some water now so’s he can wash that blood off him, she said. O night betrayed by darkness not its own (1962, 1966)  Hayden’s intricate stylistic choices call attention to the medium of language  itself. The poet foregrounds the literariness of his expression,16 a base from which  to pose metaphysical questions about human nature. Words and phrases call atten- tion to themselves as artful utterances rather than clear- message vessels. For ex- ample, he opens his poem with the prelude of a “quavering cry.” The onomatopoetic  adjective, combining the words quiver and waver, connotes both a tremulous voice  and a musical shake or trill, setting the scene at a high emotional level. The allit- erative collocation insists upon etymological considerations and retards easy con- sumption of the signified sound- image.  The indeterminacy of Hayden’s poetic mode allows him to yolk together victim  and victimizer so that distinctions between them dissolve. Both are disfigured by  the brutality,17 and words adrift could be attributed to either one. The poem is ini- tially focalized through the ill and aged father, horribly corrupted by his involve- ment in this violent activity. Surprisingly enough, the poet thus engages the oppres- sor’s perspective as persona in order to destabilize illusions of ethnic difference,  even as he tempts reductive categories of good and evil. The patriarch’s gauntness  270 The CompaRaTiST 36 : 2012 </page> <page sequence="9"> draws him as thin and angular, but also connotes the hungry, greedy, and ravenous  nature that make him a hunter of men, a carnivorous animal who “hawks and spits”  (l. 19), suggesting the bird of prey. His limping, starved appearance recalls Hay- den’s Bahá’í–faith-b ased view of human downfall in the inability to love, an almost  physical lack.18 The old man’s reek evokes not only the smell and smoke of destruc- tion, but also the scent of blood freshly shed. Reek also refers to the whirl of fine  particles of snow, thus foreshadowing the image of the Ku Klux Klan robes (l. 12).  The white of this cloth, as of the lily cross, connotes no innocent good, but rather  human brutality; thus Hayden inverts the traditional symbolism of light and dark.  The poet also compares the lynching victim to animals, through the old man’s  perspective. The black man is a snared buck and a baited bear (an image tradition- ally compared to the crucified Christ). If the squeal belongs to him—this too is un- certain—he recalls one of Claude McKay’s cornered pigs in “If We Must Die.” The  act of castration, described as unbucking, denotes stealing his phallus, the meto- nymic (strangely fetishized) representation of his human power as a man. The old  man’s male virility, indicated by his neologic groinfire fever (l. 20), indicates a de- structive force. The woman, in contrast, encourages, but does not act.  The intense but enigmatic visuality of the first section contrasts significantly with  the more prosy commentary of the second section in which the event is reported  or possibly remembered by the old man. Initially, the poet manages to evade both  the iconic and indexical modes of representation with such abstracting images as  the “windowless night” (l. 8) and the “sweetgum dark” (l. 13). While the first signifies  negatively, evoking a window whilst cancelling it out, the second signifies a concept  that defies literal explanation yet suggests an easy combination of a fragrant, pun- gent southern tree and a night setting. The night that began as “sweetgum dark” be- comes colored reddish brown like the tree, with blood on brown skin. This wood,  often used as a cheap substitute for mahogany, suggests that the night may not be as  it first appears. These nearly negligible details are important in tracing Hayden’s open  modes of signification that tie him to aesthetic trends of both the early twentieth-  century and the 1950s. While he referred to himself as a Romantic Realist (Prose 115),  and noted his affinities with leaders of the Négritude movement (inspired by Baude- laire’s symbolic legacy), Hayden’s commitment to wrenching the signifier from the  signified, to letting the words float free of exact referents, links him most clearly to  Arthur Rimbaud.19 Scraps of diegetic content in stanzas two, four, and seven are  layered with strangely mimetic details in which he stages scenes as isolated moments  defying narrative, a backdrop to the central event happening elsewhere. Only the  historical reference, in conjunction with cultural knowledge, can contextualize the  poetic expression so that it becomes a politically engaged work of art.  The musicality of the language, including its carefully accented rhythms, adds  another dimension to the strategies of reifying language and signifying indetermi-  Beyond the Veil 271 </page> <page sequence="10"> nately. Lines in iambic dimeter hook the reader as the most normal speech pattern  in English carries the most devastating messages: “a cry all right,” “wash that blood,”  “you want him dead.” The repeated spondee “Time was” slows the rhythm and lulls  the intensity of the surrounding action with ironic calm. The phrase refers both to  past time the old man fondly remembers and to present time transpiring as the old  man awaits his son’s return. The strong beat on the normally weak copulative was  emphasizes the possibilities of its multiple meanings.20  The poet comments on this alternate signifying system, based on sonic features  or sound- images: I hear my lines as I write them. I’m almost as much concerned with the way my  poems sound as I am with what they say. I think of the two elements interacting.  I’m sensitive to the textures, weights of words, to vowel and consonant values.  I’ll allow a poem to have harsh sounds—dissonances—if they contribute to the  effect I’m after. (“The Poet and His Art” 145) Hayden foregrounds the aural qualities of language in order to intensify his overall  message, much the way Janet Kozachek will dial up the tonalities of her painting  to call attention to its very constructedness, to its autonomous being as art, or as  Feelings will forge patterns on a radically reduced tonal plane to rival the thematic  content.  The merging of narrative levels, perspectives, and identities in the poem, as well  as the lack of racial tags creates a situation in which the unmistakable depiction of  a violent incident comes to signify broader realities of the human condition. This  strategy of negative representation, or producing meaning by not signifying, dif- ferentiates Hayden’s aesthetics from those of earlier high modernist writers. As the  poet explains, “A poem is built on silences as well as on sounds. And it imposes a  silence audible as a laugh, a sigh, a groan” (“How It Strikes a Contemporary” 13).  The dynamic of granting and denying access to the referenced activity—a  lynching—and the moral imperatives implied in the bivalent display of this act— you must look/look away—save the poem from the literary propaganda Hayden  loathed (Prose 173) and prove the possibility of a protest poetry of subtle technique  and remarkable power. Thus, the trope of seeing versus not seeing, of present time  versus imaginative memory, creates a tension within the poem between concrete  and abstract realities. Consequently, the poem insists upon the physical body as  the site of suffering and also raises existential questions about cognitive patterns  perpetuated through familial legacies. As Edward Pavlic explains, “racial hatred  here encodes and sustains [familial and cultural] bonds” (547). Thus, the structural  destablization of language contributes to a temporal ambiguity: time may be im- mediate, or it may be remembered. This suggests the genealogical transmission of  violent tendencies through family history. 272 The CompaRaTiST 36 : 2012 </page> <page sequence="11">  Hayden may well have taken a cue from the hundreds of slave narratives that  were seeing new light in the public eye around the time he wrote his poem. W. J. T.  Mitchell has emphasized the dominant rhetorical feature of these works as descrip- tive, presented as an assemblage of scenes and sketches (185). Early readers of these  reports (written, for the most part retrospectively, post- slavery) expected a level of  realism posed in terms of transparent windows or reliable mirrors.21 In contrast to  a skeptical nineteenth- century Northern public in need of evidence, Hayden deals  with an enlightened audience, fully aware of the phenomenon of hate crime, yet  reluctant to address the issue directly. Hayden seems to play with mimetic conven- tions, offering instead an (absent) window obscured by complications of memory  and removal, suggesting the lack of clarity surrounding the crime and its motives.  Davis and Gates emphasize the need for these slavery-e ra readers to be “oracularly  convinced” by naturalistic renditions of anecdotes, offered up by first- hand wit- nesses (9; qtd. in Mitchel 185). Hayden, however, working at least a century later,  knows the power of a story’s gaps, the veiled material deemed unrepresentable,  often by the formerly enslaved or currently endangered Americans themselves. In- stead of describing the gruesome details of the event directly, he mediates them  through various perspectives, and allows for the dynamic of resistance within the  unsaid.  While the victim’s body and voice exist only ambiguously in the poem, his  humanity as a presence destroyed rivets the work to an unmistakably real time and  place in U.S. history (Bernstein). Medgar Evers was assassinated in 1963; “Freedom  Summer” activists James Chaney, Michael Schwerner and Andrew Goodman  were killed the following year. Chaney was African- American; Schewerner and  Goodman were Caucasian and Jewish. Men murdered the child Emmett Till a de- cade earlier in the same state of Mississippi. The poetic voice detaches itself from  limiting details of identity in order to achieve a level of intimacy with the victim,  inversely proportional to the degree to which he resembles identifiable figures.  Due to this commitment to iconoclastic renderings of historic “truths,” Hayden  allied himself with the poets and artists of the early twentieth-c entury, rather than  the so- called innovators of the 1950s and 60s with whom he shared a generational  identity. The truly iconoclastic writers, in Hayden’s opinion, were those working  thirty years earlier, during the Harlem Renaissance. These were the writers and art- ists engaged in the destruction of images concealing and condoning the institution- alized attack on Black lives. Hayden describes the artistic and political awakening  of African- Americans as, partly inspired by the iconoclastic spirit of the times. The Harlem writers and  artists were, like their white counterparts, in quest of new images, forms, tech- niques. They too were skeptical and disillusioned. What chiefly differentiated   Beyond the Veil 273 </page> <page sequence="12"> them, however, was their view of artistic endeavor as an extension of the struggle  against oppression. (Prose 46) If the avant- garde poets and artists of the ‘teens and ’20s (Césaire, Senghor, Damas,  Cullen, McKay, Picasso, Braque, Gris, Duchamp, Pound, Williams, Woolf) opened a  space for innovation by shattering old icons, the innovative artists of the 1950s and  60s (Beat and Confessional poets including Ginsberg and Plath, Minimalist and  Conceptual artists including Robert Morris and composer John Cage) responded  by filling this space with often shocking or enigmatic images of experience be- yond the traditional purview of representation. While Hayden gravitated towards  earlier (1920s) manifestations of radicalism, I distinguish him, in retrospect, as  part of a charge forward into uncharted territory, a member of the dispersed neo-  avant- garde. Hayden’s notion of mid- century aesthetic developments in the U.S.  remained tied to an enticing myth of nineteenth- century origins (far from Walter  Benjamin’s notion of history, for example). He deflates the radicalism of mid- 1950s  counter-c ulture poetry this way: If the new poetry seems less controversial than it did two decades ago, it also  appears in retrospect to have been less iconoclastic [my italics] than its partisans  boasted. It was really, less spontaneous combustion than the upsurge of fires  kindled in the past. (“Recent Poetry” 69) In Hayden’s opinion, mid-t wentieth- century U.S. poets were still working from  the major nineteenth- century innovations of Whitman, Baudelaire, Rimbaud, and  Hopkins. Hayden credits Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, and Charles Olson  with redefining the nature and function of poetry for his own era (69). Pound and  Williams, embroiled as they were in the literary and artistic scenes abroad and at  home, participated in the early twentieth-c entury revolution of the avant- garde,  and Hayden studied their imagistic innovations carefully. Along with the Négri- tude poets he admired, Hayden broadens the canon to include Paul Laurence  Dunbar, Langston Hughes, Countee Cullen and others from the Harlem Renais- sance for whom subversive themes became central.  Representing the world posed welcome challenges for Hayden, but representing  the self as part of a changing world proved to be a more fundamental problem.  Hayden insisted upon identifying himself as simply a poet rather than a black  poet.22 Nevertheless, readers of the francophone Négritude movement were the  first to publically recognize Hayden’s excellence, several of them sharing his sym- bolist aesthetic and his reverence for Harlem Renaissance figures Langston Hughes  and Countee Cullen. Négritude poet Léopold Senghor awarded Hayden the grand  prize for Anglophone poetry in Senegal in 1966. Despite this unexpected coup,  Hayden enjoyed little recognition at home. He was derided by members of the  274 The CompaRaTiST 36 : 2012 </page> <page sequence="13"> Black Arts Movement in the 1960s because he insisted upon distinguishing his aes- thetic practice—his poetry- writing—from overt political engagement. Hayden ex- plains his disdain for ethnic categories: I believe in the essential oneness of all people and I believe in the basic unity of  all religions. I don’t believe that races are important; I think that people are im- portant. I’m very suspicious of any form of ethnicity of nationalism; I think that  these things are very crippling and are very divisive. These are all Bahá’í points  of view, and my work grows out of this vision. (“Vision” 111) Hayden rejects the illusions of conventional realism, just as he eschews restrictive  ethnic labels, yet he insists on portraying recognizable subject matter grounded in  a specific place and time of human experience: mid- century Mississippi.  Due to his rejection of the separatist Black Arts Movement, Hayden’s critical re- ception suffered greatly.23 Instead of enjoying broad readership, Hayden became  the black poet with the “best underground reputation” in America (McCluskey 203;  Prose 108–9). John Ciardi speaks of Hayden’s modest horizontal recognition during  his lifetime, in contrast to his vertical legacy or his lasting impact, one that ulti- mately establishes him as a great American poet (Hatcher xi).24 ii. Contemporary painter and mosaicist Janet Kozachek engages political themes and  questions of power in an even more oblique way than Hayden. The enigmas of her  Roadside Effigy recapitulate the issues of openness, ambiguity, and hybrid styles ap- parent in Hayden’s poem. As in “Night, Death, Mississippi,” she avoids confessional  self- revelation or expression, but rather creates an autonomous aesthetic artifact  that engages both aesthetic ideologies of her era and realities of a conflicted U.S.  culture.  Thematically, Kozachek’s painting possibly alludes to a lynching while ironi- cally depicting a Christian cross, draped in Klannish robes. Thus, the veiled crucifix  serves as a trace of the crime, a testament to ritual sacrifice rather than salvation.  Then again, the flowing fabric could be rogue laundry caught on a telephone pole.  The central shelter proposes a grid structure, grounding the image materially, yet  suggesting a more spiritual dimension. Like Hayden’s “windowless night,” the rural  bus shelter’s metal sheets (mistakable for panes of glass) serve to obscure rather  than reflect or enable vision. Krauss interprets such grid structures as announcing  “among other things, modern art’s will to silence, its hostility to literature, to nar- rative, to discourse” (9). Nonetheless, the quiet nature of this work seems to invite  a plot to unfold and animate the vibrant scene. The artist herself insists that the   Beyond the Veil 275 </page> <page sequence="14"> fiGuRe 1. Janet Kozachek, Roadside Effigy 1995.

Instead, they contribute to the artist’s subversive goal of undermining received con- ventions of Albertian perspective (by flattening the picture plane) and her own  schooling in Hans Hofmann- derived Expressionism.  Kozachek paints a combinatory language in which meanings open up. Whereas  her teachers promoted Hofmann’s “push and pull” theory that “planes of subtle  color differences in carefully composed juxtaposition [cause] an illusion of ad- vancing and receding areas,” she engages an alternative technique to create a sense  of dynamism on a flattened canvas. Rejecting what she terms Abstract Expression- ism’s “desire to control private space through the manipulation of color and form  on a canvas,” she takes a more self- effacing yet effective approach: My work reflects everything that challenges presumptions of control and de- finitive understanding. So although there are structural relationships and com- positional arrangements that pay homage to Abstract Expressionism, there is a  different philosophical outlook at its core. (7 May) 276 The CompaRaTiST 36 : 2012 </page> <page sequence="15"> Kozachek’s confrontation with Expressionism in the service of politically charged  subject matter parallels Hayden’s uneasy yet productive relationship with legacies  of the Harlem Renaissance and with the Black Arts Movement.  In the painting, an anthropomorphic figure appears to move both towards a sort  of bus shelter and away from it. Like the poet, the painter proposes new interven- tions into space as Foster would have it (ix), contingent on readerly perceptual ex- perience and interpretation. While the presence of the grid emphasizes the surface  of the canvas itself, the palpable swirl of white paint calls attention to the artificial,  constructed nature of the work. Krauss describes this geometric structure’s ability  to dismantle elements of realistic mimesis, however clearly the artist seems to point  to geographical- historical contingencies: In the flatness that results from its coordinates, the grid is the means of crowding  out the dimensions of the real and replacing them with the lateral spread of a  single surface. In the overall regularity of its organization, it is the result not of  imitation, but of aesthetic decree. (9) So, in an assemblage of styles, from naturalistic landscape to almost Expressionist  swaths of color,25 Kozachek presents a struggle between form and content. This  approach is similar to Hayden’s incorporation of strict, self-i mposed formal struc- tures (regular lines and stanzas) and charged subject matter.  Like Hayden, Kozachek is reluctant to over- manipulate the material qualities  of her medium by forcing them into mimetic postures. In fact, she feels ambiva- lent about compromising the sheer force of the material, paint. Alan Paskow has  pointed out the kitschy colors on the building, contrasting with more naturalistic  landscape hues (kozachekart.blogspot.com 14 Jan 2008). This stylistic dissonance  correlates with Hayden’s melding of vernacular speech and elevated, lyrical lament.  Kozachek consistently honors graphic qualities as highly as she does naturalistic  depiction: “It is up to me to imbue that content with form. As long as the form con- tinues to hold meaning for me this does not entail too much compromise of artistic  integrity.” Remarkably, she describes her creative acts in ways reminiscent of the  mosaic assembly process she knows well. Sections of tile, stone, etc., evolve from  the abstract medium as paint does, to ever more precisely referential signifiers (or  recognizable objects). As the work develops, the paint, like the mosaic shard, starts  to speak in an increasingly recognizable, however, unconventional way.  For example, the words in Roadside Effigy hardly signify the way one would ex- pect, as affirmation or invitation to conversation. The artist explains, The words in “Roadside Effigy” read God Loves You, written in what appears to  be a hasty crayon wielding hand, like that of a child. Because of its red local color  in dissonance with the surrounding colors, the words neither recede peacefully   Beyond the Veil 277 </page> <page sequence="16"> nor do they advance. Instead the words float, hovering with a jarring uncertainly  above their background. They are intended to unsettle because they neither in- vite the viewer in nor do the red words present themselves to the viewer’s space.  (7 May) Rhetorical considerations of structural composition thus overshadow the linguistic  import of these three words.  The lonely scene seems to insist upon its own absences, the emptiness of a shelter  promising Christian platitudes, the uninhabited fabric. The missing or imagined  victim in both poem and painting, the forbidden subject in the bildverbot tradition  (particularly when posed as a Christ figure) raises further questions as to the im- plications of artistically rendered voids within the verbal and visual texts. Michel  Foucault explains the potential power of such silence within discourse: Silence itself—the things one declines to say, or is forbidden to name, the dis- cretion that is required between different speakers—is less the absolute limit of  discourse, the other side from which it is separated by a strict boundary, than an  element that functions alongside the things said, with them and in relation to  them within over- all strategies . . . . There is not one but many silences, and they  are an integral part of the strategies that underlie and permeate discourses. (27) While Foucault indicates that negativity and resistance must always be deformed  by enclosure within the patriarchy, silence can also be a kind of critique that es- capes such strictures (Jones 656). The element of implicit protest in all three works  depends on just this strategy of indeterminate signification, sounding silences  along with sense.  Not only the forms, but the colors themselves take on a significant role in Koza- chek’s painting. The blood- colored earth seems degrees darker than the iron- rich  dirt of the American southeast.26 Black, anthropomorphic branches raise arms  from behind the shelter in a warmer, possibly feminized, recapitulation of the inert  cross. This gesture of supplication and benediction contrasts with the geometric  form [the cross] that has spoken throughout centuries. The open signification of  these enigmatic elements of form and color suggests the painting plays with the  very limits of representation, in a way that can be connected to fundamental as- pects of the bildverbot tradition in the West.  Leora Batnitzky argues that the Judaic ban on images, “translates into an explo- ration of the limitations of images and image- making” (86), a venture that precipi- tated philosopher Hermann Cohen’s central tenet.27 He locates in aesthetic feeling,  the separation between humans and God, a sense of alienation exacerbated by the  periodic ban on graven images. He identifies the lyric impulse itself in terms of  Sehnsucht, a noun of yearning or longing. Paskow echoes this phenomenon in his  278 The CompaRaTiST 36 : 2012 </page> <page sequence="17"> discussion of Kozachek’s “Janus- like” veiled figure or indeterminate white form that  seems to both seek the belongingness represented by the shelter and to turn away  from it. This cloth thus prefigures the symbolic in the manner of a blank page of  cotton, ready to be formed into a recognizable shape or to display a verbal/visual  message.  In contrast to this quiet turning away from mimesis or graphic similitude,  we might consider the most iconic documents of lynchings in the U.S., our very  loudest, most positive markers: the well-k nown photographs disseminated by the  press in which bodies of murdered men are juxtaposed with crowds of enthusiastic  onlookers. Our three artists transmute this extreme of barbarism via their mini- malist approach and degrees of detachment. The emptiness of Kozachek’s scene  serves as a more extreme counterpoint to such crowded media images. Hayden,  Kozachek, and Feelings somehow escape the gawking crowds by orchestrating en- sembles of blind seers or visions obscured. iii. Amid Tom Feelings’ scenes from The Middle Passage: White Ships / Black Cargo,  one finds another quasi-l ynching scene in which an African captive is supported  by a cluster of white men. The unnamed painting from Feelings’ book (22) clearly  features five men in the foreground and numerous chained beings in the back- ground, yet elements of ambiguity and stylization ally the central figure and the  work itself with the projects of Hayden and Kozachek. The very presence of a gen- eralized, traumatized body opens a space for the critique of dehumanizing policies  enforced via de-i ndividuating practices. The once forbidden subject of institution- alized slavery seems reified in the black body itself, elevated by white arms, in turn  rendered mechanical through repetitions of semantic identity.  A leader of the Black Arts Movement, Feelings shared many of Hayden’s the- matic and stylistic strategies. The artist accomplishes parallel effects with his often  mystifying imaginative perspective, his hybrid stylization, and his seeking after a  redemptive sublime even at the sight of horror. Feelings describes both his com- mitment to difficult subject matter and the intentional ambiguity of his expressive  modes: There was a conscious move on my part not to evade the pain, but to orchestrate  these pictures to make them move like a dance, flow like music, so you could  examine both the joy and pain in a celebratory experience. I make people work:  If there are not words, they have to decipher it for themselves.

The  effect of melding black and white on a radically reduced palette both intensifies the  280 The CompaRaTiST 36 : 2012 </page> <page sequence="19"> sense of ethnic difference and denatures it by dissolving into shades of gray. Do  white arms lift the black martyr down (as in a deposition scene)? Or is this an in- stance of elevation, even an apotheosis, when the Black man rises above the others,  or symbolically frees himself from slavery? Feelings explains his strategy of open  signification: “Sometimes I bathe the images in light or darkness to make them look  or feel unfinished or implied—to make the viewers use their creative senses to pull  out and investigate what’s in their minds” (“Artist” 691). Feelings’ approach thus  corresponds to Hayden’s and Kozachek’s modes of indeterminacy—involving the  reader in the deconstruction of such essentializing dichotomies as good and evil,  black and white—as well as reworking artistic spaces for viewing.  The ship’s rigging provides another grid structure, emphasizing human con- structs that enable and enforce systems of oppression. This geometry returns in  the rhythms of crouched and curled bodies chained in the hold and reified in the  manner of a decorative motif. The danger of over- identifying with the trauma victim  is balanced by the threat of othering the multiple Africans, practically fetishized in  their iconic postures. A jazz aesthetic of echoing rhythms and repetitions merges  ethnicities and cultures into what Brent Edwards calls “transnational circuits of ex- pressive culture” (18). While the form proves reminiscent of Jean Toomer’s mod- ernist collage effects in Cane, the artist’s goal of integrating ethnicities to create a  more authentic notion of the American identity reflects Toomer’s project as well.29  The mythic elements that arise when slavery-a s- institution transforms into  slavery- as- failed- or- forbidden narrative have counterparts in poetic form and in  structuralist literary analysis. Krauss explains myth as a type of repressed grid that  spatializes the content, allowing for paradoxical instances in which conflicting  “views [are] held in some kind of para- logical suspension” (13). Such a scenario,  I argue, allows for the ritual killing associated with lynching (a vestige of slavery),  and the moral truth that it is wrong and unlawful. Another example would be the  pre- 1865 legalization of forced servitude as a national policy in a country founded  on notions of liberty. As Hayden participates in the re- presentation of these myths,  “The sequential features of a story are rearranged to form a spatial organization”  (Krauss 13). The spatial aspects of Hayden’s pseudo-s tory are clearly evident in the  stanzaic blocks he erects and, more abstractly, in the constellation of perspectives  he assembles. The gaps and voids in the construction ensure spaces in which per- petuating myth may be challenged and transformed. Meanwhile, the grid struc- tures in many of Feelings’ Middle Passage paintings resist the narratives that so  readily attach themselves to this “picture book for adults” as he called it. The end- less repetition of the unbridled grid projecting beyond the borders of the page (or  canvas) mimics the historical timelessness of mythemes or primal moments that  dissolve differences between cultures and races, but also allow for the phenomena  of human suffering at the hands of other humans.  Beyond the Veil 281 </page> <page sequence="20">  Fully acknowledging the realm of the unspeakable, Hayden credited his mentor  W.H. Auden with the notion of poetry as “a process of solving for the unknown.”  “In poetry,” Hayden clarifies, “you are really solving for x, looking for the unknown  quantity. You are trying to say what cannot be said any other way—and, in some  poems, you are trying to say what cannot be said at all” (Prose 70; Hatcher 17). This  notion of articulating that which lies outside discourse parallels the phenomenon  of representing the unrepresentable as a defiant act of resistance to bildverbot tra- ditions. The notion of the unknown also evokes the underlying spiritual realm cen- tral to Bahá’í faith.30  The act of lynching, used as a tool to terrorize a population, to police interracial  or atypical sexualities, and to suppress civil rights activism, has its legacy in the  present day. TIME Magazine called Billie Holliday’s “Strange Fruit” (1939) (in which  human corpses hang from trees) “the song of the century” (1999), granting tremen- dous emphasis to this cultural phenomenon. With its propensity to reveal and wit- ness, the New Media of the twenty- first century nevertheless pilots public atten- tion in ideological ways that can both expand and restrict vision. The veil descends  again over dead soldiers returning home and over political prison camps overseas,  phenomena reluctantly portrayed in the culture at large. Likewise, a cult of secrecy  currently surrounds questionable governmental practices, mental illness, domestic  violence, and abnormal sexuality, all issues Hayden dealt with privately in his own  life and prophetically in other poems.  Utilizing tropes of blindness and averted eyes, these verbal/visual artists as- sert an aesthetic in which the unseen becomes strikingly evident, the absent or  denatured body becomes a presence in the text. They close the gap between art  and life, not by illusions of realism, but by strategies of contingent signification.  Formal features parallel our being in the world—the human yearning to bear wit- ness and belong, the impulse to look away—and construct new spaces for viewing  the facts of history in explicitly artificial terms. Beyond the fragmentary render- ings of recognizable subject matter, beyond multiple perspective or overt seams of  construction, these three makers present a fundamental reorientation in terms of  institutional critique. By estranging violence and the reactions to it, each artist at- tempts to denature difference between black and white, to deconstruct traditional  notions of silence and absence. Each work depends on a tension between repre- sentation that resists the veil and ideologies that would seek to keep such shrouds  in place.  As early as 1948, Hayden was agitating for new forms, for new modes of expres- sion in the arts across the genres. Both his artistic restlessness and his appetite for  what would become a type of neo- avant- garde are evident in his “Counterpoise”  manifesto: 282 The CompaRaTiST 36 : 2012 </page> <page sequence="21"> . . . we believe experimentation to be an absolute necessity in keeping the arts  vital and significant in contemporary life; therefore we support and encourage  the experimental and the unconventional in writing, music and the graphic arts,  though we do not consider our own work avant- garde in the accepted sense of  the term. (Prose 41) In a pamphlet published in 1967, the year after his final version of “Night, Death,  Mississippi,” Hayden was still in quest of a poetic voice he could claim fully: “I  want to experiment with forms and techniques I have not used before—to arrive  at something really my own, something patterned, wild and free” (Prose 75). In  the intervening decades, Hayden had taken steps away from the early twentieth-  century strategies of the avant- gardes, and contributed to the creation of a new  mode of expression that has gone by many names.  The question becomes not how the lynching phenomena is portrayed, but what  its portrayal means. In other words, the choice of whether to show or not to show  race- based human aggression within a specified historical cultural context be- comes as important as the aesthetic object itself. Perhaps Hayden and Feelings par- ticipate in George Steiner’s quintessentially twentieth- century problem of whether  depictions of such subject matter can be done at all.31 Just as Robert Morris takes  vision out of the visual with his Blind Time paintings, so Hayden eliminates vision  from visually rendered experience, the ocularly confirmed witnessing of an extra-  judicial execution. The moral blindness implied by the windowless night falls out- side typical concerns of many mid-c entury Conceptual artists, yet the poet’s urge  to push his experimentation to the limits of sense recalls the preoccupation of this  movement with limits and borderlines. Again, the strangely participatory nature of  Hayden’s poem and Feelings’ painting (confusion over agency and victimization,  gray areas between black and white), harkens back to Toomer’s Cane with its refusal  to see ethnic difference according to established frameworks and its deliberate de- familiarization of a troubled, hybrid culture.  Despite his distance from its members, Hayden clearly identifies with the main  tenets of the Black Arts Movement: The truly revolutionary poets are always those who are committed to some  integrative vision of art and life. Theirs is an essentially spiritual vision which  leads to the creation of new forms and techniques, to a new awareness. “Without  vision the people perish” [Proverbs 29:18]. (Prose 70) According to the poet, attention to the metaphysical as evoked by real world-  based representations leads necessarily to formal innovation. Documented his- toric facts combined with aesthetic creation produce an arguably more authentic   Beyond the Veil 283 </page> <page sequence="22"> reality within the poem or painting than the one veiled by ideology and held in the  common hands of culture.  Hayden, Kozachek, and Feelings have expressed outrage, often quietly, by taking  on emotionally charged subject matter in a manner that resists paraphrase. Through  their defiant and delicate representations, they have borne witness to traceable his- torical phenomena surviving in always inadequate reportage, in contemporary re-  manifestations, and in aesthetic approximations.32 u State University of New York at New Paltz NoTeS  1 Translated from the German, bild denotes picture or image, while verbot refers to the  English verb to forbid. The prohibition against making images at all is ancillary to the  more familiar medieval iconoclasm (“breaking of images”) phenomena in the West  and Byzantine empires.  2 Like Hayden, Toomer eschewed ethnic labels, claiming seven distinct bloodlines for  himself, thereby calling into question artificial categories and tropes of race. Even  the musical refrains in the second part of Hayden’s poem can be read as an “inter- racial meeting,” as T. Austin Graham has described the dissemination and evolution of  Negro Spirituals into the popular culture of the United States (746).  3 Today, scholars revisit this work as a pivotal masterpiece of Black modernism, avoiding  earlier readings of essentialized Blackness, and instead using the work to demonstrate  Black modernism as an aspect of a complex, transnational aesthetic (e.g. Ford, Wilks,  Farebrother, Graham). Rachel Farebrother takes Cane’s “Theater” section as a depic- tion of “crossover culture,” a refigured image of the U.S. that acknowledges “cultural  traits traversing racial classifications and racial groups crossing cultural boundaries”  (Hegeman 49; qtd. in Farebrother 513).  4 While periodic injunctions against the blasphemous creation or veneration of such  sacred objects could be tied to the brief directive of Moses’ Second Commandment,  the reinstatement of such objects generally depended on arguments about instructing  the illiterate masses or legitimating the materiality of Christ’s incarnation. As Judith  Herrin explains, however, in her study of Byzantine debates over graven images, the  arguments used on both sides were directly related to the threat of Islam (114).  5 This phenomenon draws the poem into the realm of the pre- symbolic or in Julia  Kristeva’s terms, the semiotic.  6 While Hayden appreciated and sometimes emulated stylistic aspects of Eliot’s and  Yeats’ high modernist project—the collage or montage presentation, the intertextual  allusions, the fragmentary representation of real and remembered experience, the  psychological investigations—Hayden’s more progressive, neo-a vant- garde mode es- chews the psychoanalysis, confessional revelation, or melodrama also associated with  this movement.  7 Frank Rashid argues that as Hayden matured, he concentrated more on elegiac forms  than on the blues poems of his Paradise Valley Depression- era poems. Whereas both  284 The CompaRaTiST 36 : 2012 </page> <page sequence="23"> the blues and the elegy offer strategies for coping with adversity, “the elegist usually  writes to make sense of an irrevocable loss” rather than to “reverse the condition or  mollify the sadness” (201). The call and response form of the second section, I contest,  suggests some vestige of a blues orientation as Ralph Ellison would have it, “an impulse  to keep the painful details and episodes of a brutal experience alive in one’s aching  consciousness, to finger its jagged grain, and to transcend it, not by the consolation  of philosophy but by squeezing from it a new- tragic, near- comic lyricism” (90; qtd. in  Rashid 201).  8 By casting the lynching victim as a Christ figure, Hayden participates in a long tra- dition of similar renditions including “The Haunted Oak” (1903) by Paul Laurence  Dunbar, involving the surprising perspective of a tree haunted by the man who hung  from its cruciform branches. Claude McKay’s “The Lynching” (1922), Countee Cullen’s  “The Black Christ” (1929), and Langston Hughes’ “Christ in Alabama” (1931) also em- ploy the crucifixion trope.  9 Leslie Kane clarifies “the multiplicity of silent responses to verbal symbolism” in an ex- pansive way: “The retreat from the word encompasses not only nonverbal symbolism,  but also many forms of connotative, indirect dramatic expression such as innuendo,  intimation, hesitation, reticence, and bivalent speech that implicitly conveys more  than it states” (16).  10 Cathy Caruth, for example, indicates the problem with reliable witnessing after the trau- matic event: “For history to be a history of trauma means that it is referential precisely  to the extent that it is not fully perceived as it occurs; or to put it somewhat differently,  that a history can be grasped only in the very inaccessibility of its occurrence” (187).  11 Both Russian Formalist Viktor Shklovsky and Czech Structuralist Jan Mukařovský  emphasize the impact on both rhetorical power and readerly perceptual experience  when the artist calls attention not only to the subject matter itself, but to the medium  of expression as well.  12 Hal Foster develops an extensive critique of the limits of Peter Bürger’s Theory of the  Avant- Garde, faulting his approach as “overly selective” (limited to readymades, chance  experiments, and photomontages), and as overly wholistic, misrepresenting a diverse  combination of artistic concerns and goals as a unified movement. Moreover, Foster  criticizes Bürger’s dismissal of the 1950s avant- garde as “merely neo, as so much repeti- tion in bad faith that cancels the prewar critique of the institution of art” (8). Likewise,  whatever modernist features one can identify in Hayden’s 1960s poetry pale next to  his transforming vision of an American literature encompassing varying perspectives  while unencumbered by artificial tropes of ethnic difference.  13 As one of the many avant- gardes, or daringly experimental and innovative movements  of modernism, the neo- avant- garde refers to Hal Foster’s notion of mid-t wentieth-  century movements (especially Minimalist, Conceptual, and Pop art) that, in their re- flexive and meta- discursive stances, recapitulate concerns of early twentieth century  radical artists, not in terms of a return to origins, but rather in the mode of traumatic  regressions to the site of a major paradigm shift precipitated by aggressive critiques of  representation implicit in cubism, dada, and the advent of photography. See The Re- turn of the Real.  14 W. Scott Howard discusses Hayden’s figural historicity as a contiguous reality gener-  Beyond the Veil 285 </page> <page sequence="24"> ated within the poems. He situates his argument against Charles Davis’ notions of  Hayden’s “truth- telling” and Wilburn Williams’ view of the symbolism/history con- frontation as “redemptive.” Instead, he supports Vera Kutzinski’s assertion that Hay- den’s historical poetry seeks to revise the “linguistic surfaces” of the text of history,  thereby achieving a historical and poetic truth that “emerges from . . . the limbo of  the [poet’s] ever- transfiguring poetic imagination” (Kutzinski 308; 319; qtd. in Howard  135). To clarify, Wilburn Williams Jr. locates Hayden’s metaphysical approach in the  crux between imagination (not only symbolism) and history. In Williams’ words, “The  realities of imagination and the actualities of history are bound together in an alliance  that makes neither thinkable without the other” (67). As Phillip Richards explains,  evoking Hayden’s famous image of the diver, the poet became “a psychologist of his  culture,” following his mentor W. H. Auden, “by plunging into history” (606).  15 Phyllis Klotman describes such castration as “an initiation ritual in reverse, a warning  that white society would not allow, in fact forbade, the passage of the Afro- American  from boy to man. (Slaves went from boy to ‘uncle,’ these two states of being repre- senting the only stages through which the black male was allowed to pass . . .). On  the other hand, participation in the lynching was patent proof of the initiation into  manhood of the lyncher, or a rejuvenation of potency in some ill-s tarred impotent,  who was often able to display tangible evidence of having participated in the orgy”  (56). Pontheolla Williams identifies the act of castration as concerning one of the most  serious racial taboos, sexual relations between a black man and a while woman (100).  16 I refer here to Czech Structuralist Jan Mukařovský’s notion of literariness, based on  the foregrounding of the aesthetic feature of language within the work of art. See also  Michael Riffaterre’s Semiotics of Poetry.  17 Hayden (like Tom Feelings) acknowledges the corrupting effects on perpetrators of  racial violence. Both artists thus allude to famous commentary on the de- humanizing  metamorphoses visited upon slaveholders, including those discussed by Frederick  Douglass, Booker T. Washington in Up From Slavery, and Linda Brent (53). For fur- ther reading, see Fetrow (192); Callahan describes as well “deeds done at the cost of the  humanity of victim and perpetrator alike.”  18 Hayden’s Bahá’í faith informs his notion of the oneness of humankind and his Mes- sianic sense of hope and progress based on the “transilluminating” words of Bahá’u’lláh.  See John Hatcher’s From the Auroral Darkness for more on the poet’s religious beliefs,  including his faith in “a spiritual world underlying and ultimately more real than the  so- called ‘real’ world.” Hatcher contends that several of Hayden’s later poems suggest  that “there is an historical meaning to the bloodshed and transcendence we should  strive for as we confront the chaos” (43).  19 Marjorie Perloff insists upon Baudelaire and Rimbaud as the instigators of Modernism,  with Rimbaud as the poetic father of twentieth- century structuralism, offering in his  poetry a dynamic system of substitutions. For the structuralist, this system comes as  close as possible to a sense of meaning. Although he does not affirm this connec- tion directly, Hayden’s strategy of dissolving an event into words and referents that  worry little over matching up, yet create a powerful expression by structuralist means,  recapitulates Rimbaud’s technique. Rosalind Krauss, who would reject any notion of  origin in the nineteenth- century French poets, would nonetheless agree to this atten- 286 The CompaRaTiST 36 : 2012 </page> <page sequence="25"> tion to substitutions and open referents as intrinsic to the work of many associated  with the various avant- gardes.  20 Wilburn, for example, observes that Hayden’s fascination with history involves even  his seemingly ahistorical poetry such as “Night- Blooming Cereus,” in which one can  trace the mysteries of time thematized (73).  21 “We think the reader will not retain, through many pages, a doubt of the perfect accu- racy of its picture of slavery. If it is a mirror, it is of the very best plate glass, in which  objects appear so clear and ‘natural’ that the beholder is perpetually mistaking it for  an open window without any glass at all.” Anonymous review of Charles Ball’s The  Life and Adventures of a Fugitive Slave, from the Quarterly Anti- Slavery Magazine 1:4  (1836), reprinted in Davis and Gates (6) (qtd. in Mitchell 185–86).  22 Henry Louis Gates, Jr. has articulated the complexities of identity and blackness in  “Preface to Blackness: Text and Pretext” thus leading the way in a now complex and  compelling discussion of ethnicity: “‘Blackness’ is not a material object or an event  but a metaphor; it does not have an ‘essence’ as such but is defined by a network or  relations that form a particular aesthetic unity. If [the black writer] does embody a  ‘Black Aesthetic,’ then it can be measured not by ‘content,’ but by a complex structure  of meanings” (254; qtd. in Jim Murphy 123).  23 The 1966 writers’ conference at Fisk University marks the emergence of the Black Arts  Movement and also Hayden’s break with its leaders when he claimed to be “a poet who  happens to be a Negro” rather than a Black, African- American, or Negro poet. Melvin  Tolson led the charge against Hayden, and Hayden never recovered from this devas- tating event (nor did he change his position) (Hatcher 36–37).  24 As an ironic caveat to Hayden’s own challenges in self definition, he learned at the age  of forty that due to a legal glitch, his name was not his own, and his existence could  not be verified within the state records. For an interpretation of Hayden’s dilemma of  self (re) discovery, see Jim Murphy’s “‘Here only the sea is real’: Robert Hayden’s Post- modern Passages.”  25 Morris reminds us of the “transcendence” of color over form in paintings, simply  because it is “essentially optical, [the] most optical element in an optical medium”  (Notes 4). Following this line of logic, color itself becomes transgressive in terms of  the bildverbot tradition.  26 W. E. B. Du Bois writes in response to his readings of canonical literature, “So, wed  with Truth, I dwell above the Veil. Is this the life you grudge us, O knightly America?  Is this the life you long to change into the dull red hideousness of Georgia?” The Souls  of Black Folk (X) [qtd. in Septo, epigraph]. Hayden also immersed himself in canonical  literature, and defended himself against the charge that this knowledge (this un- veiling) could somehow compromise his Blackness.  27 Cohen writes, “the question may be raised whether the peculiar kind of poetry of the  Bible could have arisen if the plastic arts had not been checked. This peculiarity con- sists in the lyric poetry of the psalms, which sing neither of God alone nor of man  alone. Plastic art, however, can only present an isolated depiction of both. Thus plastic  art would have impeded the lyric style, for which the relation of God and man be- comes the problem of its monotheistic aim” (58; qtd. in Batnitzky 78).  28 Feelings describes his graphic work in distinctly literary terms: “This is not a quick read,   Beyond the Veil 287 </page> <page sequence="26"> rather it’s like a long novel. So I did the drawings over and over again, because I was  trying to do two things. One was to project the huge panoramic feel of the experience,  because this happened to millions of people, but at the same time I wanted to create  an impression, so you got the feeling like it happened directly to you” (Mungen 1).  29 As Jennifer Wilks points out, Toomer’s mission was (like Hayden’s and Feelings’), “not  to separate African Americans from American culture, but to ensure the recognition  of the former’s place within the latter” (810). She also indicates the impact of Jessie  Redmon Fauset and Alain Locke whose emphasis on the emergence of black “expres- sive culture” both in the U.S. and Europe helped shape the Harlem Renaissance (802).  30 John Hatcher indicates that several of Hayden’s early 1970s poems “hint at a spiri- tual world underlying and ultimately more real than the so- called ‘real’ world:” “The  Mirages,” “Monet’s Waterlilies,” “October,” “A Plague of Starlings,” as well as his great  “The Night- Blooming Cereus” ([1970] 1973) (43).  31 It [Moses und Aron] belongs to that group of works produced in the 20th century, and  crucial to our present relationship to art, which have their own possibility as essen- tial theme. I mean that it asks of itself—as Kafka does of fiction, as Klee asks of visual  form—whether the thing can be done at all, whether there are modes of communica- tion adequate” (Steiner 42; qtd. in Batnitzky 74).  32 The author gratefully acknowledges the editorial suggestions of Nathaniel Wallace, Jeff  Miller, Lee Bernstein, and Lee Conell. woRKS CiTeD Batnitzky, Leora. “Schoenberg’s Moses Und Aron and the Judaic Ban on Images.” Journal  for the Study of the Old Testament. 92 (2001): 73–90.
