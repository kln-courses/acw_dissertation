<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Chinchorros were a preceramic fishing society that inhabited the Atacama coast of southern Peru and northern Chile from about 7020 to 1110 B.C., and their antiquity is much greater than originally thought. Previous Chinchorro chronologies have focused on seriatio,1 offishing implements; this paper suggests analysis of mummies as another useful chronological tool. The Chinchorro system of artificial mummification, the oldest in the world, began about 5050 B.C, and was abandoned about 1720 B.C. Black, Red, Bandage, Mud-Coated, and Natural mummification styles represent diachronic cultural changes. In contrast to previous views, I argue here that the sophisticated Chinchorro mortuary practices originated locally, near Arica, specifically in the Camarones Gorge. The high concentration of cemeteries, high mortuary energy expenditure, presence of villages, and heavy reliance on maritime subsistence, as inferredfrom mummies, artifacts and human bone analyses, are all indicators that the Chinchorros were an early sedentary maritime society. The ideological complexity and antiquity of settlement of the Andean coast therefore need reappraisal. Los Chinchorros representan una cultura de pescadores preceramicos que habitaban la costa sur del Peru y el norte de Chile entre los anos 7020 al 1110 A.C., y su antiguedad es mucho mas grande de lo que se pensaba. Tradicio- nalmente, la seriacion de los artefactos de pesca ha servido como un instrumento cronologico para la periodificacion de Chinchorro; aqui sugiero, en cambio, que el analisis de las tecnicas de momificacion es un metodo alternativo. El sistema de momificacion artifical de la cultura Chinchorro, el mas antiguo del mundo, origino hacia 5050 A.C., y fue abandonado hacia 1720 A.C. Por contraste con previas opiniones, sugiero que las sofisticadas tecnicas de mo- mificacion de Chinchorro se originarian localmente, en el area de Arica, especificamente en la Quebrada de Ca- marones. Los estilos de momificacion negra, roda, con vendajes, con patina de barro, y natural representan cambios culturales diacronicos. La alta compleVidad mortuoria, junto con la alta concentracion de cementerios costeros, la presencia de villorrios, y la fuerte subsistencia maritima estarian indicando que la Cultura Chinchorro fue una sociedad netamente marEtima, con un elevado sedentarismo. Por lo tanto, la compleVidad ideologica y la antiguedad del poblamiento costero de esta region andina necesitan ser reavaluados.

The word "Chinchorro" is sometimes used alone, but it is not clear if this use refers to artificially made mummies, natural mum- mies, or to Chinchorro as a cultural group.

Arriaza Bittmann (1982) recommends that Chin- chorro studies attempt to clarify Chin- chorro terminology, mummification tech- niques through time, origin, chronology, fate of the Chinchorro people, role of mummifi- cation, and social implications. I have dis- cussed all these points and others, including the physical boundaries of Chinchorro ter- ritory (Arriaza 1993); this paper presents a synthesis of my answers to Bittmann's ques- tions. Terminology Several terms, such as "Chinchorro," "Chin- chorroid," "Chinchorro Complex," "Chin-</page><page sequence="2">36 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 6, No. 1, 1995 Figure 1. External and internal representations of a Black mummy (the two figures on the left side) and of a Red mummy (the two figures on the right side). For millennia the Chinchorro people were deeply concerned with the afterlife and the proper care of the deceased. Their cemeteries were small but densely occupied, and there was no evidence of individuals with lavish grave goods, as seen in later agricultural so- cieties of the region, that may denote the ex- istence of an elevated social rank. Chinchorro cemeteries may contain mummies of several types, including Black, Red, Bandage, Mud- Coated, and Natural Chinchorro mummies (Figures 14). The Black, Red, and Bandage mummies are the most complex. It is my hypothesis that Chinchorro mummification techniques represent cultural transforma- tions over time that increased in complexity, declined, and eventually disappeared. Hence the use of"Chinchorro" to embrace only complex artificial mummification would be erroneous, because it would exclude the sim- pler Mud-Coated and Natural mummies. A total of about 208 Chinchorro mummies from at least 10 sites is known from rescue oper- ations and the literature. I estimate that about 71 percent were artificially mummified and in an extended position, and practiced both natural and artificial mummification. The people of the Chinchorro Culture inhabited the Atacama coast from at least 7020 to 1 1 10 B.C., a range much greater than any previ- ously reported for Chinchorro. In this text I use the terms "Chinchorro," "Chinchorros," or"Chinchorro people" in- terchangeably with the concept of Chinchor- ro Culture. A Chinchorro mummy is a body from this culture, preserved either by natural or artificial means. Such mummies were commonly wrapped in a reed mat or camelid skin shroud and buried in an extended po- sition, on the back with legs extended or semiflexed, and often aligned in groups. Cultural materials that help to define the Chinchorro Culture are harpoons, shell and cactus fishhooks, composite fishhooks, fish- hook weights, lithic knives, lanceolate lithic points, throwing sticks, and darts. Reed fibers and basketry materials also make up a large part of the funerary objects. Absence of ce- ramics, woven textiles, and metal artifacts typifies the Chinchorro Culture.</page><page sequence="3">Amazal CHINCHORRO BIOARCHAEOLOGY  1993). In contrast, for Rivera (1975, 1991) 37 the Chinchorro Tradition is a long legacy based on maritime subsistence. Rivera's def- inition of the Chinchorro Tradition also in- cludes later cultural phases from the city of Arica, such as late Quiani, Faldas del Morro, and E1 Laucho (Rivera 1975; Rivera et al. 1974). In more recent work, Rivera (1991) places the Faldas del Morro phase in the later Alto Ramirez Highland Tradition. Accord- ing to Rivera (1 991 ), copper, gold, and silver metallurgy, and experimental pottery are found at the end ofthe Chinchorro Tradition. My definition of Chinchorro Culture does not include the metallurgic or ceramic periods because neither has been found in recent Chinchorro studies in Arica. Although both terms, Rivera's technology- based Chinchorro Tradition and my Chin- chorro Culture as defined by mummification practices, can be valid for addressing the peo- pling ofthe coast, the term "Chinchorro Tra- dition" should not be used as a synonym for Chinchorro Culture because the latter is an attempt to address a different biocultural time frame based on mortuary styles within Chin- chorro. The primary purpose of this paper is therefore to call attention to the need to con- sider Chinchorro as composed of different stages of cultural development, rather than a continuous harmonious tradition.

Beyond Chinchorro Culture "Quiani" is the term most often applied to the cultural phase that immediately follows the Chinchorro. However, there is much con- fusion surrounding the term. For example, Bird (1943) divides the preceramic of Arica in two stages, "The Shell Fishhook Phase" (Quiani I) and "The Cactus Fishhook Phase" (Quiani II), dated by Mostny (1964) at 4220 and 3680 B.C., respectively. Although Bird (1943) found one artificially prepared Chin- chorro mummy, it was not dated. The Bird cultural sequence is problematic because the maritime-based technology was exception- ally conservative for thousands of years. Moreover, it has been found that cactus and shell fishhooks coexisted much earlier than previously thought at the recently excavated coastal sites of Acha 2, ca.7020 B.C. (Munoz and Chacama 1993:39), and Camarones 17, ca. 4980 B.C. (Munoz et al. 1993: 120-122). Llagostera (1989:63-64, 1992) calls Bird's Quiani I and Quiani II the Camarones Com- plex and Quiani Complex, respectively (Fig- ure 5), and states that Chinchorro artificial mummification practices peaked during the later Quiani Complex (Quiani II). This is a use of the terms Quiani and Camarones for Chinchorro that could lead to misunder- standings. Because the fishhook evidence from Acha 2 and Camarones 17 calls into serious ques- tion the theories of Bird (1943) and Llagos- tera (1992), I suggest that Chinchorro mum- mies, which can be radiocarbon dated and seriated, represent a better chronological in- strument. Moreover, fishing tool kits may vary according to local subsistence strategies, but a given mortuary treatment is indepen- dent of subsistence. Hence in Chinchorro studies mortuary treatment represents a more powerful expression of group identity and ideology than do artifacts. Quiani is also used as a synonym of the phase epitomized by the findings at the Qui- ani 7 site reported by Dauelsberg (1974). Qui- Figure 4. A child of Bandage style.

Various Chinchorro chronologies. 39 Arriaza] ani 7 (ca. 1500-1300 B.C.) is much later than Bird's Quiani II, and was not characterized by artificial mummification. Instead, the bodies were buried isolated and lying on one side with flexed legs. Elaborate turbans, the first evidence of hair braiding, and evidence of incipient horticulture were found associ- ated with Quiani 7 people (Arriaza 1988; Dauelsberg 1974). All these Quiani-related terms represent various excavations of middens and ceme- teries from the general coastal area of the city of Arica. In this paper "Quiani" is used to identify the Quiani period of Dauelsberg, as it is used by most Arican scholars, and this use is recommended for two simple reasons. First, local Arican archaeologists use "Quiani phase" for Quiani-7, which is culturally dis- tinct from the earlier Chinchorro Culture, and second, both of Bird's Quiani phases, and Llagostera's Camarones Complex, are asso- ciated with what today in Arican archaeology is known as Chinchorro (Santoro and Ulloa 1985). Habitat Early preceramic Ecuadorian (Las Vegas) and Peruvian (La Paloma) coastal sites (ca. 6000- 2000 B.C.) have yielded bodies buried in flexed positions, lying on one side, without evidence of artificial mummification (Quilter 1989; Stothert 1988). These early sites are therefore not considered part of Chinchorro. The present archaeological evidence indi- cates that the Chinchorros populated about 900 km of the Andean coast, from the north- ern frontier city of Ilo in southern Peru to the southern limit at Antofagasta, Chile (parallels 17 and 24 south and meridians 70 to 71 west longitude). However, the best representation of the Chinchorro Culture, especially of cem- eteries containing artificial mummies, has been found in Chile between the cities of Ar- ica and Cobija (Figure 6). Most of the Chin- CHINCHORRO BIOARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="6">40 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 6, No. 1, 1995 "Chinchorro" is rarely defined, and the bi- ological origin of Chinchorro populations is not clearly separated from the origin of Chin- chorro artificial mummification practices. I therefore suggest that the biological origin of the Chinchorros and the origin of their mor- tuary practices need to be addressed sepa- rately, as a genetic and an ideological-social issue respectively, because they are not nec- essarily related. Consideration of the ideo- logical-social origin of artificial mummifica- tion needs to address why, when, and where the practice developed. As we shall see, the founder Chinchorro population(s) apparently did not have the custom of complex prepa- ration ofthe dead when they first settled along the Arica coast. Biological Origin The biological origin of the Chinchorro peo- ple is still unknown; northern and southern Peru, the highlands of Chile and the area south of Arica are their four most likely homelands. Uhle (1919), using the logic of cultural dif- fusion, thought the Peruvian highlands were the center of Chinchorro origin. More re- cently Rivera and Rothhammer (1986), who have addressed the origin of Chinchorro us- ing linguistic, craniometric, and genetic marker analyses, have argued that the Am- azon area was the motherland. This is pos- sible, but because their data are restricted to late cranial samples, they do not necessarily shed light on Chinchorro beginnings. The biological origins of the Chinchorro people are most likely found in the highlands of Arica, based on the early evidence of hu- man occupation there. Although no ceme- teries or mummified remains have yet been found in the Arica highlands owing to the environment, numerous cultural remains of archaic hunters and gatherers, including de- pictions of hunting scenes in overhangs and caves, indicate that the region was occupied as early as 8000 to 7000 B.C. (Dauelsberg 1983; Santoro and Chacama 1982). Santoro (1993) suggests that seasonal climatic changes forced the highland hunters to be highly mo- bile, and that their search for lowland re- ANTOFAGASTA Hipodromo N I t ° 50 100 km Figure 6.

The dashed arrow indi- cates the probable spread. chorro cemeteries are clustered in the Arica area of northern Chile (Figure 6). North of Arica and south of Cobija no intact artificial Chinchorro mummies have been found, but skeletons with elements that may suggest ar- tificial mummification are present (Bittmann 1982; Wise 1991). The existence of the cold Humboldt ocean current decreases water evaporation at the Atacama coast and minimizes the chances of coastal rain. However, narrow and shallow rivers create fertile and swampy coasts that attracted wildlife and allowed for an early human occupation. Not surprisingly, most Chinchorro sites are found on the fertile coast north of Pisagua, a more hospitable environ- ment than the neighboring Atacama desert. Origin of the Chinchorros The hardship caused by the arid surroundings for early coastal occupation and the elaborate mortuary practices have led researchers to ask questions about the origin of Chinchorro. Confusion has arisen because the term</page><page sequence="7">Amaza] CHINCHORRO BIOARCHAEOLOGY 41 sources led to the discovery and settlement ofthe Atacama coast. If highland hunters and the Chinchorro fishers were part of such a continuum, highland and coastal lithic tech- nologies should share some similarities, al- though the very different ecological settings must be taken into account. No formal quantitative comparative sty- listic analyses of highland and lowland tech- nologies have yet been undertaken, but the earliest Arica site, Acha 2 (ca.7020 B.C.), has lithic points (rhomboidal with wings and lan- ceolate) that suggest a connection with a high- land lithic tradition. Santoro and Chacama (1982) report similar types of rhomboidal points in the preceramic Arica highland sites of Patapatane and Las Cuevas (ca.7550-6000 B.C.). According to True and Crew (1980: 70-73), this type of rhomboidal point is also called "Tambillo," and is common in other early Andean sites such as those in the Salar de Atacama. Acha 2 is likely to represent an early low- land-highland connection. The ocean and coastal resources furnished early hunters with access to year-round permanent and abun- dant food. Las Cuevas and Patapatane, for example (ca. 7550 B.C.), have yielded evi- dence of coastal shells (Choromytilus sp.) and shark teeth (Santoro and Nunez 1987). Could the Chinchorros have had a coastal rather than a highland origin? If the early Chinchorro settlers were already part of a maritime tradition coming from southern Peru to Arica, then the Chinchorro sites in southern Peru should be much earlier than those in Arica, but so far this has not been shown to be the case. The few Chinchorro- associated dates from Ilo reported by Wise (1991) are contemporaneous with those from northern Chile. It is also possible that a coastal migration from south of Arica gave rise to the Chin- chorros, but obviously only if the area south of Arica was populated first. Llagostera (1989) describes human occupation at Quebrada Las Conchas (Antofagasta, Figure 6) from 7730 to 7450 B.C. based on a fishing tradition, with a unique manufacture of geometric stone ar- tifacts but no evidence of Chinchorro mor- tuary practices. In Arica the earliest site that can be associated with the origin of Chin- chorro is Acha 2, a camp of 11 circular huts located 6 km inland in the Azapa Valley. The huts varied from 1 to 5 m in diameter and had a hearth in the center. One of the hearths yielded a l4C sample dated to 6950 B.C. (Mu- noz and Chacama 1993:28), and a body bur- ied on one side with legs semiflexed, wrapped in a vegetal mat and camelid fur, was dated to 7020 B.C. Acha 2 is characterized by a maritime tool technology that includes sink- ers, cactus fishhooks, and harpoon heads, as well as a hunting tool kit of lanceolate and rhomboidal lithic points. In addition to the fishing gear and numerous shells, an intense maritime subsistence is indicated by the re- sults of trace-element analysis of the skeletal remains and the presence of auditory exos- tosis, a maritime-induced pathology. The fact that the burial was wrapped in a shroud of vegetal mat fiber, probably col- lected at the swamps of the river delta, and camelid skin, makes the Acha people the first coastal-valley inhabitants and the best can- didates to date for the source of the Chin- chorro people. Recently, two more bodies buried in an extended position and wrapped in a vegetal fiber mat were found at Acha 3, about 500 m from Acha 2. They date to about 6000 B.C. (Calogero Santoro and Vivien Standen, personal communication 1993). Standen (personal communication 1993) also commented on the morphological resem- blance of the facial features of the Acha 2 and Acha 3 individuals. Origin of the Mummif cation Practices The origin of Chinchorro artificial mummi- fication is certainly puzzling and open to sev- eral interpretations. If the biological origin of Chinchorro can be traced to hunters and gatherers from the Amazon or the Arica high- lands, the question arises as to whether they practiced artificial mummification before moving down to the coast. The nomadic way of life of hunters and gatherers would make artificial mummification unlikely, and no</page><page sequence="8">42 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 6, No. 1, 1995 highland cemeteries or mummies have been found to support the argument for a highland origin for the complex mortuary practices of the Chinchorros. Furthermore, contempo- raneous Amazon skeletal remains are rare, as they are in the Highland area, and the few found so far do not show evidence of artificial mummification (Standen, personal commu- nication 1990). The early preceramic coastal sites of Las Vegas in Ecuador and La Paloma in Peru have yielded bodies buried in a flexed position on one side, without evidence of ar- tificial mummification (Quilter 1989; Stoth- ert 1988). Las Chilcas in Peru, a ca. 3000 B.C. preceramic site near the city of Lima, has been associated with Chinchorro by Lla- gostera (1992) based on the extended posi- tions of the bodies. However, the association seems unlikely because by 3000 B.C. in Arica the Chinchorro were at their peak in the de- velopment of the more sophisticated tech- niques (the Black mummies), whereas at the Chilca site the bodies show no evidence of artificial mummification. In fact, the Chin- chorro mortuary evidence points to a local (Arica-Camarones) coastal development of artificial mummification. The question is, then, where did it begin? Quebrada Las Conchas is the earliest coast- al site known in northern Chile, but it has not produced evidence of artificial Chin- chorro mummies. Other early sites with a maritime influence, such as Tiliviche (ca. 7810-5900 B.C.; Nunez and Moraga 1977- 1978), about 40 km inland, likewise lack ev- idence of artificial mummification. The body found at Acha (7020 B.C.) was naturally mummified (Arriaza et al. 1993). By about 5000 B.C. sites such as Camarones 14, neighboring Camarones 17, and Morro 1 show the first evidence of complex mum- mification. The radiocarbon dates of the mummies themselves demonstrate that the oldest complex mummification occurs in the Arica-Camarones area, from which it may have spread north and south (Figure 6). Why and when did the Chinchorros de- velop artificial mummification? Perhaps the Chinchorros believed the preservation of the dead body was necessary if the individual was to travel and enter the afterlife successfully. In other cultures that practice artificial mum- mification, the soul cannot survive if the body is not preserved (Cockburn and Cockburn 1980). Another explanation may be based upon ecological determinism. The dry desert predisposed buried bodies to become natural mummies, and hence the Chinchorros must have observed naturally desiccated cadavers. This experience may have triggered a desire to manipulate cadavers to achieve even great- er preservation. Ecological disasters or trag- edies could also have played a role in the development of artificial mummification. For the original groups settling on the Atacama coast, natural catastrophes such as earth- quakes or the E1 Nino phenomenon could have caused many cataclysmic deaths and perplexing events requiring supernatural ex- planations. These events may have led to the development of special mortuary rituals and ancestor worship. Maintenance and painting of the deceased body, perhaps as a means of relieving grief while avoiding decay, could presumably have led to more complex mor- tuary practices. Schiappacasse and Niemeyer (1984) sug- gest that artificial mummification started with the bodies of children, who were the only ones found to have been artificially mum- mified in the cemetery they studied at Ca- marones 14. Munoz et al. (1993) found a sim- ilar pattern at Camarones 17. This hypothesis certainly fits Camarones 14 and 17 (both lo- cated about 100 km from Arica), although much later, at Morro 1 (Arica), adults of both sexes as well as children were artificially mummified and buried next to each other. At Camarones 14 and 17 naturally mum- mified adults and artificially mummified children were apparently buried together, but unfortunately only the children were radio- carbon dated at both sites. It is fundamental to date both natural mummies and children subjected to complex mummification who form part of a group burial. Contempora- neous dates would substantiate the sugges- tion that artificial mummification began with</page><page sequence="9">CHINCHORRO BIOARCHAEOLOGY 43 Arriaza] children. In Arica natural mummification both predated and postdated artificial mum- mification. The origin of artificial mummification practices was probably multifactorial. A be- lief in an afterlife, high frequency of infant and adult mortality, natural disasters, trag- edies, and ecological changes may have in- tertwined to produce the Chinchorro prac- tice. Maintenance of the body as a sign of mourning, or as a spiritual link to supernat- ural forces, may have opened the way to con- tinuous worship of the dead and to artificial mummification. The extended duration ofthe practice demonstrates that it served as a pow- erful instrument of group identity and as a means for assuaging communal grief. Mummification Techniques The Chinchorro people had the basic ana- tomical knowledge for dissecting cadavers because their subsistence required manual skills for killing, butchering, skinning, dis- membering, and removing the desired parts of fish and sea mammals. Their varied mum- mification techniques, which correlate well with changes through time (Figures 1X, 7, 8), can be basically grouped into three cate- gories: Natural, Complex, and Mud-Coated. I view Complex and Mud-Coated mummi- fication as two systems of artificial mum- mification. Among the Complex mummies three variations are observable: Black, Red, and Bandage mummies. The Black mum- mies were internally built up from an elab- orate skeletal framework supported by sticks and twigs (Figures 1, 2). In contrast, the Red mummies were stuXed without much disar- ticulation, and the Bandage mummies share some features of Black and Red mummies. Among the Mud-Coated ones, two types oc- cur: an elaborate one with evisceration, and a simpler uneviscerated one. A synthesis of the main types of Chinchorro mummies fol- lows (see Table 1). Naturally Mummi.fied Bodies This category comprises bodies naturally dried by the desert environment, without major human intervention to induce mum- mification. The bodies were wrapped in reed mats, camelid furs, or pelican skin, with the legs sometimes slightly flexed. They are often only skin and bones, but internal organs may be present. Lithic knives, shells, and fishing gear sometimes form part of the grave goods. Complex Mummified Bodies The Complex mummies can be considered the typical Chinchorro mummies. The Chin- chorros used several elaborate procedures to preserve the cadaver, which was treated in- ternally and externally. Although there are variations, most fit in the Black, Red, and Bandage mummy categories (Table 1). Be- cause they are the most sophisticated of all artificial Chinchorro mummies, these Com- plex mummies appear separately in Figure 8 in order to highlight their development. BlackMummies. An external black man- ganese paint is the key element that identifies these mummies, but the name does not re- flect the elaborate mummification process behind the black paint. As the most complex of all the mummified bodies, they can be con- sidered the classic type of Chinchorro mum- mies. The bodies were converted into elab- orate statues with an inner structure of bones, unbaked clay, and sticks and ropes for rein- forcement (Figures 1, 2). Adults and suba- dults of both sexes received the Black mum- my treatment. To create a Black mummy, the mortician separated the trunk from the head, arms, and legs, and removed all organs and flesh. The head was scalped and the facial skin, includ- ing ears, was removed and preserved for later replacement on the body. The brain was ex- tracted through the foramen magnum or the skull was cut open. The trunk cavity was dried with hot ashes or glowing coals. The trunk was left articulated in adults and was disar- ticulated in subadults, a difference that prob- ably reflects the weaker ligaments in suba- dults, which could not withstand the manip- ulation required. Subadult Black mummies' trunks are often rectangular in shape, and include extra bones or sticks used to produce</page><page sequence="10">Mud- Striped coated Mud- (Black &amp; (eviscer- coated Treatment Black Red) Red Bandage ated) (simple) Natural 24 44 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 6, No. 1, 1995 Table 1.

The fragility of bones and joints did not always allow maintenance of the orig- inal form. After the bones of an individual were cleaned and dried, the skeleton was reassem- bled and secured in the following manner: Sticks approximately the length of the body were attached at the ankles, passed through the pelvis and chest, and joined at the neck to permit their insertion into the cranium through the foramen magnum. The sticks and bare bones of the extremities were then se- cured with fragments of mats and reed cords. Hands and feet, if disarticulated, were reas- sembled and fastened to the wrists and an- kles. The skull and trunk were filled with grass, ashes, soil, animal hair, or a mixture of these materials. The body was then completely modeled with a white-ash paste in which the morticians embedded the bones, sticks, and cords in an attempt to give the body its orig- inal form. Genitals were also modeled with the paste. The skin, or parts of it, was skill- fully placed over the paste, as is clearly visible in the head where facial skin and ears are present. The scalp with short black hair, probably the individual's own, was reat- tached and secured with pieces of sea-lion skin and ash paste. In a few cases the original skin appears as intact as if it had been rolled off along the extremities and then skillfully rolled back on again; in other mummies the skin occurs in patches or is completely ab- sent. The final step in the process involved painting the body with manganese. On the face the manganese paste was thicker to per- mit the modeling of eyes, nose, and mouth. Variations in the facial mask include occa- sional presence of several layers, and in a few cases complete absence of facial paint. Ab- sence of paint may be the result of chipping, or may indicate that the mortician never completed the mummy. After the black painting, a breech cloth or a fringe skirt and some pieces of sea-lion skin were added to the body. The final mummy must have ap- proximated the individual's weight. Black mummies were extraordinary man- if estations of the Chinchorros' manual skills, artistic abilities, and devotion to their beliefs. Although the mummies were solid when they were created, today they are extremely frag- ile. The unbaked pastes crack and fall apart easily, and at times the skeleton is completely deprived of evidence of mummification. This observation is extremely important because bare bones may not be recognizable as orig- inally part of an elaborate artificial mummy. Unique evidence of changes in Chinchorro Black mortuary tradition was recovered in 1991 when the remains of three Chinchorro mummies were collected in Arica by Univ- ersidad de Tarapaca staff during expansion of a local lumber yard. All the mummies fit the classic Black mummy category, but one is particularly interesting because it has bands of dull yellow and red ocher on top of the outer black paint on the trunk and arms. A stick used in the construction of the striped mummy yielded a date of 2800+155 B.C. (Arriaza 1993). The mummy's features and date may mark the transition to the subse- quent "red stage." Red Mummies. To produce these mum- mies the morticians sectioned the abdomen, groin, shoulders, and legs to permit removal of the organs and major muscles (Figures 1, 3). The body was decapitated and the brain extracted, and the cavities were subsequently dried with hot ashes or glowing coals, as ev- idenced by charred tissue. The head received a treatment similar to, but more elaborate than, that of a Black mummy. A black human hair wig made of tufts tied together, sometimes with tresses up to 60 cm in length, was attached to the occipital region with a manganese paste, following the con- tours of the cranium. The final result resem- bles a black helmet. A white ash paste was placed over the defleshed facial bones and covered with the facial skin; the face was then painted and modeled with either black man- ganese paste or dark red ocher to produce the semblance of a mask. Sometimes the facial skin and white-ash paste were not used, and only the dark facial mask may be present. In the occipital area the "black paste helmet"</page><page sequence="12">46 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 6, No. 1, 1995 that secured the wig was carefully painted red. Arms and legs were apparently not sepa- rated from the trunk. In some instances, the skin of the extremities appears to have been rolled down like a sock and rolled back again after removal of muscles and placement of stuffing materials. In a few cases, the skin of the lower legs of some adult Red mummies appears to have been replaced as bandages. The cavities were cleaned and dried, and major muscles removed. Sharpened sticks were slid underneath the skin ofthe legs, arms, and trunk to reinforce the body. The sticks were bound together at the neck and inserted into the foramen magnum to assist in reat- tachment of the head. Cord wrappings and ash or soil paste filled in and modeled the neck area and kept the head secure. The mor- ticians stuffed the body with a mixture of materials such as ashes, camelid hair, feath- ers, grass, animal and bird skin, and soil. Af- ter the body was stuffed, the incisions were sewn up with cactus needles and human hair or vegetal threads. Leather straps or cords were used to reinforce major joints. The final procedure was to paint the body and "helmet" with red ocher, leaving the hair and the black facial mask unchanged. In some cases a leather loincloth was added to rein- force the trunk and waist area, either before or after the red painting. The mummification technique contrasts with that of the Black mummies, in which neither main incisions nor sutures have been observed, because the bodies were completely disarticulated. The red treatment was used for adults and suba- dults of both sexes. Each finished Red mum- my was wrapped in a vegetal mat shroud, or, infrequently, in a camelid fur. Bandage Mummies. Mummies of this class, basically a variation of the Red mum- mies, are painted red and have human hair wigs and longitudinal sticks for reinforce- ment. At least one adult mummy from the Morro 1 site has a Bandage style, but on the legs only. This adult mummy corroborates the suggestion that the Bandage style is a vari- ation of the Red style. The children with bandages, however, have skin wrappings from neck to toes and show no evidence of inci- sions, as the typical Red adult mummies do (Figure 4). Mud-Coated Mummies. This class was prepared by first smoking the cadavers or partially drying them with glowing coals. Mud about 1 to 2 cm thick was then applied to the entire body; when it hardened it formed a gray cementlike substance. The mud coat- ing consists of a protein binder such as blood from the deceased or from sea lions, or an- other animal product, plus sand, sometimes with bits of vegetal fiber that could have been intentional inclusions or a result of contact between the cadaver and a mat while the coating was being applied. The Mud-Coated mummies do not show evidence of the use of longitudinal sticks to reinforce the body. These mummies apparently were prepared where they were buried, because they appear "glued" to the bottom of the grave pit. Two types of Mud-Coated mummies have been found, one with evisceration and one without. Only one case has been found so far with evisceration of the trunk, subsequent ash filling, and application of the mud coat- ing. The mud-coat treatment was used for adults and subadults of both sexes. Chronology Chinchorro burials are in graves about 50 cm deep. The dates and distribution of the mum- mies within a cemetery reflect extensive and diachronic occupation. In general, all Chin- chorro cemeteries contain different types of mummies (Figure 7) with a horizontal rather than vertical stratigraphy. In the Morro 1 site, for example, the Black mummies were found at the base of a hill, whereas the more recent Natural ones were near the hilltop. The lack of stratigraphic layering of burials, together with the fact that the focus of previous studies was on artifacts that changed very little through time, has not allowed a clear under- standing of Chinchorro chronology. As can be observed in Figure 5, Chinchorro has not only been referred to by several names in the past, but has also seen its time depth</page><page sequence="13">DATE (B.C.)

The chronology presented here emphasizes the Arica-Camarones area, because this re- gion has been more fully studied. Regional variations probably exist for the appearance, peak, and decline of mummification practic- es as a result of idiosyncratic variation. As Figure 8 shows, there were two periods in the Arica area when extended Natural mummies were present. The first, at the beginning of the Chinchorro Culture about 7020 B.C., lasted about 2,000 years. The dates for the naturally desiccated bodies come from the Acha 2 and Acha 3 sites (Munoz et al. 1993; Aufderheide et al. 1993). The second period of extended Natural mummies lasted about 380 years, from 1880 to 1500 B.C. based on evidence from the Morro 1 and Camarones 14 sites. In Camarones 15, however, extend- ed bodies, naturally mummified but with a layer of mud on their faces, are found from as late as 1110 B.C. (Table 2). In Arica the Quiani phase began about 1500 B.C., char- acterized by naturally mummified bodies buried in a semiflexed position with elaborate headdresses (Dauelsberg 1974). In Arica the four types of artificial Chin- chorro mummies (Black, Red, Bandage, and Mud-Coated) cluster between the dates of the two stages of naturally mummified and ex- tended bodies. At the Morro 1 site, the oldest radiocarbon date, ca.5860 B.C., corresponds to a Red mummy (MlTlCl), whereas the latest, ca. l 720 B.C., applies to a Mud-Coated mummy. The dates indicate that Chinchor- ro's artificial mummification practices en- dured about 4,140 years, from 5860 to 1720 B.C. Standen (1991) claims, however, that the 5860 B.C date for the Morro 1 mummy is faulty (Table 2), and she has obtained a date for the mummy of 2570 B.C. Schiappacasse and Niemeyer (1984), using an old typology of Uhle's (1919), describe the Camarones 14 mummies as having "Com- plex Preparation" and "reddish masks." In- fluenced by this description and by the early radiocarbon date of the Red mummy from Anca, I presented a chronology with two Red periods (Arriaza 1993). I considered the first period, thought to have endured 810 years (5860 to 5050 B.C.), questionable, whereas the second, with a 480-year span (2570 to 2090 B.C.), had a more solid basis (Morro 1 and Playa Miller 8 sites; Figure 6). In typo- logical terms the occurrence oftwo Red types, separated by about 3,000 years, was perplex- ing. According to Silvia Quevedo (personal communication 1993), the description of Schiappacasse and Niemeyer (1984) was vague because the mummies were found in a highly deteriorated state. I recently had the opportunity to inspect the Camarones 14 mummies, and although they are very frag- mented, there is enough left to demonstrate that they do not fit the Red style, and must represent the beginning of the Black or a Black-like type. I believe now that the 5860 B.C. date for the Arica Red mummy is in- accurate. Standen's new date of 2570 B.C. makes sense because it lands nicely within the range of the other radiocarbon dates for the Red mummies, in sharp contrast to the 5860 B.C. date. Moreover, the 10 subsequent dates presented in Table 2 (excluding Ca- marones 14) all correspond to Black mum- mies. If Standen is correct, then the oldest anthropogenic Chinchorro mummies are those from Camarones 14 and not those from Morro 1. Therefore, excluding the Arica date of 5860 B.C., Chinchorro artificial mummi- fication practices lasted 3,330 years, from 5050 to 1720 B.C. The Black mummy stage is found in only one period, with a minimum duration of 2,180 years (4980 to 2800 B.C.) and a max- imum of 2,250 years (5050 to 2800 B.C.), if the Camarones 14 data are considered pri- mordial evidence of Black mummies. The sites of Morro 1, Chinchorro, Camarones 17, and probably Pisagua Viejo (which I have not inspected) provide the best evidence of Black mummies. This wide distribution implies that populations were expanding and spreading the black style. The earliest date, 4980 B.C., for Black mummies with a solid typology comes from Camarones 17, whereas in the</page><page sequence="15">Radiocarbon Site Mummy Type Date (B.C.) Calibrated Age (B.C.)

Based on the ra- diocarbon dates, and if the conflicting date for the Arica Red mummy is eliminated, Ca- marones 14 and 17-which Schiappacasse (personal communication 1993) identifies as a single site-could mark the genesis of Chin- chorro artificial mummification practices. In sum, the Complex types (Black and Red) had a time span of 2,960 years, from 5050 to 2090 B.C. A radiocarbon date for a Mud-Coated mummy with evisceration is 2620 B.C., and the duration of this technique is unclear. The mummy represents a transition to simpler mortuary practices, and marks the decline of the Black Complex treatment and the ap- pearance of the lled and simple Mud-Coated types. A Mud-Coated mummy without evis- ceration has a radiocarbon date of 1720 B.C., and the duration of this mummy type is also unclear. It appears that about 2600 to 1700 B.C. the Chinchorros were breaking away from the previous mortuary traditions, as ev- idenced by the simultaneous presence of Red, Mud-Coated, and Natural mummies (Table 2, Figure 8). This presumably reflects changes in ideology and less social cohesion. The mud- mummy stage needs further studies to un- derstand what social transformations were taking place and why this style developed. Social Interactions The complexity of Chinchorro mummy pro- duction implies a well-established tradition, with transmission of the morticians' knowl- edge and beliefs from generation to genera- tion. It is probable that there were part-time specialists and apprentices; manual skills de- veloped after years of practice, and hence Chinchorro morticians may have started to learn at an early age by helping the old mas- ters with minor tasks such as the collection of grasses, sticks, pigments, or other mum- mifying materials. The Chinchorro people also carved small anthropomorphic wooden statuettes and made miniature clay figurines that resembled the mummies (Alvarez 1969; Martinez and Munizaga 1961; True and Nu- nez 19 71 ). The figurines may represent a type of portable art that the morticians could have carried as a teaching tool, or as a transport- able ancestor totem. No association among sex, age, and type of mummification is in evidence except in the case of the completely bandaged mum- mies, which were all children. The mum- mification of both sexes, independent of age, speaks for an egalitarian society. The Chin- chorros were also a society that cared deeply for the stillborn and developing fetus because they received the same mummification treat- ment accorded children and adults. The Chinchorro burial ceremonies must have had the dual purpose of guiding the dead to their eternal destiny and cementing the group's social bonds. For the living, especial- ly for the youngest, it must have been a pow- erful experience for learning about group ob- ligations and traditions. Mummification was probably a key element in reaching eternity for the individual, as well as for the group, and it might have been the cornerstone of group cohesion in the Chinchorro people. The sophistication seen in the Complex mum- mies implies that the mummification process and rituals could have lasted for weeks or even months. A prolonged mortuary ritual therefore probably also played an important role in daily socioeconomic and spiritual life. In Arica the existence of cemeteries (e.g., Chinchorro and Morro 1 sites) with similar types of Black mummies implies that various Chinchorro groups were living in different areas simultaneously. The slight variation in this mummy type noted both between and within cemeteries implies either the work of different specialists, or changes through time, or use of a variety of local products. For in- stance, there are variations in the number and position of the longitudinal sticks, the amount of manganese paste put on the face, the degree of emphasis on the facial features, and even the color of the facial paste. In Arica, in the case of the Complex mummies, the color of the facial paint varies from black to reddish, or paint can be completely missing. Also, in Pisagua Viejo and Patillos sites (Figure 6)</page><page sequence="17">Arriaza] CHINCHORRO BIOARCHAEOLOGY 51 green facial masks, the products either of soil rich in copper or of corrosion of thin orna- mental sheets of presumably native copper, have been reported (Bittmann and Munizaga 1976; Olmos and Sanhueza 1984). It is my view that mortuary differences rep- resent slow evolutionary changes in ideology within the group between 5050 and 2800 B.C., but these changes appear to have accelerated thereafter with the appearance of the Red mummies. I hypothesize that the ideological innovations manifested in mortuary practic- es and mummification styles do not represent external cultural influences that suddenly broke Chinchorro biocultural continuity, but instead exemplify local shifts in their spiritual beliefs. Cultural continuity is indicated by the homogeneity of maritime tool technology through time. The Complex mummies were bodies that could be moved, which contrast with the later Mud-Coated bodies that were fixed to the grave floor. This tremendous late shift in Chinchorro mortuary practices and symbol- ism must have been a reflection of major transformations in their ideology and beliefs concerning the afterlife. Perhaps from 2600 B.C. onward a greater sense of belonging to the land was developing, which dictated that the body be rooted to the earth. The late uneviscerated Mud mummies also mark the decline of the Chinchorro artificial mum- mification practices. The dying out of the Mud-Coated types at Camarones 15 is ob- servable by 1110 B.C., by which time only the face of the deceased was covered with mud (Rivera et al. 1974). These face masks, the last remnants of artificial mummification practices, survived an additional 400 years in Camarones. Sedentism The Chinchorros have been categorized as a semisedentary society. I argue, however, that maritime richness along with freshwater re- sources enticed the early coastal explorers to live in permanent camps and adopt a sed- entary coastal lifestyle. Although cemeteries are common, settlements along the coast are scarce; this may simply be the result of en- croachment of a modern city as in the case of Arica, and of the light materials employed in ancient architecture. It is assumed on the basis of cemetery size that the Chinchorros probably lived in small groups, and did not overpopulate the coast. If we suppose that the 11 Acha huts were contemporaneous and that each Acha family had one or two chil- dren, the resulting community size is 33 to 44 individuals. The large shell middens studied by Bird (1943) indicate extensive use ofthe coast by 4220 B.C.; evidence of peopling ofthe coastal region also comes from the Quiani 9 site, dated to 4420 B.C. (Munoz and Chacama 1982). Quiani 9 is characterized by semicir- cular huts on the slope of an Arica coastal hill. The huts, which were next to shell mid- dens, were built of posts with sea mammal skin for the roof. This site is both physically and chronologically close to the middens that Bird excavated in Quiani, and hence the two must be related. Quiani 9 is certainly a site where the Chinchorros once lived, and it fits perfectly with the Black mummy period. South of Arica, at the mouth ofthe Loa River, the site of Caleta Huelen 42 (Figure 6) had several semisubterranean circular huts with superimposed floors, which provide more ev- idence of permanent settlement. Occupation at this village is dated to 2830 and 1830 B.C. (Nunez 1971; Zatlar 1987). Cactus fishhook technology and extended burials with clay masks place this site within the Chinchorro Culture. Circular huts were also found in Conanoxa (about 40 km inland from Ca- marones) dating to 1790 B.C. (Nunez 1971; Schiappacasse and Niemeyer 1969), a time when Chinchorro artificial mummification was starting to decline. Besides the settlements, there are many other factors that point to early coastal se- dentism, such as concentrated coastal cem- eteries and middens, abundance of fishing gear, prevalence of auditory exostosis that is associated with a maritime subsistence, di- etary analysis that shows a high percentage of maritime resource consumption, and pau-</page><page sequence="18">52 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Rol. 6, No. 1, 1995 city of dental cavities. The evidence from Acha, about 7000 B.C., indicates that the Chinchorros were exploiting the coast year- round and not seasonally. Coastal middens from southern Peru and northern Chile attest to the new migrants' quick shift away from hunting and gathering land strategies, to fo- cus predominantly on hunting sea mammals, coastal birds, and fishing (Munoz and Cha- cama 1993; Sandweiss et al. 1989). Chinchorro sedentism and coastal subsis- tence is also reflected in their bones. Twenty- one percent (10/48) of the Chinchorros suf- fered from external auditory exostosis (Stan- den et al. 1984, 1985). This pathology is a consequence of chronic ear irritations, asso- ciated with diving, leading to bony out- growths in the ear canal. External auditory exostoses were found to be mostly a male condition, which suggests that males were do- ing most of the underwater food gathering. Moreover, bone-chemical analysis reveals that 89 percent of the Chinchorros' diet came from maritime products, 5 percent from ter- restrial meat, and only 6 percent came from terrestrial plants (Aufderheide and Allison 1992). As further evidence of a maritime diet, 19 percent (4/21) of the late Chinchorros had evidence of a tapeworm parasite, Diphyllo- bothrium pacifccum egg infections, which were obtained from consumption of raw or poorly cooked fish and sea-lion meat (Reinhard and Aufderheide 1990). Finally, consistent with a coastal diet, low in carbohydrates and high in abrasive materials, dental cavities among the Chinchorro were practically nonexistent. The biological (auditory exostosis, etc.) and archaeological studies (maritime tool kits, etc.) confirm that the Chinchorros were ex- tremely successful in the exploitation of local maritime resources year-round. Long before agriculture was practiced in the Andes, the abundance of maritime food and freshwater resources led the Chinchorros to a rapid and early sedentism on the basis of a maritime specialization. The abundance of food re- sources and sedentism then allowed the Chinchorros time for developing and main- taining a legacy of complex mortuary prac- tices. Conclusions Previous studies saw Chinchorro as a punc- tual evolutionary phenomenon occurring about 3000 B.C., but today with the new ev- idence that has accumulated during the last 10 years the Chinchorro Culture is seen as older and more culturally complex than pre- viously reported. Chinchorro Culture started at least 7000 B.C. and died out with the be- ginning of the Quiani Phase (ca. 1500 B.C.), but south of Arica the Chinchorro burial practices extend to about 1110 B.C. The coastal, inland, and highland sites (e.g. Acha, Tiliviche, and Patapatane, respective- ly) indicate early procurement, consumption and adaptation to maritime subsistence. This implies the antiquity of the peopling of the Atacama coast must be even earlier than we thought and thus needs a reappraisal to un- derstand this adaptation. The antiquity is even greater if the calibrated radiocarbon dates are used. The calibrated date for Acha, for example, is 8020 B.C., exactly a thousand years older (Table 2). Chinchorro ideological and biological ad- aptations produced a sedentary lifestyle, a maritime economy, and extremely complex mummification practices. Chinchorro mor- tuary behavior exemplifies the power of tra- dition, deeply rooted in peoples' minds, to serve useful purposes of group cohesion and survival. The study of the Chinchorro also reveals that complex mortuary practices should not be used as a synonym for politi- cally complex societies, or as an indicator of high technological achievements. The widespread distribution along the coast, as well as the high density of early cem- eteries in northern Chile, suggests a contin- uous settlement of the coast and opens up questions about population density and re- gional interactions. Long coastal occupation, spanning at least seven millennia, is not re- stricted to a few sites in Chile. Moseley (1992) presented evidence for a deeply rooted coast-</page><page sequence="19">Amaza] CHINCHORRO BIOARCHAEOLOGY 53 al exploitation of the Peruvian coast. Besides the Chilean Chinchorro sites, there are non- Chinchorro coastal sites, along the Pacific coast in Las Vegas (Ecuador), and La Paloma (Peru), also demonstrating continuous oc- cupations. These long occupations are a re- flection of propitious environments that pro- vided plenty of food, water, and basic needs for shelter. If these basic human needs were completely satisfied, then, there was no pres- sure to leave the coast and cemetery reuse is efficient and necessary since the oasis riverine environments of the coast restrict expansion without water-management technology. Chinchorro cemeteries do contain many mummies of different periods. Contrary to past suggestions, different types of Chin- chorro mummies found at one cemetery are not evidence of ranking, but rather of dia- chronic mortuary practices. The Chinchorro people excelled in their early maritime adaptation to the desert, but it is their early art and science of intentionally preserving the cadavers that have made them unique in the world. Artificial mummifica- tion is considered an ideological adaptation because the mortuary rituals presumably de- veloped as a mechanism to deal with envi- ronmental uncertainties (e.g., Nino phenom- enon, earthquakes) and the nature of life and death. It also likely maintained group cohe- sion through the millennia. Mummification and burial rituals probably satisfied spiritual needs, including that of respect to their tu- telary spirits and group solidarity. The biological origin of the Chinchorro people is still unclear. In contrast, artificial mummification developed locally, emerging about 5000 B.C in the Arica-Camarones area, most likely in the Camarones gorge. As il- lustrated in Figure 8, there were two intervals for Natural mummies, one for Black, one for Red, and one for Mud-Coated mummies. Chinchorro mortuary practices reached at least two clear periods of sophistication, one about 5050 to 2800 years B.C. with the Black mummies and another about 2570 to 2090 years B.C. with the Red mummies. The Black mummies were not only the most complex mummies, but this Black tradition had the longest duration. They have been found in at least six different sites (Table 2) showing cul- tural continuity through time and space. In sum, the main goal of this paper was to define Chinchorro contextually and chrono- logically. Future studies need to focus on test- ing the proposed Chinchorro stages to un- derstand possible mechanisms causing or leading to changes in Chinchorro mortuary behavior.
