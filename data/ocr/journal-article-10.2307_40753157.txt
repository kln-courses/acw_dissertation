<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gentiles and Jewish Studies* Shaye J. D. Cohen In this brief essay I would like to address the question of the place of gentiles within Jewish Studies. In the past thirty years or so, many gen- tile scholars have taken an interest in Jewish Studies, and their number seems to be increasing. What are the implications of this development, and how should Jews react to it? Allow me to circumscribe my topic. By "gentiles," I mean primarily Christians in Europe and America; what place Muslims might have within Jewish Studies, whether in Israel or elsewhere, is a separate ques- tion that does not concern me here. By "Jewish Studies" (also called "Judaic Studies") I mean the critical study of Jewish texts and Jewish history, known in German as Wissenschaft des Judentums and in He- brew as mada'ei ha-yahadut. I do not discuss the study of the Tanak (what Christians call the Old Testament), which has long been cultivated by Christians and is not necessarily part of "Jewish Studies." The founder of Wissenschaft des Judentums, Leopold Zunz (1794- 1886) believed that the critical study of Judaism should have a place at the university. In both 1843 and 1848 he petitioned the Prussian Minis- ter of Education to create a professorial chair in Berlin for Jewish litera- ture and history (jüdische Literatur und Geschichte). On 4 December 1848 the faculty of the University of Berlin relayed to the Prussian Min- ister its decision to reject the request on the grounds that such a profes- sorship would serve "to strengthen Jewish existence in its particularity, and give spiritual support to its alienating laws and usages" (das jü- dische Wesen in seiner Besonderheit, seinen entfremdenden Gesetzen * I am grateful to the organizer of the conference, Prof Dr. Peter Schäfer, for the invitation to participate and for his gracious hospitality. In revising the text for pub- lication I have retained a "lecture" format and kept annotation to a minimum. The goal of this little piece is to stimulate reflection on an important and sensitive issue; I am under no illusion that I have made any original scholarly contribution to the study of Wissenschaft des Judentums.

Cohen JSQ 3 und Gebräuchen geistig zu stützen).1 More than twenty years later, re- jected by the state, Jews imbued with the Zunzian spirit founded the Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums, which opened in Berlin in 1872. If the study of Judaism could not have a home in the university, it would have to have a home of its own. In the conflict between Zunz and the faculty of the University of Berlin we may discern two contrasting visions of Judaism and Jewish culture. For Zunz, Wissenschaft des Judentums belonged in a university. Similarly Moritz Steinschneider (1816-1907), one of the greatest Jewish scholars of the age, believed that "Jewish Studies could attain its proper direction and its appropriate recognition only in the context of the uni- versity" (daß die Wissenschaft des Judentums nur innerhalb des Ver- bandes der Universität die rechte Pflege und die ihr gebührende Aner- kennung erlangen könne).2 The obvious implication of this view is that Jewish studies belongs to all. It is a Wissenschaft des Judentums, not a jüdische Wissenschaft or a Wissenschaft der Juden. The study of classi- cal Jewish texts by Christians should occasion no more surprise than the study of Catholic texts by Lutherans, Lutheran texts by Catholics, or pagan texts (like Homer, Sophocles, Plato, and Aristotle) by Christians. At least in theory, then, gentiles too could be the students and prac- titioners of Wissenschaft des Judentums. I do not know if either Zunz or Steinschneider explicitly drew this conclusion from their own concep- tions, but the implications are clearly there.3 On 19 October 1907, the Hochschule (then called Lehranstalt) für die Wissenschaft des Judentums dedicated its new building in Berlin on Artilleriestraße 14 (now Tucholskystraße 6). The main speech on that occasion was given by Sigmund Maybaum (1844-1919), a professor at the Hochschule. Maybaum, born and educated in Hungary, spent most 1 On this episode see S[igmund] Maybaum, "Die Wissenschaft des Judentums," Monatsschrift für die Geschichte und Wissenschaft des Judentums 51 (1907) 641- 658; Nahum N.

Ismar Schorsch, From Text to Context (Brandéis University Press/University Press of New England, 1994) 353. 3 In Encyclopaedia Judaica 16:1237-1238, s. v. Zunz, N. Glatzer writes the following concerning Zunz's first work, Etwas über die rabbinische Literatur (published in 1818): "In his proposed research program both Jews and non- Jews would join, the non- Jews' contribution being but a continuation of the scientific work of previous eras." Since Glatzer knew Zunz's work intimately, I have no doubt that Zunz somewhere said some- thing that justifies Glatzer's statement, but I cannot find such a passage in Zunz's Etwas über die rabbinische Literatur.</page><page sequence="3">(1996) Gentiles and Jewish Studies 187 of his adult life in Berlin; he is buried in the row of honor (Ehrenreihe) at the Jewish cemetery in Weißensee. He is best known to Jewish scholar- ship for his book on anthropomorphic and anthropopathic expressions in Onqelos and the other Targumim, but he is also the author of a biography of Zunz, published in 1894. It is safe to say that in his ded- icatory speech, entitled "Die Wissenschaft des Judentums," Maybaum is speaking from a Zunzian perspective. Maybaum declares explicitly and unambiguously that the study of Judaism is not a Jewish enterprise (die Wissenschaft des Judentums ist vor allem keine jüdische Wissenschaft) and that it can be built up and advanced also by non- Jews (die Wis- senschaft des Judentums auch von NichtJuden angebaut und gefördert werden kann).4 In 1907 the only evidence Maybaum could cite for the latter statement was Christian scholarship on the Hebrew Bible (even if he also lamented its Christian biases). No doubt he would have been happy to cite more. While the university was the proper home for Wissenschaft des Ju- dentums, it was not the proper home for the training of rabbis. Abraham Geiger (1810-1874) wanted a chair in Jewish Theology (jüdische Theo- logie) at the University of Berlin; just as the university trains ministers for the church, it should train rabbis for the synagogue. Zunz, in con- trast, wanted a chair not in Theology but in Jewish Literature and His- tory.5 Maybaum, following Zunz, says explicitly that rabbis should not be trained at universities; he even suggests that German universities would do well to follow the model of the universities of democratic North America and not support theological faculties at all.6 (This re- markable suggestion, that German universities should follow the model of American universities, was made at the heyday of German influence on American academia! Perhaps Maybaum simply is trying to make the best of his situation - by 1907 the Hochschule had become primarily a rabbinical seminary.)7 In any event, if the university setting implies that the study of Judaism is to be open to gentiles, then rabbis clearly need to be trained in some other setting. 4 Maybaum, "Wissenschaft," 643-644. On Maybaum see Glatzer, Encyclopaedia Judaica 11.1142-1143. 5 On the contrast between Geiger and Zunz, see Richarz, Eintritt, 192-193. 6 Maybaum 651. There may also be some "sour grapes" too: if we Jews can't have a university chair, then you Christians shouldn't have one either. On p. 650, Maybaum states that Zunz decided to approach the Prussian government for a chair only after failure to establish separate Lehranstalten. Today, concludes Maybaum, we don't need the university for Wissenschaft des Judentums because we have Lehranstalten.</page><page sequence="4">188 Shaye J. D. Cohen JSQ 3 Opposing Zunz was the faculty of the University of Berlin. For them to be German meant to be Christian; therefore Jewish culture was not part of German culture; therefore Jewish Studies was by definition an extension of Jewish parochialism. The study of Jewish texts is for Jews and for Jews alone; Jewish texts do not belong in a university because they say nothing to non- Jews (except, of course, insofar as they help Christians understand Christianity). The exclusion of Wissenschaft des Judentums from the university, like the exclusion of Jewish students and professors,8 was a statement to the Jews of Germany that their eman- cipation would not be successful or complete as long as they wished to remain Jews. And, of course, the emancipation of German Jewry was not successful or complete; we all know how the story ends. The notion that Jewish Studies has interest only for Jews became entrenched in much of German scholarship. For example, in 1925 Hugo Gressmann (1877-1927), professor of (Lutheran) Theology at Berlin, published a pamphlet entitled Die Aufgaben der Wissenschaft des nachbiblischen Judentums? On p. 1 Gressmann writes that "Judaism in the Hellenistic-Roman period is of importance for us Christians in the first place because it was the period of the birth of Christianity" (Das Judentum der hellenistisch-römischen Zeit ist für uns Christen in erster Linie von Bedeutung, weil es die Werdezeit des Christentums war). Gressmann goes on to observe that all historians must interest them- selves in the phenomenon of Judaism as a factor in world civilization, but this phenomenon does not include rabbinic Judaism, because rabbi- nic Judaism had no influence on outsiders. Thus, from the period after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE, the only forms of Judaism that Christian scholars need to study are: Jewish magic and the worship of Iao (pp. 10-16); the worship of YHWH-Dionysus (pp. 16-19); astral re- ligion (pp. 19-23); Christian gnosticism (pp. 23-24); Mandaism (pp. 24- 28); the Odes of Solomon; and Manicheanism. Rabbinic Judaism is con- spicuously absent. From the Jewish perspective, all the Jewish (?) phe- nomena highlighted by Gressmann are marginal, peripheral to the on- going history of Judaism, but for Gressmann they are the only ones of the post-70 period that are worth studying by a Christian. Rabbinic literature, too late to be of real use in the study of the Hellenistic and New Testament periods (p. 5), can be ignored. It has no interest to non- Jews. As Steinschneider remarked, "the greatest injustice of Christians consisted and still does in the fact that they have never studied Judaism 8 Richarz, Eintritt; Schorsch, "Jewish Academics at Prussian Universities," Text, chapter 3. y Giessen: A. Topelmann, 1925, a repnnt from ZAW 43 (1925).</page><page sequence="5">( 1 996) Gentiles and Jewish Studies 1 89 either then or now for its own sake, but only because of its relationship to Christianity."10 To be fair to Gressmann and the others of his tribe, I must note that many Jewish scholars too would have conceded that Talmud and ancient rabbinic literature has no interest to non- Jews. Zunz himself regarded Talmud (and Kabbalah) as outside the purview of Wissenschaft des Ju- dentums11; after all, the main point of his first scholarly essay in 1818, Etwas über die rabbinische Literatur, was to extend the notion of rabbinic beyond Talmud and halachic literature. In the riches of medieval Jewish philosophy, poetry, grammer, science, belles-lettres, etc. the criti- cal study of Judaism would find ample material appropriate for a uni- versity setting. A similar point was made by Harry Wolfson one hundred years after Zunz' s publication of Etwas über die rabbinische Literatur: I do not mean to imply that I consider medieval Jewish philosophy to be the most important field of Jewish study. Hardly that. For I believe, just as our pious ancestors believed, though for different reasons, that the Talmud with its literature is the most promising field of study, the most fertile field of original research and investigation. But I believe that medieval Jewish philosophy is the only branch of Jewish literature, next to the Bible, which binds us to the rest of the literary world. In it we meet on common ground with civilized Europe and with part of civilized Asia and civilized Africa.12 The Talmud is the most fertile field for Jewish research, but the Talmud does not bind the Jew to the rest of the literary world. Thus Zunz and Wolfson would agree with Gressmann that the Talmud does not have any interest or importance for non- Jews, but would argue strongly that there is much in post-Talmudic Jewish literature and tradition that ought to interest non- Jews. In 19th-century Germany Jewish Studies did not enter the university because, as stated by the faculty of the University of Berlin, Jewish Studies were seen as of concern only to Jews, a function of Jewish partic- ularity (Besonderheit). The only reason "we Christians" (I adopt this phrase from Gressmann) would study it is that it might help us under- stand Christianity. In marked contrast, in recent years in the United States and, to a lesser extent in Europe, Jewish Studies have entered the university in a major way. There is scarcely a large or prestigious university in the USA that does not offer at least some courses in Judaic Studies, and many universities have full and variegated programs. In 10 Schorsch, Text 164. Glatzer, EJ 16:1240. Zunz, of course, agreed that Talmud study was important for the education of rabbis, but he opposed pilpul as well as the leadership of unenlightened rabbis whose education had consisted entirely of Talmud study; see Schorsch, Text 243. iZ Menorah Journal 7 (1921) 32, cited in Schorsch, Text 373.</page><page sequence="6">190 Shay e J. D. Cohen JSQ 3 theory, the presence of Jewish Studies on university campuses is testi- mony to the triumph of Zunz's vision. And surely the greatest sign of that triumph is the sight of a gentile studying or teaching Jewish Studies. The presence of gentiles would seem to indicate that the field holds interest and appeal not merely for Jews but also for all people, and that the field has attained normality within the humanities. However, my impression is that in reality Zunz's vision is not yet triumphant. Gentiles in Jewish Studies are seen by Jews - and perhaps by the gentiles themselves - not as a vindication of the universal appeal of Jewish texts and culture but as anomalies, curiosities that provoke amazement and puzzlement. I do not have any surveys or evidence to support this asser- tion; I have only my own impressions of the field. And if gentile scholars are seen as odd or problematic in Jewish Studies in general, they cer- tainly are so regarded in the study of rabbinic literature and religion, the heartland of classical Judaism. Perhaps the roots of the Jewish ambivalence on this point are evident already in Zunz's exclusion of the Talmud from Wissenschaft des Juden- tums. Jewish law, culture, and history provide many reasons for exclud- ing gentiles from the study of the Talmud, and perhaps these reasons have been internalized by Jews and applied to Jewish studies generally. What are the reasons for Jewish opposition to, or unease with, the study of Talmud in particular, and the study of Judaica generally, by gentiles? First, there is a well-entrenched Jewish tradition that opposes the study of Torah by gentiles. R. Yohanan said: a gentile who studies the Torah is liable to the death penalty (B. Sanhédrin 59a). (Of course, the Talmud goes on to quote the view of R. Meir: a gentile who studies the Torah resembles the high priest.) According to the Zohar even prospec- tive converts should not be permitted to study Torah! Whether or not the Talmudic category of "gentile" applies to Christians, does not much matter; a prominent strand of rabbinic culture clearly believes that gen- tiles simply have no business studying the Torah of the Jews. Why not? Because the Torah, especially the Oral Torah, belongs to Jews, not gen- tiles. It is ours, not theirs (if, like Gressmann, I too may be permitted to speak in the first-person plural). In an often-cited passage the Tanhuma claims that the oral Torah (specifically the Mishnah) is God's secret or mystery (mysteriori) by which he is able to distinguish the true Israel from the false. After all, gentiles (Christians) possess the written Torah just as Jews do; only the Jews, however, possess the Oral Torah, the secret password. When a gentile studies rabbinic texts the boundary line between Jews and gentiles becomes blurred.</page><page sequence="7">( 1 996) Gentiles and Jewish Studies 1 9 1 Second, we Jews simply don't trust Christian scholars. In medieval times, of course, the goal of Christian scholars was to convert Jews to Christianity. Indeed, the impetus for much of medieval and early mod- ern Christian Hebraism was the desire to find rabbinic passages that would support the claims of Christianity against those of Judaism. In modern times Christian missionary zeal may have abated, but many Christian scholars have felt - and some still feel - a need to demonstrate the superiority of Christianity to Judaism.13 Similarly, we Jews fear that we may be embarrassed by what gentiles will find in our sacred texts: they will make fun of us. Jerome sneers at the fabulae aniles of the Pharisees (= the rabbis), and his medieval continuators followed his lead.14 Perhaps the most learned of these continuators was also the most vitriolic Jew-hater: I refer to Johann Eisenmenger (1654-1704). In his Entdecktes Judenthum, a two thousand page anthology of pas- sages from ancient and medieval rabbinic literature (and much else), Eisenmenger attempted to prove the stupidity, superstitiousness, and wickedness of the Jews. Even the rabbis of antiquity were aware that some laws and traditions (notably those that discriminate against gen- tiles) would provoke ire or derision from gentiles.15 In the twentieth century many German rabbis opposed L. Goldschmidt's translation of the Babylonian Talmud into German, on the grounds that the transla- tion would make it easier for gentiles to mock Judaism.16 Third, and last, a reason born not of history but of contemporary society. Many American Jews want Jewish Studies to be included on the curricula of American universities not to prove that Jews "belong" or have "arrived," but because they think that courses in Jewish Studies are an effective way to keep Jewish students Jewish. Courses in Jewish Studies will enhance Jewish identity and provide opportunities for Jew- ish students to meet each other. In other words, Jewish Studies are a form of ethnic studies or "minority" studies. The expectation in such courses is that the instructor and the bulk of the students will be mem- 13 George Foot Moore, "Christian Writers on Judaism," Harvard Theological Re- view 14 (1921) 197-254; Charlotte Klein, Theologie und Anti- Judaismus (München: Kaiser, 1975), available in English as Anti- Judaism in Christian Theology (Philadel- phia: Fortress, 1978). On Christian views of the Talmud (that is, rabbinic tradition) in ancient and medieval times, see Ch. Merchavia, The Church versus Talmudic and Midrashic Lit- erature 500-1248 (Jerusalem: Bialik Institute, 1970; Hebrew). Y.

For knowledge of the rabbinic opposition to Goldschmidt, I am indebted to Ismar Schorsch, in conversation.</page><page sequence="8">192 Shay e J. D. Cohen JSQ 3 bers of the ethnic group that is being studied. (How many courses in Afro-American studies are taught by non-Afro- Americans? How many courses in Chicano studies are taught by non-Chicanos? How many courses in women's studies are taught by men? The answer to all these is: not many.) In these courses, the professor is not only the instructor but also, willingly or unwillingly, a role model for his/her students. This chemistry is destroyed the moment a non-minority member teaches the course. Many, perhaps most, of the professors of Jewish Studies in the United States do not see themselves as Jewish role models, and do not see their courses as vehicles for strengthening the Jewish identity of their Jewish students, but the consumers of these courses, that is, the under- graduates and their parents, persist in seeing Jewish Studies as a form of ethnic studies. In my experience, the vast majority of students in the vast majority of courses in Jewish Studies are Jews (except, perhaps, for courses on the Holocaust, which attract a large number of gentiles). If, indeed, Jewish Studies are a form of ethnic studies, gentiles have no place in these classrooms. Certainly they are welcome as students, but as professors they are anomalous and simply do not fit. They cannot be role models for their students, and it seems odd to expect gentile pro- fessors to concern themselves with enhancing the Jewish identity of their Jewish students. Thus, irony of ironies, American Jews fundamentally agree with the faculty of the University of Berlin: Jewish Studies are for Jews, an affirmation of Jewish particularity and parochialism. While strengthening Jewish particularity was unacceptable to the faculty of the University of Berlin in the middle of the nineteenth century, at the end of the twentieth century it is seen as a positive good by American Jews, and tolerated by a minority-conscious and politically-correct American society. So, for any number of reasons, Zunz's vision has not yet triumphed. The day that the appointment of gentiles to professorships of Jewish Studies, with a specialization in rabbinic texts and rabbinic culture, will not excite comment except concerning the professor's scholarly qua- lifications for the position, is the day that will mark the ultimate vindi- cation of Zunz's vision. That day is surely coming; as more and more gentiles study Judaism and become masters of rabbinic texts, their nor- mality, and indeed, the normality of the field of Jewish Studies, will be taken for granted. I hope that this conference, held in Zunz's city, will help us all attain that goal.17 17 Of course, in Germany for the forseeable future the long shadow of the Holocaust will prevent Jewish Studies from attaining a state of normality. I hope that my German colleagues will address this issue.</page></plain_text>
