<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARON: A MYTHOLOGICAL STUDY' BY CHARLES B. NEWCOMER In the ninth book of the Odyssey Homer makes Odysseus describe at some length that wonderful wine with which he sub- dued the Cyclops Polyphemus. It had such strength and sweet- ness that it was drunk mixed with twenty parts of water. Soon after setting out homeward from Troy, Odysseus and his men landed on the coast of Thrace and plundered the Ciconian city Ismarus (later called Maronea).2 As a reward for sparing the shrine of Apollo, Odysseus received twelve jars of this wine from his priest Maron, Euanthes' son. Odysseus says Od. ix. 196 ff.: &amp;TaLp a'tyEov LaKOlv Exov /LtEAavos otVOLO 'S0os, 3'V /0L ESWKE Mcapwv E1~cav0Eos v'o'0, t 'A 7r o' A w v o s, 's ' Icr4apov &amp;MIt,8E,8I1KEWV. The scholiasts thought it strange that Homer did not connect Dionysus, the wine-god, with this passage, which treats especially of wine, and that he did not make Maron the priest of Dionysus rather than of Apollo. This perplexity was caused, as I believe, by their misunderstanding the word d'av6O js, originally an epithet of Dionysus. Now, cuav6ws, "blooming," might easily become, with changed accent, Ev'dzv6s, the "Blooming One," a fitting name for Dionysus, the god of vegetation. Athenaeus, quoting from Phanodemus, gives evidence in favor of this view. He says, xi. 465 a, that the Athenians ro0e'VrTE9v oV'V T- Kpaoret ev ja v 6e,LEXVTOV T7'O Atovvcrov, XOPEVOVT6E9 KaI taKavcXoiv're Evaa v6 Ka-atOv- pai,i30ov Kaa IaKXEvTa\ KaV /pot ',ttov. Here eviav6O is manifestly an epithet of Dionysus. But not all the ancients misunderstood the name "Euanthes." Euripides in the Cyclops makes Maron a son of Dionysus, fol- lowing, as I think, the 'O8varor--, a lost drama of Cratinus. For Pollux vi. 26 says that Cratinus called wine "maron," quoting ' Read at the Classical Conference at Ann Arbor, Mich., March 30, 1906. 2 Cf. Newcomer De Cyclope (Berlin, 1899), p. 20.

NEWCOMER the following, which Bergk correctly ascribes to this play (Kock C.A.F., Cratini 135): oi7rCO "tov rtooviTov ov'&amp; vi`o,zat Mapcova. Here we must suppose the Cyclops acquainted with wine, but not such as Odysseus had doubtless just mentioned under the new name of "maron." Similarly in Homer the Cyclops calls the wine given him by Odysseus "a distillation of ambrosia and nectar" (Od. ix. 359). Since, therefore, the name "maron" can signify wine, it must have been associated in some way with Dionysus; as, e. g., the name of his son or priest. Cratinus then followed Homer; for this is in accord with Homer's very words, "Maron, son of Euanthes, priest of Apollo," if, as we contend, Euanthes is Dionysus. But we have further testinmony. Theophilus (Ad Autolycun ii, p. 94) makes Satyrus call Maron the son of Ariadne and Dionysus. This in turn agrees with the scholium on Od. ix. 197: Madpwv Evdavovo vo's, o 8&amp; Evadcv6f v[o Atovt'cov. Hesiod, too, seems to have associated Maron with Dionysus; for the scholiast on Od. ix. 198 says: X 8' A7ro'Tacrts( po`s 'EHto0ov Xe6- eyovra ~v Mdpwva swaWt Oiowvo9 roVi Atovicoov. Further, the scholiast on Apollonius Rhodius iii. 997 says that according to some both Euanthes and Oenopion were sons of Dionysus and Ariadne: KaTaXACELt7rcTat yap &lt; 'Apt'83v?7&gt; MMwo ec&amp;0o9 v Ncwr 8&amp;a7re7rap0e'vEvTat 8&amp; v7ro Atovvoov KaTa Ttva, et es 7rauSo7otet 0 1vo7rcwwva, eo0aVra, Y.TdcovXov, AdTpa,uvv, Evr'dv0, Tavpo'7roXtv. From this series of old traditions we learn that Maron was the son or grandson of Dionysus. But how might Maron, son of the wine-god, become priest of Apollo, the god of soothsaying, at this ancient shrine of Ismarus? Let us consider the association of Dionysus with Apollo at other shrines. In Greek religion the gods were largely made after the image of the worshipers. While they were anthropomorphic, they were also superhuman-mightier than men, whom they might benefit or harm according to their pleasure. Men courted their good- will and invoked their assistance, feared their wrath and sought to appease it. Thus many men of various iieeds and in various circumstances and places prayed to one god, who then came into</page><page sequence="3">MARON: A MYTHOLOGICAL STUDY 195 the possession of many attributes. Witness the numerous epi- thets and by-names applied to any popular divinity. Apollo.-The attributes and characteristics of Apollo are especially manifold. He appears as sea-god, sky-god, and earth- god. The meaning of the word "Apollo" is uncertain; hence we get no light as to the origin of the god from its derivation. There is a tradition that sailors carried the worship of their pro- tecting sea-god to Crisa and Delphi; cf. Preller-Robert Griech. Myth., pp. 257 f. Possibly they came from Crete, where Apollo Delphinius was worshiped; CIG. 255. 4: Ev K vcocro E' vco tepco rc 'A7ro'XXUw)Vo9 T AEXcvLW. At Delphi the cult of Apollo super- seded that of the chthonic oracle god Pytho. Poetically expressed, Apollo slew the python. But as god of oracles he only expressed the will of Zeus, and that too through the priestess Pythia. Much missionary work was done from Delphi. Wherever the worship of Apollo was introduced into other parts of Greece, he was said to kill the native god or hero and take his place. But in each case he would assume some of the functions of the native god. Thuls Apollo appears as the god of farming, vegetation, spring; of cattle-raising, the chase, growing youth; of the palaestra, strife, and battle; of oracles, oaths, treaties; of expi- ation, healing, as dispeller of all evil; of music, dancing; of death; of sea-faring, capes and mountains, colonization, commerce; of light, the sun. Dionysus.- More is known of the origin of Dionysus. Kretschmer derives the name from Ato' and vvfro9, the Thracian word for "son." See Aus der Anomia, pp. 22 f.; cf. v6odrd= VW40fq, Ko'p, and NviXat, the "Maidens" oil the Sophilus vase, Ath. Mitth., XIV (1889), Taf. I; also the inscription Atos' 4s'W, "Zeus's man," "hero," applying to the child Dionysus on a black-figured vase, Minervini Monum. Ined. de R. Baroze, tav. I. Semele, the reputed mother of Dionysus, as Kretschmer has shown (pp. 18-22), was a Phrygio-Thracian earth-nymph, whom the Greeks localized at Thebes. In fact, the word 1,2E/e'Xf7 means " earth ;" cf. Slav. zemlja (in Nova Zembla, "New Earth"), Gk. X0wv (Xa,ukat XOaFuaXo9), Lat. humus (humilis), "earth," homo (huma-nus), A.-S. and Goth. guma, "man."</page><page sequence="4">196 CHARLES B. NEWCOMER There is manifold evidence that Dionysus came comparatively late into Greek religion, and that he immigrated from Thrace. He is pre-eminently a nature-god and, like Demeter and Cora, comes and goes with the seasons-has his epiphanies and reces- sions. Homer mentions Dionysus in but one passage, the Glaucus episode in the sixth book of the Iliad, considered by some critics as a late addition. Here he is not yet an Olympian, but may be frightened by the wrath of the mortal Lycurgus, and flees to Thetis for refuge. Later we find him represented among the Olympian gods-e. g., on the frieze of the Parthenon. Vase- painters of the sixth century B. c. picture his triumphal entry into the assembly of the Olympians; cf. Miss Harrison, Pro- legomena, pp. 366 f. The historians all ascribe to Dionysus a Thracian origin, while the poets influenced, no doubt, by the patriotism and vanity of the Greeks, who were averse to acknowledging a barbariall origin for so popular a divinity make him a native of Thebes who returns in triumph after wandering to the far East. Herodotus (v. 7) says of the Thracians: OIEOvs' 8E a6,3o0VTat ,uovov9 TOVO8&amp;E "ApEa Kcab/ Ato'vvov Kcab "ApT'rEtv. In another passage (viii. 111) he gives an account of a famous oracle shrine of Dionysus situated upon the mountain heights of the unconquered Satrae. The priests were chosen from the tribe called Bessi. As at Delphi, it was a priestess that pronounced the oracles. Since this people remained unconquered for hundreds of years, we may believe that Dionysus was their native god. His oracle, which remained famous till Roman times, is referred to by Euripides in Hecuba 1267: o Oprj7 ,udvrt9 ELa E AtOPVo09 Ta8E. Pausanias (ix. 30. 9) says that the people of Libethra, a city on the Macedonian side of Mount Olympus, received an oracle sent from Dionysus in Thrace. This must be the famous Thracian Dionysus just considered. Amphiclea was an ancient city lying to the north of Mount Parnassus. In x. 33. 11 Pau- sanias tells of an oracle shrine situated there, 7rpodlaTtg &amp;e 0 LEpEV9 EOfTt, %pa Be ECK TOVEOV d'Ka'To%o9. The fact should be noted that Dionysus advances southward upon Grecian territory, and that he still preserves his prophetic gift. We find him next on</page><page sequence="5">MARON: A MYTHOLOGICAL STUDY 197 Mount Parnassus sharing with his brother Apollo the temple at Delphi. The worship of Dionysus greatly fascinated the Greek mind, and soon spread over all Greece. The ruins of theaters in every considerable Greek city are witness to the spread of his religion; for the performances of dramas in his honor were acts of public worship. In Attica Dionysus was more especially the god of intoxicating wine and the accompanying joys; while in the Delphic cult-myth he was still considered rather as a nature-god, the god of vegetation and animal life; and as such he died and had to be called back to life every second year by the thyads. Pausanias says (x. 4. 3): at 8E Vta8cE&amp; yvvatKE9 uev Edotv 'ATTt- Kai' fotTrco-at 8E E9 TV UIapvaoov 7rapa't &amp;9 aVrTa' TE Kat at 7yvvatKe9 AEfx\oJV a7yovotv o6pyta Atovifco.

The worship of Apollo is not only partly super- seded by that of Dionysus, but is contaminated as well. At Delphi the three winter months (Dadophorius, Poetropius, Amatlius) were sacred to Dionysus. During this time Apollo was said to be banished among the Hyperboreans, and the Del- phians invoked Dionysus back to life, especially under the name Zagreus. Cf. Plutarch De et apud Delphos 9: &lt;KL0oVv60o&gt; ' T'V AEAXfv OV8EV TTrrov ' Tp A7roXXwvL /ETE(TTLV.

During the rest of the year they sang paeans to Apollo at their sacred festivals. Recent excavations at Delphi have brought to light an inscription containing a paean to Dionysus. This is further evidence that the conception of the two gods was con- fused. See Weil Bull. corr. hel. XIX (1895), p. 398. Dionysus then was the vicar of Apollo, and, as Plutarch says, had no less interest in Delphi than Apollo himself. The grave of Dionysus was shown at the omphalus in the cella of the temple, where the priests brought secret offerings about the time of the winter</page><page sequence="6">198 CHARLES B. NEWCOMER solstice, when the thyads raise up Licnites (the babe Dionysus); cf. Plut.

On the east pediment of the Apollo temple at Delphi, Apollo and the muses were represented; on the west, Dionysus with the thyads. On a vase in the St. Petersburg Hermitage Museum (Cat. 1807), Apollo and Dionysus are represented shaking hands in front of a palm tree, surrounded by Bacchic worshipers, and with a filleted omphalus in the foreground. This represents a brotherly meeting of the two gods-perhaps Dionysus welcoming Apollo upon his biennial return; see Helbig Archaeolog. Zeit. XXIV (1866), pp. 185 f., with P1. 211. In the Athenian festi- val known as the City Dionysia the lyric preceded the dramatic performance. The victorious choregi of lyric choruses received a tripod. These facts show reminiscences of an older Apollo cult. The relationship of Dionysus to Apollo at Delos was on a similar footing. Hauvette-Besnault Bull. corr. hel. VII (1883), pp. 103 ff., gives ten choregic inscriptions from Delos, all of similar formula, being a record of the annual religious festival. In each case after the date, given by the archon's name, and the words V'yt'Eta Kait EVET?/pa EYeVPETO ("there has been good health and a prosperous year"), there follow: o7&amp;e exopr77y7o-av ebd 'A7roXX'vta (names of choregi); d9 AtovVita (names of a chorus of boys); and finally, o't&amp; 6'7re&amp;E$ZaVTo Tp Oea (names of actors, musicians, and other performers). It is to be noted that here again the Apollonia, always mentioned first, correspond to the older lyric portion of the Athenian state festival, and the Dionysia to the later dramatic portion. An inscription (1G. II. 570) giving an account of disburse- ments of the Attic deme Plothea contains the items: "for the Apollonia 1,100 drachmas, for the Pandia 600 drachmas." The Pandia at Athens were the last act in the City Dionysia; Mommsen Feste d. Stadt Athen, p. 433, n. 1. If the same may be inferred for Plothea, we have here again the same order of</page><page sequence="7">MARON: A MYTHOLOGICAL STUDY 199 development as at Athens: first the lyric, then the dramatic part of the celebration. Phlya was a rich Attic deme situated some five miles northeast of Athens in a fertile district capable of supporting a large popu- lation. This was the birthplace of Euripides, and, I think, the home of the old Attic family of the Lycomids, who performed mystic rites here. The orgies of the Great Goddess, Earth, with Bacchic mysteries, were said to have been celebrated here even before the mysteries were instituted at Eleusis. Here were altars and temples of many gods and goddesses. Pausanias (i. 31. 4) mentions altars of "Flowery" ("AvOtoL) Dionysus and of "Dionysus- given" (Atovoo0'os0T) Apollo. This Apollo has been identified with the "Laureled" (Aavf0poposa) Apollo at Phlya mentioned by other writers; cf. Plut. Them. 15; Herod. viii. 11. Just what relationship this Dionysus-given Apollo had to Dionysus himself may not be evident, but the epithet proves some association of the two gods. The Homeric instance of the union of Dionysus and Apollo is too early either to explain their connection in Greece or to be explained as the result of missionary influence from Delphi. For Rohde (Psyche, pp. 295 ff.) gives much ancient testimony and cogent arguments showinig how the orgiastic worship of the Thracian god was introduced comparatively late into Greece; and how it contaminated the cult of Apollo. But at Ismarus it is not at once evident which god first pos- sessed the shrine. If Ismarus was originally a Greek colony with pure Apollo-worship, Dionysus doubtless won his claims as he did later in Greece. But if Dionysus was the original possessor of the shrine at Ismarus, the Apollo-worship must have been introduced by Greeks. This might have been a slow and peace- ful conquest, a matter of education. If so, the partisans of Dionysus had sufficient influence to retain their priest Maron, the reputed son or grandson of Dionysus (Euanthes), while Apollo became the god of both parties. But conquest also might bring about a similar result; for conquerors often reverently spared the shrines of peoples they subjugated. Thus Apollo, the god of the victorious invaders,</page><page sequence="8">200 CHARLES B. NEWCOMER might take up his abode in the old Dionysus temple, retaining the old servants and even the priest. At any rate, such a cus- tom prevailed in the middle of the fifth century B. a., for the Athenian decree establishing a colony at Brea in Thrace expressly commands the colonists: Ta 8 &amp;e TEE?77TN ia ptpe'va a"v KaOd'nEp g0-T, Kcat aXXa ,/Z TE/LEVL'EIV; 1G. I. 31; Hicks2 41; Dittenberger2 19; Roberts-Gardner Inscriptions of Attica 8. We have seen that Apollo and Dionysus were brothers, and as such possessed many attributes in common. They might share a common temple or receive the homage of the same worshipers at religious functions. The shrine at Ismarus presents us the most ancient instance of their union.
