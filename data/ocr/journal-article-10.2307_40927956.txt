<plain_text><page sequence="1">Driving Deeper into That Thing The Humanity of Heiner Goebbels's Stifters Dinge Gelsey Bell Entering the expansive hall in the Park Avenue Armory in New York City, all I could see were metal stairs leading up the back of a makeshift theatre, much like the ramp into an alien space- craft on a Hollywood set. Despite the distant and ominous reverberations bouncing through the cavernous space, it was my footsteps, and those of the audience members in front of me, that lay the heavy tone upon the afternoon. The pace was slow and felt preparatory rather than tired. Once at the top of the stairs, I was cloaked in almost complete darkness - a stark contrast to the bright afternoon sun hitting the fresh white snow on the city streets I had just walked in from. Turning a corner, I found myself at the top of the small set of bleacher seats facing the dimly lit stage, only 165 seats in all. Though my eyes were taking their time adjusting to the darkness that obscured the enormity of the hall, I could listen to the aural architecture1 as low metallic tones and wobbly mid-register melodies bounced off its vast balloon shed roof. The performance is Stifters Dinge (Stifter's Things), the latest music theatre work of com- poser and director Heiner Goebbels to cross the Atlantic from Germany. The piece is named for Adalbert Stifter, a 19th-century Romantic author who is little known outside of Germany (though a number of his works have been translated into English).2 Originally premiered in September 2007 at Théâtre Vidy in Lausanne, Switzerland, Stifters Dinge has since been traveling through- out Europe, with runs in such cities as Berlin, London, and Paris, as well as the Festival d'Avignon in France and BITEF (Belgrade International Theatre Festival) in Serbia (where it won the Grand Prix "Mira Trailovic") in 2008, and Croatia's World Theatre Festival in 2009. It finally made its way to the New World for five days in mid-December 2009, where I saw it on an uncharacteristically (for New York City) snow-white Sunday afternoon. Described by Goebbels as a "composition for five pianos with no pianists, a play with no actors, a performance without performers - one might say a no-man show" (2009b), Stifters Dinge's foundational claim to avantgarde inno- vation, and the original inspiration for its cre- ators, is an absence of human performers. But rather than fulfilling Samuel Beckett's dream of a theatre without actors by allowing the text to annihilate the performer,3 Goebbels and set and 1. Barry Blesserand Linda-Ruth Salter define hearing as "the detection of sound" and listening as "active attention or reaction to the meaning, emotions, and symbolism contained within the sound." Aural architecture denotes "the properties of a space that can be experienced by listening" (2007:5). 2. Born in 1805 in southern Bohemia, Stifter spent most of his life in Austria as a tutor and schulrat (elementary school supervisor), while he wrote novels and short stories until his death in 1868 (see Gump 1974). 3. "Not for me these Grotowskis and Methods. The best possible play is one in which there are no actors, only the text. I'm trying to find a way to write one."

Gelsey Bell is a doctoral candidate in the department of Performance Studies at Tisch School of the Arts/NYU, where she is working on a dissertation on 20th-century experimental vocal music. She is also an experimental vocalist a singer-songwriter, and TDR 's Managing Editor. i 1 2 150 Critical * -*-</page><page sequence="2">lighting designer Klaus Grünberg (a frequent collaborator) developed the show by working with tangi- ble materials - things like pianos and water. By choosing to highlight nonhuman activity for a live audi- ence, they created a meditation on objecthood and our relationship to things, materials, and the environ- ment. Composed of an 80-minute performance for a seated audience and then a 20- to 30-minute period in which the audience is encouraged to walk around the stage space for a closer look at its music-making landscape, the whole event is both performance and installation. The soundscape is dirty and mysterious. Dirty because the tones are impure, overflowing with illog- ical harmonics, and replete with low, gritty discordances. The music evokes enigma both metaphori- cally and literally. Metaphorically, the dissonant harmonies are struc- tured by a slow beating rhythm, with unanticipated rhythmic accents, that marks time in a con- tinuous machinelike pumping and evokes the cinematic thriller. (Waiting in my seat for the perfor- mance to "begin," I try to figure out what time signature the music is in. One moment it feels like 4/4 and the next 5/8, until I realize that it is simply a continuous ticking, broken into smaller divisions only by my Figure 1.

(Photo: Stephanie Berger/Lincoln Center) own creative listening.) in addition, I literally cannot tell how the sounds were being made. Directionally, it is clear that most of them are created live on the stage, but it is not easy to identify the individual parts that make the sonic whole. The set groans and hums like a waiting beast. Not necessarily an unkind beast, but a disfigured one - a patient monster half in the shadows, waiting until you are more accustomed to its presence, its natural rumblings, before it starts to really sing. The theatrical space is set up as a prosce- nium without the arch, clearly demarcating the audience from the stage rather than integrat- ing us. There is only the scaffolding and over- head grid between the stage and the expanse of the hall. Most of the stage floor is taken up with three rectangular cavities running con- secutively from front to back and parallel to the bleachers; they are filled with water shortly after the beginning of the piece. Flanking the pools on the right are four speakers, poised like heads on tall figurai stands. On the left are three glowing contraptions that appear to con- tain the water that fills the pools. Looming upstage are the most sculptural elements of the landscape: pianos, pipes, percussion, leafless trees, metal, and assorted mechanical gadgetry arranged in three layers of depth. The pianos 5 Hi. 151</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2. Heiner Goebbels's Stifters Dinge (2007), at Park Avenue Armory, New York City, December 2009. (Photo: Stephanie Berger/Lincoln Center) are in various states: four uprights and the body of one baby grand turned on its side, all with strings exposed, some with no keyboards, sil- ver mechanical arms rigged to rush across the strings, all prepared in one way or another. The pianos reinforce the decidedly steam punk aura of the whole thing - proud Victorian-era instruments shown in Frankensteinian derange- ment. Mechanical technology that - compared to the sleek digital sterility of today - seems somehow more organic, replete with dirt, rust, mold, even bacteria, as if the gilded-era Armory exists as a greenhouse for forests of wild pianos and steam-powered drums. However, despite the clear protagonists of the performance being the sonic-producing set and the tenacious "no-man show" mar- keting, the performance begins with two men spreading salt over the empty pools and then filling them with water. Though they do not linger, their appearance as technicians - a performance of non-performance, the under- stated attitude of "we're just doing our job" - highlights the backstage human hands that make the machine run. They remind the audi- ence that this is a fantastical human medita- tion on thingness and not the nonhuman in its natural element. They remind us of the light board operator, the usher seating latecomers, and then of ourselves, sinking farther into our seats. Have we gathered here because of our excitement for the void of human performance? What intellectual poetry is involved in such a feat? And what is brought into relief when technicians then walk amidst the performing scenery? For surely their jobs could have been automated as well. ..The technicians' presence begs the question, which I think the piece's creators wanted asked, How nonhuman is the performance of scenery, theatrical props, and musical instruments in this "no-man show"? Or, should I say, how human? Though there is a progression to the events in Stifters Dinge, the piece moves forward more like a dream than a story. Trying after- wards to recall the sequence, what came when is not only unclear but seems irrelevant. As if the experience was meant to mix in the head of the receiver, to give an overall impression of the show or to exhibit what this creation was capable of doing, rather than conclude along a linear line of logic or plot. This lack of story | 2 152</page><page sequence="4">is entirely appropriate for a consideration of the nonhuman, as it is humanity that inces- santly creates meaning and mythology. As Alan Bourassa relates, "the human is but the cre- ation of a system of meanings and values that must in large part be called literary. [...] There is no story without the human, no human with- out stories" (2002:60 -61). Furthermore, in a lecture about the piece, Goebbels quoted Gertrude Stein from Lectures in America say- ing, "anything that [is] not a story could be a play" (Goebbels 2009a; Stein [1935] 1985:119). Though Stifters Dinge is not void of the liter- ary, it uses music (which has always had a con- troversial relation to meaning)4 and technical and environmental performing objects to probe those phenomena that line the details of a story, that which is unknown and unknowable. A smooth intermixing of the natural, the mechanical, and the digital surfaces as the image of a map is projected over the pools, which as they gradually fill with water move our atten- tion from an artifact of human idealization to the graceful physicality of water. Subsequently, multiple screens the same length as the pools descend to dance with the shadows of rippling water. Soon one of the anthropomorphic speakers is spotlighted and the voice of a British actor reads an extract from Stifter's Die Mappe meines Urgi'ossvateì's (My Great Grandfather's Portfolio; specifically the third edition from 1867), while Jacob Isaacksz van Ruisdael's painting Swamp (1660) is projected on a screen and manipulated through different colors and saturations at a leisurely pace. The story, told in the first person, describes a sleigh ride in the countryside on a winter's day in which the travelers hear strange noises and eventually realize that they are caused by branches and trees falling over from the weight of ice that has collected on them: Now we recognized the noise that we had heard earlier in the air; it was not in the air, it was close to us now. In the depths of the forest it resounded near us and came from the twigs and branches as they splintered and fell to the ground. It was all the more dreadful as every- thing else stood motionless. Not a twig, not a pine needle stirred in the whole glittering brightness, until after an ice- fall a branch would come crashing down. Then all was silent again. We listened and stared; I don't know whether it was amazement or fear of driving deeper into that thing. (Stifter [1867] 2009) It is easy to see in this excerpt how the word "thing" becomes Stifter's placeholder for both the indescribable and the assemblage of min- ute detail his writings weave - details that tell the story using objects rather than descriptions of people. The spoken evocations of winter ice then melt into physical rain, which drips and flows onstage from above into the pools while one of the most intact uprights lazily performs a Figure 3.

As early as Plato's assertion in the Republic that rhythm and melody should conform to words in the composition of song (1997:1037, 2.400a), discussions of music have recognized a nondiscursive content that has the potential to either deface or transcend linguistic meaning.

For me, the scene sonically conjures reminiscences of childhood, staring out the window as the rain beats away at the glass and a family member site-reads a slow movement on the piano in the other room. Exceeding Gaston Bachelard's insight that "the house allows one to dream in peace" ([1958] 1964:6), I am able to gaze at my dreaming in hindsight, discerning how I have used (and continue to use) familiar natural and musi- cal elements in the creation of my own private mythology. Stifters Dinge performs a poetics of space that both encourages the dreams of its audience and grants time for considering how, why, and out of what those dreams emerge. With no actors to lead us through a story, our most intimate dramas have room to breathe. However, throughout the piece there are many recorded human voices that emerge from the nonhuman display, both ethno- graphic - incantations recorded in Papua New Guinea in 1905, antiphonal singing by Columbian Indians, a traditional Greek working song - and personality-driven - an interview on French radio with Claude Lévi- Strauss, William S. Burroughs reading from Nova Express, a television interview with Malcolm X. These voices occupy a paradoxi- cal function in regards to thingness. They are acousmatic - sounds cut off from their original source - and yet directly cited in the program and therefore historically traced. Depending on an audience member's knowledge, the timbre and cadences of both Malcolm X and Burroughs are unmistakable and we are told in projected subtitles that we are listening to Lévi-Strauss. The ethnographic record- ings are heard as such because they are songs in unknown languages (from my perspective) and are colored by the sonic qualities of early recording technology, sounding voices that are more distant and thin. And yet while the vocal- izations perform like fireflies from the archive, they can also animate objects, creating vocalic bodies5 of their anthropomorphic speakers and stands. Even where there was no visible speaker to attribute a voice to, Goebbels and his collab- orators chose a distinct location in the sound- scape (and thus our perception of the space) for the voice to emanate from. For instance, Malcolm X's voice seemed to come from the right side of the audience's seats, rather than a spotlighted speaker onstage. Unlike vision, sound is best understood in its verb form, as a doing, a sounding. It requires movement and force (and an appro- priate medium to transmit the waves of its doing, like air), and implies life. The reveal- ing thing about a music theatre meditation on objecthood (rather than a visual art one) is pre- cisely this relationship between object and the life that facilitates its sounding. The recorded voices, and their paradoxical existence as both disembodied and firmly bodied in technology, reveal our innate vococentrism, the tendency for our listening to prioritize the human voice over all other sounds (Chion [1982] 1999:5 -6), as well as our propensity to anthropomorphize objects by hearing their soundings as voices. We ascribe life-force to the sounding objects themselves if no outside force is immediately perceptible, and then ascribe voice to them as a way to understand them and consequently better entwine them in a power/knowledge dynamic. As Steven Connor explains: The voice that is heard in the thun- der, the eruption, or the whirlwind, is a kind of compromise formation. In that it is ascribed to a god, or simply to God, the voice transcends human powers of understanding and control; but the very fact that it is so ascribed also makes it possible to begin exercising control, in the very considerable form of conferring a name. To hear the thunder as a voice is to experience awe and terror; but to hear the voice in the thunder is also to have begun to limit the powers ofthat voice. (2000:25) However, Stifters Dinge strives to stage "a con- frontation with the unknown: with the forces that man cannot master" (Goebbels 2008), and manages to avoid that line where its expres- sion would degrade into mere symbolism or 5. Vocalic bodies are bodies formed by autonomous operations of a voice, as in the case of ventriloquism (see Connor 2000:35). +2 o Ò 154</page><page sequence="6">even metonymy. The recordings often appear in the topography of the performance like the rain does, as an object or environmental pro- cess - an idea, a melody, a historical citation - that is put into material and poetic play, rather than as a stand-in for human presence. However, this investigation of liveness and thingness is also seen to play upon the mobile racial line that objectifies the human in the Malcolm X sound bite.6 This racial context hints not only at the mutability of definitions of the human, the object, and their dialectic, but ultimately exposes these definitions as creating a false binary, which, just the same, fuels power dynamics. The finale of the performance (which most certainly inspired the title of the Guardian review "When Pianos Attack" [Connolly 2008]) erupts with the three layers of pianos, trees, and assorted industrial percussion rushing on tracks over the pools toward the audience, nois- ily producing their menacing soundtrack. As the rhythm changes and the collective heart- beat of the room slows, the pianos move slowly upstage again, revealing a bubbling bog in what before was clear water. I become fascinated with the behavior of the bubbles: how they sometimes grow, slide toward each other, and then pop when they finally touch. Throughout the performance there is a mix- ing of things that exist as instruments - objects that a person could control and that become both horrific and uncanny when they appear to take control of themselves, like the pianos - and as environmental processes - the activity of objects moved by outside forces that in turn aesthetically display the object's materiality, like the chemical change sparked when dry ice is dropped into water. As things go, the stakes of instrumentality are elegantly clear with musi- cal instruments, because they are created by humans to be used. In Stifters Dinge, most of the scenic instruments are single tones or per- cussion: something dragged along tile on the left side of the pool, two long pipes on the right side, a single amplified string, a sheet of metal, etc. However, the pianos (the materiality from which Goebbels began) are much more com- plicated. Historically, the modern piano and its consumer success are products of the industrial revolution (see Ripin et al. s.v. "Pianoforte"). Beginning in the Classical period, through the Romantic and early Modern era, until the recent ubiquity of the personal computer, the piano has been the dominant instrument in Western music. And as with all technologies, the unique attributes of the piano have influ- enced Western society as much as we have influenced it. One of these influences has been the development and subsequent pervasive- ness of equal temperament tuning, which was designed for the piano and has since greatly influenced how music is written and how other instruments are played.7 Equal temperament tuning was designed as a pragmatic philosoph- ical ideal to create a single uniform temper- ament for the piano, so that music could be played in any key without retuning. It compro- mises the natural acoustics of physics for con- venience and has ultimately altered what we hear as "correct" and the way music is "sup- posed" to be played. The prepared pianos of Stifters Dinge are, in a sense, intentionally out- of-tune and, as such, their sound displays a certain rebellion against the sound of human control that equal temperament epitomizes to our accustomed musical sense. 6. The objectification of a human into a "thing" is also noted in a Stifter excerpt published in the program but not included in the live performance. The quote refers to a shy young girl, "the dark girl from Nutmountain," who runs away from the others in the story, at which point a farmhand declares, "I'll catch that thing" ([1867] 2009). The program contains a wealth of textual material to leave one pondering before or after the performance. In addition to Goebbels program notes, the entire excerpt from Stifter's "Ice Story," and citations of the sound recordings, projections, and the Bach, there are two pages of quotes not integrated into the live performance. Three extracts from works by Stifter are interpenetrated by words from Jean-Paul Satre, Heinrich Mettler (who studied Stifter's work), and Michel Foucault (from The Order of Things, of course). 7. Equal temperament is a system of tuning where every musical interval has an identical frequency ratio. It is opposed to just intonation, where the frequency of notes is based on the ratio of whole numbers. Just intonation allows for a different character in each key and a purity of harmonics, whereas equal temperament affords uniformity to each musical interval. "Western music now exists under the dictatorship of this one homogenized temperament" (Jorgensen 1991:4). ca 155</page><page sequence="7">Figure 4. Heiner Goebbels's Stifters Dinge (2007), at Park Avenue Armory, New York City, December 2009. (Photo: Stephanie Berger/Lincoln Center) The environmental processes exemplified by the rain and fog harbor a different set of questions about humanity and control - a sub- lime quality of thingness that spirals into often spiritual dimensions. This dialectic between instrumental control and outside environmen- tal force sets the stage for an unexpected polit- ical dimension to naturally emerge from the piece's basic structure of inquiry. Many critics and audience members began to think precisely about the human relationship to climate change and the "natural" catastrophes scientists predict humanity's irresponsibility has and will cause. One fortuitous influence for this, at least in the short New York run, was the simultaneous UN Climate Summit in Copenhagen, which took place from 7 to 18 December 2009 and which had been declared by the Sunday after- noon when I saw the show an unfortunate fail- ure (see Vidal et al. 2009; Revkin and Broder 2009). In an interview with John Schaefer on National Public Radio (NPR), Goebbels declared this a "wonderful coincidence." He also explained that the piece was not created as a political statement, but that the ecologi- cal and ethnographic contexts came from the materials themselves: It came by working with the water, [...] it came by the wood and the metal and the space in which we performed and rehearsed [...], which is a much better way - if you get surprised by the con- text yourself - because then it means it's open also for all the different perspec- tives of the audience. [...] I'm not there to make a statement. [...] I'm just passing the questions which are actually raised up by the material itself, (in Schaefer 2009)8 Whether those questions found any answers or sparked new questions, or even exactly what 8. Goebbels has elsewhere stated: "I doubt that an artist has much of an influence on the political relevance of his artistic work. If art is too much on purpose, if its destination is too obvious, it loses certain qualities as artwork. [...] I think it's good that the artist does not completely control the political context of a performance" (in Gourgouris 2004:2). ■Í2 o 156</page><page sequence="8">those questions were, remains unknown and depends entirely on the journey of each indi- vidual audience member. It is in this way that the substantial human element of the piece is the human observer. What one hears and how one listens,9 in what way one makes sense or allows non-sense, depends entirely on one- self, and it is in this interior play that the drama unfolds (or doesn't). As Goebbels admitted, to a certain extent contradicting his own market- ing and exposing either ambivalence or ruse: "When people say there are no humans in the performance, they're mistaken. It's peo- ple that are at its centre - namely the audi- ence, who are empowered by it" (in Connolly 2008). Following the performance, I joined the rest of the audience in roaming around the mechanically sounding set and inspected its design with avid curiosity, a great sense of sat- isfaction washing over me when I got a closer look at the piano strings and understood what had been done. However, it wasn't until I left the thing that I could feel how the piece pro- pelled me. Crunching through the snow with echoes of metallic songs accompanying me like ghost images, I departed from the Armory and headed into Central Park for an old- fashion snowball fight with some friends. At that moment, there was no thing that felt more appropriate or desirable than getting my hands deep into the materiality of what had recently reinvigorated the land (and sound)scape around me. 9.
