<plain_text><page sequence="1">European Positivism and the American Unitarians CHARLES D. CASHDOLLAR Few movements have been so remarkably transformed within such a short period of time as nineteenth century American Unitarianism.1 In the 1830s, de- spite its recently acquired denominational independence, it remained theologically quite close its Congregational ancestry. Its most typical leaders of that period -Orville Dewey, John G. Palfrey, Ezra Stiles Gannett, and Nathaniel L. Froth- ingham-were all men of gentility and moderation, with little taste for theological revolution. Thus their Unitarianism differed from orthodox New England the- ology in degree rather than kind and still formed, as one contemporary put it, "the liberal side of the old Congregational body."2 Men like Frothingham, who filled the prestigious pulpit of Boston's First Church, continued to believe in a supernatural deity revealed by miracles and divinely inspired Scripture. They placed only limited faith in man. Although not totally depraved, humanity was filled largely with evil and needed divine mediation for salvation. Jesus, who provided this mediation, was described as "the divinely inspired Son of the Fa- ther." The social views of these men, based as they were on the assumption that God had ordained and established the social institutions of the day, were pre- dominantly conservative.3 Within a generation, however, this Old Unitarianism had dissolved. Not everyone changed, of course. Some Conservatives maintained the traditional views until their deaths, but they quickly became a minority as a New Unitarianism emerged. The most iconoclastic of the New Unitarians were the Radicals, whose re- jection of the past was so severe that by the 1860s they no longer considered themselves within the Christian tradition. Styling themselves simply "theists," they separated in 1866 to found the Free Religious Association. Octavius Brooks Froth- ingham, one of the organizers of the FRA and the son of Conservative leader Nathaniel, boldly declared that their thought "oversteps the boundary of Scripture and even of Christianity. . . "4 These Radicals never came to dominate the de- nomination, but a second group of New Unitarians-Moderates, as they might be called-did. In some ways, they were as thorough as the Radicals in dismissing the Old Unitarianism, but they did not agree that there was any necessary incom- patibility between their new theological position and Christianity. Christianity was not synonymous with Old Unitarianism; rather, it was a dynamic, flexible 1.

Thus while the Radicals rejected the name, the Moderates could still refer to themselves as "Christian." Whether in its theistic or Christian form, the New Unitarianism discarded the anthropomorphic, supernatural deity of the Conserva- tives, denied the existence of miracles, and questioned the authenticity of the Scriptures. It also assumed a more naturalistic view of causation, emphasized the divinity of man and the humanity of Jesus, and placed a greater emphasis on social action. This remarkable transformation, dramatized as it was by the lives of the elder and younger Frothinghams, is not entirely mysterious. Unitarianism, even in its most conservative form, was characterized by a spirit of generosity and open scholarship which permitted the infiltration of new, unsettling patterns of thought. Within the exciting atmosphere of Harvard Yard, young men were exposed to various forms of European idealism, to the tremendous power of German theology (especially that of F. C. Baur and the Tiibingen School), to the liberal Unitarian ism of James Martineau, to Oriental thought, and eventually to the scientific world of Charles Darwin. One by one these ideas first contradicted, and then undermined the Old Unitarianism. At the same time, they provided a ready supply of intel- lectual building blocks for the creation of a theological alternative. As the younger Frothingham put it, "When reason was first liberated, none but its enemies fore- saw its ultimate triumph."6 Without necessarily trying to diminish the importance of these well-recognized intellectual factors, this article will focus on another, less well-known body of ideas. This study examines the reception of European positivism by nineteenth- century American Unitarians and the infusion of that thought into the denomina- tion's swiftly moving intellectual currents. It can be shown that positivism, in both its French and English versions, was received into Unitarian circles more cor- dially than previously believed and that it became, for at least some members of the community, a factor in undermining the Old Unitarianism and suggesting forms for the New.6 Positivism, as it was understood by the Unitarian community during the mid- nineteenth century, meant both less and more than it usually does for us today. It meant less because the Unitarians never adopted any form of European positivism totally. Rather, they were selective, borrowing those segments which suited their needs and often modifying their original composition in the process. On the other hand, their use of the word implied more than it does for us because the Unitarians did not restrict the term, as we normally would, to the intellectual system of Auguste Comte. Instead, they fused Comte's thought with parts of what is now distin- guished as the British empirical tradition, represented especially by John Stuart Mill and Herbert Spencer. It is not surprising that Mill was seen as a disciple of Comte because he did maintain a lively correspondence with the French philos- opher for a period of time and did borrow Comtian ideas freely, though not un- 5.

Indeed, many Unitarians were initially exposed to Comte through the writings of Mill, first in his System of Logic (1843) and later in his Auguste Comte and Positivism (1865). Mill's role as a transmitter of Comte's ideas prob- ably explains the origin of this fusion made by the Unitarians.7 The categorization of Herbert Spencer as a Comtian disciple seems stranger to us. We are used to defining him as a Darwinian evolutionist. But the Uni- tarians knew Comte better and earlier than they knew Darwin and, in any case, were more interested in Spencer's methods than in his specific conclusions. Thus they associated him more closely with Comte than with any other. They did so even after Spencer, with the aid of his American disciple E. L. Youmans, vigor- ously denied any such link. The Unitarians dearly did not believe him, arguing that his claim of total independence was mere intellectual vanity. They were well aware that Spencer's thought was not identical to Comte's and, as we shall see later, debated the extent to which Spencer had improved upon his predecessor. But beyond doubt, they assured themselves, "the works of Herbert Spencer exhibit the latest form of the positive philosophy. .. ." The American Unitarians, then, knew positivism first in its Comtian form and later in what they would think of as its derivative Spencerian form.8 Auguste Comte (1798-1857) was a brilliant, eccentric French thinker who created one of the major, universal ideologies for which nineteenth century Europe was so famous. The central portions of Comte's controversial method and conclu- sions were published between 1830 and 1842 as the six-volume Cours de philos- sophie positive. Its publication did not attract a great deal of attention among American intellectuals; only a few actually acquired and read the French edition. Until at least 1853, most exposure to Comte occurred indirectly through journal articles, a few histories of philosophy, or the works of John Stuart Mill. In that year, however, positivist thought became more accessible when Harriet Martineau, sister of the prominent English Unitarian, published an abridged English transla- tion of the Cours.9 Comte subsequently broadened the application of his thought in Catechisme positiviste (1852, translated by Richard Congreve as The Catechism of Positive Religion, 1858) and SystMme de politique positive (four volumes, 1851- 1854, but not translated until 1875-1877). Those Unitarians who came to know Comte's work either directly or indirectly focused on four major segments of his thought: 1. The Law of the Three Stages. Comte assumed that the history of man's intellectual development could be divided into three, basically chronological stages: the Theological, the Metaphysical, and the Positive. In the first of these periods, man, lacking enough knowledge to explain his world scientifically, invented and 7. For the relationship of Comte and Mill see Simon, European Positivism, pp. 180-195.

Recent historians seem to support Spencer, however. See Simon, European Positivism, pp. 217-219. 9. Miss Martineau's translation, The Positive Philosophy, appeared in two volumes. The most prominent indirect sources of positivism were a July 1838 article by Sir David Brewster which first appeared in the Edinburgh Review and later was reprinted in the New Jerusalem Magazine in 1840; John Stuart Mill, A System of Logic (1843); and John Henry Young's translation of Emile Littre, De la philosophie positive which ap- peared in the Democratic Review of 1847. Comte was summarized in George Henry Lewes, The Biographical History of Philosophy from Its Origin in Greece down to the Present Day (1846) and John David Morell, Historical and Critical View of the Speculative Philosophy of Europe (1846). 492</page><page sequence="4">EUROPEAN POSITIVISM ascribed causation to supernatural, essentially anthropomorphic deities. Within this era, man moved through sub-stages of Fetishism, Polytheism, and Monotheism as he gained sophistication. In the second major era, man sought causal explana- tions in abstract impersonal terms. In the third era, man restricted himself to purely naturalistic, scientific explanations of his world. The Unitarians were at- tracted by certain aspects of this theory. First, in contrast to other available the- ories of historical development, this one addressed itself specifically to the rela- tionship of religion and science. The concept of religion as a variable of scientific advance intrigued many Unitarians and although they usually merged or even replaced Comte's agnostic positive era with their own brand of liberal theism, they nevertheless used much of Comte. Moreover, positivism included a destruc- tive attack on a supernatural concept of God, arguing as it did that such archaic views were the result of scientific ignorance. It became clear that whatever form the new theology might assume, one negative criterion it would have to meet was the absence of a functional deity created to fill the gaps in man's secular knowledge. 2. Comte's epistemology. Comte based his severe critique of the Theological and Metaphysical Eras on his assertion that the human intellect was limited to the empirically verifiable. Quite simply, man was incapable of gaining knowledge of absolutes, either theological or metaphysical. All man could know and needed to know were the existence and relationship of phenomena. The Unitarians, frankly, had difficulty with this aspect of Comte, and only the most radical among them would accept this nescience fully. Many, especially those with close ties to the ideal- ism of the Transcendentalist movement, were too deeply steeped in intuitive thought. But whether they really accepted Comte's epistemology or merely twisted it to retain a role for intuition, it was clearly recognized by the Moderates and Radicals alike that Comte presented an incontrovertible challenge to the combina- tion of natural theology and supernatural revelation which supported Old Uni- tarianism. On a more constructive side, Comte provided, especially through Mill, a lucid statement of the possibilities of the scientific method for understanding not only the physical but also the social world. 3. Comte's definition of God. To the extent that Comte blocked the possibility of knowledge or relationship with a supernatural, transcendent deity, he forced the Unitarians to search for God in the world around them. Comte himself identi- fied God as Collective Humanity. In his later years, he created a highly liturgical Religion of Humanity complete with priests and rituals to worship Mankind. No Unitarian accepted this, but much of what Comte was saying-the divinity of man, a selfless humanism, and a theodicy based upon the solidarity of the human race-proved suggestive in the creation of a theological alternative. 4. Comte's ethics. Since God had been defined as Collective Humanity, ser- vice to God meant service to one's fellow man rather than to a distant deity. Comte even invented a word-altruism-to express this olbigation. It was an expression of duty which many Unitarians found meaningful. Thus the combined weight of Comte's epistemology and his definition of God forced man away from the pietistic or providential to a naturalistic view of social problems, from prayer to human action. Furthermore, Comte promised that his new science of society, "sociology," could provide the knowledge necessary for the ethical decisions in- volved in social reform. 493</page><page sequence="5">II Unitarian contact with positivism began during the 1830s with a small group of friends who read and discussed the French edition of the Cours. At its center was William Henry Channing, minor Transcendentalist and nephew of William Ellery. Young Channing wrote later that "I became a student of Comte from about the time of publication of the first volume of his Cours de philosophie positive. And as each of the volumes successively appeared it was eagerly read and earnestly discussed with my friends Theodore Parker, George Ripley, and 0. A. Brownson, till 1854, when I came to England. Since that era, with the exception of some of his strictly mathematical treatises, every word of Comte so far as known to me has been conscientiously studied. . . ."1 This group was primarily important for the presence within it of Theodore Parker, a man usually described as the spiritual father of the New Unitarianism. Parker owned all six volumes of the Cours and studied thoroughly at least the final three.ll He borrowed heavily from Comte as early as 1841 while preparing his controversial Discourse of Matters Pertaining to Religion. One of Parker's objectives there was to show that the religious impulse was innate and therefore independent of Scriptural revelation. To do so, he attempted to demonstrate that religion existed among primitive men and evolved according to variables other than supernatural revelation. The form of the argument was essentially a history of religions, the theoretical framework of which was explicitly based on part of Comte's three stages. Parker did not adopt Comte without modification. He fol- lowed the early portions of the theory with considerable accuracy down through the sub-stages of fetishism and polytheism to monotheism, but he was conscious that the ultimate direction of his argument was not Comte's positive stage but rather his own form of theistic naturalism. Despite his disagreements with Comte, Parker was setting an eclectic pattern which other Unitarians would follow when he used what he called "the valuable and sometimes profound work Cours de phi- losophie positive" as it suited his own needs.l2 Similarly, Parker found Comte's association of religion with the progress of scientific thought useful in his attacks on the anthropomorphic deity of the Con- servatives. Like Comte, Parker was certain that belief in such a deity was really a form of "superstition" created by man to deal with gaps in his physical knowl- edge.13 In his Discourse and even more strongly in his Sermons on Theism, Atheism, and the Popular Theology (1853), Parker charged that this traditional 10.

Channing wrote an article including some material on Comte in the November 15, 1843, issue of Present, a journal he edited. Hawkins (Auguste Comte, p. 15) claims for Chan- ning the distinction of being the first American to take an interest in Comte. Brown- son, as usu,al, reacted in his own unique way. He claimed that positivism helped push him toward Catholicism. It emphasized the need for a single, unifying ideology, showed how Protestantism could not providi this, and presented evidence that Roman Catholicism had once admirably siippli'il sucl unity. Catholicism became, then, at once a refuge from scientific positivism and an answer to the intellectual crisis which Comte had discerned so well. See H. F. Brownson, ed., The Works of Orestes A.

"Atheists," he concluded, referring specifically to the French pos- itivist, "are often made such by circumstances."'5 It was Comte's rejection of supernaturalism which always made the strongest impression on Parker and gave him cause for hope. Parker even questioned who was the real atheist, the orthodox believer who acted selfishly or the "speculative atheist" like Comte or Mill who claimed not to believe and yet acted on humanistic assumptions which Parker thought essentially theistic. In fact, Parker seemed unconvinced by what he dubbed Comte's "atheism." "He glories in the name," Parker mused, "but in many places gives evidence of the religious element existing in him, in no small power."1 Parker's knowledge of Comte was never more than partial, and at times he mis- read him.17 Yet he was open, even cordial, and willing to borrow freely. As spiritual mentor to a number of young Unitarians, many of whom would ultimately become Radicals, Parker's eclecticism was an important link in the transmission of positivism to the American Unitarians. During the next several years, an awareness and appreciation of Auguste Comte spread to a still small, yet growing number of Unitarians. Much of the interest continued to be eclectic, as it was for Parker.l8 In the winters of 1841, 1842, and 1843, James Walker, then Alford Professor of Natural Religion and later president of Harvard, presented three series of lectures on natural religion at the Lowell Institute in Boston. The first, which treated religion from what Walker considered a psychological perspective, argued that man's religious im- pulse was innate and persistent through history. The form of this sentiment, however, was contingent upon science and society and had evolved through suc- cessive stages of Fetishism, Polytheism, and Monotheism. The following winter, Walker devoted half of his final lecture (February 18, 1842) to the ideas of Auguste Comte. He discussed the three stage theory of history "at length," crit- ically arguing, as he had in his first series, that the religious sentiment was being transformed rather than eliminated as Comte suggested. Walker also explained and evaluated the positivist theory of knowledge. Although he agreed with Comte about the limits of rational thought, he was unwilling to admit that theological questions could remain unasked. Rather, the finitude of the human mind pointed 14.

Maria Child, The Progess of Beligious Ideas, Through Successive Ages, 3 vols., (New York: C. S. Francis, 1855) as an example of positivist influence among Unitarians. There are some passages in Mrs. Child's work which contain vaguely positivist statements about stages of society, about man's creation of deities to explain what was yet mys- terious, or about the giving of anthropomorphic attributes to gods. (see 2:159, 164, 173-174) But it is doubtful that there was any direct Comtian influence. Her bibliog- raphy, collected with the advice of Parker and her brother Convers Francis, does not include Comte. Some indirect influence is possible; it seems unbelievable that she would not have read Parker's Discourse. But generally she seems to have been a person who disliked philosophical quarrels and worked diligently to avoid becoming entangled in them.

Yet he respected the achievement marked by the Cours and apparently encouraged an interest in it among his Harvard students. So long as it was taken "for suggestion, not for dogma," one student later remembered, Walker believed that "there shall hardly be found anywhere an equally instructive view."20 Most importantly, Walker recognized the critical contradictions between positivism and Old Unitarianism. "The question on the merits of this system," he wrote in 1849, "with its corollary in respect to the ultimate fate of all religions, is now an open question; we cannot avert the discussion, if we would;-a discussion which must hold a prominent place in the controversies of the next fifty years."21 As awareness of Comte increased, most Unitarians like Walker or C. A. Bartol remained skeptical of positivism's epistemological strictures. They seemed to Bar- tol the most unsatisfactory and least useful parts of Comte.22 Elizabeth Peabody, however, tentatively employed them in her attempts to undermine traditional Uni- tarianism by lessening the credibility of natural theology. In 1858 she reviewed Comte's recently translated Catechism of Positive Religion in an article for the Christian Examiner. True to her own idealistic philosophy, she did not accept completely Comte's assertion that only phenomena could be known. Yet signifi- cantly, she turned the brunt of her critique against the traditional rationalism of the Old Unitarians rather than against positivism itself. Comte, she thought, was correct about the limits of rational thought; one could no longer argue that God was to be found in the stars. Instead-and the parallel to Comte's emphasis on collective humanity is striking-the divine was to be sought in a study of man's activities on earth. "It is the gradual appreciation of this necessity," she concluded, "which is giving a broader range to the theology of our day."23 Julia Ward Howe, a member of Parker's congregation, was another Unitarian who acquired an early familiarity with positivism. While in Rome during the Christmas season of 1850, she met Horace Binney Wallace, a young Philadelphian who was an admirer and financial patron of Comte. Wallace had just come from a visit to Comte in Paris. Between tours of the Pantheon and discussions of the character traits signified by their identical red hair, he conversed with Mrs. Howe about positivism. Promptly upon her return to the United States, she began to read through the Cours de philosophie positive. Unlike some of the other Uni- tarians, she seems to have been more interested in the book's scientific portions than in its discussions of theology and metaphysics. But she did retain an interest 19. Walker's lectures were never printed and the manuscripts have not survived. The news paper coverage upon which these passages are based is admittedly imperfect, but really quite detailed.

Later, during the early 1860s, she included a favorable estimate of Comte in her series of parlor lectures.24 Of all the American Unitarians, the one who became most deeply involved and committed to positivism was Joseph Henry Allen, grandson of the elder Henry Ware and third in his Harvard class of 1840. After three years at Harvard Divin- ity School, he held a series of pastorates until 1857, spending most of the 1850s at the church in Bangor, Maine. Though not as well known among historians as he might be, Allen did hold a position of considerable influence in the Unitarian community. In addition to some teaching at Harvard, he served as editor of the Christian Examiner and later of the Unitarian Review, two journals whose pages served as the forum for most of the denomination's theological discussions.25 Alien was first exposed to positivism at Harvard by James Walker, and by the 1850s he had emerged as the Unitarian most knowledgable on the subject. In 1851, having acquired and read the entire six volumes of the Cours as well as what commentary he could find, he prepared the first major article on positivism written by an American.26 Allen's article, which appeared in the Christian Ex- aminer, was a favorable appraisal of Comte's thought. "Hardly a page or a line," Allen wrote, "is without its fertile suggestion, and its traces of close and profound thought." Allen had studied the Cours carefully and thoroughly and, although complaining a bit about the tediousness of Comte's style, obviously recognized the revolutionary nature of what he found. "Its design," he wrote, "is nothing less than the recasting of the whole system of modern thought and knowledge (and by anticipation the social system too), on the basis given in the method of the natural sciences."27 The aspect of positivist thought which most impressed Allen was the ap- plication of scientific method to social analysis and ethics. Comte was precisely what the age needed to hear, and ". . . though he may not be heard now, he is yet saying what men must some time listen to, and what they will be inevitably compelled to accept and apply .... ." He had done mankind a great service by removing religion and installing science as the dominant force in social thought. As Allen put it, ". . . for the guiding of the general thought, for hints of ethical doctrine, for maxims and grounds of intellectual certainty, for the conditions of substantial well-being and social order, we must go to the principles and methods 24.

Parker sent him bibliographic suggestions and offered to lend books from his well-stocked library. Parker also read some of Allen's unpublished manuscripts, helpfully offering criticism. Parker commented that he could see the "influence of Comte and Gfrorer, two able helps" on one such paper. But he also feared that Allen's writing was abstruse and added good-naturedly, "perhaps Comte is not likely to have a good influence on your style." See John Weiss, ed., Life and Correspondence of Theodore Parker, 2 vols. (New York: Appleton, 1864), 1:379-383. 27.

If one read Comte carefully, Allen insisted, all that Comte did was ignore the question of religion. He expressed his preference to look at society "as if" there were no God, but never explicitly said there was not. The key was to understand that Comte was not to be "confounded in the charges of vulgar atheism." An exclusion of positive knowledge about God was not to be confused with an ex- clusion of the existence of God. Indeed Allen, somewhat unfairly to Comte, saw no inconsistency in becoming a devotee of Comte's method and still keeping his own personal religious faith, based as it was on non-phenomenal evidence.2 Thus Comte's attractiveness to Allen, and to future Unitarians as well, was that he provided a radical scientific method without an explicit atheism. Intellectually, it was a way to have one's cake and eat it, too. So long as this was true, religion had no real quarrel with Comte and "theology can afford to yield grace- fully, where she once ruled triumphantly." Science would apply to affairs within the visible horizon, religion to those beyond.30 Positivism, Alien concluded, had reshaped his own thoughts on science, history, and social philosophy, and also initiated a "widening and deepening and shifting of perspective" in religion.31 Excited by his intellectual discovery, he began to explore further. He contacted Horace Binney Wallace, the friend of Julia Ward Howe who was supplying some 500 francs annually to Comte. Having found Wallace mentioned in the preface to the second volume of SystOme de politique positive, Allen opened a correspondence with him and in November, 1852, jour- neyed to Philadelphia to discuss Comte with him in person. Shortly after hearing of Wallace's premature death a month later, Allen wrote a lengthy letter to Auguste Comte regretting the loss of their mutual friend. Beyond the deep personal loss, Allen was concerned that Comte would suffer financially because of the death of his American patron. "It is in consideration of this," Allen wrote to Comte, "that I take the liberty of writing to you at the present time. It will be far from my power to make good to you the place of such a friend as Mr. Wallace. But I feel myself under a great debt of obligation to you, for the intellectual service you have rendered within these few years past; and I should be glad to do something, though little, to testify my sense of this obligation. My limited income &amp; my family will not allow me to do personally as much as I would. But if you will favor me, in reply to this, with a statement of the condition in which you find your personal fund-such that I may use it in applying to others-I hope that I may find it of advantage in your behalf. I should give say about 50 fr. and some of my friends, I hope, would do as much or more. Although Comte did reply promptly to Allen, the reply and any evidence of the results of Allen's inquiry seem to have been lost. However, the existence of such a financial offer testifies to the more than casual interest which some of the Unitarian community had in Comte's work.32 28. Ibid., pp. 184, 201-202. 29.

It was a subject he had discussed with Wallace, and now pressed with Comte himself. He asked Comte for written clarification of the matter and also solicited Comte's reaction to his own 1851 article on positivism. In 1855, Allen visited Comte three times in his Paris apartment. Here the matter was once again discussed and apparently resolved to Allen's satisfaction.33 In 1857 Allen prepared another article for the Christian Examiner specifically discussing Comte's religion. Although he rejected the liturgical formalities of the Religion of Humanity, he continued to insist that positivism posed no threat to true belief. "The Deity it dethrones is simply an idol . .. ."4 Comte apparently had found an intellectual disciple of considerable persistence in Joseph Henry Allen. Not all Unitarians, however, were so eclectic as Parker, so broad-minded as Walker, or so committed as Allen. Those who were most devoted to the Old Unitarianism rejected Comte quickly and totally. Harriet Martineau's abridgment and translation of the Cours in 1853 brought it to the attention of several such Conservatives who either had not ventured so far afield as to find it before or, more likely, simply had seen no urgent need to gather righteous indignation against six volumes of tedious French. One such reviewer was the Reverend Thomas Hill, then of Waltham, Massa- chusetts, later president of Antioch College and then of Harvard. A mathematician of considerable skill, Hill was quite ready to reject Comte completely. "We deny, in toto," he wrote sharply, "the great law of Comte, that each individual, and the race, passes through the three stages of theology, metaphysics, and positivism, and assert that his conception of this law had led him to a misconception of every subject of Science, from Geometry up to Sociology." Clearly both Comte and Martineau (in spite of her Unitarian ties) were atheists, destitute of religious faith because, no doubt, of some "nervous disease or inherited idiosyncracy."35 Francis Bowen, another Conservative Unitarian-so conservative, in fact, that he would probably not have been a Unitarian if not for the denomination's social prominence in Massachusetts-reviewed the Martineau translation for the North American Review. Bowen, no mathematician like Hill, tended to blame Comte's eccentric thought less on insanity than on the Frenchman's overestimation of the power of mathematical thought. Comte illustrated quite nicely, Bowen thought, D'Alembert's admission "that a mathematician is essentially unqualified for meta- Marginal notation by Comte indicates a reply was sent the day after its receipt. Since he had just been informed that Wallace's will provided him an annuity of 500 francs, Comte very likely refused Allen's generous offer of aid. (See letters from Wallace's brother to Comte on January 13 and April 15, 1853, reproduced in Hawkins, Auguste Comte, pp. 54-56.) Previous historians such as Richmond L. Hawkins badly underesti- mated the interest of some Unitarians in Comte. Hawkins concludes, quite incorrectly, that Allen thought positivism "premature, vicious in its foundation, impossible, and absurd." (Hawkins, Positivism, p. 79.) 33. Two of Allen's visits to Comte at 10, Rue Monsieur le Prince are verified by two calling cards which were dated and left with Comte. They are now in the archives of La Maison d'Auguste Comte in Paris.

Bowen, sorrowfully he claimed, was not surprised to see her associated with heresy. She was, after all, a feminist who dared to enter the scholar's world. "She has got beyond all religious faith," Bowen explained, "by first divesting herself of all womanly feeling. It is precisely because she is an 'unsexed thing,' that she has learned how to 'scorn her God."37 Clearly, any philosophy made available to the English-speaking world by such a translator was not fit for intellectual consumption by a Christian gentleman. III The considerable difference between these harsh reactions of Hill and Bowen and the favorable ones of Allen serves as an indication of the divisions which had grown inside the American Unitarian Association. Through the 1860s, clashes between Conservatives and the emerging New Unitarians increased in frequency and sharpness until by 1866 many Radicals saw no recourse short of schism. By the time the actual division occurred, the Unitarian exposure to positivism had been significantly transformed by the advent of Herbert Spencer. As we have already noted, the Unitarians viewed Spencer as a disciple of Comte. It was also understood that he made changes, indeed improvements in the original positivism. He had, for instance, redefined Comte's three historical eras into one continuous evolutionary process. Most importantly, he made a modifi- cation in the area of religion which made him eminently more useful to the New Unitarians. Whereas Comte had shown scientific thought ultimately replacing religion, Spencer preferred to believe that science was merely purifying religion by separating superstition (which was the result of inadequate knowledge of the physical world) from true religion. Moreover, while like Comte he denied man's capacity to know anything beyond phenomena, Spencer nonetheless asserted that there was an Unknowable there. This Absolute or truly "inscrutable Power," he said, was the true province of theology. It was little comfort to the traditional Unitarians who insisted on a knowable Deity. But for the Moderates and the Radicals who had long ago grown suspicious of revelation and had, since Parker, been working with an extremely abstract conception of divinity anyway, it was all the opening they needed.38 Joseph Henry Allen, who had maintained his interest in Comte, quickly rushed to use Spencer to link positivism more securely to the New Unitarianism. Comte, he admitted, had suffered the hazards of any pioneer, picking up "the prejudices and errors, as well as the legitimate tendencies" of the 1830s. Spencer now had gone beyond Comte; so far in fact, 'that it is difficult to believe that it represents only half a single generation of intellectual advance."39 Spencer's writings were soon to be disseminated widely among the Unitarians by John Fiske, who as a young Harvard student was severely disciplined and nearly expelled for 36. rFrancis Bowen], "Martineau 's Translation of Comte's Philosophy," North American Review 79 (1854):200-229.

There was, on the one hand, a group of idealistic Transcendentalists- especially David A. Wasson but also Samuel Johnson and Samuel Longfellow- who had always found positivist epistemology antithetical to their own intuitive philosophy. They saw no reason to change their negative appraisal now.42 But there was also a younger, rationalistic segment led by Octavius Brooks Frothing- ham and Francis E. Abbot, who showed considerable interest in positivism. Although neither was by any means totally committed, their work does show its influence. Octavius Brooks Frothingham was the son of Conservative Unitarian Na- thaniel Frothingham of Boston. He had, however, been intellectually seduced by Theodore Parker who acquainted him with Baur and the Tiibingen School.43 By the 1860s young Frothingham had gone far beyond Parker, partly due to the influence of Comte and Spencer. "The theological epoch draws near its close," he declared in Comtian phrase; Christianity was abandoned and a new age had come. For lack of a better name, he called this newly emerging theism "Radicalism."44 Frothingham titled his major work The Religion of Humanity, a name sug- gestive of its Comtian origin. Although he borrowed Comte's phrase and many of his ideas, Frothingham shrank from close association with the French thinker. In fact, he was absolutely furious at Comte for having polluted a fine concept with a highly liturgical, quasi-Catholic sacramentalism. It had become, he scoffed, "the Roman Church over again without its theology; St. Peter's without a saint."45 Beneath this excess vanity, there was much good in Comte-the solidarity of 40. Milton Berman, John Fiske: The Evolution of a Popularizer (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1961), p. 33. Fiske's route to positivism began in 1859 with Henry Buckle's History of Civilization in England. Within a year he had read Mill, Lewes, and Martineau's translation of Comte. The following year, his first at Harvard, he became familiar with Spencer. (Ibid., pp. 17-18, 30.) During 1869-1870, Fiske was invited by Harvard President Charles Eliot to lecture on positivism (Ibid., pp. 73-74.) These lectures eventually grew into his synthetic Outlines of Cosmic Philosophy, 2 vols. (Boston: Houghton- Mifflin, 1874). See also H.

Frothingham stood closest to Herbert Spencer, borrowing intact his concept of the Unknowable God. Like his mentor Parker, Frothingham was emphatic in his denial of man's ability to know absolute truth by science. But just as emphatically, he now, like Comte and Spencer, denied this ability to the soul and to any form of intuition as well. Boldest of all, the soul plumes her wings of faith for a flight to the very Empyrean itself. Her pinions of aspiration bear her above the earth; she dis- tances vision, outruns the calculations of the mathematician, leaves time and space behind. With open eye looks steadily at the sun. But the sun itself is a shadow. Light there is, a shouless ocean of light, atmospheres glowing with its radiance, throbbing with its gracious undulations. On its waves she floats serenely; in its silence she rests at peace. But no voice breaks the silence. No form of creative godhead walks on the sea of glory. The soul must be content to find a home as wide as infinite thought, as warm as eternal love; but never see the fashioner of it, never to find the soft bosom of the mother in whose breast it can nestle.46 God, Frothingham was certain, was simply "being," unknown and unknow- able. This was really much better, he assured his readers. It led ultimately to a purer worship since "'in proportion as they claim to be familiar with their Deity, men become irreverent towards him."47 Even more importantly, the concept of a hidden God gave man greater freedom for social action. In an attack reminis- cent of Parker, Frothingham lashed out at the immobilization which resulted from a providential conception of God. "If God is at hand to perform our tasks, reform our faults, save us from the consequences of our blunders, moral discipline is at an end."48 With Spencer's Unknowable Power, however, man relied upon himself. Frothingham's Religion of Humanity was first and foremost a social re- ligion. It had to mean "social sentiment, social science, social cooperation, social harmony .... It will still celebrate man's intercourse with man; for God is in man, and only as man nobly associates with man, in interest, purpose, feeling, aspiration, thought and deed, does man nobly associate with God." And only through such social interaction "can we get any knowledge of God."49 Despite the heavy emphasis on altruistic service each shared, the religions of Frothingham and Comte did not assign a precisely analogous role to collective Humanity. God, for Frothingham, was not identical to Collective Humanity; rather, it lay beyond man in the Spencerian realm of the Unknowable. Humanity was more nearly a Christ figure for Frothingham. Salvation is by the human Christ, the Christ of humanity, say we. It is a sal- vation by Faith and also by Works; faith incorporating the individual with society through sympathy with the principles by virtue of which society exists, and works making that incorporation compact and solid through some positive contribution of service rendered to one or more human beings ....50 It was a radical departure-a social theology celebrating social science and directed toward social action. A second FRA figure, Francis Ellingswood Abbot, presented his own unique variation of positivism. It cannot be said that he considered himself a 46. Radical 10 (1872):250-251. 47. Ibid., p. 253. 48.

His most fully developed statement, Scientific Theism, would not appear until 1885, but as early as 1866, Abbot published an article in the Chris- tian Examiner calling for an application of positivism in theology.51 A review of Spencer's First Principles, it set out Abbot's evaluation of both Comte and Spencer, two names which he linked closely together. Comte, Abbot thought, was very easy to criticize because of the eccentricities of his liturgical formulations. But it would "not do to sneer." Comte had put his finger directly upon the method of achieving knowledge, but his difficulty was that he underestimated his own find- ings. It was just not true that the positive method would not apprehend abso- lutes. Given sufficicent time, science could know anything.52 Spencer was some- thing of an improvement but still imperfect. He tended to sidestep difficult questions and was habitually inconsistent. For instance, how could one "know" that an "unknowable" existed? The point was, Abbot insisted, that there was nothing unknowable. "Grasp that conception clearly," he repeated. "All Being is essentially intelligible and either is, or may be, apparent."53 There was but one way to seek this knowledge and that was positivism, which meant to build upon "facts." Ten- tatively at least, he was willing to assume an ontological dualism, suggesting that there were both spiritual and material facts upon which to build.54 Abbot believed, as did Comte, that positive knowledge had spread gradually by use of the scientific method from the simpler to the more complex sciences. Abbot also believed, as Comte and Spencer did not, that positivism could ultimately spread to theology. How we know God, and what we know of him, are questions which depend, like all other questions, upon the answer to antecedent inquiries, What are the facts or data? and what do the facts or data teach? These inquiries indicate the spirit and tendency of Positivism, properly so called; and whoever attempts to solve all problems of human thought without exception, according to this method, is truly a Positivist. His solutions may be erroneous, but he works by the right rule.65 This would be the truly "scientific theism" with positive knowledge of God. Abbot expected this God to be personal, not pantheistic, an "infinite self-created and self-evolving organism" which would comprise an "endocosmic and monistic tele- ology, the omnipresent and eternal teleological activity of the infinte creative understanding or Infinite Self-Conscious Intellect."" In short, Abbot sought a style of Unitarianism far removed from the simple rationalism of the Old Uni- tarians and from the intuitive patterns of the Transcendentalists. "We believe," he declared, "that Unitarianism must be re-theologized on the basis of pure posi- tivism, as the absolute condition of its future growth."57 His dream, of course, did not fully materialize. Abbot's penchant for incredi- bly obscure language and philosophical abstraction left him few disciples and fewer still who really understood him. But if Abbot's particular version of posi- tivism failed to gain much more than a distant respect, there were other, less complex versions of positivism which found adherents. J.

He suggested that "philosophy has entered its positive stage; so has historical litera- ture; may not religion, too, be entering its positive stage of development?"58 Patterson shared Abbot's disappointment with Spencer; his concept of the Un- knowable was "the most unsatisfactory philosophical work he has done."59 It would not do as a basis for religion. Patterson, however, resolved the problem, not by pushing scientific knowledge to the edge of time and space as Abbot had done, but by bringing religion down out of "the weird and misty mazes of the unexplored" and into the life of man. In this he was closer to Frothingham and also to the larger Unitarian community. "The conviction is becoming irresistible that it is not the acceptance of dogma, nor worship by prescribed forms, but excellence of life, of character, that should constitute the standard of religious recognition."60 In the positive stage, religion would "confine itself to the use of rational means for the improvement of the conditions of life and the elevation of man as an indi- vidual and social being."61 On this basis-that religion was "a perpetual aspiration toward a higher standard of manhood and womanhood"-religion could exist with- out a belief in an "objective God . . . and a follower of Comte or a Buddhist may be religious in the same sense as the Spiritualist or the Lutheran."62 V Perhaps more important for the future of Unitarianism than any interest in positivism by the Radicals was its gradual influence among the Moderates who retained their ties to the denomination. Indeed, it might be argued that some of these men borrowed as freely from Comte as did the Radicals, and sometimes more freely. The difference was that the Moderate saw no conflict between the Christian tradition as they had come to understand it and those aspects of positiv- ism which they merged with it.63 One person who fit this pattern was Andrew Preston Peabody, Plumer Professor of Morals at Harvard. There is little question about his conservatism in the 1840s and 1850s. He took such a strongly supernaturalist position that C. A. Bartol used him as an illustration of a direct opposite to Comte.4 As late as 1863, he was still defending the necessity of supernatural revelation.86 Neverthe- less, Peabody possessed an uncanny ability to keep himself near the center of the denominational spectrum. That this center had assuredly been moving was indicated by his willingness in the 1870s to concede much more to Comte. In July 1877, he addressed the Adelphi Union at Williams College, using as his topic "The Three Eras of Positive Philosophy." Significantly, he assumed that his 58. J.

Peabody, Christianity the Religion of Nrature (Boston: Gould and Lincoln, 1863). 504</page><page sequence="16">EUROPEAN POSITIVISM audience was thoroughly familiar with this developmental theory. In his lecture, Peabody argued that although Comte was certainly not flawless, he could not "but regard these successive stages as an authentic compend of human history...." The first stage, as Comte had supposed, saw the beginnings of religion in man's ignorance of natural causation. Hence man deified nature, endowing it with "at- tributes not unlike his own." With the passing of this Theological Era, man moved into the Metaphysical where he had been tempted to deify natural law. Positivism pointed to that error also. The great purifying advantage of positivism, therefore, was that it had forced the abandonment of a "quest of efficient causes" in nature. The transition from each of the historical stages to the next was accompanied by "an amount of skepticism, nay, of absolute atheism," but this was both natural and necessary to destroy the misconceptions of the previous period. Unfortunately, Comte mistakenly believed these temporary attitudes sig- naled the destruction of religion rather than its purification.68 This was, in most respects, a rendering of positivist theory not too different from that common among the Radicals. Peabody, however, saw nothing there which conflicted with this current understanding of Christianity. Even the Scrip- tures could be reconciled with Comte if each were properly interpreted. The Genesis story, for instance, proved compatible with Comte since its author was obviously trying to stamp out previous forms of fetishism and emphasize that God was not identical with nature but rather its Creator. "Strange as it may sound," Peabody concluded, "[positivism] bears a close affinity to whatever of philosophy there is in the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures."67 Another person who saw no necessary conflict between positivism and a Christian Unitarianism was Joseph Henry Allen, whom we already noted as one of Comte's earliest and most faithful defenders. He maintained his interest throughout the 1870s, built his Harvard lectures in ecclesiastical history on a positivist framework, and was himself as influenced by Comte as any Unitarian.68 But at the same time, he had a flexible, malleable conception of Christianity which accomodated rather than clashed with the new thought. During the height of the FRA controversies of the 1860s, he wrote that he felt "perplexity and pain" when he was told that he was a hypocrite to still call himself a Christian. Poignantly he pled with his friends not to force him to choose between modem intellectual trends and historic Christianity.69 By the 1880s, much of the disputation which had caused Allen so much anguish had cooled considerably and one could reasonably ask how much per- manent change had occurred. Some members of the FRA had wandered off into humanism or secularism or the social sciences. Some, such as Octavius Brooks Frothingham, eventually returned to the fold. But Frothingham was able to 66. A. P. Peabody, "The Three Eras of Positive Philosophy," Unitarian Beview 8 (1877) :234- 237, 240-242, 243-245. 67. Ibid., p. 242. 68. The Comtian influence in these lectures, 1878-1882, is most noticeable in his treatment of Protestantism as essentially a negative force and the Reformation as "a period not of construction but of transistion." "Its chaotic struggles . . . were only the harbinger of . .what we have learned to call Social Science." Christian History 3:18-19.

Even those who tried to avoid positivism had been forced to tack in the wind, to emphasize God's immanence while answering its nescience and to emphasize Christian service while countering its altruism.70 Others, of course had accepted its influence more directly. John White Chadwick, a protege and friend of Joseph Henry Allen, looked back and tried to evaluate just what the "enduring elements of religious positivism" had been. He isolated three which he thought dominant: the concept of God as collective humanity, immortality within the memory of the human race, and the duty of altruistic service to one's fellow man.7' Allen himself saw the change this way: It is that, step by step, the theological is supplanted by the scientific, the divine by the human view. It is in other words, a 'religion of humanity,' taking the place, in our generation, of a religion of dogma. Speculative theiligy has no longer any place in it, as defining arbitrarily the nature and character of our obligations, any more than it has in shaping our views of history and cosmogony. The thought of a divine existence, of an infinite will, remains, but only to give lift to imagination, gravity to reflection, reverence to the temper of the soul, and a foundation of gratitude and trust: its value is less speculative than emo- tional; it is to be known, not in dogmatic assertion, but through such symbol as we may imperfectly apprehend it by,-the Life of the universe, the Source of all being, the object of our adoration as we aspire more and more to the higher life. But when it comes to the task of interpretation and instruction and guidance, then it is the lesson of experience and the word of science that we need. History, politics, economy, social statics and dynamics, the laws of wealth, the laws of charity, the laws of character, the laws of crime,-these we must make the subject-matter of our study when we seek to follow out any line of practical duty and morals. It is with these, and not with any theological scheme of duty and opinion, that our nobler sentiments, our sweet and charitable emo- tions, have to be reconciled.72 As Octavious Brooks Frothingham sat in the family pew in Boston's First Church, listening as he did in the 1890s to the New Unitarianism now preached from his father's former pulpit, he must have marveled at the changes which the years had wrought.73 And Auguste Comte must take his place alongside F. C. Baur, James Martineau, Charles Darwin, and the others as a factor in that transformation. 70. See S. R.
