Warren, Ml ABSTRACT This paper refines the methodology presen- ted in the companion paper linking reductions in biomechanical responses due to force- limiting material to projections of injury mitigation in real-world side impact crashes. The revised approach was used to evaluate the potential injury reducing benefit for the chest and abdomen with either constant crush force or constant stiffness, crushable mate- rial in the side door and armrest. Using a simulation of the human impact response, a range in crush force or stiffness was deter- mined which reduced the viscous response from that obtained with a rigid impact. NCSS field accident data for car-to-car side impacts provided information on the occupant exposure and injury as a function of the change in velocity (AV) of the struck vehicle. Since the velocity of the side door at contact with the occupant's chest is similar to the AV of the struck vehicle, the chest impact velocity in the simulation was assumed equal to the observed AV in the NCSS data. This related the simulation data to real-world injury data. Reductions in biomechanical response were related to lower injury risk using a sigmoidal injury probability function. This enabled a calculation of a reduction in injured occu- pants for the velocity range in which the EA material was effective. Reductions of up to 30% in seriously injured occupants may be possible with a low stiffness EA material that is effective in low-speed (AV = 4-8 m/s) crashes, whereas either type of padding was ineffective in high-speed crashes (AV &gt; 10 m/s) . THIS STUDY IS an extension of a previous eval- uation (1) of safety benefits with a constant crush force energy absorbing material in side impacts. It evaluates and compares the bene- fits of a constant stiffness EA material with those obtained from the previous evaluation for a constant crush force interface. The study also extends and refines the methodology used to link results from analytical or exper- imental simulation of chest impact responses to projections of real-world safety benefits of padding for occupant protection. Side impact protection research has been actively pursued by NHTSA (2) , various domes- tic automotive companies and the MVMA, and by coordinated efforts in Europe (3,4). There is a consensus among the various studies that have evaluated injuries in side impact crashes that abdominal and thoracic trauma is one of the highest priority areas of occupant protec- tion. This knowledge has led to studies of the potential benefit of padding in the side door and arm rest. One study has shown an approximate 10% effectiveness for padding in the side door and arm rest as an injury coun- termeasure in side crashes (2) . The current study uses a more representa- tive model of the chest impact response (6) than the one used in the NHTSA study. Even though it is a frontal impact biomechanical model, the recent indepth analysis of chest impact biomechanics (11) has shown that the Hybrid III frontal impact response is more closely matched to the recommended side impact force-deflection corridor for the human chest than the SID dummy which is many times s t if fer than the recommended corridor or the EUROSID dummy. In addition to better biofidelity in the chest impact response, a rate-sensitive injury criterion, the viscous response (9,10), has been used because it is the most sensitive measure of injury risk in the high-velocity impacts typical of side-door loading on an occupant. This study also uses a methodology to link changes in biomechanical response from laboratory tests to real-world injury reducing benefits using field accident information (12,13). The analysis also draws upon infor- mation recently obtained on the biofidelity of side-impact dummies and side-impact injury criteria (14) . The new data shows that the frontal impact compliance of the Hybrid III dummy is the closest match to the human chest 3.1452 0096-736X/88/9603- 1 452$02.50 Copyright 1988 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">s ide- impact response and that a compression based criterion, such as the viscous injury criterion, is the most predictive of injury risk. METHODOLOGY MODIFIED LUMPED-MASS MODEL FOR THE CHEST - In 1973 Lobdell (6) published a lumped-mass model of the anteroposterior thoracic impact response of the human thorax. He developed a mechanical analog of the human chest composed of two masses and connecting springs and dash- pots; and, he matched the model's force- deflection response to blunt impact data from human cadaver tests. The mechanical elements in the simulation (Figure 1) were adjusted until the model response fell within the low velocity and high velocity force-thoracic deflection corridors recommended by Kroell (7) as representative of the human biomechanical response. Lobdell' s original lumped-mass model was first modified by Viano (8) in 1978. More recently Viano (1) has included a thickness of constant crush force or constant stiffness energy absorbing material between the rigid impactor and the lumped-mass thoracic model. For the constant crush force interface, the crush force is determined by an input param- eter F and the crush of the interface is given By c = ^ - y2) - Fc/k12. For this type of interface, three different situations may occur: 1) the impact force is below the crush force of the interface and crush has not started, 2) the impact force is equal to or greater than the crush force of the EA mate- rial and the crush of the interface is less l-l m2 /A ' k23S^t* k fr' r k23il P J k12 II c23Lr" J 5 I i j Jl^wv tH'-f L». *FcCc I if kve23 I cve23 "i I / r a D ■ Figure 1: Lumped-mass model of the chest and impacting mass with an energy-absorbing crush- able interface (from (1), modified from (8)). 872213 than its full thickness (C ) , or 3) the maxi- mum velocity of the sternum (y2) is greater than the velocity of the impacting mass (y^) , indicating separation of the chest and the EA interface, or the crush of the EA material has reached its full thickness. For the case of a constant stiffness EA interface, the interface begins to crush immediately upon contact with the chest and the reaction force increases with the amount of crush F = k c , where k is the stiffness constant of the material and the amount of crush is given by cc = k12 (y2 - y1)/(k12 + kc) . For this type of interlace, only two situations can occur during chest interaction with the crushable interface: 1) the crush of the EA material is less than the full thick- ness (Cç) , or 2) the velocity of the sternum (y2) is greater than the velocity of the impacting mass (y^) , again indicating sepa- ration of the EA interface and the chest, or the crush of the EA material has reached its full thickness. The thoracic masses are assumed initially motionless and the impact severity is con- trolled by assigning an impact mass (m^) and initial velocity of impact (yļ(0)). The impact response of the model is computed by Hamming's modified predictor-corrector method, which incorporates a fourth-order procedure with time-steps varied to satisfy a predeter- mined solution accuracy. The response is sequentially calculated until a tensile force is developed in the sternal tissue spring (kj2). In &amp;n actual impact, a tensile force in this spring is representative of separation of the impacting mass (EA interface) from the thorax. The programming features introduced in the 1978 and 1986 modified versions of the model allow the complete impact dynamics to be simulating including the full complement of biomechanical responses as well as the cumula- tive and incremental energy storage and dissi- pation, instantaneous power associated with energy storage and dissipation, and mass ener- gies and momenta (see 1,8). REAL-WORLD SIDE IMPACT INJURIES - Similar to the previous study the NCSS field accident data was used for car-to-car side impacts (12). Occupant exposures and injury risks were determined as a function of the computed change in velocity (AV) of the struck vehicle. The injury risk function (the probability of injury as a function of the change in velocity of the struck vehicle) was computed from the available information on the number of occu- pants exposed and the number injured of sever- ity AIS 3+ for each 1.35 m/s (3 mph) increment of AV (Table 1) . This resulted in 15 incre- ments in AV for the field accident data cov- ering the full range of crashes observed in real -world side impacts. Smoothed injury risk, occupant exposure and occupant injury functions were plotted (Figure 2) for the range of accident severities. These functions define the range of AV which has the greatest exposure of occupants and the AV range which 3.1453</page><page sequence="3">results in the greatest number of seriously injured occupants. PARAMETER STUDY CONDUCTED - A wide range of impact parameters and crushable materials were again simulated using the modified lumped-mass model of the human thorax to determine the influence of constant crush force and constant stiffness material on the biomechanical responses of the thorax. In order to increase the severity of the impact while maintaining control over the parameters selected, an impact mass of 20 kg was fixed for this parameter study as was done in the previous evaluation with a constant crush force material (1) . Again, this impactor mass produces a representative impact duration, energy transfer and final chest velocity to simulate a near-side occupant in a side crash. The velocity of impact was increased so that there was an approximate doubling of kinetic energy between each velocity of impact. The lowest velocity was 5 m/s and a doubling of energy was achieved by a severity of 7 m/s. These impacts are representative of the low and high velocity impact condition used to define the biomechanical response corridors for the human cadaver chest (7,8). Two higher severity impacts were selected to broaden the range of impact exposure and assess the effects of energy-absorbing interfaces on biomechanical responses. The high severity impacts were at 10 m/s and 12.2 m/s. Results for the constant crush force interface were available from the previous study (1) so simu- lations were conducted for a constant stiff- ness interface. The stiffness of the energy- absorbing interface was incremented by 5 kN/m Delta V (m/s) 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 1 1 ' I i ■= 8 - ' ' v J y Injured ' ' '/ J / AIS 3+ * ' Nn^/' 16 " ' ' / / ' ' ' / ' ^ Injury Rate 20 - 'j/ ' ^ AIS 3+ 1 ' x Exposure Rate x 28 I ^ Figure 2: Field accident injury data and exposure information as a function of the severity of impact measured by the delta V or change in velocity of the struck vehicle (from (1), derived from NCSS data analyzed in (12)).

Two thick- nesses of the energy-absorbing interface were simulated, a 5 cm or 10 cm thickness. Each simulation produces a set of biomech- anical responses and includes such responses as contact force, chest deflection (compres- sion), viscous response, sternal and spinal acceleration, crush of the energy-absorbing material, and energies and powers of chest deformation. The most sensitive measure of injury potential for the thorax is the viscous response (9,10) which is the instantaneous product of the velocity of deformation and compression of the thorax during impact. Secondary measures of potential injury are the maximum chest compression and the spinal acceleration but these were not evaluated in this study. RANGE OF BENEFITS FROM AN EA INTERFACE - Method A: The 10% or 20% Benefits Corridors - - The Original Approach Used in The Previous Study (Î) - Stiffness values producing ā reduction of either 10% or 20% in the peak viscous response from that obtained in the rigid impact were determined for each sever- ity of impact. This approach defined a window of response reducing benefit for a stiffness range of crushable interfaces. A 10% or 20% window of benefit was defined for each veloc- ity of impact, representing an increasing severity of blunt loading. When the benefit points are plotted as a function of impact severity, they also define a range or corridor of velocity within which the peak viscous response was reduced by 10%- 20%, &gt; 20%, and 20%-10% for a particular stiffness EA interface. The points also define a straight line relationship between impact severity and material stiffness for a particular amount of reduction in viscous response. The upper limit benefits curves are defined by the severity of the first impact which are controlled by the stiffness of the interface. In contrast, the lower limit bene- fit curves are controlled by the second impact severity which is related to the thickness and stiffness of the interface. Another linear relationship can be defined by this approach and this line identifies the interface crush stiffness for each impact severity which results in the maximum reduction in the peak viscous response (and injury risk). This defines the optimum material stiffness as a function of impact severity. The injury reducing benefits for an energy-absorbing interface in side impacts were assessed by selecting either a 120 kN/m or 80 kN/m crush stiffness for the EA material and identifying the range of velocities where the viscous response was reduced by 10% or 20% from the value obtain with the rigid impact. The probability of injury decreases with reductions in the viscous response (9,10). In the mid-region of the injury probability func- tion, the viscous response is linearly related 872213 to injury risk and has a slope of approxi- mately 1.5 unit decrease in viscous response producing a 1.0 unit decrease in injury risk. For the velocity range with either EA material that produced a 10-20% reduction in viscous response, an average 15% reduction in viscous response was assumed and would lead to an average 10% reduction in injury risk. In the velocity range producing greater than a 20% reduction in viscous response, an average 30% reduction in viscous response was assumed and would result in an averaged 20% reduction in injury risk. As in the previous evaluation (1) , it was possible to link the velocity range of reduced thoracic responses with an EA interface to real-world field accident injury data by rela- ting the AV of the struck vehicle to the impact velocity in the simulation. Since the AY of the struck vehicle closely approximates the (intrusion) velocity of the side door at occupant contact (1) , the link between the simulation and real-world accidents is one-to- one, e.g. the impact velocity in the simula- tion is assumed equal to the AY from field accident data. A reduction in injured occupants was com- puted by lowering the value of injury risk from the NCSS data in the range of velocities where the EA material provides benefit. By reducing the injury risk by 10% or 20% in the effective range of the padding, the lower value of injury risk was multiplied by the actual number of exposed occupants to compute a new, but reduced, number of injured occu- pants. The difference between the actual number injured and the reduced injured repre- sents a savings in injured people for a par- ticular 1.35 m/s increment of AV. Since the velocity corridors of reduced injury risk do not precisely align with the 1.35 m/s incre- ments in the NCSS data, the AY increments were proportioned according to the relative amount of each benefit's corridor in the velocity increment. The reduced number of injured occupants for each velocity corridor was divi- ded by the total number of injured in the original NCSS data set to obtain a fraction of injury reduction for that corridor. Summing the injury reducing fractions over the effec- tive velocity range of the energy-absorbing material gave a projection for the overall benefit (reduction in AIS 3+ injuries) for a particular thickness and stiffness of an interface material. Method B: Addition of 30% and 40% Bene- fits Corridors"^ Since the constant stiffness 1Ã interface resulted in a wider velocity range and greater levels of reduction in bio- mechanical response than was obtained with a constant crush force material (see reference (1)), there was a reason to add two additional pairs of benefit lines corresponding to a 30% or 40% reduction in peak viscous response. The velocity ranges between the upper limit 10%-20%, 20%-30% , 30%-40%, 40%-40% and lower limit 40%-30%, 30%-20%, and 20%-10% benefit 3.1455</page><page sequence="5">lines were determined and as in the previous approach, an injury risk reduction was assigned to each corridor. A 10% reduction was assigned again for the 10%-20% upper limit corridor, 20% injury risk reduction for the 20% - 30% corridor, a 30% risk reduction in the 30%-40% benefit corridor and finally a 40% injury risk reduction for the 40%-40%, upper- lower limit corridors. These additional cor- ridors allowed a more refined evaluation of injury risk reductions for both the 120 kN/m or 80 kN/m interface for a 5 cm or 10 cm thickness . Method C: Injury Reductions Based on the Sigmoidal Injury Probability Function - For low severity rigid impacts (&lt;4 m/s) the values of the viscous response can correspond to a very low probability of injury. In contrast, high severity impacts (&gt;10 m/s) produce vis- cous responses and injury risks that are very high. Since the injury probability function is actually a sigmoidal curve (Figure 3 and Table 2) for chest trauma, a further refine- ment in the evaluation of injury reduction with EA padding involves using the actual injury probability function to determine cor- ridors on the constant crush force versus impact severity plot for 10%, 20%, . . . 50% reduction in injury risk. This approach extends the analysis of (1) . To achieve this interpretation, the viscous response obtained with a rigid impact was related to a probabil- ity of injury for a particular severity of impact using Table 2. The corresponding vis- cous responses with EA padding were then determined for a 10%, 20%, . . . 50% reduction Table 2 PROBABILITY OF INJURY AS A FUNCTION OF THE PEAK VISCOUS RESPONSE (VC&gt;max (m/s) Probability Peak Viscous Response (X) AIS&gt;3 01 .0754 '.02 .1916 .03 .2653 .04 -3208 .05 .3659 .06 .4043 .07 .4380 .08 .4682 .09 .4956 10 . 5208 15 .6253 .20 -7084 .25 -7796 .30 -8436 .35 .9029 .40 .9592 .45 1.0136 .50 1.0672 .55 1.1208 ,60 1.1752 .65 1.2315 .70 1.2908 .75 1.3547 .80 1.4260 .85 1.5090 .90 1.6136 .91 1.6388 .92 1.6662 g3 1 . 6964 .94 1.7300 .95 1.7684 .96 1.8136 97 1.8690 .98 1.9428 ,gg 2.0590 3.1456</page><page sequence="6">in injury probability from the risk associated with a rigid impact. It is then possible to relate this series of viscous responses to a corresponding constant crush force EA inter- face. This defines the values for the upper limit injury reduction points associated with first impacts and lower limit points for a 5 cm or 10 cm thickness interface. Repeating this analysis for the other severities of impact revealed that a straight line connected the points defining the corridors of similar injury reduction for the upper limit benefit's corridors and the lower limit corridors. The calculation of injury reduction in real-world accidents followed identically the procedures used in the previous methods and was carried out for a 6.25 kN and 3.5 kN crush force interface. Method D: Injury Reductj.ons Based on the Percent Reduction in the Probability of Inj ury - The final and most accurate method employed to evaluate injury reductions associ- ated with an EA interface used the injury probability function (Figure 3 and Table 2) for AIS 3+ injury directly with the response data obtained for rigid impacts (baseline injury probability), and responses with a 6.25 kN, 3.5 kN, 80 kN/m and 120 kN/m EA interfaces of 5 cm or 10 cm thickness. The approach does not consider whether the peak viscous response is associated with the first or second impacts and requires simulations at a larger number of severities of impact. Velocities of impact were incremented by 1 m/s from a low of 1 m/s to a high of 18 m/s. For each increment in impact severity, the peak viscous response for a rigid impact and that obtained with a 5 cm or 10 cm thickness of a particular interface PROBIT ANALYSIS OF CHEST INJURIES i-. . 0.8 _ ED50 = 1.07 m/s / / ^ n = 39 cadavers / / Al / / U 2 / / &lt; 0.6 J / / m- ' / - ' ~ 15 0.4- / o / _o / o / Q_ / 0.2- / / 95% Fiducial Limit 0 1 1 1 i i 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 [VC]mox (m/s) Figure 3: Chest injury risk function relating the probability of AIS 3+ injury as a function of the peak viscous response (derived from (9,10)). 872213 was directly related to a probability of AIS 3+ injury from Table 2. It was then straight- forward, to compute a percent reduction in the probability of injury for each interface pair (crush force or stiffness and thickness) . For very low severity impacts the interface crush force could be too high to crush and achieve a reduction in injury probability. For high severity impacts either the impact overwhelmed the response or the injury probability was so high that a negligible reduction in injury probability could be produced by the crushable interface. In the mid-region, injury reduc- tion may be realized. This process resulted in a relationship defining the percent reduc- tion in injury probability as a function of the severity of impact. The calculation of injury reduction in real-world crashes fol- lowed identically the procedures used in the previous methods. INFLUENCE OF CHEST STIFFNESS AND IMPACTOR MASS - Using a constant crush force interface, the influence of a stiff er chest was evaluated to determine whether an incorrect chest stiff- ness in an anthropomorphic test device would alter the interpretation of the "best" EA interface for occupant protection. The spring elements in the Lobdell model (see Figure 1) were doubled in this analysis and the resul- ting viscous responses were compared for a range of crush force interfaces against those obtained with the standard chest stiffness responses. The influence of impactor mass was evaluated by conducting a series of simula- tions using a 7 m/s impact severity, a range of crushable interfaces, but a 10-times increase in the impact mass over that used in the previous simulations, i.e., m^ = 200 kg versus m^ = 20 kg. The resulting viscous responses were compared to determine whether a greater inertia of the impact would alter the interpretations of the "best" EA interface for occupant protection. RESULTS Figure 4 is an example of the biomechan- ical responses obtained with the modified Lobdell model and a constant stiffness inter- face. The reaction force of the energy- absorbing interface increases linearly with crush until its full thickness is used and the impactor becomes essentially a rigid interface (see Table 3). In this example, the full thickness of the EA interface is crushed early and there remains sufficient energy in the impact to increase the impact force. As with a constant crush force interface (see (1)) there can be essentially two impacts occur- ring during the simulation. The first is associated with the initial contact of the energy-absorbing interface with the chest and the response of the chest during crush of the EA material. Using a linearly increasing resistance interface greatly reduces the effects of the first impact as the material is very soft during the initial phase of crush. 3.1457</page><page sequence="7">A second impact may occur when the full crush of the EA interface occurs and there is suf- ficient energy to cause increases in the bio- mechanical responses of the chest. This sec- ond impact can produce the greatest biomechan- ical responses in some cases and in others the maximum severity occurs during the crushing phase of the interface. In this example , a 80 kN/m interface was selected with a 5 cm thickness. The impact severity is 10 m/s. Figure 4 shows that force develops gradually after contact with the chest and within the first 10 ms increases to a maximum value at full crush of the EA inter- face. Full crush of the interface occurs at 11 ms. After crush of the EA material, force on the chest increases and causes more chest deflection. Peak force occurs at 21 ms and is at a level of 6.4 kN. It results in a maximum chest deflection of 0.1 cm at 28 ms. The viscous response of the chest is sensitive to the events occurring during impact and rises gradually during crush of the interface and continues to increase to a maximum value of 1.6 m/s at 16 ms. In this case, the maximum viscous response occurs during the second impact but the EA interface limits an earlier rise in viscous response during crush. This gradual increase in viscous response is an important feature of a linearly increasing force at the interface and is quite different from the responses obtained with a constant crush force material which can have a rapid rise in viscous response during the initial phases of crush. The acceleration of the sternum and spine demonstrate more of the dynamics of the chest response with a constant stiffness interface.

The rapid early acceler- ation of the sternum brings it quickly to a similar velocity as that of the impactor, so there is a gradual decrease in sternal accel- eration during the remaining portion of the interface crush. When the interface bottoms out, a second impact causes another spike in sternal acceleration. In this case the second spike is of much shorter duration and slightly lower magnitude than what had occurred during the first peak. The spinal acceleration response is removed from the sternal dynamics and demonstrates a much smoother response. During crush of the EÀ interface, the spinal acceleration gradually increases and continues to increase during the second impact phase until it reaches a maximum válue of 24 g's at 21 ms. Energy transfer occurs during impact and crush of the interface. The initial 1,000 J energy of the impactor continually decreases until separation at 40 ms where there is a residual velocity of the impactor at separa- tion. As the impactor loses energy, energy is absorbed by crush of the interface, compres- sion of spring elements in the thorax (this is restored to the system as the spring elements expand) , and absorbed by the viscous elements in the chest. Additional energy is trans- ferred to the acceleration of masses in the thoracic model but these energies are not shown. Because of the constant stiffness characteristic and thickness of the interface, 100 J (10% of the impact energy) is absorbed during compression of the interface. There is 872213 a gradual increase in absorbed energy in the chest to a plateau of approximately 280 J which occurs at the point where maximum chest compression is developed. There is a gradual increase above the plateau in absorbed energy as the chest expands. The maximum stored energy in the chest also occurs approximately at maximum compression and is at a level of about 250 J. Figure 5 shows the maximum viscous response as a function of the stiffness con- stant for the energy absorbing interface for impacts at 10 m/s contact velocity. For extremely low stiffness material, the inter- face crushes with virtually no energy absorp- tion and the second impact response after crush mimics that of a rigid impact. As the stiffness constant increases, there is a grad- ual decrease in the maximum viscous response from that obtained in a rigid impact until a minimum is obtained for a given interface thickness. For stiffness constants greater than the value which produces a minimum in viscous response, the viscous response grad- ually increases and not all of the interface is crushed. Even for the stiff est interface evaluated in this study, there is a signifi- cant reduction and peak viscous response. For a 5 cm thickness interface with a crush con- stant of 110 kN/m there was a maximum reduc- tion of 26% in the peak viscous response. There was a 10% reduction in peak viscous response with the stiff est interface material used in this study (275 kN/m) . With a 10 cm interface, a 50 kN/m stiffness constant pro- duced the maximum reduction in peak viscous response of 46%.

For the lower severity impact, a lower crush constant material interface is desirable to result in a maximum reduction in viscous response. A 31% reduction in peak viscous response was observed with a 65 kN/m interface for a 7 m/s impact severity (Figure 6) . The maximum reduction in viscous response increased to 52% for 10 cm thickness interface for this sever- ity of impact. The highest severity impact shifted the optimum stiffness constant to a larger value and the maximum reductions in peak viscous response are proportionately lower. This observation is similar to that found in the previous study (1) which identi- fied an increase in desirable constant crush force as the severity of impact increases and a decrease in proportional benefit in reduc- tions in viscous response. Given the reductions in peak viscous response obtained with the constant stiffness crushable interface shown in Figures 5-7, it is possible to pick off the values of crush stiffness that produce a 10% or 20% reduction in peak viscous response from that obtained with a rigid impact. There is an upper limit pair of stiffness constants associated with an interface that does not completely crush and the maximum viscous response is due to the first impact, and a set of lower limit stiff- ness constants that are a function of the thickness of the interface which completely crushes. Since it is possible to pick these upper and lower limit stiffness constants for each velocity of impact and thickness of interface, it is possible to develop a figure relating the stiffness constant and the sever- ity of impact where lines of constant percent reduction in peak viscous response identify the zones of benefit with an energy absorbing interface. Since the maximum reductions in peak vis- cous response could greatly exceed 20%, the corridors shown in Figure 8 include lines associated with 30% and 40% reductions in peak viscous response. Note that an 80 kN/m crush constant interface provides reductions in viscous response for very low crash severities (it's effective for crashes as low as approxi- mately 3 m/s change in velocity of the struck vehicle) and depending on the thickness of the interface is effective in reducing the viscous response for very severe crashes, particularly for a 10 cm thickness interface which is effective up to 18 m/s change of velocity of the struck vehicle. The effect of an 80 kN/m crush constant interface on reducing the vis- cous response is shown in Figure 9 where the injury reducing benefits according to Method A (10% and 20% benefits corridor approach used in the previous study (1)) are shown super- imposed on the data presented in Figure 8.

A 10 cm thick- ness would produce a 17.3% reduction in injured occupants according to Method A. Computation of the injury reducing bene- fits with the 80 kN/m constant interface using Method B provides an identical prediction of injury reduction for a 5 cm thickness since a 30% reduction in peak viscous response was not observed with that stiffness constant and thickness of material. In contrast however, with 10 cm thickness of interface reductions in injury risks above 20% were observed for a relatively wide range of crash severities. This increased the prediction of injury redu- cing benefits to 21.68% (see Figure 9). A similar analysis of injury reduction was con- ducted for a higher stiffness constant (120 kN/m) and resulted in projected reductions in injured occupants with AIS 3+ trauma according to Method A of 9.67% with a 5 cm thickness interface and 13.79% with a 10 cm thickness (Figure 10) . A similar analysis was conducted with the 120 kN/m stiffness constant according to Method B and resulted in a slightly differ- ent projected reduction in injured occupants of 8.67% with a 5 cm thickness and 15.4% with a 10 cm thickness. The results of the analy- sis according to Methods A and B in overall side-impact harm (13) reduction are 1.0% - 2.6% (Table 5). Method C improves upon the calculation of injury reduction benefits of an energy absor- bing interface by recognizing that the injury risk function is actually a sigmoidal curve. This implies that reductions in injury risks are not linearly proportional to a reduction in viscous response except in the mid-portion of the sigmoidal response (see Figure 3) . The approach used in Method C determines the injury risk for a particular severity of impact based on the value of viscous response and the associated injury probability predic- ted by Figures 3 and Tables 2. Thus, a 10% through 100% reduction in injury probability of severity AIS 3-«- could be determined and related to a level of VC (viscous response) from the injury risk functions.

Figure 11 represents the relations obtained where the lines indicated by 10% - 60% represent curves of constant reduction in injury risk of sever- ity AIS 3+. It was possible to compute the effects of a 3.5 kN and 6.25 kN crushable interface of 5 cm and 10 cm thickness on redu- cing real -world injuries in side crashes and benefits in total harm reduction (Table 6) . The final method employed to determine the injury reduction benefits of an energy absor- bing interface (Method D) involved the devel- opment of a continuous function relating the percent reduction in probability of AIS 3+ injury and the velocity of impact. Figure 12 shows the peak viscous response as a function of impact velocity with a rigid interface and with two constant crush force pads of 5 cm or 10 cm thickness and crush force of 3.5 kN and 6.25 kN. For the 3.5 kN constant crush force interface, the energy absorbing pad reduces the peak viscous response for impacts of greater than 6 m/s velocity. The reductions in viscous response are limited to an interval of impact velocity as the 5 cm curve approaches the rigid response for severities of impact approaching 12 m/s. The range of benefit is larger for the 10 cm thickness pad but also approaches the rigid response for the higher severity impacts. Superimposed on this curve is a line just above VC = 2.0 m/s which repre- sents a viscous response associated with a 99% probability of AIS 3+ injury. With a 3.5 kN crush force interface, the velocity range of reduced viscous response is below the 99% injury probability level. 3.1464</page><page sequence="14">872213 Table 6 BENEFITS OF ENERGY-ABSORBING PADDING IN SIDE IMPACT PROTECTION Evaluation Using Method C: Injury Reductions Based on the AIS 3+ Injury Probability Function Crush Force 5 cm 10 cm 6.25 kN 4.93(0.59) 6.17(0.74) 3.50 kN 18.76(2.25) 25.36(3.04) * See Footnote Table 4. 3.0 i -j j j / 1 5 cm 110 cm No Pad / I J 625 kN P(AIS &gt; 3) « .99 &gt;/ i £ / /ôcm/lOcm 10 ~ / J ^/3.5 kN o.oLd_J_J ' I ' I I I 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 Impact Velocity (m/s) Figure 12: Demonstration of the potential reductions in peak viscous response with a 5 or 10 cm thickness of constant crush force interfaces of 3.5 or 6.25 kN crush force, and the range of benefit in reduced peak viscous response in relation to the 99% injury probability line for AIS 3+ trauma. 3.1465</page><page sequence="15">100 ļ- -, 80 - S« cA 3.5 kN ' Ia1 r' 1 • &lt; / ' ' $£ 40- ļ I ļ 10 cm ļ 5 cm ' ļ J i i iii ivV i i i 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 Impact Velocity (m/s) Figure 13: Percent reduction and probability of AIS 3+ injury for a 3.5 kN constant crush force interface of 5 cm or 10 cm thickness (note that a comparable curve could not be drawn for a 6.25 kN crush force interface since its projected reductions in AIS 3+ injury risk were zero over the range of impact severities.) When the reduced viscous responses are converted to a percent reduction in probabil- ity of injury, the velocity range of benefit is clearly identified (Figure 13) . For impacts above 6 m/s severity, there is a con- tinual increase in the reduction in injury risk until a maximum value is obtained at a level approaching 65% lower risk. For sever- ities of impacts above that level, the reduc- tions in injury risk drop off until a severity level is reached where there is no benefit of the energy absorbing interface. Using Figure 13 and the actual real-world side impact injury data from the NCSS analysis, it is possible to project a 15.3% reduction in injured occupants with a 5 cm thick pad (Table 7). There is a slight increase in projected benefit with a 10 cm thick pad and the ulti- mate prediction of benefit and total harm reduction is on the order of 2.2%.

When a curve similar to Figure 13 was attempted, the reduc- tion in viscous response for these severe impacts did not produce a reduction in injury risk. A pad of this constant crush force would be projected to have no benefit in redu- cing real-world occupant injuries and would have no effect on reducing total harm, primar- ily because its range of effectiveness is in such severe impacts that the injury probabil- ities are well above 99% and are not effected by the reductions in viscous response. A similar analysis was carried out for a constant stiffness interface of 80 kN/m and 120 kN/m. The resulting projections for reductions in AIS 3+ injury risk are shown in Figures 14 and 15. Because the resistance for this type of energy absorbing interface is very low for low crush, the range of effec- tiveness is much broader than with a constant crush force type material. The threshold 20% reduction in injury risk for the lowest sever- ity crashes (1-4 m/s) increases to a plateau of approximately 50% reduction and then drops off for higher severity impacts as the full thickness of the interface is crushed in higher energy impacts. The lower crush con- stant interface produces a greater reduction in injury risk than that obtained with the 120 kN/m pad, which has a threshold of approxi- mately 10% injury reduction and a maximum of approximately 35% reduction in injury risk for an 8 m/s impact. The benefits of this type of interface on reducing real world injuries and the effect on total harm are shown in Table 7. Clearly, these projections for a constant crush force and constant stiffness crushable material are probably the most accurate based on the assumptions of this analysis procedure. 100 90 - 80 - ~ 70 - o" z Al 60 - 50 - *Í 40 - / '' 10 Cm 30 - f ' ' 80 kN/m 10 - 5 cm 1 °0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 Velocity of Impact (m/s) Figure 14: Percent reduction in the probabil- ity of AIS 3+ injury for a constant 80 kN/m stiffness interface of 5 cm or 10 cm thick- ness. 872213 They indicate a potential reduction of 15% - 35% in AIS 3+ injury with properly selected materials and potential reductions in total harm of 2% - 4% in side impact crashes which currently account for 12% of the total crash injury harm. A study was conducted to evaluate the potential differences in selecting optimum materials for an energy absorbing interface if the stiffness of the thoracic model or dummy were greater than that of the human. In this study, the spring constants in the Lobdell model were doubled and the resulting changes in viscous response, contact force and chest compression were compared for a 7 m/s impact severity with a constant crush force interface of 5 cm thickness. Figure 16 shows that the two-times stiff er chest (or dummy) would gen- erally show lower levels of peak viscous response for the full range of interface crush forces, and would slightly increase the pro- jected optimum EA interface crush force from that obtained with the baseline chest stiff- ness. However, the shifts in response may be considered minimal in the context of the full range of impact exposures evaluated in this and the previous (1) study, but they would have an effect on any final decisions or con- clusions made on the most appropriate EA interface. They would though result in slightly stiffer interfaces than would be projected by the base-line human response. Figure 17 shows the effect of the different stiffness dummy on the resulting peak impact force and chest compression, and again demon- strates similar shifts in response. The stif- fer dummy would produce lower levels of com- pression for the full range of interface crush forces. On the basis of this analysis, a two- time increase in chest stiffness would result in an approximate 20% increase in optimum crush force (see Figure 16) for an energy absorbing interface. 100 90 - 80 - gS » - «-* Al 0 0 - O *§ O &lt; 50 - O &lt; 40 - c ~ 30 - f 120 kN/m ~ J 5 cm ^ 10 - ~ 10 cm 0 1 1 1 1 1 - i « 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 Velocity of Impact (m/s) Figure 15: Percent reductions in the proba- bility of AIS 3+ injury for a constant 120 kN/m stiffness interface of 5 cm or 10 cm thickness . 3.1467</page><page sequence="17">The influence of impactor mass on resul- ting projections was evaluated by conducting a simulation using a 7 m/s impact severity but an impact mass of 20 kg (baseline) and one 10- times greater (200 kg) . The resulting peak viscous response for a 5 cm thickness material of various constant crush force is shown in Figure 18 and demonstrates that the heavier mass shifts the perceived optimum constant crush force to a higher level. The baseline response would project an optimum at approxi- mately a 2.4 kN constant crush force to reduce the viscous response and the 10-times heavier impacting mass would shift this optimum to a level of approximately 3.7 kN. This repre- sents greater than a 50% increase in perceived optimum interface characteristic. Similar dramatic shifts were observed in the peak impactor force and chest compression (Figure 19), which reflect similar trends. While these shifts seen dramatic, they have a much smaller effect on any ultimate projections of optimum EA interface characteristic and calcu- lations of injury reduction with side impact padding . The heavier mass impactor essentially produces a shift in the linkage between the impact velocity of the analytical simulation and the real -world AY accident exposures. To account for a heavier mass impactor, the simu- lation could be shifted to the right such that 7 m/s impact velocity in the simulation is associated with an 8.5 m/s impact AY in real- world crashes.

Thus, the effective shift is from an apparent 7 m/s impact severity with a lower mass (20 kg) impactor to an "equivalent" 8.5 m/s impact severity (a 20Ä increase) with the heavier mass. The effect on any eventual projections of injury reduction would result in over-esti- mation (higher values) of the "best" interface crush force or stiffness to achieve maximum reduction in injuries in real -world crashes. DISCUSSION The results of the previous analysis of potential injury reductions in side impact crashes (1) indicated that EA material inter- faces may have more potential for occupant protection than previously thought by safety experts (2) . While that represented an encouraging conclusion in terms of potential gains obtained with EA interfaces, it stimu- lated more analysis and study of the process employed and the material characteristics used to optimize the selection of an energy absor- bing interface for occupant protection. The current study extended that earlier analysis (1) by investigating other material character- istics and employing more refined procedures, based upon the experience and knowledge gained in the first study. This effort has resulted in a simpler, more direct and improved method- ology (Method D) to evaluate potential gains in occupant protection by energy absorbing interfaces. « 0 - - - - - » 60 ^^Impactor 50 ' X Force I 4 0 - ' - 40 O • ' « £ ' ' S o o x1 Compression S jć ^ • 2 0 - S 20 i/t e Chest Stillness w IL 1.0 - - 10 0.0 I I I I I I 0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 Crush Force (kN) Figure 17: The effect of chest stiffness on the developed impact force and compression of the chest as a function of the constant crush force of the EA interface. 3.1468</page><page sequence="18">The results of this study show that much greater reductions in occupant injury may be realized with the appropriate selection of material type and characteristic for an energy absorbing interface. By shifting from mate- rials that are effective in the most severe accident exposures to softer materials that work in the range where the greatest number of severe injuries are occurring (the lower severity accident exposures) , reductions in the range of 15% - 35% in AIS 3+ injuries may be possible with EA material thicknesses of 5 cm - 10 cm. The results of this new analysis are encouraging and indicate potential gains in occupant protection and harm reduction by side impact padding. However, this study should continue to be considered a first step in the development of a more refined procedure for the selection of engineering requirements for occupant safety systems. Obviously the ultimate goal of this type of analysis is the eventual formulation of a scientific basis for safety engineering which recognizes the wide range of crash severities in which occupants are injured, provides assurance that safety measures are effective over the greatest range of crash exposures, and involves impact testing and evaluations 5 cm, 7 m/s I 0.8 - ' / £ ' / mļ = 20 kg 0.4 - 0.2 - 0.0 I I I I I I 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 Crush Force (kN) Figure 18: The effect on peak viscous responses for an impact with a mass 10 times that of the baseline impact mass used in this and the previous (1) study. 872213 that focus on crashes where the greatest num- ber of injuries are occurring, rather than an arbitrarily selected high-severity crash expo- sure. This is particularly important since the results of this study indicate that opti- mization of EA material interfaces in high- severity crash exposures may lead to the selection of materials that have negligible if not zero effect on improving occupant protec- tion (see particularly the projected benefits of a high constant crush force material which might be identified as the optimum to reduce a biomechanical response from a dummy test but which on the basis of this analysis would be projected to have absolutely no benefit in reducing real-world occupant injuries) . Hope- fully, this type of analysis is the first of a series of efforts to develop and refine a scientific basis for safety engineering which ultimately will result in better engineering practices for the reduction of real-world injury and harm, and for injury control. This and the previous (1) analysis con- cludes that paddings should be matched to crashes where the greatest number of injuries are occurring in real-world accidents. It points particularly to the risks of selecting tests that are of very high severity even though they indicate a significant reduction in biomechanical response from either a simu- lation or dummy test.

The viscous injury response represents a sophisticated biomechanical measure of injury risk to the chest and abdomen and is sensitive to factors that influence occupant protection. It was selected as the measure for comparing performance in this paper because it varies greatly through the entire impact exposure and is sensitive to many aspects of the impact event, including the effects of first and second impact with an EA interface. Chest compression could have been used. However, since chest compression may be thought of as the cumulative effect of many influences that are occurring during an impact exposure, its maximum value occurs rather late. While its trends generally follow those of the viscous response, differences in peak value are much less robust than those obtained with the vis- cous response. In addition, it does not point to time-points within the impact as the vis- cous response does. We believe the viscous response is helpful in pointing to the various events during impact which are important, and thus maximizes the opportunity to identify countermeasures that may be effective in redu- cing the potential for injury. The projections of injury and harm redu- cing benefit should be considered within the context of the assumptions used in this analy- sis. Although the use of the peak viscous response has provided more insight into the dynamics of chest impact response and injury potential, there are many assumptions that have been made to link the various aspects of the analysis together. In particular, the assumption has been made that the base-line response upon which to evaluate injury reduc- tions is that of a "rigid" impact exposure. Obviously, in real-world accident situations, the side interior of the vehicle has compli- ance and thus would be better represented by a material with some deflection characteristic. This would, in effect, reduce the projections of benefit by an energy-absorbing interface and thus would lead to lower realizations in real-world accidents with any particular EA interface. As such, the projections in reduced occupant injury by this and the pre- vious (1) analysis should be considered an "upper-bound" of what might be realized in real -world accidents. The study again has not focused on the comparable benefits that might be realized by an energy-absorbing interface or structural- vehicle modifications. Structural changes may reduce the effective contact velocity or severity of impact on the occupant. The inclusion of the later type or benefit analy- sis may be useful prior to any ultimate evalu- ation of the effectiveness of a particular countermeasure in side impact protection. However, this analysis does offer promise to the safety benefits of impact padding when the material and its characteristics are optimized in crashes where the greatest numbers of injuries are occurring, and where the padding is effective in reducing injury risk on the steepest portion of the sigmoidal response (clearly not in the areas of the asymptotic response at 100% probability or zero probabil- ity of injury), and where all the factors of crash injury protection are considered in the context of the wide diversity of real-world accidents . CONCLUSIONS 1) A constant stiffness EA interface produces greater projected reductions in real- world injuries because it is very soft for small amounts of crush and therefore is more effective in reducing injury risks for low severity crashes. While a constant crush force interface has a specific velocity inter- val of effectiveness, a constant stiffness material is effective over a broad range of crash severities. 2) A more refined analysis of the injury reducing potential of EA materials indicates that while in some cases there may be a negli- gible if not zero benefit obtained with a selected EA material characteristic, there is a 15% - 35% potential reduction in injury risk for a properly selected EA interface. Using the most refined analysis procedure, projected reductions in AIS 3+ injuries and total harm in side impacts are given in Table 7. 3) This study and the previous (1) has sought to develop a scientific basis for safety engineering by assessing the effective- ness of padding through the use of analytical simulation, injury risk functions, accident exposure data, and injury data from real-world crashes. The study has not addressed the comparable benefits that might be obtained with other countermeasures for side impact, such as reductions in the velocity of side- door intrusion. 4) The results of these studies should be considered upper bounds for the realizable gains in occupant protection using constant stiffness or crush EA materials in these con- figurations alone. In addition f the injury and harm reduction projections would be much less if critical or fatal injuries were con- sidered as the target for safety improvement. 5) Finally, the study points to the risk of using a single high-severity test for the development of occupant protection systems. It is possible to design a safety system that reduces dummy responses in such a test, but the design may not result in as great a bene- fit in real-world injury reductions as would be achieved with designs optimized around severities where the greatest number of severe injuries are occurring. 3.1470</page><page sequence="20">872213 REFERENCES 1.
