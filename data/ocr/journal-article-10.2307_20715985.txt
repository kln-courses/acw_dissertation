<plain_text><page sequence="1">Becoming Japanese: Manga, Children's Drawings, and the Construction of National Character* Brent Wilson The Pennsylvania State University Introduction: Cultural Influences in Children's Drawings We now have considerable evidence that children in various parts of the world draw humans, animals, and objects differently (Aronsson &amp; Anderson, 1996; Wilson, 1987; Wilson &amp; Litgvoet, 1992; Wilson &amp; Wilson, 1979,1981,1984). Although cultural graphic influences on the style of children's draw ings have been documented, the conse quences of these influences on children's lives have not been studied. If one culture provides graphic models that are radically different from those of another, and if chil dren use those models, do they affect the way children see themselves, influence the way they conceive of their society, deter mine the way they construct their views of the world, and perhaps even govern how they live their lives? If we are to understand the role that artmaking plays in the lives of children, we need to pose questions such as these and search for answers. One of the predominant cultural graphic influences on the style of young people's drawings is that of the popular media; there may be no country where the influence is more pronounced than in Japan (Wilson, 1997). As I will show, when Japanese chil * Some of the research reported in this paper was originally presented as "Empire of signs revisited: Children's manga and Japan's changing face"?a keynote paper delivered at the symposium, "The Cultural Context: Comparative Studies of Art Education and Children's Drawings," The Nordic Visual Arts Education Network, Vilnius, Lithuania, April 23-27, 1997.

The influence becomes ubiqui tous, as Japanese children grow older. The strong manga influence present in Japa nese children's drawings provides an op portunity to study the role of media in pro viding models through which children un derstand themselves and their society. The use of manga by Japanese children also provides an opportunity to study the "collu sion" between commercial forces and chil dren in shaping conceptions of national identity. A Graphic Narration Task: Classifications of Characters and Styles I am currently conducting two related inquir ies of Japanese children's graphic narra tives. One study involves an analysis of the matic content and narrative structure of these manga-influenced graphic narratives. The second more basic study, reported here, is an analysis of manga types and characters. As a researcher, however, I find myself torn between modern and postmodern desires. On the one hand I feel a compulsion to study cognition, to present classifications, and to point to a table of sta tistics relating to the types of characters Japanese children depict in their graphic narratives. On the other hand, what I really wish to do is to read the graphic narrative characters as signs that will inform us about children, art, and culture. I'll try to have it both ways. Children's sequential narrative drawings have been studied for two decades (Wil son &amp; Wilson, 1983,1987). In 1988, as part 48 VISUAL ARTS RESEARCH ? 2000 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois</page><page sequence="2">of an ongoing cross-cultural study of children's story drawings, I visited various regions of Japan to collect samples of young peoples' drawings. In schools in and around Joyetsu, Monbetsu, Nagasaki, Osaka, and Utsinomya, 1151 students in kindergarten, second, fourth, and sixth grades were given sheets of 12 16 1/2 inch paper on which six 4 1/4x4 3/4 inch frames were printed. Instructions were to draw a story by creat ing characters, placing them in settings, showing what happens, what happens next, and how things finally turn out. In short, stu dents were asked to respond to a task to produce graphic narratives much like those that they were accustomed to seeing in manga. The Classifications Preliminary analyses of Japanese children's graphic narratives revealed that the popu lar media, especially manga and anima (ani mated cartoons) strongly influenced their drawings. In fact, Japanese children's draw ings so closely resembled manga and anima that it was possible to develop a clas sification system based on specific types of manga characters. The method of clas sification, in effect, consisted of asking, "what are the sources of the characters children put in their drawings and are those human, animal, and other characters drawn using the shapes and configurations for bodies, heads, eyes, hair, limbs, etc. that are found in commercially produced manga and anima?" Figures 1-3 illustrate the major classifi cations used. They include (a) doll-like char acters?the contemporary paradigmatic manga female type's heart-shaped face (al though some are drawn with a flattened chin), saucer-shaped eyes, and razor-cut hair (the bodies range from elongated Barbie-like bodies to diminutive Cupie-doll types); (b) animals and birds?the most common is an anthropomorphic rabbit with enormous stylized ears and simple facial and body features (including other animals such as cats, bears, foxes, birds, and turtles?fish were not included in this clas sification); (c) cyborgs and Superheroes? the classification includes robotic types and humans with extraordinary powers; the most common cyborgs are an atomic-pow ered cat named Doraemon, superhuman samurai warriors, and robotic types; (d) monsters are limited to a few Godzilla types usually depicted as no larger than house hold pets; (e) comic characters include a variety of types, nearly all of which invite derision because of their peculiar features and abnormalities; (f) other manga types consist primarily of humans, mostly males, with a variety of stylized features such as large eyes and shaggy hair, and vegetables and flowers often depicted with human char acteristics; (g) mixed types contain hints of some of the features from one or more of the foregoing manga types combined with features associated with Japanese child art; and (h) non-manga drawings?humans and animals (of the types children either bor row from one another, learn to draw from their observations of photographs and non manga illustrations, or sometimes learn to draw by themselves). The non-manga clas sification also includes things such as ar chitectural structures, automobiles, space ships, etc. containing features that are sometimes found in manga but which are difficult to attribute to specific manga styles. Some non-manga drawings are clearly as sociated with child art, others are stick fig ures, while a sizable number depict sports figures such as baseball players (often simi lar to the life-like figures found in manga sports stories but with insufficient charac teristics to identify them specifically with manga). Finally, in the case of the young est children, the classification included scribbles, and geometric and amorphous shapes. Most of the narrative sequences con sisted of six frames, but some children used as few as three and others as many as 16 frames. In the analysis process all the frames were reviewed to determine whether one or more manga-Xype characters were present in the sequence. (1) If one or more manga-type characters were present, the one most dominant or the most character Becoming Japanese 49</page><page sequence="3">. C. Figure 1. (A) Manga "Doll Types, " (B) Animals, and (C) Cyborgs 50 Brent Wilson</page><page sequence="4">istically manga character was classified. (2) When there was no clear indication of one or more manga-Wke types in the narratives, a determination was made regarding the presence of features that were influenced by manga, but did not follow a paradigmatic manga style. These characters were clas sified as "mixed types." (3) When charac ters, other objects, and things appeared not to have been influenced by manga they were placed in the non-manga classifica tion. The Presence of Manga and Non-manga Types in Japanese Children's Graphic Narratives Table 1 shows a variety of different patterns in the use of manga characters by Japa nese children. Only two-percent of kinder garten children produce the paradigmatic "doll" figure. By sixth grade, however, 19 percent of the drawings contain this "doll" figure as the dominant type. Twelve percent of the kindergartners produce a prototypi cal animal character, and by second grade, 18 percent of the children's narratives are built around these cuddly creatures. It is no table, however, that the incidence of cud dly creatures declines between second and sixth grade. Seven percent of the narratives, from kindergarten through sixth grade, are based on a cyborg character and there is little difference in usage among the grades. it is interesting that monsters are hardly used by any group. The presence of comic types is rare in kindergarten and second grade drawings, while fourth and sixth grade students employ comic types in their draw ings between four and five percent of the time. The use of other manga types in creases steadily from one percent in kin dergarten to 25 percent in sixth grade. The classification "mixed types" reveals that a third of the kindergarten children may have tried to draw manga characters, but didn't quite succeed. From second through sixth grade the presence of mixed types de clines?perhaps indicating a growing mas tery of manga features and types. Finally there is a decline in the presence of non manga types after kindergarten (46 per cent). Approximately one third of the draw ings of second through sixth grade depict non-manga styles and types. When the types are combined for all four groups, 46 percent of Japanese children's drawings in the sample show the direct in fluence of manga. When this figure is com bined with the mixed types, two thirds of the Japanese drawings are influenced by manga. The influence of manga is probably even higher than the data reveal. Some of the realistically drawn sports characters and things such as automobiles, space ships, and architectural structures found in manga, but not easily identifiable as manga styles, must surely have affected the children's Table 1.

Moreover, many of the children who chose not to draw manga-iype char acters in their stories, probably could have?if they had been invited to. In short, the influence of manga on the characters and features of Japanese children's narrative drawings is enormous. What are the consequences of Japanese children's use of manga models? What do these findings tell us about Japanese chil dren and Japanese society? The Semiotic Analysis of Japanese Children's Narrative Drawings: Pretexts and Texts The entire Japanese manga industry can be seen as an enormous sign that contains a collection of other signs that when read, tell things about the Japanese people. When Japanese children create their own versions of manga, their modeling of adult manga may also be viewed as a sign com posed of other signs. Every individual manga sequence drawn by a Japanese child becomes a sign that contains a col lection of other signs. Therefore, Japanese children and their drawings can be under stood by reading them as signs in relation ship to larger signs and their constituent signs. That is to say, any individual drawing by a child can be read as a text that tells (1 ) something about the child and his or her interests, values, purposes, etc.; (2) about art including child art?its types, features, and functions; (3) about society and cul ture?the range of beliefs that individuals living together hold about themselves, about values, and about goals they either share or disagree about; and (4) when the children's works are interpreted, those in terpretations also tell us something about their interpreters. The signs found within and around the drawings of children provide connections to what has been called "ab sent items"?the things for which the signs stand (Bal, 1992, p. 215). Just as in the in terpretation of adult art, the meaning of the art of the child becomes possible only through a tension created among: (1) the pre-texts (Pollock, 1993, p. 530)?to both the dimensions of reality to which the child refers and the artistic traditions that affect the child's work, (2) the texts?the child's art works themselves, and (3) the post text?the interests, values, and assump tions of the interpreters of child art (includ ing both children and adults). In other words, when we study children's art, we must look not only at what the child has represented, but at its antecedents; and we must also look at ourselves and others in the act of studying child art. Pretext: The Manga Industry We have no graphic equivalent to Japan's manga industry in the West. In the United States, a sizable number of young people read comic books at some time in their lives. In Japan nearly every child reads manga every week. Almost forty-percent of all books and magazines sold in Japan are manga (Schodt, 1996, p. 20). Manga are published for pre-school and early school age children. During the middle-school years manga take a decidedly gender-ori ented turn; separate books are published for pre-teen and teenage girls and boys. A single weekly of around 400 to 450 pages (some monthlies have over 900 pages) might contain 20 or more serialized sto ries?romance, seduction, pets, tennis, horseback riding, and adventure for girls, and for boys, Judo, historical fantasy, bas ketball, gag/slapstick, science fiction, soc cer, police, comedy, baseball, and psycho chic/occult. A steady reader of a single manga will devour over 1,600 pages each month, and it is worth noting that young people often purchase several different manga which they can "read" at great speed?four hundred pages in about half an-hour. The industry has created consumers with voracious appetites for the various manga genres. To publish manga is to engage in a highly competitive business. What encour ages such passionate "reading"? Publish ing a successful magazine means gaining the profits that come from selling more than six million copies of a single magazine each 52 Brent Wilson</page><page sequence="6">week. To attract and keep this kind of read ership, manga artists and their publishers must keep readers "hooked" by maintain ing their current stable of characters in a perpetual state of romantic and adventur ous uncertainty. At the same time they must create new characters which, if appealing enough, will gain a vast new readership and new profits. There are literally thousands of manga characters, and new manga char acters are continually being created to re place less successful ones. In giving birth to new characters, however, manga artists and publishers walk a narrow line between convention and innovation. New creations must look like the manga characters which have already seduced readers; at the same time they must appear more attractive (or unattractive, as the case may be), possess greater powers, and do more marvelous things than the existing characters their cre ators hope they will replace. Once having developed the voracious appetite for nar ratives and characters, manga artists and publishers must feed it with endless varia tions on familiar themes. It is the Japanese young people them selves who, rather than remaining mere passive readers and consumers of manga, consort with the forces of artistic capitalism. They organize manga clubs; it is estimated that there are as many as 50,000 manga clubs or circles in Japan (Schodt, 1996, p. 37). Young people create their own manga characters, draw stories, and share them with others. The means they use to share their work is fascinating and tremendously important. Young people mimic the commer cial aspects of manga by publishing d?jinshi?Xhe\r own manga magazines or "fanzines." Then at manga or comic book markets they rent booths in order to sell their creations. These markets, some large and some small, are held throughout Japan. The summer 1999 Tokyo Comic Market called "Comike" contained approximately 22,000 booths and perhaps as many as 100,000 different manga publications created by young people. Clubs with names like "Ac tive Boys," "Cry Wolf," and "Honey Dip" com pete for prizes, advertise, and sell their pub Iications?primarily to other young people. Japanese children have recreated for them selves the very conditions that fuel the adult manga industry. Their motives, however, are probably more for fun than for profit. The Texts Should we be surprised that so many of the characters in the children's story drawings have manga types as their source? Cer tainly the magnitude of the relationship be tween popular art and child art is unprec edented anywhere in the world. What does it mean when an entire nation of manga cre ators and consumers, adults and children alike, decides that these are the characters through which it will play out its fantasies? Because the appropriation of manga char acters is perpetuated on such a massive scale, if we understood the phenomenon, then would we gain insights into Japanese people through their youngest members? This is the central question I wish to ad dress. In offering my initial interpretations of the meaning of the manga character types appropriated by children I am some what confident of my ability to understand children's drawings and graphic narratives and much less confident about comment ing on the character of an entire nation. My readings are tentative at best. Nevertheless, I take pleasure in providing a multiplicity of readings, and even in giving contradictory interpretations. Female Dolls with Saucer-shaped Eyes. What is it that fascinates us West erners about the Japanese face? It is the eye. Barthes (1982) connected the Japa nese eyelid to calligraphy. Likening an eye to forming an ideographic character, he wrote, it is this same tracing of a pressure which we rediscover in the Japanese eye. As if the anatomist-calligrapher set his full brush on the inner corner of the eye and, turning it slightly, with a single line, as it must be in painting a la prima, opens the face with an elliptical slit which he closes toward the temple with a rapid turn of his hand; the stroke is perfect because simple, Becoming Japanese 53</page><page sequence="7">immediate, instantaneous, and yet r pe as those circles which it takes a lifetime to learn to make in a single sovereign ges ture (p. 99). And how very different the contemporary manga eye is from the elegant narrow line of Barthes' description and also how differ ent from women's eyes in the woodcuts of Hokusai (the original manga). Today's manga faces come with enormous circular eyes. Indeed, with their blond hair, the faces of these Barbie doll-like females have the appearance of "the other." It is almost as if the entire nation has conspired to change its face from Asian to Caucasian. Manga artists draw these non-Japanese humans with eyes that sometimes fill a third of the face, and their eager young appren tices do them one better?sometimes fill ing half the facial area with eyes the size of headlights. In their narrative drawings many young Japanese children demonstrate that they have mastered the manga eye; eyes sparkle with huge highlights, star bursts, and pearl-like strings of secondary high lights. The children have mastered even more than the expressive eyes. When coupled with mouth shapes, hand gestures, and body language they clearly signal an amazing array of emotions and states of being: eagerness, apprehension, seductive ness, distress, wonder, innocence, evil. (These expressive features are seldom found in children's drawings which have not been influenced by manga.) Although the graphic models had their origin with the work of adult manga artists, now that young people circulate their creations through d?jinshi, models for drawing manga char acters travel from child to child through d?jinshi clubs and market catalogues. In fluences travel from top to bottom, laterally, and if we were to examine them closely perhaps influences might even be found to travel from gifted younger children to older ones. We might even look to see if adult manga artists are influenced by their younger counterparts. This speculation not withstanding, manga models are there to follow, and follow them children do?with astonishing skill. But why are the models there in the first place? Why is it that over 90 percent of the female figures found in young peoples' manga convention catalogues have eyes that contradict the anatomical Japanese eye? Schodt (1983) claims that it is evi dence of a "revolution in the way Japanese people view?or wish to view themselves" (p. 92). I agree, and I also think that there are both simpler and more complicated rea sons. Any creator of cheesecake art knows that humans are attracted to large eyes. "Make the eyes like saucers and you can get away with anything," that's what my Detroit landlord and airbrush school owner, J. Zeller Allen, taught me in 1957. But we also need to look further. The Japanese are attracted to foreign physiognomies, espe cially Nordic types. "An aesthetic fascina tion for the West is . . . evident in modern Japan. Fashion magazines use blondes from Sweden and California to show Japa nese designed clothes; Caucasian dum mies stand stiffly in Japanese shop win dows; students decorate their dormitory walls with Playboy magazine pinups" (Buruma, 1984, p. 51). I think that the doll-like figures represent "the Japanese" and "the other" simulta neously. The doll-like figures provide a way for Japanese people to construct, for ex ample, the "wide-eyed" features that they see in and admire about themselves, but they also reveal a longing for more of that feature?to look more as "the other" looks. Is it also possible that by drawing these doll like figures, Japanese children think of themselves as possessing these idealized features while at the same time, uncon sciously, expressing a dissatisfaction with themselves? Animals: Mostly Rabbits. In Japan chojugiga, ink scrolls showing humorous pictures of birds and animals engaging in human activities, were painted as early as the twelfth century (Schodt, 1983, p. 30). In the famous chojugiga in the Kozanji Bud dhist temple near Kyoto, rabbits, foxes, monkeys, and frogs converse, read, and gesture. Indeed, the chojugiga are the fore runners of manga. Contemporary manga, 54 Brent Wilson</page><page sequence="8">especially those created for preschool age children, are filled with animal characters? especially rabbits. When animals are depicted as humans, we may assume that different animal spe cies provide ways to examine particular human traits of character and behavior. Monkeys, as the young Chinese artist Yani (Wai-Ching Ho, 1989) shows, provide ways to explore deviousness, playfulness, and mischief. But what is the meaning of the placid huggable rabbit with large ears, found in manga produced for very young people and reproduced by young children? My reading is this: the rabbit is a cipher, albeit a cute one. Although visually appeal ing, the rabbit's most notable characteris tic is a blankness that when reproduced time and time again results in the very epitome of sameness. Is the rabbit a sign of conformity and of the complacency de sired especially in little girls? Does the rab bit character provide the opportunity to practice staying in line, being satisfied with following rules, doing ordinary things? Is it a sign that one should be like everyone else?not to stand out within the group? Is it the ultimate sign of cohesion where indi vidual interests and desires are subordi nated to those of the group? At the very least, when young children borrow animal characters such as the rabbit from manga, personality is reduced nearly to the point of disappearance. It is fascinating that adult publishers present these cute animals in magazines directed to the youngest children and it is the youngest children who employ the fig ures in their own drawings. (Twice as many are found in the drawings of kindergartners as sixth graders.) Adults give children what they assume children want and children re ciprocate by reading the magazines and drawing their own versions of the cute little animals whose occupation is to play it safe, follow the rules, and passively engage in the most ordinary of everyday activities. The cute animals who present the orderly and mannered side of Japanese behavior, however, have their counterparts in cy borgs and superheroes. Cyborgs. As in the West, manga has its share of characters who possess extraor dinary mental and physical powers. Super heroes of the sorts that Japanese children produce may have their roots in samurai traditions, they may come from muscular robots with mechanical prowess (patterned after characters such as Mazinger who is controlled by a young man from a cockpit inside its head), or they may be taken di rectly from types who are tiny but quick-wit ted. Indeed, no manga character appropri ated by young children is more clever than Doraemon, the diminutive atomic-powered cat who "suddenly materialized from the top drawer of [his] young [friend] Nobita's desk one day... The desk-drawer was a gateway to the Fourth Dimension, and so was Doraemon's kangaroo-like pouch, which could produce almost anything Nobita wanted" (Schodt, 1983,14). Doraemon ful fills wishes by taking his friend on adven ture filled journeys, cleverly solving prob lems, and serving as Nobita's protector. If a threat or a need arises Doraemon can ob tain from his pouch the gadget or the means that will overcome any difficulty or obtain any desired thing. Doraemon is much like the children who eagerly draw him in their own stories. He is tiny, cute, and clever, and he has control over his world in ways that the young child can only wish. The places he goes may rep resent the unknown?journeys into the fu ture. When Doraemon gets into difficulty, he possesses the "inner resources" needed to solve the problem?in his pouch. When children draw the cyborg Doraemon stories, they symbolically rehearse ways to over come difficulties. From the standpoint of the nation, sym bolically overcoming difficulties and solving endless problems is good practice for kids in a small country whose survival depends upon the development of the one natural resource it has in abundance?the minds of its young people. Japan's future rests with its children who must eventually make their contributions to its continuing prosperity by creating the next in a never-ending series of technological miracles.

Figure 3. (A) Mixed Types (Influenced by Mangaj and (B) / -manga Types Becoming Japanese 57</page><page sequence="11">other cyborgs represent power, intellect, ingenuity?not bad qualities to possess? and to practice possessing. The contrast between the passive cute animals and the cyborgs, one of whom is himself a cute animal, illustrate the com plexities?even the contradictions?in the character models presented to and used by Japanese children. At the same time that children must follow rules and lead ordinary lives they must also practice ingenuity and imagination. In manga they find models for both types of behavior. Comic Characters. The comic category consists of a clutter of characters?many of whom are ugly, undesirable, and funny. For example, there are short ugly males with buck teeth, squinty eyes, glasses, and runny noses, and characters with undesirable physical features such as obesity. Whereas the doll-like characters are signs of the selves-we-see and the "others" we wish to be, most of the "assorted others" are the selves-we-wish-not-to-be and the selves we-are-afraid-others-might-see. In the main they are characters that invite derision and disgust. And what purposes might they serve? The child who draws one of these characters can feel superior to the poor and pitied creatures. Indeed, they provide the opportunity to discriminate, to belittle, to revile, to look down upon "the other" who is so different from the ideal self. Is it also pos sible, however, that within this derision, there is the subtle hint of insecurity?the quiet raising of the personal question "is this me?" and the social question "is this us?" Do these characters represent the "us we are afraid others might think we are?" or even "the people we sometimes, deep down, think we actually are?" Are these "as sorted others" signs of individual or national insecurity? At the very least, when children draw comic characters they have the op portunity to feel superior to others. Other Manga Types Including Mon sters. This final classification is like a broom closet into which I placed all the rest to the manga-type characters. There are the ideal male characters with razor-cut hair and large eyes?but not as large as those of the female doll characters. There are cute little humanoid characters that have the blank cipher quality of the rabbit characters de scribed above, but without the ears. There are characters formed from vegetables, fruit, and flowers. There are the monsters, many looking like a cross between minia ture dinosaurs and dragons. And there are turd characters and piles of shit that take on odorous lives of their own. Because the classification is so broad, it is not possible to make a single generalization regarding the roles that these characters might play. Nevertheless, in some respects, the classi fication reinforces the notion that the char acters are related to the variety of roles that individuals might play in Japanese society. The characters provide the means to act as-if one had certain attributes, potentials, or handicaps. They provide ways to experi ence symbolically what it is like to be hand some, dim witted, desirable, offensive, dif ferent, or nearly anonymous through one's featurelessness. This classification contains almost the same range of features and char acters found in the individual types dis cussed above. The Non-Manga Types. To me, the non manga types appear bland, especially when compared to the distinctive characters chil dren model after manga. Most of the non manga possess ordinary looks, ordinary powers, and in the main, they do ordinary things. They simply don't appear to have as much fun as their manga counterparts. The realistically drawn sports heroes are the exception, they do show lots of action; they do not, however, display much emotion. They may show a range of human actions, but these characters lack the personality and the capacity for human feeling and emotion displayed by the manga charac ters. I wonder if the manga characters and fabulous variety of potentials, when acti vated through appropriation, don't make ordinary ways of being seem somewhat dull. Some Tentative Conclusions In the manga-like characters found in Japa nese children's graphic narratives we see 58 Brent Wilson</page><page sequence="12">what happens when the youngest members of a society make use of a pervasive elabo rate system of shared images that carry meaning, beliefs, values, and understand ing. Curiously, it is possible to attribute to the children's process of appropriation pre cisely what Bruner attributes to education? the complex process of fitting a culture to the needs of its individual members while permitting children simultaneously to ex plore ways of knowing appropriate to the needs of the culture (Bruner, 1996). The one large sign, manga (and for the purposes of this study, manga characters) signifies how the Japanese people see themselves, how they want to see them selves, and how they are both attracted to and repelled by "the other." Through manga Japanese children are presented with char acters that are ready to fulfill the potentials of their types. Individually they show desir able and undesirable traits of character? the traits that must be cultivated or dis counted. Nevertheless, the manga charac ters must be understood collectively, not just individually. Collectively the manga charac ter types provide the opportunity for acting out social roles?the opportunity to explore what it is like to be beautiful, ugly, cute, plain, ordinary, extraordinary, brilliant, stupid, clever, powerful, stigmatized, revered. The facets of the "Japanese character" revealed by adult-created manga and child-appropri ated manga are filled with contradictions? some blatant and some subtle. Manga characters appropriated by chil dren reveal the complexity of learning what it means to be Japanese, and Japanese children's drawings reveal how quickly and how thoroughly children model the com plexities of being a Japanese person in Japanese society. The children's drawings also reveal the complexity of the task of maintaining collective images of "ourselves" while at the same time coping with change and rehearsing roles of individual and col lective innovation in both the national and international realms. I think manga draw ings offer advantages to Japanese children which many children in other countries do not have. They provide a marvelous means through which to experiment. At the same time the character models, through which Japanese children plot their individual and collective futures, are frequently shallow, stereotypical, and multidimensional in prob lematic ways. At the same time that manga characters provide possibilities for innova tive behavior, they may also perpetuate ste reotypical thinking and ways of behaving. Nevertheless, I must express the awe I feel in the presence of children's manga appropriating process. Because of manga models, Japanese children draw differently from children in other cultures?and far more skillfully than most. (They also draw differently because of the highly structured school program, but their manga drawings bear little resemblance to the contour-like drawings they make during art classes. Japanese children, in effect, speak two graphic languages, one belonging to the school and one belonging to the popular arts [Wilson, 1997].) Because of manga Japanese children take fuller advantage of the graphic/symbolic system?use it more effectively as a tool for human understand ing?than any group of young people I have observed anywhere on the globe. Rather than being inhibited by the character mod els served up by manga, Japanese chil dren improvise upon the possibilities pro vided by the character models. Through the appropriation and creation of their own manga characters they grasp dimensions of human cognition and emotion, pay col lective, albeit largely unconscious, atten tion to the ways Japanese people might be and behave, and grasp (also uncon sciously) the significance of what it means to act as an individual within a conforming society. For these reasons, and more, I think drawing after manga characters lib erates more than it constrains Japanese children. My reading of and writing about the manga industry pretext, children's manga character texts, and some possible post textual consequences relating to Japanese children and the Japanese people now be comes a text that awaits reading by others. Readings that contradict mine are welcome.
