<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BIBLICAL INSTRUCTORS NABI VOLUME II 1934 PART I THE LEGACY OF ISRAEL AND OUR HERITAGE IN A TIME OF CRISIS* DEAN JAMES MUILENBURG, University of Maine THE task of the NABI is defined by the crucial character of the times in which we are living. In every realm of human enterprise and aspiration crises of such grav- ity and magnitude prevail that we are com- pelled to meet in a spirit of utter solemnity and with a sense of the compelling urgency of our calling. We are more than a congenial social group of like-minded persons. By the very nature of our organization we are the heirs of a great legacy, and we are doomed to accept its burdens as well as its beneficences in a period of unprecedented crisis. Only yesterday we were all absorbed in the phe- nomena of change. We surveyed the horizon of our human existence and found it alluring and intriguing. We made a tour of inspection to examine our modern defenses. The official report was almost unanimous that all was quiet on the western front. We spoke of ad- justment, integration, coordination, and the principle of concretion. The universe, we said, was a vast system of interpenetrating syntheses, and we need but relate ourselves harmoniously to the synthesizing activity of the universe. We became humanists of every variety and employed the categories of human- ism to interpret the message of the Bible to our students. As change began to climb the breastworks of our daily life and to challenge our most cherished and best fortified human interests, we continued to repeat the old formulae of optimism and undimmed faith in human achievement. We must have the cour- age to launch forth upon experiment, to rest content with tentativeness, to be inspired by the lure of the quest. We whistled loud to keep up our courage. And all the while the very foundations of society were crumbling beneath us. It is natural for us to describe the crisis of the present by the familiar categories into which we have departmentalized our human existence: economic, social, political, interna- tional, moral, religious. Actually, however, these categories are interdependent. They form a closely knit complex which has its source in a common social and economic back- ground and a common mentality. We describe our environing chaos in terms of the concrete economic conditions that exist in the world. Billions of dollars of wealth are wiped out every year. Large populations of idle men de- moralize our society. Apathetically or desper- ately they shuffle along in interminable bread- lines. Undernourishment and starvation wreak *President's address at the Annual Meeting.</page><page sequence="2">2 Journal of the National terrific havoc weakening the physical vitality of our children for years to come. Discontent has darkened into despair and the conviction that somehow something must be done. Large groups are growing impatient and restive in striking contrast to the comparative docility of a few years ago. Social science has not re- solved the painful anomaly of abundant plenty and abject poverty even in areas bound to- gether by a single governmental control. We point to the more concretely social problems that confront us. Large areas of population exist that only need a leader to call them to revolution. Thousands of children wander up and down the highways of the country, be- queathing to the next generation a stupendous social burden. The kidnaper and the racket- eer are a dark blot upon our civilization, and we have often been utterly helpless in dealing with them. Crime has flourished. Justice has been cowed. The citadels of privilege have defied the government. Recent disclosures are beginning to make clear the extent as well as the enormity of these iniquities. The ab- sence of moral vision and the confused reac- tion of the public mind to matters of ele- mental justice and social decency were conspicuously revealed in the recent lynchings and the support that a state governor received from ostensibly respectable citizens. Condi- tions in the schools are nothing short of appall- ing in a country where the political structure is built upon the assumption of an educated and intelligent citizenry. The crisis in interna- tional affairs is epitomized in the withdrawal of Japan and Germany from the League, the almost universal resurgence of intense na- tionalism, and the striking antithesis between our pious professions and our actual foreign policies. The traditional grounds for morality have been undercut. There is as much confu- sion as to the nature of the good life as there is a tragic lack of clear motivation and ade- quate dynamic for its realization. But the crisis of our age cuts deeper yet. It strikes at the very roots of our common life. It is not just another business cycle we are experiencing. The economic structure of hu- man society is not only in collapse; the very principles upon which it was built have been repudiated. Throughout the world democracy has been having a hard time of it and is under widespread attack. Can we refer our difficult and insistent problems to the decision of a majority? Can we even allow the electorate to select the representatives? Above all when the foundations are crumbling and shaking can we afford to rely on the decisions of voters? We are repeatedly warned that we are standing at the crossroad between fascism and communism and that it is impossible to take a middle course. The doctrine of the good neighbor will have to wait, we are told, until we can put our own house in order. Religion has taken on the protective coloration of its environing culture and civilization so com- pletely that it can no longer speak with a clear voice. It cannot command because it has lost its imperative. The consequence of the upheaval in all the salient realms of modern life has been to re- sort to control of various sorts. But setting up stop-gaps will not do. They will not with- stand the weight of a tottering civilization. It would be easy to quote chapter and verse in the literature of our times to prove that this is no exaggerated estimate of the state of affairs. We are clearly living at the end of an age. Our interpretations as to the precise historic relationships of the present to the past may differ. One large class of writers clearly sees everything in the light of the decline and fall of capitalism. The death of capitalism and the substitution of another economic system in its place, will leave no single side of life unaltered. Religion, literature, art, science, the whole of the human heritage of knowl- edge will be transformed. For no aspect of human life can remain unaffected by a change in the way in which human life itself is maintained . . . . The end of that phase of the history of the peoples of the West which began five hundred years ago carries such enormous implications with it that nearly everyone</page><page sequence="3">Association of Biblical Instructors 3 stands too dumbfounded to admit what is happening. Another class pronounces the present the end of the Renaissance and contends with great force that the outcome was already clearly im- plicit in its initial pre-suppositions. Contemporary history is being wound up, an unkown era is upon us, and it must be given a name .... The rhythm of history is changing: it is becoming catas- trophic. Nowhere and in no single matter is solid earth felt under foot; we are on volcanic ground and any eruption is possible, material or spiritual. Modern history is now coming to an end .... Mhan's intellec- tual vagrancy, wherein he knew nothing of an authority higher than his own, has not strengthened his belief in himself; on the contrary, it has irre- mediably weakened it and compromised even that knowledge that he had of his own identity. We may content ourselves with declaring that we are experiencing the decay of Western civilization and its fundamental modes of thinking. Or we may see the source of all our ills in a world war whose colossal and tragic results have carried the human race into the abyss. But I do not think we have the intellectual or moral right to face our times with the pleasant little optimistic sophistries that have been so common during the past fifty years. Whatever we may choose to say, it is man clearly who is under judgment, his very humanity that is under question and con- demnation. And this is naught but the logical and inevitable consequence of our western way of thinking that found its origin in the indi- vidualism and liberty of the Renaissance. This is not the occasion or the time to describe our debt to that amazing movement of the human spirit; it is the moment to admit that it has brought us to our doom. It is crisis, then, that describes the character of our society, our world, and our very lives. We are in the crisis. And who are these men and women whom we face in our classrooms? They are sons and daughters of this crisis. What else have they known from earliest child- hood but utter chaos and confusion? They have lived in a world distraught with fear and insecurity. They found their textbooks be- coming antiquated each morning as they read their metropolitan daily newspaper. They heard our most venerable and respected finan- cial experts confess that they simply did not see the way out. They heard the social prophets decry the capitalistic system of so- ciety, and they listened to the clergy declare its collapse. They saw governments on the brink of revolution or disruption undertake radical political ventures and experiments. They saw the capitulation of reason and intel- ligence to the powers of force. They saw all about them despair and desperation and tragedy. But they lived only a surface ex- istence, the dimensions of which were indi- vidual freedom and blatant materialism. Little wonder that many of our more thoughtful and earnest men and women are fleeing to the havens of Communism or Catholicism! It is to such men and women then that we are addressing ourselves, and it will be to our advantage if we shall have something to say to them that is relevant to the lives they are living in the only kind of a world they know. So great are the stakes involved in a field such as ours that to fail is to lose all, but to suc- ceed is to give the student that without which he cannot live. Now the conviction has been growing on me in recent days that the religion and life of ancient Israel provides us materials that are of paramount value for our present age because it is a product of crucial events and crucial forces not greatly dissimilar to our own. But what is more, despite the disin- tegrating influences of nations about her, des- pite conflicts within her borders, despite the play of powerful economic interests, despite divergent social and cultural ideals due to geo- graphical and other considerations, despite her dispersion among civilizations alien to her own, and despite the fusion of her customs and practices with those of the surrounding nations, Israel nevertheless was possessed of a security which was able to withstand all these, a faith which could assert itself fiercely when it was sorely tested, even when all available facts seemed to belie its validity.</page><page sequence="4">4 Journal of the National Strangely, and some would add, providen- tially, a variety of factors and forces have con- verged in recent years to bring before the world the claims of ancient Israel. There has been, for example, a pronounced reaction against the Hellenistic emphasis of the Bousset- Heitmiiller school in favor of the Hebrew an- tecedents of many N. T. conceptions, both in the teachings of Jesus and in the letters of Paul and the Fourth Gospel. Histories of re- ligion have pointed out with greater clarity the scope and significance of the whole stream of religious tradition that emanated from Pales- tine. The literary greatness of the Hebrew records is destined to receive more just ap- praisal by students of comparative and world literature. Movements for greater toleration and understanding between divergent groups within historic religious bodies have quickened an appreciation and understanding of Hebrew Religion. The National Council for the Co- operation of Jews and Christians is a notable example. Barriers are constantly broken down by Jewish-Christian contacts in our colleges and theological schools and in the meetings of the learned societies. The same catalytic forces have played upon Judaism and Protes- tantism, thus bringing liberal groups together. But the claims of ancient Israel have come be- fore us dramatically as a result of the persecu- tions of the Hitler regime and its attempts to substitute for the Old Testament the ancient Nordic legends and traditions. For the last year men have been called again to review the legacy of Israel. For the most part the literature that has come from the press as a result has reckoned only with the Jews in con- temporary society or with their contribution to modern civilization as it is usually conceived, that is, it has been confined chiefly to the activ- ity of western and modern Jewry and has almost completely neglected the greatness and the glory that was ancient Israel as it is re- vealed in the Old Testament. The Old Testament came into existence as by the purposive activity of Yahweh God. In a succession of crises, and the records of divine revelations to individuals are all crucial. Our earliest historic glimpse of the Hebrews finds them in Egypt as slaves; they are represented as being borne down by merciless oppression and persecution. There is the note of des- peration and helplessness throughout the nar- rative. The period of the conquest, especially the long conflict with the Philistines, certainly was crucial in character. Deborah's ode speaks eloquently about the conditions among the tribes as do many passages in I Samuel where the Hebrews are pictured as reduced to the most dire straits. Scarcely had the Philistine men- ace been overcome when we observe the gradual rise of Aram, the alliance with Phoe- nicia, the aggressive policy of Jezebel, and the precipitation of a national and religious crisis which seems to have involved the very existence of the Yahweh cult. The decline of Aram is measured by the approach of Assyria. For two centuries we are never once permitted to lose sight of the designs of this great power. The development of Hebrew religion is traced against a background of Assyrian campaigns and the international crises which they pro- voked. However we conceive the character of the exilic and post-exilic period in Israel's history, we are conscious whenever we have a literary deposit that it has been the result of some significant crisis. It is unnecessary to re- hearse the crises of the great religious experi- ences in the Old Testament: we all instantly think of Moses, Elijah, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and many others. Rather let us turn to the Old Testament to find what it is that it is always saying, the unity that dominates all its diver- sity, the solemn asseverations that confront all human crisis. The first of these asseverations is brought to us with great effectiveness in the accounts of the beginnings of the Yahweh cult from the theophany of the bush to the covenant code. The first words of Yahweh to Moses after the call from the bush are "I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of</page><page sequence="5">Association of Biblical Instructors 5 Isaac, the God of Jacob." It is frequently said that this is nothing more than an identi- fication of Midian's god with Israel's ancestral deity. But the succeeding conversation indi- cates that there is more here than this. To Moses' protest "Who am I?", the response is "I will be with thee." Then follows the dif- ficult tetragrammaton. I have no desire to interpret it by the categories of philosophy, to translate it by such words as "Eternal" or "Self-existent", but it seems to me that we do have here an expression of Yahweh's sover- eignty. All difficulties are met with the same ever-recurring answer, "I am Yahweh. I am sending you. Go." It receives its most dram- atic expression in the climax of the impressive account of Moses' arrival at Sinai, the sacri- fice and communal meal, the administration of justice, the encampment before the sacred mountain, the elaborate preparations, the de- scent of Yahweh on the morning of the third day. And it came to pass on the third day when it was morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a trumpet exceeding loud; and all the people that were in the camp tremtbled. And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. And Mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because Yahweh descended upon it in fire; and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly. And when the voice of the trumpet waxed louder and louder, Moses spake, and God answered him by a voice. Then there is the terror-stricken fear lest the tabu be violated and Yahweh speaks: "I am Yahweh thy God." The more frequently and patiently one reads the whole section in Exodus, the more will this assertion of Yahweh's utter sovereignty for Israel impress him. But when we examine other key passages of Scripture, we encounter very much this same insistence upon what must be for Israel the ultimate fact. Thus on Mount Carmel Elijah prays, "Hear me, O Yahweh, hear me, that this people may know that thou Yahweh art God." And when all the people see the descent of the sacred fire, they fall on their faces and cry, "Yahweh, he is God. Yah- weh, he is God." Again in Isaiah's vision we have a tremendous stress upon Yahweh's sovereignty. It is Yahweh who is seated on the thron e, high and lifted up. His train fills the temple. The utterly holy Yah- weh fills the earth with his glory. This incur- sion of the divine into Isaiah's life evokes his expression of social solidarity, but it is a soli- darity that is under condemnation. At least this is Isaiah's response to the divine event. But Hebrew theism receives its noblest and clear- est statement in the poems of Second Isaiah. It expresses itself in the condemnation of idol- atry, the universality of Yahweh's power, and monotheism. But the final and ultimate decla- ration is the word of Yahweh himself. I am Yahweh, your Holy One, the Creator of Israel, your King. (42:15) I am Yahweh, that is my name; and my glory will I not give to another (43:8) I am Yahweh, and there is none else; besides me there is no God. (43.5). To the divine pronouncement of absolute sovereignty the true Israelite can only reply, "Thou Yahweh art God." The divine I am achieves meaning when the individual can con- fess in devotion and wonder and rapture, Thou art. The second great asseveration of ancient Israel is that Yahweh acts. The movements of the universe are His movements. He is known by His wonderful works to the children of men. He expresses Himself through events, through His mighty deeds. There is no suggestion of a time-process of recurring cycles. The world gains its significance because He made it. In the earlier creation story Yahweh fashions man, earth from the ground. He blows into his nostrils the breath of life. Man's origin and value consists in his divine creation. Man becomes a living soul through the divine act. We may object to the crude anthropomorphism of this account, but we cannot but be struck by the purposive activity of Yahweh God. In</page><page sequence="6">6 Journal of the National Genesis I the priestly author calls us to recog- nize in every line that all things have their origin in the creative act of God. Thirty-five times he repeats the name God on one small page, and he doubtless meant it to be empha- sized. The very word of God brings His works into being. God commands and they come into existence. By the word of Yahweh were the heavens made, And all the host of them 'by the breath of his mouth. The old Hebrew rabbis were only developing the writer's meaning when they sought to hypostatize the creative power of God into the creator Memra. Nowhere in the whole O. T. is this creative activity of Yahweh expressed with such passion and power as in Second Isaiah. Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard? The everlasting God, Yahweh, the Creator of the ends of the earth, Fainteth not, neither is weary; There is no searching of his understanding, 40:28 For thus saith Yahweh that created the heavens, The God that formed the earth and made it, That established it and created it not a waste, That formed it to be inhabited. 45:18 History is naught but a succession of unique, divine events. Israel's history has its inception as its consummation in the divine will and pur- pose. In the remarkable narrative of the ori- gin of the Yahweh cult to which I referred above the whole story centers in Yahweh's act of deliverance. The remarkable climax in the voice from Sinai begins "I am Yahweh thy God," but Yahweh's character is defined by the immediately succeeding words "who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage." That is who Yahweh is to the pious Israelite, and he never forgot it. Noth- ing described Him more adequately. Is it not possible that the presence of miracle in the Old Testament is sometimes explained by just this characteristically Oriental accentuation of a conviction that all that is relevant initiates in di- vine activity? Yahweh is determining the course of history. He brought the Philistines from Caphtor, the Syrians from Kir, the He- brews from Egypt. Yahweh smote the host of the Assyrians when Jerusalem became im- periled. Yahweh governs the movements of all the nations of Western Asia. Again, it is to the Great Unknown Prophet of the exile to whom we must go for our most lofty and in- spiring expression of God's purposive activity. The whole of Isaiah 45 is a magnificent com- bination of the cosmic and historic activity of Yahweh. The phenomena of Nature are the works of God. Already in the Song of Deborah Yah- weh sends the thunderstorm, and the stars from their courses fight against Sisera. In another episode of the conquest Yahweh hurls hail stones from heaven, and the sun and the moon stand still in response to Joshua's prayer. One could multiply similar instances with- out difficulty. But the famous passage from the book of Amos is particularly relevant for our own purposes. I may be pardoned for em- ploying the colloquial rendering of Professor Robinson: In all your cities I kept your teeth clean by giving you no food, and everywhere there was a shortage of bread. Yet you did not learn that you must come back to me. This is Yahweh's oracle. Three months before the harvest, when rain was most needed, I kept it back from you-it was I that did it. Sometimes I sent rain on one city and not on another. Sometimes rain fell in one district alone, and that in which it did not fall would dry up. So the people of two or three cities had to go to one to get water to drink, and there was not enough for them. Yet you did not learn that you must come back to me. This is Yahweh's oracle. I afflicted you with blight and mildew; I scorched up your gardens and vineyards, and more than once locusts devoured your figs and olives. Yet you did not learn that you must come back to me. This is Yahweh's oracle. I sent an epidemic on you, I killed your young men in wars; I made your camp reek with the stench of rotten corpses. Yet you did not learn that you must come back to me. This is Yahweh's oracle. I brought on you an earthquake as frightful as that which destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were</page><page sequence="7">Association of Biblical Instructors 7 like a charred stick, just snatched from the fire in time to be not quite burnt up. This is Yahweh's oracle. Our tendency to personify Nature has led us to misunderstand and misinterpret much of the nature poetry of the 0. T. In a very strict sense there is no nature poetry in the Bible. The beauty and glory of Nature is set forth only because it is God's creation. The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament showeth his handiwork. Ps. 19:1 In the greatest of O. T. nature poems it is clearly God's action that inspires all natural phenomena. When teachers expatiate on the marvelous description here and in similar pas- sages in Job they are obviously omitting that which is cardinal in the poet's mind: Bless Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God, thou art very great; Thou art clothed with honor and majesty: Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; Who stretched out the heavens like a curtain; Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; Who maketh the clouds his chariot; Who walketh upon the wings of the wind; Who maketh winds his messengers; Flames of fire his ministers; Who laid the foundations of the earth, That it should not be moved for ever. I can think of no passage where we get an objective picture of a scene in Nature divorced from a direct and clear statement that God has made it so. We may be moved "by this calm, this quiet scene" of the Shepherd's psalm, but throughout the emphasis is always on the provi- dential act of God. The Hebrew conception of Spirit shows the same stress upon divine action. It is far from the Greek conception of a cosmic pervading principle giving order and form to all things. Rather it is the means of communication be- tween God and man. It makes men capable of extraordinary action. It comes upon Sam- son when he rends the lion, upon Joseph when he interprets dreams, upon David when he does his valiant deeds. It has a physical character. It rushes upon men and seizes them. Yet it is always Yahweh's Spirit. The conception of the Spirit naturally underwent transforma- tion, but it never lost this radical primitive meaning completely. We observe this, for ex- ample, in the remarkable account of the descent of the Spirit at Pentecost as it is described in Acts 2. In the coming days God will pour forth of his Spirit upon all flesh endowing them with gifts of prophecy and visions and dreams. The activity of the Spirit is vividly expressed in prophetic inspiration. At an early stage in Hebrew religion we have the illuminating account of how the Spirit came mightily upon Saul and changed him into another man. At a much later time we find it performing re- markable acts in the life of Ezekiel, and still later we read the lofty passage in Second Isaiah describing the activity of the Spirit in the prophet's life: The Spirit of the Lord Yahweh is upon me; because Yahweh hath annointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the year of Yahweh's favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn; to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness. But it is not always through the activity of the Spirit that Yahweh communicates Himself to the prophet. Nevertheless, behind all proph- ecy lies the event without which prophecy is impossible. This is the uniform and universal witness of the prophet, and we should do well to trust an expert in his own field. The prophet is caught in the crisis. "Yahweh said to me", "Yahweh showed me", "Yahweh took me", - these are the ways in which he ex- presses what has happened to him. Nor is this an event that happens once for all. The whole of the prophet's life is determined for him by the recurring crises in which Yahweh acts: O Yahweh, thou hast persuaded me, and I was per- suaded; thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am become a laughing stock all the day, every one mocketh me. For as often as I speak, I cry out; I cry, Violence and destruction; because the word of</page><page sequence="8">8 Journal of the National Yahweh is made a reproach unto me, and a derision, all the day. And if I say, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name, then there is in my heart as it were a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I am weary with forbearing, and I cannot contain. Jer. 20:7-9. We may seek to analyze the forces which psychologically made the prophetic call and rev- elation inevitable, but to the prophet it was clearly an event from without, from God, that came to him with compelling force. The action of God is present; it is also fu- ture. The purposiveness revealed from the beginning must have an end, and it was inevi- table that as time went on eschatology should play a larger role. The whole conception of the Day of Yahweh is an expression of Israel's faith that God will act. It is just this tremen- dous sense of imminent divine event that gives the prophets their tremendous power and pas- sion. This day is near. It hasteth greatly. I am not pleading for the framework of apocalyptic nor for the categories that are distasteful to so many. I do feel, however, that religion loses much when it loses the heroic faith of those who live in times of terrific strain and stress. Moreover for the prophet and perhaps for every deeply religious individual the kingdom of God is always at hand. It is a measure of the intensity and urgency of the imperative. Yahweh is God, He performs wonders-- his actions are his revelation. In the third place, God commands and the good Hebrew owes absolute and unquestioning obedience. It is an unalterable "Thou shalt" which meets him. His whole life is determined by these commands from God. They break into his existence. To him they do not come as alter- natives over which he has long reflected. Shall the trumpet be blown in the city, And the people not be afraid? Shall evil befall a city? And Yahweh hath not done it? The lion hath roared; Who will not fear? The 'Lord Yahweh hath spoken; Who can but prophesy. Amos 3:6-8. To revert once more to our Exodus narrative, we find here the repeated and insistent "Thou shalt." It is this absolute imperative "Go" from which Moses cannot escape. The deca- log follows with its commands immediately upon its declaration of our two major assevera- tions: "I am Yahweh thy God who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other gods before me." The prophets are all moved by this same overwhelming conviction that their lives have been placed under constraint by God. Jeremiah shows us clearly what this constraint meant to him and how far he is from the mod- ern attitude. The content of Yahweh's purposive will for man is righteousness. In Israel there was always this striking recognition of what has become so conspicuous a dichotomy in modern thought, i. e. it centered power and value in God. It is God's people they are. It is God's world. The power of God is revealed in crea- tion, in revelation, in history, in prophecy, in nature, in all the vicissitudes of human life. We see the roots of these ideas in the earliest phases of Hebrew religion where their kinship to animism is unmistakable. This concern for power exhibits itself in the adjustment to Palestinian conditions, the building of the king- dom, the efforts to establish themselves among the nations of Western Asia. But what is notable is the emergence of value, especially social values. How early we may trace this emergence it is difficult to say. It is certainly present in Elijah in the affair of Naboth's vineyard. It sounds like a trumpet blast in the words of Amos. His radical insistence upon justice awakens a quick response in our con- temporary minds. We match the social and economic ills of eighth century Israel with those of twentieth century America. Our stu- dents are shocked at the daring of these proph- ets. But there are two features in Amos and the other prophets which are quite central to their thinking which we are wont to under- emphasize: the ardor and intensity of their be-</page><page sequence="9">Association of Biblical Instructors 9 lief in God and their profound consciousness of the meaning of history. We speak of an im- minent inexorable law which works its own way where it will, but I do not believe the thought of Amos will bear this interpretation. We call these men "statesmen" and "moral enthusiasts." This is doubtless a healthy reac- tion against the age which conceived them in Coleridge's phrase as "supernatural ventrilo- quists", but I believe the prophets of Israel would prefer to be called that other phrase of a former day, "men of God", than to be called "statesmen" when once they realized all that was implied by it in our minds. One would never weary of interpreting the great social messages of the Hebrew prophets in modern terms and applying these principles to our own distraught society. We must do that to-day more than ever. But I believe we all know that, and that every member of the NABI here this morning is doing what he can to make the prophets speak directly to our- selves and our society. "He hath showed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth Yahweh require of thee, but to do justice, to love kind- ness, and to walk humbly with thy God." This may be the epitome of eighth-century prophecy but we shall do well to lay greater stress on the consideration that the noble passage comes to us from Yahweh's controversy with his people, and that the lofty expression of "what is good" is Yahweh's requirement. We may say that we must select from the whole passage that which is universal and timeless, but are we not al- lowing our own value judgments to control the material and to distort what is actually said? Moreover, are not the interests of scholarship best served when we make as vivid as possible how Micah (or whoever the prophet was who was responsible for the passage) felt about it? Should it not also be added that this combina- tion of Yahweh, the Determiner of Israel's Destiny, and the demands of the good life into an inextricable unity is characteristically He- brew? Again, this Yahweh, with His control and power over Israel is described by appeal to His activity in Israel's history "For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him; (remember) from Shittim unto Gilgal, that ye may know the righteous acts of Yahweh." I know of no single sub- ject that has engrossed me more in recent years in studying the Old Testament than just this dual relationship of power and value in the history of religious thought, and especially the history of Hebrew religious thought. It is a study of strains and stresses and tensions, but also of courage and faith and passionate moral will. Profound human interests are at stake, and in Israel social and economic factors, historical events, and changing international backgrounds make the study of unparalleled fascination. For the Hebrews the modern dichotomy of metaphysics and morality was unconsciously resolved by the intensity and na- ture of their belief in Yahweh and his char- acter. I have been referring throughout to the in- tensity with which Israel expresses its religious aspiration and faith. The utter devotion and passion with which she champions these con- victions is as important for our understanding as the knowledge of social forces which seem to color them and give them form. It is no accident that a large part of the Old Testament comes to us in poetry. But even in the prose passages, as in the narratives of Genesis, and Exodus, the account of the beginnings of the kingdom, the remarkable chapters dealing with the reign of David-in fact, everywhere, we are never allowed to forget that this is a liter- ature by men who had committed their destinies utterly to God. Yet it is in the book of psalms that we find the clearest and noblest expression of Israel's religious feeling, and it embraces the whole gamut of human religious aspiration and longing. Open the book at random and</page><page sequence="10">10 Journal of the National you will find utterance of this ecstatic quality: My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: When shall I come and appear before God? 42:2 I love thee, O Yahweh, my strength. Yahweh is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer ; My God, my rock, in whom I will take refuge. 18:1-2 Yahweh is my light and my salvation; Whom shall I fear? Yahweh is the strength of my life; Of whom shall I be afraid? 27:1 Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? Or whither shall I flee from thy presence? If I ascend up in heaven, thou art there: If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, thou art there. 139:7-8 Praise ye Yahweh. Praise God in his sanctuary: Praise him in the firmament of his power. Praise him for his mighty acts: Praise him according to his excellent greatness. Praise him with trumpet sound: Praise him with psaltery and harp. Praise him with timbrel and dance: Praise him with stringed instruments and pipe. Praise him with loud cymbals: Praise him with high-sounding cymbals. Let everything that hath breath praise Yahweh. Praise ye Yahweh. 150 Israel rejoices in Yahweh's activity, in the events by which her very life is conditioned and determined: Bless Yahweh, O my soul; And all that is within me, bless his holy name. Bless Yahweh, ,0 my soul, And forget not all his benefits: Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; And healeth all thy diseases; Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; And crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies; Who satisfieth thy desire with good things, So that thy youth is renewed like the eagle. Yahweh executeth righteous acts And judgments for all that are oppressed. 103:1-6 The law is Yahweh's gift to Israel. It places her before her supreme obligation. It defines the relationship of Israel to her God: Oh how love I thy law! It is my meditation all the day. I have more understanding than my teachers; For thy testimonies are my meditation. 119:97-99 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, And light unto my path. 119:105 And his delight is in the law of Yahweh; And on his law doth he meditate day and night. 1:2 Disobedience incurs judgment; it places the sinner before Yahweh and his mercy: Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving kindness: According to the multitude of thy tender mercies, blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, And cleanse me from my sin. For I know my transgressions; And my sin is ever before me. Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, And done that which is evil in thy sight; That thou mayest be justified when thou speakest, And be clear when thou judgest. 51:1-4. This same religious zeal and unction is typical of Hebrew prophecy. We can almost measure its rise and decline by the vigor and power of its utterance. Amaziah the priest of Bethel confesses to his monarch that the land is not able to bear all the words of Amos. Isaiah and Jeremiah must be silenced, not only for what they said, we may be sure, but also for the effectiveness with which they said it. This then is the legacy of Israel which we in- herit. It is the complete and absolute belief in God. She was a people devoted to the single idea of God. "Knowledge of God was their conception of wisdom; service of God their conception of virtue; their poetry was the ex- pression of the yearning of the soul for God; history was a religious drama in which God was the protagonist, judging the nations with righteousness; the conception of God was their philosophy-they did not require any other. Their faith in God and their religion were strong enough to satisfy their desire for knowl- edge." This last sentence is Norman Bent- wich's characterization of Judaism, but it is essentially true of the whole Old Testament: it is certainly true of that religious faith which was responsible for the form of the 0. T. that has been transmitted to us. Thus the sharp contrast of the sculptor's plan Showed the two primal paths our race has trod.</page><page sequence="11">Association of Biblical Instructors 11 Hellas, the nurse of man complete as man, Judea, pregnant with the living God. The divine and purposive will of Yahweh is expressed in events. It describes for us the sense of reality that God had for Israel and explains the crucial character which the Old Testament everywhere reveals. God's revela- tion to and for Israel is seen in creation, in his- tory, in prophecy, in eschatology, in the con- ception of Spirit, and in the attitude toward Nature. The interests in power and value es- sential for her well-being and life, are resolved in her relationship to Yahweh and finds its classical expression in the Shema: "Hear, O Israel: Yahweh our God is one Yahweh: and thou shalt love Yahweh thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might." "The uppermost idea with Hellenism is to see things as they really are, the upper- most idea with Hebraism is conduct and obed- ience" was Matthew Arnold's estimate and summary of the two racial geniuses. Conduct, Arnold was always saying, is three-fourths of human life. But he would have been the first to assert that it was not four-fourths. For Israel, this conduct is obedience to God, and Arnold does not lose sight of that. It is we of a later time who have modified and tempered that which is distinctive in Hebrew religion into that which is by no means distinctive or unique. It has hardly been my purpose or design to state the main principles of a theology, nor have I sought to revive what used to be called Biblical theology. Certainly, it has not been my desire to raise issues that might prove con- troversial. There has been no intent to frame a dogmatism or to look at the 0. T. in the light of any contemporary cult or movement. Rather, I have been impelled by the plight in which humanity finds itself as it faces a de- cisive turning point in its history to inquire what we should be doing as teachers of the sacred literature of ancient Israel, what bear- ing our profession has upon the exigencies of a chaotic society, what we shall have to say, or what is infinitely more important, what the Bible shall have to say to the boys and girls who are to turn their faces to the new age. The discussion was inevitable because of the very nature of the 0. T.: the constant and per- vasive emphasis upon the crucial character of its life, which indeed evokes the literature it- self, and the situation it faced of adjusting itself to civilizations and cultures, which, while sharing much in common, were yet hostile to its own religious genius. It is possible that some of us may see striking analogies here between our own situation and Israel's. If it is true that our religious thinking has been radically colored by humanism and that human- ism is completely bankrupt, we may logically ask, "What alternative have we then?" I ad- mit that it may be a big "if", for I am sure that there are many who still cling to the op- timistic affirmations of humanism with hope. That interest in humanism has waned consider- ably in recent years I believe is indisputable. But it is far from admitting its own demise. On one matter we might at least come to some agreement and that is that it is a false exegesis and scholarship which employs humanistic techniques in interpreting the Bible. The hu- manists themselves will not aid us in that venture. They know better. But again I ask, what alternative have we then? If theism, shall we not do well to humble ourselves be- fore Israel's great declaration of radical theism? But is it not just this utter humbling of ourselves that our modern minds are con- spicuously unwilling to do? Will not such a self-abasement before Israel's God and Israel's revelation (for the moment I can think of no better word. Achievement is modern but He- braism does not know that word) be just the reversion to a darker mediaevalism that many of our social diagnosticians are predicting? Or will Israel's theism be the fort of security and authority that can alone repel the disintegrating forces that are attacking us on all sides ? Must we not inevitably face the question whether Israel's religion is in any sense a revelation of</page><page sequence="12">12 Journal of the National the truth regarding human life and destiny? And if not that, must we not ask whether it does contain asseverations of truth which abide throughout the ages? Or does it contain glimpses of truth, fragmentary gleams that may lead us on in times of peril, clues which we may use toward the construction of a religious philosophy of life? As I write these words a sense of depression sweeps over me. For I can see ahead only more tentativeness, more relativism, more conciliation, more of the mod- ern virtues that have rendered our faith effete and unchallenging. How long, O Lord, how long? Must we enter still deeper into our dark night of despair before we shall raise the truly radical questions of human life, its origin and destiny, its whence have I come and whither shall I go, its who am I and who art thou? Only then perhaps will Israel's supreme command come to us like an imperative break- ing into human life as God's event: Hear, 0 Israel, Yahweh our God is one Yahweh; and thou shalt love Yahweh thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. But we shall not fathom its meaning or its truth until we heed that other command at the beginning of the gospel:: The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: repent ye and believe in the gospel. Is not this the meaning for us in our own situation of the legacy of Israel and does it not define for us our heritage and our most immediate task?</page></plain_text>
