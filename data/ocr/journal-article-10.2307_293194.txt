A mixed bag of notes on minor points: Pp. 4-5: when Apollo uses saophron of himself (Iliad, XXI, 462), he is exemplifying Homer's most extreme anthropomorphism. Gods are not normally called upon to be s6phrones.-P. 6: aidos, nemesis, and sophrosyne: Dodds' (The Greeks and the Irrational) 'shame culture' and 'guilt culture' should have been referred to.-P. 7: " Homeric society . .. places a high value on aid6s, but the hero himself, qua hero, is not obliged to respect it." The participants in the Embassy (Iliad, IX), especially Ajax, do not seem to have been informed of this exemption.-Pp. 26-7, on self-knowledge in Heraclitus: i8tl- aadLrv ueovTro'v! (Fr. 101 D-K).-P. 36: on Aeschylus' Suppliants: especially good remarks on the Danaids' distorted view of sophro- syne.-P. 39: I welcome Miss North's statement that Eteocles (in the Seven Against Thebes) " is at first completely sophron and then suddenly (at line 653), when the Erinys strikes, completely the reverse."-Pp. 43-4: Good remarks on the tyrannical Zeus of the Prometheus Bound, but the comparison with the Oresteia is no help here. Zeus is never characterized as a tyrant at any point in the Oresteia, early or late.-Pp. 45-6 bring out well the virtual equiva- lence of phronein and sophronein for Aeschylus.-P. 48, on "the theme of fear ": a reference to J. de Romilly, La crainte et l'angoisse dans le theatre d'Eschyle, would have been in order. But enough. The book is carefully and gracefully written, and very carefully proofread. The only inconsistent spelling that sticks in the mind is aretae, with a Latinate -ae. We are much indebted to Professor North for this painstaking investigation and not only look forward to her next publication along the same line but hope that her work may stimulate others to undertake comparable studies of the major Greek virtues, and indeed of the concept of arete itself. GERALD F. ELSE. THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. ROBERT tTIENNE. La vie quotidienne a Pompei. Paris, Librairie Hachette, 1966. Pp. 486; 2 plans (inside covers). 18.50 New Francs. To Giuseppe Fiorelli belongs the credit for introducing order and system to the excavation of Pompeii. Among his innovations, upon assuming direction of the Scavi in 1860, was the division of the city into numbered regiones, insulae, and buildings, by which sectors of Pompeii are formally identified today. With the development of new techniques the work accelerated, and a classic general descrip- tion of the contents of regiones VI, VII, and VIII, based upon the discoveries of nearly forty seasons, appeared in 1899: A. Mau and F. W. Kelsey (translator), Pompeii-Its Life and Art. It is now high time for a fresh survey. For, first, despite the vicissitudes of two wars, this century has witnessed the systematic disinterment of much of the southeastern sector of the city, along the Via dell' 365</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. Abbondanza (regiones I, II, III, and IX). The castellum aquae at the Porta Vesuvio, the house of the Golden Cupids (reg. VI. 16. 7), the villa Item (villa of the Mysteries), the fullonica Stephani (I.6.7), the house of the Cryptoporticus (I. 6. 2), of Loreius Tiburtinus (II. 2.2), of the Menander (I.10.4), the Grand Palaestra (II. 7), the villa of Julia Felix (II.4.3), the necropolis outside the Porta di Nocera-to mention only the most outstanding discoveries-have all been brought to light since Mau's day. Second, two subsequent generations of scholars have directed their talents and energies towards the recreation of ancient Pompeii, through excavation and through analysis of familiar evidence from fresh points of view. Sogliano, Spinazzola, Rostovtzeff, Carrington, Lehmann, Onorato, Della Corte, Maiuri, and Van Buren have all earned permanent places in the history of Pompeian scholarship, but their specialized contributions are widely dispersed in monographs, periodicals, and Festschriften. There has been a real need for a new work of syn- thesis (Maiuri's often revised itinerary Pompei, despite its many virtues, is no substitute), for an up-to-date account of Pompeii which reviews and assesses these past sixty-seven years of excava- tion and scholarship. R. Etienne has now undertaken this task. The book consists of three sections, subdivided into chapters. In Book I, "Des Catastrophes et des Resurrections" (pp. 11-81), IEtienne ingeniously (and quite justifiably) takes as his starting point not the eruption of 79 but the earlier disaster, from whose effects the city had not fully recovered seventeen years later: the earthquake which, as G. 0. Onorato proved in 1949 in an important paper, occurred in February of 62 and not, as had been previously believed, in 63. From here Etienne passes on to consider the char- acter of the eruption of Vesuvius in August, 79, and to review the gradual stages of the city's disinterment. To Book II, " Des Activi- tes et des Homines" (pp. 83-274), belong four chapters. The first treats the Greek, Etruscan, further Greek, Samnite, and Roman phases of the city's history, and closes with a description of the famous dispute (recorded by Tacitus and commemorated too in a wall painting now in the museum in Naples) between Pompeians and Nucerians in 59 A. D. in the town's amphitheater. That dispute was so bitter as to prompt the Roman Senate to suspend games at Pompeii for a period of ten years; ]tienne, however, accepts A. W. Van Buren's attractive suggestion that Poppaea interceded with Nero on behalf of the Pompeians, and that games were in fact re- sumed by 64: Poppaea had close local ties, and she and her consort, as graffiti prove, were great favorites in the city. Chapter two, based largely upon epigraphical sources, deals vividly with details of electoral procedure and civil administration. Here the author stresses one significant difference between ancient and modern campaign techniques: in Pompeii, friends wrote the slogans and enlisted politi- cal support for their favorites; from the candidates themselves " point de profession de foi grandiloquente " (p. 136). The subjects of chapter three are agriculture, industry, and commerce. The extent to which Pompeii's economy was self-sufficient has been exaggerated in past years; thus all the more welcome is Ptienne's final section (which owes much to the work of E. Lepore), in which the Pompeian economy and social fabric are viewed in a wider context: ties with 366</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS. India, Istria, Cilicia, Egypt, Numidia, Sicily, Carthage, and Gaul are emphasized, as is the local presence of foreigners, both of Italian provenance and from abroad, who lived and prospered in the city. Chapters on the agents and instruments of daily labor, and on religion and cult (Etienne's own earlier work lends special authority to his discussion here) conclude Book II. A detailed description of the contents of Book III, " Des Plaisirs et des Jeux" (pp. 275-441) is impossible in the space available; individual chap- ters have been allotted to domestic architecture, wall decoration (Etienne offers a systematic critique, based on Maiuri, of Mau's theory of the "four styles"), streets and tombs, education and cul- ture, sport and leisure; there is a brief conclusion. Etienne's prose is lucid, even where the matter is technical or intractable (e. g., pp. 30 f., on the geophysics of Vesuvius; pp. 227 f., on monetary circulation). Forty-five plans and illustrations support the text; an excellent plan of Pompeii (approximate scale [not stated]: 1: 5,000) has been handsomely reproduced at both ends of the volume; a topographical index greatly increases the serviceability of the book on the site. Twenty-three pages of notes, although they have been relegated to the end of the volume and consist primarily of bare references, are nonetheless a most welcome addition; Etienne hereby makes good one of the greatest deficiencies of Mau-Kelsey, where documentation was unfortunately kept to a minimum. In short, in this new addition to the series La Vie Quotidienne, both neophyte and specialist are well served; and one may express the hope that it, like its distinguished Roman predecessor, be translated into English. Should that hope be realized, the following observations on points of detail may perhaps be found useful. P. 24: there are good reasons for identifying the Cascus mentioned by Pliny (Ep., VI, 16, 8) with Cn. Pedius Cascus, the suffectus of 71 A. D.: see C. P. Jones, Phoenix, XXII (1968), p. 127. P. 115: in the survey of Pompeian history, the transition from the Social War to 59 A. D. is unjustifiably abrupt; one expects here at least some discussion of P. Sulla, co-founder of the Sullan colony, and some account of Pompeii in the Ciceronian period. P. 130: how was the Basilica roofed? P. 132: it is hardly correct to describe C.I.L., X, 924 as "une dedicace a Agrippa Postumus." P. 174, end of first para- graph: this suggestion was proposed first by M. L. Gordon, J. R. S., XVII (1927), p. 172. The adaptations of line drawings from Mau- Kelsey are not of a uniformly high quality: in fig. 41, p. 429 (expanded from Mau-Kelsey, p. 215) the piscina in the Grand Palaestra is virtually unrecognizable; and in fig. 7, p. 127, the reduced size of the plan of the forum (cf. Mau-Kelsey, p. 44) results in illegibility of numbers and the blurring of other detail. Further, the key which accompanies the plan of the forum (p. 126), also adapted from that of Mau-Kelsey, presents as certain many identifications which are sheer hypothesis and which were, in the earlier work, presented as such (cf. Mau-Kelsey, pp. 47-8). The proofs have been vigilantly read, but a few unfortunate misprints have slipped through: p. 71, line 5-read Proculus; p. 142, eight lines from bottom-M. Epidius Sabinus; p. 185, three lines from bottom-memorandum; p. 194, seven lines from bottom-Capua 367</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. (and E. Badian, Historia, VI [1957], p. 346, should have been cited in connection with that discussion). Finally, a more serious reservation. The reader regularly encounters entire sentences, even successive sentences, which have been culled from the work of other scholars and merely turned into French by the author. One may hope to see this fault corrected in future editions. J. H. D'ARMs. THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. R. H. BARROW. Plutarch and his Times. Bloomington and London, Indiana University Press, 1967. Pp. xv + 203. Barrow has characterized (p. 172) Clough's version of the Lives as " unremarkable " but " serviceable." The same might be said of this book, which presents a comprehensive, though generally super- ficial and sketchy study of Plutarch's life, works, and thought. It is obviously written with the beginner and the non-specialist in mind (cf. the preface, p. ix); for Barrow twice (pp. xiv, 150) points out that his author wrote in Greek, and the titles of Plutarch's Moralia as well as all quotations are Englished in the main text. (With very few exceptions, Greek appears only in the notes.) Also, discussion of Greek and Latin terms (primarily on pp. 21 [symposium], 49-50 [official terminology], 68 [Plutarch's etymologies], 76 [mystagogue], 85-92 [daemons and deisidaimonia], 108-9 [euthymia and tranquil- litas], 122 [arete], 130-1 [Fortuna], 139-41 [logos], 150-1 [Plu- tarch's knowledge of Latin], 163-4 [Amyot's translation of technical terms]) and of modern Plutarch criticism is usually kept to a mini- mum. Barrow takes as his starting premise that Plutarch is " im- perfectly understood if he is not seen in the environment of the Roman Empire" (p. xv), and has indeed achieved a certain degree of success in depicting this environment. Barrow's purpose and interests mean that the Moralia receive more attention than the Lives, which are actually the subject of only two of the book's twelve chapters (7 and 11). In the first six chapters Barrow undertakes to depict the political, social, cultural, and religious atmosphere in which Plutarch lived and wrote. A sketch (Ch. 1) of the political, economic, and literary life of Greece under Roman sway is followed by chapters (2-3) dealing with Plutarch's Roman citizenship, family, education, home, and friends. In these last two chapters Plutarch's house is depicted as "a kind of unofficial academy of letters" (p. 18). Though there are numerous references to inscriptions and other Moralia (e. g., Bar- row accepts [pp. 24-5 and n. 5] the identification of Demetrius of Tarsus, who appears in the De defectu oraculorum, with the Demetrius who dedicated the two bronze plates found in York [Dessau, I.L.S., 8861], possibly during Agricola's governorship in Britain), the Quaestiones Convivales (translated as Table Talks) are the most prominent source for Barrow's discussion of Plutarch's circle of friends and their intellectual interests. Barrow is convinced 368</page></plain_text>
