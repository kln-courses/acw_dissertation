<plain_text><page sequence="1">226 Reviews of Greek during the Middle Ages is common property to all the standard histories of literature and scholarship, but the subject is of sufficient in- terest and the evidence of sufficient bulk to provide scope for separate treatment. By figuring out the broken track of Greek scholarship in England from the seventh to the fifteenth century Mr Stephens enables us to approach the 'greater figures like Grosseteste and Bacon with a proper perspective and to gauge more accurately the contribution of Grocyn, Linacre and their immediate predecessors. It is here that he touches on the same ground as Herr Schirmer, who is primarily concerned with the development of humane studies as a whole in England during the later Middle Ages and with the several stages and symptoms of that development through book-collecting, the patronage of letters and the achievements of itinerant English scholars in Italy. The close proximity of the two writers at this point of their investigation is indicated by their use of manuscript material; Herr Schirmer summarises the contents of John Free's unprinted Cosmographia and reproduces for the first time extracts from the correspondence of Free's friend Tiptoft; Mr Stephens transcribes the whole of Free's letters from MS. Bodley 587. Each thesis is a useful and well-documented contribution to the history of letters and culture in mediaeval England, a subject upon which much still remains to be written; of the two, Herr Schirmer's is the more important by reason of its wider range and as the first systematic study of a phase in the English Renaissance which no student of literary history can afford to neglect. B. E. C. DAVIS. LONDON. The English Folk-Play. By E. K. CHAMBERS. Oxford: Clarendon Press. 1933. vi+248 pp. 10s. Since Sir Edmund Chambers first gave an account of the Mummers' Play in The Medieval Stage much new material has been collected, and to the great benefit of scholarship he has considered it 'worth while to go over the ground again, and to bring together the threads of the old and the new evidence with regard to this singular and long enduring seasonal ceremony'. Sir Edmund has a gift for understatement where his own work is concerned. In The English Folk-Play he makes fresh and varied information accessible to us, and, having gathered together all the available material, considers it as a whole, in the light of his encyclopaedic knowledge of folk-lore and mediaeval drama. This is likely to prove the finally authoritative work on the subject. The arrangement of the book is a little confusing at times, but this is no doubt due to the nature of the subject-matter. Having constructed a 'normalized text', Sir Edmund proceeds to analyse it into component parts, examining each character and episode with unprecedented thorough- ness and illustrating his points with entertaining quotations from the actual texts. His identification-after due suspense-of the missing Dragon with the mysterious Beau Slasher I found particularly pleasing. Especially interesting, also, is the Ampleforth Plough Play,</page><page sequence="2">where traditional elements are combined with ill-remembered and ill- assorted scraps from Congreve's Allfor Love; and the Weston-sub-Edge Play, where the 'Cure' episode is expanded by would-be comic but actually very stupid dialogue and patter. 'All this', remarks Sir Edmund, who is no sentimentalist in these matters, 'comes straight from the village. It is the folk at its worst.' This book, indeed, offers little encouragement to those who like to find a communal or folk origin for art and literature. The corruptions undergone by the Mummers' Play ('activity of youth, activity of age', for instance, appearing in one version as 'Act Timothy of youth, act Timothy of age') bear melancholy witness to the low level of culture prevalent in English villages during the nineteenth century, the result of 'enclosures and Speenhamland dole'. Students of social history and culture, as well as folk-lorists, should find much to interest them in The English Folk-Play. Sir Edmund Chambers' clear presentment of the history of the Mum- mers' Play is particularly welcome. His conclusions are stated with a reassuring caution and freedom from bias. The existing examples probably go back to a single archetype, which cannot have been composed before the sixteenth century, although the fundamental elements of the play may well be of a more remote antiquity. The search for mediaeval parallels proved disappointing, but strikingly similar ceremonies from Western Europe and from the Balkans suggest the existence of an original European ludus, performed in animal disguise, and dealing with a mock death and revival. The suggested explanation of the significance of this ludus carries us into territory familiar to readers of The Golden Bough. The folk-play was originally a fertility rite in which 'the fertilization spirit in animal form' was sacrificed, and the priest-king or his substitute was put to death. In view of the evidence concerning the dying and rising god, collected by Dr Frazer, it is not quite clear why Sir Edmund should be so puzzled by the linking of death and revival in the folk-play that he suggests on p. 221 two possible explanations for which 'there is not much evidence beyond that of a natural logic'. Surely even the oldest parallels to our folk-plays are not so old that the influence upon them of an anthropomorphic as well as of a 'phytomorphic or theriomorphic conception of divinity' can only be admitted as a bare possibility (cp. p. 222). For the singular 'Man in Woman's Clothes', and for the 'Quete', Sir Edmund gives the same explanation as he gave in The Medieval Stage. The presence of the 'Man-Woman' probably recalls an original predominance of the female sex in agriculture. The' Quete' is' a perambula- tion taking the beneficent influence from house to house'. This may well be so, but, in this connexion, one would have welcomed a more detailed enquiry into why the performers of the play were called 'Mummers', a term which may have once had a more precise meaning than Sir Edmund is inclined to admit. Considerations of space forbid any detailed dis- cussion of the subject here, but I have suggested elsewhere that there is some evidence for connecting the Momerie or Mumming with Mormo (an ogress of Greek folk-lore), who seems to have been connected with some kind of masquerade, possibly a miming of the Wild Hunt. The Momerie Reviews 227</page><page sequence="3">228 Reviews may have travelled westwards via Venice and the Tyrol, and the Mum- mers may have personated the spirits or ghosts who were popularly supposed to partake of the 'Tables of Fortune' set out by the super- stitious at Christmas time. I am not, of course, suggesting that the Momerie is to be equated with the Mummers' Play, but only that it might be worth consideration in connexion with the Quete. After all the Quete is a collection, and the Mummers seem distinctly more anxious to receive than to give. The chief impression which remains after reading The English Folk- Play is astonishment at the wide ramifications and rich human interest of a subject which one had been inclined to regard as narrow and even a little dry. But Sir Edmund Chambers always makes exact scholarship a means of bringing to life any subject to which he turns his attention. ENID WELSFORD. CAMBRIDGE. Mythology and the Renaissance Tradition in English Poetry. By DOUGLAS BUSH. University of Minnesota Press; London: H. Milford. 1932. 360 pp. $4. Mythology can, and does, in these days lead poets and critics into strange regions-the descent into the Avernus of the Unconscious is only too easy. The Preface to this book, however, is enough to reassure the hard-headed but slightly nervous reader; as soon as he has followed up the heartening names (culminating in that of Professor Livingstone Lowes) in whose tradition Professor Bush aligns himself, and has reached the sentence 'Finally, my wife did not compile the index', he knows he is safe and settles down to enjoy himself. As the broad unity of any period especially stimulating to the re- searcher becomes broken up by highly specialised studies of very limited fields, the wood vanishes in the trees. Yet someone must continue to see the wood if proportion is to be kept. Professor Bush has worked long at the detailed elucidation of mythological topics in Renaissance poetry; it may be reckoned to him as an inspiration to have seen that in mythology he had a means of refocusing a scattered and multifarious field where perspective was in danger of being lost. One of the out- standing merits of the book is its organisation of the sequence and de- velopment of Elizabethan non-dramatic poetry as a whole, from the mediaeval heritage to the evaporation of myth in parody. Not all the topics surveyed repay Professor Bush equally well. The minor mythological writers (ch. Ix) and even Drayton and the Fletchers (ch. vm) chronicle a small nectar from which nothing very rich can be distilled. On the other hand I unhesitatingly pick out the chapter on Marlowe (vi) as one of the ripest and most balanced criticisms of that dangerously attractive figure that have appeared in recent years-al- though, indeed, the estimate of Marlowe is not complete until the whole book has been read, for to the Hero and Leander Professor Bush returns continually for a standard of comparison. The chapters on the other major poets, Spenser (v), Shakespeare (vii) and Milton (xiv), are also</page></plain_text>
