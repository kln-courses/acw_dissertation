<plain_text><page sequence="1">On the IE Etymology of Greek (w)anax1 By Lothar Willms, Heidelberg Abstract: This paper will re-examine the origin of Greek (w)anax, (w)anaktos 'lord', nowadays still a subject of doubt and discussion. Notwithstanding earlier derivations from the stem (w)anak-, the search must depart from the oldest form (w)anakt-, which Szemerényi first segmented correctly as *wen-ag-t- or *wn-ag-t-, i.e. IE *wen- 'kin' 'tribe' + *ag- 'to lead' + agent-suffix -t. Later objections against this sound analysis help to clarify the meaning of the first component as 'battle', 'victory'. In view of this, the following proposes as the original meaning of wanax 'leader in battle' or 'somebody who leads to victory'. Whether inherited from IE times or borrowed from Greek, Phrygian vanaktei fits into this etymology, whereas Old Indian vanij- 'merchanť and Tokharian В ñakte A ñkat 'God' or nätäk 'lord' and naši 'lady' must be excluded from consideration. 0. Introduction To IE research, the origin of Greek (w)anax, (w)anaktos 'lord' has always been a puzzle. The resultant despair has even gone so far as to take into consideration a foreign,2 maybe Minoan3 and probably non-Ш etymology.4 The leading etymolo- gical dictionaries of ancient Greek reject the attempts at an 1 1 am grateful to Prof. G.

Ruijgh 1999: 529 thinks that it is pre-Greek. Palaima 1995: 128 tries to explain why there is no equivalent in the LA texts, but Driessen 2002: 2 n. 5 offers a concrete candidate: "The closest Li- near A term [sc. of wanax], u.na.ka, occurs on inscribed ritual vases, dedicat- ed in peak sanctuaries etc. Since there are several examples of the alternation u/wa, it may suggest that the word is of Minoan origin. If the same sense is intended, perhaps something as 'Lord' is meant. I owe this observation to Paul Faure." 4 Palaima 1995: 122f.; Beekes 2009: 98: "No IE etymology, and probably a substrate word."

Like tyrannos and basileus, (w)anax, (w)anaktos is one of the numerous terms for 'chief or 'leader' in Greek whose origin is still discussed. Tyrannos is only found in alphabetical Greek from the Homeric hymns onwards and therefore much more 5 Meringer 1926: 114 offers a quite eccentric derivation: He assumes a common origin with Old Indian vámšya- 'cross beam, joist, lineal descend- ant, ancestor' and vamsá 'bamboo cane or any cane, upper timbers or beams of a house, back bone, spine, lineage, genealogy, offspring' and lat. vacerra 'wooden post or stake'. Schwyzer 1915: 86 n. 1 proposes Old Indian vanómi 'to gain' + kt- 'to possess, to acquire' (cf. gr. ktáomai). He was followed by two Italian researchers: Ribezzo 1928: 96 *wena 'family, domicile' (&lt; *wen- 'risiedere, costumare, aver famigliarità') + kt(i)s (&lt; *kti 'to found, to inhabi- té') &gt; *wanakt(i)s 'founder of the house, chief of the tribe, king', Pisani 1930: 176, 180 *wnnä &lt; *wen 'to win' + *ktis, *ktitos (cf. ktáomai, Old In- dian -ksit- 'lord'). Original are Windekens 1948: 279 f. middle persian vanag, arm. *vanak 'winner' and Puhvel 1956: 215 *wn-n-nk(t)- 'not subject to doom'. 6 Frisk I 102 "unerklärt", Chantraine 84 "inconnue".

Irslinser in Wodtko 2Ó08: 267. Even if this paper does not want to increase the number of etymological attempts by yet another one, a critical examination of them can still be - as I hope - a welcome and helpful contribution to further discussion; the complementary etymological dictionaries either do not have an entry for "anax" (Windekens 1986: 11 f.) or stop their exposé of the discussion too early (Jucquois, Devlamminck 1977: 31 f.). Palaima 1995: 124 n. 13 who relies on Fred Schwink for his information ignores Szemerényi's proposal which may make him underestimate the chance of an IE etymology. Without further discussion Hajnal 1998: 63 calls Szemerényi's (and Puhvel's) etymology "unbefriedigend" ("unsatisfactory"), but admits that his own mor- phological segmentation is quite close to Szemerényi's one (1998: 66 n. 77).</page><page sequence="3">234 Lothar Willms exposed to the suspicion of borrowing.9 (W)anax, (w)anaktos however is, like basileus, attested in the earliest documents of Greek, LB and Homer. While it does occur in later poets, it is not used in classical Attic prose except in special cases. The explanation of the diachronic development of the semantic field 'chief or 'leader' and its interaction with the synchronie organi- sation of this group of words10 varies in accordance with the etymology of these words which the respective researcher pro- poses.11 However, all ideas on diachronic and synchronie semantics with a prehistoric implication remain speculation unless they are founded on a solid etymological ground. The prehistoric etymology and the historical significance of a word are two distinct aspects which, for the sake of clarity, should not be confounded. In the case of wanax, the clear separation of these two strings of analysis is even more advisable because the etymology of wanax was not perspicuous12 even for a Myce- naean-speaking Greek; because of this, the semantic of wanax could develop without etymological restrictions. Scholars have indeed found out that the concept of wanax was conspicuously elaborated in the Mycenaean age.13 Of course, in order to be accepted, every etymology must have a plausible link on a larger scale with the semantics of the first attestation. So one has to take into consideration that already in LB (w)anax, (w)anaktos has a clear functional distribution with qa-si-re-u basileus,14 i.e. 9 For propositions cf. Frisk II 947 and Chantraine 1 146. Van Windekens 1986: 223 and Papanastassiou 1994: 86 have no entry. ш See the fundamental study of Carlier 1984. Szemerényi 1979: 217 "And the IE origin of this term [se. ánax] would very nicely agree with the finding that Fánax was succeeded in the sense of 'king' by the substratum word basileus." But cf. Georgiev 1984: 127 PIE *gwhnti-l(e)hú-s &gt; "Kampfes-(Kriegs-)Held". According to Palaima 1995: 122 п. 7 both in Hittite (t/labarnas) and in Greek the word for 'king' is no derivation from the root *rëg-, but a loan word. 12Hainall998:69. 13 See Kilián 1988, Wright 1995. The existence of such a semantic difference is implied even by Ruijgh 1999: 529 who has a rather unusual genealogical view (qa-si-re-u "prince", wa-na-ka "roi"). For an examination of the Linear В texts on the qa-si-re-u's office see Carlier 1984: 108-116 (222-230 gives a survey of the Homeric use) and Lejdegârd 1996-97.</page><page sequence="4">On the IE Etymology of Greek (w)anax 235 it is on a superior hierarchic level. In LB wanax and its deriva- tions are used for gods and the highest person of the social pyramid,15 in Homer for gods and for those on the top of a hierarchy, and in the Od., in addition to this, for godlike persons (Nausikaa 6.149) and for the master of the household (oikoio anax 1.397). (W)anax is richly used in derivation from its first attestation in LB and in composition since Homer.16 The early attestation and derivation speak in favour of an old word and encourage the search for an IE origin. The derived words will play an important role in discussing the original stem of wanak(t). However, we shall start this discussion with this word itself. 1. The Original Stem of wanax and its Derivations: Wanakt- or Wanak- ? Some dialects in historical time display the stem wanak- (Phoc, Argol. and the Dorian and Attic attribute of the Dioskuroi anakes),17 which is plausibly explained by the analogy of pure velar stems with a preceding a like phylax, korax, kolax.18 This is all the more likely since stems in -kt- are quite rare. There are only two examples, nyx, nykt- and gala, galakt-. Unfortunately, both also display forms without t, but they must be considered secondary.19 So one can still argue, as 15 So Szemerényi 1979: 216 f. and despite a different opinion on the role of wanax Palaima 1995: 124 f. See the instructive figure in Kilián 1988: 293. Cf. Chantraine 84. Sophie Minon, Chronique d'Étymologie Grecque, Revue de Philology 77 (2003) 113 adds the compound áwanax and with hesi- tation bánnas (cf. Andreas Willi, «Achäische» wanaktes in Süditalien. ZPE 140 (2002) 59-63). For the Attic use s. LSJ 107 s.v. avaiceç ("acoxTjpoiv 'Avcckoiv те AioaKO')poiv IG 3.195, cf. 1.34.8, 2.699.30, etc., Plu. Thés. 33, Cie.

Lat. lac, lactis and gala have no equivalents in other IE languages (cf. Pokorný 1959: 400 f.). Walde-Hofmann vol. 1, p. 741 reconstruct an original stem with t *glakt-. The Greek forms without t are either interpreted as secondary (Pokorný 1959: 400 f.) or labeled as unexplained (Frisk 284, Chantraine 207). As to the IE 'night' forms without t occur only in Greek and</page><page sequence="5">236 Lothar Willms has sometimes been suggested, that also the t in wanax is somehow secondary:20 It could have been added to wanax in analogy with these two words21 and omitted later in analogy with the pure velar stems. But why should pre-Hellenic speakers have complicated things by adding an analogical t, especially since wanax, a person, semantically belongs to a different group from the abstract nyx and the concrete noun gala? On the contrary, one can guess that the analogy of these two nouns with an unstable t favoured its omission in wanax which took place as we said in analogy with the pure velar stems. In any case, this change must have taken place after Homer.22 Thus the priority of (w)anakt- is endorsed last but not least by the chronology since both LB and Homer display a form with t. But what about the feminine wanassa, also attested since LB in the dual23 wa-na-so-i wanassoin,24 and the verb wanassô known from Homer (II. 1.252) onwards?25 Both forms seem to go back to a formans with j. So here the case is a bit more mostly in derivation (adverbs like nykha and nyk-tôr and composition) cf. Pokornv 1959: 762 f. 20 Ribezzo 1928: 96 who believes himself in the priority of wanakt- on account of its early attestation quotes Karl Brugmann, Albert Thumb, Grie- chische Grammatik. Munich 41913, 232, who had already identified the t with the formans of derived nouns, but thinks that it was added either to the verbal stem of anássô or to the noun stem wanak-. Haudry 1996: 53f. supposes that the basis was the vocative ana and that the other cases were formed by the influence of nouns in t like thanatos and hippota. This paradigm would only later be contaminated with that of gala which would explain the alternation of kt vs. к in wanax. On this highly speculative hypothesis see below. L¿ So Szemerényi 1979: 216. Cf. Beekes 2009: 98f.: "It is probable that the forms without -t- are vouneer, Г...1." 23 Or plural, cf. Ventris-Chadwick 478 f. Hajnal's counter-arguments against the communis opinio are far from being cogent (1995: 63-67). The argument that on two tablets (PY Fr 1227 and 1235) wa-na-so-i would be aside another deity, whereas elsewhere there is only one deity as a recipient of oil (1995: 63 f.) is an interesting observation, but no compelling reason. His main argument that a morpheme border speaks against Lejeune's thesis of a (virtual) assimilation (1995: 65) remains vague and presupposes his own theories (1995: 43-45). z* PYFr 1222, Fr 1227 f. anássô is absent in LB because there is no need and place for this poetic verb in administrative texts.</page><page sequence="6">On the ЕЕ Etymology of Greek (w)anax 237 complicated since, besides the analogy which we know from wanakt- vs. wanak-, we must take phonetic change into account as a second possible factor. Schwyzer argued that anássô can only go back to anak-, since *anakt-y would have been treated like khthy in ion. dixós &lt; *dikhthyos (1939: 319, 322), whose stem is preserved in dikhthá, whereas dissós, att. dittos goes back to a stem *dikh- still visible in dikha (1939: 598). Following Schwyzer, Ruijgh argued that not only the verb wanássô, but also the feminine wánassa must be derived from a form without ř,26 since on *wanaktya and *wanaktyo would have given a form with x9 assuming like Schwyzer that tj would have resulted in s which joints with к to jc.28 But Chadwick29 and afterwards Lejeune30 pointed out that, as far as the results of assibilation go, Mycenaean, unlike the other dialects, still distinguishes s, which goes back to an original *ty (e.g. to-so &lt; *totyo-), from z, which results from *ky (e.g. ka-zo-e kazohes &lt; *kakyoses vs. kakious), and maybe also in the feminine suffix -assaAatta (e.g. ta-ra-za- po-ro31 thalazaporos vs. ion. thalassa, att. thalatta &lt; *khja, cf. mac. dalágkha); they concluded that wanassa rather goes back to *wanaktya. Lejeune explains that before the assibilation, *kty was assimilated to *tty. 2 Even if one does not want to go so far, 26 Georgiev 1984: 125 still supposes *anakia. 27 1957: 112 28 1999: 530. 2y1969:89f. 1972: 103 n. 2, 108 n. 4. Their argumentation is shared by Ventris- Chadwick 478 f. This word is a conjecture in PY Ad 686. It is just the decisive za that is uncertain. Ventris-Chadwick 162 believe "hardly" in the alternative interpret- tation Tpocyocpópoç. Apart from Crespo 1985: 96 who directly refers to Lejeu- ne, no lexical resource of Mycenaean studies contains this word (Chadwick- Baumbach 1963: 201, 269; Baumbach 1971: 167, 190; Ventris-Chadwick 584, Diccionario Micènico II 318, Bartoněk 2003: 603), even not Lejeune 1964: 76 f. himself. Therefore one cannot rely too much on it as an argument. 32 1972: 103 n. 2. Petruševski 1971: 136 and 136 f. is right - relying on the graphical evidence of two separate series of syllabograms - in separating the supposed pronunciation of wa-na-so-i (pure sibilant) from ka-zo-e (ky according to him), but, illogically, he insists that this treatment of wa-na-so-i was only possible from a pure velar stem (1971: 124 f.). His derivation of</page><page sequence="7">238 Lothar Willms it is plausible to assume a virtual assimilation, i.e. kty was treated like (t)ty and not like ky.33 Lejeune's theory is very sound and coherent because it is able to explain the different results of assibilation in wa-na-so-i and ta-ra-za-po-ro by a different base (*kty and *ky). Therefore Szemerényi seems to be right who, following Lejeune's argumentation, concludes that wanakt- is the original stem and that the stem wanak- developed only in post-Mycenaean and maybe even post-Homeric times.34 However, it has been pointed out that the phonetic change Lejeune postulates is without parallel and that it is difficult to reconcile with k(h)t(h)y &gt; x in dixós.35 This reason for this, at least as to the non-Mycenaean dialects, which are the only ones to transmit clear forms of dixós/dissós (see below), is that Schwyzer's counter- argument still seems pertinent unless we accept the doubtful hypothesis that chypr. wanassa and ion.-att. ánassa36 are borrowed from Mycenaean.37 This seems to be a clear argument for assuming that in the non-Mycenaean dialects, anassa is derived from a simple velar stem *ánakya. Repeating Schwyzer's argumentation, Ruijgh supposes that even Linear В s (in his transcription ss) in wa-na-so-i goes back to *ánakya and stands for /ts/ pronounced [^s] which was simplified in later dialects either as ss or tt.38 Moreover, like Thumb-Scherer (1959: П 187), Brixhe assumes that ¥ in Pamphylian wana¥a,39 wa-na-so-i from a feast, based on the Greek name for 'lamb' (1971: 131 f.), remains an isolated idea. 33 So Chadwick 1969: 90. 34 1979: 215 f. 33 Crespo 1985: 94 n. 1 following Hart 1966: 132. J0 Od. 3.380, 6.175; Aischylos Eu. 228, 235, 443 for Athena. 36 % of the non onomastic Mycenaean vocabulary is found also in Homeric epics, but concrete borrowings seem to be difficult to prove (Barto- něk 2003: 467 f.). The cases of subsistence of Linear В onomastic Hajnal 1998: 70-74 gives are so special that they are certainly due to borrowing. 38 1957: 112, 1967: 49 f., 1999: 531 n. 74. 39 The letter that looks like a trident or 4? but with angular arms whereas archaic *F looks like Y appears twice in wana¥a (cf.

So, either we are dealing with an unsolvable puzzle or the evidence for *wanakya seems overwhelming, but I want to show that Ruijgh's model of a phonetic development *ky &gt; *ty &gt; *ss (with later dialectal differentiation into ss or tt)42 is the one most able to reconcile Lejeune's theory of the (virtual) assimilation and an original stem *wanakt-ya with the heterogeneous material attestation of wánassa. But before doing so we should re-examine the relevance of dissós/dixós for the evolution of *wanak(t)ya since all calls for a pure velar stem and all reluctance against Lejeune's theory are based on Schwyzer's objection. There are some reasons for contesting the relevance of dissós/dixós for the development of *wanak(t)ya, especially its late attestation, which has no certain evidence in Linear B43 and is completely absent from the Home- ric epics.44 The form dixós, which plays such a crucial role in 40 Except for Petruševski 1971: 134-137. 1976: 7 and 79 f. Ruijgh 1967: 50, however, supposes that *ty under- went this evolution before ("naturellement antérieures") *ky since otherwise there would have been a confusion of the two phonohistoric lines. The gra- phical evidence of elaTon, together with considerations of glottochronology (*ky had first to change to *ty before undergoing the same development), supports Brixhe's chronology (although for our purposes, the idea of a chro- nological difference suffices). 4Z 1967: 49 f. 43 The man's name di-so in KN Sc 255 (Ventris-Chadwick 540, Aura- Jorro 1985: 178). 44 Here we find only dikh(th)a (R. van Bennekom LfgrE vol. 2, 319).</page><page sequence="9">240 Lothar Willms the reconstruction of common Greek phonetic rules for the treatment of *k(h)t(h)y, is an Ionic form, in literature transmitted almost only in Herodotus (2.44 etc.) and Anacreon (Iamb. 6 West). So we may assume a different phonetic treatment of anassa and dissós/dixós, separated from each other by several centuries. Moreover, the constellation of variants for wanassa and dissós/dixós is exactly the opposite. For dissós/dixós, the existence of dikh(th)a favours the persistence of this symmetric dualism in the derivation as well, whereas for *wanak(t)ya the difficulties of the derivation of kt (cf. пух) suggested a virtual assimilation *kty &gt; *(t)ty, which results in almost all dialects in ss. The three-consonant cluster *kty, kt being difficult to handle for derivation, easily lends itself to such a simplification, and the quasi-dialectal ubiquity of this rule (see below on Ruijgh and Mycenaean) is a weighty argument in favour of Lejeune's explanation. Moreover, it is not implausible to suppose a singular development for a singular case. The isolation of this development is somewhat counterbalanced by later dialect inscriptions which yield an assimilation of pt and kt &gt; (t)t45 (as in Italian). Moreover, in the non-Mycenaean dialects, we can assume the analogical influence of feminine words like thalassa, which suppose also a simple velar stem (or maybe46 also a dental, e.g. melissa). And perhaps in Mycenaean the analogy of the suffix -essa (cf. pe-de-we-sa pedwessa47 'provided with feet' and the feminine present participle a-pe-a-sa apeassa 'absent' (KN Ap 64,1 vs. apoûsa) &lt; *es-ntya48), and a pre-Greek suffix (cf. already LB ku-pa-ri-so)49 whose original form and phonetic evolution we cannot trace back,50 influenced the phonetic deve- lopment of *wanak(t)ya.

On the contrary, Ruijgh's tempting global model is not as coherent and universal as that. For, as to Mycenaean, Ruijgh ignores Chadwick's and Lejeune's sound argumentation, de- clares ka-zo-e where the Mycenaean change *ky &gt; z is evident a singular case and makes some dubious remarks on the well attested LB feminine words whose velar stems are transformed into z on contact with the suffix -ia.51 This whole interpretation of the Mycenaean graphic evidence is very arbitrary. Why should the Mycenaeans not have used z, which probably stands for a dental plus a sibilant,52 for wanassa if this word was really pronounced /ss/? Only because the double ss outweighed the single t in this phonetic cluster which in this form is simply postulated by Ruijgh? Unlike in the case of the labiovelars, Mycenaean is already subject to dialect differentiation in assibi- lation, and is very innovative in that area, as clearly evident from the written evidence.53 In alphabetical times, Pamphylian provides a clear counter example since it used different letters for the results of assibilation in wana^a and in oca and in the feminine suffix timaFesa &lt; *ty.54 wana¥a can well be inter- preted with Ruijgh's model, as Brixhe does, but it is by no means a compelling argument that the original stem of (w)anas- sa was wanak- in all Greek dialects since the late and scarce attestation of Pamphylian cautions against Petrusevski's enthu- siasm of a continuity between Mycenaean and Pamphylian (1971: 137) and it is quite possible that at that late date, Pam- phylian indeed used, as Brixhe and Thumb-Scherer presume, the 51 a3-za (&lt; *aigya), su-za (&lt; *sukya), ka-za (&lt; khalkya) and i-za- (&lt; *hiqya) (1999: 532). The example of Slavic and Romance palatalization shows that there was often a stage with palatal sound (Crespo 1985: 92). This is possible also for Greek assibilation. But against Crespo 1985: 102 one must argue that the Mycenaean writing gives no evidence for palatalization at that time. ^ S. the chart in Bartoněk 2003: 142.

The parallel existence of oca and the feminine suffixe timaFesa in Pamphylian, both going back to *ty, is no obstacle, but is rather elegantly explained by Ruijgh's thesis that *ky first passed to *ty so that its development, although parallel to that of *ty, is, according to Brixhe, retarded in comparison with *ty, a fact which would apply to the cluster *kty in *wanaktya still more than to a simple velar stem.57 In any case, this combination of Ruijgh's and Lejeune's theory has the advantage of offering an explanation for the written evidence of all dialects. Thus, to sum up this long and complicated discussion, the different treatment of *k(h)t(h)y in Ion. dixós which Schwyzer first pointed out is no reason for not positing *kty as the original stem of wanassa which in a virtual assimilation resulted via *(t)ty in ss, whose intermediary stage lss might be preserved in Pamphylian wana^a (maybe spoken [ts]), which is alternatively to be explained as a later formation from a pure velar stem, perhaps going back to a virtual assimilation via *k(k)y. For the verb anássô and its origin, we can apply the same analysis as for ánassa, however with one restriction: Since this verb is first attested in II. 1.252, and although it is very likely that it existed already in Mycenaean time, we have no evidence for its exact shape, including the end of the stem which interests 55 Brixhe 1976: 140 derives it from wanax. Brixhe 1976: 7 n. 3 suggests this phonetic value, but later explicitly decides in favour of /ss/ (1976: 79).

This complete lack of Mycenaean evi- dence strongly limits the use of anássô for the reconstruction of the original stem of wanax, almost forcing research to navigate between the Scylla of speculation by analogy with other words (Lejeune) or the Charybdis of a rather isolated theory (Geor- giev). Lejeune is rather speculative in supposing that, like ánassa, anássô goes back to a form with *kty, virtually assimi- lated to (t)ty,59 so that it followed the regular development of verbs ending in a dental.60 One might object against Lejeune' s theory that the sigmatic forms of anássô are not formed as in the dental stem verbs, but rather as in the pure velar stem verbs (anaxô, anaxa). But he only claims that the present stem was phonetically treated like the dental verbs, not that the whole paradigm was formed according to their pattern. For the Myce- naean age, Lejeune' s hypothesis is only supported by the example of the nouns and our faith in the consistent function of phonetic rules. But this thesis is, as in the case of ánassa, valua- ble for all dialects. Georgiev' s thesis, which supposes that the present was formed by analogy with the verbs with a simple velar stem like prassô and tasso, since the sigmatic stems looked that way anyway (1984: 125 f.), pertains only to the non-Myce- naean dialects, but relies on the given material and succeeds in explaining it. Fortunately, these two theories are well compatible. The missing link between them are the sigmatic forms; from the pure phonetic evidence it cannot be discerned whether the future stem 58 The verb itself is certainly older than Homer as proven by the epic formula î(pi ocváaaei, whose formation presupposes the existence of digamma for stylistic (alliteration) and metrical (hiatus) reasons (for other Homeric ele- ments that go back to Mycenaean time s.

Also, the sigmatic forms are easy to derive from kt, cf. the nom. sing. *wanakt-s &gt; wanax and the everyday word nyx &lt; *nykt-s. So it is well possible that speakers of post-Mycenaean dialects interpreted the present forms which they had kept since Myce- naean times and which phonetically can be derived from kt as belonging to a pure velar stem and isolated a pure velar stem wanak- for further derivation from it (one can still assume that they formed the present stem themselves in analogy to sigmatic forms which bore a similarity to the pure velar stem). Thus the scarce and late attestation (only non-Mycenaean dialects) per- mits to maintain Georgiev' s theory side by side with Lejeune's speculations. It is, however, doubtful whether Ruijgh 1999: 530 is right in supposing that the homophony of the present stem *anáktyô &gt; fanáxô with the future anáxô favoured the formation of a present stem in analogy with the pure velar stems, because the evolution *anáktyô &gt; fanáxô is not as clear as that. We can conclude that phonetically all forms of anássô can be derived from an original stem kt in all dialects but in later times they could be interpreted as formed by a pure velar stem and thus fostered the pure velar stem derivation from (w)ánax, as we meet it in ánakes. The case of the adjective wa-na-ka-te-ro62 wanákteros is hardly less complicated. One can segment it as wanakt-eros and assume that, like eleutheros (derived also from a noun with a final dental), it was formed with the suffix -ero.63 But scholars tend almost unanimously to favour the suffix -teros.64 They adduce many examples where -teros in Homeric epics still bears 61 Leieune 1972: 103 n. 2. 52 E. g.

Thus, as seen from the early Mycenaean derivations of wanax, ánassa is certainly derived from a stem wanakt-, whereas wanakteros, like the Homeric anássô, could be derived either from wanak- or from wanakt-. But given the early attestation of wanakt- in both LB and Homer, we must, when looking for relatives of wanax and its derivations outside Greek and recon- structing an Ш form, suppose a stem wanakt-. 65 Ruijgh 1999: 530. But he thinks (531) that wanakteros was not under- stood in the 1st millennium ВС (apart from epic language) so that it was replaced by anaktoros, indicating the switching in pentêkóntoros vs. pentêkónteros 'ship with 50 oars'. 66Palaimal995: 134. 67 Palaima 1995: 134. Ruiish 1999: 530. 68 The suffix -eros in wanakteros, nykteros and eleutheros, all three of which bear the idea of an opposition, can be seen as a variant of -teros (otherwise one must identify the derivation suffix -eros, cf. dnopherós, pho- berós, for further examples cf. Chantraine 1968: 229 f., which in later times allowed a segmentation in accordance with the stems in kt) to avoid compli- cations provoked by the clash of the two dentals (Ruijgh 1999: 530 n. 63 sees phonetic problems in a derivation from *wanakt-teros &gt; *wanaks-teros &gt; f wanakhtheros). But it is still possible that the idea of the suffix -teros prevented this phonetic change or helped to restore a form in which -teros could be identified.

Phrygian vanaktei The most obvious IE relative is Phrygian vanaktei which has also a stem with kt. The mere existence of Phrygian vanaktei, however, does not guarantee that Greek (w)anax is inherited from the IE time, because the Phrygian word could very well be borrowed from Greek. According to Frisk I 103 and Chantraine 84, it is a loan word of Greek origin70 (which would prove at least that the Greeks of that time used a form with kt). Chro- nology opposes a common IE origin of these two words, which Georgiev suggests (1984: 126): Whereas Greek wanax is richly attested from the 15th century ВС onwards, vanaktei appears in one inscription in Old Phrygian (8th to the 3rd century)71 where it is found together with lavagtaei in the expression lavagtaei vanaktei.72 According to Claus Haebler, these words could either be borrowed from Greek or inherited from Ш.73 The mor- phology of vanaktei does not help in this matter, since the dative ending -ey, also attested in Phrygian materey (W-Olb), is certainly inherited from IE time, lavagtaei has the same attesta- tion as vanaktei, for it also has a Greek cousin in Linear B.74 Neumann says nothing about vanaktei, but thinks that lavagtaei was taken over into Phrygian, insinuating the chronology of attestation as an argument (1988: 16).

I, p. 8 speculate that lavagtaei is an erroneous spelling for lavagetai with transposition of the e which, like vanaktei, would perfectly fit together with the Mycenaean form. But Brixhe-Lejeune are reluctant to admit an erroneous spelling in a document of such an official importance. 73 S.v.

Triimpy 1986: 26-29 argues convincingly that this word from the choral lyric continues the Mycenaean noun.</page><page sequence="16">On the IE Etymology of Greek (w)anax 247 thesis: Because a) the emigrations of Greeks and Phrygian tribes from their common homeland in the South Balkans to Greece and to Anatolia respectively is separated by about a millen- nium75 and b) there was no contact between Mycenaean Greek and Balkan Phrygians, wanax must be dated back to the common Greek and Phrygian times before 2000 B.C. But the Mycenaean period is by no means the only possible time of borrowing; it is much more likely that the borrowing took place around the 8th century B.C., when the Phrygians had cultural and matrimonial relations with the Greeks.7 The Old Phrygian alphabet resembles those of archaic Greek.77 In the Iliad and the Homeric hymns (h. Ven. 112&amp;137), Phrygians and Phrygia are well known. If from the Mycenaean couple wanaxЛawagétas, which recurs in Phrygian, we only find wanax in Homer, this is certainly for metrical reasons,78 since the creticus lagetas is impossible to integrate into hexameter. So from this vantage point, there is no objection against the thesis that Phrygians borrowed wanaxflawagétas in archaic Greek times. Incidentally, the coupling of wanaxAawagétas in the so-called Midas inscription furnishes a very grave objection against a common IE origin of wanax and vanaktei. Researchers have ascertained that in LB wanax and lawagetas have distinct respective functional spheres79 (which obviously correspond to two different persons, one person never bearing both titles). While the wanax functions as the general head of the social organism, the lawagetas only has a specific, inferior charge as commander-in-chief. In light of this evidence, it is likely that such a specific office like that of the lawagetas,80 even if impor- tant, could only emerge within a highly differentiated society, as 75 Eckart Olshausen dates the Phrygian immigration to Anatolia even in the 9th century B.C. (In: DNP vol. 9 (2000), s.v. Phryges, Phrygia, col. 966). 76 Brixhe 1994: 166.

In contrast, in the so- called Midas inscription this king is addressed with both titles. It is more likely that the Phrygians took over the high-sounding titles without really having a reason for such a differentiation than that the two functions merged in (Proto-)Phrygian and that, despite this, the Phrygians kept two different titles for several centuries. The etymology and semantic of wanax and lawagetas provide a strong argument for this interpretation. Already in Mycenaean times, the etymology and original meaning of wanax were no longer perspicuous. Part of the object of this paper is to show that this term originally referred to 'leader in battle'. This is precisely the meaning of lawagetas, probably formed in Mycenaean times (at least its original meaning was still perspic- uous at that stage of language). It is, however, quite unlikely that the additional (and probably supplementary) emergence of the latter term took place in Phrygian independently and still ac- cording to the same pattern as in Greek. So the different distri- bution of wanax and lawagetas as titles in the two languages and the two words' coexistence can best be explained by this seman- tic and etymological model, and provide at the same time an important reason for it. Even if one does not accept the meaning 'leader in battle' for wanax, the different degree of etymological perspicuity of the two titles and their different social distribution supply strong arguments against a parallel common IE origin. However, in this field, no argumentation is absolutely cogent. One could still have recourse to the thesis that only lawagetas was taken over into Phrygian and added to the inherited wanax. But how is one to explain that the presumed inherited word and its Greek cousin are like two peas in a pod, whereas lawagetas had to change to lavagtaei?81 The use of wanax in another Phry- gian word, modrovanak (M-04), probably a title (e.g. viceroy) or an anthroponym (cf.

In any case, given the identity even in the case form of the dative singular of the LB wa-na-ka/ke-te wanaktei and Phrygian vanaktei, a possible Ш etymon will explain both words, whatever their precise relation may be (the chronology of attestation excludes the possibility, however, that the word was taken over from Phrygian into Mycenaean). 3. Tokharian Relatives? For a common IE etymon, there are still two candidates from a much more distant language, i.e. Tokharian В ñakte A ñkat 'god' and nätäk 'lord'. Tokharian В ñakte A ñkat 'god' was first suggested by Evald Lidén.84 Pedersen85 is sometimes quoted as if he had rejected or definitively refuted this explanation.86 In reality he calls Lidén' s etymology "an sich lautlich bedenklich" [per se debatable from a phonetic standpoint]. His objection is closely embedded in his own particular, quite speculative ar- gumentation: Pedersen discusses several reasons (diachronic- phonetic, synchronie: human vs. non-human) why some words in Tokharian have a form in the oblique case different from the nominative. He argues that Tokh. A ñkat would be all right if the word had been a neuter, which however would contradict Lidén' s hypothesis.87 This argumentation is however as highly sophisticated as it is speculative. Tokh. В has a distinct oblique case näkte-m. Since in both dialects nouns for relatives have no 83 So Brixhe 1990: 75. Hajnal 1998: 65 n. 72 only indicates these words in his plea for a common IE origin of the Phrygian and Greek words for wanax. In a message ["meddelande"], mentioned by Nordling 1929: 72. «51941:44n.l. 86 E.g. by Winter 1979: 53. Tokharian В ñakte A ñkat 'God' is refused by Frisk I 103 with reference to Pedersen. 8/1941:44n.l.</page><page sequence="19">250 Lothar Willms -m,88 it is more plausible to assume that Tokh. A ñkat lost the mark of the oblique case by analogy with this semantically close class (both imply an emotional, social and often authoritative relation) than to suppose that in Tokh. В an original neuter switched to masculine.89 So we are left to consider the phonetic development. Pedersen refrains from devoting a full discussion to this matter, unfortunately only commenting on it in the quite ambiguous terms quoted above. He seems to suggest that, from this point of view, a common origin of wanax and Tokharian В ñakte A ñkat 'god' could be taken into consideration. The initial loss of w before n can be correlated with *wL &gt; L in Tokharian.90 And unlike Tokh. nätäk 'lord' (see below) В ñakte A ñkat 'god' has the same order of к and t as wanax, known from the first attestation in LB (wa-na-ka/ke-te). The strongest argument against Tokharian В ñakte A ñkat 'god' are the alternative IE etymologies, suggested by van Windekens. Regarding В ñakte A ñkat 'god', it was, in his view, not always the same. First, he proposed with apparent hesitation skr. náka 'heaven' ("peut- être") (1941: 76). Later he proposed a new etymology for В ñakte A ñkat 'god', viz. IE *nekto-s (cf. lat. nactus) going back to IE *enek- which figures in Greek enegkeîn, Old Indian ašnoti (only Vedic) 'arrive, reach' and nášati 'reach, attain', lit. nesù, OCS nesq. 'carry' Tokh. A ents-, В enk- 'seize, take, keep'. Thus В ñakte A ñkat 'god' originally would mean 'he who reaches, obtains, makes one reach, attain' (1976: 326 f.). Semantically, this etymology is on the same level as the common origin with wanax: Both imply a superior position of the deity with regard to the human being. But van Windekens' derivation is phoneti- cally less complicated and has more IE relatives. 88 For the distribution of Tokh. -m cf. Krause, Thomas 1960: 108. Pedersen 1941: 44. Such a change of gender happened to Germanic god as Pedersen indicates. 90Cf.Pinaultl989:54f.</page><page sequence="20">On the IE Etymology of Greek (w)anax 25 1 The second Tokharian candidate for a common Ш origin with Greek wanax is nätäk 'lord'.91 It is suggested with some caution by Winter, who advocates Pedersen's rejection of В ñakte A nkät. At first glance, Winter seems to have a striking argument for his suggestion, namely Tokh. naši 'lady', which in his opinion looks like the exact formal and semantic equivalent of Greek anassa. However, van Windekens explicitly rejects this link and shows that the original form *nätkyä, also in his eyes the feminine of nätäk, was influenced by the analogy of the semantically close word asi 'nun' (1976: 312 f.). Moreover, the reconstruction of a stringent etymon for both the Tokharian word and wanax encounters some problems. Though the loss of the initial w could be explained like in В ñakte A ñkat (see above), the appearance of the first a in Greek cannot be explained from the IE etymon *wnh2tk, as Winter supposes. But here one might think, as does Szemerényi 1979: 217, of a syllabic n. However, the different order of к and t in Tokharian and Greek remains a problem for the IE etymon *wnh2tk. Winter recalls the inversion tiktô &lt; *titko and, in my opinion, the analogy of stems like nykt- and galakt- in Greek might indeed have favoured the inversion of t and к in *wnli2tk in Greek. But such an inversion cannot be reconciled with the most plausible etymological segmentation (see below), which suc- ceeds in giving wanax a meaning, which Winter fails to do. Thus reconstructing a common form is obviously more difficult than in the case of В ñakte A ñkat 'God.' Moreover, van Winde- kens has proposed another convincing IE etymology for nätäk which, unlike В ñakte A ñkat 'God', he has upheld throughout all the phases of his research.92 91 1970: 53 f. IE *net- "se courber en signe de révérence, soulager" also transmitted in the Germanic words Old Anglo-Saxon (ge)nãtha "aide, faveur", Old Isl. nãd "grâce, miséricorde" and got. пфап "soulager" for nätäk 'Lord' (1941: 73). Later he explicitly rejects Winter's suggestion and adds Tokh. AB nätk- "soutenir, appuyer" as relative for nätäk 'Lord' (1976: 313).</page><page sequence="21">252 Lothar Willms 4, Szemerényť s Etymology and the Meaning of *wen- The Tokharian link has since completely vanished from the considerations of research. Oswald Szemerényi had called Winter's proposal in a review "very attractive",93 but he objects that Winter says nothing about the structure of wanax. Five years after dealing with Winter's etymology, Szemerényi dis- missed the Tokharian hypotheses in a footnote94 with reference to van Windekens' recent work (1976), advancing his own hypothesis.95 His own reconstruction, *wen-ag-t- or *wn-ag-t- ("акт looks like ау-т"), is phonetically not too far from Winter's *wnli2kt, but he is able to give this consonant cluster a plausible segmentation and a convincing meaning, viz. IE *wen- 'kin', 'tribe' + the verbal root ay- 'to lead' + agent-suffix -t.96 Thus wanax is formed exactly like lat. sacer-dõs, dõ-t-is 'priest', Ol pari-ksit- cf. Gr. nepiKiíxaç 'who lives around' and OI pathi-pf- t- 'road-builder'. These endocentric compounds whose referent is identical with the second element, a verbal root that someti- mes takes -t-, are called determinative compound, "verbales De- terminativkompositum" or "verbales Rektionskompositum".97 Szemerényi' s etymology is by no means a creatio ex nihilo. Already Meringer 1926: 114 n. 5 had speculated that -t- was the formant of an agent noun, but rejected this hypothesis because of the alternative form ánakes. Without hesitation, Puh vel 1956: 206 f. had identified t with the IE noun formant and indicated nyx and gala as parallel cases. Already in 1915, Eduard Schwy- 93 1974: 179. 94 1979: 216 n. 36. ^ 1979: 215-7. 1979: 217. Szemerényi does not discuss the date of formation of his *wen-ag-t- nor the IE form of its second component which he even gives in alphabetical Greek or as *ag-, considering his scepticism towards the laryn- gal theory (cf. 1990: 139) and tendency towards monolaryngalism (cf. 1990: 147 f.). Nevertheless, his etymology is valid because the (Proto-)Greek forms he posits can be deduced according to well known phonetic rules from *ag- or *h2(e)g-. For the classification and the examples cf.

But Schwyzer failed in identifying the second part, which he derived from kt- 'to possess, to acquire' (gr. ktáomai).99 Szemerényi' s idea of identifying the second element with ag- was perhaps inspired by the segmentation of Puh vel' s reconstructed form *wan-ak-(t)- (1956: 215) (at least Szemerényi quotes Puhvel's100 reconstruction *wn-n-nk(t)- 'not subject to doom'). But all in all, for its phonetic and semantic plausibility, Szemerényi' s derivation can be considered a break- through in the search for the etymology of wanax. This is confirmed by the parallel finding or tacit adoption of his view in further discussion of the topic. For although Szemerényi repeat- ed his thesis two years later in a shortened form,101 in 1984, the Bulgarian scholar Georgiev published the same derivation (*wn- heg-t-s) in IF, with some additional parallels for derived nouns with t like phôs 'man', thês, heílôs (quoted from Schwyzer 1939: 499), without referring to his Fribourg colleague at all (126). In any case, Georgiev's article clearly bolsters Szemeré- nyi' s view through both iteration and further argumentation. Hajnal 1998: 66 explicitly asserts that the interpretation of wanax as such as Szemerényi proposes is sound. Only Haudry rejects Szemerényi' s etymology completely and proposes his own, confirming, however, at least that the first part of wanax belongs to a stem *wen-.102 Since the French researcher's own etymology is unsound, we shall discuss it before considering his objections against Szemerényi which will further the discussion. Haudry does not regard wanax as a com- pound, but rather like van Windekens 1948: 279 f. derives it 98 86 n. 1. In 1939: 499 he thought that anax might be of foreign origin ("Fremd FavaK(x)-?") without explicitly abandoning his prior explanation. He was however followed by two Italian researchers (s. note 5 of this oaoer). 100 1956: 212 f. 1UI 1981:321-323. 102 1996: 52-54.</page><page sequence="23">254 Lothar Willms from only one stem, viz. the vocative ana &lt; *w(e)nH- 'friend', 'master-friend'. This single stem served as base for the further cases which were formed in an enlargement following the analo- gy with gala, gálaktos/gálaki. This manner of completing the paradigm would also explain the alternation of forms with and without -t (1996: 53 f.). It is quite possible that the two stems of wanak(t)- are due to interference with gala, gálaktos/gálaki, but the provenance of -ak(t) in wanak(t)- is certainly better explain- ed by Szemerényi, since the formation of a whole paradigm from a vocative presupposes also that Haudry's semantic identification of *w(e)nH- as 'friend', 'master-friend' in wanax is right. There are three objections Haudry directs against Szemerényi (1996: 53): The least convincing one is the semantic-mythologi- cal: 'Chief of a large family' would not fit for the celibate Dioscures. But their name anakes is attested quite late in Dorian Sparta and not in LB. So this use is certainly not relevant for an etymology belonging to a time long prior to this. More pertinent is his morphological argument: Apart from the obscure damar, dámartos 'wife,' all Greek compounds enlarged with -t have the accent on the second element (a-gno-t-). However, Chantraine 1968: 265 f., whom Haudry refers to, restricts himself to nouns with the negation prefix a- or prepositions for Homeric lan- guage, only citing compounds with content words constituting the first part from post-Homeric literature. In this light, damar is a pertinent parallel for wanax, since they are both examples of compound words whose stem ends in t, whose etymology is difficult to discern, and which are accentuated on the first syllable - this perhaps in analogy with the simple words in t which have the accent on the first syllable (e.g. heflôs) and because their character as compound words was obscured in prehistoric times. Haudry's third and strongest objection is a semantic one: Nowhere does a derivation from IE *wenH- or *wenH-i- stand for the wider family denoted by the stem *gen- as in gr. génos or</page><page sequence="24">On the Ш Etymology of Greek (w)anax 255 lat. genti-.103 However, Szemerényi had postulated wen- 'family, tribe' also in lat. vindex and Veneti (*wen-et- 'member of the clan').104 For the latter, Devoto' s definitions 'conquerors, rulers' or 'beloved'105 quoted by Szemerényi106 are equal rivals and Szemerényi' s explanation of vindex *weni-dik-s 'he who points out a member of the clan' is not as self-evident as he suggests.107 Szemerényi himself emphasizes that for phonetic reasons vindex cannot be derived directly from *wen- 'clan', but only from *weni- 'member of the clan'. Therefore vindex is no striking parallel to wanax because both are compounds with a verbal stem occupying the second part, whereas in wanax the first part is *wen-, not *weni- as in vindex. Besides, for the first part of lat. vindex, according to Haudry 1996: 67, other explanations must be considered than Szemerényi' s *wenH-.109 Even if Szemerényi were right in guessing *weni- in vindex, this would by no means prove the existence of *wen- 'clan', since it is quite possible that the Celtic and Germanic forms of *weni- 'member of the clan' (and perhaps also lat. *weni-dik-s) are directly derived from *wen- 'to like, to love' without an intermediary *wen- 'clan'. Thus it is very unlikely that only Greek wanax preserved *wen- 'clan', which turns out more and more to be a mere phantom of reconstruction. So if the meaning of the first element *w(e)nH- is not 'clan', what is it then? This question obviously requires a wider discussion concerning the extensive semantic of this root.

But the verbal stem *wen- and its direct derivatives display an amazing semantic variety: Old Indian vánati 'he desires, loves, gains, wins', Young Aw. vanadi 'he wins', AV van- 'übertreffen, gewinnen, siegen' (to surpass, win, prevail), vantar 'winner', Germanic *wenn-a- 'sich bemühen' (to strive) (Got., OHG winnan et al.). Pokorný 1959: 1146 f. is able to embrace these various nuan- ces in a diachronic development. For him the original meaning is 'strive for' which gave 'to like, to love, be satisfied', 'to struggle, have pain ["sich anstrengen, Mühe haben"]' and in perfective aspect 'reach, win'.110 But following Goto 1987: 283- 6, Martin Kümmel separates *wen- 'überwältigen, gewinnen' (to overcome, to win) from *wenH 'liebgewinnen' (to become fond of),111 whereas Mayrhofer 1976: 141 writes explicitly that the forms of these two verbal meanings belong to one group, and also lists both meanings for vanóti in the RV.112 But Goto proves that only vánate means 'to love', 'to like' (1987: 283 f.) and that vanóti resp. vanu- - if a meaning can be clearly discerned - means 'to defeat', 'to overwhelm' in the RV (1987: 283). So it is clear that already in RV (and also in the Germanic languages113) -n(e)u served to differentiate the meaning 'to defeat', 'to overwhelm' from 'to love', 'to like', very likely because both meanings coincided in one segment (cf. AV vantar 'winner' and Germ, winnan). Therefore the two roots Goto assumes are hardly provable, and he himself does not exclude the possibility that they joined in some forms (1987: 285 f.). The coherence of the semantic development (or enlargement) which Pokorný and Graßmann sketch clearly speaks against a dissocia- 110 Already Graßmann 1873: 1204 sketched this semantic development. For him, the starting point and original meaning was 'being orientated towards sth.'. 111 In Rix 1998: 622. Kümmel joins -H with this meaning (Pokorný gives a stem *иеп/*иепэ). Mayrhofer 1976: 141. Monier- Williams 917 is not clear in this point. 11J Rix 1998: 622.</page><page sequence="26">On the IE Etymology of Greek (w)anax 257 tion into two roots. Only from the meaning 4o love', 'to like' is the semantic development to 'friend', 'kinship' possible, another argument for the priority of this verbal meaning which, moreover, alone can explain the parallelism of 'to win', 'to make an effort' and 'friend' in the Germanic languages (separating these two spheres of meaning into two independent roots is unlikely for the coherence of the semantic evolution of *wen- we have sketched). So we can conclude that in IE times, when wanax was formed, the root *wen- was conceived with the two meanings 1) 'to like', 'to love' 2) 'to strive for' (which has an intermediary status), 'to make an effort, 'to fight', 'to win'. There are several reasons to assume that the formation of wanax implied the second meaning of *wen-. Regarding the first meaning, it is difficult to guess from the blunt stem *wen- that beloved persons are specifically intended (on welcome things see below). The best proof lies in the Ш languages themselves; Celtic and Germanic use a special derivation in -y for 'friend', 'tribe'. But there is nothing to suggest that this derivation is not a special development in the extreme west of the region of IE languages (and perhaps lat. vindex). Even Szemerényi postulates *wen- 'tribe' only in Veneti (which is doubtful) and wanax (which has yet to be proved). Therefore even the existence of a noun based on wen- and referring to persons to whom one has emotional or ethnic ties is quite doubtful for the prehistoric and pre-Mycenaean times when the formation of wanax took place. The second meaning, however, 'to make an effort, 'to fight', 'to win', is quite unproblematic. It can immediately be under- stood in compounds on the basis of the blunt root (making it superfluous to look for a noun *wen- 'strive', 'battle') and en- joys a vaster diffusion than 'tribe', 'friend', 'relative', for it is not only attested in Germanic languages (with various diachro- nic shifts of meaning), but also in both Aryan branches. Thus as an original meaning of wanax we can assume 'leader in the battle' or 'somebody who leads to victory' (already Georgiev and prior researchers had assumed "Siegesführer" [i.e. "leader to</page><page sequence="27">258 Lothar Willms victory"]114). I would like to draw attention to the fact that the original semantic of *ag-/h2eg-115 'to drive', 'to lead', which is found in most and certainly in the oldest attestations,116 very likely implies an animate object (even the intransitive Old Indian pftanaj- 'going to battle'). There are no problems in identifying this implicit animate object in the case of the compound *w(e)nakts with the respective combatants. So the logical and semantic structure of the composition of wanax differs slightly from the recent lawagétas and stratêgós, which share with wanax the second member (*ag-/h2eg-) and in which, however, the first member clearly indicates an animate object.117 The date of the formation of *w(e)nakts (this is the form of wanax which I shall posit for the pre-Mycenaean stage, fol- lowing Szemerényi's suggestion *wen-ag-t- or *wn-ag-t-) or *u(e)n-h2(e)g-t-s as the earliest possible form which one might reconstruct, must be quite early, possibly in common IE times or close to them, at least when *wen-, which otherwise left no traces in Greek, was still in use. The athematic formation of this noun is - in comparison with the originally thematic formations lawagétas and stratêgós118 - a clear argument for its age. At that time, nikáô had not yet attained its specific meaning.119 The fact 114 1984: 126. Already Schwyzer 1915: 86 n. 1 and Pisani 1930: 176, 180 had opted for this meaning of *wen-. 115 Pokorný 1959: 4 f. For the second form cf. M. Kümmel in Rix 1998: 227. Intransitive rection which is found in ON, Old Cymbrian and already in Greek is explained by the implication or omission of the object (M. Kümmel in Rix 1998: 228). This constellation is, however, no compelling argument for seeing also in *wen- a collective noun, namely the tribe or clan; firstly, as we saw, this word is a phantom; secondly, the semantic of *wen- as a verbal root is quite solid (see above). These reasons, directly deduced from the root in question, i.e. *wen-, prevail over the argument by analogy with other compounds. Moreover, Old Indian prtanaj- 'going to battle' whose first component also has a semantic of fight and whose second is *ag-/h2eg- provides a clear parallel for the tvpe of composition for which wanax stands. According to Szemerényi 1971: 305, in lawagétas the original -agos, a formation which is also found in Avestan and Sanskrit, changed to -ägetäs in analogy with such nouns as woikétas, etc. liy Cf.

It fits well into the glottochronology that both Greek (wanax) and Hittite (t/labarnas), which are attested as the first individual IE languages, yield a word for 'chief, 'king' that is different from the common IE *rex, which is reconstructed from several, quite distant languages (lat. rëx, Irish ri, Gall, -nx, 01 raj- and maybe thrac. Rhësos)121 and derived from a stem *li3reg- 'to stretch'.122 The Greek verb orégomai kept this mean- ing, whereas the semantic of lat. rego shifted in correlation with the noun - another argument for an early separation of Greek in the development of a semantic field of leadership. Besides, unlike Indian räj- and Roman rëx, the Greek kingdom from Homer onwards bears no godlike character.123 Societies which preserved the IE word for 'chief, 'king', such as in India and Rome, were quite conservative, as is particularly evident in their maintenance of a strong priestly class.124 Whether, when and why Proto-Greek lost IE *rëx is a matter of pure speculation. But the emergence of new titles and functions in Greek corre- sponds exactly to the social125 and mythological126 change that obscures the evidence of Dumézil' s three functions (religion, warfare, fertility). Therefore we can only guess that, like the 120 Pokorný 1959: 888. 121 Benveniste 1993: 300 f. 122 Cf. Kümmel in Rix 1998: 270 f. 123 Benveniste 1993: 314 f. 124 Benveniste 1993: 300, 310. 125 Benveniste 1993: 310. 126 Dumézil 1958: 58 f.</page><page sequence="29">260 Lothar Willms basileus,127 the *w(e)nakts emerged as a leader from the mem- bers of the warrior class during the migrations into the historical seats which shook the foundations of traditional Greek society. As soon as wanax, due to both phonetic development and the disappearance of *wen-, was no longer understood in terms of its etymological background, its further development was only restricted by the traditional meaning 'leader', 'chief. Therefore, even a godlike position or priestly function, which some scho- lars postulate for the wanax in Mycenaean times, would not contradict the etymology we developed. This period is worth a closer look, since it offers the first attestation of wanax. The social dimension of this word displayed great dynamics in palatial times because the function of the head of the state kept pace with the differentiation of Mycenaean society. The king or chief had a greater need for representation to justify his position (cf. the king of the Achaemenid Empire, where the new political situation even led to an altogether new term).128 But he was still at the head of the military hierarchy as Ruijgh 1999: 523 points out with regard to KN Vd 73 and 136, documents ignored by Palaima, who calls the evidence for the wanax' s concern for warfare "minimal".129 The Mycenaean tablets show clearly that the position of the wanax was so firm that his original military function could be relegated to the lawagétas. This transfer was probably possible thanks to the religious aspects which the authority of the Mycenaean wanax certainly implied, though sometimes researchers overestimate these when making them the main function of the wanax.130 Ruijgh, for example, considers the principal meaning of wanax at that time not to be king, but rather "souverain divin".131 If (w)ánassa in 127 Cf. Georgiev 1984: 127 PIE *gwhnti-l(e)hú-s &gt; "Kampfes-(Kriegs-) Held". 128 Benveniste 1993: 305. 1995: 129. But he quotes himself new research results that the wanax owned javelins (1995: 130 n. 36). 130 Palaima 1995, Ruijgh 1999. 131 1999: 525.</page><page sequence="30">On the IE Etymology of Greek (w)anax 26 1 Linear B132 and Homer has only a divine aspect, as Ruijgh points out,133 this is simply due to the patriarchal structure of that time, which rendered a political use of (w)ánassa inconceiv- able. The use of wanax for a deity in Linear В (mostly Posei- don)134 and Homeric epics can be explained as a metaphor taken from the social context. In the Linear В tablets, pótnia135 is a clear parallel for this semantic development. Besides this, there are many examples of other religions in which the epiclesis 'lord' for a god is a metaphor from the social realm (i.e. of the devotion of the human worshipper). The fact that the wanax makes the richest sacrifices136 does not mean that he has a reli- gious or even priestly function, but that in the competition of prestige which sacrifice implies he has a paramount position, be it by privilege, obligation, or ambition (or all of these). Similar- ly, the fact that only he underwent an initiation (mu-i-me-no)137 whose religious implication we can guess from the later mean- ing of this verb and its derivations (myéô, mystês, etc.), does not necessarily mean that he had a priestly function,138 but only implies a singularly privileged position in Mycenaean society. This is confirmed by his te-me-no, which is three times as large as that of the lawagétas.139 Thus the collective evidence of the tablets urges us to believe that the wanax even represented the foremost position within the hierarchy at the top of Mycenaean society, one which also implied certain religious aspects. Therefore, Hooker's extreme scepticism as to a paramount position of the wanax140 seems to be unjustified, though it could have suggested a more careful approach to the (re)construction of the so-called wanax ideology which started only later, some 132 Cf. Ruijgh 1999: 531-534. 133 1999: 525. Cf. Ruijgh 1999: 524 about the famous Pylian Fr series. 135 Cf. Leuven 1979. 135 PY Un 718. PY Un 853 (Talaima 1995: 131). 137 PY Un 2.1-2 (Ruijgh 1999: 523). Medieval kings are a striking example for a religious rite at the begin- ning of the reign which does not imply a mainly religious function. ™ PY Er 312 (Palaima 1995: 131). 14U1979: 101 f., 111.</page><page sequence="31">262 Lothar Willms documents, especially archaeological ones, being a bit hastily declared relevant to this "ideology".141 Hooker is certainly right in pointing out that the tablets do not tell us what the exact 1 АО (administrative) functions of the wanax were, as we would expect for a modern bureaucracy. But although we do not know the exact purport of some actions which are ascribed to the wanax, they reveal him as the focus of social interest (already by the thema-rhema-structure of these sentences) and the subject of actions that have a great relevance even if (or rather just because) they are symbolic rites.143 After all, our look at central tablets protects us from the objection that we might have pro- jected the Homeric meaning of wanax on our interpretation of the Mycenaean evidence.144 We can state that, details aside, both Linear В and Homer use the word wanax for individuals who occupy a paramount position - be it in a social pyramid or as anthropomorphic gods. For our purposes, it is not necessary to explain this fundamental agreement. Researchers are right in pointing out that after the end of the palatial period, which also brought about the disappearance of the wanax as the head of an elaborate social pyramid, the former regional qa-si-re-u became independent and could assume the role of kings.145 But it is a bit hasty to conclude from the disappearance of the wanax' s social position that the use of this word ceased too.146 In any case, the parallel use of wanax for both kings and gods in Linear В and Homer suggests that the word survived in the epics and it is in 141 Palaima's identification of the wanax on the frescoes of the Pylos megaron is at least based on a common element of painting and tablets (sacri- fice of a bull, 1995: 132 f.), but his interpretation of a male figure on the thro- ne as wanax (1995: 134) is only dictated by the ideas on the wanax' para- mount position. Kilián 1988 and Wright 1995 suggest a very interesting inter- pretation of the archaeological evidence, but they pay little attention to the question whether the attempts of representation by artefacts and architecture they describe were really undertaken by a person whose title was 'wanax'. 142 1979: 102. 143 This focalisation is pointed out by Palaima 1995: 133. This objection is made by Palaima 1995: 131 to open the way for his religious interpretation. 145 Carlier 1984: 506 f. 140 Ruijgh 1999: 528.</page><page sequence="32">On the IE Etymology of Greek (w)anax 263 accordance with the original meaning of wanax that we have reconstructed 'leading in(to) battle,' which can very well be the starting point of a semantic evolution towards 'king', 'god'. In all three stages the wanax retains his authoritative position. 6. Old Indian vaniy 'merchant9? In the light of these results we can widen our perspective and face the most recent attempt of etymology of (w)ánax. Haj nal places it alongside ved. vaníj- 'merchant', presupposing Salvato- re Scartata' s oral derivation of this word from *un-h2ag- (resp. *u9n-h2ag-) 'Güter mitführend, gewinnend' (carrying goods, gaining), whose zero grade variant *un-li2g- would be regulated by analogy as *usn-h2g-.147 One year later, he elaborated this thesis, indicating that Mayrhofer148 proposed (though with some hesitation)149 the same interpretation of the first member (he tacitly adopts Mayrhofer' s view that the n in vaníj- "spontane- ously" had adopted a retroflex articulation before i).150 He, however, interprets -ij differently, namely as a suffix of agent nouns.151 But this -ij is a rare formant seen only in a few, etymo- logically controversial cases. Mayrhofer adduces two other formations, from the zero grade as well, namely us-ij- 'desiring, striving hard' and bhur-ij- 'arm' (lit. 'carrying' &lt; *bher-).152 Wackernagel-Debrunner give us no more examples,153 but 147 1997: 87 n. 152, 1998: 67 f., Irslinger in Wodtko 2008: 270f. mainly adopts his view. Wö 1968: 513f. = 112.

He deduces ušik, ušij- desiring, striving hard' from vasti (vol. 1 1956: 113) 4o desire', 'to wish'. Hajnal 1998: 68. In these two points (viz. interpretation of the first member and spontaneous genesis of retroflex articulation of n before i), Mayrhofer's view is called "the most likely" by Burrow 1972: 545. 1D1 Hajnal 1998: 67. °M968:513f. = 112. 1M 1954: 321 § 204.</page><page sequence="33">264 Lothar Willms assume that this suffix is a cognate of j which seems to go back to IE times (sanáj- ~ lat. senex).154 However, given the proliferation of the suffix -aj, whose examples show no IE parallels,155 it seems still possible that the few words in -ij, whatever the origin of this element may have been in these individual cases, merged, in analogy with the words in -aj, into the small subgroup -ij within the large family of nouns in -(a)j. Even the zero grade, which all three words have in common, is no argument that all words belonged to this group from the time of their very emergence, though it is still possible that the zero grade of *un-li2g- favoured the analogical merger with the other words to a subgroup of the rich j -family. Be that as it may, the interpretation of -ij from Ii2(e)g does meet with grave semantic problems, not only ('bringing-leading'?) in bhur-ij-, if the etymology from *bher- favoured by Mayrhofer is right1 6), but also in vanij-, since the semantic of Ii2(e)g demands an animate object157 which cannot be reasonably placed in the syntagma 'bringing goods'. A merchant brings goods to people. We can only save this etymology if we suppose that in early times, when the meaning 'merchant' was applied to vanij-, the main trading good was cattle (cf. lat. pecunia from pecus), but there the archaeological evidence points merely to portable items like salt and amber, and it is moreover very unlikely that 154 1954: 547 § 407. lDD Wackernagel-Debrunner 1954: 152 § 55. 150 vol.

The opposition of *bher- and *h2(e)g- is striking in Linear В and Homer where these two verbs are coupled together and where *bher- is used for objects or things that do not touch the soil and *h2(e)g- for animate beings that can walk on their own (cf. the examples in Brewer 1984: 129 f.: Docs2 Nr. 172 do-ra-qe ре-re po-re-na-qe a-ke; II. 23,512 f. ошке Ô' cxyeiv [...] yuvaiKoc / Kai xpírcoô' [...] (pépeiv; Od. 4,622 oï 5' fjyov, cpépov ô' eufjvopa oîvov).

In Oír. the connection of agat with cattle and of berat with women is easy to explain. There were two plausible reasons for holding women aloft while carrying them off in a raid: their eventual resistance, because unlike cattle they certainly realized that something wrong was happening, and precaution on the part of the plunderer who wanted to prevent his prey from causing or sustaining harm during this dangerous operation.</page><page sequence="34">On the IE Etymology of Greek (w)anax 265 cattle-breeding tribes would label goods they probably exported themselves as if brought to them by a merchant. These semantic aporias of the second member Ii2(e)g exclude an IE kinship of vanij- and wanax, whose second member is to be derived from Ii2(e)g (both words have in common only the first member, though probably with a different meaning). This hypothesis of derivation, moreover, faces two further grave difficulties; to these we turn now for the sake of completeness. Hajnal only states that vanij- and wanax, wanaktos differ in the final t of the stem.158 This could be correlated to the fact that the restriction of the suffix t to stems in i, u, j* (n, m), which OI displays, is considered secondary.159 Ved. sa-yúj- 'united' (cf. Gr. sú-zug- and lat. con-iug- 'husband', 'wife') might have been a model that favoured the loss of t after j. But nak 'night', the phonetically closest relative with к before t, keeps the t through- out flexion. Later derivations from Ii2eg- without t in Old Indian, e.g. prtanaj- 'going to battle' (with lengthening in composition), samäjah 'Versammlung, Gesellschaft' [gathering, society]160 are no pertinent parallels, since for them the derivation from Ii2eg- is still perspicuous and since such types occur also in Greek (e.g. la(wa)gétas and stratêgós). Secondly, we would meet at first glance with some socio- semantic difficulties in integrating vanij- 'merchant' and wanax 'lord'. The Mycenaean wanax is at the top of society and our *w(e)nakts is in at least some way related to the warrior class, whereas the humble vanij- belongs only to the third class. The first three attestations of vanij- in Vedic literature161 are quite obscure, but I have no reasons to doubt that Mayrhofer is right in supposing for them the recent meaning 'merchant'.162 The epiclesis of Indra in the merchant song of AV 3,15,1 as vanij - might be seen as a relict of IE times, when a deity was consid- 158 1998: 68. 159 Wackernagel-Debrunner 1954: 47.

This hypothesis of a very early Ш stage would not only integrate vanij- and wanax, but also Tokharian В ftäkte A ñkat 'God'. However, as Bergaigne pointed out, the epiclesis of Indra as vanij- is to be explained by mythological ideas163 and the pos- sible intratextual reasons for invoking a god as merchant in a merchant's prayer are much more plausible than our PIE specu- lations. Thus, though probably having in common the first component and eventually also the second, wanax and vanij- do not have a common etymology. 7. Conclusion In sum, as the results of our discussion we can state that at present there are no serious objections against an IE etymologi- cal segmentation of wanax as *wen- + *ag- 'to lead' + agent- suffix -t, as was found by Szemerényi and adopted by Georgiev and Hajnal, who classified *un-h2ág-t- (which we have posited in its oldest form as *u(e)n-ti2(e)g-t-s) as an endocentric (verbal) determinative compound ("verbales Rektionskompositum"). Whatever the precise etymological relation of Phrygian vanaktei to the Greek word may be (this paper tends towards a post- palatial borrowing by the Phrygians), this etymology is valid for these two nouns. Moreover, for both the Greek and Phrygian word, the same meaning of the first member of the compound we discussed in this paper does fit. The plausibility of other IE cognates varies in relation to the meaning presupposed for the first member. But there are good reasons for interpreting *wen- as 'strive, battle', which leads to the conclusion that the wanax originally was a military leader. While this semantic of *wen- is one of the major obstacles to other IE cognates, like Old Indian vanij- 'merchant' and Tokharian В ñakte A ñkat 'God', it is easy 163 II 480.</page><page sequence="36">On the IE Etymology of Greek (w)anax 267 to reconcile with the historical use of this word in Greek. For when its origin was obscured, its use could freely develop from the meaning '(military) leader, chief, which easily explains the use for kings and gods in Linear В and the Homeric epic.
