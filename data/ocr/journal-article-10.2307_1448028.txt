McDiarmid and Ronald Altig (eds.). 1999. University of Chicago Press, Chi- cago, Illinois. ISBN 0-226-55762-6. xiv, 444 p., 118 halftones, 181 line drawings, 23 tables. $70.00 (cloth). "All science is either physics or stamp-collect- ing" (Ernest Rutherford, 1871-1937). At any moment on this planet the most com- mon anuran life form is likely a tadpole, not a frog. Tadpoles, of course, are shorter lived than frogs. But the typical anuran life history, with large clutches and high mortality at or before metamorphosis, pretty well assures that the si- lent tadpoles and not the raucous frogs will make up the masses in the anuran world. From that argument alone, tadpoles have long de- served major recognition by herpetologists. Fi- nally, with this book they get it. The layout of Tadpoles is formal, fancy, and encyclopedic in a fashion that is guaranteed to make this a very valuable reference book for years to come. Tadpoles has, for example, a glos- sary, which includes many technical terms used in tadpole anatomy, physiology, and taxonomy. There are both subject and author indices. Best of all, the book lists approximately 1400 refer- ences, many of which are sufficiently old and obscure that they are not likely to come up in computer literature searches. The Literature Cited section is not completely free of errors but very close. Based on the number of typo- graphical errors in citations to my own papers, approximately 97% of the citations in Tadpoles are clean. That is very good. Like this review, each chapter in Tadpoles starts with a quote. I admire this literary pre- tense, although the prefatory quotes selected for Tadpoles state rather mundane truisms. Ex- cept for one by Kermit the Frog, all are quite dry. Collectively they convey the impression that the editors want tadpoles to be taken seriously, and I cannot fault them on that. Four of the 12 chapters in Tadpoles are written solely by the editors: the Introduction, a chapter on research methods, one on the tadpole body plan, and a final one on tadpole diversity. McDiarmid and Altig also coauthored with oth- ers the chapter on behavior, and Altig contrib- uted to yet another chapter (see below). Given the extent to which the editors were also au- thors, their mark can be felt throughout the book. Thus, although multiauthored, Tadpoles has a fairly unified philosophy. The book's greatest strengths and weaknesses can be found in chapters scripted by Altig and McDiarmid. After their Introduction, McDiarmid takes the lead in the second chapter, titled Research: Materials and Methods. There is much good counsel in this chapter on how to raise, fix, pre- serve, store, and even observe tadpoles. How- ever, there is also much that is missing. The chapter has a singularly museological focus, which is, of course, not surprising considering the authors' longtime association with natural history institutions. Laboratory-based biologists will be surprised to see only half a line on anes- thetizing tadpoles (p. 19). Much is said about how to photograph and illustrate tadpoles. Dark-field illumination is discussed indirectly but not called that. Fluorescence microscopy is not mentioned at all. Given the lengthy treatise in this chapter on how to photograph tadpoles, it is surprising how inferior the photographs are in chapters by the editors. Figures 3.3G-H, 3.7F, 3.8E, 3.11D, 7.2B, and 9.4 are particularly muddy. It is hard to imagine that pictures of such low contrast and resolution could have gotten by the production staff at the University of Chicago Press, yet they did. On a couple of accounts the publication of such pictures is vexing. First, some of the worst photographs are reprints from previous publi- cations. These include composite photographs that lack standardized orientation and scale bars. They looked bad the first time they ap- peared and no better now. Second, there are some excellent illustrations in chapters by other authors, so the publication of inferior photo- graphs by the editors themselves seems unfair to their guest contributors. In light of their own photographs, the editors must have mustered up some hefty hubris to lecture their readers on how to photograph tadpoles. Altig takes the lead on the next chapter, titled Body Plan: Development and Morphology. Here is where the editors most strongly push their central thesis, which is that the "development and use of standard measurements and descrip- tive terminology ... applicable across all taxa ... [is] ... crucial to fostering good communi- cation" (p. 25). That goal sounds laudable at</page><page sequence="2">1126 COPEIA, 2000, NO. 4 first, but I found the specific terminology cho- sen by Altig and McDiarmid often poorly de- fended and presented with picayune pedantry. Some battles are worth fighting, and others are not. When there are two terms that unambigu- ously mean the same thing, it really does not matter which term one uses. I was saddened to see how much space was taken up in this book over the "right" anatomical terms to use when describing tadpoles. Let me give some examples. Altig and Mc- Diarmid claim that the "anus" is the "posterior opening of the mammalian digestive tract" (p. 33) and thus the "aperture through which feces exit" tadpoles should not be called an anus. They are making this up. According to Web- ster's Dictionary you do not have to be mam- malian to have an anus. But Altig and Mc- Diarmid continue with a discourse about am- phibians having "a common collecting cham- ber-a cloaca-into which the digestive, urinary, and reproductive tracts empty." All well and good, but before a tadpole metamorphoses, what comes out that opening is feces, little or no urine, and certainly not sperm or eggs. As with everyday life and common English, I would claim that good communication is rarely ham- pered and often fostered by calling an anus, an anus. [As a minor aside, the illustration relevant to this anal discussion (Fig. 3.5) has tadpole tails drawn upside down.] Altig and McDiarmid's discussion of the oral disc and keratinized mouthparts of tadpoles goes on for pages. By underillustrating this sec- tion of their book, they have set up a situation where many readers will be frustrated with the text and ignore their recommendations. That might not be bad, if it leads the University of Chicago Press to publish a second edition with more and better illustrations. In any case, Altig and McDiarmid most emphatically do not want us to use the terms "denticles" and "beaks" for the keratinized oral structures of tadpoles. In- stead they prefer the wordier terms "labial teeth" and "jaw sheaths." Because I have never seen or heard of a single case where the terms denticles and beaks have caused any confusion among scientists, or for that matter children, Al- tig and McDiarmid's obsessive concern here seems silly. The problem is even more insidious when one looks in the Glossary. There, denticle is defined as an "unacceptable term that should be discarded ..." This politicizing of the Glos- sary will hardly help tadpole tyros trying to un- derstand the older literature. Perhaps I am pugnacious on this point be- cause I am chastised in this chapter for, to quote Altig and McDiarmid, "confusingly" calling cer- tain papillae in the mouths of tadpoles "oral" rather than "buccal" (p. 35). In my 1980 mono- graph that Altig and McDiarmid cite for this grievous offense, the papillae in question are fully described and labeled on illustrations of the whole buccal cavity. That paper has been cited dozens of times by many different authors from around the world, and no one except Altig and McDiarmid seem confused. It may also be true that my views here are biased by the coun- try where I live. Canada is a bilingual nation where pluralism is considered more a virtue than a vice, and language police cause anxiety. In the next chapter, D. Cannatella takes on the challenge of reviewing the musculoskeletal system of tadpoles (excluding the limbs). This is a particularly difficult task because of the many muscles and skeletal elements at the front end of tadpoles. Those structures allow tadpoles to do elegant, intricate actions with their jaws and branchial apparatus, but they also consti- tute a scary amount of morphology. One gets the impression that several authors in the past, who could not confidently homologize features they saw in one species with those in another, took the easy way out and named structures anew. As a result, the anatomical terminology for the last hundred years has continually grown-and continually grown more incompre- hensible. Cannatella does a masterful job in sorting out this mess. His chapter alone does more to revitalize the field of comparative tad- pole myology than anything written since Edge- worth (1935). The tables in Cannatella's chapter are among the most valuable in the book. There is, for ex- ample, a compilation (Table 4.1) of all of the descriptive literature (up until 1997) on tad- poles' chondrocrania, cranial muscles, and branchial apparatuses! More than a hundred papers are cited here, linked to specific taxa. Another table (Table 4.4), on the "homologies of the muscles of the branchial baskets, as de- scribed by various authors," does much to sal- vage the field. Before reading Cannatella's chapter, I could not imagine encouraging a stu- dent to study the branchial muscles of tadpoles. How and where could they begin to penetrate the turgid, poorly illustrated literature? Now there is an obvious place to start-with this ta- ble. My quibbles with this chapter are minor. In his introductory paragraph (p. 52), Cannatella states that the "reproductive tissue [in tadpoles] lies outside of the body cavity, so reproduction (and thus neoteny) is not possible until meta- morphosis ... when the body cavity enlarges." This anatomical assertion, about where repro-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVEIWS 1127 ductive tissue lies in anurans, is not wholly cor- rect, and I may be to blame for this all too sweeping generalization (Wassersug, 1975). It is more correct to say that most components of the anuran urogenital system are in place be- fore metamorphosis (as demonstrated by Vier- tel and Richter in the next chapter in Tadpoles), but room for eggs to mature or for the bladder to form requires extension of the urostyle and iliac bars at metamorphosis. The bronchial columella of Rana and the bronchial diverticulum of Xenopus are not the same structures, contrary to what is stated on page 61. Curiously neither structure is listed in the Subject Index. On the same page, we are told that at metamorphosis "the infrarostral car- tilages are incorporated into Meckel's carti- lage." However, three pages later we learn that the "mentomeckelian bone ossifies in the me- dial ends of the larval infrarostral cartilage." The latter statement is correct and probably it is better to think of the infrarostrals as derived from, rather than "incorporated" into, Meck- el's cartilage. The statement that in the bullfrog tadpole "closing of the mouth occurs faster than the opening" (p. 82) may not be true dur- ing grazing against resistant substrates. [The ki- nematics of feeding in tadpoles is sorely in need of empirical study.] After Cannatella's contribution, B. Viertel and S. Richter cover the remaining, nonneural morphology of tadpoles. I was originally asked to write this chapter but declined in part be- cause I suspected that others such as Viertel and Richter, who knew the European literature, could do a better job. Their contribution to this volume confirms my suspicion. Viertel and Richter provide an amazingly comprehensive review of tadpole visceral morphology. Unfor- tunately their review comes in at a rather high level and assumes that the reader already knows a lot of morphology. I would have liked to see some more fundamental drawings and intro- ductory level text. In this chapter, few of the 32 figures, two- thirds of which are composite illustrations a half page or more in size, are original. Furthermore the vast majority are either schematic drawings of single organs or organ systems (e.g., the heart, the venous system, etc.) or collections of histological micrographs. Only two figures, one of Rana temporaria and the other of Xenopus lae- vis (both on p. 109), attempt to show most ab- dominal viscera in situ, and these two illustra- tions are rarely referenced in the text. Conse- quently, if one wants to identify a particular or- gan in a tadpole, he or she may struggle to figure it out from this chapter. Here is a real-life example of the problem. Recently a student asked me to identify the small, red, spherical structure that she had found in a Xenopus tadpole on the dorsal wall of its abdomen, near the cranial end of the de- veloping kidneys. It was the spleen. Viertel and Richter tell us that in X. laevis the "spleen an- lage forms at the dorsal mesentery near the an- terior end of the stomach" (p. 97), which is not much topographic guidance. Granted the spleen is labeled as "SPL" in Figure 5.13, but the text on the spleen never directs the reader to that figure, and the key to the abbreviations used in that figure is on a different page than either the text or the figure. I similarly doubt that, if one wanted to find a tadpole's thymus gland, for example, he or she would find "a dorsal, ectodermal ... derivative of the second visceral pouch .. ." (p. 101) to be sufficient ex- planation. What is missing in both the text and figures of Tadpoles is a good gross anatomical overview to help the novice morphologist get oriented. The distressful discovery of deformed Anura dispersed about our planet has created an ur- gent need for easily accessible information on normal tadpole anatomy. Few of the environ- mental toxicologists and parasitologists who are investigating this problem have had much ex- perience looking inside tadpoles. They need guidance. From a more positive perspective, the stunning power of transgenics to reveal which genes in tadpoles are responsible for the differ- entiation of which organs has led to a renais- sance in interest in amphibian organogenesis by developmental biologists. Many of these mod- ern masters of molecular methods, however, have little or no training in amphibian gross anatomy. They need help. As a companion to a pictorial atlas of normal tadpole anatomy, the Viertel and Richter chapter would be of great service to all these scientists. Unfortunately the atlas itself does not exist. M. Lannoo authors the next chapter, on the nervous system. Like so many others in this book, this chapter is an immensely valuable lit- erature review. Unlike Viertel and Richter, Lan- noo does start with the basics. His first illustra- tion shows the whole central nervous system in place, within the silhouette of a tadpole. How- ever, once the chapter gets rolling, anatomical details of nuclei within the brain are occasion- ally presented without much explanation about what those features mean to the workings of a tadpole. Also when the details are not known for tadpoles, Lannoo presents the information for anurans in general, in a way that may lead</page><page sequence="4">1128 COPEIA, 2000, NO. 4 readers to assume common pre- and postmeta- morphic design and function. Lannoo focuses on what we know about the anuran nervous system and says little about what we do not know. I see this as a missed op- portunity to encourage more work in tadpole neurobiology. When he writes, for example, that the "anatomy, development, evolution, and physiology of the anuran auditory system have been well studied ..." my eyebrows go up. It would be more correct, I believe, to say that we know next to nothing about hearing in tad- poles. [Two relevant papers, though, have ap- peared since Lannoo completed his chapter; Boatright-Horowitz and Simmons, 1997; Boat- right-Horowitz et al., 1999.] Judging from the profound transformations that take place outside of the nervous system when a tadpole becomes a frog, we can safely say that many metamorphic changes in the cen- tral nervious system remain unstudied. All that is said about metamorphosis of the nervous sys- tem in Tadpoles is covered in a single paragraph. Admittedly, in his Summary paragraph, Lannoo acknowledges that when it comes to tadpole neurobiology "few taxa have been examined ... [and] there are many variations exhibited even among this small number" (p. 169). That vari- ation is not emphasized in this chapter, howev- er. Nor is the reader directed to where there is the greatest need for more research. A bit of a pity. To leave this chapter on a positive note, I know of no other document that even attempts to review all the literature on tadpole neuro- anatomy. The classic and otherwise encyclope- dic handbook on the frog nervous system by Llinais and Precht (1976) does not discuss larval neural systems in systematic fashion, and that work is now woefully out of date. G. Thibaudeau and R. Altig devote the next chapter to endotrophic anurans; that is, species whose tadpoles (or embryos) derive all their en- ergy needs from "vitellogenic yolk or other pa- rentally produced material." As is the strength of Tadpoles, this chapter starts out with some fab- ulously comprehensive tables. One is a list of all known or suspected anuran genera with endo- trophic development. Another, which runs two and a half pages, summarizes the diverse breed- ing biology of anurans with endotrophic devel- opment. To newcomers interested in direct-de- veloping anurans, this chapter is a great place to begin, although they might also wish to look at Hanken (1999). Another recent and highly relevant update on the topic of the evolution of direct devel- opment is Callery and Elinson (2000). Those authors show that there is much greater thyroid hormone sensitivity and tissue dependence in Eleutherodactylus embryos than previously sup- posed. Eleutherodactylus, it seems, retains a fair bit more than a tadpole's tail as a vestige of its ancestral complex lifecycle. A few statements in this chapter are question- able or at least deserve supporting references that are not provided. I was, for example, sur- prised to read that "pharyngeal slits apparently are absent in all endotrophs" (p. 179), since Szarski (1957) reported open gill slits in Leio- pelma. I have pumped dye into the mouths of preserved Leiopelma larvae, which promptly came out from under their gular folds. I also suspect that the "pharynx" in the statement that "olfactory organs open to the pharynx" was supposed to be either the "buccal cavity," or the "buccopharynx" to use a term from the book's Glossary. One guesses that Thibaudeau and Altig get pleasure out of seeming to be controversial but not so controversial that their position can be easily defined or labeled. Thus, for example, early on they claim that they will present "sev- eral ideas that differ from current dogma" (p. 182). Similarly, they end their chapter (p. 188) with a statement that the development of an- urans "without the quintessential tadpole sug- gested by general dogma is intriguing .... " Yes, it is intriguing, but the dogma is never articu- lated. The fact that many Anura have endotro- phic embryos/larvae is hardly new (see Lutz, 1948) or controversial. The book's own Intro- duction (p. 2) points out that about a quarter of all species are endotrophic. Thibaudeau and Altig are setting up a straw man when they de- clare that tadpoles are perceived to be quintes- sential to anuran development. This chapter does have a handful of neat ideas worthy of further investigation. The au- thors challenge, for example, the belief that big eggs and direct development are obligatorily linked (p. 185). And they are on target when they state (p. 185) that we do not know "how the composition of energy stores ... [in eggs changes] with egg size and what patterns might be most advantageous under any given circum- stances." We can be thankful that people are starting to investigate this problem (e.g., Chip- man et al., 1999). Having said that, I would have liked more of the stray ideas in this chapter to be backed by citations. I suspect that most of the interesting ideas and observations that are not cited come from Altig's extensive experi- ence in the field. Still, it would have been nice to have a few "personal observations" as confir- mation. There is a flip side to how ideas are cited, or</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVEIWS 1129 not, in this chapter and other chapters with Al- tig's name on them. Sometimes when a state- ment is followed by a parenthetical string of ci- tations, it is not clear why those papers are be- ing cited. There are several places where my own papers are referred to (e.g., p. 186, 296), but I am not sure why. An example of an inter- esting observation mentioned in passing with- out citation is that before hatching Eleutherodac- tylus coqui embryos curl their tails preferentially to the left (p. 179). This is, to my knowledge, the first report of behavioral "handedness" in an anuran embryo. But is it true for other en- dotrophs? And might there be biased tail bend- ing in exotrophic embryos as well? If so, is it associated with the left-handed spiracle of most anurans? Conversely, does the predominant di- rection that an anuran holds its tail before hatching correlate with any turning biases after hatching (see Yamashita et al., 2000)? The next chapter, on physiology, richly up- dates the review of amphibian developmental physiology by Burggren and Just in Environmen- tal Physiology of the Amphibians (1992). Respira- tory, thermal and osmoregulatory physiology are discussed sequentially, reflecting the pre- dominant interests of the three authors: G. Ultsch, D. Bradford, and J. Freda. I liked this chapter very much, both for its readable style and because the authors did an exceptionally good job of pointing out what we know and what we do not know about tadpole physiolo- gy-at least for the above-mentioned areas. A major area not covered is digestive physiology. I do not believe that this is an oversight on be- half of the authors but rather a tacit acceptance of our woeful ignorance in this area of tadpole biology. The chapter on behavior profited from hav- ing four authors (K. Hoff, A. Blaustein, and the book editors) to cover the breadth of the field. I read this chapter and the next (on ecology) with my hand planted among the references at the back of the book. I was constantly flipping to the Literature Cited section to check out the multitude of citations to papers I had either never read or had read a long time ago and had forgotten. Hoff et al. start their chapter reviewing mech- anistic behaviors of tadpoles packaged within traditional systems (e.g., feeding, respiration, thermoregulation, locomotion, etc.). This is fol- lowed by a large section on Dispersion and So- cial Behavior and a smaller one on Sensory Abilities and Learning. Of all the chapters in Tadpoles, this one looks the most dated, al- though it includes some references up to 1997. That is not a criticism but rather a testimony to how explosively fast the field of tadpole behav- ior, particularly behavioral ecology, has grown in the last few years (see below). R. Alford's chapter on tadpole ecology comes next. Without too much expansion, this chapter could have been developed into a free-standing book. The literature review here is awesome. Anyone doing anything remotely related to tad- pole ecology will want to have this chapter near- by. Alford's chapter is so voluminous that it would have profited from having more sub- headings. Some information in the text could have been made more accessible if packaged into tables. As currently laid out, summary par- agraphs on important topics often end with a string of supporting references. I typically found myself wondering how those studies, cited in support of a major point, differed in experi- mental design or minor conclusions. Admitted- ly, Alford would have ended up with a book- length manuscript, if he had tried to comment on all of the papers he cites. An alternative might have been to list, in abbreviated fashion within tables, the similarities and differences of cocited studies. I have a few minor criticisms of this chapter. Gill filters are mistakenly called "branchial fil- aments" (p. 243). B. Delidow is called a "he" but is a "she" (p. 249). Also some of the text got garbled by a copy editor, who must have been reading words and not sentences while up- dating taxonomic names. Thus, for example, Al- ford reports on a competition experiment "be- tween Bufo melanostictus and Hoplobatrachus tig- erinus ... [which] failed because the Rana lar- vae consumed many of the Bufo ... ." It helps here to know that Hoplobatrachus tigerinus used to be in the genus Rana. Because several 1998 papers are cited in this heavily referenced chap- ter, it is surprising that a couple of older, major reviews are missing. Two important ones on tad- pole community ecology are Wellborn et al. (1996) and Wilbur (1997). It would not have been possible in the confines of a book chapter to develop a synthesis of tadpole ecology. I feel that Alford hints at one but does not flesh it out. That is just one more reason why he should expand his chapter into a book. The penultimate and most unusual chapter in this book is by R. Harris, titled simply The Anuran Larvae: Evolution and Maintenance. This chapter is less focused than the others on accumulating, compiling, and cataloging previ- ous knowledge. It addresses instead more the- oretical questions and is the most speculative chapter in the book. Harris is interested in how the anuran complex life cycle first evolved. I take some justified criticism in this chapter for gen-</page><page sequence="6">1130 COPEIA, 2000, NO. 4 eralizations that I made a quarter of a century ago about this very topic. Harris suggests that more attention be given to Leiopelma to help us understand how the anuran larval form evolved. Many of the questions he asks are already ame- nable to experimental techniques in molecular genetics or will be so in the next few years. Unfortunately a few bizarre statements in this chapter slipped by the editors. It is not true, for example, that at metamorphosis the anuran nervous system is "largely or completely re- placed" (p. 288). And I was astonished to read that "emetic behavior ... is required for ovi- position and sperm extrusion" in adult anurans (p. 93). Emesis is vomiting, and even frogs can have sex without getting sick to their stomachs! But what is true is that forceful expulsion of ma- terial from either end of an anuran requires a sharp rise in intra-abdominal pressure, which is something that does not seem possible in most anurans before metamorphosis (Naitoh et al., 1989). The piece de resistance of Tadpoles is Altig and McDiarmid's final chapter, Diversity. The essence of this chapter is a 33-page tabulation of tadpole types with a descriptive code and lovely black-and-white line drawings of over 60 morphologically diverse tadpoles in lateral view. This table is the first descriptive summary at the genus level of all known tadpoles. From this time forth, anyone trying to identify a tadpole or describing a new one will want to reference this table. The information compiled in this ta- ble is so useful that it left me wanting more. I would have liked to see all of the genera illus- trated and wish that mouthparts had also been drawn. But that would have made an already huge table gargantuan. In summary, Tadpoles is a great compilation of what we have learned about anuran larvae in the 20th century. Yet I feel that two things are missing from the book. One is an intellectual history of tadpole biology. Tadpoles are exciting organisms in many fields of biology these days. But why? What have been the discoveries or events that have propelled these animals into such prominence? The other thing that is miss- ing is an assessment of tractable questions in tadpole biology that can and should be ad- dressed in coming years. Granted, many individ- ual authors including the editors conclude their chapters with abbreviated epiloges (mislabeled Summaries) in which they make some reference to promising areas for future exploration. But the book itself lacks a concluding chapter, a compass to point us in the right direction. The two areas I feel are missing are closely coupled in that we typically know best where to go once we know where we have been. Below is a bit of what I think should be expanded upon in this regard and then should be included in the next edition of Tadpoles. TADPOLE BIOLOGY IN THE 20TH CENTURY: A HISTORICAL PRImCIS How the broader discipline of tadpole biolo- gy evolved over the 20th century is easily seen in the history of studies in tadpole ecology and behavior. Little was published in either disci- pline in the first two-thirds of the century, and virtually all of that was classic natural history (i.e., descriptions of aggregating behavior in Bufo tadpoles, cannibalism by Scaphiopus larvae, etc.). Elsewhere in the vertebrate world, by the 1960s experimental studies in ecology and be- havior were well underway. The organisms of interest were rodents, birds, even some herps- but not tadpoles. I do not think it unfair to say that to most biologists for most of the 20th cen- tury, tadpoles were wobbly balls of protoplasm collected for the entertainment, if not educa- tion, of children. They were safe for children, viz. they did not bite, but they were not viewed as fully formed organisms. Up until the last third or so of the 20th century, some combi- nation of ignorance and anthropomorphism had us equating tadpoles with the toddlers of our own taxon. When I first started attending American So- ciety of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists meet- ings, around 1970, there were few talks on am- phibian larvae and none on their ecology or behavior. The "real" herpetologists (i.e., "adult" herpetologists) studied adult organ- isms. Because adult organisms had to breed, they also had conspicuous behaviors. Larvae did not breed; thus, they were assumed to have few behaviors of elegance or interest. Paradoxically, this erroneously simplistic view of tadpoles, I believe, made them appealing or- ganisms for studies in community ecology. In the early 1970s, H. Wilbur, first at the University of Michigan and then at Duke University, began using replicated artificial enclosures with intro- duced amphibian larvae to study factors affect- ing community structure in aquatic environ- ments. Wilbur was not the first to attempt this sort of experiment, but he was the first to mas- ter the protocol and the statistical methods for cleanly running such "mesocosm" experiments. Wilbur and his students used this experimental protocol with vigor throughout the 1970s and 1980s to study amphibian food webs, inter- and intraspecific competition, density effects on metamorphosis, etc. In so doing, they made tad-</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVEIWS 1131 poles model organisms in community ecology (reviewed in Wilbur, 1997). Personally I do not feel these early studies in experimental community ecology with tadpoles produced conclusions of great generality. Ini- tially, at least, the individual autecology of the different taxa and the adaptive plasticity of tad- poles was not recognized. The core topic of study was, after all, community structure and not tadpoles per se. It took another 10 years or so before the behavioral complexity and plastic- ity of tadpoles was fully appreciated and inte- grated into tadpole ecology. I remember the first time I started an opto- kinetic stimulus drum rotating around a tad- pole and saw the animal suddenly stop its pro- tean perambulations and precisely track the moving vertical bands (Wassersug, 1973). I was amazed. Tadpoles even had behaviors that could be studied experimentally. Through the 1960s and 1970s, tadpoles' behavioral responses to assorted abiotic environmental variables, such as temperature and oxygen concentration, became well documented. A big advance in tadpole behavioral studies came in the late 1970s, when B. Waldman and K. Adler reported in Nature (1979) that Bufo tad- poles preferred to hang out with sibs than with nonsibs. Soon it was discovered that tadpoles of some species could even distinguish half-sib- lings from full-siblings (data reviewed in Table 9.1 in Tadpoles). Immediately, we became aware that tadpoles were aware not just of their phys- ical environment but also of each other. Back then, E. O. Wilson's Sociobiology was but five years old, and kin selection theory was fresh and stimulating. Tadpoles instantly became model organisms for the study of kin recognition in vertebrates. Before the end of the 1980s, several labora- tories had established that tadpoles were not only aware of other tadpoles but also of preda- tors nearby and could respond accordingly. In the last decade and a half, dozens of papers have documented that tadpoles of a multitude of species lay low when they smell predators in their neighborhood (reviewed in Wassersug, 1997; Relyea and Werner, 1999; Laurila, 2000). This immobility response is a hallmark of tad- poles and is so easy to document that it has made tadpoles the model of choice in many studies of predator-prey interactions (e.g., Ekl6v and Werner, 2000; Van Buskirk, 2000; Van Bus- kirk and McCollum, 2000). The separate disci- plines of tadpole community ecology and be- havioral biology had finally coalesced. The latest advance in the study of tadpole ad- aptations is the discovery of phenotypic plastic- ity in their morphology. Tadpoles can alter their shape in response to predatory risk. Depending on the species-and the environmental risks- we now know that certain tadpoles can change their size, growth rate, behavior, shape, and even color (recent representative studies in- clude Van Buskirk and Relyea, 1998; Van Bus- kirk and McCollum, 1999; Relyea and Werner, 2000; Van Buskirk, 2000). Tadpoles have thus made it to the main- stream of integrative biology as sensitive, re- sponsive, and amazingly adaptive organisms. Now, when one attends a herpetology (or, for that matter, an ecology, conservation biology, evolution, or behavior) meeting, one can ex- pect to see a dozen or more posters and talks related to the biology of amphibian larvae. And one can count on those presentations to be among the most empirical studies on the venue. All this leads back to the book review and a final criticism of Tadpoles, which is that it pre- sents these organisms in a rather static fashion. The dynamic, hence vitalistic, aspects of these animals, which is implicit in their adaptive plas- ticity, is downplayed. Part of this can be ascribed to the fact that the book was "in press" for a very long time and most papers published after 1997 are not included. A few of the key papers from the mid-1990s on phenotypic plasticity are cited (mostly by R. Alford, a Wilbur student), but McDiarmid and Altig say little about this topic in their own chapters. The problem may be an unavoidable one, inherent in the typolog- ical task that the editors have accepted for themselves. Enormous intraspecific variation in tadpole ecology, morphology, and behavior pro- hibits clean packing of polliwogs into ecomor- phological types. If one's goals are classificatory and nomenclatural stability, variability can be vexing. TAKING TADPOLE BIOLOGY INTO THE 21ST CENTURY: WHERE DO WE Go FROM HERE? There are two unfortunate pressing problems that are likely to keep tadpoles on center stage for some time: the epidemic of deformities in frogs (Johnson et al., 1999; Sessions et al., 1999; Ouellet, 2000) and the global decline of anuran populations (Houlahan et al., 2000). These problems will have to be solved, if we are going to have many tadpoles left in the wild to study at the beginning of the 22nd century. There is a deep ravine between the develop- mental biology community studying the inter- nal mechanism controlling metamorphosis and the community of ecologists studying environ-</page><page sequence="8">1132 COPEIA, 2000, NO. 4 mental influences on the same process. As evi- dence of this, one finds almost no overlap (few- er than 3% by my estimate) between the cita- tions in the new book Amphibian Metamorphosis (Shi, 2000) and Tadpoles. A few scientists rec- ognize the problem (e.g., Denver, 1998), but we are still a long way from understanding how, for example, a change in the volume of water around a tadpole is sensed by the organism and ultimately manifested as changes in gene tran- scription within specific tissues. To my mind, merging ecology with developmental molecular biology into a "unified theory" of metamorpho- sis is among the biggest challenges facing tad- pole biologists. While on the topic of metamorphosis, it is worth noting that we do not even know the an- swer to the basic question of what happens to the tissue in a tadpole's tail when it metamor- phoses. Sure, the tail is resorbed. But to what extent are breakdown products catabolized or excreted versus salvaged and used to build oth- er tissues? Furthermore, there are many great questions remaining in tadpole biology independent of metamorphosis. Understanding the evolution of the tadpole body plan is certainly one of them. Tadpoles share with adult frogs an ex- tremely short vertebral column, with fewer than 10 vertebrae between the skull and sacrum. The genes that regulate the formation of vertebrae and the spacing between the pelvic and pectoral girdles are being discovered and identified for other vertebrates (see Carroll et al., 1999, for discussion of Pax 1; Gad and Tam, 1999, on GDF-11). Soon we will be able to identify the genes that have been either deleted or inacti- vated to truncate the anuran vertebral col- umn-then put them back in or turn them back on. It is no longer a fantasy to propose "recon- structing" the lissamphibian ancestors of tad- poles. Major puzzles also persist in the behavioral ecology of tadpoles. What, for example, are the signaling molecules sensed by tadpoles that tell them that it is a predator, and not a sibling, lurking nearby? With so many studies docu- menting tadpoles' responsiveness to chemicals emitted by predators (see above), parasites, and other pathogens (Kiesecker et al., 1999a; Thie- mann and Wassersug, in press) plus, of course, other tadpoles (Hoff et al. chapter in Tadpoles), it is high time we identified some of those com- pounds. Ammonium may be one component (Kiesecker et al., 1999b), but it is too ubiquitous and not specific enough to account for all of the taxonomic variation documented to date. There is a practical reason to identify these compounds. To the extent that certain ones stress tadpoles, if they turn out to be species- specific, they could be used to "handicap" tad- poles of introduced exotic species (e.g., Bufo marinus and Rana catesbeiana) where they are detrimentally affecting native fauna (cf. Wasser- sug, 1997). The dietary ecology of tadpoles has been barely explored. Various terms, pertaining to diet and feeding mechanics, arise in Tadpoles (e.g., herbivores, opportunistic omnivores, de- tritivores, suspension feeders) in such a way that ineluctably led me to conclude that we know very little about what tadpoles eat and how they make dietary decisions. There are easily 10 pa- pers published on the relationship of tadpoles to the trophic level above them for every one published on the relationship of tadpoles to the trophic level below. Admittedly, it is easier to see what eats tadpoles than what tadpoles eat. Few of us, myself included, have made the effort to learn the classic microbiology and phycology necessary to establish what choices tadpoles have in terms of what they could, and do, ingest (a recent exception is S. Kupferberg; see papers cited in Sanderson and Kupferberg, 1999). Meanwhile others have begun to point out the dangers of inferring the dietary ecology of tad- poles solely from their morphology (e.g., Pe- tranka and Kennedy, 1999). As mentioned earlier, digestive physiology is a largely unexplored area in tadpole biology. Until we know a bit more about what tadpoles ingest, we are unlikely to know what they digest. A major question in this area is: "How effective- ly can tadpoles process cellulose?" The litera- ture is vague and contradictory about what op- tions, if any, tadpoles have for processing cel- lulose. Their gut symbiotes remain largely un- studied, and the nutritional importance of coprophagy to their diet is almost completely unexplored. In terms of functional morphology, the sad fact is that, despite all the attention given to oral hardware in defining ecomorphological types for tadpoles, we have little understanding of how tadpoles actually use their oral structures. Is there some neat, adaptive explanation for why most tadpoles have two upper (anterior) and three lower (posterior) rows of denticles (labial teeth), or is this pattern solely the result of evolutionary inertia? My own cursory look at the oral disc of Rana catesbeiana tadpoles, as the tadpoles surfaced to breathe air, revealed a cru- cial role that movement of the disc and its mar- ginal papillae play in permitting these tadpoles to separate air from water in less than 150 msec (Wassersug and Yamashita, 2000). These obser-</page><page sequence="9">BOOK REVEIWS 1133 vations would not have been possible without high speed (500 frames per second) imaging. Similarly, kinematic analyses should reveal much about how tadpoles use their oral struc- tures in feeding. THE BOTTOM LINE Apropos of Lord Rutherford's famous di- chotomy, Tadpoles is firmly in the world of col- lections. This is not pejorative for it is necessary to have good collections to see clear patterns. With all of its lists and tables, Tadpoles is a bril- liant compilation of information on the world's most common aquatic amphibians. Tadpoles marks the end of a great century for tadpole biology. It is now time to move on. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Many people were kind enough to provide critical feedback on draft versions of this review, including J. Caldwell, M. Crump, D. Skelly, M. Fejtek, G.
