<plain_text><page sequence="1">Juan Goytisolo. Juan sin tierra. Barcelona. Seix Barral. 1975. 323 pages. In Senas de identidad (1966) the protagonist searches the past for his authentic identity; he learns that it is nearly impossible to separate his own history from Spain's. In Reivindicacion del Conde don Julian (1970; see BA 45:2, pp. 286-87) this same character attempts to destroy mentally all that is "Spanish" within him. In Juan sin tierra the protagonist continues his psychic assault by fiercely satirizing anthropomorphic views of God, the ideals of bourgeois society wherever they are found and traditional novelistic canons. Juan sin tierra reads like a manifesto for a literary an- archist. The act of writing is central to the novel's experi- ence; it permits the narrator unlimited imaginative scope and countless dreams of vengeance. In the opening pages Father Vosk explains to a group of Negro slaves the process of divine defecation: like a plant, spiritually super- ior beings emit only a sweet-smelling perfume. Later the narrator fertilizes a new "Virgin" (black) and creates at once a mirror-reflection of himself and a mulatto "mes- siah." The narrator then again presents Vosk, now a social novelist turned mountain girl. Vosk, the narrator's Spanish self, begins to "cease to exist." In the final part the narrator suggests that he has eradicated Spain from his being. The novel ends with a short postscript in Arabic: a worldly Utopia is possible only if we eliminate cultural boundaries - "Juan sin tierra" - and seek universal brother- hood. Except for these positive affirmations, Juan sin tierra is in many ways very similar to Reivindicacion : a declara- tion on the novelist's right to invent; the primacy of lin- guistic anarchy and a sarcastic tone over the traditional development of plot and character; a series of shocking religious heresies; the tu narrative stance; the mix of fantasy and reality; and the ever-present doppelganger. Despite Juan sin tierra 's technical virtuosity, Reivindica- cion remains Goytisolo's finest novelistic achievement. Michael D. Thomas University of Houston</page></plain_text>
