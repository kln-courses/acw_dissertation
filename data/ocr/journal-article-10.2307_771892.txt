<plain_text><page sequence="1">PAUL KLEE AND THE OBJECT SECOND PART by JOHN A. THWAITES OU7resy J . D. Iv umunn MASK OF A GIRL PAUL KLEE THE FIRST thing that will happen when one's mind stops being focussed on material objects is that it will make objects for itself. As it empties of sensations of sight or sound or touch or taste it fills up again with images. They are images of sight and sound and of touch and taste, but they are tied by association, which is to say in time. Each one follows ana provokes the next one. The Finding Place is built up in this way. Your eye catches first the shape of a house coming out of the painted surface. Then across and after this you see an- other sketch, one of Klee's childlike symbols for the house facade. At first there is a look of Gris or Picasso taking objects to bits and recombining them. Only in- stead of a putting together in space it is a coming after in time. Instead of stylizing objects tobuild upan analogy of form, Klee plays variations on a form which bring object analogies tumbling after them. Here a dog-tooth shape creates a mat, wineglasses, roofs and pyramids successively. Then it is echoed in larger forms. Finally the artist varies it to the square and cube and so goes into another series. Then the same thing happens again with the square and cube themselves and with the ladder form, step form, rod form and the sphere or ball. It is like Joyce's punning. Each new allusion you find adds to the states of living and feeling touched on and makes the symbol stronger. But in Klee the symbol is a form. A thought, as Von Wedderkop puts it, which when ex- pressed and argued is destroyed, can exist in the formal content of Klee's pictures. Taken together the effect of these themes or variations is to give you the sense of a complete world. It is the material world seen subjec- tively, through the reversed telescope of association. Very many of Klee's pictures have this kind of percep- tion, at one remove from the senses. Some like Recon- struction (1926) and Last Snow (1927) even look similar to The Finding Place. In the earlier paintings the association is more obvious and more literary. Such are The Balloons (1918), In Construction (1918) and A Memory (1915). Then sometimes Klee plays all through a picture on one kind of form association. You can see it in the cold rectangles of Cold Town and The Moon Cold Over the Park, or in the arabesque of Baroque Interior (1919). Round the Fish (1926) and The Meal (1928), although there is so much more definition, are of the same kind. It was these pictures which showed Miro, in those days, how to look at the object with reserve. But even where the object of consciousness is not a material thing, it can be a more definite symbol to focus the emotions inside one. In the lithograph of The Man in Love it is sexual feeling that is focussed so, and just as in Proust, the emotion is altogether painful. The mouth of the Man is like something you might have torn in a piece of cloth. Put this mouth with Degas' careful notes of the cafe mouths he saw, or with the satirical exag- gerations Hogarth made, and see which best conveys the SEVEN</page><page sequence="2">THE DANCER Colurtcsy J. B. Neullmannt violence and impotence of desire. There is the same dis- tortion in the eyes, an asymmetry which makes them glare into themselves. It is a dry trance of pain. At first all this seems contradicted by a kind of comic paper symbolism with the object of the man's emotion drawn in inside the circle of his head. But this justifies itself, as all Klee's childlike symbols do, by being more direct than anything else. The whole arabesque is focussed on this circle in which the marionette revolves, spinning out from the inked rose color of the background. Somehow it gives you a sense of the endless erotic dream. Each picture of this kind is different from each other one. Cat and Bird (1928) might be a witticism on The Man in Love, but after a little you feel that it is not the bird but you who are being hypnotized. The Dance of the Dreaming Child interprets the dream, Moth Dance (1923) the obsession, and The Twittering Machine (1922) humor. Figurine of a Madman and Madman in a Trance are studies in ecstasy as well as movement. They are all the crystallizing-out of mind states into symbols, in relation to some object of consciousness. in its approach to the object, The Man in Love is symbolist in the way that Redon was. But Cat and Bird is rather expressionist. As Alfred Barr points out, the Cat's power to hypnotize comes from Klee's knowledge of Melanesian masks. This becomes still clearer in The Mask of a Girl, partly because of its "hairy" technique. The nose and mouth come through in a kind of Expres- sionist Impressionism: a material impression made for a psychological effect. The head is roughed out in con- centric circles and the eyes combine the look of being stuck on carelessly with a hypnotic stare, just as you find them combined in the Oceanic figures. It is not that Klee imitates the primitives. It is that he learned from them symbols, material symbols which as they act on your senses focus subjective feeling. He learned to use texture, not as the cubists did for a plastic feeling of the object, but to give a psycho-physical reaction. The sense of the material is as strong as ever here, but it has become like Swift's or Baudelaire's. Klee uses these symbols, as the exotic artist does, to make personal an urge or fear, or some impersonal force. This Mask is a weird dream figure which does not symbolize some- thing definite in consciousness as does The Man in Love. She stands at the edge of the preconscious, con- centrating and releasing a flood of emotion. This is what Klee's contemporaries, the Expressionists, were trying for and rarely able to achieve These Expressionist pictures of Klee's are quite frequent. In The Mask of an Actor (1924) he uses wood-tex- ture for the same effect, something you can also find in exotic art and which he taught to Max Ernst and the Surrealists. Other ones are Lady with a Veil (1922), Two Heads (1926) The Spirit which Drinks and Plays (1927) Madman of the Abyss (1927) and Erection of the Monument (1929). Professor Read calls Klee's art an art of free fantasy. That is almost as bad as the memory residues and myths. For it not only shuts all of Klee's painting into what is only a part of his painting, but it mis-states what that part is. In The Comedy the painter's seeing of the object, his sense of the material thing, is as sharp as it was in Young Park. There are human elements, animal elements, fish and vegetable ones, all rather as you will find them in American Indian art. Each one is defined in its drawing and each one stands forward in a little glow. Their textures Klee insists on very much. He brings a Greco-roman fold out of an arabesque, but you feel it fall and settle. There are very many kinds of wood tex- tures, of bark, or cross-cut wood and of grain. And there are the spiky things Klee loves, sprays of grass or reeds, fronds or fir twigs or the backbones of fishes. Each has all his feeling for the object in its tiniest structure. EIGHT (Lithograph) MAN IN LOVE</page><page sequence="3">But this time the artist, as Von Wedderkop puts it, is using his grasp of the "real" world to overthrow it. He destroys the material quality of these objects when he moves them into a world where the material matters only for the fantasy it can bring after it. Each element makes on one its impression and one forms associations with it. At once both it and they are denied, as far as the logic of objective things is, by the next element in the play. You take from the spotted areas on the left a wood feeling. Then you find the same texture in the erotic figurine above. By reaction that destroys the wood feeling in you but it creates something else. Again, on the right, there is a fanshaped form three times repeated. Once it is drapery, once a spray, perhaps of grass. Then above, the two in one are turned back into the arabesque of line which crea.ted them. The more you look the more am- biguity grows. The zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figures, from which Miro and Max Ernst derived their images, rise out of the strengthening of this feeling. All through there is the colliding of associations. Those which tell us that an arm must have a leg and a flower must have a pot get violated. But the other ones rooted deeper in us than the ordinary ways we have of seeing, these ones are affirmed. As in a dream the manifest con- tent, the images, is arranged and distorted not according TIGHTROPE WALKER to its own nature but that of'a latent content which is not seen. Klee has penetrated the material object in all its ways of being. Now he recombines it along the lines of this subjective logic. That is what Grohmann means when he says that Klee gets so close to the act of crea- tion that he seizes its essence, so that he can create reali- ties which do not even exist. This is not an affair of projecting a state of mind like The Man in Love. Nor is it simply a release of subjective emotion like The Head of a Girl. Still less is it the daydreaming of free fantasy. It is the making of a psychologic to break up that logic of the "real" world which our habit of mind and not our senses force on us. Probably the first of Klee's fantasies was the famous Musical Dinner Party, of 1907. But of course this one has a special relation to the object, in sound. Then there is The Twittering Machine again, certainly a fantasy in its arrangement of bird and machine elements to express che la-tent content, a joke one cannot put in words. The fantasy of Ballet Group (1923) rests on an odd analogy. It is not simply the analogy of human with vegetable being, but also that of the movement of dance with the infinitely slow movement of the growing plants. Some other fantasies of this kind are The Enchantment in Red (1926), Conjuring Trick (1927), Plants at the Edge of the River (1927), The Eater of Flowers (1927), Plants by the River (1928), Garden with Animals (1928) and Dog Barking (1928). Not only is Klee's work not all fantasy; his fantasy itself is not all of one kind. Surrealists have been wondering at him and learning what they could from him and to them he has become one of themselves. Crevel sees in Klee, as he puts it, all the graffiti of that other world, creatures of hypnosis and flowers of ectoplasm, drawn and photographed without fraudulent romanticism. That is what Klee is doing in The Comedy. It is a very exciting thing and for the Surrealists it is the only path to that other world. It is their way to break up the habit logic of this one. But Klee does not need to despise knowledge or to make his revolution in consciousness by a retreat from consciousness as they do. He can use knowledge in an intuitive way. Klee's interest in the object led him to know intuitively its mechanics, its acoustics, its optics and its thermics. He invented forms for all those phases of its being. Then his interest in the object and in man took him beyond the senses. Intuitively he knew and through his forms made us know fear, laughter, hope, lust, despair and emotions to which we have not given names yet. His interest in something each time gives place to his in- terest in its solution. And the solution is its subjective meaning, its meaning in the human way of feeling. He includes music and mathematics, moral and physical science and his humanism transforms them into the symbols of his fantasies. These become, so to say, a mathematics of aspiration, a metaphysics of form, the sound of a thought, the diagram of an emotion. Klee's breaking of the "real" world is not a denial of knowledge but a freeing. It is not an end in itself but a becoming, (Continued onl page 33) NINE</page><page sequence="4">an interest in art unless it is treated in the manner of a sports writer or a columnist, such books as this may satisfy a need, and an interest, stim- ulated in this way may later develop into something more sober and pro- found. Or it may make the reader weary of art as an occasion for sen- sational journalism and find the calmer satisfactions desired some- where far away from art. BANDITS IN A LANDSCAPE, by W. Gaunt. The Studio Publications, N. Y. $2.50. This book is sub-titled: "A study of Romantic Paintings from Caravaggio to Delacroix." It is hardly a work for thoughtful study by the historian of art, as it is an essay based on a vague literary generaliza- tion, illustrated by discussions of cer- tain artists whom the author chooses to call romantic, and whose careers, temperaments, and productions he describes. The title is derived from landscapes by Salvator Rosa, and it is unavoidable in a broad, sweeping classification of this sort, that there are certain hasty conclusions, and superficial but emphatic assertions. Like other universal claims enthusi- astically advanced by juggling with a few time-worn ideas such as genius, classical, expression, and realism, while practicing the verbal magic of the paradox, the concept of the ro- mantic is apt to yield either empty futility or congested confusion. If, however, neither a critical a.ttitude towards venerable myths nor fresh fact are expected in this book, it may be enjoyed. It is another amusing or irritating expression of the persistent and popular appreciation of art as the work of the erratic, irresponsible, and fantastic identified as genius. SELF &amp; PARTNERS (MOSTLY SELF), by C. J. Holmes. Macmillan, N. Y. $4.00. These reminiscences of Sir Charles Holmes bring the story of an energetic and resourceful life down as far as 1925. The energy is proved by the variety of tasks to which he devoted himself and the resourcefulness by the frequent suc- cess that he enjoyed in meeting extra- ordinary emergencies. As journalist, publisher, professor, museum direc- tor, and painter he had in each sphere enough tribulations and triumphs to satisfy anybody. The rich variety of experience and intimate contact with celebrities of his day makes the reader regret that the narrative stops so long before the end of his career. The quality of information and the sidelights cast upon the world of London art in his times are more penetrating and illuminating than one might expect from such a sentence as this in the preface: "Mine has been a 'safety first' life of office jobs, done to pay my way, to give various masters some return for their money, and, incidentally, to dilute passion, fashion and prejudice in the arts with tepid common sense ."

It has the mechanics of The Tight- rope Walker and the time feeling of Time and the Plants. But the forms are no longer simply interpre- tations. They have become symbols in a human fantasy. Take one figure alone, the circle. In the phrase just quoted the arrow had its meaning in physical flight replaced by the meaning of thought-purpose reaching forward. While the first kind of ar- row, Klee says, shoots out from the earth and returns with gravity, the second kind of arrow goes on curving until it goes into a circle or ellipse, the final endless movement. In Klee's symbolism that represents the uncon- fined movement of thought set against the limited physical fact. It is man against the world. So much is in one figure, the little circle that quivers and recedes with a sense of infinity. The same depths lie behind each ambiguous form. In the picture Menace and Flight of the same year the theme is much simpler, but the method is the same. Clown (1929) gets the same effect in a very different way. And the greater number of Klee's later pic- tures belong to this kind of fantasy, which perhaps was the rarest before. There are When I Was In the Desert and The Look of Silence and many others. Their relation to the object resembles that of The Limits of Reason, but in the crea- tion of form, which we have not dis- cussed here, they have some of the most important of Klee's inventions. GALLERY NOTES (Continued from page 29) er of lithography to Bellows and Kent, Sterner is perhaps even prouder of his unrelenting opposition to the "bungling" moderns. The artist is eternal and unchanging, he will say, and art by no means should reflect the spirit of the age. Fortunate in that his life has fallen in serene and hapDy places, he paints women at tea in the garden, sun sifting through the trees, a Negro stable boy from Pinehurst, a country stable, the Green Mountains, a woman reading on a blue sofa,-a cheerful and peaceful account of life as he has ex- perienced it. In the drawings and prints there is more action, excite- ment, and therefore mrore interest. Sarah E. Hanley and Walter Emer- son Baum have been sharing honors at the Tricker Galleries, the former with oils and the latter with water- colors and pastels. Miss Hanley, as- sociated with the Tiffany Foundation as assistant director, is holding her first one-man show at this gallery, and her first exhibition in three years in New York, although in the past she has had several one-man shows. Included are a number of religious subjects, landscapes with deep pur- ples, reds and greens predominating, and some interesting still-lifes of marine themes like the pictorial Flor- ida sea fan. Mr. Baum, art editor of the Philadelphia Bulletin and a foun- der of the Kline-Baum Art School, paints chiefly Pennsylvania country scenes, with some romantic views of industrial cities which are pleasing in pattern. Berenice Abbott's exhibition of pho- tographs, "Changing New York," at the Museum of the City of New York, has been extended four weeks beyond the original six-weeks' pe- riod and will be on view till January 3, 1938, due to public interest.
