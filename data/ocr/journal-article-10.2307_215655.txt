The Great Northern Railway vigorously encouraged visitation to Glacier Na- tional Park between 1911 and 1930. We reconstruct the railway's promotional imagery of Gla- cier through an assessment of 796 photographs used by the company to publicize park landscapes and activities. Seven themes in the photographs-Native Americans, scenery, recreation, wildlife, the Wild West, park management, and personalities-reveal a useful portrait of how Glacier National Park was marketed with images of the American West mass distributed for decades by one of the nation's most influential corporations. Keywords: American West, Glacier National Park, Great Northern Railway, place images, tourism. qmagining the West was the armchair avocation of millions of Americans in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Popular fiction, landscape paintings and sketches, travelers' accounts, newspaper articles, and promotional materials defined the regional character of the American West for an ever larger and always curious na- tional population (Smith 1950; Etulain 1982; Trenton and Hassrick 1983; Athearn 1986; Fifer 1988; Kinsey 1992; Wyckoffand Nash 1994). After 1870 the tourism indus- try increasingly defined popular images of the West as part of an initiative to con- vince middle- and upper-class Americans to consume the region's natural and cultural wonders (Athearn 1986,131-159; Fifer 1988; Shaffer 1994). With the comple- tion of the first transcontinental rail line in 1869, railroad companies became ever more important participants in these marketing efforts (Hyde 1990; Pomeroy 1990; Runte 1990; Orsi, Runte, and Smith-Baranzini 1993; Shaffer 1994,1996; Wilson 1997). In this paper we examine the promotional imagery used by the Great Northern Rail- way to encourage travel to northern Montana's Glacier National Park (Historical Re- search Associates 1980, 64-102; Hyde 1990, 53-146, 281-295; Schene 1990; Lambert 1996). The diversity, enthusiasm, magnitude, and success of these promotional efforts exemplified the role of western American railroads in creating popular im- ages of the West. * The authors gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Theresa Bundick, Deirdre Shaw, and George McFarland in obtaining prints of historical photographs. *fi DR.

Created in 1910, the park sat strategically along the Great Northern's trunk line between Minneapolis and Seattle (Figure 1). It was in Glacier, with its towering peaks, surefooted mountain goats, and romanti- cized Native Americans, that the Great Northern defined an image of what made the West a region of mythic character and a place where ordinary Americans could ex- perience extraordinary things.

FIG. i-The Great Northern Railway's 1934 promotional map shows the strategic location of Gla- cier National Park along its trunk line between Minneapolis and Seattle. (Reproduced from the col- lection of William Wyckoff) expressed in words and pictures and repeated across America, offers an ideal avenue for exploring how Glacier Park was packaged and marketed through a series of pow- erful, place-based symbols (Shaffer 1994, 93-95). Black-and-white photographs offer a rich archival record of the evolution of re- gional cultural identities and the part played by landscape imagery in their creation (Hales 1988; Edwards 1992; Jenkins 1993; Hegeman 1994; Wyckoff and Nash 1994; Schwartz 1996). Great Northern promotional photographs, which appeared in hun- dreds of American newspapers between 1911 and 1930, allow reconstruction of the company's image-making campaign that centered on Montana's Glacier National Park. Visual imagery amounts to an invaluable text displaying the origins and inter- mingling of corporate ideologies, popular stereotypes, and cultural predilections that shaped how Americans experienced one of the West's largest and most popular national parks (Hyde 1990; Barnes and Duncan 1992,5-8; Wyckoff 1995; Rowntree 1996, 145-147). 1996,145-147). 2</page><page sequence="3">IMAGERY OF GLACIER NATIONAL PARK REGIONAL IMAGES OF THE AMERICAN WEST Understanding propagation of regional images serves several purposes. It allows us to reconstruct with accuracy the history of place perceptions and to explore the ori- gins of the imaginative geographies that still shape popular regional images (Athearn 1986; Shortridge 1989). Studies of place images create explicit contexts- cultural, social, political, and economic-that help us understand how the West evolved as a distinctive American region (Hyde 1990; Wyckoff and Nash 1994). As- sessments also explore national values and the larger political and economic pro- cesses played out within western settings (Smith 1950; Athearn 1986, 271-272; Shaffer 1994, 2-3). Tourism contributed to the creation of many American landscapes, and the promotion of tourism played a similarly formative role in shaping popular percep- tions of American regions (MacCannell 1976, 3-4; Shaffer 1994, 2-3, 11-13). Recrea- tional travel, particularly by the elite, was a well-established tradition in the East. By 1850 summer pilgrimages to mountain and seaside resorts shaped place images in settings such as the Catskills, Long Island, and Narragansett Bay (Bachelder 1875; Dulles 1965; Sears 1989; Wyckoffg99o). Anne Hyde (1990) suggests, however, that as tourism developed in the West with the completion of the transcontinental rail- road, Americans encountered radically different physical and cultural settings. Previously inaccessible and exotic places were suddenly within reach of many affluent Americans. California and Colorado emerged as two particularly attrac- tive tourist destinations, a function of their scenery, their presumed curative and restorative environments, and the effective promotional efforts of both public and private interests that stood to benefit from the increased consumption of their amenity-rich, western landscapes (Fifer 1988; Pomeroy 1990). The flood of books, magazine and newspaper articles, promotional pamphlets, and advertisements de- signed to guide and encourage such consumption in the West created new ways to apprehend and understand these unfamiliar settings, and they also exemplified the effectiveness of many marketing techniques that still dominate the mass media (Hyde 1990). Railroad companies were central to promoting the West between 1870 and 1930 (Hyde 1990; Runte 1990; Lambert 1996). Rail lines in the region increased, and with them came vigorous competition for westbound tourists and increasingly sophisti- cated and elaborate marketing campaigns (West 1996). Much publicity fostered in- terest along the Union Pacific's transcontinental line in the 187os, and within a decade the Northern Pacific's Yellowstone Wonderland promotional campaign also drew greater numbers to the northern Rockies (Fifer 1988, 151-190; Hyde 1990; Shaffer 1996, 563-564). Colorado's amenities were trumpeted by the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad, whose narrow-gauge lines probed virtually every corner of the state (Athearn 1962; Fifer 1988, 223-314). In the Southwest, the Santa Fe Railroad's marketing campaign produced tremendous interest in the Grand Canyon and nearby desert regions (McLuhan 1985; Francaviglia 1994; Rothman 1996; Weigle and Babcock 1996; Wilson 1997). 3</page><page sequence="4">THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW The aim of these publicity efforts was obvious. Encouraging travel to the West provided immediate passenger revenue. Even more, it encouraged lasting settle- ment and development. Advertising campaigns appealed to Europeans, who were targeted as potential tourists and settlers. Railroad marketing departments faced the task of producing attractive, alluring, and entertaining images of the West that would convince people, preferably rich or at least with comfortable means, to sally forth and witness the unexplored. Doing so, the railroads aped and shaped popular perceptions. Still, these regional portraits were but selective and fragmentary repre- sentations of vaster and more complex areas. Railroad-company images typically evinced a tunnel vision, with guidebooks and advertisements that highlighted por- tions of the West along the company's tracks (Haines 1977,30-31; Hyde 1990, 53-106; Runte 1990). Thus, as the several competing transcontinental lines took shape after 1870, they produced a series of linear descriptions of the West's natural and human features. THE GREAT NORTHERN'S PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGN The Great Northern Railway enthusiastically embraced the place-promoting tech- niques already practiced by the Union Pacific, Northern Pacific, Santa Fe, and other western railroads. Although the transcontinental line between Minneapolis and Se- attle was completed in the early 189os, the railroad's interest in western image mak- ing did not shift into high gear until 1907. That year marked the ascendancy of Louis Hill to the railroad's presidency. Hill succeeded his father, and although he lacked some of James J. Hill's business acumen, his passion for the American West and its scenery sparked a quarter-century-long marketing campaign which highlighted the portions of the region that lay along the Great Northern's lines (Historical Research Associates 1980, 64-102; Hidy, Hidy, and Scott 1988, 124-125; Runte 1990, 33-38; Schene 1990). Not surprisingly, the younger Hill became an enthusiastic advocate for a new national park along the crest of the Rockies in a wild and scenic area just north of the railroad in Montana. Once Glacier National Park was created in 1910, he em- barked on a vigorous campaign of investment and promotion that focused the entire nation on the park's wonders (Figure 2). For Hill, Glacier epitomized the American West and highlighted the region's striking differences from the urban East (Shaffer 1994). Glacier would be a sanctuary where overworked Americans could revive their spirits and sample the amenities of western living in a pristine, natural setting. By 1916 Hill had constructed an elaborate assemblage of fine hotels, Swiss-style alpine chalets, and transportation linkages across the eastern half of the park. Lacking government funding, park officials for the most part welcomed the developments. Nowhere was Hill's zeal more apparent than in the ambitious and calculated ad- vertising initiative that became an integral part of his Glacier Park investments and a central thrust in the Great Northern's larger "See America First" campaign (Runte 1990, 33-38; Shaffer 1994). It was not enough to construct a rail line and a collection of park accommodations. Americans needed to know what Glacier offered, so Hill, 4</page><page sequence="5">IMAGERY OF GLACIER NATIONAL PARK 5 CANADA UNITED STATES- THIS MAP WILL PASS AA,MAEM \ GIVE YOU AN ~~- AIA 4 F IT ND N eATMNAtBAS ::::1 :,::ID E A O F 0:::: [* a'/- M FIG. 2l-Apromo?tional map^ produced bytheGrea tMtI.

The Great Northern line follows the southern boundary of the park. (Reproduced from the collection of William Wyckoff) with his promotional agent, Hoke Smith, drew up an elaborate, multimedia adver- tising campaign to bring the new park into the home and imagination of every American. Hill and Smith agreed on the need for a highly visual advertising effort. They were, after all, encouraging tourists to "See America First.' Glacier Park's land- scape was packaged through an elaborate iconography of powerful and oft-repeated visual symbols that were designed to represent a unified and alluring regional ideal. The Great Northern touted Glacier Park in its promotional literature, making it ubiquitous on billboards and posters and the subject of thousands of newspaper stories and advertisements (Hidy, Hidy and Scott 1988,124-125; Hyde 1990, 281-295;</page><page sequence="6">THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW Shaffer 1994, 92-143; Lambert 1996). Long-lasting business relationships were forged with landscape painters and photographers who, as the Great Northern's agents, produced high-quality imagery posted in art exhibitions, railroad depots, and hotel lobbies around the country. "Glacier Park Indians" toured the nation in full regalia and camped atop urban skyscrapers, providing surefire stunts to gener- ate favorable publicity for the Great Northern and its western playground. Even the company's freight cars displayed the telltale logo of "Rocky," the famous mountain goat who haunted the Glacier high country. The outpouring of imagery was reinforced in the park itself: Great Northern concessionaires and guides greeted tourists with the same Blackfeet Indians that were highlighted in advertising brochures; park chalets and hotel interiors empha- sized local scenery and wildlife; and horse-trail tours offered visitors an unending panorama of wilderness experiences, all in a carefully controlled, safe environment. GLACIER PARK PHOTOGRAPHS AND PLACE PROMOTION Photographs dominated the Great Northern's marketing of the Glacier Park land- scape. The perceived veracity of black-and-white photography added authenticity to place images (Schwartz 1996). The camera was a relatively new tool, and the mass, low-cost reproduction of photographs in popular magazines, Great Northern litera- ture, and even daily newspapers was transforming the advertising business and the ways in which Americans vicariously experienced locales. Traditional written land- scape descriptions were being supplanted byvisual imagery that offered, particularly through photographs, a new and seemingly translucent display of places. Quick to adopt the new technology and to see its advantages in place promotion, Hill and Smith established contractual relationships with Fred H. Kiser and Tomer J. Hileman, two Glacier Park photographers whose technically superior work remains an outstanding visual legacy of the park to this day (Shaffer 1994, 126-131; Lambert 1996). Successful in the company, Kiser and Hileman gave the Great Northern all it wanted. The widespread reproduction of their work paralleled efforts by William Henry Jackson and the Haynes photographic concession for nearby Yellowstone Park and presaged a less commercial but no less notable relationship between Ansel Adams and Yosemite National Park. The Great Northern also brought to bear other company employees, wire-service photographers, and even Park Service personnel to compile an elaborate visual record of Glacier's scenic and cultural attractions. Al- though disarmingly realistic, the photographs were in fact carefully orchestrated re- productions of landscapes designed to communicate key elements of the Great Northern's visual iconography that was central to their Glacier Park marketing strategy. Average Americans often encountered the photographs in their daily newspa- pers. Both Louis Hill and Hoke Smith established relationships with dozens of influential newspaper editors. Only a year after the park was created, Great Northern officials saw the advantages of the "splendid publicity articles in reference to Gla- cier," and they noted that after "the story is once prepared it is merely a matter of 6</page><page sequence="7">IMAGERY OF GLACIER NATIONAL PARK clerical help to get it out and distributed to the proper papers" (Shaffer 1994,121). Be- tween 1911 and 1914 touring parties of newspapermen visited the park, courtesy of the Great Northern. When they returned to their home cities, their printed stories, always studded with striking Great Northern-provided photographs of park high- lights, brought free publicity to the company's Montana playground. Through the Roaring Twenties additional formal relationships were established between Great Northern agents and local newspapers. The company bought adver- tising space in exchange for a newspaper's cooperation in running hundreds of so- called news releases about Glacier Park, stories that were actually formulations by the Great Northern's publicity department (Shaffer 1994). Literally thousands of such inserts became almost everyday occurrences in many newspapers. During the mid-i92os Hoke Smith reported that more than 16,000 stories on Glacier Park ap- peared annually in American newspapers, repeated many times in different cities once they were released by the company (GN 1911-1943). Indeed, a clipping service utilized by the Great Northern in 1923 to track the success of the newspaper publicity campaign noted that "Glacier National Park secured the publication of a great deal more original publicity matter than Yellowstone Park... particularly photos" (Van Alstyne 1923). Hoke Smith tracked the marketing effort through a series of scrapbooks in which he mounted copies of Glacier Park stories that appeared in newspapers (GN 1911-1943). The scrapbooks were sent periodically to company superiors for inspec- tion. Today microfilmed copies of the surviving scrapbooks are an invaluable archi- val record of the Great Northern's image-making efforts. Although they do not contain every publicity news release issued by the company, they hold almost 800 different photographs used between 1911 and 1930, many of which were replicated dozens of times in different newspapers. They constitute the best and most compre- hensive visual record of an ambitious and widely diffused Great Northern publicity effort. Analysis of these photographs and the captions that accompanied them offers a unique way in which to measure the evolution of the company's image-making campaign. After we assessed the photographs for general content and themes, we as- signed them to one or more of seven major subject categories (Table I). Just 2 per- cent of the photographs fell outside these seven categories. We assessed each photograph only once, no matter how many copies of it were preserved in the scrap- books. Because many of the 796 photographs contained multiple subjects, a total of 1,092 observations pertaining to the content of the photographs were included in the study. DOMINANT IMAGES OF GLACIER NATIONAL PARK The photographic record indicates that the Great Northern's Glacier publicity cam- paign centered on several themes. These appeared in an oft-repeated iconography of visual symbols in the newspaper photographs of the park (Table I). These themes were replicated in other promotional literature and within the park itself. From the 7</page><page sequence="8">THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW Great Northern's perspective, the photographs defined Glacier Park's place identity for potential tourists. Almost one-third of the images highlighted Native Americans, usually Blackfeet Indians. Approximately 30 percent of the photographs emphasized the park's wilderness character, displaying a variety of scenic features and views of park wildlife. Another 28 percent of the images identified the importance of three Anglo-American landscape impacts within the park, including its "frontier" heri- tage, the popular recreational activities engaged in by park visitors, and the role TABLE I-SUBJECTS OF GREAT NORTHERN PROMOTIONAL IMAGERY 1911-1920 1921-1925 1926-1930 TOTAL TOTAL SUBJECT (%) (%) (%) (%) NUMBER Native Americans 35 29 30 30 326 Scenery 38 23 15 21 223 Recreation 24 14 17 16 178 Wildlife 2 9 11 10 104 Wild West 1 6 5 5 56 Park management 0 6 9 7 74 Personalities 0 10 13 10 114 Miscellaneous 0 3 1 2 17 TOTAL NUMBER 93 491 508 1,092 Source: GN 1911-1943.

Also gaining in significance in the 1920S were photographs of park visits by national personalities, including famous artists, actors, and politicians. In addition to these thematic predilections, Great Northern imagery displayed geographical biases. Predictably, more than three-quarters of specific place images focused on the eastern half of the park, where the Great Northern's own develop- ments were concentrated and where most long-distance visitors spent their time. Park boundaries also proved permeable and movable in the context of the imagery. Most pronounced was the blurring of the park's boundary with the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, which adjoins it to the east (Figure 2). The Blackfeet were constantly re- ferred to as "Glacier National Park Indians," and many reservation activities were portrayed as if they took place in the park itself. Similarly, the Blackfeet were often photographed inside the park, camped out on glacial lakes or peering off into the al- pine fastnesses of the high country. Less overtly, the park's western and northern boundaries were stretched through the Great Northern's ambitious marketing efforts. The scenic Flathead Valley and Lake, perhaps 20 miles west of the park, were often translocated in captions to the confines of Glacier. In addition, Canada's Wa- terton Lakes National Park (extending Glacier to the north) was frequently included in imagery by the late 192os, after the Great Northern constructed its own lavish Prince of Wales Hotel in the Canadian park. 8</page><page sequence="9">IMAGERY OF GLACIER NATIONAL PARK NATIVE AMERICANS Blackfeet Indians became key symbols in the Great Northern's Glacier Park publicity campaign (Hyde 1990, 229-238, 281-295; Shaffer 1994, 97-101, 123-124; Lambert 1996). Louis Hill befriended tribal leaders and became an honorary member of the tribe. He envisioned the Indians as integral parts of the western landscape and cor- rectly gauged their appeal to tourists, who hungered to experience Indians in their "native settings." The Blackfeet became a defining element in any Glacier Park visit. Dozens of natural features near and within the park took Blackfeet place-names. Blackfeet greeted tourists at the train station and toted their bags to the hotel, which was everywhere decorated with Blackfeet paintings and artifacts. Blackfeet singers and dancers provided evening entertainment. On the trail, park visitors were often di- rected by Blackfeet guides and slept in tepee-style accommodations. More than any other national park, Glacier became synonymous with Indians, an image largely as- sociated with Hill's tireless publicity efforts. Indeed, in what still can be construed as a remarkable if subtle coup in modern marketing, a prominent Blackfeet Indian was selected as the model for the "Buffalo Nickel" that debuted in 1913, only three years after the creation of Glacier. What could please Hill more than one of "his" Indians in the pocket of every American boy? Images of Blackfeet appeared in 30 percent of the newspaper publicity photo- graphs. Some photographs emphasized Rousseau-like "noble savages," thoroughly divorced from the modern world, often engaged either in traditional cultural activi- ties or in the silent contemplation of nature (Figure 3) (Josephy 1969, 3-9). This was already a highly stylized image in western American photography, perfected by vis- ual pioneers such as William Henry Jackson, Edward S. Curtis, and others who worked carefully on Native American pose and background to communicate ro- manticized portrayals of Indian cultures (McLuhan and Coleman 1972; Hales 1988, 27-39; Hegeman 1994). Through such imagery, no matter how staged the promotional scenes actually were, tourists were invited to observe preindustrial cultures in harmony with their natural surroundings. Some photographs and their captions also made specific ref- erence to the cultural loss associated with the end of the Indian's traditional lifestyle. In addition, when such perspectives were integrated with background scenery, as they often were in the Glacier examples, Native Americans enhanced the sense of wilderness aesthetics for tourists: They became objects of nature to be consumed along with the towering peaks and sparkling lakes (Shaffer 1994, 97-101). Even more dominant than images of "noble savagery" were dozens of photo- graphs juxtaposing Native Americans, often in incongruous ways, with modern American society. Such views often portrayed the Blackfeet in the role of humorous entertainers, acting out a visual parody that comically explored the theme of cul- tural assimilation and accommodation. Examples often strained the bounds of cre- dulity: Indians in full "traditional" dress were shown playing golf, operating 9</page><page sequence="10">THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW FIG. 3-A Blackfeet Indian sits in harmony with nature in Glacier National Park, 1927. (Repro- duced from the collection of William Wyckoff) telephone switchboards, celebrating Thanksgiving and Christmas, playing the tuba, or attending Rotary Club meetings (Figure 4). Also chronicled in this genre were several Blackfeet publicity trips to major American cities arranged by Hoke Smith. These junkets highlighted the utter Otherness of these western American curiosities and heightened popular interest in their Rocky Mountain homeland. Such expedi- tions were huge advertising successes, often garnering front-page photographs in the New York City newspapers as Blackfeet chiefs mingled with mayors and pitched wigwams atop skyscrapers (GN 1911-1943). A reciprocal set of images, the caricatured Indianization of whites, displayed the complex interstices between Native American and Anglo cultures. Tourists, often well-known public personalities, were shown smoking peace pipes, wearing Indian clothing, or being ceremoniously inducted into the tribe. Indeed, by the mid-192os such activities had become a standard photographic opportunity for almost any dignitary who visited the park. Such images carry many meanings. Writ large are the signatures of a set of pre- sumed power relationships between white and Native cultures (Edwards 1992, 5-6; Hegeman 1994; Schwartz 1996). The colonial metaphor is obvious in scenes of 10</page><page sequence="11">IMAGERY OF GLACIER NATIONAL PARK A X 1 ANE FIG. 4-Two cultures are juxtaposed as Miss Jennie Many Tail Feathers operates the Glacier Na- tional Park switchboard, 1923. (Reproduced courtesy of the Minnesota Historical Society) wealthy American tourists consuming experiences and the conquered peoples re- duced to serving as tour guides and entertainers. But Native American representa- tions communicated more complex messages as well. The Great Northern imagery successfully used Indians as symbols of wilderness and of the costs of a traditional culture adopting more modern lifeways. In so doing, the images encouraged tourists themselves to experience more directly the dialectics between Native American and Anglo-American and how those dramas were being played out within Glacier Park. Given the popularity of these encounters in and near the park, contact with the Blackfeet proved to be an enormously appealing experience for traveling Americans in an era when Native Americans were no longer seen as a threat to whites and when formative mass media such as radio and motion pictures were in their infancy. Con- versely, the Great Northern's campaign also offered Native Americans a creative role, as they actively participated in the economic benefits and cultural transformations that stemmed from the growth of tourism in the northern Rockies (Neel 1996). SCENERY AND WILDLIFE Glacier Parks's spectacular natural scenery frequently appeared in the newspaper publicity photographs, especially in the early years when many reporters and Ameri- cans were less familiar with the park's scenic amenities. Howwould potential tourists be convinced to visit Glacier unless they saw representations of the scenerywith their own eyes, all irrefutably published in black-and-white photographs in their local 11</page><page sequence="12">THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW newspapers? For its images of Glacier scenery, the Great Northern relied heavily on the work of the western photographers Kiser and Hileman. Both men knew the park well, and the wide reproduction of their work was important in publicizing the re- gion's scenic wonders. In several instances newspapers also printed photographs of park landscape paintings, usually by artists commissioned by the Great Northern. In addition, Hill and the Great Northern were familiar with the successful, railroad- managed publicity campaigns for Arizona's Grand Canyon region as well as for nearby Yellowstone National Park (Hales 1988; Kinsey 1992; Francaviglia 1994; Wei- gle and Babcock 1996; Wilson 1997). Traditional European and Euroamerican responses to the landscape provided a parade of predictable visual symbols that represented Glacier's natural landscape and echoed larger responses to the American West (Hales 1988, 50; Hyde 1990, 53-146; Runte 1990,33-38; Shaffer 1994,92-143; Wyckoff and Nash 1994). Mountain peaks-often serrated and glaciated-and water features-lakes, waterfalls, and rushing mountain streams-dominated the imagery. Most western American na- ture photographers did not depart from the traditional landscape aesthetics of the late Romantic period. The spaciousness, wildness, and sense of scale emphasized the distance of such locales from the ordinary landscapes of everyday Americans, in- creasing their appeal as sublime yet accessible retreats from more urban settings (Schmitt 1969). As constantly reinforced through the Great Northern's "See America First" marketing campaign, here were all the glories of the European Alps without the costs, time, and risks associated with leaving American shores behind (Shaffer 1994, 1996). Indeed, in that context representations of magnificent park scenery played on American patriotism-why turn one's back on such native wonders when they now were so close at hand? These themes were articulated, as well, by the Na- tional Park Service once it was created in 1916 (Yard 1921; Swain 1966). The successful scenery photograph often required hours of planning and pa- tience. Land, water, and sky were carefully delegated predictable proportions of the image, and lighting conditions often wavered as sun and clouds frustrated profes- sionals and amateurs alike. If people played a part in the picture, they were also care- fully arranged to establish scale or to enhance the romantic appeal of the scene. Here was a setting and a visual rhetoric far removed from the everyday American land- scape, an environment clearly dominated by a nature that the interloper might visit and thrill to but never quite possess (Figure 5). Often photographs of park scenery, particularly in Sunday newspaper inserts, were grouped in full-page mosaics in which a half dozen or more images were shown together, reinforcing the diversity of the visual and experiential spectacle promised by a visit to Glacier. Park wildlife was also displayed in the photographs, particularly by the 1920S. Great Northern promoters understood the important recreational, aesthetic, and symbolic roles played by wild animals in the national parks, and this was reflected in the dozens of mountain goats, bighorn sheep, bears, elk, and deer in the photo- graphs. In addition, the company's famous mountain-goat logo appeared every- where (Hidy, Hidy, and Scott 1988, 124-125). Animal heads also gazed serenely at 12</page><page sequence="13">IMAGERY OF GLACIER NATIONAL PARK 13 I; *~~~~~~~~~~~ _ENVW-C __0,10! wmlx^ I W "- FIG. 5-Alpine topography and waterfalls in Glacier National Park, 1924.

On trail trips in the park, an almost certain and much-anticipated highlight was to spot examples of the park's numerous wildlife. Indeed, animals were-and are still-an integral part of experiencing western American scenery. Two western natu- ral scientists articulated the importance of animals in the national parks in 1916: "As a FIG. 6-The "monarch of the crags" poses in the high-country wilderness of Glacier National Park, 1927. (Reproduced courtesy of the Glacier National Park Archives) stimulant to the senses of far sight and far hearing, faculties largely or altogether ne- glected in the present scheme of civilization, they are of no less consequence than the scenery, the solitude and the trails. To the natural charm of the landscape they add the witchery of movement" (Grinnell and Storer 1916, 377). For many Americans, animals also symbolized the twin contrails of freedom and wildness associated with the early-twentieth-century West. To see them in Glacier or in the other western parks was an opportunity, if only a fleeting one, to experience and participate directly in the consumption of those myths. As with multiple representations of Native Americans, wildlife imagery com- municated diverse meanings. Many photographs, carefully staged in dramatic, al- pine settings, portrayed the park's bighorn sheep and mountain goats (Figure 6). These two animals, with supporting captions, symbolized the independence of park 14 a * 4 2r i U: ', p k 2; 's *r c- s? I tt ss</page><page sequence="15">IMAGERY OF GLACIER NATIONAL PARK wildlife. For example, "his majesty" and the "monarchs of the heights" were pre- sented "exulting in freedom," reinforcing park images of mountain scenery and al- pine wilderness. Alternative depictions of wild animals embraced a more playful message: They were there to delight and entertain visitors. For example, unlike the elevated and sa- FIG. 7-A dancing bear delights visitors to Glacier Na- tional Park, 1925. (Reproduced courtesy of the Minnesota Historical Society) cred status given black and grizzly bears in current interpretations of national-park wilderness, earlier bruin imagery emphasized humorous and anthropomorphic at- tributes. In Glacier, bears were shown comically breaking into hotels, dancing to jazz music, and taking food from amused park visitors (Figure 7). Smaller mammals made cameo appearances, usually with their own humanlike traits. Marmots did tricks, squirrels begged, and park birds became entertaining emendations to lodge verandas. Paralleling the imagery of the Blackfeet, park animals added color to the travel experience: They embodied the sublime ideals of the wilderness aesthetics and the 15</page><page sequence="16">THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW more mundane but equally essential role of park entertainer. Indians and animals alike were conquered and circumscribed curiosities, if still capable of providing temporary entree into a world separate from the lives of most Americans. That world was enormously popular with Glacier-bound tourists: Between 1912 and 1930 park visitation grew tenfold. ANGLO-AMERICAN IMPRINTS Imprints of Anglo-American culture were also infused into the Great Northern's Glacier Park imagery. Taken together, almost 30 percent of the publicity images de- picted scenes that evoked themes of frontier settlement, modern outdoor recreation, or Park Service management. Scenes of recreation in the park appeared early, but photographs displaying the attractions of the frontier era or those bespeaking an in- terest in the details of Park Service management were not used until after 1920. From the beginning Louis Hill wanted a variety of active and healthy outdoor ac- tivities to keep tourists entertained in the park and to lengthen their visits. After all, the outdoor playground at Glacier offered fishing, boating, hiking, tent camping, trail riding, and mountain climbing for anyone who was fit enough to don boots and leave the confines of the hotel. Park Service boosters echoed the call for visitors to develop "a keen interest in outdoor things," "encourage climbing," and reawaken their "dormant faculties" (Grinnell and Storer 1916,376). Such appeals became even more widespread in the 1920S and 1930s, as western national parks grew accessible to budget-minded, middle-class travelers (NPS 1918, 16; Lambert 1996,53). Within Gla- cier, Great Northern concessionaires provided dozens of options, giving visitors op- portunities for guided trips, planned schedules for hiking and camping, and tips on all the best spots in which to fish or climb. Naturally, the park's hotels and chalets be- came focal points for outings, and lodging staff were always prepared to offer sugges- tions and guide visitors in promising directions. Appealing images of recreational activities appeared throughout the Great Northern's publicity photographs. The railroad's hotels and lodges were often in- cluded in outdoor scenes of people enjoying the park. A favorite theme of Hill's was Glacier as a "trail park" best seen on horseback. The healthy exertions of outdoor dude travel by saddle was folded in with the rewards of scenery and backcountry dis- covery. Photographs of trail parties and camping displayed the virtues of great cav- alries of riders in the parks. A pair of early newspapermen escorted through the park by the railroad company produced promotional pamphlets entitled "Over the Trails of Glacier National Park" and "Diary of an Amateur Explorer in Glacier National Park." These booklets, like the newspaper stories and photographs, celebrated the traditional charms of outdoor living (Chapman 1912; Dillon 1912). Along with many "eyewitness" photographs in the newspapers, a cooperating reporter penned "Gla- cier National Park, Where the Fighting Trout Leap High," an additional publicity booklet for the Great Northern that recognized angling's magnetic draw for thou- sands of potential visitors (Brokaw 1912) (Figure 8). 16</page><page sequence="17">IMAGERY OF GLACIER NATIONAL PARK FIG. 8-A fisherman's reward in Glacier National Park, 1928. (Reproduced courtesy of the Minne- sota Historical Society) 17</page><page sequence="18">THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW Another set of images suggested a more explicitly historical bent extolling the virtues of frontier living and the excitement of the Wild West. A rich assemblage of visual symbols appears in the publicity photographs, particularly during the 1920S (Athearn 1986, 23-42). Two dominant themes emerged. One collection of images centered on the passing of frontier conditions in the region. Local pioneers were profiled, and landscape objects such as disused log cabins and decaying bison skulls were employed to depict the passage of time. In some instances the legacy of frontier conditions remained: For example, the isolation of a northern Montana post office 30 miles from a railhead is detailed. These frontier signatures assigned special value to the challenges faced by the area's early and isolated Anglo settlers, and these pio- neers were incorporated into the local flavor of the region. Even more popular were the cowboy-related symbols that were integrated into the Great Northern's publicity campaigns and visitors' experiences. This is particu- larly curious, because the high, glaciated mountains of northern Montana never played much of a role in the West's range-cattle business. Clearly, the Great North- ern's use of cowboy imagery was meant to resonate with the more generalized "west- ern" touring experience being offered to its customers. Louis Hill's many Glacier excursions and backcountry experiences suggested his affinities for the cowboy and horse as enduring symbols of western adventure, freedom, and morality. The "dude's West" was widely promoted in popular literature, traveling shows, and the growing dude-ranch industry itself (Borne 1983; Athearn 1986, 23-42, 131-159; Lam- bert 1996). The Great Northern's use of the cowboy echoed such predilections and reinforced their persistent place in western American regional imagery. Cowboy guides led tourists into the high country, entertained them around campfires, and encouraged them to assume the role themselves by togging up with the appropriate boots, chaps, and wide-brimmed hats. Cowboy culture was entertaining, and it embodied the frontier values to appeal to the romantic expectations of Glacier's touring clientele. As with the contacts with Native Americans, "most tourists expected to be thrilled but not ever frightened by reminders of the Wild West" (Hyde 1990, 112). Cowboy iconography appeared in many publicity photographs, particularly after 1920 with the Great Northern's in- creasingly elaborate array of accommodations, tours, and entertainment in the park (Figure 9). Cowboy guides on the trail, tourists in western garb, and trick-riding, lasso-wielding ropers were traditional examples of cowboy imagery. Photographs of boxing cowgirls and saddled mountain goats appealed to more whimsical tastes. Images of park management were another expression of human activity within Glacier. Particularly in the late 1920S, publicity photographs made the National Park Service an ever more visible and active part of the region's identity. By that time the intense campaign by National Park Service Director Stephen Mather and others to popularize the agency and its parks not only had dovetailed with that of the Great Northern but also had firmly implanted the ranger as a trustworthy icon of the west- ern wildlands (Shankland 1970; Albright and Taylor 1972; Mackintosh 1986, 7-8). Park budgets were on the rise, and park employees often worked closely with Great 18</page><page sequence="19">IMAGERY OF GLACIER NATIONAL PARK Northern concessionaires and supplied the railroad company with photographs and stories. Images of rangers at work sometimes echoed pioneer themes, as they were shown in isolated areas of the park engaged in frontierlike activities such as trail clearing and backcountry snowshoeing. Indeed, these representatives of the FIG. 9-Hi Crawford, one of the cowboy guides who enli- vened the western landscape in Glacier National Park, 1923. (Reproduced from the collection of William Wyckoff) federal government in the West reflected one of the larger realities that distinguished the region from the East (Wyckoff and Dilsaver 1995, 35-39). In a more subtle way, images of park management communicated attitudes about nature and environmental manipulation that aptly reflected an intervention- ist period of Park Service management, an era characterized by a sense of confidence in the human ability to improve on and fine-tune the natural world (Wright 1992, 35). Such an attitude paralleled the white-Indian power relationships of the period: 19</page><page sequence="20">THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW Glacier's environment had been conquered by Euroamericans, just as its Native in- habitants had been (Shaffer 1994, 97, ioi). Photographs of wildlife-management techniques exemplified the presumed re- lationships between park managers and the natural world. An active policy ofpreda- tor control was maintained in the park into the 1920S, and publicity photographs FIG. 1o-Efforts to control predators produced unlikely or- phans in Glacier National Park, 1925. (Reproduced courtesy of the Glacier National Park Archives) highlighted the authorized killing of undesirable animals such as mountain lions, leaving in their wake many an orphaned feline (Runte 1987, 111; Wright 1992,35) (Fig- ure o1). Equally rich in their symbolic import were images of "helpless" park deer, elk, and even mountain goats subsisting on food provided by sympathetic rangers during the winter months (Figure 11). Imagery of such well-meaning environmental paternalism extended to the widespread planting of exotic fish in dozens of Glacier's lakes, the building of birdhouses for deserving fowl, and aggressive campaigns to eliminate "destructive" insect populations. 20</page><page sequence="21">IMAGERY OF GLACIER NATIONAL PARK PERSONALITIES IN THE PARK Approximately o1 percent of the promotional images focused on famous, unusual, or entertaining visitors to the park. These personalities, often shown meeting Black- feet Indians or engaged in outdoor recreational activities, included ordinary visitors as well as politicians, artists, and entertainers of the day. The presence of wealthy and FIG. 11-Park rangers fed deer and other desirable wildlife during the long Glacier National Park winters, 1929. (Reproduced courtesy of the Minnesota Historical Society) famous visitors added to the glamour and attractiveness of the park, particularly for any social climbers who could afford to take advantage of the Great Northern's Gla- cier Park amenities. Indeed, who would not thrill to meeting world-famous moun- taineer Dorothy Pilley as she ascended Glacier's lofty peaks, high above the Many Glacier Hotel (Figure 12)? Photographs of such visits proved that Glacier mattered and that the park ranked among the nation's most spectacular resort locales. CONTEXTS FOR A WESTERN ENCOUNTER The Great Northern's efforts packaged and promoted an encounter with Glacier Na- tional Park that proved remarkably popular with tourists of the 191os and 1920S. Park visitation leaped from only 4,000 visitors in 1911 to more than 70,000 visitors in 1930.

(Reproduced courtesy of the Glacier National Park Archives) 22</page><page sequence="23">IMAGERY OF GLACIER NATIONAL PARK ticated appreciation for what Americans wanted in their western travels and how it molded those desires into its publicity. The message was particularly crafted for an upper-class clientele who could afford to travel to the area's finer hotels and chalets. Still, the wide circulation of the imagery guaranteed that it was seen by a much larger segment of the American population than could actually travel to the park (Wyckoff 1990, 341-343). Louis Hill and Hoke Smith were clever interpreters and manufactur- ers of tourist tastes, and their understanding of how to translate those tastes into a widely understood iconography of Glacier Park symbols exemplified the critical role played by western railroads in the development of the West's tourist industry and in the articulation of a distinctive and persistent regional identity. The complex mes- sages produced by the Great Northern photographs placed the traveler's encounter into four contexts that highlight the attractions of western travel and suggest what those attractions can tell us about the larger cultural predilections of the period. First, the photographs emphasized how utterly different Glacier's landscapes and lifestyles were from the experiences of most Americans (Hyde 1990; Shaffer 1994,92-143). Here everyday jobs, communities, and responsibilities could be shed. The imaginative geographies portrayed in the photographs suggested that Glacier was an ideal place in which to escape the stresses and ennui of everyday urban life and instead consume the unique amenities of the Mountain West. In Glacier, chaps replaced suit trousers, and constraining ties and bowlers were left behind for ban- dannas and ten-gallon hats. The Blackfeet Indians who wandered about constantly reminded visitors that they had left city and suburbs far behind. But it was an acces- sible Otherness that was being promoted, an exotic, exciting place of western adven- ture that nevertheless was safe and offered a hearty meal and comfortable bed at the end of the day (West 1996, 41-42). Second, many of the photos focused on a Romantic aesthetic of sublime nature and outdoor recreation that generally appealed to the dominant cultural conven- tions of the day and paralleled the larger values of the National Park system through- out the West (NPS n.d.). Hundreds of alpine peaks, pristine rivers, and shimmering lakes were the fare of newspaper photographs. Here also was an aesthetic that recog- nized the growing national appeal of wilderness. But, as the popularity of the na- tional parks had already demonstrated, it was to be a wilderness bracketed by and available for human activities and experiences. The human-land encounter in Gla- cier exquisitely displayed a vision held in common by Louis Hill and Stephen Mather. For both, parks were for people and thus were to be enjoyed and used. The Great Northern photographs became a canon of visual rhetoric that instructed visi- tors in how to see and experience the park's natural beauty and recreational possi- bilities. Third, the images emphasized the playfulness, humor, tall-tale telling, and fan- tasy that were deeply entrenched in American culture and were readily incorporated into the consumption of the western American landscape (Cunliffe 1970, 157-177). Louis Hill and Hoke Smith were integral contributors to that tradition by creating a western identity, including an acknowledged self-parody not only tolerated but also 23</page><page sequence="24">THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW celebrated. Americans were inundated with images of golfing Indians, jitterbugging bears, and peace-pipe-smoking movie stars, all time-honored examples of fibbing and truth stretching that broadcast humor and lightheartedness as part of the Gla- cier experience. Finally, even within the very real aesthetics of Glacier's spectacular scenery and the comical caprice of its human and animal populations, a darker but equally significant context adds meaning to the newspaper images. Ultimately the photo- graphs are expressions of cultural power and control, and the visual symbols vividly communicate an iconography of taken-for-granted relationships that define many prevailing attitudes of the day and that characterize important and surviving ele- ments of Glacier's identity as a distinctive place in the American West (Limerick 1987). The photographs offer a highly selective portrayal of the region that inevitably served the corporate interests of those who produced and distributed them (Schwartz 1996). A related set of relationships revealed in the images juxtaposed elite Anglo tourists with conquered Native peoples (Hyde 1990; Edwards 1992). The Blackfeet were something to be consumed, just like the chalet accommodations and the barbecued steaks. They were not cultural equals but evening entertainment. In fact, Glacier's natural setting became just as conquerable and consumable as its Na- tive inhabitants. The images suggest that modern Americans, while still able to revel in the mountain peaks and bighorn sheep, could best do so from the safety of hotel verandas, well-shod packhorses, and elaborately organized tours in which human imperatives and predilections were paramount. The images of Glacier display a set of well-defined, place-based signatures ar- ticulated by those who were involved in promoting the park. For boosters like the Great Northern's Louis Hill the language of visual symbols, so vividly revealed in the newspaper photographs, produced a semiology of landscape elements rich in their ability to denote recognizable signposts of regional character-signposts as palpable as they were inchoate. Hill's success in marketing Glacier is indisputable, given the growing popularity of the park during the 1920S. Indeed, the popular response to his publicity campaign suggests that it resonated remarkably well with the public. It also exemplified the ever-growing importance of visual media in the shaping of twentieth-century images of place. REFERENCES Albright, H. M., and F. J. Taylor. 1972. Oh Ranger!
