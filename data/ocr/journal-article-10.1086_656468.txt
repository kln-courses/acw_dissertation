         <p>When Charles Darwin first published <italic>The Expression of the
Emotions in Man and Animals</italic> his purpose was to show continuity
in emotional expression across species and thereby strengthen his
theory of evolution. Surrounding the book's illustrations, therefore,
one finds descriptions of animal emotion designed to elicit our recognition
as members of a universal audience. In this case our charm instantiates
Darwin's argument for emotional continuity across species at
the same time that we as members of a historical audience may miss
the sly provocation of contemporaries with which the passage concludes

            <p>The lips of young orangs and chimpanzees are protruded, sometimes
to a wonderful degree, under various circumstances. They act thus,
not only when slightly angered, sulky, or disappointed, but when alarmed
at anything—in one instance, at the sight of a turtle—and
likewise when pleased. … The accompanying drawing represents
a chimpanzee made sulky by an orange having been offered him, and
then taken away. A similar protrusion or pouting of the lips, though
to a much slighter degree, may be seen in sulky children.1</p>

         <p>Like many others, this moment in the <italic>Expression</italic> (as Darwin called it) is both rhetorical and inseparable from its
science, which we sometimes imagine transcends the material that binds
it to accidents of medium, occasion, and person. In this essay I recall
how Darwin's <italic>Expression</italic> foregrounds the inherent
rhetoricity of emotion, thereby outstripping Paul Ekman's science
of emotion that claims to follow in its wake and which has recently
infiltrated the humanities like a Trojan horse settling in the new
critical subfield of Cognitive Approaches to Literature (CAL). Instead
I will argue that Darwin's rhetoric of emotion is remarkably
skeptical and humanistic, which does not diminish its scientific piquancy
but rather aligns it with our “situated” theories in the
science of cognition recently mobilized, for example, by the philosopher
of biology Alva Noë in his academic bestseller <italic>Out of
Our Heads: Why You Are Not Your Brain and Other Lessons from the Biology
of Consciousness</italic>.2 Thus
realigned, I conclude, Darwin's <italic>Expression</italic> helps
us understand anew how an adequate model of consciousness must be
able to account for literary emotion—a claim I illustrate by
reading a canonic passage on fellow feeling from Laurence Sterne's <italic>A Sentimental Journey through France and Italy</italic>.</p>
         <p>Though initially a bestseller, the <italic>Expression</italic> lapsed
into relative obscurity during the next century as Darwin's evolutionary
theory established itself primarily on other terms, including, most
importantly, the fossil record, homologies across related life-forms,
geographic distribution of related species, and artificial selection
like dog breeding. Meanwhile the ambiguities of studying emotion rendered
it a difficult and even suspect science for the next century, especially
insofar as the mechanics of our emotional life lacked the reliable
metric promised by a rational life that might be reconstructed in
the spirit of logical positivism or tracked, for instance, through
idealized behaviors such as rational choice in the marketplace.3 “It's raining” seemed
the kind of thought that might reliably link the mind and the real
world, but the experience of fear suffered from all sorts of semantic
and practical ambiguities that made any experimental project difficult
to realize, even after Darwin's evolutionary argument.4 Recently, however, the <italic>Expression</italic> has made a dramatic comeback as the study of emotion mushrooms across
academic disciplines and in applied fields such as homeland security5 or in a popular arena such as the
TV drama <italic>Lie to Me</italic>, which is built around expert
analysis of emotional microexpressions à la Ekman.6 Now considered wrong about certain
facts, such as the Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics
and the emotional primitivism of the insane,7 Darwin's <italic>Expression</italic> has recently reemerged
as the foundational work in the science of emotion, both in terms
of methodology and theory. In 1998, nearly a full century after the
second edition, Ekman introduced and provided a running commentary
on the third edition, underscoring how passages such as the following
grounded the methodology for studying emotion still followed today
across the social and natural sciences.</p>

            <p>Dr. Duchenne galvanized, as we have already seen [figs. 2–4], certain muscles in the face of an old man, whose skin was little
sensitive, and thus produced various expressions which were photographed
on a large scale. It fortunately occurred to me to show several of
the best plates [fig. 3, bottom],
without a word of explanation, to above twenty educated persons of
various ages and both sexes, asking them, in each case, by what emotion
or feeling the old man was supposed to be agitated; and I recorded
their answers in the words which they used. Several of the expressions
were instantly recognized by almost every one, though described in
not exactly the same terms; and these may, I think, be relied on as
truthful, and will hereafter be specified. [<italic>E</italic>, p.

         <p>Then Ekman abruptly inserts the following comment in the 1998 edition: “Darwin
describes here his use of a method to find out what information is
conveyed by an expression: asking people to judge the emotion shown
in a photograph without any information about the situation in which
the expression occurred, and determining whether or not they agree.
This has become the most commonly used method for studying facial
expression, although Darwin is rarely cited as the first to use it.”9 Indeed, Ekman himself has applied
what he considers essentially the same methodology over the last thirty-five
years as he developed his influential work on the basic pancultural
emotions displayed in the following image set. Can you name them (fig. 5)? Relying on this image set
and others like it, Ekman has produced a methodology for studying
emotion scientifically, and from this work he has developed the Facial
Action Coding System (FACS) used widely in cognitive science designed
to locate emotional centers in the brain by correlating brain activity
with exposure to carefully selected photographs. Of the cognitive
scientists who rely upon FACS, Antonio Damasio is the most influential
in the humanities, as we will see below.</p>

         <p>In an article in <italic>Nature</italic>, Damasio describes an
experiment where amygdala-damaged patients judge faces on a trustworthiness
and approachability scale.10 The faces had been previously selected by “normal individuals”
who were asked: “How would you rate this face on the scale of
one to five, relative to the trustworthiness and approachability that
the owner of the face inspires? Or, in other words, how eager would
you be to approach the person with this particular face if you needed
help?” As it turns out, Damasio reports, the amygdala-damaged
patients judged faces “you or I” would consider suspicious
and try to avoid as trustworthy and approachable.11 Then based on this experiment Damasio and his
colleagues located the relevant emotion in the brain while bracketing
pressing questions about what counts as a trustworthy and approachable
face, to whom, under what circumstances, and why. Technical issues
abound.</p>
         <p>In a section of his book provocatively titled “The New Phrenology?”
No|$$|Ade outlines a debilitating set of problems faced by researchers
who try to locate us in our brains, including most importantly (1)
the impossibility of eliminating feedback produced by the two-directionality
of the brain-senses loop; (2) normalizing imperatives that produce
results against a stock brain; and (3) the impossibility of eliciting
direct information about consciousness or cognition through PET and
fMRI technologies that have to correlate physical magnitudes to blood
flow, blood flow to neural activity, and finally neural activity to
mental activity, like feeling suspicious (see <italic>O</italic>,
pp. 19–24). Though a brain-scan image may contain important
information about neural activity related to a cognitive process,
cautions Noë, “we need to take care not to be misled by
the visual, pictorial character of these images. Brain scans are not
pictures of cognitive processes in the brain in action” (<italic>O</italic>, p. 24).</p>
         <p>But for our purposes the shortcoming that matters most is methodological.
Emotions cannot be broken down into basic units—whether that
means molecules,12 brain images,
or facial expressions—without losing track of the phenomenon
at hand. Psychologist Jerome Kagan points out the category mistake
involved when the amygdala is activated by exposure to a photograph
of an angry face and the resulting image is called an emotion. Kagan
argues that the neuroscientist who insists that a particular brain
state represents an emotion resembles the physicist who denies the
reality of my pen because the mathematical interpretation of quantum
mechanics rejects the existence of stable objects.13 Though it may be useful to look for the elementary
foundations of both psychological and physical phenomena, Kagan concludes,
complex phenomena possess distinct properties and therefore require
distinct metrics and principles.14 That Kagan's valedictorian address to his students and colleagues
requires this reminder is not surprising.15 Surprising is that cautionary tales about parsimony in
human affairs speak to a growing number of humanities scholars who
overlook precisely the situational nuances that would seem most amenable
to their indigenous methodologies, as we will see below.</p>
         <p>So what does an evolutionary psychologist like Ekman mean by basic
emotions? Ekman applies the word <italic>basic</italic> to emotions
evolved for their adaptive value in dealing with fundamental life
tasks such as achievements, losses, frustrations, and so on. According
to Ekman, each emotion “prompts us in a direction which, in
the course of evolution, has done better than other solutions in recurring
circumstances that are relevant to goals,” and “innate
factors play a role in accounting for the characteristics they share,
not species-constant or species-variable learning” (“C,”
p. 46). Thus his commentary on Darwin's <italic>Expression</italic> winds down with the following strong program: “Although the
specific event may vary—the type of food, the general theme—ingesting
something repulsive as a cause for disgust, or ingesting something
attractive as a cause of enjoyment—is universal. <italic>I think
this is a good model for all the emotions</italic>.”16 However, this is also where Ekman
and his legions leave Darwin behind, with a sleight of hand that obfuscates
the subtlety of Darwin's work at the same time that it nudges
to the periphery of serious science the emotions that escape this
expressivist model of evolutionary biophysiology. In fact, as we will
see below, Ekman doesn't consider anything beyond the basic emotions
to be emotions at all.</p>
         <p>Among other things, this impoverished Darwinian model suggests
we investigate how a novel might serve as an emotionally competent
object where certain formal features elicit from the reader a sympathetic
or antipathetic response divorced from immediate action.17 An early example of such criticism
would be June Howard's <italic>American Literary History</italic> article “What Is Sentimentality?” which mobilizes Ekman
and Damasio in an effort to undermine debates about whether sentimentality
is a good or bad thing. More important than this evaluation, argues
Howard, citing Karen Sanchez-Eppler, is a transdisciplinary investigation
of sentimentality that would better explain how reading sentimental
fiction is a bodily act where the words that produce “pulse,
beats and sobs … radically contracts the distance between narrated
events and the moment of their reading, as the feelings in the story
are made tangibly present in the flesh of the reader.”18 Likewise in <italic>Shakespeare's
Brain: Reading with Cognitive Theory</italic>, Mary Thomas Crane draws
from Ekman and Damasio to argue for a reading of literature that grounds
the mind—including conscious and unconscious mental experiences
of perception, thought, and language—in the brain and other
bodily systems.19 In Jane F.
Thrailkill's <italic>Affecting Fictions: Mind, Body, and Emotion
in American Literary Realism</italic>, Ekman and Damasio are mobilized
throughout, particularly where the novel is described as an aesthetic
technology of the human organism.20 “In the relatively recent field known as Cognitive Approaches
to Literary Studies,” summarizes Suzanne Keen in her study of
empathy and the novel, the work of Ekman, Damasio, and Joseph LeDoux
have “virtually canonical status” insofar as matters of
affect are generally considered under the umbrella term “<italic>cognitive</italic>.”21 And that's where the impoverished Darwinian model promoted
by Ekman and Damasio obscures more than it reveals. A robust account
of the social world is essential for our understanding of emotion,
and therefore we are led astray by any parsimonious account of the
social world where cognition is reduced to a bodily function. Instead,
with Darwin I want to foreground a more appropriate rhetorical model
of cognition where consciousness is situated in the brain-body-world
nexus.</p>
         <p>That's not to say CAL are impossible; indeed I will conclude
this essay with an approach of my own, and I hope to see more of a
certain sort. The issue is which cognitive approach and which model
of cognition. The critical works just mentioned and others like them
might provide sensitive readings despite the impoverished model of
consciousness at their core, but the returns are diminishing. In her
lexical analysis of Shakespeare's plays (for instance, <italic>house</italic> and <italic>home</italic> in <italic>The Comedy of
Errors</italic>), Crane mobilizes the cognitive rhetorics of George
Lakoff and Mark Turner while offering “a possible background”
for Patricia Parker's cultural criticism of Shakespearean figures
(<italic>SB</italic>, p. 33).22 But it is precisely at the point where Crane situates such familiar
linguistic analyses against a cognitive science background that the
argument fails. Though a critic like Gail Kern Paster might productively
scrutinize bodily experience in relation to discourse, she has, according
to Crane, paid relatively little attention to the brain, “the
material place within the body where discourse is processed and therefore
where discursive construction, if it occurs, must be located”
(<italic>SB</italic>, p. 7). But then everything humans do can be
located in the brain at some point, so the observation does not help
us read Shakespeare any more than it helps us drive to the movie theater,
which we also do thanks, in part, to our brain. Crane explains far
too much with the brain: it is the “material site where discourse
enters the body, where entry into the symbolic occurs, and therefore
where the subject is constructed” (<italic>SB</italic>, p. 7).
It “is a material basis for a limited sense of ‘essential’
human attributes as well a space for individual arrangements of neurons”
(<italic>SB</italic>, p. 23). So when it comes time to discuss Timothy
Bright and Shakespeare on the processes behind emotional expression,
for instance, Ekman lurks predictably in the background (see <italic>SB</italic>, p. 244 n. 19) foreclosing cultural criticism, except
as a supplement. And what does literature do for us? The brain, according
to Crane, “constitutes the material site where biology <italic>engages</italic> culture to produce the mind and its manifestation,
the text” (<italic>SB</italic>, p. 35; emphasis added). Mind
is thereby sequestered in a brain that recedes from culture to the
point where a chasm must be bridged—hence the palliative work
of literature and its criticism.</p>
         <p>This brain-world dichotomy is typical in CAL, which provides the
ostensible cure. After her insightful analysis of the circus scene
from <italic>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</italic>, which argues
that Mark Twain invites the reader to reflect unsentimentally on his
or her emotional experience (the work of “realism”), Thrailkill
concludes with a metaphor of integrity assured by the surgical work
of literature and its criticism: “Works of literary realism
help us to realize that, when we read, we are all like Narcissus staring
into a puddle: delighting in that ‘extra you’ who, far
from being a solipsistic allusion, is a neurologically nested affective
companion keeping us from our isolation by suturing us, body and mind,
firmly to ourselves and to the world in which we live.”23 And, not surprisingly for Thrailkill,
this affective-cognitive achievement of literature relies explicitly
on biological stability according to Darwin's <italic>Expression</italic> as filtered through Ekman: “Drawing on evolutionary theory,
these emerging accounts suggest that while the cultural significance
of feelings, along with rules about displaying them, may fluctuate
over time, the actual corporeal architecture of emotional experience—almost
universal to members of a species—has evolved so slowly over
the course of millennia as to be, in a limited time frame of human
history, practically stable.”24 This, in turn, means that a literary critic like Thrailkill
can acknowledge cultural criticism as important but secondary and
then trump it with biological criticism with ostensibly wider reach.
But the problem is that Darwin himself is an equivocal ally in this
project.</p>
         <p>In this case Darwin's genius lies partially in his comparative
study of emotion across culture and species that avoids the dramatic
reductions Ekman and other scientists of emotion rely upon to make
their work acceptable within protocol defined too narrowly—reductions
that later justify scientistic conclusions drawn too broadly. Though
these humanistic commitments to scientific responsibility typically
recognize some contributions of critical theory, they tip the balance
by taking seriously advances in evolutionary psychology and cognitive
science of the particular sort I have briefly outlined. But in reducing
the domain of cultural explanation they achieve, whether intentionally
or not, a dubious political end of the sort critiqued by Lauren Berlant
in the introduction to her collection of essays <italic>Compassion:
The Culture and Politics of Emotion</italic>. When emotion is reduced
to a basic unit such as the face we should always ask about the institutional
consequences; in Berlant's case she tracks the trade-off when
compassionate conservatism relocates a particular zone of intimacy.</p>
         <disp-quote>
            <p>Compassionate conservatism advocates a sense of dignity to be derived
from labor itself—of a particular sort. No longer casting a
living wage, public education, affordable housing, and universal access
to economic resources as the foundation of the individual and collective
good life in the United States, the current state ideology sanctifies
the personal labor of reproducing life at work, at home, and in communities.
That is, income-producing labor is deemed valuable chiefly in the
context of its part in making smaller-scale, face-to-face publics.25</p>
         </disp-quote>
         <p>In other words, face-to-face and other sorts of emotional encounters
that we might attribute to our biologically grounded intuitions must
always be considered in a larger political context where the status
of social institutions are at stake. And this cautionary tale supported
by Darwin's <italic>Expression</italic> applies, I believe, equally
to scholars in the humanities who might reject the politics of compassionate
conservatism. No matter what the desired outcome, a model that squeezes
culture between the pincers of a brain-world divide hampers our facility
in cultural work and criticism.</p>
         <p>In contrast, Darwin's rhetoric is essential to his nonreductive
scientific project because emotions are themselves fundamentally rhetorical,
which is to say Darwin's methodology accounts for the emotion's
medium, occasion, and social situation. Consider again the word-image
relationship, which was of crucial importance in Darwin's study
of emotion and remains so to this day. Early in the <italic>Expression</italic>, Darwin describes his methodology while introducing an important
caveat now typically sidelined: persuasive examples notwithstanding
(for example, our Ekman exercise above), Darwin does not assume word-image
identity because he recognizes how interpretation shapes each point
in the equation.</p>
         <p>Upon viewing the now-famous Duchenne photographs “several
of the expressions were instantly recognised by almost everyone,”
notes Darwin, while others were subject to the most widely different
judgments and pronouncements. But rather than explaining away this
divergence like Ekman by way of an emotional hierarchy, or “display
rules” (<italic>E</italic>, p. 383), or stipulative definition,
Darwin cautiously introduces the role of imagination:  <disp-quote>
               <p>This exhibition was of use in another way, by convincing me <italic>how easily we may be misguided by our imagination</italic>; for when
I first looked through Dr. Duchenne's photographs, reading at
the same time the text, and thus learning what was intended, I was
struck with admiration at the truthfulness of all, with only a few
exceptions. Nevertheless, if I had examined them without any explanation,
no doubt I should have been as much perplexed, in some cases, as other
persons have been. [<italic>E</italic>, p. 21; emphasis added]</p>
            </disp-quote>  Here Darwin draws positive attention to the interpretive
relationship between word and image rather than justifying a reduction.
Among other things this means drawing attention to the medium itself,
which in this case is a set of photographs. Or more precisely it is
a report and discussion of an experiment designed around a set of
photographs. And what about that photograph of horror as it appears
in the book? It does not display horror as the woodcut might since
in this case horror is obviously extorted by way of galvanism, and
thus the photograph draws attention to its own staging. But don't
all of these images, including those in the described experiments,
stage emotion rather than instantiate some unmediated, face-to-face
emotional event of the sort considered paradigmatic by Ekman? At the
same time that Darwin exploits the reader's immediate reaction
to a woodcut of an orangutan or a photograph of galvanized horror,
he foregrounds by way of narrative the emotion's mediation and
thereby brackets the claim to some pure, face-to-face emotional experience.</p>
         <p>This digression into imagination also allows Darwin to discuss
emotions Ekman leaves off of his basic list, including love, sympathy,
hatred, suspicion, envy, jealousy, avarice, revenge, deceit, devotion,
slyness, guilt, vanity, conceit, ambition, pride, humility, and so
on. Indeed the antiquation we may find in Darwin's list, where
deceit and devotion are considered emotions, would suggest that human
and not just evolutionary history is essential to Darwin's science.
Witness Darwin on devotion:  <disp-quote>
               <p>A humble kneeling posture, with the hands upturned and palms joined
appears to us, from long habit, a gesture so appropriate to devotion,
that it might be thought to be innate; but I have not met with any
evidence to this effect with the various extra-European races of mankind.
During the classical period of Roman history it does not appear, as
I hear from an excellent classic[ist], that the hands were thus joined
during prayer. Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood has apparently given the true
explanation, though this implies that the attitude is one of slavish
subjection. “When the suppliant kneels and holds up his hands
with the palms joined, he represents a captive who proves the completeness
of his submission by offering up his hands to be bound by the victor.
It is the pictorial representation of the Latin <italic>dare manus</italic>, to signify submission.” Hence it is not probable that either
the uplifting of the eyes or the joining of the open hands, under
the influence of devotional feelings, are innate or truly expressive
actions; and this could hardly have been expected, for it is very
doubtful whether <italic>feelings, such as we should now rank as devotional</italic>, affected the hearts of men, whilst they remained during past ages
in an uncivilized condition. [<italic>E</italic>, p. 217; emphasis

            </disp-quote>  Civilization entails, apparently, a distinct emotional
regime that separates it from the uncivilized, thereby contradicting
an evolutionary theory that sees our continuity with Pleistocene hunter-gatherers
but doesn't see the distortions inevitably imposed by our interpretive
lens. According to Darwin we need historical narratives (however dubious
in this instance), first, to denaturalize what might appear to be
an innate feeling such as devotion, and, second, to explain in positive
terms a feeling that we might experience and observe as universal.
This is Darwin's skeptical work. Darwin's historical work
is part and parcel of his careful scientific observation; without
it the we of his first audience would naturalize some particular posture
and thereby see the emotional phenomenon poorly. Meanwhile the we
of his universal audience fails to recognize a particular posture
at all, which is itself crucial data revealed by way of comparative
anthropology and human history. In his microstudy of devotion and
other emotions, Darwin takes into account the emotion's linguistic
and visual mediation, its occasion in the service of a pointed argument,
and personal perspectives of varying historical immediacy. That is
to say, again, that Darwin's scientific theory of emotion is
inherently rhetorical, which is a methodological strength instead
of a weakness. Of course, Ekman would ignore a phenomenon like devotion
altogether.</p>
         <p>And what about love? We can return to Darwin in our effort to expose
the sleight of hand where Ekman offers the feeling of disgust as the
model for all emotions while elsewhere he defines “all emotions”
so narrowly that the list excludes love and hate amongst others. “No
emotion is stronger than maternal love,” qualifies Darwin in
a Victorian mood, “but a mother may feel deepest love for her
helpless infant, and yet not show it any outward sign” (<italic>E</italic>, p. 82). Indeed, Darwin doubts whether a long list of
what he calls complex states of mind are revealed by any fixed expression
and are sufficiently distinct to be described or delineated in strictly
scientific terms. But unlike Ekman, Darwin turns to the literary humanities
for a demonstration of how any science of emotion must ultimately
make room for interpretation. “When Shakespeare speaks of envy
as <italic>lean-faced</italic>, or <italic>black</italic>, or <italic>pale</italic>, and jealousy as “<italic>the green-eyed monster</italic>”; and when Spenser describes suspicion as “<italic>foul
ill-favoured</italic>, <italic>and grim</italic>,” they must
have felt this difficulty. Nevertheless, the above feelings—at
least many of them—can be detected by the eye; for instance,
conceit; but we are often guided in a much greater degree than we
suppose by our previous knowledge of the persons or circumstances”
(<italic>E</italic>, p. 260).</p>
         <p>Ekman recognizes this complication but circumvents the implications
by relabeling everything beyond his seven basic emotions “affective
commitments.” “Emotions are brief and episodic, lasting
seconds or minutes” explains Ekman. “Parental love, romantic
love, hatred, envy or jealousy last for much longer periods—months,
years, a lifetime for love and hatred, and at least hours or days
for envy and jealousy. In each of these there is a strong commitment,
an important attachment (negatively in the case of hatred, envy and
jealousy). They also differ from emotions in specifying something
about the cast of characters involved” (“C,” p.
83).</p>
         <p>Of course, in noting how the cast of characters is essential to
the composition of supposed nonemotions Ekman seems to invoke Aristotle's
famous discussion of the emotions in book 2 of the <italic>Rhetoric</italic>. Darwin, by contrast, writes long and fascinating Aristotelian passages
where the cast of characters that compose an emotion are specified
in their complex sociopolitical relations. Take, for instance, Darwin
on hatred:  <disp-quote>
               <p>If we have suffered or expect to suffer some wilful injury from
a man, or if he is in any way offensive to us, we dislike him; and
dislike easily rises into hatred. Such feelings, if experienced in
a moderate degree, are not clearly expressed by any movement of the
body or features, excepting perhaps by a certain gravity of behaviour,
or by some ill-temper. Few individuals, however, can long reflect
about a hated person, without feeling and exhibiting signs of indignation
or rage. But if the offending person be quite insignificant, we experience
merely disdain or contempt. If, on the other hand, he is all-powerful,
then hatred passes into terror, as when a slave thinks about a cruel
master, or a savage about a bloodthirsty malignant deity. [<italic>E</italic>, p. 234]</p>
            </disp-quote>  So in this case and others like it the very experience
of an emotion, according to Darwin, depends upon the social and not
the biological situation, namely, the relative significance of the
characters involved—including the subjective perception of such—which
can be systematically distorted, of course, by hegemonic constructs
including racism and patriarchy.26 By way of grammatically loaded micronarratives Darwin, like Aristotle,
takes into account the uneven social relationships that instantiate
an occasion for hatred (having suffered), the phenomenological time
of hatred (expecting to suffer), and the intentionality of hatred
(as a function of willful injury not accident). There is no way a
facial expression or brain scan can adequately represent an emotion
like hatred, and simply defining it like Ekman as nonemotional begs
the question.</p>
         <p>Finally, when Darwin wishes to discuss these so-called inactive
emotions he again finds recourse in the visual arts and literature,
and not just as a repository for accidental wisdom in the manner of
Damasio, who also likes to quote Shakespeare, but rather as a necessary
component of a larger theory. Consider the famous first-century sculpture
(fig. 6) where Laocoön
has been variously considered “bellowing” like a bull <italic>(mugitus)</italic> by Virgil,27 “noble” <italic>(edle)</italic> by J. J. Winckelmann,28 “groaning” by G. E.
Lessing,29 and silently struggling
by Charles Bell, whose book <italic>The Anatomy and Philosophy of
Expression as Connected with the Fine Arts</italic> served as Darwin's
polemical foil.30 In Bell's <italic>Anatomy</italic>, Darwin found a sketch that he relies on to invoke
Lessing's famous argument that the visual arts must disperse
violent emotions (fig. 7). Visual
arts provide an insufficient venue for the scientific study of emotion,
warns Darwin, because just as Lessing suggested, contracted facial
muscles destroy beauty.</p>

         <p>Insufficient, yes, but still necessary in a rich research program
where one is obligated to analyze emotion beyond measurable facial
expressions. As in literary narrative, where an emotion such as hatred
can only emerge through a cast of characters, in the visual arts “the
story of the composition is generally told with wonderful force and
truth by skillfully given accessories” both human and nonhuman,
animate and inanimate, foregrounded and backgrounded (<italic>E</italic>, p. 22).31 In this case the
skillfully given accessory of the sea serpent is crucial for any justifiable
interpretation of the emotion represented, for we are not talking
about orgasmic ecstasy after all.32 Other key accessories that tell this emotional tale “truthfully”
include Laocoön's two sons perishing beside him, who thereby
force the scene beyond the emotions of noble self-sacrifice that otherwise
might make the figure look resolute. And ultimately these immediate
characters and accessories offered up to the eye emerge only against
the receding background of mythical characters that include the vengeful
Apollo, who is punishing his disobedient priest, and the Trojan people
for whom Laocoön sacrificed himself by warning them of gift-bearing
Greeks.</p>
         <p>So where is the emotion (fig. 8)? Is it simply in that first face as the Ekman experiment insists?
I offer the joystick in case you are thrown by the anthropomorphism
of a smile on the middle image, but in fact I think the McDonald's
Happy Meal provides an efficient countermodel to Ekman's pseudo-Darwinian
program. After all, the Happy Meal is much more than a burger, fries,
drink, and plastic toy, more than simply an emotionally competent
object (like Ekman's delicacy) triggering happy faces like the
one next to it. Rather the Happy Meal is an emotional artifact seemingly
untethered to—Marx would say alienated from—the complex
social transactions that produced it. So instead of turning toward
Ekman as the supposed champion in our day, I heretically prefer to
imagine Darwin turning toward his contemporary Marx as he says in
this case an accessory that tells the emotional tale that has apparently
taken on a life of its own. I think revisiting Darwin's work
on emotion suggests this turn to sociorhetorical analysis is at least
as plausible as the other.</p>

         <p>In his recent foreword to Andy Clark's <italic>Supersizing
the Mind: Embodiment, Action, and Cognitive Extension</italic>, David
Chalmers suggests we might also research extended desires, extended
reasoning, extended perception, extended imagination, and “extended
emotions.”33 “One
might have something akin to an extended mood, if not an extended
emotion, when one's environment is always nudging one toward
happiness or sadness,” offers Chalmers by way of example,34 and certain Extended Mind (EM)
theorists such as No|$$|Ade have begun to work in this direction. “In
the Beginning Was the Situation” offers Noë, “not
some Cartesian computing machine that builds up internal pictures
of the scene, makes plans, and executes them” (<italic>O</italic>, p. 101). Moreover these “situations” are profoundly
characterized by emotion according to Noë. If, for instance,
a psychologist is trying to understand why an infant will become distressed
when his or her mother becomes still or impassive, that psychologist
would go astray in positing the infant as a separate individual observing
the mother. Instead we should consider the mother as “literally
one of the structures constituting a child's psychological landscape.”
The baby's relation to the other unfolds in “an emotional
setting” (<italic>O</italic>, p. 31). Likewise, Hubert Dreyfus—an
influential EM theorist in the tradition of philosophical phenomenology—argues
that any artificial intelligence project designed to approach humanness
must account for emotional settings, and to do so it would need “a
model of <italic>our particular way of being embedded and embodied</italic> such that what we experience is significant for us in the particular
way that it is. That is, we would have to include in our program a
model of a body very much like ours with our needs, desires, pleasures,
pains, ways of moving, cultural background, etc.”35 But for all this interest in emotional
and cognitive settings and situations, EM theorists like Dreyfus,
Chalmers, Clark, Wheeler, Thompson, and Noë come up short when
describing this worldly side of the brain-body-world nexus. To put
it bluntly, in the spirit of Darwin they too need the arts and literature.
Since sentimental literature is ground zero for the Cognitive Approaches
movement, I conclude by reading a passage from Sterne's <italic>A Sentimental Journey through France and Italy</italic>, which is
a masterful study of emotional situations of a certain sort.</p>
         <p>As Sterne's character Yorick travels through the treacherous
mountains between Turin and Savoy, he reports how a journey that is
potentially horrible fares better with unhurried sentiments giving
way to this observation of peasants encountered en route:  <disp-quote>
               <p>Poor, patient, quiet, honest people! fear not: your poverty, the
treasury of your simple virtues, will not be envied you by the world,
nor will your valleys be invaded by it.—Nature! in the midst
of thy disorders, thou art still friendly to the scantiness thou hast
created—with all thy great works about thee, little hast thou
left to give, either to the scythe or to the sickle—but to that
little thou grantest safety and protection; and sweet … dwellings
which stand so shelter'd.36</p>
            </disp-quote>  Nowhere in this scene do we find suggestive documentation
of face-to-face encounters; in fact, the pathos of this scene thrives
on a variety of distancing mechanisms familiar to the landscape artist
and the critical theorist, respectively. At the very least Yorick's
pity for the peasants must be understood in contrast to the geographical
horror it supersedes, exceeding thereby Steven Pinker's literary
Darwinism where the novel is “cheesecake for the mind”
and novelistic fear provides an opportunity for a virtual experience
of a situation better avoided in real life.37 Immediately following upon a “feast of love”
at the table of a large and respectful French peasant family (<italic>S</italic>, p. 119), this scene of partial spectatorship restages
the classically tragic sequence that moves from horror to pity as
a critical opportunity (as we will see below), not as a virtual experience.
Yorick's pitiful perspective can only be understood against a
romanticized landscape that includes—along with sweet dwellings—“poor,
patient, quiet, honest people” who would no doubt have a very
different perspective on the situation, if asked. And I imagine most
of this situational complexity, including its class element, is not
lost on the ingenious author, who earlier outlines the terms of a “sentimental
commerce” in which sentiment is produced not by natural immediacy
but by the imbalance of social exchange (<italic>S</italic>, p. 9).</p>
         <p>Certainly knowing “<italic>whose sentiment it is</italic>” constitutes a crucial aspect of our understanding of the
psychological dynamics of this particular scene and the novel as a
whole, as another cognitivist Lisa Zunshine might insist.38 But if, like Zunshine, we assume
that our own reading mind and the “mind behind the sentiment”
functions like a Cartesian computing machine “managing information
and generating metarepresentations” then we desensitize ourselves
to the relevant cultural institutions of language and perception,
and a scene like this can be reduced to “imagined landscapes
with their pathetic fallacies, personifications, and anthropomorphizing.”39 Contra Howard, these words on the
page do not produce in the reader “pulse, beats and sobs”
that radically contract the distance between narrated events and the
moment of their reading (though some of Sterne's racier moments
admittedly do, for this reader at least). Quite the opposite; by way
of negation Sterne stages the empathic moment with his typical irony
that suggests we take no emotion at face value.</p>
         <p>Fear <italic>not</italic>, envied <italic>not</italic>. What do
negated emotions feel like after all? Look like? Where might they
be mapped in the brain? It turns out that the most emotionally pregnant
words in the passage—<italic>fear</italic> and <italic>envy</italic>—appear only in negation, which blocks the royal road to experience
we might very well expect on a sentimental journey. The straightforward
injunction, “Poor, patient, quiet, honest people! <italic>rejoice</italic>” would have been the more immediate solution Sterne avoids
in favor of his negation that invokes a particular “world”
at the same time that it forces us (in Darwinian fashion) to account
for our own perspective in the effort to map the emotional terrain. “Poor
people,” “scythe” or “sickle,” “sweet …
dwellings,” “valleys,” “an unenvious world.”
In our Darwinian account emotion maps these relationships (character,
tool, dwelling, landscape, world), always considering the framework
itself as a factor in the equation: from rhetorical criticism to critical
ecology.</p>
         <p>Where is the mind in this passage and how does it work? As an EM
theorist might say, the mind is a critical component of the world,
composed in particular (but not infinitely variable) ways. Here the “world”
does not envy the poor; it disregards the simple virtues and avoids
the valley, as does Yorick himself. So this passage characterizes
Yorick's mind-world, which he shares (in part) with certain others
like the lady he next encounters (see <italic>S</italic>, p. 121),
but less so with the poor. However, Yorick explicitly disavows such
characterization—a world of brutal gentrification after all—instead
throwing in his lot with friendly “Nature,” before passing
by the scene untouched, relieved of the geographical terror he faced
on high. Hypocrisy yes, but that's not the end of it. The mind
of this scene is never comfortably embedded in the scenery (pace EM
theory) nor is it detached (pace CAL); it is practically situated
but <italic>uncomfortably</italic> so, which points us to another
order of the emotional phenomenon, where the author and reader appear
on the scene. This is the critical moment, essential for reading literature
and for reading faces, as Darwin insisted. Emotional phenomena do
not announce themselves unequivocally. Indeterminacy (but not radical
indeterminacy) must be in-built for the phenomenon to emerge as emotional
in the first place.</p>
         <p>What might this story look like from the perspective of evolutionary
biology? Would it not be advantageous if we all wore our emotions
on our sleeves, so to speak, or plastered to our foreheads so anyone
could read them without equivocation, like the Ekman fantasy, or if
they were available by way of Vulcan mind meld, which would eradicate
the need for emotions at all, as the creators of Star Trek so cleverly
realized? Isn't emotional indeterminacy maladaptive, as evolutionary
biologists might say, a species trait that should have been selected
against over the long term in favor of more direct and ostensibly
more practical communication? Though here I cannot make the case in
detail, I can point out how Joan Roughgarden and others working on
biodiversity provide an alternative perspective more amenable to our
skeptical Darwin and the revised conciliance he can offer. Instead
of selecting sexually for ideal types, argues Roughgarden, a species
needs “a balanced portfolio” of genes to survive over
the long term,40 and sex, which
entails a very wide (but not indefinite)41 range of behaviors—reproductive and otherwise—is
the <italic>social</italic> activity that continually rebalances a
species's overall genetic portfolio in the context of dynamic
environments. Instead of offering only background noise, indeterminacy
of the sign (as we might call it from the semiotic perspective, where
X is somewhere between attractive or repellent, pro- or antisocial,
praise or blameworthy, and so on) is compatible with biodiversity
precisely insofar as it constitutes the social. Antisocial eugenics
or cloning are Roughgarden's counterexamples; just like the computer
scientist knows that focusing only on the code while ignoring the
execution environment is a mistake, cloning biologists who focus on
the nucleus of the cell while ignoring the cytoplasm make the same
mistake insofar as they have ceased to work ecologically.42</p>
         <p>Consider, finally, one of Darwin's favorite subjects in <italic>Expression</italic>, the infant displaying “mental distress”
(fig. 9).43 He might be hungry, sleepy, gassy. Perhaps there
are a few more possibilities but not an infinite number, or at least
that's what we like to think. But wouldn't it be more practical,
more adaptive, if the label “hungry!” appeared on the
forehead of an emotional infant or if we could reliably read the infant's
mind? Why aren't we permanently sequestered in utero so that
all of these communication problems might be avoided in the first
place? In the spirit of Roughgarden we might observe that the semiotic
indeterminacy of emotional expression is a corollate of biodiversity
precisely because it necessitates communication; the work of triangulating
is never done nor should it be.</p>

         <p>We need the arts and literature to study emotion because they transpire
on the appropriate phenomenological level where experiences happen,
on the one hand, and where experience is characterized, on the other.
Just as we cannot understand bird flight by studying only feathers,
to cite Noë's example, we cannot understand emotional experience
by studying only the face, the eyeball, the ear, the brain (see <italic>O</italic>, p. 157). To understand experience beyond having it we
need human beings in the world characterized, which is to say we need
people in situations. And not just people in situations isolated for
the purpose of answering isolated questions in the mode of social
scientific inquiry, though this approach also has its limited utility.
Our people in situations should be subject to the maximum degree of
manipulation and critical scrutiny, reflection from inside and outside,
and subjected to all sorts of imaginative possibilities so that even
the complexities of experience that shimmer just beyond our immediate
grasp still can make their presence felt by way of tropes, like irony,
that help define our humanistic disciplines. As Darwin understood
over a century ago we need the arts and humanities for many reasons,
including for a science that can account both for the basic ways we
are and the ways we can be.</p>

things, Gilman tracks, through Darwin's correspondence with the
psychiatric physician James Crichton Browne, Darwin's increasing
skepticism about the utility of photographs expected to deliver stable
referents for the scientific study of emotion, especially insofar
as they might provide evidence for the insane and idiotic as the missing
link to our emotional past.</p>

               <p>For detailed treatment of Darwin's groundbreaking use of photography
in the <italic>Expression</italic>, see Phillip Prodger, <italic>Darwin's
Camera: Art and Photography in the Theory of Evolution</italic> (Oxford,
2009). Prodger underscores Darwin's “rhetorical abilities”
(p. 30), which extended to his incorporation of photographs in the <italic>Expression</italic>. Though like Ekman we tend to read the history
of photography retroactively, Prodger underscores how evidence and
illustration are blurred in the <italic>Expression</italic> because
there was essentially no precedent for the acceptance of photography
as scientific data. Like neighboring printed illustrations that recalled
earlier physiognomic and expressivist traditions (for example, Johann
Kaspar Lavater and Charles Le Brun respectively), photographs in the <italic>Expression</italic> “had to seem reasonable according to experience”
(p. 221) and therefore could be, implausibly, staged by an actor like
Oscar Gustav Rejlander himself. So instead of building the case for
their uncontaminated conditions of production as we now might expect,
Darwin instead focused his discussion of photography around the context
of reception, including his readers—a canonic rhetorical concern.</p>

Meanings</italic> (New Haven, Conn., 2007), p. 23. Kagan's quarrel
with the brain science of emotion in the tradition of Damasio/Ekman
highlights the irreducible relevance of personal expectation. Kagan
cites, for example, adults judging whether the facial expression of
a male or female face was happy or fearful. Their judgment took longer
because they did not expect to see photos of fearful men; see p. 63.
Also, like other brain structures the amygdala serves many functions,
so when scientists label the amygdala's response to the unexpected
appearance of faces with fearful expressions they must account for
the response uncertainty created by the cognitive effort needed to
classify the face or to understand why it was presented; see p. 70.
It is impossible to create in the laboratory human emotions as they
occur in “ecologically natural settings” summarizes Kagan
(p. 81), and therefore we have good reason to doubt conclusions about
the latter that depend on evidence produced in the former. For an
excellent and generously footnoted review of the Ekman controversy
with special attention to the critique of Ekman within the natural
and social scientific literature, see Ruth Leys, “How Did Fear

                     <p>I propose the following list of emotions: amusement, anger, contempt,
contentment, disgust, embarrassment, excitement, fear, guilt, pride
in achievement, relief, sadness/distress, satisfaction, sensory pleasure,
and shame. When it is remembered that each of these words denotes
a family of related emotions, then this list of 15 emotions is quite
expanded. Clearly, it omits some affective phenomena which others
have considered to be emotions. Guilt is a likely candidate, and I
have no reason to make a guess one way or another.</p>

               <p>Although I focus on CAL, a similar project is underway in art history

and Emotion,” in <italic>Wie sich Gefühle Ausdruck verschaffen:
Emotionen in Nahsicht</italic>, ed. Klaus Herding and Antje Krause-Wahl
(Berlin, 2007), pp. 17–51, and Freedberg and Vittorio Gallese, “Motion,
Emotion, and Empathy in Esthetic Experience,” <italic>Trends
in Cognitive Sciences</italic> 11, no. 5 (2007): 197–203. In
Freedberg's work, as in the CAL material examined here, Darwin's
complex understanding of emotional situations is restricted by placing
the <italic>Expression</italic> in the Ekman/Damasio trajectory along
with two other familiar touchpoints—primatologist Frans B. M.
de Waal's work on bonobo empathy and the recent discovery of
mirror neurons. Freedberg can thus reach the unlikely conclusion that
in Aby Warburg's <italic>Pathosformel</italic> “the outward
forms of movement in a work revealed the inner emotions of the figure
concerned” (Freedberg, “Empathy, Motion, and Emotion,”
p. 25). In fact the opposite is true; Warburg's <italic>Pathosformel</italic> is about the “accessory in motion” <italic>(bewegtes
Beiwerk)</italic>, like the wind-hair-draperies of Botticelli's <italic>Primavera</italic>, as a dynamic historical formula. For a discussion

               <p>Though distinct from extended-mind philosophers who typically cite
artificial intelligence research, not linguistic research, practitioners
of “cognitive rhetoric” drawing on the work of Lakoff,
Turner, and others have produced some interesting lexical analyses
of literature and a perspective in some ways sympathetic with mine
insofar as it would endorse this passage from Turner: <disp-quote>
                     <p>What can be recruited to mental work depends on social and cultural
location. Parts of the repertoire are common and can be assumed for
any audience, while other parts are special to special communities
or special situations. Consequently, it is a basic principle of rhetorical
theory that what works in one situation may not work in another. One
of Aristotle's definitions of rhetoric is: “the mental
ability to see the available means of persuasion <italic>in any particular
situation.</italic>” [Mark Turner, “Toward the Founding
of Cognitive Social Science,” <italic>Chronicle of Higher Education</italic>, 5 Oct. 2001, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri"
