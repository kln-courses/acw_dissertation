<plain_text><page sequence="1">Rachel Blau DuPlessis Draft 49: Turns and Turns, an Interpretation Turns I was walking through woods spring-strewn green sodden to follow a spry, disabled woman. It's clear from the tone a dream of climbing backward on a trestle over stressed woods. History and class turn up in films as smudges on, basically, clothing but gender appears in the tinkle of mannerist sincerity &amp; depression. I am inside a dream without cinematic protection. Intricate, ambivalent walking or taking a train was it dark coach bridge-work leaving another life behind, the tunnel the selved-city too much geography too many sites plus nothing has happened except the sardonic; characters are dim, yet gathering, their collective querelousness turns toward limpid salvationary figures: "Goddess of Mercy" "Big Woman" or "horizons released from bondage" "the ocean held back by a few logs." Variables: an I, a spry turning out energy hand over hand on the intricate ladders and rope-sways of infrastructure climbing inside mechanisms the very catwalks and rusted joists wood or iron-clad bridges of ideology. Splinters in hands meant it was splintering that rusty allegorical stain of oxidized iron. Laughing triumphantly it was understood! suddenly expected! hands on the machinery! What vows can then result? Dark tunnel of an unusual train of thought. Deeper and deeper (so long ago) into the neglected train station How much deeper to have to go? That kind of query propels its own answer: enormous curiosity as if the solid existence of tracks bridges tunnels walks climbs plural nouns abruptly turned into verbs. Acts demanding continuance. Have no idea what stop I am Feminist Studies 30, no. 1 (Spring 2004). @ 2004 by Rachel Blau DuPlessis 33</page><page sequence="2">34 Rachel Blau DuPlessis but did not stop. Everything turned inside out. Shifts so large got mapped on contradictory coordinates by sheaves of metaphor: hunger blood quilts &amp; piecing empty luminous books silence and layers unspoken glottal stops, blocks in the throat reflux revulsion acid alimentary (engorgement and Overflowing) re-visionary Seeing self-Birthing Flying Delivering Cracking. Participials parturient. Thus we found another side to the "wall," a space breathtaking of the "we." Palpable, it appeared. "We take the woman's side in everything." Throws of chance in all revolution enlarge intensities of claim. In the throes. Was it same "subjectivity" or altered? Was it every female self her own messiah? The swollen clitoris of the mother? Was it mirror turning into lens and laughing? was it smash and denial? I was angry at my sister; who is my sister we enter a dark chamber. Wild horses dragged between us lacunae of embattled twinships. Noveremember, decemb- manifesto after manifesto. What somber depths and quick decisions what exclamations leaping, there were many driving fast inside the array and we turned, we turned the wheel! Intensely restless, gleeful, restless, I am not getting the force of it in, the rebuff, the clarity, in. "Women's liberation members demand full rights for the once frail sex" said Newsweek. "Once frail"-a nice turn. Someone is photographed holding a sign. She is sneeringly "ugly" a fact we recognize and are proud that some can garner that level of slander. Or they said this "feminism" is polemical- or "we knew it already it is not such a big revelation no particular surprise. Ho hum." I listened to "I couldn't get it through her head!" I heard someone say he needs more time alone than his wife Why? "Because she takes tranquilizers." The instruction to "record the ordinary." The ordinary! scarce are these words out! it was ordinary as mythic and then real again. Conflictual overload turned compasses to spin. "Normal" got suspiciously turned on. Pregnancy coupled with dreams of my penis. All genders on stage half reversed played "Transvestite Street Theater." Outside hostile job-related putdowns pre-clipped advice from other women why don't you want to be a woman you need to play woman You could look good why do you want to look like to act like to dress like a man. Conversely they'll get you so don't ever acknowledge you're a woman. There were many</page><page sequence="3">Rachel Blau DuPlessis 35 words like that wounds like that and other careful tricks of soured milk. "Gals Squeal for Repeal." Can choose to investigate. Everyone grappled through the deep wide open outspun "social and historical dimensions of our innermost selves." Moved speechless between each word I turn page upon page look for "diagnosis" for "justice" in the scintillating swirl and snarl of mixed paths and junctures. Here is something! women propelled with analytic rages every day. "Adventurous for him" turns "careless for me." "Prolific for him" comes to "facile for me." He is opinionated but I am hectoring; he passionate, I strident. We see, we see, we see! "We are demanding an end to hypocrisy!" The political trace of quotidian facts and odd events splits and refracts. We took X-rays of each moment, bitterly, decidedly penetrating bone. Sitting in a room musically calling inside hope &amp; inside longing, Concepts could be laughed "off the face of the earth," we thought Authority was up for proof; Turn texts and stats to rips and jabs, with cartoon joy, the Pow! the Wow. Shaking some thought "upside down" till all the change fell out, Riding dark swells of grief and mourning for the Lost it was felt simultaneously as unquenchable. Roar comes in as fast as rushing tidal bore, such unstoppable upsurge of collective Desire. Thunder far behind sky, behind sky, the screen of all former projections: To want to rise up! and Change the Orders of selves, events, powers. Turn time to us. Do what needed to be done in Now and Time To Come. Hunger of incipience perpetual. Inner experience as social territory Fresh map in front of where I was. So the vagina did erect a banner opened even like a peony with lacy labial ruffle a red red female stain the blood of markedness on this door. If six end words repeated, this would be a sestina but it isn't. Just a turning woman in it, her trains, rooms, hungers, woods all became mantic. Inside her body-mind, great gashes cunicular passages mind-blood pumping, nourishing all thoughts, all orifices inside this person formerly pink with sparkle stars silvery from targeted markets, formerly little girl holding "Barbie" TM doll, half-heartedly sucking it. Thus we said Sisters. Said Androgynous Realism. We said Women! this turned enormous. Mending a "professional" autopsy done by manic doctors. What with "fragmentation, doubling, solarization brulage, enlargement, and cropping" the female body had been in a constant state of mainly (so we took it) negative transformation. First, the mend was "wholeness" but intensely interesting that "in each fragment there are different protagonists." So, second, might investigate</page><page sequence="4">36 Rachel Blau DuPlessis "fluctuations in the particles," the thing grammar calls "I" but never is. Periodic rage of the elements. What am I? why is this? can I generalize? Again the question of pronouns. After so much "I" to turn, to erupt into "We" with its peculiar shadow "They." Who was this "They" how did it get constituted? what was the difference between explode and struggle? Who was inside "We" and who was absent? "Who sits at the table when policy gets set?" "Who" turned upon the question of who (in any case) was "the invisible." We each flooded with the rips and tears, the tides of multiple women plus there was the refusal ever again to be "a woman." I am darting needling, thru the febrile network of definitions. Feel polemical kinship with many positions. Who is "We" if "I" is split? What is your class overview? "Which men is it that women want to be equal to?" The bells rang from dawn to dusk and into night pulled by women tolled by women solid shim of sound ringing in consciousness. Which women? What would constitute political fulfillment? Is intelligent ecstasy a permanent institution? Could it turn out to be? Rage of urgency, rubble of loss. Is anything I've said true? Camera panning onto sphinx a kind of shrieking music and evocative repetition. "It was the idea of breaking the law -of 'woman'- of the category itself that made me delirious." To be women breaking into Woman as different women. Ethic of freedom! The world is what it fully is, as if "as if!" we turned to actions only accountable for the meanings we wanted forever now framed and insistent. As if we acted with authority and power molten, inexorable for the very first time. Co-workers in gender a crowded shouting space teeming with rebuff and counterpoint with grip and pivot; turning eros and politics into helixed arousals. "Fury fury! fused" joy and its price We hardly thought of that at first. What didn't we want! "To get the word male out of the Constitution cost the women of this country 52 years of pauseless campaign." So I was moving unreasonable, and with you wayward &amp; winged in roaring runoff through interlocking dream spaces tracks and stairs tunnel darks &amp; trestle scarps along a walking river. I've wanted to write you many years write many years unrolling hopes and losses. Ethic of commitment made by struggle! Stun of the "Vesuvian Face," skepticism pouring thru the utopian. By turns reckless and careful, we are social conduits, given "to imagine new forms of collective good."</page><page sequence="5">Rachel Blau DuPlessis 37 I wanted to write an imploded poem of this. I wanted lines turning, in linked gasps, on hinges as if from a visible silence yet palpable yearning. I wanted an imperfect artwork exhibiting striations of historical processes these objects that store my labor pouring from themselves milk of the milk: resistant understanding. I wanted to ride the cusp of antithetical turbulence. So be it. Came to a time in which a homeless woman warmed herself at a lecture on Mallarm6 or Marinetti in red knit cap hard pissed-off face among the denizens of academe and theory with their well- turned clothes and hard-won forcefulness. Turning point after turning point who can avoid irony? Hungry angry woman in her stinking jacket listening to the discourse. The roar of the missing. Stalemate. Shacks by the side of the road, texture fraying, immiseration. What has happened? "Accountable" Order as scandal and cunning. Nowhere to turn. Workers as if jailed this "Free Trade Zone" making my gym-wear. We outline sullen analyses and analytic resignations but there is no assent. The walls of most narratives lock down. And now? In the dream I was travelling in "Hungary" amused by this and desperate even while dreaming, journey near, or here want to change this life where I am breathless the smallest dawn turns to damage for I saw them hungry awe-struck and they sat and ate were fed some said yet still and at the table their wild grasping unforgiving hungers they ate and ate and did not stop. Supposed to stop and wouldn't refusal of rule. Are they needy or greedy this dream-event embarrassing frightening a shelter in which there is no shelter. "Elsewhere" turns into here; Hungary is hungry I am watched &amp; watching shamed &amp; implicated; they are grabbing should stop but will not They are powerless &amp; powerful this is a contradictory story of "exploratory restless movement" and unfulfilled desire. Now what? So much damage need I resign myself? lose every hope and gain? This work cannot be "unified" nor end on literary uplift on satisfying readiness. "What kind of misery produced the fruit I eat we are literally eating unhappiness and suffering." Here it is this staggering life where dreams insist it's they make something known before we know it. Do not turn away.</page><page sequence="6">38 Rachel Blau DuPlessis Turns, an Interpretation or "To write history is so difficult that most historians are forced to make concessions to the technique of legend." Erich Auerbach, Mimesis Deeper and deeper into the "rejected" train station-was that word maybe "neglected"? How much further do I have to go on stairways to a level decidedly below all the other levels? Two doubles, double double, compelled by women. I journey in the company of women. Over so many years. Yet never establishing six words of the New Life this Volta Nuova to organize into sestina. Besides I don't have the skill. It is difficult enough even claiming a "political poem" given I am hardly writing "to program," with any correct itinerary or conclusion. Could only propose gender justice in the context of social justice enacted in particular struggle or location. Those six words (gender, justice, social, struggle, location, enacted) might trace through the poem, and be repeated there, but to use them as such was too positive, positivist. I did not use them. What I wanted was an openly "negative" poem turning on contradictory feelings, the ungainliness of those edgy feelings, the fullness of what happened, but symbolized distantly. Not one "side," but the "technique of legend." For "the historical comprises a great number of contradictory motives in each individual, a hesitation and ambiguous groping on the part of groups." Ongoing urgency, choice and act. Unintended consequence, debates about fact. Besides, "the woman's side," the "other-side of everything"- emerged with full force,</page><page sequence="7">Rachel Blau DuPlessis 39 yet before that binary, there was another kind of start- a sense ofjuncted tracks, woven intersections, knotted lines with all their merges, switches, turns. Metaphor? tracks are one. They indicate the specific cuts situated, cities -which chosen, which excluded-payoffs and geographies, zeals, mains, needs, political fat and insider deals, the whole history of contingencies that got frozen into "tracks" and their "right of way." Yet tracks was simply meant to indicate snarls of competing forces set in play. Metaphor? a snarl some of whose knots have been pulled so close and tight and hard, the rough, the smooth, the sleek, the rotted that one is compelled to act. But how? Unpick the knot? or cut? or both? and splice? Perhaps it's not a knot. No metaphor is right. And hence this so-called poem suspects them, too much, too many, rough and ready, uneven, demanding, illogical, not prettied or curried in the manner of good poems. The other problem is rhetorical. Thoughts' twisting, powers of institutions, women, gender, painfulness and pride, determination, arousal, change, imbrication of practices- Encompassing this in any mono-directional mode (sequence, poem, unrolling scroll) falsifies the force of it. The sliding palimpsests of multiple turns and overlay (piles, alternatives, collage, chord chunks, stacks, debates) cannot be contained that way, threaded athwart time- sequencing is true, but also lies. We are left in formal contradiction to match the political. But more problematic still what is the form for motion, what is the form for dialectical shim, for self-quarreling and readjustment-serious, humorous? It's seriality: its quick shifts and sectors, its questions at each moment of articulation,</page><page sequence="8">40 Rachel Blau DuPlessis its thought tacking and turning back and forth, its reconsidered directions and vectors. Plus seriality is not "positive." What single message from "Of Being Numerous"? One needs edge to articulate difference words into juncture, metaphor into resistance, edge to travel on its wrinkling path. Intense imbeddings of syntactic turns across any line and lines, those twists and cadences, are ways of dropping densities down deep, wedged and productive, into the wraith and way of extensives. Deeper and deeper into the multiplexed train station! Simultaneity! simultaneity! inside History! which is ongoing! Displacing oneself "geopolitically." Doubled doubles. I can hardly do it. I can't pin down exactly what I want except the form of conviction. So longing and lingering, I slide away from lyric, away from myth, away from narrative into the wilds of segmentivity, trying for motion and telling, for engagement and toll marked simultaneously. There is no one genre, no title for this dialectical complication except maybe "Essay" honoring any obdurate trying. But forget "Essay, an Interpretation" an academic parody! For apart from the allusion to Zukofsky's political sestina, I can no longer, straight-faced, say "interpretation" regarding my own poem, but neither could LZ, I'm certain. -Peter notes that LZ wrote it because WCW did not "understand" "Mantis," although in Greek the title does mean "prophet." Mantis as "the poor," portal to a new world. So Zukofsky glossed his poem a little bit to show Williams some of what went into it, line by line. Which gloss, in its impact, considering the obscurity left, is deeply and seriously fond. Because it explains almost nothing but ungainly thought as passionate yearning. Sestinas have a mother-board twice as slow as any other poem,</page><page sequence="9">Rachel Blau DuPlessis 41 that thing it uses to talk to its memory of the turns and snarls of obsession. The great arc of time, the shell-rich limestone, the stone hidden, shadowy, in grass, frustrated intensities of desire, trace there, but Dante's spring-cool woman gets recast- flying an updraft in a station of the subway at Zukofsky's squeamishness stil novisti lady emergent as awkward insect, a bright mantis, limbs gawky, green as the new. But still the issue of the bitten head comes through- her capacity, her sexual act, his loss-like some anthropomorphic cliche about gender at the heart of his political poem. Of any poem. Been there! Heard that! We need a different culture of, for, in, through, outside gender- shape every preposition anew. The swirl of his words and the condensations of impacted metaphysical metaphor reveal such confusions of action at the end that one cannot tell who causes, who effects, what happens, what will happen, who has done it, will it occur, what it would take to "Save it!" save what, with what, and how. This is just to say it's precisely a political poem in its hyper-speedy turns of hope and wariness: and equally mixed and powerful are thoughts, in a responsive, frightened head, continued in his interpreting "Head," his talking head. Where is this heading? What is to be done, doubles. Redoubles. "Feeling this what should be the form" adequate to this "ungainliness" (LZ), given that any choice modifies other choice. The full impact is multiple terrific arousals to the unsortable torsion of choices, expressing, however inadequately, convictions, about Act, Agency, Pressure, Strategy, Power. Facing others also in motion. Out of all this came: making a path, or paths. Later institutionalized (women's centers, PACs, protocols, shelters, journals, clinics, gender studies programs) each staffed, struggled for, funded hardily, or hardly, and professional services, careers, spokeswomen. Dinners, at which so-and-so is honored.</page><page sequence="10">42 Rachel Blau DuPlessis All this from stubborn commitment. An ethical vision amid compromise. The moment when you say no, you will not, the moment when you say yes, you will. Choose and choose again. Uneven blasts blowing. It is time, turning. In time is what I am writing. In the midst of this site to feel at once aroused, on fire and squelched. O originary passion for justice and rectification clinging tight even when buffeted. Rebuffed. The hands hold, gnarled, hurt, stubborn. The spark glimmers in the windy cavern of fear and the implausible. I can feel, at the other side of writing the futility of writing in general, and of this writing. To capture 6clat, to expose conviction, to pressure the moments of transformation, to speak of the struggles and practices that result, the concerns and modifications, each "mediated through the others in the form of historically specific embodiments"- is almost impossible. It is almost impossible to tell of those enormous encompassing Turns.
