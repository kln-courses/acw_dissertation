In the English-speaking world, we are now seeing the  fruits of a mature critical tradition, the result of several generations of Nietzsche scholarship. And  not only is present scholarship informed by the work of Kaufmann, Hollingdale, and Danto and  by Clark, Richardson, and Poellner, but it also now rests on the broader foundation of Heidegger,  Jaspers, and Deleuze, on the one hand, and Frege, Russell, and Quine, on the other. That is, to be a  Nietzsche scholar today is to enjoy the concrescence of the major traditions of Western philosophy  and a new generation of active young scholars at a point, in Nietzsche, where Western thought lifted  up one of its most brilliant and exciting minds. It is perhaps a measure of Nietzsche’s profound and  enigmatic thought that it is fully responding only now to the combined resources of Continental and  analytic traditions elaborated in both historical and contemporary works.   Tsarina Doyle’s recent N ietzsche on Epistemology and Metaphysics: The World in View is a  case in point. Doyle contributes to a sharp, developing analysis of Nietzsche’s central metaphysical  and epistemological views as they inform our basic understanding of empirical knowledge and the  material order around us. The heart of the issue is of course the problem of human access to physical  and metaphysical reality, where this problem is vexed by the threat of dogmatism on the one side  and skepticism on the other. Perhaps the key figure in this struggle has been Kant, whose critical  philosophy promised the nondogmatic defeat of skepticism by incorporation of the empirical into  the ideal. Whether Kant avoided either threat remains controversial, but reference to his account is  a primary avenue of approach to the issue. Nietzsche himself took Kant as his primary epistemo- logical and metaphysical antipode, “a strong magnifying glass” with which to address the issue of  human knowledge of reality (1, citing E H “Why I am so Wise” 7), and this relationship with Kant  is the subject of Doyle’s discussion. In the following, I summarize Doyle’s argument and conclude  with some evaluative remarks.   Doyle’s study focuses on the heart of Nietzsche’s metaphysics and epistemology and in par- ticular on the relationship between his will to power thesis and his perspectivism. The relationship  between these two central elements of Nietzsche’s thought has long been a source of controversy  among Nietzsche scholars, and while prominent scholars such as Arthur Danto and Maudemarie  Clark have found the two doctrines to be in conflict, Doyle offers an interpretation in which the  will to power is precisely the metaphysical vehicle required to validate Nietzsche’s perspectiv- ism. In order to demonstrate this, Doyle first examines Nietzsche’s perspectivism as reflected in  his intellectual relationship with Kant. Doyle’s Nietzsche embraces Kant’s Copernican turn but  sees Kant as falling short of his own mark, particularly in his critical philosophy, wherein the   Ding-an-Sich constitutes the defeat of anthropologized empirical science. For Doyle, Nietzsche’s  epistemological goal is to establish the possibility of objective, empirical knowledge within the  context of a Kantian anthropomorphism. An important feature of this position is the rejection of  “metaphysical realism,” the doctrine of a n-sich reality or perspective-free truth. If there is no such  thing, then objectivity must be recast, if possible, in contextualist terms. Doyle calls “internal  realism” the resulting position in which knowledge claims are constrained by the terms of the  perspective informing them. 1     A welcome addition to this discussion is Doyle’s examination of Nietzsche’s early work, includ- ing  The Birth of Tragedy and the oft-cited “On Truth and Lies in an Extra-Moral Sense.” Here, Doyle  sees Nietzsche’s internal realism as not yet formed but struggling to emerge. Contrary to Clark and  others, Doyle sees T L as exceptional to, rather than representative of, Nietzsche’s epistemology  JOURNAL OF NIETZSCHE STUDIES, Issue 41, 2011.

She presents B T and other early  notes as prefiguring the will to power thesis that will ultimately reconcile self to world: a reciprocal  rather than oppositional reading of the Apollo–Dionysos relationship suggests a cohesion rather  than opposition between reason and intuition; and the notion of a universal, primordial intellect  suggests the unity of self and world.   As above, Nietzsche’s will to power thesis has been thought by some to be incompatible with  his perspectivism. Some have thus argued that Nietzsche doesn’t offer the former as a metaphysical  thesis, while others have concluded that Nietzsche’s overall position is simply untenable. Doyle  argues that both interpretations are mistaken. The key question, on her account, is whether objec- tivity must be understood to entail the absence of perspective, as is commonly thought. But the  notion of a perspective-free truth is incoherent, as Doyle reads Nietzsche, so if we are to preserve  an objective/subjective distinction, both must be construed in perspectival terms. Thus, on Doyle’s  account, Nietzsche thinks that a perspectival account may be judged objective if it can be shown to  be “comprehensive,” i.e., congruent with multiple perspectives. It is here that Nietzsche’s will to  power thesis plays a pivotal role in his epistemology, for Doyle. On her account, Nietzsche sees the  will to power thesis as revealing unity among subjective (qualitative) and “objective” (quantitative)  phenomena, which are otherwise at theoretical odds. Both can be cast in terms of the will to power,  so Nietzsche can plausibly hypothesize their basic unity as different expressions of the same one  phenomenon. This unity is key, epistemologically, since on Doyle’s reading it offers subjective  access to the objective.   The ultimate question for Doyle, then, is whether we can make sense of a phenomenon in  both subjective and objective terms. This question plays out for Doyle in terms of the apparent  opposition between intrinsic and relational analyses of causality. Here, Doyle recalls the v is  viva issue wherein Descartes, Leibniz, and others debated whether the relational or extrinsic  qualities of causation were not the expression of some internal or intrinsic nature. Nietzsche,  reports Doyle, applauded Kant’s precritical efforts to unify the internal and external qualities but  objected to the later, critical account relegating the intrinsic to the unknowable thing-in-itself. In  arguing that Nietzsche seeks his own unification of the intrinsic with the relational, Doyle takes  on recent interpreters such as Peter Poellner, Steven Hales, and Rex Welshon, who maintain  that Nietzsche rejects the notion of intrinsicality. Doyle’s textual analysis reveals an ambiguity  in Nietzsche’s thought, with passages supporting her position and others apparently supporting  the antiessentialist view. With a charitable if conditional reading of Nietzsche on this issue in  hand, Doyle confronts the final, philosophical question of whether causality may be understood  in both relational and intrinsic terms. While some available analyses of causality are incongruent  with Nietzsche’s views (e.g., counterfactual analysis), Doyle finds George Molnar’s “powers”  analysis both coherent and compatible with Nietzsche. In this way, Doyle is able to conclude  that Nietzsche has the resources to collapse the appearance/reality distinction, bringing “the  world in[to] view.”   I find that  Nietzsche on Epistemology and Metaphysics: The World in View is a valuable con- tribution both to Nietzsche scholarship and to philosophy in general. It is clearly written, and the  attention that Doyle has paid to organization and to leading the reader through its complex argu- ment is welcome and effective. In terms of Nietzsche scholarship, Doyle’s work displays intimate  knowledge of the whole of Nietzsche’s corpus, draws upon a close understanding of a great range  of Nietzsche scholarship, and clearly helps to advance our understanding of the most fundamental  issues in Nietzsche’s metaphysics and epistemology. Doyle’s familiarity with Kantian and related  literatures is likewise impressive. More generally, scholars on both sides of the continental divide  will benefit from this work, bringing us closer, as it does, to a unification of these two important  traditions: Nietzsche’s thought on the basic structure of reality and our access to it should be well  known by all who wish to comment on these matters. N ietzsche on Epistemology and Metaphysics  certainly raises questions that the reader will wish to pursue. Among these are questions concerning  JNS 41_10_Reviews.indd   128 4/21/11   12:07:36 PM </page> <page sequence="3"> BOOK REVIEWS  129 the accuracy of Nietzsche’s interpretation of Kant, the coherence of a perspectival objectivity, and  the possibility of an intrinsic relationality. It is, however, precisely for placing us in a position to  examine these issues more closely that we may value Doyle’s work most.   Winthrop University   oakesm@winthrop.edu   NOTE    1.  Throughout Nietzsche on Epistemology and Metaphysics, Doyle makes knowledgeable  reference to and use of related contemporary discussion, calling upon the work of such figures  as Donald Davidson, David Lewis, and Peter Strawson. It is somewhat surprising, therefore, that  Doyle here fails to mention Hilary Putnam, with whose work the terms ‘internal realism’ and  ‘metaphysical realism’ are most closely associated.

GLENN   The debate over Nietzsche’s political teaching—whether he had one and if so, what it was—shows  no sign of abating, despite a great deal of scholarly exchange on the topic over the last few decades.  Don Dombowsky has participated in this debate over the last few years with the publication of two  books: an argument for a political reading of Nietzsche ( Nietzsche’s Machiavellian Politics ) and  (with Frank Cameron) an edited volume collecting Nietzsche’s political writings throughout his  career (P olitical Writings of Friedrich Nietzsche ). I will address the books in order.   In  Nietzsche’s Machiavellian Politics , Dombowsky approaches Nietzsche with a distinct argu- ment; he wishes to emphasize the political context of Nietzsche’s own time and how Nietzsche fit  into this context: “The principal imperative guiding this study, conversely, is to situate Nietzsche’s  political thought in relation to the political issues, critiques, and movements of his own period” (1).  As Dombowsky points out, Peter Bergmann’s N ietzsche, “The Last Antipolitical German” is one  of the few other works to address this matter in detail, so there is ample room for such research.  To this end, Dombowsky points to Nietzsche’s frequent mention (often in asides) of Bismarck, the   Kulturkampf , and other issues of the late nineteenth century. But he also seeks to connect Nietzsche  with intellectual movements of his time, such as neo-Machiavellian elite theory. On top of this,  Dombowsky strongly criticizes postmodern and radical liberal interpretations of Nietzsche and con- tends that Nietzsche subscribes to Machiavelli’s political teachings, combining force with fraud.   Dombowsky begins by making the case that for Nietzsche, morality is reducible to politics,  making him a thoroughly political thinker. Dombowsky extends this idea by claiming that all of  Nietzsche’s key philosophical ideas fit into this political view; indeed, we cannot escape Nietzsche’s  politics, even if we choose to focus solely on his views on, for example, aesthetics or  epistemology.  Part and parcel of Nietzsche’s political views is his profoundly antiegalitarian sentiment: his empha- sis on agonism and order of rank and his project of the revaluation of values are fundamentally  elitist. Dombowsky makes his case strongly here (although I am predisposed to agree with this  JOURNAL OF NIETZSCHE STUDIES, Issue 41, 2011.
