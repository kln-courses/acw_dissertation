<plain_text><page sequence="1">African Art at the Nelson-Atkins Museum f Art JOYCE M.YOUMANS XW~ ^ =hen the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Missouri, opened in December 1933, its collections did not include any works from Africa. This lacu- na, typical of art museums in the United States in the early twentieth century, re- flected Americans' general ignorance about the continent. In the late 1950s, however, with the breakdown of colonial systems in Africa, news coverage of these events began to arouse interest in its peoples, cultures, and arts. This interest extended into the nation's heartland, reaching the citizens of Kansas City. Laurence Sickman, the second direc- tor of the Nelson-Atkins, had personally acquired most of the objects in its exquisite Asian collection. In 1958 he was moved by the beauty of two bronze sculptures from the Benin kingdom to purchase them for the museum. Since these initial acquisi- tions, the African art collection and its related programming have grown from decade to decade, slowly at first and more rapidly since the mid-1980s. Tracing the history of the institu- tion from its inception to the present day provides an examina- tion of its evolving attitude toward African art. William Rockhill Nelson The museum's very existence can be credited to William Rockhill Nelson, founder of The Kansas City Star, which became the region's most influential paper.1 Arriving in Kansas City in 1880, Nelson was confronted with a thriving frontier town with a population of 55,785. The place was a booming transportation hub, a market for the area's grain and cattle, and the focus of atrican arts * winter 2000 40</page><page sequence="2">Eastern investment. By 1908 it would be a substantial manufac- turing center. It was also plagued with all the pains associated with quick growth: the city was unattractive and muddy, and lacked services and amenities. Nelson immediately pronounced Kansas City "incredibly ugly and commonplace" and stated: "If I were to live here the town must be made over" (Churchman &amp; Erbes 1993:8-9).2 From its first issue the Star crusaded for civic improvements. The beautification of Kansas City was Nelson's goal for thirty- five years, until his death. An art gallery was to be part of the civic makeover. Nelson realized that the city lacked the funds to buy what he defined as masterpieces; these were already in collections in New York, Washington, Chicago, and European cities. To solve this prob- lem, he hired copyists, including the well-known Pisano family Opposite page: 1. View from the south lawn, with Shuttlecocks by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen.

Nelson's solution was fair- ly typical of the time. The resultant collection of copies of Euro- pean Old Masters, called the Western Gallery of Art, opened in 1897 at the Kansas City Public Library. When Nelson died in 1915, his will stipulated that the William Rockhill Nelson Trust be created to purchase art for the people of Kansas City. It was to be administered by trustees appointed by the presidents of the universities of Missouri, Kansas, and Oklahoma. Around that time another surprising bequest came to light: a schoolteacher named Mary McAfee Atkins, who died in 1911, had left a sum in her will to build a museum of fine art. Funds from both sources were combined to create the Nelson Gallery-Atkins Museum, renamed the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in the fall of 1982 (Fig. 1). The Early Collection According to the terms of Nelson's will the museum could not be built until his wife and daughter had died; consequently con- struction of the building did not begin until 1930. In the mean- time the Nelson trustees tackled the assignment of finding art to fill it. They established, from the beginning, two basic principles of their collection policy: only the finest examples of original works of art were to be purchased, and art from all eras and civ- ilizations should be represented. When the museum opened in December 1933, a more than respectable collection of European painting and sculpture of the Italian, Netherlandish, Spanish, French, and English schools was on view.3 Additionally there were impressive holdings of Chinese and American (including Native American)4 art and a small number of Near Eastern and Classical works. Thus, in a span of three years, the trustees had acquired an extensive and diverse collection of more than five thousand objects that filled thirty galleries on two floors in the east wing of the new building. The Chinese Temple Gallery and a suite of five American period rooms were major features. But despite their achievement, the trustees did not adhere to one of the major tenets of their acquisition policy, that calling for repre- sentation of all eras and civilizations. Glaring omissions re- vealed their biases: contemporary, Southeast Asian, Oceanic, and African art was not included. Over the next two decades, collections and programs steadi- ly grew in all represented areas. When Laurence Sickman became the Nelson-Atkins's second director in 1953, museums were quiet places where scholars and collectors focused on con- noisseurship. By the conclusion of his directorship in 1977, there had been a nationwide explosion of public interest in art, a phenomenon reflected in increased attendance figures. Institutions responded with art education programs and larger exhibitions that drew both visitors and press attention. Through all these changes Sickman and his trustees steered a relatively steady course, one in which works from Africa came to be included in an expanded definition of art. | The museum's acquisitions in this area did not stem from an interest in the continent's peoples, cultures, and arts. Sickman's B decision in 1958 to purchase the Nelson-Atkins's first African atrican arts ? winter 2000</page><page sequence="4">works, two seventeenth-century bronze sculptures from Nigeria's Benin kingdom, was based strictly on aesthetic grounds.5 One of the pieces was a memorial head of an oba (king), and the other was a plaque portraying a warrior and attendants (Fig. 2). The plaque was among the pieces that British Lieutenant General Pitt-Rivers had purchased in 1898 from the British government's sale of objects brought back from the 1897 Punitive Expedition to Benin. The museum began collecting African art at the same time as other Midwestern museums that served similar populations. The Denver Art Museum had assembled a collection of almost twenty works when it held its first exhibition of African art in 1945. The collection at the Indiana University Art Museum began in 1955 with a gift from an alumnus. In a striking paral- lel with the Nelson-Atkins, the Toledo Museum of Art acquired its first African piece in 1958: a bronze queen-mother head from the Benin kingdom. Opposite page: 3.

Ralph Theodore (Ted) Coe, who began as the cura- tor of painting and sculpture in 1959 and later became director of the museum, oversaw the African collection until about 1970. The museum made no effort to hire someone trained in African art and did not institute an acquisition policy for this collection area. Slow Growth For the next two decades the African art collection was to grow almost exclusively through gifts. In the 1960s the museum received approximately thirty donations, including a strongly carved Fang figure (Fig. 3). Placed on top of bark boxes con- taining the skulls of ancestors, these sculptures functioned as intercessors between the living and the ancestors (Perrois &amp; Delage 1990:42-44). Clan members placed offerings of food before the reliquaries and periodically cleansed the figures with palm oil, giving the sculptures their characteristic reddish brown to black patina. During this decade the Nelson-Atkins purchased only one object, an Asante stool with unusual silver metalwork decora- tion (Fig. 4). The stool had probably belonged to the king, or Asantehene, named Kofi Kakari (b. ca. 1837-d. 1884). The design of its circular wooden support reflects the proverb "The rainbow is around the neck of every nation," referring to the king's mission in uniting the various Asante chiefdoms under his domain. One of the stool's notable features is the affixed sil- ver label stating that the object was taken from the Asantehene's palace at Kumasi in February 1873. The museum's relative lack of interest in this area of art is seen not only in its almost nonexistent acquisitions program but also in its consignment of African works to a small, improvised gallery space. Nevertheless, in 1962 Ted Coe's attraction to non- Western material led him to organize the Nelson-Atkins's first exhibition to include African art. "The Imagination of Primitive Man," comprising more than 300 African, Native American, and Pre-Columbian works borrowed from approximately 50 individuals and museums, piqued the public's interest. In spite of a snowstorm, about 1,300 people attended the January open- ing, and approximately 50,000 people visited the exhibition. Lectures by Eliot Elisofon and Roy Sieber were well attended. The 178-page catalogue written by Coe was then the most ambi- tious ever published in connection with a Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art exhibition. As the major show of the season, "The Imagination of Primitive Man" was followed closely by the press. Robert K. Sanford wrote in The Kansas City Star (1962:1F): "Nowhere in the United States in recent years has a primitive art show of such dimensions been presented, and very few previous shows have matched it." The newspaper's editorials praised Coe for drawing attention to an area of art not previously addressed at the museum and for bringing a general un- derstanding of "primitive" art to Kansas City. They called for more shows of this kind. Five years later (December 1966- January 1967), Coe organized an exhibition of African, Medi- terranean, and Oceanic art from the collection of Mr. and Mrs. Herbert Baker. Around 1970, however, African art lost its sole supporter on the museum staff as Coe turned his full attention to the paint- ing and sculpture collections. Nevertheless, the African collec- tion continued to grow, though slowly, and almost exclusively through gifts and happenstance. Significant gifts in the 1970s include a Baule kpan mask that epitomizes female beauty (Fig. 5) and a Dogon toguna post (Fig. 6). Used as a support for a men's rest house, the post depicts elements from Dogon myths-three ancestors, two footprints, and two rabbit masks. The rabbit is a trickster in Dogon belief. On the one hand it symbolizes the human hero who combats sorcery and disorder; on the other it is associated with ambigu- ity and danger (DeMott 1979:112). In 1978 the museum purchased a Mossi mask whose shape recalls a weaving shuttle (Fig. 7). According to myth, the first mask of this type came from the heavens, bringing the knowl- edge of cotton and weaving to humankind (Schweeger-Hefel 1981:34). The dancer's performance simulates the action of a shuttle passing back and forth across the warp. The Nelson-Atkins continued to host occasional African art exhibitions, all of them popular with the public. In 1970 it held "African Sculpture," which had originated at the National Gallery of Art. Featuring 194 objects, the show, curated by William Fagg, Keeper of Ethnography at the British Museum, was then the most comprehensive exhibition of African sculp- ture seen in the United States. Works were borrowed from African national collections and from Western museums and collectors. Programming included a lecture by Robert Farris Thompson. New Commitment By 1976 the museum had one unfinished area left to be con- verted into exhibition space: the second floor of the west wing. Several new galleries and a third-floor mezzanine were subsequently built in this space. The mezzanine included a 1,000-square-foot gallery for Native American, Oceanic, Pre- Columbian, and African art. The 1980s began with the landmark exhibition "African Furniture and Household Objects," organized by the American Federation of Arts and co-curated by Roy Sieber and Katherine C. White. The show featured 262 utilitarian objects noted for their beauty, including containers, beds, headrests, stools, toys, cooking utensils, and farming implements. It encouraged visi- tors to explore African form and design, and its focus on house- hold items provided insight into daily life in Africa. The real shift in the the museum's commitment to African art began in 1982, when Marc F. Wilson became director. Wilson was the first staff member to institute an official collection poli- cy for African art. Under his leadership the Nelson-Atkins out- lined five areas to emphasize for accessions-European art, American art, decorative arts, twentieth-century art, and African art. With its own gallery space and collection policy, African art finally began to receive more systematic attention. 5. Mask (kpan). Baule peoples, Cote d'lvoire, 19th century.

With this mandate in place, the museum hired Mary Jo Arnoldi in 1983 as its first curator to oversee the arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas. Aroldi directed the department until she left to become a curator at the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution. David A. Binkley replaced Amoldi in 1985 and remained at the museum until 1998, when he became chief curator at the National Museum of African Art, Smithsonian Institution. Under these two curators' leadership, the museum's Afri- can purchases increased dramatically during the 1980s. In 1984 it bought a Bena Lulua figure of a pregnant woman (Fig. 8), which had been collected in Africa before 1940 by Dr. Tiarko Fourche, an authority on Luba and related cultures of the Kasai region. The Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren, Bel- gium, subsequently acquired it along with three other figures by the same master artist, then deaccessioned it in 1972. The work entered a private collection from which it was purchased by the museum. In 1986 the Nelson-Atkins acquired a sculpture representing an Urhobo warrior (Fig. 9). This monumentally composed fig- ure, with its narrow torso, outward-thrusting chest, fixed gaze, bared teeth, and jutting jaw, exudes the confidence and restrained power of an Urhobo spirit or mythical founder-hero (Foss 1976). Prominently represented on the chest is a gourd or packet containing medicinal ingredients that provided the war- rior with magical powers necessary for success in battle. In its originating Nigerian community, the sculpture was placed in a communal shrine. A powerful Makonde mask from Tanzania (Fig. 10), acquired in 1987, represents a village chief or elder wearing a hat of Islamic derivation that is worn only by senior men. The natu- ralism of the face is heightened by human hair attached in minute drilled holes. This east African example helps round out the collection geographically. In keeping with its policy of collecting only the "best" ob- jects, that same year the museum acquired a bronze Benin head (Fig. 11), believed to be one of the earliest of its kind. It had traveled to Europe with troops returning from the 1897 British Punitive Expedition. The Benin head that had been acquired by Sickman in 1958 was then deaccessioned. Gifts continued to enlarge the African collection. They in- cluded a pair of Bamana chiwara masks (Figs. 12, 13) and an elegant male Hemba figure (Fig. 14), carved in the nineteenth century to honor a recently deceased member of a ruling fam- ily. A compelling Teke figure complete with power substances was donated in 1989 (Fig. 15). This sculpture, representing a male titleholder of high status, displays extensive facial scari- fication and a beard worn only by certain ritual leaders. The Teke peoples used these sculptures to control supernatural powers to ensure success in hunting, trading, and business atrican arts ? winter 2000</page><page sequence="10">pursuits. They were also made to counteract illness and dis- ease (Hottot 1956:25-40). The Nelson-Atkins hosted "Praise Poems: The Katherine White Collection of African Art" in 1986. Curated by Pam McClusky of the Seattle Art Museum, the show included fifty masks, head- dresses, and sculptures from west and central Africa. As with previous exhibitions, additional activities involving various media, such as films and musical performances, helped inform the public about African art and culture.6 In conjunction with this presentation, the museum displayed textiles and various African objects in other galleries. The decade closed with "Sounding Forms: African Musical Instruments," curated by Marie-Therese Brincard and orga- nized by the American Federation of Arts. This show, mounted at the Nelson-Atkins in 1989, featured more than 150 works. Programming included lectures, a film series, and perfor- mances by African musical groups. Like all the other African art exhibitions held at the museum, "Sounding Forms" received positive reviews in the Kansas City press. Reviewers typically noted the complexity of the works and emphasized their importance as art. In a Kansas City Star review of "African Sculpture," Donald Hoffman stated: "The best of African art easily assumes a place in the pantheon of the best of art any- where" (Hoffman 1970:24). Major Expansion Over the next decade the African art collection grew signifi- cantly. Notable gifts included several Kuba textiles, one of them an intricately embroidered woman's ceremonial skirt (ncak) (Fig. 16). A vessel by the Kenyan-born artist Magdalene Odundo (Fig. 17) was donated in 1995, after "Ceramic Gestures: New Vessels by Magdalene Odundo" was held at the museum the same year. Curated by Marla C. Berns of the University Art Museum at the University of California, Santa Barbara, the exhibition proved to be particularly popular. Odundo's works are known for their beautiful anthropomorphic forms. In 1996 the museum received a Luntu mask (Fig. 18). Among other cultures in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (includ- ing the Kuba, Yaka, and Suku), performers wearing masks sim- ilar to this example often play the role of a clown or fool. Few museum collections in the United States and Europe include examples of raffia masks, as they were rarely collected in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Westerners typi- cally thought them unimportant in comparison to their wooden counterparts. In addition, such masks, delicate and prone to bug infestation, were difficult to ship. There were many purchases during this decade, including a beautifully incised Chokwe jar (Fig. 19) and a carved Yoruba door that originally covered the entrance to a shrine dedicated to Shango, the powerful deity of thunder and lightning (Fig. 20). Both of the museum's well-worn Yoruba ere ibeji are similar in form, style, surface wear, and patination (Fig. 21). This suggests that they were created by the same artist and were handled in a similar manner over an extended period of time. Traces of indi- go are visible in the elaborate coiffures, and an encrustation of red camwood appears in several areas on the figures. The figurative Bamum pipe from Cameroon features a large human head surmounted by an elaborate coiffure consisting of abstract frog motifs (Fig. 22). Openwork spider motifs decorate the wooden stem. In the iconography of Cameroon Grassfields art, the frog symbolizes fertility and the spider symbolizes the mediation between the world of the living and that of the ancestors (Northern 1984:50). Both creatures are associated with leadership and appear on rulers' paraphernalia and masks through the Grassfields area. Made only by men, pipe bowls in the form of human bodies, heads, or masks were often carried by retainers of paramount rulers as objects of conspicuous display. A Senufo female figure carrying a lidded bowl on her head reflects the artist's mastery in its combination of naturalistic and highly abstract characteristics (Fig. 23). Formerly in the collection of Ernst Anspach of New York City, a well-known collector of African art, the figure was exhibited in the impor- tant 1964 exhibition "Senufo Sculpture from West Africa," organized by Robert Goldwater for the Museum of Primitive Art in New York City. An Eket cap mask depicts a male figure standing astride a wooden plinth attached to a woven wicker base (Fig. 24). Remnants of imported cotton cloth that display an imitation splash-resist technique are still attached to the basketry sup- port. The cloth would have completely covered the head, torso, and legs of the performer. An elaborate hair arrangement and finely executed carv- ing dates the museum's Igbo maiden mask (Fig. 25) to the late nineteenth or early twentieth century. Delicately delineated facial features highlighted in black against a pigmented white clay surface represent an Igbo aesthetic of beauty. The addi- tional decoration on the forehead and sides of the face may refer to uli decoration. Uli is an elaborate linear system of body painting that is worn by both men and women for cele- bratory events. Members of the Mission du Saint Esprit centered in Nimeuye, Netherlands, collected the museum's Songye mask (Fig. 26) in Africa. It was subsequently acquired by the Belgian collector Jef Vander Straete, then by M. Pinto of Paris, and finally, before coming to the Nelson-Atkins, by Marc Ginzberg of New York City. Significantly, the mask retains a portion of its original raffia costume. This includes a netted head cov- ering with a projecting horn, a beard, and a portion of the original shirt. In 1994 the museum purchased a goatskin-covered mask from the Cross River area bordering eastern Nigeria and west- ern Cameroon (Fig. 27). Etim Abassi Ekpenyong, considered a master of this particular mask tradition, created the piece. Two Zulu beaded capes (Figs. 28, 29), purchased in 1997, expanded the collection to include art from South Africa, an area previ- ously neglected. One of the major acquisitions of this decade was a beaded throne from the Bansoa of the Bamileke kingdom (Fig. 30; cf. field photograph in Harter 1986:69, fig. 71). When the museum acquired the work in June 1992, it was missing an estimated 75,000 beads. Some had been lost because of deteriorating fab- ric and supporting yarn; others were broken. Although pack- ages of beads accompanied the sculpture, there weren't enough to conserve the throne. Appropriate beads were located in northern Cameroon and shipped to the United States. A year later, restoration was complete. winter 2000 ? alrican arts 49</page><page sequence="11">JAMISON MILLER JAMISON MILLER This page: Left: 12. Male antelope crest mask (chiwara).

"The Intelligence of Forms: An Artist Collects African Art," organized by the Minneapolis Institute of Arts and curated by Evan M. Maurer, highlighted selections from the collection of the Belgian artist Jean Willy Mestach. An in- terest in education continued, as evidenced by music per- formances, workshops, lectures, children's programs, a three-part lecture series by Patricia Darish, and a lecture by David Driskell. In 1994 Darish organized a small exhibit of Kuba textiles to coincide with a two-session course that she held at the museum. Into the New Millennium The millennium ended with two noteworthy events affecting African art at the museum: the division of African, Oceanic, Pre- Columbian, and Native American areas into two departments and the hiring of the museum's first curator devoted exclusive- ly to African art. David Binkley had worked hard to build both the African and Native American holdings, and there was sig- nificant community interest in this material. Marc Wilson had designated the African collection as an area for growth, but he also recognized that specific expertise was required to oversee ROBERT NEWCOMBE JAMISON MILLER winter 2000 ? atrican arts 55</page><page sequence="17">its development. Elisabeth L. Cameron began as curator of the new Department of African Art in October 1999. One of her early tasks was to arrange the acquisition of a superb Kota reli- quary figure (Fig. 31). This example is rare in its combination of large size and a janus face with three types of metal. The departmental division will make it easier to concen- trate not only on acquisitions but on exhibitions as well. "Another Africa," curated by this author, opened in Novem- ber 1999. Based on the 1998 publication Another Africa, it com- bined poetry by the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe and photographs by the American photographer Robert Lyons. Through a combination of text and image, the exhibition revealed the complexity, diversity, and vitality of contempo- rary Africa and its peoples. It counteracted the ongoing por- trayal of the continent as a place beset by famine, drought, and civil war, or as an open-air ethnographic museum for the West. Elisabeth Kirsch (1999) wrote in The Kansas City Star that "Another Africa" "depict[s] the world's second largest continent as decidedly different from the images that many Westerners hold. Pictures by Robert Lyons...show an Africa that is bright and bustling with people who are intriguing and distinct." Programming included a lecture by Robert Lyons, two African movies, and a performance by an African musical troupe. The Department of African Art's current exhibition, "African Art: New Ways of Looking" (April 27, 2000-February 18, 2001), features objects from the permanent collection. Cameron real- ized that in order to communicate with museum visitors, one must first determine the most effective presentation styles. "African Art" attempts to do just that. Five scenarios present information in different ways-ranging from traditional labels to text combined with images to laminated cards that are geared toward children and hung outside the case. The objects them- selves are also displayed in various ways. The museum hired Randi Korn and Associates to conduct visitor evaluations of the scenarios. This process will continue for one year, and the results will inform the reinstallation of the entire African gallery in spring 2001. Visitor assessment will then begin again as the Department of African Art looks to the future. Determining what museum-goers want and which tech- niques most effectively teach them about art is important to the Department of African Art, particularly now. Next year the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art will begin construction on a new building, designed by architect Steven Holl and Associates, that will attach to the existing structure. Slated for completion in 2005, it will house a gallery for African art, representing about a 400% increase in space. Another major event on the department's active exhibition schedule is a presentation of Lega art scheduled for September 2002. It will be curated by Cameron and jointly organized with the UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History. The exhibitions and related activities at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art have helped residents of Kansas City lear more about the people, cultures, and arts of Africa over the decades. Yet the collection's growth suffered from the institu- tion's own lack of interest until just eighteen years ago. Now the collection that began in 1958 with the acquisition of two works 56</page><page sequence="18">ROBERT NEWCOMBE Opposite page: 23. Figure. Senufo peoples, Cote d'lvoire, early 20th century.

The museum's policy of acquiring only the best works of art extends to African art. This "masterpiece mentality" keeps the number of objects-now nearing 300-relatively low. The phi- losophy contrasts with that of university museums, where "masterpieces" are usually situated within the context of a broader-based study collection. There, a range in quality and the inclusion of moder reproductions and forgeries allow vis- itors and students to learn by comparison. The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art's primary focus, however, is, first, to promote viewers' appreciation of the aesthetic qualities of these works and, second, to educate them about the rich art traditions of diverse African cultures. It is proud of its position in the Midwest as a leader in the collection and display of African art, which, after expansion is completed in 2005, will become a highlight of the visitor's experience.

The Museum of Modem Art in Oxford bought four of these images. Given the problematic status of multiple copies (aside from the genre of printed graphics) in the Western art world, one response has been to acquire as many of the ver- sions as possible and treat them as a single work. This was a tactic used by a number of those who bought Mabasa's policemen (Duncan 1994:43-44). 22. There is some confusion about the titles of these two works. They are listed as Carnage I and Carnage II by Sack (1988:54, fig. 45) and Rankin (1990a:120), but Duncan refers to Carnage II as Natal Flood Disaster (1994:20). 23. Trent Read was introduced to Mabasa through his wife, who had been dealing with the Northern Transvaal artists at the Sanderling Gallery since 1987, and he only became her "agent" in 1990 (Read, letter, May 6, 1998). Many people I have spoken to over the years have suggested that he paid Mabasa a stipend (see also Duncan 1994:84), a system used by the parent gallery, Everard Read, for a number of their artists. However, Warren Siebritz does not recollect this being done while he worked for Read Contemporary (personal commu- nication, April 22, 1998). Read himself is silent on this issue, although he acknowledges he had a friendly relationship with Mabasa (letter, May 6,1998). 24. I am aware that in the following reading I am apparently disregarding the voice of the author. The line that I follow, however, is suggested by the title of the work and the Venda tradition that it refers to, neither of which can have been lost on Mabasa herself. 25. When Ngoma Lungundu was included in "Siyawela" in 1995, a wall text enabled Birmingham viewers to access its "mean- ings" and, presumably, lift it out of an undifferentiated "primi- tiveness." Most of the pieces in this show, curated by Colin Richards, were accompanied by such texts. While many of the urban artists were invited to write their own, Richards wrote, and asked others to write, texts for works by the rural artists. (I did for those for Mabasa's, Segogela's, and Mukhuba's works.) Thus, in that case the mediation of meaning was shifted to the curator and his assistants. This was not Mabasa's first trip overseas to an exhibition. Linda Givon remembers spending time with Mabasa and Helen Sebidi in the Netherlands in 1993 at the time of the "Southern Cross" exhibition (personal communication, April 2, 1998). 26. Linda Givon claims that Maswanganyi had been selling to other dealers without her knowledge (personal communica- tion, April 2, 1998). This made it impossible to continue to market his work: its quality was uneven, and she could not guarantee its uniqueness. 27. Becker (1989:20) discusses the differences in interpretation with regard to Hlungwane's works. Maswanganyi, however, distinguished between his fish in Christ Walking on the Water and the nzuzu, a fish associated with the ancestors (amadlozi) and diviners (isisangom). He has a large sculpture of a human- faced nzuzu, which he claims is the "traditional" form of this fish (interview, July 7, 1998). 28. Rossouw (1990:57) says Maswanganyi is "both a tradi- tional and a western man and has been able to successfully span the gap between the two worlds," but he does not men- tion the artist's religious beliefs. Although Maswanganyi married two women according to traditional rites, it appears that the Assemblies of God sect to which he belongs con- dones this aspect of African custom. Certainly Maswanganyi is unconcerned by clashes between his Christian and his eth- nic identities (interview, July 7, 1998). 29. The "Christian" character of Hlungwani's faith is discussed by Schneider (1989). His church is independent of other charis- matic churches in South Africa, of which the largest is the Zion church at Moria. 30. Initially Peter Rich, a Johannesburg architect, controlled market access to Hlungwani's works, a role later taken over by Ricky Bumett. 31. Segogela was known to others involved in the art scene who had bought works from him prior to his being taken up by Goodman Gallery (Nessa Leibhammer, personal commu- nication, June 1997). 32. The notion of a separate category of "transitional" art has been widely debated since its first usage in the South African context. See Nettleton (1988), Dell (1989), and Richards (1990). 33. The issues raised by this openness are evident in Goodman Gallery's photographs of these works. Many are arranged with dramatic lighting that creates an ambience reminiscent of Batman TV cartoons (slides in the History of Art Department Slide Library, University of the Witwatersrand). 34. A similar point could be raised about the inclusion of artists such as Mabasa and Mukhuba in the Vita Art Now competition, in which awards are made to eight artists exhibiting in South African galleries in a particular year. Neither Mukhuba's nor Mabasa's works are executed in rela- tion to current debates and theoretical positions within the avant-garde. Segogela's work could be seen as paralleling that of Trevor Makhoba, whose paintings are also allegorical narratives executed in a realist mode, and who won the Standard Bank Young Artists award in 1996 (Sibisi 1996). However, Makhoba does not appear to be in any danger of being relegated to a folk art category such as that which Geers recently advocated for these artists (personal communication, April 22,1998), as he works within a "Western" medium and has received some art training. 35. When these works were shown at the FUBA gallery in Johannesburg in 1989, they drew no critical attention, although the teachers at FUBA organized a seminar around 94 them. In this exhibition they were juxtaposed with the ceram- ics of Thami Jali, who had trained at Rorke's Drift in Natal and was a resident potter at the Kim Sacks studio in Johannesburg. Exhibiting unknown rural artists with better- known and trained urban artists is a fairly common strategy, as it ensures that an audience will be attracted to the gallery. 36. This aspect of Mudzunga's recent performances has been researched by Oren Kaplan for his M.A. dissertation in the Department of Social Anthropology at the University of the Witwatersrand. 37. Originally Mudzungu was denied access to the lake by the chief, but he went ahead with the performance in defiance of this ruling. Lake Fundudzi is said to be "haunted" by the spirits of the Ngona, the autochthonous owners of the land, but inhabited by the spirits of the original leader of the ruling Singo group, Thoho ya Ndou. It is also said to be sacred to the creator god Raluvhimba (Nettleton 1984:219-21). References cited Arnold, Marion. 1988.

YOUMANS: Notes, from page 61 [This article was accepted for publication in September 2000.] 1. Information about the history of the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art is taken from Churchman &amp; Erbes 1993. 2. Here Churchman and Erbes cite members of the staff of The Kansas City Star who wrote William Rockhill Nelson: The Story of a Man, a Newspaper and a City (Cambridge: The Riverside Press, 1915, p. 27). 3. The trustees hired the museum's first director, Paul Gardner, only after the initial collection was intact. 4. Like most other American institutions, the museum initial- ly collected Native American art rather than African art. Local interest in the former was fueled by the city's connec- tion to Santa Fe via the railroad. In 1931 and 1932 the trustees african arts * winter 2000</page><page sequence="24">acquired from the Heye Foundation approximately 300 Native American objects, consisting mainly of beaded cos- tumes, other material from the Great Plains and Western Plateau, and California baskets. The next year they purchased two large collections of historical pottery and Navajo textiles from Fred Harvey. 5. The museum's initial African acquisitions couldn't have been more timely. Beginning with Ghana in 1957, one African country after another gained its independence. On March 6, 1957, page-four headlines in The Kansas City Star blazed: "Day of Great Joy: Prime Minister [Kwame Nkrumah] Sees It as Start of Drive to Free All Colonial Areas." 6. Binkley held a three-part lecture series with this goal in mind. The title of Roy Sieber's guest lecture, "Stunning...but Is It Art?," revealed an impetus to place African art in art his- torical context. A symposium featuring Susan Vogel ("African Aesthetics"), Margaret Thompson Drewal ("Art in Yoruba Performance"), and Mary Jo Arnoldi ("Shared Perceptions: Art of the Western Sudan") also examined this issue.

WEHMEYER: Notes, fromi page 69 [This article was accepted for publication in August 1999.1 In the Spiritual Church, it is customary to begin the service by "first giving honor and obedience to God, second to his dar- ling son Jesus, to the Archbishop, to the Bishops present in the congregation, and to all the deacons and ministers pres- ent in the Church." In this tradition, I must begin by acknowl- edging my "academic spirit guides" whose scholarship has formed the basis for my inquiry: Donald Cosentino, Wyatt MacGaffey, and Robert Farris Thompson. I am also grateful to Jason Berry and Syndey Byrd, who offered both kind hospi- tality and tremendous insights into New Orleans vernacular religion. I must also thank Syndey for the use of her pho- tographs. Last and most important, I offer thanks to my con- sultants in the Spiritual Church without whose generosity and willingness to share knowledge and experience this arti- cle could not have been written. Bishop Oliver Coleman, my chief guide to the mysteries of the Spiritual Church; Bishops Efzelda Coleman, Edmonia Caldwell, Daniel Jackson, and Victoria McSwain; Archbishop Johnson and all the clergy and congregants of Israelite Divine Spiritual Church-you have my deepest gratitude. This article is based on a paper presented at the ACASA Triennial Symposium on African Art in New Orleans, 1998. 1. Throughout this essay I use the term "Indian" rather than "Native American" to refer to the various figures and behav- iors termed "Indian" by church members in New Orleans. In addition to being the accepted designation within the Spiritual Church, "Indian" preserves the distinction between these images and activities and those belonging to local indigenous peoples. As Thompson and Berry have suggest- ed, "Indian" in New Orleans is often better read as coded "African" than as "Native American." 2. Unless otherwise indicated, all quotes were taken from the following interviews: Bishop Daniel Jackson, August 1997; Bishop Oliver Coleman, ALugust 1997, December 1997, May 1998, and (where noted) phone interviews and informal con- versations held over the last three years; Edmonia Caldwell, December 1997; and Efzelda Coleman, December 1997. All photographs (except those attributed to Syndey Byrd) were taken during these interviews. 3. At least one of my other consultants in the Spiritual Church takes serious issue with Bishop Jackson's words, maintaining that Black Hawk always works for right and justice, and there- fore cannot be constrained to "do anything" outside the realm of righteousness.
