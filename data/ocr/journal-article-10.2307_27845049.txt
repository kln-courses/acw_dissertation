<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Gardeners of Eden. Alistair Gra ham. 246 pp. London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1973. No price given. This is a most provocative book. The author's theme is spectacularly per verse: look beneath the protective, compassionate ideals of the wildlife preservationist and one finds misan thropic aggressiveness and rampant anthropomorphism. Graham argues that the game saver's mentality is "all part of the pathetic fallacy, the neurot ic elevation of nature above man, the fantasy of paradise." Graham calls it the Mowgli complex: "an infantile re gression arising out of obsessive avoid ance of human aggression, character ized by fantasies of identification with animals." A former game warden him self in Kenya, Graham excoriates the men who ran the game departments and national parks of colonial East Af rica for allowing their sentimentality to interfere with any attempt at rational management of wildlife populations. Graham himself, however, does not provide us in this book with any model of dispassionate scientific behavior. He takes such delight in flaying the game saver as the villain in the psychodrama of man versus wildlife that he scornful ly disregards the accumulating evi dence of overkill by primitive hunters. Anyone who reads this book will find something to get good and mad about. As a geographer I found the biological and environmental determinism espe cially grating. On the other hand, I was intrigued with Graham's speculation on the origin of animal domestication. African buffalo live in and around human settlement in northern Uganda. Children ride them, women shoo them away with broomsticks, and the ani mals show no fear or aggression toward</page><page sequence="2">humans. Graham contends that such a state of mutual indifference was re quired before domestication could occur. This is a most compelling and con troversial book, an irreverent heresy against some of the most sacred dogma of wildlife preservation.?J.
