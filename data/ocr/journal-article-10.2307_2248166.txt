<plain_text><page sequence="1">VIII.-PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. Vol. xvi., No. 4. A. Lalande. ' Philosophy in France, 1906.' [Discusses (1) the centring of philosophical activity in logic and science; (2) the changes recently introduced in the pre- paration for the philosophical career; (3) progress in the history of philosophy along the lines laid down by Boutroux and Brochard; and (4) the controversy between Mathieu and Lefranc concerning Pascal's part in the experiment of the Puy de D6me.] W. B. Pillsbury. ' The Ego and Empirical Psychology.' [The three advantages claimed for the assertion of the presence of a self above or beside its content are illusory. We can no more conceive a knower knowing the elements of knowledge than we can conceive the mental states knowing themselves ;- besides, some element must know itself, unless we are to have an infinite regress or an unknown term. The unity of mental states is no more conceivable with an absolute unitary substance in or beside them than would be the unity of the states themselves, uncontained or un- accompanied. And the persistence of the substance always identical with itself does not immediately account for the fact that all experi- ences seem to belong together, to be all my experiences. Nevertheless, the need for the unity and identity of mental states is a real need, and the problem of how mental states are known is a real problem. We have unity in mind because all experiences, past and present, interact in the control and constitution of every apparently discrete act; in some degree or other all experiences, no matter how far separated in time, combine into a single element in each moment's experience. This unity and identity is dynamic, not static ; it is also not merely constructive, but (as we learn from pathology, from the study of the subconscious, and from normal psychology) actual. The self is thus simply all that we are and know, organised, self-unified and self-identical ; a growing vital unity that as a whole is effective in every experience. As for the problem of the knowing of mental states, it is the same as that of knowing things. The process of knowing, in both cases, is the process of making a refer- ence to other elements previously organised into a type. For neither do we need a knower; knowing is just the combining of old mental states with new: if there be a knower, it is experience as a whole.] G. S. Fullerton. 'The Right to Believe at One's Own Risk.' [The right to believe is, evidently, a moral, not a logical or legal right. Hence it is better to diseard the words "at our own risk," and, recog- nising the moral responsibility to ourselves and to the community under which we all stand, to discuss the right to believe with a full conscious- ness of such responsibility. The right may be granited, in the sense that the development of the life of man demands that he be allowed to go beyond objective evidence in accepting ideals and systems of practice. But then the right is limited, and its limits must be determined by a consideration of what is wholesome and helpful to the life of man. This rules out, first, a number of choices: arbitrary choices; choices dictated</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 287 by vanity, craving for originality, the pose of piety, etc. It suggests, secondly, that the views which it is desirable for a man to accept and to use in the regulation of his Jife are, ordinarily, those to which he has been born. The example of Descartes shows that this precept need not spell philistinism. The philosopher, in particular, should strive to avoid the detachment from all that is human that rejects every ideal not com- pletely supported by objective evidence, and at the same time to avoid the blindness that assumes the objective truth of whatever may be the goal of his desire.] Discussion. J. Dewey. 'Pure Experience and Reality: a Disclaimer.' E. B. MoGilvary. 'Pure Experience and Reality: a Reassertion.' [Discussion of McGilvary's critical paper in vol. xvi., No. 3.] Reviews of Books. Notices of New Books. Sum- maries of Articles. Notes. Vol. xvi., No. 5. J. Watson. 'Plato and Protagoras.' [The clear opposition in the Protagoras of the two antagonistic views, represented by Protagoras and Socrates respectively, is a proof that Plato entered sympathetically into each, while satisfied with neither. In the Thecetetus, it is Plato's object to show that the view of Protagoras, which practically amounts to saying that there is no criterion of truth but the individual's conviction, or belief, or inability to think otherwise, is untenable. He limits this view, first of all, to judgments of perception, and is thus able to connect it with Theaetetus' assertion that knowledge is sensible perception. He then goes on to connect it with the Heraclitean doctrine that all things are in flux. The doctrine thus elaborated, and referred by Plato to the followers of Protagoras, is substantially the same as modern pragmatism. To clear t-he ground for a fresh attack upon the whole principle, Plato restates the simpler doctrine of Protagoras himself, removing the restriction under which he has so far been considering it: what is now affirmed is that all judgments, and not merely those of perception, are true for each man. Plato's main objections are that the theory contradicts itself, and that it does not account even for the existence of particular judgments. These objections apply with equal force to the most recent forms of relativism.] E. B. Talbot. ' The Philosophy of Fichte in Its Relation to Pragmatism.' [(1) An important difference in theory of knowledge lies in Fichte's recognition of constraint as an element in knowing. Pragmatism fails to make a place for this aspect of the knowing process in its explanation of experience; Fichte seeks to explain the deter- minateness of experience in terms of the realisation of the Idea of the Ego. (2) The doctrine that all judgment is purposive thought is common to Fichte and the pragmatists; indeed, it is practically a commonplace of philosophy. Fichte, however, does not conceive, as pragmatism inclines to do, that thinking exists for the sake of practical ends in the narrow sense. (3) By the primacy of the practical reason Fichte does not mean that our moral nature can establish for us theoretical proposi- tions that the intellect is unable to establish; he means only that certain propositions which we are wont to call theoretical are not theoretical after all.] G. S. Fullerton. ' In What Sense Two Persons Perceive the Same Thing.' [(1) To explain the fact that one person may perceive the same thing at two times or in two ways we must posit an objective order of experience, clearly distinct from the order of sensations and ideas. Any one of a whole series of experiences, existing at different times, may then represent the one thing. (2) To explain the like fact that two persons may perceive the same thing, we must accept the doctrine of ejects; we recognise more than one subjective order, and relate each of them to the objective. (3) There is but one objective order; for it is possible, by using this order as a bridge, to pass from the experience of one mind to the experience of another.

[Loss of the tympanic membranes and of most of the chain of ossicles in both ears may coexist with efficient auditory acuity, and does not prevent the generation of subjective difference-tones. The case suggests that the function of the tympanic m,echanism is rather pro- tective or physiological than conducting or physical.] F. DE. Urban. 'On the Method of Just Perceptible Differences.' [Treatment of the method by the law of probabilities, with illustrations from experiments on lifted weights. The theoretical basis of the method is the same as that of the error method; its data can be worked out by the algorithm of the method of right and wrong cases; its result is that amount of difference for which there exists the probability one-half that it will be recognised.] S. S. Colvin. 'The Ultimate Value of Experience.' [Ultimate experience, which as subject cannot be known, is symbolised in every experience by a group of objects which seem to have value and finality in themselves. On the basis of this immanent experience have arisen utilitarianism and pragmatism; both systems have, however, come to ignore their origin, disregarding the ultimate worth of that part of our experience which is relatively subjective and does not ordinarily enter into the flux of a constantly changing world. On the other hand, intuitive ethics and absolute logic are able to consider the impulses and feelings that constitute this part of experience; they are also held to function for a pure experience. Here is the psyehological basis for a philosophy of permanent values and transcendent significance.] J. M. Baldwin. 'On Truth.' [The author takes memory and thought as typical and analogous cases of mediate control. He finds it easy to show, against pragmatism, that memory is not correct or accurate because we can act on it, but rather that we can act on it (instead of on its original) because it is correct; we can establish correctness without implicating the motive to the specific sort of action. Before going on to deal with truth, he distinguishes the theory of knowledge through con- trol (the point of view of his Thought and Things) from that of control through knowledge, the position of Dewey and his school. Noting, then, in the case of truth, the progress in the kind of mediati-on which would banish the external control factor, he traces, first, the twofold movement by which the control of reflection as mode of inner experience is constituted-the development of validity pure and simple, and the persistent return of the control of fact through the demands of action in concrete life; and, secondly, the movement whereby the individual judg- ment becomes synnomic. The self of judgment proves to be that of common function; truth is not a matter of individual interpretation, whether in terms of action or of cognition. In fine, the characters of truth are those attaching to the content of judgment as being under mediate control, and the meaning of truth is to mediate the original sphere of existence-meaning in which it arose.] Discussion.

'The Psychology of Chess and of Learning to Play It.' [Chess appeals to the fundamental fighting impulse, and to the aesthetic -and puzzle-solving interests; it also affords the pleasure of being a cause. Visual imagination is an important element in playing, but may be replaced by motor, verbal or auditory imagery. Skill at chess is not a valid index of high mental endowment. The learning of chess shows a progressive organisation of knowledge, making possible the direction of attention to the relations of increasingly larger and more complex units.] L. R. Geissler. ' Fluctuations of Attention to Cuta- neous Stimuli.' [Repetition and Variation of Wiersma's experiments with weights, and Ferree's with electrical stimulus. Attention focussed upon liminal and supraliminal cutaneous sensations may remain approxi- mately constant for at least 2 to 3 min., if adaptation of the organ and intruding distractions can be ruled out. There is no evidence of fluctuation: normally the sensation fades out steadily and gradually with the course of adaptation.] G. M. Whipple.

[Odours, saturating pictures, were no more effective for recall than nonsense syllables (auditory stimulus), and were distinctly less effective than simple geometrical figures drawn in a corner of the pictures.] J. E. Coover and F. Angell. 'General Practice Effect of Special Exercise.' [(1) The training of discrimination by auditory stimuli is transferred to the discrimination of brightness stimuli; the factors are largely due to habituation and to economic adaptation of attention, that is, are of a general character. (2) Training the activity of reaction with discrimination and choice by sorting cards into com- partments increases the facility of a like activity both in speed and in regularity in the typewriter reaction: the causes of transference are the formation of a habit of direct reaction without useless concomitants, a resulting equitable distribution of attention to the various possible reactions, and the consequent power of concentrating the attention throughout the series.] A. H. Pierce. ' Gustatory Audition; a hitherto Undescribed Variety of Synoesthesia.' [Description of case, with tests. 'Gustatory' is used in a wide sense, to cover the four taste qualities, the'cutaneous qualities of pressure and temperature, and the tactual-motor experiences of texture, consistency, etc. These con- comitants are aroused by spoken words or nonsense-syllables and by musical and other non-vocal sounds.

Schiller inquires whether if truth is to be defined as, 'thinking the environment as it is' this is the sole condition of truth and the agent's purpose is wholly irrelevant, or whether it is merely necessary to, recognise also a reality other than that purpose, and thinks that Russell has changed his ground. Gives a pragmatic rendering of the phrase ' not, knowing the way out' when 'lost, and asks Russell to define his position. more clearly as regards scepticism. II. (a) Russell denies that he has changed his ground. (b) He has meant all along that though there is a. subjective side to knowing, yet the objective side alone makes an idea. 'true'. (e) He thinks the pragmatic interpretation of 'not knowing the. way ' too paradoxical. (d) He rejects the pragmatist distinction between. claims and truths, because pragmatism cannot consistently distinguish. between a truth and its verification. (e) He concludes that the meaning of .terms has been so changed by the pragmatist that there can be no. 'reasoning together 'with the intellectualist. III. Schiller replies (a) that Russell's original phrase was ambiguous: (b) that Russell has made no. attempt to evaluate the subjective side of knowing and that his doctrine of truth is mere assertion: (c) that Russell has overlooked the transitions. between the functional and the potential value, of truths, and illustrates: (d) that consequently pragmatism can recognise verifiable, while intel- lectualism must recognise unveriftable truths, which are meaningless to, the pragmatist: (e) that both parties have the duty of explaining current' usage, but that while pragmatism is able to do this, no coherent intel-- lectualist theory of truth has yet been devised.] iv., 19.

First stands the stage of inarticulate vocal utterance: groans, hysterical convulsions, interjectory- cries, musical automatisms. Glossolalia proper then appears at three levels: as pseudo-language, pure.and simple, in which there is no deter- minate correspondence between articulation and idea; as a system of neologisms, glossopoiesis, illustrated by the Martian of Helen Smith;, and as an intermediate form, in which incoherence is mingled with occasional neologistic formations. Finally, xenoglossia shows itself, first, in the introduction of single foreign words, more or less corrupted in form; then in linguistic counterfeits like the Hindoo texts of H. Smith; *and lastly, if the phenomena are genuine, in the gift of tongues.

Dupuis. 'L'Hallucination du Point de Vue Psychologique.' [Develops Baillarger's view that hallucination depends on the relaxation of attention and a resulting "ext6riorite spontanee de la representation ". Criticises Tamburini and Taine. Hallucination involves an identical content, and " the mental attitude of perception," but without the conscious direction and supervision of ideas by volition, ,or the " personal synthesis" which results in the " feeling of continuity".] Analyses et Comptes Rendus.

His synthesis too simple for the wealth of phenomena included; too abstract: this appears in the limitations of his culture, e.g. -his misconception of history and the classics. His taste mediocre and -spoiled by the critical, analytic spirit. In his extreme intellectuality and his devotion to work he resemnbles Spinoza. He will not lose by his biography.] R. Cousinet.

Prof. Busse died on 12th September, 1907, having not quite completed his forty-fifth year. A follower of Lotze, he taught philosophy for five years at Tokyo, lecturing in English. On the question of the relations be- tween mind and body he upheld the theory of mutual interaction.] Aloys Muller. ' Ueber Atomismus und Mechanismus.' [Atomism, defined as ' an expression of the discontinuity of matter,' is, contrary to the opinion of Ostwald and others, a necessary scientific hypothesis. But it cannot adequately express the ultimate reality of things because it assumes the objectivity of space. Now space (and time) while doubtless possessing a certain objectivity, are, as we know them, so conditioned by our sub- jectivity as to veil the real world from us. Mechanical causation is also an incomplete expression of the truth, as is shown by the irreversibility of physical sequences-a fact proved not only by experience.but by the calculus of probabilities-and also by the law of evolution.] Ernst Mally 'Das Mass der Verschiedenheit.'

'Die historische Anarchie der philosophischen Systeme und das Problem der Philosophie als Wissen- schaft.' [A well-written and stimulating essay. The writer begins by expressing his satisfaction at the revival of philosophical studies which has succeeded to the utter discredit that attended them within living memory in Germany. Yet the great historic systems of philosophy still remain hopelessly irreconcilable, and the critical attempt to find a new basis for philosophy in epistemology has merely resulted in equally irreconcilable theories of knowledge. At the same time the steady pro- gress of universally admitted scientific truth accentuates the bankruptcy of pure speculation. Nevertheless the writer bids us not to despair. We must expect the evolution of philosophy to be slower than that of any science. Nor is the contrast so great as is commonly supposed. Scientific men are far from being agreed either about the methods or the ascertained results of physical investigation. One regards ether and atoms as proved ; another would banish such ideas altogether. The subject is to be con- tinued in another number.] Rezensionen, etc. ZEITSCHRIFT F. PSYCHOLOGIE. Bd. xlv., Heft 5. M. Levy. ' Studien iuber die experimentelle Beeinflussung des Vorstellungsverlaufes.' [The method of abruptly called-out single words may evoke three forms of reaction: the normal (sense of insult, or mere surprise), the inter- mediate, physiological or psychological (questioning interpretation, or acceptance with brief comment), or the pathological (picking-up of the word into the flight of ideas). The associations aroused are classified, from the subjectivist standpoint, as (1) those of personal narrative, (2) those of personal reference, (3) neutral and irmpersonal: these last may be object, verbal or dissociative associations.] R. HNamann. ' Uber die psychologischen Grundlagen des Bewegungsbegriffes,' il. [Move- ment perceived upon an empty background (spot of light in dark) depends upon a vague appreciation of the contour of the field of vision. Movement may be predicated on the basis of ' common feeling,' with reproduction (but without the actual presence) of a visual movement- image. In plastic art, movement is suggested through the observer's imitative tendency; in pictorial, either by incomplete or by unclear representation. The paper contains explanations of most of the familiar illusions of movement.] Literaturbericht. Bd. xlv., Heft 6. E. Becher. ' Kritik der Widerlegung des Parallelismus auf Grund einer</page><page sequence="12">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 297 " naturwissenschaftlichen " Analyse der Handlung durch Hans Driesch.' [From his scientific standpoint Driesch employs two criteria which decide him against parallelism: the criterion of individuality of cor- relation, and that of an historical basis of reaction. Neither of these, however, is incompatible with mechanism. The real difficulty appears when we combine the criteria and ask: how is individuaility,of correla- tion mechanically possible on the ground of the historical basis of re- action ? The answer is found in the assumption of a preformation which is not absolutely individualised but covers a whole series of related connexions of stimulus and reaction: the action-stimuli work as units only within the limits of such preformation; in other cases the elements of a stimulus-complex work as elements. Driesch's position thus proves to be untenable, even when made stronger than he himself had made it. In general, Driesch has brought no proof of the im- possibility of an antivitalistic standpoint. Hence vitalism cannot be regarded as a secure basis for interaction.] W. Warstat. ' Die Bilder- rahmen; ein Kapitel angewandter .Esthetik.' [Criticises Foth's doctrine that the frame should further the associations upon which the aesthetic illusion depends. A frame, first of all, brings the picture as whole into relief (cf. the gold frames of the picture galleries). It may then work in two ways: by colour and by line or ornament. The colour affects our mood, either harmoniously (gold suggests pomp and a certain stiffness) or by way of contrast; the ornament suggests sympathetic movements, slow or quick, violent or feeble, delicate or clumsy.] Literaturbericht.</page></plain_text>
