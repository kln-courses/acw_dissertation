Partition Literature: A Study of Intizar Husain MUHAMMAD UMAR MEMON University of Wisconsin-Madison I IN an interview given in July 1974,1 Intizdr .Husain, one of the most perceptive creative writers of Pakistan, had this to say about the exper- ience of migration that was the direct outcome of the Partition of India in 1947: A decade ago when I was talking about the experience of migration and the articles I wrote concerning it,2 I was in a state of great hope and optimism. It was then my feeling that in the process of the Partition we had suddenly, almost by accident, regained a lost, great experience-namely, the experience of migration, hijrat, which has a place all its own in the history of the Muslims -and that it will give us a lot. But today, after our political ups and downs, I find myself in a different mood. Now I feel that sometimes a great experience comes to be lost to a nation; often nations forget their history. I do not mean that a nation does, or has to, keep its history alive in its memory in every period. There also comes a time when a nation completely forgets its past. So, that experience, I mean the experience of migration, is unfortunately lost to us and on us. And the great expectation that we had of making something out of it at a creative level and of exploiting it in developing a new consciousness and sensibility-that bright expectation has now faded and gone.3 An earlier version of this paper was read at the conference Historical Interaction Between Hinduism and Islam in South Asia held under the auspices of University of Minnesota at Minneapolis on May 2I and 22, 1976.

According to IHusain, the creation of Pakistan not only gave the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent a sense of direction and purpose, a present and the hope for a future, but also a past, or, at least, the desire to know their past. The unchallenged ascendancy of such ideas as nationalism, love of humanity, reform of the society in Urdu literature in time yielded to a wholly new theme focused on the experience of 'migration,' which became the dominant experience of the time im- mediately following Partition. The experience/theme of 'migration' gained greater currency among Urdu writers although it did not completely oust other themes, which continued to be cultivated by a number of them. Numerically small, these writers nevertheless stand out prominently in the history of Urdu letters because they allowed their inner selves, their modes of perception and feeling to be affected by the experience of 'migration.' Thus, a large segment of Indo-Pakistan Muslim community did feel the impact of this experience in one form or another, and a group of poets and prose writers, however small, did consciously try to make this experience the pivotal concern of its creative endeavour. The question of mental migration was posed even for those who had not physically migrated.s The hijrat, in its widest possible sense and with all its ramifications, has a place all its own in the history of the Muslims. 'It is a recurrent phenomenon,' writes Husain, 'which through a long and arduous process of suffering experienced both on external and internal planes [of the self] succeeds in transforming itself eventually into a major creative experience.' 6 In those stormy days of 1947, it was not simply a 'question of migrating from one region to another, rather, it was one of migrating from an old to a new country.'7 It was a creative moment in which Prophet Muhammad's migration from Mecca to Medina was reenacted, with all the concomitant freedom to give direction to an encapsulated 4 As far as I am aware, HIusain is the only Muslim writer who has given this ex- perience a dimension both in time and space. 5 Cf.

Thus conceived, the hijrat would be seen as a progression from an external event to an intense, internal spiritual 'experience.' In fact, this was the central theme of that time and was treated with particular intensity and fondness by such writers as Qurratu 'l-'Ain .Haidar, A. Hamid, Nasir Ki~mi and Intigzr IHusain. The new experience greatly affected the perception and judgements of writers. They now began to look at the past as not entirely negative, to be best forgotten, but also as having some intrinsic merit. The exper- ience of migration made it possible for the writer to reassess his earlier, totally negative view of past cultures and societies.8 In the domain of poetry, the new experience contributed to the resuscitation of the ghazal, (which had been stifled to a premature death by the ascendancy of the na.m), and transformed it with a new and astonishingly powerful and exuberant series of images.9 Yet there is a pervading sense of gloom, skepticism and failure in Ijusain's words because this dominant experience failed to inspire enduring works of literature. He, moreover, sees this literary failure as in some sense related to a general failure in the political world. In his sense of failure lies the reality of the betrayal of an ideal. No endeavour, whether in the realm of literature or in the domain of politics, ap- proaches this ideal. IHusain's observations do incorporate a substantial core of truth. Except for occasionally brilliant flashes, the entire corpus of Urdu writing inspired by the political event of the Partition does not, indeed, constitute what Husain would consider lasting and enduring literature. 0 Talking less categorically, however, one cannot deny that some good pieces of creative writing have also resulted from the experience of Partition. The term 'Partition Literature' is a vague one. The Partition of India was a multi-dimensional phenomenon which was bound to touch, as 8 The Progressive writers were particularly fond of playing down the role of past societies and cultures. 9 The revival of the ghazal itself may be viewed as an effort to define one's cultural personality; hence its predominance among the Urdu poets of Pakistan. The Pro- gressive poets, on the other hand, generally preferred the nazm. 10 A similar view has been expressed by Ramesh Mathur in regard to Hindi, for which see Ramesh Mathur and M. Kulasrestha, Writings on India's Partition (Calcutta: Simant Publications India, 1976), p. 17.</page><page sequence="4">380 MUHAMMAD UMAR MEMON indeed it did, the Hindu and Muslim masses at different levels. For some it stirred up only memories of the rioting and bloodbath that followed. For some, especially for Muslims, the event necessitated defin- ing their national identity and cultural personality. For Muslims, therefore, important questions were raised: What and where were their cultural roots ? How are they to interpret the harsh reality of the moral fall of man within the larger and, perhaps, more enduring context of the Indo-Muslim civilization of the Subcontinent? Still others, once the anguish resulting from the communal violence had subsided, thought of the situation in pragmatic terms. They concerned themselves with the problems of social and emotional rehabilitation of the refugees, particularly female refugees, in their new homes.11 Thus the Partition offered a variety of facets and experiences, and different writers chose to emphasize various aspects. But the great majority of them generally wrote about the communal violence, which, in the consciousness of many, became the most representative aspect of the Partition experience. This tendency to limit the experience to one aspect is clearly misleading. I shall return to the reasons for the pre- dominance of this tendency; for the present, however, any writing that poses or attempts to answer or even pursue a question inspired directly or indirectly by the Partition must be included within the body of Partition literature. Why the tendency to limit the experience of Partition to only one of its offshoots, and an unnecessary offshoot at that? One answer that comes readily to mind is the near-universal impact of the rioting itself. There was hardly a Muslim family that had not lost one member or more in the process of migration, or had not at least been affected in some way by the incident. The rioting had totally seized the minds of people, its memory haunted them and kept them tormented, even after they had made it to the safety of the promised land. Thus the fiction that emerged during and soon after the heat and chaos of the Partition presents little more than variations on the all-pervasive theme of communal violence. But this answer appears neither compelling nor sufficient. Upon reflection it becomes clear that communal violence cannot by itself constitute the very basis, or be an organic part, of a historical event- such an organic part that without it the realization of that event would be unthinkable. Indeed, had the year 1946 'been used for a peaceful, planned and rapid population exchange and a methodical rehabilita- 11 A representative work on this theme is Qudratu 'l-Ldh Shahib's novelette ra khuda.</page><page sequence="5">PARTITION LITERATURE: STUDY OF INTIZAR HUSAIN 381 tion, as was suggested by the Muslim League leaders and also by a few farsighted Congress leaders, the human massacre of 1947 on the Indian soil could have been averted.'12 Some of the more perceptive writers came to realize-and Muhammad .Hasan 'Askari, a prominent Urdu critic, even went so far as to declare-that the rioting cannot become the subject of true literature.13 Thus the rioting does not by itself give us much clue as to the necessity of the historical event of Partition whose one possible, though peripheral, outcome it was. The predilection of the writer for communal violence as the only reality to have emerged from the Partition raises some disturbing questions about the world-view of the writer himself. What, if anything, did he see in the division of the country ? Was it, or was it not, a histori- cal necessity ? Unfortunately, for most Urdu writers India's division and the subsequent emergence of Pakistan had no deeper meaning. They could not view the incident within a larger historical and cultural context. Most of the stories woven around the theme of Partition leave one with the distinct impression that the writer is not here attempting to describe reality, but, rather, avoid it by focusing his attention on intrinsically less significant elements. The treatment remains superficial and artificial due perhaps to the desire to appear impartial. The hero is forced to react not according to the dictates of his personality and nature, but according to an ideal superimposed upon his individuality. The necessity or the forces leading to the Partition are hardly ever reflected upon, nor the specific problems resulting from the incident isolated for treatment, not at least at this early stage. One gets the impression that the writer does not like the Partition, that it has in his view given rise to deep human misery. One is therefore forced to conclude that the writer either looks at the Partition negatively or rejects it, but provides no compelling historical or rational basis for either judgement. However tentative and cursory this negative attitude and rejection may be, it nevertheless flows directly from a world-view that was prevalent among the Urdu writers at the time of Partition. What was this world-view ? III At this point it is necessary to talk about the Progressive (Writers') 12 Mathur and Kulasrestha, Writings on India's Partition, p. 16. 13 As quoted in Mumtdz Shirifi, 'Pdkistdan adab ke char sal,' in her Mi'ydr (Lahore: NayA Idarah, 1963), p. 171.</page><page sequence="6">382 MUHAMMAD UMAR MEMON Movement (PM). The PM14 was launched in the mid-thirties in the effort to restore to man his lost human dignity. For most of the Progres- sive writers, man, though the only meaningful reality in existence, was nevertheless a reality in the present moment.15 All wars had to be fought in man's name and for his material betterment.16 The Progressive writing was thus charged with the formidable task of promoting ideals of social justice and reform, and equal distribution of wealth. The PM declared war not only against the decadent forces operating within Muslim and Hindu societies, but also against the hated rule of the British. Indeed some writers, among them Raijindar Singh Badi, who otherwise had no affinity with the ideological formalism being pro- moted by the PM, nevertheless came under its influence because of its 'anti-imperialist slant.'"7 The imperialist designs of the alien British had to be thwarted if the programme of the PM itself was to make any headway. 14 On this Movement, see Khalilu 'r-Ralbmn A'zami, Urdii mei taraqqi-pasand tahrzik (Aligarh: Anjuman-e-Taraqqi-e-Urdfi, 1972); Carlo Coppola, 'Urdu Poetry, 1935-1970: The Progressive Episode' (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, Chicago University, 1975); Hafeez Malik, 'Marxist Literary Movement in India and Pakistan,' Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 26, No. 4 (August 1967), pp. 649-64; G6pal Mittal, Adab mtni taraqqi-pasandi (Delhi: National Academy, 1958); Mumtaz Shirifi,' Taraqqi- pasand adab,' 'Pdkistnin adab ki chdr sal,' and 'Fasiddt par hamirg afsdne,' in her Mi'yjr (Lahore: Nayd Iddrah, 1963), PP. 139-47, I71-98, and 199-228; Sajjd .Zahir, Rdshnd'i (Delhi: Azad Kitdb-ghar, 1959). 15 Indeed, it is revealing to note that much of the scathing criticism of RIabindra Nath Tagore by Akhtar .Husain Rd'Epfiri (on him see Coppola, 'Urdu Poetry, 1935-1970,' n. Io on p. Io9) stems from the former's love of the past. Thus, RA'pfipri writes, 'None of Tagore's literary achievements are free of this conflict of past and present. He has a great, extreme hatred for the present. ... Not that life has expanded to infinity; rather, instead of expanding into eternity, it has shrunk into an instant of "today" and now' (as quoted in ibid., p. 121). 16 To quote selectively from the London version of the Manifesto: '... Indian literature, since the breakdown of classical literature, has had the fatal tendency to escape from the actualities of life. It has tried to find refuge from reality in spiritualism and idealism.... Witness the mystical devotional obsession of our literature, its furtive and sentimental attitude towards sex, . . . its almost total lack of rationality. ... It is the object of our association to rescue literature and other arts from the priestly, academic and decadent classes in whose hands they have degenerated so long; to bring the arts into the closest touch with the people; and to make them the vital organ which will register the activities of life, as well as lead us to the future. .... We believe that the new literature of India must deal with the basic problems of our existence to-day-the problems of hunger and poverty, social backwardness and political subjugation ...' (as quoted in ibid., pp. 63-4; for the full text of the Manifesto and its different versions, see pp. 63-6 and 161-4). 11 Cf.

Savird was a staunch supporter of the PM and at one time its semi-official organ. On page I of Issue 2-undated, but which internal evidence reveals to have been published shortly before Partition, possibly in June or July I947-Savird defines itself as 'A Series [Devoted to the Trans- mission] of the Thought of Modern Writers.' This changes to 'Inter- preter of the Creative Output of Progressive Writers' with Issue 3 and to 'Interpreter of Literature's Progressive Movement' with Issue 4. Thus, with Issue 4, Savird becomes, avowedly, an organ of the Progressive writers. Edited jointly by Ahmad Nadim Qasmi-a well-known Pakistani Progressive and Secretary of the All Pakistan Progressive Writers' Association (APPWA)-and Nadir Chaudhri-proprietor of the small publishing establishment NayJ Idirah-Savird No. 2 exudes in its lyrical editorial an unmistakable optimism about India's coming liberation (Savird being, thus, a most fitting title for a periodical launched on the eve of independence), as well as underscoring the need for revolution (pp. 4-5). By revolution is meant the alliance of the working and oppressed Indian masses against the British, who must quit India, and their hobnobbers, the native land-owning class, whose power must be irreparably broken. This revolutionary mandate is reinforced in the articles of Zahir Kdshmiri (pp. 40-8) and Mirzi Muhammad Husain (pp. 49-56), and in a translated extract from Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru's The Discovery of India (pp. 57-64). The inclusion of the last only makes the absence of what is left out more conspicuous. Coming as it did on the very eve of India's Partition, what, one wonders, prompted Savird No. 2 to abstain altogether from making any reference to either Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the Muslim League, or the Muslim demand for Pakistan ? If the editors of this issue and their many contributors chose to ignore questions of Muslim identity and culture in South Asia and the need for the creation of Pakistan, it was largely because a division of the country along religious and cultural lines was itself the greatest barrier in the realization of the Progressives' utopian dream of a free and socialist India based, preeminently, on communal harmony. Yet it was just this 'com- munal harmony' which Muslim leadership had the common sense</page><page sequence="8">384 MUHAMMAD UMAR MEMON to visualize, as early as the last quarter of the nineteenth century, as unattainable so long as cultural incompatibility divided the Hindus and Muslims. Rather, the Progressives found Nehru's sentimental attach- ment to a united India more appealing. Nehru, it has been maintained, 'abhorred the very idea of communalism,' thought of it as 'an unbeliev- able anachronism,' and 'refused to recognise the communal problem as such and understood it only in terms of economic disparity.'18 Small wonder, therefore, if neither Iqbil nor his idea of Pakistan could find a niche in this dream. Indeed both had become anathema to many Progressive Urdu writers already a good decade before Partition. Akhtar IIusain Rai'pfiri, a zealous Progressive who later became disenchanted with the PM and repudiated it, had, as early as 1933, denounced Iqbal as a 'reactionary' and the idea of Pakistan as 'Islamic Fascism.'19 Amidst this idealistic thinking the stark reality of August 1947 was staring the Progressive full in the face. After a brief interruption Savird resumed publication with Issue 3, which probably appeared in early 1948. One would have expected the reality of communal feeling and violence to have compelled even the most enthusiastic Progressives to rethink their earlier stance of a united India based on communal accord. Instead, Savird No. 3, now joined by a third editor, Sthir Ludhyinvi-who later built himself no mean fortune in the Indian film industry as a prospering lyric writer-vehemently denounced the Parti- tion as a sad byproduct of religious fanaticism. It also pledged to exert itself maximally in preserving the common literary and culturalheritage (p. 5), but felt no need to define or present even the broadest outline ofthis 'common literary and cultural heritage' it was pledging to preserve. Much of what was said in this and the next few issues had an air of being painfully d'.jd vu: August 15 had not led to true independence, owing to the alignment of the Indian bourgeoisie with the Anglo-American imperialist block; the writer must declare solidarity with workers and peasants, etc. No. 3, however, also carried a special section of writing, both prose and poetry, devoted to 'August 15' (pp. 10-52), and No. 4 mourned Gandhi's assassination and paid glowing tribute to his excep- tional genius (pp. I2-30). (What has irked some Pakistani writers, 18 Mathur, Writings on India's Partition, p. 16. 19 Cf. Fateh Muhammad Malik, Ta'assubdt (Lahore: Maktaba-e-Funfin, 1973), P. 77.

Their importance was, however, evident to some older Progressives. Thus Chirdtgh IHasan IHasrat,21 'Abdu 'l-Majid Sdlik22 and M. D. Ta'sir showed an acute awareness of these questions in their writings. This may have been due to their age, traditional training, and culture, but, more importantly, to the fact that Progressivism did not represent to them a narrow Marxist orientation. To extricate Progres- sivism alive from the bog of Marxism into which it had been pushed by the Progressives, Ta'sir wrote, as early as 1948, an article in which he reviewed the status of dance, music, drama, film, painting, calligraphy, as well as other arts and crafts in contemporary Pakistan. He warned that unless the creation of Pakistan were used to infuse confidence in Muslim personality and identity, lack of faith and absence of belief so pervasive in the period would carry all cultural life away in its torrential sweep. He also bluntly asked the Pakistanis whether they had any pride in being Pakistanis.23 The answer came in the form of a ringing denunciation by no other than the Pakistani Marxist/Progressive poet, Zahir KStshmiri.24 Zahir also used this opportunity to subject Samad Shahin and Muhlammad IHasan "Askari, both non-Progressives, to a vitriolic frontal attack. In .ahir's view, the former had outraged the Progressives by establishing a new (i.e., Pakistani) school of literature, the latter by dubbing them as disloyal to Pakistan. In reality, however, "Askari had tried only to articulate Muslim consciousness and define the role of literature within the newly-emergent Pakistan in his article 'Our Literary Consciousness and Muslims,' which appeared in the first issue of Urdu Adab.25 The Progressives, for their part, did not go beyond paying mere lip service to a vague and ill-defined 'common literary and cultural heritage.' Rather, they tried to purge from literature any discussion of a nascent Pakistani nationalism or ideology and Muslim culture.

Savird's Progressive contributors, most of whom were Muslims, continued to think of India's partition as a conspiracy of the British and their cohorts, the native feudal aristocracy, and to consider the rioting a logical consequence of the communal ill-will the seeds of which had been sown by the Cabinet Mission Plan of I6 February I946 and the Mountbatten Plan of 3 June 1947 (No. 3, P. 233). They still drew inspiration from the Russian Revolution, Nehru and Gandhi, whose assassination prompted a number of eulogies, all published in Savird. Still they strove somehow to write off the Partition, for it was the sad offspring of an 'independence which added nothing significant to history' (Nos 5-6, p. 243) and while 'the womb of 1947 had given birth to the damsel of independence, it had also to India's partition, com- munal riots, and a series of inhuman crimes perpetrated by religious fanaticism-crimes that were the product of a reactionary leadership imposed upon progressive masses' (ibid.). When, however, that proved impossible, the elders of the PM relented somewhat and allowed a measure of freedom to the membership, in that the central leadership of the Movement would not make too much of a member's defending Pakistan.27 That was the farthest the Movement could or did go in accommodating itself to the reality of Pakistan. It is, however, instructive to note that shortly after setting foot in Pakistan, where he had been sent by the Communist Party of India to forge the disarrayed Pakistani intellectuals into a formidable Communist organization, Saiyid Sajjid Zahir, himself a prominent Marxist and Progressive, offered the advice: 'Every honest man ought to be genuine- ly happy at Indo-Kashmir alliance and ought to work towards its success.'28 And "Abdullah Malik clamoured: 'Loyalty to people-not to state !'29 Any ideological deviation, however slight, or even a mere verbal expression of solidarity by a Pakistani Progressive with fellow Muslims outside Pakistan on the basis of Islam and 'common culture' was sharply 26 After their arrival in Pakistan Shirifi and her husband Samad continued to publish the periodical Naya Daur they had started in Bangalore, India. 27 Cf.

When Qasmi politely questioned the continued vacillation of the Progressives in accepting the creation of Pakistan even after it had become an incontrovertible reality,30 'Arif 'Abdu 'l-Matin, a man who cherished an extremely idealistic attitude towards Gandhi and had mourned the latter's death in a poem,31 quickly moved to discipline him by party mandate. Matin attacked Qasmi for being a 'revivalist' because he had the audacity to use such anachronistic terms as 'the mace of Mustafd [i.e., Prophet Muhammad],' 'idols,' 'the Ghaznavid monarch [i.e., Mahmfid],' 'Medina' and 'the Arabian Muhammad' in his poem 'Battle Cry of the Kashmiri Freedom Fighter.'32 The accusa- tion of 'revivalism' was extended also to another Progressive poet, Qatil Shifd'i,33 while Zahir Kdshmiri had to suffer the ignominy of being labelled as a 'revisionist,' a 'compromiser' who, moreover, used such an 'unscientific symbol' as 'mad house' to describe the world.34 Altogether, then, this thinking may be said to have dominated the Progressives effectively until the Communist Party of Pakistan was outlawed in July 1954 and deviously until 1958, when APPWA, considerably weakened since the fall of the CPP, itself ceased to exist. During this period Savird worked as a mouthpiece of the Progressive ideology. If it subsequently changed its stance, this, then, was the work of its new editor, I.1anif Rdma,35 a man with considerable literary and artistic pretensions. Although RamE had assumed editorship of Savird with Issue 15-16, it was with Issue 17-18 that the earlier Progressive motto came to be decisively dislodged in favour of the somewhat esoteric 'Literature and Art',36 and the pages of the magazine were made available to pro-Pakistan intellectuals such as 'Askari, Shirifi, Nisir K.zmi and Intiz.r .Husain, to name only a few. Some of these had been a few years ago dubbed as 'reactionaries,' 'revisionists,' and 'right-wing.' It was, again, in this issue that Jinnah's name and his efforts towards 30 Cf.

The premonition of this about-face, which must have appeared to the Progressives as shocking in its suddenness as it was humiliating in its tenor, was already apparent in Issue 13-14. In it the editors published on behalf of the Association of Pakistani Literary Journals an appeal to the Government of Punjab to return Savird the security deposit it had collected from the latter as a condition for licence renewal, because 'Savird has now changed its extremist policy and that as far as we know the Government of Punjab has not objected to Savird's current policy' (p. 6). Whatever this 'current policy' may have been, certainly it couldn't have been one drafted or favoured by the Progressives. V It is difficult, nor is there any need, to doubt the sincerity of the Pro- gressives' commitment and concern. But imposing restrictions upon creativity37 could only lead to tragic results. The obvious victim in the case of PM turned out to be the protagonist himself. Man in whose name the war was being fought emerged from it as less than himself. He was shrunken, curtailed and abbreviated as never before, though, perhaps, slightly better off than his predecessor in a material sense. This man lived in the present moment. He had no memory of the past, nor even the desire to know it, since any reference to the past carried with it the excruciating realization of his subjugation and cap- tivity. He had to be, therefore, acultural.38 37 For a balanced evaluation of the literary worth of the Progressives, and for a critique of their literary ideas, see N. M. RAshid, 'Interview,' Mahfil, Vol. 7, Nos. 1-2 (Spring-Summer 1971), pp. 1-2o. 38 The break with the past, the radical split between the inner and the outer implicit in the Progressive Manifesto could not remain hidden for long from the more perceptive writers. Sooner or later they managed to extricate themselves from its stultifying embrace. But some were less fortunate. The saddest casualty was, perhaps, Krishan Chandr who, according to his friend and contemporary Bidi, 'was com- pletely destroyed; he became a slogan-monger. He no longer makes distinctions between soul and body; he talks only of the body, of bad people, of absolutes. What happens inside a man he never considers' (cf. Mahfil, Vol. 8, Nos 2-3( Summer-Fall 1972), p. 151). N. M. RAshid credits the Progressives with having promoted a sense of social awareness among Indian writers, but criticizes them for putting literature in the service of a particular ideology and group. 'I have no quarrel with the Progressives,' he writes, 'in so far as they believe that literature should reflect a social consciousness,</page><page sequence="13">PARTITION LITERATURE: STUDY OF INTIZAR HUSAIN 389 It is perhaps for this reason that much of the Progressive writing, although it is informed and inspired by genuine human considerations, fails to see man as a continuity in time and space. Then again, for the Progressive writer, man is not a complex being in whom both good and evil are found, he is either basically good or basically evil.39 More than anything else, he is a practical materialist, a pure economic being, leading a surface existence, launched in the present moment, and behaving in a predictable way, devoid of any emotional depth or complexity. Even in the writing of Premchand, who initiated the tradition of social realism in Urdu fiction and who is justly considered the grandfather of Urdu short story, man regrettably remains 'utilitarian.'40 It is instruc- tive to note that in his presidential address to the First All-India Pro- gressive Writers' Conference, held at Lucknow on Io April 1936, Premchand defined the nature and purpose of literature as: 'Buddha, Christ, Muhammad, all the prophets, tried without success to lay the foundation of their equality and moral precepts. Today the distinction between high and low, rich and poor, is manifesting itself with a brutality which has never been surpassed before .... We shall fail again if we attempt to attain our goal with the help of religion.'41 Now, at the time of Partition, most Urdu writers were either zealous Progressives themselves or, at least, under the influence of the Progres- sives.42 It is not hard to see why these writers inclined heavily in favour of communal riots as being most representative of the Partition. They could not see in the event any deeper historical significance; in fact, from their peculiar point of view, the event itself was deplorable, alto- gether unnecessary.43 But, since it had occurred, it could not be alto- but I do differ with them when this social awareness in their view must be completely impersonal. This is indeed the denial of the whole creative process and of the raison d'btre of all creative activity' (cf. Mahfil, Vol. 7, Nos. 1-2 (Spring-Summer 1971), p. 7). 39 'The two extremes of human nature, the highest and the lowest, are generally reflected in the writing on communal riots' (Mumtiz Shirifi, 'Pakistani adab ke char sal,' in Mi'ylr, p. 174). 40 Mostly and generally; there are, however, some exceptions, for instance his famous short story 'Kafan' (The Shroud). 41 As quoted in Mohammed Sadiq, Twentieth-Century Urdu Literature (Baroda: Padmaja Publications, 1947), p. 61. 42 'All the prominent writers of Urdu,' remarks BEdi, 'have at one time or another been Progressive writers. The best of them have felt the stultifying atmosphere of the Movement and have come out to breathe a freer air' (cf. 'Interview,' Mahfil, Vol. 8, Nos 2-3 (Summer-Fall 1972), p. 148). Intizr H.usain, too, seems to have been under their pervasive influence but only in the initial stage of his career as a writer. He himself remarks that there was a time when he used to read the Progressive writers avidly and there were some of them whom he even idealized (cf. 'Interview,' Shab- khain, Vol. 8, No. 96 (July-September 1975) p. xx).</page><page sequence="14">390 MUHAMMAD UMAR MEMON gether ignored; so they concentrated on one of the minor aspects44 of the Partition, namely, the rioting, and in their treatment of this aspect, they generally appeared to adhere to their specific view of mat.45 VI After reducing Partition to mere communal violence, the Progressives and those under their pervasive influence did not, generally, take the next logical step of questioning the motivation behind this violence. Since they did not believe in the reality of communal feeling, they contented themselves merely by painting elaborate scenes of violence perpetrated by members of one faith against those of another, thereby evoking in the reader their own sense of disgust and indignation. Often this led to some very melodramatic situations. The nobility of emotion, combined with a considerable measure of fair-play, required that if the scoreboard did not show clear winners, neither did it show clear losers. The match of communal rampage and mayhem must end in a draw. Indeed, some writers were so overwhelmed by the responsibility of remaining neutral and by poetic justice that they wrote two separate sequences of abduction, rape and murder. Thus Kartar Singh Duggal-a Punjabi writer;, however-brings the 'gift of inde- pendence' to the young Sikh or Hihdu school teacher in the form of a 'Muslim houri,' Kulsiim, in the story that takes its name from her.46 Soon, however, Duggal finds his sense of fairness outraged. He moves quickly to make it up in the story 'He Abducted Her'47 by throwing the helpless Sikh or Hindu Rd-jkarni at the mercy of sexually aroused 43 The Progressives vociferously decried the creation of Pakistan for it could be justified only on religious grounds, while religion was something which they had, as Shirifi points out, excluded from the more important agents and manifestations of collective life (cf. Mi'ydr, p. 197). In support of her argument she quotes Muhammad .Hasan 'Askari, 'It was not out of some ill will on their part that the Progressives decried the creation of Pakistan but because of the blow they thought it administered to their ideology [of unity and nationalism]' (cf. ibid.). 44 Minor only in the larger historico-cultural context; in humanitarian terms, it was indeed a great tragedy. 45 This is perhaps the reason why most of the Progressive stories on the theme of Partition and the communal riots lack depth and conviction. The conscious, and thus perhaps artificial, effort to appear impartial, drove the bulk of the Progressive writers, as Shirifi has aptly observed, 'farther away from the reality' and rendered their writing quite 'lifeless' (Mi'ydr, p. 172). 46 English translation in Mathur and Kulasrestha, Writings on India's Partition, pp. 220-3. 47 Ibid., pp. 224-7.</page><page sequence="15">PARTITION LITERATURE: STUDY OF INTIZAR .HUSAIN 391 Shahz~d Khan, a Muslim. Shahzdd Khan, however, lets out 'a blood- curding [sic] scream' and starts to run, without gratifying his desire. Whether his flight is due to a sudden onrush of human feeling, the revenge of Heavens, or-in poor imitation of Mant6's Ishar Singh in the story ' Thandd gisht'48 (Cold Meat)-to a sudden frigidity, is best left to the reader's imagination. On the other hand, Krishan Chandr, who has probably written most on communal violence after Mant6, but in a more direct, and therefore less effective, way, generally attempts to fuse both sequences within single stories, most of which can be found in his collection Ham wahshi haii49 (We Are Brutes). The scene of communal violence in Krishan Chandr's story 'Andhg' (The Blind) (pp. 21-9) is Lahore. After plundering and sacking the property of Hindus and murdering as many of them as he could, when the protagonist of the story returns home, loaded with plundered gifts for his wife and children, he finds, in what turns out to be a curious and terribly laboured bouleversement, his own wife and children butchered by a group of Mahdsabhd'is. Blind with rage, he throws the gifts before the corpse of his wife, vows revenge, picks up a cleaver and dashes out, shouting: '.. . I am headed straight to Shdh 'Almi [Hindu majority area of Lahore]; let anyone who dares stop me. Alldhu Akbar!' Krishan Chandr tries to hold the scale with still steadier hands in the story 'A Prostitute's Letter' (pp. 42-51). On behalf of two abducted girls, a Bombay prostitute with the heart of gold addresses the Indian leader Nehru and the Pakistani leader Jinnah. The story, otherwise of doubtful literary merit, is nevertheless a masterpiece of tight-rope walking. Everything is laid out in pairs, neatly and with almost mathematical precision, with the writer-or prostitute, if you will- standing equidistant from the contrasting poles: BailS, 12 and Hindu, comes from a prospering and noble middle-class family of Rawalpindi (Pakistan). Muslim rioters sacked her house, murdered her parents, raped her and later sold her to a pimp from whom the prostitute in question has bought her. Batfil, i i and Muslim, daughter of a Pathan of Jullundur (India), has fared a similar fate at the hands of her tormentors, the Jdts, who first gouge out the eyes of her father, urinate in his mouth, cut him open from throat to abdomen, then rape her and her married sisters. She, too, is subsequently bought by this prostitute. 48 Thand. g isht, Lahore: Maktaba-e-Shi'r-o-Adab [19?]; English translation by C. M. Naim and Ruth L.

The quest for balance, justice and impartiality appears to be the guiding principle, and for that reason the limitation, also of the story 'Amritsar' in two parts 'Before Independence' (pp. 75-82) and 'After Independence' (pp. 83-1oo). In the Amritsar of pre-independence period members of all three faiths live in perfect communal accord; together they defy the alien rule and lay down their lives for their country. In pre-1947 Amritsar the poor Muslim Siddiq sacrifices his own life to save that of his rich neighbour Om Parkish; and four women -one Hindu (Pdr5), one Sikh (Sham Kaur), and two Muslim (Zainab, Begam)-while grocery shopping, heroically defy the British order to walk on their knees in the vicinity of Jallianwala Bagh; instead they walk with their heads proudly erect, and are forthwith reduced to corpses by a volley of bullets. The rhetoric of fellow-feeling is here evoked as a convenient structural ploy to heighten the trauma and immorality of the coming, indiscrimi- nate murder of one community by another in the second part. Soon after independence, one evening two special trains pull into Amritsar: one coming from 'free Pakistan' and carrying Hindus and Sikhs, only one-third of them alive, the rest dead; the other from 'free India' and carrying Muslims, again only a third of them alive, the rest dead. The train from Pakistan has the message inscribed on its forehead: 'Learn to kill from Pakistan'; the one headed for Pakistan, the retort: 'And learn from India how to take revenge.' The story, otherwise without any redeeming value, is made a bit poignant by an undertone of what appears to be casual, though not necessarily unintentional, cynicism. It is when Krishan Chandr turns man's inhumanity back upon his own coreligionists (a device used also by Agyeya in his Hindi story 'Muslim-Muslim Bhai-Bhai'5o to accen- tuate the absurdity of Partition, indeed of any chaotic situation). And the story ends with the usual, elaborate sermon. The ghosts of 'the martyrs' Siddiq, Om Parkish, Zainab, BEgam, Pdr5 and Sham Kaur all vow to return 'because,' as they pontificate through the writer, 'we are human beings, the heralds of life in the whole universe, and life cannot be killed, molested or plundered; we are life and you-you are destruction, you are animals, brutes.

Ioo). (The harangue reminds one of Ahmad Nadim Qasmi's ranting and delirious hero in the fantastic short story 'I Am a Human Being.') 51 The fallenness of human personality and its moral perversion is picked up again as a theme in the famous short story 'Peshawar Express' (pp. 10 I-I7)--widely acclaimed, not just in the period soon after Partition but also today, as a masterpiece. But overstatement, lack of conviction, didacticism, and intrinsic failure to come to grips with both the nature of evil and its relationship to individuals plague this story as they do most of Krishan Chandr's writing on Partition. His punctilious pattern- ing of contrasting pairs, which has led some critics, among them Shirifi, to take a less critical view of the story,52 appears to the present writer, at least, not just tiringly repetitive but also counterproductive. In what appears to be a novelty-and no more than novelty for its own sake-the story of massacre and carnage in the present case is told by an express train, which embarks upon its ominous odyssey at Peshawar, carrying Hindu immigrants to India from different parts of northwestern Pakistan. A hapless band of Sikhs join them at Hasan Abdal. Forced to make a protracted stop at Taxila, it suffers the further ignominy of being a witness to the first systematic killing and rape of its innocent occupants by Baluchi soldiers. Using delicate suggestion a more careful writer would have success- fully contrasted the present orgiastic killing with the rich associations Taxila has with Buddhist culture and learning, with their emphasis on non-violence. Propelled by reforming zeal, Krishan Chandr rather weakens the contrast intrinsically present in the situation by punctua- ting the Baluchi firing of Hindus and Sikhs with brief sermons of his own: 'Here [i.e., at Taxila] was the biggest university of Asia; the cradle of civilisation and culture that nurtured countless students.' . . 'Kan- ishka once ruled here, bringing people a surfeit of peace, tranquility, wealth and beauty.'... 'It was here in India that Islam first set foot, waving its banner of equality, brotherhood and humanity' (pp. I05-6). The train lumbers on, making stops at Rawalpindi, Jehlum, Gojar Khan, Lala Musa and Wazirabad, witnessing more bloodshed and rape, providing tenuous shelter to more dispossessed persons in its distended bowels. At Wazirabad Junction, its last stop on Pakistani territory, another train coming from the opposite direction (India) and carrying a 51 Cf. Shirifi, Mi yar, p. 212. 52 Ibid., p. 20o6.</page><page sequence="18">394 MUHAMMAD UMAR MEMON combination of dead and half-dead Muslim immigrants grinds to a halt right next to Peshawar Express. Four hundred Muslim men and fifty Muslim women are found short in the other train, so an equal number of Hindu passengers are forced out of Peshawar Express on to the plat- form, where the males are put to the sword. This is done, the writer volunteers, 'to keep the population of India and Pakistan in perfect balance' (p. I io). Already from Mughalpura things begin to change. The Baluchi escort is replaced by Dogra and Sikh soldiers, and it is Muslim blood and corpses that greet its entry into Amritsar Station. On the last leg of the journey, the Peshawar Express witnesses more bloodshed, looting, killing and rape as it makes scheduled and unscheduled stops along its route through eastern Punjab. The details of Muslim killing are, how- ever, as Shirifi has pointed out,53 less graphic. Footworn and emotionally drained, the anthropomorphic Peshawar Express staggers to a halt at Bombay, its final destination, and implores in distinctly Communist jargon that it may no longer be used to haul corpses and hate, but only relief supplies to famine-stricken areas; coal, oil and iron to factories; new ploughs and fertilizer to farmers. Or it may be used to transport bands of prosperous peasants and workers, chaste women, and children whose faces would be as fresh as lotus blossoms and who would bow their heads in greeting, not to death, but to the coming, new life 'when no one will be a Hindu, or Muslim, but only a worker and a human being' (pp. I116-7). Not only are these stories terribly simplistic and formulaic, they also suffer from a lack of genuine creative tension that allows the many elements of a composition to jell into perfect totality ofexperience. Stories about human beings they surely are. But about human beings they tell precious little, indeed. Instead of presenting human personality in its full- ness and complexity, with its paradoxes and contradictions, they tend, rather, to stereotype it. Finally, they fail also in their-and the Progres- sives'- avowed purpose of creating disgust in us for communalism by painting elaborate scenes of manslaughter, etc., owing-and this may be a serious accusation-to what may in the end amount to bad faith and lack of integrity on the part of the writer. Mere depiction of violence is rarely enough in itself to produce feelings of rejection and disgust, let alone in the period immediately after Partition when violence was commonplace and fact stronger than fiction. Quite apart from whether creating disgust is or can be the object of creative endeavour, it may still be possible to do so when evil is syn- 53 Ibid.</page><page sequence="19">PARTITION LITERATURE: STUDY OF INTIZAR HUSAIN 395 thesized to, and not merely accentuated in, the total personality of the individual-a personality which even in its state of utter fallenness carries a capacity for good. Krishan Chandr tries to excite emotions of pity, hate, anger and disgust, but rarely does he attempt either to accept the reality of violence or to explore its effects on the psychology of the perpetrator and the victim. In view of this failure his sententiousness is consequently transformed into what S. H. Vatsyayan (Agyeya) has aptly described as 'sadistic glee.'54 How evil forms and deforms personality, how it affects the oppressor and victim, has been portrayed with remarkable artistic finesse only in 'Lajwanti'55s-R-jindar Sifigh B~di's only contribution to Partition literature-and in numerous stories of Sa'ddat .Hasan Mant6, especially 'Thandd. gjsht,'56 'Khol-dj'57 (Open Up!) and ' TjbJ T.k Sinigh.'58 Here Mant6, as has been rightly pointed out by Leslie A. Flemming, 'genuinely comes to grips with the human pain of partition, exploring with a remarkable combination of anger, sarcasm and tenderness the effects of the violence and dislocation on its victims.'59 Mant6 achieves this by eschewing any direct and external enactment of violence, by eschewing, in other words, the 'sadistic glee,' the rapturous sensuality of Krishan Chandr vis-a-vis violence. Violence in his stories appears, generally, as a faint and distant echo, and where it does sometimes move into the center, its only purpose is to show its impact on individual lives, to understand man's actions in stressful situations, to plumb the depths of the human mind, and to attempt to unravel, if possible, the infinite mystery, the wonder that is man.

The entire responsibility for creating the hatred among Muslims .and Hindus that brought on communal violence, falls squarely upon the British who were interested only in promoting their imperialist and colonial objectives and who, even when leaving India, adhered to their reprehensible policy of 'divide and rule.' 2. Both Hindus and Muslims should have stuck together under all circumstances; Partition was a mistake. 3. All parties involved in, or affected by, the Partition participated equally in the rioting. 4. In spite of the cataclysmic and traumatic experience of the Parti- tion, it would be a great mistake to lose one's faith in the basic goodness of man and his humanity. The erstwhile hatred and enmity between Hindus and Muslims will, of itself, evaporate. The inhabitants of the Subcontinent will soon realize that they are neither Hindus nor Mus- lims nor Sikhs but human beings. A new man will soon emerge, a new order will soon be established in which all men will be equal; hatred will be wiped out and peace will reign supreme. The course of history since Partition has shown the Progressives to be wrong on all these points. Not only is this formula devoid of any histori- cal sense and awareness, but by placing all the responsibility upon the British it also denies the people of the Subcontinent any right to behave as conscious human beings, freely choosing among a number of options and alternatives. And what is most disconcerting, by shifting responsi- bility it condones, it would seem, the very violence it wanted to condemn. Nevertheless there were some writers, among them MantS,61 B~di and Intizir IHusain,62 who were rather too independent and individualistic for the Progressives' ideology. They did not view man as some simple phenomenon whose every response to a given stimulus could be pre- dicted with precision. And as HIusain has put it rather pointedly, but 60 Mi'yir, p. 205. 61 On his life and works, see Leslie A. Flemming, Another Lonely Voice: The Urdu Short Stories of Saadat Hasan Manto (Berkeley: University of California, Research Monograph Series of the Center for South and Southeast Asia Area Studies, I98o). 62 Here I might be inadvertently implying that IHusain was against the Progres- sives and their particular ideology right from the very start of his career as a writer. Such, however, was not the case. He started out admiring the Progressive writing but the break came quite early (see above, note 42); indeed it came precisely because of the peculiar attitude of the Progressives vis-a-vis the creation of Pakistan (cf. reference in ibid.).</page><page sequence="21">PARTITION LITERATURE: STUDY OF INTIZAR HUSAIN 397 aptly, amidst the cataclysm of the Partition, the demand for a new dawn and a new man 'is most vulgar!'63 Of the three above-mentioned writers, I shall, however, restrict myself to Intizdr Husain only. I shall try to show how he perceived the events of 1947 and what his particular view of the Partition was and how he treats Partition in his stories. VIII Of all the Urdu fiction writers of Pakistan, Intizr IHusain is perhaps the most conscious of the flow of Muslim history in the Subcontinent. Almost every single story that he has written reflects in one way or another his abiding preoccupation with this history and the character of Muslim culture within it. But it is not because of their topicality that his stories stand out in Urdu literature, it is rather his remarkable artistic sensibility and historical awareness that makes his stories first and fore- most creations of art. Still, there is more than a measure of ambivalence in I.usain's attitude towards the pre-Partition Indo-Muslim history, the Partition and the creation of Pakistan. 64 This ambivalence, creative ambivalence, which is never resolved, tends to endow the better part of his work with a tragic awareness of life. Eventually, it may be better than the rather naive understanding of the Progressives in regard to India's Partition. In the greater part of his writing I.usain gives a strong impression of his being both an Indian and a Muslim. This, indeed, is a very difficult fate, because a person in whom both these consciousnesses are pointedly articulated is bound to be torn apart by the tensions and contradictions arising from each. As a Muslim he, naturally, looks beyond India, but as a product of Indian culture, he cannot survive outside India. A person- ality that is the battle-ground of these two distinctly conflicting forces cannot be totally satisfied with the 1947 answer-the creation of Pakis- tan. Satisfaction would result only if it were possible to scrape off every single last trace of Indian-ness from one's consciousness. The inevitable failure to do so can only heighten one's sense of loss and make one ask: If nothing is to change, who must pay the price of the incredible human suffering that resulted from a political settlement that failed to take into account the psychological, the emotional, the cultural element? Those who believe in an overnight change of attitudes would perhaps fail to 63 'Interview,' Shab-khfin, Vol. 8, No. 96 (July-September 1975), p. 31. 64 This comes out quite clearly at many points in the interview he gave me.</page><page sequence="22">398 MUHAMMAD UMAR MEMON appreciate truly the nature and scope of the problem. Indeed, there can be no problem from the Progressives' point of view, for it has only the most superficial understanding of personality and ignores altogether the complexity of human motivation and response. More than anything else, due perhaps to the lingering influence of Gandhian idealism, this view preached a gospel of unity at a time when its realization proved to be neither attainable nor feasible. This peculiar dilemma-Indian-ness vs. Muslim-ness-can only arise when the personality has a distinct awareness of itself within a historical context. Perhaps, then, as an alternative, there would be meaning in migrating back to India, as some did, among them the brilliant Muslim woman writer Qurratu 'l-'Ain Haidar. This alternative, however, does not really resolve the problem. A migration in reverse or a second migration back to India only proves the predominance of the Indian element in the consciousness of the migrating individual. For such a person the problem of choice or alternatives does not arise with the same torment- ing intensity with which it does for one who endeavours to synthesize the Muslim and the Indian elements within himself. Intizdr .Husain shows great love for the Indo-Muslim culture in which he grew up; indeed, he feels it to be superior to the puritan Arab Muslim culture65 because of its inherent capacity for assimilation, expansion and open-mindedness, and its greater creative possibilities. At the same time, he cherishes an equally strong fondness for Pakistan. The anguish, however, arises from the painful realization that the course of history has confronted him with a choice between being Indian and being Muslim and thus rent the delicate fabric of simultaneous loyalty to both. In the same interview with which the present inquiry began, he says: We've used the term Indian Muslim culture. What a purely Islamic culture would be, I don't have any idea. It is this Indian Muslim culture of which I am a product and which has shaped the history of which I am a part. The Muslims came to India and formed ties with its soil. Indian Muslim culture is that creative amalgam which came about in response to the intellectual and emotional climate that was there ... the feel of its seasons ... these ties with the land. Much in it is Indian and much was brought from outside. I've already said that Khwaja Nizamuddin Awliya [Khwaja Nizdmu 'd-Din Auliyd'] and Amir [Amir] Khusrau are for me important symbols of this culture. Nizamuddin Awliya said at some point that 'I listen to the "Song 65 Cf.

It was this frame of mind, this attempt to understand the Islamic revelation in terms of our land, this endeavour to merge that revelation with our soil which yielded a unity which later was shaped into what we know as Indian Muslim culture. But we did not permit this unity to continue for long, as its progress has been constantly obstructed or halted by that extremely unfortunate frame of mind which we may call the 'puritan' attitude. I believe that there was this on-going cultural process which was brought to a halt in a very unnatural way. Its progress was blocked by a few Muslims who were victims of this puritan frame of mind and also by some conservative Hindus. On the one hand, there was the Muslim who tried to erase all of his history and live in some period before Muslims had come to India. On the other hand, there was the conservative Hindu who strove to ignore all this interaction and return to some earlier period before it began. So these few reactionary Hindus and reactionary Muslims blocked the way of this culture, ushering in those tragic events which have afflicted us ever since. It seems to me that a fundamental cause of all the troubles and miseries which have befallen this Subcontinent and its people is the fact that a few powerful figures were able to halt the development and emergence of this culture.67 Elsewhere in an article written about fifteen years ago regarding the search for lost cultural modes of perception and living, I.usain says: 'You ask Jildni Kimrdn and he would, without a second's hesitation, head off in the direction of Medina. To me you do not put such a question, but if you did, chances are I would first go and watch the Rdm-lild show, then I might go to Karbald', and may be there make preparations to set out for Mecca.'68 So, for HIusain, the Indian Muslim culture, or the composite culture of the Indo-Gangetic plain, represents the best of two religious tradi- tions-a culture that ignores neither the Mahdbhdrata and Ramdyana nor the tragic events of Karbali'. But in 1947 all this came to a decisive end. The events of 1947 thus represent the culmination and the victory of the divisive tendency that had been working against Hindu-Muslim unity. Although Husain ap- pears to cherish the outcome of the events of 1947, it cannot be doubted that he accepts the creation of Pakistan more as a historical necessity 66 On the day of creation God asked man Alastu bi-Rabbikum? (Am I not your Lord?), and the latter replied Bald (Yes). This episode is recorded in the Qur'dn (see 7:71). Alast is part of the Muslim mystical (siffl) vocabulary and underscores the basic doctrine of Islam, namely, at-Tau4hid (the perfect transcendental Unity of God). 'Song of Alast' would thus mean 'the song acknowledging the Unity of God,' which remains the cherished and ultimate goal of the mystic. 67 Bruce R. Pray's translation (unpublished).

Rather than adhere slavishly to emotion and an unworkable and unrealizable idea, IH.usain accepts the reality of divisiveness and disunity (which is obviously not the case with the best Progressive writers). This is the reason why most of his characters behave not according to a formula,, but, rather, according to their own natures. I.usain never attempts to eliminate the paradoxes and contra- dictions of the individual, and by thus divesting him of his individuality put him in the service of an unrealistic idea. No creative effort can feed for too long on nostalgia or survive in a present haunted by the past. But consciousness of the past is too often mistaken for nostalgia. The failure to differentiate between the two has led some critics to declare .Husain a downright reactionary.69 Most of such criticism has come in recent years from the group of intellectuals whose Marxist tendencies are only too apparent. Sal'dat Sa'id, one of the youngest and most vocal critics of this group, has gone to the extent of calling Husain's writings altogether retrogressive. According to him, IHusain's metaphysics represents nothing more than defeatism, com- promise and opportunism; his creative world alludes to a mode of being and perception that have long since become obsolete; and, finally, the world that he talks about has been wiped out along with its decadent values. 70 69 Others, in a somewhat less extravagant vein, reduce his stories to mere 'elegies on the fading culture of the Muslim nobility of Utter Pradesh.' The reason: 'because he is in search of "things that are lost" ' (G. C. Narang, 'Major Trends in the Urdu Short Story,' Indian Literature, Vol. 16, Nos. 1-2 (1973), p. 132). Needless to say such sweeping criticism accomplishes very little. By telling how Husain's stories read like (i.e., as 'elegies'), but failing to identify the purpose, if any, of those 'elegies,' the critic misses their true significance. Unless one is willing to probe into the motivations of Husain, his purpose and his vision, one is indeed liable to think of his stories as little more than mere 'elegies,' thus conveying the incorrect impression that his entire creative endeavour is devoted only to lamenting the past. This criticism may be met by the testimony to the contrary of the writer himself, for which see notes 71 and 75 below. Here it would be pertinent to mention also the fact that many people share Narang's view. Although superficially true, this view is severely limited by its inability to either recognize and understand or account for IIusain's intimate knowledge of Hindu culture in its broadest sense possible, a knowledge which finds reflection in his writings. Husain insists on Muslim culture, quite true, but one which is sufficiently mediated and mellowed by the incorporation of elements of the native Hindu culture in the Subcontinent, and not the inflexible, puritanical Muslim culture from beyond India. 70 'Mas'ale kil mas'ala,' Funijn, Vol. 12, Nos. 2-3 (December-January x970-71), p. 236.</page><page sequence="25">PARTITION LITERATURE: STUDY OF INTIZAR HUSAIN 40I This and other such criticisms are eloquent examples of misguided energy. It would appear that the same psychology and world view that propelled the PM is being revived here. Intiz.r Husain has never equated consciousness of cultural personality and awareness of the past with nostalgia for the past. To remember is not necessarily to worship the past. He believes that much of the present of the individual is informed, pervaded and influenced by his past. It can help man to understand his collective personality and, through this understanding, his own individual and unique personality. 'By insisting upon the past,' he writes, 'a creative writer does not, or at least should not, intend to revive the past as was.'71 Elsewhere, and in no uncertain terms, he remarks: 'You will abandon me in a desert, I shall build myself a ka'ba there. If we can understand that, we would inevitably also under- stand that tears won't help. Wherever you find lamentation about a paradise that was, regardless this was the paradise of Mira Bal'i,72 Mir73 or Nazir74-wherever you find this lamentation, just remember that this is the voice of the old generation, for creation lies not in lamenting a lost paradise but in building a new one.'7s This insightfulness gives IHusain's work not just its unmistakable humanism but also its inevitable pragmatism. It is at this level that he accepts the creation of Pakistan and it is at this level, again, that he feels that creative ability has been betrayed, compromised and demeaned. IX The career of Intizar Husain as a writer begins from the time of the Partition itself. Like many Muslims, he migrated to Pakistan quite early. He wrote two short stories 'Qajyfuma ki dukdn'76 (Qaiyfima's Shop) and 'Ustdd'77 (The Boss) in 1948 and has since produced close to a 71 'Ijtima'f tahtfb aur afsdna,' Nayd Daur, Nos. 15-18, p. 64. 72 The famous woman saint-singer of North India who composed her devotional poems to Lord Krishna in a mixture of Braj Bhdshi and Mirwdri.

Understandably, therefore, H. usain offers him unqualified praise and considers himself a true follower of Nazir in outlook and mentality (cf. Zulfiqdr Ahmad Tibish, 'Intizdr Ilusain se k intarwiyi,' Kitab, Vol. 7, No. 4 (January 1973), p. 8, especially pp. Io-i i).

They have appeared in numerous Urdu journals of both Pakistan and India.78 Most of these stories directly or indirectly deal with Partition. The characters, the situations, the problems posed or answered-all find their ultimate meaning in the experience of Partition. The stories 'ST.rhiydn'79 (The Stairway) and 'Apni dg k7 taraf'8o (Towards His Fire) deal with the loss of memory and the desire to retrieve it, while others such as 'WJhjJ kh"'7ga'j'81 (The Lost Ones) and 'Shahr-e-afsjs'82 (The Dolorous City), project the fall and annihilation of memory. Between these two specific ideas falls a curious but necessary hiatus. The stories of the hiatus period, namely, 'Akhri ddmV'83 (The Last Man), 'Zard kuttd'84 (The Yellow Cur) and 'Kaya-kalap'85 (Meta- morphosis), deal with the degeneration and moral fall of man, and thus provide the necessary link in the three-act tragic drama of the selJ; which begins with the attempt to retrieve the past through the process of remembrance, failure and moral fall and culminates in the death of the creative self.86 But if there is a single story in which most of the problems arising from the Partition find their most pointed expression, then this is undoubtedly his 'Ek bin-likhF razmaya'87 (An Epic that Never Came to be Written). Written a few years after Partition the story attempts to present in its bewildering multiplicity of forms an experience undergone 78 Most of these are available in his Kankarz (Lahore: Maktaba-e-Jadid, 1955), Akhrf admf (Lahore: Kitdbiydt, 1967), and Shahr-e-afsas (Lahore: Maktaba-e- KdrwSifi [19 ?]). 79 Shahr-e-afscs, pp. 63-83; English translation by Muhammad Umar Memon, 'The Stairway,' in Indian Literature, Vol. 19, No. 6 (November-December, I976), pp. 87-102. 80 Ibid., pp. 190-206; English translation by Muhammad Umar Memon, forth- coming in Journal of South Asian Literature. 8s Ibid., pp. 9-28; English translation by Muhammad Umar Memon, forthcoming in Journal of South Asian Literature. 82 Ibid., pp. 249-70; English translation, 'The City of Sorrows,' by Muhammad Salimur Rahman, in S.

So many dimensions of meaning criss-cross within its limited span and so many aspects of feeling, sensation and apprehension are laid bare within it that the story succeeds in gathering a whole era within its sweep. It presents the clim- ate of hope and unbounded optimism prevailing among the Muslims in the days just prior to the Partition, and their deep emotional attachment to the idea of Pakistan. It is interesting to note that the writer makes no effort to define this idea, for that wouAd have meant sacrificing its complexity for emotional edification. However complex and elusive, the idea of Pakistan was real enough to have influenced a majority of Muslims, even those of the otherwise insignificant settlement of Qadir- pfir, to take up arms against an enemy several times its size and thwart its inhuman designs. The irony implicit in this situation thickens with the realization that those within this settlement who had once so zealously shouted the slogan 'bat kj rahjgd Hindustdn, ban kj rahjgd Pdkistdn' (India will be divided, Pakistan will be created) themselves had no precise idea where this Pakistan was going to be, and even when it was created, they had no desire voluntarily to migrate to it. The protagonist of the story, Pachhw--a wrestler, a neighbourhood bully, who was extremely handy with his club (l/.thF)-exploited the situation to show off his muscle, since everyone else around him had already had a taste of it. Whatever it may have meant to the historian, the intellectual, the 'ulama', indeed even to the founder of Pakistan, the new concept, Pakistan, was intelligible to Pachhwa primarily in terms of the opportunity it afforded for personal perfection. In fighting the Hindu attackers from the neighbouring locality, Pachhwd was not, let us be perfectly clear, motivated by the desire to enhance the cause of the Muslim League, for, as Husain has put it aptly, 'he had never allowed his art to be tainted by purposiveness. 89 Fighting was an end in itself, and 88 As far as I am aware, Shirifi is the first critic to have noticed the merit of this story and drawn attention to it. She discusses it at some length in two of her articles, for which see Mi'y"r, pp. I71-98 and I99-228. My own discussion and analysis of this story draws heavily upon her work. 89 A further telling example: A truly epic personality rises above events and objects; rather than allow itself to be used by them, it, instead, influences and moulds them to underscore what is unique in and about itself. Not only did Pachhwd not allow encroachment of art by purposiveness, he also spurned the idea of modifying his club in any way, even for greater effectiveness. When his companions attached spearheads to their clubs, Pachhwd shunned the innovation/modification altogether, preferring to oil his instead. For adding spearheads changed the character of the club, its club- ness, while oiling it did not (see pp. I98-9).</page><page sequence="28">404 MUHAMMAD UMAR MEMON his use of the art of club-fighting was altogether free ofself-serving. When all hell broke loose in the form of communal riots, PachhwS put all other considerations out of mind, concentrating only on the opportunity he would now have of displaying publicly his skill with the club. In great excitement, he ordered his band with an air of authority, "Get ready, boys, for God has finally heard us. We'll crack open their skulls and they will bloom like spring flowers-a sight to behold and remember God be praised!" ' (p. 204). Thus, 'Pachhwd's gang made preparations for the coming fighting and bloodshed with the same zest and elegance that characterizes the preparations for thecelebration of '7d' (ibid.). Although it is likely that the Muslim League's idea of Pakistan may have lurked in Pachhwd's consciousness,90 it was essentially a totally personal Pakistan he fought for in his native Qadirpfir. For him as well as for most of the denizens of this tiny Indian locality, Pakistan meant Qadirpfir. But when the closest boundary of the blessed land fell hundreds of miles away from Qadirpfir, Pachhwa's frustration was boundless. He first attempted to fly the Pakistani flag atop the p7pal tree beside the Qadirpfir 'd-gdh, but having been talked out of this crazy idea by the inhabitants of the locality, who probably had a better common sense, he alleviated some of his misery and frustration by hoisting the Islamic banner of his party atop the same tree, saying, 'If Pakistan has excommunicated us, so what ?-we shall make our Pakistan ourselves, right here, in this very Qadirpfir' (pp. 205-6). This may be the expression of individual tragedy and frustration, but by implication it represents also the tragedy and frustration of countless others who may have cherished Islam and Pakistan but who were left behind. The sudden sense of defeat, frustration and betrayal experienced by the Indian Muslims as soon as Pakistan was created; their great enthu- siasm, vigour, hopes and expectations, and then their bitterness and pessimism, illusion and disillusion-all the complementary and contra- dictory states experienced by a whole nation during those stormy days of 1947 have been here displayed with remarkable artistry. Pachhwd, the hero of'An Epic that Never Came to be Written,' is a symbol of that experience and its greatest victim, since even in being just an ordinary man he has the potentiality of a hero of an epic. The utter waste and failure of those possibilities, stifled as they were while awaiting the moment of their future becoming, is, by implication, the failure of a whole nation. How does this failure come about ? The story does not end with the 90 But even here, perhaps, considerably tempered by his own vision of it.</page><page sequence="29">PARTITION LITERATURE: STUDY OF INTIZAR HUSAIN 405 subduing of the locality of Qadirpfir by the Hindus, but continues in Pakistan, where many inhabitants of Qadirpfir, including of course Pachhwd and the narrator, have migrated. Much of the story from this point on is in the form of a diary. This diary not only discusses and analyses comprehensively the conditions obtaining at the time the story was written, but also deals with the then existing literary needs and problems. Once on Pakistani soil, Pachhwd begins to change, as does the narrator. The change is for the worse. And yet, before the process of moral deterioration is complete, Pachhwa makes one last bold effort to redeem himself. Against overwhelming odds, he returns to Qadirpfir. Subsequently, the narrator receives a letter from the Sfibaddr S.hib, who is still in Qadirpfir, informing him of the tragic end of Pachhwd. Qadirpfir has changed beyond all recognition. Hindu fanatics have even changed its name to Jdtfinagar. The Jats, who had never forgiven Pachhwd for hoisting the Islamic flag of his party, find fruition of a long-awaited moment in his return. They decapitate Pachhwd and hang his severed head from the same pipal tree atop which once fluttered the Islamic banner of his party (p. 222). The story ends as the writer, who once cherished human and literary values, meets the death of his creative self in the tragic fall of his protagonist. He can no longer write the epic he once wanted to about Pachhwa. The creativity of the writer subjected to a process of smother- ing ever since his arrival in the new country, has now been completely atrophied. But the real reason why he is unable to finish the story of Pachhwd is perhaps this: although Partition had interfered with the natural development of Pachhwd's personality and reduced it so that he could no longer be the subject of a great epic, in heroically meeting his end Pachhwd had nevertheless restored to himself some of the lost elements of his once truly epic personality. To the writer, however, no such redeeming grace is available. The new situation, with its peculiar sets of problems, stresses and strains, has totally changed the mentality of the writer. The wells of inspiration have all dried up. He can no longer write, even if he wanted to. The death of the creative self is tragic enough; what intensifies this sense is the newly-acquired conviction of the writer that literature itself can have no meaning, that it is a totally negative and useless occupation. Now, in the promised land, his concerns and preoccupations are no longer the same; he no longer writes, but is happy tending his material interests, which, for the moment, lie in the smooth operation of a flour mill, the abandoned property ofa Hindu, which has been recently</page><page sequence="30">406 MUHAMMAD UMAR MEMON allotted to him, thanks to the influence of Na'im Miydfi-a compatriot from Qadirpfir (pp. 223-4). The 'swan song' of the creative self is briefly interrupted by a series of attempts to arrest or, at the very least, somewhat postpone the im- pending tragedy. One such attempt is the short story 'S.rhkiydi' (The Stairway). The experience of Partition, which affected the Muslim immigrants in a number of adverse ways, has had a particularly damaging effect on Saiyid, the central character of the story 'The Stairway.' Not only has it left him exhausted, it has also robbed him of his memory. Instead of coming to inner peace at the journey's end, Saiyid suffers from excessive insomnia and a feeling of emptiness. Far from solving the problem of Muslim identity in South Asia which it was expected to, the Partition has, in a way, created a crisis of identity for Saiyid. In Pakistan he is, thus, a man without memory and, therefore, without past. The only recourse now available to the benumbed mind of Saiyid is to retrieve memory subconsciously through dreams. This, however, remains an impossibility since the ability to dream or to sleep has departed him subsequent to his arrival in the new country. Saiyid's dilemma is finally resolved not so much by any act of will or determination on his part as by the salutary effect a conversation between Akhtar, Bashir Bhd'i and Razi has on his tired senses one particular sultry summer night when all four lie in their beds atop some roof in the mysterious half-light of a lantern. Razi has just finished relating a dream which he had recently had and Bashir Bhd'i is inter- preting it. Razi's dream, loaded with memories of his past in a small city somewhere in eastern U.P. and Bashir Bhd'i's skilful and engaging interpretation of it have captured the attention of all, except Saiyid, who appears to be totally uninterested in the activity. He makes repeated efforts to fall asleep and fails repeatedly. The instant, however, that Razi mentions seeing the imdm-bd.rd in his dream, something happens to Saiyid. The very mention of the word, full of symbolic meaning and associations, triggers off a series of past images that inex- orably superimpose themselves upon his consciousness in a veritable cinematic montage. He suddenly throws his eyes fully open and feels 'a tiny aperture forming in the darkness of his mind' through which he drifts into the bygone world of his childhood and youth and relives every moment of it. Thus, thanks to the conversation of his companions, the past has again become accessible to Saiyid; the act of remembrance has restored</page><page sequence="31">PARTITION LITERATURE: STUDY OF INTIZAR HUSAIN 407 the power to dream. Toward the end of the story, after Saiyid has been successful in retrieving his past, he feels very light and strangely at ease. Perhaps, he is again a whole man. He opens his sleep-laden eyes and looking toward Razi says in a mysterious voice, 'My heart is beating rather fast. It seems I am going to see a dream, after all' (p. 83). In Saiyid's case, although he has lost touch with his reality, there is awareness, however faint, of the self and the desire to recollect. This desire becomes transformed into active resistance, however, in the case of the nameless, but central, character of the story 'Apn adg ki taraf' (Towards His Fire). Two childhood friends, who as adults have lived an intensely intimate life together in a room inside a tall building, come to be separated by the vicissitudes of time, though they continue to live in the same city. They meet again, accidentally, when the building in which i-we shall call the central, nameless character by this letter-has continued to live catches fire and his friend-whom we shall call B-happens to come by that way. B recognizes Z and tries to persuade him to move over to his house since the gutted building is no longer safe. Z, however, won't. Explaining his hesitation he says, rather quizzically, 'Shaikh 'Ali Hujwiri once saw a mountain that was enveloped in fire, in which fire he spotted a tormented little mouse running frantically around. Some- how in its mad running the mouse managed to get away from the volcano. But, just as soon as it got away from the fire, it dropped dead.' He fell silent. After some time he added in a very low voice, 'You see, I don't want to die' (p. 204). The parable of the mouse and the volcano is brimming with mystical symbolism. Z is aware that outside the building he cannot be the man he is. The building, on the other hand, is a whole cosmos in itself- self-sufficient and self-sustaining-and stands, possibly, for many things: a tradition, a society, a whole world, or indeed the Muslim culture of pre-Partition days, with the fire being an allusion to the communal rioting that disrupted and destroyed that culture. So, even if there is death inside, Z must, like Pachhwdi in 'An Epic That Never Came to be Written,'91 return to his own element, to his own fire, because there is a greater and more painful death awaiting him outside. The active resistance of Z to succumb to an alien death comes to be entirely lost in more recent stories of I.Iusain. 'Shahr-e-afsis' (The Dolo- rous City) and, more importantly, 'W&amp;h/ jo kh5'j ga'W' (The Lost Ones) provide outstanding examples of the fall of personality. In the latter 91 Or like Arshad and Na'im in the story 'Andhi galf ' (Shahr-e-afsis, pp. 227-48).</page><page sequence="32">408 MUHAMMAD UMAR MEMON story, written shortly after the break up of Pakistan in 1971, the personality reaches its inevitable death and all memory of the past is irrevocably eroded and, with it, all self-awareness. Four people, symbolically divested of names to enhance the sense of loss of personal ego, are identified only by their physical characteristics and by the signs they wear-e.g., 'the man with the bag,' 'the bearded man,' 'the youth' and 'the man with the wounded head'-which is a way to dramatize the unreality about their beings. They are insub- stantial, intangible shadows with no identity. All we know about them is that they have somehow managed to escape a great and painful persecution. Their homes have been sacked, so on and so forth. But where are they coming from? or where are they headed ?-there is no precise answer, and if there is one, it is curiously bereft of any sense of present actuality and is to be found in the repeated expulsion of Muslim peoples over the centuries: from Granada and Cordoba in Spain, from Bait al-Maqdis in present Israel, from Kashmir and Jahdn- Abtd (i.e., Delhi) in India. As the man with the wounded head himself says: 'I have been uprooted. And that's what matters. What difference does it make for me now to remember whether it's Granada that I've been thrown out from, or Bait al-Maqdis, or Jahanabdd, or Kashmir' (p. I5). The loss of memory and the consequent death of personality is masterfully brought out by the episode in which somehow these four men begin to suspect that one of them is missing. They count and recount, and each one of them misses himself while counting. All they can remember is that one of them is missing. But which one? They cannot remember the face or even the name of the missing one, or whether, indeed, the missing person is a man or a woman. What this amounts to is that none of them has any precise idea or awareness of himself. Later on, it suddenly occurs to the man with the wounded head that perhaps he had failed to include himself while taking the count. He mentions this suspicion to the others. Each, in turn, realizes his mistake. Each thinks that he is, in fact, the missing man. The missing man thus attains to the real man, while the real flesh and blood men, because of loss of consciousness, fade away into murky oblivion, into the colourless realm of non-being. And it is only the testimony of the others to this or that man's being that endows him with whatever reality there may be to his existence. The tragi-comical paradox embedded in the situation is brought into sharper relief when the man with the wounded head realizes that his</page><page sequence="33">PARTITION LITERATURE: STUDY OF INTIZAR HUSAIN 409 being depends not so much on his own thinking and awareness of him- self as on the goodwill of others who are willing to testify to that effect. He shudders at his own lack of Cartesian faith, which can point only to a tragic fate. Addressing the old man, who has chided him for his ingrati- tude to the willingness of the other three to testify to his existence, he says: 'And suppose you suddenly decided to withhold your testimony- I would right away cease to be, wouldn't I?' (p. 23). But where Saiyid, Z and Pachhwd are successful,--however brittle this success may be-the four men in the present story are truly lost and done for. Little more than intangible shadows of their former selves, they are kept alive by the testimony of others. What tenuous existence, indeed! Thus through a circuitous route, interspersed with spurts of life and brief moments of will, resistance and fluctuating optimism, the main idea of'An Epic That Never Came to be Written' is resumed and brought to a logical conclusion in 'The Lost Ones,' with the numerous stories in between merely highlighting man's odyssey through moral degenera- tion, amnesia, attempts at regaining, through reclamation of memory, a sense of corporate and individual identity to eventual extinction of the creative self. Conclusion At the time of the Partition of India in 1947, much of the Urdu creative writing was under the influence of the Progressive Movement and the peculiar ideology fostered by it, compelled, no doubt, by human considerations. Those in the Movement viewed the Partition as totally negative and failed to appreciate it within a historical context. Devoid of any deeper historical understanding, this writing focused narrowly on an offshoot of the Partition, namely, the communal riots, leaving the forces that necessitated it virtually untouched. The literature produced on the theme of communal riots appears to be generally tentative and superficial. But there were some writers, both in Pakistan and India, who could not write off the Partition with ease. One such writer is Intiz~r Husain. He shows a keen awareness of the history of India since the arrival of the Muslims in the Subcontinent. He feels that the creativity of the incoming Muslims, working in close collaboration with the creativity of the native Hindus, produced a composite culture. But, from the very beginning, puritanical elements within the Muslim and Hindu populations worked against this synthetic culture. The situation</page><page sequence="34">410 MUHAMMAD UMAR MEMON progressively deteriorated. A time came when, lamentably, the idea of unity had to be abandoned. The Partition was, thus, a historical necessity. Any writing that fails to view Partition within a historico- cultural context fails to do justice to it. Although historically necessary, the incident was nevertheless tragic. Much of his writing attempts to portray this sense of tragedy. But IHusain is also a pragmatist. Tragedy, unless it is sublimated through a creative process, is pure waste. The Partition of India must, therefore, be seen as a creative force also. The experience of migration, a recurrent phenomenon in the history of Muslim peoples, was again made available to the Muslims as a result of the Partition. This experience had creative possibilities which ought to have been exploited. Unfortunately, they were not.</page></plain_text>
