Blau, for example, ascribed the authorship to Eleazar ben Eliezer, a relatively unknown contemporary of Saadiah. This essay analyzes one manuscript of the piyyut (representing the ver- sion prevalent among the North African communities who still read it on the holiday of Shavucot) and concludes that Blau is correct in his claim: Saadiah is not its author. The language (including grammatical errors and inconsis- tencies), the style, and the content are all uncharacteristic of Saadiah Gaon. The association of the name of Saadiah with the piyyut may be due to the desire to attribute authorship to a well-known and famous personality. The essay is followed by a reproduction and translation of the piyyut. It was the custom among Middle Eastern communities to read the piyyut on the Ten Commandments, written in Judaeo-Arabic and gen- erally ascribed to Saadiah Gaon, on Shavucot, the holiday celebrating the giving of the Torah. This custom has, to a greater or lesser extent, continued: the piyyut is still read, in the original Judaeo-Arabic, by the Jewish communities originating from Libya, Jerba, Damascus, and Aleppo,' although it is not always understood due to both its irregular linguistic forms and the various corruptions of the text. 1 See tzmn vipi) (Religious Teachers' Library, published by The Ministry of Education [Jerusalem, 1980]): "In the afternoon people gather in the synagogue or in several private homes to read the Book of Proverbs, the Book of Ruth, and our revered poet Yishaq ben Re'uven's 'Azharot on the 613 miswot. This study circle concludes with a reading of the Ten Commandments as translated by Rav Saadiah Gaon. In some places Arab notables would also come to hear the reading of the Ten Commandments, and would listen attentively and reverently" (237; reported by Phrija Zuerets, a leader of the Jewish community in Libya). "In some synagogues the Ten Commandments are read in a greatly expanded translation which includes comments of several of our sages of blessed memory. This translation is read in a special chant by persons with melodious voices" (Shalom Hadad, "The Custom of the Jews of Jerba," 325). R. Ezra Basri, of the Ha-Ketav Institute (who now resides in Jerusalem and is</page><page sequence="2">324 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW In this paper I shall examine the major stylistic features of the piyyut in the version prevalent among the North African communi- ties. Some of these features, reflected in the content, language, text, and literary style of the piyyut, cast doubt on Saadiah's authorship. I have based this study on a single manuscript2 containing the North African version of the piyyut.3 It is not my intention in this study to produce a critical edition of the manuscript (which would include, among other things, the alternative versions of the piyyut) but, as stated above, to examine the question of authorship. The piyyut consists mainly of aphorisms, homilies, legends, and translations, in Judaeo-Arabic, relating to the Ten Commandments. It also contains some commentary in the form of a paraphrase of the Ten Commandments. The homilies list the commandments and then regarded as one of the leaders of the Aleppo immigrant community), recalls that R. Shaybar told him that it was the custom in Aleppo to read this piyyut in the syna- gogue, in Arabic, on the holiday of Shavu'ot. R. Avraham 'Ades, head of the Kol Ya'aqov Yeshiva in Bene Beraq and the author of Derekh 'Eres, informed me that the Jews of Aleppo used to read the piyyut at a large gathering on the evening of the 15th of Shevat, and some read it on Shavu'ot. But this custom has been discontinued in recent times because the younger members of the congregation do not know enough Arabic to understand the reading. The piyyut is still read, however, in Arabic in the synagogue of the Aleppo congregation in Tel Aviv. According to my father, Yehuda Dana, it used to be read in Damascus. But in my home town of Haifa it is not read since the congregation no longer understands the language. 2JTSA 1276, entitled n"n li" uN) n'rvwo i1 2nfl) rnrrn nwy my) (=microfilm 4645 at the Hebrew University, Jerusalem).

According to Steinschneider such poems are of ancient origin.4 An introduction portrays the scene at Mount Sinai at the giving of the Torah: Nature holds its breath in wonder and awe on this mo- mentous occasion. The author describes the power of God by whose word the world was created. He then declares God's eternity and ends by asserting the special relationship between God and Israel. He fi- nally takes up each of the Ten Commandments and comments poet- ically on each in turn. As already stated, Jewish communities have traditionally attributed the piyyut to Saadiah. Scholars, however, have been divided on the question of authorship. While some have indeed accepted the attri- bution to Saadiah,5 Blau has identified Eleazar ben Eliezer as the author.6 I shall attempt to support Blau's view and to show why the poem could not have been written by Saadiah. I The piyyut describes the scene at Mt. Sinai and explains the psy- chological background that led to the giving of the Torah. In the course of this description the author does not hesitate to present God in anthropomorphic terms, which makes it unlikely that the poem was written by Saadiah, whose concept of God was purely spiritual. God is twice described in the fourth commandment as sitting on his throne (nvv), an image borrowed from the Qur'an: "He sat on his throne, I sat on my throne." Elsewhere in the piyyut, in the third commandment, God is portrayed as sitting on his throne and taking Idris-that is, Enoch-from among the dwellers on earth in order to seat him on his throne mwnv x5y ivn,, "I raised him to sit on my throne." In the eighth commandment we find that God's active inter- ference in the affairs of his creatures is phrased as "I shall call you from my throne." 4 Die arabische Literatur der Juden (Frankfurt, 1902) 185. 5 Y.

I cite from the Hebrew edition.</page><page sequence="4">326 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Saadiah characteristically took great pains to avoid anthropomor- phizing the deity. When quoting the Bible he alters or omits from the text any anthropomorphic properties attributed to God. Blau cites the following examples: "you sat on your throne" (Ps 9:5), which Saadiah translates pvi:) vv'is, "you placed your throne," in order to avoid the image of God physically sitting on a throne. Similarly, "and I saw God seated on a throne" (Isa 11:1) is translated "I saw the light of God sitting on a throne." In this way the action of sitting is transferred from God to his light. In the piyyut God speaks in the first person, converses, persuades, asks questions, gives advice, relates his deeds of valor, warns, and explains. Thus, for example, he says: "I am the King of kings, none can oppose me. I give life and take away life. I bring down the great house." The poet continues in this vein, with God speaking in the first person, for an entire page. This self-praise, together with the use of the first person, tends to anthropomorphize God, which is pre- cisely what Saadiah took pains to avoid. Although the author does occasionally avoid anthropomorphizing the deity (1pax nmxnxnox rnt 'im "my light dwells in the heavens," 2a), such instances are few and far between. The prevailing style is anthropomorphic, which makes it unlikely that the poem is the work of Saadiah. As I shall show below, the anthropomorphic representa- tion of the deity has remained unchanged in all the various revisions of the ancient text. II The homilies in the piyyut are highly emotional in character and em- ploy a popular-literary style, features that are quite foreign to Saadiah. Here is an example from the first commandment: "I am the God who has made the earth verdant ... and I have given those who believe in me all manner of fruit and the date palm." Or, from the third com- mandment: "A vain oath destroys houses, brings death to the off- spring, withers flowers, suspends rain and rainshowers, transforms a settlement into a desert." As against this emotive, popular-literary style, all of Saadiah's writings are characteristically unemotional and rationalistic.7 7I.

The piyyut would have been the most appropriate place to mention such a connection, but it is not there. IV Parts of the piyyut are written in rhymed verse-a style remin- iscent of the saj' or the Hebrew maqamah of the Middle Ages.

We sometimes find caesurae within the text functioning as a basic element of a section. These are marked by recurring rhymes which, from a literary point of view, are unoriginal and banal. They also contain linguistic deviations, which are further indications that they are not the work of Saadiah.

The letters jim and ghain are spelled A and i respectively; this spelling has been retained in preference to the spelling generally used for Judeo-Arabic texts today.</page><page sequence="6">328 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW The following example affords, I believe, decisive proof that this poem was, from the outset, the work of a writer unfamiliar with the rules governing grammatical case (3b): xix /(!)N Ni)x N5' 5X1:12&lt;N lnf Nn n)5i /)i)-if nfl'nONT 'P' fpfli I 'imP' )2iv5N Nvwl /)Ivi nV 2'N ) 1'xIt' lmn) =T N 5N N)22 vpt .)IrnX IN'tnX&lt; 29) This passage contains nine caesurae, each ending with the identical rhyming syllable "i," and it is clear that this is the original rhyme of the author since it occurs so frequently. Of these nine times only the last two are linguistically acceptable. Nevertheless, the seven pre- ceding ungrammatical rhymes, since they form part of the set, must also have been those of the author himself and not the work of some other hand. 10 Below is another passage, similarly full of grammatical deviations in its various caesurae. Once again these lines form an essential part of the piyyut and cannot be dispensed with or altered, since they form part of a series based on a single rhyme. But the mistakes clearly indicate that they cannot be the work of Saadiah (7b): 523 f/N)vlv 5295 -01pts /N))"O,x2 N9n'VON1 VX:15:12 mmz) Ito nn2&lt; V The piyyut is written in a popular style. It appeals to the reader by means of anecdotes and its lively and engaging literary style. The au- thor addresses the reader personally, makes much use of parallelism and repetition, detailed description, and frequent reference to numbers. He also admonishes the sinner and calls upon him to mend his ways. All these features give the piyyut a popular character which, again, argues against Saadiah's authorship. Note the following examples: 1. Author addresses the reader personally. "Children of Israel, I am the God who brought you out of Egypt" (in the first command- ment). "I am the God who created the sea and it solidified; and I 10 In contrast there are spelling mistakes and superfluous repetitions, which no doubt are not those of the author but the copyists.

"Strengthen your mind, my son, and guard yourself against the desires of the flesh that will bring you harm. Hearken to your God and to your conscience, and be con- tented with your bedmate, for then God will bless your home" (sev- enth commandment). 2. Numbers. The 7 levels of heaven and 70 languages (in the introduction); 2 tablets (first commandment); 10 miracles, 7 firma- ments, 7 days, the seventh sea, 7 planets, the seventh wheel, 6 days, 7 years, 7 times, 49 years, the fiftieth year, 7 times 7 days, 49 days, the fiftieth day, the seventh patriarch, 7 of David's descendants, Yinon (the seventh), the seventh day (fourth commandment); the 3 ancestors of man, 10 elements from the father, 10 elements from the mother, 10 elements from God, 20 limbs in the body (fifth commandment); 10 things, each more powerful than the other (seventh commandment). 3. Parallels and repetition. Vain oaths destroy houses, slay off- spring, wither flowers, suspend rain and rain showers, bring sickness and decay to the body, convert a settlement into wilderness (third commandment). "That is my name, as I was called by Enoch..... Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Joseph, Moses, Joshua, Jonah" (third com- mandment). "Keep the Sabbath, give it honor, exalt it, lavish affec- tion on it, treat it with awe, elate it, adorn it, fear it, purify it, crown it, dress it in royal robes, let it rule you .... prefer it, confirm it, sanctify it, restore and renew it, distinguish it (from all other days), strengthen it" (fourth commandment). The parallelisms and repeti- tions recall the "accumulative" device of the piyyutim of Eretz Is- rael, which justifies classifying the present work as a piyyut. 4. Lists in alphabetical order. The Sabbath is described in twelve different ways, some in Hebrew and some in Arabic, listed in order of the Hebrew alphabet: orn 5)5rn orn 5)5) orn ,nn:i orn jnmx o r ... p)rIn or ) rn ,lNmrn )on , (seventh commandment).

Admonition. The author makes much use of admonition, mainly in the form of personal address: "Look out, simpleton, lest you have designs on her" (seventh commandment); "Take heed and guard yourself, my son. Then you may, perhaps, join the righteous and the good" (sixth commandment). 6. Concrete language. In addressing his unsophisticated reader, the author uses concrete language, which is intelligible to the com- mon man and therefore effective and persuasive. Here are two ex- amples. In the seventh commandment the author tries to persuade his readers to keep away from an "evil woman." He does so by describ- ing her evil and pernicious aspects-her wicked deeds, evil schemes, and the harmful consequences of her depraved nature. In the eighth commandment the author wishes to warn the reader against steal- ing by relating the story of Achan son of Zerah and describing, in concrete terms, what is likely to happen to one who steals. VI The language of the piyyut (in this version) is drawn from the lower registers of Judaeo-Arabic with a marked North African influ- ence. 11 For example: 1. A prominent linguistic feature of the manuscript is the super- fluous and incorrect use of case markers, a usage that is not even consistently incorrect, that is, it is incorrect in various ways. 12 Fol- lowing are a few examples taken mainly from three pages of the manuscript. (a) An as a case marker for the accusative: 13 lwinv.

Examples such as these occur up to the end of the second commandment. The reason for the author's incorrect use of the suffix an may be that he read, spoke, and wrote in Judaeo-Arabic, but did not read Arabic books, for he spells the case markers phonetically (sometimes as a separate word and some- 11 My reference for the grammatical aspects of the text is J.

This is evidence that the author was unfamiliar with the written lan- guage and is further proof that Saadiah could not have been the author of the piyyut. In his own writings Saadiah generally omitted the accusative suffix an.1 We may, I believe, reasonably assume that this feature appeared in the original text and is not a later insertion, since it seems un- likely that anyone would "correct" more than one hundred instances of the accusative noun by adding an. It is much more likely that a person revising the text would correct the mistake and delete the an. We may conclude, therefore, that the original text was written in a low, popular style, with grammatical mistakes, and that its author was ignorant of the proper use of an. His mistake originated, it would seem, from a desire to employ a scholarly style with which he was unacquainted. (b) 2 also serves as a case marker: mt'v' p)vnt (lb), wNi)x2T v)5r )mt'I (2a).

(e) p) as a case marker: )-mzxv In (!) Ivrw 52 rii:rrx (6b). Since ten, and not twenty, things were created on the first day (bHag 12a), we may therefore assume that p) was intended as a case marker and not as a plural suffix of a masculine noun. It is more likely that the author used the case wrongly (a charac- teristic already shown) than that he did not know the number of miracles that were performed. This is yet another example of the low, popular register that characterizes the language of the piyyut, for the authors uses the indefinite case marker (p) together with the definite article, which is ungrammatical.

Rhyme was apparently more important to the author than grammatical correctness, from which we draw the conclusion that the author had no knowledge of the case forms of the language. This cannot be said of Saadiah. It seems reasonable to attribute this error to the author himself, since without it there is no rhyme scheme for the passage. Another reason for the author's failure to use the accusative form-a failure that persists throughout the work-is that he presumably believed the final syllable 1p in the word pp) to be the accusative suffix and accordingly did not add I2 as in the other caesurae in this passage. 2. There are a large number of grammatical mistakes in the text, which indicates a low vulgar style of Judaeo-Arabic. These mistakes are phonological and syntactic. Following are a few examples: (a) M is sometimes represented by M and sometimes by v:15 M114 (lb), innx3ir (6a), )-irm2 (3b),vnDo2mm (7a), (!) I)vn 92&lt; nmis2 (2b). (b) The same mistakes occur with v:16 rinrn (4a), o1pnvmi 1ni?v (4b). (c) M is sometimes represented by -t:17 x5ror (2a), -rnn 5x (6a), n-rv (7a), 29wm: 929 2miu2 (8a), vwrrx2 (8a), 2&lt;wn2 92&lt; -po (12a).

Blau points out that this phenomenon is very rare and is the mark of a low style. But it occurs quite commonly in the manuscript, as I have pointed out, and is yet another instance of the characteristically vulgar style of the text.

He conjugates "115 verbs as strong verbs:23 wrrl) IN (2a); innvn x5 (10a, 14a); 1)fnl Y')oN (1 lb); irin (14a). As Blau points out, this is a feature of North African Judaeo-Arabic.

The use of the subjunctive is also incorrect: xorn5 rmont' in-v I (2a); wrmn I2 (2a). 6. There is no consistency in the transcription of identical mate- rial; see for example 5)' mv (8b). 7. In some cases the mistake appears to be that of the copyist and not of the author, as in xn5vo -o2jwnV (5b), instead of rinM'v, which is required both by the context and in order to rhyme with the preceding and following phrases. The author's linguistic deviations appear throughout the piyyut. Such deviations can by no means be ascribed to Saadiah. 8.

We find an used in place of a syndectic pronoun: m)l n1o IIt) I nnrv XI-m (6b).

Blau described the language of the piyyut as representative of later postclassical Judaeo-Arabic, typical of the North African dialect of the masses from the sixteenth century onwards. This dialect-its writ- ten language, grammar, and vocabulary-differs considerably from the classical Judaeo-Arabic, of which Saadiah is one of the most distinguished exponents. Listed below are the main North African features of this particu- lar manuscript. (a) l instead of v, and vice versa:28 V)zOtx (lb, 3a).

(d) Use of the morpheme mfl in the 3rd per. fem. form of the past tense: nm2vyi (6a).3? (e) The definite article, or the 5 of the definite article, is some- times omitted before a noun beginning with a "sun" letter: 0,V)2 (lb); 2x-mnu2 x&lt;n)nxx (lb); t)5)5-nn -2w5).m^2 92 (3b). Blau refers to Epstein who compares this with a similar feature in the modern Jewish North African dialect.31 (f ) Use of the naf 'al to indicate 1st per. future: v) ... 5r'x m ... x .-rn n 5rrm xv) In (3a). Blau describes this use of the naf'al as a North African feature.32 (g) Shortening of )fl to ,, probably under the influence of 3: jxmn5' ,v-)o ox[5]-n -Dnnn (2b). This phenomenon, too, is consid- ered by Blau to be a feature of the North African dialect. 33 (h) The use of vw: pxono vxi (13b).34 (i) The fifth form with prosthetic aleph is used in place of the eighth form:35 xnx- itxnxi (lOb). (j) Another North African feature in the manuscript (which is not to be found in other manuscripts) is the representation of the vowel "u" by double i. For example: I-vir (lb), )-in (2a), (13b )N pI assu that (12a), t 1heVrg (12a), ma rpt (12b)w hic (13b). I assume that in the Vorlage to the manuscript which 29 Blau, 91, sec. 110, refers to this morpheme which is used also with other persons.

Saadiah's command of Arabic was impeccable, as noted one hun- dred years ago by Joseph Derenbourg,36 and it is difficult to be- lieve that he could have been the author of the piyyut on the Ten Commandments. To sum up, there are differences of opinion about the authorship of the piyyut. I do not believe, however, that Saadiah could have been the author for the following reasons: (a) the many instances of anthropomorphisms of the deity, which Saadiah avoided completely; (b) the emotional popular-literary style; (c) the absence of any men- tion of a connection between the Ten Commandments and the 613 miswot, a connection that Saadiah was always careful to indicate; (d) the many basic grammatical mistakes in a relatively short text. I therefore share the view of those scholars-principally Blau, in his article referred to above, "The Piyyut on the Ten Commandments, by Eleazar ben Eliezer, wrongly ascribed to Saadiah Gaon," that Saadiah is not the author of this piyyut. Blau asks why this piyyut, which is so uncharacteristic of Saadiah, nevertheless was ascribed to him. The main reason was probably the desire to link the piyyut with a famous name (the Karaites, for ex- ample, attribute it to al-Qirqisani), and Eleazar ben Eliezer was, it seems, a relatively unknown author. Even if the author's use of the anti-anthropomorphic "the light of God residing in heaven," is characteristic of Saadiah's style, the piyyut as a whole is still foreign to the spirit and religious beliefs of Saadiah. Moreover, even if we accept the thesis that the piyyut was originally authored by Saadiah, so many fundamental changes must have been made in the original text that it can no longer be ascribed to him. The current text is obviously the work of many hands. This is evidenced by the linguistic solecisms of all kinds, and by the lack of consistency and precision in its transliteration and syntax.

Clouds and lightning ran wild, the angels were confused, the heavens shook, and the earth trembled. The mountains moved, the waves of the sea shriveled, and the rivers were troubled. The sun, the moon and the stars stood still. Castles collapsed, the beasts of prey and the beasts of the field panicked. And the commandments burst forth from seven sealed levels of heaven in a voice that spoke in seventy languages, as if wafting along the Garden of Eden, and more fragrant than any scent, such as musk, amber, camphor, sweet cane, and "drira," pure and sweetly scented, when the light rises and brightens (the air). When the commandments of the all-powerful God were heard, His Oneness was recognized, as it is written in the pure and true Torah. Our first words, as we open our lips and utter with our tongues, 2a must be to / exalt and praise our God who created the world, saying "Be!," and it came into being, as the prophet Isaiah (may he lie in peace) has said: "I am the first and the last, and beside Me there is no other God" (Isa 44:6). And behold, My light fills the heavens, and My power lies under the seas and over the seas. I am the God that chose the children of Israel from all the nations and called them "My sons," and bore them as on the wings of eagles, and brought them to Mount Sinai, and gave them My commandments, and has preferred them over all the nations of the world. Therefore we must give thanks to our God who brought us out of Egypt, and delivered us from the house of bondage, and drowned our enemies in the sea, and brought us to Mount Sinai, and fed us with manna and with quails, and chose us out of all the nations of the world and favored us with His Torah and His commandments. The Lord, God of our fathers, will multiply us a thousand times 2b and will bless / us as He promised, saying "The Lord, God of your fathers, will make you a thousand times more than you are, and bless you, as He has promised you" (Deut 1:11). The first commandment came from the Lord of the universe in truth, distinctly spoken, in a loud voice and in clear words; with commandments, and a covenant, and a promise that will hold for</page><page sequence="43">THE PIYYUT ON THE TEN COMMANDMENTS-DANA 365 our children and our children's children, drifting in the heights of heaven. And by the side of Mount Sinai it wanders, sent by the merciful and compassionate God, engraved with a nib of light upon two tablets, in wonderful words, and in a voice that could not be silenced, and in a loud tone, and with thunder, a heavy frost and rain, and lofty words that went forth, saying: "Children of Israel, I am the God who brought you out of Egypt, out of the house of bond- age. I am the God who divided the sea and it froze, and I drowned Pharaoh and his men in it, and it subsided. I am the one and only God, I created the heavens, I am alone, in my light and in my wis- 3a dom, with a minister, / with none to help me or to reverse what I have done. I am the King of kings, and none can oppose Me. I re- store to life and I take away life. I humble the house of the great and make it lowly. I raise up whomsoever I wish and bring down whom I wish. It is I who provide for all creatures, and each day they are provided anew with provisions for the day. The sources of cold, frost, snow, ice, thunder, and lightning, and the stormy winds, are all mine. I created the heavens without a foundation and I formed the earth as if it were supported by stakes and cables, and I said to the void 'Be!' and it came into being. And there is none to disobey Me and survive. I humiliate the wise and make their words trivial. I make that which is near remote, and that which is remote I make near. I draw water out of hard stone and out of solid rock. I cause seeds to sprout and grain to grow from the earth. And if I look upon the earth it trembles with a great tremor. And if I cover the sun it will lose its light and become dark. And if I turn away the clouds, I do so because of the sins of living creatures. And if I send the clouds 3b it is with honor / and praise. And each drop I cause to fall from them becomes a torrent. And I have a guard to watch over My people un- til I take them where I shall choose to take them. And I have clearly designated my precious stones. And they have nothing to love and nothing to desire. And wherever I send them, from there they shall return. And to Me is due the kingship, praise, petition, prayer, and renown. I am the one and only, the brave and mighty, who knows all the secret things and reveals that which is hidden. There is none to equal Me, and glory is My due to all eternity. I know what is in men's hearts. I am the God who has colored the earth green-with grass, plants, and flowers-and have given My believers fruit and crops of all kinds. I have set a border of sand on the sea to keep it from flooding (the land). I alternate times and seasons, so that the</page><page sequence="44">366 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW seasons follow each other in rotation. I cause the rich to become poor, and the poor to acquire great wealth. I am the exalted God, the source of light. There is no light like My light, and none to equal 4a Me. Praise and glory become Me, as it / is written in the Torah: 'Hear, 0 Israel, the Lord our God is one God,' meaning: Hear, 0 Israel, there is no God beside our God, our Lord, the one and only God; He has no equal; may He be praised." The second commandment came, as recorded, drifting in the heights of heaven, and it hovered and spoke: "'Children of Israel, you shall have no other gods but Me' (Exod 20:3). Nor shall you worship any one beside Me, nor exchange Me for another, nor speak of Me in a fable, nor take My measure, nor call Me by some other name. But you shall praise Me with praises and greatly exalt My name. I am all-powerful and supreme. None can perform My won- drous deeds or explain My appointed feats. I deal kindly with each generation. I am the merciful and munificent God. Beware lest you turn away from Me to worship idols. And do not make graven im- ages of Me, neither of the sun nor the moon, nor of anything that I 4b have created under the heavens, nor of the stars / of heaven, their hosts and their galaxies, which, like yourselves, were created. Do not bow down to them blindly and in ignorance. I am the God, and mine is the strength, the courage, the firm decision, and the power to with- stand. Do not worship any god other than Myself, neither gods of gold, nor of silver or wood or stone. These are the handiwork of ig- norant men. They have mouths but cannot speak, they have eyes but cannot see, they have ears but cannot hear. They have noses but can- not smell, they have hands but cannot move them firmly; they have feet but cannot walk. Like unto them are those who had made them, and all who trust in them (cf. Ps 115:5-8). "Children of Israel, children of My covenant, My pure ones, I am the God, the Creator, the Maker. I created galaxies in the firmament and the planets. Do not look up to them and do not on any account worship them, for I am a jealous God who remembers the sins of the wicked for generations; but I am merciful and forgiving to the vir- tuous children of My covenant, as well as to those who observe My 5a commandments truly and joyfully. / For them I shall bear witness on the Day of Judgment, the day of rendering account, for 'I visit the sins of the fathers upon their children, to the third and fourth gen- eration of them that hate Me, and I show mercy unto the thousands of them that love Me and keep My commandments' (Exod 20:5-6)."</page><page sequence="45">THE PIYYUT ON THE TEN COMMANDMENTS-DANA 367 And the third commandment came, as recorded, drifting in the heights of heaven, and it hovered and spoke: "Children of Israel, beware lest you swear falsely in My name, or take My name in vain. And if you swear an oath, keep your oath so that it may be a true and sincere oath and not a falsehood and an abomination. Beware of vain oaths and false promises. And if you take your God's name, take it truthfully, and take it only in truth and in sincerity. And you shall know that whosoever swears by My name in vain, I shall punish him and his offspring for many generations. "A vain oath destroys homes, slays offspring, withers flowers, sus- 5b pends rain and rain showers, / brings sickness and decay to the body, and converts an inhabited place into a wilderness. And God says, 'I shall pronounce the curse, and it will come upon him that swore falsely in My name, and it (the curse) shall abide in his house until it wipes out the memory of the house and breaks its stones, and causes its beams to fall.' "Beware therefore of vain oaths and false promises. Woe unto him that takes My name in vain! And happy is the man who does not swear by Me, neither vainly, nor falsely, nor idly, and who has not accustomed his tongue to utter lies or obscenities, but reveres the name of his God and fears the Lord. And if he mentions the name of his God, he should do so loyally, willfully, and from his heart, and if he speaks, his tongue shall speak truthfully. And he shall fear and illuminate the name of his God. That is My name, as I was called by Enoch, and I raised him up to My throne; and that is My name, as I was called by Noah whom I saved from the flood. And that is My name as I was called by Abraham, whom I saved from the fire of the furnace. And that is My name, as I was called by Isaac, and I sacrificed a ram in his place. And that is My name, 6a as I was called by Joseph, and I saved him from the seduction / of a woman; and that is My name, as I was called by Moses in the case of the Egyptian whom he slew, and in the case of the rod which turned into a serpent, and in the case of the serpent so that it re- turned and became a rod as it had been before. And that is My name, as I was called by Moses upon the sea, and I divided it into twelve lanes, a lane for each tribe. And that is My name, as I was called by Joshua when I caused the sun to stand still until he had overcome the last of his foes. That is My name, as I was called by Jonah in the belly of the whale, and I delivered him. And that is My name, that is called upon a sick man so that he is cured, and upon a blind man</page><page sequence="46">368 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW so that his eyes are opened. That is My name that is called upon a dead man so that he is restored to life, and upon a sick man in his agony so that he is restored to health. "I am the First of the first and the Last of the last. I am the living God, the Ever-Present, the Constant, and the Eternal. I am the God who will not absolve whosoever takes My name in vain." The fourth commandment came, as it is recorded, drifting in the heights of heaven, and it hovered and spoke: "Children of Israel, 6b remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy; six / days shalt thou labor and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any work, neither thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor the stranger that is within thy gates, so that they may rest like Thee. For in six days did the Lord make heaven and earth, the sea and all that is in it, and rested on the seventh day, and on that day he sat on his throne. Wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it (cf. Exod 20:8-11). "Children of Israel, keep the Sabbath, honor it, exalt it, lavish af- fection upon it, treat it with awe, elate it, adorn it, love it and purify it, crown it, dress it (in royal robes), make it your king, your ruler, your master, and your beloved; prefer it, believe in it, sanctify it, restore and renew it, distinguish it (from all the other days) and greatly strengthen it. "Children of Israel, children of My covenant, My pure ones, re- member the ten wonders which I performed in creating My world; and of all these I have preferred the seventh on account of the Sab- bath. I created seven firmaments, and of all these I have preferred / 7a the seventh firmament, and as witness thereof I have set My light there and My glory. I created seven seas, and of all these I have pre- ferred the seventh, the Red Sea, and there I performed My miracles before My people. I created seven planets in the dome of the firma- ment and in the galaxy of stars and lights, and of all these I have preferred the seventh orb, which is the sun, which gives light to the whole world. And I chose Abraham, My friend, and picked Moses to obey Me; and I created the world in six days, and on the seventh day I sat on My throne and wrote in the Torah that you must count seven times seven years, which will make forty-nine years, and the fiftieth year shall be the year of freedom, the year in which every man shall liberate his male slave and his female slave, and shall return a legacy to the legatee.

And I have written in my Torah that you must count seven times seven days, or forty-nine days. And I have preferred the fifti- eth day by revealing on that day the Torah. And I have created seven mountains to serve as foundations for the world, and over them all I have preferred Mount Sinai, and there I revealed my Torah. And 7b I honored David, / for he was the seventh of the forefathers, and I promised that he would have seven descendants, and these seven shall rule after them in the world to come, and of these seven I have pre- ferred the Messiah Yanon, who is the seventh. It is for these virtuous qualities that I have preferred every sev- enth. And I have preferred the Sabbath over all of them, for it is the seventh day. And I have given it a name, the day of success. It is a day of faith, a day of blessing, an elevated day, a day for indulgence, a day of joy, a day for honor, a day for visiting, a holiday, a day of purity, a day to take pride in, a great day, a day to wear (fine clothes), a holy day, a clean day, a happy day, a mighty day, a spe- cial day, a day for charity, a day for reading, an exalted day, a fearful day, a constant day, the day on which the creation of the world was completed, a day in which those who dwell in Hell shall rest from their torments. "Children of Israel, honor the Sabbath with clean clothes, fine fare, charitable deeds, and presents, so that those who are with you, the hapless and the helpless, shall enjoy all these good things, lest you be like one that is not numbered among God's creatures, and so that He may keep you from sorrow. And to whomsoever you do 8a good, I shall make a covenant with you and your children, / and an oath and good deeds, for ever and ever. Therefore the Lord has blessed the Sabbath and has sanctified it." The fifth commandment came, as it is recorded, drifting in the high heavens; and it hovered and spoke: "Children of Israel, be heed- ful to honor your parents, be heedful not to disregard what I have bidden you concerning their honor, for their honor is My honor, and in venerating them you venerate Me, and in caring for them you care for Me, for the three of us have had a part in creating you, son of man: God, may He be exalted; the father; and the mother: from the father, the white drop; from the mother, the red drop; from the fa- ther's white drop I created ten things, components of the body: the bones, the arteries, the external meninx, the sclera of the eyes, the brain, the nails, the teeth and the molars, the intestines, and the kid- 8b neys. And from the red drop, / which is from the mother, I created</page><page sequence="48">370 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW ten things: the flesh, the blood, the lungs, the heart, the liver, the gall bladder, the spleen, the pupil of the eye, the red of the lips, and hair. And ten things are from God: the spirit and the soul, the in- tellect, understanding, logic, sight, power, courage, contentment, and livelihood. "So I have concurred with your parents in creating you, son of man. Do not say, 'Therefore they have lied,' whether they have spo- ken the truth or whether they have lied. And do not sit in their place, whether they be absent or present, for their honor is My honor, and in caring for them you care for Me, and in elevating them you ele- vate Me. And do not show them an angry face, do not disobey them, nor should you resent their rebuke or contradict them. "And since the twenty limbs of your body were formed from your parents you are in duty bound to honor them, to care for them, to serve them, and to bear them on your shoulder. And if they should 9a be in (dire) need and sell you, / even then you may not bear witness against them, (rather) yet you must accept it if they bear witness against you. "These are the ten commandments, of which the first requires you to obey God, (to acknowledge) His oneness, not to worship idols, nor to swear an oath in vain. Keep the Sabbath, and do not kill an innocent person. Do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness against any person, and do not covet what is not yours. And honoring your parents is the most important of all the com- mandments. Solomon the wise, the son of David, may he rest in peace, said of children who do not respect their good parents and who reject their authority with a slanting of the eye, the eagles will pick their flesh and the birds will eat them ('The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out and the young eagles shall eat it,'-Prov 30:17). And Solomon the wise, the son of David, may he lie in peace, also said: 'My son, strive to honor your parents and to do their bidding promptly and well, and know that if your days are prolonged and you live long, as you treated your parents so too will your children treat you; and because you have honored them your days will be prolonged in the land which the Lord gives you' (Exod 20:12)." / 9b The sixth commandment came, as it is recorded, drifting in the high heavens, and it hovered and spoke: "Children of Israel, do not slay an innocent person, murdering him without cause and shedding innocent blood which is without guilt. And you shall have no part,</page><page sequence="49">THE PIYYUT ON THE TEN COMMANDMENTS-DANA 371 nor give counsel, in murder. And you shall not befriend murderers or take part in a murder. Murder is forbidden to you, and as punish- ment for murder food becomes costly and hunger comes to the world. Children of Israel, beware of taking life and shedding blood, for the high and mighty God has forbidden it; and whoever has taken the life of a faithful soul and has shed innocent blood, know that I, God, will demand it of him, for in My own image I created man, formed him in My own form, and created him with My own hands; how then can you destroy him and kill him mercilessly? For by many miracles I created man in his mother's womb; how then can you take a life that you have not created? If you take his life you cannot restore it, for you have hastened his end before his appointed time, and have cut him down before his term has ended. Keep away lOa from murder and from shedding / blood. God, who created life, will demand it of you. Do not take an innocent life for you cannot create life, neither can you restore it. And this is a sin that God will never forgive. If you show mercy, you will receive mercy, and if you hear- ken to Him, He will come to your aid. Follow God in this, and return in conscience to Him, for He is merciful. Whoever deals in murder, that man forswears God who created him, and God will never forgive him wherever he goes. Therefore he will be afraid, and wherever he may be he will live in fear, he and his offspring, and all who are his. The heavens will curse him, and the rivers will testify against him. Beware, therefore, of taking life and shedding blood. Fear God, my son, in order to save yourself; then you will be included among the righteous and the good, for I am the compassionate and merci- ful God." The seventh commandment came, as it is recorded, drifting in the high heavens, and it hovered and spoke: "Children of Israel, beware of corrupt practices and refrain from adultery, for adultery brings about poverty and misfortune. Do not lust after the foolish, evil, and harmful impulse that will lead you to disobey God's command. It destroys those who seek it, and kills those who indulge in it. Beware lOb then of succumbing to it. / Stand firm in your Torah and be content with what I have given you, and persevere in righteousness accord- ing to My commandment.

Hearken to your God and to your conscience and be content with your bedmate, for then God will greatly recompense you in your home and your waters and your prosperity will overflow. Go after your God. Do not uncover the nakedness of members of your family (cf. Lev 18:7-17). And go in the right way to your home, and you will know that God, to whom belongs glory and power, is pleased with you. Do not be a slave to your passions as the accursed devil tempts you to do. For from much corruption and rebelliousness come all the overwhelming adversities which come from God, which will cause harm to whoever walks in corrupt ways that are harmful to his family. "Do not, 0 simpleton, set your mind on a temptress, for her ways are the ways of death. Do not approach her, and do not find a way to her, and do not befriend her. Keep as far from her as you can. If you defeat her you are fleet and lightfooted. Beware of lying with an 1 la evil woman. / For she will find you a place in her thoughts and will lay out her nets until she catches you in her coils. Do not therefore be among her companions and do not stand at the door of her house, for she speaks smoothly, seduces you with her tongue, and gives you to drink of her waters. Beware, therefore, of the evil woman, and know that her steps lead to Hell, and her ways lead to death (cf. Prov 5-6). Therefore do not approach her, for he who falls victim to her will die, and he who escapes her will be saved. For she stands at the gate and talks to everyone, and brings much trouble to young men until she leads them into sin. "We have already found ten things that prevail over each other: the first is hard stone-iron breaks it; solid iron-fire melts it; a blaz- ing fire-water extinguishes it; mighty waters-clouds absorb them; thick clouds-wind blows them away; a strong wind-the earth raises it; solid earth-man is stronger than it; a strong man-worry overcomes him; grave worries-wine dispels them; strong wine- sleep dispels it; deep sleep-death ends it; invincible death-an evil woman is stronger than all of them. And Solomon the wise, son of David, may he lie in peace, said: 'And I find more bitter than death 1lb is a woman' (Qoh 7:26). / This means that we have found an evil woman more bitter than death. And we have found her snares more powerful than concealed nets and traps. She eateth and wipeth her mouth and says 'I have not eaten'; she hath done evil and says 'I have done no wrong' (cf. Prov 30:20); her way is the way of a ship in the</page><page sequence="51">THE PIYYUT ON THE TEN COMMANDMENTS-DANA 373 midst of the sea, the way of an eagle in the air, and the way of a serpent on a rock (cf.

And the verse also says: Can a bird fall into a snare upon the earth if there be no trap laid for him? Can a man carry hot coals in his lap and not burn his clothes? Can two walk together if they have not agreed to do so? Will a lion roar in the forest when he hath no prey? Can there be evil in the city if no one hath sinned? (cf. Amos 3:3-9). He who is drawn to sin and to all these forbidden things will lose his modesty, indulge in debauch- ery, and lose his strength. He will cling to sin and hold on to heresy. We have examined these ten things and have found that an evil woman is stronger than all of them. My son, if you believe in God He will protect you from her and from the likes of her." / 12a The eighth commandment came, as it is recorded, drifting in the high heavens, and it hovered and spoke: "Children of Israel, do not steal and do not befriend thieves, nor be their accomplice, for the sin of thieves drives away the clouds and the rain. Children of Israel, keep away from theft, turn aside from evil, and do not covet what is not yours. And know this, son of man, that when I created you in your mother's womb I have (already) provided for your livelihood. When your days shall be completed, and your months shall have been fulfilled, I shall call to you from my throne: 'Son of man, come out at my call and acknowledge my power. I am your God who brought you out of the confines of the womb and the darkness thereof.' Therefore, my son, do not steal, for I have provided for you a livelihood and I have given you strength. And if I were to reveal to you the time when your soul must leave your body, know that then nothing would remain of your livelihood, not even a little, the size of a sesame seed. Be content with what God has allotted you. The wise has also said: Sow what is not yours, and you will not reap. Be satisfied with what is permitted to you, for then you will eat it and enjoy it. And the son of David, may he rest in peace, also said concerning this world: How can you indulge in pleasure when your life is so short? Therefore, my son, hire yourself out as a laborer, 12b cover yourself with a straw mat, and eat the husk / of the barley grain, and do not steal either much or little. Do not steal from the rich man, saying 'He will not feel it'; neither steal from the poor man, for then you will make him poorer still. Do not rejoice in your heart at your neighbor's misfortune, so that none may rejoice over</page><page sequence="52">374 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the misfortune of your family and of those who are dear to you. If what you possess seems too little to you, be patient for yourself. Others have grave troubles, which come to them when their evil deeds are discovered. Was not the son of Zerach the most respected member of the tribe of Judah? Yet when he stole he was stoned to- gether with his loot (cf. Joshua 7). 'Blessed is he that considereth (the poor)' (Ps 41:2) and is wise and contented with the little that is per- mitted (to him)." The ninth commandment came as it is recorded, drifting in the high heavens. And it hovered and spoke: "Children of Israel, Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor" (Exod 22:13). There must not be among you false witnesses, for false witness brings evil (literally, a bad life) to the world. Keep away from lying and refrain from indecent acts; and do not take the life of an innocent man by accusing him of acts which he had not committed, thus killing him without a sword and wounding him without a spear, and causing him 13a to die before his time. / He thus takes three lives, having neither mind nor thought of the world to come. 0 you simpleton, beware of giving false witness, for God will punish you in this world and the next. False witness leaves no room for faith or religion. The first charge you will have to answer for to God is whether you have borne false witness. Be firm of mind, my son, and obey the Lord. And know that if you have borne false witness, you have come with honor but leave with shame. And know that the world punishes its people. How do we know that false witnesses have no place and no counsel in the next world? From the verse which says 'Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbor secretly' (Deut 27:24). This means cursed be he who smiteth his neighbor secretly. And it is also written, 'Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that present darkness as light and light as darkness; that present bitter as sweet and sweet as bitter' (Isa 5:20). This verse means: Woe unto him who says of the accused that he is good, and of the good man that he is loathsome, and turns light into darkness and darkness into light, and calls sweet bitter and bitter sweet. And so it will be with those who bear false witness-God will curse them. Therefore, my son, do not bear false witness against your neighbor." The tenth commandment came as it is recorded, drifting in the 13b high heavens, / and it hovered and spoke: "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything</page><page sequence="53">THE PIYYUT ON THE TEN COMMANDMENTS-DANA 375 that is thy neighbor's. Beware of covetousness and refrain from lust and seduction, for these are first of all a misfortune, and he who is tempted by his evil inclinations no longer sees but is blind, and does not care what he does. For him bitter is sweet and sweet is bitter. The sea for him is dry land, the dry land is sea, the crooked is straight, and the straight is crooked. The lust that has taken posses- sion of his heart and has blinded his eyes is like clouds that drip (rain), or a strong current that carries away whatever it meets and collects whatever comes into its hands, and prevails over everything. So it is with a foolish passion that destroys whoever submits to it, and harms those who lust after it. For it blinds those whom it pos- sesses, as if they had no eyes and no understanding minds. "But if the passion leaves him, his condition will improve and his ways will be straightened. He who has held to his religion will recover his mind and increase his wealth and his good possessions. He who is patient will achieve his desires, and he who achieves his desires will be satisfied. And he who is satisfied will give away (to others), and he who gives away will be built up, and he who is built 14a up will be exalted, and he who is exalted / will not lack good things. "But he who covets will change, and he who changes will lose; and he who has lost has fallen; and he who has fallen will slip; and he who has slipped will fall; and he who has fallen will be disgraced; and he who is disgraced will become poor; and he who is poor is humbled; and he who is humbled will be destitute because of his ill luck. Therefore, my son, beware lest you covet what is not yours; and be satisfied with what God has allotted to you. If you have held to your faith, God and his angels will love you. And beware lest you disobey Him. "Therefore do not covet what is not yours, nor what belongs to your friends; for the omnipotent God has given you (much) and will continue to give you. If your attitude to your Creator is wholly and entirely pure, you will be rewarded with loving kindness throughout your life, as it is written, 'That it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest prolong thy days' (Deut 22:7)." Let us pray God to cause Him to be feared and obeyed, to dwell in our hearts so that we may live a good life and learn to obey Him and study His Torah. May He build His temple for us in our lifetime, and gather those who are dispersed and far away, and may He look upon us with a merciful eye, and may He not disappoint us in what we hope to receive from Him. Amen, 0 Lord of the Universe!</page></plain_text>
