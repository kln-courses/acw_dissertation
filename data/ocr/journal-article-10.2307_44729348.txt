ABSTRACT Devices for the protection of car occupants during car collisions are being continuously improved and developed. The motivations for this never ending activity are not only to meet the safety design rules and standards, but even more to satisfy the increasing demands of consumers and to meet new challenges of competitors to be counteracted. This paper describes a numerical procedure for the optimisation of an existing restraint system including an OEM's airbag in front collisions. The solution process was systematically divided into four steps: 1) development of a computer model for the computer code MADYMO, 2) validation of the model by comparing the numerical and experimental results, 3) investigation of sensitivities of injury criteria to design changes, and 4) optimisation of the restraint system and airbag for minimum injury. The results indicate that the OEM's driver-side airbag and the existing restraint system can be substantially improved. By optimising the airbag and the restraint system separately, the overall injury levels are reduced by 17% and 9% respectively. When the airbag and the restraint system are optimised together, a 33% reduction of overall injury level has been achieved. It reveals that the airbag and the restraint system have to be tuned together to achieve the maximum safety performance. INTRODUCTION The continuously increasing demands on vehicle safety performance and improving requirement of the government regulations have been a major challenge for vehicle manufacturers in the 90's. This has resulted in a rapid implementation of the various restraint systems and airbags into new car models. One of very important problems in the development process is the optimal designs of restraint systems and airbags at a limited short time and in a cost effective way. The optimisation of vehicle occupant dynamics was firstly investigated by Bennet and Park [1]. Their major objective was the feasibility study and applications of the existing numerical optimisation techniques for high nonlinear occupant dynamics problems. The maximum potential of occupant injury reductions by optimisations, however, was not investigated and the optimal configurations of restraint systems and airbags were not covered. The optimisation of the passenger airbags were experimentally conducted by Narwani and Subbian [2], using the Taguchi method. Reasonable results were obtained but the maximum injury reduction may not be achieved due to the use of a relatively simple method. The aim of the paper is to investigate how much potential is still available in an existing restraint system including an OEM's driver-side airbag for the reduction of injury severity to car occupants during frontal collisions. SYSTEM MODELLING A restraint system and a driver-side airbag provided by an industrial partner were used to create a baseline model for numerical simulation. The baseline model consists of the following groups of components: 1) a biofidelic dummy, represented by a 50th percentile Hybrid III anthropomorphic dummy model of MADYMO computer program [3], 2) the restraint system without an airbag, but including the seat, seat belt, retractor, sash and webbing clamp [4][5], 3) the airbag model [6], 4) the vehicle interior consisting of the dashboard, steering wheel, floor pan and toe pan; 5) the vehicle frontal structure represented by a deceleration pulse. The dynamic model of the system is shown in Figure 1. 2878</page><page sequence="2">Figure 1. The system dynamic model The following assumptions and simplifications were made: 1. The intrusion of the steering column is not simulated. The intrusion effects are represented by positioning the steering wheel and instrument panel to a statistical average position from the static vehicle position [7]. 2. The finite element airbag model in the unfolded mode consists of the two round flat disks connected together along their edges. This is a reasonable approximation when out-of- position situations of drivers are not considered. 3. The dummy is in a normal seating position. 4. The seat belt is modelled by sliding springs instead of a finite element belt in order to reduce computing time. 5. The deceleration pulse is taken from a sled test with an initial velocity of 48 km/h; this is acceptable, because the occupant's motion has a negligible effect on the deceleration of the vehicle. VALIDATION OF THE BASELINE MODEL To examine the reliability of the MADYMO baseline model, the model was validated by comparing the simulation results with the results from a sled test, as shown in Table 1 and Figure A.l in Appendix. The injury criteria set by the ADR69 were used for the evaluation of driver's injury [8]. They are: • HIC36 value for resultant head deceleration. • 3ms criterion for resultant chest deceleration. • Chest compression. • Femur loads. As Figure A.l shows, simulation results of the chest deceleration, the pelvic deceleration and the chest compression correlate well with the sled test results, the head deceleration differ in a slight time delay around the peak. This difference may be caused by an assumption of constant venting discharge coefficient in the MADYMO airbag model. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Design Parameters and Injury Criteria In order to reduce the number of design parameters in the optimisation process, a sensitivity analysis was carried out first by using the correlated baseline model. Parameters showing negligible effects on the injury severity in the current system configuration would be then kept unchanged in optimisation process. The design parameters were selected as follows: a.) The airbag: the airbag size, vent size (same size for two vents), trigger time, strap length, strap stiffness and inflator mass flow rate. b.) The restraint system: the shoulder belt stiffness, the lap belt stiffness, the buckle stiffness and the seat cushion stiffness. Table 1.

The values of design parameters are defined by the percentage changes relative to their baseline values. The variations of design parameters are selected in terms of possible design changes allowed.

The head injury criterion HIC36, chest acceleration for 3ms, chest compression and femur loads were used for the evaluation of injury. The Weighted Injury Criterion (WIC), recommended in [9], was used for the assessment of the overall change of injury. The WIC is defined as the sum of weighted percentages of injury values in the following way: WIC = 0.6(HICi6) + 0.3 5(-^- + Ccomp ) / 2.0 1000 60 0.0762 (1) +0.05(F{eft"r + FrighT) ! 20.0 where HIC36 the value of head injury criterion, C3ms the 3 ms criterion value of the chest deceleration in g , Ccomp the chest compression in m , Ff^fr the maximum load of left femur in kN, Flight' the maximum load of right femur in kN. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the effects on individual injury values by changes of design parameters from the airbag and the restraint system. Sensitivity Evaluation Airbag From the run 1 to run 12 in Figure 2, the following sensitivity information can be derived: 1. The WIC is very sensitive to the airbag diameter and inflator mass flow rate. The effect from changing the strap stiffness is negligible. 2. The HIC36 sensitive to the airbag diameter, the inflator mass flow rate and the trigger time. It is also sensitive to the changes of the vent sizes and strap length. The effect of the strap stiffness can be neglected. 3. The 3ms criterion for chest acceleration and the chest compression are sensitive to the airbag diameter, inflator mass flow rate, trigger time. No effects are observed from changing the strap length and stiffness. The femur loads in simulation are very small in comparison with their limits and not included. Based on the information outlined above, the airbag diameter, inflator mass flow rate, trigger time, vent size and strap length were selected as design variables for the optimisation of the airbag. The strap stiffness was kept unchanged. Restraint system From the run 13 to the run 20 in Figure 3, the following sensitivity information can be obtained for the restraint system: 1. The WIC is sensitive to the stiffness of the shoulder belts, the stiffness of the seat cushion and the lap belt stiffness. The changes of the buckle stiffness has minimal influence on the WIC. 2. The HIC36 is sensitive to the shoulder belt stiffness, seat cushion stiffness and lap belt stiffness. The effect of the buckle stiffness is relatively small. 3. The 3ms criterion for chest acceleration is slightly sensitive to all parameters of the restraint system. 2880</page><page sequence="4">4. The chest compression is only sensitive to the shoulder belt stiffness. From the results of sensitivity analysis for the restraint system, the shoulder belt stiffness, lap belt stiffness and seat cushion stiffness were selected as design variables to optimise. The buckle stiffness was not changed. It can be clearly seen that the sensitivity analysis may only provide a guideline about the effects on injury levels by changing the design parameters but do not predict the best possible system configuration for a maximum injury reduction. ■ WIC n HIC36 ■ 3ms chest acceleration ■ Chest compression 70 60 ^ n CO CD -§ 50 : &gt; - - ^ 40 : i* i i i i i - 10 I I I - o I ; mm£D MD ■ - ■ L-, □=! p, £ _10 I □=! p, - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Run number Figure 2.

Based on multiple rigid body dynamics, MADYMO provides a more economical alternative for design optimisation. There are generally two categories of optimisation methods suitable for the optimisation of highly nonlinear engineering problems. They are gradient methods and direct search methods. The gradient methods require derivative calculations of the objective function for all the design parameters, repeated successively from one feasible design point to another, until satisfactory results are achieved. They become slow and complicated when applied to crash problems, because it is impossible to calculate the derivatives of the objective function analytically. The direct search methods use only the objective function values for constructing the solution algorithm. In this study, a direct search method named the orthogonal grid method [10] is used but in a modified form to increase the rate of convergence. Mathematical Model of Optimisation The objective function to be optimised is defined as: G = fjWixfi (2) /=1 where G the objective function, identical with WIC in Eq.(l), fi the i-th sub-objective function ( i=l,3), W¡ the weighting factor for ft (i=l-3) shown in Eq.(l). fi represents the percentage of the i-th injury with respect to its limit. Wi is the statistically significant factor [9] of the i- th injury type, which ranks the priority of the i-th injury value. Based on the results of the sensitivity analysis, the five parameters from the airbag and three parameters from the restraint system were selected as design variables, denoted as (j=l&gt;8)- Suppose that the upper and lower boundaries for the j-th variable are defined as Xmax'-y and Xmin'J, then the mathematical model for the optimisation process can be expressed as 3 Min G = ^ Wi x f, (3) /=1 subject to side constraints Xminj&lt; Xj &lt; Xmax'-/.(/ = l,...,8; ( 4) Implementation of System Optimisation The flow chart of the optimisation procedure is shown in Figure 5. The MADYMO software was used as a solver to calculate the injury values for various design configurations. The modified orthogonal grid method was implemented as an optimiser of the program. The data exchanges among the optimiser, the MADYMO input and output are conducted by a main controller in the program.

Then, the airbag and the restraint system were optimised together. Table 3 summarises the results obtained from the optimisations, and Table 4 shows the values of the design parameters (defined by the percentage changes with respect to their baseline values) of the optimised design configurations. Figure A.2 in Appendix shows the optimised results of the head deceleration, chest deceleration, pelvis deceleration and chest compression. ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION OF RESULTS Potential of Individual Optimisation As shown in Table 3, the injury levels are already reduced in a reasonable amount by optimising the OEM's airbag without changing the restraint system, and in a small amount by optimising the restraint system without changing the airbag. Airbag system By optimising the airbag only, the most significant reduction, as expected, is achieved in HIC values: HIC 15 by 41% and HIC36 by 28%. The 3ms criterion for chest acceleration, however, increases by 0.8%. The WIC is reduced by 17%. Compared with the baseline model, the optimised airbag has the configuration of a 15% smaller airbag size, 24% larger vent size, 6.8% shorter strap, 3.3% quicker trigger time and an 30% extra mass flow for the inflator.

Restraint system By optimising the restraint system only, ie keeping the airbag parameters at their baseline values, all the injury criteria are reduced only slightly. The WIC value is reduced by 9%. The injury reduction is achieved by the optimised restraint system with the configuration of a 38% softer shoulder belt, 73% stiffer lap belt and a 28% stiffer seat cushion. These results suggest that existing restraint system should be re-evaluated whilst an OEM's airbag is to be installed into a new car model in order to make full use of the potential of the restraint system. Total system optimisation To exploit the maximum potential of injury reduction, the airbag and restraint system are optimised together. As illustrated in Table 3, the HIC values are significantly reduced, by 60% for HIC 15 and by 47% for HIC36. The 3ms criteria for the resultant chest acceleration and the chest compression are reduced by 9% and 18% respectively. The maximum femur loads decrease by 22% for the left femur and by 33% for the right femur. The WIC value is reduced by 33%. The constraints of parameters used in the total system optimisation are the same with those in the individual optimisations. Evaluation of the optimised system The deceleration pulses from the sled test are usually stiffer than ones obtained from real front collisions. To investigate the performance variations of the optimised system in more realistic frontal collisions, a pulse from a barrier test at the speed 48 km/h is used, as shown in Figure A.3 in Appendix. Table 5 illustrates the simulation results when the barrier pulse is applied. The results show that the injury reductions are close to those by using the sled test pulse. The WIC value is reduced by 3 1%. Figure A.4 in Appendix shows the simulation results of the head deceleration, chest deceleration, pelvic deceleration and chest compression. The significant reductions of the head deceleration and chest compression are observed. CONCLUSION With an additional OEM's airbag and a optimised restraint system, the overall level of occupant injury was only reduced by 9%. The overall injury level could be reduced even more up to 17% by optimising the OEM's airbag. A 33% injury reduction has been achieved when the original restraint system and the additional airbag are optimised together. A simple installation of an OEM's airbag into an existing restraint system can not guarantee the best protection for occupants in front collisions. For certain type of vehicles, OEM's airbags and the existing restraint system have to be optimised together to substantially improve safety performance.
