<plain_text><page sequence="1">WILLIAM SHUTER History as Palingenesis in Pater and Hegel BERNARD FEHR first detected the bor- rowings from Hegel's Aesthetik in Pater's Winckelmann essay in 1916.1 Since then the evidence of Hegel's influence on Walter Pater has continued to accumulate. Those who knew Pater as a young man consistently remember him as deeply interested in Hegel's thought; moreover, his undergraduate associations with T. H. Green, E. Caird, and William Wallace, as well as his admiration for Benjamin Jowett, connect him with the generating spirits of Oxford Hegelian- ism.2 Pater knew the German text of at least three of Hegel's major works. He himself cites Hegel's Aesthetik and Geschichte der Philosophie, and there is substantial evidence that he studied the Phe- nomenologie des Geistes.3 Examination of the un- published Houghton MS and of the original version of the Winckelmann essay has added to the already numerous allusions to Hegel in Pater's published work.4 There is, in fact, more evidence for Pater's sustained interest in Hegel than in any other philosopher, ancient or modern, with the exception of Plato. The question that remains is did his interest in Hegel have a positive effect on Pater's work. The case for the affirmative has not yet been demonstrated. This is not difficult to understand if we consider the peculiar character of Pater's literary produc- tion. Hovering somewhere between theoretical criticism and imaginative creation, Pater's work seems the product of two conflicting motives, each impeding the other. Pater has neither the unity and consistency of a thinker nor the con- creteness and immediacy of a creative artist.5 The most recent and thorough examination of Hegel's influence on Pater strikingly illustrates the diffi- culty. Anthony Ward argues that Hegel offered Pater and his contemporaries a way of perceiving a principle of rational order amid the flux and relativity of experience, but that owing to his own temperamental ambivalence, Pater could realize such a synthesis only theoretically. The Hegelian ideal was thus not an effective stimulus to Pater's creative imagination but rather the "Sangraal of an endless pilgrimage." Ward concludes that "Plato and Platonism is by far Pater's most im- pressive work. . . . He was never a writer of fiction.... Nowhere does Pater show the plastic power which he himself recognizes as the prime artistic ability, the capacity to change ideas into images."6 We need not accept this conclusion, but we should acknowledge that in tracing the in- fluence of Hegel on Pater's work, Ward formulates the very relevant question of whether Pater did successfully resolve the antagonism between his theoretical and imaginative impulses. I believe that he did. What Pater needed was a perspective distant enough so that he could view his object theoretically but close enough so that he could exploit its imaginative value. He found such a perspective in the activity of historical re- flection. The cast of Pater's mind was fundamen- tally historical, not in the sense of re-creating the past wie es eigentlich gewesen (which was not his principal intention), but in the sense that he per- ceived with special intensity the paradoxical char- acter of historical existence.7 For Pater, the stream of history is like the flux of Heraclitus, dissolving all points of fixity or rest. But as the flux could not withstand the pressure of Zeno's paradoxes, so the historical process appears under examination to be more illusory than real. The present, the his- torical "now," can scarcely be said to exist for Pater. Under his vision it becomes a reenactment of the past or an adumbration of the future. What looks like innovation is in reality the calling into life of seeds already contained in the womb of the past: ". . the seemingly new is old also, a pal- impsest, a tapestry of which the actual threads have served before, or like the animal frame itself, every particle of which has already lived and died many times over" (P&amp;P, p. 8). In giving form to this insight, Pater drew upon a number of sources. He flirted with Goethe's conception of historical cycles and of the meta- morphosis of Urformen. Echoing Goethe's aphor- 411</page><page sequence="2">412 History as Palingenesis in Pater and Hegel ism that "all truth was discovered long ago," Pater observes that "the germs of almost all philosophical ideas were unfolded in the mind of antiquity,"8 and he speaks of "those 'Mothers' who in the second part of Faust, mould and re- mould the typical forms which appear in human history" (Ren, p. 207). From the post-Niebuhr school of historians he learned to detect analogies between the institutions of earlier and later cul- tures. (Milman's description of Abraham as a sheik was the most notorious instance of this method.)9 Such parallels became a habit of Pater's mind and style. His historical vision was consti- tutionally double, passing "from Rome, to Paris or London" (ME, II, 14) or finding it "pleasant when, looking at medieval sculpture, we are re- minded of that of Greece; pleasant likewise, con- versely, in the study of Greek work to be put on thoughts of the Middle Age" (GS, p. 269). The term "survivals," the persistence of more primitive modes of thought into a later age, a conception which Pater employs in his treatment of myth, was a formulation of the anthropologist E. B. Tylor.10 But of the various ideas of history that Pater exploited imaginatively, by far the most important was Hegel's conception of development. Pater often associates the idea of development either explicitly or implicitly with Hegel. In Plato and Platonism, for example, he says that to Hegel, "nature, and art, and polity, and philosophy, aye, and religion too, each in its long historical series, are but so many conscious movements in the secular process of the eternal mind" (P&amp;P, p. 19). But such abstract allusions give no indication of the imaginative value that Pater found in Hegel's thought. Hegel was actually a self-confessed en- emy of abstraction. The universal must become concrete. As Pater acknowledges, Hegel himself often embodies his conceptions in striking images. The Winckelmann essay refers to "Hegel's beauti- ful comparison" of the art of Egypt to "a Memnon, waiting for the day, the day of the Greek spirit, the humanistic spirit, with its power of speech" (Ren, p. 211). In fact, Hegel's imagination was, like Pater's, historical. In the process of develop- ment he perceived a pattern of evolving contention, of struggle and resolution that resembles a dra- matic action in which the actors are not persons but phases of cultural history. Hegel describes this pattern both theoretically and imaginatively. Apprehended theoretically it illustrates the oper- ation of the principle of mediation; apprehended by the imagination it is a rhythm of death and rebirth. "Development," Hegel says in his Logic, "is another word for mediation."11 In itself every phase of man's spiritual life is discrete. But since spirit is essentially a process, each phase is also under an internal pressure to break up, to submit to becoming, change, or, as Hegel calls it, medi- ation. Mediation annuls or dissolves, but only through this act of dissolution can the implicit character of spiritual life become explicit. Hegel refers to this principle as "the portentous power of the negative," sometimes as "Death": "But the life of the mind is not one that shuns death, and keeps clear of destruction, it endures death and in death maintains its being. It only wins to its truth when it finds itself utterly torn asunder.""2 This is no casual metaphor of Hegel's. His fre- quent imagery of rebirth embodies his conviction that to apprehend the process of development we must think in contradictions-of a refutation that affirms what it refutes and a negation that con- serves what it annuls. For Pater this mode of thought provided an "instrument of criticism" and a "point of view" more fruitful than Hegel's formal system. If Pater's allusions to Hegel are often ambivalent-praising Hegel's intention but rejecting Hegelian ortho- doxy-it is because, like a number of nineteenth- century thinkers, Pater tried to rescue Hegel's living insight from the suffocating weight of his own system. From Pater's point of view the essence of this insight was embodied in Hegel's imagery of cultural palingenesis. There is therefore no better way of demonstrating the creative influence of Hegel on Pater than by tracing the pattern of rebirth images that runs through his work. This pattern itself has something of an organic character. Each image generates a more complex image, assimilating in the process more and more of Pater's eclectic interests and imaginatively uni- fying them. The first of the rebirth images to figure prom- inently in the work of Pater is that of metempsy- chosis. The argument of Hegel's Phenomenology of Mind culminates in a definition of history as "the process of becoming in terms of knowledge," a definition which Hegel goes on to explain in the language of metempsychosis and reminiscence. Earlier cultural phases, being past, have suffered</page><page sequence="3">William Shuter 413 death in time, but as they are recapitulated in the mental life of the individual who is making the culture of the past his own, they are, in a sense, reborn as stages in an ideal process: Spirit leaves its external existence behind and gives its embodiment over to Recollection (Erinnerung). In thus concentrating itself on itself, Spirit is engulfed in the night of its own self-consciousness; its vanished exis- tence-the previous state, but born anew from the womb of knowledge-is the new stage of existence, a new world, and a new embodiment or mode of Spirit. Here it has to begin all over again at its immediacy, as freshly as before, and rise once more to the measure of its stature, as if, for it, all that preceded were lost, and as if it had learned nothing from the experience of the spirits that preceded. But re-collection (Erinnerung) has conserved that experience, and is the inner being, and, in fact, the higher form of the substance. While, then, this phase of Spirit, begins all over again its formative development, apparently starting solely from itself, yet at the same time it commences at a higher level."3 According to Ingram Bywater, Pater's close friend at Queen's College, Pater was studying the Phe- nomenology of Mind in the original German during the summer of 1861.14 "Diaphaneite," Pater's ear- liest extant prose sketch, was presented to the Old Mortality Society in 1864. The essay contains the following passage, which he used in 1866 as a de- scription of Winckelmann: ... he seems to realize that fancy of the reminiscence of a forgotten knowledge hidden for a time in the mind itself; as if the mind of one, lover and philosopher at once in some phase of preexistence-0'Xo)o4o0qo-as wrorE p.er' E'pwros-fallen into a new cycle, were begin- ning its intellectual culture over again, yet with a cer- tain power of anticipating its results. (Ren, p. 194) Pater returns to the subject of metempsychosis in several later essays, always treating it as a meta- phor for the historical process by which the past is repeated or cumulatively recapitulated in the present. In his treatment of Pythagoras in Plato and Platonism (1893), Pater describes Pythagoras' doctrine of transmigration as a symbolic intuition of the law of historical development and describes this development in language that strongly sug- gests Hegel: For in truth we come into the world, each one of us, "not in nakedness," but by the natural course of or- ganic development clothed far more completely than even Pythagoras supposed in a vesture of a past, which is, (so science would assure us) not ours, but of the race, the species, that Zeit-geist or abstract secular process.... It is humanity itself now-abstract hu- manity-that figures as the transmigrating soul, ac- cumulating into its "colossal manhood" the experience of ages; making use of, and casting aside in its march, the souls of countless individuals, as Pythagoras sup- posed the individual soul to cast aside again and again its outworn body. (P&amp;P, pp. 72-73) The imagery of metempsychosis is most frequent, however, in the Studies in the Renaissance. It ap- pears not only in the essay on Winckelmann, but in the essay on Michelangelo, and it forms the climax of the celebrated description of Leonardo's Gioconda. In the varied cultural perspectives re- flected in this painting, Pater discerns an imagi- native prefiguration of the conception of history as an all-inclusive synthesis: The fancy of a perpetual life, sweeping together ten thousand experiences, is an old one and modern phil- osophy has conceived the idea of humanity as wrought upon by, and summing up in itself, all modes of thought and life. Certainly Lady Lisa might stand as the embodiment of the old fancy, the symbol of the modern idea. (Ren, pp. 125-26) In fact, d'Hangest calls the idea of preexistence and reminiscence one of the "perspectives mai- tresses" of Pater's Renaissance studies."5 This seems to me a very fruitful observation, but all I wish to note here is that in the series of rebirth images which Pater employs to describe the process of historical development the idea of metempsy- chosis forms a transition to the idea of renaissance. Pater's conception of renaissance is too subtle and complex a product of external influences and personal sensibility to be readily summarized. Nevertheless, when Pater attempts to define the Renaissance in relation to other stages of Western art, he is strongly influenced by Hegel. The Winckelmann essay (1867), as Fehr has shown, contains a faithful and sympathetic outline of Hegel's Aesthetik. Following Hegel, Pater defines art as the sensuous embodiment of a spiritual content and distinguishes three possible relations of spiritual content to its sensuous medium.16 These three relations determine the three phases in the development of art: the Symbolic, the Clas- sical, and the Romantic (or, as Pater often calls it, the Christian). The religious conceptions of Egypt and India were so vague and undefined that the sensible medium of art could represent them only</page><page sequence="4">414 History as Palingenesis in Pater and Hegel under the mode of abstract symbols. The charac- teristic art of this phase is architecture. The aliena- tion of spiritual content from sensible form was overcome by the Greeks, whose harmonious ad- justment of the mental and physical spheres pro- vided a spiritual content ever, according to Pater, "in the happiest readiness to be transformed into objects for the senses" (Ren, p. 204). Sculpture is the characteristic art of the classical phase. In the last phase the equilibrium of classical art is again disrupted, not, however, because the spiritual con- tent is imperfect or indistinct but because it has been so intimately explored. Striving to express the spiritual depths of inwardness ("Innerlich- keit"), romantic art has as its paradoxical task "the sensuous expression of ideas which unre- servedly discredit the world of sense" (Ren, p. 225). The characteristic romantic arts are painting, music, and poetry. It is noteworthy that this Hegelian scheme leaves no room for the Renaissance as a distinct stage in the evolution of art. Hegel himself does not use the term. When he describes the flowering of Italian art in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, he treats it as the fullest realization in the visual arts of the romantic or Christian principle. Why then did Pater, for whom the Renaissance was so significant an idea, find Hegel's Aesthetik to his purpose? Principally because Pater, following Hegel, conceived all historical change as part of the continuous evolutionary growth of the human spirit. Rejecting "trenchant and absolute divisions," whether between pagan and Christian or medieval and Renaissance, he prefers to speak of the Re- naissance as "an uninterrupted effort of the middle age." There is a sense in which "it was ever taking place." The "deeper view," in general, is one that "preserves the identity of European culture" (Ren, pp. 225-26). Hegel offered a coherent version of the history of culture which could accommodate Pater's conception of the Renaissance with sur- prisingly little difficulty. Indeed, from this point of view Pater's idea of Renaissance appears in large part as an intelligent refinement of Hegel's own thought. For Pater, as for Hegel, the spiritual develop- ment expressed in the history of European art includes a necessary stage of negation or contra- diction. Only out of an antagonism between spirit and flesh, disrupting the equilibrium of the Hel- lenic ideal, could the distinctive spiritual content of Italian art emerge: ". . . it was necessary that a conflict should come, that some sharper note should grieve the existing harmony, and the spirit chafed by it beat out at last only a larger and profounder music" (Ren, p. 222). Pater sketches this transition from medieval painting with "the air of the charnel-house" about it, to the "clear loveliness" of Perugino and Raphael. To such art Pater applies Hegel's summary definition of ro- mantic art: "The religious spirit, as Hegel says, 'smiled through its tears' " (Ren, p. 225).17 As employed by Pater, this phrase carries much of the weight it has in Hegel's Aesthetik, where it serves as a figure for that affirmation achieved through negation and death which makes up the necessary rhythm of spiritual development. Ac- cording to Hegel, the "blitheness and happiness" of classical art must "be glorified and expanded in real blessedness." "Blessed is the soul, which has, it is true, experienced both conflict and pain, but come victorious through its troubles.""8 With these Hegelian associations in the background, we can appreciate why Pater chose to employ the framework of Hegel's Aesthetik in defining his conception of the Renaissance. As a metaphor of rebirth, the term alludes, indirectly but unmis- takably, to the operation of Hegel's principle of mediation. In this sense Pater has provided an accurate and highly suitable image for Hegel's insight. This tendency to exploit Hegelian conceptions figuratively is even more pronounced in the case of another of Pater's major images of rebirth, that of the death and revival of the pagan gods. Pater uses two forms of this theme. In "Denys l'Auxerrois" and "Apollo in Picardy," he develops the fantasy of the deceased gods reappearing in an alien Christian world. The essays on Dionysus and Demeter, on the other hand, study the myths of divine death and rebirth known to the Greeks themselves. The two variations are related, and in each case it was a reflection of Hegel that pro- vided Pater with his initial stimulus. The classical gods of Greece occupy an impor- tant place in Hegel's theory of cultural develop- ment. In the typical perfection of their bodily form, the sculptured gods are, for Hegel, the principal expression of the classical Ideal. Exempt from time, suffering, and death, they enjoy a perpetual and undisturbed serenity, a condition which Hegel and Pater after him, calls "Heiterkeit." As sym-</page><page sequence="5">William Shuter 415 bols of the classical Ideal these gods are fated to die with the culture they represent. In describing this transitional moment Hegel exhibits what is most characteristic in his dialectical method: the demonstration that the seeds of a later phase were already present in the phase to be superseded, or, as Hegel puts it, "The gods of classical art contain in themselves the germ of their overthrow."'9 Pater, himself drawn to what d'Hangest calls the "dawn and twilight" moments of culture,20 fol- lows Hegel with special fidelity on this point. A note to the original version of the Winckelmann essay cites the German text of the Aesthetik. Speaking of the Greek gods, Hegel writes: . . . their cheerfulness of spirit looks far away and over death, the grave, loss and temporality, and for the very reason that it is profound inherently contains the negative we are discussing. And the more this earnest- ness and spiritual freedom is prominent in the vision of these godlike figures the more we feel the contrast between this loftiness and the determinate corporality in which they are enclosed. The blessed gods mourn quite as much over their blessedness as their bodily environment. In the letters of their form we read the destiny which lies before them.2' Pater's imaginatively heightened version reads: The placid minds even of Olympian gods are troubled with thoughts of a limit to duration, of inevitable de- cay, of dispossession. Again, the supreme and colour- less abstraction of those divine forms, which is the secret of their repose, is also a premonition of the fleshless, consumptive refinements of the pale medieval artists. That high indifference to the outward, that impassivity, has already a touch of the corpse in it: we see already Angelico and the Master of the Passion in the artistic future.... Those abstracted gods ... who can fold up their flesh as a garment, and still re- main themselves, seem already to feel that bleak air, in which like Helen of Troy, they wander as spectres of the middle age. (Ren, p. 224) This passage is Pater's first allusion to the idea of the afterlife of the Greek gods. This theme is mentioned again in the essay on Pico della Mirandola and Raphael and developed at greatest length in "Denys l'Auxerrois" (1886) and "Apollo in Picardy" (1893). Pater attributes the idea to Heine's essay "Gods in Exile," but his own treatment of the theme is darker and graver than Heine's playful fantasy and reflects a con- siderably more complex view of cultural history. In one sense Pater's gods, reborn into an un- familiar Christian world, are "in exile." In the vitality and health of Dionysus and Apollo, the medieval conscience perceives something sinister, even malign. But in another respect the tragic fates of these gods, the slaying of Hyacinthus and the dismemberment of Dionysus, are merely in- tensified reenactments of episodes in their earlier divine careers. In this sense the gods have really been displaced into an environment more suited to the evocation of their latent dark side than was the sane and sunny world of Greece. The para- doxical ambivalence of the situation is typical of Pater. The revival of the pagan gods in the depths of the Middle Ages symbolizes an early attempt at cultural renaissance inspired by the Greek ideal. But beneath the surface lies the implication that the sensibility of medieval Christianity was antici- pated by the Greeks themselves.22 This insight Pater attributes explicitly to Hegel. In its original version the passage about the "troubled Olym- pians" was introduced by the following observa- tion about Winckelmann: He failed to see, what Hegel has so cunningly detected, a sort of preparation for the romantic within the limits of the Greek ideal itself. Greek art has not merely its mournful mysteries of Adonis, of Hyacinthus, of Ceres but it is conscious also of the fall of earlier divine dynasties. Hyperion gives way to Apollo, Oceanus to Poseidon.23 This remark strikes the keynote of Pater's sub- sequent studies in Greek culture. Whether he is discussing Greek religion, thought, or art, nothing is more characteristic of Pater than his allusions to comparable elements of Christian culture. But what I want to emphasize is that in the chain of Pater's rebirth imagery, the Winckelmann essay associates the idea of romantic/Christian senti- ment with the figure of Demeter and links them by means of an allusion to Hegel. Near the end of the first essay on Demeter (1876), Pater repeats the point first made in the Winckelmann essay: . . . the legend of Demeter and Persephone, perhaps the most popular of all Greek legends, is sufficient to show that the "worship of sorrow" was not without its function in Greek religion . .. while the most important artistic monuments of that legend suffi- ciently prove that the Romantic spirit was really at work in the minds of Greek artists. (GS, p. 111) The text of the essay is punctuated with Christian</page><page sequence="6">416 History as Palingenesis in Pater and Hegel references. Episodes from the myth are compared to the favorite subjects of Christian iconography. Demeter is a "mater dolorosa" and the celebration of her story at Eleusis is like the "medieval cere- monies of Palm Sunday" (GS, pp. 145, 122). Pater even notes the significant point that reliefs from the story of Persephone were "built up ... in the walls of Christian churches" (GS, p. 140). The ground of these analogies is quite explicit. Demeter "cannot but seem the type of divine grief," and Persephone "is the goddess of death, yet with a promise of life to come" (GS, p. 93). The myth of Demeter and Persephone is, in short, a prefigura- tion of the death and resurrection of Christ. So much is clear. But Pater introduces a further com- plication by suggesting that the resurrection myth, whether in its Christian or pagan form, is itself a kind of metaphor for the historical growth of human consciousness. For from his study of Hegel, Pater had become familiar with Hegel's interpretation of the doctrine of the Resurrection. According to Hegel's Aesthetik, "classical art and its religion of beauty" did not conceive death "in its full and essential significance"; consequently "we cannot wholly find in it the resurrection of the Spirit."24 Christianity supplied art with the story of the death and resurrection of Christ. However, Hegel makes it clear that he does not think of romantic art merely as the vehicle of Christian doctrine. The myth is an imaginative expression of the truth that in the life of the mind a higher stage can be generated only through negation and contradiction. Speaking of the "process of Spirit," Hegel says: In the first instance, however ... this universal history comes before us itself merely as the form of one person, to whom it is conjoined as his own, as the history, that is, of his birth, his suffering, and return from death; at the same time there is the further significance at- tached to this personal history, namely, that it is the history of universal and absolute Spirit itself.25 The Resurrection becomes, therefore, a symbol for the developing life of the mind. The Demeter essays similarly connect the ideas of resurrection and development. Pater detects a significant parallel between the external history and the content of the Demeter legend. He alludes to this parallel in explaining that neither the story nor the ritual of Demeter had a "single special author": Here again, as in the story itself, the idea of develop- ment, of degrees, of a slow and natural growth ... is the illuminating thought which earlier critics lacked. (GS, pp. 121-22) But primarily it is in the scope and direction of the essays that Pater makes this point. The peculiar interest of the Demeter myth for Pater is that its history can be followed, like a continuous thread, from the beginnings of western civilization to the present. He traces its origins among the pre-Hel- lenic inhabitants of Greece, its growth among the Hellenic Greeks, its apparent disappearance with the decline of the ancient world, and its "after- life" in Christian ritual and art. The final pages summarize the history of the myth in terms of the image of the pomegranate; originally an attribute of Persephone and a symbol of the fruitful earth, it became, in Christian art, an emblem of spiritual rebirth. Thus when Pater concludes by asking "What is there in this phase of ancient religion for us, at the present day?" the question provokes a cumulative impression of the historical evolution traced in the essays themselves. Pater has suc- ceeded in making Persephone's victory over death an image of historical continuity and renewal at a higher level. He tells us that only by relinquishing its "link on historical fact" could the Demeter myth have become what it is for us, a "religion of pure ideas" (GS, p. 151). The historical death of the myth has, in retrospect, been reduced to a necessary moment in its life. Like the growth of human consciousness which it both illustrates and symbolizes, it is still alive in its grave. The Demeter essays illustrate Pater's mature use of Hegel's thought. Pater has so thoroughly as- similated Hegel's conception of the historical pro- cess that he can be said to have made it his own. No longer dependent on Hegel's illustrations, he finds his own imagery to express a dialectical con- ception of historical change. The principal scholarly source from which Pater extracted the material of the Demeter essays is of particular interest. When Pater published the first of two essays in the Fortnightly Review, he in- cluded a reference to Ludwig Preller's Demeter und Persephone.26 From Preller, Pater took not only an interpretation of the Demeter myth but the general view of primitive religion on which he was to base his richest imagery of historical death and rebirth. Preller was one of the more important nine- teenth-century German scholars who applied the historical method to the study of Greek religion</page><page sequence="7">William Shuter 417 and myth.27 His work on Demeter and Persephone is an inquiry into the origin of the mystical element in Greek religion. Since this mystical feeling was concentrated in the cult of Demeter and in De- meter only insofar as she was associated with Persephone, it is with the mysterious figure of Persephone that the inquiry is principally con- cerned. Mythologically, Persephone combines such contradictory attributes that Preller maintains she must be a combination of two originally distinct divinities. As goddess of the underworld she is an ominous representation of death and human ob- livion, while as daughter of Demeter she is a gracious personification of nature's growth and fertility. Homer refers to her only as the frightful queen of the underworld and of death, and, ac- cording to Preller, knows nothing of her relation to Demeter or of her abduction by Hades, both of which appear for the first time in Hesiod. Preller connects Homer's ignorance of the daughter of Demeter with the characteristic absence of mys- tical feeling in the Homeric religion. The origin of this mystical element thus becomes a question of the origin of the myth of the rape of Demeter's daughter. Although there is no record of the story until Homer, Preller does not believe that it is of post- Homeric origin. The religious traditions repre- sented by Homer are those of the Hellenic in- vaders of Greece. They thus became the "national mythology"28 of the Greeks and the model of all subsequent mythological development. But certain religious traditions of the pre-Hellenic inhabitants of Greece survived, leading an underground exis- tence until they could be assimilated into the mythical pattern established by Homer. This was the case with the story of Persephone's rape. Preller's theory explains why Hesiod's version of the story calls the daughter of Demeter by the Homeric name Proserpine, "the destroyer," rather than the more suitable Kore, "the maiden." The theory also explains why the story itself, though older than Homer, received no mythical expression until the post-Homeric period. In contrast with the anthropomorphic and man- centered religion of Homer, the religion of the pre-Hellenes was a religion of the earth, its divini- ties symbolizing the attributes of the earth itself or of the vegetative process. The disappearance and return of Persephone express the seasonal disappearance and return of vegetative life: "In the spring of the year the goddesses are reunited and thus it is Demeter's joy, newly roused and efficacious, and not nature itself, that becomes the cause for the palingenesis of spring."29 Unlike Homer, this religion conceived human life in the closest possible relation to the processes of nature. This difference is particularly apparent in their contrasting conceptions of death. Homer represents death as a condition of nonbeing or at best as an incommensurable loss. But just as the pre-Hellenic nature cult conceived of its gods as both productive and destructive, it represented death and growth as mutually indistinguishable aspects of the same natural process. Preller notes that whereas the Homeric Greeks burned their dead, the general practice in those areas claiming Pelasgian descent was inhumation. Ritual burial was, he argues, common in the earliest times, as evidenced by the practice of the ancient Romans, who followed the injunction of Numa in this re- spect. Inhumation assumes, according to Preller, that "The earth is the mother of man, out of which he originally sprang and to which, when he dies, he must be given back. By being in the earth the dead are hallowed, not merely hallowed but ele- vated to a higher existence ... the origin and the end of man are conceived entirely according to the analogy of vegetative life."30 From this point of view death is not the frightening power that it is in Homer but rather one side of the pro- cess of natural development and growth. Preller concludes that the mystical side of Greek religion has its ultimate origins in such religious concep- tions. Preller's study was an important factor in the development of Pater's work. He may have known it as early as the Winckelmann essay, but the direct influence is naturally strongest in the De- meter essay. My purpose is not to detail Pater's borrowings, but the following passage will illus- trate how thoroughly he had absorbed the thrust of Preller's argument: . . . it is in Hesiod that the two images, unassociated in Homer-the goddess of summer and the goddess of death, Kore and Persephone-are identified with much significance; and that strange, dual being makes her first appearance, whose latent capabilities the poets afterwards developed; among the rest, a peculiar blending of those two contrasted aspects, full of pur- pose for the duly chastened intelligence death, resur- rection, rejuvenescence. (GS, p. 95) I am more interested in the fact that in Marius the Epicurean Pater adopted the religious conceptions</page><page sequence="8">418 History as Palingenesis in Pater and Hegel described by Preller for his most ambitious treat- ment of historical palingenesis. Preller's emphasis on the process by which con- tradictory conceptions of death were reconciled in the early stages of religion undoubtedly excited Pater's Hegelian imagination. In fact, a few pas- sages in Preller's book suggest that Preller himself might have been touched by Hegelian influence. He speaks of death as "a universal principle of nature, in reality, merely the other side of Be- coming-at first of vegetative Becoming, but this soon became the type of Becoming in general."'" Such language recalls Hegel's derivation of the idea of Becoming from the synthesis of Being and Nonbeing (i.e., Negation or "Death"). Preller alludes to Hegel once in a note, but it is by way of rejecting his theoretical scheme of the evolution of Greek religion.32 In general, Preller's affinities are with critical historians like Voss, Lobeck, and Muller, and not with the school of Hegel. Above all, there is nothing in Preller to suggest to Pater the use of the death/rebirth motif of primitive religion as an emblem of the historical process. The imaginative transformation of this material in Marius the Epicurean is entirely Pater's own. The first chapters of Marius describe the earth- centered religion of the Roman countryside and introduce Pater's major symbols. What Pater calls "the religion of Numa" is the Roman equivalent of the chthonic religions of primitive Greece. Preller himself draws this parallel in his Romische Mythologie.33 This work discusses institutions such as the Ambarvalia and the Indigitamenta, which Pater describes in detail, but there are no borrow- ings concrete enough to suggest that Pater knew it. Nevertheless Pater's conception of chthonic religion is derived from Preller. The religion of Marius' childhood is symbolically made up of the oldest and most primitive elements of Roman religion, unadulterated by the polytheistic mythol- ogy of the Greeks. Like the cults described by Preller, it is distinguished by an intense awareness of man's affinity to organic nature and by a sense of the continuing presence of the dead. As represented by Pater, the "religion of Numa" was natural in two senses. The "ground of primi- tive Roman religion" and of "primitive morals" was that reverence for "those elementary condi- tions of life" found among those who cultivate the earth (ME, I, 15). From this reverence spring the various moral motifs sketched in the opening chapters: the sympathy with all living things, the sentiment of maternity, the altar-hearth, symbol of familial piety and the sense of home. But the ''severe and archaic religion of the villa" was natural in another sense as well. Never historically instituted, it grew up, like a product of the earth itself, "in natural harmony with the temper of a quiet people amid the spectacle of rural life." A "tradition of life," a "religion of usages and senti- ment rather than of facts and belief" (ME, i, 4), it expresses its conservative character above all in its sense of the duty owed by the living to the dead: To the dead, in fact, was conceded in such places a somewhat closer neighborhood to the old homes they were thought still to protect, than is usual with us, or was usual in Rome itself-a closeness which the living welcomed. (ME, i, 17) Pater associates another of his images of cultural conservatism with this theme of piety to the dead. The idea of youthful continence, developed in Pater's essay on Hippolytus and his numerous allusions to Spartan ascesis, is, after the symbol- ism of the dead, Pater's most characteristic image for the tendency to resist cultural change.34 The opening chapters of Marius develop these two images and link them by the symbolic use of the color white. The white robes of the youth who walk "in perfect temperance" to celebrate the Roman Ambarvalia echo Marius' vision of the shades of the austere dead: Candidus insuetum miratur limen Olympi Sub pedibusque videt nubes et sidera. (ME, i, 10) The symbolic motifs sketched in the opening chap- ters recur even more prominently in the latter part of the novel but in a significantly different context. Used initially to describe the religion of Numa, they now appear in association with the early Christian church. Pater's most extended treatment of historical transition, Marius the Epicurean, describes a youthful Christianity emerging from the late stages of an older civilization. By insisting on the gradual, almost imperceptible character of this transition, Pater emphasizes its organic character. Roman life had its own anticipations of Christian senti- ment and moral feeling and, on the other hand, Christianity assimilated much of the older civiliza- tion. The discussions of Roman philosophy, litera- ture, and society illustrate this insight critically,</page><page sequence="9">William Shuter 419 but Pater's images and symbols of rebirth render it imaginatively. As experienced by Marius, the distinctive features of Christianity are its reverence for nature and its cult of the dead. Like the religion of Numa, early Christianity was natural in two senses. Among the adherents of the new faith Marius finds a heightened and purified form of the familiar notes of maternal sentiment, sympathy for suffering, chastity, and family piety: Here, surely! in its genial warmth, its jealous exclusion of all that was opposed to it, to its own immediate naturalness, in the hedge set around the sacred thing on every side, this development of the family did but carry forward, and give effect to, the purposes, the kindness, of nature itself. (ME, ii, 110) The appeal of Christianity to Marius is that it is "so close to the truth of nature," the early church being "in truth no alien from that old mother earth" (ME, II, 114, 119). And even more em- phatically than in the case of the religion of Numa, Pater compares the historical emergence of Chris- tianity to an organic process. Explaining that the Christian liturgy absorbed pre-Christian elements, he metaphorically fuses images of death and re- birth with images of natural or organic growth: Ritual, in fact, like all other elements of religion, must grow and cannot be made-grow by the same law of development which prevails everywhere else, in the moral as in the physical world....."Wisdom" was dealing, as with the dust of creeds and philosophies, so also with the dust of outworn religious usage, like the very spirit of life itself, organizing soul and body out of the lime and clay of the earth. (ME, ii, 126) The house of the matron Cecilia, converted into a Christian church, is of central importance here. A visual symbol to Marius of the Christian spirit, it consisted "almost exclusively of the remains of older art ... arranged and harmonized": It was the old way of true Renaissance-being indeed the way of nature with her roses, the divine way with the body of man, perhaps with his soul-conceiving the new organism by no sudden and abrupt creation, but rather by the action of a new principle upon ele- ments, all of which had in truth already lived and died many times. (ME, ii, 95-96) On the one hand the natural product of cultural growth, the house of Cecilia was, on the other, a mausoleum. Marius' first impression of the church in Cecilia's home is that it is a "schola or common hall of one of those burial guilds, which then covered so much of the unofficial, and, as it might be called, subterranean enterprise of Roman so- ciety" (ME, II, 109). "Looking, literally, for the dead among the living," he notes that the family sepulcher has been brought into "immediate con- nexion with the abode of the living" (ME, II, 98). The mass itself, celebrated on an "altar tomb" (ME, II, 100), seems to Marius "from first to last, a commemoration of the dead" (ME, II, 136). Pater observes that in thus adopting the cultus of the dead the early Christians were in fact only reviving a more primitive mode of religious feeling: That "anyone may, at his own election, constitute the place which belongs to him a religious place, by the carrying of his dead into it":-had been a maxim of old Roman law, which it was reserved for the early Christian societies . . . to realize in all its conse- quences. (ME, ii, 98) Particularly striking is the fact that the Christians "from some peculiar feeling of hope they enter- tained concerning the body" had abandoned the practice of cremation and returned to the "older fashion" of inhumation (ME, II, 99, 100). This theme becomes more insistent as Marius nears the end of his life, his peculiar relation to his own dead forming the symbolic climax of the book. Feeling himself drawn more and more closely to the Christian community, Marius is overtaken by a sudden impulse, vague but irresistible, to return to his ancestral home. His motive becomes clearer to him as he journeys "dreaming now only of the dead before him. At last amid all his distractions, they were become the main purpose of what he was then doing" (ME, II, 204). Recognizing that no natural descendant of his would carry on the traditional family pieties, Marius resolves on the form of his final service to the dead. In a cere- monial act, "like a renewal of lengthy old burial rites" (ME, II, 207), he buries the tomb of his fathers beneath the earth. Immediately thereafter, he is visited by his Christian friend Cornelius, for whom he feels with new intensity the affection of a father for his son: . . . "more than brother !"-he felt-"like a son also !" contrasting the fatigue of soul which made himself in effect an older man, with the irrepressible youth of his companion. For it was still the marvellous hope- fulness of Cornelius, his seeming prerogative over the future, that determined, and kept alive, all other senti- ment concerning him. (ME, ii, 209)</page><page sequence="10">420 History as Palingenesis in Pater and Hegel In this episode Pater takes up the primitive con- ception of nature's rebirth and the idea of Chris- tian resurrection and transmutes them into a richly ambiguous symbol for his vision of cultural change. Only Hegel's language of aufheben can do justice to Pater's meaning here.35 The interment of Marius' family memorial signifies the end of an inherited religious tradition but an end that is somehow also a survival. As the religion of the future, Christianity is represented as a new syn- thesis, taking up and preserving elements far older than itself. The process of history is thus an ex- tension of the process of nature, destroying old forms for the sake of new, yet conserving what is annulled. The rebirth imagery of Marius the Epi- curean is Pater's most successful attempt to cap- ture imaginatively what Hegel implied when he spoke of "the genuine Phoenix life of the Spirit."36 Eastern Michigan University Ypsilanti Notes ' "Walter Pater und Hegel," Englische Studien, 50 (1916), 300 ff. 2 For the recollections of Capes, Bywater, and Lionel Johnson, see Germain d'Hangest, Walter Pater, l'homme et l'?uvre (Paris: Didier, 1961), i, 54, and Anthony Ward, Walter Pater: The Idea in Nature (London: Margibbon &amp; Kee, 1966), pp. 25-26.

It deserves quotation because it employs Hegel's formal definition of art as the sensuous representation of the Idea, what Hegel calls the Ideal: " 'Ideal' is one of those terms which through a pre- tended culture have become tarnished and edgeless. How great, then, is the charm when in Hegel's writings we find it attached to a fresh, clear-cut apprehension! With him the ideal is a Versinnlichen of the idea-the idea turned into an object of the sense. By the idea, stripped of its technical phraseology, he means man's knowledge about himself and his relation to the world, in its most recti- fied and concentrated form. This, then, is what we have to ask about a work of art-Did it, at the age in which it was produced, express in terms of sense, did it present to the eye or ear, man's knowledge about himself and his relation to the world in its most rectified and concentrated form ?"

Press, 1967). The whole issue of Pater's conception of Greek myth deserves further investigation in the light of his indebtedness to the mythological scholarship of his time. James Kissane, "Victorian Mythology," VS, 6 (1962), 5 ff., has opened the question, but I am convinced that he under- estimates the extent of Pater's scholarly reading (see n. 27). All I can suggest here is that Pater was less interested in opposing one god against another than he was in those contradictory mythical conceptions of the same god which he discovered in his scholarly sources, e.g., the Delphic and the Hyperborean Apollo; Dionysus, god of the vine, and Dionysus Zagreus. Compare the discussion of Kore- Persephone below and the "two-sided" Artemis of "Hippol- ytus Veiled" (GS, pp. 170-71). 23 "Winckelmann."

Preller, however, is only one of the scholars to whom Pater is indebted in the Demeter essays. I will examine Pater's scholarly debts more fully in another article. 27 In addition to Preller, Pater cites Karl Otfried Muller's Die Dorier (P&amp;P, p. 200) and K. F.
