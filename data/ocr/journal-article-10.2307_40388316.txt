Marilin Calo, Lucas Pereyra Domingorena, Andrés D. Izeta and Marisa Lazzari Abstract This article focuses on the architectural characteristics of a household compound in Cardonal, an early agricultural village located in the southern Cajón Valley (Catamarca, north-western Argentina) dated to the first centuries AD. When architecture, as landscape, is understood as the result of the daily tasks of living, the research carried out in Cardonal gives substance to the ways in which the materiality of everyday life forged the building of this prehistoric village. Cardonal is an example of how houses and architecture are not static but fluidly changing with the contingencies of life.

Houses as histories of dwelling When landscapes are thought of as the result of the everyday tasks of dwelling, the entanglement of people and places through the trajectories of humans and non-humans alike (Ingold 1993, 2000), the analysis of architectural spaces requires a perspective that sees them as growing out of practice rather than as static forms (McFadyen 2008; Richards 1993: 149). Buildings - as landscapes themselves - become the evidence of situated practices that transcend the limits of constructed spaces in their multiple references to other places, times, peoples and tasks. From this perspective, the space of the house can be RRoutledge World Archaeology Vol. 41(3): 396-414 The Archaeology of Buildings Tayior&amp;Franciscroup © 2009 Taylor &amp; Francis ISSN 0043-8243 print/1470-1375 online DOI: 10.1080/00438240903112310</page><page sequence="2">Built landscapes of everyday life 397 understood as a historicized field forged by people-object relationships and by the operations that become substantiated in the course of such interactions. This lived space is animated by the intersection of movements, actions, dispositions and materialities (Bachelard 1992 [1965]; Cooney 2000; de Certeau 2000; Meskell 2004; Miller 2001; Tringham 1995). In this way, the house is a medium of communication (Blanton 1994: 10) affording a material framework in which everyday interactions and other less quotidian tasks become structured. Core to this approach is the idea that a particular classificatory system, that continuously instils and reinforces values and social meanings, is made tangible in the shape of the house, its internal sectors, spaces and arrangements (Bourdieu 2000 [1972]). In this action, meaning is being simultaneously created, interiorized and exteriorized. The archaeological study of architecture in north-western Argentina has traditionally been centred on descriptions, taking materials and shape as the fundamental evidence in the explanation of change and variability between periods. From this perspective, architecture is generally understood as emerging in one moment of time and not as the result of the daily tasks of living. In north-western Argentina's valley areas, Formative period (c. 1500 BC-AD 600) architecture - to which we will refer later in this article - is usually defined by the presence of sparse villages surrounded by their field crops, corrals and simple irrigation systems. In such descriptions, the construction pattern is thought of as being directly linked or adapted to a particular mode of subsistence. In other words, houses were built in proximity to the places where staples were produced, that is, in areas that were favourable for raising specific crops aided by simple irrigation systems. Access to pastures to feed domesticated camelid species was also an important factor in the placement of these early villages. In close relation to this, there has been a tendency to interpret location, general pattern and modification of these early villages and houses as directly connected to the transformations that occurred in the sphere of subsistence production. By contrast, we depart from the idea that buildings grow determined by any productive patterns considered in isolation in favour of the idea that they grow by the multiple contingencies that everyday life entails. The structures that we study are thus not static but fluid, changing as life unfolds. From this perspective, the particular configuration of the ancient villages that is the focus of our research is the result of several minute, intermittent, endless acts of construction, use, maintenance and renovation of houses and paths. Through the building, modification and attachment of new structures, the repairing of roofs, walls and floors, each village encloses its own history, that of the peoples who have dwelt in it. Importantly, the evidence of these actions is not only manifest in the settlement pattern - as defined by any particular subsistence strategy - but is also present in other less obvious but equally persistent vestiges of everyday tasks: moving stones one by one to better accommodate the fireplace, pointing the wall with mortar in place of the fallen stones, reshaping little by little the bends of the paths as one walks in and out of the houses and so on. All these are traces of life itself, of the actions of dwelling imprinted in the materiality of the house. Consequently, this article centres on the architectural traits of household construction at the site of Cardonal in north-western Argentina, highlighting the embeddedness of architecture and everyday tasks. Standing architecture, material objects and</page><page sequence="3">398 María Cristina Scattolin et al. archaeological features afford multiple references to the different activities performed by the inhabitants of this Early Formative house and provide evidence for the everyday life of this community in the pre-Hispanic past. The village and its surroundings Cardonal is situated in the southern part of the Cajón valley, Southern Andes (Fig. 1). Located along a shallow terrace at 3000 metres above sea level, it occupies a privileged place on a natural route that connects the territories of Puna and Yungas. Altogether, the Puna (dry highlands), the valleys (arid valleys and sierra) and the Yungas (the rainforests on the eastern slope of the Andes) constitute the particular geographical configuration of north-western Argentina that is traditionally thought to have been of fundamental importance during pre-Hispanic times. Indeed, there is an important amount of evidence that documents the extensive circulation of exotic goods and staples between communities settled in the Pacific coast of northern Chile, the Puna, valleys and eastern forests in north- western Argentina since very ancient times (Albeck 1994; Lazzari 2005; Nuñez and Dillehay 1995). The Cajón valley expands parallel to the renowned Santa Maria valley, region of numerous surveys and archaeological excavations since the beginnings of the twentieth century. Exhaustive archaeological household research in the southern part of this valley began at the site of Yutopián (Gero and Scattolin 2002; Scattolin and Gero 1999). Those excavations exposed the lifestyle and technological complexity of the first farming societies as remarkably well-preserved material evidence was uncovered. Over the last few years, archaeological household investigations have concentrated on the site of Cardonal in Figure 1 Map of north-western Argentina showing the location of the site of Cardonal.</page><page sequence="4">Built landscapes of everyday life 399 La Quebrada locality, only 10km from Yutopián. In the vicinity of Cardonal at least five other residential sites have been detected. Notably among these, the village of Bordo Marcial expands parallel to Cardonal displaying striking similarities in the placing of dwelling structures and tombs, which afford a particular sense of symmetry between both villages (Plate 1). Dated to cal. AD 70-220 (Scattolin et al. 2007a), the village of Cardonal is one remarkable example of the first sedentary agricultural communities during what has traditionally been labelled the 'Formative period' in the social development of north- western Argentina. This period (c. 1500 BC-AD 600) has been described as a time of segmentary groups with little social hierarchy, mixed economy subsistence systems based on agriculture, hunting and herding and a dispersed settlement pattern of sparse architectural units (Olivera 2001; Scattolin 2006; Tarrago 1992). Although mostly self- sufficient, these communities were also involved in dynamic social interactions oriented towards the distribution and exchange of local products on a regional scale. Many settlements of this period have been studied, indicating that houses were usually made of stone and other less perdurable materials including adobe walls and thatched roofs combining both circular and square plans in a variety of sizes and forms (Scattolin 2006), many enclosing sepulchres in the house floors as well. By the end of this period, between AD 600 and 1000, evidence of Tiwanaku expansion reach southern Bolivia and possibly also north-western Argentina (González 1998). Villages continue to follow a dispersed pattern, but are slightly denser. The building of ceremonial or non-domestic structures continues during these later centuries, but they become larger and made up of multiple rooms (Gordillo 2009). In the subsequent Late period (c. AD 1000-1436) highly hierarchical societies maintained clear-cut territorial boundaries through the political control of other ecological areas, agglomerated settlements and warfare.

Notice the symmetrical layout of both villages.</page><page sequence="5">400 María Cristina Scattolin et al. structures in this period is evidence of larger numbers of people inhabiting these villages while their defensive localization is manifest in the placement of fortresses or 'pukaras' on hilltops (Nielsen 1996; Tarrago 2000). Afterwards, north-western Argentina became part of the Inka Empire for a short period of time until the arrival of the Spanish conquerors. Inka architecture followed a very distinctive pattern that was transferred to the conquered areas as one form of control and domination (Cremonte and Williams 2007). In this article we shall discuss the particularities of house construction at Cardonal as seen from the perspective of dwelling. Ongoing archaeological research at this site has brought to the fore a network of relationships between objects, people and places that transcend the limits of the Cajón Valley to connect, directly or indirectly, with other places and peoples, reinforcing the idea of shared 'ways of doing' between the Cajón Valley and surrounding ecological areas (Gero 2004; Scattolin et al. 2007a, 2007b). Taken in isolation, distinct architectural features present in Cardonal are also found in villages of the fertile eastern Tafi Valley, yet local ways of building and doing reinforce the historical uniqueness of this village, shaped by the experiences of those who inhabited the place in their engagement with the surrounding landscape. At the same time, the presence of the Vaquerías ceramic style from the San Francisco Valley and lowland eastern areas, as well as obsidians from the Puna, strongly points to the relevance of this site within specific systems, networks and routes of interaction during the time period here considered. Elsewhere, we have discussed some of these issues at length (Scattolin et al. forthcoming), but, for the purpose of this article, it is important to highlight that so far the results sustain a complex image of the Formative period, of communities that created their own meaningful world from other materialities and worlds (in the sense of Goodman 1990; see also Lazzari 2006). Building as living the house Cardonal extends 400m in an east-west direction on a plateau formation surrounded by two small streams that remain dry for most of the year. The vast majority of the built structures at Cardonal present a good state of preservation. Approximately 100 stone enclosures of circular or sub-circular shape of various diameters are disposed in groups of variable density which constituted household compounds (Fig. 2). These compounds (or patio groups) are generally composed of several circular or sub-circular rooms attached to one another in no particular or recurrent pattern. Each compound is separated from the other by a distance of a few meters and they group together in small clusters or 'sectors'. The rooms vary in size between approximately 2 and 6 meters in diameter. Some of these appear to have been open courts. Distributed along the terrain other structures of larger dimensions are found, possibly designed or used for herding or agricultural purposes. Large quantities of lithic and ceramic fragmentary material can be found lying on the site surface as well as an unusually high number of grinding stones. The site also includes a cemetery area in the north flank of the village detached from the dwelling structures by a small dry gully. There is also one tomb located in a very prominent space in the highest part of the plateau. Another cemetery, located in a sand</page><page sequence="6">Built landscapes of everyday life 401 Figure 2 Plan of the village of Cardonal and photograph of Compound 1 . dune to the eastern extreme of the village, is particularly evident as its whitish colour contrasts vividly with the surrounding landscape (see Plate 1). Throughout the last five years, the complete excavation of one household compound, Compound 1 (Cl) composed by five adjacent stone structures (Rl, R2, R3, R4, R5)1 of circular or sub-circular shape, has provided essential information about the daily practices of the peoples that inhabited the village (Fig. 3). During this research, the focus was placed on the compound's history of building. However, when architecture is understood as emerging out of daily practices and tasks, the identification of an initial moment in the construction of the house becomes blurred by the fluidity of daily events. The current appearance of Cl suggests that each of the structures was constructed by excavating the bedrock in order that the internal floor of the house was lower than the outside surface, creating semi-subterranean spaces. Afterwards, wall construction involved another two stages. First, large stones were placed and secured on the ground, and then smaller rocks were placed in between them, thus completing the shaping of the structure. Walls were built using locally available stones (granite migmatite) set out in single rows lightly inclined towards the interior of the house and secured by stone wedges (Plate 2a below). Many of these wedges are in fact polished instruments (mostly grinding handstones (manos)); other farming instruments such as large passive grinding stones (conanas) were also reused as materials for building up the walls or as jambs, framing the entrances in an upright position (Plate 2a). In a similar manner, quern stones were involved in multiple and successive purposes. Such practice gives substance to the idea of fluidity in this house, where objects directly involved with daily tasks (milling) were later reused in wall construction and, in this sense, continued their biographies as significant objects.</page><page sequence="7">402 María Cristina Scattolin et al. Figure 3 Plan of Cardonal Compound I (below) and hypothetical reconstruction of Compound 1 (above). Above the stone rows, adobe walls probably continued up to the roof which was supported by one or more wooden posts. Of these, only post-holes remain. Some of the post-holes are simple rounded pits carved in the bedrock while others are still surrounded by small polished-stone wedges (Plate 2d). Another characteristic of this type of structure is the presence of circular pits carved in the bedrock; some of these were empty but others contained fine-grained whitish sediment or polished rocks (Plate 2b and 2c). As for the general layout and organization of the household, the disposition of each of the structures has shown that three out of the five rooms (Rl, R2 and R4) were probably intended to be more private, not having any direct communication with the exterior as access to them is restricted to the entrance of R3. R3 communicates with R5 through a small portal connecting both structures both in-between and with the exterior. This shared space between R3 and R5 is the only entrance to Cl. Accounting for the dimensions of each structure and the localization and number of post-holes, it is likely that three of the rooms were fully roofed (Rl, R2 and R4) while R3 and R5 appear to have been partially roofed, highly transited spaces or patios.</page><page sequence="8">Built landscapes of everyday life 403 Plate 2 Architectural features of Compound 1 : a) grinding stone used as jamb, stone wedges and excavated bedrock; b) pit carved in the bedrock containing polished stones; c) hearth and carved pit filled with fine white sediment; d) post-hole surrounded by polished-stone wedges. Another interesting aspect of this house is that some natural features of the terrain were sized to afford a specific ordering and circulation through its internal spaces. For example, the entrance to R2 from R3 is marked by a natural slope in the bedrock which descends towards the centre of the room, highlighting the submerged quality of the structure's interiors. The experience of transiting over uneven surfaces as one moves between rooms is also enhanced by the presence of stone-block steps (for example, at the entrance of R5; see Plate 6 below). Inside R5, a row of stones secured by several rounded and polished wedges was built parallel to the wall, copying its rounded form, in what appears to have been a type of 'bench'. The space between the bench and the wall was filled up with refuse sediment containing small fragments of ceramic, lithic and bone as well as one conana. An earlier configuration of this structure was apparently reshaped by the construction of this trait, as its complete removal exposed an older post-hole beneath. Similar features can still be found today in some local houses (Plate 4a). Indeed, observing present-day architecture in La Quebrada locality can be very useful in terms of getting to know the particularities</page><page sequence="9">404 María Cristina Scattolin et al. afforded by materials such as stone and adobe when used to build houses and compounds (Plates 3, 4 and 5). Building while living implies that inside each of the rooms people were engaged in everyday activities and tasks. Next, objects and features reveal the architecture of Cardonal as a lived space. Objects, spaces and tasks The activities that took place inside the different 'rooms' of this house generated a wave of connections between people and things, defining sectors by the movement of the body and objects engaged in different tasks. It is in the transit from one space to the other, in choosing particular spaces to perform a specific task and the distribution of objects in different sectors that the internal configuration of the house is given form. Milling activities, for example, were developed in different sectors within the house. Due to their large size and heaviness, stone pecanas and conanas (passive grinding stones) become important elements in the organization of the internal space of the house. This type of instrument is found within four out of the five structures of Cl, exhibiting different degrees of wear, some in their use position while others appear to have been discarded or Plate 3 Two modern households composed by several rectangular rooms: a) a semi-subterranean compound; b) an above-ground patio group.</page><page sequence="10">Built landscapes of everyday life 405 Plate 4 Architectural features of present-day construction at La Quebrada: a) stone 'bench'; b) walls. not to have been in use when the house was abandoned (Plate 6b). For example, conanas and pecanas are distributed all over R3. One conana broken in half was found next to a circular pit excavated on the bedrock. Another three conanas, one of them in an upside- down position and perforated by intense use, were found next to the aperture that connects this structure with Rl. By contrast, milling artefacts were concentrated in a delimited sector of Rl. One large conana, as well as one flat pecana of smaller size, was found in this room as well as eight manos in direct association with these. The conana was lying on top of three manos and other small stones that acted as wedges. This particular way of securing passive milling artefacts has also been identified in other archaeological and ethnographic contexts of north-western Argentina (Babot 2007). In addition to such objects being involved in the processing of vegetables and other resources, a large globular jar with soot remains and signs of deterioration typical of the exposure to the fire, a big red slip bottle and a small globular jar were also found. Noticeably, Rl stands out from the rest of the rooms as this is entirely covered by soot and evidences of combustion (see below).</page><page sequence="11">406 María Cristina Scattolin et al. Plate 5 Modern house: a) exterior; b) interior. Inside R5, a pecana, a small mortero and a pilón (all milling instruments) together with an anthropomorphic vessel were found in direct association with traces of activities involving fire and combustion, although these occur in a more restricted area than Rl. All these are evidence of this room being used for activities related to the processing and cooking of food. By contrast, on the floor of R2 there were no passive grinding stones. However this structure is characterized by the large number of manos lying on the floor (see Plate 8a below), as well as two hands placed next to a small polished stone and kept inside a hole in the wall. This room is where the greatest variety of artefacts and objects was found. Cooking pots, storage jars and other ceramic recipients and vessels are present all over the house (Plate 7), yet, due to their occurrence in different proportions within each room, R2 was probably used for storing diverse receptacles as well as instruments. Among these were two large jars probably used for cooking or storage as well as other vessels with finer finishing such as one polished jar, a small effigy vessel possibly representing an armadillo or 'quirquincho'' {Chaetophractus vellerosus), a polished bowl and another globular vessel. Moreover, inside R2, several mud fragments with imprints of coiled basketry bases were found (Plate 8b and 8c). Two of the baskets which had been placed on top of these plastic surfaces were at least 40cm in diameter and show signs of having been mended. Another one was smaller but of a finer, more compact weave (Calo 2008). Imprints of a possible</page><page sequence="12">Built landscapes of everyday life 407 Plate 6 a) Portal; b) conanas found inside Cl. rough blanket or mat were also found, illustrating the diversity of weaving techniques and materials used in this house. In this sense, the distribution of objects inside the house allows the interpretation that certain places were differentially used for specific tasks. As for activities involving fire and combustion, these were localized in various sectors within the house yet showed different degrees of structuring. As mentioned above, evidence of fire and charred vegetable and bones were evident in some areas within R5, but these occur in a dispersed manner, without involving any structured or formal feature. Within R5 there is a dark, greasy- sediment area and a pit excavated in the bedrock surrounded by a ring of baked daub. Remains of chañar (Geoffroea decorticans), carbonized beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) and camelid bones as well as fragments of an anthropomorphic vessel were also found. Yet, it is in Rl where the presence of a well-preserved hearth of a type previously seen in Yutopián (Gero and Scattolin 2002; Scattolin and Gero 1999), consisting of three round stones linked by annular ring of baked clay (Plate 2c), speaks of formal activities of cooking and heating being preferably done in this room. The hearth, together with other evidence such as the presence of charred plants (including beans and firewood) and the</page><page sequence="13">408 María Cristina Scattolin et al. Plate 7 Ceramic vessels from Cl. abundance of a greasy black sediment covering the entire room as well as soot adhered to the stone walls is characteristic of those spaces in which cooking takes place habitually. Nonetheless, although the evidence found in Rl immediately evokes the idea of a 'kitchen', the presence of a modelled and painted ceramic pipe next to the hearth calls attention to other types of activities, such as inhaling of hallucinogenic substances,2 probably performed inside this room. By the same token, the 'kitchen' is not the exclusive space dedicated to food processing. R5 might have been as well, at least for a time, a place for food processing as indicated by the large quantities of animal bones, charcoal fragments, charred vegetables and milling instruments. In this sense, although from the distribution of objects and refuse within the house it is possible to detect some areas where specific tasks appear to have been prioritized, the spaces show that a multiplicity of activities involving people and objects were developed simultaneously and not exclusively within each of the rooms. Certain tasks carried out inside</page><page sequence="14">Built landscapes of everyday life 409 Plate 8 a) Grinding stones; b and c) basket imprints. the house were done in a highly structured manner, leaving distinct and unmovable traces (e.g. the hearth), while others are distinguishable only by the dispersed presence and disposition of objects in the rooms. The house appears segmented into distinct spaces but, as we have seen, this does not necessarily mean that practices were equally segmented. Indeed, such spatial organization of practices forbids any simple or direct application of functional universal categories. By contrast, the materiality of this house forces us to think in terms of more open or fluid categories, in spaces where diverse tasks and experiences were combined. Final remarks This article has grown from the idea that houses as landscapes are built while being dwelt in (Ingold 1993, 2000; Richards 1993; McFadyen 2008). Far from being the manifestation of a preconceived idea of the architectural object, the house of Cardonal is, by turn, the materialization of an entanglement of people and things interacting through time. In this sense, multiple temporalities are present in the very materiality of this house. They are inscribed in the conjunction of repetitive and novel activities renewed and fluid through</page><page sequence="15">410 María Cristina Scattolin et al. time: grinding, storing, cooking, reshaping walls, relocating post-holes and other features. The practices of dwelling thus created the architecture of these lived spaces while continually recreating them. Our understanding of this house is then opposed to the idea of an unmovable order of things (in the sense of de Certeau and Giard 1998: 148). Cardonal Cl is made of parts of the landscape brought together by people as they are engaged in their daily tasks. One of the fundamental activities that sustained the first agrarian villages, grinding plants and seeds, was actually present in the architecture of their homes. The small polished manos used as wedges or the large worn-out conanas framing doors and building walls are material references to the imbricate nature of architecture and tasks in the early village of Cardonal. In this sense, as milling transforms rocks into grinding stones, dwelling transforms landscape into homes.
