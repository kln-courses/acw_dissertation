Sigerist VOLUME VII APRIL, 1939 NUMBER 4 SELF-PORTRAIT OF FIELDING H. GARRISON Autobiographical Excerpts Compiled From His Letters * F. L. TIETSCH " Our photographers are laboring on my mug at the museum, with hut poor success so far, as I am the aboriginal camera-smasher . My eye-strain always comes out in any full face picture, giving such an unpleasant cast to the thing that I have scrapped every negative . They are trying for a profile, but I don't anticipate much." (Fielding H. Garrison in a letter to H. L. Mencken). I was born in 1870, in what astrologers describe as thei sad Tristan- Tristram Shandy month, November, and on the 5th, described by Hesiod as " the unkindly and terrible day on which the Furies assisted at the birth of Orcus," Gott des Todes. It is plain that those born on that day (Guy Fawkes' day) are fated to suffer from in- ward hell-fire and brimstone all their lives and go to hell, am Ende. * Note of the Editor. As a result of my appeal in Vol. V, p. 947 of this Bulletin, the Institute received about 5000 letters of Fielding H. Garrison, and Mr. F. L. Tietsch has been working on them ever since. Now that the fourth anniversary of Garrison's death is approaching, we found it appropriate to publish this masterly S elf -Portrait that Mr. Tietsch has compiled from various letters. Every word in it is Garrison's owa I think this sketch demonstrates better than anything else what a wealth of most valuable information the letters contaia And at the same time it gives the reader an idea of the kind of book that Mr. Tietsch is preparing. 365</page><page sequence="2">366 F. L. TIETSCH But, in the sainted Schiller's phrase, I would fain not go " klanglos zum Orkus herab." In the devastating summers of Washington, D. C, my father and mother took us children to his garden regularly, and the effect upon our morals was, in the Satanic phrase of Berlioz " not sufficient to corrupt even the population of a bed-room ten feet square." It was a highly respectable " Komm' zum Garten, zu dem wohlbekannten " sort of place, with Ńussbaum and Kapelle, not unlike some I saw in the Taunus valley, only on a smaller scale. My father studied Ger- man at Carlisle under a Dr. Holzhäuser, was always talking about him as a great influence in his life, had me take German instead of Latin at the Washington High School as the most powerful weapon I could acquire in my education, and took me to the Beethoven Sym- phonies (Theodore Thomas), Fliegender Holländer, Lohengrin, when I was a small shaver in knickerbockers. My music-master breakfasted with us regularly whenever he came to give a lesson, but he rushed me into playing " pieces " when I was scarcely out of Czerny 's Geläufigkeit, so I have never been able to slough off the re- mains of a faulty method, even under W,aldecker, a sound teacher, who used to swear at me like a Feldwebel, when I didn't count the measure - my first experience with military discipline. My show- piece as a kid was the Marche du sacre from Meyerbeer's Prophète, and I have weird recollections of such effeminate, wishy-washy stuff as the Maiden's Prayer, Monastery Bells, The Lancers, The Racquet Gallop, Mocking Bird and " Der Sennerin Abschied von der Alm." How I envy the Spanish pupils at the Madrid and Barcelona con- servatories, who begin on Bach and stay with Bach for the rest of their lives, as the great finger-strengthēner and brain-developer (Billroth's verdict). Through my mother, who, although her ancestors fought in the Revolution, was in many respects a French woman to her fingertips, I have what I conceive to be a French mind which sees things as they are and believes nothing it does not factually know. I fancy even my literary manner goes to show that I am, mentally at least, a French- man. For that reason, I have been a very lonely inhabitant of these U. S. A. - even my humble attempts to state what I know, as briefly and clearly as possible, have been thrown up against me as a kind of</page><page sequence="3">SELF-PORTRAIT OF FIELDING H. GARRISON 367 Gamaliel complex. Through my father I have indubitable Scotch traits, otherwise my character is plain old U. S. A., I am a good Tory, believe in a strong Federal Government and hate solemn non- sense. I am rather stubborn and obstinate if anyone crosses me, and apt to go my own way if it suits me. Those who call me an idealist simply mean that the only thing of any slightest importance about me is my mind, and that was developed, not by any book-learning or study, but by intense suffering, particularly in connection with my father's lingering and painful death, which occupied three years. I began to write papers during those long nights to keep from going crazy, and I have continued to do so, simply to keep alive, mentally speaking, and not become entirely submerged in this bibliographical drudgery which puts out eyes and bores holes into the brain. In con- sidering me, I wish people would disregard this miserable husk which is my body and simply see me in the above light. I have a very sen- sitive nervous system, and aim to hide like Asian monarchs from people who get on my nerves, as experience has taught me to be afraid of my Latin passions - the heautontimorumenos complex. A Latin, e. g. a South American, when he gets mad, is " effective in invective," but otherwise as helpless as a chicken minus its head - as I see it. Hence I only trust the stone-cold Scotch side. Those who really know me and respect me, know that my whole life has been spent in taking care of and doing things for other people, and it is perhaps natural that I should feel incensed at either mental or moral obliquity. Still, there have been times in my life when I have shown " some divil." That's what delights me so much on renewing acquaintance with Wagner - das Dämonische! I be- lieve I am pro-Nietzsche in re all that relates to artistic values and contra-Nietzsche in re all that relates to " the greatest good of the greatest number." Nietzsche must be the essential credo of all who practice music, painting, warfare and statecraft as callings of high emprise, but for a doctor! - he queers his own game if he is not Benthamite to the core. Having a very passionate heart, with a molto vibrato attachment, I suppose I took the war too seriously. Of course, there will be more scrapping - the mere map of Europe shows that, what will come out of it is beyond my ken. Personally, I would like to have lived from</page><page sequence="4">368 F. L. TIETSCH 1810 to 1900. The stress of the war, the unspeakable vulgarity of recent life and the overwhelming of the world by so many false values and faker people has been too much for those brought up in a different society, when life moved along moderato molto spianato - a very restful tempo withal. The drab, reticent note in Brahms pleases me like " airs from home." It is essentially the note of the Gentleman and the Aristokrat des Geistes. I believe, with the Army Regulations, that even the greenest en- listed man or humblest mechanic is to be treated so " as to preserve his self-respect " even when bawled out. The beautiful American trait of essential frankness (where so much in our " civilization " is unbeautiful) should be combined with the other trait of a considerate attitude, which made Napoleon say " Respect the burden," re those who work for us. I am a bitter and determined enemy of the plebeian type of joshing which passes as American humor. Nietzsche's pic- ture of Emerson is my idea of a first-class American, easy-going, and not like the hide-bound fanatics of today, who, as Bob Ingersoll said, " would bottle up the fresh air " and charge you for it, if they had half a chance. I have known people of the finest lineage who were stupid as logs and evoluted peasants who were honors to great nations. I have also found that truly " God-fearing " people are reliable, not liable to desecrate anything, whereas the trouble with most is that the God of their worship is merely themselves, raised to the nth power. From such conceit came prohibition as a salto mortale, and all the other stupidities and ineptitudes that wreck nations and destroy societies. I am not anthropomorphic myself, hence, not religious in the ordi- nary, accepted sense of the term, but rather Oliver Goldsmith's easy- going " Good-natured Man," who has had his leg pulled by life in all directions and so finds that " the vanity of our existence " is only equalled by the " folly of our pursuits." What has appalled me in life is, not that there is any special harm in religion or algebra or sentimental romance, etc. but the devastating effect of almost any elementary line of thought in spoiling other people's lives, e. g. re- ligious wars, calumny from pseudo-pietistic egoism, blackmail, in- trigue and other traits of the human animal that make a leaping Bengal tiger seem highly respectable. As far as I know, I have not</page><page sequence="5">SELF-PORTRAIT OF FIELDING H. GARRISON 369 published an acrid line in my life. In reviewing books, I have punc- tured a number of wind-bags of verbiage and irresponsible thinking on occasion, and, accepting the omen, shall probably go on puncturing them, if occasion arises; but the personality of living medical men does not concern me, as human nature is pretty much the same every- where and we are none of us perfect. Since the war, I have lived, highly sociable by nature and sur- rounded by people, the life of a very lonely man, marooned on a desert island. Not that I propose myself as an example, au contraire, but I do appreciate occasional contact with people who speak my language, so to say. Amiel said of the typical American that he con- fuses and confounds " expansion of being - with happiness," in other words, mistakes that sort of thing for real activity of mind and heart. The Europeans had all that kind of nonsense taken out of them long ago, but since the war there has been ever so much more fuss and feathers about alleged national greatness and self-determi- nation all over Europe than in the good old days before the war. I have a certain sympathy with cultivated Europeans who don't know what to do with themselves in this country, as I am in the same fix myself sometimes. Even the few months I was in Germany, one or two nice people came forward and did a few things to make life more pleasant, recognizing me, I suppose, for what I am. It is only once in a very long while, longo intervallo indeed, that I meet anyone with whom conversation is a fine art, and he or she usually a cultivated European. Never has there been less respect for intellect, cultivation, le bon goût, the fine side of life, delicacy or rudimentary decency of consideration for others than now, and where this exists, it is usually the émigrés, the Italian fruiterer or barber, the Yiddish tailor or Delicatessen handler, the whole foreign layout of minor in- dustrials, who turn out to be the gentler people by comparison with the so-called " intellectual " class, many of whom are given over to silly Billy solemn nonsense, under the delusion that it makes them seem boyish and keeps them young. I figure, somehow, that the plain people who feed, clothe and otherwise take care of us, have im- proved very noticeably and sensibly in external manners, while the intellectuals have roughened and coarsened relatively. I have found a good deal of rough-neck outlawry in the medico-</page><page sequence="6">370 F. L. TIETSCH historical people, who ought to stand, if anything, for the ennobling of the human spirit and the Athenian ambition to " make gentle the life of the world." If there is so much of this in our particular ter- rain, what of other, more strenuous domains of intellectual activity? I hope I am wrong, but my impression is that, ofttimes, the wrong sort of people are following such delicate callings as praxis and other branches of medicine, especially in this post-bellum period. I propose some day to write out and publish my experiences with the rough- neck species of doctors who make the tenets of the Hippocratic Oath seem like a cannabis indica dream, portrayed by a lunatic or any given moron. In a nearly 45 years grind of bibliography and library work, what little I have been able to accomplish has seemed like the rings which children snatch in the whirl of a merry-go-round and nothing I have written has ever been satisfactory to me. I merely regard it as the kick which keeps the mind alive while delving, like the Chinese quick- silver miners, who seldom see the real light of common day, but at least, know its value. After all, brain workers simply work de jour en jour to keep active minds employed with suitable head-work, and here Osier's " Take no thought of the morrow " would seem the part of wisdom. I am afraid that a yawning gulf of oblivion, like the maw of the Papuan crocodile swallowing a man-sized man, awaits much of present day activities anyhow. The only importance I attach to my own stuff is : how far does it show accuracy of perception and really interpretative coup ďoeil ? The rest of medical or any other kind of history seems to me mere mechanical assemblage of facts and dates or of incoordinated material, which does not function " an und für sich " - the " ruda congestaque moles " of the Latin poet. I may be right or I may be wrong, but I admire the 18th Century pragmatists in their attempt to indicate definite objectives and directives, and as Lord Bacon observed, " it is easier to evolve truth from error than from confusion." I have a vast organ of books to play on, with keys and stops no end, but drudgery and maddening distractions make the whole damned business " hell a mile " and not worth the candle. The con- cept "librarian" is somewat anomalous, evanescent, iridescent, and chameleon-like, if one considers the bizarre array of disparate talents</page><page sequence="7">SELF-PORTRAIT OF FIELDING H. GARRISON 371 who have come under that category: Lessing (Wolfenbüttel), Casa- nova (Dux), Panizzi (British Museum), Dziatzko, Edmund Gosse (B. M.), Justin Winsor (Harvard), Holden (astronomer - West Point, I think), Wjckersheimer, Putnam, Billings, Keogfi (Yale) - hoc genus omne. If a librarian's talents are confined to administra- tion only, he will be what Dickens called " a precious dry article," and probably his best services should be connected with a capacity to furnish all kinds of information, juice, good humor, experience of life, breath of vision, variegated knowledge and the trait of bagging bargains at no more than money's worth, which is found in dukes and high financiers. O. W. Holmes in the Boston Medical was another - and I am reminded of his phrase about pouncing on a bargain in a book-stall, like a tiger stalking his kill. Then there was Farlow (B. M. L.) - gentilhomme to his fingertips and one of the acutest thinkers on library business I have ever know. Lots of mis- fits in that line of business, which is a rather indefinite line, in many important respects - too often a soft mattress or springboard to something else. I have been itching, like a hound in leash, to make a stab at some- thing not dependent on medical bibliography, but have been tied up with official writing - pour l'honneur du roi des Prusses, etc. If a man gives hostages to fortune, to institutions, organizations, etc., he is, of course, enslaved, whether he likes it or not. The whole trick of serving with organizations is simply to recognize the fact - i. e. a public servant is exactly like the servant in " Arms and the Man," and the sensible thing is to make the best of it, as Europeans do. After running a dispensary for nearly two years in Manila, I should like almightily to have lived my life over again as a practitioner of some specialty like neurology, venereal or oto-laryngology, because it gives independence and the whip hand of the argument, but I was scared away from medicine by the idea of general practice, which re- quires a bigger brain and personality than I possess. I have just about brains enough to be efficient in a specialty, that is all. In my view, medicine does not really begin to be medicine until after 1850, the time of Virchow, Helmholtz, Ludwig, Claude Ber- nard, Pasteur and Lister and today, we would rather let the entire historical minutiae of pre-Hippocratic medicine go by the board than</page><page sequence="8">372 F. L. TIETSCH lose or miss out the achievements of Röntgen and the Curies, which are the points of departure of modern surgery. I know this sounds like heresy, but it is a fact when you approach the bed-side of the sick and wounded; in other words, " get that patient well " spells " medi- cine " ; find out how that process in normal and altered physiology comes to pass spells medical or laboratory science. Conjectural or theoretic medicine seems to pale into relative insignificance besides those big directives and objectives (in the military sense of the terms), because they are always asking the non-soluble " why," in- stead of the sparingly soluble " how." Pure science or applied non- medical science, such as astronomy, geology, mathematics, physics, has much better directives and objectives and had better even than medicine in the past; although, I think the initial Hippocratic and Aristotelian statements are correct, that the method of Greek science was initially derived from medical (bed-side) reasoning. The citation from Benjamin Rush to the effect that there is only one disease in the world, may seem absurd at first blush, but it has a certain respectability, in that it is not only very ancient, but also ultra-modern. It was not only the view of the Coan or Hippocratic school of medicine, which stood for a very " general pathology," without labeling or tagging different groups of diseases by specific names; but it is also maintained by an English physician, Mac- Donough by name, who has not only gone back to the old Coan no- tion of disease as altered physiology under multiform aspects, but has actually published two bulky volumes and is editing a bulky periodical to the effect that there is only one disease, the difference in symptoms and pathology being mere manifestations of biochemie change. This is " music of the future," with a vengeance, but at some mathematical limit of biochemie omniscience, it might have some plausibility and is, in effect, an extension of the view advanced by Rush himself. At my time of life, I am resigned to the static or natural history method of simply describing things as they are or seem to be, with the slogan " I am a man for whom the visible world exists." A good deal of the pseudo-physics and pseudo-mathematics of today suggests H. L. Mencken's memorable dictum that a man as scientist moves not from truth to truth but " from error to error." Judging by my</page><page sequence="9">SELF-PORTRAIT OF FIELDING H. GARRISON 373 own experience of life, the human mind is a very feeble institution, capable of only a limited number of scientific ideas and their cor- řesponsive antinomies, which, recur monotonously through the ages at intervals, and always seem new to those who haven't " been there before." This is Spinoza's epoch-making find of " inadequate ideas " in man, failing which the historical becomes " hysterical " and " Vernunft wird Unsinn, Wohltat Plage." Few realize under what difficulties I have worked in my life and it is a wonder that I have been able to accomplish anything at all in spite of the constant never-ending bibliographical grind, innumerable distractions and interruptions, next to no leisure and anything but the physical endowment one should have for excruciating toil, let alone failing eyesight for close work after a certain period. Had I functioned in another environment and with adequate leisure, I could have done better, and as old Johannes Brahms, the great composer, used to mutter, " even that isn't claiming very much." I simply hap- pened along as a skirmish liner and pioneer and did the best I could over rather rough ground, although with more relative ability than most, which again is not " claiming very much." At my age I realize how this world becomes a fleeting show, but as I proceed, my feeling toward Beethoven and Brahms becomes more and more a thing of passionate devotion, like that of a burning heretic to his faith or of a drowning man to his life-preserver. Seven years from now I shall be 70, or better still, mouldering in the grave, and of the two pros- pects, only the former gets the reaction - ouch, it hurts ! Osier was right about the chloroform.* * Garrison was 63 years old when he wrote these last two sentences. He died one year later, on April 18, 1935, after an abdominal operation for cancer of the intestine.</page></plain_text>
