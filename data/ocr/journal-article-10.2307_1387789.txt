<plain_text><page sequence="1">God Images: A Concept Map MARK A. KUNKELt STEPHEN COOKt DAVID S. MESHELt DONALD DAUGHTRYt ANITA HAUENSTEINt Explores research on God images, suggesting that prior investigations have been unnecessarly influenced by the tendency to limit participants' perspectives to a set of predetermined descriptors. Concept mapping, a method combining phenomenological inquiry and open card-sorts, is introduced as a way of portraying the scope, latent structure, and relative salience of images of God. Our exploratory concept map suggests that God images vary along the underlying dimensions of punitive versus nurturant and mystical versus anthropomorphic. Participants reported that traditional God images (e.g., 'Creator,' 'Everlasting,' 'Everywhere3) were much more salient for them than more punitive (eg., 'Intimidating,' 'Unfair') or nontraditional (e.g., 'Humorous," Woman") images. Calvin suggested that "without knowledge of self there is no knowledge of God. . . and without knowledge of God there is no knowledge of self" (McNeill [1559] 1960: 35-36). It is not surprising in light of this notion that psychology of religion has focused on individuals' "knowledge of God" as reflected in what have come to be referred to variously as God con- cepts or God images. We attempt in this study to illustrate an approach to the study of God images that focuses rather purely on individuals" internal constructions, with the hope of clarifying some possible avenues for future research in this area. Early work in God images (Gorsuch 1968; Nelson and Jones 1957; Spilka, Armatas, and Nussbaum 1964) established precedent for a body of literature reflecting important assumptions concerning the origin and nature of these images, the demographic and psycho- logical variables to which they may be related, and appropriate methodological approaches to their study. We discuss each of these areas of assumption briefly and separately. A fundamental point of demarcation in researching God images concerns the extent to which such images are viewed as corresponding to an external reality. Were we to be inter- ested in images of the color red, for example, we might attempt to uncover individuals' asso- ciations to this color and at some juncture compare them to the verifiable features of the external stimulus itself (for example, its hue, saturation, and wavelength). Research on God images from such a perspective might find support through the work of Hood (1989), who argues that God images may be properly investigated from a theological and ontological t Mark A Kunkel is a professor in the Department of Counseling and Counseling Psychology at Auburn University, 2084 Haley Center, Auburn University, Auburn, AL 36849.

Most research on God images, however, has consistently reflected the assumption that these images are internally (and phenomenologically) constructed and experienced, and therefore separate from any ontological questions about the external reality of God. Research in God images has tended consequently to be methodologically atheistic (cf. Hood 1989), consistent with Adler's (1980) suggestion that the real existence of God, being immaterial and incorporeal, must be imperceptible. It must also be unascertainable by scientific inference from empirical evidence, that is, evidence that we have through sense perception (1980: 84). Therefore, God image research might be properly termed phenomenological in the sense of being concerned with how people come to construe of God in consciousness (the experience of "red") and relatively unconcerned with how individual constructions might correspond to external reality (the objectifiable properties of "red'). A second area of assumptions concerns variables thought to be related to images of God. One readily accessible category of such variables is demographic, and includes con- structs such as gender, age, education, political preference and opinions, and religiousness. Clarification of the relation among these variables and images of God has been facilitated by the inclusion in the General Social Survey (GSS) of twelve image-of-God items (see Greeley 1989; Piazza and Glock 1979; Roof and Roof 1984), enabling large-scale descriptive com- parisons of selected God-image items across demographic categories. There has also been attention to more elusive psychological constructs such as self- esteem (Benson and Spilka 1973), parental projection and culture (Vergote et al. 1969), gender identity (Krejci, Erickson, and Aune 1992; Mollenkott 1984; Nelson, Cheek, and Au 1985), family environment (Dickie et al. 1997; Krejci 1994; Krejci, Jette, and Anderson 1993), object relations (Tisdale, Brokaw, and Edwards 1993) and development (Heller 1986; Tamminen 1996; Woodworth 1985) as related to God images. In general, results of these studies suggest that although God images tend to vary interestingly along some of these dimensions, they are highly and perhaps ultimately mediated internally. That is, even within similar developmental or social categories, individuals' God images seem to be highly personal and variable. A final assumption is methodological. Research on God images in this respect tends to fall squarely within the positivistic and reductionistic mainstream psychological tradition. Most research has attempted to measure God images within quantifiable domains selected by the researchers, and relate these domains statistically to similarly objectified constructs. A seminal study (Nelson and Jones 1957) created 60 positive (e.g., "a feeling that I am understood") and negative (e.g., "have a sense of something being held against me,') state- ments to examine participants' images of God as compared with images of Jesus, Father, and Mother. In later studies, items have been written to "terms originating from Biblical and theological sources" (Krejci et al 1992: 4), 'examin(ation) of more than a hundred psychological, philosophical, religious, and literary works in order to compile a list of characteristics" (Vergote et al. 1969: 80), or gleaned from previous item lists for statistical rigor as in Benson and Spilka (1973). This rational and empirical approach to scale con- struction has enabled reliable examination of research participants' response to selected items. It is unclear, however, to what extent these items capture meaningfully and com- pletely the extent of participants' construals of God. It may also be that some of the under- lying latent structure of God images may not be discoverable by use of the correlational approaches that have predominated in the field.</page><page sequence="3">CONCEPr MAP OF GOD IMAGES 195 In an insightful review of philosophical concerns in the measurement of religious concepts, Bassinger (1990) attributes much of the lack of clarity in the field to the ambi- guous and private nature of religious experience, and the elusive nature of the meanings reflected therein. Research in God images, from this perspective, would benefit from attempts to capture individuals' meanings in a way that acknowledges and accommodates their ambiguity and variability. Such approaches would seek to discover and then clarify the meaning of these images for participants, without limiting response options to those specified a priori by the researchers. Such approaches would also ideally accommodate the multidimensional nature of God images. Among such precedents, a qualitative approach is exemplified in Woodworth (1985), who although not concerned exclusively with images of God, included questions about them in her interviews with 40 female nursing home residents. Other researchers have also employed alternative methods through analysis of children's (e.g., Heller 1986) or adults' (e.g., Bassett et al. 1990) drawings of God or through review of children's letters to God (Ludwig et al. 1974). Several previous researchers have also attempted to uncover God images through relatively open written response protocols. Foster and Keating (1992) used a free response format in which they asked college students to write a paragraph describing God. These responses were categorized for sex and gender of the God-concept, and were used in a later cued-response task to identify the most salient elements of the God-concept in this cultural context. Finally, 74 statements from the free response were compiled in a questionnaire in which participants rated each God-concept for consistency with the Father, Mother, and Parent role. Three studies by Krejci and his colleagues (Krejci 1994; Krejci et al. 1992, 1993) have used a Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) methodology to clarify the latent organization in participants' perception of a predetermined set of God image items. Participants' sorts of God images items tended to organize along 'Judging/Nurturing," "Positive/Negative" or 'Controlling/Freeing,' and 'Abstract/Concrete" dimensions, suggesting that images of God may vary predictably along these criteria. Most relevantly, a 1995 study by Hutsebaut and Verhoeven compared directly closed- and open-ended approaches to what they term 'God representation." They argue that "in presenting open-ended question to the subjects, we grant the possibility of 'freely' formu- lating answers, inspired by their own thinking about God, using elements of the religious traditions of the subjects" (Hutsebaut and Verhoeven 1995: 50). These investigators found that when given the opportunity to generate responses to an open-ended question ("What is the meaning of God for you?"), their sample of 1,438 students responded in a way that the researchers grouped into 16 categories. Examples of these include relationship, immanency, meaning, transcendency, ethical qualifications, negative attitude toward the church, and unbelief. The researchers then clustered participants according to their response to the open-ended question as well as to the 53 God Representation items administered as part of a 44-page battery of scales. Hutsebaut and Verhoeven conclude that 'there was an overlap between the two ways of deciphering the subjects' representations (that will, perhaps, be very similar to the answers on the item list), an open-ended question is recommended" (1995: 59). In all, this study appears to be an important contribution to the literature. It is unclear, however. to what extent the prompt ("What is the meaning of God for you?") might have helped participants access God images specifically (as reflected, for example, in the Negative Attitude Toward the Church and the Unbelief categories that are difficult to assimilate to God images). The results are also quite dependent on the researchers' deci- sions about categorization of responses, which although stated to be "based on the meaning exrpressed by the subject8" (1995: 54) nevertheless involved researchers', rather than</page><page sequence="4">196 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION participants', organizational strategies. Finally, perhaps a more appropriate application of cluster analysis, given the stated intent of "studying dimensions of God representation" (1995: 49), would have been to cluster items rather than participants. The purpose of this investigation was to extend these precedents through seeking a relatively unconstrained perspective on the domain of God images and clarifying their latent structure and salience, using concept mapping. Concept mapping is an alternative methodological approach that has been used to examine constructs such as the experience of depression (Daughtry and Kunkel 1993), giftedness (Kunkel, Chapa, Patterson, and Walling 1995), student motivations (Kunkel, Chapa, Patterson, and Walling 1994), and images of the 'ideal" woman (Gannon, Creamer, and Kunkel 1998). Detailed information about con- cept mapping is available in previous publications (e.g., Daughtry and Kunkel 1993). In brief, participants first respond in writing to a phenomenological probe (cf. Giorgi 1985) designed to elicit focally yet openly their experience of the phenomenon of interest. Following qualitative reduction of participants' responses to a comprehensive group of items retaining their language, participants perform unstructured card-sorts of these items. To clarify further the representativeness of the concepts, each is also rated by participants individually as to how well it reflects their perspective on the phenomenon. Participant sorting of the items forms the basis for inferring their latent structure, and ratings provide access to the relative salience of specific items and clusters of items. Descriptive statistics, multidimensional scaling and cluster analytic techniques are used in combination and applied to rating and sorting data to produce a visual map depicting the interrelations among items, superordinate clusters of items in the domain of interest, and suggest the items that are most salient for participants. Concept mapping is particularly appropriate for exploratory studies using relatively small participant samples. As a qualitatively based research method, it seeks for conceptual rather than statistical significance, and for meaning rather than necessary generalizability: "Qualitative researchers usually work with small samples of people, nested in their context and studied in depth - unlike quantitative researchers, who aim for larger numbers of context-stripped cases and seek statistical significance" (Miles and Huberman 1994: 27, emphasis in original). It is hoped that application of concept mapping to God images will lend additional perspective to this field, and perhaps suggest other psychology of religion topics to which concept mapping may be appropriately suited. METHOD Participants Participants in this study (N = 20) were undergraduate students from the research pool of a large Southwestern university. Participants volunteered for this study with the understanding that its intent was to investigate "their experience of religious constructs." Median age of participants was 20 (SD = 5.9), with a range of 18 to 57. Gender was equally balanced, with ten women and ten men. Procedure There were two data-gathering sessions. During the first, participants completed a thought-listing task in which they provided one-, two-, or three-word responses to an unstructured prompt (i.e., "What is God Like?"). In formulating this prompt, care was taken not to limit response to any specific domain or characteristic. Participants' written responses were transcribed, and then analyzed independently by members of a research team that at the time of the investigation had been meeting weekly</page><page sequence="5">CONCEPT MAP OF GOD IMAGES 197 for approximately two years with primary focus on qualitative analysis of text. The intent of this analysis was to identify an inclusive subset of items that captured the domain of God images for these participants. Following independent scrutiny of this material, the researchers met and through compilation of their meaning unit list identified approxi- mately 200 unique or recurrent items. These items were next analyzed by the research group for redundancy, and a final list of 85 God-image items was compiled In the second session, two weeks after the first, participants returned for the sorting and rating tasks. Participants were asked to place the 85 cards (with an item from the reduction printed on each) in piles according to 'how they seemed to go together." No restrictions were placed on participants' sorting strategies other than that they not place each item card alone in a pile nor place all cards in one pile. As Rosenberg and Kim (1975) point out, this method has the advantage of making it unnecessary-for either the respondents or the investigator to specify any of the psychological dimensions or attributes that can provide a basis for judgments of similarity. The identification of underlying dimensions or attributes can take place from the structures obtained by scaling and clustering, leaving the respondents' judgments uncontaminated by an investigators preconceptions (1975: 490). The 85 God image items were also compiled into a questionnaire, in which partici- pants rated each on an equidistant Likert scale (Dobson and Mothersill 1979) according to their how well it "described what God is like for them," with one indicating 'Not at All" and four "Extremely Well." The intent of this procedure was to enable identification of the most common God images within participant group. Participants then responded to a list of items from the General Social Survey regarding religious activity and affiliation. Analysis A nonmetric multidimensional scaling procedure (MDS) was performed on the similarity matrix of participants' sorted items. Multidimensional scaling arranges points representing items along orthogonal axes such that the distance between any two points reflects the frequency with which the items were sorted together. Discussions of this statis- tical technique (e.g., Kruskal and Wish 1978) have emphasized the suitability of MDS for representing spatially the latent relations among variables, particularly when these relations are unknown. An additional advantage of MDS is that the stability of the solution is relatively independent of the number of research participants, and traditional statistical considerations of power do not apply (Kruskal and Wish 1978). Hierarchical cluster analysis of the MDS similarity matrix was then used to group sorted items into internally consistent clusters, this dluster solution being superimposed on the MDS point plot. Although cluster analysis is frequently used for selection of subgroups of participants with similar response to a given variable, its use is also appropriate for direct measures of proximity (cf. Borgen and Bamett 1987) such as MDS matrices. Ward's minimum variance method (Ward 1963) was used to optimize distinctiveness across clusters. Members of the research team next individually assgned names to the dlusters of MDS items based on inspection of the constituent items, and once again met as a group to reach consensus about a descriptive and justifiable name for each. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) were compiled of participants' representativeness ratings for each God image item, and means were ranked to illustrate relative patterns of endorsement. Given the small sample size and the exploratory nature of the investigation, no statistical comparisons such as t-tests were indicated.</page><page sequence="6">198 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION RESULTS The MDS procedure resulted in a final stress value of .27 for a two-dimensional solution. The stress value is an index of the stability of an MDS solution, and ranges from zero (perfectly stable) to one (perfectly unstable). Although .27 is not optimal, it represents a reasonably stable solution. The selection of a two-dimensional solution was also consistent with the concept mapping approach in which 'the MDS configuration is desired primarily as a foundation on which to display clustering results" and, the two-dimensional solution is therefore 'far more useful than one involving three or more dimensions" (Kruskal and Wish 1978: 58). The concept map of the 85 God image items is found in Figure 1. Because this way of presenting data may be unusual, detailed explanation of the map follows. The 85 items identified in participants' responses are represented as points on the map; each is labeled. The placement of points is derived from the MDS solution, the distance between them reflecting the frequency with which the items were sorted together by participants. That is, points that are relatively close together represent items placed together in participants' sorts more frequently than items represented by points more distant from one another. Clusters of items from the cluster analysis are identified by boundaries around groups of points, representing items that were frequently sorted together in the same pile and less often sorted with items in other piles. Although in some cases this grouping may be somewhat counterintuitive, the clustering algorithm attempts to minimize variance of items within clusters and maximize variance of items between clusters. Even though some items may seem to be "misplaced," the cluster procedure reflects an optimal statistically informed grouping that may serve as a starting point for additional conceptual exploration. The bold- faced names within each cluster are those assigned to the cluster by the research team in consideration of items making up the clusters and inspection of those items most contributing to the uniqueness of each cluster. As with other procedures such as factor analysis, naming of clusters is both statistically and conceptually influenced. Interpretation of the concept map involves informed conjecture about the possible structure participants imposed on the items in their sorting. Examination of the map attempts initially to identify implicit dimensional axes around which points may be configured (see Buser 1989). Inspection of the placement and adjacency of items and clusters can be helpful in this process as well, to identify apparent regions of the map and potentially related constructs. Inspection of the map suggests that God images appear to be organized along the two dimensions of mystical versus anthropomorphic (dividing the map vertically) and nurturant versus punitive (horizontally). Items in the upper portion of the map reflect human and controlling roles, in contrast to those in the bottom that are more mystical or inspirational in nature. Most items in the right region of the map seem to reflect benevolently powerful or nurturant images of God. Items in the left of the map are generally suggestive of images of God as vengeful, punishing, or capricious. Inspection of dusters suggests several distinct regions of God images. Human images of God tended to be grouped by role (e.g., 'Man," 'Woman," 'Brother") and regulating functions, such as "Teacher," "Ruler," "Judge," and "Lawmaker." Images of God as powerful were placed on the map between controlling and nurturant functions, through items such as "Life-giving," and "Strong." The left portion of the map contains items indicative of distant and mystical experiences of God, in which images such as "Silent" and "Relentless" may have been perceived as similar to "Conscience," "Unpredictably," and 'Misunderstood." With respect to cluster composition, participants appeared to sort most human role items (e.g., "Man," "Woman," "Mother," "Brother") together. The "Friend" image, however, tended to be sorted with other powerfull and benevolent itemas. Similarly, most controlling or</page><page sequence="7">CONCEPT MAP OF GOD IMAGES 199 bO cl- to co FE r-4 CL Ca co to E ko Z bO CD CD</page><page sequence="8">200 JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTFIC STUDY OF RELIGION powerful role items (such as 'Lawmaker," 'Protector," 'Creator") were sorted together. The "Powerful" and "Benevolent" clusters reflect grouping of more positive and nurturant images, such as "Strong," 'Unselfish," and "Loving." Images of God as inspirational indluded "Energizing," "Exciting," and "Amazing." Many items grouped in the "Mysterious' duster seemed to be related to adjacent clusters, such as the proximity of the "Watchful" item to the "Regulating" cluster, the "Relentless" to the "Vengeful" cluster, and the NSpiritualr to the 'Inspirational" cluster. This is not uncommon in our expenence for the central clusters in a concept map, which may contain items that bridge conceptually across concepts. Prototypical God images are suggested by the magnitude and consistency of partici- pants' ratings of how well each item reflected their experience, although given the small sample size we are reluctant to overinterpret these findings. Participants' ratings of tradi- tional God images (e.g., "Creator," "Everlasting," "Everywhere") may have been more salient for them than more punitive (e.g., "Intimidating," "Unfair") or nontraditional (e.g., "Humor- ous," "Woman") images. DIWUSSON The breadth of participant images of God is consistent with previous findings sug- gesting that God images are multidimensional and varied. To the extent that our results are generalizable to other settings, participants may imagine God in diverse and rich ways, as with other psychological constructs in which there is significant diversity. These results may provide additional support for Hutsebaut's and Verhoeven's (1995) conclusion that open-ended response formats "make it possible for each subject to express his or her own answer without feeling restrained by the possibilities offered, imposed, or predetermined by the researcher" (59). Participants in this study nevertheless produced a list of God images with con- siderable overlap to those in previous investigations. Eight (i.e., "Creator," 'Healer," "Friend," "Father," "Redeemer/Messiah," KingRuler," "Judge," "Mother") of the 12 items in the General Social Survey were included spontaneously by our participants, with no specific mention of "Master," "Liberator," "Spouse," or "Lover." There is also overlap with the work of Benson and Spilka (1973) in that our participants' items covered each of their Vindictive, Stern Father, Allness, Distant, Supreme Ruler, and Kindly Father factors. It is encouraging that researchers' constructions appear to correspond reasonably well to participants' experience. Our participants' images also relate well to more theoretically or even theologically derived formulations. Phillips' (1961) categorization of God as "resident policeman," "parental hangover," "grand old man," "meek and mild," 'absolute perfection," "heavenly bosom, "managing director," and "perennial grievance" is reflected quite well in our partici- pants' images of God. The organizational dimensions of nurturant versus punitive, and of mystical versus anthropomorphic, also find parallels in previous research. Krejci and his colleagues (Krejci 1994; Krejci et al. 1992, 1993) have consistently found Judging/Nurturing, Controlling/ Saving, and Concrete/Abstract dimensions in their investigations of the latent structure of predetermined God images. Our decision to use a two-dimensional solution as a visual display may have collapsed the former two dimensions. It is also worth noting, however, that our participants mentioned some images of God (e.g., "Unpredictable,' "Punishing,' "Unfair," and 'Intimidating," "Life-Taker") that appear to have anchored the punitive dimension and have not typically been included in previous studies. The structure of the map is also interesting in terms of the adjacency of clusters. Perhaps images of God as controlling bridge human and powerful roles in their reflection of God's perceived influence on human life. Similarly, it is interesting to note that most</page><page sequence="9">CONCEPT MAP OF 01D EMAGES 201 'Powerful' items were sorted simiarly to benevolent rather than vengeful items. Images of God as inspirational may again bridge benevolence and mystery. Finally, the "Mysterious" cluster seems to consolidate images of God bridging well to other clusters. This is inter- esting in light of the notion that the most salient and abiding quality of God may be that of being unknowable. Patterns of salience ratings suggest that these participants tended to view God as masculine ('Father" x = 3.35, sd = .88; versus 'Mother" x = 2.30, sd = 1.03), powerful ('Powerful x = 3.85, sd = .49; 'Everlasting" x = 4.0,sd = .00), and nurturant (ComfortinWg x = 3.85, sd =.37) rather than punitive ('Punishing" x = 1.95, sd = 1.00). These findings are also consistent with those of other investigations in suggesting that images of God tend to be androcentric and traditional (Foster and Keating 1992). The concept mapp approach is unique in providing a qualitatively anchored and statistically derived visual representation of the domain and interrelation of God images. We hope that it provides a vehicle for investigation of God images and other psychology of religion topics that are phenomenological in nature. Nevertheless, several cautions are in order regarding this approach. As with other alternative methodologies (see Hoshmand 1989), it involves important compromises between accurate descriptions of a phenomenon in context and the generalizability of this description to other settings. We hope that this concept map captured the territory and underlying structure of God images for these participants. The relevance and descriptive value of these findings for other populations is, however, unknown. Although in many ways our findings were consistent with those in previous studies, there is much to be gained by additional sample-specific perspectives or comprehensive large n extensions.
