<plain_text><page sequence="1">SYMBOL, MYTH AND MEANING IN ARCHITECTURE Mimi Lobell, Instructor School of Architecture Pratt Institute Brooklyn, N.Y. 11205 212 677 2882 The problem is to reestablish an awareness in archi- tectural thought and design of the symbolic, mytho- logical, cosmological and spiritual content of archi- tecture. This awareness was eradicated in the modern movement in order to direct energies into coping with the problems of increasing industrialization, popula- tion and urbanization. With the growth of a new global/cosmic consciousness, these problems can no longer be addressed as isolated stimulus/response phenomena. The needs have changed. Even "the masses" are thrashing about for a pinning down of their individual identities within the overwhelming collec- tive. Yet they are answered only with flux and exis- tential freedom (or alienation?). Traditionally buildinas have served functional needs, whereas archi- tecture has expressed the mythology of a culture, that implicit collective understanding of cosmic order that integrates each individual into the primordial forces of existence (creation, self/other duality, phenomenal reality, etc.) and makes communication and civilization possible. Perhaps 20th Century American mythology is expressed in space exploration, Hewlett Packer compu- tors, and Sony color television. Thus architects find themselves in the marqinal and dispensable capacity of servants to the functional needs of clients with enough money to vaguely remember what architecture used to be. Mv work focuses on a search for a meaning- ful contemporary interpretation of those fundamental, universal and life-supportive aualities of myth that can only be communicated architecturally. I teach an architectural design studio. The students want and need to know how to design buildings so they can get jobs. In order to meet this practical need and to address the problem outlined above, I have the students design a Growth Center, a building housing virtually all the systems for spiritual awareness: yoga, meditation, biofeedback, psychotherapy, sensory depri- vation and sensory stimulation, etc. It is a complex problem architecturally with varied spaces and rela- tions among users of those spaces. But before design symbolism in architecture defining 69</page><page sequence="2">Symbol, Myth and Meaning in Architecture on the buildinq begins, during a research phase, the students investigate the following: 1. Their own spiritual orientation and experience. 2. The symbolic content of historical precedents such as Stonehenge, the Pyramids, Hindu temples, Mayan cities, Chartres, and anthropomorphic indigenous architecture. 3. The philosophy of the spiritual systems contained in the Growth Center program. 4. Symbolic (and sensual) transformations of contem- porary archetypal spaces. 5. The metaphysical essence of the Growth Center itself (as in Louis Kahn's approach to design). Thus the students are able to approach a specific design problem with a personal, historical and contem- porary perspective on the symbolic meaning of architec- ture. I feel I am at the beginning of relearning a vast lost knowledge about architecture. My work with my students is limited by their capacities and mine, but we are part of an inevitable revolution in architec- tural thought. This revolution is well underway in many fields as the global culture reassesses its very structures of consciousness. Inasmuch as architects become responsive to and responsible for these changes, they will return from the role of "errand-boy" to that of oracle of our culture.
