After the collapse of the 'Abbasid Empire by the mid- dle of the tenth century, local regimes and new elites replaced central governmen- tal control throughout the provinces of the old empire. Khurasan was the first settled society that the Turkish Ghaznavid dynasty (established c. 994-98) and the Saljuqs (by 1040) encountered, and it served as a testing ground for the new elite's relations with Muslim communal organizations.' Over the centuries, the ulama had developed their own structures of authority and organization (the madhhabs) independent of the state.2 These religious associations had come to represent Islam in its social and doctrinal aspects.3 In Khurasan, the religious prestige, judicial authority, and organization of the ulama made them a focus of identity and loyalty and gave them a broad base of popular support. In effect, the Hanafi, Shafi'i, and Karrami madhhabs governed Nishapur, the principal city of Khurasan.4 It was in Khurasan that the organized madhhabs first began to be supported by governing officials. The Ghaznavid and Saljuq conquerors needed the support of 1. For the Ghaznavids, see C. E.

The schools of law were the oldest Muslim communal organizations. In the sev- enth century the schools were regionally defined and in the eighth century they came to be known by the names of particular masters. By the ninth century there were well- established groups of teachers and students which had become popular religious movements. The schools of law became the centers of local educational, political, and communal activities. By the end of the tenth century these informal networks had become more formalized. Madrasas became the physical centers of the schools and the endowment of funds made full-time study possible. During the tenth century there was a conjunction of the spread of religious and communal organizations, mass con- versions to Islam, and the rise of the religious classes to social and political power. 4. The seminal study of the social and political history of Nishapur is Richard Bul- liet', The Patricians of Nishapur: A Study in Medieval Islamic Social History (Cambridge, Mass., 1972).</page><page sequence="2">38 Malamud the ulama to rule successfully. In exchange for providing the new elites with aid and legitimacy, the ulama and Sufis received support in the form of madrasas, khanaqa-hs, stipends, and salaries.5 Key institutions such as the madrasa and the urban ribat seem to have originated in Khurasan.6 Patterns for the state's rela- tions with the ulama were first worked out there and later adopted in Baghdad and the Saljuq successor states in the west.7 The representatives of Islam were the ulama and Sufis, but there was no consen- sus among them. In Khurasan, as elsewhere, there was a wide range of Islamic thought and a variety of paths to religious recognition. Not only did Shi'ism pose a threat to unity, but within Sunni Islam there was no consensus on what constituted normative Islam. In this fluid period there was no agreement on which of the existing styles of Islam was canonical, and competition and strife were common between different factions. Debates over what it meant to be a Muslim and what the parameters of acceptable thought and practice ought to be were part of a widespread movement of social and political change. In Khurasan there was a broad spectrum of opinion on such questions as the proper scope and expression of devotional piety; to what extent reason should be used to defend or expound doctrine; and whether economic profit was in conflict with true piety. In Nishapur, Shafi'is, Hanafis, and Karramis disagreed on these and other issues, and were in fierce competition for social and political power. Each of these madhhabs attracted large followings and each offered a coherent synthesis of law, theology, and devotional piety. All three at various times re- ceived support from foreign elites in the form of madrasas, khanaqa-hs, and offi- cial positions and stipends. Over the course of the eleventh century, however, the Karramiyya were edged out of power and virtually annihilated by the other urban factions. Non-Karrami authors vilified them and labeled them heretics. Our interest here is in why the Karramiyya failed to retain a position as a viable madhhab in Khurasan. What was the Karrami vision of Islam and why was it re- jected? What accounts for its failure and the success of the other schools in 5. As one historian has put it: "In short, regimes without legitimacy could assure ac- ceptance by and the cooperation of their subjects only by supporting Muslim reli- gious life" (Ira Lapidus, "Ayyubid Religious Policy and the Development of the Schools of Law in Cairo," Colloque international sur l'histoire du Caire [1974]: 274- 86, at 281). 6.

Among the other pre- viously unrecognized sources for the Karramiyya that van Ess discusses is a manuscript by 'Umar al-Samarqandi (flourished during the second half of the eleventh century), entitled Kitab al-rawnaq al-qulub. In this work, Ibn Karram is presented in a favorable light-he is mentioned along with other pious men (such as Abu Hanifa) as an exemplar of a variety of virtues. The manuscript provides a good deal of informa- tion on Ibn Karram's ascetic and mystical teachings, particularly on tawakkul. Zysow has also identified two new sources for the Karramiyya, the most important of which is an eleventh-century legal treatise, al-Nutaf fi'1-fatawa. This was previously thought to have been written by a Hanafi, but Zysow attributes it to a Karrami. This text provides us with important information on Karrami legal teachings.</page><page sequence="4">40 Malamud Karrami), there is enough information to sketch out some important points of doctrine and their organization and influence in Khurasan. The founder of the Karramiyya, Abu 'Abdullah Muhammad b. Karram (d. 255/869), was born in Sijistan. At a young age he sold all of his goods and went to Mecca where he spent five years and then moved to Nishapur, where he spent most of his life.'5 In Nishapur he became the companion of the ascetic preacher Amad b. Harb (d. 234/848), who was influential in his training as an ascetic and in his formation as a jurist. '6 Ahmad belonged to a tradition of early Muslim preachers and ascetics who exerted their energies in spreading Islam and urging Muslims to upright behavior. He was a traditionalist whose audience was primarily urban.'7 Ibn Karram expanded Ahmad' s message and audience. Like him, he was a tradi- tionalist, an ascetic, and a preacher, but he also promulgated his own theological doctrine.'8 He took part in the contemporary debates concerning what precisely constituted faith and being a good Muslim. He took a middle position between the Mu'tazilite and the ahl al-hadith over the propriety of reason in matters of faith. In his use and definition of scholastic terms he was in between the ex- treme positions of the Hashwiyya and the Mu'tazilite.'9 Thus, in addition to being an ascetic and a traditionalist, he was also a theologian. A treatise, 'Adhacb al-qabr (The Punishment of the Grave), was attributed to him.20 This work is lost, but fragments of another work, Kitab al-sirr, are ex- tant.21 The latter work seems to have consisted largely of hadith; and some of the sayings attributed to Ibn Karram pose questions about God's wisdom and his 15.

According to Maqdisi (Ahsan al-taqa-sim, 37), the Karramiyya had their own legal system and theology (fiqh wa kalam). He provides evidence for both in his de- scription of the Karramiyya. 19.

He and his followers were active missionaries and they impressed Muslims and non- Muslims alike with the asceticism of their lives. While his master, Ahmad b. Harb's audience had been urban, Ibn Karram addressed a rural as well as an urban audience. According to Baghdadi and Shahristani, his first proselytizing efforts were among the peasants of Ghur, Gharchistan, and the Khurasanian country- side.24 Some of his supporters followed him to Nishapur.25 In the eyes of many rural peoples the Karramiyya would have represented Islam itself. The Karramiyya were enthusiastic proselytizers and were actively engaged in convert- ing peoples to Islam.26 Indeed, one of Muhammad b. Karram's descendants is said to have converted the Ghaznavid general Sebuktigin to Karrami Islam.27 When they proselytized, the Karramiyya were very visible and vocal. Subki de- scribes Ibn Karram preaching, reciting hadith, and reminding people of God dressed in a white cylindrical hat (qalansuwa) and wearing sheepskin.28 They were successful in gaining converts to Islam and established khanaqa-hs as cen- ters for meeting and missionary work. Endowments presumably allowed the res- idents of these khacnaqahs to devote themselves completely to worship and preaching, without having to work for a living. The khanaqa-hs provided the Karramiyya with an organizational network which extended from the eastern edge of the Muslim world all the way to Fustat. According to the geographer Maq- disi, the khainaqahs belonged exclusively to the Karramiyya.29 Only at the end 22. For example: "Human beings commit sins, whereas those creatures whose meat they eat-camels, cows, sheep and the birds to which they give chase-do not bear any guilt. What kind of wisdom allows Him to let loose those who sin and go astray on those who obey?" (From Ibn al-Da'i, Tabsira 65, 13 ff., quoted in van Ess, "Ungenuitzte Texte," 14). 23. See van Ess, "Une lecture," 188; idem, "Ibn ar-Rewandi, or the Making of an Image," al-Abhath 27 (1978-79): 5-26. 24. His followers were the poor from Shuramayn and Afshin who came with him to Nishapur during the governorship of Muhammad b. Tahir. See Shahristani, al-Milal wa'l-nihal, 31; Baghdadi, al-Farq bayna al-firaq, 131; and C. E. Bosworth, "The Early Islamic History of Ghur," Central Asiatic Journal 6 (1961): 116-133, esp. 128 ff. 25. Baghdadi says a band of the poor from the rural districts of Nishapur came with him into the city and followed him in his innovation (al-Farq bayna al-firaq, 131); and Subki, quoting al-Hakim, says that Ibn Karram had with him a group of the poor (fuqard') (Tabaqdt al-shdfi'iyya 2:304). 26. R. Bulliet suggests that the Karramiyya were probably responsible for many conversions to Islam in rural regions, and also some conversions in urban areas.

As Chabbi has pointed out, the presence of khanaqdhs seems to be a criterion for Maqdisi in identifying the presence of Karramiyya in a given area ("Remarques," 43). Maqdisi mentions Karrami khanaqdhs a number of times (Ahsan al-taqa-sim, 179, 182,</page><page sequence="6">42 Malamud of the tenth century do they begin to be associated with other groups, notably the Sufis.30 The Karramiyya also had at least three madrasas in Nishapur, the headquarters of the movement,31 and one in Herat that seems to have been founded by Ibn Karram himself.32 Ibn Karram's doctrine and message were not extraordinary. He was learned in hadith, pious, an ascetic and a founder of a madhhab with its own legal, theolog- ical, and mystical synthesis.33 The followers of Ibn Karram formed a madhhab which had its own fiqh and offered its members a full way of life. For example, they had their own rules for prayer, ablution, and burial.34 Ibn Karram took part in contemporary religious debates and he and his followers held theological posi- tions which were less extreme than many contemporaries.35 However, when he arrived in Nishapur with a group of supporters, he was imprisoned by Muham- mad b. Tahir and then expelled from the city.36 The ruler of Sijistan also ex- pelled him, but feared killing him because of his obvious piety.37 Throughout the tenth and the eleventh centuries the Karramiyya aroused the enmity of the Hanafi and Shafi'i madhhabs in Nishapur. Finally, in 488/1095 they were crushed by the combined efforts of those madhhabs.38 What was it about this group that aroused such hostility? One place to look for a partial explanation is at the social and political implica- tions of some of their ascetic and mystical teachings. An important aspect of Karrami piety was their antipathy to certain kinds of economic livelihood. The 238, 323, 365, 377). For general background on the khanaqah s.v.

Opponents of the Karramiyya claimed, however, that Ibn Karram was a man of little learning who had taken a confused medley of ideas from other madhhabs and formed a heretical madhhab. See Shahristani, al-Milal wa'l-nihal 1:31. 34. Maqdisi provides several specific examples.of their legal teachings (Ahsan al- taqasim, 40).

Ibn Karram seems to have been particularly well known and remembered by his followers as a pious ascetic (za-hid) and for his extreme prac- tice of tawakkul. In the Rawnaq al-quluib he stands out as an exemplar of this mystical virtue as well as an authority on how to practice it.42 Ibn Karram's practice of tawakkul was bound up with his prohibition of striving for economic gain (tahriim al-makdsib) which, he believed, interfered with complete devotion to God.43 Questions regarding the legitimacy of commercial gain had become common in ninth century. How could economic gain be reconciled with piety? Was the amassing of capital (iddikhdr) permissible? Did trust in God (tawakkul) pre- clude work? Was voluntary poverty (faqr) better than earning a living? There was a wide range of responses to these questions and no consensus on the best answers. An indication of the importance of economic ethics is the number of books written on the subject. Perhaps the oldest and the most important treatise is Kitab al-kasb, composed by Muhammad al-Shaybani (d. 804), the virtual co-founder of the Hanafi school.44 Like other texts of the period, it is largely a collection of hadith. Its main thrust is to show that earning a living is not only permitted, it is incumbent upon the believer; and indeed, money earned by commerce and crafts is pleasing 39. Kasb in its economic sense as gain. S.v. "Kasb," Encyclopedia of Islam, for a discussion of the various meanings of kasb. Generally, gain can take two forms: gain for simple subsistence, or for true profit.

Shaybani, for example, in- cluded this anecdote in his Kitdb al-kasb: Once the Caliph 'Umar saw a group of pious men sitting with downcast heads. These, he was told, were the mutawakkilun (and so they refrained from professing a trade). "No," said the Caliph, making a pun, "these are the muta'akkiluin (those who eat up other people's money). You had better lift up your heads and earn your own livelihood."46 Other works, however, were opposed to kasb: Ibn Karram's master, Amad b. Harb and his pupil Amad b. Yahya Hulwani (d. 909) were among those who wrote treatises on the subject.47 According to the theologian al-Ash'ari, the tahrtm al-makdsib associated with the Karramiyya was also characteristic of certain ascetic Mu'tazilites. The Mu'tazilite Ibn Rawandi even wrote a book called Kitdb al-ddr wa tahrim al- makdsib.48 Faqr, kasb, and tawakkul were also important issues in Sufism and there was no consensus on their proper practice. For example, Shaqiq al-Balkhi reputedly advocated inkar al-kasb, while Abu Talib al-Makki concluded that id- dikha-r was not in conflict with tawakkul if the practitioner's intention was to serve God.49 Thus, the Karramiyya were not unique in the attention they gave to these issues, but they did hold radical views. Indeed, the tahrnm al-makdsib of the Karramiyya was condemned in the official Samanid creed.50 While many Muslims were able to accommodate and even advocate commerce as pleasing to God, th^e Karramiyya firmly opposed it. These would have been volatile issues in Nishapur. Nishapur was one of the most important trading centers in the medieval Middle East, and many members of the ulama were merchants. One of Nishapur's most profitable sources of in- come was trade, in particular trade in finished cloth. Many of Ibn Karram's ear- liest supporters were rural people upon whose craft the merchants relied.5' The Karramiyya also seem to have been particularly popular among the lower classes in Nishapur. Their quarter was in the northwestern section of Nishapur, a par- 45. In fact, such a livelihood was considered more pleasing to God than that earned from government work (either civil or military).

During the tenth and early eleventh centuries, they achieved a considerable degree of political and social power. The Karramiyya were competing for power and influence in Nishapur. Their so- phisticated and extensive organization (notably their khanaqahs), success in proselytizing, and appeal to both urban and rural populations threatened Hanafi and Shafi'i control of the city. By the late tenth century, the Hanafi and Shafi'i factions had achieved a balance of power within the city by their control of the judiciary and educational systems.53 As spokesmen for the schools of law, lead- ing merchant-ulama families from those madhhabs had worked out a pattern for dealing with the regimes who nominally ruled Nishapur. The Turkish rulers, who were unfamiliar with local affairs, needed the help of the ulama more than the ulama needed their support. The regimes needed the cooperation of the madhhabs in order to govem effectively and they allowed leading ulama families to maintain de facto control over urban life. The Ghaznavids, and later the Saljuqs, experimented with patronizing different madhhabs as a means of admin- istering and controlling their newly conquered territories. The Ghaznavids, for example, initially favored the Hanafi madhhab. In 997, Sultan Mahmud of Ghazna made himself their patron as a way of safeguarding his position in Nishapur. He issued a coin bearing a Qur'anic verse (3:17) which was recognized as supporting the Mu'tazilite theology favored by many Hanafis.54 His brother, Nasr, built and endowed a madrasa for the Hanafi qad-, Abu 'Ala Sa'id. The Ghaznavids did not limit their patronage to one madhhab, however. In the late tenth and early eleventh centuries, the Ghaznavids also sup- ported the Karramiyya. At that time, the leader of the Karramiyya in Nishapur was Abu Ya'qub Ishaq b. Mahmudshadh (d. 383/993).55 Little is known of him save that he was a pious ascetic and had reputedly converted 5,000 people to Islam in Nishapur.56 His piety made a strong impression on the Ghaznavid leader Sebuktigin, who favored the Karramiyya.57 Abu Ya'qub's son, Abu Bakr, succeeded to leadership of the 52.

As Bulliet has pointed out, they had no known connections to Hanafi or Shafi'i families, and because of this they could be of service to a ruler as informants and mediators in local poli- tics. When Mahmud gave the riya-sa to Abu Bakr, he upset the balance of local politics by giving official recognition to a third madhhab. For the first time the riydsa was held by an 'alim and a member of a madhhab hated by the other urban factions. Mahmud must have thought his appointment of a Karrami as ra'ls would in- crease his control and influence in Nishapur. In his attempt to support the posi- tions of the caliphate in Baghdad, he encouraged Abu Bakr to combat heterodoxy, which, according to the caliphate, meant Ash'ari theology, Mu'tazilism, and Isma'ilism. Abu Bakr harassed leading Shafi'is (who tended to favor Ash'arism), Hanafis (who tended to favor Mu'tazilism), and Shi'is and Sufis.60 The Ash'ari scholar Ibn Furak (d. 406/1015-16) was accused of heresy and had to defend him- self before the Sultan at Ghazna.61 The Sufi Abu Sa'id b. Abi Khayr also ran into difficulties with Abu Bakr.62 The Hanafi Qadi Abu al-'Ala Sa'id (d. 431/1040) retaliated by accusing Abu Bakr of anthropomorphism 63, Abu Bakr denied the charges, but Mahmud dismissed him from the minbars and madrasas of the city. Abu Bakr's zealousness in testing the orthodoxy of local leaders could only have exacerbated the tension between Hanafis, Shafi'is, and Karramis. Instead of en- abling him to achieve a greater degree of control over the internal politics of Nishapur, Mahmud's support of the Karramiyya increased factional strife in the city. At first the sultan tried to ignore the complaints about Abu Bakr's witch hunt, but eventually he was forced to take action against him. When Mahmud dismissed Abu Bakr from his official position, the riyasa returned to the Mikali family. The ra'izs who took his place began an extensive public works program which served to quiet the unrest Abu Bakr had stirred up.64 After Abu Bakr's removal from office, the power of the Karramiyya was broken. A severe persecution ensued, and Abu Bakr was obliged to take up a life of pious 58. On the importance of Abu Bakr see Bosworth, "Rise of the Karamiyyah," 7-13. 59.

When Mahmud conquered Ghur in 41 1/1010-1.1, he left Karrami teach- ers to instruct the populace in Islam.65 This was precisely the time he withdrew his support for them in Nishapur. Having recognized the unpopularity of his backing of them in Nishapur, he may have deflected them to Ghur. Islam in its Karrami variant took root in Ghur, but the Ghurid kings renounced adherence to the Karrami madhhab in 595/1199.66 As the influence of the Karramiyya waned during the course of the eleventh cen- tury, the balance of power returned to the Hanafi and Shafi'i madhhabs. In their attempts to govern the city, the Saljuqs, like the Ghaznavids before them, exper- imented with supporting one or the other of the madhhabs. In the middle of the eleventh century, the Saljuqs patronized the Hanafi faction in Nishapur. At that time, the Saljuq Sultan Tughril Beg's vizier, 'Amid al-Mulk al-Kunduri, attempted to gain the support of the Hanafi party by anathematizing the favored theology of its principal rival, the Shafi'is.67 By the middle of the eleventh cen- tury, due to an influx of new leadership into the Shafi'i party and official patron- age, it had come to dominate the most important posts in the city. This prepon- derance in power may well have been the cause of the proscription of Ash'ari theology during the years 440/1048 and 455/1063. Over the course of the late tenth and eleventh centuries, Ash'ari theology had been adopted by many members of the Shafi'i party.68 As Ash'ari theology be- came associated with the Shafi'i madhhab, the Shafi'is were able to offer an alternative to the already existing Hanafi-Mu'tazilite nexus, and to the Kar- ramiyya, who had their own synthesis of law and theology. This synthesis, together with the building of madrasas, gave the Shafi'i madhhab a strong and endowed base, and placed them in a predominant position.69 The persecution of Ash'aris launched by Kunduri with the support and encouragement of his Hanafi 65.

Over 400 Shafi'i-Ash'aris were imprisoned or exiled. The persecutions came to an end in 455/1063; but even before that date, Kunduri's policies had been un- dermined by those of his successor, Nizam al-Mulk. The activities and policies of Nizam al-Mulk are well known.7' Unlike Kun- duri, who had tried to build his power by exploiting the rivalry of the madhhabs, Nizam al-Mulk practiced tolerance and supported both factions, chiefly the Shafi'is, probably because Kunduri had favored the Hanafis. While he did not cease to support Hanafis, he was primarily a patron of the Shafi'i-Ash'ari party. He actively supported Shafi'is in Nishapur and built the first Nizamiyya madrasa in 1059 or 1060. He appointed the foremost Shafi'i-Ash'ari of Nishapur, Imam al-Haramayn Juwayni, as director and professor of law. Nizam al-Mulk's patron- age enabled the Shafi'is to regain a position of power in Nishapur. By the second third of the eleventh century, the Saljuqs were patronizing Hanafis and Shafi'is, but especially Shafi'is and their institutions in Nishapur. During the same century, the Shafi'i madhhab further increased its strength and organiza- tional base by its absorption of the Karrami institution of the khanaqah and its adoption of a moderate form of Sufi piety. Up until the late tenth century, the khanaqa-h in Khurasan had been almost ex- clusively associated with the Karramiya.72 Over the course of the eleventh cen- tury, the khdnaqach in Khurasan became increasingly linked with Sufism, in par- ticular the Sufism of the Shafi'i madhhab. During the first half of the eleventh century, there was an increase in the founding and organization of kha-naqahs in Nishapur. Sufis, in particular those belonging to the Shafi'i madhhab, began to be identified with them. The Sufi Abu 'Abd al-Rahman al-Sulami (d. 412/1021), for example, had a kha-naqa-h (sometimes referred to as a duwayra), and Abu'l-Qasim 'Abd al-Karim al-Qushayri's (d. 465/1072) master, 'Ali al-Daqqaq, built one in 391/1001.73 Qushayri also had a duwayra where he trained disciples in Sufism. Qushayri's disciple Abu 'Ali al-Farmadhi spent time in this establishment.74 The Sufi Abu Sa'id b. Abi Khayr founded a number of khanaqahs and composed the first 70. This attempt on the part of a governmental official to enforce religious doctrine is reminiscent of the attempt of the Caliph Ma'mun, in the ninth century, to enforce adherence to Mu'tazilite theology. Kunduri's attempt to dictate religious matters was also ultimately unsuccessful. 71. For the policies of Nizam al-Mulk see Makdisi, "Muslim Institutions," 1-56. 72.

These communal residences often belonged to a Sufi and his family, such as the khanaqdh of the Sulami family, but they sometimes were part of the property or foundation of a donor who placed them at the disposal of the Sufis.76 Later, dur- ing the second half of the eleventh century, Saljuq officials began to found and patronize khanaqahs.77 In addition to founding a number of madrasas, Nizam al-Mulk also founded a string of kha-naqa-hs throughout the Saljuq domains. In Isfahan, for example, he appointed the director of a khanaqaih and each year the director would present the needs of the khdnaqdh to him.78 It seems likely that a policy similar to his regarding the madrasa was evolving, that is, he was at- tempting to gain influence and control over an important group within the con- quered population (in this case the Sufis) through patronage of its institutions and usurpation of its administrative autonomy. In the course of the late tenth and eleventh centuries Sufism was integrated into the Shafi'i madhhab. Sufis in Nishapur were almost exclusively Shafi'i, and the spread of Sufism was linked to its connection with the Shafi'i madhhab.79 As Sufism became intertwined with the activities, practices, and institutions of the Shafi'i ulama, Sufis who were 'aclims were able to provide institutional as well as literary support for Sufism.80 Association with the Shafi'i madhhab provided Sufism with an organizational framework, a greater degree of legitimacy, and a share in patronage. Another impetus for the coalescence of moderate Sufism and the Shafi'i madhhab may have been antipathy to the Karramiyya.81 The Sufi piety that Shafi'i-Sufis such as Sulami and Qushayri practiced was linked to the "sober" Sufism (sahw) of Junayd rather than the "intoxicated" Sufism (sukr) of Mansur al-Hallaj (d. 75.

Munawwar describes one such foundation in his biography of the Sufi Abu Sa'id. After meeting Abu Sa'id, a wealthy man bought a house which he transformed into a khanaqah. He then installed forty Sufis in it (Asrdr al-tawhid, 180-81). 77. See the evidence assembled in A. Bausani, "Religion in the Saljuq Period," Cam- bridge History of Iran 5:300; s.v.

Bulliet has compiled a chart from two extant biographical dictionaries from me- dieval Nishapur that lists both the terms used to describe mystics and, where possi- ble, their legal affiliation. The Histories of Nishapur lists no Hanafis or Karramis as Sufis, only Shafi'is (Patricians of Nishapur, 41-2). 80. In addition, at this time Sufis began to develop their own institutions and struc- tures of authority. These matters are discussed at greater length in M. Malamud, "Sufi Institutions and Structures of Authority in Medieval Nishapur," International Journal of Middle East Studies 26 (1994): 427-42. 81.

The Sufism of these prominent Shafi'i-Ash'ari-Sufis stressed active in- volvement in social life and scrupulous adherence to law rather than rejection of society and adoption of antinomian behavior. These Sufis disapproved of exces- sive tawakkul and faqr and favored trade, manual labor, and kasb. The radical piety and excessive and ostentatious devotions of the Karramiyya diverged from the more moderate and bourgeois character of the piety of the Sufis. Shafi'i-Sufi piety accommodated the commerce of the middle- and upper-class elites and also appealed to the bazaar and working-class population. The Kar- ramiyya appealed to a different audience: the urban and rural poor and those dis- satisfied with the views and positions of the other communal associations. The organization and popularity of the Karramiyya may have spurred other factions and groups to become more organized.82 Indeed, the period in which Sufism be- came affiliated with the Shafi'i madhhab overlapped with the period when the Karramiyya reached a peak of power and influence in Nishapur. Conclusion The Karramiyya were condemned as heretics by nearly all the sources that discuss them. Some accused them of bizarre and inflammatory beliefs. Ibn Da'i, for ex- ample, maintained that Ibn Karram had taught that homosexual relations with non-Muslims constituted acts of worship ('iba-dat).83 Although criticism of them was couched mainly in theological terms, it is possible to discern other, more worldly reasons for the hostility they aroused.84 Karrami piety was radical: it was characterized by severe asceticism, mendicancy, and faqr and tawakkul. Specifically, while many Muslims were able to accom- modate and even advocate commercial profit as pleasing to God, the Karramiyya firmly opposed it. This aspect of Karramiyya piety may partially explain the in- tensity of the enmity they aroused. It is worth noting that the heresiographer Baghdadi, one of the fiercest critics of the Karramiyya, was a wealthy Shafi'i from Nishapur who lived during the period of the Karrami inquisition. The Kar- ramiyya called for material as well as spiritual equality among Muslims, and they appealed to the poor, the disenfranchised, and those unhappy with the values of the other madhhabs. They offered an alternative to the more moderate and frankly commercial character of the Islam being formulated by the urban ulama. Moreover, the Karramiyya were well organized and could provide members a full way of life. The Karramiyya offered, their own synthesis of law, theology, and mysticism. Karrami strength resided in the large number of converts and urban poor who were members, and in the occasional patronage which they received from foreign elites. They were well organized; they had their own khdnaqahs and madrasas in which they could promulgate their doctrines. During the tenth 82. Ibid., esp. 48-54.' 83.

As we have seen, Turkish rulers experimented with patronizing different madh- habs as a means of administering and controlling their newly conquered tem'to- ries. During the late tenth and early eleventh centuries, the Ghaznavids sup- ported first the Hanafis and then the Karramis. When a member of the Karramiyya held the office of riya-sa, leading Hanafi's and Shafi'is were perse- cuted. Official patronage of the Karramiyya increased factional strife in Nishapur and upset the balance of local politics, and the Ghaznavids were forced to with- draw their support. A persecution of the Karramiyya ensued, and their power was effectively broken. Saljuq rulers and their Persian officials recognized that Hanafis and Shafi'is could agree on at least one issue: the Karramiyya must not be allowed to regain power and influence. The Saljuqs supported the Hanafi and Shafi'i madhhabs, but not the Karramiyya. By the end of the eleventh century, the Karramiyya in Khurasan had been virtu- ally annihilated.85 The shared antipathy of Hanafis and Shafi's, the increasing strength of the Shafi'i madhhab, and the loss of the patronage of the Turkish rulers and their Persian officials all contributed to their decline. The Karrami vision of Islam failed to take permanent hold, and they were labeled heretics by other Muslims. Perhaps they might best be seen as exemplars of a particular style of Islam which was marginalized in favor of one which successfully joined otherworldliness to urban commercial social life and organization. The Hanafi, and especially the Shafi'i, schools continued to flourish. Indeed, the synthesis of Shafi'i law, Ash'ari theology, and sober Sufism that makes up Abu Hamid al-Ghazali's famous Ihya' 'ulum al-din was one that a number of Shafi'i ulama in Nishapur had adopted in the late tenth and the eleventh centuries. The combination of law, moderately mystical piety, and theology that this group of urban notables practiced was one that found a wide audience among other groups of Muslims throughout the Middle East.
