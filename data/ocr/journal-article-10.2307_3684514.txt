<plain_text><page sequence="1">STRUCTURES of MOBILITY and IMMOBILITY in the CINEMA of ALAIN ROBBE- GRILLET William F Van Wert Perhaps the most fruitful way to approach a cinema as revolutionary as that of Alain Robbe-Grillet is through its structures, which are purely descriptive and spatial, not nar- rative and temporal. In a cinema which attempts to be realis- tic (objective), the camera attempts to see without being seen (through actor movement choreographed with camera move- ment, through continuity both in the narrative and in the editing). Through "self-effacement", the camera aspires to authenticity; its principal role, in this respect, is that of a recorder of reality which is exterior to the camera. By contrast, the principal protagonist in any Robbe-Grillet film is the camera itself: a camera which emphasizes its own pre- sence in the composition of every shot, in the movement from one shot to another. It is precisely through this deliberate- ly self-conscious and stylized camera that narrative and tem- porality are replaced by description in space. In other words, a camera that purposefully emphasizes itself also emphasizes structure; in so doing, it emphasizes its own subjectivity, its own fiction. The structurally subjective camera is, thus, as perceptive, as capricious, as fallible and as suspect as the human eye, or more appropriately, the human mind. By tra- cing the structures of mobility and immobility in the films of Robbe-Grillet, we can understand the relationship between point of view and time, which are so important in any of his films. If we take some examples of such devices in American films, we can better appreciate how Robbe-Grillet has revolu- tionized them. Freeze-frame dissolves are used frequently in Orson Welles' Citizen Kane (1941). One example is that of the group portrait of the Tribune staff, which, through such a dissolve, becomes animated, becomes the new staff of the Kane paper. Welles uses the freeze-frame dissolve most often for continu- ity in editing. At one point in the film, Emily tells Kane that she is going, not to Susan Alexander's, but rather to 79 SUB-STANCE No 9, 1974</page><page sequence="2">80 William F. Van Wert house number 185 on Susan's street. The next visual is one of the number 185 above the door frame. After the confrontation between Kane, Emily, Susan and Geddes in Susan's apartment, the scene concludes with the departure of Geddes and Emily. The camera moves up and in on the number 185. Freeze frame. When the camera moves back again, we see that the visual has become the picture accompanying the headline of the rival news- paper: "Candidate caught in singer's love nest." The freeze frame here enforces two of the film's main themes: (1) that all jcurnalism is ironic and at best a half-truth, and (2) that Kane is as much a victim of circumstance (destiny) as he is the shaper and manipulator of the destinies of others. The freeze frame is the transition between action and reaction, between the interior level of unfolding dramatic action and the exterior (authorial) level of the news accounts of that action or its consequences, and finally between characters as masters of their fate and characters as pawns of a larger fate. The freeze frame, which "fixes" a scene and transforms it into another, is that device which most closely corresponds to the film's theme that no ultimate truth (objective truth) can be gained, only hypotheses for the meaning of Kane's dying words. The freeze frame is the device by which the film skirts all of the different levels of reality without calling too much atten- tion to itself (camera as functional instrument). In Robbe-Grillet the freeze frame accomplishes just the reverse: characters are deliberately and even artificially caught in mid-action, frozen in geometrical or architectural poses, immobilized, as it were, in the "mind's eye" of the camera-protagonist (N. in L'Annie Derniere ' Marienbad, Andre Varais in L'Immortelle, Robbe-Grillet the actor and Elias/Trin- tignant in Trans-Europe Express, Boris in L'Homme Qui Ment, and Violette in L'Eden et Apres), whose shifting point of view approximates, and often becomes, that of other characters in the films (the fusion of N. and A. in L'Annee Derniere ' Mar- ienbad, the fusion of N. (Andr6) and Lale in L'ImmorteZZlle, the fusion of Boris Varissa and Jean Robin in L'Homme Qui Ment). By calling attention to itself through the freeze frames, the camera-mind accomplishes several objectives: the presentation of obsessional images that stem from reality but that trans- form reality into mental ritual by destroying the structural indicators of exterior reality, dream, imagination and lie; the total breakdown of traditional narrative into fictional description, in which certain moments privilZgies (images) take psychic priority over others and thus solidify, become frozen; the transformation of traditional narrative continuity through editing from an exterior function (with the express purpose of "telling", of providing the spectator with links between images) to an interiorized editing, that is, an edit- ing that functions as the mind of the protagonist,. and that calls the credibility of that mind into question; that demands, thus, a more active participation on the part of the spectator who must "reconstruct" the film at the time of viewing; a pro-</page><page sequence="3">Robbe-Grillet: Structures of Mobility and Immobility 81 cess which can only be accomplished by becoming one with the camera-mind. Robbe-Grillet, thus, appears to be the first commercial cineaste to explore the possibilities of immobility, both ob- jectively and subjectively, in film. (I discount the experi- ments in immobility of Andy Warhol, because they must be read at the level of denotation; they lack the multiplicity of read- ing levels and the pluridimensionality of meaning to be found in Robbe-Grillet). It is ironic that film's greatest advan- tage over photography is also its greatest disadvantage: that is, motion itself. Motion by definition implies sequential and spatial relationships. It is in terms of motion that film has been constrained (immobilized) with the responsibility of capturing "reality". It is because of film's ability to re- cord motion that film's point of view has most often been ob- jective and omniscient, that subjective point-of-view camera often goes unnoticed, most spectators continuing to read the image as denotative and objective (physically real) and not as connotative and subjective (mental projection of the protago- nist), unless the image itself is tampered with (thus, des- troying its denotative capacity) by using such subjectivity indicators as gradual fades and dissolves, blurred images, su- perimpositions and multiple exposures, or the use of unusual angles -- extreme low- or high-angle shots -- or unusual len- ses -- the use of extreme wide-angle lens or extreme telephoto lens; and that filmic time is tyrannized and kept in the limbo of an artificial but eternal "present": La caractfristique essentielle de l'image est sa presence. Alors que la litterature dispose de,toute une gamme de temps grammaticaux, qui permet de sit- uer les 6venements les uns par rapport aux autres, on peut dire que, sur l'image, les verves sont tou- jours au present : de toute evidence, ce que l'on voit sur l'ecran est EN TRAIN DE SE PASSER, c'est le geste meme qu'on nous donne, et non pas un rap- port sur lui.1 The use of freeze frames and other devices of immobilization in Robbe-Grillet's films all attempt to break away from these traditional properties of film. It is in light of the preceding observations that Robbe- Grillet asserts that to see (for the camera-protagonist) is to immobilize, to fixate, to desire a cessation of movement: Lui il est li, il regarde ga, et j'ai l'impression qu'on sent naltre chez lui le d6sir d'arreter ga... Cet homme qu'on voit dans mes romans et dans mes films, c'est quelqu'un qui effectivement a besoin de voir et d'immobiliser, les deux choses 6tant constamment li~es.2 What Robbe-Grillet asserts is that we transpose memorable</page><page sequence="4">82 William F. Van Wert cinematographic images into mental photographs. We fixate in order to remember. "Voir, c'est d'abord reconnaltre", says Robbe-Grillet. And each "fixed" scene belongs to a very com- plex pattern of repetitions, circularity, interior duplica- tions, hidden correspondences, serializations and even meta- morphoses. Through fixed scenes, Robbe-Grillet imprints, as we might speak of a repeated refrain of music becoming im- printed in us. He structurally creates in us a sense of shared voyeurism, while at the same time he stresses the subjective state of his camera-narrator: Les personnages appel6s sadiques dans mes romans ont toujours ceci de particulier qu'ils essaient d'immobiliser quelque chose qui bouge.3 We must analyze these fixed scenes as we should analyze fixed scenes in Robbe-Grillet's novels: the sailor walking across the dock in Les Gommes, the fixing of the centipede in La Jalousie, the repeated and pluridimensional tableau scene expressed in "La D6faite de Reichenfels" in Dans le labyrinthe. In other words, we must read these scenes cross-referentially, as one would read the text of a poem that builds upon itself: thus, the shattered glass becomes related to the broken balus- trade in L'Annee Derniere ' Marienbad. In the same film, the configuration of the Nim game is repeated, that is, cross- indexed with the fixed scene of the guests in frozen poses in the garden and with the torn note of the heroine, the shreds of which she rearranges into the configuration of the Nim game. In the same way, the "game" structures the reading of L'Eden et Apres as a cinematic text: characters who play the game are themselves the game. Thus, the form is an anagram, in which the spectator must reconstruct sequential development, since all rules are to be invented and all combinations are probable: Les cartes sont distribu6es sans indication d'ordre, mais c'est une invitation a une mise en ordre, c'est-A-dire a une organisation structur6e des th~mes qui sont pergus au d6but comme sans lien. Ainsi s'affirme la gratuite du jeu, le seul sens de l'oeuvre 6tant le mouvement que trace le film. Pour cette raison, tout est present dans le g6n6- rique : themes, formes, couleurs, sons, voix des acteurs, mots qui s'integreront dans le recit de Violette. Il ne reste plus qu'1 jouer en inven- tant la r~gle du jeu.4 Fixed scenes, thus, construct the mise-en-abime form of each of his films. The opening freeze frames and dissolves in L'Immor- telle are in the same way a preview of coming attractions: they telescope the whole film into a succinct mental montage. The freeze frames all involve the woman most often called Lale;</page><page sequence="5">Robbe-Grillet: Structures of Mobility and Immobility 83 they portray her in different costumes and in different lo- cales. There is one exception: an extreme close-up of her enigmatic face. The distinguishing feature of this and all of Robbe-Grillet's freeze frames and fixed poses is that it mul- tiplies while duplicating itself, because he varies the spatial and thematic context. Thus, this particular close-up will re- appear when Lale is lying half-undressed on the couch of the protagonist and again at the scene of the accident when her head is slumped back against the seat. Indeed, all of the freeze-frame dissolves which open the film reoccur many times in the film. In each of them, with the exception of the close- up, Lale is dressed in a specific costume and situated in a specific locale, as we have already said. For example, we come to associate the tiger-striped blouse with one bare shoulder as belonging to the boat with the white tires on the railing. Consequently, we can read the film structurally (cross-refer- ence) in the following way: each time that a costume such as this is seen in a different locale, we can presuppose that we are dealing with a lie, a failure in memory, pure imagination or a hallucination fausse, whereas if the costume fits the preestablished landscape, we recognize an hallucination vraie. Whereas freeze frames are the property of the interven- ing, reconstructing camera, there are other devices of immo- bility within the frame itself, that is, in the jeu of the actors. The equivalent of a freeze frame can be found in the very stiff and rigid acting demanded of all Robbe-Grillet's actors. This style of acting, which has so little to do with representation, is most often referred to as stilted, awkward, lifeless or perhaps even expressionistic. Robbe-Grillet is aware of this, as is clear in his explanation of the relation- ship between point of view and required acting for the narra- tor-protagonist of L'Immortelle: Pourquoi un N.? Sans doute est-ce pour indiquer sa position tris particulibre dans le r6cit, qui est un peu comparable A celle du NARRATEUR dans un roman moderne : narrateur qui ne "raconte" rien, mais par les yeux de qui tout est imagin6. Et c'est 1A ce qui lui donne, lorsqu'il est pre- sent sur l'6cran, cet aspect a la fois vide et gauche, qui n'est 6videmment pas celui d'un "heros" de cinema. De m~me se trouve-t-il le plus souvent, quant au cadrage, au montage, etc., en 6tat d'erreur technique ou de mala- dresse.5 Thus, even when visibly ("objectively") shown by the camera, the protagonist shares with that camera the role of sensory filter. It is as if we never really see the real narrator which is the recording lens. If this is true, then the N. that we see in L'Immortelle exists only in the mind of the un- seen but all-seeing camera-protagonist, just as much as the</page><page sequence="6">84 William F. Van Wert Lale that we see exists only in his mind, as she herself tells us. In this way we can interpret scenes in which main charac- ters dialogue, that is, move or animate against a backdrop of objects and other people -- all fixed or frozen. In L'Immor- tetle, N. (Andre) is talking about Lgle with Catrine in a cafe. All of the other men in the caf6 are as if painted in a tableau. Catrine verbally evokes the Turkey of post-cards and dreams at this point, speaking of kidnappings, murders, secret prisons and kept women. Against no other backdrop could this poetic interiorized landscape be believed, for it alone allows a multiplicity of connotative reading levels to develop, all of which are contradictory, all of which are probable. I would here suggest two of those possible readings: (1) the immobilized men of the backdrop are, nevertheless, still ac- tive in their listening and are suspiciously connected with the kidnappings, murders, secret prisons and kept women: thus, they are real and exist independently of N. and Catrine; or (2) all takes place in the mind of N. who imagines Catrine saying these things. In other words, it is N. who, although seemingly helpless in this strange land, is nevertheless in complete control, in that the land and everything in it is a product of his own imagination. It is as if the scene pre- sents us with a "room" which is the inside of the protagon- ist's head, a mirrored image of the camera-mind. Thus, the men in the backdrop may either be seen as in (1) but with this new restriction on point of view, or they may be seen as imagi- nary beings who lie dormant because they have not as yet been called into action by the camera-mind. Because both of these readings depend on point of view, the denotative level of the image is neither impaired nor destroyed in either. It is in this same context that actors' directional looks must be interpreted. On this subject, Peter Wollen has asser- ted the following: an actor may look at another actor who may or may not return that look or he may look at the camera and thus indirectly at the spectator, but actor and spectator may never look directly at each other; the camera may look at an actor who may or may not return that look, but the camera may never directly look at the spectator; and the spectator, for his part, may never look directly at either, since the camera is the mediator between the spectator and actor and since that camera is never visible to the spectator (although the illusion of its visibility can sometimes be created through the use of a second camera).6 Wollen further asserts that these looks are always related to point of view and temporality. This brief explanation (which hardly does justice to Wol- len's thesis) can serve as a basis for "reading" what seem to be enigmatic structures of mobility and immobility. For ins- tance, there is a "fixed" mise-en-abime shot in L'Immortelle in which the protagonist seats Lale at a table in a club, while a burlesque dancer performs on stage. The camera-mind "com- poses" (point of view) the shot in such a way that the dancer's bared back is mirrored (duplicated) by Lale's bared back. The</page><page sequence="7">Robbe-Grillet: Structures of Mobility and Immobility 85 protagonist and Lale both look at the dancer, the backs of all three being turned to the camera; the protagonist strokes L^le's neck, and we know that this is a mental transference and that he is really stroking the provocative dancer's neck at whom he is looking (denotatively with his eyes, connotatively with his mind). That the image is fixed and frozen from the point of view of the protagonist is reinforced by the counter- point between image track and sound track which follows. We must keep in mind that the music of the dancer continues unin- terrupted throughout the series of shots which ensue. We cut associatively from the club to outdoors. The posture of N. and Lale are the same, except that now they are facing the camera (yet not looking at each other). N.'s hand is still on L^le's neck. She says: "It's not a real scene. It's backcloth for a love story." (which could refer to the outdoors scene, to the club scene which continues via the soundtrack,or to the whole film). He attempts to embrace her, and she protests that the scene is too public. He replies: "What does it matter, if these are not real houses?" He looks up as someone who has been watching them quickly closes a window curtain. Cut to N. as curtain closes. N. turns back to L^le, who now (in the apartment of N.) does the dance of the burlesque dancer, whose music has continued all this time on the soundtrack. We must not forget that this whole sequence began with a poster of the dancer on a pillar in the market place, the sight of which triggered this whole mental montage in the mind of the camera- protagonist. If the counterpoint between the image track and the sound track does not alert the spectator to the imaginary quality of the scene, then the fact that the two protagonists never look directly at each other should be sufficient proof. The same mise-en-abime (structure of immobility) operates in all of Robbe-Grillet's films, from the play in L'Annie Derni're a Marienbad to the chained-woman act in Trans-Europe Express. To conclude with this point of cinematic looks, we might fur- ther mention that in every scene in which the protagonist and heroine of L'Annee Derniere ' Marienbad discuss whether it was at Marienbad or not and whether it was last year or not (time and space linked to point of view in both characters, both con- flicting, both probable), they never look at each other. Ei- ther they are facing opposite directions (for instance, his back is to us as he leans on the balustrade and looks out on the garden while she leans against the balustrade and faces the camera) or else they are both facing the same way but look- ing in opposite directions (he looks off to one edge of the frame while she looks off to another, for instance). It is as if they dialogue to themselves and not with each other. In other words, the only dialogue that takes place is most likely that in the "memory" of the protagonist-camera-narrator. At the same time that immobility "humanizes" the image by render- ing it ambiguous and thus subjective, it also dehumanizes hu- man beings by returning them to the whole organic landscape of the frame, by making them nio more animate or inanimate than</page><page sequence="8">86 William F. Van Wert the objects to be found in this landscape (see, in connection with this, Robbe-Grillet's attack on anthropomorphic adjec- tives in Pour un nouveau roman). Thus, all three -- intervening camera, stylized actors and objects of obsession -- contribute to Robbe-Grillet's structures of immobility. The most obvious objects of fixa- tion and immobility are those that spring from the graphic arts, in which motion is fixed, captured, printed and imprint- ed: magazines, photographs, post cards and paintings. While they are actualized denotatively within the image, these ob- jects must also be seen in terms of the protagonist's point of view, that is,as mental projections. Indeed, they often func- tion as concrete mirrors or leitmotiv fetishes for the camera- protagonist: Charniere, c'est vers lui que convergent les divers evenements : miroir, il met en 6vidence et solli- cite les correspondances.7 Just as a mirror in a Robbe-Grillet film provides a fixed im- age (motion arrested) and a subjective mise-en-abime (through character duplication: when N. in L'ImmorteZZe looks at him- self in the mirror, what we actually see is the camera-prota- gonist looking at himself looking at himself -- without redun- dancy), so too with these objects: the multiplied photographs of A. in L'Annee Derniere ' Marienbad, the repetitive and mul- tiplied post cards and photographs of the mosques and of Lale in an already imagined pose in those mosques in L'Immortelle, the various sadistic magazine photos which are then realized (actualized, made real through scenes involving motion) and the post card "clues" which become realized as Elias inhabits them in Trans-Europe Express. These objects fulfill the same function of mise-en-abime that the tableau of "La Defaite de Reichenfels" and the portrait of the soldier fulfill in Dans Ze labyrinthe. Characters become tableaux (immobilized), while objects take on life (anti-anthropomorphism). In the mind's eye of the camera-protagonist, everything is equally organic or inorganic, depending upon the particular moment's (the par- ticular image's) point of view. Structures of immobility do not exist independently of the structures of mobility in Robbe-Grillet's films, precisely because of the constantly shifting point of view. If I have isolated first one and then the other, it is only for the pur- pose of clarifying each before showing their interrelation- ships. As I have done with the structures of immobility, I now propose to treat the structures of mobility in terms of the intervening camera and editing, the actors themselves and the landscape surrounding them. It should come as no surprise at this point that the use of "mobile" camera (tracking or dolly shots, zooms, pans, tilts, reverse pans, etc.) in Robbe-Grillet is the exact oppo- site of that in most films, with the possible exception of that in theory and in the films of an extremely important American</page><page sequence="9">Robbe-Grillet: Structures of Mobility and Immobility 87 filmmaker -- Maya Deren. An understanding of Maya Deren's theories and practical application of those theories in her films is the best introduction that I know of to the films of Robbe-Grillet.8 Deren conceived of film as a form of poetry (description) to be contrasted with dramatic forms like theater (narrative). She based her conception and distinction between the two at the level of structure: The distinction of poetry is its construction (what I mean by a "poetic structure"), and the poetic con- struct arises from the fact, if you will, that it is a "vertical" investigation of a situation, in that it probes the ramifications of the moment, and is concerned with its qualities and its depth, so that you have poetry concerned, in a sense, not with what is occurring but with what it feels like or what it means. A poem, to my mind, creates vis- ible or auditory forms for something that is invis- ible, which is the feeling, or the emotion, or the metaphysical content of the movement.9 The distinction, then, is that between "vertical" and "hori- zontal" developmentl0 whose definitions embrace such cinemato- graphic techniques as associative editing and counterpoint be- tween the image track and the sound track, techniques that we have already seen in detail in the films of Robbe-Grillet: Whereas, in what is called a "horizontal" devel- opment the logic is a logic of actions, in a "vertical" development, it is a logic of a central emotion or idea that attracts to itself even dis- parate images which contain that central core, which they have in common.11 We can see, then, that both Deren's and Robbe-Grillet's films are to be read along the lines of "vertical" development (spa- tial, poetic description with multiple shifts in point of view and time as opposed to a linear, sequential narrative with a more or less continuous time frame and little or no point of view). Deren perceptively notes that many recognizable se- quence structures (establishing sequences, bracket sequences, episodic sequences, etc.)12 are the momentary equivalents of vertical development in most narrative films with horizontal development: It seems to me that in many films, very often in the opening passages, you get the camera estab- lishing the mood, and, when it does that, cine- matically, those sections are quite different from the rest of the film. You know, if it's establishing New York, you get a montage of im- ages, that is, a poetic construct, after which</page><page sequence="10">88 William F. Van Wert what follows is a dramatic construct that is essentially "horizontal" in its development. The same thing would apply to the dream sequences. They occur at a moment when the intensification is carried out not by action but by the illumi- nation of that moment.13 Thus, according to Deren's definition, the famous episodic se- quence of the breakfast table in Citizen Kane would be an ex- ample of vertical development in an otherwise horizontally constructed film. The reverse is true in her films, as well as in those of Robbe-Grillet. Deren concludes by saying that the poetic construct in film must ultimately derive from the complex but rewarding counterpoint arrangement between the im- age track and the sound track: You see, the way the words are used in films most- ly derives from the theatrical tradition in which what you see makes the sound you hear. And so, in that sense, they would be redundant in film if they were used as a further projection from the image. However, if they were brought in on a different level, not issuing from the image, which should be complete in itself, but as another dimension relating to it, then it is the two things together that make the poem. It's almost as if you were standing at a window and looking into the street, and there are children playing hopscotch. Well, that's your visual experience. Behind you, in the room, are women discussing hats or something, and that's your auditory ex- perience. You stand at the place where these two come together by virtue of your presence. What relates these two moments is your position in relation to the two of them. They don't know about each other, and so you stand by the window and have a sense of afternoon, which is neither the children in the street nor the women talking behind you but a curious combination of both, and that is your resultant image...14 Deren, thus, emphasizes the importance of both time and point of view. Her "vertical" development is a time logic, in that it explores the moment in depth, putting aside questions of succession or simultaneity. Her definition of counterpoint depends totally upon the spatialized, personalized point of view of the sensory filter, that is, of the camera-mind: "You stand at the place where these two come together by virtue of your presence. What relates these two moments is your posi- tion in relation to the two of them." It is precisely this positioning, this spatialized point of view, that frees film of the domination of the present tense, that allows new</page><page sequence="11">Robbe-Grillet: Structures of Mobility and Immobility 89 (interiorized) experiments in temporality, and that produces the ritualistic quality in her films and in those of Robbe- Grillet: Now on the basis of the fourth (film), I feel that all the other elements must be retained, but that special attention must be given to the creative possibilities of Time, and that the form as a whole should be ritualistic.15 We could, thus, expect to find structures of mobility and immobility in the films of Maya Deren which would parallel those in the films of Robbe-Grillet. In her film Ritual in Transfigured Time (1946), freeze frames (and other elements of immobility or fixation achieved through editing) structure the whole text. For example, the quality of ritual is brought out in the choreographed "dance", in which men and women, their arms outstretched, move as if driven by the wind (slow-motion photography), momentarily touch each other and then move on. This movement is often arrested through the use of freeze frames. The male dancer becomes a statue through the use of a freeze frame, then "comes to life" again to chase the woman in slow motion (while she runs ahead in "regular" motion: the paradox here is that he catches her; a similar space-time pa- radox is achieved in her Meshes of the Afternoon (1943), in which the Deren figure, running at "regular" speed, chases a hooded figure with a mirror for a face and a flower in its hand, and even though the hooded figure proceeds in slow mo- tion, the Deren figure can never catch up). But even more im- portant than these parallels in the two cineastes' use -of freeze frames is their radically innovative use of the mobile camera. It goes without saying that, through a restructuring of filmic space (editing), there is a reintegration of filmic time with that space. For example, Deren explains the paradox of continuity (fluid actors' movements, associative editing) through discontinuity (fragmentation through editing), that is, the paradox of a camera which is both fluid and static, in her film Study in Choreography for Camera: In the film dance which I have made, the dancer begins a large movement -- the lowering of his extended leg -- in a forest. This shot is inter- rupted at the moment when the leg has reached waist level, and is immediately followed by a close-up shot of the leg in a continuation of its movement -- with the location now the interior of a house. The integrity of the time element -- the fact that the tempo of the movement is continuous and that the two shots are, in editing, spliced to follow one another without interruption -- holds together spatial areas which are not, in reality,</page><page sequence="12">90 William F. Van Wert so related. Instead of being destructive to a dramatic integrity, the mobility of the camera and the interruption and resumption of action, here creates an integrity as compelling as that of the theatre, but of a totally different qual- ity.16 Thus, time is freed from the present tense by making space flu- id (irrational, if read denotatively; rational, if read as a mental projection from the point of view of the camera-mind). The process is achieved through duplication of character, and it may occur in a single pan, as it does in Study in Choreo- graphy for Camera: The camera pans past a dancer in the woods only to encounter him again before that pan has stopped. He dances from the woods into a living room and then an art museum in one fluid movement ... it is a slow-motion running jump through irrationally connected spaces within a more or less rational time. 17 or it may occur (as a mise-en-abime) within the composition of the frame itself, as it does in the same film: There is a metaphor in the film.....Just before the dancer leaps out of the museum, there is a close- up of his spinning head. In the corner of the screen there is also an Indian statue, a Janus- headed bodhisattva. The implied metaphor identi- fies the dancer, whose twirling head seems to face all directions at the same time, with the statue and relates to the theme of the ambiguity of space (here, direction). More important than the force of the metaphor itself is that it is a "composi- tional" metaphor -- one made by framing rather than by interrupting the action/image with super- imposition or intercutting.18 The duplication of the dancer within the same pan in Deren is a frequent device of the mobile camera in Robbe-Grillet. The effects of such duplications are twofold: (1) "a slow-motion running jump through irrationally connected spaces within a more or less rational time", that is, a new temporality estab- lished, independent of the present tense, and which presents mental time (memory, imagination, dream, false memory or lie) in a much more "realistic" way than traditional "horizontal" means of presenting such devices as flashbacks or dream se- quences; and (2) a point of view which is both denotative and connotative, which is both objective and subjective, which is both destructive and constructive, and which parallels the je-ndant point of view in novels like La Jalousie and Dans Ze</page><page sequence="13">Robbe-Grillet: Structures of Mobility and Immobility 91 labyrinthe. Chris Marker's experiments in temporality in La Jet"e (1963) could serve as a good parallel to the structures of mobility and immobility as they relate to the new temporality in Robbe-Grillet. Marker's film is constructed almost entire- ly of photo-stills, which by their very nature convey a sense of past time much more effectively than a running film could. Thus, we revere photographs which were taken in the 1920's, because they have preserved forever the arrested moment (the past), whereas we often see films made in the 1920's as strik- ingly contemporary, because they transform that past moment in- to a moving (motion picture) eternal present. Robbe-Grillet's structures of immobility carry the same valeur affective as the photo-stills in Marker, with the added advantage that they also convey the point of view of the personalized camera-protagonist. This point of view is not to be confused with the tradition- al use of subjective point-of-view camera, which implies that camera movement is to be seen as belonging to the vision of a single character within the film. For example, in L'Annee Derniere ' Marienbad we see A. fixed in the gaze of N. N.'s gaze then travels (mobile camera) the length of the room and comes to rest on A. again, only this time she is in different costume; Or we may see A.'s gaze encircle the room, only to come to rest upon herself at the other end, in different costume, facing the camera, as if meeting the gaze of the first A. These are obviously not traditional examples of point of view camera or even traditional examples of mobile camera: a new temporal- ity enters in, because these shots must be interpreted from the point of view of the je-neant camera-narrator. Just as the dancer was duplicated (while continuing his movement) within the same pan in Maya Deren's film, so too N. and Lale are seen in triplicate on a bridge within the same continuous pan shot in L'Immortelle. At one point in the same film, we see N. and L^le emerge from a sea-tunnel in a small row-boat or canoe. The camera moves in the same direction as the small craft only at a faster rate; that is, the camera pulls back to reveal N. and Lale in the small craft in long shot to the right rear edge of the frame, while within the same frame we now see N. and Lale facing the scene (their backs are turned to us) in the left forefront edge of the frame -- in the big boat with the white tires on the railings. In other words, the mobile camera es- tablishes a new temporality by reaffirming point of view: when we first see N. and Lle emerge from the tunnel in the small craft, we see them as if from the point of view of the imperson- al observing (recording) camera, but when the camera pulls back to reveal N. and Lale within the same frame, on a different visual plane, and in a different boat with different costumes, it is as if they were watching themselves in the small craft, as if the first shot were only visible from the point of view of the two characters mentally projecting that shot. If this is so, then from what angle of vision, from what moment in time and from whose point of view do we now see the second pair of N. and Lale? The answer of course is simple: from the point</page><page sequence="14">92 William F. Van Wert of view of the invisible but always visualizing (mentally pro- jecting) camera-protagonist. This particular example is one of many in Robbe-Grillet's films in which the mise-en-abime works in reverse; that is, it proceeds from its smallest part (in which space and time are concrete, objective) and works back- wards, imposing at each larger level or plane a new "reading" upon the first shot. There are, however, as many examples in Robbe-Grillet's films in which this mise-en-abime mobile camera is the means by which not only a new time structure but also a shifting point of view is effected. For example, there are many pans in L'Anne'e Derniere ' Marienbad which seem to begin from the point of view of N. and end from the point of view of X. or even A.. This shifting point of view is something that Rudolph Arnheim praised in Maya Deren's films: The human body drifts through weightless space. Geographic distances give way to new visible connections. There is no practical plot to these films. When two faces look at each other, two minds call on each other.19 His tribute applies equally to the films of Robbe-Grillet, in which geographic distances give way to new visible connections and in which minds call on each other (shifting point of view/ reconstructed temporality). What is remarkable in Robbe-Grillet is that the denotative level of the image is never sacrificed, never weakened (although it may be questioned or contradicted or even incompletely erased by the camera-protagonist, the I who sees all without ever being seen (and because this "I" is never seen, it must ultimately become the spectator)): De meme que le seul temps qui importe est celui du film, le seul "personnage" important est le spectateur; c'est DANS SA TETE que se deroule toute 1'1stoire, qui est exactement IMAGINEE par lui. At the same time that these structures of mobility function as denotation or pure description, they also function as negation of that description, as subjectification of objective reality. Here is where mobility and immobility merge. The city we see in L'ImmortelZe is, on one plane of reality, the real city of Istanbul. On another level it is the poetic reincarnation of Byzantium. At yet another level it is both cities falsified denotatively, as post cards falsify. And at still another level it is both cities falsified connotatively, as we mentally falsi- fy every city that we have ever seen through dream, imagination and memory -- that is, through point of view. This process of affirmation/negation (mobility/immobility) occurs in the coun- terpoint between the "descriptive" traveling shots and the con- structive/destructive sound track of Lile's recitation:</page><page sequence="15">Robbe-Grillet: Structures of Mobility and Immobility 93 Les remparts de Byzance ... Il faut les recon- struire encore une fois ... De la mer de Marmara jusqu'a la corne d'Or vous longez, A perte de vue, la succession des tours ecroul6es ... vers le chateau des Sept Prisons ... mais vous avan- cez au hasard ... Vous etes etranger ... Vous arrivez dans une Turkie de rave ... Fausses prisons, faux remparts, fausses histoires ... Vous ne pouvez plus revenir en arriere ... Et pour vous 6chapper ... Ce sont de faux bateaux, aussi, vous voyez bien.21 Thus, the same image or the same sound track may be repeated but with different results. For example, the "narration" at the beginning of L'Annee Derniere ' Marienbad (which we read denotatively in conjunction with the traveling shot of the interiors of the chateau) is echoed at the film's conclusion (which we read connotatively in conjunction with the traveling shot which becomes "fixed" outside the chateau). In the same way, we are introduced to the city of Istanbul in L'Immortelle through a traveling shot that moves into the city from the out- skirts. We read the images denotatively, as if we were watch- ing a documentary travelogue. Near the film's conclusion the camera retraces its steps, moving from the interior of the city outward, depicting the same ruins along the way. This time we read the images connotatively (as mental projections), for Istanbul, while retaining its identity as Istanbul -- "real" city -- has now become in addition the "Turkey of dreams", the "Turkey of post cards", the Byzantium of legend and myth, and the mind of the camera-protagonist. Thus, what begins as a structure of mobility ends as a structure of fixation or immo- bility. Description replaces narration, process replaces plot, and inherent in all cinematographic images, whether fixed or mobile, are the negations of those images, because they can only be read in terms of the already discussed new temporality and point of view. Thus, the real subject of any Robbe-Grillet film is the true, the false and the make believe, which deny the traditional naturalistic approach to cinema as a recorder of reality, but which do not deny reality itself, in that they force the spectator to reconstruct, to see actively instead of passively: Le vrai, le faux et le faire croire sont devenus plus ou moins le sujet de toute oeuvre moderne; celle-ci, au lieu d'etre un pretendu morceau de realit6, se dv6loppe en tant que r6lexion sur la realit6 (ou sur le peu de realtid, comme on voudra). Elle ne cherche plus a cacher son car- actere necessairement mensonger, en se pr6sentant comme une "histoire vecue."

Van Wert description en litterature : l'image ainsi trait~e (quant aux acteurs, au decor, au montage, dans ses rapports avec le son, etc.) empiche de croire en meme temps qu'elle affirme, comme la description empechait de voir ce qu'elle montrait.22 To date, Robbe-Grillet's films have been largely unsuccessful both artistically (not at the level of creation, but at the level of reception on the part of both critics and mass audiences)and financially. Indeed, Grove Press, which distributes L'Immor- teZZlle and L'Homme Qui Ment in this country, has thus far re- fused to purchase L'Eden et Aprbs for distribution, because of the poor reception of the two earlier films. It is my hope that this study has to some degree answered the criticisms most often aimed at Robbe-Grillet: that his films are static, that his actors are stiff and unnatural, that they are thus lifeless and so boring, that his editing is excessive and ar- bitrary, that his plots are confusing or meaningless. I hope further to have shown that the chosiste critics (Roland Barthes, for example) and the interpretive, subjectivist critics (Andre Gardies, Bruce Morrissette, Ben Stolzfus) are equally wrong in basing their criticism solely on a spatial orientation toward reading the text,23 since, as we have seen in our exploration of the structures of mobility and immobility in Robbe-Grillet's films, the point of view of the camera-mind invites us to wit- ness, not just the spatialization of time, but more appropri- ately the temporalization of space.24 The distinction is cru- cial, for all films, to a certian degree, spatialize time, but few have ever really succeeded in temporalizing space. But with Maya Deren and now with the directors of the "literary" New Wave (Robbe-Grillet, Resnais, Marker, Varda, Colpi, Duras, Cayrol), we are witnessing the birth of a new temporality, not that which has existed in previous films or even in novels, but rather that which exists in the "vertical" development of poetry. Robbe-Grillet's films deserve to be seen ("voir, c'est d'abord reconnaltre"), to be recognized and to be understood, because they represent a preliminary step in the fulfillment of Maya Deren's wish that the cinema ultimately become poetry. As such, his films deserve to be read, as Archibald MacLeish suggests that a poem should be read: A poem should be equal to: Not true.25 Indiana University 1.
