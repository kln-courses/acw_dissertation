<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURATORIAL REPORTS American Art Two popular exhibitions were presented this year in the Henry R. Luce Center for the Study of American Art: "American Pastels in The Metropolitan Museum of Art: 1880-1930," organized by Doreen Bolger and underwritten by Reliance Group Holdings, Inc., and "American Frames," organized by Carrie Rebora and supported by Eli Wilner. American watercolors and drawings were transferred from the Department of Drawings to the Luce Center, where they may be viewed by appointment. On December 1 8 the Museum opened the exhibition "American Paintings from the Manoogian Collection," organized by the Detroit Institute of Arts and the National Gallery of Art and installed at the Metropolitan by Kevin Avery. On April 12 we opened "Masterworks of Louis Comfort Tiffany," organized by the National Museum of Ameri- can Art and installed here by Alice Cooney Frelinghuysen, assisted by Elizabeth DeRosa. In March a gallery of late-nineteenth /early- twentieth-century decorative arts was installed on the ground floor of the American Wing. Mrs. Frelinghuysen published several articles on American glass and ceramics, served as president of the American Ceramic Circle, delivered a variety of public lectures, and taught several classes concerned with glass and ceramics. Morrison Heckscher continued preparations for an exhibition on American rococo design sched- uled to open in 1992, assisted by Frances Bretter. He organized various events for the Friends of the American Wing and the Visiting Committee to the Department of American Decorative Arts with the help of Ellin Rosenzweig. He delivered several lectures at other museums, and served as one of two curatorial representa- tives to the Museum's administrative and budget committees. Peter Kenny continued as department administrator and curator of American metalwork, overseeing preparation for the reinstallation of the stair-hall from the Edwin D. Metcalfe House. This room, thanks to a grant from the Overbrook Foundation, is scheduled to open in September 1991. Frances Gruber Safford continued her intensive research on our collection of American furniture of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries and organized conser- vation and wood analyses ofthat material. She also delivered several lectures on American furniture. Amelia Peck mounted an exhibi- tion, "Pennsylvania Needlework," for the summer of 1989 and completed her book American Quilts and Coverlets in the Metro- politan Museum of Art, to be published in the fall of 1990 to accompany an exhibition. Kevin Avery worked with Marjorie Shelley of Paper Conservation and others on the publication of a Olive Trees at Tivoli by George Inness. American, 1 825-94.

He joined the editorial board of the Metropolitan Mu- seum Journal, lectured widely on American art, published two articles on American panorama painting, and continued to teach at Hunter College. Doreen Bolger delivered the Doris and Harry Rubin Lecture on American Art in September, saw through the press the American pastels book, and organized jointly with Nicolai Cikovsky of the National Gallery of Art a series of lectures entitled "American Art Around 1900," sponsored by Mr. and Mrs. Raymond J. Horowitz and given at both the Metropolitan and the National Gallery. Ms. Bolger accepted the position of curator of paintings and sculpture at the Amon Carter Museum in September 1 989, but she will continue work on important projects instituted here before her departure. Donna Hassler joined the staffon July 1 , 1 989, as curatorial assistant specializing in American sculpture. She participated in several seminars on that subject and pursued research and writing for a catalogue of the Metropolitan's collection of American sculpture of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Ms. Hassler was elected an allied professional member of the National Sculpture Society in January. Dale Johnson continued her work on the exhibition "Tokens of Affection: The Portrait Miniature in America," which will open here in November 1990, accompanied by Mrs. Johnson's new book on the Manney Collection. Carrie Rebora, who joined the staff in September 1989, received her Ph.D. degree from the City University of New York. Stephen Rubin worked on a 1 99 1 exhibition of our American watercolors and continued research on the Museum's sketchbooks by John Singer Sargent. The chairman continued his administrative overview of the departments of American Art, directed the activities of the William Cullen Bryant Fellows, ably assisted by Pamela Hubbard, and worked on a book about Frederic E. Church. It is with sadness that we note the death during the year of two former curators, both of whom contributed significantly to the scholarly life of the departments of American Art, Oswaldo Rodriquez Roque and Natalie Spassky.

Mr. Schimmel, a member ofthe Visiting Committee since 1968, was a wise advisor and friend, loaning objects from his collection whenever asked and contribut- ing with funds for departmental projects. We are deeply apprecia- tive of his friendship, encouragement, and long-time support. The incorporation into the Museum's collection of the gifts from the Norbert Schimmel Trust listed below will be a lasting tribute to the discerning eye, good judgment, and generous spirit of this extraor- dinary gentleman. The year's activities included the reinstallation of late Assyrian reliefs in the Raymond and Beverly Sadder Gallery for Assyrian Art and new displays in an adjacent gallery of seals from the Martin and Sarah Cherkasky Collection and inscribed objects from the 4th-lst millennium b.c. The Charles K. Wilkinson Lectures this year took place on a single day, with speakers on Egyptian, ancient Near Eastern, and Islamic gardens. David Stronach spoke on the ancient Near Eastern garden and its influence on later garden design. Joan Aruz and Zainab Bahrani assisted in the reinstallation activities described above, worked on articles, and gave lectures here and in other cities. Oscar White Muscarella lectured at the Museum on excavations at Hasanlu and at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, on Greek and Oriental cauldrons. The curator spoke at the Detroit Institute of Arts and here on recent develop- ments in ancient Near Eastern art and archaeology and at the Arthur M. Sadder Gallery in Washington D.C. on Sasanian court art. The Museum once again contributed funds to the excavation by David and Joan Oates at Tell Brak in Syria and to a season of work at al-Hiba in southern Iraq under the direction of Donald P. Hansen ofthe Institute of Fine Arts. Funds for the former project came from the Colt Archaeological Institute gift and for the latter from the Adelaide Milton de Groot Fund. Five Museum Fellows joined us for varying lengths of time: Asli Özyar, Dolkun Kamberi, Barbara Porter, Elisabetta Valtz Fino, and F. A. M. Wiggermann. The Hagop Kevorkian Fellow was Abdallah M. Kahil. Our collection of Anatolian ivories is the subject of a study by Elizabeth Simpson, consulting research associate, and Brigitte Bourgeois of the Musée du Louvre. Two new curatorial staff members joined the department this year: Dr. Joan Aruz as assistant curator and Dr. Zainab Bahrani as curatorial assistant. Holly Pittman, who had been on the staff for fourteen years, accepted the position of associate professor in the Department ofthe History of Art, University of Pennsylvania. We wish her well and are grateful for her many contributions as a scholar and a colleague. The new administrative assistant in the department 11</page><page sequence="4">is Rochelle El-Jitan. Kim Benzel was graduate assistant, Negar Ahkami college intern, and Lauren Shulsky a volunteer. In March the Visiting Committee met with the department at a luncheon. New staffmembers were introduced, and current projects and recent acquisitions were discussed and displayed. We are grateful to the members of this committee and to other friends for support: the Hagop Kevorkian Fund, Malcolm H. Wiener, Alastair Bradley Martin, Edith Porada, Mary Littauer, Raymond and Beverly Sackler, the Colt Archaeological Institute, Inc., and the Charles Engelhard Foundation. Prudence O.

Conceived as a Festschrift, this volume contains twenty- two articles by Dr. Nickel's colleagues, or former colleagues, at the Museum, including departmental members Stuart Pyhrr, Leonid Tarassuk, David Alexander, and Morihiro Ogawa. It also includes Dr. Nickel's current bibliography of more than seventy titles covering a wide range of subjects which reveals the tremendous breadth of the author's interests. So well kept was the secret of this Journal's purpose that Dr. Nickel unwittingly contributed three Hilt for the Dress Sword of the Prince de Béarn by Albert-Ernest Carrier- Belleuse, French, 1824-97. Gilt bronze, ca. 1880. Purchase, Gift of William H. Riggs, by exchange (1989.229) articles to it, which is especially appropriate because he had been a member of the editorial board since 1968 and the Journal's most regular contributor. In September Dr. Nickel was elected curator emeritus by the Board of Trustees. The activities of the department this year focused almost exclu- sively on the ongoing renovation of the Arms and Armor galleries and the planned reinstallation of about one thousand objects. While the curators devoted their time to the study, selection, and labeling of objects intended for reinstallation, armorers Robert Carroll and Theodore Monnich were busy cleaning and conserving the objects and fabricating their mounts. Specialized conservation work was accomplished with the unstinting cooperation of the departments of Textile, Objects, and Paintings Conservation. Two additional part-time conservators, Christel Faltermeier and Rudolf Meyer, labored more than nine hundred hours on the restoration of our medieval painted shields. In April twenty-two Japanese swords and one helmet were sent to Tokyo for restoration by specialist crafts- men, a project coordinated by our research associate for Japanese arms and armor, Morihiro Ogawa. Acquisitions included a number of nineteenth-century arms, an area in which our collection is particularly weak. Noteworthy among these is a gilt bronze sword hilt modeled by the famous French sculptor Carrier-Belleuse around 1880 and a finely en- graved six-barreled percussion "pepperbox" pistol made by the American inventors Allen and Thurber around 1 842-47. It is worth noting that the department's small collection of American arms has come to us almost exclusively through the generosity of the Ameri- can collecting fraternity, a tradition that continues with the gift of this pistol. Assistant curator Donald LaRocca toured Italian collections in September with the support of a Museum travel grant, and Stuart Pyhrr traveled to Italy, the Netherlands, and Great Britain. He gave a lecture as part of the Sunday at the Met program and devoted considerable time to his new position on the Planning and Budget Committee. Stuart W.

Wen Fong, special consultant, set the pace by working on a book about Sung and Yuan painting in the collection. Brooke Russell Astor Senior Curator James C. Y. Watt gave a paper on Sung silk tapestries at a symposium at the Liaoning Provincial Museum in September on the occasion of its fortieth anniversary and the opening of its new building. As an adjunct professor at the Institute of Fine Arts, he taught a fall-term course on archaic Chinese jade. Curator Martin Lerner received the annual award of the New York State Society of the Dames of the Court of Honor for the discovery and return to Thailand of a stolen work of art. In October he delivered the keynote address at a Columbia University function honoring the collector Samuel Eilenberg. Dr. Lerner secured major acquisitions for the collections of Indian and Southeast Asian art and continued work on the permanent galleries for these collections and on a forthcoming exhibition of sculpture from the Eilenberg collection. Research curator Hiroshi Onishi delivered several lectures during the year at the Los Angeles County Museum, the University of Tokyo, and the Freer Gallery. He organized a study meeting with Professors Jonathan Brown and Yoshihiko Amino at the Institute of Fine Arts and gave a seminar there in the spring. Research curator Suzanne Valenstein mounted an exhibition of Chinese ceramics from the Adele and Stanley Herzman collection in June. She wrote several magazine articles and lectured about the collection. Associate curator and administrator Alfreda Murck completed editing the John Crawford Collection symposium papers and deliv- ered a paper at the annual meeting of the College Art Association. In November associate curator Barbara Ford delivered papers on Daimyo culture at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D. C, and at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. In May she participated in the International Conference on the Paintings of Katsushika Hokusai held at the University of Venice and consulted on a new Asian art installation at the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore. She organized and lectured in the series "Purposes and Pleasures of Japanese Art" in the spring. Associate curator Maxwell Hearn earned his Ph.D. from Princeton University this year. His thesis, "The K'ang-hsi Southern Inspection Tour: A Narrative Program by Wang Hui," treats a set of twelve monumental handscrolls, one of which is in the Museum's collection. Assistant curator Steve Kossak traveled to India and Thailand with designer Jeff Daly to gather design references for the new Florence and Herbert Irving Galleries for Indian and Southeast Asian Art. Mr. Kossak has also been working on the Eilenberg exhibition catalogue. Curator Jean Mailey offered two courses in textile history for the Costume Institute/New York University joint program. She attended meetings of Conseil de Direction and Assemblée Générale (CIETA) in Chicago, the Advisory Council of the Textile Museum in Wash- ington, and the China Institute Art Committee in New York. She worked with Dolkun Kamberi, research fellow from the Uighur Autonomous Region Museum, on an English translation of the Urumchi Museum catalogue entries on textiles. Caron Smith, former special assistant to Wen Fong, lectured at the Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth, for the opening of a loan exhibition from the Museum's Robert H. Ellsworth collection. She offered a fall-term course in Chinese and Japanese art at the Fashion Institute of Technology. The Visiting Committee met in May to continue discussion of new Indian and Southeast Asian Gallery development, desktop publishing, and the rotation of exhibitions. The Friends of Asian Art once again made possible the addition of six superlative objects to the collections and created a fund for the purchase of books on Asian art. Wen Fong Special Consultant for Asian Affairs Poem of Farewell to Liu Man by Yeh-lii Ch'u-ts'ai. Chinese, 1 1 90- 1 244. Handscroll, ink on paper, 1240. Bequest of John M. Crawford, Jr. (1989.363.17) Asian Art Conservation During the year this department worked on album leaves, handscrolls, screens, hanging scrolls, and prints in the permanent collection to be exhibited in rotation in the galleries for Japanese and Chinese art. A hanging scroll, Kuan-yin Bestowing a Son, was prepared for exhi- bition in the Chinese galleries. Work on the painting included extensive stabilization of pigment and changing of the last backing to remove creases. Conservation and remounting of paintings from 14</page><page sequence="7">the Japanese collection included extensive work on the hanging scroll Welcoming Descent of Amida Buddha, which was removed from the frame in which it had been mounted and was completely remounted with the same mounting textiles. An inscription was revealed on the reverse of the mounting that positively identified the work as a commemorative painting for Oikawa Zen'emon at the death of his wife in 1 668. It was also discovered that the scroll knobs function as small reliquaries, whose contents are visible through glass panels. Fighting Cocks, a. hanging scroll painted on silk by the Japanese artist Hokusai, was lifted completely from its mounting. This was corrected by complete remounting; the same textiles were used. Most of the hanging scrolls or handscrolls in this collection remain in these formats and have not been mounted on panels or in frames. The few that were so remounted have invariably been returned to the scroll format. In a rare reversal of this process, Asian Art Conservation restored and remounted an eighteenth-century Japanese genre painting handscroll as individual leaves. This was done because the condition of the pigment layers, the applied mica, and the thickness of the binder rendered the work no longer safe to roll. Another Japanese handscroll, a twelfth-century Chusonji Mahaprajna sutra scroll, was treated for insect damage and tears by separating the paper and making repairs between these layers. A six-fold screen pair, The Four Gentlemanly Accomplishments, on loan from the Gerry Collection, was treated and repaired so that the screens could travel to an exhibition in Shizuoka, Japan, where conditions of temperature and humidity differ significantly. Conservation and remounting have begun on Chinese Sages, two sets of four large paintings now mounted on both sides of four sliding panels. This project will take three years to complete. For the sake of both preservation and exhibition, these paintings will be mounted as separate sets, on eight panels. Conservation also began on some of the paintings to be exhibited when the galleries for Southeast Asian art open. Members of the department attended several conferences and lectured on various topics relating to the conservation, preservation, storage, and handling of Asian art. They worked with colleagues in the field and with those in other areas of expertise to devise a variety of methods for solving persistent difficulties with materials and techniques.

The exhibition was made possible by Wolfgang K. Flöttl and was launched with our annual Party of the Year benefit chaired by Mrs. William F. Buckley, Jr., who, with the aid of her committee, provided a memorable evening. The summer exhibition of children's costume, "Small Illusions: Chil- dren's Costume 1710-1920," was organized by Kimberly Fink and made possible by Stanley J. Love and the Joseph Love Foundation. We wish to acknowledge the generosity of donors to our depart- ment, particularly Shirley S. Katzenbach, who supports a variety of important departmental activities; the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which contributed to a Costume Institute endowment, and those who helped to establish the Diana Vreeland Fund for exhibitions and related publications, through a benefit auction at Sotheby's and the special generosity of the Estate of Diana Vreeland. Our volunteer tour guides conducted ninety-four tours of the Study Storage for students from thirty states and Canada, as well as seventy-five exhibition tours. Eighty classes were conducted in our classroom, and 260 visitors made appointments to study the collection. The Costume Reference Library was used by more than 1,500 people, and 1,100 additional reference calls and letters were received. Fourteen volunteers contributed almost four thousand hours in the library. The conservation area, under the supervision of Christine Paulocik, associate conservator, consulted with visiting conservators from nine European institutions and others from the United States and Canada. The department has loaned objects to ten exhibitions in the United States and abroad. Members of the Costume Institute staff participated in interna- tional and national meetings, giving papers and serving on orga- nizational committees. A selected list of activities follows. Jean Druesedow presented papers at meetings of the International Congress of Museums (ICOM) in The Hague and Budapest and the Centro Italiano per lo Studio della Storia del Tessuto (CISST) in Milan. She also attended the Centre International d'Etude des Textiles Anciens (CI ETA) in Chicago and a symposium in Wash- ington, D. C, of the Costume Society of America, of which she is president. She also serves as president of Fashion's Inner Circle and continues to coordinate and conduct the Costume Studies program with New York University. Katell le Bourhis lectured widely on "The Age of Napoleon." Caroline Goldthorpe lectured for the Costume Council of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Christine Paulocik presented materials at a working session on the degradation of silk textiles at the Conservation Analytical Labora- tory at the Smithsonian Institution. Robert Kaufmann spoke to the Art Research Libraries Society of North America. We are delighted to have been able to provide resources for the general public, as well as for specialists in the field of costume history, during a most productive year. Jean L.

One of these, Vertumnus and Pomona, is reproduced in Recent Acquisitions: A Selection 1989- 1990. With income from the Harry G. Sperling Fund, we pur- chased a unique drawing, illustrated at right, by the seventeenth- century Franciscan artist Claude François, known as le frère Luc. Sperling funds also made possible the purchase of drawings by Louis Galloche, François-Marius Granet, II Guercino, Tiburzio Passarotti, and Francesco Vanni. A brilliantly colored sketch by Henri Lehmann, Tobias Brings His Bride to the House of His Father, 1864, was purchased with funds given by Mrs. Carl L. Seiden, in memory of her husband. Funds contributed by Karen B. Cohen enabled us to acquire drawings by David d'Angers, Fernand Cormon, Henri Lehmann, Eugène Leygue, Léon-Auguste Lhermitte, and Ernest Meissonier. With the David L. Klein, Jr., Memorial Foundation, Inc. Gift, we bought a Christ on the Crossby Girolamo Muziano. A drawing by Ludovico Cardi, called II Cigoli, was purchased with funds given by Mr. and Mrs. Werner H. Kramarsky. Income from the Van Day Truex Fund was used for the acquisition of drawings by Paul Baudry, Michelangelo Cerruti, and Agostino Masucci. The associate curator, Helen B. Mules, coordinated the installa- tion of "Master Drawings from the Woodner Collection," which was shown in the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Special Exhibition Hall from March 10 to May 13, 1990. In conjunction with the Department of Prints and Photographs, we organized several exhibitions that showed a variety of our holdings in the Galleries for Drawings, Prints and Photographs. We lent drawings to seven institutions in the United States and Canada and to six in Europe. Of the loans to Europe, particular mention should be made of our participation in the exhibitions "Giulio Romano" at the Palazzo Te in Mantua and "David" at the Musée du Louvre in Paris. More than six hundred visitors came to our Study Room in the course of the year. The curator, the associate curator, and the assistant curator, William M. Griswold, all made trips abroad to study drawings in public and private collections. 18th Century Italian Drawings in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, an illustrated catalogue of our rich holdings in this field, went to press in June 1990 and is scheduled for publication in August.

The work was again directed by Dieter Arnold, with the participation of staff members Dorothea Arnold, Christian Hoelzl, Adela Oppenheim, and William Schenck and a number of outside schol- ars, including James Allen, who will join the Department on July 1 , 1990, as assistant curator. Research and excavation on the most important tombs at Lisht South were completed to the extent that the staff will be able to finish publications on these tombs. Volume 2 in the South Cemeteries at Lisht series, The Control Notes and Team Marks of the Middle Kingdom, by Felix Arnold, Juergen Osing, and I.E. S. Edwards, is expected to appear in print soon. Volume 3, Dieter Arnold's The Pyramid Complex of Senwosret h The Outer Court, has reached the editing stage, and Christian Hoelzl's Mastabas and Tombs is also well advanced. Work in the galleries included an overall fine-tuning of the lighting and the replacement of background linen. The display of the Ptolemaic bronze figures was revised, and the general condition survey of the collection continued in conjunction with the Depart- ment of Objects Conservation. A generous gift from Visiting Committee co-chairman Mrs. Henry A. Grunwald enabled us to install a case entitled "Special Focus Objects of Egyptian Art" in gallery 1. The first "Special Focus" pieces are a number of silver objects and statuettes. Reinstal- lation of reliefs from an early Dynasty 1 9 chapel originally in the precinct of the god Osiris at Abydos has been of primary concern for some time. These reliefs were removed from display in 1966 because of surface deterioration caused by a high salt concentration. In recent years, a concerted effort by the Objects Conservation staff (Api Charola, George Wheeler, and Robert J. Koestler, among others) has led to a treatment of the reliefs that will now enable the Museum to exhibit them again. Funding for the new installation of these reliefs near the Dendur temple was generously provided by Malcolm H. Wiener, co-chairman of the Visiting Committee, who also gave funds for the future restoration of gallery 30 - now used as a storeroom for the Abydos reliefs - as a space for temporary exhibitions. Christine Lilyquist continued her research on the burial equip- ment of the three wives of Tuthmosis III and completed parts of her monograph. Catharine Roehrig submitted her Ph.D. dissertation on royal nurses to the University of California at Berkeley in May 1990. Marsha Hill completed her M.A. at New York University with a study of late Roman glass from the Museum's excavations at Kharga Oasis. After almost ten years with the department, William Schenck left us in May. The department conducted an extensive training course for the walking-tour volunteers and hosted a lecture by Hourig Sourouzian on the colossal statue of Ramses II in November and a Sunday at the Met program in May. Members of the Visiting Committee attended a tea in November and a meeting and lunch given by Mrs. Henry A. Grunwald in June. The department mourns the death of Norbert Schimmel, a long- time friend and member of the Visiting Committee. Mr. Schimmel was also a generous donor of works of art. His gift in 1985 of reliefs from Akhenaten's temple at Hermopolis greatly enriched the department's collection of art from the Amarna Period. More recently, the department received a group of objects from the Norbert Schimmel Trust, including the superb head of a priest that probably dates to the reign of Nectanebo II of Dynasty 30.

Sheafer, by exchange (1989.328) 22</page><page sequence="15">The past year was distinguished by the acquisition of two important early nineteenth-century French paintings and by the endowment of two curatorships. Delacroix's The Natchez, a masterpiece of the French Romantic movement, was begun in 1 822 and first exhibited to the public at the Salon of 1835. Gericault's Evening: Landscape with an Aqueduct formed part of a decorative ensemble illustrating the times of day. The endowed curatorships, made possible by the generosity of Jayne Wrightsman and Annette de la Renta, have been assigned to Keith Christiansen and Gary Tinterow. The department organized three international loan shows. "Velazquez," an unprecedented exhibition of thirty-eight paintings by the greatest of all Spanish artists, attracted more than half a million visitors. It ran concurrently with "Canaletto," a selection of some of the finest paintings and drawings by this eighteenth- century Venetian master. The latter exhibition was organized by Katharine Baetjer, who worked closely with J. G. Links. As part of an ongoing exchange with Soviet museums and the Art Institute of Chicago, Gary Tinterow and Susan Stein helped select the paintings for "From Poussin to Matisse: The Russian Taste for French Painting." This exhibition brought together pairs and ensembles by individual artists that were divided between Moscow and Leningrad after the Bolshevist Revolution. Additionally, two smaller exhibitions were mounted. "A Caravaggio Rediscovered: The Lute Player," organized by Keith Christiansen, with the assistance of Andrea Bayer and Laurence Libin, brought together loans from the Museum's departments of European Sculpture and Decorative Arts, Islamic Art, Musical Instruments, and Prints and Photographs, as well as pictures from American and European institutions. It celebrated the extended loan from Wildenstein's of a newly identified painting by Caravaggio. "Jean-Baptiste Greuze: French Painting in the Mid- 18th Century" was composed exclusively of the Museum's comprehensive collec- tion of paintings, drawings, and prints by this underrated master of the Age of Enlightenment. The show, which was organized by Andrea Bayer and Katharine Baetjer, coincided with the publica- tion of an issue of the Museum's Bulletin on Greuze, written by James Thompson. Two members of the department were honored for their publi- cations. Keith Christiansen received the Alfred H. Barr, Jr., award from the College Art Association for his catalogue of last year's exhibition "Painting in Renaissance Siena." The Confédération Internationale des Négociants en Oeuvres d'Art gave Walter Liedtke the 1989 CINOA prize for his latest book, The Royal Horse and Rider: Painting, Sculpture, and Horsemanship, 1500-1800. As in the past, the department has received a variety of outstand- ing loans. Among them, the most important are a pair of panels with scenes from the story of the Argonauts, painted for the marriage in i486 of Lorenzo Tornabuoni and Giovanna degli Albizzi. We gratefully acknowledge subventions from Peter Sharp for frames, from Alexis Gregory for computers, and from Frank and Nancy Richardson for staff travel.

To accompany this presentation of new aspects of our collections, we offered two series of lectures: a symposium on "Princes and Artists in 18th-century Central Europe" Qanuary 12), organized by the chairman working with the Office of Academic Programs, and a series of lectures on "Decorative Arts in Central Europe 1700-1800," organized by associate curator Clare Le Corbeiller with the help of the Office of Public Programs. 23</page><page sequence="16">Throughout the year the department also continued to work on its heavy installation schedule, particularly the planning of the Carroll and Milton Pétrie European Sculpture Court and the adjoining six galleries, which are designed to display some 120 sculptures from the seventeenth to the twentieth century and a selection of Flemish and French tapestries. Curator James Draper and associate curators William Rieder, Clare Vincent, and Alice Zrebiec worked closely with the chairman to help in the realization of this monumental project, which is scheduled for completion in October 1990. Several important sculptures were added to our collection: a portrait of Robert Fulton by Houdon and a marble bust of Queen Marie-Amélie of France by the Baron Bosio, both purchased with funds generously provided by Jayne Wrightsman, and two terms by Pietro and Gian Lorenzo Bernini, an acquisition made possible by the Annenberg Foundation. Great strides were also made in collecting significant European nineteenth-century decorative arts, with numerous acquisitions, foremost among them a French armoire by C. G. Diehl and E. Frémiet, a purchase made possible by a gift from the Frank E. and Nancy M. Richardson Foundation. As in years past, the staff lectured and taught at various American and European institutions. James Draper spoke on the sculptor Bertoldo at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and on Vecchietta at the Frick Collection, New York. Clare Le Corbeiller gave a lecture to the Wedgwood Society and participated in a colloquium at the Abegg Foundation in Riggisberg, Switzerland. Assistant curator Danielle Grosheide spoke at Agecroft Hall in Richmond, Virginia, and the chairman conducted a seminar on seventeenth- and eigh- teenth-century French sculpture at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University. The Friends of European Sculpture and Decorative Arts met in October for a lecture about Schloss Seehof by Dr. Michael Petzet, conservator-general of the Bavarian office for the Preservation of Historical Monuments, and in April to hear the curators present objects purchased with funds provided by this organization. The chairman gave a progress report on the department's ongoing installation program and a preview of Pétrie Court. Olga Raggio Iris and B.

Darrin Gift Greek and Roman Art By the time this Annual Report is distributed, a major exhibition of ancient art from the collection of Shelby White and Leon Levy will have opened in a gallery next to our gallery of classic sculpture in Roman copies. Considerable effort has gone into cataloguing this very large collection, from which a selection of about two hundred objects will be exhibited in the Museum. Curator Joan R. Mertens has devoted much time to the volun- teers for Greek and Roman art. She also continued to serve on the editorial board of the Metropolitan Museum Journal, which has won universal acclaim as an important scholarly periodical. She worked with Peter H. von Blanckenhagen on a revision of his monograph on Boscotrecase, written with Christine Alexander and originally published as a supplement to Römische Mitteilungen; these revisions were completed before Professor von Blanckenhagen's death on March 6, 1990. Assistant curator Elizabeth Milleker continued the long-range program of making our classical casts available to other institutions, relieving the Museum of storage pressures. She also lectured in the Museum and continued her research in the field of sculpture. Dietrich von Bothmer served as courier to and from Bonn for an important exhibition of Hellenistic art. He lectured in Atlanta and New York on the Berlin Painter and was consulted in connection with the Euphronios exhibition that opened in Arezzo in May before going to the Louvre in September 1990. This year's purchases have enriched many aspects of our wide- ranging collections, and the department continues to receive gifts and loans, which are listed below. Of special importance is the exceptional gift of the Norbert Schimmel Trust from the collection of one of our most generous benefactors, who passed away earlier this year. Much of the department's work in the years to come will be devoted to the reinstallation of our galleries, and Dr. Carlos A.

Three exhibitions opened, all drawn exclusively from the perma- nent collections. The first, "Persian Drawings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art," was organized by Marie Lukens Swietochowski, curator, and Sussan Babaie, Hagop Kevorkian Fellow for 1987-89; they also wrote the catalogue that accompanied the exhibition. "Islamic Textiles: A Sampler from Muslim Lands," organized by Carolyn Kane, featured twenty rarely exhibited works from the department's extraordinary holdings of more than three thousand textiles. In "Glass Gathers," which opened in May, Marilyn Jenkins examined several glass-making techniques either transmitted by Islamic artists from antiquity to later periods in Europe and America or invented by them. A prime example of interdepartmental coop- eration, this exhibition of sixty objects involved loans from seven curatorial departments of the Museum. This year The Kevorkian Fund generously provided a substantial endowment for the Special Exhibitions Gallery, which it originally helped to establish, in order to ensure that the exhibition program can continue to thrive. Marie Swietochowski and Sussan Babaie lectured at the Museum in conjunction with the drawings exhibition. In April the Museum focused on the Islamic collection and curators Jenkins, Kane, and Walker gave Friday evening lectures. Annual Fellows Day in May also featured the Islamic department, and the curator in charge spoke in the galleries. In February the Museum hosted a two-day conference for the North American Historians of Islamic Art (NAHIA), at which the curator in charge gave a brief paper on two recent acquisitions. At the annual Wilkinson Lecture Series, which this year had a garden theme, the department was represented by Dr. Ellen Smart, who gave a memorable lecture on Mughal gardens. The Visiting Committee met in November and June, and the curator in charge reviewed departmental projects, acquisitions, exhibitions, and future plans. Marilyn Jenkins continued to teach at the Parsons School of Design, in the Museum Studies programs at the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University, and at the Fashion Institute of Technol- ogy. Marie Swietochowski lectured to the Hajji Baba Club and the Princeton Rug Society and continued teaching at Columbia Uni- versity. A Theodore Rousseau Travel Grant enabled her to study paintings and manuscripts in Lisbon, Copenhagen, and Uppsala. Carolyn Kane gave lectures to several New York organizations, including the Turkish- American Society and the Seminar in Turkish Studies at Columbia University.

The curator in charge received a Rousseau Travel Grant to study Islamic collections in Istanbul. There were several staff changes during the course of the year. Marilyn Jenkins was promoted to curator. Carolyn Kane left the Museum at the end of the year after more than eighteen years with the department, the last ten as assistant curator. She has helped the department through several periods of turbulence and transition and always contributed in a devoted and selfless way. Richard Turnbull joined the department for the year as the new Hagop Kevorkian Fellow.

With the cooperation of the departments of Medieval Art and European Sculpture and Decorative Arts, the exhibition reopened on November 2 in a slightly reduced form - about four hundred objects - and remained on view until April 15, 1990. The Robert Lehman Collection hosted two exhibitions in its court level galleries this year. From November 21, 1 989, to January 21, 1990, "Views of Venice" - paintings, drawings, and prints by Canaletto and his circle - brought together seventy-two works from the Robert Lehman Collection and the Department of Prints and Photographs. The exhibition was organized by Katharine Baetjer of the Department of European Paintings to coincide with the Museum's Canaletto exhibition. Thanks to the generosity of an anonymous lender, the exhibition "Impressionist and Modern Paintings from a Private Collection" was on view in the court-level galleries from January 26 to April 1 5, 1990. The exhibition, which comprised fifty paintings ranging in date from 1860 to 1960, was highlighted by a masterpiece of Picasso's Blue Period: Absinthe Drinker (Angel Fernandez de Soto). An especially fine group of works by Vuillard, Bonnard, Rouault, and Matisse in this collection was supplemented by the holdings of the Robert Lehman Collection and by an earlier gift made by Robert Lehman to the Museum. On June 4 the Robert Lehman Collection sponsored an invita- tional colloquium for thirty-five experts from Europe and America on the history of frames, coincident with the opening of the exhibition "Italian Renaissance Frames" in its main-level galleries. The opening of the exhibition was further celebrated with a day- long public symposium on June 5 organized by the Office of Academic Programs and made possible by a generous grant from the William H. Kearns Foundation. The staff of the Robert Lehman Collection was significantly enriched this year by the addition of Veda Crewe as departmental technician, Jillian Ehninger as administrative assistant, and Linda Wolk-Simon as assistant curator. Linda was formerly assistant museum educator in the Academic Programs office of the Division of Education Services, where she was chiefly responsible for a successful series of public symposia, including "Painting in Renais- sance Siena," "Italian Renaissance Fresco Restoration," "The Arts of Central Europe," "Caravaggio," and "The Italian Renaissance Frame."

Planned and coordinated by Timothy B. Husband, with the assistance of Ian Wardropper, this exhibition presented a rich overview of artistic developments from the Early Christian through the Late Gothic period. The Hermitage expects to publish the catalogue written by staff members of the Museum and the Art Institute. With the completion of the final payments, we can now an- nounce the acquisition of a major collection of late sixth- to early seventh-century liturgical vessels and objects originally belonging to the churches of Attarouthi in northern Syria. These objects will be placed on exhibition in December 1990. Mary B. Shepard, with guest editor Elizabeth Parker, coordi- nated the editing of twenty-one scholarly papers for a volume commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of The Cloisters, funded by the Louis and Anne Abrons Foundation, the Samuel H. Kress Foundation, the International Center for Medieval Art, Abbey R. Simpson Gift, and an anonymous donor. The preparation of collection catalogues has continued, with special consultant Adolfo S. Cavallo working with the Editorial Department on his completed text on the Museum's medieval tapestries and research consultant Lisbeth Castelnuovo-Tedesco finishing her text on Italian sculpture. Lauren Jackson-Beck of the Cloisters Library and her staff completed the installation of the new Archives Storage room, conducted a tour of the library facilities for the Art Libraries Society (ARLIS), and attended seminars and courses in library preservation. The Cloisters Education Department has continued group visits, weekday and Saturday lectures, family workshops, enrichment sessions for the volunteers, and college internships and initiated a new gallery brochure and a lecture series devoted to the gardens at The Cloisters. This series is funded by the Acorn Foundation. Jane Hayward gave a report on American activities of the Corpus Vitrearum at a colloquium in Erfurt, East Germany. Margaret Frazer gave two talks to the volunteers in the Byzantine and Medieval galleries. Timothy Husband lectured on medieval glass at the J. Paul Getty Museum and conducted a masters-level seminar for the Cooper Hewitt/Parsons School of Design. Charles Little spoke on monumental sculpture at The Cloisters and Columbia University, on Romanesque ivory crosses at Rutgers University, and on collecting medieval art for the Museum at the City College of New York and Memphis State University. Barbara Boehm lectured on reliquaries at Columbia University and the Museum, gold in medieval art at the Museum, and silks to a New York University graduate seminar in textile history. The chairman gave a lecture on the purposes of medieval sculpture at the Museum and conducted a seminar on metalwork and enamels with Pete Dandridge, as part of the Curatorial Studies program of the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University. Charles Little and the chairman attended the medieval enamels colloquium at the British Museum, and most of the department attended the Rutgers University colloquium on ivories. Charles Little is director of the project "Provenance Study of Limestone Used in French Medieval Sculpture," funded by a grant from the Florence Gould Foundation. Jane Hayward was appointed to the Phoenix Committee for the Census of Stained Glass Windows in America; Barbara Boehm joined the Museum's Registrar's committee for Storeroom One; and Charles Little became chairman of the board of directors of the Alumni Association of the Institute of Fine Arts. Barbara Boehm and Mary Shepard completed their dissertations and were awarded doctorates by the Institute of Fine Arts and Columbia University, respectively. The Visiting Committee met in February to consider acquisition opportunities in the fields of Celtic and Visigothic metalwork. William D.

Centenary obser- vances continued throughout the year with gallery concerts and other special events, such as private recitals for Patron members of the Museum. Performers who appeared in these and other musical programs presented by the department during the year included cellist Barbara Bogatin; pianist John Cobb; Kim Heindel, Lautenwerk; harpsichordist Linda Kobler; the Kooper-Boehm duo; fortepianist Kathryn Shanks Libin; violinists Jaap Schröder and Beverly Somach; and guitarist Andrew Schulman. Grants from the New York State Council on the Arts, the Fan Fox and Leslie R. Samuels Foundation, and the Eleanor Naylor Dana Charitable Trust enabled us to offer public concerts of folk and non-Western music, some in conjunction with the Society for Asian Music and the World Music Institute. These programs and associated lecture- demonstrations, coordinated by assistant curator J. Kenneth Moore, vividly demonstrated the worldwide scope of the department's holdings. A selection of Baroque instruments appeared in the exhibition "A Caravaggio Rediscovered: The Lute Player," and musical instru- ments were the theme of the Museum's spring benefit party. In the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium the curator offered a series of talks on the history of the piano, and he eulogized the late pianist Konrad Double-bell euphonium by C. G. Conn.

The National Endowment for the Humanities supported his research on instruments at the Borromeo palace on Isola Bella. The curator attended conventions of the American Musical Instrument Society (of which he is vice-president and Ken Moore is a governor), the American Musicological Society, the Organ Historical Society, and the International Council of Museums and lectured at the Holland Festival, at the Aston Magna Academy, and on the Museum's spring cruise of the British Isles. Ken Moore continued as president of the Middle Atlantic chapter of the Society for Ethnomusicology and as a member of the Board of the Society for Asian Music. He lectured at the Mannes College of Music and pursued doctoral studies at the City Univer- sity of New York. Associate conservator Stewart Pollens prepared instruments for display and performance and received a travel stipend in support of research on Stradivari materials in Cremona and Paris. He presented papers at the Boston Early Music Festival and the New York Conservation Association and prepared several articles for publication. Departmental technician Joseph Peknik received a well-deserved promotion, and senior administrative assistant Michèle Miller-Carter coped admirably with the respon- sibilities of her new position. The staff welcomed Renée Barrick as secretary and Ellen Leichtman as part-time coordinator of world- music programs. Frederick P. Rose, a trustee of the Museum, generously endowed the department's curatorship. Mr. Rose was appointed to the department's Visiting Committee, which met in April to review recent curatorial and conservation activities. These included iden- tifying and recovering a harp stolen from Yale University. Laurence Libin Frederick P.

"Gold of Africa: the Barbier-Mueller Collection" was held from October 1989 through March 1990 and attracted an unusually large attendance. Organized by the Musée Barbier-Mueller, Geneva, the exhibition was coordinated here by associate curator Kate Ezra. She also organized "Art of Central Africa: Masterpieces from the Berlin Museum fur Völkerkunde," which opened in June 1990, in collaboration with Hans-Joachim Koloss, director of the African Department of the Berlin museum. The exhibition gave our public the opportunity to see objects that are among the most celebrated in all African art; these are described and illustrated in a catalogue of the same title prepared by Dr. Koloss with contributions from eight other scholars. Julie Jones, curator, organized "Andean Four-Co rnered Hats, Ancient Volumes," which opened in April 1990. The hats, from Andean cultures of the fourth through the twelfth century, were selected from the collection of Arthur M. Bullowa, and their installation was made possible by the generosity of Reliance Group Holdings, Inc. An illustrated catalogue was written by Mary Frame, who has also been cataloguing the department's textiles with funding from the National Endowment for the Arts. Julie Jones continued to work intensively on the Precolumbian section of "Mexico: Splendors of Thirty Centuries," a major exhibition that will open in October 1990. Kate Ezra lectured on African art at the Smith College Museum of Art, the Krannert Art Museum at the University of Illinois, The National Museum of African Art, Washington, D.C., and the Art Institute of Chicago. She presented papers at the annual meetings 2 Drum. Zaire, Lele. Wood, hide, 19th-20th century. Gift of Drs.

Long-term reorganization of the department's collection pro- gressed significantly under the direction of Heidi King, senior research assistant, who also supervised our interns, Sheila Findley and Kim O'Neil. Ms. King lectured at the Mamaroneck Adult School, the American Museum of Natural History, and the Metro- politan. Fiorina H. Capistrano and Cynthia C. Turner, research assistants, were engaged in cataloguing and storage projects. Chris- tine Giuntini, assistant conservator, prepared the Andean hats for exhibition and readied part of our textile collection for a move to new storage space. The department made loans to exhibitions at the Center for African Art, the National Museum of African Art, the Wellesley College Museum, the Ezra and Cécile Zilkha Gallery at Wesleyan University, and the Centro Cultural/Arte Contemporaneo in Mexico City. Ross Day, assistant museum librarian in the Robert Goldwater Library, co-chaired the annual conference of the Art Libraries Society of North America, held in New York. Peter A. Blank, librarian, and Gabriella Mirollo, library assistant, joined our staff. Virginia-Lee Webb, assistant museum librarian in the Photograph Study Collection, mounted an exhibition, "The Crane Pacific Expedition 1928-29. The Sepik River Photographs" from prints presented by S. N. Shurcliffand loaned by the family of Dr. William Moss. We are grateful for financial support from Louise Bourgeois for the Goldwater library, and for the Photograph Study Collection from the family of Dr. Moss: Mr. and Mrs. L. Moss, Mr. and Mrs. James T. Heery, and Mr. and Mrs. Charles Schmidt. Both the library and the collection received generous grants from the Joseph and Ceil Mazer Foundation. Gifts of photographs were made by William B. Brill, Gil Graham, and Allen Wardwell. Carol Meyer, Jane Howland, and Judith Randal, to the great benefit of the department, once again gave much time to volunteer work in both the library and the collection. Douglas Newton Evelyn A. J.

Both "The New Vision: Photography Between the World Wars" and "Pierre Bonnard: The Graphic Art" were enthu- siastically received and their publications were honored by the Association of American University Presses. The catalogue The New Vision, prepared by the exhibition's organizer, Maria Morris Hambourg, won the George Wittenborn Award as one of the five Eglise d'Auversby Edouard-Denis Baldus. French.

Ms. Hambourg participated in a film and lecture series on avant-garde cinema, which accompanied the exhibition. She lectured also at Boston University, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Wellesley College, the Los Angeles County Museum, the Royal Academy of Art, London, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography. Three talks were presented at the Museum in conjunction with the Bonnard exhibition. They were given by the authors of the show's catalogue: Colta Ives, Helen Giambruni, and Sasha M. Newman. Ms. Ives also lectured on Bonnard at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, and the Mu- seum of Fine Arts, Boston. In September our exhibition schedule opened with "Flemish Drawings and Prints," organized by Suzanne Boorsch and Helen Mules. By early December, when thirty-five curators of prints, drawings, and photographs arrived for a meeting of the Print Council of America, the department could count to its credit four simultaneous exhibitions: "The New Vision"; "Bonnard"; "Views of Venice," featuring Canaletto's etchings; and "Prints from the Bequest of Scofield Thayer," prepared by David W. Kiehl. In February our galleries were rearranged to introduce works from the permanent collections in "Drawings, Prints, and Photographs: A Selection," which included photographs interpreting appearances of permanence and change mounted by Maria Hambourg and a broad range of prints on the theme of the four temperaments chosen by Thomas Rassieur. Mr. Rassieur joined the staff in September as supervisor of the Study Room, which this year received a record number of 3,200 visitors. "Drawings and Prints: A Summer Selection" was shown from June to September 1990, collecting outdoor scenes from the fifteenth through the nineteenth century to demonstrate the deep roots of Impressionism. During the same period, "Oasis for the Eye: Félix Teynard's Photographs of Egypt, 1851-52" brought together rare salt prints from our collection with loans from the Gilman Paper Company and the Harrison D. Horblit Collection. Among the outstanding gifts received by the department this year were: a flamboyant design for a catafalque for King Philip IV of Spain, presented by Mr. and Mrs. Paul Gourary; a group of seventeen turn-of-the-century American artists' posters, which enriched the collection donated earlier by Leonard and Evelyn Lauder; and the contribution of funds for the purchase of etchings and lithographs by Jean Mignon, Paul Signac, Rockwell Kent, and John Copley, donated by Dr. and Mrs. Goodwin M. Breinin, Anne Stern, and Reba and Dave Williams. Prominent among the many donations of photographs were Paul Strand's superb portrait of his wife, Rebecca, New York (1922-23), given by Marilyn Walter Grounds, and Edward Steichen's Whistlerian landscape Voulangis ( 1900-02), the gift of Grace M. Mayer. Funds from many committee members, friends, and the Horace W. Goldsmith Foundation helped us acquire several fine photographs, including a rare unmounted salt print by Edouard- Denis Baldus and a large composite image by Ray K. Metzker. The Visiting Committee met in April to tour the distinguished collection of prints by Picasso, Munch, Kirchner, and other modern masters formed by committee member Nelson Blitz, Jr. The Committee on Photography met twice, on November 9 and February 14, welcoming Eugene Schwartz as its newest member.

William S. Lieberman was appointed the first Jacques and Natasha Gelman Chairman of the Department. Once again exhibitions dominated the department's activities. "Twentieth Century Modern Masters: The Jacques and Natasha Gelman Collection" opened on December 12, 1989. After its presentation at the Museum, the collection was shown at the Royal Academy in London. "Folon's Folons," a survey of the work of the Belgian-born artist Jean-Michel Folon (born 1934), opened on March 27. At the same time, a selection of drawings and prints from the collection by the Austrian artist Egon Schiele (1890-1918) opened in the Gioconda and Joseph King Gallery. In October the Visiting Committee met at the home of Mrs. Gelman, where they previewed works to be included in the Gelman exhibition. On February 22 the department was visited by Vaclav Havel, newly elected President of Czechoslovakia, as part of his official visit to New York City. President Havel viewed the Gelman exhibition, as well as the installation of American and European art since 1945. Acquisitions this past year include the bequest of Lydia Winston Malbin, comprising bronzes, paintings, drawings, and prints by the Italian Futurist Umberto Boccioni, as well as an untitled stone carving of 1 937 by Henry Moore and Antoine Pevsner's wall relief Fresco, Fauna of the Ocean (1944).
