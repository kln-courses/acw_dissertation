<plain_text><page sequence="1">PAINTED DECORATIVE MOTIFS IN THE AJANTA CAVES SHRIKANT A. FRADHAN The earliest known decorative motifs in sculpture and painting can be dated back to the first century B.C. i.e. to the stupa at Barhut. From then onwards, Sanchi, Amaravati and Ajanta present a number of more motifs as well as variations of the same motifs which the artists had created by observing animals, birds, trees and flowers in the nature. These were in all probability derived from wooden/painted originals as was the case in architecture. The artists had a free scope for their imagination and inventiveness. In course of time, perhaps by the end of the Gupta period, a need was probably felt to standardise the variety and the forms of these motifs and hence we find that texts like the Aparājitaprcchā composed by Bhuvan- devacharya some time in the 12th-13th Cent. A.D. (Mankad 1950) enumerate and codify these motifs, and have given specific names to many of them. This must have been done to help apprentices/new sculptors, etc. As in the case of other branches of knowledge like poetry, grammar, medicine, etc., the texts invest these motifs with divine sanction by attributing some supernatural origin or significance to many of them. An attempt is made in this paper to narrate those motifs/which occur in monuments and their representations in various texts. Following paragraphs deal with the motifs known as Citrapatra which commonly occur in the caves of Ajanta and Bagh. Citrapatra , literally means the 'creeper design', and is executed in a curvilinear florid style. It is well knwon that some of the paintings at Ajanta depict stories from the previous lives of Buddha as related in the Jātakas. Apart from the Jātakas many of the decorative motifs occur mainly on ceilings, walls and pillars where they are employed as space-fillers. It seems</page><page sequence="2">130 Bulletin of the Deccan College 56-57 (1996-1997) Fig. 1: (a) Matsyapatra, Aswapatra, (b) Nakrapatra, (c) Gajapatra, (d) Padmapatra, (e, f) Sisupatra, (g) Narapatra, (h) Hamsapatra</page><page sequence="3">Painted Decorative Motifs in the Ajanta Caves 131 that they were innovative or imaginative creations of artists because a text such as ' Visņudharmottara purāņa' dated to the 5th- 7th Cent. A.D. does not mention this creeper motif or Citrapatra. However, the 'Aparājita- prcchčT , devotes an independent chapter entitled Citrapatrottpatinirnayanama (chapter 227) comprising 36 stanzas. This text deals principally with architecture with smaller chapters on music, iconography and painting. The text is called the Aparājitaprccha, owing to the fact that it is in the form of a dialogue between the king Aparājita and Visvakarmā, the architect of the Universe. This text devoted to architecture has naturally devoted a complete chapter on a discourse on an art-motif, commonly used in temple architecture. It indicates that the Citrapatra form of decoration had already become an established tradition by the 12th-13th Cent. A.D. Thirty-six stanzas of this text provide an elaborate and lucid description of this motif. This text relates a myth in which Visvakarma narrates the origin of this tree. This is related below: ^ Piri I Olienti -1IMI I ft0 1 1 3TJ. (^vs) (In ancient times, when the ocean of milk was churned by the gods and demons a big tree emerged which is called the Tree of the Gods.) Another stanza gives a description of this tree. This is as follows: HHm&gt;rl&lt;t»«wļTbl 1 1« 1 1 3^. (The tree was laden with a variety of leaves, flowers and fruits which made it very beautiful and attractive.) The tree is described as being of great beauty, with its four branches spreading out towards the four directions. The eastern branch is called Nāgara, the southern Dravida, while the western and the northern branches are known Ventara and Vesara respectively. A fifth branch called Kal inga is also referred to and is conceived of as arising from the middle of the four branches. Associated terms occurring in the text, such as nandā, Bhadrā, jayõ, riktā and purnā do not supply much information about the Citrapatra as they seem to be related to the Tithicakra related phases of the moon. For example the following terms appear to be related to each other: Nandā - Pratipadā ; Bhadrā - Dvitiyã; Jayã - Trtiyâ; Riktā - Caturthī; Pūrņā - Pañcham'i which is followed by Nandā - Sasthi, Bhadrā - Saptamî marking the lunar cycle from Paurņimā (full moon) to Amāvāsļtā (new moon). However, each day of the Tithicakara seems to have been associated independently with various patras; e.g. Nandā with Sišupatra, (motifs related to cherubs or children); Bhadrā with Sakala (all motifs), Jayã with Svastika; Riktā with Vardhamānaka and Pūrņā with sarvatobhadra (Yantra or geometrical patterns). In addition there are other patterns such as the Jalapatra, which is associated with water and includes motifs like hamsa (goose), nakra (crocodile), matsya (fish) kīīrma (tortoise) and padma (lotus). According to this text, Sthalapatras or earthly forms include motifs in</page><page sequence="4">132 Bulletin of the Deccan College 56-57 (1996-1997) the form of Prāsādagrhakādikam or architectural forms. The remaining patterns are Naranäryädikapatra (man and woman); mithuna (couple), Na rap tra (anthropomorphic motif), Gajapatra (elephant), Asvapatra (horse), Anekākārapatra (variety of motifs), Hârakeyûrapatra (types of ornaments) and Meghapatra (cloud motifs). Besides this great variety of decorative motifs, the text also provides guidelines on the creation of repetitive patterns which form scrolls. The text also provides directions on the use of space and the appropriate places for depicting these motifs; viz. ceilings, doorframes, pillars and walls of a palace or Prāsāda. This is referred to a sloka quoted below: ^ 1 133 1 1 (on pillars, on the leaves of doors, on palaces and wherever possible, designs should be arranged or painted). Visvakarmā, the architect of the Gods, says that Lakshmi (Goddess of Wealth) dwells wherever ' Citrapatra ' motifs are painted. ïïTS^rfï Vpwi-H W: I IV* 1 1 3PJ. (Wherever there are designs, the goddess of wealth casts her beneficial glances. A vacant place neither bears beauty nor wealth. The space bears its auspiciousness to the designs which decorate it). These points indicate that the ' Citrapatra ' motif was essentially conceived as an integral part of the overall decoration. Apart from the motif described above, the Apa rã ji taprcchā gives details of Dinapatra (day patra) and Rutupatra (seasonal patra) as well. The paintings of Ajanta and Bagh display abundant decorative motifs used in scrolls as well as individual patterns comprising animals, flowers and creepers. These decorations are mainly found on ceilings, pillars, walls and door frames of the caves (Yazdani 1983a: 1). The representative examples are noted here. 1. Hamsapatra: ceilings of Cave Nos. I, II (Griffiths 1983: PI. 105. 10g-14.) bear painted Hamsapatra and carved scrolls. This motif can also be seen in Bagh Cave No. IV (Vogal 1927: Pl. XVI-XVII). 2. Nakrapatra: the ceiling of Ajanta Cave II, in the left antechamber, depicts this motif along the outer circular corner (Yazdani 1983a: 25; Pl. XXVI). The makara motif bearing a floriated tail is often shown at the entrance of caves and in scroll carvings on shrines, doors and pillars at Ajanta. 3. Naranãryâdikapatra : these amrous couples are painted on the lintel of the entrance of the Cave No. XVII at Ajanta. 4. Gajapatra and Narapatra : these motifs are noticeable in the Vihara of Cave No. XVII at Ajanta (Yazdani 1983c: Pl. LXXIII, b-c and Pl. LXIII, a-d). 5. Sisupatra : this constitutes a scroll of flowers and leaves decorated with cherubs or children (Griffiths 1983: 44: PI. 150 b). It is seen in Cave XIX at Ajanta.</page><page sequence="5">Painted Decorative Motifs in the Ajanta Caves 133 6. Hârkeyûrapatra : this motif is every common and occurs on pillars and ceilings and is bedecked with gold and pearl ornaments and garlands. 7. Asvapatra and Matsyapatra : these motifs are painted very beautifully on the ceilings of the Cave Nos. XI and XVII at Ajanta (Yazdani 1983c: Pl. LXXIV). 8. Padmapatra : a wide range of this motif rendered in a variety of shapes and styles. 9. Svastika : this pattern is painted in Cave No. XVII at Ajanta (Griffiths 1983: PI. 148: 26-28-32) and in Bagh Cave No. IV (Vogel 1927: pl. xvn). 10. Anekākārapatra: a variety of miscellaneous forms and patterns of motifs are painted at Ajanta and Bagh. 11. Meghapatra : curvilinear clouds are used in the circular inner scrolls on the central panel of ceiling in Ajanta Cave I (Griffiths 1983: PI. 113-101, 129-12) and in Bagh Cave IV (Vogel 1927: Pl. XVII). This motif is common on ceilings and scroll designs in these caves. 12. Prāsādagrhakādikam: this is noticeable on the pillars of Ajanta Cave No. II. This decoration consists of architectural motifs such as a Caitya with pillars (Griffiths 1983: PI. 145: 6-8). 13. Sarvatobhadra: these geometrical forms are depicted in Ajanta Cave No. XXI (Griffiths 1983: PI. 158 b). The Barhut stupa is also embellished with carved scrolls which are adorned with flowers, animals, birds, and human forms. The scroll style follows the Kalpalatā motif. This idea of the Kalpavriksa is also related to a myth concerning the churning of the primeval ocean by gods and demons (Agrawala 1943: 2). Asstated earlier, the 'Aparājitaprcchā' also refers to this myth when discussing the 'Citrapatra' motif. Kalidasa, the greatest poet of the classical age, refers traditional practice of decoration in his 'Raghuvamsa'. He mentions that women bedecked their bodies with paintings of the makara and other auspicious symbols in the form of 'Patralekha' or 'Citrapatra' (Sivaramamurti 1933: 167). Bāņa, a court poet of the King Harsha (7th Cent. A.D.), has referred to this tradition in his 'Kādambari'. He says that houses were painted with many kinds of 'Citrapatra' motifs (Sivaramamurti 1932: 397). These examples cited above clearly indicate that the 'Citrapatra' motif is a traditional and well established design used both for decoration of the human body and as an important element in architecture. In the caves of Ajanta and Bagh, most of the motifs discussed above were painted. It is, however, very difficult to execute these paintings in the form of curvilinear and running scrolls. Despite numerous practical difficulties, it is seen that these artists have painstakingly and skillfully made use of a small but varied range of color combinations. It is likely that the artists observed the dramatic effect of light and shade on decorative stone carvings (Haloi 1991:</page><page sequence="6">134 Bulletin of the Deccan College 56-57 (1996-1997) 376) and incorporated this effect in their paintings. Within the general framework of rules and guidelines, artist had created new patterns, designs and styles; which in turn developed into tradtions utilised by subsequent generations of artists. The ' Aparajitaprcchā's a medieval text, in all probability, synthesised earlier traditions relating to the various ' Citrapatra motifs which have given specific names according to their appearance and this in turn set the trend for subsequent artists.
