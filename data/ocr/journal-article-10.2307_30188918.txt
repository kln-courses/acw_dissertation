<plain_text><page sequence="1">Learning through Experience: A Workshop for Middle School Science Teachers JEAN L. POTTLE If experience is the best teacher, why do we in educa- tion ask others to do as we say, rather than as we do? Think about it. How often have experts told you how to teach, rather than modeling the behavior that they are en- couraging? Modeling was paramount in the minds of the Project Habitat team that met in July of 1992 at Potsdam College in Potsdam, New York, for a two-week summer workshop designed to encourage middle school science teachers to move away from a lecture-laboratory format and into a project-oriented, interdisciplinary team ap- proach to teaching middle school youngsters. The plan- ning team of a biologist, a computer expert, a physical scientist, and a language arts instructor modeled an across-the-curriculum as well as a team approach to teaching. To highlight the benefits of team work in teaching and learning, we had the participants concentrate on group work instead of individual projects. Because the subject matter of our workshop was ecology-specifically, the interdependence of all living things-we designed our in- troductory lessons around One Day at Teton Marsh, in which writer Sally Carrigher shows the interdependence of the animals of Teton Marsh as they live through one twenty-four-hour period. The biologist and the language arts instructor introduced the book and then asked the students to look for and list anthropomorphic elements in one section of the book. After small group discussions, the entire class met to compare notes. A lively discussion ensued, with some students supporting the use of anthro- pomorphic details while others rejected them as sloppy science. Debate became even more heated when we viewed a video based on the book, which painted a romantic rather than a realistic picture of the animals of Teton Marsh. To follow up this activity, students were divided Jean L. Pottle is an English instructor at Mid-State College, Auburn, Maine. into groups that were to research information on a resi- dent of the marsh. Each group was to report its findings back to the total group. The challenge was that no group was allowed to read a report or lecture on its findings. Working as a team, group members had to return with an innovative approach to teaching the class. In order to be successful, each member of the team had to participate. The results were models of interdisciplinary teaching. One group wrote and performed a very anthropomorphic rap that had fingers snapping. It began I am a thing of Teton Marsh Though using "thing" seems too harsh. The right word to use says my wonderful teacher Is organism, not that dirty word creature ... One group led a sing-along; another presented a play. Everyone was involved. Everyone learned. On another day, we visited a local state park. We broke up into teams, and each team mapped a different section of the park, identified wildlife and plants in its section, and planned a variety of interdisciplinary activ- ities that could be used with middle school students on a similar field trip. The members of one group, structuring their lessons around the concept of survival, wrote this scenario: Your science class has become stranded on a deserted is- land. There is no map of the area, and the boat that brought you here has been broken up by high waves. Set up a mechanism within which decisions can be made by the total group. Then, form groups to scout the island to de- termine what resources are available. Each group makes an inventory of the resources it discovers and reports its find- ings to the total group. One group tests the water for drinking and cooking. One group lists and describes the plants and animals to see which ones can be eaten. An- other group discusses the interactions of plants and ani- mals for long-range planning. One group is responsible for recording the history of this "survival quest." One team took a historical perspective of its site by de- veloping activities through which students could study lo- 339</page><page sequence="2">340 The Clearing House July/August 1993 TABLE 1 Teachers' Responses to Statements on the Project Habitat Workshop (in percentages) Statement SD D N A SA I learn the content of ecology best through lecture. 23 38 39 0 0 I learn the content of physical science best through lectures. 33 42 25 0 0 The laboratory field activities in ecology were helpful to me. 0 0 0 15 85 The classroom/laboratory activities on density and viscosity were helpful to me. 0 0 23 38 39 The classroom/laboratory activities on erosion were helpful to me. 0 0 38 31 31 The field trips were professionally rewarding to me. 0 0 0 31 69 The field trips gave me new ideas for science education. 0 0 8 8 84 The outdoor activities of Project Habitat gave me new insights on environmental education. 0 0 8 30 62 Developing science education learning activities was a valuable experience for me. 0 8 8 15 69 Learning about the science learning activities of other project participants was a valuable experience for me. 0 0 8 30 62 I would be willing to work with other teachers to improve science education. 0 0 0 31 69 Note: S = Strongly disagree; D = disagree; N = neutral; A = agree; SA = Strongly agree cal history as well as the locale itself. Another team used the remains of an old bridge as the setting for the begin- ning of a short story that their students would be asked to finish. Most teams found they had more ideas than they had time to develop. Instead of the "how much longer will this take" attitude that frequently arises during workshops, these people wanted more time. It's this kind of involvement that results in change. If there is any doubt in your mind that active work- shops are the key to change, read the responses to state- ments on the workshop format that were posed to the participants of Project Habitat (table 1). The types of statements range from those on the relatively passive lec- ture format, to those on the more active laboratory-class- room format, to those on the most active field-activity format. Statements on group work are also included. Ex- perience, we all concluded, is the best teacher. ACKNOWLEDGMENT Project Habitat was funded by a Dwight D. Eisenhower Title IIA Grant for the improvement of teaching skills and the quality of instruction in mathematics and science. The team members were Jean Pottle, Mid- State College; Charles Mlynarczyk, Potsdam College; Mary Rutley, Potsdam College; and Timothy Schwob, Potsdam College.</page></plain_text>
