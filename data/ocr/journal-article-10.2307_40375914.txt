<plain_text><page sequence="1">Television News and the Nation: The End? By MENAHEM BLONDHEIM and TAMAR LIEBES The golden age of television news gave a large majority of otherwise diverse Americans a unified, seamless, and clear-cut image of their nation, its central players, and its agenda. Carefully scheduled, edited, sequenced, and branded, heard and seen simultaneously across America, it provided a pretense of order to the chaos that is news. The permanence and stability of the nation, as expressed in a complex way by TV news, provided Americans with an all-important sense of existential security experienced on an unarticulated emotional level. Today, a disjointed news environment is crushing the nature of network news as a transitional object. Television news no longer reassures viewers by connecting them to a surmountable world out there but carries them on a loop from themselves to themselves. Keywords: television; news; news technologies; tele- graph; transitional object; nationalism 1900, people the world over got their news from the printed editions of their local news- paper. A hundred years later, they get it from a plethora of sources spanning 24/7 global televi- sion news networks and a myriad of specialized news outlets. But in between, for a full genera- tion, classical television dominated the news Menahem Blondheim teaches in the department of History and the department of Communication and Journalism at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

Nowhere was the dominance of television as obvious as in the United States. By 1960, observed Ted White, "it was possible for the first time to answer an inquiring foreign visitor as to what Americans do in the evenings . . . they watch television" (White 1961, 336). News became a centerpiece of that daily diet; so that by 1970, if an inquiring foreign visitor were to ask whence Americans get their news, a majority would answer - they watch it on television (Comstock 1991, 81-82; Schudson 1995, 181). By now, that short experience seems outlandish enough to raise wonderment but also significant enough to justify a look at its nature and texture and, further afield, at its possible significance and impact. We believe that the classic era of television news can be best understood by tracing where it came from and what it disappeared into. In doing so, we review the parallel development of media technologies, institutions, and practices, on one hand, and processes of social and cultural change, on the other. In this bifo- cal look at television and society, we place special emphasis on people s need for identity and ontological security. We propose that the golden age of television news reflected and affected a unique era in the social history of the twentieth century - an era in which the nation was the focal point of social belonging. Television news - carefully sched- uled, edited, sequenced, and branded; heard and seen simultaneously across America - could provide a pretense of order to the chaos that is news. With one anchor, one accent, one look, one message at a time, and one viewpoint of "the way things are," the evening news gave a large majority of otherwise diverse Americans a unified, seamless, and clear-cut image of their nation, its central players, and its agenda. People s sense of the reliability and the permanence of their social and physi- cal environment, as Anthony Giddens suggests, is the foundation of trust and therefore the basis for ontological security, experienced on an unarticulated emo- tional rather than cognitive level (Giddens 1984). The permanence and stability of the nation, as expressed in a complex way by TV news, provided Americans with the all-important sense of existential security. Precursors of National News America in the nineteenth century was a society of island communities in a "search for order." "Weak communications," posits historian Robert Wiebe, "severely restricted the interaction among these islands and dispersed the power to form opinion and enact public policy" (Wiebe 1967, xiii). The main medium of information and opinion of the time was the newspaper, and the source of most of the news published in American newspapers before the mid-nineteenth century was other American newspapers. This singular condition was of course a func- tion of transmission rather than of news gathering. Although each news item still had to be culled from real life to be made public, it was made known throughout the country via the circulation of the newspaper first reporting it. Since colonial times, postal policy was to allow editors to exchange their publications post-free.</page><page sequence="3">184 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY By incoming mail, they received news accounts that papers in other regions had first collected and reported. Editors then cut and pasted these bits of news in their own sheet, alongside the news they collected firsthand (Kielbowicz 1989; John 1995). This process of journalistic surveillance produced scattered bits of information and opinion from various places and sources, each reflecting its own specific concerns. Only in editorials would publishers try to correlate the pieces to fit a coherent pattern. This pattern emphasized the local but also provided glimpses of other island communities and of what was shared with them, together with an emerging awareness of a common nationality uniting them. This changed with the telegraph. Once it spread over the United States, news- papers could enter the business of reporting distant news events themselves. Far beyond its ability to speed bilateral exchanges across space, the telegraph pro- vided a new dimension of communication - broadcasting. By closing its circuits, a message sent from any station on the telegraph network could be "scattered broadcast" over the country instantaneously, in a single writing (Blondheim 1994). The news wire service was first to discover this potential. Employing the telegraph as a one-way means of transmission, it could have its report reach all points on the telegraph network simultaneously and thus could "impress the whole nation . . . with the same idea at the same time" (A Journalist 1855, 365). The telegraph s new broadcast mode had the power to centralize, even national- ize, information. By applying the telegraph s news broadcast mode, explained the editor of the New York Express in 1846, "the Union will be solidified at the expense of the State sovereignties." He predicted that we shall become more and more one people, thinking more alike, acting more alike, and having [a common] impulse. Washington is near to us now as our up-town wards. We can almost hear through the Telegraph, members of Congress as they speak.The country now will be excited from its different capitals. Man will immediately respond to man. An excitement will thus be general, and cease to be local. Whether good or ill is to come from all this, we cannot foresee.1 But this revolutionary prospect had its limitations. Unlike subsequent broad- cast technologies, this kind of news broadcast would remain a two-step process: while in each station along the national network of telegraph wires the news message would be received simultaneously, it was the local newspaper that would then take over and bring the broadcast news before the large public. In the pro- cess, national news would be embedded in local news and be presented from a local perspective. "Processes of communication are the basis of the coherence of societies and cultures," averred scholar Karl Deutsch. Therefore, he suggested, "even where we have one people . . . the range and effectiveness of social communication within it may tell us how effectively it has become integrated and how far it has advanced, in this respect, toward becoming a nation" (Deutsch 1953, 65). To judge from nineteenth-century newspapers, the process did not advance very far,</page><page sequence="4">TELEVISION NEWS AND THE NATION 185 even with the telegraph and wire service. The outbreak of a bloody Civil War a decade after the discovery of national news broadcast by telegraph would dem- onstrate that.2 If the wire service represented a national perspective tucked into local journal- ism, national magazines that emerged in the latter part of the nineteenth century were in themselves creatures of the nation. However, their infrequent appear- ance made them not much of news media - they were more a model of how common content could be attuned to all Americans.3 The Voice of National News Ironically, it was the smallest of the small media of its times that would ulti- mately link vast populations to an imagined center via news. Radio developed gradually in the 1920s from a hackers-holiday of chat and performance to a sys- tem linking an increasingly dense scattering of receivers. From high, space- binding transmission towers, it began to provide common content: the beginning of broadcast news. At first, wire service reports were read out loud as filler for the thinly populated schedule. Americans could find the same words in their newspapers (Barnouw 1966, 138). But there was a difference between the embedding of national news reports in newspaper space and radio s programming stretched over time. National news, as incorporated in the newspaper mosaic, was an element to be focused accord- ing to the readers choice (Williams 1975). Furthermore, its mere presence beside the dizzying variety of items, some local, some from other localities, some "fed- eral," and some international, precluded a sense of hierarchy, let alone domi- nance. The spatial arrangement of the newspaper underscored the discrete nature of each item and the possible independence of items and sections from each other. Radio s time-ordered nature, however, dictated full attention to any item: none could be skipped, and first things would have to be first. The first and last would be remembered best - a key endowment when, unlike the newspaper, one could not return to the fleeting, evanescent words. Thus, when it was the oracular radio talking, it talked exclusively, reflected a broadcaster s hierarchy, and could domi- nate the attention of one and many simultaneously. People could, and did, listen together; when they were listening, they knew many others, over a vast expanse, were doing precisely the same thing in the same time (Scannell 1996). 4 Thus, the voice of the nation was heard in the early news bulletins over the air. But in time, the Associated Press (AP) bulletins read by radio announcers expanded into a new kind of endogenous radio news; nonetheless, the heritage of the national focus remained. As the Second World War neared, radios voices with a persona - Kaltenborn, Murrow, Shirer, Trout, Wells - began expanding the news. And an impending international crisis led to a dramatic reinforcement of its national focus. To be more exact, the developments in Europe and Japan</page><page sequence="5">186 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY focused attention on America as a nation within a framework of contending nations. Thus, when CBS introduced World News Roundup, featuring shortwave pickups from all continents, it gathered a storm of threats to the future of the nation. When the war came, and people needed more trust and assurance than ever, radio became the voice of the nation. Its fears and hopes banked on the words, but no less on the tone, of Morrow in the Blitz, Shirer in the Reichstag. Their voices conveyed the same kind of unifying assurance that the "fresh, natural and true" voice of singer Vera Lynn gave Englishmen - "irrespective of what it might actually say."5 Like Vera Lynn, the voices of American newsmen radiated a nationwide message of consolation and hope, then celebration. They were agents of the nation and through serving it became symbols of its unity of purpose, its resolve, and its mood. As the war drew to an end, Lynn's American counterpart, Kate Smith, would demonstrate this same power to solidify and express national unity of purpose by voice. Her dramatic eighteen-hour appeal for contributions to rebuild the nation s military-industrial complex was carried live by radio. Her voice - consoling, exciting, carrying hope - made a whole nation stir and give (Merton 1946). Television News: The Face of the Nation In this historical context, television broadcast took shape. The nation's engross- ment with national news conveyed by the reigning medium - radio - impacted TV architects' idea of news by the new medium. They tried to emulate radio news' intimacy and sociability, adding a face to it. In fact, the early television news arrangements called for the network to provide the "news sources and voices"; they just "needed help with pictures." They got those by commissioning film producers to take care of the visuals (Barnouw 1990, 101). This is not to say that news was a primary programming feature in the mind of TV entrepreneurs. Television identified sports and entertainment as what might be called today its "killer applications." But regulatory pressures and public uproar over allegations of corruption surrounding the ostensibly fair play of quiz- zes made television lords nurture more responsible, public-oriented features. News topped their list. As television news developed, it became apparent that arranging for the inte- grated product of news reports, voices, and pictures would be a formidable orga- nizational and financial undertaking. Therefore, only a few bureaus with permanent personnel were maintained beyond headquarters. Inevitably, they were located at the centers that generated "federal" news - such as New York and Washington, D.C. - the White House in particular (Bennet 1996). In images such as Vice President Richard Nixon's Checkers speech, with his wife Pat in the background, or John F. Kennedy with his kids in the Oval Office, the president was treated as personalizing the nation. In this case, personalization may have shaded over to anthropomorphism. "At times," notes Leon Sigal,</page><page sequence="6">TELEVISION NEWS AND THE NATION 187 the press portrays the president as if he were the embodiment of the government, if not of the whole country. It has written of "Reaganomics" as if President Reagan had repealed the laws of supply and demand [and] personally tamed inflation. ... As people become surrogates for institutions in the minds of journalists, it is reflected in the news- gathering practices and press coverage. (Sigal 1986, 14) The same logic that led TV producers to focus on the White House guided the dispatching of mobile crews for live broadcasts out of the studio. The momentous operation and great costs involved dictated that this would happen only on rare, great events in the life of the nation, events that would focus identification from coast to coast. Whether McArthur s Chicago parade or the McCarthy hearings, television news covered the national, and the national became news. The concen- tration of media attention on the powers that be and the rituals they stage made the nation the talk of the nation, at every office water fountain (Dayan and Katz 1992, chaps. 2-3). Media convey a sense of community, which in the age of the newspapers was reinforced by the social and geographic surroundings. With television, the sense of belonging extended to the more abstract social space beyond the local. If pre- viously the newspapers helped individuals routinize their lives and respond to local challenges, now media expanded the circle of disorder and threat. The increased range of danger that media portended also gave it the added responsi- bility of allaying fears and ensuring normalcy. This was achieved by routinizing news - which could potentially break any minute - and assigning it to a particular hour, giving a sense that things are not chaotic: that all is under control and within the limits of the manageable. There will be another newscast tomorrow, "same time, same place"; hence, there will be a tomorrow. The style of news presentation by radio reinforced this sense of order out of chaos, with two variants. In the class-ridden, top-bottom U.K. society, security could be underscored by the formal "anonymous, authoritative (ruling class) voice," indicating an apparatus out there that was in charge and taking care (Williams 1975). This anonymity would be compromised by personal identifica- tion of presenters only as a security measure under the wartime threat of invasion and capture of the station. As long as the name was connected to the voice as a PIN to the user name, the content was bona fide and the realm was in the right hands. In British television, the notion of authority speaking to the people (the integrity of its control ensured by the institutions of public broadcast) was rein- forced by the corporate nature of the newscast. It was underscored in the early days of television by ensuring that the viewers saw the presenter being handed his text, or arranging these texts at the end of the news bulletin, sometimes with the news writers visible behind him (Scannell in Silverstone 1994, 1-23). In America, where bureaucracy and government institutions were traditionally suspect, and where accordingly broadcast was private-sector-driven, authority was founded on the personal. There, the same effect was achieved with "less empha- sis on a script and more on personal presentation." It assumed the form of "stud- ied informality": the effect of a group of men telling you things they happened to know (Williams 1975). As the Camel News Caravans John Cameron Swayze had it at the end of his fifteen-minute news broadcasts of the 1950s, "That's the news,</page><page sequence="7">188 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY folks. Glad we could get together" (Barnouw 1990, 103; cf. Comstock 1991, 86). In America, tremendous importance was assigned to selecting the anchor (Epstein 1973), since on the persona he radiated would lie the trust and security of a nation that trusts God and individuals but not institutions. A further characteristic of television news that can be seen in the same light is the narrative closure of each item in the parade of stories constituting the news program s lineup. In America, closure and coherence give a sense of controlled development, while elsewhere, such as in Italy, each item can be much more open, giving different perspectives on the issue, even at the price of inconclusive- ness (Hallin and Mancini 1984). This would fit the difference in the nature of that which is "national" in either society. While in Italy nationalism unites, leaving ideology divergent, in the United States, a republic of nationalities, shared ideol- ogy is what unites. Thus, in the latter, radical ideological differences are threaten- ing, and a coherent shared narrative is necessary for a feeling of cohesion and security (Arieli 1964). Television News as a Transitional Object We propose that the television newscast, as shaped by technology and institu- tions, cultural trends, and social development, transformed news into a "transi- tional object." Here we are building on Roger Silverstone s general proposition, emerging from critical theories of modernity and psychoanalytical perspectives on identity-building within the social process (Silverstone 1994). Silverstone s approach hinges on Anthony Giddenss argument that trust is a fundamental ingredient of modern people s workaday experience, enabling them to contain existential anxiety and to interact socially and ideologically with others. In moder- nity, primary personal and communal ties became less significant in shaping identity and security. Mediated portraits of society and culture take their place, shaping what Giddens (1991) calls "distant trust." According to object relations theory, as expounded by Winnicott (2005), the individual s self-identity is acquired through interaction with the social world, as represented mainly by the media. For the process of integration to succeed, and yield security, there needs to be a fit between distinct visions of the world out- side: an internal vision and external indicators of its "real" nature. Becoming a social subject requires a "transitional space" in which the subjective and the real meet; the individual can experiment in adjusting his or her internal expectations to external manifestations of the world in the quest for security. This general process can be symbolized by the child's use of a blanket or doll as real objects distinct from his or her mother, but substituting for her. Silverstone (1994) proposes using this developmental module of positioning the individual vis-a-vis the real world as a parable for the use of television by grownups, who are bereft of primary social attachments. For them, television is the ultimate transitional object - located in the security of the individual s castle but yielding to signals from a monumental external broadcast antenna, talking</page><page sequence="8">TELEVISION NEWS AND THE NATION 189 about the dangerous world out there with the confidence and assuredness of familiar, engaging faces and voices (Ellis 1982). It represents a delicate balance between alerting people to real dangers lurking at a distance (like storms or ter- rorists) or imminent in time but, at the same time, signaling that things are under control and manageable. Like yesterdays potential threats, the new ones will ultimately also be contained. Television s rhetoric, blending stark reality and promised comfort, is achieved not only by this mix of messages but also in the overall texture of television pro- gramming, underscoring regularity, authority, and continuity. While Silverstone (1994) refers to news as a mere element of the overall confidence-building nature of television, we think the entire dynamic can be focused on the televised news broadcast. Its regular and central place in the daily schedule, its fixed format, its familiar anchors and reporters and the real-world characters they routinely inter- act with - even Ahmadinajad becomes domesticated - provide security, even if illusionary. Like the pied piper of Hamlin, the anchor parades the events of the day in a queue and under the control of his rich voice, bland accent, and appeal- ing personality. The same kind of control is experienced in the overall format of the newscast that packages the day into less than a dozen items. Each is formatted in a traditional narrative structure: an introductory exposition, a story, and com- monly a personal summation, moving in an hierarchical order from top headlines to human interest. Most significant, perhaps, the news becomes a parade of visual glimpses of harsh reality in the real world, controlled by the trusted processing environment of the studio, with the anchor zooming in and out of them.6 In recasting our historical description of the development of television news through Silverstone s (1994) suggestion, the key point is the emergence of the nation as the social entity to which the individual becomes connected via televi- sion news. As Giddens (1991) suggests, in the new postwar world, the community can no longer provide security and identity. In a modernizing world generally, and in America s impersonal desert of faceless suburbs and urban jungles in par- ticular, the nation is personalized in the image of a CBS, a Walter Cronkite, and a newscast logo. They provide the sense of belonging and of safe haven, in the abstract, constructed world of the nation, built on distant and impersonal symbols and mechanisms - ones credit card, air ticket, and so on. These symbols exist only in mediation - they are parasocial - and only a simile of real social relations (Horton and Wohl 1956). But according to Silverstone, they become tokens of primary social relations. They themselves serve as the basis for sharedness in real social relations - an icon for your neighbor in the aisle seat of a Delta flight. True enough, national TV's entire content product can serve as such a prosthetic. Soap operas perhaps are the most obvious ingredient with overall development, side plots, and the regularity of familiar figures fending their way through life, in pace with the overall social clock. But this operates only on a person-to-person level, and moreover, it is packaged and explicitly identified as fantasy. No one can really think of an episode of Dallas as reality or a shared meaningful agenda. "No one in real life is really like that," to quote one of Herta Herzogs interviewees (Herzog [1942-1943] 2003). By comparison, national news can stand for reality.</page><page sequence="9">190 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Thus, most generally, there appears to have been a perfect fit between the trio of sociopolitical conditions of a world of contending nations, a society focused economically and politically on its national center, and a particular set of broad- cast technologies. Networked radio and television news could reach the nation in its entirety, but not beyond it; its regulatory constraints, economic rationale, and technological capacities all led to a focus on an imagined center of the culture within the real boundaries of the nation - an orientation to the most broadly shared within the national confines. Historically, the rise of national news in America paralleled the rise of the imperial presidency, from Roosevelt to Reagan. This congruence could have led to a parallel surge of conformism and rebellion. With a single, coherent, forceful picture of the day and the nation, the anchor and the president, the correct ideol- ogy and the right necktie width, one could either try to blend in or opt out, dis- covering how distant one really was from it all. Only a coherent picture of national political culture could give rise to alternative political countercultures: hippie curls and silver-rimmed spectacles rejecting crew-cuts and black, square frames. The Loss of Teddy Bear: Post-national News This American story of tight congruence between news programs and the nation would be paralleled, albeit with variations in the nature of broadcast sys- tems, throughout Western nations, then in developing countries (Katz and Wedell 1974). By the fin de siecle, the world and television were in the process of radical change. Globalization from without, and fragmentation from within, shattered the nation as the ultimate unit of social organization. Rather than a cold war between states, the world came to experience a rash of heated conflicts within state boundaries, between factions, cultures, and religions. Economic forces both affected and reflected this new alignment, juxtaposing the global and the local and, in effect, crowding out the national. Media would move to the forefront of this geopolitical and sociocultural pattern. National networks, and particularly their news operations, were pushed to the margins of a new media ecology focused on the parallel poles of the ecumenical and the microparticular (Blondheim 2008). CNN charted the path toward the global, broadcasting news round the clock, with breaking news taking over the rudimentary schedule as it happened. The audience of these new global players, broadcasting in the lingua franca of the times, was inevitably humankind. The Internets spread and universality repre- sented another aspect of globalization, but as a supermedium, it also unleashed communicative potentials in the opposite direction. It could maintain the univer- sal, but also the subgroup-specific, and all the way to interpersonal and small group communications, which could now be redefined in entirely new ways such as chat communities.7 But further, these trends could also liberate people from news alto- gether. National anchors are no longer an essential part of peoples media diet.</page><page sequence="10">TELEVISION NEWS AND THE NATION 191 Via both these trajectories, the nature of news as a transitional object is being irrevocably transformed. The evening news in its heyday had achieved a delicate balance between threat and trust. It not only exposed the drama and danger of events, with all the potential anxiety they arouse, but also supplied a remedy: the sense of closure and control provided by the news format and its regularity, the sheltered viewing experience, the sense of personal rapport with anchors and familiar correspondents (with all their spontaneity and reserve). These latter fea- tures had managed to balance interest and anxiety; they bred trust and a sense of credibility, competence, control, and comfort. Speculation was compensated for by certainty, the uniqueness of events by the fixity of interpretative patterns. We call this editing - the icon of the continuous fine-tuning of the open and the closed. Like any genre that is recognizable only as it is being displaced, the contem- porary news environment allows us to characterize classic television news and make out its unique nature. Only in hindsight can we appreciate its remarkable social and psychological endowment and its social functions. The new news environment is crushing the nature of network news as a tran- sitional object, on all the levels that had sustained it. Consider "place" as a place to begin: the TV set has migrated from the living room to bedrooms (Freidson 1953; Livingstone 2007), while the news is migrating from television to the office PC and to the cell phone everywhere. This reshuffle pulled the rug from under a significant element of the interface between the security and normalcy of the living room and the dangerous world outside (Ellis 2000; Gerbner et al. 1979). On the time dimension, TV news has migrated from the evening newscast to TV news magazines and variety shows, merging the news with other aspects of the world - disruptive and threatening to the individual. It would go all the way to quasi-pornographic, prurient curiosity, not exactly the sanctified context of an educated citizenry. Then, with the proliferation of rapid satellite transmission and mobile shooting crews - ultimately media-distributed camcorders - news can come from any- where, anytime, and be framed on the fly by anyone, without regard to conven- tional news and editorial standards. This can signal to viewers that anything can be expected to happen, anytime: preplanned events no longer constitute land- marks in the democratic process (note the coverage of demonstrations stealing the show from conventions, or at least sharing a split-screen with them [Danner 2000]). In fact, breaking news often steals the show from the news programs themselves. The slow, orderly pace of the latter simply cannot keep up with the urgency now given by newsrooms to world and local events exploding on viewers in real time (Katz and Liebes 2007). The mode of news presentation itself underscores these developments. What had previously signaled familiarity and order - professional deliberation, advance preparation, and tight packaging - is giving way to spontaneous improvisation. News stories are now navigated while developing, providing no clear picture of the details and conclusion of the story, let alone its moral. Most news is now live, its details being brought breathlessly as they occur. The back stage of news gath- ering now emerges with the pathetically bewildered fagade of the anchor behind an orderly desk.</page><page sequence="11">192 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Even the news net, which had traditionally fed the front of the news operation, is showing signs of breakdown: amateur reporters, passers-by with cameras and 3G cell phones, can hijack the news reporting process from the preconceived spread of the newsgathering apparatus. Candid camera - the reality of human interest vignettes - is crowding traditional reportage off the screen. Just as the former well-planned news net focused on the national - central places, institu- tions, people - the new virtual (inter)net is everywhere, diffusing the focus on the national. We are moving from General Schwartzkopfs daily press conference with the most manipulatively prepared visuals of a war that perhaps never hap- pened (Gerbner 1992; Baudrillard 1991) to embedded correspondents a decade later, giving moment-by-moment portraits of genuinely authentic fragments that do not cohere, with the reporter as frontispiece rather than backstage collator and analyst (Katz 1992). In between, nothing can underscore the collapse of news as a buffer of confi- dence and order better than televisions performance on September 11, 2001. Suddenly, the networks and CNN, just like the members of their audience, were taken by terrorized shock and awe. All were mesmerized by the larger-than-life images. Anchors and tavern sitters were simultaneously and spontaneously say- ing, "Oh my God," as the drama unfolded. With government in hiding, the awe- struck public turned to the old, trusted, news networks only to find them as shocked, if not as speechless, as they. Viewers and broadcasters had to wait for hours for the initial dust to clear, then days and months for the mystery of "who did it" and "why" to be properly addressed (Blondheim and Liebes 2002, 2003). But initially, rather than order, security, structure, context, and meaning, what live television yielded was further bewilderment. Control was no longer there: the tube of plenty went empty. With the model of classical television bowing out, perhaps even the unifying Tower of Babel yielding once again to multilingual breakdown, the quest for order, and for a source of ontological security, only intensifies. We are beyond our mandate here, separated by a new media age from the classical age of television. Understandably, with no trust, no meaning, no order, no control, and no uses and gratifications, vulnerable individuals in a threatening world seem to be zoom- ing out, rather than tuning in, to the dated stories of national televised news. On the supply side, as Paddy Scannell (1996) has suggested, classical TV news had constructed the viewer as a member of the polity, a citizen. By contrast, the new TV - particularly "on-demand" - is constructing the viewer as a private consumer while undermining television s public role. On the level of belonging, once the nation lost its hold, the trajectory of with- drawal seems to be taking us even further away - as the units of social affiliations shrink, and the virtual social affiliations remain marginal, leaving people to them- selves, to "bowling alone". People are at least as separated as they are united by the unbinding media of sites, chats, instant messaging, and microblogging. Save for vestiges of the public broadcasting tradition, television is responding to the chaos out there by offering an escapist paradise in the form of a narcissist bubble con- necting the viewer to no one but himself or herself. It features self-improvement</page><page sequence="12">TELEVISION NEWS AND THE NATION 193 and makeover - fitness, spiritual salvation, better looks, better cooking, and so on. Television no longer reassures viewers by connecting them to a surmountable world out there but carries them on a loop from themselves to themselves. The news experience seems to be following this pattern. The constant breath- less bombardment of news fragments that do not cohere and make no sense represents a breakdown of the illusion of a safe and manageable world out- side. The essence of classic television news - the routinization of the unexpected, the "excitement governed by order," works no longer (Tuchman 1973). News knowledge as provided by classic television has been replaced by scattered news bites, served and corrected on the fly, not necessarily related to anything mean- ingful outside. In other words, with the end of television, we may be experiencing the end of news. Notes 1. Quoted in the Philadelphia Dollar Newspaper, June 17, 1846. 2. The war could also be seen as a reaction to the process of nationalization. After all, according to Lewis Mumford, there was a "paradox of communication" - the greater the contact between social ele- ments, the greater the friction. Close communications may underscore difference, not commonality. Thus, a civil war would break out once dramatic technological and organizational steps had been taken toward national unity (Mumford 1963, 239-41; Blondheim 2004). 3. Only with the turn of the century would newspapers targeting mass and highly heterogeneous urban markets, such as Hearst s New York Journal and Pulitzers New York World, assume a truly national out- look. 4. Most important, when radio talked one listened, and the auditory experience is significantly different from the visual. Sound penetrates, brings the external stimulus into the individual for processing (sym- bolically, but also as a physical reality). This is in sharp contrast to both newspaper and television, although the visuality of either is quite different. The visual task of reading requires deciphering and reintegrating the visual cues, creating a barrier of active cognitive work between the message and the receiver. In televi- sion, reception is as effortless as in radio, but rather than absorbing the message within, viewers are drawn to the visual stimulus outside them. They export themselves, so to speak, to the visual source (Dresner 2005; Halberstam 2000). 5. In 1941, the BBC introduced her in a program titled "a letter from home in words and music" to the troops fighting for the nation in Europe. Although Lynn had used other peoples words and had not gone through the experiences she was describing, her power lay in her capacity to convey sincerity (Scannell 1996, 66-67). 6. According to Fiske, news is characterized by "strategies of containment" that attempt to control "reality." It plays out as a "constant struggle between these strategies and the disruptive forces that are characteristic of both 'the reality' that news refers to and the social differences amongst its various audi- ences." Accordingly, in his view, "Controlling anarchy works through the processes of selection and catego- rization (paradigmatically) and combination and narratrivization (syntagmatically)" (Fiske 1987, 282-83). 7. These trends provide an old-new focus on local news, on network TV and on news addressed to particular nonlocal groups on cyberspace. References Arieli, Yehoshua. 1964.
