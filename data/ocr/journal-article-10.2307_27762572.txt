<plain_text><page sequence="1">Animal Imagery in Miau EDUARDO URBINA The plot of Miau concerns the incessant efforts of Don Ram?n Villaamil to be reappointed to a position in the Administration and serve the two remaining months that will enable him to retire with four-fifths of his pay.1 He is unsuccessful. His goal becomes an obsession, and soon leads to a pesecution complex and a fatalistic attitude that ends in suicide. On the surface, nothing could be more cruel and less humorous. Yet the world of Miau and Don Ramon's quest possess a humorous quality considerably enhanced, as I shall attempt to show, by the reiterative use of the animal metaphor.2 Although often relegated to a secondary position or even ignored, the presence of humor in Gald?s' novels was well established by Michael Nimetz in his book Humor in Gald?s (New Haven and London, 1968).3 In it, Nimetz states that humor is deeply ingrained in Gald?s' brand of realism, acting as a source of "optimism that survives squander, misery, and death" (38). In connection with another novel by Gald?s, (El Doctor Centeno), he writes: "The distortion of reality, more often comic than not, is central to the meaning of the novel" (25). This, one may add, is also true in the case of Miau, which he considers "a vision or a fantastic journey in miniature" (56). Nimetz not only recognizes in Gald?s a "propensity for the grotesque," but also sees the novel's comic effect centered "in the word miau itself which is a combined religious-animal metaphor" (135 and 127).4 In a recent monograph on Miau, Eamonn Rodgers also recognizes its humorous tone and comic detachment, which he relates to an ironic mode rooted in Cervantes and Quevedo.5 He concludes his analysis with these words: "The comic and grotesque elements in the novel are essential to Gald?s's overall strategy, and assist in the revelation of the true depth and seriousness of the subject matter: by detaching the reader from the wrong kind of involvement in the fortunes of the individual characters and by skillful control of aesthetic distance ..." (71).6 I am interested in the reiterative use of animal imagery, animal meta phors, and animal caricatures as vehicles through which to present a morral lesson, and as expressions of an artistic will to portray actions and characters in a humorous light. The overall effect in Miau is the creation of a grotesque vision of reality intended to illustrate and satirize the vice of cursiler?a, referred to as "pintar la mona" (1025). Miau is REVISTA CANADIENSE DE ESTUDIOS HISP?NICOS Vol, XII, No. 2 Invierno 1988</page><page sequence="2">337 about the error of being deceived by one's role, by a false image of one's self, instead of dealing responsibly with the actual world and true self. For the women, life is a constant "suponer," an intricate game of role playing in the Madrilenian theatrum mundi, while VillaamiPs obsessive struggle characterizes him as an "iluso," one who does not even know "(lo que) hasta los gatos" know (1063). In this respect, I believe it is valid to read Miau as a humorous moral tale in which the message is conveyed to a large extent through animal imagery in a manner reminiscent of a bestiary.7 The use of animals, as it has already been suggested, involves several levels. I will proceed from the most immediate and common to the more specific and significant. First, there is an abundant, although not overwhelming, use of animals in colloquial expressions. Without repetitions, I have collected some twenty-five of them. They range from mere idioms, "ser muy perro" (1011), "alzar el gallo" (1020), "la madre del cordero" (1050), "m?s suelta que las gallinas" (1090), to elaborate plays on words. On one occasion, for instance, Don Ram?n expresses his complaint about his wife's lack of control with money as follows: "Si mi mujer fuera pez en vez de rana, ?ay!, no estar?a yo en seco" (1085). In all, this use of language reflects Gald?s' concern for direct speech and is a common feature of his style.8 But beyond that interest, the point of departure of my analysis is the significant overlapping that occurs between most of these metaphors and the patterns of imagery established by the word miau at other levels, and what such occurrence contributes to the cumulative humor and ironic tone of the novel, and thus to its interpretation. A second related category involves characterization by means of a simple comparison with an animal, whether because of a resemblance in physical appearance or in behavior. Nimetz seems to underestimate the significance of the use of animal imagery in Miau. He does not explore the matter, and is partially mistaken in his observation that Gald?s "probably absorbed this facile tool of character identification from Balzac" (26). Be that as it may, I tend to believe such use owes more to Quevedo than to Balzac. It is not correct either that "for ev ery major character in Miau, except V?ctor Cadalso, Gald?s devised an animal comparison" (26). In fact, there is an animal comparison for every character. This insistency gives the novel already a texture that closely approximates that of a fable and, indeed, of a humorous bes tiary. Altogether I counted twenty-two characters that are compared to animals. In some cases the comparison involves one single instance (Silvestre Murillo = rat?n [985]; se?ora Mendizabal = vaca [986]; Ponce = p?jaro frito), while in others a single character is compared to dif</page><page sequence="3">338 ferent animals (Quintina = moscona [1025] and lagarta [1100]; Pura = ardilla [1003], abeja [1067], cervatillo [1036] and pantera [1104]; Pan toja = perro de presa [1046], puerco-esp?n [1048], and perro traicionero [1089]; Guillen = sapo venenoso [1055], gal?pago [1055], tortuga [1062], and bicharraco [1089]). Don Ram?n is compared throughout the book to an old tiger, but he is also compared to a toro (1016), a mosc?n (1055) and a res (1114). All the members of the Villaamil family, which include besides Don Ram?n his grandson Luis and the three miaus - his wife Pura, Milagros, his sister-in-law, and his daughter Abelarda - are, of course, compared repeatedly to cats. Victor's animal characterization deserves special attention. His is the only case in which the comparisons seem to mark the nature of his pro gressive role as a destructive, devil-like intruder in the VillaamiPs house hold. He starts as a man of rostro tigresco (1012), and a le?n (1022), soon becomes an ?guila (1060), then he turns into a perro (1067), and, finally, he ends up as a monstruoso elefante (1101) and a bestia apocal?ptica (llOO).9 I feel no need to restate that such abundant fauna can only be conceived as part of a moral tale intended to expose humorously the grotesque spectacle of a society where deception and hyprocrisy rule and where human relations resemble a fantastic vision in which people wear animal faces. A third category of animal imagery involves extended metaphors in which a whole scene seems to take on a Disney-like atmosphere. Such is the case of the opening of the novel when the exit of the school children and the ensuing actions are compared to and described as a flock of birds, "piando y saltando" (985), expressing a primitive feeling of joy and freedom. A similar image is evoked when the employees or "p?jaros" of the Administration, as they are called, receive their pay in the midst of a general chirping and tumultuous rejoicing, and in which the pay itself is referred to as grains of wheat (1092). This association of joy and freedom with birds will occur again before VillaamiPs suicide - in what can easily be seen as an ironic full circle - only then the birds will be real (1110). Don Ram?n gets carried away by his newfound euphoria and compares himself to the humble sparrows. He thinks of them as living a life without worries, comfortable and cheap, and he wishes his wife would have been more of a p?jaro instead of a p?jara, that is, a crafty woman (1110). The irony involved in the situation totally escapes him. The birds are looking after their own survival, exploiting the circumstances, and even though they show a voracious appetite, they are prompt to abandon his company at the least sign of danger or lack of sustenance. They are, after all, animals, fierce and frightful providers, and not the carefree beings Villaamil imagines.</page><page sequence="4">339 As part of this general process of transformation of reality there is also a case of anthropomorphism in Miau. When Don Ram?n sends his young grandson, Luis, to deliver the frequent letters requesting financial aid and the elusive government job, the boy is accompanied on his errands by a dog named Canelo. On each occasion, the description of Luis' thoughts brings the reader into a fairytale-like world in which dogs think, are wiser than their masters, and even seem to talk "con meneos de cola" (992, 1004-06). This type of fabulous inversion takes place also in the person of Luis. Tired of being the object of his classmate Posturitas' abuse, he turns against him one day in a sudden fit of rage. There is then a double animal comparison and inversion and the fable takes on a dark and ironic air; the hare attacks the ferret, the partridge pursues the dog, and for once Luis becomes conscious of his ability to harm and offend others, what the narrator calls "su capacidad para la vida." I must add that the whole episode is told in a clearly ironic tone and is given a light and humorous treatment. The fight between the two boys, for instance, is called a "lucha hom?rica," and the circle of children screaming around them is said to be "danzando en torno con feroz entusiasmo de pueblo pagano, sediento de sangre" (1009). A similar but inverted metamorphosis takes place when inanimate objects come to life and acquire animal or human features. Thus, the sheaves of documents that are the daily bread of the bureaucrats become "animales vivientes, con mondongo" at the mercy of Pantoja, now the "hunter" of the Administration (1046). The school books that Luis rarely has occasion to study come to life in front of his eyes, the letters become hormigas or mosquitos (996) that jump around and eat as if they formed part of a fantastic wonderland. The mattress on which Don Ram?n lies seems to come to life one night as if to avenge itself on his body (1000). And even the leg of a chair about to be sacrificed to the fire by Villaamil exhales painful cries of protest "como si ?ste se arrancase tiras palpitadas de sus carnes secas y astillas de sus pobres huesos" (1001). This not-so-real world in which persons turn into animals and ani mals into persons, where objects come to life and life seems at times unreal, reaches its climax during the journey of Villaamil and Argiielles, the prototype of the bureaucrat, through the labyrinth of offices and Dantesque inferno of the building that houses the Administration. The consistency of Gald?s' humor, the extent and nature of his irony become truly apparent. The visit turns into a hellish nightmare and Villaamil's goal to regain entrance to such a place, his absorption with attaining a position in one of those circles, is at once comical and pathetic, truly</page><page sequence="5">340 grotesque. The two most important animals in the novel, the ones used in more comparisons and more varied ways are, of course, the cat and the tiger. These two animals form the nucleus of significance around which all other humorous uses of animal imagery in Miau revolve. I will try now to complete my analysis by presenting the multiple levels of meaning connected with the cat (the theme of cursiler?a, found in the three mi aus) and the tiger (theme of self-deception in VillaamiPs character). The three Villaamil women received the nickname miaus because of their cat-like appearance.10 Even Luis, who resents being called miau, sees them as "gatos en dos pies y vestidos de gente" (1087). The com parison proves fruitful as the novel unfolds. They not only look like cats but act like cats. They are prim and affected (relamidas), given to the street life (pindongueo) and to living beyond their means. They are, above all, pretentious (cursis), "todo pico y u?as" (996). The external manifestation of their feline attributes and behavior is the living room of their house, a ridiculous place where everything is false or decrepit. They are afflicted by a disease the narrator calls "tronitis." As Pura says, even when in need of immediate relief, "antes las camisas que las cortinas" (999). Don Ram?n is the clear victim of this life of pretense. The origin of his misfortune is indeed the cursiler?a of the miaus. He is well aware of the shortcomings of his wife as household administrator, but it is not until very much later that he sees the connection between his family's cursiler?a and his own obsessive struggle to regain entrance in the Administration (1111). This knowledge becomes doubly painful when he finds out that behind the men that gain positions and promo tions, including his son-in-law and antagonist Victor, there is always a woman. All his demented trust in the existence of a hidden and malev olent enemy comes to be a vulgar case of faldas, the "ignominia de las faldas corruptoras" (1061). His comic impotency accentuates his humor ous nature and pathetic destiny since he not only is possessed by the miaus, by their cursiler?a as if by the devil, but, unlike Victor, he lacks the means in his old age to attract a female patron. Two other notes amplify the use of the cat simile in the novel. In the episode mentioned above in which Villaamil and Argiielles jour ney through the hellish labyrinth of the Administration, Gald?s cites one of the Sue?os of Quevedo, El alguacil endemoniado.11 He not only compares Don Ram?n to a burlesque Dante, but Argiielles to Quevedo and his character, el alguacil of the Sue?o. The reference could not be more significant. It establishes a source for Gald?s' grotesque mode and humor and leads us into what I consider the main theme in Miau, self-deception. In the Sue?o, Quevedo uses animal imagery and carica</page><page sequence="6">341 ture in order to present a dehumanized view of society and a satire of the lack of justice in the bureaucracy. He also associates the world of the Administration with hell and the alguacil with the devil. In such a world, as in VillaamiPs, there is no justice or truth. We learn that hell is full of pretentious women and that it would not be a bad place if there were not so many women in it. There is also another type of hell, that created by women on this earth. These views correlate well with the ideas expressed by Gald?s in Miau about VillaamiPs double living hell, the Administration and his family, and confirms the symbolic value of the miaus as female devils creating hell for Don Ram?n, and thus embodying the sin of pretentiousness or cursiler?a. Another use of the cat imagery concerns the various meanings given to the letters in the word miau throughout the novel. Again, from the initial nickname derived from the physical appearance of the Villaamil women - which we already know to be cats in a more profound sense - the word comes to represent, in what can only be taken as a humorous and ironic turn, the acronym of Don Ramon's program of reform for the Administration: M for Morality, I for Income Tax, A for Aduanas (Tariff), and U for Unification (Consolidation) of the Debt (1050). In the latter stages of Don Ramon's madness this acronym will form the basis of further ironic transformations until it ends up becoming a re ligious symbol, a grotesque metaphor of his frustrated quest and final self-destruction. The fact that VillaamiPs momentous change in behavior coincides with his learning of the content of the couplets written by Guillen, a lame and infernal servant of the Administration of obvious Quevedesque roots, is significant for two reasons: first, the couplets illustrating Don Ramon's life from cradle to grave ridicule his goal and fixation and include the mention of some cats, which can easily be seen as the miaus, chanting the "Miserere" after his death, and second because from that moment on, throughout the melancholic and visionary stages that follow, he becomes aware of the mockery to which his person and beliefs are subjected. He then falls into a temporary state of stupor and comes out of it an even more grotesque figure.12 Soon after the episode of the couplets, Don Ram?n initiates a series of transformations of the motto based on the acronym of his Memorials, MIAU. The humorous turning of the animal metaphor into a religious metaphor marks his gradual journey towards death: Mis Ideas Abarcan Universo] Ministro I Administrador Universal] Muerte Infamante Al Ungido] Morimos Inmolados Al Ultraje] and finally, Muerte Infamante Al Universo. Given the scope of the use of animal imagery in the novel, Don Ramon's trajectory from beginning to end, from hope to despair,</page><page sequence="7">342 madness, and death, appears to be conditioned by and expressed in terms of the word miau and what it represents as negation. In the pro cess, the female miaus become the embodiment of the evil of cursiler?a through the comparisons established between cat, woman and devil. We come now to the tiger as the predominant animal metaphor asso ciated with Don Ram?n.13 As a symbol of power the image of the tiger is used ironically, precisely to underline the futility and pretentiousness of Don Ramon's ideas about the Administration's problems. The insistence on his Memorials ultimately impairs his quest for reemployment, since he is shown to be prone to self-deception in his attitude and methods, i.e. his obsessive insistence regarding his goals, his feigned pessimism, his acceptance of Victor's help even after realizing the origin of his enemy's success, the ironic transformations of his motto, and his illusory trust in Luis' vision. Thus, when the tiger is used to characterize him, it is fol lowed by a negative qualifier such as old, tuberculous, invalid, decrepit, starving, ancient, and useless. In addition, there is a well-established ironic tone and a consistent burlesque presentation of his actions that leaves no doubt as to the humorous nature of such a beast. The figure of the tiger as a symbol of man deceived by imitation and appearances is most relevant in our analysis since these are, despite his protests and complaints, the two faults that define Don Ramon's illusory existence. In fact, one could say that he is also a cursi, a grotesque figure trapped within the four walls of the word miau. In the final stages of his madness Villaamil can no longer separate the family world of deception and appearances represented by the miaus' cursiler?a from the world of deception and falseness of the Administra tion. Beneath an apparent layer of peace and resignation lives still the ferment of his obsession. The old tiger feels like biting but he has no prey: "Siento algo como una ansiedad f?sica de clavar los dientes en al guien" (1099). Instead, he turns his rage upon himself in an effort to liberate himself, to be a new man. His last acts, wandering in the streets of Madrid like a loose animal while he articulates a semi-delirious mono logue aided by the drinking of wine, are those of a man out of touch with reality, submerged in an illusory world of his own. He who started his quest at the street of Amor de Dios ends up getting drunk at an inn called La vi?a del Se?or. On the surface he seems to have sublimated his disappointment and suffering, the painful oppression of the four letters, MIAU. But his new role, that of a martyr and sacrificial victim, is, nevertheless, a new chimera, a final act of self-deception. He renounces his former goal and goddess, the Administration, abandons his family and takes his life; but his tragic flaw, his obsessive need to feel persecuted and cheated, will</page><page sequence="8">343 remain until the moment of his death. In order to assure himself of a successful suicide he reverts to his old pessimistic philosophy. The gun will only work if he thinks it will fail. His death, ironically, confirms for once his philosophy, but all that led to it, the motivation, the setting, his last words seem to diminish the transcendency of his action. The reading of Miau here offered brings us closer to the understanding of the grotesque nature of VillaamiPs quest and suicide. In the end, while the reiterative and humorous use of the animal metaphor and the narrative discourse it serves to create purposely deflate the significance of his quest for justice, liberty, and morality, they are also an effective means to illustrate the moral lesson about the vice of cursiler?a and the error of self-deception in the world of Miau. Texas A &amp; M University NOTES 1 I quote from the edition in Obras Completas, 2 (Madrid, 1975), indicating page numbers parenthetically in the text. 2 The novel has received considerable attention and has been given widely dif fering interpretations; from the presentation of the so-called slice-of-life, the social, historical, and psychological study of mid-nineteenth century Madrid and its middle class, closely and extensively observed, as in Antonio Regalado Garc?a's Benito P?rez Galios y la novela hist?rica (Madrid, 1966), to a view anachronistically Kafkian and existentiahst in Ricardo Gull?n's Gald?s, nove lista moderno (Madrid, 1960; also the prologue of his edition of Madrid, 1957). Those critics sympathetic to Villaamil and that make the system responsi ble include, in addition to Gull?n, A.A. Parker, "Villaamil: Tragic Victim or Comic Failure?" AG, 4 (1969), 13-23; G?raldine M. Scanlon and R.O. Jones, "Miau: Prelude to a Reassessment," AG, 6 (1971), 53-62; Herbert Ramsden, "The Question of Responsibility in Gald?s' Miau," AG, ? (1971), 63-78. The following believe Villaamil is responsible for his misfortune: Robert J. We ber, The Miau Manuscript of Benito P?rez Gald?s, (Berkeley and Los Ange les, 1964); G.W. Ribbans, "Ricardo Gull?n and the novels of Gald?s," AG, 3 (1968), 163-68; Theodore A. Sackett, "The Meaning of Miau," AG, 4 (1969), 25-38. In the last few years a third approach has arisen from this critical im passe and has attempted to bridge the gap by invoking an ironic perspective on the part of the narrator that allows for the paradoxical view of Don Ram?n as an heroic fool or as an unheroic tragic hero. See Arnold M. Penuel, "Yet Another View of Gald?s' Miau," REH, 12 (1978), 3-14; Mary Lee Bretz, "The Ironie Vision in Miau," TAH, 4, xxix (1978), 16-19, and Anthony Matthews, "The Unheroic Tragic Hero: Some General Considerations," AG, 15 (1980), 89-101. In the final analysis the key issue is the significance granted to Villaamil's sui cide; whether to see it as an act of rebellion and liberation or merely as a final act of self-deception. Stephen Miller in "Villaamil's Suicide: Action, Character, and Motivation in Miau," AG, 14 (1979), 83-96, tries to resolve the critical</page><page sequence="9">344 problem of the suicide by viewing it as the direct and logical consequence of ViUaamil's actions, character, and motivation, and in particular, as the result of Victor Cadalso's intervention. His analysis is precise and incisive, and shows the need to consider, first of all, the events in the plot as well as the imme diate motivation of the characters1 actions. He does not, however, take into account such elements as narrative tone, imagery, and humor in the composi tion of the novel, a fact which tends, in my opinion, to diminish the force of his argument and conclusions. 3 Nimetz' book is a concise analysis of humor in the novelas contempor?neas. Although the validity of his observations and point of view are of basic impor tance for the understanding of Gald?s' realism, they have had little apparent influence in mainstream criticism. Diane F. Urey makes no mention of Miau in her book Gald?s and the Irony of Language (Cambridge, England, 1982). See also Jennifer Lowe, "Animal Imagery in Misericordia " AG, 17 (1982), 85-88. 4 I disagree with Nimetz in his interpretation of ViUaamil's death and Luis' role. He believes the "suicide is not so much an escape as a liberation," (Humor in Gald?s [New Haven and London 1968]), 127. 5 Miau, Critical Guides to Spanish Texts, No.23 (London, 1978). The debt of Gald?s to Cervantes has been amply documented, from J. Warshaw, "Gald?s1 Indebtedness to Cervantes," Hispania, 16 (1933), 127-42, to Gustavo Correa, "Tradici?n m?stica y cervantinismo en las novelas de Gald?s," Hispania, 53 (1970), 842-51. See also Gull?n, 54ff, and Joaqu?n Casalduero, Vida y obra de Gald?s, 2nd edition (Madrid, 1961), 83-85. 6 The type of realism practiced by Gald?s in Miau is best categorized by what Harry Levin called "romantic realism" in The Gates of Horn (New York, 1963), 455. Cited by Nimetz, 21. A similar view of the interconnection of criticism, humor, and realism was expressed by Jos? Ortega y Gasset in his Meditaciones del Quijote [1914] (Madrid, 1957), 137-39, also cited by Nimetz, 20-21. See also Monroe Z. Hafter, "Ironic Reprise in Gald?s' Novels," PMLA, 76 (1961), 233-39, and Gerald Gillespie, "Reality and Fiction in the Novels of Gald?s," AG, 1 (1966), 11-31. Gald?s himself once stated that the mixture of the serious and the comic is not only more akin to Spanish realism but more adept at portraying human truth. See his "Pr?logo" to Leopoldo Alas "Clar?n," La Regenta (Madrid, 1900), in Benito P?rez Gald?s, Ensayos de cr?tica literaria, ed. Laureano Bonet (Barcelona, 1972), 216. Cited by Rodgers, 28. For an original discus sion of Gald?s' writings on realism and Gald?s' realism see Stephen Miller, "Gald?s, Aguilera y la novela espa?ola," Insula, 34, 395 (Octubre, 1979), 1 and 14; "Mesonero Romanos y la novela moderna en Espa?a," Insula, 35, 407 (Octubre, 1980), 1 and 12-13, and in particular his trailblazing book El mundo de Gald?s (Santander, 1983). 7 By applying the term bestiary to Miau I mean to underline not only the scope and humorous nature of the animal metaphor in the narrative, but also its function in the presentation of the moral lesson concerning the vice of cur siler?a and the error of self-deception. Webster's defines bestiary as "A me dieval collection of fables, allegories, and fanciful, often moralistic, stories about animals," Webster's New World Dictionary, College Edition (Cleveland New York, 1960), 141; the OED gives the following definition: "A treatise on beasts; applied to the moralizing treatises written during the Middle Ages," Oxford English Dictionary (Oxford, 1971), 825.

Among them the cat and the tiger figure predominantly, as well as many others that populate the world of Miau and that have already been mentioned. The cat is a traditional symbol of the devil and also the fa miliar of witches. In medieval times it symbolized Satan seeking to catch the soul (mouse). As a secular symbol later on it represented freedom, the ability to revert to one's real nature, as in Chaucer's Manciple Tale. It also serves as the symbol of lecherous women and, in politer circles, as an epithet for a spiteful woman (51?53). 11 Francisco de Quevedo, Sue?os y discursos, ed. Felipe CR. Maldonado, (Madrid, 1972). For a review of the different theories of the grotesque and the grotesque mode in Quevedo see "Theories of the Grotesque and Their Applicability to the Problem of the Grotesque in Quevedo," in James Iffland, Quevedo and the Grotesque (London, 1978), 17-57. Rodgers points out Quevedo's presence in Miau and, regarding the context created by the humorous use of burlesque images and characters, he observes: "This use of imagery reveals the true significance of the ironic dimension of Miau, and provides an answer to those critics who insist that we must choose between a comic and a tragic reading of the novel. The evocation of Quevedo is particularly apposite, for it reminds us that satire, at its best, transcends clever joke-making, and expresses a deep concern with the moral health of mankind" (27). See also A.F. Lambert, "Gald?s and the Anti-bureaucratic Tradition," BHS, 53 (1976), 35-49. 12 Such a trajectory, of course, parallels Don Quixote's case in the Second Part of his story when, upon learning of the existence of the First, he sees his quest for Dulcinea negated by the intrusion of a series of mocking agents and bur lesque adventures. The deceptive pastoral tranquility that precedes Villaamil's death is likewise a true quixotic note. 13 Rowland talks about the tiger as a symbol of power in all manners but also, in mediaeval times, as a symbol of hypocrisy, of man deceived by imitation and appearances (149-52).</page></plain_text>
