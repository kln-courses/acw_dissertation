<plain_text><page sequence="1">Floyd Gray. La Renaissance des mots : de Jean LeMaire de Beiges a Agrippa d'Aubigne. Paris: Honore Champion, 2008. For Floyd Gray, sixteenth-century France heralds a revolutionary self-realization of literature as an art form. This entails a corresponding self-actualization; however, before such a "birth" could become possible, a "rebirth" of the tools necessary for literature would have to take place. This prior rebirth - a rebirth preceding a birth, interestingly enough - would occur in the domain of words themselves. The transition in France from Latin to vernacular French as the chosen language commences in the sixteenth century, unleashing a plethora of linguistic forms in the absence of standardized orthographical references. Alongside this relative linguistic liberty, Gray explores the relation- ship between words and things ( mots et choses ) within the works of a number of writers. Having emphasized the importance of the context of a work as an integral factor in literary appreciation, one not to be ignored or subjected to the context of the reader, Gray begins his book with an overview of the literary and linguistic climates of the period, providing an account steeped in fascinating details pertaining to the development of French. The greatest changes in linguistic development stemmed from the monumental invention of the printing press, which provoked radical change in both the production and the availability of texts. As a consequence, words were not only being (re) born, but also reproduced at a previously unimaginable rate. In accordance with the disciplined clarity that marks the book, Gray pre- cisely delineates his project: "Notre but sera de relire un choix d'ecritures du XVT siecle selon un point de vue essentiellement litteraire, c'est-a-dire en soulignant l'apport et la participation des mots a la promotion du sens" (25) . Fortunately for Gray and his readers, word makers and players abounded in sixteenth-century France. Gray focuses primarily upon selected works of Francois Rabelais, Joachim DuBellay, Michel de Montaigne, Pierre de Ron-</page><page sequence="2">916 REVIEWS sard (along with two of his critics), Jean Lemaire de Beiges, Jeanne Flore, and Agrippa d'Aubigne. The languages of each of these writers are unique, many of which stem from that of a predecessor. The different meanings of the word invention , a favorite of Gray's, aid in understanding the process of writing at this time. In the sixteenth century, invention did not connote invention in terms of novel creation, rather it pointed toward the finding or uncovering of a pre-existing chose. "Selon cette perspective, le travail du poete consiste a 'inventer' un materiau qui existe deja et a lui conferer une forme aussi parfaite que possible" (224). To understand this phenomenon in terms of lexical production, we can turn to another schema of Gray's in which words serve as the intermediary between sounds and meanings in order to conjure things. A series of intermediaries emerges in Gray's work: words, readers, writers (who are also readers), narrators, texts, critics, publishers, etc., all act as intermediaries to facilitate the intertextuality at the heart of sixteenth-century invention. This aspect of exchange exerts primacy in the progression within Gray's book. In the case of Rabelais, Gray finds such exchanges among his various personae, including the pseudonymous writer Alcofribas Nasier, the doctor, the humanist, and the ludic linguistic inventor who pushed the limits of taste in his time. According to Gray, Rabelais fields a host of entities that find reflec- tion in his choice of words: "Une bonne lecture de son oeuvre demande en effet que Ton tienne compte de la duplicite d'une ecriture ou les mots et les choses s'affrontent brutalement et se completent mutuellement, pour former un tout" (149). These complexities lead to a writing that refuses to expose itself entirely, a writing that, like its creator, alternates between revealing and distancing its selves from the text and its readers. Gray's analysis of Rabelais' writing focuses upon its innovative nature. He attributes the ludic aspects of Pantagruel to the fact that the novel's novelties surge not from the known, but rather the unknown. With the dual goal of instructing and amusing the public, Rabelais offers a story of a giant that transitions from populaire to savant through the incorporation and employment of language. The languages of the characters serve as a means of distinction and a source of humor, often dependent upon the play between sons and sens, while underscoring the plu- rality that can impede communication within one language. Fittingly, Gray finds that Rabelais' text imposes a similarly paradoxical threat, most notably in the scene of the Librairie de Saint-Victor, in which Rabelais offers a nearly unreadable list of unreadable works, which lends itself to a frustrating intertex- tual commentary: "Peut-on ou doit-on lire un texte qui, en definitive, resiste a la lecture? Ne vaudrait-il pas mieux l'admirer en passant, en spectateur plutot qu'en dechiffreur? Serieux par son theme humaniste, ludique par sa presentation discontinue, ce chapitre inflige au lecteur un exercice de non- lecture, c'est-a-dire du mode comique" (179). Through his own resistance to customary form, Rabelais creates works that resist their readers - resistance is key in this chapter of Gray's - and thereby become capable of provoking "d'infinies renaissances" (185) via the multitude of intermediaries that con- stitute a group of readers willing to engage with the text. Gray highlights the</page><page sequence="3">MLN 917 means by which Rabelais' texts spark endless subsequent rebirth: through their interpreters' willingness to play. While Gray portrays Rabelais as a writer instigating numerous games of hide-and-seek in his texts, he finds Montaigne to represent something of the inverse, a writer seeking the confidence of his readers. While Rabelais challenges the reader to find the "real" Rabelais, Montaigne expressly seeks to equate his writing with his moi Gray engages with the anonymity of Du Bellay before exploring Montaigne: "Avant le 'moi' de Montaigne, le 'je' de Du Bellay" (197). A pivotal focus of the period thereby comes to light: "Une histoire de l'emergence du moi comme substantif et comme sujet a demon- tre que la notion moderne de l'identite personnelle commence a se former a partir du XVP siecle finissant pour devenir un acquis une cinquantaine d'annees plus tard" (201). In short, contiguous to a (re) birth of words, we find a (re)birth of the moi accompanying the (re)birth of French literature. Gray astutely identifies Du Bellay's je as paradoxically anonymous because of the poet's tendency to refer to himself as a synonymous entity, one defining itself through its similarity to other beings, constantly and purposefully turn- ing to a referent other than his je - be it Ronsard or Rome - to affirm "cet aspect negatif de lui-meme" (197). But the remoteness conditioning such introversion frustrates attempts to find a satisfactory subject matter. Gray finds that Du Bellay, in his quest for a nouvelle poesie, employs the same attempted focus upon the interiority of a subject that results in his resorting to auto- distanciation, to the detriment of the work: "La 'nouvelle poesie' dont il parle dans la Deffenceet qu'il voudrait realiser dans ses oeuvres, se reduit finalement a des considerations sur cette nouvelle poesie, la sienne autant que celle de Ronsard et ses autres amis, et ces considerations memes, ce retour narcissique du langage sur lui-meme, sont certes les moyens d'un renouvellement, mais qui porte en lui les germes de sa propre mort" (197). Du Bellay the writer becomes an intermediary link, as the "spectateur" of Du Bellay the poet. In Du Bellay's case, Gray finds the plurality of his moi to have a less innovative effect than that of Rabelais because of its obliquely referential focus upon itself. From this study, Gray looks at the difficulties bound up with criticism during the sixteenth century, specifically those evinced by the writings of Marc-Antoine de Muret and Remy Belleau as sources of critical accompaniment to different works of Ronsard. Such a supplement was necessary for two reasons: "d'une part, expliquer et defendre la pratique d'une nouvelle poesie en la renvoyant a l'exemple de ses grands modeles anciens et italiens; de l'autre, traduire en prose ce que Ronsard dit en vers et, par la, rendre sa poesie plus intelligible [. . .] a un public susceptible d'apprecier les beautes du difficile" (215-16). As the reading public comprised a small, exceptional group of people at this time, Gray finds works of difficult poetry accompanied by informative criticism to be a symptom of the need to assist and encourage the readers: "Pour cette nouvelle ecriture, il fallait un nouveau public, un public capable de la lire, mais aussi a la savourer pleinement" (224). The sixteenth-century meaning of invention as rediscovery again comes into play here. Offering explanations of the words and sources of Ronsard 's poetry, Muret and Belleau primarily</page><page sequence="4">918 REVIEWS assist his readers as they follow the poet's path of invention by return. Thus, yet another renaissance, that of the role of critic as reader alongside a text, emanates from the profusion of regenerations that mark this period. The most extensive examination in La Renaissance des mots is dedicated to Montaigne's Essais through the lens of Montaigne as a reader: a reader of other writers' work, of his own essays, and of the language of animals (thus, for us, through the lens of Gray reading Montaigne reading others' words, his own words, and the "words" of animals). This "phenomene d'intertextualite inte- rieure" (245) aptly portrays Montaigne's increasing proclivity toward reading primarily his own work, which itself stems from his prior readings of other works: "Ainsi l'essai, qui est un tombeau de lectures, devient, quant a l'oeuvre des Essais , la seule lecture de Montaigne, source vive de nouveaux mots, de nouveaux engendrements" (254). The image of a tomb here resonates with the rebirths already mentioned. Montaigne's sepulchral medium allows room for resurgences of mots of the past and for transformations of their sens via his unique perspective and profound expansions, leading to new choses - and what, after all, does Gray himself impart if not a profound rereading and resurgence of and from the fond of "entombed" texts? Montaigne's inward focus distinguishes itself from that of Du Bellay because he seeks not to make himself into others, to use others to describe himself, but instead to impose himself upon the moi of others. Gray finds this tendency towards self-imposition registered in Montaigne's treatment of animals, Plutarch, Caesar, La Boetie, Virgil, and Lucretius, and he argues for its origin in Montaigne's insistence upon an inward focus or a separate interior self common to these figures, an insistence mirroring Montaigne's own impulse to dwell on the moi of his "arriere-boutique." By allowing for animals to possess language, Montaigne humanizes them - albeit if only to use this anthropomorphic vision of animals as a pretext for his commentary upon humankind. Additionally, as Montaigne declines to publish two of La Boetie 's texts which, according to Gray, give a contradictory account of liberty, he justifies this decision by claiming that there exist two La Boeties: one interior and one exterior. Gray argues that Montaigne offers to his readers an image of La Boetie that resembles the image he presents of himself: "II y a done un autre La Boetie, celui que Montaigne a congu et construit, ou le personnage vivant est eclipse partiellement par le personnage idealise, officiel, mis en spectacle, mis au tombeau" (298). Gray points out that, by entombing La Boetie along with his more personal works, Montaigne cultivates his Essais as a site for the transformative regeneration of his departed friend. Gray moves on to note that, in his writings on physical love, Montaigne graduates his essays from the status of tomb and site of renewal to that of a body capable of replacing the body lost to the writer's past: "Au corps perdu desormais pour la volupte, il substitue ce corps compose de mots, de phrases, qui veulent garder en eux les restes d'une ferveur passee" (304) . Underscoring the pursuit of pleasure that Montaigne increasingly emphasizes as a beneficial employment of time, Gray notes the concurrent poetization of Montaigne's prose as a reflection of this attempt to "faire durer le souvenir de plaisirs qui,</page><page sequence="5">MLN 919 par leur nature, sont ephemeres" (300). Montaigne's essays thus simultane- ously represent a place of restoration and a "reservoir de plaisirs" (304) that, according to Gray, lends them the power to grant to the past the vivacity of the present. Thus, time too has room for its rebirth in the work of Montaigne. Gray comments upon the means by which Montaigne's own experiences serve as the force behind his reinterpretation of the verses of others - namely, those of Virgil and Lucretius - that he incorporates in his account of love. This account segues smoothly into La Bruyere's pastiche of Montaigne, an example of "double intertextualite" (323) in which La Bruyere speaks from within his idea of Montaigne (mirroring to some extent Montaigne's treatment of La Boetie) . Gray clearly distinguishes La Bruyere's Montaigne from the Montaigne of the Essais, all the while noting the value of such a pastiche as revelatory of the difference between the moir centric Montaigne and La Bruyere, a writer concerned with "les autres - ou lui, vu et juge par les autres" (327). From the imitative intertextuality he finds in La Bruyere, Gray pinpoints a pretext that illuminates a context, effectively concluding his study of Montaigne by accentuating this example of another writer utilizing the Essais to stimulate the rebirth of a necessarily novel Montaigne. The final section of La Renaissance des mots centers on eroticism in the writing of Lemaire, Flore, and d'Aubigne. In the case of Lemaire, Gray treats his rewriting of the judgment of Paris in Illustrations'. "II s'astreint en tant qu'historiographe a en garder les donnees traditionnelles; mais il procede en tant qu'ecrivain a leur 'invention,' s'efforgant de les faire revivre du dedans" (341). With the myth serving as the "fond" as well as the "pretexte," Gray finds that Lemaire 's rewriting - as is the case with so many other texts Gray examines in this book - turns its focus in upon its own process of intertextual rewriting: "Le mythe sert de fond et de pretexte, et c'est sur lui que Lemaire ajuste son vrai sujet, la reecriture de tout cet episode" (346). Gray here undertakes one of his closer textual readings to expose LeMaire's innovative additions in his version of the myth, including the diversification of the god- desses' personalities (and their naked bodies), as well as the inevitability of Paris' "just" judgment, given that the terms of the competition were based upon aesthetic beauty. In so justifying Paris' behavior, LeMaire justifies his own decision to describe the nude body of Venus, as this act also duly answers the call for aesthetics in writing. In his treatment of Flore, Gray primarily explores the question of Flore's unknown gender (and number) and the possible implications for Flore's parody of women's sexual situation in the sixteenth century. If Flore were a woman or a group of women, Gray claims, the work would be "radicale, voire revolutionnaire, dans son programme de reconnaissance et de legitimation de leur sexualite"; however, if the author or authors were male, this work would be "[une] ideologic de liberation [. . .] reactionnaire ou, du moins, ironique, car elle accorde aux femmes ce a quoi revent les hommes: une plus grande propension a la promiscuite" (362). Flore's habit of transsexualizing mythical figures by changing their customary genders makes manifest the "renversement flagrant des roles traditionnels" (370) in Les Comptes amoureux.</page><page sequence="6">920 REVIEWS In the treatment of the myth of Echo and Narcissus, Flore does not trans- sexualize the figures, preferring to render Echo as a far more passionate and less decorous character embodying female sexual desire. Given the context of the work, Gray again emphasizes the importance of treating each text as a unique realm of potential rebirth: "Sa version est une relecture d'un mythe ancien qui demande en meme temps a etre lu comme un mythe nouveau" (376). The particular context of Flore's work represents for Gray a "contexte partage" (379), shared with the women of its time, even if he finds the poten- tial feminist inspiration of the work to be doubtful. The final phase of Gray's investigation brings d'Aubigne to the fore for highly convincing reasons: "D'une part done, des souvenirs litteraires, mais renouveles par des rappels d'ordre personnel, L'Hecatombe a Diane et Les Stances formant un testament a la fois psychologique et poetique, ou ecriture et nature s'opposent dans d'insistantes antitheses pour affirmer la victoire definitive des mots sur la mort, a condition toutefois que la litterature les immortalise" (381). An avid reader of Ronsard, d'Aubigne serves as an illus- tration of Ronsard's paradigm: "Tout en gardant les schemas, les formules, les conventions mythologiques et metaphoriques du cycle de Cassandre, il les renouvelle en les actualisant, e'est-a-dire en greffant sur un passe de lecture l'experience d'un present qu'il aura vecu ou dont il aura ete temoin" (384). The image of renovation through transplantation once again appears in d'Aubigne 's work, with his stylistic additions to Ronsard mostly emerging in his hyperbolic tendencies and his inventive approximation of love and war, resulting in what Gray names "le poete guerrier" (385) who seeks to surmount the text. Gray therefore finds in d'Aubigne 's words a different language of anguish: "[. . .] l'aspect douloureux de son corps qu'il martyrise est un autre langage, une ecriture de 1' horrible. La douleur materialisee devient objet de lecture; la distance entre le signifiant et le signifie est comblee" (394). D'Aubigne evokes a literary world in which words no longer suffice, raising the problem of the difference and distance between ecrire and dire and leading the poet to write of cries and wails. According to Gray, it is this frustration that pushes d'Aubigne to the innovative heights of lexical production and power: "Par une vaste extension du champ metaphorique, il accorde aux mots des pouvoirs extremes" (400). In La Renaissance des mots, Gray manages to span the entirety of the sixteenth century with his captivating study of rebirths spawning rebirths. With histori- cal acumen, Gray offers his readers a more profound understanding of the fecundity intrinsic to all renaissances, be they of words, writers, or texts. His concluding sentence succinctly and clearly encapsulates the vast subject of regeneration emergent in this period: "La volonte litteraire de tout un siecle se concretise dans des mots qui deviennent des choses qui durent a jamais" (400). It is thanks to writers like Gray that the final clause of this sentence remains true. The Johns Hopkins University ABIGAIL ALEXANDER</page></plain_text>
