The date is not insig nificant: a certain millennial fervor does tinge the essay, if delicately, and must be taken into account as we read it. That tinge is apparent in its opening and closing, as James sketches a messianic role for the West in the future of Amer ican philosophy. The essay begins with a generous description of the West as an Eden "of the solid future of mankind," albeit a new world that would de 1 William James, "Philosophical Conceptions and Practical Results," in Collected Essays and Reviews (New York: Russell &amp; Russell, 1969), 412-413.

We are examining James's legacy today, after all, almost precisely a century after the 1898 essay invented pragmatism, with a little help from Charles S. Peirce. Talking at the end of a century about a legacy that began exactly a century ago positively invites the millennial mindset. Those who stand at the door joining two centuries see, or imagine that they see, tendencies in the century behind, and are tempted to prophesy about those tendencies in the next millennium. In what follows, I want to take my cue from James and ask about the tracks pragmatism has left across North American theology over the century. To be specific, I want to ask how this heritage has played itself out in the Chicago School, and in particular, one of its founding figures, Shailer Mat hews. As is well known, a significant legacy of the early Chicago School is its exploration of the socio-historical dimensions of doctrine. In a number of important essays, and throughout his major works, Mathews examines the social basis of doctrine. As he does so, his vantage point is thoroughly Jamesian: in his writings about the socio-historical method, he is to a great ex tent working out the significance of pragmatist insights for systematic theology. What follows will be a retrospective, then. I want to track James's legacy as it moves through Mathews's socio-historical method. But I also want to examine a certain trajectory that I see James's ideas following into the next century, as they pass into other theological territories. Here, I am concerned with how the philosophical tradition underlying early Chicago theology con tinues to unfold in feminist theology, as it explores the hermeneutical impli cations of feminist readings of the doctrine of God. This project is an unfin ished one, one that will be ongoing in the next century. As it builds on the pragmatist foundation, the feminist theological hermeneutic has raised pro 3 James, "Philosophical Conceptions," 407-408. 4 Ibid., 437.</page><page sequence="3">_Vol. 20, No. 3, September 1999_193 vocative questions about how to evaluate the truth claims of doctrine in light of doctrine's social effects. These represent the future of theology, and so demand careful attention. I. The Double Intentionality of Doctrine: The Feminist Theological Challenge In recent years, North American theology has witnessed a resurgence of interest in what at first glance appears to be a rather old-fashioned question: how does one make sense of the tradition's multivalent ways of talking about God? Though this revival of interest in God-talk broaches traditional ques tions, it does so, however, from a remarkable new vantage point, one arising out of the global movement for women's liberation in the twentieth century. In the past two decades, such ground-breaking studies of the doctrine of God have appeared as Sallie McFague'sMo?fe/.s of God, Elizabeth A. Johnson's She Who Is, Carter Heyward's Touching Our Strength, Jann Aldredge Clanton's In Whose Image?, and Anne Carr's Transforming Grace5 From one standpoint, these might be regarded as revisionary assessments of the history of the doctrine, ones that seek to add a feminist embellishment to an unbroken and unchallenged tradition. I submit, however, that they signify something quite different, with a radical sting for the received tradition. They are also?and herein lies their importance and yet-to-be-completed project?a call for new ways of understanding the truth claims of doctrine in general, and, in particular, the relationship between doctrinal truth and its social context. The studies I have cited are fundamental revisions of the received tradition, and not merely an interesting new presentation of it. Carr suggests this in a particularly striking way. In a provocative summary statement of her intent, Carr formulates her project as follows: "The interpretive framework of our time must include critique of the social effects and ideological uses of symbols and doctrines of God as well as ethical and 5 Sallie McFague, Models of God (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1987); Elizabeth A.

But I believe that Carr means something quite different: in declaring that the double intentionality of doctrine and the appropriation of this through social analysis are central to the herme neutical objective of theologians, Carr is refraining that objective at a funda mental level. She is contending that one can never adequately discuss the meaning of doctrine without recognizing that this meaning is always, in part, the effect doctrine has on real people in real places at real times, on somebody somewhere somewhen. In short, Carr opens systematic theology to social analysis as an indispensable starting point for its fundamental hermeneutical task. If we take Carr seriously, we cannot comment on doctrinal meaning at all without social analysis. To summarize: Carr's description of the hermeneutical task (one en dorsed in various ways by the other theologians I have cited) both appeals to human experience as the locus of theological reflection, and recognizes that, once theology has made what Gregory Baum calls the turn to the social sub ject, it cannot investigate the truth claims of religious symbols without analyzing how those symbols impact people. Note that this description also builds socio-ethical critique into the very foundations of systematic theology. In each respect?the appeal to experience, the turn to the social subject, and the resort to ethical analysis?recent feminist work on the doctrine of God both draws on pragmatist insights, and moves them in compelling new directions. Both the heritage of feminist theology and its promise for the future are apparent when one examines the Chicago School's mediation of James's pragmatism to American theology. 6 Carr, Transforming Grace, 110. 7 Ibid., 102.</page><page sequence="5">Vol. 20, No. 3, September 1999 195 II. The Chicago School and the Socio-Historical Method For those familiar with such early Chicago theologians as Mathews, G.B. Smith, and Shirley Jackson Case, Carr's assessment of how systematic theologians approach the interpretive challenge rings some familiar changes. Early Chicago thinkers had, after all, an intent concern to describe the process of doctrinal development, and that shaped the formative work of their school. Out of that concern flowed what Chicago theologians called the socio historical method, whose originating impulse E.D. Burton succinctly sketches in an 1898 essay, "The Function of Interpretation": Can we, then, have a perfected theology today?. . . The answer must certainly be in the negative. Theology must wait for history; history must wait for criticism; criticism must wait for interpretation, and interpretation again for criticism.8 As Robert Funk has pointed out, because this is a seminal description of the method that would mark Chicago School theology in its first phase, it demands attention.9 Note that Burton's essay appeared in the same year in which James laid the foundations of pragmatism. Note, too, how both accent the unfinished sweep of interpretation. From a pragmatist standpoint, theology's herme neutical endeavor will always be complex, because never finished; it is attendant on criticism, and criticism arises out of historical change. The theology that moves from such a starting point never quite catches up with 8 Ernest D. Burton, "The Function of Interpretation," American Journal of Theology 2(1898): 52-79. 9 Robert W.

Smith, S.J Case (Lewiston, NY: Edwin Mellen, 1996).</page><page sequence="6">196_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ itself, never can do so, since history is not ever complete: "Theology must wait." As Edwin Aubrey notes, commenting on Mathews's socio-historical program, "to insist upon a definitive essential doctrine is to miss the whole point by supposing that a doctrinal formula suited to the intellectual climate of the questioner is identical with the experience which it thus tries to formulate"10 From this vantage point, theologians must constantly revise their appropriations of the meaning of doctrines, because history will continuously disclose new vistas on this. It is not beside the point to note that, in an important theological section of his 1898 essay, James himself states this, as he comments on the effect pragmatist thought will have on the doctrine of God.11 It is essential to recognize as well that Burton's definition incor porates criticism (that is to say, ethical analysis) into the interpretive under taking of systematic theology at a fundamental level, and not as an after thought. This definition opens the door to ethical analysis at the ground floor: what criticism discovers about the effect of doctrine on somebody somewhere somewhen has indispensable import for how we understand the truth claims of doctrine. The pragmatist pedigree of these ideas has not escaped scholars' attention. As Bernard Meland observes, a direct line runs from James to the Chicago School's socio-historical method: in its intent to describe how doctrine functions in a given socio-cultural milieu, it exhibits a pragmatist posture that sets it apart from the idealizing approach of Ritschlianism.12 Meland thinks that pragmatism was mediated to Chicago theologians largely by John Dewey, who popularized the philosophy throughout the university in its early period. In Meland's reading, the university's sociology department 10 Edwin E. Aubrey, "Theology and the Social Process," in The Process of Religion: Essays in Honor of Dean ShailerMathews, ed. Miles H.

Meland notes the influence of the department's studies of social psychology, which in turn affected how the discipline of history came to be perceived at Chicago.13 For Meland, Chicago School pragmatism found its most significant expression in the empirical methodology of socio-historical theology. Chicago theologians used this method to assess how faith statements function in a particular social setting, by discerning the "motives behind actions, affirm ations, and words."14 In probing for sub rosa motives beneath history's surface, Chicago theologians hoped to expose the "felt needs" (a phrase that peeks out every where in Mathews) that a doctrine aims, albeit unconsciously, to express. These in turn focus attention on the social environment within which faith affirmations take shape; as Meland points out, "for the Chicago School, the social experience of the Christian people at various stages of its history provided the locus of theological inquiry."15 G.B. Smith thinks that this experience-based, sociologically astute theology is functionalist in the best sense of the term: it presupposes that "all conceptual knowledge must be functional to be meaningful so that any idea must be tested 'in the experience of living persons.'"16 This is not to say that Chicago functionalism reduces doctrinal meaning to the role doctrines play in a social environment; but it is to insist (rightly, in my view) that we cannot grasp their significance without adverting to their social function. 13 Ibid., 18.

Since the Chicago theologians, Mathews above all, believed with a vengeance that the church had a moral obligation to assist such movements, their analysis of the contexts within which doctrines took shape in the past is implicit commentary on factors that promote or inhibit the expression of key religious values in contemporary society.18 Note that the competing visions have much in common: they are war ring evangelical visions; shared bloodlines embitter their conflict. For both, it is a given that the church must assist the moral reform of society. But their social analysis and strategies based on that analysis are wildly at odds. Because fundamentalism tends to view salvation as a transaction between an interventionist God and a solitary individual, it tends to frown on moral crusades that envisage society as the zone of salvation. The fundamentalist system pictures societal reform occurring only as individuals are brought to salvation. With its organic, evolutionary outlook, Chicago theology takes an entirely different approach. The missionary zeal informing early Chicago thought is apparent in the battery of structures the School developed to disseminate its evangelical vision. When William Rainey Harper founded his correspondence school of Bible studies, the Institute of Hebrew, at Morgan Park Seminary in February 1881, he did so with the avowed purpose of "democratizing biblical scholar 17 In addition to works already cited, see Larry E.

Stone notes the significance of the ethical emphasis as one of the distinguishing marks of early Chicago School thought: see "Preface," v.</page><page sequence="9">_Vol 20, No. 3, September 1999_199 ship."19 The phrase betokens more than academic zeal. Undergirding Harper's intent to introduce a wide church audience to higher criticism was an evangelical game-plan designed to counteract pre-millennialist influence in American churches by checking fundamentalism with biblical scholarship. In October 1889, Harper took his campaign to a new level by founding the American Institute of Sacred Literature, which operated in conjunction with that indefatigable organ of popular education (and progressivism) called Chautauqua. When Harper became president of the University of Chicago, he brought his crusade with him, making it a virtual department within the divinity school. In 1896, he formed a Council of Seventy, theologians and ministers committed to lecture on the Chautauqua circuit, to shape the social mind of the day and combat pre-millennialism. Through his journal Biblical World, in which many Council members published, Harper made these teachers available to an even broader audience, hoping to introduce higher criticism in a palatable, if anemic, form to as many church-oriented Americans as the journal might reach.20 From the beginning of his career at Chicago in 1894, Mathews immersed himself in the work of the Institute and the Council of Seventy. Biblical World, which he edited after 1912, became one of the primary vehicles for his early work, publishing such significant foundational essays as the 1902 series "The Social Teaching of Paul," which figured largely in Mathews's important survey of biblical theology, The Messianic Hope in the New Testament21 In a brief retrospective of the Chicago School, why take time to tell this story? I do so not merely because historical contexts always demand 19 See John Henry Barrows, "The American Institute of Sacred Literature: A Historical Sketch, 1881-1902," Biblical World 19 (1902): 214-222.

In key respects, the battle between fundamentalist and historically sensitive readings of the foundational texts of the Judaeo-Christian tradition has grown only more fractious since Mathews's period, and its political implications starker. Unless one takes the fundamentalist factor, religious and political, into account, it is impossible to understand, for example, much that has taken place after the election of one William Jefferson Clinton to the presidency of the United States. To recognize this is to reiterate a central contention of socio-historical theology: that is, whenever we examine the real-life trajectory of a religious idea, we discover that religious ideas always have political implications, and theologians always think against socio-political backdrops. As early Chicago theologians insisted, once a religious idea enters a socio-political milieu, it becomes, or becomes more transparently, an unfinished idea, one that will continue to divulge unexpected significance in relation to the historical setting in which it finds itself. And to say that is also to remind ourselves that the story we have just heard is a yet-to-be-finished one, one that is still writing itself across both socio-political and religious screens, as the pragmatist insights mediated to American religious thought by figures such as Mathews take new shape in the work of theologians such as Carr. III. Mathews's Socio-Historical Method and the Doctrine of God he preceding account talks about the socio-historical method in general A terms. I want now to ask how that method functioned for a particular Chicago theologian. In any discussion of the genesis of socio-historical theo logy, Shailer Mathews deserves important consideration, since, in key respects, his work is the template for that theology. To pay attention to what Mathews made of pragmatist ideas as he crafted them into a socio-historical method is to attend to what the Chicago School itself made of these ideas. For Harvey Arnold, with its "pragmatic, critical, experimental, functional approach to knowledge of any kind, whether religious or other," the socio-historical method was the unifying center of early Chicago School thought.22 Arnold 22 Near the Edge, 27,34-35. See also Stone, "Preface," vii.</page><page sequence="11">_Vol. 20, No. 3, September 1999_201 thinks that, among the early Chicago theologians, Mathews "carried it [i.e., the socio-historical method] to its greatest heights and length."23 In his view, with its methodological summary of socio-historical theology, Mathews's 1916 essay on the historical study of religion is "nearly a complete guide to the mind of the Chicago School in this first phase."24 What Mathews made of the socio-historical method, and his prag matist assumptions, are perhaps most manifest in his work on the doctrine of God. From early in his career through his final book Is God Emeritus?, a central problematic for Mathews was to understand the various forms this doctrine has taken, and the core intent within those forms. In Mathews's view, the socio-historical conditioning of all doctrine is nowhere so apparent as in the diverse faith statements religious groups have made about the nature of God. Moreover, as Mathews constantly insists, when we examine creedal statements in their social contexts, we discover that, without exception, they depend on those contexts: as they reach for language about the divine, the analogies on which creeds draw are invariably socio-political. As even a cursory glance reveals, in everything Mathews wrote about the doctrine of God, the experiential foundation is foregrounded. Both in es says dealing with the topic and his major work The Growth of the Idea of God, Mathews consistently employs a socio-historical approach that correlates shifts in social paradigms with shifts in theological patterns. He sees theo logical and social minds as intertwined, and doctrine taking new shapes as social consciousness changes. In their mutual give and take, Mathews finds theologians persistently borrowing analogies from the social realm. Mathews's experiential base is apparent as early as 1895, in one of his first Biblical World editorials, which flatly declares that every doctrine 23 Ibid., 35. 24 Ibid., 38. The essay to which Arnold refers is "The Historical Study of Religion," in A Guide to the Study of the Christian Religion, ed. Gerald B. Smith (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1916), 19-79. In addition to this essay, Mathews's most significant exposition of the socio-historical method occurs in the following essays: "The Evolution of Religion," American Journal of Theology 15 (1911): 57-82; "The Social Origin of Theology," American Journal of Sociology 18 (1912): 289-317; "Generic Christianity," Constructive Quarterly 2 (1914): 702-723; "Theology and the Social Mind," Biblical World 46 (1915): 201-248; and "Theology from the Point of View of Social Psychology," Journal of Religion 3(1923): 337-351.</page><page sequence="12">202_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ expresses religious experience.25 This insistence marks all Mathews's thought about doctrine. In a classic formulation, the essay "Theology and the Social Mind" puts the point this way: "Needs are always the mother of theology."26 For Mathews, this means that doctrinal statements necessarily take their cue from social patterns: as communal statements of religious experience, doc trines have no choice except to employ the language of the culture in which they take shape. Theological language is analogical both because the ex perience it stretches to convey transcends language, and because it must resort to the only language available to it, that used by a given group in everyday social interactions. When Mathews applies this insight to the doctrine of God, the soteriological intent of the doctrine emerges strongly: "The doctrine of God is . . . fundamentally soteriological. God is not only a creator. He is a re-crea tor."27 That is?and Mathews ceaselessly harps on this?soteriology is the raison d'etre of all God-talk and an indispensable criterion for judging wheth er faith affirmations are true to the tradition. From the standpoint of the tra dition, soteriology is our sole rationale for delving into God's nature, since our access to that nature is only through salvation history: "The Christian religion is the religion of those who accept Jesus as the revelation of the saving love of God. Their theologies have varied, but he has always been central."28 Mathews's analysis of the Nicene creed underscores this.

That statement points to soteriology as its center, without acceding to metaphysical speculation that goes beyond this soteriological intent.30 This eschewal of speculative metaphysics is pre eminently evident, Mathews thinks, in the creed's resort to social analogy, rather than metaphysical discourse: In vocabulary and in authority the trinitarian doctrine was a striking illustration of the way in which an analogy by virtue of widespread social usage becomes a pattern of thought. What is regarded as the most, if not the only, genuinely metaphysical dogma of the Christian religion is thus in fact a development of a social practice given metaphysical standing by political as well as by church authority.31 Mathews's resistance to a metaphysics of mere speculation elicits suspicion of dualistic theologies that see God and the world as polar opposites. As both Growth of the Idea of God and Is God Emeritus? suggest, this suspicion arises out of Mathews's judgment that such theologies undermine soteriological understandings of the doctrine of God.32 This judgment depends on an ethical warrant so omnipresent in Mathews's thought as to be founda tional to it, a warrant The Church and the Christian defines as follows: "Formulas which are not basically moral, distract attention from social situ 29 Mathews, The Growth of Idea of God (New York: Macmillan, 1931), 139-40. 30 Ibid., 140; see also 138.

In Mathews's view, a social ethical im perative drives all doctrine, and when it is muted, doctrine degenerates into verbal game-playing with no claim on human behavior. Here, Mathews's thought dovetails with James's?in particular, with his assertion that life and action precede definition and abstraction: What keeps religion going is something else than abstract definitions and systems of logically concatenated adjectives, and something different from faculties of theology and their professors. All these things are after-effects, secondary ac cretions upon a mass of concrete religious experiences, con necting themselves with feeling and conduct that renew themselves in saecula saeculorum in the lives of humble private men.34 As this suggests, James shares Mathews's aversion to metaphysical specu lation that makes no difference for action. James notes that, while discussions of God's aseity might be diverting philosophical amusements, they have no ultimate impact on human behavior. Mathews's emphasis on the real-life cash value of faith statements clearly has a pragmatist lineage. James's experiential slant yields the following truth criterion: "Ac cordingly, in every genuine metaphysical debate some practical issue, however remote, is really involved."35 Doctrines of God without pragmatic application do not have the hallmark of truth, since "the principle of practicalism says that the very meaning of the conception of God lies in those differences which must be made in our experience if the conception be true."36 Note the bottom line: the truth or falsity of a doctrine can be ascertained by examining how it works itself out in practice. Mathews's reflection about metaphysics is located in a similar setting. 33 Mathews, The Church and the Christian (New York: Macmillan, 1938), 105. On the centrality of moral intent in Christianity, see also "Jesus' Conception of His 4 Way,'" in Jesus ' Way ' of Living, 26. 34 James, "Philosophical Conceptions," 427-428. 35 Ibid., 418. 36 Ibid., 424.</page><page sequence="15">_Vol. 20, No. 3, September 1999_205 For Mathews, a valid metaphysics effaces itself before the salvific presence it limps to describe, "the presence in the historical process of a God who is more than a metaphysical formula."37 All sustainable metaphysical reflection has, in one fashion or another, tried to codify the experience of salvation: "The God of the Christian ... has been more than a metaphysical problem or an abstraction. He has been personal. To this conception the trinitarian formula has contributed. For it served a profoundly religious need."38 At the "heart of metaphysics," then, is the theological challenge, pro ceeding from the incarnation, to reconcile the perduring experience of a saving God with the changing historical conditions in which people live.39 When Mathews insists that Jesus "has functioned as God in human experience," and that "the deity of Christ is real, but not a metaphysical reality,"40 he is claiming that a valid metaphysics has its origin in, and makes a difference in, history. To the extent that accounts of God's nature fly from real-life situations into the metaphysical clouds, they betray their authentic role in the tradition. God-talk that is adequate to the soteriological axis of the tradition thus envisages God as a "motivating influence in human life."41 As Mathews notes, within the manifold forms the doctrine has taken, the constant factor has been the religious experience it enshrines, rather than the various metaphysical articulations ofthat experience. Hence, "the God of the church has not been a doctrine of God but an inspiring personality. However explamed, religious experience is real."42 And if it arises out of experience, authentic discourse about God must orient itself back there, as a guide to behavior: "Ideas of God help give content and direction to religious behavior."43 To fathom the meaning of the doctrine of God, we must focus on the behavior of the community that forms around the experience of God: "The meaning of the word God is found in the history of its usage in religious behavior."44 37 Mathews, Patriotism and Religion (New York: Macmillan, 1918), 139. 38 Mathews, Growth of Idea of God, 139. 39 Mathews, Faith of Modernism, 68-9,74. 40 Mathews, "Can We Have Religion without God?" in Humanism: Another Battle Line, ed.

No doctrinal formula can be regarded as complete, because history itself is not yet ended. The constant in the tradition's doctrinal assertions is, then, not some un changing metaphysical essence that they capture, but the unvarying role they play in pointing to the experience of salvation: the term God "has never had a final definition, but it has always had an identical function."45 Mathews follows James's lead, then, in defending metaphysical analysis to the extent that it explores the experiential basis of doctrine. Despite his radical Jamesian suspicion of speculative metaphysics, Mathews refuses to dispense with metaphysics altogether, precisely because of his concern for how the doctrine of God functions as a guide to moral behavior. As Growth of the Idea of God insists, to talk about God at all?that is, in a way that makes a difference for human behavior?demands "a postulate of meta physical reality."46 This claim sounds with increasing frequency in Mathews's work in the post-World War I period, as socio-historical theology came under attack from fundamentalists and neo-orthodox theologians. A 1928 essay, for instance, argues for a continuing need for metaphysical language in religious education, as a defense against the temptation to substitute psychological con structs for a real, and really salvific, God.47 This is not an opportunistic contention, one solely dependent on the polemical circumstances in which the later Mathews was writing; the critique of reductionistic functionalism appears as early as his 1907 work The Church and the Changing Order,48 None theless, it takes sharper focus in Mathews's later writings. 45 Mathews, "Can We Have Religion without God?" 148. 46 Mathews, Growth of Idea of God, 195. 47 Mathews, "What Is the Task of Leadership in Religious Education?"

As Mathews notes, "We need faith in God rather than in reflexes, glands, and non-theological theology" (ibid.).

Mathews et al. (New York: Appleton, 1924), 389-90.</page><page sequence="17">_Vol. 20, No. 3, September 1999_207 What is at stake then surfaces in works such as a 1930 essay on the religious basis of ethics, where Mathews argues that "the conception of God must be objective if religion is to provide a basis for ethics."49 Because of his concern to highlight salvific experience as the basis of theology, the late Mathews critiques secular humanism in words that would warm the hearts of conservative evangelicals today: a 1935 essay, for instance, attacks humanism for not asking metaphysical questions.50 An interesting strand in the later Mathews works out the claim that, since theology arises from experience, metaphysical language serves theology truly when it mediates experience, rather than departing from it. Mathews's classic 1923 essay on theology and social psychology frames the argument as follows: when we examine the development of any doctrine, we discover that, though philosophy is important for theology, it is not its originating impulse; social experience is that impulse.51 Philosophy's role is to assist theology by helping to conceptualize an experience that is more immediate to theology than to itself.52 And, since "the vocabulary of historical orthodoxy is that of social experience," philosophy fulfills the handmaiden function by remaining experience-bound in its conclusions.53 Or, as Is God Emeritus? notes, a viable metaphysics is oriented to life first, and to thought secondarily: "Metaphysical formulas, as truly as revelation, derive the content given the word God from the experience of those who have sought divine aid. . . . The God of metaphysics as truly as the God of theological revelation is a projection of a 49 Mathews, "The Religious Basis of Ethics,' 'Journal of Religion 10 (1930): 222-231. See also his Growth of Idea of God, 190,193-194, critiquing reduction of God to social projections and the divorce of religion from its roots in popular religious experience; and Christianity and Social Process, 47, where Mathews argues against the idea that religious behavior can be indifferent to theology: he maintains that we cannot detach beliefs from theological formulations, which consolidate Christian attitudes and so preserve the Christian movement. 50 Mathews, "Is God Emeritus?"

As he maintains, lacking experiential referents, we have no hermeneutic access to anything at all. As the essay 'Ts God Emeritus?" observes, "human experience is really the basis of all description."55 The book of this title glosses the claim as follows: "Human experience is the basis of all description. There would be no knowledge of our friends and neighbors without anthropomorphism."56 On this basis, the study concludes that "the starting point for any understanding of religion must be humanity rather than revelation or metaphysical formu las."57 The experiential warrant for metaphysics is delineated in a significant passage in the 1930 The Atonement and the Social Process: In speaking of God we use our experience as in the formation of any other concept, and this will be inevitably poetic or symbolical. But do not even the scientists the same? . . . There seems to be no way of understanding our world except as its scattered elements are brought into the order of some intellectual form bom of experience.... When, therefore, we organize our conception of God by the use of our experience as persons, we are not outraging any intellectual respect ability. We no more know gravitation and light than we know God.58 54 Mathews, Is God Emeritus? 22; see also 34. See also The Gospel and the Modem Man (New York: Macmillan, 1910) where Mathews argues that the role of metaphysics is not to establish faith, but to support it after it has been established (240). This passage notes both the necessity for and apologetic limitations of metaphysics (239-241). As Aubrey notes, "he (i.e., Mathews) reaches a metaphysics, but he refuses to start with a metaphysics, choosing rather social life as a historian's starting-point" ("Theology and the Social Process," 48). Meland echoes this by pointing out that Mathews resisted seeing the theologian as one who probes metaphysical truth; for him, this was role of church. In his view, the descriptive task was more at heart of theologian's vocation ("Empirical Tradition," 20-1). 55 Mathews, "Is God?" 394. 56 Mathcv/s Js God Emeritus? 32. 57 Ibid., 27.

Counter balancing his insistence on the need for metaphysical language is, everywhere in his writings, a strong critique of metaphysics that is merely speculative. In some instances, this issues in a wholesale condemnation of metaphysics, as, for instance, in a 1930 essay on religion without God, where Mathews concludes that arguing for an objective referent to the term God is not arguing for metaphysics, since metaphysics abstracts from experience to say more than can be said about the meta-experiential.59 Elsewhere, Mathews identifies the problem with metaphysics as its lack of "motive power."60 Doctrine's ability to stimulate ethical behavior should be at the forefront of any attempt to ascertain its validity, he thinks: "Christian truths, like mathematics, have significance only as life is organized in accordance with them."61 As the essay "Theology from the Point of View of Social Psychology" insists, the truth of theological affirmations derives from life, not from abstract clarity.62 Mathews's impatience with speculative metaphysics crops up also in works outlining the social minds that have been formative for doctrine over the centuries. These persistently claim that, to the extent that the Hellenistic social mind preferred speculation to action, it failed to imprint itself in any lasting way on Christian doctrine. It did not do so, Mathews thinks, because it was merely diversionary: it arose from a milieu of frustration, in which creative thinkers turned to speculation because their energies for social construction were thwarted.63 As Christianity and Social Process suggests, "it is little wonder that men in moments of distress should prefer formulas incapable of 59 Mathews, "Can We Have Religion without God?" 135-149. On Mathews's constant distrust of philosophical speculation, see Aubrey, "Theology and the Social Process," 19; Aubrey attributes this penchant of thought to Mathews's historical training. 60 Mathews, Growth of Idea of God, 221. 61 Mathews, Creative Christianity, 137. 62 Mathews, "Theology from Point of View of Social Psychology," 347. 63 On this, see "Generic Christianity," 709-10; "Theology and the Social Mind," 216; "Theology from the Point of View of Social Psychology," 340-341; Jesus on Social Institutions (New York: Macmillan, 1928), 147; Atonement and Social Process, 90; Growth of Idea of God, 133-134; and Christianity and Social Process, 37.</page><page sequence="20">210 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy verification as an escape technique from social tasks."64 Mathews's analysis of the doctrine of God and its metaphysical impli cations results in a methodological mandate: since doctrinal truth claims are adjudicated first and foremost in the social arena, the theologian has a hermeneutical obligation to be historically minded and sociologically curious. It is theologians' unwillingness to acquire those traits that drives their work in metaphysical directions, in the negative sense of that term: "To discuss the truth of various religions regardless of their social origins and relations is to plunge into abstractions and drift toward metaphysics."65 IV. The Continuing Pertinence of Socio-Historical Theology s my opening discussion of James asserts, the millennial perspective xA^invites one both to assay broad tendencies in the past, and to predict the direction these will take in the future. Until now, I have tracked the pragmatist impulse through the early Chicago School, and Mathews in particular; and I have noted concurrences between Chicago pragmatist theology and recent feminist work on the doctrine of God. In my concluding remarks, I want to shift the focus: I want to ask what these tendencies of thought might offer theology in years to come. Since identifying historical patterns is a securer venture than predicting the future, my concluding remarks will be briefer than my prefatory ones. Put differently, we are asking about Mathews's lasting legacy. As critics have noted, his work is in some respects seriously dated. His often untempered confidence in progress and human goodwill, and his sanguine appraisal of the civilizing influence of modern science, place him in an historical context that has receded irretrievably from us after two world wars, Auschwitz, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Bull Conner and the bombing of black churches in Birmingham, the Vietnam debacle, and the mean, lean policies of political leaders purporting to exemplify the best in the Judaeo-Christian moral 64 Mathews, Christianity and Social Process, 2. See also his Growth of Idea of God, 116-139, on the emergence of the early Christian doctrine of God out of the tension between Greek speculation and Jewish pragmatic experience of God. 65 Mathews, Christianity and Social Process, 4.</page><page sequence="21">_Vol. 20, No. 3, September 1999_211 tradition while belying its most central values, to name but a few of the murkier spots of our recent history. But, as I hope to have demonstrated, not everything in Mathews is pass?. In Aubrey's view, Mathews's socio-historical method is preeminently retrievable: "The heart of Dean Mathews's theology is, therefore, its method. And it is in the elaboration of this method that his greatest contribution to theology undoubtedly lies."66 As we have noted, by rooting doctrine in experience, Mathews opens the door to interpretation that takes the social effect of doctrine seriously. In assessing a doctrine's social effect, the socio-historical hermeneutic is not merely commenting on how it impacts people, but is probing its meaning. If we follow Mathews's lead, we can no longer divorce doctrinal truth claims from the impact a doctrine has on real people in real places and times, since, as Bernard Meland observes, history and the social experience of people are "the designative area" for meaning in Mathews's worldview.67 As we have also seen, the socio-historical method incorporates a strong ethical criterion: doctrinal pertinence rests on ethical consequences. Built into the hermeneutical task as Mathews envisages it is ongoing critique of doctrine from new ethical vantage points that arise from new experiences which lift up fresh perspectives on the ethical significance of assumptions previously taken for granted. Finally, we've also noted that Mathews's interpretive approach has pronounced affinities with Carr's. Carr's theory of double intentionality or mixed texture highlights the social links in interpreting doctrine, and the need for ethical critique of any doctrinal formulation. As does Mathews's socio historical method, it locates the significance of doctrine in its social effect. In the final analysis, what does all this mean for the future of theology? At the very least, it means, I think, that we can no longer go on talking about doctrinal meaning as though this meaning is to be adjudicated in some sphere, often assumed to be a sacred one, hermetically sealed from people somewhere, somewhen. It means that discussions of doctrinal teachings 66 Aubrey, "Theology and Social Process," 31. 67 Meland, "Empirical Tradition," 19. See also ibid., 22: as Aubrey notes (22), even when Mathews is concerned to retrieve the normative element in the process of doctrinal development, history is primary and to the fore.</page><page sequence="22">212_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ must always be permeable to sociological findings, to first-person testimony about what happens when a doctrine is applied. What socio-historical analysis tell us about how a doctrine functions in the life of a particular community is not merely commentary on how it impacts the life of that community: it is also commentary on what it means, on its truth or falsity for that group of people. This is the direction in which Carr's theory of double intentionality points us, I think. As I write this, I am troubled by a tiny Peggy Lee voice that asks wistfully, "Is that all there is?" Is this bottom-line definition of doctrine all that remains, when we examine Mathews's legacy? And is not pragmatism now so much comfortable old furniture in religious discourse, as banal as a nauga hayde recliner in a dark-paneled den? I do not believe so. That is, I do not believe so, if one shifts from an academic to a more inclusive cultural focus. If we take our cue from Mathews and Carr and employ social analysis to see how such religious notions are touching religious groups in our culture, a different picture emerges. Here, one finds that though Mathews, Case, and Smith, and now Johnson, Carr et al have mounted impressive arguments about how doctrinal meaning is in trinsically bound up with the lives of those who receive doctrine, many groups continue to behave as if pragmatism never happened, at least not in the doctrinal realm. For many, and for powerful movements within practically all religious bodies in the United States, the hermeneutic relationship between doctrine and human life is unilateral and hierarchical: doctrine casts light on people's lives, without in any way deriving meaning from those lives. Where I was brought up, in that wilderness west of Memphis and east of Dallas that H.L. Mencken labeled the miasmatic jungles of Arkansas, it was considered impolite to criticize other people's families, at least to their faces, but perfectly acceptable to savage one's own, at least entre nous6* I would like to end with a few concluding remarks about my own religious family and how it has assimilated?or is the correct phrase "not assimilated"??the radical force of hermeneutics such as Mathews's and Carr's. Since those remarks could go almost anywhere, I have selected one case that illustrates in 68 H.L. Mencken, "The South Begins to Mutter," Smart Set Magazine (August 1921); as cited in Bob Lancaster, The Jungles of Arkansas (Fayetteville: University of Arkansas Press, 1989), 150.</page><page sequence="23">_Vol 20, No. 3, September 1999_213 an exceptionally clear way, I believe, both the implications of pragmatist approaches to doctrinal interpretation, and how those implications have yet to be faced systematically by one religious community. I have chosen to focus on the Roman Catholic magisterial position on homosexuality. Calling this a doctrine might be stretching, since, as many theologians have noted, no Catholic moral position has been magisterially defined as binding for the entire church. On the other hand, under the present papal regime, there has been a concerted effort of influential figures, including both John Paul II and his ideological spokesman, Cardinal Ratzinger, to up the infallibility ante by unofficially declaring certain magisterial ethical positions, including the ban on artificial contraception, as unalterable, ones from which theologians may not dissent without severe penalties. To me, this suggests that these are being made into quasi-doctrinal teachings. So treating the Catholic position on homosexuality as doctrinal may not be over-reaching at all. People lose jobs in Catholic institutions, after all, for publicly disagreeing with this teaching either in what they write or teach, or in how they live. What is the teaching? Put simply, it is that no homosexual act is morally licit, because all such acts thwart the procreative end of human sexuality as revealed by natural law. The 1986 Ratzinger document entitled "The Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons" adds another twist to this teaching, when it states flatly that homosexual persons are intrinsically disordered?presumably, because their nature orients them to erotic attraction to members of the same sex. I want to assess the truth claims of this teaching that is considered so close to the core of Catholic faith that people who challenge it jeopardize their livelihoods. Though a number of theological arrows might be aimed at it, I want to assess the teaching solely on the grounds of Carr's double inten tionality criterion. By asking about the effect of a doctrine on the lives of real people, that criterion also asks whether that effect supports or undermines the doctrine. If the latter, does it do so in such a way as to cast doubt on the truth claim of the teaching? My first inkling that this doctrine might be susceptible to such analysis predated my reading of Carr. It began in the classroom, in an undergraduate moral theology class in which I was teaching the Ratzinger document not long after it was published. In the class there was a student who had taken a number of my previous courses, a thoughtful and exceptionally</page><page sequence="24">214_American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy_ intelligent young woman from a close-knit and rather conservative Catholic family whose outlook she endorsed, on the whole. Having defined gay and lesbian persons as intrinsically disordered, having noted that every homosexual act, even in the context of a loving and committed relationship, is gravely sinful, and having mandated that Catholic institutions offering hospitality to gay-affirming groups such as Dignity revoke this, the Ratzinger document concludes by deploring violence against gay and lesbian persons. When our class reading of the pastoral document reached this conclusion, my student raised her hand, a look of genuine perplexity written across her face. The question she asked provoked for me one of those break through insights that decisively shape one's subsequent thought: "How can this document claim it opposes violence against gays and lesbians, when everything it said up to now is an act of violence? Intrinsically disordered? Sinful? Unwelcome if you accept who you are? Who do they think they're kidding? They're not against homophobic violence; they've been practicing it throughout this document." The naive questions are often the unsettling ones. This was a question about the double intentionality of doctrine, of course, about how a teaching's effects can render its stated intent null and void. Like Andersen's sartorially challenged emperor, another naive question in fable form, it was also sur reptitiously about how anyone with eyes to see can see what happens when an institution declares one thing while practicing another. Sociological studies support this student's conclusions: the Ratzinger teaching has not been re ceived, to employ Yves Congar's term, by a majority of Catholics in Western nations, and has been actively repudiated by most self-affirming gay or lesbian Catholics. Bone-knowledge tells us what this teaching really means: when you define us as ill-begotten children of God, you make us second-class citizens in a way that positively invites violence against us. The only sane way to deal with a doctrine like this, and what it does to real human lives, is to reject it as false. The example I have cited is one among many. One might ask similar "naive" pragmatist questions about the social effect of the teaching that priests must be male in order to symbolize a male Jesus. One might ask, too, about eucharistie theologies that so sacralize the Lord's Supper that they remove it from its real-life setting, a meal in which bread is shared in a hungry world where many are shoved away from the table. Nor can such naive questions be</page><page sequence="25">_Vol 20, No. 3, September 1999_215 confined to any one religious tradition, I believe. I contend, with no room left to support the contention, that cases like these abound in that murky interface of church and culture in which Americans live out their real-life religious commitments. When we ask questions such as the one my student asked, we may drag to the surface some unsettling, liberating insights about what is really happening in that interstitial place.</page></plain_text>
