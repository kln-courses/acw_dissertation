<plain_text><page sequence="1">Critical Response Ideology and Symbolic Action Fredric R. Jameson Kenneth Burke's reply usefully documents the undoubted Marxian strain in his own work and rightly signals a number of analyses which are classics in that ill-defined and somewhat heterogeneous tradition most often misnamed "the sociology of literature." They were certainly for- mative in my own development, and the brief "critique" of his work which I was asked to present at the English Institute, far from warning people away from these important essays, presupposed on the contrary that they will be the object of study and suggestive models for critical practice for some time to come. Let me again spell out the framework in which these observations were made and in particular justify the importance for me of an empha- sis on "ideology." This term has so many contradictory meanings that since, unlike Humpty-Dumpty, we cannot be its master and make it mean what we want it to mean, its use may well seem to raise more problems than it solves. I want to argue, however, that these are healthy problems which make the critical process a perilous adventure of the kind Burke's own criticism has always been, a process requiring a kind of uncomfortable and acute self-consciousness at all times, rather than a neutral exhibition of technical skills. I don't conceive of this as a debate with Burke, but if I did, I would be tempted to use the old debater's formula: there are many ways in which the word ideology can be used, most of them defensible, but there are two ways in which the word ought never to be used, and that is to designate "value systems" on the one hand or "false consciousness" on the other. The first meaning folds us back into the perspective of the 0098-1896/78/0502-0012$00.75 417</page><page sequence="2">418 Critical Response Fredric R. Jameson history of ideas, which it was the aim of the concept of ideology to spring us out of in the first place. The second betrays a vulgar Marxist approach to culture which it is the task of any genuinely contemporary Marxism to liquidate: indeed, from the Lukacs of History and Class Consciousness to the Frankfurt School, from Sartre to Althusser and Macherey, there are a number of very different Marxian conceptions of ideology available today which have nothing in common with the old notion of ideology as "false consciousness." And since I have gone this far, I will add some- thing I didn't mention in my essay, that when Burke documents his own use of the Marxian category of ideology, unfortunately he turns out most often to have meant our old friend "false consciousness," so un- avoidable a part of the baggage of thirties Marxism. The first thing that we need to understand about ideology is its peculiar and ambiguous structure as a cultural or "mental" entity. In the description of ideology proposed in Marxism and Form ([Princeton, N.J., 1971], pp. 375-90), I tried to convey this peculiarity by suggesting that ideology, as an object of study, has two distinct faces, two incommensur- able modes of appearance, which any adequate ideological criticism must register at one and the same time. Each of these modes of appearance, indeed, determines a particular critical stance (or, if you prefer, is "pro- duced" or made visible by a particular analytic perspective), neither of which is satisfactory taken all by itself. I suggested that these two dimensions of the ideological object might best be conveyed by the terms "system" and "function"; these terms in turn explain why it has seemed to people that ideology was "merely" Weltanschauung, on the one hand, or "merely" false conscious- ness, on the other, and offer a perspective in which the limited truth in each of these two misconceptions can be preserved. For it is certain that ideology can take the form of a system of values and beliefs; it can be philosophically elaborated to the point where it has the form and the appearance of a genuine conceptual system (or "world view"). This elab- oration is most often an artificial reconstruction and systematization after the fact by the historian of ideas; but I would not want to be understood as suggesting that such elaboration can never be a valuable tool. On the contrary, it is useful, and even indispensable, to grasp how, from some central ideological stance or value-such as "hierarchy" or Fredric R. Jameson is the editor, with Stanley Aronowitz and John Brenkman, of Social Text and the author of Marxism and Form, The Prison House of Language, and, forthcoming, The Political Unconscious: Studies in the Ideology of Form. "The Symbolic Inference; or, Kenneth Burke and Ideological Analysis" (Critical Inquiry 4 [Spring 1978]: 507-23) was pre- sented in an earlier version at the English Institute in September 1977 as one of a group of studies in reevaluation of the work of Kenneth Burke.</page><page sequence="3">Critical Inquiry Winter 1978 419 "nature"-a whole series of consequences, a whole set of minor ideologi- cal propositions or implications, logically follow. What cannot be accommodated by this particular perspective is the way in which such "theory"-ideology as a system-is the implicit theory of a concrete social practice. But at this point our approach to this pecu- liar and free-floating "object" must undergo a dialectical reversal in which we now read its "values" and attitudes as sheerfunction or in other words as the conceptual expression of what is in reality the dynamic praxis of a given social group or class. In shifting to this new "functional" perspective, however, we cannot abandon the first one in terms of "sys- tem" without falling into an equally reductive illusion, namely, that ideology is therefore "nothing but" false consciousness. To be sure, the unmasking of an apparent idea or philosophical concept as a strategic move in the concrete reality of the struggle of various groups or classes with one another is one of the fundamental rhetorical "tropes" in polemic discourse and most often seems utterly to discredit the "idea" in question, much as a statesman is discredited when we discover the large personal fortune he has amassed in office. To denounce a concept as "ideological"-that is, as serving some practical group function or perpetuating some class strategy-has always tended to sound like a purely negative judgment, a destructive attack and polemic repudiation which is intended to leave nothing of its object intact. I would like to convey a perspective in which this perfectly natural reaction--of which it seems important to me to give a few concrete illustrations-is a very odd one indeed. I leave aside the feeling of some of my audience at the English Institute (including, apparently, Burke himself) that my critique of him was an "attack." This might simply be taken as an index of the low level of theoretical debate in the American humanities today. A more revealing occasion, to my mind, was the ex- perience of a collective, with which I was associated, when it undertook to make a group presentation on the ideology of language in Wallace Stevens to a scholarly gathering. Our thesis was that a poetic "style"- being a specific practice of language-constituted a symbolic act in its own right which could be articulated in ideological terms. The instructive, and universal, reaction of our listeners was to ask us the question, Why do you feel that Wallace Stevens is not a great poet? On the contrary, we would not have chosen to study Wallace Stevens if we had not felt he was a great poet; what evidently misled our listeners was the word "ideologi- cal," which they took to mean "bad." But if all ideas and all symbolic forms express group praxis, then it is hard to see why saying so should be construed as a blanket repudiation. When, for example, we suggest that the New Criticism was the ideology of a certain contemporary poetic practice, we are restoring to this critical movement its vitality as the attempt to theorize and make explicit the</page><page sequence="4">420 Critical Response Fredric R. Jameson principles implicit in a concrete poetic activity, in a practice of language which was necessarily itself nontheoretical. At best, what would be "rep- rehensible" in those intellectual positions and value systems, whose prac- tical function as the ideological defense and expression of group dynamics such "unmasking" reveals, would be the pretence that such ideas exist in the eternal and have no practical functions in the first place. The difficulty with describing the "functional" or practical dimen- sion of ideology as "false consciousness" is that falsehood has nothing to do with the matter in question. Are "courtly morality" or the bourgeois concept of "nature" true or false? They are the life expression of embat- tled or triumphant social groups; and if you belong to a group which is locked in conflict with one of them, you will certainly wish to polarize the debate and polemically to articulate that counter-ideology which is the expression of the distinct life praxis of your own group or social class. But you would do best not to allow yourself to be drawn onto the terrain of some philosophic debate as to the "truth" or "falsehood" of these ideologies, a terrain which is itself (the reader will already have under- stood me) profoundly "ideological." This is, however, a position-culture as class struggle-which people find difficult to maintain; and among such people one must not only number liberals, who have been trained to believe that liberalism is a commonsense "end-of-ideology" position between those other ex- tremes (which they are only too willing to consider "ideologies"), but also many vulgar Marxists who seem to feel more comfortable when they are able to consider the group consciousness of the other side as mere "false consciousness." The view I have outlined arouses two distinct but related anxieties: one springs from its threat to the division of labor on which the professional activity of intellectuals is based and which might well demand painful rethinking if it were to turn out that the philosophies and works of art with which we are professionally concerned are fully as political as everything in the "real life" of business society. The other anxiety is one which the act of radical historicization must inevitably generate in a consumer society which, like our own, seeks so desperately to persuade itself that history is over and that the American supermarket and the American suburb are here to stay. People who feel these anx- ieties should take into consideration the possibility that cultural activity is more exciting if it is felt to be at the very center of "the nightmare of history," in the perpetual group struggle of an unimaginably old human history whose end is nowhere in sight, than if it is comfortably "re- contained" as a sandbox affair which threatens no one. It is clear that such an approach to culture has as its indispensable precondition the reading (or rewriting, if you prefer) of cultural artifacts and works of art as symbolic acts. Thus, whatever influence or status Kenneth Burke's wide-ranging and inventive explorations of symbolic action may have in other contemporary critical traditions, they are fun-</page><page sequence="5">Critical Inquiry Winter 1978 421 damental texts in any properly Marxist analysis of culture. Meanwhile, it is worth observing that-as his "Critical Response" demonstrates- ideological analysis has often, but not always, played a strategic role in Burke's rewriting of cultural objects as symbolic acts. The demonstration of an ideological function in a given work of art serves the purpose, in these analyses, of moving the work away from its iconic and repre- sentational appearance and preparing us for that quite different percep- tion of it which construes it as a symbolic act. However, the recourse to ideology is here essentially a mediation, nor is it the only mediatory strategy Burke uses in his reconstruction of cultural texts as symbolic forms of action. This might then be the most appropriate way of sharpening the differences between us: for Burke, the concept of ideol- ogy is essentially an instrumental one whose usefulness lies in its effec- tiveness in dramatizing the key concept of symbolic action. My own priorities are the reverse of these, since I have found the concept of symbolic action a most effective way of demonstrating the ideological function of culture. I would be content to end our "dispute" on this note but feel that Burke's closing comments on technology significantly enlarge the discus- sion and resituate it on a plane which largely transcends the questions of cultural and critical methodology in which it had hitherto moved. Burke here raises a more general philosophical issue-the relationship between sign systems and modes of production-which proves well-nigh inevi- table in current dialogues between Marxism and semiotics as well. Are tools first and foremost signs? Or are signs in some way to be understood as tools? Which is logically (and thus interpretively) prior: language or production? This is obviously not the place to address such a question, which can in any case surely not be answered in the crude form in which I have conveyed it. But Burke's concluding remarks can give us a sense of the direction in which certain answers take you. Language and technology are here assimilated to that realm of "counter-nature" which Burke wishes to affirm, opposing it to the blind insensate realm of the wholly natural. Note that when a concept like technology becomes the centered one, in terms of which other categories are evaluated and hierarchically subordinated, the value attributed to the central term is relatively indifferent. The category of technology remains central whether, with technocracy, we celebrate this immense lifting up of the human race by its bootstraps out of the necessities of nature or whether, on the contrary, we feel that the control of technol- ogy is the central issue of our time and anxiously interrogate the moral capacity of human beings to control such alarming technological powers. The positive emphasis is of course an ideological strategy, designed to legitimate a new technocratic elite; while the negative one is the dis- placement of more concrete historical and political anxieties. Still, Xerox commercials versus the Bomb: both remain locked into the closure of a</page><page sequence="6">422 Critical Response Fredric R. Jameson binary opposition ("nature" vs. human transcendence) which has omit- ted an essential third term. Between the realm of nature and that of "counter-finality" or human freedom must indeed be inserted something distinct from either of these, which is the realm of history, or in other words the alienated forces of human institutions which return on people as external forces with a dynamism of their own. This is the realm of what Marx called "prehistory," the space in which class dynamics, operating with a lawful- ness which is like that of natural law, as an absent cause, only detectable in everyday life and in chronological historical events by way of their effects, constitute a kind of second nature which something more than mere individual human creativity must reverse. That these laws are not "natural" ones may be grasped by the increasing possibility of mastering them which is given to us since the development of capitalism allowed them first to be observed and formulated. But even this possibility of mastery is a collective project, and not the "anthropomorphic" possibility of the individual subject (as, e.g., in creativity like that of Edison or Einstein). Technology is then not in that sense the issue; and to ask oneself whether the human race will in some qualitative leap or mutation reach the level of counter-natural consciousness allowing it to control such forces is conveniently to overlook the central issue. The forces in ques- tion are not free-floating ones, with which the human race is im- mediately confronted, but rather have been developed by a business society which continues to have the final say about their elaboration. The proper question is therefore whether the elimination of the waste and destructiveness of "technology" is consistent with the profit dynamics of a free enterprise system. Here, too, then, we return to one of the central motifs of the ex- change between Burke and myself; and here, too, I am content to re- main with my initial diagnosis. Burke's too immediate celebration of the free creativity of human language (in its broadest symbol-making sense) overleaps the whole dimension of our (nonnatural) determination by transindividual historical forces. This realm of alienation, which is to history what the unconscious is to individual experience, is, however, a space which will not ignore us, however we may prefer to ignore it.</page></plain_text>
