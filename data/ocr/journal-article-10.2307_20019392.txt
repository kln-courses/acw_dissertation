SCHOEN ANTHROPOMORPHIC CONCEPTS OF GOD* Three of the most venerable objections to anthropomorphic conceptions of the divine are traceable to Xenophanes and his critique of the early Greek gods. Though suitably revised, these ancient criticisms have persisted over the centuries, plaguing various religious communities, particularly those of classical Christian commitment. Xenophanes complained that anthropo? morphism leads to unseemly characterizations, noting that both ... Homer and Hesiod have attributed to the gods all things that are shameful and a reproach among mankind: theft, adultery, and mutual deception.1 Over the ages, the list of unseemly characteristics has expanded somewhat. Aquinas, for example, agreed that various immoral traits should not be attributed to God, but added such features as corporeality, composition, limitation and changeability as well. He did not seem to think that the elimination of these or other inappropriate characterizations would pose insurmountable problems, however, and he provided several ways for avoid? ing improper ones in some of the early questions of his Summa Theologiae.2 Other thinkers have not been so sanguine. In his attack upon the anthropo? morphism of Cleanthes, David Hume's Philo protested that no principled line could be drawn anywhere. And why not become a perfect anthropomorphite ? Why not assert the deity or deities to be corporeal, and to have eyes, a nose, mouth, ears, etc? Epicurus main? tained that no man had ever seen reason but in a human figure ; therefore, the gods must have a human figure. And this argument, which is deservedly so much ridiculed by Cicero, becomes, according to you, solid and philosophical.3 The second problem recorded by Xenophanes stems from the fact that the divine is so radically different from human beings. There is one god, among gods and men the greatest, not at all like mortals in body or in mind. * I am grateful to Larry Mayhew for his helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper. 1 Kathleen Freeman, Ancilla to the Pre-Socratic Philosophers (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1971), p. 22. 2 See Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae, vol. 1, part 1, ed. by Thomas Gilby, O.P., (Garden City: Image Books, 1969), particularly Questions 3-11. 3 David Hume, Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion and the Posthumous Essays, ed. by Richard H.

But without toil he sets everything in motion, by the thought of his mind. And he always remains in the same place, not moving at all, nor is it fitting for him to change his position at different times.4 Aquinas found this problem much more difficult than the first. Indeed, it became one of his primary concerns, driving his search for a middle way between univocity and equivocity. Although he affirmed that certain attri? butions, such as goodness, life or love, are positive and contentful when ascribed to God, he conceded that such perfections are understood originally through their occurrence in creatures. God, being absolutely simple, the supreme cause of all and essentially existent, is so utterly different from creatures that nothing whatever can be attributed univocally to both. Speak? ing of divine simplicity, he wrote, ... when we say that a man is wise, we signify his wisdom as something distinct from the other things about him - his essence, for example, his powers or his existence. But when we use this word about God we do not intend to signify something distinct from his essence, power or existence_Hence it is clear that the word 'wise' is not used in the same sense of God and man...'5 To avoid equivocation in his descriptions of God, Aquinas distinguished what is signified from the way it is signified. What is signified, such as wisdom, life or love, may be said literally to characterize God, though the way in which such features are realized in the divine nature is so different from creaturely realizations that '... so far as the way of signifying these perfections is concerned the words are used inappropriately, for they have a way of signifying that is appropriate to creatures'.6 Xenophanes developed his third objection to anthropomorphic concep? tions of the divine by casting suspicion upon their origins. He found the cultural variability among anthropomorphic descriptions indicative of a deep egocentrism. 'Aethiopians have gods with snub noses and black hair, Thracians have gods with grey eyes and red hair.'7 Rather cynically, he speculated, ...if oxen (and horses) and lions had hands or could draw with hands and create works of art like those made by men, horses would draw pictures of gods like horses, and oxen of gods like oxen, and they would make the bodies (of their gods) in accordance with the form that each species itself possesses.8 Aquinas did not share this cynicism with Xenophanes, since he drew many of his anthropomorphisms from sacred texts and theological predecessors, sources he deeply respected. Recent psychological studies, however, may serve to reinforce the suspicions of Xenophanes. Jean Piaget argued that 4 Ancilla to the Pre-Socratic Philosophers, p. 23. 5 Summa Theologiae, vol. 1, part 1, p. 207. See Question 13, Articles 1-7 for the details of his argument on this point. 6 Summa Theologiae, p. 203. 7 Ancilla to the Pre-Socratic Philosophers, p. 22. 8 Ancilla to the Pre-Socratic Philosophers, p. 22.</page><page sequence="3">ANTHROPOMORPHIC CONCEPTS OF GOD !25 ... on broad lines one can distinguish the following evolution. The child begins by attributing the distinctive qualities of the divinity - especially omniscience and almightiness - to his parents and thence to men in general. Then, as he discovers the limits of human capacity, he transfers to God, of whom he learns in his religious instruction, the qualities which he learns to deny to men.9 Though perhaps a little unsettling, this description of origins seems relatively benign. Additional probing, however, reveals a more troubling story. According to Piaget, once children have attributed such characteristics as omnipotence to their parents, they resist the pressure to switch their attribu? tions to God. Furthermore, If... the child is left to his spontaneous conceptions he finds nothing very sacred about God. He is just a man like anyone else, who lives in the clouds or in the sky, but who, with this exception, is no different from the rest. 'A person who works for his master.' 'A man who earns wages,' these are of the type of definition that working-class children of about 7-8 give of God_A great number of children have also told us that there were many Gods...10 To this, Piaget added the observation that these childish tendencies are complemented by strong drives toward animism. 1 Though perhaps the most foreboding, the third objection is the least power? ful. Tracing anthropomorphism back to questionable roots can be rather disconcerting, of course, but the epistemic significance of this uneasiness is minimal. First of all, it must be noted that no consensus has emerged among psychologists who have studied the problem of origins. Gordon Allport's theory differs dramatically from that of Piaget which, in turn, differs from the position of Freud. While Freud was broodingly suspicious, Allport took anthropomorphism to be a bright, constructive development.11 Piaget seemed to fall somewhere in between. Furthermore, psychologists have been hesitant to commit the genetic fallacy. Allport wrote, The plain truth is that origins can tell nothing about the validity of a belief. Neither can origins characterize the mature belief as it now exists, nor explain its part in the present economy of a life.12 Even so dark a theorist as Freud was cautious. While he thought that religious beliefs, psychologically speaking, are illusions, they 9 Jean Piaget, The Child? s Conception of the World (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1929), p. 268. 10 The Child's Conception of the World, p. 381.

SCHOEN ... need not necessarily be false_For instance, a middle-class girl may have the illusion that a prince will come and marry her. This is possible ; and a few such cases have occurred.13 Finally, theological resources are available for turning even the most detrimental of psychological theories to positive effect. This is particularly so for traditions that employ doctrines regarding the corruptibility of human nature, such as classical Christianity. Christians might combine their doc? trine of a sense of the divine with that of original sin, arguing that the immature, twisted or perverse way in which children manifest their sense of the divine indicates only how pervasive and penetrating are the effects of that sin. Obviously, whether such a tactic emerges as a natural element in a properly executed theology rather than a hopelessly defensive manoeuvre depends upon whether anthropomorphic conceptions of the divine can find justification elsewhere than in matters of origin. ii To understand how anthropomorphism may be justified, it is helpful to switch away from religious settings to a consideration of commonplace attributions of human capacities to computers. Consider rounding off deci? mal places to whole numbers. When asked how they round off numbers, many people describe their procedures in terms of mathematical comparisons with 0-5. If the decimal is greater than 0*5, they round up. If it is less, they round down. When it comes to 0*5 itself, procedures tend to differ. Some people round up, others round down and still others round to the even, or perhaps the odd, whole number. In a basic language that has operations for mathematical comparisons, it is possible to mimic this human procedure. Nevertheless, instructors do not often encourage their programming students to do so. Instead, they teach a more efficient technique that virtually no one uses in ordinary life. Teachers frequently tell their students to add 0*5 to a number and then truncate the result. For example, 0*5 added to 6*3 gives 6*8. When truncated by dropping off the decimal places, the result is 6. If 0*5 is added to 6*8, the result is 7*3 which, if truncated, becomes 7. Since most primitive basic languages include instructions for both of these operations, rounding off can be accomplished in two quick steps. Of course, any 0-5, as in 6*5, will be rounded up con? sistently. In order to round 0*5 down or to round consistently to even or odd numbers additional complications, frequently machine specific, are required. For the purposes of this discussion, the details of such technicalities can be ignored. It might be tempting to think that any computer programmed to use this 13 The Future of an Illusion, p. 49.</page><page sequence="5">ANTHROPOMORPHIC CONCEPTS OF GOD 127 quick technique for rounding off is not really doing so. Instead, it is simply adding and then truncating, using a procedure that just happens to give the same results as rounding off. This temptation must be resisted, however, for the simple reason that not all people use the same procedure for rounding off. Some may stick to mathematical comparisons with 0*5. Others may find the addition and truncation method sufficiently intriguing to adopt for everyday use. Many people say that they look to see whether the decimal is closer to the higher or lower whole number, rounding up or down accord? ingly. By this method, they round 273 up because the 073 is closer to 3 than it is to 2. It is unnatural to interpret this last group as using mathematical comparisons with 0*5. Rather, something like measuring imagined distances on lines between whole numbers is taking place. With this technique, 0*5 typically causes problems, not because it is difficult to make mathematical comparisons of 0*5 with 0-5, but because 0*5 seems to fall right in the middle of the line. To handle this special case, some additional, arbitrary procedure is needed. Surely the conclusion to be drawn is not that only those using some very specific procedure can be described as rounding off. Which, if any, of the above would count as real rounding off and which would be the imitations ? Nor does it seem particularly helpful to try to distinguish literal from figura? tive or metaphorical rounding off. By which procedures would computers or people be rounding off literally, rather than doing so only figuratively or metaphorically? Instead, the appropriate conclusion seems to be that round? ing off, genuine rounding off, can be accomplished in any number of different ways. All three of the above methods may be used by people. Computers can be programmed very efficiently in basic to use the addition and truncation method. With a little more trouble, the mathematical comparison with 0-5 method might be implemented in basic Perhaps other techniques, such as the one that employs differences in lengths of imaginary lines, could not be used by computers programmed in basic at all. Nevertheless, any person or computer using one of these or some other suitable method may be described correctly as rounding off. At this point, it might be objected that this comparison between computers and people is tainted by a radical misinterpretation of the facts. In reality, computers do not round off in any manner whatsoever. Consider the addition and truncation method. Literally speaking, computers do not add or truncate. What is called adding and truncating in basic is really a very complex sequence of loading, manipulating and storing the contents of assorted registers and memory locations. Even this description is not quite correct. Because registers and memory locations are really just complicated electronic circuits, what actually happens in the computer is something that can be summarized briefly only as an incredible whirl of electrons. This particular whirl is initiated by electrical impulses generated by striking a</page><page sequence="6">128 EDWARD L. SCHOEN keyboard and results in patterns of ink on paper or glowing arrays of dots on a video screen. In all of this, no genuine rounding off takes place. The problem with this objection is that it completely ignores the human case. Forgetting computers for the moment, human beings round off in any number of ways, all of which are genuine cases of rounding off. For this reason alone it cannot be correct to say that people, or computers for that matter, can only round off if they are using some specific procedure. Further? more, if this objection were valid, it could be used to argue that human beings never genuinely round off either. On the rather plausible assumption that people use their brains to round off, it might be argued that human beings never round off because all that really occurs is an extraordinarily complicated whirl of electrical activity in the brain that eventuates in assorted mouth, vocal chord or hand movements. For those whose sympathies lie with dualism, the obvious countermove would be to argue that something quite special takes place in human beings when they round off. This something is what might be called the conscious? ness of rounding off or the characteristic feel one has when rounding off. This is what must occur if anyone is to be described properly as rounding off. Computers, lacking such peculiar forms of consciousness, only simulate rounding off. Unfortunately, this reply requires the implausible assumption that all people experience the same form of consciousness when they round off. As was just noted, however, people round off in any number of different ways, each of which has its own characteristic feel. The consciousness of making mathematical comparisons with 0*5 differs from the feel of measuring imagi? nary lines between numbers or adding 0*5 and then truncating the result. If any of these procedures can be used to round off, genuine rounding off does not require specific forms of consciousness. Indeed, some people round off without any associated conscious feel at all. Mathematicians or account? ants become so adept at rounding off that they do so virtually instantane? ously. For them, the task is completed so quickly that it does not feel like anything. If such experts can round off without conscious feels, it is difficult to see why computers should be denied that same capacity simply because they lack appropriate feels. If proper ascriptions of rounding off do not require any specific process or particular form of consciousness, attention might be turned to hardware. Perhaps only those people or computers that employ specific hardware configurations can be described properly as rounding off. This proposal also stumbles over the facts, however. Regarding computers, any number of quite different electronic configurations can be programmed to round off in a diversity of ways. While the human case is more obscure, neurophysiological studies seem to indicate that no two human brains are structured identically. Since connections within the same brain also seem to change over time, it</page><page sequence="7">anthropomorphic concepts of god 129 appears unrealistic to suppose that some identical configuration might be discovered by which all human beings round off. Furthermore, since people round off using various different procedures, it would be necessary to suppose that people using the addition and truncation method were employing the same neuronal structure as those who make mathematical comparisons with ?'5' If proper ascriptions of rounding off do not require the identification of any particular procedures, conscious feels or hardware configurations, it might seem natural to focus upon behaviour. Perhaps people or computers should be described as rounding off only if they behave in certain ways. With respect to the human case, the problems associated with this approach are well known. People can round off in their heads, suppressing all forms of overt behaviour or they may round off while supplying misleading behav? iour. People might even do some quite different mathematical computation that gives the same results as rounding off over the short or longer run. It also should be noted that behaviourism works no better for computers. Most computers overtly behave by offering appropriate video displays or paper printouts. If monitors or printers are disconnected, however, com? puters may round off without providing any appropriate overt behaviour. In fact, this is one way of telling that monitors or printers are not connected. Computers also may round off while providing misleading behaviour. If improperly connected, a monitor may display gibberish or some perverse pattern of letters and numbers as it rounds off. Trained technicians, knowing a computer is rounding off, may even use these strange patterns diagnost ically. For example, if a computer connected to an old-fashioned 4-bit display should be showing a ' 9 ' as a result of rounding off but displays an 'A' instead, the technician may track down the source of the problem to crossed wires by using the fact that the 4-bit binary code for '9' is ' 1001 ' while the code for 4A' is s 1010'. Even properly functioning computers with correctly connected displays or printers may provide misleading behaviour. They may round off without displaying the result or do some additional operation to the result before sending it to the display. If recourse to overt behaviour has such shortcomings, perhaps providing a specialized definition of rounding off or disclosing its very essence would help. After all, whatever meets the definition of rounding off or displays its essence would have to be rounding off. Surely, then, nothing could be more useful in the attempt to provide grounds for ascribing rounding off to people or computers than the discovery of a precise definition or essence. Unfortunately, this approach also seems misdirected, since knowledge of the essence or definition of something does not necessarily imply any r?cogni? tive capacities. Knowing that pentagons are five-sided figures, for example, even if this be definitionally true or the very essence of pentagons, is not of much help to those who are unable to count. For the very young, knowing 5 RES 26</page><page sequence="8">130 EDWARD L. SCHOEN that pentagons are shaped like home plates might be much more useful information. Similarly, the essence or a precise mathematical definition of rounding off might turn out to be too abstract, complex or subtle to be of much use in determining whether people or computers are rounding off. Even if a simple, useable definition or essence were forthcoming, this would not provide any solution to the more general problem. Instead, rounding off would have to be considered a relatively rare, exceptional case. Most other important characteristics ascribed to human beings, such as love, hate or justice, have no easily discoverable definition or essence, if they have any definition or essence at all. So, while people or computers might be character? ized as rounding off by appeal to some essence or definition, the basis for determining whether anyone or anything should be described as loving, hating or just would remain as deep a mystery as ever. in It might appear as if this extended example is drifting toward scepticism. One by one, criteria for determining whether computers or people are rounding off have been eliminated. In the end, none will be left. Such a conclusion flies in the face of obvious facts, however. Determinations regard? ing whether or not people or computers are rounding off are made con? stantly, accurately and with relative ease in everyday situations. More pointedly, such a sceptical conclusion would radically misrepresent the force of the example developed here. Bases for determining whether rounding off is taking place have not been eliminated at all. Quite to the contrary, many such bases have been described. Various hardware configurations, software procedures, conscious feels, patterns of overt behaviour or even mathematical definitions may provide useful clues under proper circumstances. While certain of these clues may be more informative than others, the appropriate conclusion to draw from this example is only that no specifiable set of clues can be considered definitive. Which clues are most indicative or most reliable can change over time or from case to case. For observers without much knowledge of the inner workings of people or computers, behavioural clues such as answers to questions or video displays may be the only useable ones. For those versed in basic, scrutiny of the programs computers are following may provide reliable indications of what is happening. People who are familiar with the ways in which humans round off may find descriptions of the procedures being used by others indicative of whether rounding off is occurring. Elec? tronics technicians may be able to decide whether computers are rounding off by tediously tracing the activities of assorted components. Similarly, if the promise of neurophysiology is ever realized, researchers eventually may be able to tell whether people are rounding off by following neuronal activity.</page><page sequence="9">ANTHROPOMORPHIC CONCEPTS OF GOD 131 With a widening understanding of ways in which rounding off can be implemented, the range of useful clues may be extended in quite surprising and unanticipated directions. For example, if it were discovered that com? puters round off by using components that smell strangely when operating, rounding off might become detectable by sniffing. Under these conditions, the objection that the idea of smelling rounding off involves a category mistake would rest upon an insufficiently detailed understanding of the computerized process. This strategy for identifying rounding off is employed quite generally in the ascription of other characteristics to human beings. As an example relevant to religious contexts, consider love. Ordinarily, people do not rely upon any definition or essence of love. Instead, they use an extraordinary array of clues. In many situations, behavioural indicators are helpful, though different loving people behave in various ways. Descriptions of conscious feels also may be useful, though feelings vary and it is notoriously difficult to get much of a sense of precisely how others feel. At the present time, neuro? physiology does not offer much in the way of clues, though it might be more helpful in the future. An additional source of clues, neglected in the discussion of rounding off, should be included here as well. Often, loving people leave environmental clues. Secret admirers may deposit flowers on doorsteps or candy in mailboxes as indications of a love they would never dare reveal in person. Any or all such clues may be taken in a variety of combinations as a basis for correctly ascribing love. None of these indicators is foolproof or essential, of course, but all may be helpful and, given the right circumstances, any may be convincing. Such a loose and untidy connection between indicators and proper descrip? tions of human beings should not come as a surprise. For countless gener? ations, people have been described accurately as loving, hateful, or jealous. Since loving, hateful or jealous people may do or feel all sorts of things, essential connections between certain feelings or behaviour and correct descriptions cannot be drawn. Of course, some feelings or behaviours are more characteristic than others and so may serve as particularly reliable indicators. But no more intimate connection between various specific feelings or behaviours and the ascription of human characteristics exists. When it comes to human physiology, the correlation seems even weaker. This too should not be surprising, since today, as in the past, few people understand much about the internal workings of human bodies. Such general ignorance has meant that the characterization of human beings must proceed, for the most part, independently of any knowledge of the structure or activities of internal configurations. Nor is there any necessary connection between types of clues and proper ascriptions, since indicators may be of diverse sorts. Given the possibility of environmental clues, even embodiment seems inessential. The appearance of 5-2</page><page sequence="10">I32 EDWARD L. SCHOEN flowers or candy may be taken to indicate that someone is loving even though such indicators imply nothing about the physiological makeup of the lover, or even that the lover has a physiology. No matter how the flowers or candy are delivered, be it by truck, l?vitation or creation ex nihilo, love may be indicated. This is one of the reasons why controversies continue to rage in the philosophy of mind despite the popularity of the claim that the idea of personhood is somehow essentially connected with the idea of embodiment. While dualists might agree that certain environmental, behavioural or bodily clues are indicative of the presence of consciousness, they need not concede that such clues imply that the consciousness indicated is physiologically realized, or even capable of physiological realization. The detachability of attributions of love, jealousy or other human charac? teristics from any specifics regarding physiological configurations or workings is paralleled by a similar detachability in descriptions of software packages. New products are frequently described anthropomorphically in terms of capacities to make decisions, sort data lists, rearrange files or make statistical computations. Such descriptions may be perfectly intelligible, extremely precise and painstakingly detailed. Yet nothing whatever is revealed or even implied regarding the specifics of hardware or software implementations. In fact, in the early stages of product design, assorted capabilities may be rigorously specified for which designers suspect there can be no software or hardware implementation at all. Many industry sceptics currently suspect that a fair amount of vapourware falls into this category. IV The implications of this example for the second problem posed by Xeno? phanes and shared by Aquinas should be clear. If the analysis provided here is correct, both Aquinas and Xenophanes have missed a crucial feature involved in the proper attribution of such characteristics as love, jealousy or rounding off. The peculiar virtue of anthropomorphic characterizations is their lack of essential connections with specifics regarding configurations or inner workings. Attributions of human traits are based upon a variety of clues. Obviously, certain of these can bear important relations to con? figurations or inner workings. For example, neurophysiological clu?s may be tied directly to the structure of the human central nervous system, though even this connection remains somewhat loose, since rounding off, love or other traits may be realized physiologically in any number of ways. Other clues, such as conscious feels, may indicate love, jealously or rounding off without revealing anything regarding the particularities of inner workings or physical configurations. Environmental clues rest at the far extreme, indi? cating love, jealousy or rounding off without revealing whether the source of those clues is even physical, much less how it operates.</page><page sequence="11">ANTHROPOMORPHIC CONCEPTS OF GOD I33 Within normal religious contexts, characterizations of God are not based upon clues collected by studying the inner workings or structural con? figuration of the divine. Nor do religious believers commonly claim direct access to overt supernatural behaviour or any clear understanding of how God consciously feels. Since such clues generally fall beyond the range of human experience, believers rely heavily upon environmental indicators. The detachability of such clues from any details regarding configurations or inner workings implies that the uniqueness of God's nature, in and of itself, does not prohibit anthropomorphic characterizations. Though computers differ radically in configuration and inner workings from human beings, they may be described quite accurately as rounding off. The detachability of clues, particularly the extreme detachability of en? vironmental ones, also permits a response to the first complaint of Xeno? phanes, that anthropomorphism leads to unseemly characterizations of God. As Hume put it, '...why not become a perfect anthropomorphite? Why not assert the deity or deities to be corporeal, and to have eyes, a nose, mouth, ears...? '14 The answer now appears straightforward. One need only go so far as the indicators demand, which typically is not very far. With computers that round off, behavioural or other indicators do not imply noses, mouths or even conscious feels. Since there are good reasons for denying such additional characteristics, computers may be said to round off without them. Sometimes, of course, indicators carry further implications. Perhaps behavioural clues that computers are rounding off imply certain general capacities to represent or manipulate numbers. If so, then the use of those indicators would require the attribution of such additional features. As the example of rounding off demonstrates, however, such implications normally are surprisingly meagre, particularly when environmental clues are involved. With regard to the religious setting, there may be any number of reasons for refusing to go beyond the minimal implications of various clues. For example, within the Christian tradition, immoral traits have not been attrib? uted to the divine because they might diminish God's dignity, jeopardize his worthiness of worship or compromise his status as the greatest possible being. Sometimes, changeability and corporeality have been rejected for reasons drawn from the study of Plato or Aristotle. Certain traits also may be repudiated because they conflict with sacred or traditional teachings. The point here is not to evaluate such claims, but merely to remark that anthropo? morphic traits typically are indicated by clues of such detachability that the flexibility to entertain these or other considerations in the character? ization of the divine tends to be maximized. 14 Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion and the Posthumous Essays, p. 37.</page><page sequence="12">!34 EDWARD L. SCHOEN V Thus far, the consideration of rounding off has been used to argue that radical differences in human and divine configurations or inner workings do not necessarily prohibit anthropomorphic characterizations of the divine. But should such characterizations be taken literally? Are any of them univo cally attributable to God and human beings? By extending the investigation of rounding off, it is possible to see how these questions should be answered. Because of the obvious impact the philosophy of language has on such matters, this discussion can proceed only under the explicit assumption of certain standard doctrines. Accordingly, the contrast between the literal and non-literal use of terms will be assumed to be determined by the actual practices of linguistic communities. Words or phrases are used literally if they are used in accustomed, standardized ways.15 Since standard practices may change over time, literal uses can change, old ones being lost through neglect while new ones are introduced through the fossilization of novelties. For example, a new usage may be formed by metaphorical extension. If that usage catches on, it may stabilize in accepted, common practice, thereby establishing a new literal use through the death of the original metaphorical one. New literal uses also may be introduced quickly by explicit agreement or definitional fiat and, of course, words or phrases may have more than one standard or accustomed use. In order to minimize controversy, this understanding of the literal use of terms will be disassociated from any general theory of meaning. In particu? lar, it is not assumed that linguistic meaning is to be identified with use. Nor is it assumed that speakers who use terms literally can produce anything that might be called a literal meaning, since speakers may use terms in standard ways without being able to specify their meanings. For that matter, it is not even necessary to determine whether such things as literal meanings exist. Univocity will be assumed to be a relation among occasions of linguistic use. Any word or phrase used in the same way on two or more occasions is used univocally. This relationship does not correlate directly with literal use. The mere fact that a word or phrase is used literally on two occasions is insufficient to guarantee univocity, since terms may have more than one standard use. Nor does non-literal usage imply non-univocity. Words or phrases may be used univocally if they are used in the same non-literal way on two or more occasions. On this view, determining whether a particular word or phrase is being used literally requires the capacity to distinguish standard from non standard uses, while the identification of univocity demands the ability to distinguish the same from different uses. For two reasons, the central role 15 See Janet Martin Soskice, Metaphor and Religious Language (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1985), particularly ch. v, for a detailed discussion of this general sort of position.</page><page sequence="13">ANTHROPOMORPHIC CONCEPTS OF GOD 135 played by these capacities should not be interpreted as a weakness. First, such capacities tend to be relatively imprecise, which is reflected in the fact that linguistic communities never make fine distinctions between what is univocal and what is not or subtle separations of literal from non-literal uses. In actual practice, confident agreement is reached only in very clear cases. Second, these capacities are skills that may be developed independently of any explicit theory of language or knowledge of meanings, definitions or essences. This too is reflected in actual linguistic practice. Most competent speakers readily judge whether words or phrases are being used literally or univocally without being able to provide any sophisticated theory of lan? guage use or any particularly insightful definition or explication of the meanings of the specific words or phrases involved. These assumptions regarding literal use and univocity mesh cleanly with the preceding discussion of rounding off. To this point, it has been argued that any number of diverse clues may provide a basis for determining whether computers or people round off. While the presence or absence of any specific range of clues normally is not foolproof, various clues may be more or less convincing under assorted circumstances. Recognizing the general lack of definitive clues, people tend to be hesitant about judgements based upon small samplings. Confidence builds only as more significant clues or more convincing patterns of clues are discovered. Questions regarding literal use or univocity naturally arise in connection with this gradual build? up of clues. If only one or two whole numbers show up on a video screen, observers may be reluctant to say whether a computer is rounding off. Coupled with this lack of confidence is a strong, natural tendency to use language in standard, accustomed ways. Since the standard, accustomed use of language is its literal use, the tendency is to speak literally. Furthermore, since the standard, accustomed use of anthropomorphic terms is for the character? ization of human beings, the tendency to use language in accustomed ways results in an impulse toward univocity. The fundamental drive, then, is toward simplicity rather than toward sophisticated metaphorical uses or figurative extensions of language. Initially, the issue to be addressed is whether, literally speaking, the computer can be said to round off in the same way that humans can be said to round off. Depending upon the pattern of subsequent clues, this initially crude tendency to speak literally and univocally may or may not be challenged. If the pattern of clues presented by the computer conforms to the pattern of clues offered by people who round off, there will be no pressure to retreat from the initial affirmative judgement. If the computer displays patterns of clues that diverge from those displayed by people, pressure may be felt to move in any number of directions, depending upon the exact nature of the discrepancies involved. If the computer displays clues that, in the human</page><page sequence="14">136 EDWARD L. SCHOEN case, are indicative that no rounding off is taking place, the tendency will be to retain the original literal, univocal way of speaking, but to replace the affirmation with its denial. If the computer displays patterns of clues that, in the human case, would indicate that people are only approximately round? ing off, sometimes rounding off or are making mistakes when rounding off, then observers will speak literally and univocally by offering similar judge? ments about the computer. Finally, were the computer to display clues that, in the human case, are indicative that something similar to or sort of like rounding off is taking place, the tendency might be to retain literal and univocal speech by concluding that, literally speaking, the computer is sort of rounding off or doing something similar to rounding off. On the other hand, observers might move away from literal, univocal ways of speaking at this point by substituting other claims, such as that, figuratively or meta? phorically speaking, the computer is rounding off. It is important to recognize that tendencies either to retain or replace original literal, univocal ways of speaking depend upon careful comparisons of patterns of computer clues with patterns used in making assorted judge? ments about human beings. It also should be noted that the patterns of clues pressuring any move away from initially literal, univocal uses of terms need not come from the same range of clues used to ground an original judgement. For example, if numbers displayed on a video screen were used to determine that, literally and univocally speaking, the computer is rounding off, dis? crepancies among other clues might still force a move away from that judgement. If it were shown, contrary to the position taken above, that human rounding off necessarily involves certain conscious feels or neuro? logical activities, the inability of the computer to manifest such clues might be used as a basis for withdrawing the original judgement in favour of some non-univocal or non-literal way of speaking. Finally, it must be emphasized that the simple recognition of discrepancies among patterns of clues is insufficient, in itself, to force a retreat from speaking literally or univocally. Given the rather nebulous and open-ended nature of evidential clues, a certain measure of outright tolerance for dis? crepancies is to be expected. Furthermore, specific discrepancies may be attributable to deception, error, malfunction, outside interference, differ? ences in hardware configuration or any number of other such sources. Turning to the religious setting, consider some claim that God is loving based upon a small sampling of environmental clues. The initial tendency is to say literally that God is loving in just the way that people can be said to be loving. Obviously, this original judgement may be challenged by subse? quent clues. As with human love, there will be some outright tolerance for discrepancies. If discrepancies between clues regarding God's love and pat? terns offered by loving humans begin to mount beyond the level of reasonable tolerance, attention must be turned to the discrepancies themselves. As with</page><page sequence="15">ANTHROPOMORPHIC CONCEPTS OF GOD 137 rounding off, the possible sources as well as the patterns of the discrepancies involved will dictate which course of response is appropriate. Consider comfort in times of bereavement, for example. Loving human beings typic? ally produce feelings of comfort by hugging or speaking encouraging words. Should the believer experience feelings of comfort during such times without the physical presence of anyone, this discrepancy may be attributed not to a difference in divine and human love, but rather to a difference in the way God produces feelings of comfort. Suppose the believer were to receive comfort during times of secret suffering. Ignorant of such suffering, loving human beings typically do not offer comfort at these times. By noting that God can see into the secret recesses of the heart, this discrepancy may be handled without implying any difference between human and divine love. As with rounding off, some discrepancies may require reconsideration of the claim that, literally and univocally speaking, God is loving. In the most drastic case, where no environmental clues paralleling those of human love are forthcoming, the original affirmation may be withdrawn altogether. Alternatively, patterns of clues may be more subtle, indicating the need for some more sophisticated way of speaking. Which sort of modification is in order can be determined by comparisons with the human model. Human beings may be said to be more or less loving, sort of loving or partially loving. They might be said to be loving, metaphorically or figuratively speaking. What may be said depends upon precisely how the clues actually manifested deviate from those presented in cases where it may be said, quite literally, that people are loving. In mature adults, the capacity to formulate and modify judgements on the basis of discrepancies among presented clues is so intricately complex as to defy summary description. Nevertheless, this capacity may be used to interpret patterns of clues presented to religious believers. If matches can be found with specific deviant patterns of human clues, then original judgements that, literally and univocally speaking, God is loving may be replaced by appropriate substitutes. Given this understanding of the evolution of characterizations of the divine based upon initially literal and univocal ways of speaking, the significance of even the crudest anthropomorphisms should not be underestimated. Such ways of speaking may provide a basis for the subsequent development of more sophisticated conceptions of the divine. As just suggested, this may occur by noting ways in which discrepancies among patterns of clues emerge. Alternatively, ways of speaking may be altered more formally by direct conceptual transformation. While the study of concept manipulation is still in its infancy, some of the more rudimentary ways in which ideas may be transformed have been explored by both philosophers and psychologists. For example, Romano Harr? has described ways in which models shaped for use in the sciences can be used to modify concepts. One of the simplest of these involves idealization, the imaginative reconfiguration of a property in con</page><page sequence="16">138 EDWARD L. SCHOEN formity with some scale of values. Discussing paramorphic models, Harr? also outlines ways in which concepts of novel causal mechanisms can be moulded by imaginatively combining properties from several different sources.16 More adventurously, Don Ihde describes elaborate forms of con? ceptual manipulation and modification based upon the systematic variation of fantasies. At a much more elementary level, a number of psychological experiments have been performed to test the scope and nature of such simple transformations as those associated with the rotation of mental images.17 Although a thorough investigation of the ways in which concepts may be extended or modified falls well beyond the scope of this discussion, two points must be emphasized. First, all such transformations involve the manipulation of something originally un transformed. Second, such transformations have disciplined structures that dictate the precise contents of the transformational results, keeping them from dissipating into vaporous ambiguity. By adhering rigorously to specific transformational structures, scientists have been able to evolve precisely detailed and extremely sophisticated ways of characterizing atomic structures that can be traced back to crudely literalistic ways of speaking about billiard balls and planetary orbits. In religious settings, it might be conceded that crudely anthropomorphic ways of speaking about God's love are just as pathetic as early descriptions of atoms. Nevertheless, these literal, univocal ways of speaking may provide essential bases for developing novel, though perfectly precise and richly detailed conceptions of divine love. Were these new concepts to stabilize sufficiently, they could ground freshly standardized ways of speaking about God that would permit the divine to be described as loving in a way different from that in which humans may be said to be loving. Put in the terminology of this discussion, under these conditions God could be said quite literally to be loving, though in a sense no longer univocally attributable to human beings. VI In the course of this investigation, three traditional obstacles to anthropo? morphism have been confronted by appealing to the detachability of clues, particularly the extreme detachability of environmental ones.18 It has been argued that radical differences between divine and human natures need not 16 See Romano Harr?, The Principles of Scientific Thinking (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970), especially ch. 2. 17 See Don Ihde, Existential Technics (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1983), ch. 5. For a discussion of some of the initial psychological investigations exploring the extent to which human beings are capable of mental manipulations, see Roger N. Shepard and Lynn A. Cooper, Mental Images and Their Transformations (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1982). 18 Recently, Frederick Ferr? has addressed a number of other philosophical objections in his ' In Praise of Anthropomorphism', in International Journal for Philosophy of Religion, xvi (1984), 203-212. Specifically religious problems are discussed in Gary Legenhausen, ' Is God a Person? ', in Religious Studies, xxn (1986), 307-23.</page><page sequence="17">ANTHROPOMORPHIC CONCEPTS OF GOD 139 prohibit characterizations of God that, literally and univocally speaking, also may be used in the accurate description of people. Furthermore, desirable human traits may be attributed to God without implying any carryover of objectionable ones. Finally, the epistemic integrity of anthropomorphism should be grounded in patterns of clues rather than in matters of origin. The perspective taken here has not been a factual one. While it has been argued that anthropomorphic characterizations of the divine can be devel? oped by relying upon assorted indicators, no actual clues have been pro? duced. Whether any such clues really exist or what precisely they might indicate must be determined in the course of everyday religious life. If such clues are forthcoming, however, anthropomorphism offers a number of advantages, some of which are of particular relevance to the Judeo-Christian tradition. Obviously, the Biblical record describes God in very personal terms. The embarrassment of such language can be eased by recognizing both the philosophical respectability of anthropomorphic characterizations as well as the indispensability of initially crude anthropomorphisms as bases for subsequent refinement. The Biblical teaching that human beings are created in God's image also might be embraced with renewed enthusiasm. Imaging, of course, is not symmetrical. But the interpretation of imaging as some form of similarity would allow investigations of human traits to provide fruitful avenues for conceptualizing the divine. Other advantages are more general. The detachability of anthropo? morphic characterizations from specific commitments regarding configura? tions or implementations makes them particularly suitable for describing divine beings whose nature or modes of operation are shrouded in mystery. The extreme detachability of environmental clues maximizes this advantage. Furthermore, a personal God may be invoked to account for certain religious experiences. People sometimes feel comforted in a fatherly or motherly way during times of bereavement, though no human parent is present. Forgi? veness or love are sometimes felt in the absence of any human forgiver or lover. Anthropomorphism provides an unusual opportunity for straightfor? wardly explaining such experiences in terms of a God who may be said, quite literally, to be loving, comforting or forgiving. Such bold affirmations are perfectly compatible with the humble admission that the divine essence, constitution, consciousness and modes of operation remain beyond the scope of human comprehension.
