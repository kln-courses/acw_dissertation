<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sociological Analysis 1987, 47, 4:283-301 Auguste Sabatier And The Durkheimians On The Scientific Study Of Religion Donald A. Nielsen State University College, Oneonta, New York This essay examines a significant, yet neglected, polemical context in the devel- opment of the sociology of religion in the Durkheim school: their consistent attack on the ideas of what they entitled the liberal or rationalist Protestant theologians. In reviews in L'Annee Sociologique-their "laboratory" for the gestation of theoretical notions-and in critical sections from their major works, Durkheim, Mauss, Hertz and others in the Durkheim school launched sharp attacks on the work of Sabatier, James, C.P Tiele, J. C. Marillier, Tylor, Spencer, Reville, Richard and several others who worked from an explicitly or implicitly Protestant orientation. Their critique focused on the liberal Protestant emphasis on an essentially "individualistic" methodology, their focus on "sub- jective" modes of religious "experience, " their reliance on a variant of Protes- tant "illuminism " as the basis for their definitions of the essence of religion, their "progressive " theory of historical religious evolution towards the "higher, " more "spiritual "forms of religion (especially Protestantism) and their denegration of the collective and ritual sides of the religious life. The essay attempts to bring out these and several other differences between the two sets of authors, by focusing on a systematic comparison of the two central figures in the polemic: Sabatier and Durkheim. We attempt to recall Sabatier's great significance as the leading representative of liberal Protestantism in France in the late nineteenth century and compare his view of the relationship between religion and science (which he called "critical symbolism ") with that of Durkheim. We argue that the much noted Durkheimian "sociologistic" attack on "individualistic" and " psycholo- gistic" approaches in sociology in general is much better understood when seen as a part of a conflict between alternative conceptions of the nature of the religious life. We briefly conclude the essay with a discussion of the relevance of this turn of the century debate to contemporary controversies in the scientific study of religion, and illustrate the historical repetition of themes by reference to the work of Robert Bellah and several of his critics. The present essay is one in a series projected by the author into the relationships between theology and modem sociological theory. This essay deals with the critique 283</page><page sequence="2">284 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS leveled by Durkheim and his school against leading exponents of "subjectivistic," "rationalistic," or simply "liberal" Protestant theology, most notably Auguste Saba- tier. ' Our aim is not to revive Sabatier's ideas as a theoretical alternative in the scientific study of religion today. Rather, it is to demonstrate that the writings of Sabatier 2 provided an especially central negative reference point and a general polemical context for the Durkheim school. Others such as William James, C. P. Tiele, J. C. Marillier (one of Mauss' former teachers), J. Reville, G. Richard 3 even the sociologists Tylor and Spencer insofar as they shared common theological suppositions with Sabatier and the others-came in for parallel criticism. However, the central figure in our story is clearly August Sabatier.' The Durkheimian critique began as early as the first volume of L 'Annee Sociolo- gique (1898) with the review by Marcel Mauss of a key work by Sabatier (see 1. None of the leading analysts of Durkheim and his school mentions Sabatier or Protestant Liberalism. See, e.g., Lukes (1973), Nandan (1980), Tiryakian (1978). One exception is Pickering (1975) who mentions Sabatier in passing, but concentrates his attention almost entirely on the split between Gaston Richard and Durkheim. On Richard, see Note #3 below. 2. Since Sabatier has been so thoroughly forgotten by sociologists, a very brief biographical note is in order. Sabatier (1839-1901) was a French Protestant theologian who had been deeply influenced by the revivalistic spirit of the early nineteenth century. He studied theology at the universities of Montalban and Tubingen and Heidelberg and in 1867 became Professor of Reformed Theology at Strasbourg. At a later date, he took up the position of Dean of the Protestant Theological Faculty at Paris, which he held until his death. Influenced by Kant and Schleiermacher, he was the foremost representative of Liberalism in France, occupying a position in the country comparable to the roles of Ritschl and Harnack in Germany (although his views differed from these authors' in a number of significant ways). His influence was greatly eclipsed, along with that of Liberalism in general, with the rise of new currents of dialectical neo- orthodoxy associated with the name of Karl Barth. However, Sabatier continued to exert an influence on later writers. His work has more recently become the focus of renewed appreciation and critical analysis among theologians (see Raymond, 1976; Silkstone, 1969). His most important general work on religion (especially for sociologists) was the Esquisse d'une Philosphie de la Religion (1897, reprinted in 1969). The date of its original publication is noteworthy. It comes at the very outset of the full scale Durkheimian effort in the sociology of religion. This book rivals Durkheim's own Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (1912) in its effort to construct a comprehensive theory of religion. It raises many of the same issues from a different standpoint. 3. Pickering (1975) shows some small recognition of our problem in his discussion of the religious roots of the split between Richard and Durkheim. Associated early with Durkheim, Richard later broke with the Durkheimians and associated himself with the group around Rene Worms. He broke with Durkheim around 1907, in Nandan's words "for ideological and religious reasons." Their collectivistic view of morality and religion and, in particular their tendency, in his view, to give too small a place for individual "faith" in our understanding of the religious life increasingly offended Richard's growing religious sensibility, one which ultimately led to his direct affiliation with traditional religion. Regrettably, Picker- ing only mentions Sabatier in passing, focuses on Richard, and misses the former's significance. Sabatier was the centralfigure in French Protestant Liberalism and the Dean of the Protestant Theological Faculty at Paris. His work continues to be discussed by theologians today (see Silkstone, 1968; Raymond, 1976), while Richard is remembered almost exclusively for his association with the Durkheim school and not for any independent contributions. In our view, Pickering's discussion suffers from misplaced emphasis. 4. One reviewer of this essay wondered whether Ritschl rather than Sabatier might be the true object of the Durkheimian critical ire. It is almost certainly the case that the Durkheimians wanted to attack all the representatives of the "school" of thought of Protestant Liberalism (largely German in inspiration) through the medium of its most prominent French representative. However, the fact is that Sabatier's work is repeatedly mentioned and treated in considerable critical detail, while Ritsch receives only passing mention (see Mauss, 1968, I:95) and the work of others is discussed much less extensively.</page><page sequence="3">AUGUSTE SABATIER AND THE DURKHEIMIANS 285 Sabatier, 1897). It continued through Durkheim's major work on religion in 1912, and was revived with the posthumous publication in 1922 of Robert Hertz's work on sin and expiation, originally researched and written during the years 1905-1912. During this period, one covering the entire first phase of the Durkheim school, a variety of writings from this group attacked "liberal" Protestantism in the name of a comparative, historical, systematic and scientific study of religion, one which would offer distinctively sociological alternatives to many of the central concepts treated from a theological standpoint by their opponents. Among the central religious issues at stake in the Durkheimian critique of Protestant "liberalism" were the following: the nature of the experience of "dependence"; the role of "symbolisms" in religion; the relative significance of "individual" versus "collective" processes; the relation- ships between rites, law, and traditions, and the historical processes of "rationaliza- tion" and "rationalism"; the place of "histories" as opposed to the notions of "evolution" and "progress" in the study of religions. A careful look at these issues sheds new light on some neglected sources of the Durkheimian approach to sociol- ogy in general and to religion in particular. Especially important insights into the frequently noted attack on "individualistic" methodologies in favor of "collectivis- tic" orientations to "reason" and "revelation" can be derived from an examination of this critique. Moreover, such a study has a secondary benefit. It helps illuminate by historical comparison some remarkably similar recent debates in the sociology of religion (see especially Bellah, 1970a, 1970b, Klausner, 1970; Nelson, 1970). In the following pages, we will focus on the representative figure of Sabatier. We will alternately examine his key ideas and the Durkheimian critique of him and those who shared his views. I. SABATIER'S THEORY OF RELIGION I: HUMAN NATURE, DEPENDENCE, PRAYER AND RELIGIOUS EVOLUTION. Sabatier maintained that we must understand religion in terms of a psychology of "man" in general. "Man is one . . . " (Sabatier, 1897:80). He argued that the perennial human motives of fear and hope, the feelings of dependence and funda- mental anxiety, lead humans to religion. Sabatier writes: We shall now be able to define the essence of religion. It is a commerce, a conscious willed relation into which the soul in distress enters with the mysteri- ous power on which it feels that it and its destiny depend. This commerce with God is realized in prayer. Prayer is religion in act-that is to say, real religion (Sabatier, 1897:25). Prayer thus represents "the movement of the soul putting itself into personal relation and contact with the mysterious power whose presence it feels even before it is able to give it a name" (Sabatier, 1897:26). The idea that religious experience is based on a "sentiment" of "dependence" upon some higher force can be traced especially to Schleiermacher (1830). Although he conceived of this "dependence" neither as narrowly psychological nor as proof of</page><page sequence="4">286 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS God's existence, but rather the direct human grasp of God, the "Whence" of all things, his conception surely pointed the way towards more "anthropological" perspectives (see MacIntosh, 1964: esp. 68-71). Indeed the philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach, however different in intention and tone his works are from those of Schleiermacher, extended and "humanized" this thesis to include "dependence" upon one's fellows as well as nature as prime roots of the religious image. For Feuerbach (1841; 1967) "the secret of theology is anthropology" (and ultimately even physiology). It is a short step from Schleiermacher and Feuerbach to the above views of Sabatier and even those of Durkheim (to be examined below). Sabatier - and Liberal Protestantism in the nineteenth century in general - "subjectivized" the notion of "dependence" into an image of "inner" religious "experience," while (as we shall see) Durkheim increasingly subjects the notion of "dependence" to a sociological analysis. Drawing on the idea of Schleiermacher, yet criticizing the author's exclusive emphasis on the experience of dependence, Sabatier states that "Religion is a free act as well as a feeling of dependence" (Sabatier, 1897:27). While submission makes us recognize our dependence, faith transforms that dependence into liberty. In order to stress the centrality of God and revelation in religion, Sabatier also states "If religion is the prayer of man, it may be said that revelation is the response of God, but only on condition that we add that this response is always, in germ at least, in prayer itself' (Sabatier, 1897:30). Sabatier also thought that religion progressively "evolves" from polytheism to monotheism and sheds the husk of legalism and ritualism which once covered it. Thus, for Sabatier, the highest religion is the one which is "most inward," one which stresses the "spirit" rather than the "letter." In the end, "The principle of all religion is piety" (Sabatier, 1897:226). This "inward" religious "experience" is at the heart of Christianity in general, while "spontaneity" and "liberty" were redis- covered by Protestantism in particular (see Sabatier, 1897: 132, 209). The root metaphor in which Sabatier prefers to express the social dimension of religion is the "filial metaphor" (Sabatier, 1897:144-145). This is the "essence of Christianity" and is first discovered in the parable of the prodigal son. All the "mysteries" of religion are found expressed in this idea. H. MAUSS' CRITIC REVIEWS OF SABATIER, JAMES, AND TIELE. Marcel Mauss wrote critical reviews of the major works of Sabatier and William James (see Mauss, 1968, Vol. 1:531-536, 539-548). Mauss' review of Sabatier (1897) argued that the latter author was "guided by his piety" and committed to two general principles: (1) the "inner nature of religion" and "the fundamental identity of the religious principle in all humanity" and (2) the idea that the "development of civilization" is paralleled by the "development of the initial contradiction between conscience and the world," and, as a consequence, that there has been a "religious progress" toward increased moral and religious autonomy leading directly to Chris- tianity (Mauss, 1968, Vol. 1:532). Mauss' review of James (1902) also links that author directly to Sabatier and to "the most fundamental doctrine of liberal Protestantism, that of the internal God"</page><page sequence="5">AUGUSTE SABATIER AND THE DURKHEIMIANS 287 (Mauss, 1968, Vol. 1:59). For both writers, in Mauss' view, "Religion is the internal link with God, " one which both stress in the "doctrine of the immanence of God and the possibility of an extrapersonal communion with him." It should be recalled that toward the end of his book, James had approvingly cited a "liberal French theolo- gian's" (Sabatier's) contention that (in James' words) "Prayer in this wide sense is the very soul and essence of religion" (James, 1902:361). Indeed, it is probable that Sabatier exercised an influence on James. In this same vein, Mauss takes Sabatier to task for his definition of religion as "the prayer of the heart" and for his lack of a comparative, historical, sociological understanding of prayer in general. He argues that "it is a fundamental error to believe that prayer is the whole of religion" (Mauss, 1968, Vol. 1:536). Here, it is to be noted that Mauss had (in 1909) completed the first part of a projected (but uncompleted and unpublished) study of prayer entitled "La Priere et les Rites Oraux" (see Mauss, 1968, Vol. 1:366-477). This actually had been the topic of his unfinished thesis. Although it was not published until Karardy's 1968 edition of Mauss' Oeuvres, it sheds a good deal of light on the Durkheimian argument against Protestant Liberalism. In that essay, Mauss (1968, Vol. 1:373-375) refers to the theories of prayer of Sabatier as well as C. P. Tiele (see Tiele, 1897), both of which "have had the greatest success." He criticizes them both for their "subjective" method, one which allows the two authors to draw "almost opposite" conclusions. Consequently, Mauss questions the validity of their findings from a scientific standpoint. Mauss writes of Tiele, on the one hand, that "It is a fact of personal consciousness for Tiele and his coreligionists which is the object of analysis" (Mauss, 1968, Vol. 1:374-375). For Tiele (1897) prayer is one relatively secondary manifestation of religion. It is characterized, on the side of human action, by a "spiritual conversation with God, a movement towards the divinity," but is ulti- mately only achieved and realized by the response of God. Thus, oddly for Tiele, "the response of God is prayer." On the other hand, as we have already seen, Sabatier views prayer as the essence of religion. For him, "Prayer is religion in action" (Sabatier, 1897:25). In Mauss' view, both writers, because of their individu- alistic and subjectivistic presupposition, rooted in their liberal Protestantism, misun- derstood prayer. In both instances they neglected its historical origins in collective oral rites. Moreover, "the results of the discussion are predetermined by the faith of the author" (Mauss, 1968, Vol. 1:375). Mauss even goes so far as explicitly to identify Tiele with "ultraliberal Protestanism, Socinian, remonstrant. . ." (Mauss, 1968, Vol. 1:373). III. HERIZ'S CRITIQUE OF SABATIER'S IDEAS ON SIN AND EXPIATION. Further evidence concerning the Durkheimian critique of Protestant Liberalism is found in Robert Hertz's (1922) introduction to his uncompleted study of sin and expiation.' One of the longest critical sections of Hertz's essay (see Hertz, 1922, esp. 9-19) 5. The present author has discussed this entire text by Hertz on the topic of sin and expiation in a more comprehensive recent essay. See Nielsen (1986).</page><page sequence="6">288 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS deals directly with Sabatier's work on The Doctrine of the Atonement and Its Historical Evolution (see Sabatier, 1903). In Hertz's view, one of the principle stumbling blocks to a true sociological appreciation of sin and expiation was the world view of Liberal Protestantism as exemplified in Sabatier's work. Sabatier drew on the motif of the prodigal son and found the roots of the doctrine of sin and expiation in a simple metaphor - the relationship of father to wayward (but now repentant) son (see Sabatier, 1903). In his view, the elements of the atonement in Christian doctrine are givens of human nature, available to anyone who will inspect his or her own consciousness, and therefore relevant to even the most modern society. Sabatier is especially critical of all forensic images of atonement, so central to the history of the doctrine in the Latin Church (see the work of Lea, 1896, upon which Hertz drew heavily). He prefers to see sin as an assertion of the individual's own will against the demands of filial piety and expiation as an essen- tially inner conversion. For Sabatier, these are subjective moral phenomena, which need to be freed from any superfluous and historically contingent elements. They involve two actors, person and God, face to face, in perennial "dialogue" (on this theme, so central to modern theology and social thought generally, see Pfuetze, 1954). Hertz does not dispute this "new theology" on religious, but only on scientific grounds. Thus, he levels four central criticisms at Sabatier: (1) How does Sabatier separate the "essential" from the other elements of religion? Because Protestant reformers sought to translate the truths of Christianity into individual human senti- ments, it does not follow that this gives us access to the realities of primitive and historical religious beliefs and practices. (2) The self-evident truths of "human nature" on which Sabatier's "metaphor" relies are much more complex than he imagines. It is more correct to say that father and son share a set of common antecedent beliefs which define the nature and potential effectiveness of expiation by the son and forgiveness by the father. As Hertz writes: "The two actors in the religious drama would not be alone with each other; they would both obey . . . representations and sentiments that society has suggested to them . . ." (Hertz, 1922:14). (3) Furthermore, the "metaphor" of the father-son relationship drawn from everyday life experience is not adequate in general to constitute the beliefs which it illustrates. The "self-evident" truths of the religious life are not transparent to everyone and can easily be challenged (Hertz cites the critique of Christianity in Nietzsche, 1968). The tacit assumptions of the "rationalists" (Hertz's general phrase for Sabatier and his followers) betray their own implicit involvement in a set of collective representations characteristic of an historical Protestant tradition. (4) Hertz notes that some traditional Protestant theologians would disagree with the Liberal view, and instead stress Divine transcendence and majesty. Indeed, not all religions accept the image of a forgiving God. Rather, they stress "implacable Justice" as the "master characteristic of the sovereign judge" (Hertz, 1922:17). In a key summary statement Hertz writes: . . . the truth is that the homo religiosus of the new theology exists no more in reality than the homo economicus of classical economics. This new and free being who would obey only the general laws of human nature is, in reality, an</page><page sequence="7">AUGUSTE SABATIER AND THE DURKHEIMIANS 289 actor who, when he appears on the scene, already knows perfectly the role that he must take (Hertz, 1922:17). In conclusion, Hertz's continued reference to Sabatier as a "rationalist" 6 corresponds to the accusation of "subjectivism" that Mauss had launched at Saba- tier, Tiele, and James. Both these outlooks are features of Liberal Protestantism. Its image of a homo religiosus was heavily influenced by Kant and the Enlightenment. This Enlightenment notion of generic human nature was, in turn, itself molded by the Reformation doctrine of knowledge through the "inner light" of conscience available by nature to everyone (Nelson, 1965). Sabatier was heir to both these notions through the influence on him of the philosophy of Kant, Schleiermacher, and nine- teenth-century revivalism (for the parallel influence on Sabatier of Pascal's "theol- ogy of the heart," see Daly, 1980:22-25, 66). IV. DURKHEIM ON SABATIER, RELIGIOUS INDIVIDUALISMAND THE PROB- LEM OF DEPEIVDENCE. Added evidence for our main thesis is found in Durkheim's own work. Durkheim mentions Sabatier and attempts to refute him in a forgotten passage in The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (1912). In defending his now familiar "col- lectivistic" definition of religion, Durkheim counters the possible objection that he has neglected to "include the private religion which the individual establishes for himself." He writes: Not only are these individual religions very frequent in history, but nowadays many are asking if they are not destined to be the preeminent form of the religious life, and if the day will not come when there will be no other cult than that which each man will freely perform within himself (Durkheim, 1912:61). In a footnote to this passage, Durkheim states that "This is the conclusion reached by Spencer . . . and by Sabatier in his Outlines of a Philosophy of Religion Based on Psychology and History . . . and by all the school to which he belongs" (Durkheim, 1912:61, note 65). Indeed, as we will see below, this linkage of Spencer with Sabatier and "all of the school to which he belongs" is noteworthy. Durkheim later criticizes the ideas of another "recent apologist of the faith" (William James) about the concept of "religious experience." He writes: 6. The terms "rationalist," "rationalism," and so on can be used in many different ways, as Max Weber (1930) noted. When Hertz uses the term "rationalist" to describe Sabatier's position, he is referring to the notion of a homo religiosus noted above and to the implicitly "individualistic" bias toward the existence of generic "human nature" which it implies. Here, he correctly points to Sabatier's roots in Kant and an eighteenth-century Enlightenment variant of rationalist individualism, with its doctrine of human nature. By contrast, when Durkheim (1912) speaks of "rationalism" (or apriorism) as a preliminary starting point for his own work, preferable to that of the "empiricists," he is using the term in a more "collectivis- tic" and historical fashion, one oriented less towards "human nature" and more toward the changing forms of collective-historical thought. Indeed, this new type of "collective rationalism" was at the core of Durkheim's own continued belief in the collective "cult" of the individual and the "cult of truth."</page><page sequence="8">290 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS But from the fact that a "religious experience," if we choose to call it this, does exist and that it has a certain foundation-and, by the way, is there any experi- ence which has none?-it does not follow that the reality which is its foundation conforms objectively to the idea which believers have of it (Durkheim, 1912:465). This critique of James' "illuminism" is repeated in a slightly different form later in his work on pragmatism (see Durkheim, 1955:esp. 130-131, 134). In Durkheim's view, Sabatier, James, and Spencer all expressed variants of an "individualistic" view of religion and failed to take sufficient account of the social experiences which lay beneath it.7 In this same context, Durkheim works out the implications of the notion of "dependence" (so central to liberal Protestantism) from a purely sociological stand- point. He writes: Since it is in spiritual ways that social pressure exercises itself, it could not fail to give men the idea that outside themselves there exists one or several powers, both moral and, at the same time, efficacious, upon which they depend. They must think of these powers, at least in part, as outside of themselves . . . (Durkheim, 1912:239). This feeling of dependence is a "spiritual" one related to an experience of moral authority, rather than mere physical coercion. Not only does society provide this experience of an "imperative" spiritual force which obligates and renews the indi- vidual during times of collective process; it also is the source of "methods and traditions which we employ." These latter superior cultural forces provide our experience of "good things" and link them to the existence of "benevolent powers" in the world. Thus, society is the root of the experience of dependence in a double way: as an "imperative" moral authority which constrains the person and as a "benevolent" source of goodness and help to humankind (Durkheim, 1912:242- 243). It would appear that Durkheim's well-known theory of religion attempts to offer a sociological alternative to a key theological concept (dependence) found in the originating figure of Protestant Liberalism (Schleiermacher) as well as later repre- sentatives of this tradition (Sabatier). Indeed, if anything, we have underestimated the scope and intensity of Durkheim's stress on the experience of dependence. It plays a central role in his entire treatment, recurs frequently in various guises throughout his text, and provides the central pinion for his identification of the notions of Divinity, Society, and Totality (Durkheim, 1912:490, note 18). Durkheim also denies that this sentiment of dependence can be taken as the basis for theological 7. Here, it might be worth mentioning that, despite the frequent Durkheimian criticisms of "individual- istic" Liberal Protestantism in its French (and implicitly its German) manifestations, we have been unable to discover any reference in Durkheim or his school to the social gospel movement in America. Given Durkheim's knowledge of American pragmatism, it is difficult to believe that he and his followers were totally ignorant of the literature of this movement. However, in the absence of any firm evidence, we can state little with certainty on the topic.</page><page sequence="9">AUGUSTE SABATIER AND THE DURKHEIMIANS 291 inferences. Thus, on the surface, he shares Feuerbach's "atheistic" rejection of the traditional conception of the "object" (God) said to correspond to the experience of dependence. However, Durkheim can also be seen as the author of a sociological alternative to Feuerbach's "philosophical anthropology" of religious dependence. More precisely, Durkheimr's view is a kind of sociological "pantheism." He sees dependence as perpetually corresponding to a variety of complex and omnipresent historical sociocultural processes which are always "adequate" to "cause" the sentiment of dependence and bring about myriad expressions of its experienced actuality. In many ways, Durkheim is close in spirit to Spinoza. That author's conception of God as Substance with infinite attributes and as a transcendent yet immanent Whole, is structurally similar to Durkheim's identification of Divinity and Totality with Society (Spinoza, 1951:51ff.; Durkheim, 1912:488491). In this con- nection, we are reminded by Mauss, in his brief discussion of the Durkheimian method of studying the "social history of the categories of the human spirit," that ". . . Durkheim treated the notion of the whole after having treated with me the notion of genre" (Mauss, 1966:333-334). Indeed, it might be argued that Durkheim's first and last major works (Durkheim, 1893; 1912) were preoccupied precisely with this question of the forms of social solidarity and symbolic representation of the Whole or Totality. From another standpoint, Durkheim's famous definition of religion as a "uni- fied system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden-beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral commu- nity called a Church, all those who adhere to them" (Durkheim, 1912:62) stresses rites, as much as beliefs, and the importance of communities. This contrasts with Sabatier's rejection of ritualism and legalism as the historical "survival" of out- moded Jewish and Roman Christian ideas. Sabatier recognizes the importance of the changing social "forms" of religion, yet relegates them to a secondary position in his theory. Sabatier fought against the "religions of authority," whether in the form of Roman Catholic legalism or Protestant Biblicism, in favor of what he called a higher "religion of the spirit," one found universally in "human nature" and linked to the autonomy of individual conscience. He would probably have seen Durkheim's "societal" theory of religion as a modern scientific attempt again to assert collective authority at the expense of individual "faith." In conclusion to this section, it is worth noting that Durkheim rejected all theories of religious, juridical and moral life which rested on "subjectivistic" prem- ises or depended on some concept of generic "human nature." His early critique of Spencer's views on contract and society would provide an example (see Durkheim, 1893). For similar reasons, he rejected Spencer's idea that religion corresponded to the "supernatural," the "sentiment of mystery" and the "unknowable" (Durkheim, 1912:26, 39). Durkheim (1912: esp. 44, 96-88) levels a similar critique at Tylor's view of religion as a belief in "spiritual beings" or animism. Finally, of similar relevance is Durkheim's (1912:44) criticism of J. Reville's attempt to define religion in terms of notions of divinity. Reville, it will be recalled, was himself a theologian and, indeed, a "colleague and coreligionist" of Sabatier at Paris (Raymond, 1976:241). He also wrote an admiring "Memoir of Sabatier" in preface to the latter's most distinctive theological work, 7he Religions of Authority and the Reli-</page><page sequence="10">292 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS gion of the Spirit (1904). Indeed, the very title of this book presents the most fundamental tenet of Sabatier's work, the juxtaposition of a single "religion of the spirit," rooted in a common human nature, but historically developed most fully in Protestantism with its notions of autonomy, faith, and individual conscience, with the historically diverse religious systems which have depended upon authoritative organization, church hierarchy, or dogmatic adherence to sacred texts. All of these criticisms reflect Durkheim's general rejection of views of religion and knowledge which were explicitly or implicitly fideistic in character. All such views implied a concession to "faith," involved "anthropomorphic" projections, relied on one or another notion of an "intuition" into the existence of "divinity," "spiritual beings," "supernatural forces," "mystery," "the unknowable," as reali- ties available to individual "human nature," apart from collective historical social experience. Durkheim's rejection of the various theories of Sabatier, James, Reville, Tylor, Spencer, and others-however different they may appear; depended upon his perception that they all rested on the common idea that religion emerged from the unaided experience of the "individual" and that a reference to "human reason" rooted in "human nature" was sufficient to account for religion. As noted, these ideas reflect a variant of the Protestant doctrine of an "inner light" so important to the foundation of the Enlightenment (and also Romanticism). When carried over into the study of religion, they allowed their proponents to separate the "essence" of religion as individual piety and experience from the changing social "forms" taken by religion in history and society. Moreover, there were "practical" consequences to this theoretical vision. If the individual through the "inner light" of unaided human reason, or an innate senti- ment rooted in the human psyche, was sufficient to gestate religion, then one could continue to do so apart from society. For Durkheim, beyond its scientific inadequa- cies, this view had "egoistic" and "antinomian" consequences. It tended to release the individual from an obligation to integrate conduct and experience within socio- cultural contexts. Durkheim's entire sociological stress on the problem of solidarity and his image of moral reconstruction depended on such a notion of contextual integration of conduct and experience (see Durkheim, 1893; 1897). Thus, in all likelihood, there were some "practical" as well as methodological-scientific compo- nents to Durkheim's rejection of the views of writers associated with Protestant Liberalism. V. SABATIER'S THEORY OF RELIGION II: SYMBOLISM, REVELATION AND FAITH8. Another distinctive motif in Sabatier's work is the role he ascribes to symbolism in religion. His view of symbolism differs markedly from that of Durkheim. The 8. It is important to note that the comments in the following sections (V-VI) do not reflect actual criticisms made by each author of his opponent, and therefore must be separated from the direct critique of Sabatier discussed above. Here, rather, we present "objective" differences between them on some key issues in the study of religion. In this way, we hope to reveal some deeper differences between the two central authors than were brought out in the first sections of our paper.</page><page sequence="11">AUGUSTE SABATIER AND THE DURKHEIMIANS 293 problem of symbolism in religion provides an axial point for the comparison of the two authors. It also leads us directly towards a more recent debate in the scientific study of religion, one which has strong "family resemblances" to the earlier contrast between Sabatier and Durkheim. Sabatier argues that symbolism has strong "poetic" aspects and addresses itself to the totality of our sensibility. Symbols, in his view, lose their inspirational value when they are subjected to rational scrutiny and analysis. It is precisely the ambigu- ity and multi-vocality of religious symbols which make them valuable as an "illumi- nation" of a higher power. Symbols participate in the world of revelation and reveal the occult element in existence. Since symbols are the medium of expression for an experience of God, and are the vehicles of our faith, they are reducible neither to the conventional analytical languages of science nor to common sense. In this way, symbols are essential to religion as well as art, and make these modes of expression and consciousness profoundly different from the artificial, conceptual languages of the sciences. Symbols allow for the expression of extraordinary states of "illumina- tion" and, when communicated, transfigure experience for others. In fact, symbols are fundamentally communicative and provide the means for the creation of a collective "non-rational" religious consciousness. Since the "object of religion is transcendent," symbols allow us to "express the invisible by the visible" (Sabatier, 1897:316-317). They, "much better than science, attest the victory and royalty of spirit" (Sabatier, 1897:318). The aim of the symbol is to produce in us "the emotions, the transport, the enthusiasm, the faith, that the poet himself experienced in engendering it" (Sabatier, 1897:318). For Sabatier, the "idea of symbol and the idea of mystery are correlative. Who says symbol says at the same time occultation and revelation" (Sabatier, 1897:320). The "true content of the symbol is entirely subjective: it is the conscious relation of the subject to God" (Sabatier, 1897:321). But as symbols harden, subject to the powers of generalization and abstraction, they lose touch with their primitive spirit. Thus, they require renovation and reinterpretation. The great "initiators" in the history of religion have been "creators of symbols" (Sabatier, 1897:323)9. Theology is only a "higher symbolism" (Sabatier, 1897:325). For Sabatier, the continuing transformation of the churches themselves will be advanced and the petrifaction of the spirit avoided by the method of "critical symbolism." Their traditions will be examined from a symbolic point of view and subjected to new infusions of "spirit" and new forms of interpretation. In this way, he hopes to avoid the excesses of both orthodoxy and rationalism. The former has lost touch with the essentially symbolic character of all religious teachings. The latter kills the soul of religion in the name of clear, logically consistent, and verifiable concepts. In this way, Sabatier wants to safeguard faith while also giving rational criticism a role. Indeed, his view of religious knowledge is explicitly fideistic in intention. In this same spirit, he en- 9. Here, Sabatier's formulation resembles Max Weber's distinction between "charisma" and "rou- tine," and echoes his fear of "mechanized petrifaction" and the "running down" of the springs of charisma (Weber, 1930:182). This is probably because Weber derived his distinctions from students of the early church (especially Rudolf Sohm, 1892) and historical evidences about the problem of the fate of primitive charismatic Christianity. Also, both formulations are heavily indebted to Protestant world images of "spirit" and its worldly fate of "mechanization."</page><page sequence="12">294 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS dorsed the movement begun by his close friend, Menegoz, under the name "sym- bolo-fideism" (see Sabatier, 1969:406, for an important note omitted from the English version of his major work). VI. DURKHEIIL ON SYMBOLISM, SOCIETY AND CIVILIZATION. Durkheim also thought that religion-all of society-was only possible because of a "vast symbolism." Here, we will discuss only those aspects of his well-known theory which are related to our topic. Durkheim thought that religious symbols, especially the varying symbols of divinity, did express an "other reality" external to the individual. The "unanimous sentiments" of believers could not be based on pure illusion. There was a truth to religion. However, the object of this religious "experi- ence" was different from what the faithful believed. Here, Durkheim parts company with Sabatier. While the latter sees "revelation" and "occultation" expressed in symbols, Durkheim sees societal and civilizational processes as the external object which is "represented" in religious sentiment, experience, and symbolization. Durkheim argued that symbols and symbolisms were best understood when their functioning was connected with "total" social processes (see on this point Mauss, 1976:1, 78). Symbols served as both an intellectual expression of antecedent social groupings and processes and a constitutive structure which ordered and recreated individual and collective experience. In one of his most remarkable notes, Durkheim hypothesizes that ... . the concept of totality, that of society and that of divinity are very probably only different aspects of the same notion" (Durkheim, 1912:492). The concept of totality is the most inclusive concept, comprehending all others. Similarly, the concept of totality points to the most comprehensive reality for the individual, society, or civilization, and to the most synthetic symbolic "representation" of that reality-that of Divinity. This points to a very different sociological interpretation of what is meant by "symbol" in general and the "symbol," Divinity in particular. Unlike Sabatier, who segregates rational concepts from religious experience, Durkheim sees the rational concepts of science as well as those of religion (and other cultural spheres)-all "categories of human spirit" (see Mauss, 1966:333-334)-as symbolic structures, ones ultimately linked to the totalities of societal and civiliza- tional processes (i.e. those common to two or more societies) (see Durkheim and Mauss, 1971). Such categories have their original source in religious beliefs and practices (see Durkheim, 1912; Durkheim and Mauss, 1963). For Durkheim, sci- ence and religion and their categorial structures have a greater continuity than allowed by Sabatier.'0 They are both moral phenomena, and, as a result, always related to the total body of the social process whatever its scope. Scientific categories were originally differentiated from the sphere of religious sentiment and the sacred and have subsequently become "rationalized" and "univer- salized" (see Durkheim and Mauss, 1963:88; also Cornford, 1957), especially by 10. Durkheim had argued in a similar vein against Levy-Bruhl's excessive separation of the pre-logical primitive mentality from the civilized forms of thought. (See Durkheim, 1969:679-681).</page><page sequence="13">AUGUSTE SABATIER AND THE DURKHEIMIANS 295 the vehicle of "artificial" mathematical forms and languages. However, of all the categories, that of "totality" continues to be most inclusive. This is true at all historical periods, quite regardless of the conception of "totality" which is held. In turn, this concept of "totality" is identified by Durkheim with complex societal and civilizational processes themselves, working at every level, from the most "particu- laristic" tribal society to the more "universal" society which might emerge through wide-ranging civilizational processes. In the end, for Durkheim, all symbols and symbolisms can be rationally under- stood because they can be comprehended sociologically. For Sabatier, the most powerful symbols ultimately express "revelation," and defy rational comprehen- sion. For those today who share Sabatier's viewpoint, symbols also provide a ground for the reassertion of transcendence (and ultimately faith) in a world dominated by rational, scientific thought with its "reductionistic" tendency to "disenchant" the world. Indeed, the "critical symbolism" of Sabatier and the even more explicit "symbolo-fideism" of his friend Menegoz (endorsed by Sabatier) finds a close counterpart among modem sociologists in Robert Bellah's call for a new "symbolic realism" in the study of religion. Here, in conclusion, a few brief remarks on Bellah are appropriate. They are meant to suggest some important "family resemblances" among theories past and present. In contrast to what we would view as decisive evidence in our preceding discussion of the Durkheimian polemic against Sabatier and Protestant Liberalism, the following concluding remarks reflect more tentative suggestions of possible "genealogies of ideas" which require further analytical and historical specification. VII. SYMBOLISM, FIDEISMAND SOCIOLOGY-CONTINUITIES IN THE SCIEN- TIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION FROM SABATIER AND DURKHEIM 10 BELLAH. Bellah values the sociological insights provided by both "consequential" and "'symbolic reductionism," identified variously with the work of Marx, Freud, Durkheim", Weber, Malinowski and others. Yet he also claims that the "three great non-believers" (Freud, Durkheim, and Weber) were all forced to recognize the role of the non-rational and non-cognitive factors in human existence. In order to go beyond these writers, he openly asserts the autonomous creative function of religious as well as poetic, artistic, mythic symbols operating in a different way from the cognitive symbols of science. Dissatisfied also with the analysis of symbols provided by phenomenology, an approach which tends to "treat religious systems as em- balmed specimens . . ." (Bellah, 1970a:95), Bellah wants to forge a "new integra- 1 1. One reviewer of an earlier draft of this essay suggested that Bellah's work can be best understood if he is viewed as a follower of Durkheim and that he does not have an "individualistic" theory of religion. While we must forgo an exhaustive treatment of Bellah's sociology at this time, our argument above will suggest that Bellah's work contains theoretical stresses which are not easily understood if he is taken solely as a follower of Durkheim, and that his relationship to the latter is far more ambiguous than the reviewer suggests. In sum, we argue that Bellah is also a "follower" of Paul Tillich, that his sociology of religion contains deep "anti-structural" elements and "subjectivistic" components alien to the Durkhei- mian tradition, and that his theory of religious evolution cannot be fully accounted for by reference to Durkheim's (or even Weber's) work.</page><page sequence="14">296 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS tion" of religion and social science around the problem of symbolism and to see life renewed with the aid of symbols, by arguing that they point to another reality sui generis. In this way, elements of "heart," the magical, the mythic and poetic, even a sort of divinely inspired "madness," can be reintroduced into our understanding of religion. Thus, the category of eros will also be reasserted to balance the restrictive demands of nomos (Bellah, 1970c:230-237; 1973:xxxix). He also hopes that "sym- bolic realism," an approach which aims at avoiding the variety of reductionistic methods of earlier thinkers, will provide new lines of communication between the theologian and the sociologist. Bellah (1970c:xv,255) states that he drew a powerful inspiration from the work of Paul Tillich (esp. 1952, 1948). There is no direct evidence that he was familiar with Sabatier's parallel effort. However, Tillich's view of the role of symbolisms in religion and their relationship to faith is remarkably similar to that of Sabatier. Both attempted to bring Protestantism into conjunction with the major currents of moder- nity, while retaining the elements of transcendence and faith, through the medium of symbols (see Sabatier, 1897; Tillich, 1932). It is therefore not surprising that Bellah's "symbolic realism" should bear a similarity both linguistically and substan- tively to Sabatier's "critical symbolism" or "symbolo-fideism." All three authors share the view that symbols provide a link between human experience and other levels of "reality" which would otherwise be closed off to humankind. Through symbols, the experience of direct individual and collective "participation" in the realm of the transcendent becomes possible (compare Bellah, 1970c:256-257; Saba- tier, 1897, 316-318; Tillich, 1958:4145). Bellah also shares Sabatier's concept of evolution toward "subjective" religious orientations,' despite the differences in the details of their evolutionary reconstruc- tions of historical stages (see Bellah, 1970c:xvi, xxix-xx, 44-45). In our view, this resemblance is not accidental, but integral to the point of view shared by the two authors on the problem of symbolism. Their evolutionism in matters historical goes with their subjectivism in regard to faith and transcendence. Both conceptualizations converge in their views of religious symbolism. History evolves towards more "individualistic" and "subjectivistic" religious standpoints. The "modem" form of religion, in which the world becomes an 12. In opposition to those who see Bellah's "evolutionary" theory as Durkheimian (or even Parsonian) in inspiration, it is of interest that his 1959 essay on "Durkheim and History" gives us neither a hint of Bellah's own emerging "evolutionary" perspective, nor any sense that Durkheim himself was regarded at that time by Bellah as a source of "evolutionary" perspectives. In that essay, Durkheim and his followers are treated as pioneers of comparative historical sociology closer to that of Weber than to the "evolution- ary" stage theory approach to history later taken by Bellah (or Parsons and several other prominent thinkers these days). Contrast the recent treatment by Wallwork (1986:esp. 207-211) which does treat Durkheim as an evolutionist. In fact, Bellah informs us that, although his theory of religious evolution was worked out more fully in conjunction with Parsons and others in 1963, its origins go back as far as 1956 and its argument "states the main presuppositions underlying my work Tokugawa Religion" (Bellah, 1970c:xvi). Parsons' own evolutionary orientation begins to appear in a decisive way from 1963 forward (see Parsons, 1963; 1964; 1966). If Bellah's evolutionary theory were exclusively Durkheimian in origin, it is odd that its early formulation in 1956 should show up so little in his treatment of "Durkheim and History" three years later. Given these facts, we would suggest a deeper independent origin to this strand of thought in Bellah, one connected with his desire to offer a substitute for a Marxian theory of history, (see Bellah, 1970c:20) while at the same time accommodating his new religious standpoint discovered under the influence of Tlhich's variant of Protestantism (Bellah, 1970c:xv-xvi).</page><page sequence="15">AUGUSTE SABATIER AND THE DURKHEIMIANS 297 "infinite possibility thing" (Bellah, 1970c:40), places stress on the increasing free- dom and autonomy of the religious subject in relationship to established doctrines, that is, established religious symbolizations. The axis of the progressive revelation of new religious insights is thus found now in the individual subject. This subject acts in the light of his newfound knowledge that he represents a "dynamic multidimensional self' constituted by symbolic processes (Bellah, 1970c:42). Thus, one can more fully become a conduit of transcendent forces and capture them in symbolic forms, ones which are "irreducible" to any established human social reality. The "self' thus becomes a "transcendental" power. Moreover, the "modem" religious worldview "summarizes" all previous stages of history. Prepared by "early modern" individualistic Protestantism, the "modem" phase provides the standpoint from which all previous religious symbolisms, from the most primitive myth to the more recent structures of doctrine, can be reappropri- ated and shared in a spirit of "participation." The divinely inspired "madness" of the individual "self' which can reappropriate redeeming historical symbols for individual and collective use, especially during our current times of "contingency" (Bellah, 1970c:xx), allows the stream of charisma, the transcendent gifts of grace, to be continually renewed. The fruits of "faith" (in a rather "post-modem" sense of the term) thus become central components of the social process. They are concep- tualized in terms of the theory of religious knowledge which Bellah calls "symbolic realism" and Sabatier "critical symbolism" (or, alternately, "symbolo-fideism"). Indeed, both are authors of fideistic theories of religious knowledge, if by that term is meant an effort to save an image of religious faith and view it as an essential to the "human condition," while at the same time accommodating to the requirements of sociological and historical science. Indeed, it is precisely the theory of religious symbolism which provides the ideal ground for the advancement of such fideistic efforts in the work of Sabatier, Tillich, Bellah, and others. In their view, the more we know about the nature of symbolisms, the more the "ground" of human existence -in the phrase of Jacob Boehme, one of Tillich's inspirations (Adams, 1965:32)-is revealed to be within the "self' and to be other than what it has been taken for by "objectivizing" rational scientific thought. The aforementioned relationship to Tillich runs deeper in Bellah's work than might be imagined by those who link him exclusively to Durkheim, Weber, or Parsons. Indeed, Parsons' own work, especially his model of the "human condi- tion," owes something to and is congruent at one key point at least with Bellah's (and even Tillich's) views on religion. Bellah's contributions to the gestation of this mature Parsonian model is clearly stated by Parsons. The "telic system," which provides the grounds for the meaning of human action in his paradigm, received its fourfold categorial designations from Bellah. The notions of "ultimate ground," "ultimate order," "ultimate fulfillment" and "ultimate agency" provided by Bellah were, in turn, derived "immediately from the work of Paul Tillich (1952) who defined religion as dealing with matters of ultimate concern" (Parsons, 1978:390). Indeed, the interchanges in Parsons' paradigm of the human condition between the "telic system" and the earlier Parsonian notion of the "action system" are explicitly stated to be those of "grace" and "faith." Although Parsons does not dwell long on this interchange, it appears to refer to just that relationship which Bellah attempted to</page><page sequence="16">298 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS conceptualize in his notion of "symbolic realism"-the ultimate grounding of the human condition in grace, through gifts of the spirit, ones which are the fruits of faith in the existence of transcendent forces, and ones which manifest and clothe themselves in "particular" symbolic forms. Parsons actually refers favorably at one point to Bellah's "important contribu- tion" in his concept of "symbolic realism." Parsons believes this notion "refers only to one component of the symbol, the 'particularized,' but not the transcendent-in Kant's sense- component," that is, the component of symbols "comparable to the sense data of empirical knowledge, not to the categories" (Parsons, 1978:372). The "immanent" quality accorded to symbols and their meanings by Bellah, one which makes them immune to full conceptualization through "reductionistic" accounts, gives the symbolic realm its specifically "theological" overtone, in Parsons' image, as a process of continued "breaking through" into sensory awareness of some "other" realm. In Parsons' words, the "telic system" conceptualizes in scientific terms the ultimate ground of human meaning which the world religions have always provided and corresponds to the universal religious sentiment that, after all, there must be "something there" (Parsons, 1978:371). This is also the ultimate thrust of Bellah's notion of "symbolic realism." Although in Bellah the noncognitively ori- ented element is stressed, in Parsons a more "rationalistic" component emerges in his view that the "telic system" must, in the end, also involve "cognitively under- standable sorts of objects" (Parsons, 1989:371).2 While the above remarks are only preliminary suggestions concerning the rela- tionships between Parsons and Bellah, they do provide some reasons for thinking that Parsons' later work, as well as that of Bellah, stands in a determinate relation- ship to the Protestant theological tradition, and to the work of Paul Tillich in particular. As we have already noted, Tillich's views on these matters (symbolism, meaning, and the grounds of human existence) evidence a surprising continuity with those of Sabatier. Here, we can tentatively conclude that there is a common stock of religious ideas and images shared by several writers working explicitly or implicitly within the Protestant tradition, although each writer relates to this common inheri- tance in different ways by stressing somewhat different components of the overall structure. One further ground shared by Sabatier and Bellah concerns the "practical" standpoints on religious matters. Their theoretical position makes them resistent to religious orthodoxy or dogma. As we have seen, Sabatier was influenced by the spirit of nineteenth-century revivalism and rejected all "religions of authority, " whether in 13. Parsons' later work on the "human condition" recapitulates some of his earlier intellectual and biographical history in its focus on the linkages between biological, social and physico-chemical proc- esses, on the one hand, and their ultimate grounds of meaning on the other. He has indicated rather obliquely that his initial career choice of the social rather than the biological sciences was connected with the influence of an "older brother who had gone into medicine" as well as his father, "a congregational minister" who was "very much involved with the then important 'social gospel' movement" (Parsons, 1970:826, 877). In our view, which cannot be argued at length in these pages, Parsons' wide-ranging merger of evolutionary-biological and social-religious motifs goes well beyond the bounds of sociology and has the character of a "theodicy." It needs to be read against the background of American efforts in the nineteenth century to combine Protestant religious orientations with the findings of modern science (see White, 1972; Wiener, 1965; Vidich and Lyman, 1985).</page><page sequence="17">AUGUSTE SABATIER AND THE DURKHEIMIANS 299 the form of Jewish "legalism," Roman Catholic "hierarchy," or Protestant Bibli- cism. Indeed, his strong influence on and sympathies with Alfred Loisy and short- lived movement of Catholic Modernism are telling in this respect (see the valuable work of Daly, 1980:esp. 62-66). Bellah has also seen any reassertion of traditional Reformation theology, such as Karl Barth's neo-orthodoxy, as an inadequate response to the scientific and existen- tial challenges to religion in the twentieth century (Bellah, 1970c:49, 250). He has instead favored the efforts of writers like Buber and Tillich to "heal the split" (Bellah, 1970c:250). It is of related interest that Bellah found the "revivalistic spirit" (if not always the precise expressions) of the sixties "counter culture" in politics and religion to be challenging to his own religious sensibility. The issues raised, such as those of authenticity and total commitment of the person, were, in his view, worthy of serious consideration by sociologists as teachers and scholars (see the revealing statement in Bellah, 1970d). Bellah's sympathies in this regard help account for the gestation of his theory of "symbolic realism" at the tail end of this historical period. They probably also had a determinate bearing on the controversy which emerged around him in connection with his prospective appointment at the more "orthodox" Princeton University (See Parsons, 1973). Finally, it is worth noting in this connection that Bellah's early statement of his notion of "symbolic realism" drew strong criticism from several authors (Klausner, 1970; Nelson, 1970), on both theoretical and practical grounds parallel to those employed by the Durkheimians in opposition to Sabatier. First, Bellah's critics questioned the very possibility of a scientific study of religion on the basis of the theory of "symbolic realism," one which seemed to tamper with the "subject- object" distinction and assimilate theological and sociological standpoints too read- ily to one another. Second, the same possibilities for individual and collective antinomianism which the Durkheimians found in Sabatier and Protestant "subjectiv- ism" were resurfaced by Bellah's critics in regard to his new standpoint. They interpretated his ideas (whether correctly or not) as an open invitation to individual antinomianism and collectivistic totalism based on the mass "irrational" appropria- tion of unconscious collective symbols. Here, we come full circle in our discussion. The Durkheimian critique of Sabatier parallels the recent opposition to Bellah's "symbolic realism." The latter author, in turn, has been one of the most vocal opponents of "reductionism" in the study of religion and has insisted in the manner of Sabatier that "symbolisms" result in a "transfiguration" of reality'4. The issues and relationships are complex, both analytically and historically, but the recent repetition of arguments and counter- arguments similar to the ones presented in an earlier period speaks to the continuing relevance of the encounter between the scientific study of religion and Protestant Liberalism. 14. Indeed, more recently, Bellah has even offered a remarkable interpretation of Durkheim which argues that the latter author thought creative periods of "collective effervescence" actually resulted in a "trans- figuration" of reality through religious symbolisms, i.e. a view closer to Bellah's "symbolic realism," and that Durkheim could hardly be called a "reductionist" at all (see Bellah, 1973). In our view, Bellah has overstated his case concerning Durkheim. However, fuller proof would be needed than can be offered in these pages. We hope to be able to offer an alternative exegesis of Durkheim's views on the problem of "symbolic reductionism" in the near future.</page><page sequence="18">300 SOCIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS REFERENCES Adams, James L. 1965.
