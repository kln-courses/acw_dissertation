Mais les forces de d?sagr?gation agissent aussi, fortement, inexorablement. Les vents de l'au-del? ont enfin raison d'eux et on ne peut plus compter pour des actes remarquables que sur des morts plus frais.* Henri Michaux "Voyage au pays de la Magie" 1940 The essay that follows was originally conceived as a commentary on reports given by eyewitnesses who were able to attend, on September 25 and 26, 1974, an exceptionally elaborate funerary ceremony held at Letomoy, the most important traditional village of the Mbogote group,1 in the central area of North Malekula, colonial New Hebrides (today independent under the name of Vanuatu). These reports, although in themselves episodic and somewhat scanty, have the merit of complementing with firsthand observations the indirect information regarding the funerary practices of this area of Melanesia collected by lohn Layard and A. Bernard Deacon towards the beginning of this century. In particular, with the exception of a filmed document (which was also taken, apparently, in 1974, and which we were able to see only after the bulk of this essay had already been written), no other firsthand ethnographic description exists that permits us to glimpse what may have been, and perhaps to some extent still is, the specific ritual use and conceptual meaning of the large funerary mannequins, the rambramb, and of the other funerary effigies long known from examples present in museums and private collections all over the world. It was in part by chance and in part because of the remarkable familiarity that Georges Liotard had developed with the Mbogote that the secret surrounding the mannequins' fabrication was revealed in part ?perhaps in extremis ?just before their disappearance. Our attempt, then, has been to reconcile these new observations with those scattered in the old sources, considering that verification within the ethnological approach consists, in any case, of reshaping, by successive reformulations, our knowledge of the facts, in order to bring them to a level for us ever more plausible and intelligible. It is in this spirit that we have undertaken this reading of the recent and earlier available descriptions, in the hope of making the elements of the new "discovery" accessible even to nonspecialists of this region. So what we propose to attempt in these pages is a new anthropological interpretation (which for us is the equivalent of a new, more adherent form of description) of an important complex of Melanesian funerary rituals, and in particular of the sacra, me different kinds of effigies that are produced, manipulated, and exhibited in them. The lack of truly intensive and systematic studies of any of Vanuatu's traditional cultures (such as we have, for example, for the Solomon Islands, the Massim Bay area, d'Fntrecasteaux, etc.) and of a coherent comparative effort for the whole of the archipelago that would give account of its remarkable variety of cultural forms and of their position in the context of the vast Melanesian puzzle is certainly a great handicap.2 We *"They better appreciate the value of a man once he is dead. Having shed his tricks, his working ground (his body), he finally shows-himself in the open, they claim. Anything sensational has always been the work of the dead. But one must hurry. Ten years or so after death (eighteen or twenty for exceptional temperaments), the dead one fades away. It is a question of pride for the Magi to live on for the longest time possible. But the forces of disintegration are also at work, powerfully, inexorably. The winds of the beyond finally have the better of them, and for remarkable actions one can count only on fresher dead." 1. Sometimes known as the Small Nambas because of the relatively small penis sheath they use and to distinguish them from the so-called Big Nambas; the exact ethnographic applicability of these two terms, however, has not been precisely established.

Our ambitions of scholarly thoroughness, then, are of necessity very limited in relation to those of the classic authors on whose investigations we shall in good part rely. At present, there is little hope that the political situation of the again independent archipelago and the sociodemographic state of the surviving traditional cultures will permit any serious field study capable of filling the still considerable lacunae of our information: it is perhaps just as well. Someday a Vanuatuan will write about the thoughts and the life of his own people. As for us, the state of the documents has suggested a rather unusual approach: not to gloss over the gaps in the record but to concentrate exclusively on those areas where it seems that some light can be shed, if only fleetingly, on the mysteries of Malekulan thanatology.3 This, then, is not a "treatise," to be read from A to Z, but rather a series of shorter and longer sketches, which in fact could even be arranged and read in a different order. A funeral rite in Letemoy, Central Malekula: Georges Liotard's recollections Perched on the slopes of the ridges along the central mountain chain of the island, the last villages of the Small Nambas (Mbogote) still provide homes for small groups of 15 to 20 individuals gathered around the nasara, the dance place, and the nakamal, the men's house. The last representatives of the traditional culture in the interior of the island, today (in 1974) these groups, as a whole, do not number more than 150 individuals. The funeral ritual described here took place on September 25 and 26, 1974, in Letemoy, the principal ceremonial center of the Small Nambas. We were able to take part in this ceremony because of the relations we had established with these villages during several visits over the years between 1965 and 1975. It was our feeling that, because of the complex and demanding requirements of the liturgy and the threat of extinction looming over these small populations of the interior, it would be difficult in the future to attend a ritual of this importance. Before we were able to witness it, we had to wait near the village for about two weeks while preparations were being made. We had been given the use of an isolated hut, which we could leave only to reach a water source some 200 yds away. As they returned from the gardens, women would stop to offer us yams, taro, manioc, and sometimes a piece of wild pig. The men would pay us brief visits. At some distance from our hut we could make out the intense activity going on. We would hear drum rolls during the night, punctuated by the sound of conches. In 1972, Louis Nedjar had witnessed the first part of the ritual, devoted at the time to two dead men, Bialo and M'batiklao, whose funerary mannequins were now going to reappear.4 The notes he had taken are a useful introduction to the description of the ceremony we had the fortune to witness: The body of the dead man first rests in a hut where the relatives and villagers can mourn for it. The women stay at the entrance of the hut. The cadaver is laid out on the ground on a strip of red calico; his face is coated with clay; he is wearing a new penis sheath. Deep grooves have been dug around the archipelago, and so it can be used by us only indirectly. Rivers's (1914) true interest was a broad historical picture of the whole of Oceania (with the exclusion of New Guinea). Deacon (1934b; published posthumously; he died on Malekula in 1927) is full of very valuable insights on many aspects of the culture but lacks coherence. Layard (1942) produced the most valuable study, dedicated to the North of Malekula and to the neighboring islands of Atchin and Vao. Remarkable as it is (the text by J. MacClancy that we publish as a complement to ours should attest to this), its monumental and encyclopedic qualities do not fully compensate for a certain lack of comprehensive vision and theoretical concern. Without these last two works, however, this study would not have been possible at all. The present authors' interest stems from a wish to apply to matters generally thought to be of purely "aesthetic" (or else of purely socioeconomic) concern ideas and approaches that they had developed in their independent studies of ritual and symbolic processes. For a first joint attempt at sketching their views on the anthropological study of symbolism, see their editorial introduction to the special issue of the Rassegna italiana di sociolog?a devoted to this topic (Guidieri and Pellizzi 1975). 3. We hope our (native) English-speaking readers will forgive us certain liberties we have taken with their language, even, on occasion, against the opinion of our translators. We felt that in some instances to give the correct periphrasis would have been more cumbersome than to introduce a neologism or a gallicism. This is the case, for instance, with the adjectives "ontic" and "mysteric" and with the substantive "ancestrality." Language innovations, of course, should not be attempted by foreigners, but the problems of translation sometimes bring into evidence notional or at least verbal lacunae that require departures from common language usage. We would like to give special thanks to Annabel Sherk and Lawrence Lipson, whose help was most valuable in readying the manuscript for publication. 4. The ritual involved seven dead men: (1) Bialo, whom we had known when he was alive and who had died three years before; (2) M'batiklao, who passed away at the same time; (3) and (4) Simormora and Ayaluan, who had died six years before; (5) Aialmelewe, who had died eight years before; (6) Rabunmelmemene, who also had died eight years before; and (7) Ainabur, who had died about twenty five years before.</page><page sequence="4">8 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 Aerial view of a typical Central Malekulan traditional hamlet. (K. M?ller) body in order to drain off the fluids from the rotting flesh. The dead man remains in this place for ten days. Next, he is placed on a platform above the hearth in order to be smoked. It is only at this moment that the first phase of the ritual begins. Lying on a bamboo bier, he is carried by six male relatives to the nasara, where earlier a screen of plants has been set up transversely, masking the place as well as the facade of the nakamal. This traditional barrier is woven of creepers, crot?n leaves, and muil, and hanging on it are birds sculpted out of tree fern. Bamboos are visible overhanging this plant structure. At the far end we can see skulls and roussettes. During the night, men with painted faces, armed with bows and arrows, enter the ring and threaten those present with their weapons. The arrival of the dancers on the nasara precedes the dead man carried on his bier by the male relatives. This group circles several times around the drums that dominate the center of the place. Then the body is put down on a platform that has been placed behind the screen. It will remain there for a year. The skull will then be taken off and covered with modeling by close relatives inside the nakamal. The bones will be buried in a place to which access is forbidden to the living. During the ceremonies, yams, taros, flowers, and crot?n leaves are laid at the foot of the platform. The ceremony ends with the killing of several pigs, which are eaten by those present. Since dawn, we have observed that the people have been moving about more. Women have come to take away all the food reserves. At about ten o'clock, some men walk into our hut, admirably dressed: new penis sheaths, heads circled by a thin band of red cloth; on either side of the head, at the level of the temples, a shell surmounted by a cock's feather. Their faces are painted, but soberly. We are led along a path cut into the forest. The rolling of drums becomes more intense. We walk a good half hour. On the way we see several tree fern sculptures bordering the path and simulating, in a very realistic manner, pairs of men and women coupling: "Old fella em e stop play play long road" ("It is the old man stopping to have some fun along the way"), it is explained to us with a smile. We reach the nasara, which is still deserted. We hear some cries, pounding of feet and drums not far off. Later, at a good distance from the center of the plaza, we see some women getting up and trying out dance steps while repeating some refrains. Around midday the men, bows in hand, enter the nasara in turn. Drumming ? the drums are hidden by the surrounding vegetation ? as well as chanting accompanies these dance movements until night. In the course of the afternoon the dancers have brought yams and have piled them in a particular corner of the ground. At sunset, certain leaves and flowers are added to these. All night long the earth will resound to the untiring steps of the dancers carrying on their ceremony. At three in the morning, a sudden glare interrupts our dozing: Liklik, a torch in his hand, runs through the nasara, lighting the offerings as well as the forest, which had been previously cleared back 25 m while a palisade, the height of a man and made of reeds and dry leaves, was being erected. This is the first appearance of the rambramb mannequins and the temes nevimb?r marionettes, both of which have been hidden until now. The marionettes move about behind the screen, going back and forth, the rambramb towering above their shoulders. It is really a theater of greenery. Suddenly, torches are gone, and we are again in darkness. Dawn comes at about five o'clock. First six, then thirteen temes nevimb?r appear for the second time behind the fence and the shrubs that constituted its framework and spring up behind it like a kind of vegetational veil or curtain. Suddenly,</page><page sequence="5">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 9 General view of the dance place. On the left, the main screen separating masculine from nondetermined space. (K. M?ller) these shrubs, which have already been partially sawed off at the level of the top of the screen, are made to fall down toward us by the temes marionettes. Then the rambramb, as though freed from an obstacle, enter the plaza, mixing with the dancers, and the chief of the ritual, old Mweleun, turns and speaks to them. Approaching the screen furtively, a man shoots an arrow at one of the rambramb. Liklik goes forward onto the space that has just been cleared and receives in his arms the first rambramb, which is lifted over the vegetational screen. It is planted in the ground near the yams. All the other mannequins follow it. When the effigy of her former husband appears, a woman breaks down and cries noisily. Dancing and offerings of yams follow. The seven mannequins are now lined up on the nasara. Their heads are covered with sumptuous plant headdresses. The effigy of Anibur, who died 25 years before, carries small modeled heads on its shoulders; these heads are insignia testifying to the importance of the rank of the dead man. It is cold, and a few fires are still burning. Faces are showing signs of fatigue. But there is no respite. Opposite the raised effigies, the "chief" begins the dance again, and leashed pigs are brought onto the nasara. The place becomes animated again. The first animal is forced into the center of the place, then killed, and after it, the others. The ground is littered with the animals' bodies, and numerous dogs are licking the blood. The son of Simormora goes up to the effigy of his father and touches it with the tip of a bayonet. A pig is sacrificed to the father. Two men keep the pig still with leashes of creeper; a third looks for the best place to stab it. Then all the pigs are cut into pieces and distributed. In little groups, men and women leave the nasara to return to their villages. The rambramb remain on the nasara. Five days later they will be taken away and placed in the nakamal. Catherine Huchet was present at the same ceremony, and she gave us some notes, which she later published in the journal de la Soci?t? des Oc?anistes (Huchet 1978). Here are some excerpts from them that complement Liotard's report. The name of the ceremony is netemestamp, said to have come to an ancestor in a dream. The ceremony in part reenacts the "journey" undertaken by the mythical figure Kai lap, the first clearer of the forest (the erotic statues on the path represent his exploits). The seven rambramb represented men who had died at different times over a period of 20 years and at different ages. They belonged to a variety of grades: atemes mete (II of nimangki bwarang), namarimba (VI of nimangki nemiele), arvaru (VIII of nimangki bwarang), atemes nemiele (X or XII of nimangki nemiele), nambatru (IX of nimangki nemiele), nemewa (IV of nimangki nemiele). The ceremonial place is about 25 yds in diameter, surrounded by the forest. Seven paths lead in to it from different directions. The part to the north, towards the nakamal (which is hidden by the forest), is strictly forbidden to the women. At the edge of this same section there is a little hut, barely visible, where the rambramb and temes are deposited. There is also a shed for the men and, on the opposite side, four sheds for the women. [This seems to reproduce, on a smaller scale, the structure of a typical village.] Ilablembenpen, the man of highest rank, leads the men in a dance, and then dances alone for a long time. At the other end of the plaza, his wife leads the dance of the women. Two bundles of agricultural and fruit offerings are placed in front of each rambramb.</page><page sequence="6">10 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 In front of each offering, llablembenpen sings a strange song, which is in a "different," esoteric (or foreign?) language. It is a song to be taught only to a very few men who have made certain special payments for the right to learn it. The ceremony, normally held one year after death, is taken charge of by the father, the son, or the brother of the dead man. In this case, only two of the men had died one year earlier; the others had had to wait much longer because their descendants had lacked the means to perform it. Some of the preparations for the ceremony, like the clearing of the dancing place, were communal. Others (such as the making of the mannequins and other effigies), strictly forbidden to noninitiated men, occurred in different parts of the surrounding forest, as the shifting direction of the sound of the drums seemed to indicate.

Spaces Crossing an ocean means traveling through a space without encountering any boundaries. In a tropical forest, obstacles and barriers proliferate to such an extent that this space, too, finally becomes indistinct. And then, suddenly, as in Melanesia and the environs of the New Hebrides (Vanuatu), the uniformity of the landscape is broken by new and arbitrary barriers: clearings, villages, and gardens, inhabited and cultivated lands, begin to appear as the natural obstacles give way to traces of the human. Not that the Melanesians don't superimpose limit signs, in the form of clearly displayed boundaries, on the natural frontiers created by waterways, ravines, swamps, and lagoons, which penetrate into the interior of the land; it is well attested that many Melanesian initiatory societies, whether secret or not, mark their presence in the forest by defining discrete, specific spaces to which only they have access. This is especially so in the New Hebrides? notably among the tamate societies in all their regional forms ? from the Banks to the Motlav and as far as the extreme southernmost point of the archipelago. These clearly defined sites, though they look as if they were the work of nature, are recognizable to everyone but the ignorant ? that is, to everyone but the foreign intruders. Yet it is the inhabited clearing, the residential recess, that most strikingly reveals this tendency toward multiple partitioning, toward the proliferation of enclosures so characteristic of the Melanesian conception of the utilization of space. In the Mbogote tribe to the east of central Malekula, this tendency seems to be particularly pronounced, and it reaches an extreme in the regions farther to the south. With a series of successive partitions, the Mbogote first divide the inhabited space into two large domains, that of the men and that of the women; they then subdivide the first domain into a series of recesses that correspond either to more or less permanent sections of the masculine socius or else to certain situations ? mainly ritual ones ? in which the women are sometimes called upon to play a role. The space as a whole, therefore, is made up of a combination of fixed enclosures and variable enclosures. Comparing the description of the ritual space provided by recent documents with older, general ethnographic information found in the works of Deacon (1936) and Layard (1942), we can attempt to visualize the major distinction between the men's space, which is for the</page><page sequence="7">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 11 most part a uniform space within the residential unit (in the sense that it is almost exclusively inhabited by men), and that other space to which both sexes have access, a space for encounter and transit that, rather than as a women's space, can be more appropriately called neutral, as the development of the funeral procedures indicates. It is during times of mourning that this dichotomy and the strict laws that govern it are particularly evident and even magnified, especially in the first phases when men and women, relatives of the dead person, keep watch over the body until it rots at the family house, located within this area that we have called neutral. This first work of mourning, whose purpose one could describe as "making the body ripen," this twofold promiscuity ? between the sexes and between the corpse and the mourners ? differs singularly from other Melanesian funeral practices in neighboring archipelagos and seems to resemble more those of the western regions, the Massim, New Guinea, and all the way to Indonesia. In certain respects, in fact, the New Hebridean situation corresponds to the one described in R. Hertz's celebrated essay on the double funeral, because the work of mourning in Malekula (these practices extend throughout the island) ? at least during the phase following immediately upon death ? seems to contradict the ideology of masculine exclusivity and spatial separation of the sexes that is elsewhere so rigorously maintained. Except for the menstrual recesses and the neighboring gardens, then, there is no real, distinct feminine space in Malekula. Apparently, there is only a nonmasculine space, a space that, not being permanently articulated into an internal order of its own (as is the case, for example, in several Polynesian regions), can be considered truly amorphous. This is a singular and interesting inductive definition of what we have called the "neutral," that is, the nonprohibited. It can be suspected, but this must remain for the moment highly hypothetical, that the uniqueness of the exclusive feminine space (where the dangerous menstrual cycle is confined) on the one hand and male-female promiscuity during the beginnings of mourning on the other may stem from one symbolic matrix that exploits the contiguity of states. So the women, who normally inhabit, as we have seen, a neutral and amorphous space, will retreat into seclusion when affilicted by menstruation (a sort of "rotting" of their bodies?), whereas the men, who are normally secluded most of the time in their own distinct and compartmentalized space, will come to "promiscuous" dwellings when called to witness the rotting of the body of one of theirs (of a part of their collective masculine body?). This may be graphically represented: Everyday life / Mourning Men / / promiscuity segregation / - / hyper-segregation Women / / menses Such a paradigm would be a valid description of a cluster of symbolic reverberations even if an explicit equation between the states of mourning and of menstruation cannot otherwise be attested: it would be sufficient to establish that in this society in which woman-contact is basically polluting for man and hence segregation is normal, there are situations and conditions in which segregation is temporarily either totally abolished or reaffirmed in the extreme (segregation of women also from other women, which is almost a kind of compartmentalization), and that this significantly occurs always in connection with biologically transitional states, which all have to do with body dissolution of one kind or another (in these cases, the loss of body liquids, of vital juices) and possibly with nongeneration (the interruption, temporary or final, of the generative powers). We shall not further investigate here the possible meaning and implications of such hypothetical symbolic connections. We should note, however, that as the menses lead to a new fertile period, so death in these cultures, through the medium of totemic identification and ancestral reincarnation, is closely connected to the powers of generation. The new penis sheath donned by the cadaver is an indication of the entering of the dead one into this new generative realm. In the "northern half" of the maisave (Deacon uses this term to designate both the dance place and the barrier dividing it into a masculine space and an undifferentiated space), especially in the southern parts of the island, differentiation of distinct areas is the norm: these are the dance area where the drums stand; a section of forest between the latter and the men's house; the men's house (nakamal); and the clearing between the men's house and the forest (the "background," called nimbimlemwenei). Since it is the</page><page sequence="8">12 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 Enclosures. Northwest Malekula. Mus?e de l'Homme, Paris (E-39-1473-1). (Van den Broeck) dominant space (in a way the center), the men's house is the enclosure of enclosures, and by being isolated from the rest and subdivided inside, it is in itself the embodiment of this partitioning of space. In the nakamal, the system of grades (nimanggi or nimangki, or else tamate according to the region and in some cases according to their relative importance) is reflected in an internal partitioning wherein each grade has its distinct and exclusive haven, its fixed recess. This compartmentalization of males does not appear to have an equivalent elsewhere in Melanesia, just as the institution of grades belongs properly to the New Hebridean culture area (to the north of Epi), all the way to the Banks and including the Torres.5 Related to this obsession with quartering (this partitioning and secluding in which all the men must be situated during their lives and even after their deaths) is a fundamentally progress!ve and hierarchical character of the system, in life as in death. Movement through the grades is a stepping towards death ? only in death, in fact, do the grades become fixed. And so death, as giver of the final identity and motor of the process by which it is acquired, constitutes in every way the nucleus of a dialectic that we could define as an all pervasive thanatology. It is as if the over-determination of the physical and social space (this space made up of superimposed grids, of spatial discontinuities) were necessary to the flourishing of this idea of ontological evolution (the human realizes itself through a progression that finds its crystallization beyond death), which is experienced as a progress through barriers. This notion manifests itself variously in the ritual that interests us here, notably in the crucial moment when the dead man, appearing as a visible ghost ? the mannequin or rambramb ? and helped by the "great ancestors," or temes nevimb?r (puppets), must surmount and pass beyond the fence that separates him from the dance place. 2. Sites The nakamal is not only where the separate hearths of the grades into which men are divided are housed; it also contains the community's ossuary. The skulls that will eventually top the rambramb are taken in charge by men of the same grade as the dead. The bones, and at a later time the skulls themselves, are gathered in a communal ditch in the middle of the men's house.6 This is invariably present in the southern groups Deacon talks about, but it also occurs in the northern regions. In the end, time obliterates the difference created by the grades that have ordered the men's lives and have continued to encase them through the long funerary cycle. So, gradually the dead come to form a body of anonymous ancestry that is perceived as a guarantee of fertility, since it is from this ossuary that the agrarian cults start. Growth, therefore, seems to depend on something more stringent than a cycle: it is 5. We will later attempt to define and discuss the originality of this New Hebridean institution, unique perhaps in all of Melanesia and clearly distinct from the age group systems, for example, found in several regions of New Guinea. Suffice it to say, at this point, that the grades constitute a ladder of initiatory classes or groups to which the men gain access in the course of their lives. In the southeast regions studied by Deacon there also exist distinct feminine grades. But if we are to follow Deacon, the situation appears astonishingly complex, even contradictory in several respects, and it is not clear if or how this feminine hierarchy relates to the organization of the "neutral" space where women dwell. 6. Sometimes, too, the nembrken, or nembrmbrkon (cf. Deacon 1934b:518, 543), is outside the nakamal, usually in the back of it. The resemblance between this place and the back of the pyramid in the Tahitian marae, a space very much laden with taboos, is worth mentioning, if only in passing, for it raises the question of the relation between the Polynesian and Melanesian sites (the two seem to have been excessively and arbitrarily differentiated in Oceanist literature).</page><page sequence="9">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 13 a loop in which death "feeds" life. Here, ontological causality is, in fact, grounded in death; we shall come back to this aspect elsewhere. For the moment we should note that in Malekula, as in most of Melanesia, a village does not last very long7 ? for ideological as much as for ecological reasons: not only does the usable land become exhausted, but the ancestors, punishing the living for some transgression, often force them to leave their dwelling place. The men's house, and possibly the remains within it, will have to follow suit. At the mercy of chance migrations, the villages and the ossuaries, with their lack of any relation to a fixed point, are presences with the character of apparitions. The nakamal, then, is a site, but a transient one. What is a Melanesian site? In the nearby Solomon Islands, as in distant New Guinea, it is more than just the location of the funerary cults: it is also and most importantly the spacial reference point in relation to which the group defines its location and the range of its agriculture. It is the never- or seldom-shifting center that gives legitimacy to the residential and agricultural occupation of land. The length of time the residential areas last, as well as their history (so far as we can assess), always depends on the varying permanence of the site. Everything to do with the men's lives is justified by this bond, this invisible and constant bond, with the site. To understand this principle we must therefore recognize that there are two kinds of surfaces to be considered. One is fixed, and that is the land of the dead; the other is mobile, but always gravitating within the orbit of the first, and that is the land of the living. If one site can generate others, this segmentation is ruled by a genealogical guarantee that recreates the original orbit either inside or outside the first. The fixity of the site gives direction (and meaning) to the mobility of the group: it provides it with a frame. Noteworthy ? and crucial to any anthropological reading of the Melanesian socius ? is the fact that the social legitimacy of the groups is to be sought in this relationship between space and society, where spatial reference subsumes genealogical reference while entering into dialectical relation with it (Guidieri 1980). In Malekula, this order seems to have changed radically: here there is no fixed cultic and spatial reference point that is beyond the residential units and independent of them. Here the ossuary-site is within the male enclosure (near or inside the nakamal), and the solidarity between the dead and the living manifests itself in the constantly renewed cohabitation within the nakamal, of which the funerary rites are one of the principal expressions. We would venture to say, then, that the site is the men's house, and the men's house is a site. The fact that two functions ? residential and funerary ? coincide in one place generates the Malekulian liturgical modalities, in which the ephemeral clearings of the villages and the lands that surround them are perpetually haunted by a crowd of ancestral presences. Rising up before the ossuaries as they slip into oblivion and anonymity are the unevenly lasting ?mages of the dead: standing stones, effigies, and drums. 3. Memory In Malekula, as in the rest of Melanesia, genealogy is one of the main criteria for defining a group. If the terminology of kinship allows for a definition of the ties and exchanges among the group's living members (terms of naming and address represent relationships that are real in that they are synchronie), genealogy legitimizes the group's land rights by virtue of the group's memory of its own past. The present is a series of encounters and confrontations; the past is a chain of Names and Places. Men's communal house (nakamal or ame/). Big Namba (village of Mraway).

Peabody Museum Archives, #23259. (K. M?ller) Yet although this "ancestral memory" is mandatory and widespread, it is also quite short-lived in almost all of Melanesia. The ancestors matter, but they are fairly rapidly forgotten, at least as individual identities. Compared with the endless Polynesian genealogies, the genealogical segments of Melanesia are family portraits that quickly fade with the passing of time. They feed on a contradictory memory: one that obliterates even as it preserves. It is a memory of which amnesia is the necessary and paradoxical complement. But this amnesia is just as normative as the memory to which it corresponds. One must know how to remember as one continues to forget, and one must know how to forget. The cult of the dead, then, a cult that "creates" ancestors and in so doing establishes a memory, seems to contradict this breaking of ancestral continuity. The work of mourning builds up chains of memory that have the deceptive appearance of duration. For if, on the one hand, to turn a dead man into an ancestor is to make him someone to be remembered, it is also clear that in Melanesia people do not want to remember too long.8 The fact that systematic amnesia does not erase the value of the genealogical principle is evidenced by the existence of the Great Ancestors, who represent the anthropomorphic ? or, in this case at least, nontotemic ? origin of each group. But though their names may be indelible, all the genealogical links that connect these Great Ancestors, generation upon generation, to the living as well as to the recent dead of the group are blotted out. Here is yet another paradox. The principle of filiation governing the postulated relationships between the distant ancestor and the short lineage of the living is negated by this great empty genealogical gap between the two periods ? the only periods retained in the history of the group ? its origin and its recent descendance. In its spatial expression, the lack of depth corresponds to the relatively ephemeral nature of the Melanesian site. Why, in fact, would one cling to the reliquaries of dead men who have been forgotten? Why this pretense that at once proclaims the eternal and reveals the precariousness that lies in the heart of the eternal? What metaphysical necessity (and here the term is appropriate) has dictated that this memory wear itself away in everyday life, in the promiscuity between what once existed and is now only a remnant ? the 8. The exception is the case of Malaita, in the Solomon Islands, northeast of the New Hebrides. Here we find long genealogical memories and an organization of space based on strikingly ancient sites (Guidieri 1975, 1980). We cannot simply attribute this to the influence of nearby Polynesia, since in neighboring Tikopia, whose characteristics are entirely Polynesian, the genealogical depth of the four main clans is not as great as that prevailing in Malaita.</page><page sequence="11">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 15 bone ? and that which depends on this relic ? the living? It seems to us that these questions should be central to all Melanesian ethnology. In Malekula, this relationship between forgetting the dead and abandoning the sites takes a very peculiar turn because of the nature and location of the site itself. Here the precariousness of the ossuary-site, because it lies in the center of the men's house, derives as much from the shifting character of the residential unit as from genealogical amnesia.9 It is in fact the rhythm of "residential nomadism" that, in the overlapping of two ephemeral references, determines where and when new sites are created, while the gradual forgetting of the names of ancestors helps erase the memory of previous sites. What is the meaning, then, of the profusion of images that haunt the forests and villages, the paths and clearings of Malekula? What are these anthropomorphic drums ? voices of the dead ? that stand on the dance place, these sculpted tree ferns, these standing stones ? monoliths whose volume and weight are accentuated by the thicket of plants that surround them ? and even these masks and these funerary mannequins and marionettes? As a counterpart of transient genealogical memory, and in contrast to it, these innumerable representations of the dead, spots of color on a gray background, would seem to represent ? and this especially in the southern half of Malekula and, with spectacular crescendo, on the southeast coast studied by Deacon ? the emanations of a cult of the dead resting on an indestructible ancestral memory. Actually, as we have seen, this in not at all the case. In other parts of the world, remembrance of the dead can take the form of the building of monuments, or of putting up a string of funerary niches alongside a road, as on the Via Appia in Rome or on the roads leading to certain Corsican villages. But whereas in cases such as those, we are talking about tombs ? tabernacles that bear witness to the permanence of the name as much as to the ineffaceable presence of the dead ? the will to remember in Malekula assigns only episodic value to sculptural images. It quickly turns them into mere vestiges that seem to exist only as indeterminate evocations. It would appear that the New Hebridean memory keeps negating itself; it "remember(s) much forgetting," as the poet said; it exerts itself tirelessly to wipe out the traces that could form its strongest support. In more than one sense, then, once again, this is a memory that recalls and represents, only the better to forget. 4. Grades Only in the Banks, Motlav, and the New Hebrides as far north as Epi does Melanesian society segment the course of an individual's life through a system of progressive statuses whose hierarchic ranking is expressed in parallel ladders of masculine organization ? in Malekula, these are the nimangki on the one hand and the nalawan on the other ? through which the society's entire ritual life is organized.10 Even though we have a great deal of information from Deacon (1934), Layard (1942), and Guiart (1952), it is not possible to define precisely these societies' structures and functioning, or their reciprocal relationships. Yet from these descriptions ? at once rich, incomplete, and contradictory ? some general configurations of New Hebridean social organization do emerge that are particularly significant for understanding its cults of the dead. In the context of the cultural forms assumed in the South Sea Islands by the eternal dilemma of structure and event ? or, in political terms, of hierarchy and competition ? the Hebridean ranking system represents an unusual solution. The case of the New Hebrides falls somewhere between the rest of Melanesia, where the short-lived burst of individual competition, of charismatic leadership, seems to prevail, and Polynesia, where we see at work some of the most elaborate forms of the hierarchic principle, where power is invariably invested in ? and therefore 9. As we said earlier, the most widespread solution in Melanesia (but one that does not really solve the problem) consists of severing the residential site, the house of the men, from the funeral site. The advantage for the memory of land-tenure rights is evident. The site remains, in spite of the migrations. It is still true that the link between the group-that-nomadizes and its original site poses considerable problems that the chronic land conflicts reveal as very difficult to solve. Applying a well-known formula that L?vi-Strauss (1949) proposed for the so-called elementary kinship structures, we could say that where the fundamental legitimacy of the groups is concerned, the Melanesian modality is discordant, since the relationship between residence and funeral site only appears coherent over relatively short genealogical periods (usually two to three generations). 10. This dualism, in the Banks, is expressed by the opposition between the sukwe and tamate societies. Both the tamate and the nalawan clearly seem to emphasize their secrecy. Yet to suggest, as have certain authors, that the nimangki and sukwe societies are "public," as though they consisted merely of some commonplace transaction of goods, would be to deny them that originality of form whose discussion is one of the main themes of this essay. More on this below.</page><page sequence="12">16 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 locked into ? an inherited social rank or title11 (sometimes the two can be separated). In the New Hebrides, the individual sees his competitive drive impeded and compartmentalized into ranks (sukwe, nimangki; tamate, nalawan) that are at once the hic et nunc condition of his status and the only possible course for his progress (this possible ascension does not allow him to transmit the power and the privileges he has thus acquired to his descendants). The cultures of the New Hebrides designate the male individual as he who can use the ranking system and advance within it as far as his ambition and individual capacities can take him. But the gradual ascension of this upwards path, while satisfying the personal ambitions of the candidate, forgoes the mixture of utopia and pragmatism, as well as the swiftness, that forms the great lever of the "big man," who, through a plethora of very material promises, actually offers his supporters only tokens without proportion or relation to his own gain. In the system that concerns us here, promotion is in fact a form of cooptation, and the acquisition of the status represented by a certain rank does not result in distinguishing the elected from those who accept him; on the contrary, it assimilates him with them. What is involved here, it seems to us, is mainly an initiatory, hence esoteric, right of entry into a corporation. The members of the rank are the exclusive beneficiaries of a secret knowledge and praxis (as we have seen, it hardly matters if these acquisitions are pragmatically "useless") determined ab principio by tradition. Thus, in the same way that in the men's house the grid of the nimangki covers all the inhabited space (except for the space of the communal ossuary), the ranking system, which is coextensive with the masculine socius, implies that one cannot leave a rank except in order to climb into another. This machine does not allow for any return. A New Hebridean man's belonging to the status relative to a rank is marked either by progression or by immobility, never by forfeiture. It is a situation radically different from that of the (very resistible) ascent and always impending fall of individuals in the rest of Melanesia. The rule implicit in the entire hierarchy of ranks is the nonreversibility of achievement. Can one imagine a principle farther removed from that which feeds the fireworks of the Melanesian "big man"? The chieftainries that at the northwestern end of Malekula overlap with the organization of ranks affect the structure of these in revealing ways. It is as though the contradictions that they introduce into the system further clarified the principles on which it is founded. This case is unique in the entire island, and these chieftainries can only be likened to those in the south of the archipelago, although there this institution completely "replaces," so to speak, the ranking system, which is noticeably absent. It appears that the hereditary authority in the north of Malekula introduces a structural gulf between the lower ranks, which are open to everyone and entered into by the same procedures applied elsewhere on the island, and a small group of higher ranks that are the exclusive prerogative of members of the lineages through which the highest authority is transmitted.12 But the hierarchic ranking principle is not, for all that, contradicted by the withdrawal of the higher ranks from the workings of the general progression. What the chieftainry contributes, then, is a sort of splitting of the system, so that one progression is divided into two superimposed progressions: that of the common people, and that of the "chiefs." In both, individual promotion is still a cooptation, an assimilation into a corporate group. But the gulf between the two promotional series establishes an imbalance, because if the progression of the lower ranks ends in an impasse, a sort of institutionalized incompleteness, the progression within the dominant ranks, on the contrary, closes the system, since it results in the emergence and maintenance of the chief's authority. This division introduced by the chieftainry seems to imply an additional distortion of the rank structure (see Guiart 1952). It turns out, in fact, that the chieftainry encountered in the north of Malekula is not ritually autonomous. Its liturgy always calls on someone outside the chieftainry itself: The chief, according to Guiart, can only fulfill his ceremonial function, which is also necessarily that of sanctioning all passages from rank to rank, by having a "foreign" partner of his own rank facing him. The chiefs perform ceremonially in pairs, and apparently this complementarity is so imperative that in the north of the island one can truly 11. This type of organization is found as far west as the neighboring Melanesian archipelago of New Caledonia. Recent research, though not infirming substantially our assessment of traditional Hebridean forms of authority, would make us qualify our generalizations as to its intermediate position between Melanesian and Polynesian types. (Articles in Allen 1981 may help to clarify some of these questions; we were unable to consult it before completion of this study.) 1 2. Given what we know (and that is very little) about the connections between the nimangki ranks ("exoteric") and the nalawan ranks ("esoteric," and certainly secret, as the literature tells us), we can still exclude any claims that the privilege of ascending to the latter, being more selective, introduces a hierarchical dichotomy into the general progression of ranks.</page><page sequence="13">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 17 say that there is a unique ceremonial dualism. If one examines the way this dualism operates on the aggregate of communities, a rather surprising aspect of it emerges: it creates an implicit tripartition. Three orders of relationships, in fact, are involved every time a man steps up to a new rank in this part of the island. Besides the relationship of the group of the rank to the group of the candidate to the rank ? a relationship that obtains throughout the rest of Malekula ? there is the prescribed presence of the chief, who is the only one able to take the initiative and decide about the attaining of a rank (ibid.). As we have noted, the inclusion of this external element (in terms of the pure grade system) is doubled by the function of the "invited" chief, for whom "large-scale ceremonial offerings are meant" (ibid.). Finally, within the community itself, in northern Malekula, there is a third element, which is the category "of circumcisers, sculptors, and victims . . . who become objects of exchange, offered up in order to buy peace from the traditional enemy, which is also the ceremonial partner" (ibid.).13 It must be immediately emphasized that this tripartition is implicit, whereas the dualism is not. The reciprocity and complementarity between two elements is in fact embedded in the institution of the chieftainry, in the bipartition of the system of ranks, and in the gulf separating those who can aspire to the higher ranks from those to whom accession is forbidden. The ceremonial dualism of the chieftainry dominates ideologically the other dualities that we have just described. Now, in all these cases the third element constitutes the condition under which these complementarities can be ? or can become ? functional. With some degree of precision we could say that if the dualism is fundamentally normative, the tripartition is structurally functional. The best way to describe this third element is by comparing the various systems that coexist-in Malekula. In fact, where there is no chieftainry, the normative dualism is also a functional dualism to the point where every attainment of rank could be described as a binary exchange. Inversely, in the north the mechanism of the ranks becomes a game for three players by means of which this same exchange is at once subdivided and controlled. It is precisely this division and this limiting that are absent from the system of ranks as we find it in the funerary ritual that involves the appearance of funerary mannequins. If within the chieftainry the institutionalized incompleteness of the lower ranks corresponds to an authority, embodied by a man, that dominates and protects them, in the south-central and southern communities that have no chieftainry, the range of the ranking system includes an authority figure whose specific attribute, we could say, is immobility. Deacon tells us that the highest rank of the scale promotes whoever attains it to the level of being a "living dead." The man who reaches this level is said "to be dead." This means that even though he is still alive, he has in some sense attained the condition of ancestor. Whereas the chief, born into the possibility of becoming a chief, only climbs the ladder of ranks in order to realize the power with which he is already potentially invested, a power that he will exercise actively in all the essential functions of the society, the "living dead man" of central and southern Malekula reaches his ultimate status through a transformation that separates him from the society of the living and invests him with a passive authority, one that is "hollow" because it is marked by this separation. If one considers this system as a whole, then, another kind of duality emerges, that between the highest rank ? the living dead man ? and all the others, because, as noted above, the living dead man, while at the top of a homogeneous progression of ranks, is also, as a living ancestor, truly outside it, and the system, built around this duality between him and "the ranks," is, so to speak, closed from the outside. ? living-dead-one Z-\ grades / \ 13. We would like to know more about the characteristics of the "chieftainry." Clearly, Guiart is viewing these functions in an essentially political light (regarding the exercise of authority as worldly, secular leadership within activities that are fundamentally, if not exclusively, transactional). Since these same transactions are generally called "ceremonial," which means in this case nonsecular, this "politicization" of authority only simplifies (or should we say Westernizes?) its nature and thus, also, its function. The question we intend to raise here, however pertinent it may be to the case of Malekula, goes beyond it to embrace the interpretation of other Melanesian cultures, that of the Trobriands in particular. What should be truly clarified is the nature of authority in these societies, be it hereditary ? that is, structural, as in the exceptional case we are considering at present ? or "elective." We suspect, and hope to bring some proof of it in the following (see, for instance, Secret, below), that archaic authority amounts to something more than, or perhaps rather something different from, mere secular management and the fruition of privileges.</page><page sequence="14">18 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 We shall return later to the nature of this "outside" from which the living ancestor, like a silent puppeteer, holds the threads that connect the living and the dead. For the moment our question is: should the absence of funerary mannequins in the northern regions (already noted by Deacon and Layard in their classifications of Malekulan cultures) be associated with the presence of the chieftainry and thus also with the subdivision of the ranks into two groups and the implicit tripartition that operates within them? The hypothesis seems plausible. The ranking system, which we have described as progressive, has another general peculiarity: it allows and even provides for shortcuts up the ladder. It has been reported many times that the progression is not necessarily gradual and linear. An individual can skip certain ranks and accelerate his climb through the grades. This indicates that the principle of progression, which remains explicitly unchangeable, is still governed by a nonuniform rhythm. How does an individual make these shortcuts? In general, neither charisma nor the advantages he gains from his birth or his circumstances are enough. The only effective way is through coopting. As a result, and in full accordance with the fundamental rule operating in all varieties of the system, the very nature of the operation called "taking rank" presupposes that the accession is always assured by a correspondent: someone who initiates, who can welcome the candidate, someone who is already in the rank awaiting him. Nonuniform progression therefore implies, and this is the point we want to make, that the main goal, what we will call the transmission of the knowledge that lifts the veil from what is hidden, is assured even without uniform promotion through the ranks.14 Available information does not permit us to go very far in a comparative analysis of any aspect of Malekulan grade organizations, and particularly not any aspects concerning their relation to the institution of chieftainry, where this occurs. One significant point of difference, however, between the chiefless nimangki systems of the south and those in the north should at least be mentioned: while the southern living-dead-one is, as we have seen, the passive, Unmoved Mover by whose existence every grade acquisition, any ascension in rank, is sanctioned and even in some way caused, the northern chief, this most living of the living, cannot be said to have, by himself (and with his nobles), an analogous role, despite the fact that he must preside over any grade-taking ceremony. The chief, unlike the living-dead-one, does not seem to be the carrier of an autonomous, transcendentally guaranteed authority. In order to sanction grade passages, he needs the intervention, the presence, of a foreign chief with his entourage.15 This exigency remains rather mysterious: it may help to explain it, though, to remember that in these groups the chief and the higher grades are separated by an inheritance barrier from the lower grades. Hierarchy is then not only graduated, but also discontinuous; there is an unbridgeable gulf between high and low, which is unheard of in the groups "headed" by the living-dead-one. What seems to be common to the two systems is the necessity for the dead living-dead-one iving-dead-one grades 14. To pay for the secret = to pay for accession to the rank = to pay the correspondent: this is attested in the dynamics of the system. See, for example, how large monetary offerings (the curved tusks of the boar), and also the offerings of food, can become in the examples given in the ethnographic literature. To ask why one pays is the same as asking why one wants to change rank, to see in payment the expression of a desire to change: this, ironically (and involuntarily), is what deontology and psychoanalytic theory suggest to us as an explanation. 15. To appreciate the departure of this kind of foreign participation from central and southern Malekulan practice, it is enough to remember that in these regions extratribal male observers of grade ceremonies are treated like women spectators (Deacon 1934b: 11 ). (We shall later examine the nature and importance of this spectator role of the women.)</page><page sequence="15">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 19 chief lower grades foreign chief I_'_I lower grades authority principle that guarantees order (hence, particularly those changes that make the order function, that is, that keep it alive) to be founded in an "Outside," in a mirrored reality that becomes the source of its transcendental and ontological validation. What then is the difference? We could say, perhaps, vertically vs. horizontally; otherworldly vs. mundane, imminent transcendence; images and shadows vs. neighbors. This last opposition points to the fact that we do not find in the chieftainries the proliferation of ?mages that accompany, like a ghostly chorus of doubles, the individual's progress through the grades up to the condition of living-dead-one. It is also quite interesting that an aristocratic system need find abroad the sanction of its authority (it reminds us in some way of the supranationality of European feudal society). Comparison of the two systems seems to reveal a dynamic, centered around the nature of transcendence and of authoritative action, that is not without its paradoxes: while the living-dead-one is in principle not removed from the lower ranks (anybody, in theory, can become a living-dead-one), his intervention in grade acquisition is mainly a passive one, whereas while the level of chieftainry is unattainable for the lower ranks, the not "noble," the chief, actively promotes and validates any grade accession. He must do so, however, with the aid of a partner of his own rank. Such a partner, by definition, can only be an outsider (think of the marriages of our kings of old). It seems, then, very likely (but it should be confirmed by field data perhaps now impossible to obtain) that in the northern chieftainries the cult of the dead has diminished in importance as a forming image and a transcendental reference for the grade system. A final observation on this tentative description: where it is the chief that sanctions, cooption into the grades becomes something closer to promotion. Payment for admission takes on a different meaning where the receiver is not the whole coopting group. We are almost tempted to see here, perhaps ethnocentrically, the root of a certain form of corruption, if indeed relationships of dependence become less communal and more personal; but we can't be sure. 5. Two initiations In order to define the originality of the New Hebridean institution of ranking more clearly, we will compare it with certain ritual practices in other Melanesian cultures. So that the contrasts will stand out as distinctly as possible, we will leave out of the comparison the example of New Caledonia (which is in several ways similar to cult forms encountered in the direction of the central Pacific, south of the Fiji Islands), as well as the groups of cultures located mainly in the southeastern and northeastern areas of New Guinea (the Marind-Amin and Melpa groups, and the cultures of the upper and lower Sepik). In this reduced area ? which is actually very diversified when approached with other comparative parameters ? we are postulating two main cult models for initiatory forms. The first would extend to the entire northern part of Melanesia (i.e., the coastal and swamp areas of New Guinea ? from the gulf of Huan and the northern coast around the Sepik estuary; the group of the Massim and the Entrecasteaux; the coastal areas of New Ireland and New Brittany; and the Solomon</page><page sequence="16">20 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 Islands). The second model would include the area of Motlav, the Banks, the Torres, and the northern and central group of the New Hebrides ? this restriction of the New Hebrides excludes Efate, Tanna, and Erromango. What we are looking at are primarily the forms of initiatory organization present in each area and the position of the cult of the dead within these same organizations. What is interesting, what is worth examining here, involves both the scale of these initiatory organizations, which provide for a progressive and articulated cycle of ritual phases, and the function, either central or final, depending on the case, attributed in them to the cult of the dead. The first model includes initiatory organizations that seem to lack the very elaborate formalism of the grade system. In spite of the variations we encounter, their formal structure remains surprisingly similar: the initiation rites always appear circumstantial, that is, demarcated in time. Properly speaking, these are rites of passage in the sense intended by Van Gennep. We will call this kind of organization a punctual initiatory organization. The function of these rites seems to be to propel the initiate towards the acquisition of a status (whatever the esoteric or sociological justifications given for it), a status deemed necessary, but only in certain circumstances, at crucial points in his life: mainly at birth and at puberty. Rites of initiation, rites of passage in the classical sense, they sanction a change that, before it is recognized socially, is determined by irreducible biological imperatives. The periods separating these normative initiatory sequences, the "inter-rites" we could call them, the transition phases which V. Turner (after Van Gennep) devoted himself to studying, are usually quite long. The change that comes with the rite immediately stabilizes it, and it is made to last. Now in these societies the cult of the dead ? a central ritual activity for all Melanesian cultures ? has some peculiar traits. The entity represented by the dead-ancestor appears in fact as a sort of fixed noumenon, because its permanence beyond death is said to be inalterable. But the position of the ancestor with regard to the community appears to be decentered. In effect, it is a presence inscribed in a given space, situated generally outside the community. The place where the remains of the dead rest, the site, is eccentric in relation to the social unit that depends on it. What is more, these same cultures believe that the intervention of the dead, their action on the living, is always exercised "from afar" and always through intermediaries, officers of the cult, who are close to the dead and capable of communicating with them. Finally, the ancestors themselves are considered to be the "product" of a process that invests certain men at their death; from the decentered place they occupy afterwards, they are thought to conduct and control the punctual initiatory sequences that we have mentioned. In the second model, the initiation ? the transition from one state to another? is a cultic reiteration that extends over the span of a man's life and gives it its rhythm. We might even say that these social organizations are, as a whole, truly inclusive initiatory organizations, since the initiatory ladder itself is what organizes the social order, its morphology, from bottom to top, over the entire existential duration of its members and partly beyond. Thus, each time a man who belongs to one of these cultures and who is striving to proceed through the sequence penetrates into a new grade, he is, in some sense, reenacting the whole range of social life. Parallel to this initiatory form, in the case of the New Hebrides, the cult of the dead seems displaced by comparison with its position in the first model. Here, as we have seen, death is an ephemeral entity, since it is irremediably worn away by institutional amnesia, that is, by a strategic modality of memory; but it also becomes more directly "active" than elsewhere in social life, not only insofar as it makes its appearance in the cult of the dead ? especially in Malekula ? in the form of a figure, a ghostly presence, the rambramb mannequin, but also, as we shall see, because it is in reference to dead ones, and only so, that access to grades can be granted. Alongside this, we have seen a unique role emerging: that of the "living dead man," the man who stands at the top of the ladder of grades and because of that is close to the truly-dead (and identified by the others with the truly-dead). Death, whether as apparition or condition, is within the system of the living. One could say of the New Hebridean ranks ? and therefore also of the initiatory model they refer to ? that they represent a gradual initiation into death; whereas in the other model/death is removed, and because of this, although it certainly acts on the community of the living, it acts from a distance, like a true teleological principle. Here the spiral that at every stage connects the dead with the living is mirrored by the role of the representations of the dead people, the incredible variety of effigies (we shall come back to this variety farther on), which only accentuates this thanatological structuring of life: for, as men gradually initiate themselves into death through the stages of the ranks, they also must add to the presence of the dead people</page><page sequence="17">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 21 among the living by setting up effigies. Each stage is thus symbolized in the object-representing-the-dead man; and each stage affects the living man who attains it just as much as it affects the representation of the dead man that awaits him. To recapitulate: In the first model the punctual initiatory phases are ordered around two conditions: the biological events (birth, puberty) and the ancestry (which "runs them" from afar). There, ritualization is a way of acting within a natural process ? and only in reference to it. One aim is to absorb the event (the biological change). In this way the ritual sanctions an event that opens on the many existential possibilities of the "interlude-times," the nonritualized times, which are long. This continues to the moment of death, which opens on the one truly "long time," as conceived by these cultures. According to the second model, the one that concerns us here, the ritual produces the event. There is therefore no need to absorb it. Compared with the first model, this one seems to us in some sense "more true" because it is more exhaustive, for here the ritual successfully attempts to define and determine in an integral way all the prerogatives of the social being up to its fullest manifestation, the highest rung of the ladder ? that is, to say it once again, in it the social process as a whole is compressed and reflected. 6. Secret Ever since Deacon attempted the first description nearly 50 years ago, the extent of the goods offered at the assumption of a new grade has often been emphasized: the number of pigs sacrificed and eaten, the value of the animals measured by the size of their curved tusks, the quantity of tubers distributed during a ceremony, the large "monetary offerings," and, more recently, even the circulation of Western money. No one can deny the grade system a conspicuous ? and quite explicit ? economic function that involves both the previous accumulation of the necessary goods (that is, the many direct and indirect transactions in loans and repayments that make this accumulation possible) and their distribution ? ostentatious, public ? at the time of the ceremonies. Likewise, the assumption of rank is only possible if these economic transactions are guaranteed beforehand and if the participants (initiates, initiators) prove that they are suitable to be either remunerators or beneficiaries. Thus, many phases of the cult and several clearly economic aspects of the ceremonies can be broken down into a detailed spectrum of economically measurable acts so as to establish an account of the goods and productive powers employed in the ritual. Too often, unfortunately, such undertakings do not limit themselves to an attempt to determine the impressively vast economic import of ritual behaviors; they also, by so doing, pretend to define the rituals' nature and character: an all embodying extension of the economic parameters that seems not only excessive but arbitrary. This kind of interpretation necessarily ignores many of the characteristic aspects of the event that is the occasion for these transactions ? in fact, all those that are difficult or impossible to measure. If we want to look at what actually takes place in these rituals, to reach some understanding of the event itself, we must free ourselves of this bias. Because in adopting this procedure, this attempt to "quantify" the ritual, there is a danger of nullifying the very specificity of the institutions on which the event depends and that one is trying to understand. As it happens, these institutions are in fact negated; because what makes them different from other institutions that have similar economic dimensions? in other words most of the Melanesian transactional forms ? no longer carries any meaning. Large-scale ceremonial transactions (kula, moka, to name only the best-known) certainly form the most conspicuous characteristic of Melanesian cultures. And the New Hebridean grade system is also a transactional form. But this system, as we have seen, really belongs only to the area of the Banks-Motlav-New Hebrides and not to all of Melanesia. In this case, as in others, we must insist on the fact that the character of necessity of the economic factor (which, in Melanesia, takes the form of this transactional imperative, so well described by Mauss) is in no way homologous to that which specifically characterizes any given institution (in our case, for instance, its initiatory nature); it is in the divergence between what is dominant and what is recognized as being determinant that the cultural definition and justification of an institution can be grounded.16 16. For example, the Melanesian societies' mode of production (in the Marxian sense of the term) is the same everywhere even though their ecosystems present slight variations (the largest being the difference between the coast and the interior within one island, and between the coral surfaces and the volcanic surfaces within a group of islands). The production techniques (agricultural technology and the rotation of lands, the sexual division of work, the breeding and fishing techniques) that make this mode of production possible and relatively harmonious accentuate its sameness ? an established fact, obvious to any observer. But this same area covers a mosaic of several hundred cultures, and a remarkable variety of institutions. Economic reductionism (there are other kinds, too) results from a scientistic desire to uniformize that ends up negating the very</page><page sequence="18">22 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 For us, the originality of this New Hebridean institution lies in its fundamentally initiatory nature, as Rivers, Speiser, Deacon, and Layard had already surmised. The major principle, the rule on which the entire system is based, appears to be this: that there is a secret ? a thing, an entity, a discourse (song, myth, phrase) ? that is preserved, prohibited, concealed ? just as much as it is transmitted. Taking as a special example the context that interests us here, what would define, what can represent, a secret, or what can assume the aspect of a secret? To seize its character it doesn't seem necessary to know the concrete content, to determine factually what it can be and what it is not. Everything can be a secret, because everything can be concealed and prohibited. The range of possibilities is infinite. What counts is the principle by which a thing is called "secret." The New Hebridean documents clearly show that the secret hidden in each level of the ladder of grades is, quite simply, that-which-is-coveted; its appropriation derives from wanting to know what is given as hidden. A man accedes to a grade; he has been promoted, and henceforth he belongs to the grade because he has succeeded in commanding the secret preserved within it: the grades are differentiated by the hierarchical range of secrets, not by the amounts of goods circulated. As perhaps in other initiatory systems of this kind, what determines the particularity of each level is not only the secret but the prohibitions that create the secret, that protect and hide it. The initiatory ascension, the passage from one grade to the next, consists in a progressive desire to know what is hidden in all the ranks, that is, to know all the secrets. Acquiring these secrets is equivalent to knowing what was previously foreclosed to enquiry: it is to penetrate the prohibition and the mystery posed by it, through successive initiations. One could even say that the ladder of grades, and therefore the very act of ascension that constitutes initiation, requires a man gradually to infringe on the secrets. Each individual who prepares to climb the ladder finds himself first placed in the position of he-who-does-not-know. He is the ignorant one, and in the position of an inferior, because of the very fact that his understanding (his knowledge) is limited. Secrets surround him on all sides. The mass of grades looms over him like a territory of darkness, filled with mystery. At the start of this initiatory progression, the individual finds himself in some sense crushed by too much of the occult, by too great a silence in the face of the unknown. In the course of his ascent, this same individual will attempt to exhaust the not-known. He will accumulate his knowledge-of-the-secret. The completion of this progression, arrival at the top of the ladder, is the result of this gradual acquisition. But what exactly has he acquired? From now on, "he knows." The acquisition is this knowledge. Which is the same as saying that now, for him, there is no longer any secret. The image that emerges from this description ? in which we insist on this obsession with what is hidden ? corrects the more customary conception of the system of grades as based on some sort of stratified competition. Undoubtedly the ladder is hierarchical. The framework, whose size can vary from group to group, is definitely graduated, from bottom to top. And the person who occupies the rank at the top of the ladder holds all the secrets, having previously unveiled and assimilated them. The nature of the knowledge that he has so acquired remains to be explored in order to determine if this unveiling on which he prides himself actually assures him of having not only completed his initiation but also definitively secured a knowledge. This is analogous, we tend to think, to how the student (or the scientist) accumulates knowledge in order to increase his competence and to use it. But for this equation of the initiate and the student to be legitimate, it would be necessary for the limits of the unknown ? of what is to be known ? to have a similar character, and for the principle that causes the secret to unfold to be one with the thing that is hidden and must be discovered by the acquisition of knowledge. Now what obsesses and moves our thought is not (or is to only a slight extent) the secret; rather, it is the hope (the illusion?) of knowledge. What seems to motivate the New Hebridean man thus to perfect his total conception of what is human is probably, instead, the kind of wisdom one would attain when discovering that without secrets there would also be no knowledge. So that to "empty what is too full," as we could say, amounts to revealing the emptiness previously hidden by what was too-full-of-secrets. The man with mysteric knowledge is the one who attains wisdom by discovering that once he has removed the secrets that surrounded him, it is knowledge itself that wilts. Sense and non-sense are equal. Rather than as a hierarchical structure that stratifies knowledge, that breaks it up into a number of bits of knowing, up to that ultimate one principles on which the discipline of anthropology is based, that is, the understanding of cultural phenomena in their specificity as well as in their shared aspects? in a word, in their totality.</page><page sequence="19">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 23 that would embrace all knowing, the framework of ranks appears to us more like a hollow form, a structure of emptiness. To sum up: The essential feature of this knowledge is that it is of a negative kind ? it is, so to speak, knowledge by subtraction (en creux). It is artificial knowledge, also, because it is knowledge of fabricated secrets, of the secrets of men, not of nature. So it is a knowledge that paradoxically diminishes, together with the secret, in its "progress." The uninitiated novice knows that he doesn't know the secret. Later, he learns that there is nothing to it; the secret is but the procedure for the fabrication of a badge. What he learns, in a way, is the very pointlessness of knowledge. The secret, as long as it lasted, was the knowledge; with the secret, this knowledge, too, is gone. So, in his going through the grades, a man loses, while unveiling them, all secrets and all knowledge. In this process, as in all those of its kind, in our view, the revelation of mystery may refer to the uncovering of the unveilable essence of another, greater, mystery. The Unknown The Not-Yet Known It would then be misleading to assert that in this initiatory progression there is, essentially, an accumulation (here, of knowing-the-secret). The acquisition of any rank is generally accompanied by two events, as we have already noted. (1) The symbols, emblems, insignia of the preceding rank (the body colors, marks, masks, types of penile cases, and, where they already exist, the effigies) are replaced. It is the register of substitution rather than that of accumulation that is relevant here, and this applies also to what we have just said about the particular acquisition of knowledge modulated on the secret. (2) Knowledge of the secret increases, nevertheless, insofar as new acquisitions are added to preceding ones. But this increase is only sanctioned within the esoteric sphere: there is hardly any clarification of the increased knowledge.17 7. Knowledge Existentially, then, progress through the ranks only seems to take the form of an accumulation of partial bits of knowledge. On the surface, a man climbs the ranks as would someone who conceives of his life as a continuous series of promotions, through calculated and necessary transitions, from one stage to the next. The difference ? whence our disagreement with those of our predecessors who have proposed the old economic interpretation of this gradual ascent? has to do with the reasons, and thus with the finality, and with the nature of the very thing that motivates the quest. In the case of most of Malekula, as we have said already, in communities that tirelessly reiterate the initiatory imperative for each of their male members, this "reason" can be neither economic nor political. It lies rather in the gradual increase of a certain kind of knowledge that must end in the "true" knowledge. The aimed-at privilege is the attainment of this "good." Again, this understanding lies only in the disclosure itself. It is the knowledge-of-nothingness, the statement that there is nothing (more) to know (except the unknowable). The attainment of this limit is a victory. It admits not only ? and from an initiatory point of view, this is of primary importance ? that there is such a thing as the unsayable, something that cannot be said because it cannot be known, but also how sovereign the unsayable is. The triumphant figure of the "living dead one," a true renouncer seated at the top of the pyramid, symbolizes this victory, in which the oppositions that come into play lower down on the ladder of grades ? true/false, known/unknown, complete/incomplete, superfluous/essential ? have 1 7. Offerings (monetary offerings or offerings of goods) seem to increase as one rises in rank. Although at the time the rank is taken the offerings are unidirectional, the giver, who has become a new member, can in turn become a receiver when a new candidate presents himself. Note also that the benefit gained by an offering in no way seems to result in an accumulation, a stockpiling, of what has been given.</page><page sequence="20">24 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 been cancelled out. It would be a different story if the victory were not an initiatory one. In that case, the aimed-at privilege would be glory, and prestige for the sake of power, that is, acting authority, and therefore also possible abuse, secular power, "chieftainry." We have seen how the progression of grades is fractured, decapitated, when this kind of authority sets in. The achievement striven for in this culture, ideally ? democratically, we could even say, since it is open to everyone ? has two characteristics that are remarkable and very instructive for Melanesian ethnology. The first illustrates, in a paradigmatic manner, the particular nature of "power" in these societies; the second, in what way power and thanatology are intertwined. We are accustomed to interpret the traditional forms of authority by unconscious analogy with those that we ourselves are familiar with and submit to, those that, to reiterate Hocart's argument, having been stripped of the traditional finery, are now grounded on principles that legitimize them only as centers for decision making. Secular authority, it is called, because even where another, nonsecular, authority "complements" it (for the most part, in a residual way), such two-headedness is only stressed in terms of its secular immanent application. From the bottom to the top, secularization dominates our communal order. It then becomes difficult for us to conceive of a true authority that would not also be secular, such as the one we encounter in parts of Malekula. This is what makes the analysis impervious for us ? not that our secular authority, as some believe, is exempt from dangers, and hence from exercising sanctions, but that neither the first quality nor the second defines its nature, whereas dangers and sanctions for the Malekulans belong intrinsically to the vast range of prohibitions, which are the attributes of initiatory grades, govern all daily life outside the ceremonies (relations between ranks, relations between the sexes, relations between the communities), and constitute, so to speak, the "fuel" of transcendental authority. Let us look once more at what is gained by reaching the highest grade. Knowledge, familiarity with all the secrets that have been revealed one by one; the accumulation of experiences that have as their singular characteristic a mysteric nature, leading to that ultimate state of being represented by the meaning, the "content," of the last grade. A constant initiatory mobilization through "the passage," "the climb," is accompanied by remembrances of the dead, whose memory, as we shall see, is presented through the display of effigies or objects "that represent them," in such a way ? and here we are touching upon something troubling and remarkable ? that the exoteric aspect of the quest, and perhaps only that, is embodied in exterior forms, sculpted and erected in order to be seen, in evocation of absences, emblems of death, tangible signs of a memory-of-death; and lastly, it is crowned by the attainment of a status that is clearly ambiguous, a hybrid, that is, an ultimate and a first (and for that very reason a "dominant" state), which affirms the fact that the impossible ? to be dead while still in this life? is possible. The conquest of this kind of authority ? we cannot call it anything else ? affirms a surpassing that is truly, in ontological terms, a coincidentia oppositorum. This transcendence, achieved through a long traversal of stages, has existential roots, and therefore is neither liturgical ("I am this only as an actor") nor ? and this is important? conceptual ("I say that this is . . . possible"). In one single individual are united the new achievement and its opposite ("I am dead and I am not yet dead"), presence and absence, expressed in the only existential terms that are meaningful for these cultures: life and death. Then what is this authority? It is simply this "surpassing" embodied in a man. The authority of belief, not belief in authority. What makes it legitimate is not the symbols of privilege, their manipulation, a semblance of usefulness imposed on the community. Even if the conqueror sitting at the top of the ladder is, like any other authority, an inaccessible figure to those down below (because fundamentally his victory removes him, as though he were dead, from the community that he can still watch), he does not abdicate the power he has acquired; he detaches himself in order to be himself, declares that he can be "on the side," "beyond," because, helped by his progress through the nimangki, he has taken the thought of his own death to the very limit, tirelessly ? to the point of metamorphosing himself into a pure personification of the memory-of-knowledge (ancestor), which is also, as we have seen, pure obliteration of memory and knowledge, oblivion through representation. Thinking, now, of the situation that exists in northern Malekula, where the ranks and the chieftainry overlap, we have one question to ask: what is the price ? in terms of the cult and therefore also in ontological terms ? of the cleavage of the ranking system and the consequent reduction of the gradual visualization of death continually manifesting itself as a spectacle and a</page><page sequence="21">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 25 performance throughout the life of a man in the nimangki? As already noted, we have too little information to be able to answer this thoroughly. For our purposes here, be it sufficient to say that the emergence of a political modality ? it hardly matters whether formed by an internal transformation of the system or by innovations coming from outside ? sets up authority as a limit-status separated from the thanatology in such a way that from now on this power can only carry on an oblique dialogue with death: this could almost be used as a definition of secular power. The meaning conferred by the esoteric knowledge of the grades ? and here we must take into consideration all grades, nimangki and nalawan ? has an essential bearing on the duality of transcendence (every dead man of consequence partakes of this duality).18 What duality are we talking about? The attempt to answer this question leads us to ask another: how is this duality connected to the knowledge of the not-known, that conquest that is the fruit of ultimate understanding? The fact is, as we have indicated, that the progress of the man through the ranks consists in exhausting (knowledge of) the very organizing principles of this progress. The man who completes it is the one who goes beyond it: isn't he a "living dead man?" His life is now freed of the existential constraints of the human. He therefore finds himself not only in what we could call the "conquered void" but specifically in what is actually another dimension compared with what he has just been through, that is, a place that opposes ? or complements ? the transcendence previously inscribed in the ladder to be climbed, the transcendence of gradual apprenticeship, of initiation. This is why this same man will represent life in death ? just as he constantly represents death in life ? and figure forth in dance (as we shall see farther on when we talk about the funeral rites, in which the first effigies of the recent dead "come back") the flight of the spirit of the being who has just died. The transcendental duality represented in these rituals is thus the double sequence that, we might say, the man of the grades seems deliberately to thread during the course of his life: that of true death, always present in the sacra that recall it ? death as absence, death as memory ? and that of the death that is formed, step by step, in life, the ladder one climbs in order, finally, to reach that place where the eschatological dimension becomes a surpassing of the condition of life, as it is embodied in the man of the highest grade. 8. Esoterism and initiation Why should there be such an insistence on denying the esoterism of the Melanesian initiation forms, especially in the New Hebrides and the nearby Banks? For 100 years now we have had an abundance of information about these regions that belies some ethnologists' attempts to interpret the religion of these cultures as exoteric. We believe that this question is a legitimate one and should be addressed by all attentive interpreters of the traditional social forms of these groups. 18. The nalawan, parallel to the nimangki, only accentuate the eidos of these cultures. Because of the scarcity of evidence connected with this second sequence of grades (in Malekula, they seem particularly prevalent near Seniang, in the south, where Deacon worked), we cannot even picture with the approximation permitted in the case of the nimangki the nature of its very marked esoterism. The nalawan appear to intensify the secrecy of the nimangki grades and render it omnipresent. They contain the first initiatory trial that the male has to undergo in total seclusion: very often the nalawan ceremonies take place outside the village, in the bush, except for the spectacular ritual that is called nevimb?r (Deacon 1934b:436 ff.), organized in the village after the women have been driven out, to which we shall come back later. The novices have to submit to hazing and other ordeals and receive the revelation of the flutes and rhombs. Several liturgical events are marked by an explicit sexual symbolism ? and this is a point that should be noted, because some of these traits are shared by the initiation ceremonies of several cultures in New Guinea (the Marind group) and even in Australia. Unlike the nimangki, the nalawan do not erect effigies (although they do make temes, funerary marionettes used during the first funeral rite, where they appear coupled with the rambramb, as in the nevimb?r ritual), but they make and use masks (temes mbalmbal) ? whose conical shape is similar to that of the tamate masks of the Banks ? which are topped by anywhere from one to five faces, depending on the importance of the grade. The nalawan in some sense complement the nimangki, by dialecticizing the apprenticeship to the secret on the forest/village register. But significantly, too, the nalawan are separate from the cults of the dead ? they do not orchestrate death and the course of the afterdeath, since that is up to the nimangki; they do, however, prepare a man to enter into these cults ? first, by transmitting, in the early initiatory phase, the fundamental principles of a belief that is entirely centered upon the dialectic between secreting (masking) and unveiling; later, by allowing him to represent, as wearer of a mask, the figures of belief (the myths narrating their vicissitudes as, again, in nevimb?r). To complete this first picture, however fragmentary, of this explicit dialectic of the hidden, we will add that according to Deacon the nalawan are the ones who make the nisit tlel, true talisman fetishes that have evil powers and are used as such in witchcraft. As a provisional conclusion, the nimangki display a fictive exoterism ? they show, they publicize, instead of hiding. However, and significantly, they only exhibit objects, screens of unstated meanings, while, in a parallel way, the nalawan manipulate the emblems of the hidden. (See the section devoted to the nalawan.)</page><page sequence="22">26 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 This caution, or this outright refusal to admit that there can be no traditional initiation without esoterism and all its attributes ? both the secret and the knowledge of the secret that are needed for maintaining the initiatory procedures ? probably derives from a prejudice (ideological in its limitations and deaf to all objections because ideological) that holds that these cultures are animated by a "pragmatic eidos": "Melanesians have been called pragmatists and this characterization seems reasonable .... Tradition and convention are guides rather than controls" (Lane 1965). How, we ask, could pragmatic men allow themselves to be taken in by gratuitous illusions? This is how it happens that for two generations a simplified image has formed of these societies as clouded by obsessions with what is empirical, and, by this very fact, deprived of any true nonsecular quest; they are pigeonholed in the ethnographies, as in the interpretations, by the paradigm that tries to sum them up: "exchangism." However, this choice of interpretation, which has become obligatory these days ? just read most of what is currently being written on the subject ? also has well-known antecedents. In fact, it is fed by the common image of the Melanesian, an image that has traveled around the world: the Melanesian as a "participationist" creature, incapable of distinguishing subject from object, past from present, structure from event (the most representative example being still the Do Kamo by M. Leenhardt). Or else the Melanesian is seen as an unfortunate entrepreneur, arrogant and naive, involved in businesses destined to fail again and again, speculating on an ephemeral prestige. All this ethnological commonplace coming together in the figure of the "big man" is what dominates the literature. Being ideological, it resists the facts, that mass of phenomena that our pragmatists must describe as "cultic and esoteric deliriums." The rhetoric, in which every description is already an interpretation, though not acknowledged as such, remains the same everywhere. And if the facts, even the most obvious ones, escape the reduction that attempts to make them all "immanent," then they are discarded, because in trying to reflect them, there is the risk of losing one's way in them, their complexity is so bewildering, and to get lost is always frightening. We have deliberately chosen to run this risk. It is said that in the Banks-Torres-New Hebrides area the nimangki, sukwe, and kwatu initiatory societies are secular. There are only transactions, payments in edible goods and in "money," in plain sight and known to everyone. The fact that access to the initiatory society regularly involves bloody, massive, and spectacular sacrifices, that "the taking of rank," as they say, is by sacrifice does not seem to surprise anyone. In any case, we are told, these societies should not be confused with true "esoteric" societies (which probably complement them ? but no one knows just how): the tamate \n the Banks and in the Torres, and the nalawan, nevimb?r, and neerew in the New Hebrides. This is a statement that has become dogma since Codrington. "What gives the Mangki a secular appearance is that the rites are performed in public and that the performer thereby gains social kudos that he may then use for personal ends." The same author goes on to say that "the secular aspect, however, is not primary, but secondary, and the whole rite depends for its efficacy on complex religious sanctions" (Layard 1942:701). Nevertheless, one is certainly obliged to acknowledge that they have many and explicit dealings with the "dead" (spirits or ancestors, as we shall see farther on), especially in the Banks-Torres area. The list is a long one.19 About the sukwe, supposedly nonesoteric, Codrington had already noted that "in the old days [that is, before Christianization] it was believed by outsiders to be the work of ghosts" (Codrington 1891:88); however, he immediately goes on to remark, in regard to the kwat (gat) societies, which are equivalent to the sukwe: "gat refers to the hats [headdresses, masks] and not to the vui [nonhuman spirits that we will return to]; and inquiry 19. Since Codrington, and especially since Rivers 20 years after him, the extension of the initiatory societies, starting from the Torres Banks area, "where the societies have reached their highest development" (Rivers 1914, 11:206), had been recognized. (But Rivers was not yet acquainted with the incredible complexity of the New Hebridean societies described 15 years after him by Deacon and Layard.) Initiatory societies are known to extend as far as the southeastern regions of the nearby Solomon Islands: Ngela (matambala societies [Codrington 1891:73, 94 ff.]), San Cristobal, and Sa'a (malaohu, the initiatory organization of young males [Ivens 1927:130-160]). It should be pointed out that groups like the matambala, the sukwe, and the tamate are not simple puberty initiatory societies like the malaohu of Sa'a, which is fundamentally centered around symbolic poles ?the ocean and fishing ? unknown to the others. In the direction of New Guinea (to the west), after the absence of initiatory societies in the western Solomon Islands (Eddystone, Ruviana, Vella Lavella, with the exception, apparently, of North Bougainville [see Rivers 1914, ll:206]) and their absence in the Massim and the Entrecasteaux (perhaps Dobu deserves a special treament), we find them again in the area of New Ireland and New Britain (the ingiet and dukduk societies). To the south of the New Hebrides, starting at Efate, the societies disappear; information about the area of New Caledonia, in which there are masks that bear a singular resemblance, as Codrington had already noted, to the cylindrical masks of the tamate in the Banks, still remains too ambiguous and confused for one to be able to come to any conclusions. For an ethnographic survey of New Herbridean grade systems, see Allen 1967.</page><page sequence="23">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 27 does not discover any religious meaning in the initiation" ? an initiation that, Codrington believed, consisted in learning certain dances (Codrington 1891:84, 85). The main characteristics of these societies are reduced to choreographies (which imply apprenticeship in music, which plays a key role in the initiation), to offerings made by candidates to the members of the society, to a hierarchical and ascensional form of the societies themselves (whence their current name of "grades") in which the individual has a place until he dies. According to Codrington (who was the initiator of this research), these features did not include any cultic-esoteric apprenticeship. Rivers, 20 years later, was already qualifying the sharp separation that his predecessor had proclaimed between the esoterism and exoterism of the initiatory organizations: "Dr. Codrington has stated that the sukwe is not connected with the secret societies of the ghosts but it seems clear that this statement needs modification" (Rivers 1914:126). We are going to apply ourselves to that task. It seems to us that it would be inconclusive to say that there can be initiation (and no one can deny that the sukwe, like the tamate, is explicitly initiatory) without apprenticeship. To say, as some would claim, that this apprenticeship consists in remuneration in goods and moneys, which sanction entrance into the societies, is absurd ? all the more.so since these "offerings," as we have already observed, prescriptively call for the sacrificial act. It remains to find out what is meant by initiatory society, especially since this definition is the source of the claimed separation between two sequences of societies ? sukwe and tamate, "village societies" and "bush societies," esoteric (religious) and exoteric (profane) ? whether one accepts the term "initiatory society," as did our predecessors, or whether one refuses it, as we do here; the dualism of these societies is not a hypothesis, it is a fact. The first, rough definition might be the following: these societies are groups surrounded with prohibitions, defending "secrets" that are officially connected with the acquisition and guarding of "belief knowings." From this point of view, sukwe and tamate do not differ. But the distance between them is certainly real, starting with their respective names. In certain respects these societies recall the classical forms of puberty rituals, as Rivers tried to show. They include ordeals and the unveiling of "tricks" that follows them; the acquisition, through an organized revelation that is the rite of passage itself, of a knowledge that turns the individual into an initiate ("before his initiation, he [the initiate] really should join in company with the ghost of the departed; when he was illuminated [having received the revelation, we could say] he enjoyed the reception of those who followed him" [ibid.:92]). We should point out that Rivers was speaking of the su/ewe, of supposedly secular societies. This repudiation that the initiate incurs has to do with the "presence" and "action" of the dead, that is, with the entity that is the central figure in the representations of the Melanesian Transcendent. An unapproachable threat before the initiation, this unveiled presence becomes a secret that must not be revealed afterwards. To state that this experience has nothing religious about it is simply to deny all transcendent value to the Melanesian cults. The screen of belief, especially if one is a believer oneself, as was the missionary Codrington, is probably harder to penetrate when one is in a situation that is culturally different.20 As for Rivers's argument relating the sukwe to puberty rites, the proximity displayed at each stage (at each "rank") between the initiate and the dead-ancestor and the repetitiveness of these initiatory passages ? the initiate is constantly being reinitiated ? do not allow us to accept his comparison. A puberty ritual brings about a definitive alteration, constitutes a definitive accomplishment; and it cannot be repeated, which is not the case in the recurrent and progressive rituals of the sukwe. Before we contemplate the sukwe in their relation to the tamate, who are very probably their extension, we must try to define the originality of the sukwe by asking the following question: what kind of alteration is effected by the initiation? Or, who is becoming what? In the case of the classical, punctual initiation, the initiate is the twice-born, who dies and is reborn. The life-death duality lies at the heart of the process but is reversed in relation to the individual's biological destiny. The symbolic death of the human being returns him to life, but transformed. This event is necessary for him to be totally himself; it is the initiation, therefore, that grants the human his full being, his identity as human. Note that here the human being not only perfects himself through death (simulated, ritual) but that his accomplishment, his identity, identifies him, as we shall see in the case we are considering, with a dead man. This is why Rivers's arguments are inadequate. Certainly it is true that for the successful initiate a resurrection still takes place (thus the explanation of the ordeals that he must submit to and that are the limits of his initiatory experience ? the forms of his being put-to-death). But in the Banks and the Torres, he who comes back from the trial ostensibly retains the attributes of the being he was during his putting-to-death. The sukwe initiate is a ghost. As we shall see, this feature is even more marked in the initiations of the tamate societies.21 20. Think of the mistaken notions entertained by another missionary, M. Leenhardt: behind an ecumenism that is nothing but rhetoric, there shines forth an incomprehension of the other that borders on pure racism. The remarkable honesty of Codrington nevertheless allows him to say, with a perplexity that we acknowledge: "It is difficult, in view of the structured secrecy and solemnity of the mysteries, to believe that there is no knowledge imparted in initiation of a religious character .... The uninitiated . . . undoubtedly believed that the initiated entered into association with the ghost of the dead" (Codrington 1891:71 ). This is a courageous admission. 21. The resurrection is really a "return to life," here as elsewhere. It is nevertheless true that the initiate (or the god) who is reborn is not necessarily perceived as a "dead man who comes back." In the West</page><page sequence="24">28 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 Slit gong also used in several sequences of the funeral ritual. (G. Liotard) In these initiatory situations, where the state of the man is supposed to be modified, it seems plausible that his "being" changes, that the man submits himself to trials in order to change what can be changed in him. The entire question of the initiation, on which all comparative interpretation depends, turns on this one proposition. Now, our definition of this "being," and this not only in Melanesia, is purely intuitive; the same is true of its "change." These notions say at once a great deal and too little. And we know perhaps even better than the initiate himself that in the liturgical event nothing tangible, or almost nothing, has actually changed. The man who emerges from the trial is the same one who entered it. At the most he will carry on his body some markings, some ornaments, that attest to his passage. However, when we say that his being changes, we postulate a radical alteration, even at the risk of appearing to incur something of a contradiction. Those who try to see the Melanesian initiation as purely secular probably think they are avoiding this contradiction by holding to the view that nothing tangible has changed. The fact is that they are blinded by the idea that the change is only the concrete result of the operation (here the initiation). We are leaving aside what we shall call, for the moment, the "effects of illusion set in motion by the initiation." Aren't we saying that initiation is a "rite"? Aren't we saying that the initiate "has changed status," as has a Ph.D. candidate who earns his degree? But these are only the superficial aspects, the "tangible" ones, if we dare call them that, of any such undertakings. Besides, even in such a pragmatic sense, it is enough to think of the changes in status that abound in our own societies: it is always the being of the individual that is affected (a status is neither an "acquired" psychological characteristic nor a sociologically recognizable garment). To assert that in a sukwe the passage is the equivalent of a change of status is to suppose that the two alterations are initiatory, and in the same way, and that admission to a new status involves the same kind of achievement in both cases (acquisition of a "power": this explains why people have made "secular" societies out of political forms), while the change of status is only the most superficial aspect of these practices. The pragmatic argument is that one undergoes a trial in order to climb the social ladder, from which one must obtain certain privileges (to increase or perfect the resources of authority). These arguments, though recognizing by necessity the "illusions" in which these rituals are clothed, deny that these same illusions, in and by themselves, could have any effect, any consequence, any value for the initiate, and so the reasons for them remain completely obscure (primitive darkness?).22 If we forget these artificial similarities and concentrate on the "illusory effects" created by the initiation rites, we must ask once again the ontic question: what is triggered by the initiatory metamorphosis? What does it mean to "change being," the hidden source of the external changes symbolized by status? If "being" and status can change together, this is because a common factor is involved. This common denominator is the one contained in the initiatory expression itself: to conquer the identity ? to have it. And the identity, in turn, leads to the notion that determines its relevance ? that is, to the person. we distinguish carefully between the two: a ghost is a "specter"; a person reborn never is. Here some very interesting questions could be asked about the relationship between one thanatology, the Melanesian one, and other thanatologies (ours, for example). The following pages can only sketch a first interpretation of one of the terms of this contrast, one whose importance, we hope, will not escape the reader. 22. In this pragmatic sense of the word, it is fairly clear that socially, especially in our societies, being and status are equivalent, since the individual's being tends to be identified, at least ideally, with his social status. To sav, therefore, that his being is what changes is to say that his status has changed, and vice versa. This is why, using this very ideologically oriented homology, the initiations of other people will appear to be nothing more than changes of status. And traits will be emphasized that confirm the similarity (traits having to do with the material advantages that have been acquired or are soon to be acquired).</page><page sequence="25">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 29 To sum up what we have been trying to say, the initiation consists of an induced solipsistic effect whereby an individual once again becomes himself (and is at last himself) ? this is possible for him only through this detour ? after having lost that which previously made him himself but also that which remained incomplete: his old identity. The metamorphosis is taken for granted (properly speaking, there are no initiatory "failures") but is experienced as having been induced, grasped, brought about by causes and agents (the latter, the initiators, being instruments of these causes). This return to oneself ("I die and find my life again") is a recovery realized through trial, which consists of the "symbolic" suppression of what the man already was before and which takes place by means of true ontogenetic crises. Essentially, these crises are puberty and death. In the case of the sukwe ? and this is even more clearly apparent in the tamate, or in the New Hebridean equivalent of the sukwe, the nimangki ? the entrance into death is the course undertaken by the initiate in the belief that "this is the work of the dead," "that he should approach them." But the information gained in the initiation ("I now know that the dead are not there") is in fact hardly comparable here to the information usually gained during a puberty rite of passage. The entry into the initiation of the sukwe is actually the beginning of an initiatory spiral that does not stop until the real death of the individual. Then let us ask the question once more: what is changing, in this perpetual initiation? What kind of sense does it make to say that a man becomes a "dead man," or a "being" becomes a "spirit," or a "spirit" becomes a "specter" (ghost)? Keeping in mind that in this ritualized ontology the ancestralization that occurs at death is the same as the metamorphosis into a dead-ancestor through initiation ? for it would seem that this double state, of being a dead man and an initiate, merges in one single presence and in one single concept: tamate ? which aspect of the human, of his being, must change in these circumstances? How can the being-of-the-person (and also, necessarily, the being of every nonhuman presence, as we shall see later) be conceived if it is hardly speakable, as is also the case everywhere else in Oceania? In these languages there is no attribute for existence. This implicit thing, this unnamed thing, that is the being, through which emerges the person and upon which is formed the identity through successive identifications (of which the identification with the dead is the first, the inaugural one, bringing the others in its train, the initiatory cycle itself) is certainly at the heart of the whole affair. There would be no way to understand why identity (1 = 1 as well as l = other) should consist in this perpetual will to identify, nor why the first and most unusual identity should herald others ("because I am other, I am myself"), if the question of the being did not present itself in the form of a quest for consolidation ? consolidation not through the notional fixation, familiar to our tradition, of what being would be but through analogies of being, and therefore also through multiple identities. In Melanesia, being is articulated, but only inductively, and only through characteristics that are essentially those of presence. Now, presence is onta, not eon: existing, not being. If there is no reason to posit the notation of being, then we cannot infer that "what changes" in the initiation is being. All we know is that this dialectic of becoming, of perpetual change, seizes the human in its beginning and envisages it at the intersection of life and death as a composite presence, definable only by "attributes-of-presence." By cumulative attributes. As a consequence, being is fleetingly and inductively perceived through its revealed, acquired characteristics, manifesting itself in contact with death, that is, with an absence that subsists as an absence. From among the variety of expressions relating to these attributes and their mutations we can perhaps isolate those that will help us in our attempt to clarify the subject. In Motlav (Banks), "the soul" is called talegi: it has "no form, like a reflection or shadow" (Codrington 1891:250). In Mota, the same entity is called atai (a term that is prevalent as far away as Polynesia and is commonly translated as "reflection"). But also in Mota, niniau means "shadow reflection" and nunuai is equivalent to atai. These are puzzling similarities: atai meaning soul or (sic) reflection; niniau meaning shadow-reflection; and nunuai meaning soul (and therefore, by induction, reflection) ? three different expressions for saying the same thing. Now in any ontological vocabulary conceptual differences are at once infinitesimal and crucial; so they should not be overlooked. In the nearby island of Pentecost (New Hebrides), the soul is called tamtegi (close to the Motlav talegi), which leads Codrington to infer: "for there is no doubt that the Mota tamate is the dead man" (ibid.:253). According to Tattevin's reports of south Pentecost (1926:370-444), "soul-shadow" is called manuk, which becomes, upon one's death, armat or tegat, a "shadow" as translated by this French missionary (?bid.:393). Atai, niniau, and nunuai (note that in the nearby Solomon Islands, at Malaita, nunui means reflection, whereas anoe means shadow; the two together form the yu, the double, that</page><page sequence="26">30 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 is, the human person), as well as talegi and tamtegi, are notions designating the human being as signifier-image: the inhabited presence, inhabited by what makes it a presence. L?vi-Strauss, reinterpreting Frazer, says that atai and nunu are objects, "animals or plants upon which the existence of certain individuals depends"; but he also adds that "the meaning of nunuai and atai is approximately the same as the meaning of 'soul' .... According to Codrington, a native of Mota discovers his tamaniu (equivalent to nunuai) through a vision or with the help of methods of divination" (L?vi-Strauss 1962:101). In fact, the "totemic" correspondence between a man and the kind of nonhuman entity we are talking about here (and will return to later) leads us to consider these notions as doubles in the sense indicated earlier, close to the ancient Greek concept of ipvxv (cf. Rohde 1925; Guidieri 1980). This is how the reflection can be the "image," and in both senses of the word: a presence and a semblance of something that is not resolved into presence alone. Now all these notions, in other respects so bound up with the thanatology that subsumes them, are distinct, however, from what designates the presence transformed by death: what was notionally presence in life can in no way remain that, unchanged, in death. What we want to know, then, is what the metaphysics of the presence consists of in the two cases. We would not have to make this distinction if the "dead one" were not, from the very first initiation on, the entity that designates the living, other than through elements of presence, and if the dead man were only an "after-death" and not the initiate identifying with him, as well. Especially in the Banks ? and we shall see that this has even further implications ? we find there is a notion quite distinct from those that refer to the human presence as well as to the presence after death, one that has always posed problems of interpretation: it is the notion of vui, or wui. In the same way that the notions of the human presence are distinct from those that refer to the dead-being, the notion of vui is distinct from the latter.23 What is the entity vu/? According to Codrington and also to Rivers, and even in more recent work (Vienne 1979:594 ff.), vui is neither the spirit of the dead man nor the ancestral state. Vui are "nonhuman spirits" that "are incarnated" (the local notion, in the Banks, which translates as "changeling" [cf. Codrington 1891:172], and whose equivalent as far as Polynesia would be atia [cf. Williams and Traeger], is crucial, as we shall see). Most often in rocks (the same literature claims that what we have here are "ephemeral" incarnations). Codrington maintains that "vui has no form ... no form, no soul, because itself is like a soul" (ibid.: 123). This is a contradictory statement: if the vui is like the soul, it is necessarily anthropomorphic, and this is a characteristic that has specifically been rejected. The same author likens the vui of the Banks (note that the entity designated by this notion seems to be absent from the neighboring New Hebrides) to entities found in the southern Solomon Islands (Ngela and San Cristobal in particular), the hi'ona, figona, and vigona. These entities have the power to incarnate themselves ("manifest themselves") in natural phenomena: wind, rain, thunder, and so on. All of them have a feminine and reptilian nature: they are "women-snakes" (figures that are also prevalent in the rest of Melanesia and are placed mythically at the origin of the death of men, who were once immortal). In Ngela they are called Koevasi, in San Cristobal they are called Kahausibware. Humans are descended from them (ibid.:124) and derive their mortality from them. This feminine nature disappears in the Banks where, as we have already noted, the vui are incarnated in stones (nevet, vet). But the "demiurges" of the Banks, Qat and Tagharo, seem to be in several respects equivalent to the feminine hi'ona of the Solomon Islands. Qat in particular ("he never was a man," says Codrington), like the Tagharo brothers (who logically have the same nonhuman nature), is the cause of unusual phenomena. Several informants consider him a vui (ibid.:155); he has no father, but his mother was a stone. Now stones are the most common incarnated form of Qat and, by extension, of the vui. But "the stone, they say, is not the body of the spirit, nor is the spirit like the soul of the stone for a stone certainly has no soul; they say that the spirit is at the stone, o vui ape vatu, or near the stone, and it is the spirit not the stone that acts" (ibid.:182). An ambiguous statement, in which it appears that the stony presence is certainly the envelope in which the vui is contained but that it is different from the corporeal envelope. A statement that we consider justified by the opposition between tamate-atai (tamaniu) and vui-nevet (stone). "The common name for all sacred stone is matiu," 23. Since Codrington it has often been suggested that "dead man" and "person" merge in the notion of atmat, tegat, tamat, tamate, temes, mate, mae (variants of the Oceanic notion of mate, "deceased," "living person about to die," "weakness," "sickness"). The literature has accustomed us to accepting these equivalencies as understood. The work we propose to do consists of rejecting them. What is certain is that the tamate in the Banks and the New Hebrides cannot be reduced to its current translation of "spirit." In no part of Melanesia is the dead man the soul-spirit-reflection, nor is he the ancestor. If the tamate is the dead man, moreover, he is not yet the ancestor. The ancestral state cannot be identified only with the state of absence established by death alone. Given the importance of these notions, this woolly thinking is unacceptable. In fact, how can we understand the name and the function of societies that bear this name if we have not already defined what a dead man is and what an ancestor is? We think that the distinction exists. The figure of the "demiurge," the "cultural hero," called Ta-ghar, Tagaro, Takaro in the Banks and in the New Hebrides, corresponds to the notion of the ancestor that is called tindalo, agalo, and akalo in the nearby Solomon Islands. We shall return to this later.</page><page sequence="27">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 31 defined as "out of mana" (ibid.). Should this additional native affirmation be read as a contradiction of the acknowledged "power" (mana) of the inhabited-stones? Or should this singular "lack" (not to have mana) be considered the consequence of the characteristic nature of the vui, whose force is exterior, foreign to mana? Yet the places occupied by inhabited stones are called rongo: forbidden. An observation that makes what follows seem incomprehensible: "no garden was planted without stones buried in the ground to ensure a crop; these are the tamate gangan, of remarkable long shape" (ibid.: 183, 184). Not only are the stones and the places where they are buried forbidden but the stones also guarantee the growth of the crops (and in this case, we note that they would be named without any more allusion to the vui but only to the tamate, that is, the dead). There are two possibilities: either the stones for promoting growth are different from the "vui stones" or for the sake of fertility vui and tamate have been mingled, which would throw back into question the very distinction that has thus far particularized the vui. The similarity between these two entities, the ex-human and the nonhuman, belying the distinction between tamate and vui, can be somewhat illuminated by comparing it with what Hocart tells us about the neighboring Fiji Islands in the sourthern area of the Lau group, concerning the vuu root, from which the vui root is very likely derived (Hocart 1929:188). "The word vu," he writes, "may best be rendered by the French word souche; it means the stem of a tree, the base, origin, cause, reason. It is added to the word tevoro ["devil" ? a Christianized notion, though Hocart does not note this], or kalou, and the expression tevoro vu is defined as the origin of the land, whence men originate. . . . The word is sometimes alone, or in the expression vu nui vanua (origin or ancestor of the land). These gods are constantly spoken of simply as tevoro, timoni ["demon" ? another Christianized notion], or kalou, and the word vu is only used to make it plain." Hocart even thinks that the word is not autochthonous; he notes farther on: "The Polynesian word tupua [ancestrally] is largely used instead of vu, especially in the southern islands." 24 For the time being we can draw some tentative conclusions about the ontological questions connected with transformation and identification in Melanesian initiation. Four different ontic classes can be distinguished, corresponding to "presences" with different names: the class of the human in the strict sense, defined by its attributes ? shadow, reflection, spirit, soul; the class of the dead (mate, mae, temes, tamate); the class of ancestors (tindalo, agalo, akalo, and tagharo); and lastly the class of prehuman ancestors (vui, wui, vuu, figona, hi'ona). In the first class, the human is endowed with double and multiple attributes-of-presence. As an individual, the human is a presence who belongs to two ontic conditions: as such he is also projected out of his world, since in the strongest sense of the word he depends on a nonhuman lineage. Taken individually, human existence has its own major ontic attributes (its "soul") ascribed to the animal or plant entity associated with it. This entity is its attribute-identity in a sense that goes beyond the distance between inside and outside (cf. the notion of tamaniu) and presents itself as the negation of the major difference, the difference between human and nonhuman in a sense even more marked than the difference between the present-being, the living person, and the absent-being, the dead person (the forgotten). This observation forces us to modify our earlier statement that the category of human presence was ontologically close to or identical with the Greek notion of the psyche and that we could render it by the word "double" ? my interior double (reflection, shadow, spirit, and so on) and my exterior double (the nonhuman entity that is my referent-guardian). Clearly, the Greek notion does not exhaust the complexity of this particular ontic double, which is the totemic double. The second class includes the human-without-life, in the process of metamorphosing (his body either weakening or decomposing, depending on whether he is sick or dead): the human being projecting himself into that distance that is his own surpassing (the transcendent condition), but even more, in the Banks and New Hebrides cultures, living humans reiterating perpetually the initiatory situation, that is, men "personifying" the dead. As far as the first class goes, we should note that the incarnation ? because that is 24. An entire article could be devoted just to the notion of kalou because of its referential and functional duality, which is central in the representations of authority and transcendence in Fiji. All the more so since the question that is raised concerning the kalou involves at once the phenomenon of incarnation (l = other) and of ancestrality (the ascendance) ? in this case that of divinity (the nonhuman near the human, within the being, who assumes it while still alive) and authority (in Fiji, kalou is also the "chief-king"). Codrington, citing Fison, already noted that the Fijian chief "used no verb 'am' or 'shall be'; he said only: 1 a kalou'" (Codrington 1891:122). A. Capell (1941:268, 269) translates it this way: "kalou, a spirit, originally the dead .... In modern qse, a god, and kalou, the God of Christianity. Radically kalou is ghost: kalou-vuu: origin ghost." Now, in Fiji kalou is both chief and god. The chief incarnates the invisible kalou (Marshall Sahlins, personal communication). Presence is therefore incarnation, just as the initiate into the sukwe is a tamate. The chief is this incarnation living in the man, as though the place in which the entity is incarnated promotes him to the rank of an authority.</page><page sequence="28">32 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 what it is ? refers here to the dead man and that the dead man is logically defined by an absence of presence: a lack that demands and justifies this mode of presenting him. The living human tirelessly lends himself to being double in another way, and "more" than he was by his own intrinsic double nature (see the first class) and as a presence legitimized by its own totemic reference. In fact, in the initiation ? and, really, without pause throughout his life ? the living human personifies the dead man he will one day become. Several consequences follow from this, for the attributes of his person as well as for his referential relation to the totemic entity, starting with an accumulation of attributions-identifications that are hardly ephemeral, and certainly not revocable. This is something we cannot expand upon here, since on this precise point, which is so essential, the literature gives few details. In the third class ? and here we do include the Fiji Islands, though they are more Polynesian than Melanesian in this respect ? the authority is at once immanent and transcendent and is personified by one "major" individual; it is an authority that goes beyond all other forms of mediation between the human condition and the nonhuman condition and corresponds to a sacerdotal function ? it consists of the dead having reached their height, perfected in their death, henceforth distinct from any representable presence (except, sometimes, by the evocation of their names) and therefore dialectically in conflict with entities belonging to the last class.25 Several comments can be made about the being called by the "name" of Tagaro (and this applies to all its variants, as far as the central New Hebrides), most of them drawn from Layard's descriptions (1942). In the north of the New Hebrides, in the island of Atchin (on the east coast of Malekula, where Layard did most of his work), Ta-ghar is a "creator-deity," creator of the principal village of Pete-hul, and later this became the name of the Christian God (Layard 1942:211). However, he is not worshipped in these regions, nor in others where he is known (ibid.:503 n), even though he is the master and the founder of the cosmic and sociological order. Layard emphasizes that Taghar is only positive, unlike the ancestors, which are both positive and negative (ibid.:216-21 7). Similarity with the Polynesian figure of Tangaloa (Ta'aroa, Kanaloa) is not borne out, fundamentally because of this characteristic (otherwise, we would have to construct a hypothesis that would be very interesting but too exacting, according to which the worship of the ex-humans, of the ancestors, would imply a recognition without worship of nonhuman spirits, a sort of cultic reversal in the hierarchy of transcendent figures). The attributes of Polynesian divinity that certain writers have associated with Tagaro are intrinsically ambivalent (negative and positive at the same time). In Vao (northeast Malekula), Tagher (Tagaro) created the first man and the first woman, and in the Solomon Islands, the feminine and reptilian hi'ona. In Raga (Pentecost), he is an "evil spirit." He is most often presented as an argonaut who comes from somewhere else and lands on the island (a common theme throughout Melanesia whenever the first ancestors are concerned), is associated with light (lightning, the moon, sometimes even the sun), and, like the Polynesian trickster Maui, introduces culture among men and then disappears. In the Banks, Tagaro is the name of a group 25. We are confronting the problem of positioning and the consequent imbalance and conflict between the totemic-(double) being (the double of the living being) and the ancestor (who can no longer be double). If, as L?vi-Strauss (1962:104-143) noted, alimentary prohibitions issue from the totem, how can we explain this remark, drawn from the ethnography of these regions and commentated by Frazer: "all the descendants are now forbidden to consume this animal, or to destroy it: It is our ancestor,' they say, and they make an offering to it" (ibid.: 104). The totemic double, then, is apparently the reincarnation of the ancestor, and because of this very fact it is forbidden for it to be eaten. However, this incarnation is not at all inevitable, even in these cultures, just as this double is conceptually distinct from the ancestor (a dead-ancestor is not always a totem-ancestor). Paraphrasing L?vi-Strauss, we will ask the following question: in what way is an ancestor still "culture" (human) and already "nature" (nonhuman)? L?vi-Strauss observes that in the case of the totemic entity, standing between man and nature, there is "an exchange in which likenesses are swapped for differences" (ibid.: 143); he goes on to note that "if men use alimentary prohibitions as a way of denying their humanity a real animal nature, it is because they need to assume the symbolic characteristics with which they distinguish the animals from one another ... in order to create differences among them" (ibid.). Totem and ancestrality (totem being a form of ancestrality) are forms of incarnation. Now, in these cultures the question of incarnation becomes very complex insofar as we are dealing with multiple incarnations: there is the incarnation of the initiate (who is "dead"), the incarnation that is his nonhuman double (his "soul"), and finally the incarnation of the ancestor (the ex-dead man) who can incarnate himself in his descendants. Very early on, Rivers had an intuition of how complex the relationship was between the tamate and the nonhuman world, that is, the totemic beings. He noted that the tamate (as initiatory societies) were symbolized by animals that were often also forbidden to be eaten. But this prohibition was lifted by the initiation, this food privilege being connected to the fact that the individual now belonged to the initiatory group (Rivers 1914, 11:119-120). "These societies," he added, "may embody some form of totemism just as we have seen that they embody a cult of the dead and the institution of taboo" (ibid.:220, 221). And he associated this with the custom by which the newborn child is identified with an animal through the "double" (tamaniu), "guardian or life-token" (ibid.:346 ff.). The transition from ancestral incarnation to the dualism of the living human is in several respects one of the most difficult aspects of totemism to study. Here we are doing hardly more than scratching the surface of the problem.</page><page sequence="29">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 33 of siblings, the oldest of whom is Kwat (meaning "head" or "chief" in the Mota language); this Kwat is considered in Maewo and in Vanua Laua (still in the Banks) to be the founding ancestor of the sukwe initiatory societies (Codrington 1891:153). Layard quotes a conversation between a French missionary and a native of Pentecost on the subject of Te-ghar (Tagaro): "Te-ghar is like (?) a ghost (ta-mat); ... (he have) no body .... He makes the trees to grow .... He is good . . . very different from Le-hev-hev (a ferocious guardian of the life after death) .... Begets human children on the moon, which is called Grandmother" (Layard 1942:211). Closely connected with the moon, in that its cycle is linked to the growth of the crops (but all the informants refuse to identify Te-ghat with the moon [cf. ibid.:215]), Te-ghat (or Kwat, his older version in the Banks) is apparently "like" a dead man in that he has no body and, as a cultural hero upon whom men depend for the growth of their crops, one who is named without being worshipped, he is opposed to a maleficent figure, Le-hev-hev, who becomes active where life stops, where the road to the land of the dead begins. Identified also with sukwe26 (ibid.:219, 220, 220n), Le-hev-hev seems to be asexual, unlike Te-ghar, who is male or of alternate sex (female in a patrilineal regime and vice versa). Layard even suggests, with unintentional humor, that he be called "It" ? as in the Freudian "Es" (Layard:219). Chthonic, "his head was forked, therefore he had two thoughts in it" (Codrington 1891:169). He is represented by the Scorpion, "which draws us to it so that it may devour us," as another informant notes. He lies in wait for the dead in a grotto at the entrance to his Labyrinth, ready to devour them. The dead (temes) must cross the labyrinth, the nitus ("drawing," "writing," a "map") down the middle, using the nahal, the Path that cuts the figure in two.27 He therefore controls the ancestrality of the dead through this threat of cannibalism, which appears during the initiatory trial of the Labyrinth. The fate of the dead is in his hands ? while Te-ghar has no power over them. With the last class, we reach a sort of paradoxical limit. Although we are still dealing with ancestrality, now this must be taken to denote a prehuman beginning of the current order of the world that includes the human. Vui, vuu, and also the hi'ona figures of the Solomon Islands constitute the true original entities, where the human merges with what is not human. As such, the figures can no longer belong to the ex-human order of ancestrality, nor to the simultaneous duality of the totemic doubles. They are neither ancestral incarnations represented by nonhuman beings, nor do they form an ancestral rank reached by man in death. We might be tempted to call these entities by the Polynesian name for this kind of manifestation ? "divinity" (akua, atua). But if we did this, we would be ignoring their nature, which is mineral and parthenogenetic or feminine and reptilian, or mythologically ancestral, as in the Kwat cousins of the Banks who all bear the same "name," Tagaro, which is very likely, as we shall see, a variant of the term that elsewhere designates the ancestor (agalo, akalo, tindalo). At present, our investigation cannot go beyond this point, just as it cannot penetrate the ambiguity in Polynesia between the concepts of ancestor (tupua, tupuna) and divinity (atua, akua). Nevertheless, before we conclude, we should note two things: the vui is prehuman like the totemic entity; however, the vui is not a totem, a simple nonhuman: it is mainly a hybrid, unlike the totem in that it is original (in the same way as the beings that inhabit the "Time of Dream" in Australian cosmology); it is not worshipped, unlike the ancestors (or the divinities in Polynesia); lastly, the initiatory societies seem to pointedly ignore the ambiguity of the vui and to emphasize only the condition of death (mate, the dead one), which appears to be viewed as the preliminary condition for the existence of all these forms of beings. In the Banks, to become initiated, to pay the "money" at the time of the initiation (money that is exclusively made by women in all these regions) is called tiro (Rivers 1914:188). From the outside, to have been initiated means to belong henceforth to a society. But it is also, and most importantly, a matter of learning how to make initiatory objects that in the case of both the sukwe and tamate are objects of disguise ? mainly masks (or "hats," as the literature since Codrington has called them) that go by the same name among the sukwe and the tamate: again, tamate, or "dead man." This common name led Rivers to suggest that the sukwe and tamate must have been closer at one time than they were when he 26. "The word sukwe . . . used to designate the Guardian Ghost, such as Temes Sav-sav in Seniang, Le-saw-saw (in Atchin), and Le hev-hev (in Vau) . . . (Sukwe came from) the Indonesian word semba, 'to worship,' 'to honour'. ... As a verb (Rivers 1914, l:64), sukwe, in the Banks' use, means to perform all the rites pertaining to the public graded institution" (Layard 1942:693). We have two questions: if sukwe is the "specter," then what is tamate? If Sukwe is the equivalent of Le-hev-hev, we no longer understand why the latter would be opposed to Kwat, unless it is because the death-ancestor referent of the initiatory societies is the negative being that is opposed to the positive being called Te-ghar (tagaro). 27. The middle road through the labyrinth that gives the dead person access to the ancestrality is also called Li-sevev (Le-hev-hev), according to A. M. Deacon (1934a: 129, 130, 131, 140). How we would like to be able to reconcile all this contradictory information! Let us note only that the path of the soul through the labyrinth appears to be a path of avoidance here, not one of disentanglement; the labyrinth is an obstacle, a mass of lines or paths; the soul has to cut right through it, like a Gordian knot. If the maze figure traces an anthropomorphic outline, then the cutting in two of it could refer to the duality of being that death brings into evidence, here as a challenge (see also The dead one, below). All this is of course hypothetical.</page><page sequence="30">34 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 observed them at the beginning of this century. This closeness was in fact confirmed in Rivers's time by the fact that certain tamate grades, those at the bottom of the ladder of initiations, were clearly linked to sukwe grades: the grades called talo maea, "belonging to the open," pertained, as Rivers tells us, "partly to the sukwe, partly to the salagolo" (the latter being the tamate clubhouse) (ibid.:87). Rivers was aware of how difficult it was to define these differences: "one of the most difficult features of the whole organization which has been described ... is the exact nature of the relation between the sukwe and the tamate societies" (ibid.: 126). But Rivers thought he could solve the difficulty with the diffusion theory that made him famous: immigrant groups (kava people) opposed the native groups (betel people); the two initiatory sequences are divided between the two groups. This thesis has left a strong exegetical imprint on his work, otherwise very admirable (ibid.,11:209-21 3, and passim). Only the high tamate ranks, the tamate liwoa, no longer have any relation, direct or indirect, with the sukwe. Their esoterism is complete, absolute. But now that we have situated the notion of tamate with respect to the notions of tamaniu, tagaro, and vui, we should ask what else is designated by this notion. The list is a long one: first of all, the secret society itself; then its members; the masks; and lastly the dead. Rivers observes that "the object of the tamate is partly disguise, partly to produce fear among the uninitiated" (Rivers 1914:90). Another of Rivers's observations should be mentioned: "the usage of the term tamate at the present time," he said, "has been extended to include hats of any kind worn as the result of European influence" (ibid.:89). Tamate, then, as object and also as presence, is a presence-that-hides, or a receptacle that-contains: mask, headdress, a screen that covers or deforms one's appearance. The identification that remains central, that between the tamate-entity and the initiate who has "entered" the tamate ("I am a dead man who comes back alive" or "I cause to be present, through my own body, that which otherwise would not be present") must imply the following proposition: to be a dead man is also to disguise oneself in order to hide oneself. To be a disguised presence, even if with a European hat, is already to be tamate (yet we must remember that the instrument of disguise is itself the thing disguised).28 The fact remains, however, that the sukwe societies, which make use of disguise, that is, tamate (masks), are not identified with the tamate societies, and the essential difference between the two initiatory sequences cannot be the tamate notion itself, even though conceptually the sukwe dissociate this notion from what they are ? in the sukwe there are tamate ? nor can it be the object, which is common to both (as are one of the objectives and the effect of the disguise ? "to produce fear"). Several indications lead us to believe that the difference lies in the production of sounds ? this production is also disguised. Rivers already noted the increasing complexity of this production of sounds in the ladder of initiatory grades: "Sounds (werewere) form a necessary part of the ritual of the division of the sukwe above tamatsira" [the first tamate rank] (1914, 11:126). Just as in the case of the masks, this auditory apprenticeship is actually a disavowal, consisting simply in getting to know how to produce the sounds (in the same way that in the case of the masks, initiation consisted in learning to make them: "Look here! Formerly you were discontented, you thought it was something good, but look! It is nothing but a stone" [ibid.:102]. The initiates learn that the music is only a fabricated voice, that the sound of the presence of the dead is only an artificial sound: the werewere sounds come from knocking sticks and stones together; certainly it is a racket, but an elaborated racket, and all that is "the voice of the tamate," "tamate language." "When they hear the sound [during the meal shared by the initiates in the society's enclosure, the salagolo], the people say, 'Let the tamate die'" (?bid.:104). What separates the tamate from the sukwe, then, even more than the dance forms, as Codrington suggested, is the creation of sound-noise. What we call music is only this esoteric "fake" ? which also implies that apart from the thanatological secret there be no music. Music is the voice of the dead, a faked voice, contrived by men. It is therefore no surprise that a man reaches a higher esoteric standing when he learns to maintain this void of presence that is evoked by sound. We will encounter again and again this same confrontation with the limits of presence whenever we examine New Hebridean initiatory societies. 28. In Ngela (Codrington 1891:79, 94), the matambala initiatory societies, equivalent to the tamate, organize the rituals on sites where screens of bark-painting are erected ? the voi ? and effigies of the ancestor (tindalo) are exhibited to the women and the noninitiates. Another figure, the kaitoba-vunutha (vunutha designates the funerary site, which Codrington calls the "sanctuary" [ibid.:1 78-180]), is an enlargement of the masks that are called gatu; it is a gigantic effigy that several men carry to the beach and burn. Its fabrication goes back to the ancestor (tindalo) called Siko, to whom sacrifices are made (Codrington 1891:98). These ancestors were invoked during the ceremonies (ibid.:97).</page><page sequence="31">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 35 9. Dialectics and complementarity of the esoteric:, the nalawan In the New Hebrides, the contrast between secular and religious, though founded on a basis similar to that in the Banks, appears less sharply marked. If the equivalent of the sukwe are the nimangki (or maki, mangki) societies, the equivalent of the tamate are several initiatory societies ? nalawan, nevimb?r, and neerew ? whose order and interaction are far from being clearly established. Deacon writes: Unlike the Sukwe of the Banks Islands, there is no secret sound especially connected with the Nimangki of Malekula, nor are there any masks or head-dresses, but the society has its own song-and-dance, niteur, which is performed as a necessary part of the ritual, to the accompaniment of the village gongs. (1934:271) But he adds that alongside these grades there exist societies that "are generally more secret in their nature and in some instances there appears to be a definite connection between the two" (ibid.). The author who has had the most contact with these associations in the New Hebrides therefore recognized what we have tried to show in our discussion of the initiatory societies in the Banks: their imbrication. It will become apparent that the dialectic between nimangki and nalawan nevimb?r-neerew has an essentially symbolic nature, whereas the relationship to the dead, and especially to the polarity between the reproductive and the death cycles, varies according to the type of initiatory society. The following discussion should further clarify the evidence presented for the societies of the near Banks and the Torres. Nalawan societies are found throughout Malekula from the south to the north where, as we have seen, grades coexist with chieftainries: here the ceremonies of certain high grades coincide with the decapitation of the chiefs cadaver. (After the decapitation, the skull is deposited in an ossuary, the ut lalo.) The term nalawan, or nalauen, can designate at once the association and the ghost of the dead man, exactly as does the term tamate in the Banks (Deacon 1934:432-435). Similar initiatory societies seem to exist in Ambrym, but the only strong evidence for their presence is that they use a certain type of bull-roar and three kinds of masks all closely related to those of Seniang, Eastern Malekula (ibid.:xxiii, xxiv, 586, 432-435). Unlike the tamate societies in the Banks, the nalawan cults take place in the village itself. Deacoa recognizes that there is an implicit (structural) complementarity between the nimangki societies (equivalent to the sukwe societies) and the nalawan societies, even though this is not overtly stated. In certain high ranks of the nimangki sequence, for example the nimangki neliwis, there is no doubt about this complementarity (Deacon 1934:385 ff.). And that the nimangki are also "secret" societies, that is, very marked esoterically, is strongly indicated by the existence of a high rank called nimangki tlel, "sacred nimangki" (ibid.:436, passim) in the system that extends through central and southern Malekula. Other similarities between the two types involve the use of the same sacra ? sculpted posts (numboutimbaramp), standing stones (nevet) ? and the performance of the same rituals ? even, in some cases, for the raised effigies (ibid.:385?387). These effigies are called ternes, "a word whose fundamental meaning is an ancestral ghost" (ibid.:435).29 The nimangki as well as the nalawan are strictly associated with funeral rites, which must here be understood to mean: what follows a death, what happens after someone has died. The men of the nimangki are the ones who decorate the cadaver during the first phase of the mourning and who dance for it. We do not know for sure, but it is plausible that the handling of the dead body is the responsibility of the nimangki. In certain nalawan rituals, gourd-drums are played, "cylinders" in Deacon's terminology, which are called temes naainggol and are also used when a man dies (Deacon 1934:391, 535 ff.). We have mentioned that one contrast between the nimangki and the nalawan on the level of the paraphernalia has to do with the use and the fabrication of masks-headdresses (temes mbalmbal), each type of which corresponds to a grade and has a name (ibid.:387, 425 ff.). The distinction is only partly relevant: the high nimangki ranks (the neliwis) also use headdresses, called nekambat (ibid.:426). Progression in the esoteric secret nevertheless remains at the heart of the dynamic of ascending the nalawan ranks. The "extreme degree of mystery," to use Deacon's expression, is reached by the nalawan societies called nevimb?r, as well as by those called nimbe'ei (ibid.:386). As we shall see, the former are involved in the fabrication and exhibition of certain effigies, including the "mummy" of the ancestor Mansip, in which the dialectic between death and resurrection is clearly presented, the latter in cannibalistic practices ? emptying the body of the victim, the viscera drawn out through the anus. But we know little more about these activities (ibid.:229).30 29. In the rituals of the nimangki tlel grade, the temes are placed in the middle of a rectangular enclosure; the numbul ("tomb" [Deacon 1934b:293]), of which the surrounding poles are also called temes, are the poles that hold up the temporary shelter raised during another ritual, the amel nitemes (ibid.:293, 303 illustration). Depending on the importance of the rank, the temes can have either two or three figures (ikikina) painted one on top of the other (ibid.:293, 294). During the first rituals of the nimangki rank, the novice receives the naau, the penis sheath, that has been woven by the women (Deacon 1934b:343-346). 30. Here, and as we shall see, progression in the mystery does not concern only the nevimb?r societies. The question we have to ask now is: are the nevimb?r the apogee of the nalawan series or not? It would seem that the nevimb?r are one extreme of a continuum of</page><page sequence="32">36 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 Then where is the real contrast? In the nalawan rank called naainggol (Deacon 1934:396 ff.), the men sculpt and erect poles for the amel (men's house). These poles represent respectively the "Father" and the "Mother" (ibid.:397). These effigies have small anthropomorphic sticks at their temples, the nimbal nin, "the children." In the same ritual, Deacon notes the presence of naainggol masks (a term that also designates the gourd-drums and a structure with sculpted and decorated poles located at each end and surmounted by small heads used in the same ritual). From this point of view, there is no difference between the erection of effigies in the nimangki and the erection of these other effigies in the nalawan. On the other hand, what is specific to the latter is a ritual, called mbwirmbwir, that takes place behind the amel. In it the temes naainggol cylinders are used as instruments: the initiates see the sound being produced (ibid.:426). Then, in this same liturgy, the napal masks (mbalmbal) come out of the forest.31 Other masks, including the temes popos (Deacon 1934:426) in the naamel limbu initiation rites (in the nalawan series), and the temes nitevis in the ritual called litamate, "voice of the temes" ? during which the initiates hear voices coming from the forest and see an old man appear painted white and wearing a mask ? complete the panoply of characteristic disguises of the nalawan societies. In the nalawan rank called amel sesmandur (ibid.:408 ff.), the participants witness the erection of a temporary facade placed at the entrance to the amel; the same operation is required during the following ritual, the nimbwilei ?mbar leo (ibid.:414, 41 5). The ritual involves the call of the dead man (litamate) (ibid.:413) doubled by the instrumental voice of the temes naainggol cylinders, one of which is enormous, measuring close to 7 ft. The next rank bears the name of the sacrum used in it, the nivir'at, a bier in which a fake cadaver is laid; the cadaver consists of a long yam attached to a stick and covered by a pole ending in a real skull painted red. This is the dead man, "or more exactly the corpse of the candidate stretched on his funeral bier" (ibid.:417). This bier is placed near the naai vor platform, as is the real cadaver during the nimesian funeral rite (ibid.:526). When the following rank is assumed, the numbou timbarap, the first monolith, is erected. The "voice of the dead man" is heard, as in the preceding rituals. Some old members of a particular rank, the nalawan vimbamp, block the entrance of the men's house with bushes. Another old man puts bones and grass in a cylinder-drum (the naainggol, ibid.:422). Next, the naamb mbatambat, which Deacon translates as "eternal fire," is lit, and the fruits are burned in it that had been taboo during the period of seclusion of the initiates of this rank, a seclusion that apparently lasts one year (ibid.:423). Next, masks are set up on the platform in front of the men's house, and men belonging to the rank hide behind them. Two dancers come out of the nearby bush and pierce the amel with arrows. Then the masked men come down from the platform and dance. In conclusion, several comparative observations can be made: (a) Although they are just as esoteric, the nalawan are unlike the Banks tamate in that the nalawan are not fundamentally localized and associated with the nondomestic space, the forest, where the initiation rites take place. It is nevertheless true that in the nalawan initiatory progression, an explicit appeal is made to the wild space (through apparitions, voices, and so on). What is more, reference to the dead man, that is, to the deceased (and not to the ancestor), is ritually clearer than in the tamate. Lastly, we should note that in the nalawan only the objects of disguise, the instruments of the liturgical illusion, masks and musical instruments, bear the name of the ancestor (temes); the society and the members of the society are not identified. (b) As was true of the sukwe/tamate series, it seems clear that the nimangki/nalawan series uses the same sacra: raised effigies, standing stones, and even masks. Likewise, the two societies complement each other more at the top of the ladder of ranks, whereas in the hierarchically lower grades there is more of a gulf and more dissymmetry, which is to say that the separation exists at the bottom of the series but tends to disappear at the top. It is very likely that this interplay between symmetry and asymmetry is structurally crucial. At this point we can only mention it and refer to Bateson's observation (which proved to be right in several respects, but is largely ignored today) that there are symmetrical forms of opposition and diagonal forms of opposition (Bateson 1936). If, however, something of a secular vs. religious distinction applies to the nimangki/ nalawan dialectic, as it seems, the closer imbrication of the two series of grades towards the top of the ladder would imply a kind of absorption of the first into the second, or, in other words, a process of secularization. It is possible, though, that the two series tend to lose their specificity at the highest-ranking levels because the opposition of the two organizational principles loses significance for the "ironic, materialistic spirit" (Deacon 1934:17) of the venerable actors; perhaps the highly initiated elders who have reached stages close to "death in life" (and "life in death") do not find any further need to perceive, express, and organize reality as twofold. which the lesser nimangki constitute the other pole, with the "regular" nalawan and the highest nimangki somewhere in the middle. What of the other initiatory societies, called neerew? We shall return to them in the section devoted to agrarian rituals. 31. Note that the nalawan masks and headdresses are generically called femes mbalmbal (Deacon 1934b:751).</page><page sequence="33">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 37 (c) Following the same line of thinking, we can note that the only irreducible dissymmetry, and therefore also the noncomplementarity, that actually divides the nimangki from the nalawan is centered around the sound-producing objects, the naainggol (whose etymology can roughly be rendered as: "the (this is) holy" (naii, "holy", and ggol, "this"). In other words, the central difference between the two is based in the objects that allow the participants to produce the "voice of the ancestor" (litamate).32 If, therefore, the fabrication and exhibition of raised effigies is common to both series, the difference between them lies in the creation of this particular type of presence, the "presence-of-sound." Yet in the initiatory progressions, it definitely seems that the object of disguise, the mask, is the most important element. (d) The erection of effigies at first seems a characteristic only of the nimangki, but there are significant exceptions, as in the neerew and nogharo rituals (see below), in which male/female effigies are erected. Note also that in these rituals, which seem to serialize in a particular way ritual cycles connected with the agrarian seasons, the men also erect stones (nivet) and carved poles called numboutimbaramp (Deacon 1934:385), a word whose root, ba-ramp, reappears oddly to designate the funerary mannequin, the rambramb. The same is true of the nalawan naainggol cult (ibid.:396 ff.), where the men carve poles marked by different signs for the two sexes (beards, breasts). In the same way, masks are used in the nalawan also at the time of a man's death (ibid.:535 ff.), and these masks are equivalent to the nimangki "tops" (these headdresses are called nekambat [ibid.:426]). In sum, what truly differentiates the two initiatory orders are the musical instruments (except for the vertical drums, which are used by both), those "tools of-sound" around which a good part (the most important part?) of the esoteric knowledge is centered. Thus, in the high rank nalawan mbwirmbwir ritual, which takes place behind the amel, for the first time the initiates see sound being produced by the naainggol cylinder-drums (ibid.:402). This, of course, is in addition to the rest of the ritual, that is, the part of the Temes nevimb?r marionette: plant fibers and gum modeled around a stick used in the nevimb?r ritual; fashioned by members of a male secret society. H: 42 cm (face: 15 cm). Mus?e de l'Homme, Paris (C-64-2113-493). initiation explicitly linked to the cult of the dead. If we recall the question we asked earlier about the sukwe/tamate series ? what connection is there between the dead one-ancestor and the two initiatory societies? ? we can find a first answer, of an apparently explicit causality, in Deacon's remark that the nalawan are the ones who are especially attached to the dead (?bid.:385). But the nimangki, too, are present in the funerary cult. Everything in these cultures is bathed in an all-encompassing thanatology, so that we must look beyond the misleadingly obvious features (secular/esoteric; economic/religious, and so on). Can we say, for instance, that the "most secret cults," nevimb?r and nimbe'ei, are the highest points in the nalawan^. There is no clear proof that this is so, although several indications point in that direction, as we hinted above. Although we must be cautious about discussing the nimbe'ei cults, with their connotation of cannibalism, since we have so little information about them, it appears that they and the nevimb?r are distinct from the nalawan but that they are separate in the same way that within the nimangki grades there is a crucial division between the nimangki tlel (high) and 32. It is noticeable that the term used for this "voice" is not ternes, as one would have expected, but tamate; the lexicology of these cultures is still too poor and ambiguous to permit us to comment on this peculiarity. All we can add is that the object is temes (temes naainggol) and the sounds are tamate, and this is what differentiates the two initiatory series. (For the role of music in the funerary cults of the Solomon Islands, see Guidieri 1980.)</page><page sequence="34">38 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 Spear used in close combat decorated by Janus-faced head; missing horn or hardwood point. North Malekula. Mus?e de l'Homme, Paris (E-77-192-493). (J. Oster) those that precede them. Similarly, there seems to be as much separation between the high nimangki (who very likely communicate with the nalawan, though, as we have seen, we do not know exactly what the connection is)33 and the low nimangki as between the nalawan and the neerew. What we can say very tentatively is that the initiatory order of the nimangki does not seem to have any direct relation with the rituals that accompany the reproductive cycles, human as well as agrarian; rather, from this point of view, the nimangki shift the acquisition of initiatory knowledge to a focus on death, that is, a focus on ancestrality conceived as a gradual process of ascension after death, separated from the "reinvestment"?from the dialectization of that-which-has-become ? in the register of reproduction (or "fertility"). This "reinvestment" instead seems to be the cultic task of the nevimb?r, and definitely of the neerew (the annual rituals as well as the longer, eight-year cycles). As far as the dead are concerned, the nalawan organize evocation rituals in which the return of the ancestors is represented (the litamate ritual; rituals in which old members of the society emerge from the forest wearing the napal mask, emblem of the highest nalawan rank, and mingle their voices, human voices, with the artificial voices of the naainggol cylinder drums, which also "are" the voices of the temes). The fact that the evocation is the responsibility of a man belonging to a high rank of the society compels us to surmise that this orchestration of voices implies, once again, that the disguised man is a temes himself, a living dead man (and a dead living man: the alternative has the same symbolic value). These musical evocations only increase during the other nalawan rituals, the nalawan amel sesmandur, the nalawan nimbwuilei ?mbar leo (Deacon 1934: 408-415); this is true, for example, of the use of the enormous cylinder (ibid.:413) and seems to reach a peak in the already evoked nimesian ritual, in which a sham cadaver is presented to the audience (ibid.:417, 526). Then, in another sequence, nalawan timbaramp (cf. ibid.:418, 423 ff.), the connection between death and reproduction becomes explicit: the instrument that produces the voice of the dead one becomes an ossuary, and the taboo products of the earth become edible and are offered to the dead. Although for Malekula we have only an approximate and fragmentary knowledge of the liturgical aspect of the relationship to the dead-ancestors (and the fragments 33. In the north, among the Big and Small Nambas, the right to wear a Nalanen mask, and perhaps even to "swing a bull-roarer," must be obtained from members of high nimangki rank (Deacon 1934b:432, 433 n.1).</page><page sequence="35">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 39 ?BIP Yam offerings in front of a rambramb, with mourners. Temes images in the background. (K. M?ller) we have are often very puzzling and insufficient), it seems to us that here as elsewhere in Melanesia this relationship to the dead-ancestors is in fact mediated by the relationship between death and growth, in the same way ? and in this equation is all the symbolical and ritual charge ? that the profoundly initiatory nature of these cultures constantly dialectizes the identification between the human-who-lives (and very soon prepares to die) and the human-who-is-dead (the ancestor), who is the initiated man, the man in the process of being initiated: the individual is-and-disguises-himself (his ontic status as initiate does away with the contrast) as the dead-one-ancestor. (e) What makes the two series complementary as initiations is their common reference to the dead one. The handling of the corpse, of the body of the departed, of his presence as it metamorphoses, is the responsibility of the nimangki, whereas his return (as the figure of the ghost) as well as his exhibition as ghost seems to involve the nalawan. This is clearly illustrated by the ritual mimesis of the burial during the nalawan nivir'at ritual in which the bier appears carrying the false double of the individual who, then, in some sense, is a witness to his own burial. From an esoteric point of view, for the southern cultural areas of Malekula where this practice originally existed in the time of Deacon, the place occupied by the rambramb funeral mannequin is both crucial and singular, as we shall see later. With the nalawan, then, a dialectization ? such as we were not able to discover among the initiatory series of the Banks, the tamate ? sets in between the process of death and the reproductive cycle. It is this aspect that we are now going to examine. 10. Fertility and agrarian rituals Fertility, reproduction, continuity, cycle: these are notions and relations that have hardly been treated thoroughly in the Melanesian context. Clearly, what is at stake is crucial, but for that very reason also inexhaustible. It would hardly be possible to discuss it thoroughly in this essay. We will have to be content with merely touching on it, now that certain traits of the initiatory societies in Malekula have, we hope, been made a bit clearer. If we go by the available information, we must admit to an absence of totemism in the northeastern part of Malekula, although it is well attested in the southwestern regions where Deacon worked (Deacon 1934:588-590); there we find bird totems (nimbile), grasshopper totems (naambei), and several plant totems (naur, ninggalat); each clan has its own totem, which is established genealogically. As we have already indicated, the problem of totemism must be posed in terms of "(reincarnation," and this is the case both when the spirit of a dead man (ninwinin) becomes an animal, for example a rat, as in Seniang (in the</page><page sequence="36">40 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 southeast of Malekula) (Deacon 1934:591), and when a human group says that it was born of a female rat (also in Seniang), or from a yam, or from a breadfruit tree. Now, in Malekula, one's archetypal as well as genealogical identity, which can be formulated in terms of totems, is tied to very complex agrarian cycles that Deacon and others after him called neerew. The term neerew does not really designate a ritual but rather a particular attribute "that belongs" to distinct groups ? what we would call a privilege by which adherence to a specific totem is recognized. Yet we don't know which segmentary group belongs to the totem; very often what the literature calls a "clan" is only a group whose kinship is quite vague. What does seem ascertained, however, is that only some of the clans can claim this adherence. Certain officers of the cult involving the neerew assume a function that appears to be hereditary: in southwestern Minwun they are called nemunghut nogho (Deacon 1934: 652). This also exists in the north of Malekula (Guiart 1952:185-187) where there are "clans in control of the agrarian ritual"; here the authority resides in one man, the pela, who not only seems to be opposed to the local chieftainry but even in some respects to override it.34 There are in fact two agrarian ritual cycles in the north, the nal and the xoro. All we know about their periodicity is that they take place during the first half of the year (?) (Guiart 1952:187). The funerary cycle, called tama, follows the other two and climaxes in "a collective technique for invoking the dead called male" (ibid.:206). Even though this fragmentary information leaves us somewhat perplexed, we can assume that these rituals coincide with the annual ones called mwelnggil in the south (Deacon 1934:602-603), "which [are] used," as Deacon says, "for sex and fertility magic" (?). Now Deacon also tells us that these rituals occur at the same time that the bones of the dead are buried (ibid.:604) in the ossuary-home, the nembrmbrkon, which is near the amel and thus in the village, and here we also find the "stone-of famine" (nevet namar), "inhabited" by a powerful temes, the mor vaal, whose spirit (ninwinin) is incarnated there, as well as some fragments of pottery unfamiliar to the inhabitants of the village (ibid.:607). In a letter, Deacon indicates that the ossuary and the objects in it are "connected with totemism" (ibid.:607); we would prefer to say that they are connected to the neerew attribute-characteristic, and therefore to the mwelnggil rituals. As for the periodicity of the mwelnggil in the south and the nal and xoro in the north, we can only suppose that they take place every year. But without specifying exactly where, Deacon mentions another ritual site, the wut moul "sacred place" (?) (ibid.:611), where fragments of pottery have been set, fragments whose shape recalls the shape of the cylindrical instruments that produce the voice of the ancestor and that are called naamboi (ibid.:612).35 This ritual cycle is said to last eight years (ibid.:655-662 ff.). How ? under what conditions ? can the same sacra be used not only in the short ritual cycles, the mwenggil, but also in the long ritual cycles, the nogharo (or nogharo nomur)?. The ritual order associated with the agrarian cycle in Malekula, already fairly complex and difficult to sort out because of the scanty information available, is complicated even further by another annual agrarian ritual called neerew rahulemp, which Deacon describes this way: "when one year finishes, the neerew begins the next" (Deacon 1934:641, 644 ff.). It probably takes place at the time the yams are harvested and is made to coincide with certain astronomical concordances: for example, the new moon (nevul), whose time of rising is calculated by the nemunghut nogho (and also by the pela, presumably) (ibid.:595). These concordances are established through "signs coming from the nembrmbrkon ossuary. The ritual begins when the first garden products arrive in the village (the yams that have been prohibited up till then). There follows a computation of the important dead people belonging to the nimangki societies, as though the order of the nimangki coincided with the genealogical order, the order of cosmological signs with the proper names of the ancestors; this computation is spoken to the rhythm of the drums. The ritual takes place as the new moon rises (from this point of view the rituals in the north described by Guiart could be considered neerew rahulemp), "until it is only a name and a nimangki grade that are recollected in association" (ibid.:642). There is an obvious overlapping between the nimangki societies, the genealogy, the names of the ancestors and the cycle of the growing season. The logho (are logho and nogho one and the same term?) of Melpmes, principal spot in southwestern Mewun (or Minwun) where the logho tilabwe takes place ? Deacon describes it as an "irregular ritual" (?) ? is a site crossed by a path that runs from east to west (which is the path of the moon) and is flanked by two lines of stones "inhabited" by spirits and called nevet muogh, "living stones" (sic). At each 34. Which is to say that in northern Malekula there are two authorities; although the meaning of this duality is difficult to assess, given the scarcity of documents, it certainly causes a perceptible change in the very functioning of the rituals in these regions, as we have already shown. The only hypothesis we can offer is that the authority of the chieftainry may operate in the initiatory grade rituals, and the authority of the pela only in the agrarian rituals. 35. The pottery called naamboi ? not to be confused with the naainggol (boinggol) ? as well as certain stones called "penises of Ambat" and the rambramb funerary mannequins were created by Ambat, or by the five Ambat brothers, who are gifted with certain powers, who are not cannibals, and whom Deacon himself, in a letter (Deacon 1934b:661, 662), associates with the Taghar and the Banks' Kwat, that is, with ancestors and not with "divinities," as we keep hearing in the literature about Melanesia. We have already explored the status of the ancestor at length.</page><page sequence="37">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 41 end of this path stands a stone "altar" (in Deacon's terminology). On the altar at the eastern end of the path, there is a surmodeled skull surrounded on both sides by piles of other skulls. This altar stands on the remains of an old amel (men's house). The relics exhibited on it are those of the dead from long ago. To the west, near the second altar, lies the forbidden area where "two ancestral brothers'^?) and some fragments of pottery are buried (Deacon 1934:649). It is said that this ritual is intended to encourage the growth of the people and the livestock (the same intention, therefore, as the rituals called mwelnggil, which are annual; see above). In fact, what happens during the ritual is that the bones of those who have died during the year are buried (ibid.:651 ) ? or perhaps only the nemunghot nogho dead, the members of the cult (ibid, n.) are buried. It is on this occasion that an amel is built in which men are shut in with a pirogue filled with food (ibid.). During another sequence of the liturgy in this cult, the members must copulate with the women of the area in a dwelling set aside for this purpose, "a practice which necessarily violates all rules of clan exogamy and results in incest with even close blood relatives" (Deacon 1934:652) and is in effect a repetition of the act performed long ago by the ancestor Kabat (or Ambat). One last sequence involves the ablution of the "intact body," uncorrupted, of Kabat butwana baghap, the Ancestor himself ? and of his wife (whose body is kept in a "women's house" of which no more is said [ibid.]). Where this sequence is concerned, Deacon (and also his editor, Camilla Wedgwood) become extremely confused. For example, we learn that the ancestor's body, which is very likely a mummy, is called temes (and not rambramb, as we might suppose); the expression is generic and does not specify anything about the actual symbolic status of this dead presence. A dance takes place in front of these effigies of the couple, "three feet high, carved of wood, and unlike the temes of the Nimangki they have the male and female sexual organs completely represented" (ibid.:645), inside the amel. Afterwards, the effigies are carried to the beach and planted in the sand. This is the closing sequence of the ceremony. Deacon also talks about the nogharo nomur ritual practiced in the central regions of the island (but he observes the same signs for the rituals of the nalawan nevimb?r societies), "the most impenetrable secret of Malekulan culture" (Deacon 1934:655). This ritual takes place every eight years on a forest hilltop site, in the center of which stands the naamel timoul, "the dangerous house" (?) (ibid.:656). The back of this dwelling consists of a pile of stones and skulls. The central poles are called Hambat (or Ambat); the pole at the entrance is called nukumbon nen reran, "post of the sky," and "the post at the rear has growing near it a small coco-nut tree. This is the tree called Hambat, after the culture hero from whose skull it is said to have sprung" (ibid.). The participants in this ritual bear the "title" of Hambat; they organize the gardening work, eat the first fruits together, and offer some of these fruits to the dead. This takes place during a seclusion that lasts about four months, at the end of which time the men carve effigies of Hambat and a woman. These effigies are shown with no music or other sound accompaniment to noninitiates who watch this presentation, silent and motionless, for a long period (?bid.:658, 659). Perhaps we should distinguish two cycles of growth rituals ? the annual one called neerew (in fact, it is called mwelnggin ? here Deacon is wrong) and the one that takes place every eight years, the nomur, IMBWlBWPfeiii?lBp^ :^*^8Bli^P ?^^? ^??WwR A dancer with a torch illuminates the food HMQp 7j^^m?^^-:.'^V;,|^5?

But in both cycles we observe that the ossuary contains a mixture of relics of the dead and material relics (pottery, stones). A ceremony is performed at the time that the remains of recently dead members of the tilabwe cult are buried (the nemunghut logho [Deacon 1934:651, n.2]), and it is clearly a question not only of exhumation and supreme initiation (whence the absolute secrecy surrounding these rituals) but also of the reactivation of what the Malekulans consider essential to the perpetuation of the life cycle.36 Nevertheless, though the nalawan alone are explicitly connected with the dead (and the neerew is considered by the masters of the ritual to be a nalawan), to the extent that the bones are exhumed, what can we say of the nimangki, and especially of the nimangki tie! associated by Deacon himself with the Banks' tamate (Deacon 1934:455)? There is here one important reservation to be made: the members of these ranks are not temes (whereas this identification is relevant to the nalawan ? even though in the north of the island the decapitation of the cadaver of a chief enters into the nalawan ritual [ibid.:707, 708]). Lastly, there is the nevimb?r, the cult directly responsible for the fabrication and exhibition of the funerary mannequins (the rambramb); in Deacon's time, this cult existed only in the south. What interests us for the moment is that Rivers's hypothesis, that the secret societies (tamate) are associated with the cult of the skulls ? a hypothesis that was reiterated without modification by Deacon and was challenged by C. H. Wedgwood, but with no serious argument (Deacon 1934:456) ? does not hold good either to the north of the Banks (except in the case of Ngela or for the main New Hebrides, Aoba, Maewo, and Santo [ibid.:709]): in these areas there is no tamate and no nalawan. But we have to add that elsewhere the "cult of the skull," which actually involves the use of this relic in a cult of the dead, does not involve an initiatory society but only long mortuary cycles (except perhaps in southern Malaita and San Cristobal, regions strongly influenced by Polynesia). For the nimangki, the tlel ("sacred," "superior") series is opposed to the inferior tagah ("profane"?) series (ibid.:436-460). In the nimangki tlel the men receive the penile sheath and other products made by the women; other nisit tlel, "sacred things," are in evidence there too, among them the naai noh, decorated screens, masks, and there must be familiarity with the trees and the animals that belong to the rank (ibid.:439-441) and are also associated (but we don't know how) with sorcery. The tlel ranks are dualistic: in each village there are two antagonistic tlel ranks (ibid.:438). The loghor rituals, which take place at the top of a hill (?bid.:437) and therefore on a site, bring together the novices (novali) and the initiates (nesnen), who remain in seclusion while communicating the knowledge of names and emblems (often geometrical figures). These rituals begin with the temporary exhumation of the bones of a member of the society who has recently died (the bones will be buried later in the ossuary situated in the village amel) (?bid.:447). In conclusion, we have (1) the agrarian ritual and the burial of the remains, (2) the initiatory ritual and the exhumation of the remains before their secondary burial, (3) the ritual of growth in connection also with the burial of the dead, and (4) the nomur, the long cycle, with the lustral bathing of the intact cadaver of the Ancestor, and this appears to be the most important ritual. 11. Effigies: mannequins The remarkable sociological complexity of grade institutions in the New Hebrides is accompanied by a surprising variety of plastic forms ? for the moment we shall say that they are tangible representations in some way necessary to this type of conception of the socius. In this, the New Hebrides are fully part of the prevalent Melanesian plastic mode (with the exception of certain areas situated on the edge of Polynesia, like the southeastern Solomon Islands; here too, however, the Santa Cruz group constitutes a spectacular example of Melanesian richness of representational and decorative forms). The Melanesian plastic mode, as others before us have remarked, corresponds to the specific eidos of this region of the Pacific ? a powerful tendency to infinitely proliferate and complicate cultural forms (this includes everything from kinship structures to religious practices). This coincidence, though in itself not the exclusive prerogative of Melanesia (nor of the Pacific in general), is not self-evident. By noticing it, we should 36. There is here also a "Polynesian" type of dialectization between the agrarian cycle (sowing and harvest), the genealogy, the ranks, and the dead, in which the two extremes meet. The dead are also evoked by name right back to the ancestral beginnings, "where one single name coincides with one single rank" (Deacon 1934b: 643), and that rank must coincide with the lunar cycle and the rhythm of the agricultural season.</page><page sequence="39">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 43 not appear to imply, even intuitively, any simple causal relationship ? between plastic forms and social structure ? nor should we let it lead us to formulate some hasty, "strong" hypothesis that would go beyond the available evidence in searching for the origins of the correspondence. Sociocultural complexity and richness of plastic variation being both products of the same culture, it is tempting to interpret both objects and institutions from the same perspective; if we can't help detecting connections, we should at least beware of anthropologistic arrogance, of being too confident in the power and possibilities of our heuristic devices. The questions raised by this coincidence remain nevertheless valid, and they may turn out to be of primary importance in attempting to understand these cultures. Among the Malekulan Nambas, as well as among other groups on the same island, despite the overlappings and complexities mentioned in the sections above, the effigies fall into two categories: the funerary effigies associated with the nimangki (also associated with these are the other wooden and stone objects and the individual ornaments attached to the grades) and the masks, bull-roars, and flutes associated with the nalawan. As for the drums, they are used just as much by the nimangki as by the nalawan. Here we shall be only incidentally concerned with the nalawan, for the simple reason that they do not seem to play a major part in the funeral rites. On the other hand, the effigies associated with the nimangki have a well documented relationship with the production of the funeral mannequins (rambramb), which are the starting point and the focus of our study, and this relationship calls for some clarification. These effigies, carved out of tree ferns and familiar to museumgoers all over the world, do not form a real class apart from the other standing objects (stones, or "dolmens" as the literature calls them) that dot the Malekulan forest (especially in the center and the north) on the outskirts of the villages. There seems to be a correspondence between the shift from perishable material (fernwood) to stone and ascension from the lower into the higher ranks of the hierarchy, even though this follows a pattern that is not strictly linear everywhere: alongside the individual's progression towards a more permanent state, the "living dead," another progression is articulated in the mode of representation of the dead-ancestors, starting with the elaborate and multicolored tree ferns decorated with zoomorphic elements and ending with simplified Rambramb. Feather ornaments are insignia of passed grades. Two small heads over the shoulders are said to indicate pertinence to nalawan grades. (K. M?ller) sculpted stone stelae.37 It seems that there can be no doubt that the register of material ? soft to hard, live to dead ? was used widely in most of the archipelago to mark grade progression. Deacon writes that there is considerable uniformity in the rites and regalia belonging to the graded society in all the islands of the North and North-Central New Hebrides. In many of them, as for instance in Raga, Santo, Malekula, and Ambrym, 37. "A man entering one of the lower ranks erects an image of tree fern, or of some other wood, but as he attains to a higher rank the image is of stone, varying in height from about 3 ft 6 in to 5 ft, and for certain intermediate ranks the wooden post is enclosed in a circle of small monoliths. The use of stone in the Nimangki seems to be of significance, associated as it always is with the higher grades" (Deacon 1934b:273 [emphasis ours]).</page><page sequence="40">44 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 rv T5- ^ * Two rambramb, leaning against the screen behind which they will first appear, are watched by a man of very high nimangki rank. (G. Liotard) there is a progression from the use at entrance to the lower ranks of wild canes, through Erythrina, cycas, and crot?n as the scale is ascended, until for the highest some form of stone-work is set up. (1934:707) The erection of effigies sanctions the progression of the individual through the ladder of ranks. The mannequin and the other effigies that accompany it, the ones that we have called "marionettes" (temes nevimb?r), will only be shown after his death. One rank, one effigy for the already-dead; a newly-dead man, his ghost mannequin after his death. These are the terms. All are ?mages of dead men.38 The mannequin, however, is an ?mage in a more extreme, or more literal, sense than the others. It imitates the appearance of the dead man with remarkable exactness, or at least presents a likeness perceived as striking. Portrait and simulacrum, the mannequin is built upon a true relic of the dead man ? his skull. As such, it seems to reflect a desire to compel 38. The funeral mannequin (rambramb) is not found on the east coast of Malekula nor on other islands of the New Hebrides (Ambrym, Pentecost, Aoba); see Guiart (1949), which also gives the best available formal description of existing types of effigies and their distribution throughout the archipelago.</page><page sequence="41">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 45 and ensure the dead man's presence. This double nature ? ?mage that resembles and relic ? presents problems that are quite special within the domain of Melanesian funeral cults. Nowhere else is a modeled skull associated with a mannequin that exactly reproduces the proportions of the dead man, body and head. The closest we come to this is in certain regions of the Sepik, where the skull may be exhibited adorned with plant decorations or set on top of bamboo poles (we also find this in the south of Malekula).39 Among the Nambas, the reconstructed features of the dead man are primarily intended to evoke him through resemblance. What are then the principles governing this singular plastic creation? We think that one answer may lie in the relationship between the nature of the relic ? in this case the skull ? and the intentionality expressed by the mannequin object. The skull-relic here is the actual substance of what the general aspect of the mannequin is trying to express: again, resemblance, that is, an appearance that duplicates the appearance of the dead being. On the other hand, the Malekulan relic is a skull that is detached from a cadaver and is modeled every time it is used to complete the mannequin. Without the skull, this figure would have no power to evoke. But what exactly is a relic ? and what is this relic? Without the working over (the surmodeling), the bare bone is only imperfectly a denial of the reality of death ? of the total corruption and dissolution of the dead-body. And being a skull, being a durable (though anonymous) residue of the dead-body, it also cannot lay claim to being anything but an image of this kind of anonymous permanence. As remains, it can only affirm that the annihilation of the body is never absolute (we could say that matter is the residue of spent energy); it cannot say that these remains refer to an identity, nor that they are the duplication, the reappearance, of the being who has disappeared. The relic always remains the remains. But this culture (like all those for which the advent of death and the advent of transcendence coincide, that is, all the cultures of Melanesia) integrates into its vision of the human cycle the inevitable corruption of the human as presence, as body, in death. This is what the funeral rite is. The body rots with the knowledge and within sight of everyone. Whence the question of burial, a question singularly unanswered among the Nambas. There are no sites. The communal ditch in the center of the nakamal is forgotten at the same time that the traces of the residential place disappear. There are no tombs, no places where the dead rest, places that are remembered because they contain bodies that have disappeared. In this case, memory applies itself, even more than elsewhere, to the thing that figures as the remains of the dead. The ?mage itself, ?n part, ?s then both the "altar" and the tomb: the altar, as receptacle and support of the relic; the tomb, as place of remembrance and forgetting. With no tomb and no memorable resting place for the dead, it is their remains that receive a special symbolic treatment that results in the mannequin. This, in a way, stands in place of the home of the dead, since it does quite literally contain the remains: the skull. Of course the mannequin is not a mummy; its body is not genuine. This comparison however allows us to see what makes the mannequin something other than simple effigy-remains, or object. It is in effect a relic that is invested with a resemblance. If, then, the remains are used for anything, it is not in order to deny or reject the process of corruption but to go beyond it through a technical artifice that reconstitutes the appearance of the dead one onto the remains. In this way, the Nambas' solution reverses the dialectic of the pure relic and suggests another representation of death: Several rambramb planted on the dance place, after going over the screen. Food offerings of yams have been left in front of them. (K. M?ller) 39. Yet in the famous example of latmul, photographed and commentated by Bateson, there is clearly a concern for resemblance. (Bateson 1936). In this example, we have "a woman once famous for her beauty and for her remarkably long nose" (an aesthetic feature much prized by the latmul). The image in the photograph reproduced in Naven is, in this respect, strikingly "realistic."</page><page sequence="42">46 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 Rambramb alignment in front of the screen, with high grade dancer carrying temes spear in his right hand. (K. M?ller) no longer the final state of the living being, but rather a transitional phase, a phase that comes before the one that will take place beyond the ritual, in forgetfulness, and in which, as we shall see, identity is transfigured, passing from resemblance to emblem. The affirmation of belief, articulated through the cult of the pure relic, is one through which an inescapable fact ? the annihilation of the being ? is rejected. The sight of the relic denies that the body has been annihilated. "The body is still here." Now, when the remains also bear an ?mage and when this ?mage recalls to mind the appearance that is no longer, the rejection of the annihilation of form is expressed in a very different way. Not only because that ending is denied, but because the creation is intended to evoke a form that will now be the visual memory of the being who has disappeared. Two kinds of memory are expressed this way. Perhaps what really allows for the conception of the mannequin is not truly a claim to embody an idea of permanence beyond corruption. On the one hand we have the skull, a substance with which a personal identity is associated; on the other we have in the clay modeled over the skull the memory of an identity to which one attributes an appearance. Thirdly, there is the makeshift body, which bears grade (nimangki and nalawan-nevimb?r) insignia, as an evocation of the social identity of the dead one and the memory of a (temporary) void in the ranks (more on this later). But the duration of visual memory is short. It would even seem that the Nambas want the permanence of the relic in the actual obliteration of the memory of the appearance. Because the rambramb, the semblant mannequin, will not be made and brought out for very long, in the shaping of it and its subsequent destruction and discarding is a kind of dramatization of the natural fading of our memory of departed human semblances. A confirmation of what we are suggesting might come from the relative idealization of the portrait manifest in all the mannequins that we have observed (especially those that figure in the Mbogote ceremony). Although the modeling of the funerary images is supposed to be so realistic that the women scream in fright at their reappearance, the heads of the mannequins actually possess almost heraldic faces whose prominent characteristics and individual features are softened and stretched into smooth surfaces from which almost all chiaroscuro has disappeared. The addition of color increases the effect of depersonalizing the portrait while probably reemphasizing social identity (grades, etc.). A striking contrast can be clearly seen in the photographs of rituals in which mannequins appear. Whereas the individual personality and dignity of the officiating members of the cult is strong and marked, the nobility of the rambramb is rather haughty, distant, and in some sense faded. As ghosts showing themselves to the mourners, the dead are already beginning to move away, their particular features freezing and wilting into conventional traits. As in the portraits of many Roman emperors, idealization suggests an emblematic fading of personal identity.</page><page sequence="43">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 47 12. Effigies: emblems The written and visual information available to us seems to indicate that the mannequins enter and exit during the funerary ritual according to a strict order. During the night, these figures appear in a group illuminated by torchlight behind the fence built especially for this performance, in which they are the principal characters. At dawn, a second class of figures, the temes (or marionettes ? we shall return to them), are manipulated so as to beat down to the level of the fence certain shrubs protruding above it like a kind of inverted curtain (they have been stripped bare except at the top) and that had seemed to be preventing the effigies access to the place of the dance (nasara). When the mannequins finally step over the fence, carried by the officiating participants, they are brought to the place of the dance and are planted in the ground. The temes remain behind the fence and conclude their pantomime, whereupon they disappear from sight, descending behind the fence. These effigies, the rambramb and the temes, are always associated with each other in this funeral ceremony. If the temes always precede the rambramb in the ritual sequence, and in some sense take on the role of introducing them into the scene and into the place of the dance, on another level we have already seen that the production of effigies is connected to entry into a grade, a process for which the mannequins and the marionettes seem in some sense to constitute the necessary point of departure. For to offer up an effigy when ascending in rank is another way of referring to a dead man, a way distinct but not unrelated to the use of the mannequin ?mage of the funerary ritual because this "ancestor" has of necessity previously been a corpse and then a mannequin. Conversely, by offering up effigies of grade, the man entering it can guarantee that one day he will become a mannequin ? one day he will return as an apparition in a ritual of mourning, playing the part of the one who-resembles and according to his ancestral state. What, then, is the role of the temes in the ceremony, and in the cycle initiated at the moment of death by the deceased? We can suggest that the temes constitute reduced ?mages of the dead, images that have some relationship to those that were erected during the life of the person who ?s now dead. More precisely: the temes permit the dead man to return again (and again?) after his first ephemeral reapparition as a rambramb. To return as an effigy, of course. This close association is already made explicit in the rite by the place that the Rambramb. (K. Muller) marionettes occupy to the side of the rambramb: they (literally) pave the way and thus make possible the climax of the most salient part of the ritual ? the advent of the dead among the living. Note that they never pass beyond the screen: unlike the rambramb, they do not return, but only make an appearance. Thus the funerary ritual, particularly in this crucial dramatic phase, constitutes, together with the grade system, particularly in its nimangki-nalawan dialectic, a veritable play of mirrors where dead presences and their more or less ephemeral effigies appear and disappear. A man without rank is a naked man.40 Perhaps we ought to be more specific, now that we know that what 40. Deacon tells us that a man without a penis sheath ? that is, a man before circumcision ? is a naked man. A new sheath is acquired with entrance into each grade and at death (Deacon 1934b:565,</page><page sequence="44">48 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 wBmjM^s ^^ *M Mage newurwur: large effigy sculpted out of the trunk of a tree fern. These images are made upon the acquisition of a new grade by a man and situated around the dance place, near the men's house. H: 270 cm. Mus?e de l'Homme, Paris (C-30-51-493). is done over and over again in the grades is to erect effigies: a man without rank, could he exist, would be a man severed from mortuary forms. To accede to the ranks is to don a sort of clothing. But the adornment first relates a man to an identity different from his own, since he is erecting the effigy-figure of a dead person. It may be (we cannot be sure at this point) that the individual fills the vacuum left in the rank by one who now remains only as an erected effigy. If this is so, the purpose of the proliferation of images will be easier to understand: the images bridge the discontinuity brought about by a substitution of identities. It would create a parallel ranking progression, but in death, through a progression of effigies. As we have hinted already, what happens when the work of mourning stops, when the effigy of the dead man appears as a mannequin, is none other than a visualization of the process by which the memory of him starts to fade. But once this obliteration has begun, it also punctuates ? still through ?mages ? the ritual work that effectively relegates the dead one to an irreducible absence and replaces him with the man who, by erecting the dead man's effigy, occupies his place in the grade. At the conclusion of a life well conducted through the ranks, the human being is transformed into a ghost-apparition, a mannequin, present in the form of an effigy that resembles him and carries hidden inside some of his substance. This is the "true" effigy through which the dead man, in the process of becoming ancestor, engenders other effigies, erected in his memory by the living. This progression represents a passage from resemblance to symbolism. After the rambramb, the effigy of the dead man no longer has to be a resemblance: it must reappear, but its unity and identity get refracted into several copies that will act in concert with the new rambramb, who always will end up occupying the foreground in the scene. We can now suggest that the erection of effigies marking the accession to rank not only gives the man who enters the rank the right to become himself an effigy, that is, a mannequin, at the time of his own death, but it also gives him the right, as a consequence of this, to enter an ideally interminable cycle of reproduction of ?mages through which, after his death, he can be assured of remaining as an emblem 578). Each passage from one condition to another is treated like a reiteration of the initiation of puberty, and the network of grades, as we have seen, is coextensive with the fabric of adult society, including the realm of the dead (as effigies and as mannequins).</page><page sequence="45">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 49 The screen after the rambramb have gone over it. The upper part has been knocked down by the small temes images visible in the background in order to permit the rambramb passage. (K. M?ller) appearance among the living. This formulation might seem to contradict the fundamental principle established in the beginning, the principle enjoining that the dead man be forgotten. For the interminable reproduction of images can only perpetuate his memory. Strangely enough, however, in time such reiteration flattens the represented entity. In effect, if every individual, having become a mannequin, receives posthumous homage through an object that evokes his past appearance, this same individual, having later become an emblematic effigy, blends with those that have already been erected for the other dead of the same rank. The effigy then becomes an image sui generis and no longer designates a specific man, but instead designates the grade as a whole, to which all men belonged who are 'remembered' by emblematic representations of the same type. Thus, the effigies, these shadows of men, as evocative as they are ephemeral, constitute nevertheless a reality that is in some sense conceived of as more authentic than the one in which their makers are immersed; they could be thought of as "shadows of their shadows," if it is true that they are the shadows of the mannequins as the effigies are reflections of the identity the dead being had acquired in his effigy erecting progress through the grades. As we have seen, the elaboration of the effigy-forms appears to follow in some cases a progressive order that proceeds from something elaborately modeled to something very spare. At any rate, this order leads these same forms to assume two different temporalities: like the mannequins, the multicolored fern effigies are displayed only for a short time. In the progression, as stone replaces wood, so the power to defy time ? that is, to endure ? belongs to the monoliths, whether elaborately sculpted or not. Thus there are two very distinct variants of temporality. In one, time lengthens only through the reiteration of erected ?mages, that is, through repetition. In the other, the objects will be reproduced in all likelihood only in very long cycles or, in any case, their duration will be independent of the cycle of their reproduction. We can illustrate this by the following chiasmus: modeling of the / spareness of the represented form / represented form permanence / decay The diagram only describes the two structural possibilities of the development of the effigies. In reality, of course, we ought to imagine a spiral instead, the image of true progression, if we want to picture the entire diachronic nature of the process.</page><page sequence="46">50 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 Temes ?mages peeking over the partly knocked-down fence. (K. M?ller) 13. Effigies: marionettes They accede to a new rank and they erect an effigy: as they rise, they acquire insignia. Their passage is adorned by objects raised for the dead. Each transition very likely follows a progression from wood and polychromy to stone and spareness. But most prevalent are the multicolored tree ferns. We know that these, though at the bottom of the ladder of ranks, all look more or less alike, are recognizable by signs, emblems or glyphs carved into the abdomen-pubis area. In fact, viewed from the front, the middle of the torso is a plastic synthesis of the abdomen, the pubis, and the sex within a glyph emblem (which is usually a reptile, a lizard, or a squat snake).41 The question is whether the emblems refer to the rank of the man who is acceding to it, and if so, whether the effigy is specifically associated with a dead man who once belonged to that rank. This hypothesis seems likely to us; we know for certain that the emblem is associated with the novice. If this is correct, it must be assumed that the novice's tribute to the dead of the rank, the erection of "his" effigy, constitutes at the same time what guarantees the dead man's survival in the order of appearance and the novice's access to the same kind of survival. We may, then, be able to formulate a general, if at this stage hypothetical, "law" concerning Malekulan proliferation of ?mages, as follows: The erection of effigies marking accession to the ranks not only gives the man who enters the rank the right to become an effigy himself when he dies, that is, first of all a mannequin (rambramb), but also, because of this, it gives him the right of entering an ideally interminable cycle of reproductions of effigies through which the human being can guarantee that after his death he will remain, perhaps forever, among the living as an emblematic appearance. There is another aspect of the previously mentioned register of duration that adheres to, even reflects, the dialectic that exists in the hierarchy of ranks: in the two orders, which overlap, of ?mages and of men, this aspect reveals a progression from multiple to single. In the lower ranks, the multiplicity of images corresponds to the greater number of men who, in all likelihood, manage to belong to them. As the ladder is climbed, 41. Several accounts, including Huchet's and Liotard's, and especially some raw data provided by Guiart, describe tree fern sculptures endowed with pronounced male sexual attributes (erect penises) and even two effigies, male and female, copulating (a theme that recurs in the poles of the men's huts in the northeastern Banks, in certain areas of Santa Cruz ? especially Santa Catalina ? studied by W. Davenport). Given the present state of what we know and the limited aim of this essay (which is to point to some principles for a first systematization of Malekulan funerary plastic representations, particularly of Malekula), we cannot give a full account of this blatant sexualization of some images.</page><page sequence="47">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 51 both the images and the members of the ranks decrease in number. Lying between the reproduction of semblance (the rambramb mannequin) and the production of the series of raised effigies that represent, without resembling, the dead, the temes has mediating functions. It seems to mark the point where the reproduction of semblance stops and the production of effigies begins. About this we can make two observations: as we shall see in more detail, only the temes are present ? and in great numbers ? at the ritual scene where the mannequin appears (the raised grade effigies only occur at the outskirts of the village and into the forest). Now, we have seen that the temes (whence the expression nevimb?r, which usually designates them: temes nevimb?r) are creations that belong to the other series of ranks, the nalawan, which, according to the ethnography, do not take part, as such, in the funerary cycle directed by the nimangki ranks. It now appears that this view should be qualified. The nalawan leave a mark on the nimangki through explicit intervention at two decisive moments in the ladder: in the initiation phase, before the entry into the ranks, when the young boy undergoes the important rite of passage that introduces him into the society of men and hence into the progression of grades and initiations, when he learns the first great part of the men's knowledge (flutes, rhombs, etc.), and at the rambramb ceremony, which could be viewed as a kind of initiation into death. If the rambramb is an object that incorporates an actual head and an artificial body, the temes is an artificial head without a body. The head of the temes corresponds to the body of the rambramb: they are both artificial. Following the temes, one finds this chain of effigies that are, in toto, "false images" ? nothing but effigies. From this point of view one then might ask if through the ternes a process is not set in motion that consists of arriving at the effigy. This, beginning with the resemblant image of the mannequin. Furthermore, the face of the temes is that of a grotesque figure that is the true negation of resemblance. It is as though the human image, losing the support of the skull (and thus, lacking the relic) and stripped of any resemblance (that is, of any reference to the appearance of the dead person), evoked attributes of the human being but that these attributes were dissociated from one another, that is to say, stripped of the specific organicity that connects them within an identity, be it an individual one, an idealized generic one, or a formalized emblematic one. The temes, however, cannot be said to be grotesque like a caricature or a stereotype of deformity. All that can be said is that they are immediately recognizable, that they have a peculiar style of sardonic spookiness about them, and that their nonorganic appearance is heightened by the accentuation of certain function-related organs, most Five temes ?mages near the shed where they are made.

Effigies: temes morphologies The custom of concocting a funerary mannequin topped by a surmodeled skull was, in Deacon's era, limited to the southeastern area of Malekula. Moreover, the skulls of the dead were deposited in ossuaries distinct from the common one that received the rest of the skeleton (Deacon 1934:518). Today these effigies are found all the way up to the central regions of the island. A questionable report affirms that in the north a rambramb was made upon the death of a chief. Everywhere else, the skulls were piled up "in miniature stone chambers in sacred places" (ibid.:586). Deacon observed that when there is a death, the dismemberment and decapitation of the corpse takes place about ten days after the death and that the disposal of the "fresh" skull in the naghamel tup, the "house of the skull," occurs in conjunction with a nalawan grade ritual (?bid.:583). Beforehand, the relic is placed in a receptacle, the noon nimbatim temes, of which we know absolutely nothing. The funerary mannequins wear on their bodies the emblems of the nimangki rank as well as those of the nalawan and nevimb?r grades of the dead man; these are in the form of painted decorations, small modeled heads, rings and tusks, feathers, and so on. Deacon is explicit on the rule that enjoins a symbolic reciprocity, which we have already had occasion to underline, between the mannequin and the effigy that was set up at his (last) grade accession: each man, he says, will have at his death his own rambramb if he has purchased and erected "a certain carved image at entrance to one of the nimangki grades" (ibid.:544). In the south, the making of a rambramb seems linked to the "secret" nevimb?r grades (we don't know under what conditions or circumstances) of which the lower rank is called neleng nimbe'ei (ibid.:461). This rank and its ceremonies seem confined locally to Seniang and to Port-Sandwich Bundle of three temes sticks. (K. M?ller) (ibid.:467) and appear connected to a vast "mythological cycle" centered on a relative (awut) of an ancestral personage, Mansip, and on his descendants? "all of them ternes," as the natives declare. At the time of this ceremony they hear the noise of the bull-roar, "the voice of Nevimbumbaau," "the wife of Mansip" (ibid.:462). The "rotten" effigies of Mansip's descendants, temes marionettes, are destroyed on the same occasion and replaced by new ones (hundreds of them, Deacon says). There follows the putting to death of Mansip and his two mates; these three figures are represented by seated effigies that recall, by their size, the rambramb (but without the surmodeled skull, it seems). An informant explains it thus: "This is the resurrection (of three beings)" (ibid.:462), which could be rendered as: the ritual death of the represented beings announced their return. This putting to death is preceded by the erection of a shelter in the forest to be used as lodging for the women of the 42. The head of the temes, unlike those of other effigies, is a hybrid: half human, half animal (it often includes boar tusks). It seems to us that this particularity relates to the esoterism of the nalawan grades and reveals a plastic intentionality the other effigies lack: that of including in the representation a nonhuman referent singularly absent from all effigies belonging to the nimangki, with the exception, of course, of the animal figure often carved on the abdominal-pubic area of the tree fern sculptures. But in these we have juxtaposition; in the temes, fusion.</page><page sequence="49">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 53 group, outside the village, which is occupied by the men and their ritual preparations: construction of new palisades/screens around and close to the men's house and the fashioning of new effigies in great numbers (the temes marionettes, most likely). Mansip and his two companions, seated mannequins, are placed outside the palisade so as to be seen by the women during the ritual. The other effigies, the temes marionettes (also called temes nevimb?r), will appear in the course of the ritual behind the palisade. They are made by the men. They say that the new marionettes are the ghosts of old ones: "The temes come out of old temes like worms from a corpse." The heads of the marionettes, shrunken heads, are later placed on the main joints (shoulders, arms, elbows, legs, knees) of the rambramb of a man of many grades at the time of his 'funeral' (ibid.:465). In a sort of pantomime, the temes nevimb?r, departing from the amel (men's house), are hurled in the air by men hiding behind the palisade. Other men dance on a floor that has been placed over a pit where other marionettes have been interred (ibid.:466). Two other temes nevimb?r, placed above the main palisade, which conceals the entrance to the men's house, are shown in the act of eating (?) (ibid.:467). Mansip and his mates are riddled with arrows, then burned, along with the screen that hides the officials and hundreds of temes nevimb?r. The natives give the following singular explanation of this sequence: "It's 'the same as' the litamate (voice-of-the-dead) in the nalawan rites" (the calling to the temes to be at peace by a man hidden in the neighboring forest) (ibid.:406, 467). Here again, information is most scanty, and even at times contradictory. What one could say, perhaps, by way of hypothesis, is that a symbolic equivalence between two rituals is proposed: the auto-da-f? of the effigies that are themselves the product of a thanatological metamorphosis (generation is born of corruption), in which the three principal characters (who are, because of their construction, quasi-funerary mannequins) are "killed" so that their return is assured ("This is the resurrection"), and the evocation of the voice of the absent. It must be admitted that the precise dialectic of these equivalences remains ? and doubtless forever will remain ? indecipherable. Moreover, all these scattered bits of information still shed no light on the crucial relationship between the two main types of effigies at play in this class of rituals: the mannequin and the marionette, the relic-images and the spirit-images. And one is led to suppose that the term designating the marionettes (temes, temes nevimb?r, etc.) is only a generic term, probably employed to conceal their true and specific (probably esoteric) names from the ethnographer, since ternes, as we have already seen, designates different kinds of effigies as well as the ancestral spirits represented. The notion of effigy, in the sense of "presence which-represents," central as it is in the cults ? the beliefs ceaselessly have recourse to these forms, which are conceived as necessary representative mediums ? is no less approximate and opaque in its "theoretical" uses of the day, as in the classic ethnographic descriptions such as those on which this essay is based. In anthropology, this notion has not been the object of any real attempt at definition that was not either na?ve or tautological. We might in this respect take up again, on our own account, the Wittgensteinian objection that R. Needham so opportunely applied some years ago to the notion of "belief" and suggest that the term effigy, or the term image, serves to fill a notional void. This void is all the more serious because the concept of effigy is truly crucial in the studies that claim, at close or distant range, aesthetically or sociologically, to define the "function" of the objects to which the term refers. Genuine screen-concepts and for that very fact false concepts, effigy and belief, whose complementarity is in no need of proof, must, if one wishes to use them judiciously and profitably, be founded on general studies of the nature of concepts, without which there could be no serious investigation of religious forms. What we put forward in this part of the essay must be considered a still very tentative sketch for a definition whose full formulation is yet to come but that has very ancient roots, particularly in Hegel's philosophy of religion and in some of his followers.43 As we have just seen, when one consults the ethnographic literature.of the New Hebrides, one observes that the notion of effigy (object that refers to ... ) sums up the principal symbolic correlations of the sacra and almost all the crucial moments of the ceremonies proper to these cultures: correlations between dead man and ancestor, between ancestor and 43. We mention Hegel in particular because of what the philosopher has described, especially in relation to the Greeks, as the "Religion of Finitude" (or "Aesthetic Religion"), where he makes luminously clear both the gulf (nondialectical complementarity) and the conflict (dialectical complementarity) between object and concept We might add: it is this philosophical tradition that, starting from the Philosophy of Religion, gradually breaks down the Hegelian scheme, which opposes Symbolic Religion (Judaism) and the Religion of Revelation (Christianity), and which leads to Feuerbach's critique and Stirner's paradox, shattering the significance of the subject-object duality in the religious realm. Let it suffice to say here that our advocacy of a r??valuation of Hegel's philosophy of religion implies that the positivist approach, so long, so deeply, and so noxiously uncontested and influential (through Durkheim much more than Comte), should be called into question and the idealist contribution at least brought out of its long concealment.</page><page sequence="50">54 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 initiatory rank, between the modalities of acquisition of initiatory knowledge and the rites that accompany them, and, finally, between presence and identity ? this last correlation being probably the most important since it is that on which all the others are implicitly dependent. One could, on the other hand, postulate that the use of the notion of ternes (a notion so all pervasive that it becomes ultimately troubling, as we have just seen in the case of the relation between funerary mannequins and marionettes44) brings into evidence the deep question posed by the relationship between presence and identity inasmuch as it can be said to coincide essentially with the ontological question of Absence (and hence, also, it concerns the modality of absence in the mortuary cults of all the rest of Melanesia). It appears that it is within the presence absence dialectic, and within a thanatological 'strategy,' that cultures of the New Hebridean type confront the problem of Being. It must be noted at once that the majority of Malekulan objects that are "not utensils," if one gives credence to the authors consulted, seem to belong to one and the same class, that which is called temes; sculptures in tree fern, posts and bamboos that surround the sculptures at times, temporary shelters (amel nitemes), and others still: all, including the funerary marionettes, are temes (Deacon 1934:297, 303, passim). If we translate this term, according to ethnological tradition, simply as "spirit" (or "spirit of the dead"), we cannot understand what distinguishes it from the other thanatological notion that accompanies it: tamat, amat, hamat, tamate, which designates also the spirit of the dead. Deacon says that the original sense of temes is "ancestor-spirit" (Deacon 1934:435) and that amat, too, is temes. One is forced by this point of view to hypothesize phonetic equivalence: ? temes=tamat ? which seems to us at least doubtful. Let us note nonetheless an important notional and symbolic trait: no effigy, except for the mythological ones present in the nalawan cults that we have just discussed, is ever called tamat (or any dialectal variant of this same root). Furthermore, the flutes, as well as the bull-roars and the masks (used in the rites of nalawan and nimangki), are generically designed as temes. Only the funerary mannequins, with their relic-heads and the stones, standing erect or not, monolithic or not, are not temes. There remain to be considered the "bodies of ancestors" exhumed in the neerew rites, which we have already mentioned: to be precise, these effigies are seen and handled not as effigies but as "mummies," bodies of the dead that have escaped putrefaction. Let us try to bring some order to this diversity of presences. We will suppose first of all that only certain ancestral reincarnations are temes, that is, "ancestors." Or, more precisely, that the ternes, as forms ? as effigies that refer to ancestrality ? are the very doubles of the original ancestrality that is called, as an adjective or a noun (by a proper generic Name), amat, tamat, tamate, and so on. This hypothesis would be convincing if there were no other classes of effigies having a relationship, either close or remote, with death and, above all, with ancestrality than the ones so denoted. But this is not altogether the case. We have just mentioned the masculine and feminine mannequins of the nalawan rites ? these are a conspicuous exception. One should add to it that paradoxical presence so familiar to us by now, namely, the returning ghost, the rambramb mannequin. It matters little that this practice of "partial mummification" was, in Deacon's era, distributed only in the southern regions of the island. In spite of diversities, the Malekulan cultures share an incontestably common trait: namely and precisely this manner of bringing out, so to speak, the problematic presence of the absent by means of effigies. It is this common preoccupation that explains, at least in part, the noted "plasticity" of practices that facilitates borrowings like the funerary mannequin by the cultures of the central regions of the island, strikingly attested by the Mbogote rituals of the early 1970s; photographs of these rituals accompany these pages. If we were to suggest a simple juxtaposition, aiming at a mutual identification of the entities, between the effigy and the deceased, we would be contradicted by the data. We learn, in fact (Charpentier 1979:139, 182), that the "spirit" of man is called (we suppose in the sense of pneuma and psyche) ninwinin (very likely a local version of the trans-Melanesian notion of nunu, nunui: "shadow," double of the human being") and not temes or tamate. If the term for "living" ("being alive"), mough (mourri in other Melanesian versions), is the opposite of the term mate, "dead" (or "weakened life"; cf. Charpentier 1979:182), then what can be said of the notion of tamat(e), of which the prepositional particle (ta) ought not greatly to modify the basic meaning of "life in the waning"? Perhaps this: that the effigy-evocation, or what is alleged to be such, as well 44. We do not know, for example, if the effigies of Mansip and his wives are called temes or in some other way (they look more like rambramb but they are not funerary mannequins).</page><page sequence="51">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 55 as the false mummy of the returning ghost (rambramb), belongs to this modality of the (human) presence irreversibly detached from the mough state but that nonetheless preserves the possibility of being, of "being presence" precisely. Are not these the eidetic stakes of "belief in the dead" ? this otherwise unthinkable project of making presence coincide with absence? But if this is true, it still remains to be explained why all the other effigy-presences, which do not convey, either in part or in whole, a notion of the deceased as a nondecayed body, are called temes, meaning "ancestrality." We find once more the notional ambiguity between dead-absent (temes, ancestor-spirit) and dead-present (effigy), a kind of ambiguity that does not occur in regard to those other effigy-presences that literally and "realistically" bring on the presence of the body that has been shed ? that is to say, those that bring forth a dialectic not of the dead person but directly of the corpse (one would have liked to know the native word for this type of presence, if such a word exists, besides rambramb). We can nonetheless note that the doubles (of the dead body and of the ancestor) are effigies in the sense that they are the supports on which these evocations depend. In temes, we have a singular conceptual identification between object and referent, or object and concept: the effigy is the ancestor, as if the one and the other were only one and the same presence. In the relic-image (rambramb and several other figures that are closely related to it), we witness, in contrast, an identification between this partially absent, or on the way to becoming absent, object that is the corpse and a presence that is the imitation, in the realistic sense of the word, of this same body on the way to disappearing. Here there is no identification of the referent with the image; there is identity of the body (and its semblance) with its presence, denoting a perhaps disquieting, contradictory, and transitional state. This is why perhaps the rambramb are speared ("killed"?) towards the end of the ceremony. We find in these two examples a manner of conceiving the presence that is admirably rendered by the pidgin expression "behind true." It is a question of presence, of presence at any cost, battling against what for these cultures is the gravest of losses ? the absolute, irremediable absence of the dead. This in turn triggers the theme of reincarnation, in itself comprising an astonishing variety of "illusions of. presence," including, and chiefly, the illusion of permanence in death, which of course, in this as in other thanatologies, is much more than a mere "return." 15. Two transcendences That women are necessary to the ritual scene, principally when the major happening of a total fiction must figure in it, such as, in this example, the staging of ghosts in the guise of mannequins, is clearly evident in the Mbogote funerary rite where the relatively passive presence of women is the condition by which the return of the dead, as "pseudo-dead," or "pseudo living" (the two definitions are, by reason of the dialectic of contradictions, which is the property of this ritual, equivalent), must be dramatically recognized and Temes nevimb?r marionette.

The women attest, if only because of their viewing it, that the advent of the dead is possible and real. Very likely, their function as witnesses follows from their role in the belief (here, the belief in a post mortem state where disappearance becomes return). The question is complex, and we can only touch on it here. We would surmise that this essential role of women is not explicitly recognized for the very ideological reasons that "justify" the ritual: because the esoteric knowledge acquired by recurrent initiations, the matrix at once of the fiction of return and of the fiction of the mortuary effigy, is precluded to them.45 It is the men who create this fiction, just as they do with all the fictions that sustain their initiatory progressions. The women submit to it. One could then ask if, setting aside the young, credulous, yet noninitiated males, the fiction upon which the mysteric experience of the men is founded is not destined above all for the women. In other words, the question here is the role of the "public" in archaic "theatrical" (epiphanic) ritual. The exclusion of women from knowing the secret ? it is thus that the Law stipulates the gnoseological distinction between the sexes ? does not we think imply that they truly "do not know." The contrary is obviously true, since it is in the women's quarters that the first phases of mourning have taken place. Here, as in other similar cases, belief does not rest on na?vet? or on unknowing blindness: sophisticated fiction is in fact the support of belief. The women then must also know, but their knowing is nonetheless of a different nature from the exclusive knowledge of the men. One could designate it, in relation to the first, as exoteric. But that would be insufficient. Let us say rather that the knowledge is empirical knowledge: acquired "obliquely" by the discoveries that the women, no matter their age or circumstances, are bound to make. This acquisition, not mediated by an initiation, is inevitable in spite of the prohibitions and the secrecy with which the male actors and elders like to surround their mysteric actions. This knowledge is, then, immanent; it turns on the factuality of the initiatory experience, on the concrete conditions that facilitate the production of the transcendence represented by the return of the dead. But, because of the conditions that help to constitute it, this knowledge is also implicitly and tacitly a transgressive knowledge: acquired but silent, won by infringement of the prohibitions that deny its existence as well as its possibility. Let us add that thus constituted it receives in return an implicit sanction on the part of the men: the men pretend not to know that the women know. The men act as if the women do not know, and the women know that the men act in view of preventing them from knowing. The process of belief is largely a tribute to this double game of pretence, and it is on this register of implicit symmetries that the action of the men effectively mediates, in being directed toward the women, its own fiction, the fiction of credulity, an attitude, again, ritually necessary to the maintenance of belief. In consequence, the singular position of women in the process of belief, both in the preliminary phases (in the Malekulan case: all the initiatory s?ances up to death; hence the bulk of grade-accession rites) as well as when the men effect the "incredible" ? but expected ? return of the dead, is both central and paradoxical. The statement "They know but they must act as if they did not know" sums up the entire intellectual tour de force that bears the name of "belief." And it is remarkable that this is utterly assumed by the women. Let us further note however that, in one respect at least, nothing seems to radically distinguish the women from the men. The men also, in reality, are within the belief, since they are within the fiction. They are its masters and actors; they live it as completely as an actor who loses himself in the role he is playing. It is they who "create" the fiction; they carry almost to the limit the act of "make-believe." They fabricate the pretenders, the mannequins. All the while, what separates these two classes of "false-deceived," the actors of the deception and the unduped-duping spectators, respectively, of the trickery that orchestrates the entire dialectic of belief, are exactly those two forms that modulate the two relations specific to belief. The one, explicitly striving toward realization ? a fiction prepared down to its most minute details (for instance, the tremendous importance given to the resemblance of the surmodeled skull), necessitating a performance, a participation devoid of all hesitation or doubt (without, however, that na?ve desire of ours of achieving persuasion through precision, "perfection"), this to the point of living this fiction as if the other completely assumed the modality of "not-knowing"; the other, implicitly striving to fulfill the essential function of support in the utter pretence of a not knowing that, nonetheless, is indeed a knowing, a 45. There are vague, obscure references to the existence of women's grades; we know nothing about them, and if they actually exist they do not seem to have the same connection with funerary rituals, with the ancestor-making process.</page><page sequence="53">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 57 knowledge that is all the more radical for its transgression but that takes the form of a passive acceptance of the unattainable character of the knowledge of men. Without this differentiation, without this diversity in the approach of this essential knowledge, the representation in which the dead return would not be possible. Let us further note that this positioning of the women in the process (rite) of belief is, from our point of view, a decisive structural trait of many other ritual practices, not only Melanesian. What can it mean, then, to "know" in the register of the esoteric and, more particularly, in the matter of the funerary mannequins, of the "ghosts" of Malekula where the effigies, made by men, constitute their supreme "secret"? This question implies another: Why do the men need this fiction to receive the sanction of the women? The stakes, perhaps, of this fiction ? in which men act and women feign submission ? only reiterates a basic split according to which the sexes, in their respective ontogenetic positions, are driven to an impasse in their necessary cooperation to the great matter of existence as reproduction: ontogenetically, women and men scarcely do the same thing. It is women who hold the power, major and real, of generation and reproduction. It is women who naturally exercise this power, and this is an irreducible necessity. We are speaking of effective power, real power ? and one must add, nonritual power, power outside all fiction, all representation. Power that, imperturbably, shows itself in the reiterative cycle of life. Men are, or consider themselves, basically strangers to this; that they are not unessential, from a strictly biological point of view, is here of little importance. Furthermore, to speak of biology when discussing the representations of life in these cultures has little meaning: the sole distinction that is pertinent for them is between visible (gestation) and hidden (conception) causes. The eternal debate in anthropology on the "ignorance" that traditional cultures ? especially in Oceania ? may or may not have of conception processes seems to us, as it did to Leach, rather outdated. This debate would only make sense if the problem were symbolically posed in biological terms, which is not the case: the essential point is that the men attribute to themselves a role of pure safeguarding, of nurturing of the fetus during gestation, and leave to the women all the responsibility for the absolute beginnings of conception. They themselves produce only fictions ? in our case, fictions that strive, at every death, to prove that the dead can return among the living. There, in their fiction, is transcendence. If it is men, consequently, who act outside the sphere of necessity where mastery pertains to women, it is remarkable that this transcendence, which belongs to them exclusively ? opposed as it is to the factual reality of reproduction, which is of the domain of women ? is made and built on the women themselves, in the presence of women. Transcendence would not be such, the fiction would have no "efficacy," if those who are there to recognize it as such, who both judge it and do not judge it, did not submit to assuming the role of the passive, outwardly credulous witness. For the absolute to flourish, there must be this suspension of judgment, this relativization in which no one, however, remains beguiled. 16. Staging In the course of the ritual in which, in all likelihood, members of several ranks take part (nimangki and nalawan), according to the modalities, obligations, and precedents of which we remain largely ignorant and in which for the first time the mannequin of a recently deceased person appears, flanked by other mannequins of those who have died at an earlier time, we witness a redefinition of the spaces that constitute the usual environment of traditional Malekulan social life, as we have briefly described them in the first sections of this essay. It is, considering the unusual place that the mannequin holds within the entire series of effigies, a fact worth dwelling on that this transformation occurs at the very moment when the presence-of-the-ghost makes its first appearance. Let us designate the village as A and the surrounding forest as B. We have already seen that A is normally subdivided into two main areas ? we shall call them A1 and A2 ? which are the two hierarchical subsets of A; A1 ?the masculine space (the men's house and its environs) ? dominates the other ? the feminine area. This domination expresses itself in negative terms: A1 is accessible only to men and forbidden, consequently, to women. No subdivision concerns B, the forest, although this space is characterized by places or enclosures that are defined, marked off, forbidden, by esoteric signs. The initiatory activity in connection with the nalawan, nevimb?r, and other such societies fluctuates (more here than for the tamate societies of the Banks) between a "secrecy" at the very interior of the village, sheltered and protected by the men's house (and in consequence of this fact, in a sort of initiatory promiscuity with the nimangki societies) and what one might call the initiatory "exile" to the sites at the heart of the forest. What appears evident at first sight is that space A, the inhabited space, is intrinsically twofold in nature, whereas</page><page sequence="54">58 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 Space B, the wild area, is intrinsically univocal. Unequivocally, there is an explicit separation between A1 and A2; they are spatially cleft by a visible trace. The boundary is the permanent screen that sets off the dancing place (nasara). Other screens may exist in addition, combining and intersecting with each other to perfect the major division. (For very detailed observations on this point, see Guiart 1952.) At the time of the funerary ritual when the mannequin appears ? this ritual, let us note, is not a ritual of grade accession but a ritual for all grades, a ritual, then, that brings together what otherwise remains rigorously segmented ? one observes that A1 expands. It clears a part of space B (in the course of the night the men increase the space towards the forest by cutting and knocking down small bushes and trees). This supplementary space, retrieved from the forest, is scoured clean and then set off by a new screen. Such a screen is indeed a boundary, but solely for space A1 ; for it is A1 that alone penetrates and appropriates a part of B by overcoming its original boundary ? the extreme boundary that separates the village from the area that does not belong to men alone.46 The initial ritual stages, as described for the 1974 ceremony, can be summarized as follows: (I) The first apparition of ghosts ? the new mannequin accompanied by the old ones that have been reconstituted for the occasion from the preserved, surmodeled skulls of the deceased ? in the newly laid out space, which we may now call space B1, this being subtracted from B. This first apparition, which occurs in space A1, but an enlarged A1, can only, we think, be meant for the men who already occupy it. The ghosts enter the masculine precinct and come from the forest whose borders have been pushed back for this purpose. (II) The male ghosts, confined to the space from which the women are, by definition, eidetically and spatially excluded, nevertheless appear to them from afar. These two stages must be envisaged, liturgically speaking, as consecutive ? the appearance of the mannequins comes after the opening of the space carved out of the forest, just as their presentation before the women comes after the screen that closes off this space has been partly demolished ? and it is useful to recall side by side with them the two sequences of the first "funeral" of which they almost seem to be a reversed or mirror image: 1. The dead person, as a corpse, is left with the women to dry. There it loses its flesh; it metamorphoses; it loses its appearance. 2. It comes back "dry," as it is said (the corpse is smoked), from the women's sector and is decapitated by the men. Its skeleton will go in the communal ossuary of the men's house. The body is then decomposed a second time, in the sense of being divided up: the skull inside the house, hung on the roof-poles or placed in the hut built for this purpose, and the skeleton in the ossuary. Now, finally, the dead man, reconstituted as a rambramb, reappears to the women for the first time as a ghost, as though coming from the forest. The funerary process, in short, first takes charge of the dissolution, corruption, and dismemberment of the integral, lifelike appearance of the corpse and then of the recomposition and reconstruction of this "same" appearance until its dramatic epiphany in the rambramb ceremonial. In (partial) conclusion: (A) Normally, village spaces are articulated around a strict duality that constitutes order, meaning (no matter how arbitrary its ultimate foundation) in the life of the community. On the advent of death, reenacted at the time of these secondary "funerals" where the dead change into ghosts, a new hierarchical division intervenes, which can be expressed as follows: before after men women dead-men men women (1) (2) (1.1) (1.1) (2) "Before" (meaning before the ritual), then, can be read as "1 is superior to 2" (a hierarchical duality). "After" (meaning after and because of the ritual), the duality becomes a triad, which can be read as "Male dead superior to males who are superior to women." But since, as we have seen, it is women who sanction the return of the dead men ? by "recognizing" them ? the dead men can be said to depend on the women, and the model becomes circular: a rigidly dualistic and hierarchical structure is mediated, at least in the operation of transcendence, into a ternary (and transitive) model. 46. One would like to know, in this respect, how, in these societies, the process of the acquisition of garden land takes place, especially in relation to those parcels whose harvest is destined for the sustenance of ceremonial participants. For it is clear that here, as elsewhere, one does not encroach on the forest with impunity. Everywhere in cultures that practice shifting agriculture, the appropriation of a parcel of forest or the reinvestment of an old parcel that has lain fallow is seen and interpreted as an intrusion for which symbolic modalities of setting off, and of compensation, must invariably be provided. It would be instructive to compare these with what happens when the intrusion is cultically motivated, as m the case we are examining here.</page><page sequence="55">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 59 Rambramb and temes, close-up. (K. Muller) (B) The screen installed for the rite in space A1 is the double of the fixed screen, which separates on an everyday basis (that is, apart from the time of ritual) spaces A1 and A2. This duplication of the separation conceals a necessity. It remains to be seen just what that may be. Let us first note that the permanence of the screen that divides the sexes points in special terms to an ?nstransitive relation between them in which the men can go across the screen anytime (and in particular to perform the sexual act, which cannot take place under any circumstances in the masculine precinct), whereas such movement by the women is barred. This is a spatial symbol of the superiority of men: the men, one might say, "can get around." We note next that the ritual screen is not permanent. Since it is part of the ritual, it does not belong to the order of everyday life. But ? such an unusual feature deserves to be mentioned ? this is the only screen that is, at any time, stepped over: in the ritual sequence that concerns us here, the mannequins, lifted up by the men, are passed over the barrier that has not been demolished and set up on the place of the dance. The demolition of the upper curtain of shrubs by the temes can perhaps be seen as a reenactment of the original clearing of B and a step over from B to A. If this is true, then the edge of the forest ? its circle around the village spaces ? is indeed in itself conceived as a barrier, a screen between two worlds, or rather between two basic modalities of the world. (C) The central screen is internal to the order of daily life, in that it represents it in a permanent and visible way; the ritual screen separates order from nonorder (the forest); the central screen is a diameter (it crosses the circumference of the dancing place) of a single surface, axled for separation, a separation that signifies order. Order is implanted on a surface that is empty in comparison with the fullness of the forest. But the boundary that defines the passing from full to empty is not positively marked: there are no barriers, and so the full runs the risk of encroaching on the empty. In the rite we are considering, the inaugural act consists of recreating the emptiness inside the full: to take an emptiness from the full and at the same time to set off the empty space thus created by a cleavage analogous to that which signifies order in day-to-day life. The ritual act consists of increasing the empty by encroaching on the full, but only in order to immediately partition this new emptiness. (The transformation of the dead ones into rambramb and then into ancestors implies the incorporation of a portion of the forest, realm of the spirits, into the order of the living, just as the survival of the society of the living rests on the periodical clearings for new gardens and villages.) It is in this way that the screen we call "ritual" sets a new boundary only on the specific masculine space and creates a threshold where those who return must appear and those who have remained can welcome them.</page><page sequence="56">60 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 This new emptiness, space taken from the forest, becomes the stage for beings (temes) who are supposed to inhabit the forest. In such a way, the new emptiness is filled by these personifications of "free," "natural" space. We have seen that the screen that separates masculine space from its new "accretion" is the one overstepped by the mannequins/ghosts with the aid of marionettes (see the activity of the temes, which consists of felling the shrubs placed at the top of the screen). In this sense, the ritual screen appears, then, as a symbol of the invisible but nonetheless real ontological boundary between the arbitrary emptiness of human space and the given fullness of the surrounding forest, which partakes of the necessity of what is independent of human will and intervention. This realm of fullness, of necessary completion, is also the realm of death. 17. The dead one The dead body in Malekula, as refuse and as presence, is ineluctably driven through mutations that must transform it into a represented presence, the effigy. A classic development, one must add, in a good many Melanesian cultures. But it would be mistaken to claim that the only outcome of this process is the represented presence, the figure that is set up near the living as "definitive," unchanging. The relationship between the dead body and the body of the effigy does not exhaust the particularity and complexity of this permanence of the dead, because it is precisely at the moment of the inevitable scission, brought on by death, of his presence as being that the human reveals his double constitution ? on the one hand, the presence of an identity that is a "thing" (body, effigy); on the other hand, that other presence that is only representable by a sign-concept, such as "spirit", "soul", or some denomination of that sort. Thus, we shall say that the correspondence between the dead and the effigy (of the dead) concerns only one aspect of the total human presence struck by death, and in the Malekulan case that we are examining, the limits of this correspondence manifest themselves in the fact that the dead one does not fully exhaust himself as an entity in his displayed "sculptural" image. The funerary ritual that is dedicated to him contemplates not only the departed returning as the dead one47 ? the mannequin the dancers finally set up on the plaza ? but also the choreographic representation of the tortuous course of that part of him that cannot be embodied in the rambramb toward and through the labyrinth where the soul-devouring ogre awaits it, according to a myth widely known all over the island. The dance depicts the staggering, uncertain movements of someone struggling to escape from a net in which he is fatally enmeshed. Its title, "the bird dance," seems to allude to the difficulties of the bird-soul grappling with the snares of the labyrinth. Let us underline that all this, lacking more precise ethnographic confirmation, is at present only a hypothesis. Yet this is likely: on the one hand the dead man, as a body, "returns" among the living in the shape of an effigy (rambramb) and (partially) with the substance of a relic (the skull); on the other hand, in the middle of the very ritual where this form of his presence becomes again visible, "his soul that takes flight" toward the labyrinth, its ultimate crossroads, is also represented.

(Guiart) 47. We use the (somewhat awkward) expression "the dead one" to cover the meanings of tamate, temes, and the like. In the Romance languages the word mort has varied connotations that seem closer to those covered by the Melanesian root word, going from the body of the deceased (its physicality, the corpse) to the soul and the ghost (revenant). It is perhaps interesting that in English no such word exists, except in a collective plural (the dead) in which the knot of values embodied in the individual human presence and problematicized by its disappearance are not expressed.</page><page sequence="57">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 61 .^% ?Sr-S?

(Gaillard) invariably ? let us not forget the meticulous character of Melanesian thanatology ? that the post-mortem being not only preserves but brings to an extreme expression the fundamental cleavage of the human presence. Let us further note this: what "returns" is the effigy, which, as presence, both denies the death of the human being and dramatically points to it. The mannequin, literally, as much as the mummy, is a dead-living, or, as we have said before, a dead man who returns, an odd presence encompassing in itself an irreducible coincidentia oppositorum. In a way ? in this way to be exact ? which we usually designate by the empty formula of "post mortem state," the mannequin perpetuates the same order in death as the erected fern effigy does in life ? that is, the order of grades. The body and the head of the effigy wear the emblems of the rank of the deceased: this order seems to transcend death. As a living-being before death, one might say, the man leaves the place that he occupied among the living, but in the guise of persona he returns to it in spite of his death. That is the rambramb: presence and sociological summary of the human being as a figure marked by the vicissitudes of his progression through the grades. But that other human modality, the spirit of the dead, which cannot be confused with its presence as persona, becomes this "depersonalized" entity that, without the insignia of rank and without a body,48 flies away dancing and must face the snares of the labyrinth. So far Malekulan thanatology the "soul" can be represented by another person, another identity ? the dancer ? (we could say simply "by Another") while the social and personal identity of the departed remains consubstantially attached to the body (and to its image). But the body is not whole, not even as a relic, in death, and its dismemberment (skull vs. trunk) indicates perhaps that its ?mage, a sign of its social identity, is not irreplaceable. It appears to be in some way necessary that the wished-for return of the dead one be accomplished without danger of its becoming a "real" one; that he return, but forever deprived of his unity. Just as the soul of the dead man will never return ? at least in its pristine identity (here we touch on the major and in this case, again, quite delicate question of incarnation, already evoked in a previous section) ? so the body, henceforth, is a represented body that is made out to be a "ghost." The living, the women 48. It is interesting to note, however, that representation, in any case, needs a body, here that of the dancer, and that the feather grade insignia on the head of this one might still refer to the rank of the deceased if they are not the dancer's own, which we do not know.</page><page sequence="58">62 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 Surmodeled skull before its combination with the reconstructed image of the body and grade insignia. (K. M?ller) especially, are necessary witnesses to this return ? somewhat grotesque, as any evocation of the "spectral," but for the men who bring the image right up to the dancing floor, this is also definitely a "thing," made with mud, plants, and dyes. We shall return to this. The mortuary rite in which this reapparition, this presence, is central directs its action, at first, to the body of the deceased, works on it, mutilates it to fashion from it a figure whose body is false and whose head is "true" ? it is, it contains, the skull of the deceased. It is interesting to observe the contrast between the very delicate plasticity of the surmodeled head and that, which one could describe as gross and undifferentiated, of the reconstituted body of the mannequin ? plastic surgery vs. artificial limbs. As mentioned before, the headless body, the rest of the corpse, whatever remains of it, goes to rejoin the other skeletons in the common ossuary. Is there here perhaps a desire to recognize an undifferentiated communal body of men, a "common substance" that underlies the differentiation of ranks but still does not cease to be distinctly separate from the sphere of women? In some sense the common ditch (the bone cache) stands for the undifferentiated masculine element, possibly in its energetic and reproductive connotations, just as the ranks reflect the masculine identity in its internal articulation. In the totality of its course, the ritual in which the rambramb makes its theatrical "return" reveals the multiplicity that constitutes the human being, conceived of as a precarious unity that becomes decomposable from the moment of the event ? death ? that actually cracks its seemingly monolithic nature, the temporary density of the body-persona. But the ritual does not confine itself to admitting and confirming the chasm within human nature and, thereby, to problematizing the question of presence. Recognizing that this is not reducible to the question of the body, the ritual favors the representation of death in two distinct figures. On the one hand, death in the shape of object: a material representation (inanimate or animated only by the fiction of the rite) ? according to the triple physical modality of the skull-as-relic, the usage as semblance, and the false body as portmanteau for status and esoteric insignia ? that we call the mannequin, a visible ghost, a figure designed and built to be displayed and manipulated. On the other hand, the embodiment of the spirit of the dead one, but only as the invocation of an intangible entity: this is the dancer in the "bird dance." We will provisionally conclude here with some remarks on the effigy of the dead man, on the return of the persona of the ghost as object. 1. The relic ? in this case, the skull ? is the result of a set of intentional actions specific to this thanatology, actions that govern the transformation of the actual skull into a surmodeled skull (a skull covered grades nakamal, amal OSSUARY grades</page><page sequence="59">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 63 with clay and colored dyes, the modeling materials) that is accepted as "true" semblance. By this transformation, the perishable aspect (the flesh, let us note, meaning the wrapping that constitutes the visible aspect of an individual) becomes fixed and (relatively) imperishable. Stated another way, oblivion ? the loss of semblance ? is conjured once the appearance, the make-up that must last, is fixed. Forgetting is not eliminated, but is delayed until later when the grade effigy, replacing the mannequin (as we have surmised), will reduce semblance to an emblem, presence, to the sign of a vacancy. 2. The real body (head excluded) of the dead man (the body-as-cadaver) constitutes the focus of another plan of belief that is necessarily connected within the preceding inasmuch as the two, joined, share a part in the making of the mannequin. This plan of symbolization rests on the following proposition: the ghost body shows itself as the double of the true one; it presupposes the total annihilation of the real body of the dead man. There is a body-effigy inasmuch as the true body is destroyed (by decay). The false body of the mannequin is the support of the only true relic of the dead man, that part of the effigy that is embedded here as an essential element? that is, the unalterable skull. The destruction of the body-effigy after the ritual use to which it is put in the funerary ceremony illustrates eloquently its character of instrumental object rather than relic. However, the roughly modeled scarecrow that is combined with the head of the departed carries, as we have mentioned, all the crucial grade insignia (with the exception of some of the feathers). Thus, the Stretcher and superimposed grill supporting the corpse after its return to the male section of the hamlet. (G. Liotard) Corpse lying in state inside the family dwelling. Penis wrapper and all ornaments are new. Circular ditch is meant to receive body fluids. (K. M?ller)</page><page sequence="60">64 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 aim of the utilization of the false body, support for the relic, cannot truly derive from a desire to fix the likeness of the dead man, but rather from a desire to visualize his social identity at the moment of his death. The head, by means of the resemblance obtained or intended, evokes and fixes the corporal specificity of the dead man. If there were many individuals of the same grade, there would only be one with this very face. To this visual specificity of the resemblant false visage corresponds the real presence, concealed by make-up, of the skull-relic. The body contains no relic, has no substance and no true resemblance, except to a set of roles, of functions and relationships, the grade Dancer representing the progress of the soul of the departed toward the Land of the Dead. (G. Liotard) system, which is the supporting skeleton of these societies Its destruction may also point to the impermanence and interchangeability of the social persona. As semblance fades slowly into genealogical distance and oblivion, social role (grade status) has to be refilled. 3. The second figure of the dead one is played by the dancer. The dancer, as we have said, evokes the dead one, meaning that it represents his absence: namely, his death. If one could note earlier that the identity of the dead seemed almost entirely assumed within and by the object-mannequin, one must suppose that only a residue of it could remain. What is left of a dead man, when the body is not there, is nothing but the "idea" of him. To which, perhaps, the bird dance alludes, since the only movement impossible for human beings as far as the body is concerned is, precisely, the act of flying. In this regard it can be said that the object-of-presence is constructed metonymically, and that it is by metaphor that the spirit-flight into absence is evoked. 18. Resemblance and identity An inanimate body, a presence that has lost its pneuma, is a form that alters itself all the way to its dissolution. The absence of the spirit threatens the form and, beyond that, eliminates the presence. A given that is evidently universal. We think that it is on this given ? and not on a true concern for "the destiny of the soul" with its panoply of redemption and damnation ? that the majority of archaic thanatologies are founded. It is a question, as a matter of fact, of conceiving a kind of freezing ? of preservation ? of the presence in order to foil its irreversible obsolescence. The stake, in other words, is not "the soul" but the presence itself. What happens, then, to a body that no longer contains its pneuma if one wishes to save it from dissolution? Melanesian thought, in its Malekulan version, brings to bear a response ? cultic ? by conceiving a fictitious presence, in this case the rambramb, which we propose to describe with this formula: The identity of this body, otherwise called the persona, becomes morph?. Let us try to be more precise: the identity is preserved, en route to being forever lost, through the fabrication of a presence, here a false-body, which is nothing but presence. Hence the importance that the morphological coincidence between this substitute and its referent assumes. The astonishing concern for realism in the reproduction of</page><page sequence="61">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 65 the face of the dead one on the rambramb mannequin clearly stems from this. Note the inversion in this "morphic" solution to an ontological problem: the threat borne to the body by the metamorphic process of death is fictitiously thwarted and imaginatively neutralized by a presence that imitates what is no more. It is clear ? and in Melanesia this is attested in areas where the production of mannequin-mummies is very rare (that is, everywhere except in the territories of New Ireland and in certain areas of the Sepik) ? that the "realistic" effect, impressive as it is, would have no reason to exist if the thanatological interest were focused on the other constituent of the human being, its pneumatic attribute as spirit-shadow (nimbiwin, meaning that "which is no more" or, to use the Melanesian formula here, that "which is mate" ? outside life but not, for all that, lost). In Malekulan terms, then, the evocative object would not be a semblance, a mannequin, but a "marionette," or any other effigy of the temes class. It is significant that not at any moment, if one can rely on the available ethnographic data, is a rambramb called a temes, despite the fact that both are effigies, of the dead one, as the literature says. It seems that the specific modality of the presence of the mannequin is that of an entity constituting not so much a portion of the person (the relic-skull) but the person as presence (as opposed to the person depersonalized as ancestor, hence as absence, in the temes). We can then complete the previous statement, "identity becoming (that which is only) presence," in the following manner: To be able to produce "effigies-that-resemble," it is necessary that the matrix ? here the human being ? be emptied of what makes it human, its pneuma. From the form-identity, where matter is determined by the pneuma, one ends up with a form where matter dominates absolutely: as we have said, identity is reduced to morph?. Here we touch on a point that appears to be of theoretical importance to us, but whose validity, nonetheless, remains specifically dependent on the cultural configurations that we are examining. We cannot consequently generalize it, but we shall retain it as a revealing indicator of other configurations, considering that in the Melanesian context the wealth of effigies is nourished, one might say, by a common thanatological substratum that is also relatively homogeneous ("ancestor cults"). We would venture to say that the initial surge that leads these cultures to create imaginary presences (which in another era one would have called "fetishistic") not only tends to effect, in the most obvious manner, a substitution between two forms ? one present only as model and memory, the other as replacement? but also perfects a process of imaginary (or rather "imagistic") compensation triggered by the shock of that phenomenon of dematerialization, which death, in substance, represents. The result of this is that the production of objects ? effigies and, in particular, the funerary mannequins of the Hebridean type ? hovers in an ontological realm where not only do presence and identity enter into conflict, but where, one must add, the problem that we express in terms of absence and of presence, otherwise stated as the absolute of esse and nihil, is posed (for us probably in a manner always original because it is forever "inaudible") in terms of presence-to-be-regained, of changing presence, and thus also of process of substitution. It is a question of a dialectic of presence and absence that sustains the negation of negation: absence is to be thought of only as a phase of transition to a new presence, and so on. As we have already had occasion to state, to consider the pneuma or "spirit-shadow" as the active energy in the living body does not imply that the cleavage between (a) body and spirit be preserved, or even accentuated, in death, as is customary in our Western conceptions. It is perhaps the reverse in many archaic cultures. If the spirit leaves its anthropomorphic bodily sheath, it is only because it can be "incarnated" in others. For us, a logically "scandalous" ubiquity that we call animism, totemism. But in this case, very likely, it is hardly necessary to save identity by resemblance. Identity, here ancestrality, literally traverses forms, dwells in presences, as it is said: tree, animal, stone, and so on. The Malekulan case, in many respects ethnographically too uncertain to give conclusive weight to these remarks, seems to maintain with this polymorphism, otherwise so widespread in these areas, varied and even contradictory relations. It has actually already been noted that in and by the initiatory societies of the principal nimangki and nalawan variants, the relation to ancestrality not only pursues a program of explicit identification between the initiated and the ancestor but also gradually introduces the individual, through the stages of initiation, to that esoteric knowledge by which the food taboos that preserve the mystery of the totemic incarnation are lifted. It is in this sense that we have made our own the remarks of Codrington and, even more, of Rivers, on the relation between initiatory societies and totemism, incarnation, identification, and the cult of the dead. The novelty of Malekula, unique even in the whole area of the Motlav-Banks-Hebrides, lies precisely in this</page><page sequence="62">66 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 recourse to the effigy resembling the dead man, the rambramb, which, logically, ought to modify substantially the totemic "solution" to the problem of identity. It is certainly in any case a singular symbolic "preliminary" to the totemic forms that in all likelihood exist in Malekula, too, if we may believe Deacon as well as Layard in this respect. We nonetheless prefer to let it rest here. Let us close for the moment by restating a basic point. Mythology, especially as it relates to the Mbogote funerary ritual where the mannequin appears, seems deliberately to infringe on the principle of ubiquity proper to totemic discourse. The spirit seeking a way out of the labyrinth through the "bird dance" executed in the presence of the mannequin is plainly a revelatory presentation of what the animistic argument neglects: the sempiternal flight of spirit-persona. For not only is the soul not within the mannequin; as noted before, the mannequin (morph?) and spirit (dancer) coexist on the stage, but as an unresolved duality. The ritual unambiguously expresses this split duality within the human being, which transcends death in two registers, two represented forms. Pneuma and body, spirit and dead one, separated, come face to face. It is our basic contention that in Malekulan (and probably in most other Melanesian) thanatological systems the resolution of such duality lies in the totemic order. 19. Vanishing people The classical works describe the situation in Malekula from the beginning of the century up until the thirties. Deacon and Layard describe the societies on the island in an era when the ravages of white colonization were already considerable. However, the native cultures even today show great complexity and richness. The majority of their institutions, although already threatened, are functioning (forms of marriage, extension of the kinship area, obligations between kindred, land rights, birth rituals, agricultural rites, etc.). This is not lost on either the actors or those who record them. But their vigor could be a convulsive movement in the throes of death. The demographic threat is already great: the population, decimated by disease, is dwindling. In 1970, the traditional inhabitants of the interior were reduced to groups of survivors whose numbers did not exceed a few hundred. The Mbogote numbered no more than 200 in 1974. Their survival as a population was placed in grave jeopardy by a deeply unbalanced sex ratio. Women are rare, and those who agree to live in the interior according to the traditional mode are even more so. In the meantime, it is in these precarious survival conditions that the ethnographic knowledge of these cultures has been increased, as is the case for the new documents that prompted us to write this essay. Neither Deacon nor Layard could witness the making of the effigies, particularly of the rambramb, and their ritual use; a new kind of collusion between native and intruder, archaic and modern, had to develop in order to make this possible. It is significant that this should be on the brink of a certain kind of dissolution. The recent discoveries should arouse questions and doubts ? not as to the competence and seriousness of predecessors, for what they did not see they were probably forbidden to see. But one touches here on an aspect of ethnographic inquiry that concerns not only the will and capacities of the investigator but the intentions of those investigated; the latter may indeed submit to and even accept the curiosity of the white man, but this does not mean that their generosity is exempt from every precaution. It is claimed, in this case, though we find it hard to believe, that the rambramb ritual had not been celebrated for perhaps several decades previous to the 1974 performance. It is then a question here of a religious and social event that, after having been central to the life of the group, had been abandoned during a very long period of crisis and turmoil finally to be taken up again (for the last time? we do not know) in a spectacular fashion, with the participation of a Western "audience."49 It is thus that what initially may have appeared as the last survival of traditional cultic forms that the whites were having, accidentally, a chance to witness reveals a much more complex dimension wherein the dialectic of dissolution, survival, and revival is taken over by the actors themselves, in a somewhat premeditated manner. Thus the whites in this politico-cultural theater show themselves not for what they believe themselves to be, the benevolent and detached spectators of a dying reality; rather, they are the very term of reference of a potent if in some ways ephemeral revival of "traditional" reality. For the New Hebrides are, since the seventies, no longer in a time of cultural agony but rather in one of demands, protest, and "reconstruction" that, here as elsewhere, take the form of confrontation with the whites.50 49. It should again be recalled that, during Deacon's and Layard's time, it was only in the southern portion of Malekula that groups exhibited funerary mannequins during their rituals. 50. The present case of the interior of Malekula cannot certainly be compared with all the forms of native protests that Melanesia has known with varying levels of intensity for 40 years, nor with the new</page><page sequence="63">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 67 One might ask why it is that some native cultures ? cultures that, already fifty years ago, were said to be "vanishing" ? choose the rituals of the funerary cycle to express a new sense of their presence in the world. Should we consider archaic cultures as sets composed also of basically heterogeneous elements whose resistance to change and stress, whose capacity for survival or rebirth, do not necessarily follow the same rhythms? Might not the organicity of cultural patterns be an ephemeral, passing imperative that attains the level of absolute necessity only in the minds of anthropologists? What the case of the Mbogote ritual seems to indicate to us is that if, admittedly, cultures survive, they do so because they know how to defend themselves and because in some cases the traditional elements that they chose to be at the center of their new relationship to the world are those very ones that lend themselves to becoming the support not only of old values but also of the exigencies that this new relation imposes. These "added functions" do not necessarily efface the original ones; they add symbolic dimensions that, though oddly new, have just as much fundamental importance for the definition of an old identity in a "modern" context. The recourse to innovation sets in motion a new becoming at the same time that it permits the preservation of that which, by its very permanence, continues to particularize and to define the culture. The characteristic determinant of the Mbogote funerary ritual is the endless production of sculpted images. In assuming a new economic relationship with the Western world, the culture partially transforms that function into the production of works of art.51 It would be useless to examine this innovation from a moralistic point of view, to assert once more that whites profit from distress. The important fact is that what was once wrenched away by force is today purchased. For the white who keeps or who resells the objects, this makes little difference; but for the seller, the difference is enormous. The producer of "curios" has become an artist, meaning a producer of items of exchange that are at the top of the (Western) scale of values.52 It may now be opportune to ask ourselves what possible consequences are set in motion by such a great mutation in the role of "producer." To examine, in other words, the conditions required for this new role to be assumed, it being understood that this new eclectic course is of the nature of a project, meaning a direction of action that is not free from dangers and uncontrollable ambiguities. What is particular to the Mbogote does not apply, or not anymore, for instance, to the huge production of objects that we are familiar with in certain parts of the Solomons and of New Guinea (the most celebrated example being that of the Sepik area). For here in Central Malekula, many of the cult objects in great demand by whites are those that, in a way unique in all of Melanesia, support and merge with the relic. The rambramb is surely not the only "commercial" product for sale, and its circulation is a relatively recent event now that everything, in principle, is for sale; the white who is a guest at a rite knows as well as his host that the new liturgy does not stop when the dancing and singing fade: often its last act is represented by the sale of the images and paraphernalia. The spectacle is a messianisms that have burgeoned during the last 20 years. It is certain, however, that in the eastern part of Melanesia (Solomon, Banks, the New Hebrides) one observes a radicalization of messianism, the political aspects of which have, for a long time, aroused the fears and threatened the interests of colonists and observers. It does not remain less true that the Mbogote "solution" in Malekula has for the moment no equivalents elsewhere. Not that messianisms are not ritualized politics, nor that in these movements the recourse to the white always confines itself to making him both the obstacle and the model. It is that here the white serves the carrying through of the ritual imperative ? and this without his knowing it ? as the symbolic element necessary to its accomplishment. The white is the referent by which, perhaps, the ritual moves toward a renewal and through which the threatened culture contrives a recourse that is no more that of a deadly, hopelessly unattainable imitation. The Mbogote imitate nothing if not themselves and no longer seem haunted by the messianic necessity that, on many occasions in the past, linked them with other brothers of the archipelago. It is quite possible that by reason of inevitable demographic, ecological, and economic conditions, the case of the Mbogote merely represents an ephemeral resurgence. But new tendencies that manifest themselves in the manner we have just attempted to describe seem to us to be also present in situations where, on the contrary, one can expect the phenomenon to show great vitality and long-range political importance. There is the case, to cite one example, of the Moro nativist movement on Guadalcanal. Today, one should carry the discourse further and also examine the political movements, in part violent, that have brought about the independence of the archipelago in 1980. 51. The ritual that we have discussed in this essay involved not only the presence o? invited whites but also the almost complete sale of sacra, including the rambramb, at the end of the liturgy. 52. Primitive-art dealers were the first to give a monetary value to archaic objects. The hypocritical censure, often in itself not unjustified, that they encounter today (and that does not prevent several ethnographic museums from using their services to start or build up their own collections) comes to those who have recognized in practice what anthropologists, for the most part, have endeavored to deny: namely, that the entrance of archaic cultures into the modern world must necessarily entail establishing equitable economic relations at all levels.</page><page sequence="64">68 RES 2 AUTUMN 81 vernissage. Among these, the mannequin, as fancy merchandise, stirs up the propensity to purchase. So the cult object is now conceivable only as having simultaneously the traditional function ? of not being merchandise ? and the new function ? of being merchandisable. And the entire cultural dilemma that we are in the process of questioning is contained in this symbolic duplicity. It is in this sense that we spoke earlier of the added function that is expressed in the setting where the white is the necessary guest. It remains to be determined precisely in just what sense this duplicity is realized. As it has been said in those parts of Vanuatu where the archaic nature of the funerary cult is maintained, one may consider the traditional function as that by which the relic-object bestows on the dead being the power to return first as a resemblance in order to be then reabsorbed in emblematic oblivion into the ancestral body. The image is that which brings back the dead and, at the same time, that which makes it possible for them to leave. What, then, of the new commen?ai function that is now creeping in? The appreciation of the white man is indispensable here. The value of the object is recognized if and only if, in the jargon of primitive-art connoisseurs, it is "authentic." For the rambramb, the gauge of this authenticity comes from its being both image and relic: the mannequin bears a real skull. We do not know how the first rambramb in museum collections were obtained, but later, for a long time, the natives pretended to satisfy this commercial necessity while they avoided assuming the possible consequences of a dangerous transgression by producing some false mannequins that did not have true skulls inside. But now that this fear has been overcome, auction-house showrooms welcome recent mannequins that are genuine. Why does the fear no longer persist? And what were its causes? Surely not, it seems to us, seeing the wrath of the dead fall on the community, causing sickness and death to those who had agreed to unload these mortuary remains. For the dead one goes away; his memory swiftly fades; remains and names are scattered even when their tangible symbols are visible for a certain time next to the palisades. But their dispersal took place within the communal precinct and remained related (temes) to the life-supporting ecosystem of the surrounding forest; their departure toward oblivion announced the attival of the emblem effigy, in turn entitling the human presence to return as silhouette, as mannequin. Now, however, the sale of the cult object forever precludes this circularity, and the eternal return of equivalent images is forever cut off by death. Each time new effigies are produced, these cannot be viewed anymore, at least not in the old sense, as reembodiments of previous objectifications. This means that the dead are forever cut off from the world of the living: the thanatology becomes unidirectional, and the dead depart immediately and irreversibly for the "other world," body and soul; in this phase the world beyond, the world of ultimate destiny, perhaps even in some way the world of transcendence is the world of the white man. But the last word is never said and things may change again. When the effigy is sold, its route leads away from the enclosure, and no one really knows where it will go. By contrast, its departure brings something that until recently has had scarcely any meaning: its "value," its "price." To sell what remains of the dead is to give it an exchange value and consequently to open the way to the conversion of goods. The rambramb becoming a piece of merchandise nullifies its nature as object-of presence in order to take on the indeterminate and perpetually convertible one of object-of-exchange ? that is, ultimately, money. What is it that makes this conversion possible? On the one hand, as we have seen, this implies a new stance by the natives in relation to the white man, a stance in which "to become white" is to be otherwise oneself, meaning to be oneself while producing, as such, something of value. This recognized value takes the place of the autochthonous non-value of the second colonial phase that engendered the forms of messianic syncretisms and revindications. In the first part of this era, the ritual object was a document? a naturalistic specimen ? that one snatched up or received in exchange for goods of trifling value and that ended up, more often than not, in the great taxonomical cemeteries of Western museums; then it became a souvenir, a memento of exotic travel. Later still, certain Western minds, artists, and connoisseurs started attributing aesthetic and expressive value to these productions. As often in the market mechanisms of our culture, they were ahead of their time; later, scarcity and the art boom retrospectively transformed their curiosity and passion into foresight and their cherished, priceless "pieces" into "priceless" bargains. The general recognition of artistic (and hence monetary) value in the productions of archaic cultures is a recent development whose first truly significant manifestations go back not more than 40 years. In parts of Melanesia, this is a very recent event; just 15 years ago there were still cultures that had scarcely been contacted. This</page><page sequence="65">Guidieri and Pellizzi: Shadows 69 particular situation results, as in our case, in the short circuited encounter of two currents of value ? on the one hand, that which, fulfilling the traditional symbolic functions, founds the authenticity of the objects; on the other hand, that new economic value developed in the West by the demand for objects that, endowed with this very authenticity, are entitled to the new aura of objets d'art. The original Mystery ? the metaphysical concerns that gave life to them and that we have tried to conjure up in these pages ? is transformed by their (final?) destiny into the post-Romantic "mystery" of artistic creation.
