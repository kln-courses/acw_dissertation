<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Fathers was praised as creator of the universe. Whether these litanies were pre-Mosaic or Mosaic is difficult, if not impossible, to determine, but it is clear that the very name Yahweh presupposes their existence at the time when this name was first employed as the name of Israel's God. The fact that Joshua already adopted a theophorous name containing the element Yahu indicates that the introduction of the name cannot be later than the time of Moses. The reviewer, accepting the substantially Mosaic date of the Song of Miriam (which includes the Song of Moses) and the Oracles of Balaam,s has no doubt that Yahweh was the approved name of the god of Israel at least from the Exodus on. In later centuries, after the verbal force of yahwe had been completely for- gotten, Yahwg Sebd'ot came to mean "Lord of Hosts," and the alternative expression, Yahw 'elh~ $.b a'ot, "Yahweh, God of Hosts," arose to explain its enigmatic grammatical construction. But we are safe in supposing that the expression was originally at home in very ancient litanies, from which it was taken as a most suitable formula with which to designate the holiest cult- object of Israel, placed at the head of every army going forth to battle the enemies of Yahweh on behalf of His people. This practice died out early in Israel, but it left behind a profound sense of the awe-inspiring majesty of the God of Battles, in Whose presence the mightiest nations are as chaff before the tempest. W. F. ALBRIGHT Studies in the Septuagint: I. Book of Job (Lunds Universitets Arsskrift. N. F. Avd. 1. Bd. 43. Nr 2); II. Chronicles (Nr 3), by Gillis Gerleman. Lund: C. W. K. Gleerup, 1946. Pp. 86 and 46. Kr. 5 and 3 respectively. One of the few countries in what we like to call the "civilized" parts of the world, Sweden has witnessed a tremendous advance in the field of biblical and general ancient Near Eastern studies. From the Lund school of J. Lind- blom have come to hand two monographs by Gillis Gerleman, dealing with the Septuagint of Job and Chronicles. So far as Job is concerned, the author's primary purpose was to study the s On the Oracles of Balaam see JBL, 1944, pp. 207-33; on the Song of Miriam see a forthcoming study by Cross and Freedman (meanwhile note that the expression "mountain of thine inheritance" [Ex 15 17] is now paral- leled in the gr nhlty of the Baal Epic of Ugarit and need no longer be dated after the time of David - much less after the Exile). 381</page><page sequence="2">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE LXX translation of this book in the light of the Hebrew text and of the Hel- lenistic Judaism of the time, in order to determine the cultural milieu and outlook of the Jewish translator. In Ch. I, the longest in the study (pp. 5-31), the author has gone over scores of passages in his attempt to evaluate the "Language and Method of Translation in the Greek Book of Job." As I read through this chapter, I had the feeling on every page that I was meeting old friends again, that, in general, the sort of passages used for analysis and the sort of conclusions drawn from them were not new. The author believes that "the Greek Book of Job in its predilection for prepositional compounds shows an evident affinity with the contemporary Greek original literature" (p. 7), and that "the translator has freed himself from a literal reproduction of the original, being evidently anxious to produce a good and easily flowing Greek" (p. 8). This has long been the consensus of critical opinion about the Jewish trans- lator of the Greek Job. Already Hugh Broughton (1549-1612), in his Epistola ad Nobiles Angliae de Translatione Scripturarum ex Hebraico in Anglicum Sermonem (quoted by Humphrey Hody, De Bibliorum Textibus Originalibus, etc., Oxonii, 1705, Lib. II, Ch. X, ? 6, p. 203), characterized the translator as one who "Poetarum lector fuit." And Egli, almost a century ago (Rhei- nisches Museum fur Philologie, 12 [1857], 441 148), listed in the short space of five pages close to a hundred words in the Greek Job (he did not distinguish between the LXX and the Theodotionic parts!) which are to be found almost exclusively in the poetical works of Greek writers. Many scholars have since commented on this aspect of the translator's cultural milieu (cf. the reviewer on Theophrastus and the possible reading 7rpaalta in 8 16, JQR, 26 [1935-36], 134-5 and n. 7). At the same time, the author should have noted that this free manner of translation does not at all tell the whole story; the translator was quite literalistic in his rendering just as often as he was free! In other words, he knew Greek well and liked to use it properly; but he was restrained by the Hebrew idiom before him. And how many translators do not become a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in such circumstances? Of greater value are the author's comparisons of the LXX of Job with that of Proverbs (pp. 14-17). It has long been noted that there is something in the two which the rest of the Greek Bible does not share; I first observed this 16 years ago in a term paper written at the Dropsie College. All those inter- ested in LXX studies would be beholden to Gerleman if he were to pursue further "the presumption that both translations originate from the same hand" (p. 17). 382</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS The fact that the LXX of Job is about one-sixth shorter than MT has been noted since the days of Origen and Jerome. What biblical scholarship has not as yet determined is which of the two represents the original, or the text nearer to the original. It is a pity, therefore, that where the author might have made an independent and thorough study of this perplexing problem and a contribution towards its solution, he has contented himself with assum- ing as correct the popular belief, never really demonstrated by anyone, "that the responsibility for the truncated condition of the LXX lies... on the translator" (p. 22. Scholars have simply copied one from the other, all the way back to Dillmann's study of "Textkritisches zum Buche Ijob" [in Sitz- ungsberichte der koniglich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin, 1890, 1345-73] and to Bickell's De indole ac ratione versionis Alexandrinae in interpretando libro Jobi [Marburg, 1862]). On the other hand, it is good that he has rejected (p. 22) the "exaggerated" views of Bickell and others that "the translator excluded passages which caused him insuperable difficulties in interpretation," and has qualified with the words "may possibly be correct" the supposition that "the translator sometimes seems to have omitted things which he found objectionable for ethical or religious reasons." The author might find food for thought in my treatment of "The Hebrew and Greek Texts of Job 14.12" (JQR, 28 [1937-38], 57-68), where evidence is presented to demonstrate that, contrary to popular belief, the translator did not omit the third stich, but a glossator added it in the Hebrew text. Worthy of note is the author's judgment that if MT should turn out to be the original then "it is chiefly stylistic reasons that have induced the translator to shorten the original" (pp. 22-27). Chap. II is the most interesting in the monograph; the author discusses those expressions and concepts which shed light on "Nature and Culture in the Greek Book of Job" (32-48). He has shown that the names of the numer- ous trees and plants have been usually given in the LXX "a broad, generalizing interpretation" (pp. 33-4). Having stated this as a fact, the author however is quick to follow up, and correctly, with this caveat about Dmn a kind of "broom (tree)" (~OXov 30 14): "It is uncertain whether he himself knew the meaning of Dnl, but generalized it for the sake of his readers, gave a simplifying inter- pretation, or whether the rendering is mere guesswork ... In I Kings 19 5 :l' is rendered as vaguely as in Job, (pvr6v..." In connection with the LXX rendering of 1'Vn in 30 7, the author would seem to imply that the "more general" ppv'yava aypta ("wild shrubs") is due to the translator's ignorance that "The Hebrew word designates a species of 383</page><page sequence="4">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE thistle of the Cynara family" (p. 34). It so happens that the Board of Editors responsible for the Jewish Publication Society Translation of the Hebrew Bible was quite aware of all the data available on our word, and yet chose to reproduce it by the general word "nettles," quite in the spirit of the LXX translator. Would anyone dare to account for "nettles" as due to ignorance? Could one translate "thistle of the Cynara family" (or whatever kind of thistle Il'in may really be)? - this is commentary! Again, when the author suggests that the LXX rendered 1D'.7 in 40 21, 22 (found only here in the Hebrew [correct the author's "Greek"] Bible) by 7rav- Troca'r 6ev5pa ("all kinds of trees") and 6evppa ueya'Xa ("big trees") because "the translator had no access to any tradition in regard to the sig- nificance of the Hebrew words" (p. 34), I wonder whether reasons other than ignorance might not have been at work. The author, as has long been believed, explains D'32g as the name of the lotus tree, Zizyphus Lotus. But the matter is not as simple as all that. For one thing, I find it hard to believe that the translator rendered 1'ksX in 21 by "all kinds of trees and in 22 immediately following by "big trees"; surely he would not, if he had decided to render the word in two different ways, have contradicted himself! Secondly, it is signifi- cant that the Targum (;IT'P?; cf. also Rashi and Ibn Ezra) understands our word as "shade" (i. e., from root Y'X, with the aleph explained as taking the place of the second lamedh), and Schleusner (Novus Thesaurus... Lexicon in LXX, etc., Lipsiae, 1820, s. v. Bevppa) may well be right in explaining LXX bevppa 7ravroSa7ra for "D'7gX, i. q. D'.x, plur. umbrosa ... arbores umbri- serae." Thirdly, it is hardly too much to assume that if our translator in 21b "tried to give his rendering of the names of plants a more definite character" 7rairvpov Kat Kt Xato l K a [obroLvov for 1. n p, '1nD. 3), surely he might have used the rather common Greek word Xcor6s ("lotus tree") for 1D'?rX (parallel to "papyrus," etc.) even as a guess; the fact that he did not might well indicate not ignorance of the meaning of 1D'7X (see above on his knowl- edge of Theophrastus' Enquiry into Plants [where Xor6s is of course discussed]) but knowledge of a Jewish traditional meaning of the word. In fine, the Greek-Hebrew of our D''kX continues to remain a problem for the modern critic. There is very much more in this chapter which I should like to take up in detail; and the same is true of the no less stimulating Chap. III on "The Leading Ideas of the Job Dialogue on a Greek Basis" (49-63). I will limit myself here to touching on the two problems in the latter which he considers to be the most important. 384</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS As stated above, the author virtually dismissed the ethical and religious outlook of the translator as a factor in any shortening of the original Hebrew of which he may have been guilty. On the other hand, the author feels that "Unduly anthropomorphic expressions also give rise to dogmatic misgivings in the translator" (pp. 58-9), with the result that (.nn On:) 1'; (;ri'h) in 26 13 "His [viz., God's] hand (has slain the serpent primeval)" is reproduced in the LXX by 7rpooardyjaTL 6e (EOavaTrcoav p&amp;aKovTa a7roarrar)v) "And at His command (He killed the fleeing serpent)." However, faced by the indubitable fact that such an expression as "T' "Your [viz., God's] hand" in 2 5 ("And Satan ... said ... 'But put forth your hand now and strike his [Job's] bone and flesh...' ") is reproduced literally (Triv Xe-p4 aoov "Your hand"), our author gets around his difficulty by describing the "hand" in 2 5 as in a "less concrete context' than the "hand" in 26 13! The same excuse is given (p. 59) for God's "hand" in 5 18 where Bildad says about God, (yn?,) (;1'rnr) 111 "(He smites) and His hands (heal)," and where the LXX again renders literally, Kai at XeLpes avrov; or ' in n''. t?. 10 l -12i in 12 10 (literally, ev XetpL avrov); or pnrIL9 '.D. .3 "Withdraw your [viz., God's] hand far from me" in 13 21 (rr7v xetpa &amp;ir' c,uov a7rexov). Note that the translator uses 7rp6aoray'ia for the rtul2 of God in 4 9; but lest anyone hasten to conclude that it was the nMt?3 of God which bothered our translator, let it be noted immediately that God's ,ltD3 is reproduced by 7rvoo in 32 8 and 33 4, and that Job's 1DiV3 too is reproduced by the very same word, in 27 3. And there are other passages. Excellent indications of how little the translator, unlike his modern critics, was really bothered by "hand" may be found in 2 10 and 15 22. In the former, 1'.'r flN (p" ) ZiITMr'nn t3), "(What? Shall we accept good) from God" is reproduced in the LXX - horror of horrors! - by (K XELpOS KUplov; the translator actually introduced "hand (of God)" where the Hebrew did not. Yet he does the same thing in the latter, where lnnn"'' (Kl1 lExi) "(And he is hidden) for the sword" is reproduced by els Xelpas acrtpov. I hope sometime to publish all my data on the subject; but even the relatively meager material cited here provides sufficient reason to reject as absurd all talk of "the translator's scrupulous aversion to describing God in human terms" (p. 59). See in the meantime also my review of C. T. Fritsch's book on The Anti-Anthropomorphisms of the Greek Pentateuch in The Crozer Quarterly, 21 (1944), 156-160. On pp. 60-63 the author discusses those passages in Job which deal with death and Sheol. "It is for him [Job] something final, irrevocable. He that goeth down to the kingdom of death returns no more thence... If we turn 385</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE to the LXX, we have the impression that the translator, in regard to death and the fate of the dead, entirely shares the view of the author of the dialogue. The great majority of the relevant passages in the LXX are reproduced with- out essential change ..." (p. 60. It would have been far more correct to say: Whether our translator did or did not believe in resurrection or find anthro- pomorphisms offensive, he reproduced the Hebrew text faithfully" [from p. 124 of my still unpublished dissertation]). But precisely at this point is where the author, as so frequently in his monograph and in keeping with virtually all his predecessors, forgets the most elementary rules in methodology. He proceeds to assert, "The agreement, however, is merely apparent. The difference is shown in the translation of 14 14 ... [and in] the LXX's addition in 42 17..." (pp. 60-61). However, since 42 17, which may well be a later addition to the LXX (cf., e. g., G. B. Gray, "The Additions in the Ancient Greek Versions of Job," The Expositor, 19 [1920], 422-38), certainly does not involve any rendering of the Hebrew, it cannot be taken into consideration for our problem. What is left, out of all the passages in Job involving death and Sheol, is 14 14, where I would challenge anyone to demonstrate the original character of both the received text and the more popularly accepted transla- tions and interpretations of it. What our author has done is to ignore the evidence of all the clear-cut passages in Job in order to base a theory on the single passage which is obscure! And then, in order to reconcile the translator's alleged embarrassment brought on, e. g., by 7 9-lo (death only) as against 14 14 ("be born again"), our author has to drag in "an eschatological belief in the resurrection" (pp. 62-3). Actually, the embarrassment and the eschatology are our author's; they did not exist either for the translator or for the author of the Hebrew text, and this fact would be clear to anyone who would allow the Jewish translator and the author of the Hebrew text to speak for them- selves where their texts are not obscure. A grievous fault in the monograph is the author's ignorance of much of the important literature on the LXX of Job. Schleusner is not mentioned anywhere, nor Beer (Der Text des Buches Hiob, Marburg, 1897), nor Dillmann, nor (Driver-) Gray (ICC on Job, 1921), nor Merx (Das Gedicht von Hiob, Jena, 1871), nor J. Ziegler's discussion of "Der textkritische Wert der Septuaginta des Buches Job" (Miscellanea Biblica, Vol. II, Roma, 1934, pp. 277-96), or the reviewer's several articles in JBL and JQR. Following on a useful chapter (IV, pp. 64-72) on "The Ethiopic Transla- tion of the Book of Job," there is a brief discussion of the "Date of the Greek Book of Job" (Chap. V, 73-5); the latter does not offer anything beyond that 386</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS available already. A number of indices (76-85) and the Table of Contents (86) bring the monograph to a close. Having taken up so much space for his Job, I can deal with Gerleman's study in the LXX of Chronicles only summarily. Here, it seems to me, he has produced an important contribution. In the first Chapter, "The Age of the Paralipomena" (pp. 3-13), the author discusses several important aspects of the LXX of Chronicles; one of these is the theory made popular especially by C. C. Torrey that the so-called Septuagint translation of Ezra, Nehemiah, and Chronicles, is in reality that of Theodotion. It is our author's contention (1) that the LXX translation of Ezra (II Esdras) and Nehemiah was not made by the same person who was responsible for that of Chronicles, and (2) that the LXX translator of Chronicles was not Theodotion. I have never been convinced by the arguments of Torrey and his predeces- sors (especially Howorth), and am strongly inclined to the contrary position. Our author cites several instances to indicate his reasons for believing "that the Paralipomena, in regard to several characteristic peculiarities in transla- tion, markedly differ from Esd.-Neh.... [and that] These disparities between the Paralipomena and II Esd.-Neh. indicate that they can scarcely emanate from the same translator" (pp. 6-7). Gerleman contends further that "The tendency to transcribe Hebrew words is not a characteristic only, or mainly, of the Paralipomena and Theodotion" (p. 7), and then goes on to prove, using inter alia the Greek material in those writings of Josephus (Jewish Antiquities; end of 1st cent. A. D.) and Eupolemos (fl. about 150 B. C.; apud Eusebius, Praeparatio Evangelica) which deal with the period and data of Chronicles, that these two Jewish historians already knew and used the LXX translation of Chronicles; hence Theodotion (prior to Aquila in the 2nd cent. A. D.; cf. Orlinsky, On the Present State of Proto-LXX Studies [New Haven, 1941], p. 85, n. 17) could not have been the translator of this older Greek version (pp. 8-13). The chief point which is argued in Chap. II ("The Paralipomena and Egypt," pp. 14-21) is that "the translator... sought for correspondences in the Egyptian Hellenistic cult terminology" (p. 15) and that the LXX of Chronicles "has an unmistakable colouring and reflects conditions which were specific of the Ptolemaic court in the second century B. C." (Summary, p. 45). He regards the use of X\t/ (instead of the usual hvro-,) for :1vP "west" (II Chron 32 30 and 33 14) as the reflection of the Egyptian geographical scene; elsewhere in the LXX Xi4p is used with the classical meaning of "south." (Though Xl,t is used for :l'y also by Theodotion, in Dan 8 5, this is dismissed with the statement, "Several other similar 'harmless' Egypticisms can be 387</page><page sequence="8">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE found in Theodotion" [p. 14, n. 3]. Note also that "OrC [Constantinopolitan- Origenian text, the A-group] (A 106 230 al.) has plus [vorov] Kal Xlt3a, a gloss explaining Kara 6OXaoao-av [Hebrew ro,]", Montgomery, ICC on Daniel, 1927, p. 329, ad loc. Of considerable interest is the author's contention in Chap. III ("The Paralipomena and the Pentateuch," pp. 22-29) that "the translator of the Paralipomena reveals a marked familiarity with the Greek Pentateuch and also an unmistakable dependence thereon... there are certain indications that this dependence may be partly attributable to the liturgical practice in the Jewish synagogue" (p. 22). The author takes up such Hebrew words and expressions as '.? "before," -'In "servant," Wt0 "tribe," 7D?n "wisdom," p "yoke," 'IYin i,lh ("traditionally rendered "tent of testimony, meeting"; but see now F. M. Cross Jr., "The Tabernacle," The Biblical Archaeologist, 10 [1947], p. 65 ? 16), lil "ark; chest," and the terms for several sacred vessels of the Tabernacle and Temple, and shows statistically (cf. p. 23) how it is the Greek Pentateuch, and not the LXX of Samuel and Kings, which is used by the Greek translator of Chronicles. And at Ex 38/I Ki 7 26 ff./II Chron 4 11 ff. the author has noted this: that whereas the LXX translator of Kings repro- duced his Hebrew Vorlage fairly faithfully, the translator of Chronicles has reproduced his Hebrew text so that his Greek rendering approximated the Greek of the Pentateuch far more closely than his Hebrew text did the Hebrew Pentateuch (pp. 24-26). After discussing some possible reasons for this phe- nomenon, our author comes to the conclusion that "This connecting link is, in fact, the liturgical use of both texts in the synagogue" (p. 27). He goes on to discuss the Haphtarah and the importance of the work done by H. St. John Thackeray on The Septuagint and Jewish Worship. He is aware of the fact that "the Chronicles, as included in the Writings or Hagiographa, were not used in the actual reading of the lesson [Haphtarah] in the synagogue. On the other hand, some Haphtarahs were taken from Sam-Kings, among them the passage I Kings 7 40-50, which has a synoptic parallel in II Par. 4 11 ff." (p. 29). I can but agree with the concluding statement that the further study of the LXX of the Prophets and Psalms, from the point of view of liturgy, "would probably give valuable contributions both to the study of the Septuagint and to our knowledge of the Alexandrian synagogue." The concluding Chapter (IV, 30-44) deals with the Hebrew and LXX of "The Paralipomena and the Reigns." Gerleman notes "that the Greek texts show numerous correspondences in the wording which have no parallel in the Masoretic text. Minor discrepancies in the Hebrew synopsis have been largely 388</page><page sequence="9">BOOK REVIEWS eliminated in the Greek" (p. 31). Thus, to cite but four out of some thirty instances listed by our author, ev rT7 t'.tpq. &amp;KeiVl, used for f1lil;l Dl'l in I Sam 31 6, is used also in I Chron 10 6 where no Hebrew correspondent is to be found. Again, iv Tr KOLXa&amp;L TiV rtLralvov is the reading for pV:Y: D'D'1 in II Sam 5 22, and likewise in I Chron 14 13 where only pr3y is present in the Hebrew text. On the other hand, -1nT 1''1 in II Sam 10 5 is rendered by Kat a&amp;7r?'yyyeLav T, AavtL vtrep rTcv avSp,v, which approximates LXX tKal tXOov a7ray'yeLXat rT Aauvt 7rep rTov &amp;avSp&amp;v in I Chron 19 5 for the fuller Hebrew text, 'I1 'TY 'I'lli 11'P: 1'I1. [In the light of his retention of a7rayyf7XXw in I Chron 19 5 and the overwhelming manuscript evidence in favor of this root also in II Sam 10 5, it is rather surprising that Rahlfs (ed. Septuaginta) has emended airr^yyLXav in the latter passage to avr/y'yeLXav.] And in II Sam 6 7 the LXX reads vb7rtLov roV 0eov where MT has no cor- respondent at all, whereas I Chron 13 10 has both the Hebrew correspondent (D','lrN '1)) and the LXX rendering of it (a&amp;re&amp;avr,L rov 0eov). Our author believes that "it is not merely a question of a unilateral dependence, i. e. of a younger translation showing influences from an earlier parallel text. It is also evident that the synoptic correspondence in the Greek texts in many cases can be traced to the originals" (34-5). Gerleman is apparently not acquainted with the work of S. Baer, M. Rehm (reviewed by the present writer in this Journal [58 (1939), 397-99]), A. Sperber, Pr. Vannutelli, and others. I hope that Gerleman will examine in greater detail the Greek-Hebrew of both Samuel-Kings and Chronicles and, unlike his predecessors, also utilize properly the variants in the Hebrew manuscripts collated by Kennicott, de Rossi, and others (cf. Orlinsky, "The Kings-Isaiah Recensions of the Hezekiah Story," JQR, 30 [1939-40], 33-49). Too many introductions to the Bible and commentaries on individual books have been prone to make general statements concerning the character of the LXX translation of this or that biblical book without the writer of these statements ever having himself made any really careful and detailed study of the Greek-Hebrew. And even when they are made by specialists, these general statements should never be used for anything more than the most general guidance in determining the character and original form of the Greek- Hebrew of any specific word or passage. Gerleman (40-42) has some worth- while critical remarks to make concerning R. Helbing's characterization of the LXX of Chronicles as a "wortgetreuer Wiedergabe oft auf Kosten der griechischen Sprache in grammatischer und stilistischer Hinsicht." The chapter ends with a brief excursus on Thackeray's theory of several 389</page><page sequence="10">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE translators for the LXX of Samuel-Kings. Our author is inclined to believe that while Thackeray is right in his view that more than one translator was responsible for the LXX of Samuel-Kings, he is not justified in separating the different parts by "deep 'chasms' of time and space, as well as in the pur- pose of the translation... The variations in phraseology and style [on com- paring them with the synoptic parallels in the Paralipomena] may rather be supposed to have been due to a purely practical division between the transla- tors, without too great disparities between them . .." (p. 44). A Summary and Table of Contents (45-6) bring this rich and stimulating monograph to a close. HARRY M. ORLINSKY Ancient Hebrew Marriage Laws, by E. Neufeld. London, New York, and Toronto: Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1944. Pp. xix+304. The purpose of this book, as stated in the preface, is "to give a compre- hensive survey of the laws and customs relating to marriage among the ancient Hebrews as contained in the Old Testament." The sub-title indicates that the survey is made "with special references to general Semitic laws and customs." The first part of the volume presents the various forms of marriage represented in the Old Testament; the second part discusses the constitution and dissolution of marriage, and the third part the impediments to marriage; the fourth part deals with the status of parents and children, including (some- what illogically) the relative status of husband and wife. The presentatioil is specific as well as comprehensive. It is thoroughly documented, with full and up-to-date use of secondary as well as primary sources. A full bibliography and six indices facilitate the use of the book as a work of reference. The biblical material is presented schematically, the comparative materials being given separately under each topic, and each chapter ends with a section entitled "Comparison." Much attention is given to rabbinic sources. Neufeld recognizes that there was much development between the Old Testament and the Talmud, that the rabbis were not critical historians, and that their inter- pretations do not necessarily coincide with earlier ideas. Occasionally, however, where the Old Testament is silent, he ventures to draw inferences from the later law. The New Testament is used also as a source for later conceptions and practices. Babylonian, Assyrian, Hittite, and Arabic sources are utilized. It cannot be said that this is the last word on Hebrew marriage. The 390</page></plain_text>
