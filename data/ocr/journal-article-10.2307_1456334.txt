<plain_text><page sequence="1">In the Beginning. By SOLOMON GOLDMAN. New York: Harper and Brothers, 1949. xiv + 892 pages. $5.00. This is Volume Two of The Book of Hu- man Destiny, a massive literary work on the Bible which the author proposes to carry through in twelve such volumes. These portly tomes are certainly not intended for bedside reading! The work is being executed from an orthodox Jewish viewpoint and it should find a large welcome in such circles. The book before us deals first with the Contents of the Book of Genesis and emphasizes its distinctive features as over against prim- itive folklore. This is followed by a second chapter giving a series of well-chosen selec- tions from the Bible text. In his discussion of the Historical Background, the author shows himself aware of recent archaeolog- ical discoveries and this knowledge he uses to the discomfiture of Julian Morgenstern in some of the latter's wild surmises. The author is quite adept at playing off one critic against another and a polemical aim is frequently obvious. In regard to Author- ship the writer suggests that the Mosaic authorship is not untenable and that Moses may have had written documents originat- ing in the patriarchal period. A final chap- ter of this first section is devoted to Phi- losophy, and the author is certainly right when he says "it contains no formal or systematic philosophy." But it does con- tain, as Goldman sees, marvelous religious insights, and it does so because it is so "vigorously anthropomorphic." The book contains about 100 pages of commentary on the text of Genesis, and, as in the previous volume, the author dis- Introducing to ministers, theologians, and serious readers everywhere-- The Library of Living Theology Edited by CHARLES W. KEGLEY and ROBERT W. BRETALL Who are today's outstanding religious thinkers? What do they teach, and how do they answer their critics? These questions will be answered in an im- portant new series of books, THE LI- BRARY OF LIVING THEOLOGY, a bril- liantly planned symposium on the most creative religious thought today. Each volume will be concerned with a major contemporary figure in theology. Volume One The Theology of Paul Tillich Paul Tillich is to theology what Alfred North Whitehead is to philosophy. No more significant thinker could have been selected to introduce this original series. Following a pattern to be used in other volumes, the book contains Tillich's in- tellectual autobiography, 14 essays on his work by well-known scholars, and a reply by Tillich to their criticism.
