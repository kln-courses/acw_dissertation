<plain_text><page sequence="1">Thorstein Veblen's Positive Synthesis By HELEN P. LIEBEL LATE NINETEENTH-CENTURY AMERICA witnessed the full impact of the industrial revolution on a nation whose remaining agrarian frontiers were rapidly succumbing to permanent settlement. The nation's further eco- nomic development was subsequently to draw the United States into an increasingly more interdependent world market and cause its history to approximate that of Europe more than it had at any time since the great American frontier movement began. The cultural impact of these proc- esses was such that the American mind "quitted its quiet theological retreats"' and set out to square its accumulated fund of theory with new social realities. Post-Civil War America was the scene of a clash between two theories of progress, that of the classical economic liberals and that of the social critics of the industrial revolution who opposed laissez-faire economics. According to the pre-Darwinian doctrines of economic liberalism, progress was identical with an optimum level of output and was achieved by allow- ing the individual as much economic freedom as he possessed in an original state of nature so that he could take advantage of the free play of the laws of nature, which would, once operative, bring society to its fullest fruition. The social critics of the liberal conception of progress were influenced by the social injustice of the "Gilded Age" and attempted to evaluate economic life not in terms of natural laws, but "from the stand- point of values which [were] not themselves an integral part of economic life."2 They were influenced by the idea of evolution and came to believe that progress would ensue, not as the product of the inexorable laws of nature, but if social impediments to change or adaptation were successfully removed.3 While the classical liberals believed that the development of the whole depended on the activity of individuals alone, their Darwinian critics believed-and in this respect they seem to have been influenced by the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, which is similar-that the development of the whole transcended the life of the individual and was to be realized by the group "collectively."4 1V.

Unlike Henry Adams, he did not shrink before the concepts of pluralism and brute causation engendered by the "Machine Age." He gloried in them and wove them into an effective tool for discrediting the postulates underlying the "received" truths of classical economics. He did not combat logic with logic; he "blandly" took apart the preconceptions involved.6 But Veblen was not merely content with social criticism. He was pri- marily a social philosopher and as such he was grievously concerned with the dangers implicit in what is now usually called the "cultural lag," and going beyond that, with the grave crisis that it posited for Western Civiliza- tion on the whole.7 His conception of this problem, although largely a function of his "Darwinian" methodology, was substantially re-enforced by his familiarity with the ethnology, psychology, and anthropology of his day. It is, however, only possible to understand Veblen's whole phi- losophy if one understands that he occurs as a thinker in the European traditions of Wilhelm Dilthey, Max Weber, Pareto, Troeltsch, etc.8 He denied the mechanistic approach of Marxism. But, with his European contemporaries, he did strive to find a methodology which could make the ideas of a social scientist as valid, logically, as those of a natural scientist. He believed that such logical validity was to be found in the adoption of Darwinism as a heuristic principle and in the use of the positivist (Comtean) theory of the systematization of knowledge in 5 Joseph Dorfman, The Economic Mind in American Civilization (New York, 1946), III, p. 435 (hereafter cited as Mind). 6 Paul Homan, Contemporary Economic Thought (New York and London, 1928), p. 126. 7 Thorsteln Veblen, The Instinct of Workmanship and the State of the Industrial Arts (New York, 1914), p. 25 (hereafter cited as Instinct). 8 See for a discussion of the development of philosophies of social science the excellent work by H.

Hughes does not, of course mention Veblen who is, however, very much a part of this tradition. Cf. David Riesman, Thorstein Veblen, A Critical Interpretation (New York, 1953), passim, who emphasizes Veblen's shortcomings, seeks to explain the psychological mainsprings of Veblen's thought in terms of neo-Freudian psychology, and says repeatedly that Veblen was unaware of the work of Weber, Pareto, etc., although the communications he received from former students of Veblen, and which he cites contra- dict the remarks of his text. See also Bernard Rosenberg, The Values of Veblen: A Critical Appraisal (Washington, D.C., 1956), p. 52, who believed Veblen stood "equi- distant" between Marx and Weber and does point out his significance as a philosopher of social science methodology on several occasions, viz., pp. 9, 29, 33-35, 43.</page><page sequence="3">Thorstein Veblen's Positive Synthesis human cultureg as a tool of analysis in the study of economic institutions and the growth of human civilization. But the Darwinian and Comtean ingredients of his philosophy were merely epistemological, and it is these which interest most of the authors who write about him. It ought not to be overlooked that Thorstein Veblen, who wrote a Ph.D. dissertation on Kant, quite consciously used Kantian ontology to buttress the more obvious evolutionary aspects of his philosophy.l0 However, most of his major works stress the Darwinian and positivist framework of his thought rather than his Kantianism. Veblen's first large-scale statement of the problem of cultural lag which so much concerned him was contained in The Theory of the Leisure Class.l1 "The collective interests of any modern community," he argued, "centre in industrial efficiency." Traditional virtues such as honesty, diligence, peacefulness, goodwill, absence of self-seeking, and "an habit- ual recognition and apprehension of causal sequence, without admixture of animistic belief and without a sense of dependence on any preter- natural intervention in the course of events,"l2 best served the general interest. However, our modern money-centered culture (pecuniary cul- ture)13 had come to direct the basic altruism of man (which sprang from his "instinct of workmanship")14 along lines of "invidious compari- sion,"'l so that production tended to be for conspicuous and wasteful consumption because the individual measured his own social position in terms of its proximity to that of an outmoded and unproductive leisure class whose ideals designated "productive" work an unworthy occupa- tion.16 But in an age of machine technology the survival of society was 9 Cf. Rosenberg, 33-35. 10 Most of the major works on Veblen's thought do not sufficiently stress his Kantian- ism, although they do mention it. Cf. Stanley M. Daugert, The Philosophy of Thorstein Veblen (New York, 1950), p. 5 f.; Lev E. Dobriansky, Veblenism, A New Critique (Washington, D. C., 1957), p. 80-81, who like Riesman tends to defend much of what Veblen attacked; and Riesman, p. 58. 11 Thorstein Veblen, The Theory of the Leisure Class (New York, Modern Library Edition, 1934), hereafter cited as T.L.C.

So Veblen concluded, by implica- tion, that unless the good in man, chiefly his so-called instinct of work- manship, could be expressed along non-self-seeking lines, and unless leisure-class attitudes somehow disappeared, society would be unable to adapt to the new modes of production produced by the industrial revolu- tion, and being unadapted, perish.17 This, according to Veblen, is the greatest problem confronting our historical era. However, Veblen's significance goes beyond that of the social critic who pointed out a discrepancy between a de facto economic situation and a de jure fabric of institutions in our cultural complex. He also attempted to construct a system of ideas which explained how the crisis of the age had arisen and, in the course of doing that, explain as well what the nature of the life processes of human civilization were. To understand the significance of Veblen's contribution to American and Western thought, it is necessary to comprehend his system as a whole and not as so many of his recent critics have done, merely evaluate his criticism of contemporary civilization in the light of more recent developments in sociology, psychology, etc.18 II VEBLEN'S SYSTEM consists of a theory of the evolution of economic insti- tutions.19 It is most completely and most coherently stated in the work entitled The Instinct of Workmanship and the State of the Industrial Arts.20 In this work are expressed the basic abstractions of Veblen's system; several fundamental instincts and Darwinian causality.21 To- gether they shape the "working out" of Veblen's philosophy and lead to a comprehension of the implied positive synthesis in Veblen's system. For Veblen was interested in ultimate things and in terms of eighteenth- century traditions still sought the "heavenly city" at the end of the human rainbow. And this in spite of the fact that the leitmotif of his phi- losophy centers around his revolt against the absolute, final term of the 17 Cf. Henry S. Commager, The American Mind (New Haven, 1950), p. 239, who points out that the cultural lag which created the dichotomy between "pecuniary" and "industrial" employments is the focus of Veblen's system of thought. 18 Cf. Riesman, passim, who dislikes Veblen chiefly because he is not a mid-twentieth- century sociologist. 19 Karl Anderson, "The Unity of Veblen's Theoretical System," Quarterly Journal of Economics, XLVII (1933), p. 605. 20 This book is essentially a summary of his famous course, "The Economic Factors in Civilization."

To it he attributes a great many of the evil, destructive, and anti-survival inclinations in human institutions.24 In its continued existence he sees the demise of Western Civilization; in its subversion (ostensibly by a purification of the instinct of workmanship which has become corrupted) he envisions the triumph of a strongly anarchistic but utopian society. It was because of Veblen's strong personal dislike of anthropomorphism that he turned first to Kant,25 who, along with Spencer, seems greatly to have influenced the formulation of his system of philosophy. Perhaps it was because of his early preoccupation with Kant that Veblen found himself unable to formulate his philosophical system entirely on the basis of Darwinian precepts of brute causation or to attribute all things to pure human experiences as such.26 Nor was he willing to fall back on teleological explanations and seek to explain the more permanent factors at work in the phenomenon of existence by reference to supernatural powers. He sought explanation in the work of his contemporaries, in the instinct psychology of William James and William McDougall, and in the mutation theory of de Vries.27 Instincts could explain that which simple human experiences could not. Veblen's theory of society and social change rests to a large extent on the presupposition of two basic sets of non-willing agents in human behavior: "tropismatic attitudes" which were simple and also to be found 22 Morton G. White, Social Thought in America (New York, 1949), p. 13. 23 In his doctoral dissertation on the "Ethical Grounds of a Doctrine of Retribution," e.g., Veblen was intent on proving "why we need not believe in God." See Dorfman, T.V., p. 46, and also Daugert, p. 5. 24 Veblen is not clear about whether the teleological animus is a hereditary trait which arose by mutation or whether it is merely the product of "habituation" (an ac- quired trait!) which has perverted the "instinct of race solidarity." On the latter see Veblen's essay, "The Instinct of Workmanship and the Irksomeness of Labor," in Essays in our Changing Order, ed. Leon Ardzrooni (New York, 1934). In his book, In- stinct, written after the essay, the concept of race solidarity seems to be converted into some kind of kindly "parental bent." 25 Dorfman, Mind, p. 437; Daugert, pp. 19 and 21. 26 Nor could Veblen's contemporary at the University of Chicago in the 1890's, John Dewey.

Instincts were those native propensities which were conceived as innate and persistent properties of human nature, those definitely hereditary traits which distinguished the nature of man from that of the lower animals.30 All such instinctive action was in some degree intelligent.31 But in Veblen's system none of these "hereditary" proclivities or propensities were themselves the outcome of any intelligence. They resulted, rather, from selective adapta- tion, by the very nature of their being hereditary. Aside from the obvious Darwinian attitude explicit in this theory, a very distinct Kantian point of view is also present. Kant had argued (a) that man, as an empirical thing, was subject to causal laws, but that (b) man as a unique "thing in itself," namely as an intelligent being, was free and subject only to moral judgments and not to any causal law. Kant's conception of an intelligent being (thing in itself) is somewhat reminiscent of Veblen's concept of a human animal capable of intelligent action by virtue of higher instinctive proclivities which have come to him by means of selective adaptation, through heredity (the subject of causal law). Veblen argued that the action of all but two instincts was teleological.32 The two "good" instincts were the instinct of workmanship and idle curiosity.33 The instinct of workmanship was non-teleological because it had to do with the "proximate" action rather than with "ulterior," i.e., teleological, action. It was concerned with the "ways and means" of life.34 It was "in the main" a tendency to work out the ends which the "parental bent" made worth while.35 Idle curiosity was also non- 28 Veblen, Instinct, p. 1. 29 Cf. Dorfman, T.V., p. 324, who relates that Veblen discussed the instinct of work- manship with his colleague, the sociologist M. Paramalee, who wanted a strict biological definition for the term "instinct." But Veblen preferred to use it in a wide and "rather vague" sense. On the whole Veblen's theory of instincts very closely follows that of William McDougall. Cf.

That is, it might be contaminated by the instinct of workmanship.37 This "contamination," Veblen argued, was the product of an inverted parental bent which had deflected the instinct of workmanship from its original pursuit of maternal efficiency.38 Parental bent denoted Veblen's conception of THE GOOD. It was defined as the love of the parent toward his children extended to the community as a collective entity so that the members of the community, acting in accordance with collectivized parental bent, were community-centered rather than self-centered in their life orientation. Inversion of the parental bent, then, resulted in the rise of an individual-centered culture bent on self-aggrandizement.39 It might seem, therefore, that the concept of the parental bent contains the implied ethical norm of Veblen's system. The mainsprings of human behavior ought, but for the obstacles which impede it, to derive from the originally, basically, good, altruistic human nature with which man came into the world. Impediments to purity of human ethics are the result of a Darwinian devil-mutations.40 If Dorfman41 was correct in assuming that for Veblen, as for Kant, the "origin" of a critical philosophy was morality, i.e., responsibility for action, then the parental-bent concept was Veblen's way of expressing that moral judgment to which the intelligible being is subject in Kant's philosophy. It can logically follow then that if that bent became inverted (during the predatory-pecuniary stage of human culture), the standard of moral judgment was also distorted. Thus, for example, men came to deem it worthy to produce (wastefully to be sure) in the direction of self-aggrandizement, and true productivity 36 Ibid., p. 88. 37 Ibid., p. 89. See also Veblen's essays, "The Place of Science in Modern Civilization," and "The Evolution of the Scientific Point of View," reprinted in The Place of Science in Modern Civilization (New York, 1942), hereafter cited as Place. 38 Veblen, Instinct, p. 42 ff. 39 Inversion occurred when the community elders took something of an "authorita- tive" tone and blended "self-aggrandizement" with quasi-parental solitude, at first for the sake of the "collective good," but then if "predatory exploit" got the upper hand, the relationship deteriorated into a ruthless regime-provided, of course, that the rest of the community accepted its servile position. See ibid., p. 44-45. It is interesting to notice that Veblen has certain anarchistic tendencies which in this theory and elsewhere in his writings show up in the form of aversion to authority. Cf. Louis Schneider, The Freudian Psychology and Veblen's Social Theory (New York, 1948), p. 75, n. 67. 40 Veblen accounts for the origin of the evil and destructive proclivities which al- legedly emerged during the second or predatory phase of cultural development by suppos- ing them to have been due to mutations. But he qualifies the admission of evil by arguing that hybrids, such as Western peoples, tend to breed "true" to the original "type" of the peaceful, savage stage with which cultural evolution began. See Veblen, T.L.C., Chapter 9, passim. 41 Dorfman, Mind, p. 437. 207</page><page sequence="8">208 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology came to be deemed unworthy.42 Veblen, therefore, seems to have substituted his concept of parental bent for Kantian morality, which in turn had been based on the concept of an "as if." That is to say, the chief premise of Kant's moral phi- losophy was that the individual was to act "as if" there were a God or a higher moral being, for the existence of such a being, while not susceptible of proof, was necessary to moral philosophy. Now if Veblen did use parental bent in place of Kantian morality, he succeeded in eliminating the need for the "as if" by conceiving of parental bent as an instinctive proclivity which was itself the result of selective adaptation and brute causation, processes which did not involve "higher intelli- gence."43 With respect to the Kantian statement that the intelligent being is free, it is important to mention the implied assumption of a limited amount of free will in Vebien, co-existing as in Kant, with the necessi- tarian causation of nature: In man the instincts appoint less of a determinate sequence of action, and so leave a more open field for adaptation of behavior to the circum- stances of the case.44 Naturally this allows some choice as well as considerable room for inter- action between complex instinct and complex instinct, between instinct and environment, finally, between resulting institutions and instincts. Because of the opportunity for constant and "unremitting" interaction there is a chance for "cumulative causation" in the genesis of human cultural growth. Mankind, in Veblen's system, does not consist of isolated beings whose original habitat was a state of nature from whence they emerged by means of a social contract. Mankind consists, rather, of gregarious animals with a higher intelligence who are by nature parts of a social whole, whose institutional fabric influences them, and those institutions they 42 Veblen, Instinct, p. 350. The instinct of workmanship obviously contains insti- tutional components (see Schneider, p. 67), and such must logically be the case, for in Veblen's system the "material exigencies" of life determine the habits of thought and thus the institutional structure, and in this regard Veblen is Marxian. But institutions also evolve, and since they evolve because of a changed relationship between technology and the instinct of workmanship, Veblen, it might be argued, used instincts as guiding principles for evolutionary science. See Daugert, p. 73. 43 Veblen himself, however, admits that the principle of causal sequence is a matter of metaphysical imputation-the very thing he hates most. But he realizes that some such concept is a necessary basis for the systematization of knowledge of the facts of observation. See Veblen, Place, p. 33ff. He also accepts causal sequence as a necessary "metaphysical" tenet upon which to base his analysis in Instinct, vii. 4 Veblen, Instinct, p. 38.</page><page sequence="9">Thorstein Veblen's Positive Synthesis themselves fashion by virtue of the fact that these institutions are the products of human habits of thought which arise from economic life processes.45 It is perhaps true that the complex of human instincts are for Veblen guiding principles of human cultural evolution, but his more immediate and more clearly distinguishable determinant of human social develop- ment is a material one and one which he seems to derive almost directly from Marx.46 For Veblen there is really no such thing as an isolated economic interest, however. For him as for Marx the economic process is a human process.47 Thus Veblen's economic theory was also a theory of cultural evolution and a social philosophy.48 III MUCH MORE THAN FOR MARX, cultural evolution was for Veblen the function of a theory of the divided (bifurcate) systematization of knowl- edge in modern learning.4' Unlike Marx, who believed the opposite, Veblen assumed that the method of the natural sciences was not the same as the method of the social sciences, and he took pains to trace the problems to its origin, to remnants of thinking procedures characteristic of bygone eras. Even primitive peoples had methods for systematizing knowledge, he argued, but these were animistically inspired "dramaturgic life histories."50 But the hope of a more scientific logic was present even in that dim past, for underlying primitive animism was "an obscure system of [matter-of-fact] generalizations," which was "obscurer than the dramatic generalizations only in the sense that [they were] left in the background as being less picturesque and of less vital interest," for they were not "less familiar, less adequately apprehended, or less secure."51 This underlying layer, which had been largely overlooked by cultural historians, dealt with everyday experiences and was the basis of the kind of knowledge conceived in terms of mechanistic processes rather than by anthropomorphic imputation.52 45 Daugert, p. 68. 46 Ibid., p. 70. 47 Ibid., p. 68; Veblen, Place, p. 39. 48 Daugert, p. 69. 49 Veblen, Place, p. 45. Systematization of knowledge depends also on "idle curios- ity," that force by which men "more or less insistently want to know things, yet (in its pure form) without ulterior motives connected with self-aggrandizement attached." Like the instinct of workmanship, idle curiosity is pliable. See Instinct, p. 85-86. 50 Veb!en, Place, p. 40. 51 Ibid., p. 41. 52 But in primitive man the attitude toward tools, daily work, etc., is often animistic and not as distinct as Veblen believed it to be-although there is also something in what he said. 1 5 209</page><page sequence="10">210 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology The matter-of-fact generalizations, Veblen claimed, were systematized into a body of knowledge called "the state of the industrial arts."53 But anthropomorphic knowledge reflected the habits of life embodied in the institutional structure of society.54 Further, ... in all succeeding phases of culture, developmentally subsequent to the primitive phase . . . there is found a similar or analogous division of knowledge between a higher range of theoretical explanations of phenomena, an ornate scheme of things on the one hand, and such an obscure range of matter-of-fact generalizations as is here spoken of, on the other.55 That category of knowledge dealing with mechanistic processes of brute causation, then, "is the only substantial factor in the growth of tech- nological insight and proficiency."56 The anthropomorphic or ornate category, however, has always been an "unmitigated hindrance to effective work and to technological advance."57 It is against the background of this two-sided scheme for the system- atization of knowledge (one side of which, it is significant to note, is guided by the instinct of workmanship) that Veblen traces the process of cultural growth. Thus the history of man turns out to be a struggle between the destructive and constructive proclivities of humankind; a protracted strife between good and evil, between enlightened science and anthropomorphic superstition. Progress in the industrial arts de- pends, in the final analysis, upon the degree to which destructive pro- clivities have contaminated the constructive ones in human nature. And since the economic and the human process are identical, it is, further, upon the triumph of the constructive that the survival of the "race" depends.58 Technological knowledge was by nature . . of a common stock, held and carried forward collectively by the community, which is in this relation to be conceived as a going concern. The state of the industrial arts is a fact of group life, not of individual or private initiative or innovation.59 53 Veblen, Place, p. 44. 54 Ibid. 55 Ibid. For example, feudal robber barons are not the direct antecedents of modern businessmen, but both are expressions of the same type of knowledge. See ibid., p. 33ff. Veblen is implying that the so-called ruling classes always embody an outmoded system of values and exemplify the cultural lag. 56 Ibid., p. 42. 57 Ibid. 58 Veblen, Instinct, p. 81: "Anthropomorphic insight does not penetrate into the secret ways of brute matter ... it is only the blindfold, unsystematic accretions of opaque fact coming in, disjointed and unsympathetic, from the inhuman side of his technological experience that can help him...."</page><page sequence="11">Thorstein Veblen's Positive Synthesis 211 It was in the earlier, peaceable phase of culture, the so-called "savage" phase, when man adapted himself to his environment as it was then constituted, that technological knowledge was available to all the members of the community.60 But in the second, predatory, barbarian phase of development, with the ascendancy of the destructive, animistic proclivities, the "inversion" of the parental bent, the "contamination" of the instinct of workmanship (in short, the fall from Grace)-and with the con- comitant rise of a leisure class,61 prescriptive conventions, etc.-the tech- nological heritage of the earlier phase, dependent upon peaceful existence as it was, not only deteriorated, but control of the community's knowledge fell into the hands of a master class. Cultural stagnation and retardation set in. And yet Veblen admits that the case of Western culture has been different. In the West the rise of destructive forces has not always implied the decline of all constructive forces. Pecuniary culture in Western civilization has enjoyed a secondary, peaceable phase which distinguishes Western pecuniary culture from the predatory phase with 59 Ibid., p. 103. Cf. Edward Bellamy, Looking Backward (Boston, New York, 1887), p. 136. It is significant to note that Veblen turned to study economics after reading Bel- lamy. The book made a tremendous impression upon him. See, e.g., Dorfman, T.V., p. 68; Charles Madison, Critics and Crusaders (New York, 1947-48' p. 310. Cf. also John S. Gambs, Beyond Supply and Demand (New York, 1946), p. 22, who perceives that Veblen had a "strong Utopian bias." 60 Veblen traced the evolution of human culture from such a quasi-communist stage, through barbarism, toward utopia in almost all of his major works. The most detailed description of such cultural evolution is to be found in his T.L.C., however, for after 1906 evolution declined in pre-eminence in his methodology, and he focused on technology and problems of contemporary change (Daugert, p. 99). But it is precisely in regard to his analysis of current problems that his evolutionism made itself most useful as a tool of analysis and for prognosis. 61 Of course production must be above subsistence before a leisure class can either arise or be maintained. See Veblen, Instinct, 149ff. Cf. Karl Marx, Zur Kritik der Politischen Oekonomie (Stuttgart, 1920), xxii: "Es ist eine hergebrachte Verstellung, dass in gewissen Perioden nur von Raub gelebt ward. Um aber rauben zu koennen muss etwas zu rauben da sein, also Produktion." Veblen on the whole rejected Marx's system but did accept a good deal of his cultural analysis. Cf. Veblen, "The Economics of Karl Marx: II," in Place, p. 437, n. 8: ". . . his work must be construed from such a point of view and in terms of such elements as will enable his results to stand substantially sound and convincing." Certainly Veblen did accept the results of Marxian analysis with regard to the direction of social evolution in a capitalist society. Veblen charged that business enterprise was engrossing the usufruct of the community's technology and that "big" business enterprises, which controlled a substantial amount of the output, were deliberately sabotaging the economy and were concentrating more and more economic power in their hands. Such a view is much the same as Marx's conception of the capitalist engrossing the surplus value of production and the increasing concentration of capital in the hands of the "few." Veblen's most mature statement of his "sabotage theory" is to be found in his Absentee Ownership and Business Enterprise in Recent Times (New York, 1923). But Veblen was never the propagandist Marx was, nor was he optimistic about the ability of the working population to set up a new order. Marx always remained romantic in his outlook. Veblen refused to become so, for he identified romantic optimism with anthropomorphism.</page><page sequence="12">212 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology which the pecuniary stage commenced in the era of lower barbarianism (antiquity) during which the many great dynastic empires of the Old World repeatedly closed their "life cycles."62 Despite the peaceable phase which pecuniary culture enjoys in the Western world, its institutions were still "drawn in terms of differential advantage," sentiments "converged on emulative gain," and there was an "invidiously conspicuous waste of goods." How is it then that the growth of technology was furthered, "'even if permissively?"63 Veblen's answer is simple. Not only does the use of such concepts as "profit" and "loss" habituate men to think in units of an "impersonal"64 magni- tude, but most significant for understanding Veblen's own animus is his belief that At the same time the instinct of workmanship, being not an acquired trait, has not been got rid of by disuse; and when the occasion offers, under the relatively tranquil conditions of this peaceable or quasi-peace- able pecuniary regime, the ancient proclivity asserts itself in its ancient force, uneager and asthenic perhaps, but pervasive and resilient.65 As a result an era of petty trade and handicraft emerges. Concomitantly there is a tendency to give precedence to the commonweal as against the Crown or State, an acceleration in the rate of improvement in the state of the mechanical arts, and the rise of a middle class.66 There is also a reversal to some of the "spiritual attitudes" of the savage stage, but there is by no means a reversal to the social structure of that era. Workmanship was "compounded and combined with ownership"; it was "coupled with an invidious emulation and consequently with a system of institutions embodying a range of prescriptive benefits."67 The discipline of life under a handicraft economy gave rise to certain habits of thought (principles) which became part of the Gestalt of insti- tutions arising in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. 62 Veblen, Instinct, p. 171. 63 Ibid., p. 199. 64 Meaning an unteleological and hence constructive magnitude. 65 Veblen, Instinct, pp. 200, 201 ff. Only in Western civilization has the instinct of workmanship been able to reassert itself, says Veblen, for under the despotic condi- tions of Eastern civilizations the instinct was stifled by long protracted discipline under a predatory scheme of life. Consequently those civilizations decayed. 66 Ibid. p. 203. 67 Ibid., p. 204. Notice the strong dialectical quality of Veblen's reasoning: savage stage = thesis, predatory phase = antithesis, and handicraft stage = synthesis. Harris, passim, points out that Veblen seemed to use Darwinian concepts of selection, variation, and survival (adaptation) as a sort of Hegelian dialectic. In that case the following would be a possible scheme: savage stage = stage of selection, predatory phase = phase of variation, and handicraft stage = stage of adaptation. And the human types which doninate in each era reflect the characteristics of this schematization. In this respect Veblen somewhat surpasses Weber's use of ideal types, for he puts his into a time con- tinuum, and Weber did not.</page><page sequence="13">Thorstein Veblen's Positive Synthesis They came to dominate the institutional fabric of modern society even though the discipline of the life and modes of production changed again.68 In the meantime, also, the handicraft system had broken down and man had entered a new phase of pecuniary culture, a phase dominated by a sharper and sharper division of labor between industry and business.9 But the worst danger to modern society, Veblen believed, was the business operated industry according to business rather than according to engineer- ing principles. Businessmen were men thinking in terms of self-aggran- dizement, men whose apprehension of knowledge was done in terms of a perverted instinct of workmanship, and although they knew nothing about the technical problems of the industry they controlled, they were gaining control of larger and larger segments of industry and were indulg- ing their "sportsmanlike propensities" at the "gaming tables of High Finance."70 Business enterprise and salesmanship were the modern versions of that wasteful, ornate, feudal, and destructive institution, sportsmanship. However, the growth of machine technology would perhaps finally undo the evil wrought, because Both in its incidence on the workman and on the members of the com- munity at large, therefore, the training given by the current state of indus- trial arts is a training in the impersonal, quantitative apprehension and appreciation of things, and it tends strongly to inhibit and discredit all imputation of spiritual traits to the facts of observation.71 Now let us recall that in Veblen's system the instinct of workmanship reasserts itself, and so does parental-bent altruism, when anthropomorphic ways of thought decline. It would seem therefore, that a final term, something ultimate, is implied in all of Veblen's socio-historical analysis 68 Veblen argued, ibid., Chapter 4, passim, that modes of production shift constantly and engender new habits of thought which are in turn systematized and incorporated into existing bodies of knowledge. The nature of production processes tends to shape insti- tutions which arise. Under the handicraft system, therefore, concepts such as the God concept took on the aspect of the routine of production in daily life and God came to be conceived as a Great Artificer. But by the time the institutional structure has crystallized the routine of daily life has already changed and new institutions become necessary. This change is accelerated under peaceful conditions, and therefore (by implication) peace might abolish the perpetual cultural lag which has nagged the development of human culture. 69 A fuller treatment of this problem is found in Veblen's The Theory of Business Enterprise (New York, 1904) and in his Absentee Ownership and Business Enterprise in Recent Times. The former, written almost twenty years earlier, is far more optimistic. Veblen grew progressively more disillusioned as he grew older. 70 "Sportsmanlike" or "sportsmanship" does not have a positive meaning in Veblen's vocabulary. He means the opposite of workmanship by these terms, viz., time spent unproductively. Unfortunately he did not perceive that idle curiosity was often much like sportsmanship as did e.g. Johann Huizinga, Homo Ludens, A Study of the Play Ele- ments in Culture (Boston, Beacon paperback ed., 1955). 71 Veblen, Instinct, p. 318. 213</page><page sequence="14">214 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology of the crisis of modern society. Do Veblen's schematized interpretations of Western history really lead him to the hope of a utopian future for Western man? Iv MANY OF VEBLEN'S CRITICS, carried away by the idea of the instinct of workmanship, find that there is indeed a promise of fulfillment. Gambs, for example, believed that we were on the threshold of an era "in which the creative instinct can learn to function without contamination" among the industrial masses, and that a utopian industrial republic could then be achieved.72 And Professor Schneider believes that Veblen was saying that if only "certain distinctive institutional furniture were removed . . . there would ensue a blossoming life and a material welfare unprecedented since the savage stage."73 But perhaps such statements read too much into Veblen and do not take cognizance of some very definite qualifica- tions he made, which in fact ruin his mechanistic-process-habituation thesis. Veblen concluded that the technological spirit (animus) did not comport with the "native strain of human nature in those peoples that are subject to its discipline,"74 for .. .however exacting and however pervasive the discipline of the machine process may be, it can not, after all, achieve its perfect work in the way of habituation in the population of Christendom as it stands. The limit of tolerance native to the race, physically and spiritually, is short of that unmitigated materialism and unremitting mechanical routine to which the machine technology incontinently drives.75 Further, the only groups in society who might logically have improved the situation, namely those engaged in "industrial" employments, the engineers and the workers who more than anyone else were "unremit- tingly" subjected to the machine process, were themselves being con- taminated by the "animus" of business enterprise.76 "The drift of work- day discipline, as well as of deliberate instruction, sets in the conservative direction."77 So for the "immediate future" it looked to Veblen, just after World War I, as if the destructive forces of anthropomorphism would triumph: 72 Gambs, p. 37. 73 Schneider, p. 75.

Nor did he think that the removal of a few irksome pieces of "institutional furniture" would bring on "unprecedented material welfare." Of course he did favor the establishment of a "Soviet of Engineers"81 which might direct the life of society in accordance with truly scientific principles, but knew very well that the chances for its coming into existence were remote.82 Nevertheless he did, while he was on the faculty of the New School for Social Re- search, try to encourage engineers to take a more active part in business management.83 And even though engineers have not replaced business- men in the management of business enterprise, the computers and the men who program them may replace both and prove Veblen to have been right again. Although Veblen might have been unwilling to describe a final, positive stage of human development, he did leave room for the emergence of a Golden Age in the remote future, for a remote posterity, possibly only remotely related to us. Veblen believed that he was above all else a scientist because he did not hesitate to apply what he believed was a social-science-logic, free of anthropomorphism, one which stressed brute causation and selective adaptation. The application of his unrelenting logic to the history of Western culture led him to believe that even if 78 Ibid. 79 Veblen, The Engineers and The Price System, p. 103. 80 Veblen, Absentee Ownership, p. 425 81 Veblen, The Engineers and the Price System, passimn. 82 Ibid., 134. 83 Edwin Layton, "Veblen and the Engineers," American Quarterly, XIV (1962), 64-72. Layton defines engineer too narrowly and seems to delight in proving Veblen wrong-engineers will never take over business management. The types of engineers common to Veblen's day would not be the ones to replace business executives, but the giant computers and the engineers who program them, and who even now run automatic plants, may very well do so. 215</page><page sequence="16">216 The American Journal of Economics and Sociology it was not possible for the West to develop sufficient institutional insight84 to save its teetering civilization, and that even if Western man were further limited by his genetic make-up, that it did not therefore necessarily follow that all humanity was doomed. Veblen believed that man was himself the product of an evolutionary process and subjected to selective adaptation. And it was his faith in science which provided him with consolation in the face of his almost Nietzschean pessimism, which led him to express the hope that in the long run human cultural evolution would achieve a positive synthesis: Compare . . . what has been said above . . . of the variability and adapta- bility of a hybrid population and the possible selective establishment of a hybrid type more suitable to current conditions of life than any one of the racial stocks out of which the hybrid population is made up.85 Obviously, therefore, the evil and destructive tendencies in man could not triumph because of the very nature of their destructiveness. Their ascendancy would create a crisis severe enough to bring civilization into its death agony, for they were lethal by nature and by definition. If they triumphed, the organism would come to be unadapted to its environment and would perish.86 Thus Veblen could conclude that It seems possible to say this much, that the full dominion of business enterprise is necessarily a transitory dominion. It stands to lose in the end whether the one or the other of the two divergent cultural tendencies wins, because it is incompatible with the ascendancy of either.87 Hence the good, constructive and non-anthropomorphic forces must win in the long run. If they do not, the cultural organism will perish and nature will bring forth an organism possessed of the constructive tendencies necessary for survival.88 Good triumphs by reason of natural selection! Yet, ironically perhaps, Veblen, who built his entire system of philoso- phy on the idea that a metaphysical absolute and the anthropomorphic epistemology which it presupposed undermined the viability of human society in an evil and destructive manner, was forced to admit89 that his substitute concept of natural causal sequence was itself a metaphysical postulate. Was the idea of natural selection then in itself evil? University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada 84 VP^hen, Instinct, p. 25. 85 Ibid., p. 320, n. 2. 86 Cf.
