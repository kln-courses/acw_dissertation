<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXCAVATIONS IN THE PLAIN OF LASITHI. II. THE following pages give an account of the first half of the excavations conducted on behalf of the British School in June 1937. The party con- sisted of Mr. J. D. S. Pendlebury, Miss M. Money-Coutts, and Miss M. Pascoe. Emmanoueles Akoumianos was again kindly lent by the School to act as foreman. Thanks to the courtesy of the authorities we had the pleasure of the assistance of Mr. Kh. N. Petrou, Assistant-Director of Candia Museum. His arrival did not take place until after the excavations here described had been finished. He was, however, present during the trial excavations on Karphi and the Papoura, at Donadhes, Kolonna, and Kerasa, the results of which will be the subject of a later report. We also wish to acknowledge the help and interest shown by the local authorities of Tzermiadho, particularly by Mr. Sphakianakes, the Schoolmaster. Figs. 2-6 have been redrawn from our surveys by Mr. C. Hart of Cambridge. The work was rendered possible by a grant from the Craven Fund of Cambridge University. Note.-Included in this report is a description of the Cave of Meskine, excavated in 1938. This completes such profitable work as can be done on the Neolithic to Middle Minoan III sites in the neighbourhood, with the exception of the Argoulia Cave in the village, a matter of great expense and doubtful value, and possible finds of scattered rock-shelters.

The following objects, all said to be from the Cave of Trapeza or immediately outside, were recovered from the peasants in 1937 and 1938. I. (Fig. Ia). Pedestalled cup in mottled limestone. This joins one of the fragments numbered 16 in the catalogue. Height 4"4 cms., diameter 5"3 cms.; cf. a finer example from Mokhlos, Tomb XXI, No. 7. Probably EM II but, owing to its coarser shape might be EM III. 2. (Fig. Ia). Small lid in brown steatite pierced for strings to tie it on to a vase. Height Io cm., greatest diameter 2.9 cms. Cf. caps of clay vases EM I, e.g., from Agios Onouphrios (P of M I Fig. 23). EM II. 3. (Fig. Ia). Two fragments of bone seal. Conoid. Height "7 cms., diameter 2.2 cms. Pierced horizontally by three holes, two side by side, one at right angles. Curvilinear design. Cf. from Kalathiana (VTM P1. VIII 815). EM III. 4. Base of marble bowl. Diameter of base 3.0 cms.

Some 70 metres east of the cave, close to the south-east corner of the hill, a few fragments of an undecorated Middle Minoan I pithos and a fragment of a stone axe too small to give any idea of its type were found in a shallow deposit on a small terrace. B. In a cleft in the rock 40 metres east of the cave, dignified by the name of Too Fpvpynv r6 o-rriatio, were found most of the pieces of a Neolithic vase (see below p. I6 and Plate V, I), a handle of a fabric similar to ' Trapeza Ware', and a number of sherds, including the base of a tripod which could not be dated more closely than to the Early Minoan Period generally. A few Byzantine sherds also occurred. I 2 3 FIG. I a. C. A somewhat confused deposit came to light on a small terrace about 20 metres east of the cave. Most of the sherds ranged from Neolithic to Middle Minoan I-i.e., the main period of the cave itself from which they probably came. In addition to these were a few sherds of Late Minoan I fabric. Finally there were the remains of a Late Minoan III a larnax with a gable lid which had apparently contained three bodies. To this burial belonged two stirrup vases, the base of a kylix, a large painted jar, several small cups, and an open painted dish (see below, page 45), as well as three stone beads (i, 53 and 54). D. On another terrace 20o metres to the west of Trapeza a peasant had found during the autumn of 1936 fragments of two Middle Minoan I pithoi and other sherds of the same date (see below, page 23), as well as a squat stirrup vase of Late Minoan III b date (see below, page 45 and Plate IV, 3)- From this area came the EM III seal No. Io a already published among the finds from Trapeza.2 1 In the following pages the number in brackets after an object denotes the catalogue number. 2 BSA XXXVI 98.</page><page sequence="4">4 H.

II. 5 IV. THE CAVE OF SKAPHIDHIA (Plate I, I; Fig. 2). A quarter of an hour north of the village of Tzermiadho runs a line of cliffs which eventually join the west end of the Trapeza plateau. They are fronted by a thick growth of ilex trees, which makes the examination of them a matter of some difficulty. Many shallow caves occur, and from the top left-hand corner of one, 2 metres above the floor, a narrow hole about 50 cms. in diameter leads to a small chamber some 4 metres by 2, with a height never exceeding 70 cms. Only the inmost 2 metres contained any earth. This had been covered with a thin film of stalactite, above which was found the small Early Minoan I suspension pot (see p. 22 and Plate IV, 2). There is a stalactite pillar near the south wall. In the main body of the cave the first 20 cms. below the surface produced sherds from open bowls, tubular handles, rims, and other sherds of Late Neolithic date, some with a good burnish, but most rQugh, as well as a few sherds of typical Trapeza Ware. There were many bones, mostly of animals, but some, including a jaw bone, undoubtedly human. Below this arbitrary level to bed-rock, which slopes down to a maximum depth of 50 cms. to the south- west, the same Late Neolithic ware was found, but with a bigger proportion of well-burnished and well-finished fragments. A few incised and punc- tuated sherds appeared also. Bones, again mostly animal, occurred. In the narrow space south of the stalactite the level of the surface shelved down slightly, so that the 20 cms. of deposit was actually on a level with the lower stratum in the cave proper. A small crack in the rock at the east end of this space led to the outside cave, but appeared to have been blocked for a considerable time. The sherds from this space were of the same type as those from the lower stratum in the main chamber, but included one which was ripple burnished. There is no doubt that this cave was used as a burial-place in Neolithic times. It is certainly too small for habitation. Unfortunately the human remains were too scanty to show how many bodies had been interred. It is unlikely that there were more than two. The very slight difference between the two strata, 0-20 cms. and 20-40 cms. (including in this latter the space behind the stalactite), below the surface may indicate some lapse of time between different interments, though, as has been said, the level was taken quite arbitrarily, no change of earth occurring. The pottery from the former corresponded with that from the burial'in Test 4 (L Io) on the Kastellos (see below, page 9), that from the latter with the pottery from Test i i (D 3) on the same site. The total number of vases represented at Skaphidhia is more than the combined total of the other two. It is, however, possible that the difference visible between the two strata is a matter of style rather than of date, and that there was only one body near which the better vases were placed.</page><page sequence="6">6 H. W. AND J. D. S. PENDLEBURY AND M. B. MONEY-COUTTS V. THE CAVE OF MESKINE ('THE LEPER') This cave lies about 400 metres east of the Skaphidhia Cave. It is entered from a small flat terrace in a fold of the cliffs behind the Trapeza Plateau. From the entrance the cave runs due west for about 6 metres, then, after a quick turn north and east, continues towards the north for another 15. At the entrance the height is nearly 2 metres, but diminishes steadily until at the far end the roof is within 40 cms. of the floor. The width is fairly constant at 2 metres. The depth of earth varies consistently from 40 to 60 cms., though outcrops of rock almost reach the surface in places. Five tests were made. Few sherds were found, all belonging to MM I or MM III, with the exception of three Neolithic sherds. There was no stratification, but in the third test, which was made in the turn of the cave just before the final stretch, the remains of a MM I pithos and human bones were found crushed under a fallen rock. No other human bones were found in the cave, and the only object not of pottery was an iron nail in two fragments (370), which is probably modern. In conclusion we can safely say that this cave was used as a rock-shelter for a Middle Minoan I pithos burial, and probably for more than one belonging to that period and the succeeding Middle Minoan III. The Neolithic sherds are too few, indeterminate, and scattered to show whether the cave was inhabited or was used as a burial-place at that time. VI. THE KASTELLOS. A. Position and Previous Explorations (Plate I, 3, 4; Fig. 3). The Kastellos Tzermiadhon is a bold bluff which runs out from the slopes of Psarokorphe about ten minutes east of the village. It rises to a height of about 320o ft. above the plain. To west, east, and south the sides are fairly precipitous, but to the north it is connected with the cliffs behind by a kind of causeway, from the end of which a steep path reaches the summit. It can never have been of strategic importance. It dominates one route into the plain of Lasithi-that from Potamoi via Zarmas '--but that was never an important route. Its nearest water supply is, to-day, at the wells called Pigaidhakia, which lie behind the Trapeza plateau. It did, however, in early times offer a safe habitation, well above the then marshy plain, and easily defensible in case of need. The site had been discovered by Sir Arthur Evans (Academy 20.6.96), and it is mentioned by Taramelli (Mon. Ant. IX 415). Both of these explorers labelled it a prehistoric citadel. Like Trapeza, it seems to have 1 Cf. BSA XXXVI p. 8. Route 5b.</page><page sequence="7">EXCAVATIONS IN THE PLAIN OF LASITHI. II. 7 KASTELLOS TZEKMIADHON SUMM1T.

MONEY-COUTTS remained unvisited by archaeologists until the writers with Mr. R. W. Hutchinson examined it in June 1935. Further surface examinations were carried out in May 1936 during the course of the excavations at Trapeza, and it was decided that it was clearly the next site to be attacked, as being the most likely to reveal the dwellings of those buried in and around the cave in Early Minoan and Middle Minoan I times. Accordingly it was the object of our first tests in June 1937. B. The Excavation (Plates I, 5; II; Figs. 3-6). The summit of the hill was surveyed and divided for convenience of reference into squares of 5-metre sides, these being labelled from east to west by letters of the alphabet and from north to south by numbers. On the highest point, which had been taken as the bench mark, a small concrete pillar was set up marking the juncton of the four squares H and I, 16 and 17. Thus, though in the opinion of the excavators all the information possible has been extracted from the site, future explorers will be enabled to find the exact position of each test. The summit itself has been very largely denuded and, as soon as it became clear that the plan of no complete town site was recoverable, it seemed advisable to confine the excavations to test-pits at various points, clearing every building that was found, but abandoning the hope of a second Gournia. The various tests will be summarised in the order in which they were excavated and as each is marked on the general plan. C. Summary of the Results. Test I (LM 1-2).

On this floor rested the bases of two of the Archaic pithoi. To the west was probably a small open court, in the north-east corner of which the door led into the first room. Against the south wall of this was a small partition fenced in by upright stones. It resembles a fireplace, but contains no trace of burning. A test-pit in this room revealed another floor of reddish plaster 35 cms. below the later one. Below this the bed-rock varies in depth from 45 to 75 cms. In the east room the rock floor rises sharply and forms most of the floor. In the south-east corner, however, below the mud floor, is a wall of small rough stones belonging to an earlier building with a different orientation. o-50 cms.

From the excavation of the Cave of Trapeza 1 it was clear that the Neolithic inhabitants had used the cave as a dwelling-place as did also the makers of' Trapeza Ware,' a fabric which seems to have begun in the Late Neolithic Period and to have continued through the Sub-Neolithic into the Early Minoan I Period.2 Perhaps before the end of Early Minoan I, certainly by the beginning of Early Minoan II, the cave had fallen into disuse as a dwelling-place, but was used as a burial-place for the Bronze Age population which had now ventured to live in the open. It continued in use as a cemetery throughout Early Minoan III. Whether it retained this character in Middle Minoan I or whether it had by that time become a place of offerings only is uncertain.3 The evidence of the present excavations fills in the gaps neatly. We 1 BSA XXXVI I4 if. 2 This is clear from the scantiness of EM I sherds in the cave and on the Kastellos. 3 BSA XXXVI 23. Burials in caves and rock shelters were, of course, common in MM I, particularly in North and Central Crete-e.g. Knossos, JHS LV i68; Mallia, BCH 1929 527 and Meskine, see above, p. 6.</page><page sequence="15">EXCAVATIONS IN THE PLAIN OF LASITHI. II. 15 find the inhabitants of Trapeza employing smaller versions of their dwelling- place for the abode of the dead. The Skaphidhia Cave and Tests 4 (L Io) and i i (D 3) provide good examples. From the amount of Trapeza Ware found generally over the Kastellos it would seem that before that ware ceased to be made the makers had already begun to settle the site. It is unfortunate that the summit of the Kastellos has been so denuded. On such a bare rocky site there is so little accumulation of earth that subsequent builders were always apt to sweep away all traces of previous occupation in order to obtain good foundations. It seems clear, however, from the sherds found in Tests 3 (I-J Io-II) and 6 (H-I 13-I4) and in the rubbish dumps of Tests 4 (L io), 5 (K 14), 8 (F-G 15) that the settlement to which the Early Minoan II-III burials in Trapeza belonged was situated here. To Middle Minoan I belongs the foundation of the two houses dis- covered in Tests 7 (G 20) and 9 (F I). That is clear from the results of test-pits below the floor. The burial-place of the inhabitants was evidently on the slopes of the Trapeza plateau (see above, A III, A and D), if not in the cave itself as well. Middle Minoan II as a period did not exist in this district. A few vases of this style were imported from the great centres and received the honour of being buried or offered in Trapeza,' but not one sherd was found on the Kastellos. Indeed, Tests 7 (G 20) and 9 (F I) prove that the Middle Minoan III Period succeeded immediately on to the Middle Minoan I, since it is clear that the occupation of these two houses is continuous. By this time the Cave of Trapeza must have fallen into disuse even for offerings. The mantle of sanctity descended on the Diktaian Cave at Psykhro, 4 miles away on the other side of the plain, and the burial-place was changed to the slopes of the Kastellos itself (Tests 13-16, N 17 and I8, L I8). In the Late Minoan I Period the site seems to have been practically deserted, Tests 2 (M 4) and 8 (F-G 15) alone providing sherds of that date. No doubt, in the regular fashion of that day, the small Lasithiote sites tended to be deserted in favour of the larger centres of Plate and, in the present case, of the Papoura. At all events, objects of Late Minoan date are extremely rare in this district (cf. A III, C and D). In the Intermediate Period (i.e., the so-called Sub-Minoan-Proto- geometric Period, see p. 134) the low-lying sites were abandoned for the peak of Karphi. Gradually at the beginning of the Geometric Period the popula- tion is tempted down again. By Archaic times the Papoura and its suburbs of Donadhes and Kolonna form a thriving city, with a sizable town at 1 BSA XXXVI p. 43 Nos. 163-5; p. 68 Nos. 543, 4, 6.</page><page sequence="16">16 H.

The Pottery. (Plates IV-VI; Figs. 7-19.) Neolithic. (Plate V, I; Fig. 7.) The earliest pottery found during 1937 comes from the Skaphidhia Cave. As has already been suggested, it is probable that the deposit found here represents burials of more than one date, and that the first interment was disturbed in order to make room for a later one. The sherds from below oo20 (N 1-18 in the catalogue below) are generally burnished, and resemble in their fabric and their occasional incised or punctuated decoration the Neolithic sherds from the Trapeza Cave.2 They appear to be from bowls with either straight or outsplayed sides, and often with tubular handles, but are too much broken for reconstruction. From the corresponding pocket behind the stalactite come two well-burnished sherds which are yellowish in colour instead of the usual black, and one which is distinctly ripple burnished (N 18). The latter finish is rare after the end of the Middle Neolithic Period,3 but, since it is unlikely that the yellowish sherds are earlier than Late Neolithic, may in this instance merely show a survival of technique. Its occurrence does, however, imply that some of the deposit is not so late as the Sub-Neolithic Period, to which the unburnished wares of the upper level must belong. The earliest remains at Skaphidhia, as at Trapeza, should therefore be contemporary with the Late Neolithic of Knossos. Neolithic sherds, occasionally incised, were also found on various parts of the Kastellos, but the only important deposit was that connected with the burial in Test 4. Here again no whole or restorable pots were recovered, but some six or more bowls of the usual rather amorphous type seem to be represented. Two sherds, one perhaps showing a flat base and the other with incisions below the rim, are described in the detailed catalogue below (N 19 and N 20). The other fragments are mostly burnished, but less carefully than those from Skaphidhia, so that, although there is little which can be called Sub-Neolithic, it is likely that the burial should be dated to the very end of the Neolithic Period proper. It seems, at all events, to precede that of Test I I, where Trapeza Ware predominated. The most interesting Neolithic find is a deep, round-bodied, vessel from the Grymani rock-shelter (N 2I). Both the shape and the vague pattern 1 Test 7 (G 20o). 2 BSA XXXVI 26 ff. 3 P of MI 36-38 fig. 5; II 9 n. .</page><page sequence="17">EXCAVATIONS IN THE PLAIN OF LASITHI. II. 17 burnishing of this vessel appear to be unique, but since pattern burnishing is found on EM I pottery in Central Crete,' it seems that it should not be dated very early. It is, however, utterly unlike Trapeza Ware, and unless it is an import, which is made improbable by the occurrence of a sherd in precisely similar fabric in Test 12 on the Kastellos, must be dated to the end of the Neolithic Period, with the warning that this may make it contem- porary with Sub-Neolithic in other parts of the island. In 1938 a third cave, that of Meskine, was tested, and here again the earliest sherds were Neolithic. These were few and scattered, and gave the impression of being the result of habitation rather than of burial. They are of the usual type, but none are incised. A rock-shelter some 70 metres west of Skaphidhia also produced a few Neolithic fragments. (Note.-The numbers are continued in sequence from those of the Neolithic sherds from Trapeza, BSA XXXVI 28.)

II. 19 unburnished, but often wiped over in such a way as to produce shallow scorings; on the other hand, although the colour varies from purplish-red to black, owing to uneven firing, only a few sherds show the typical small mottling of Trapeza Ware. Some rims (T. 31-33) are evidently from straight-sided vessels, and much of the side of one of these (T. 33), which resembles in shape T. 17, could be pieced together. Another (T. 34) is turned up to form a collar neck, and perhaps shows the first stage in the development of the 'two-storied' pot of which no specimens occurred. The pitted sherds (T. 35) recall T. 16. Bases are too often lacking, but were probably generally rounded, although one which is definitely flattened seems to belong to the collar-necked vessel referred to above (T. 34). Handles are tubular with the exception of the small imperfectly pierced lug on T. 36. The fabric of this fragment, as well as its provenance, argues that it is Sub-Neolithic, and although vertically pierced lugs are generally considered not to begin before EM I, they occur on a pot from the Miamou cave 1 which should date from the very beginning of this period, while the present specimen, with its inner divisions, finds its most direct parallel in a Middle Neolithic vessel from Knossos.2 It perhaps affords added proof of the fact that Trapeza Ware in Lasithi overlapped with EM I in other parts of Crete, although the Trapeza Ware of Skaphidhia must at least be earlier than the small tripod pot (Bowls I) which was found on the surface there. The sherds under discussion cannot, at all events, be widely separated in date from their counterparts from Trapeza itself, and the differences which exist between the two deposits are probably due to the fact that Skaphidhia was used as a burial-place and Trapeza as a dwelling. On the Kastellos the two most important finds of Trapeza Ware were in the lower levels of Tests 3 and i 1. The deposit in the former area seems to have been due to habitation. It includes some mottled sherds and many which are merely badly fired. The shapes represented are much the same as those from the Trapeza Cave, and there are sherds both from 'two- storied' pots and from heavy, burnished cooking-vessels (cf. T. 9 and T. 24). The only new type is a small flat base with vague incisions (T. 37) which from its roughly rectangular contour seems possibly to belong to some sort of tray similar to that cited above in connection with T. 36. The remains in Test i i may have been connected with a burial. They consist almost entirely of Trapeza Ware, although a few Neolithic sherds and one of powdery grey EM I ware again give proof of the Sub-Neolithic date of this pottery. On the whole the fragments resemble those from Trapeza rather than those from Skaphidhia. No new shapes are repre- sented, but there are several sherds from 'two-storied' pots and two specimens of' tress' decoration (cf. T. 9). Two different types of handles did, however, come to light. One (T. 38) resembles Neolithic handles 1 P of MI 58 Fig. 17, 3. 2 Ibid. I 37 Fig. 6, II a.</page><page sequence="20">20 H. W. AND J. D. S. PENDLEBURY AND M. B. MONEY-COUTTS from Phaistos,1 although smaller and more roughly made, but does not seem to have come from a vessel of quite the same shape as these, since the wall where it is attached is only slightly curved and could hardly form part of a rounded shoulder. The other (T. 39) is very fragmentary, but appears to have been ledge-shaped. Trapeza Ware sherds also occurred on many other parts of the Kastellos, but only in small numbers. From the surface of Test 14 comes a handle (T. 40) exactly similar in shape to the Neolithic handle N 8 from Trapeza. A ridge, horizontally pierced, from Test 12 recalls the pierced ' tress ' T. Io, and has an equally anthropomorphic look (T. 4I). A sherd with irregular incisions (T. 42) from Test 6 seems to suggest that the shallow scorings so often noticed on Trapeza Ware were sometimes deliberately imitated by way of decoration, and perhaps explains the origin of the incisions of T. 37, T. 38, T. 39, and T. 41. Two rim fragments and a wish-bone handle were found, curiously enough, inside the north-west room of the house in Test 9, where almost all the rest of the pottery was MM III. The former (T. 43) have incisions at the top which anticipate the rope-design on the rim of a bowl from the same area (Bowls 3), although this must have been made some thousand years later.2 The latter (T. 44) is to some extent paralleled at Knossos in Neolithic times,3 but is a shape unusual in Crete and suggesting northern influence. Unfortunately it is still impossible to restore any Trapeza Ware vessels with complete certainty, but the conclusions previously reached as to their shapes have not been greatly altered. The only new features are the flat base (T. 34), the handles (T. 38-40 and T. 44), the incision (T. 37-39, T. 41 and T. 42), and the entirely problematical' trays' (T. 36 and T. 37). The date previously assigned to this ware has also been confirmed, since wherever it occurred in any quantity it was always associated with a few dark, burnished, Neolithic sherds, and yet, owing to the almost entire absence of EM I pottery on the Kastellos, must have continued after the beginning of that period. It evidently marks the final stage of the Neolithic culture of Crete which in Lasithi had a longer uninterrupted development than elsewhere.

Only one pot which can certainly be attributed to EM I was found during I937. This is the small tripod vessel from Skaphidhia which has already been mentioned in connection with the dating of the Trapeza Ware from the same deposit. It is of the soft grey fabric which has been discussed at length in the report on the Trapeza Cave,' and although this fabric does not in itself afford conclusive evidence as to its date, its general appearance is so primitive that it seems only reasonable to place it at the beginning of the Minoan Age. Its three small feet are also perhaps an indication of its earliness.2 On the other hand, it was found on the existing floor of the cave, above the thin layer of stalactite which covered most of the earth, and must therefore be later than the other remains from Skaphidhia and quite unconnected with the burials below. Also since Trapeza Ware probably continued in use during the beginning of EM I, it should not belong to the earliest phase of that period. Its closest parallels outside Lasithi are from the Messara,3 where pots of similar type seem to persist later than elsewhere in Crete, and it may be an import from that district. At all events, it seems clear that it must date from the latter half of EM I. On the Kastellos only a handful of sherds were found belonging to this period. They are in the same grey fabric, but are too small for their shape to be certain, although they appear to come from suspension pots or pyxides. A number of rough hand-made fragments may be contemporary, but are not datable with any certainty. If an EM I settlement existed, its remains must have been entirely swept away by later building, but it seems that in Lasithi this period was short and that stylistically its pottery was hardly distinguishable from that which preceded it.

II. 23 shapes represented have already been described in the report on the Trapeza Cave.1 Fragments from open dishes (cf. 3o4-1o) occurred on the terrace and in Tests 7, 8 and I4, that from the last named being carefully polished like 308. One sherd from a dark burnished cover (cf. 4ol-Io) was found in Test 14. Bases and handles from large cups (cf. 501-11) came to light in Tests 3, 4, 6 and 7, and from 4 and 7 there are sherds from strainers similar to 508. No real Vasilike Ware was found, but fragments from jugs in the local imitation of this fabric, which it has already been suggested 2 probably continued in use into EM III, occurred in Tests 4 and 7, and from the latter there is a goblet base in the same ware (cf. 8o9-Io). Sherds from suspension pots in red clay (cf. 121-23) from Tests 3 and 8 may equally belong either to EM II or EM III. No other shapes certainly attributable to the former period were recognised, but all the Early Minoan pottery from the Kastellos was in too poor a condition for such recognition to be easy. EM III. Practically none of the pottery from the neighbourhood of Trapeza or from the Kastellos can certainly be attributed to EM III, although a number of sherds are similar to those from the Trapeza Cave which have been dated to between EM II and MM I. These include rims of bowls in red ware (cf. 126-145) from Tests 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7; one in buff clay with an outer ledge (cf. 146-147) from Test 6; bridge-spouts (cf. 208-11) from Tests 3, 4 and I2; and jug necks with knobs (cf. 624-28) from Tests 4 and 7. It is also probable that some of the cup fragments in fine buff clay with a dark wash which occurred in almost every area excavated belong to this period (cf. 52o) rather than to MM I, but all are too much worn for the quality of any white paint with which they may have been decorated to be apparent.3 MM I. (Fig. I3.) No whole pots of the MM I Period were found either in the neighbour- hood of Trapeza or on the Kastellos. In the former area there appear to have been a few pithos burials of this date, but these must mostly have been destroyed by modern terracing. 20 metres west of the cave, as has already been noted,4 a workman discovered during the autumn of 1936 sherds from a pithos resembling some from that season's excavations (cf. 1 BSA XXXVI, 33 ff. The numbers here quoted refer to the pieces described in this article. 2 Ibid. XXXVI, 71 f. 3 Cf. BSA XXXVI, 58. 4 BSA XXXVI 9o.</page><page sequence="24">24 H. W. AND J. D. S. PENDLEBURY AND M. B. MONEY-COUTTS 920-22), together with other MM I fragments. 70 metres east of the cave the remains of a similar pithos were brought to light during I937, but too little of it was left for restoration. The Meskine Cave, which was tested in 1938, produced fragments from two more pithoi (one similar in fabric to 916, the other more resembling 920), both of which had evidently been used for burials, and a number of other MM I sherds, including the base of a cup in buff ware (cf. 524-35) and the top of a trefoil-mouthed jug (cf. 640). On the terrace 20 metres east of Trapeza part of a finely ridged cup (cf. 536) and a few more fragments of MM I pottery were found, but these may have come from the cave itself, and were unconnected with pithos sherds. On the Kastellos there was evidently a considerable settlement during MM I, but the pottery of this period, although found in large quantities, is in very poor condition, for the site continued in use until MM III, and the earlier remains naturally suffered, even when, as in the case of the house in Test 9, the same building was inhabited without interruption. It was, in fact, found in the greatest bulk in the rubbish-dumps of Tests 4 and 8. A good many coarse fragments must be of this date, but, since the larger the vessel the more impossible to tell its shape from small sherds, these are valueless. Pithos rims, either flat (cf. 902-12) or flaring (cf. 914- 15, 920-21), generally in red but sometimes in coarse buff clay, with rope mouldings (cf. 902-15), ridges (cf. 920-21), or trickles of paint (cf. 916-18), occurred in Tests 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9. In fine ware bowls (cf. 160-62) were represented in Tests 3 and 4, and jugs, sometimes in the peculiar hard light clay previously found in the cave (cf. 629-34 and 636-39), in Tests 4, 5 and 8, but the commonest distinguishable sherds are from cups in either red or buff clay, generally with a dark surface wash (cf. 523-44). These occurred in every test, and were only absent in the lower levels of 4 and I I, where the deposits were almost entirely Neolithic and Sub- Neolithic; all the types noticed from Trapeza were again recognised, and were present in much the same proportion, for whereas only one base- from Test 4-belongs to a pedestalled cup (cf. 523), the majority are from tumblers or from the open, straight-sided shape (cf. 524-35), and a few from the round-bodied and carinated varieties (cf. 539-44). There are also many specimens of ribbed decoration (cf. 536-38) from Tests 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9, which seems to confirm the suggestion already made that this is characteristic of Lasithi. All the sherds are too much worn for polychrome decoration to show, but one-from Test 7-appears to have traces of white paint on the dark wash. It is, of course, impossible to say definitely that none of these cup fragments are later than MM I, for all the shapes seem to have continued until at least the beginning of MM III, and the open, straight-sided type persisted until its close (see Cups Io). The ribbing also remained in fashion, but eventually became more irregular and more</page><page sequence="25">EXCAVATIONS IN THE PLAIN OF LASITHI. II. 25 widely spaced (see Cups 4). Straight striations on the base have been taken as a criterion for early dating,1 but do not afford absolute proof, for the exact similarity in shape between Cups 3 and Io, the former with straight and the latter with concentric striations, and the straight marks on Jugs 2, which has a close MM III parallel from Mallia, suggest that the slow wheel was sometimes used even after the introduction of the fast one. Three cups from outside the walls of the house in Test 9 have been selected for illustration and description (Cups 1-3), partly because they help to prove that this was the date of the founding of the building, but also because they are representative of the Kastellos material in general. They require no special comment. I is paralleled by 525, 2 by 535 and 3 by 529, and the discussion of these examples may be referred to.2 Kastellos. Test 9. Outside W. Wall to S.

(Plate V, 3; Figs. Io, 13, 14.) No pottery comparable to the MM II 'Palace Style' came to light either on the Kastellos or elsewhere. In Lasithi there seems to have been an uninterrupted development between MM I and MM III, although during the latter period certain new types of pottery came in, corresponding rather with those contemporary in other parts of Crete than with earlier local products. It would be misleading to label the present section MM II, when it includes some objects of which it can only be said that they are MM, and others which merely appear to be later than MM I but earlier than MM III. Amongst the former are the tripod legs of which large numbers occurred in every test on the Kastellos, for although, if a continuous development is imagined between the dishes from Trapeza (313, 314) and those from Tests 7 and 9 (Tripods I-4), comparative shortness or length might be 1 BSA XXX 69; P ofMI 589. 2 Ibid. XXXVI 59, 61.</page><page sequence="26">26 H. W. AND J. D. S. PENDLEBURY AND M. B. MONEY-COUTTS taken as a guide for earliness or lateness, such a classification would obviously be absurd. Pithos sherds are equally impossible to date, for, although during MM III the rims are generally heavier, rope moulding continues 1 and the general shape is almost unchanged until LM times. The shallow dish rims (Dishes 1-4) again cannot, in the absence of parallels from other sites, be placed with certainty. They are evidently common types, for similar sherds occurred in other tests. In particular 4 has counterparts from Tests 3, 4 and 8, but all these are too fragmentary for restoration, or even for it to be clear whether they should be classed as dishes or lids. Of the vessels catalogued below which should be later than MM I but are not typical of MM III, all but two (Cups 4 and Jugs 3) are from outside the house in Test 9, and might therefore date from any period during its occupation. The cups are particularly difficult to place. 4 recalls the ribbed examples from Trapeza (536-37), but its ribbing is less regular, and it seems to have been made on the fast wheel, so that it approximates to some extent to I I, which itself has an MM III parallel from Knossos.2 5 has the same profile as 542, but its small lip spout brings it into relation with an unpublished vessel from Mallia,3 and 6, in red ware, has an even closer parallel from the same site which is dated to MM III.J The bases of of 7, 8 and 9 are too much worn for any striations to show, so that even this guide as to their chronology is lost, but it should be noticed that their handles are rounded and set on at the rim, whereas those of MM I are more often ribbon-shaped and join just outside. The small jug I might, from its general appearance, belong to MM I, since it is not unlike 634 from Trapeza, which, by analogy with others from the Kouloura houses at Knossos, has already been dated to that period. On the other hand, its wash is more lustrous than usual, and it greatly resembles in fabric the spouted jar 4, which can hardly be earlier than MM III. The fact that, in spite of being in very friable clay, it was found comparatively intact, also suggests that it is not a relic of the earliest occupation of the house outside which it was found. Jug 2, again, has an almost exact parallel from Mallia,5 which is dated to MM III, but there are straight striations on its base. Fragments of other jugs with similar incisions on the shoulder were found in the same area and also in Tests 7 and 8, so that the type must have been common, and may have continued in use for a considerable time. Jug 3 might be of almost any date; the fact that it is hand-made proves little for so are most of the household vessels of MM III,6 and its low spout and lack of knobs differentiate it from the plain red jugs from Trapeza (624-28). The rather high curve of its shoulder seems at 1 P of MI 587 Fig. 430. 2 Ibid. I 590 Fig. 434- SCM 86ob.

(Plates IV, 4, 5; V, 3; VI; Figs. 8-18.) MM III sherds occurred in all tests on the Kastellos, for evidently this was the last period in which the site was regularly occupied. A representa- tive collection of whole or restorable pots came to light in and around the house in Test 9, a few were found in Tests 7 and 12, and one (Lamp I) was described as having come from the area where Tests 13 and 14 were subsequently made. These vessels give a good idea of the general material. Most of the pottery is coarse, and a great deal of it hand-made, which, unless the shape can be reconstructed, makes it impossible to distinguish sherds of this period from earlier ones. The elongation of types which occurs regularly at this date 1 is, however, a useful chronological guide, and many bases with the sides rising almost vertically, such as those of Jars i and 2 and Spouted Jars 1-3, were found. Fine ware is rare, although there are a certain number of rather thick sherds in well-levigated buff clay resembling that of Bowl I. The only distinguishable painted design is that on Jug 5, and not a single fragment shows any trace of the ' tortoise-shell ripple ' pattern which is so frequent at contemporary sites,2 but all painted sherds have suffered greatly from the effects of the soil. The total lack of the plain open cups with spiral flutings in the interior which elsewhere are almost the commonest products of MM III 3 is also worth noting. Cup 12 certainly resembles these in shape, but is much more carefully made and seems to have had a dark wash. The bowl with a lid (Bowl 2 and 2a) has no exact parallels. Its pierced lugs recall those of EM suspension pots, but the use of lugs for tying on lids evidently persisted for a considerable time, for they occur on a number of MM lids from the Kamarais Cave,4 and also on two small bowls and their lids, one from Mallia and the other from Pseira,5 which are unpublished, but appear to date from MM III or later. The double rim of the present example greatly resembles that of a vessel from Tylissos,6 which, to judge by its decoration, belongs to the transitional MM III-LM I Period. The fact that this bowl, although not its lid, comes from inside the house in Test 9, from a room in which none of the other pottery, with the exception of three Trapeza Ware sherds, could be attributed to anything but MM III, seems to make it clear that it, too, must be of this date. The two rounded bowls (Bowls 3 and 4) again have no counterparts. As has been already pointed out,7 the rope pattern at the rim of the former is a decoration fashionable in Lasithi almost to the present day, and other fragments bearing it were found in Test 4. Sherds with the same type of rim as the latter occurred in Tests 7, 1 Pof MI 571. 2 Ibid., II, 305, 3 Ibid., I, 589. 4 BSA XIX 27 Fig. 6. 5 CM 9152 and 5455- " CM 7257. 7 In connection with 1. 42, p. 20.</page><page sequence="29">EXCAVATIONS IN THE PLAIN OF LASITHI.

Both these appear to belong to MM III rather than to MM I, but it is just possible that the one from Test 7 (Bowl 4) should be connected with the Archaic deposit there, and not classed as Minoan at all. ri FIG. 9.-SPOUTED BOWL. Scale, I : 4- The spouted bowl from Test 12 (Spouted Bowl I) is unusual in having side handles but a lip-spout. With a bridge-spout the shape begins in EM III,1 and is common throughout MM I, but at that period occurs mostly in fine ware, and is generally decorated with paint, and not with moulding. The position of the moulding below the handles on this vessel 1 2 3 4- 5 Ib FT FIG. IO.-DISHES. Scale, I :4. is similar to that of the moulding on Bowl 3, and this fact, together with its coarse fabric, make it most probably assignable to MM III. Of the dishes, 5 is the most interesting. It resembles a common form of stone bowl which persisted from MM I to LM I, and of which there was an example from the same area in Test 9 (Stone 39). Its horned handles 1 Cf. 208 from Trapeza, BSA XXXVI 44-</page><page sequence="31">EXCAVATIONS IN THE PLAIN OF LASITHI. II. 31 are evidently derived from those of these stone vessels, and its dark fabric shows it to be a conscious imitation of them. Unlike Stone 39, it has, however, a slightly offset base, which seems to be a late feature, and there- fore, although this may have been made in MM I, it seems that it must itself be dated to MM III. The fact that, although easily breakable, a great deal of it was recovered, whereas most of the MM I pottery from the same test consisted of isolated sherds only, argues that it belongs to the latest period of habitation there. The two dishes with horizontal handles (Dishes 6 and 7) are easier to place, for the larger has an exact parallel from the House of the Sacrificed Oxen at Knossos,' which is clearly dated to MM IIIb, and the two are too similar in everything but size to be separated. Sherds from another of these dishes were found in Test 12. I71 13 2 34 FIG. I I.-TRIPODS. Scale, I : 4 Tripod dishes with lustrous paint on their interior are the commonest individual type found on the Kastellos. As well as the more or less complete specimens (Tripods 1-4), sherds from others occurred in Tests 7, 8, 9, 12, I3, I4, 15 and I6. Unfortunately no legs or handles could be fitted to the otherwise restorable examples. The legs seem in general to have been long in comparison with the diameters of the dishes, and the handles usually looped like those attributed to i and 2, but there are several stick-handles which appear to come from similar vessels. They do not seem to have been used as lamps, since they never show any trace of burning. They are paralleled in shape, but not in decoration, by tripods in red ware from Palaikastro,2 and from Gournia,3 which may well be as late as LM I, but considering how little LM pottery was found on the Kastellos, and that none of it was from Test 9, where the majority of these tripods were brought to light, it seems reasonable to assign them to MM III. The decorated legs (Tripods 5 and 6) have no parallels outside Lasithi, but the second of them is very similar to certain legs subsequently found on Karphi, and it 1 P of M II 304 Fig. 176 F. 2 BSA IX 324 Fig. 24, 2. a Gournia 30 P1.

MONEY-COUTTS is possible that it should really be assigned to the post-Minoan Intermediate Period,' although it is more probable that, like most of the Kastellos material, it belongs to MM III, and is merely an instance of the duration of local types. The spouted lamps (Lamps I and 2) have MM I prototypes,2 but these lack the conical bases of the present examples and are less well formed. The type continues into LM I, but on the later specimens the rim is generally il 2 13 4- ,5 W. FIG. 12.-LAMPS.

The rim of 2, which was found in Test 9, and therefore likely to belong to MM III, is turned up more than that of I, and this may argue that it is the later of the two, but both should fall within the same period.

They resemble many stone and a few clay specimens from other sites,1 and are of a shape which seems not to occur before MM III, but certainly continues into LM I. It is likely, from their weight and their surface polish, that the present examples are meant to imitate stone, and 4, with its extraordinary thickness and dark colour, is remarkably like a dish or lamp in serpentine from Mallia.2 The lamp or brazier 7 with an irregular rim and a stick handle, belongs to a well-known type which appears in MM III,3 continues in use throughout L, /2 13 14 K5 00'y f, 0o ;11 12 FIG.

The present specimen may, indeed, be contemporary with these last, for it resembles them even in the detail of the incised lines round the rim; on the other hand, it may, like the tripod leg 6, only furnish evidence of the way in which common shapes persist. Only three comparatively whole cups (Cups I0-12) can be assigned to MM III, and the first of these probably belongs to the beginning of the period, since it differs from the MM I cups only in respect of the concentric striations on its base, and the fast wheel was in use at Knossos by MM II.5 1 BSA IX T27; Gournia _o P1.

The ' Khamaizi pot' (Jug 4) is one of the most interesting objects from the Kastellos. The class of vessel to which it belongs has already been discussed at length and shown to be attributable in general to MM I.4 The present example is, however, both larger and finer in fabric than is usual, and the ridging in its interior shows that it was made on a fast wheel. The uneven height of its collar, which almost has the effect of a spout, is also an uncommon feature. It was found in Test 9 inside a pithos which, although possessing MM II connections, is probably to be dated to MM III, and it is difficult to see how it can be earlier than this.

II. 35 only be explained by the fact that in Lasithi pottery types appear to have persisted longer than in other parts of Crete. The jugs with cut-away spouts (Jugs 5-7) are again in the direct line of descent from EM vessels, but they have MM III parallels,1 and are of a shape which, with minor modifications, was in use throughout Minoan times. It is unfortunate that the pattern on 5 does not show more clearly, but it seems to have consisted merely of connecting spirals round the shoulder.2 These three jugs were all made on the fast wheel, and fragments from others similar occurred in Tests 7, 9 and 12. 1 2 2 /2 FIG. 15.--JARS.

Fragments from many similar jars, some inscribed, were found in Test 9, and there are a few from Test 7.

These last generally have bridge- spouts and no inner ledge, and thus resemble LM I clay vessels from Palaikastro.2 Of the present examples 3 was found inside the house in Test 9 and is similar in fabric to the dish 6, while the lustrous paint on 5 is like that on the tripods 1-4, so that there seems to be no doubt that they belong to MM III. Sherds from pithoi occurred in all tests, but the only one which could be restored is from Test 9 (Pithos i). This finds its closest parallel in the painted pithos from the early magazines at Phaistos,3 which can be dated to MM II. It is therefore the only vessel from the Kastellos which stylistically might be attributed to this period, but considering that although broken it was sufficiently complete to suggest that it had been used during 1 2 3 4 FIG. 18.-MISCELLANEOUS. Scale, I :4. the last occupation of the house by which it stood and which undoubtedly contained MM IIIb pottery and that it is markedly different from the MM I pithoi of Trapeza, it seems safest to regard it as MM III; on the other hand, it must not be forgotten that the ' Khamaizi pot' (Jug 4) was found inside it, and it may have survived from at least the very beginning of the period. Six or more other pithoi are represented from the same test (Pithoi 2-7), but are too fragmentary for their exact shape to be determined. Their rims are, however, equally unlike those from Trapeza, and all are presumably also MM III. The clay objects grouped as Miscellaneous are all enigmatic. The 'fire-box ' is, indeed, a perfectly well-known type both in Crete and Melos,4 but its use has never been satisfactorily explained. The present example was evidently meant to stand with its collar projecting downwards, since its bowl has a flat, unpierced base, but its counterparts from elsewhere have always been regarded the other way up. It is also finer than usual in fabric, and shows no traces of burning. The 'base' (Miscellaneous 2) is quite inexplicable. It bears some resemblance to one end of the object 1 It goes back to an EM II type (AJA XIII 279 Fig. 2, 3), and occurs in MM I (Gournia 38 P1.

The 'spit-stand' (Miscellaneous 4) has parallels from Palaikastro and Phylakope,2 and a complete example from the former site shows the type to have consisted of a flat rectangular base, about 40 x 30 cms., with the two longest sides turned up at right angles for some Io cms. and finished at the rims by a series of notches. Its purpose is less clear, for neither it nor any of its counterparts in the Candia Museum show any signs of burning, and it is difficult to see how anything could have been satisfactorily turned on a spit the edges of which projected so little. The sherd (Miscellaneous 5) is included here because it shows a new type of rope decoration. It is quite uncertain to what shape of pot it belonged, and its date is equally doubtful. Sherds were found from no fewer than six inscribed vessels (Inscriptions 1-6), two of which could be restored (Jars 1-2), and also a number of small, thick fragments with rough scorings, apparently on the inner side, which may have formed part of inscriptions, but of which only two (Inscriptions 7 and 8) were considered large enough to be worth preserving. All but one of the former are from Test 9, but the latter occurred in Tests I, 4, 7, 13 and 15. Five of the inscribed vessels bear one sign only, resembling a A upside down, but on the sixth this sign seems to have been followed by other writing. The single sign is one already recognised as belonging to Linear Script A; 3 and unless it can be equated with the ordinary A mark it has no hieroglyphic prototype, and should not therefore be earlier than MM III.4 It is unlikely that it should be so equated, since, as well as being placed the opposite way up, the crossing of its downward strokes seems to be deliberate, and this is never the case with the A. It does not appear to be very common in Crete, although found on a clay label from Knossos, the handle of a jar from Phaistos 5 and a rim from Mallia,6 but in Melos there are several examples of it on coarse domestic vessels.' On the Kastellos it was found only on jars of the type of Jars I and 2. It is always placed near the rim, either next to one of the handles or half-way between the two, and was evidently inscribed while the clay was wet, by the potter rather than by the eventual owner of the jar. Its meaning is quite unknown. It may denote the name of the potter, although in this case it is a strange coincidence that it should occur both in Lasithi and in Melos; it may describe the contents of the jar, but, if so, would more probably have been 1 P ofM II 308 Fig. I79. 2 BSA IX 327; Phylakopi 262 fig. 189 3 P ofM I 642 Fig. 476 sign 71. 4 In P of M I (p. 642 Fig. 476 sign 71 and p. 640 n. 2).

It is more finely incised than usual, and may have been scratched on after baking, but the sandy clay of this particular jar makes this almost impossible to determine. At all events, these inscriptions prove that the art of writing had penetrated to Lasithi, even if in some respects it lagged behind the great Minoan centres. Kastellos. Test 9. Inside N.W. Room.

IV, 4).-Heavy tripod leg in plain red ware with a raised band down it, alternately pinched up and flattened so as to resemble a rope. Part of the inner surface of the vessel to which this leg belonged remains, and does not seem to have any slip or paint, so that it must come from a vessel of different type from 1-4. Test 8. o-o50o. Tripod 6 (P1. IV, 4).-Heavy tripod leg in plain red ware with a deep circular depression at the top near where it joined the base of the vessel, and two grooves, one on either side of this, running down nearly its full length. Test 14. Surface (bought). Lamp I (P1. VI, 2, Fig. 12).--Lamp in black gritty clay with a finer slip which has been slightly polished. The base is pedestalled, but fairly low. The sides curve in sharply at the rim. At the back there is a heavy, round handle, and opposite to this a trough spout. The fabric is so dark that marks of burning could not show. The lower part of the handle is restored. Test 9. Outside N. Wall. Lamp 2 (P1. VI, 2, Fig. I2).--Lamp in coarse brownish clay with a thin, smoother slip. The shape resembles that of I, but the rim does not curve in so sharply. The interior is blackened all over, as though from burning. Test 9. Outside N. Wall. Lamp 3 (P1. VI, 2, Fig. I2).-Pedestalled lamp in coarse brownish clay, with a thick finer slip and traces of lustrous black paint, most of which has now worn off. The wall is very thick throughout. The foot is high and hollow, with the inner surface left rough above. The top is shaped like a shallow bowl, with a double rim, forming a groove near the edge, but with two gaps in the inner pro- jection, for the wick. The base and top were probably made separately, since, when found, they had split apart. The top is much blackened, as though from burning. Test 9. Outside N. Wall. Lamp 4 (P1. VI, 2, Fig. I2).-Tall, hollow foot, probably from lamp similar to 3, which it resembles in fabric. The surface of the top is not slipped or glazed, but is fairly smooth and flat (the edges are only slightly broken), so that the bowl of the lamp to which it belonged cannot have been very securely</page><page sequence="42">42 H. W. AND J. D. S. PENDLEBURY AND M. B. MONEY-COUTTS attached. There is some blackening down one side, as though from an overflow of burning oil. Test I2. o-o08o. Lamp 5 (Fig. I2).-Part of tall, hollow base, probably from lamp similar to 3, which it resembles in fabric, but with the beginning of a handle near the top. This handle may have curved round to join the bowl of the lamp, or else have been merely a stick-like projection. The side is blackened, as though from burning. The base is less symmetrical than that of 3 or 4, and the foot is missing, so that the height is uncertain. Test 13. o-I'30. Lamp 6 (Fig. I 2).-Heavy rim of dark grey clay with a thick slip and traces of black paint similar to that of 3. The rim is simple, but from its blackening and the resemblance of its fabric to that of 3-5 seems to be from a lamp. Test 8. 0-0-50. Lamp 7 (P1. VI, 2).-Part of lamp in coarse reddish clay blackened in the centre, as though by burning. There is a stick handle at the side, and the rim is pushed in towards the centre of the vessel at the point where this is attached. On the inside of the rim are six incised lines. Test 9. Outside N. Wall. Cup Io (P1. V, 3, Fig. I3).--Cup of similar shape and fabric to Cup 7, but with concentric striations on the base. Handle partly restored. Test 9. Outside N. Wall. Cup i i (Fig. 13).-Base with part of side and handle of cup in fine pinkish-buff clay, showing traces of a reddish, semi-lustrous wash on both inner and outer surfaces. There are no distinguishable striations on the base, but the ridging of the sides suggests that the vessel was made on a fast wheel. The handle seems to have been ribbon-shaped. Test 9. Outside N. Wall. Cup 12 (P1. V, 3, Fig. I3).-Shallow, handleless cup in fine buff clay with traces of a dark wash on both inner and outer surfaces. Concentric striations on the base. Test 9. Outside N. Wall. Jug 4 (found inside Pithos i) (P1. V, 3, Fig. I4).-Small jug in fine light clay with the surface slightly polished and a decoration of cross-hatched incision round the neck. The neck is collar-shaped, but not quite horizontal at the rim, being highest opposite to the handle, which consists of a small, horizontally pierced lug, and thus almost giving the impression of a spout. The knob and the very distinct fine ridging inside the vessel show that this was made on a fast wheel, although all striations on the base have been obliterated by polishing. Test 9. Outside N. Wall. Jug 5 (P1. V, 3, Fig. I4).-Jug with cut-away spout in sandy, reddish clay, with a thin worn slip. There are traces of a dark wash on the outer surface and extending inside the neck, on which there seems once to have been some spiral decoration in white paint. Concentric striations on the base. Test 9. Outside N. Wall. Jug 6 (Fig. 14).-Base and and part of neck and shoulder with handle of jug in sandy, orange clay without slip or decoration. The shape is similar to that of 5, but the vessel is smaller. There are no striations on the base, but distinct ridging on the inner surface of the body suggests that the vessel was made on a fast wheel. The end of the spout is missing, and the base and shoulder do not quite join, although certainly belonging to the same vessel. Test 9. Outside N. Wall. Jug 7 (Fig. 14).-Spout, handle and part of side of jug in fine greyish-buff clay, with a dark wash on the outer surface and extending inside the neck. The wall is thin, and shows distinct ridging both inside and out, due to the use of a fast wheel. The base is missing, and the lower part of the side does not quite join the shoulder, so that the shape is uncertain. Test 9. Outside N. Wall. Jar I (P1. VI, 3, Fig. 15).-Tall jar in rather coarse, light red clay without slip or decoration. There is a slight groove below the rim and vertical handles, high up, at either side. Immediately to the left of one of these handles is a sign, incised before baking, resembling aA upside down (see Inscription I). Test 9. Outside N. Wall. Jar 2 (P1. VI, 3, Fig. I5).-Top of jar of similar fabric and shape to I, but with a smoother surface and smaller. The handles are horizontal, and between them there is the same incised sign as on I (see Inscription 2).</page><page sequence="43">EXCAVATIONS IN THE PLAIN OF LASITHI. II. 43 Test 9. Outside N. Wall. Jar 3 (P1. IV, 2).-Neck ofamphora in gritty reddish clay with a thin, lighter-coloured slip. On the shoulder and round the rim there are wide lines in matt brownish paint. The neck is pinched in laterally where the handles were attached, but the handles themselves have now split off. None of the body remains. Test 9. Outside N. Wall. Spouted Jar I (P1. VI, 3, Fig. I6).-Jar in coarse, dark red clay, with a thin, much-worn slip. The rim is pulled out to form a spout, opposite to which there is a round, vertical handle high up on the vessel. Hand-made. The top of the handle is restored. Test 9. N.W. Room. Spouted Jar 2 (Fig. i 6).-Top of jar in coarse reddish clay with- out slip or decoration. The rim is slightly pulled out to form a spout, and there are horizontal handles high up at either side. Hand-made. The base has been restored. Test 9. Outside N. Wall. Spouted Jar 3 (P1. VI, 3, Fig. I 6).-Bucket-shaped jar in fine, rather flaky, dark buff clay, greyish at the core. The outer surface seems to have been slightly polished. The rim has a groove below it outside and a narrow ledge inside, except at one point, where there is a trough spout. At either side there are horizontal handles, but one of these had split off and is now restored in plaster. From the ridging inside the body, this vessel appears to have been made on a fairly fast wheel. Test 9. N. Wall. Spouted Jar 4 (no illustration).-Base and part of rim of jar similar in shape to 3, but in paler clay, which is so flaky that it has split like slate at the breaks. There are traces of dark lustrous paint on the surface. Distinct ridging inside suggests the use of a fast wheel. Test 9. N.W. Room. Spouted Jar 5 (P1. VI, 3, Fig. 16).-Jar resembling 3 in shape, but larger, and in coarse orange-buff clay without slip or polish. As well as horizontal handles at the sides, there is another, smaller and lower down, opposite to the spout. Hand-made. Test 9. Outside N. Wall. Spouted Jar 6 (P1. IV, 4).-Fragment from jar in coarse red clay with the rim turning in sharply at rather less than a right angle to the side, and pulled up at one point to form a spout, at the side of which there is a small knob. Too little remains to tell the exact size or shape of the vessel, but it appears to be wheel- made. Test 9. Outside N. Wall. Pithos I (P1. VI, 4, Fig. I7).-Pithos in coarse orange-red clay with a lighter slip, which has mostly worn off. When this vessel first appeared, a trickle design in matt dark red paint could be made out on the shoulder, but this is now hardly discernible. There are four vertical handles immediately below the rim and four more above the base. Test 9. N.W. Room. Pithos 2 (Fig. I7).-Rim of pithos of similar fabric to I. Diameter c. 33 cms. Test 9. N.W.

Pithos 7 (Fig. I7).-Rim of pithos in similar clay to I, but apparently without slip. Test 9. Outside N. Wall. Miscellaneous I (P1. IV, 4, Fig. I8).--Small "fire-box" in red ware without slip or decoration. This consists of a globular bowl with a flat base and a long, projecting collar turned out and down. The end of the collar is missing, but it must have reached to about the level of the base. Concentric striations on the base and spiral ridging inside show that this vessel was made on a fast wheel. Test 9. Outside W. Wall. Miscellaneous 2 (Fig. I8).--Three sherds from a circular vessel in coarse clay without slip or decoration. There is a hole in what appears to</page><page sequence="44">44 H. W. AND J. D. S. PENDLEBURY AND M. B. MONEY-COUTTS be the base in the making of which two lumps of clay have been pushed up inside, opposite to one another. Outside there is the beginning of a handle flush with the base, and on the base itself opposite to this two projections close together, which bear rough incisions. Hand-made. Test 9. Outside W. Wall. Miscellaneous 3 (P1. IV, 4, Fig. I8).--Fragment in coarse clay, smoother on the outer surface than within, perhaps from the top of ajar, with a square shoulder and a rim overhanging inside. If this is the case, the side turns in at right angles to a flat top, on which there is a projecting ring, possibly to keep a lid in place, and beyond this turns down again to the rim. The sherd might equally well be regarded, the other way up, as some kind of base with a central hole. Test 8. o-o0o5. Miscellaneous 4 (P1. IV, 4, Fig. I8).--Two fragments of " spit-stands " in coarse clay without slip or decoration. These consist of flat slabs of clay, the upper edges of which are grooved by being pressed down at intervals. The height and breadth are uncertain, since neither example is complete. Test 2. Below stone pavement. Miscellaneous 5 (P1. IV, 2).-Sherd in rather coarse clay, grey on the outer surface, but red within, and decorated with an elaborate moulded design. Too little remains to tell the size or shape of pot to which this belonged. Test 9. Outside N. Wall. Inscription I (Fig. 15).-Inscribed sign consisting of a triangle standing on its apex with the diagonal lines crossing one another below (see Jar I). Test 9. N.W. Room. Inscription 2 (Fig. I5).--Inscribed sign similar to I (see Jar 2). Test 9. Outside N. Wall. Inscription 3 (P1.

The inside of the triangle has in this case split out. Next to this to the right there is another sign, which is incomplete. The jar on which these occur is of the same shape as Jars I and 2, but in thinner ware. Test 9. Outside N. Wall. Inscription 7 (P1.

LM I-LM III Very little LM pottery was found during the season of 1937, and most of this is too incomplete for it to be certain to which subdivision of the period it belongs. From the north side of the Kastellos (Tests 2 and 3) there are a handful of sherds, from stirrup vases and goblets, which are later than MM III, but which may be of any date between that and the end of the Minoan Age. Nothing which can be definitely assigned to LM I came to light, and the Palace Style of LM II is certainly unrepresented. LM III. (Plate IV, 3; Fig. I9.) On the Terrace 20 metres east of the Trapeza Cave the remains of a larnax burial were found, but these were very near to the surface, and the</page><page sequence="45">EXCAVATIONS IN THE PLAIN OF LASITHI. II. 45 pottery is consequently broken and incomplete. The most important vessel represented is that described as Bowl 5. This appears to have parallels from Gournia 1 and Palaikastro,2 and in shape must have closely resembled a LM IIIa 'barrel pithos' from the latter site.3 Unfortunately too little remains for its decoration to be properly made out, but this seems to have been in the panelled LM IIIa style, which is perhaps best illustrated by two alabastra with bird designs from Phaistos.4 With these connections both for shape and pattern there can at least be little doubt that it belongs to LM IIIa. The other pottery from this deposit includes sherds from two or more stirrup vases, a stemmed goblet, an open dish and several small cups, but all these are too fragmentary for any sort of reconstruction. The r, FIG. 19.-STIRRUP VASE. Scale, I: 4* larnax itself was evidently of the usual chest type,5 standing on four feet, and possessing a gabled lid; its corners are, however, more rounded than is common. On the Terrace 20o metres west of Trapeza the workman who unearthed the MM I sherds already referred to also came on a stirrup vase during the winter of 1936-37. This (Stirrup Vase I) is of the squat shape characteristic of LM IIIb. It may have come from another interment, but of this no traces could be found. Terrace 20 ms. E. of Trapeza (larnax burial). Bowl 5 (no illustration).-Sherds from large, square-shouldered bowl or pyxis in rather coarse but well-baked buff clay with finer slip outside. The sides come up almost at a right angle to the base. The body is cylifidrical. At the shoulder the sides turn in sharply, and then up to form a low collar neck, over which a lid could fit. There are two horizontal handles at the angle of the shoulder, concave from without and with circular depressions at either end where they join the vessel. The decoration is in dark lustrous paint, and is arranged in panels, consisting partly of a series of wavy horizontal lines between straight vertical ones, and partly of some more elaborate design. Too little remains to tell either height or diameter. 1 Gournia 46 P1. X 5 and 40. 2 BSA Supp. I 94 Fig. 79. 3 Ibid. Supp. I, ioo P1. XXIII c. 4 P of M IV 337 Fig. 280. 5 BSA Supp. I 152, ibid.

There are two handles only, one at either side of the false neck. No air-hole is apparent, but the vessel is restored, and not all the sherds were recovered. Archaic. A certain amount of pottery from Test 7 on the Kastellos belongs to the Archaic Greek period. This consists mainly of sherds from pithoi, in plain red ware, with the rims turned out and down, so as to overhang the sides. Similar pithoi were subsequently found at Donadhes, and since those from the Kastellos have no connection with the main occupation of the site, they will be treated in a future article, together with the rest of the Archaic material from the district. F. Metal. (Plate III, 3.) Two tools of bronze were found, and one was bought. The provenance of all three is the Kastellos. The scraper (No. 14) was found on the floor of the west room of the house in Test 7 (G. 20). The deposit was mixed, but the object in question clearly belongs to the main period of habitation, MM III. It is very thin, and the bottom ridge is worn irregularly to one side by use. Whether the rounded point at the top was fitted into a handle or was merely gripped by the finger is uncertain; probably the latter is the case, since there are no traces of rivets or rivet holes. The curved knife (No. 24) was found in the unstratified dump, Test 8 (F. G. i5). The latest possible date to which it could be assigned is the transitional MM IIIb-LM Ia period, but it almost certainly belongs to MM I or MM III proper-probably the latter, which formed the pre- dominating part of the deposit. I know of no similar tool in any way comparable at this date. The nearest approach are the curved knives from Vrokastro of Intermediate Period date.' The double axe (No. 376) was bought. It was said to come from a terrace half-way down the west slope. It might be MM I or MM III; the type varies little in these two periods, but the fact that the blade flares slightly at each end inclines one to assign it to the later period.2 It is 1 Vrokastro P1.

The strata in which they were found were usually mixed, the limits, however, being MM I-MM III. Even where, as in the case of the lids 27, 28, 33 and 34, the deposit was comparatively pure MM III, the facts that habitation was continuous and that objects of hard stone continue in use for many generations after they are made preclude us from dating these finds with certainty to MM III. Dating therefore must be on stylistic grounds. It may, however, be said at once that no vase of the Early Minoan Period was found. Several vases gave a strong impression of belonging to MM I, owing to the stone of which they were made, their small size and their resemblance to MM I vases from other sites.1 26 is a small 'bird's-nest' vase. The profile is the same as that of a vase from Mokhlos in breccia, and it resembles also one from Platanos and one from Gournia in the same material.2 Knobbed lids of the type of 27, 33, 34 and 48 go with this class of bowl, but continue in use in MM III. The very small lid of alabaster, 28, probably covered an alabaster jar of Egyptian shape such as that found at Porti, and there dated to MM I.3 The handle, 12, comes from a cup of MM I type.4 The open bowls 18 and 39 find their nearest parallels at this date,5 though such vessels continue to be made in MM III, and 51, which was found in a pure deposit of that date, may be a case in point.6 The rest may be dated with some degree of certainty to MM III.

Vessels with straight and slightly concave sides are known in MM I.2 The bases 19, 38, 41 and 50, however, cannot be dissociated from the nearly complete specimen 40 and 43, with 42 as a lid. This is almost exactly paralleled by a clay vase from the same house, whose date is clear (see above, page 36, Spouted Jar 3).a The elongation of shape is typical of MM III. B. Tools. Parts of two stone axe-heads were found. No. 2 is of very hard, smooth, green serpentine, the lower end and part of a fine edge alone surviving. Its context was chiefly Middle Minoan, and may be another example of the way in which such tools continued in use for centuries after their manufacture.4 No. 129, however, was found in the late Neolithic grave in Test 4. Both are of the short type, which continues in use during EM I.5 The objects 3 (with 4), 5, 6 and 52 are probably hones or whetstones. 3 is remarkably thin, and the end is rounded off almost to a cutting edge. 5 and 6 taper to the end, and are square cut. Since in all three cases the context ranged from EM to MM III, it is impossible to date them closely, though the scantiness of the EM deposit makes one lean to the MM Period. 52, however, was found in a comparatively pure MM III stratum. The surviving end is triangular and pierced. No parallel to 3 is known. 5 and 6 have many parallels in the Messara which seem to range from EM II to MM I in date.6 52, with its pierced triangular end, resembles an object from the MM I-II house at Kalathiana.7 This is described as an amulet by Xanthoudides, but is almost certainly a hone with a hole for suspension. In the days of bronze anyone who was constantly using his knife must frequently have needed a sharpener.8 1 BSA XXVIII I5I. 2 VTM P1. XXXIX 1033 10o62; Mochlos Fig. 32 XX 3; Trapeza BSA XXXVI 112.

This must date at earliest from the transitional MM IIIb-LM Ia Period. Our example is almost certainly MM III. Fragments of obsidian blades came from several tests and from strata ranging from Sub-Neolithic to MM III.

II. 53 pottery was EM III-MM I. The surviving fragment consists of the fore- part of the animal only, the head and the lower part of the legs being missing. Though solid, it resembles most closely the MM I bull rhyton from in front of' Tholos' B at Koumasa.' It should almost certainly be attributed to the same date. No. 23 also has close parallels from the same site and from Tylissos.2 The latter parallel is not more accurately dated than to MM by the discoverer, but the former seem to have been fairly clearly of MM I date, which the mixed deposit of Test 8 by no means denies to the present object. Neither of the figurines has any trace of decoration, though the paint, if there was such, may well have worn off in the course of time, and with the action of the soil. Test 3.

The beads were all, fortunately, found well stratified. 13 is clearly of MM III date, though it is of a shape which occurs as early as EM II,3 and is found as late as LM III, as is shown by 53. Exact parallels in shape material and date to I were found in the tombs at Liliana.4 Like the flattened cylinder, 54, the globular shape is peculiar to no particular date. 53 54 EI !r FIG. 22.--BEADS.

In LH III the numbers decreased considerably, and their place was taken by the smaller and neater cones and truncated cones of steatite resembling our 13 and 53 above.' The clay examples, however, seem far too clumsy for buttons, and the single hole does not lend itself to attachment to a garment. It is extremely doubtful also whether one can regard the steatite cones as buttons, for the same ZT,45 Tb37 T37 wmww T) 20 Tj10 Tj22 FIG. 23.-LOOM-WEIGHTS, ETC.

The globular whorl, No. 37, is almost certainly of MM III date, and resembles one from Gournia.2 Both the weights seem to be safely stratified to MM III. They may be compared with other Middle Minoan weights from Koumasa,3 Khamaizi, Mallia, Sklavokampos and Palaikastro 4 and of course the MM IIb examples from the Loom-weight Area at Knossos.5 The conch shell found in Test 9 may be compared with the contemporary example from a presumed shrine at Knossos.6 A.
