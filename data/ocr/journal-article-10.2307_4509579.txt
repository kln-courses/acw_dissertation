<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bird-Banding 142] Recent Literature July for the identification of birds east of the Rockies and indispensable to all bird students in this region. 62. The Junior Book of Birds.-Roger T. Peterson. 1939. Boston. Hough- ton. 92 pp. $2.00. Mr. Peterson has a happy gift of writing interestingly and sympathetically for children, with no hint of condescending juvenile twang, nature faking nor sentimentality. Twenty-three species from the Loon to the Towhee are treated in lively, stimulating fashion with border sketches that are utterly fascinating. The color plates, however, are not up to the high standard of Mr. Peterson's writings and pictures; they show the effects of a long and useful life. 63. Nature Photography Around the Year.-Percy A. Morris. 1938. New York. Appleton-Century. 251 pp. $4.00. This book, written for "the great army of nature lovers who have had little or no experience with a camera", and "the experienced photographer who has had little training in natural history", should serve its purpose well. After an introductory chapter on photography (which the reviewer wishes had been longer), the year is taken up month by month with descriptions of the natural objects suitable to photograph and methods for so doing. The range of interest and information is amazing-clouds, butterflies, mushrooms, baby birds, snails, flowers, mammals, snakes, etc. Illustrations are given with notations on exposure and other details. There is an index and a bibliography which might well have been extended. This fascinating book will open new fields to those of us who tend to specialize in our nature interests. 64. Birds.-Gayle Pickwell. 1939. New York. McGraw-Hill Book Co. Qto. 252 pp. $3.50. Dr. Pickwell of Horned Lark fame gives us here an enter- taining popular account of "bird homes and home life, bird foods and feeding habits, bird travels, and bird feathers", illustrated with a wealth of photographs and with information drawn from New York, Illinois, Nebraska and California. He tells us: "Birds cannot be labeled 'good' or 'bad' because they do, or do not, eat insects. . . . Like a bird because it is a bird, a creature of sheer fascination. . . . Birds are sufficient in themselves. They are their own reward." In an interesting chapter on "How birds are Protected from their Enemies", the author leans heavily on Thayer and believes that white patches are "distractive" to enemies, rather than "directive" to members of the species. Lorenz' theory of releasers is not mentioned. His treatment of injury feigning is sane. There are instructive chapters on the "Kinds of Birds," giving the character- istics of each order and many families. The accounts of territory in the Horned Lark and of the home life of theAmerican Pipit on Mt. Rainier are full of interest. The Cowbird chapter is disappointing. "Cowbirds, male and female, usually have but one mate, and establish regular territories like other birds, as Dr. Friedmann has shown." He reiterates the ten day incubation myth. Apparently he is not acquainted with recent studies on this species by Dr. Hann and the reviewer. Under "Further aids in Knowing Birds" a short bibliography is given, but no mention is made of the bird societies nor bird magazines. To sum up, the book has many admirable qualities, but it is a pity that before publishing such an ambitious, handsomely got up volume, the author should not have acquainted himself thoroughly with the current literature. 65. Wildfowling with a Camera.-Lorene Squire. 1938. Philadelphia. Lippincott. Qto. 217 pp. and 100 plates. $7.50. A gorgeous book with breath- taking pictures of ducks and geese, Willets and Dowitchers. Difficulties and dis- couragements are inherent in Miss Squire's wildfowling. "If, out of forty nega- tives, there is one that can be made into a print that expresses something of the beauty and motion and fascinating pattern of wild duck flight I am entirely satisfied." In vivid, intimate words she describes her subjects-the ducks that come to the Kansas slough in the fall, the flocks of shorebirds "busily intent on their feeding", the majestic flight of wild geese, the baby Canvasbacks, "bright jonquil yellow, marked with brown", eagerly pattering after their mother in northern Canada. Few of the photographs are sharp. The effect is often like an</page><page sequence="2">Vol. x Rent Literature [143 1939 Rcn ieaue[4 etching, and the pictures bring the feeling and mystery of the marshes. A splendid hook for a gift. 66. Animal Neighbors of the Countryside.-Joseph W. Lippincott. Phila- delphia. Lippincott. 272 pp. $2.50. This is a pleasant book about the lives of many of the common vertebrates. Besides the interesting facts and amusing stories about life histories, the charming illustrations by Lynn Bogue Hunt should ensure its wide circulation among younger readers.-Constance Nice. 67. The Watcher at the Nest. Margaret Morse Nice. 1939. New York. Macmillan. 154 pp. $2.00-A generation or two ago Bradford Torrey, Frank Bolles and a dozen others found a public and a market for simple and sincere account of the lives and surroundings of obscure birds and mammals. It has been a long time since such volumes have been able to make their way without being atro- ciously nature-faked or reduced to the sickening accents of pseudo-juvenility. In the meanwhile a great deal of increasingly turgid water has flowed under the bridges of these quiet streams. The naive delight in the revelation of the minor secrets of nature has been replaced by the consuming ambition to bring it all under the formulas of the latest psychological fad. While Torrey wrote for a quiet audience of rural naturalists in still-Victorian New England, Mrs. Nice's every word must pass under the horn-rims of a thousand graduates of Junior Colleges, whose memories of their biology course are a trifle vague but for an aggressive conviction that it's all easily susceptible to a mechanistic explana- tion and that, above all, you mustn't be sentimental or, (luscious verbal plum !) anthropomorphic. Can Mrs. Nice get away with it? If so, she is doing, if not a worthier, at least a more difficult, thing than all the worthies did half a century ago, and, she acquires merit in proportion. Whether in the first half-dozen essays, which are retellings of the epic of the Song Sparrows, and in which the author bodies forth in "real life" the whole range of modern bird psychology, or in the later numbers,-earlier memories which must depend in greater degree on sheer description and the charm of the simple and enthusiastic style, the book is good work, whether as zoology or as literature. If it fails, the reasons will be social, because the literary type is dead, not because the exponent is not a master. It is as foreign to the nature of the author as it is to the character of her material to represent birds as anything else than purposeful individuals adapting them- selves to circumstances. The pattern Mrs. Nice has advocated so long and played so large a part in building up is shot with increasing degrees of flexibility and variation as the intimacy and continuity of the account increases. Sometimes the reviewer wishes more accent were layed on the flexibility, less on the pattern. The rose-hedge imbroglio came at a time when song was in abeyance, but it called for song, and Uno and 4 M could and did use it copiously. When Una was moved to violate the territorial code unsupported by Uno, she took over many of his functions, then, her object gained, fell back into her prescribed role. Uno transformed his behavior in response to the vagaries of three successive wives in matters as basic as feeding or not feeding the young. Dandelion adapted herself perfectly to changeling young born a week ahead. The pattern has become as rigid as an india-rubber band. If anyone is laboring under the manic-depressive conviction (perhaps specific in reviewers) that all the dullness in the world is finding its way into the ornitho- logical magazines, this is the best medicine that has been distilled these many years.-T. T. McC. 68. A Gathering of Birds.-Donald Culross Peattie. April, 1939, pp. i-xii+ 379. Illustrated by Edward Shenton, New York, Dodd, Mead and Co. $3.00. For this anthology of ornithological prose, Mr. Peattie has selected extracts from the writings of nineteen naturalists who have written on the subject of birds from 1753 to the present day. The first selections are from the pen of William Henry Hudson, the last gleaned from John James Audubon; in between and in the order named, come John Muir, Gilbert White, Cherry Kearton, Gustav</page></plain_text>
