[IAGO] The prince of darkness is a gentleman. [EDGAR] In his magisterial work, Infinity and Perspective, Karsten Harriesjoins other eminent scholars of early modernity in trying to define the distinguishing characteristic separating the modern from the premodern. He finds the turning point in the changed self-understanding that established a pas- sionate interest in perspective. Commenting on Copernicus, Harries ex- plains, "Reflection on the nature of perspective will teach us that whatever presents itself to the eye, to perception, is no more than subjective ap- pearance. To get to 'actuality' or objective reality, we have to reflect on per- spectival appearance. Reality cannot, in principle, be seen as it is. Reality, as it is, is invisible. Such distrust of the eye is one of the defining charac- teristics of the emerging modern understanding of reality."' This "distrust of the eye" was both literal (in terms of the senses) and conceptual (in terms of reason). Perspective or one's particular under- standing was grounded in what one was able to know. As Harries ob- served, Nicholas of Cusa's thought revealed that "our experience of the world is limited by what happens to be our point of view and we should not assume that such a point of view gives us access to the way things re- ally are."' Harries demonstrates that the theological counterpart of this in- terest in perspective was speculation about the infinity of God. However, a further look at the sixteenth century reveals that along with an interest in infinity, the emerging modern self-understanding had yet another im- portant counterpart; namely, the concern with the disjunction between appearance and reality and the consequent search for the real.

We see a growing suspicion that there was no identity or even correspondence between appearance and reality or between being and seeming. Consequently, one could easily be deceived. This preoccupation with appearances and reality was, I would argue, characteristic of an age haunted by uncertainty. The question of certainty often reveals a dark and troubling side of sixteenth-century thought. The craving for certitude that haunted the early modern era reflects such problematic issues as the adjudicating of experiential claims, the role of authority, and the detect- ing of the demonic. Despite claims to Scripture, authority, tradition, the Spirit, experience, or reason, this era continually struggled to find an an- chor in the midst of constant vertiginous change. These uncertainties came to be expressed in the problematic rela- tionship between appearances and reality. In the following, I am try- ing to describe an ethos in which this preoccupation and uneasiness was played out in various ways. I have chosen Luther, Montaigne, and Shakespeare because they represent a wide spectrum of dates, contexts, and styles extending from the early sixteenth to the early seventeenth century. As such, they illustrate the way in which the fear of not know- ing things as they really are permeated this age. They reveal how this fear came to be expressed in different genres and experienced by dif- ferent audiences. We see in these very disparate thinkers a set of com- mon concerns about the problem of appearances and reality that, in turn, issued in different resolutions. With Montaigne we will find a sense of melancholy as well as humility as he learned to reconcile him- self with living only amidst appearances. We will also find with Mon- taigne a radical redefinition of reality itself. With Luther and Shake- speare we encounter more than a sense of melancholy and humility; we will discover a sense of tragedy regarding the fate of humanity living in the midst of illusion. Luther's writings offer a myriad of themes revolving around the problem of deceptive appearances. Since his thought is saturated with the idea of hiddenness and the noetic effect of sin, the problem of delusion is in- evitable. However, in terms of the disparity between appearances and reality, the best starting point is Luther's intense concern both with the demonic and with idolatry. For Luther, the underside of certainty was the fear of deception in matters concerning truth and salvation. Luther's thinking was a classic example of how strident claims to certainty were fraught with a thoroughgoing concern with deception. This anxiety in- 346</page><page sequence="3">Appearances and Reality creased as various groups challenged Luther's reform.3 Catholic oppo- nents, the emergence of the radicals, and the biblical debates about the sacraments forced the question of deception to the forefront of Luther's thought. Even before his fellow reformers started calling him the "paper Pope," Catholics challenged his "exegetical optimism" by asking, 'Are you alone wise?"'4 As Eck wrote, "If the whole Scripture is so completely clear, it is a wonder that the Holy Fathers who read it so frequently did not un- derstand it for 1200 years, that if it was obscure to Augustine, Jerome, Bernard, and Thomas, how will it be clear to Lutheran laymen?"'5 Thomas More could not get enough of this insult and wrote repeatedly, "But God, has of course, opened to your seeking ... for you are accustomed to boast that you have your teaching from heaven; spiritual man that you are ... If you argue that God is indicating to you at the present time so many, such useful, such necessary truths, why should you think that He concealed all these truths for such a long time from such holy men to the great detri- ment of His whole church? ... If the church has not existed during this whole time among these people who obey the pope and have so long obeyed him, tell me where has it been these past five hundred years be- fore you were born?"6 After learning the hard way that Luther could be a very difficult man, Carlstadt echoed this taunt by saying, "Therefore it is either Doctor Luther who falls short of the truth or else Moses, the prophets, the apostles and Christ know nothing of the main articles of Christian teaching."7 In these biting questions, the issues of certainty and authority were clearly linked. To defend his own teaching Luther had to account for the errors and deceptions of his opponents. An increasingly prominent ex- planation was that his enemies were diabolically inspired.

This question haunted Luther his entire life, as is clear from his self-identification with Noah in his 1535 commentary on Genesis. Just as he, Luther, was assailed by the question, "Do you think that all the fathers were in error?" so, too, Noah faced the question, "Is it you alone who is wise? ... Are all the rest in error? ... Is it you alone who is not in error? Is it you alone who will not be condemned?" 6 Thomas More, Responsio ad Lutherum, trans.

Luther's de- monology exactly paralleled his pneumatology. Just as the Holy Spirit was the agent of certitude, Satan was the agent of deception. The intensity of his preoccupation with the ability to discern between truth and deception is seen in his ardent fascination with the way Satan operated as the "father of lies." This fascination, in turn, led to a profound awareness of the prob- lematic relationship between appearances and reality.8 To explain the method of Satan's deception, Luther tapped into a cen- turies-long teaching on the nature of evil. He assumed the ancient insight that evil comes disguised as the good. The noble, sincere, religious, and pious appearance of evil gave the devil his seductive power to deceive. This tradition is evident in various places throughout the Christian tradi- tion. The literature of the desert Fathers describes how the devil often ap- peared to the saints as Christ.9 In the early twelfth-century Glossa ordinaria we find the statement that "one may discern what he hears, whether he is addressed by a good spirit or an evil spirit since the devil speaks good in order to seduce."'1 Saint Bernard warned that it was not easy to discern be- tween the Spirit and evil spirits. It was necessary, he said, to "battle against serpents, sirens, obdurate hearts, spirits of the flesh and of the world, spir- its of evil and the ever-popular angel of Satan disguised as an angel of light."" And Gerson began his famous treatise on discerning the spirits (1401) with the admonition that Satan comes transformed as an angel of light.'2 Furthermore, apocalyptic literature expressed this insight. As Bernard McGinn has shown, Satan's impersonation of Christ dominated ' The following discussion about the hiddenness of Satan is explored much further in my essay, "Unmasking the Angel of Light: Luther and Teresa on Demonic Deception'," in Mys- tics: Presence and 'Aporia," ed.

Indeed the an- gel of Satan according to the Apostle sometimes transforms himself into an angel of light." "On Distinguishing True from False Revelations," in Jean Gerson, Early Works, trans.

The biblical inspiration was often 2 Thess: 2:9-12, which reads: "The coming of the lawless one by the activ- ity of Satan will be with all power and with pretended signs and wonders, and with all wicked deception for those about to perish.... God sends upon them a strong delusion to make them believe what is false." Luther was deeply affected by this biblical belief that evil mimics the good. He culled a series of verses to elaborate on this theme, including 2 Cor. 4:4 ("The god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel,") and Gal. 3:1 ("Who has bewitched you so that you do not obey the truth?"). But no verse capti- vated Luther more than 2 Cor. 11:14: "For even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light." In this latter verse Luther found the perfect explana- tion for the effectiveness of Satan. According to Luther, Satan "puts on a most beautiful appearance," when he "captivates," "bewitches," and "be- guiles" the mind. Satan "dazzles" through "lovely thoughts and words" and gives the convincing appearance of wisdom and goodness. The devil is the "master of dissimulation, disguise, and pretense."" Luther exploited this insight by arguing that Satan's effectiveness de- pended upon hiddenness. Scholars have long recognized the centrality of divine hiddenness in Luther's theology.'5 But for Luther an equally im- portant counterpart to the hiddenness of God was the hiddenness of Sa- tan. By transforming himself into an angel of light, the devil was like God in hiding "under a contrary" appearance. Thus Satan comes hidden un- der the appearance of holiness, truth, zeal, and faith. Satan can even ap- pear as Christ himself. "The devil," Luther said, "so clothes and adorns himself with Christ's name and works and can pose and act in such a way that one could swear a thousand oaths that it is truly Christ himself, al- though in reality it is the Archenemy and the true Archantichrist."'6 This Archenemy could quote Scripture "under the name and guise of Christ."

This "white devil" counseled people to trust the church of the apostles and the holy Fathers.'8 Luther insisted that "the devil always adorns himself with such an angelic, yes, such a divine form and appear- ance." The devil always "appears in the disguise of an angel of light and adorns his murdering with the beautiful trappings that are called piety and the worship of God."' The devil, Luther concluded, "insinuates him- self into our hearts, not as one who is evil and false but as one who is good and the best, as an angel of light."20 Luther was keenly aware that the sin involved in deception was not pri- marily an act of will but was, rather, a noetic fall. He argued that although his opponents honestly believed that the Spirit inspired them, they were, in reality, inspired by the devil. The Catholics and the "false brethren" did not simply refuse to understand: they were unable to understand. In the Gospel of John, Luther found evidence that Christ had foretold that the world would not be able to understand because it did not have the "Spirit of Truth." The "multitude" was incapable of recognizing the truth be- cause, Luther explained, they were "under a spell," in a "satanic illusion," in a "dream," subject to the "bewitchment of the spirit," and suffering from "spiritual blindness or madness."2' Luther believed that humanity was locked into a world of satanic deception that seemed all too real. The "bewitchment of the spirit" even extended to an experientially real but delusional certitude. According to Luther, "the ancient serpent" was now creating a "spiritual witchcraft" in the Anabaptists and Sacramentarians: "With his tricks, [Satan] has so bewitched their minds that they are em- bracing lies, errors, and horrible darkness as the most certain truth and the clearest light. . . . [The Devil] works internally, with plausible opinions and ideas about doctrine, by which, as I have said, he so dements the hearts of all men that they would swear that their most vain and wicked dreams are the most certain truth."'2 In Luther's view the devil created a world that is the mirror image of truth. The hiddenness of God and the hiddenness of Satan are locked into a deadly contest between the real and the counterfeit. The individual is immersed in an illusion that seemed more real than the truth. In Luther's frequent use of 2 Cor. 11:14, the world became a nightmare of mimicry, 7 WA 45.503.2-11, 45.577.8-9; LW 24:46, 127. '8 WA 40/1.10-11; WA 40/1.130.2-131.9; LW 26:41, 65.

Evil paro- died the good so authentically that all claims to certitude fell into a de- monic perceptual chaos. To make matters worse, Luther depicted the par- adoxical nature of God and Satan as they appeared under the hiddenness of their contraries. Both God and Satan wore masks. The following pas- sage dramatically illustrates that when the hiddenness of God confronted the hiddenness of Satan, the world became a tragic shadow play where the line between appearance and reality, certitude and deception, bewitch- ment and sight, truth and lies, threatened to disappear: God's faithfulness and truth always must first become a great lie before it becomes truth. The world calls this truth heresy. And we, too, are constantly tempted to be- lieve that God would abandon us and not keep his Word; and in our hearts he be- gins to become a liar. In short, God cannot be God unless he first becomes a devil. ... We cannot become God's children until we first become children of the devil. All that God speaks and does, the devil has to speak and do first. ... There- fore it is actually the Spirit who enlightens and teaches us in the Word to believe differently. By the same token the lies of this world cannot become lies without first having become truth. The godless do not go to hell without first having gone to heaven. They do not become the devil's children until they have first been the chil- dren of God. To summarize, the devil does not become and is not a devil without having first been God. He does not become an angel of darkness unless he has first been an angel of light (2 Cor. 11:4). For what the devil speaks and does must first have been said and done by God.... I also know the devil's word must first be- come the delicate truth of God before it can become a lie. I must grant the devil his hour of godliness and ascribe the satanic to our God.23 Luther delighted in this paradoxical description of reality and of one's relationship to God. As a result he had to lay great stress on the "testing of the spirits." This "testing" alone could lead to the real. Luther's teaching ofjustification by faith succeeded in taking the burden of salvation off the back of the individual believer. However, because of the subsequent crisis of authority, Luther left the believer with the heavy responsibility of dis- cerning truth from falsehood, appearance from reality, and God from the demonic angel of light. Not surprisingly, 1 John 4:1 ("Beloved, do not be- lieve every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are of God,") took on an urgency in Luther's thought. He continually warned, "We must be on our guard against the devil who can pose and masquerade in the form and name of Christ."24 The faithful had to unmask Satan of his angelic garb and reveal him as the devil. To "test the spirits" was to plunge the be- liever into the battlefield between the Spirit of Truth and the Father of 2" WA 31.249.25-250.10; LW 14:31-32. 24 WA 46.13.7-10; LW 24:312. In the same passage Luther wrote, "Therefore, we must pull off their mask and point out the true nature of the Gospel, Baptism, and the ministry.... The 351</page><page sequence="8">The Journal of Religion Lies. This testing required a depth of spiritual experience and perception that could safely distinguish between these two opponents and thereby safely choose salvation over damnation. Moreover, Luther knew that the devil did not make this testing easy. Luther's concern with the deceptive nature of appearances extended to his interest in Satan's other method for "beguiling" humanity; namely, Satan's creation of idolatry. The problem of the illusory nature of ap- pearances recurred in Luther's intense concern with humanity's love of the idolatrous. His Old Testament commentaries, particularly his massive commentary on Genesis, were the primary places where he ex- tensively discussed this subject. Commenting on Genesis 1-3, Luther identified the essential consequence of the fall with the fall into idola- try."5 Abandoning God's word, Adam and Eve plunged the human race into an idolatrous world. Luther's main interest in this section is not the bondage of the will but the blindness of human perception. This perceptual blindness was exemplified in the inability to perceive the idolatrous character of this newly fallen world. Analyzing the serpent's temptation, Luther made a remark that is crucial but easily overlooked. Luther explained that after Adam and Eve were drawn away from God's word, "a new god is invented for men by Satan without their even being aware of it."26 This total lack of awareness was the most definitive mark of idolatry. Luther went on to say that after the fall into idolatry humanity was deprived of all discernment and alljudgment of the spirit so that hu- mans are now "unable to distinguish the true God and the idolatrous god." Having created a "new god," Satan and humanity go on to produce an idolatrous world around this false divinity. Biblical passages that spoke of the ancients as "molding" or "shaping" or "making" and "carv- ing" their idols led Luther to passionate warnings about the unknow- ingly self-constructed nature of the idolatrous world, a world that was now all-encompassing. devil always adorns himself with such an angelic, yes, such a divine form and appear- ance,just as he makes a god of himself when he speaks to Christ in Matt. 4:9. Here Christ must contend, not against man but against a god-not against the true God but against the devil, who uses God's name and adorns himself with divinity." Luther is employing a traditional theme but with his own originality. For a discussion of the illusions of the demonic, see Stuart Clark, Thinking with Demons: The Idea of Witchcraft in Early Modern Eu- rope (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), pp. 80-93. Clark writes of a "demonic in- version" that inverted values and turned particular things "upside down." Luther, on the other hand, spoke more often of an exact imitation. See also the 1583 version of Jo- hann Weyer in Witches, Devils, and Doctors in the Renaissance: Johann Weyer, "De praestigiis dae- monum," trans. John Shea (Binghamton, N.Y: Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Stud- ies, 1991). 25 WA 42.110; LW 1:145, 149. 26 WA 42.112; LW 1:112. 352</page><page sequence="9">Appearances and Reality That which captivated Luther's imagination was the insidiously seduc- tive nature of idolatry. He understood that idolatry was both intensely ra- tional and intensely religious. As a rational system, idolatry conforms to the way in which fallen reason regards the self and the world. This makes the idolatrous universe self-enclosed, completely coherent, and totally un- recognizable. The individual never feels any need to go beyond this un- real world because idolatry answers every human question. As Luther fre- quently explained, the fall caused the human being to be "curved in on the self." The world of idolatry now totally mirrors this fallen self and fulfills every human need. In fact, the fallen world is like living in a house of mirrors. Consequently, we are totally oblivious to the unreality of this world. Moreover, the universal human need for religion is amply satisfied by idolatry. Luther recognized that no one ever thought he was committing idolatry; no one sets out to worship idols. This is why the devil must always come as an "angel of light" with words of piety and religious zeal. But the idol conforms so completely to the need of the self that the mind cannot see the falsity and deception in which it is now involved. Luther further expanded on this concept when he explained that by conforming God to the self we make God "smaller" than he really is. Just as the ancient idol- ater "carved" or "shaped" his idol, so, too, we shape and "whittle down" a god into a form we can understand." In Luther's view, we make God smaller because we "whittle down" his mercy to his justice. This smaller God is one that can be "appeased." In the idolatrous world, the ethical rule of good works rules the imagination. The fallen mind creates an idol out of the Law and believes that a just God demands and rewards one's obedience to that law. This "legal" form of religion suits the human need for a god "small" enough to conform to the need of reason to appease an angry God.28 We create an angry judge because the infinite expanse of God's mercy is too great or "large" for us to comprehend. In short, we con- form God to our limited sense of sin, justice, appeasement, and satisfac- tion. Just as Luther never underestimated the cunningness of Satan, so, too, he never minimized the religious power of idolatry. The intensely re- ligious nature of idolatry showed Luther once again that, like all of Satan's works, idolatry came under the appearance of the good.2" Because of its holy and devout character, idolatry was able to deceive and to convince humanity of its full reality and truth. In his discussions on idolatry Luther reiterated his conviction that Sa- tan's effectiveness depended on his ability to mask himself with the name 27 WA 31/2.27-304, 345-50; LW 17:17-25, 107-12. 28 WA 31/2.278-79; LW 17:22-25. 29 WA 42.111-12, 119-21; LW 1:148-49, 158-60. 353</page><page sequence="10">The Journal of Religion of God. Thus idolatry always imitated true worship. Therefore Luther ar- gued that the Nimrodic idolatry began with God sending fire down from heaven to consume the sacrificial animals. The Chaldeans corrupted these sacrifices into idolatry and began to worship light or fire in itself. Accord- ing to Luther this is how the devil always works: "For wherever Christ builds a temple and gathers a church, Satan invariably has the habit of im- itating him like an ape and inventing idolatrous forms of worship and idol- atrous traditions similar to the true doctrine and the true forms of wor- ship .... For it is the devil's rule to build a chapel next to a church and temple of Christ, that is, to appropriate the works and examples of the fa- thers, disfigure them, and turn them into a work that is performed with- out regard to faith."30 For Luther even worship is a mask behind which Satan hides himself. Employing an ancient German proverb, Luther explained that the devil had to "sow his seed" among the good seed (Matt. 13:25) so that "wher- ever God builds a church, Satan builds a chapel . .. next to it.""' This comparison suited Luther's purposes perfectly because it explained that idolatry always looks like the real image it imitates. The devil, Luther explained, "always wants to be in the midst of the children of God" be- cause these are the people he most needs to deceive.32 In order to do so, he must come as the true religion and make the false worship seem real. In doing so, idolatry meets the religious needs of the fallen world by creating a spiritual "blind delusion" that cannot be seen as false. In his exegesis of the Abraham and Noah stories, Luther stressed how the contemporaries of both men were unable to see the idolatry of their religion. Only those whom God called "out of idolatry" were able to be- lieve that the religion of their homeland, which appeared "dazzling and magnificent" were able to "acknowledge" the falseness of their former faith.33 In short, the devil hides most thoroughly in fulfilling the spiri- tual needs of humanity. Here appearance and reality become radically indistinguishable. Luther was always fascinated with just how real idolatry seemed to be.34 The human being is now locked into a fully coherent world that is totally 30 WA 43.305.37-39; LW4:237. "3 WA 32.474.36-37; LW 21:212. 32 WA 32.474.38; LW 21:212. 31 WA 42.436.1-442.19; LW 2:245-53. ~" Luther was aware that the idolatry of his time was not as "crude" as that which the Old Testament narratives described. His contemporaries did not use wood or other materials to craft a physical idol. Nonetheless, he argued, the human condition was always the same. As in all his commentaries, Luther collapsed time so that the message was immediately appli- cable to the present. Hence he noted, "Although we do not have the same kind of idolatry, since the material of the heathen's idolatry is not the same as ours, yet the rise and attitude of both kinds of idolatry is the same" (WA 31/2.278; LW 17:22-23). 354</page><page sequence="11">Appearances and Reality self-contained. This world is one of false appearances and is ultimately un- real but cannot be destroyed by human effort because it cannot be seen. Idolatry cannot be recognized. Furthermore, appearances do not just conceal or mask reality; they are satanic and have a malignant force in obstructing access to the real. Appearances "bewitch" or "deceive" the mind so that the sinner never senses the nonsubstantiality of his world. To pierce through the deceptiveness of idolatry requires the acknowledg- ment of the full nature of human sin, evil, illusion, and blindness. But this is impossible from within the perspective of idolatry. Only the divine can destroy Satan's delusions. Without God's intervention in faith, the impris- oning power of delusion will only continue its powerful and captivating grip on the soul. To escape idolatry a higher perspective is needed. That perspective came from the cross. For Luther, only the God who "comes under a contrary" could break the iron grip idolatry and Satan now have on hu- manity. The irrational, seemingly small, contradictory, and crucified God alone can break through the appearance of the seemingly real. Only the God who seems weak by hanging on the cross is powerful enough to break Satan's spell. Luther's well-known teaching that God comes under a con- trary corresponded exactly to his view of idolatry. God's revelation sets vis- ibility in opposition to truth. Luther argued that fallen reason is always in alliance with the visible, the evident, and that which was seemingly just. Only the perspective granted from faith in the cross can open our eyes to idolatry. Without the horror of the cross, idolatry continues to define the world. Faith, which is a gift from God, crashes through the delusions of idolatry, inverts the fallen but rational order, and sets appearances in op- position to reality. Only life lived in this kind of "opposition" allows one to escape and transcend the illusory world of idolatry or appearances."5 Because Luther so focused on the power of deceptive appearances, he also emphasized the new perceptual dimension of faith. The healing of the will and the ethical dimensions of Christianity were never Luther's pri- mary concern. His main interest was in the new perspective granted by faith. Because of the tension between the real and the nonreal, faith places the believer outside the realm of the rational, the ordinary, and the visible. Faith, therefore, is a supremely alienating experience. Luther was very adept at describing the loneliness and, at times, nightmare-like qualities of the life now lived by the believer. The believer no longer belongs to the delusory world around him. Abraham and Noah best illustrated this alien- ating character of faith. Unlike his neighbors Abraham was able to rec- ognize the idolatry surrounding him "for idolatry is recognized only " WA 31/2.282-83; LW 17:29-30. 355</page><page sequence="12">The Journal of Religion through the Word of God."36 Luther notes carefully that Abraham's ins- tant obedience in leaving Babylon was praiseworthy because Abraham believed the condemnation of his traditional religion. Such belief sent him into exile."7 Noah also experienced such alienation. "In the sight of his age," Luther wrote, "Noah was treated and regarded as a stupid and worthless person." The world, Luther continued, "appeared to itself most holy and most righteous; it assumed that it had adequate reasons for per- secuting Noah, especially so far as the First Table and the worship of God were concerned."38 Luther took great pains to show that Noah alone had the perception of faith that allowed him to believe God and thereby to rec- ognize idolatry and to see reality differently. Several biblical passages en- abled Luther to describe this new perspective. One of the most important of these verses was 1 Cor. 2:15 ("The spiritual man judges all things,"), which meant that the faithful could finally judge the world and see things as they really were.3" The locus classicus describing the new perception of faith was Gal. 4:6 ("And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts crying 'Abba Father!"'). On the basis of this verse Luther repeatedly spoke about the higher perception of faith. When God sends the Spirit into the hearts of believers: This happens without a visible form; namely, when through the spoken Word we receive fire and light, by which we are made new and different, and by which a new judgment, new sensations, and new drives arise in us. This change and new judg- ment are not the work of human reason or power; they are the gift and accom- plishment of the Holy Spirit, who comes with the preached Word, purifies our hearts by faith, and produces spiritual motivation in us. Therefore, there is the greatest possible difference between us and the enemies and perverters of the Word. We, by the grace of God, are able to declare and judge with certainty, on the basis of the Word, about the will of God toward us, about all laws and doctrines, about our own lives and those of others. On the other hand, the papists and the fanatical spirits are unable to judge with certainty about anything.40 Above all else, the perception of faith allows the believer to recognize idolatry. The believer alone can see God as a merciful "Father" rather than an angry judge. Only the perception of faith can cry "Abba Father!" For Luther, this ability to see God as merciful breaks through the "bewitch- ment" of idolatry. To see God differently is to see all of reality differently. 36 WA 42.440.14; LW 2:250. 37 WA 42.440.15-441.1-34; LW 2:250-53. 38 WA 42.299-325; LW 2:63-88.

To obtain this new perspective or perception into reality required a spiritual wrenching of the soul as it passed through despair to faith. But once the soul has placed its trust in Christ, the newly granted perception of faith frees the believer from the illusion of the false appearances in- spired by Satan. All of this, however, is God's work in the soul. Once God places the believer outside the world of idolatry the deceptive power of ap- pearances loses its hold. God enables the believer to see reality from a higher perspective. By the late sixteenth century the discrepancy between appearances and reality had become an even more urgent issue. In Montaigne we see the development of this theme in the hands of a late Renaissance humanist and skeptic. As did Luther, Montaigne spoke often about the insubstantial character of human life. Our world, he said, is nothing but "wind," "smoke," "vanity," a "dream," a "mask," and an "illusion." In Montaigne's view we live in a world of"Cimmerian darkness.""4' In this darkness we live in a state of constant deception that looks like truth. Montaigne argued that "truth and falsehood are alike in face, similar in bearing, taste, and movement; we look upon them with the same eye." Furthermore, we en- joy this deception. Montaigne wrote, "I find not only that we are lax in de- fending ourselves against deception but that we seek and hasten to run ourselves through on it. We love to embroil ourselves in vanity, as some- thing in conformity with our being."4" Our existence is permeated by the unreal and the uncertain. In these descriptions of human life Montaigne was not saying anything new. But as he explored the relationship between appearances and reality, Montaigne became more radical. In one of his most important and subversive of arguments, Montaigne concluded by ac- tually redefining the nature of the real. Victoria Kahn's keen observation that "Montaigne can be read as a kind of secularization of Luther" may be even more profound that her astute analysis demonstrates."3 Operating without Luther's religious framework, Montaigne, too, depicted our world as created by the falsity of the human mind. His attack on this falsity was based in large part on book 1.124-26 " The Complete Works of Montaigne, trans. Donald M.

On the basis of Sextus Em- piricus, Montaigne attacked all forms of essentialism. These arguments were aimed at demonstrating that humans never see the world or its ob- jects independently of the self. He thereby challenged any claim to know the objective nature or essence of external reality. Basic to Montaigne's idea of perception was that the soul conformed all things to itself." Hence, Montaigne asked, "Do objects really possess the qualities we attribute to them?" If not, he said, "what conclusions can we reach about their true essence?" He answered that we can "no longer claim to know that any- thing truly is: nothing reaches us except as altered and falsified by our senses."45 Moreover, it is more than our sense faculties that render us in- capable of the knowledge of essences. Illness, health, age, and our natural humors all block our attempts to attain objective and stable knowledge of the nature of any being. The properties and appearances that we perceive are only "impressions." But these impressions and the corresponding objects are two different things. Consequently, "whoever judges from ap- pearances judges by something other from the object."46 Thus Montaigne argued throughout the Apology, "Now, since our condition accommodates things to itself and transforms them according to itself, we no longer know what things are in truth; for nothing comes to us except falsified and al- tered by our senses. When the compass, the square, and the ruler are off, all the proportions drawn from them, all the buildings erected by their measure, are also necessarily imperfect and defective. The uncertainty of our senses makes everything they produce uncertain."7 In his early essay, "On Democritus and Heraclitus," Montaigne explained, the soul "treats a matter not according to itself but according to herself." Things "in them- selves," he continued, "may have their own weights and measures and qualities but once inside, within us, she allots them their qualities as she sees fit.'"9 In this same essay, Montaigne applied this principle to the ex- perience of death that was "frightful to Cicero, desirable to Cato, a matter " The Complete Works of Montaigne, p. 220. 5 Ibid., p. 454. 46 Ibid. 4 Ibid. Montaigne goes on to compare his argument about the senses to the religious de- bates of his time, repeating, in essence, Thomas More's and John Eck's attacks on Luther: "Furthermore, who shall be fit to judge these differences? As we say in disputes about re- ligion that we need ajudge not attached to either party, free from preference and passion, which is impossible among Christians, so it is in this. For if he is old, he cannot judge the sense perception of old age, being himself a party in this dispute; if he is young, likewise; healthy, likewise; likewise sick, asleep, or awake. We would need someone exempt from all these qualities, so that with an unprejudiced judgment he might judge of these proposi- tions as of things indifferent to him; and by that score we would need a judge that never was" (p. 454). 48 Ibid., p. 220. 358</page><page sequence="15">Appearances and Reality of indifference to Socrates." He went on to say that the conscience, au- thority, knowledge, wealth, beauty, and their opposites were "all stripped on entry and receive from the soul new clothing, and the coloring she chooses-brown, green, bright, dark, bitter, sweet, deep, superficial- and which each individual soul chooses; for they have not agreed together on their styles, rules, and forms; each one is queen in her realm."49 Montaigne was well aware that he was undercutting traditional guar- antees about the reliability of cognition. Nonetheless, Montaigne was do- ing more than gleefully demolishing the traditional foundations of hu- man knowledge. He was portraying the mind as something that could not break free from itself. Throughout his attacks on the certainty of knowl- edge, Montaigne depicted a claustrophobic world where we can never get out of our own skull. By making perception active instead of passive,"5 Montaigne made human perception and ideas nothing more than the reflections of our own reasoning and imagination. According to Mon- taigne, the mind could achieve only a kind of "seeming" that presupposed that we perceive reality in accordance with our own being. However, such "seeming," had to forgo certainty. Montaigne argued that "seeming is so uncertain and controversial, it is no longer a miracle if we are told that we can admit that snow appears white to us but that we cannot be responsible for proving that it is so of its own essence and in truth; and, with this start- ing point shaken, all the knowledge in the world goes by the board.""' Montaigne's anti-essentialism was aimed at a denial that humanity had any knowledge of absolutes. The Essays repeatedly attacked any form of finality, whether it was the definitive reading of texts, the con- clusive knowledge of virtues, or the exclusive knowledge of God. When "digging down" into a piece of writing there was no interpretation or meaning that the human mind could not find. Any book is subject to "thousands of different interpretations and points of view, and indeed, as many as we please.""' Trying to find the true meaning of a text was like trying to grab liquid that could not be solidified. Hence Montaigne likened the interpretation of laws to children grabbing hold of quicksil- ver: "The more they press it and knead it and try to constrain it to their will, the more they provoke the independence of this spirited metal; it escapes their skill and keeps dividing and scattering little particles be- 49 Ibid.

These statements confirm Kahn's argument that "Montaigne implicitly acknowledges the metaleptical nature of interpretation when he dis- misses the possibility of arriving at a proper or fixed meaning, at the truth of any author's text" (Kahn, p. 147). 359</page><page sequence="16">The Journal of Religion yond all reckoning.""5 The result of interpretation, whether it is of Homer, the Bible, or Luther himself, was nothing but "uncertainty and quarrels."" Moreover, all attempts to know and express the truth had to be ex- pressed in the "airy medium of words.""55 Language, however, was arti- ficial, nonsubstantial, a purely human construct; language consisted of mere signs with no essential relationship to its referent. We only think we have hold of solid reality by means of language because we confuse the name with the thing.56 The "airy medium of words" again demonstrates Montaigne's preoccupation with the human tendency to live in a purely verbal construct that it mistakes for the real or absolute. This "airy medium" stood in opposition to the constant human desire for the solid, firm, formed, and substantial nature of truth and reality. Philosophy and the commonplace method of arguing from "both sides of the ques- tion," led to imagining that human constructs such as essences and "Truths" were objective and knowable by the human mind. "Our disputes," Montaigne insisted, "are purely verbal.""' Hence Montaigne continually warned against the incessant proclivity by the mind to create a totally ver- bal universe-and then to assume that universe was reality. This proclivity was most evident, according to Montaigne, in the human presumption to know God. The same fundamental principle that under- cut the "objective" or "essential" knowledge of external beings also thwarted all attempts to know the divine. Just as we conform the external thing (or the written text) to the self so, too, we create a god mirroring our- selves. Instead of our senses, it is our reason, imagination, or soul that fashions a god according to the self. All of our anthropomorphic and an- thropocentric assumptions about God and the universe only confirmed for Montaigne the imprisonment of human beings within their own " The Complete Works of Montaigne, p. 816. 4 Ibid., "This is the same; for by subdividing these subtleties they teach men to increase their doubts; they start us extending and diversifying the difficulties, they lengthen them, they scatter them. By sowing questions and cutting them up, they make the world fructify and teem with uncertainty and quarrels.... It is more of a job to interpret the interpreta- tions than to interpret the things, and there are more books about books than about any other subject: we do nothing but write glosses about each other. The world is swarming with commentaries; of authors there is a great scarcity. . . . I have observed in Germany that Luther has left as many divisions and altercations over the uncertainty of his opinions, and more, as he raised about the Holy Scripture" (pp. 816-18). 5 Ibid., p. 274. 56 Ibid., p. 468: "There is the name and the thing.

We thus live in a verbal construct that we mistake for reality. Along with essences, we fabricate gods, philosophies, religions, axioms, and beliefs, all of which are only products of our minds and the "airy medium of words." Not surprisingly, Montaigne likened human thought to the tower of Babel.59 For Montaigne, as for Luther, only self-knowledge could dismantle this seemingly real construction. However, the essential difference between Luther and Montaigne regarding the difference between appearance and reality is encapsulated by Montaigne's remark that "we are not so full of evil as of inanity."60 For Montaigne neither Satan nor human evil con- structed this illusory world. The culprit was presumption, which Mon- taigne defined as the unnatural desire to escape the limits of humanity. He insisted that "to make the handful bigger than the hand, the armful big- ger than the arm, and to hope to straddle more than the reach of our legs, is impossible and unnatural. Nor can man raise himself above himself and humanity; for he can see only with his own eyes and seize only with his own grasp. He will rise, if God by exception lends him a hand."'' Mon- taigne never denied that such rare exceptions existed. Nonetheless, he re- "5 Ibid., pp. 396-97: "It must be noted that to every creature there is nothing dearer and more estimable than its own being; the lion, the eagle, the dolphin, prize nothing above their own species; and each relates the qualities of all other things to its own qualities. Which in- deed we can extend or shorten, but that is all; for beyond this relation and this principle our imagination cannot go; it can divine nothing different and it is impossible for it to go outside of this and pass beyond it. ... For why shall a gosling not say 'all the parts of the universe have me in view; the earth serves for me to walk on; the sun to give me light, the stars to breathe their influences into me"' (p. 397).

They want to get out of themselves and escape from man. That is madness; instead of changing into angels, they change into beasts; instead of raising themselves, they lower themselves. These transcendental humors frighten me, like lofty and inaccessible places; and nothing is so hard for me to stom- ach in the life of Socrates as his ecstasies and possessions by his daemon. . . .

Montaigne's interest was always in that person addressed in the Apology; namely, "man alone, without outside assistance.'"' In fact, he deeply distrusted claims to transcendence saying, "These transcendent humors frighten me."63 He wanted the human being to climb back down, as Socrates did, and accept the limited life of humanity."6 Even his beloved Socrates was subject to a rare criticism because of his supposed ecstasies. As Montaigne said, "nothing is so hard for me to stomach in the life of Socrates as his ecstasies and possessions by his daemon."65 To "know one- self" as instructed by the Delphic oracle was not to see oneself from the di- vine perspective or to know transcendent truths but only to look inward at the ever-changing nature and inanity of the self: "Do you not see that this world keeps its sight all concentrated inward and its eyes open to con- template itself? .. .'Except for you, O man,' said that god, 'each thing studies itself first and, according to its needs, has limits to its labors and desires. There is not a single thing as empty and needy as you, who em- brace the universe; you are the investigator without knowledge, the mag- istrate without jurisdiction, and all in all, the fool of the farce."'66 To know the self was to know oneself as fully and only human and to live within the limits humanity dictates." Nonetheless, human beings insist on straining toward the eternal, unchangeable truths that are, by definition, "beyond our reach." In trying to "go outside ourselves" we create a tissue of verbal fictions and fashion nonrealities according to our own imaginations. Consequently, human "inanity" creates an elaborate, weblike, and illusory world that it continually mistakes for something solid and objectively real. Whereas Luther saw the power of faith as breaking the grip of illusion and granting a new perspective, Montaigne turned to history.68 He used a historical perspectivism to deflate all claims to certainty and absolute truths. His endless listing of past beliefs demonstrated the relativity of all claims to truth. Repeatedly Montaigne used the language of perspective. 62 Ibid., p. 328. 63 Ibid., p. 856.

At times he did hold to the 362</page><page sequence="19">Appearances and Reality He delighted in variety because it proved that "reality" depended on our point of view. Thus "what matters is not merely that we see the thing, but how we see it."''69 He stated continually that he saw things from his "angle" or "point of view." He recognized that life in progress does not give us a "picture of the whole." In fact, Montaigne insisted, "I do not see the whole of anything, nor do those who promise to show it to us.""' So, too, "things may be considered from various lights and various viewpoints: it is prin- cipally from this that diversity of opinion arises. One nation looks at one side of a thing and stops there; another at another."" This interest in the perspective of the knower dominated his purpose in listing the changes of various beliefs throughout history. The vast diversity of beliefs that existed throughout time about God, immortality, providence, and cosmology proved that no single or final truth could ever be found.7" "Truth," Mon- taigne argued, must be "solid and firm" and must have "one face."7" His- tory, however, taught that we have no access to such an unchangeable and stable reality: "If we see flourishing now one art, one opinion, now another ... what becomes of all those fine prerogatives on which we flatter our- selves? Since a wise man can be mistaken and a hundred men and many nations, yes, and human nature, according to us is mistaken for many cen- turies about this or that, what assurance have we that sometimes it stops being mistaken, and that in this century it is not making a mistake?"" traditional view of "history teaching by example," but in true Renaissance and historicist fashion, he also saw the ambiguity of examples and of trying to imitate a distant past.

In the essay "On Vanity" Montaigne made a comment that may seem inconsequential but actually epitomized his thought. After bewailing the sickness of his age, Montaigne observed, "We cannot escape the present." We are, above all else, historical creatures and as such we live life in the midst of a mutability that defines us individually and collectively. The world of ever-changing appearances is where we ex- ist, and there is no escaping this realm. According to Montaigne, we must make our home here, not elsewhere. We are to be like Socrates who "was a man, and wanted neither to be nor to seem anything else."'5 In denying access to anything beyond appearances, Montaigne was not denying ab- solutes but access to absolutes. By denying such access, Montaigne sought an ethic of humanity, an ethic that accepted our fully human yet limited nature. As Montaigne said, "To compose our character is our duty.... Our great and glorious masterpiece is to live appropriately."'6 This ethic of humanity was, above all else, an ethic of incompleteness, especially the in- completeness of human knowledge. Our ethical duty is to "live appropri- ately" or virtuously within this realm of flux, motion, and appearances. It must be admitted, however, that Montaigne made positive assertions about the nature of that inaccessible realm of truth. The conclusion to the Apology for Raymond Sebond is the most famous of these passages that posi- tively depict the full reality of God and truth. Here Montaigne reveals his Platonic assumptions (adopted from Plutarch) about that realm which is "beyond our reach." But then what really is? That which is eternal: that is to say, what never had birth, nor will ever have an end; to which time never brings any change. For time is a mo- bile thing, which appears as in a shadow, together with matter, which is ever run- ning and flowing, without ever remaining stable or permanent. ... Wherefore we must conclude that God alone is-not at all according to any measure of time, but according to an eternity immutable and immobile, not measured by time or sub- ject to any decline; before whom there is nothing, nor will there be after ... but one who really is-who by one single now fills the ever; and there is nothing that really is but he alone." Montaigne did believe in descriptions such as these. However, his point was one of contrast. Humanity cannot live in this realm because we belong to the world that does not have full being. Humanity lives only in the world 15 Ibid., p. 681. 76 Ibid., p. 851. The acceptance of our humanity is a theme found throughout the Essays. On p. 619, Montaigne observed, "In my opinion it is living happily, not, as Antisthenes said, dying happily, that constitutes human felicity." See also n. 61 above. 77 Ibid., p. 456. 364</page><page sequence="21">Appearances and Reality of time, language, and change. Again Montaigne likened our existence to that which slips though our fingers like the quicksilver of a written text: We have no communication with Being ... and if you should try to determine to try and grasp what man's being is, it would be exactly like trying to hold a fistful of water; the more tightly you squeeze anything the nature of which is always to flow, the more you will lose what you try to retain in your grasp. So, because all things are subject to pass from change to change, reason is baffled if it looks for a sub- stantial existence in them since it cannot apprehend a single thing which subsists permanently because everything is either coming into existence (and so not fully existent yet) or, if it has been born, it is beginning to die.78 The human realm is characterized by being the nonessential; it has no sta- bility, no absolutes or essences that we can grasp. This is a world of con- stant "rolling," "flowing," "changing," and "inconstancy." Montaigne had to redefine the being available to humanity. In this world "being is some- thing we hold dear and being consists in movement and action.""79 Our realm is constantly in motion: The world is but a perennial movement. All things in it are in constant mo- tion-the earth, the rocks of Caucasus, the pyramids of Egypt-both with the common motion and with their own. Stability itself is nothing but a more lan- guid motion. I cannot keep my subject still. It goes along befuddled and staggering, with a natural drunkenness. I take it in this condition, just as it is at the moment I give my attention to it. I do not portray being; I portray passing. [or "becoming": 'Je ne peins pas l'etre. Je peins passage"]. Not the passing from one age to another, or, as the people say, from seven years to seven years, but from day to day, from minute to minute. My history needs to be adapted to the moment."8 This is the human home in which Montaigne urged us to "live appro- priately," even happily. This world offers no certitude "but only a feeble and uncertain opinion." Just as history precluded absolutes and could only demonstrate relativity, so, too, the soul's constant changes thwarted all certitude. The entire world, including the human being, was "all mo- tion and inconstancy." By portraying "becoming" or "passing" Mon- taigne was advocating the limited life. He was affirming the necessity of living in a precarious balance amidst appearances. Those appearances, however, did not lead beyond themselves to some kind of deeper or es- sential reality that the mind could know.

If we stayed within this proper inner realm we, like Montaigne, would not search for far-off, stable, eternal, divine, unchang- ing reality or essences behind the phenomenal world. Those things which philosophers have called reality were nothing but a mesh of verbal fictions created by the imagination. Montaigne sought to make the world of ap- pearances in and of itself real. Within the limits of humanity, only ap- pearances were real. By arguing in this way, Montaigne felt fully justified in recording his many experiences. He elevated human experience to a subject worthy of attention, even scrutiny. This emphasis is clear from the fact that he called his final, and arguably greatest essay, "On Experience." There was a humility and melancholy about Montaigne as he looked out on his war-torn world and questioned the reality of those transcen- dent causes for which his neighbors claimed to be fighting.83 His attack on epistemological assumptions was much more than a fight about the reality or unreality of essences. His purpose was to show that the mind could not know those transcendent truths, debates about which he be- lieved to be tearing his traditional world apart. Montaigne agreed with Socrates: "In Socrates' opinion, and in mine too, the wisest way to judge heaven is not to judge it at all."84 He sought an ethic of incompleteness that would accept this limited, provisional, changing, and contingent 1 The Complete Works of Montaigne, pp. 15, 132, 230, 368-69, 380, 385, 389-97, 789. 12 Ibid., p. 455: "Finally, there is no existence that is constant, either of our being or of that of objects. And we, and our judgment, and all mortal things go on flowing and rolling un- ceasingly. Thus nothing certain can be established about one thing by another, both the judg- ing and the judged being in continual change and motion" (my emphasis). See also pp. 481, 610-11, 756, 815-57. It is important to note that Montaigne did contrast appearances to the deeper self proving that the appearance can be deceptive with reference to the inner soul. This point is proven by recourse to Socrates, who was ugly on the outside but wise within, an argument disproving the usual argument about physiognomy, pp. 808-11. " Montaigne was certainly not unaware that religion and power were intertwined and inex- tricably so in their extreme forms, as he states in the Apology for Raymond Sebond, "Men are the leaders here and make use of religion; it ought to be the quite the contrary. See if it is not by our hands that we lead it, drawing as if from wax, so many contrasting figures from a rule so straight and so firm. When has this been seen better than in France in our own day? Those who have taken it to the left, those who have taken it to the right, those who call it black, those who call it white, use it so similarly for their violent and ambitious enterprises, conduct themselves in these with a procedure so identical in excesses and injustice, that they render doubtful and hard to believe that there really exists, as they claim, a difference of opinion between them in a thing on which depends the conduct and law of our life" (p. 323). It should also be noted that I am using the term "melancholy" in a general sense, not in the sense used by Screech in M. A.

He saw claims to transcendence, to knowledge of higher truths, and to purified perceptions as dangerous. The civil wars convinced him that such claims were not only unreal but also ominous. In his politique solution to the "malignant" wars of his time, Montaigne opposed both the fanaticism of the Catholic League and the unlawful- ness, stubbornness, and love of novelty displayed by the Huguenots. His defense of Catholicism revolved to a large extent around its call for obe- dience to governmental authorities. Such obedience could save his soci- ety from ending up as cannibals. He argued, "Humility and submissive- ness alone can make a good man. The knowledge of his duty should not be left to each man's judgment; it should be prescribed to him, not left to the choice of his reason. Otherwise, judging by the imbecility and infinite variety of our reasons and opinions, we would finally forge for ourselves duties that would set us to eating one another, as Epicurus says." His skepticism was aimed at the same purpose. In the name of verbal fictions, he argued, French society was devouring itself. Beyond the polit- ical answer, Montaigne addressed what he saw as the philosophical and epistemological heart of the problem. Therefore, Montaigne argued, safety consisted in the full acceptance of the limited, relative, and incom- plete world of appearances as the only realm proper to humanity. It is im- portant to understand what Montaigne was doing here. By arguing in this manner, Montaigne reversed the traditional hierarchy or value structure between appearances and reality. The disjunction was now not between appearances and reality but, rather, between appearances and the unreal, the fictive, the nonexistent. To try to reach a reality beyond appearances was to live in a self-constructed, purely verbal illusion. This illusion was one of "verbal quibbles," "verbal subtleties," "vain and verbal knowledge," and "verbal crimes," all in a "world that is nothing but babble.""8 To defend those unsubstantial illusions as absolute and certain truths was to threaten to destroy society. Beyond Montaigne stood the towering figure of Shakespeare, in whom we find a much darker vision.87 Despite his portrayals of heroic and royal figures, Shakespeare shared with Montaigne the depiction of human be- "8 Ibid., p. 359.

They certainly de- serve attention, but I am concentrating on the tragedies, which dramatize most thoroughly 367</page><page sequence="24">The Journal of Religion ings as those who must live "close to the ground.""8 However, Shake- speare deepened the issue. In Shakespeare we find the existential tragic vision of Luther joined with the skepticism of Montaigne. His "skepti- cism" was neither a classical skepticism nor a purely epistemological problem about claims to knowledge. Rather he showed how skepticism exposes the existential anguish of one who must live knowing that ap- pearances cannot be trusted. Shakespeare's characters had to negotiate reality in a world far from God, a world that was always shifting, uncer- tain, dissolving, and in confusion. Repeatedly Shakespeare portrayed life amidst such an unstable and shifting reality. And, once again, this anxiety about finding the truth expressed itself in questions about the relationship between appearance and reality. This concern runs throughout the major tragedies. Space constraints preclude any thor- ough analysis of all the tragedies. The most obvious choice would be to examine Hamlet since the melancholy Dane is so well known for his skep- ticism and the tragedy resulting from his awareness that appearances cannot be trusted. However, I hope to show that even in Othello we find a masterful analysis of precisely this theme. Therefore I will focus on Othello and close with brief observations on Hamlet, King Lear, and Mac- beth. Turning to selected scenes in Othello, we can see Shakespeare dram- atizing the problematic relationship between truth and perception. We can also observe that as Shakespeare developed his mature tragic vision, he was driven more and more toward questions about the power of de- ception, the human ability to be deceived, the obfuscation of reality, and the problem of human knowledge.89 the problem of appearance and reality.

As we watch these pairs of opposites re- place one another we witness the collapse of all order, stability, meaning, and certainty. In the marriage of Othello and Desdemona we begin with the ideal of romantic love, which is the vision of goodness, love, and loyalty. We also begin with the portrait of an epic hero who is confident and certain of his identity. However, into this world slinks what Heilman has called the "athlete of deception."90 With the entrance of lago we watch the devel- opment of that jealousy that Millicent Bell has described as "an episte- mological crisis that brings everything into doubt."91 lago sees himself as the skeptic out to destroy all delusions of ideality.92 To lago, love, honor, loyalty, virtue, and goodness are self-delusions or presumptions by which human nature pretends to be other than it really is. Iago believes him- self to be the destroyer of false ideas by which humans deceive them- selves. He is the "new man," without illusions, without belief in the un- seen, and without idealism.93 Having rejected these essentialist stable ideals, lago sees himself as a superior observer of reality. Because he is without the blindness of idealism, lago can strip others of their self- deceiving illusions by which they try to live. But lago is a superior ob- server of reality also because he is evil; there are no constraints holding him back or restraining his means and purposes. Moreover, lago had no fear; the world he was about to expose was a world he was very much aware of and in which he was at home. Iago's creed is the discrepancy between reality and appearance. For Iago, appearance and reality can so easily replace one another that there is no stable ground on which to stand. In lago, Shakespeare used skepti- cism to manipulate appearances and achieve demonic purposes. As in Montaigne, the world in Othello is one of constant flux, lacking all solidity and stability. As Heilman argued, lago converts qualities into their oppo- sites.9" As the physician he is a poisoner. As the light bearer he brings dark- ness. By means of these actions lago dissolves the boundaries between the real and the unreal. He confuses reality and appearance and thereby un- covers chaos and brutality. One reason lago is so successful is that he has 90 Heilman, Magic in the Web, p. 48. 9 Bell, p. 21. 92 Ibid., p. 91. 9 Ibid., p. 96; and William Empson, The Structure of Complex Words (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1970), pp. 218-49. 94 Heilman, Magic in the Web, pp. 64-70, 89-90. 369</page><page sequence="26">The Journal of Religion no form, no stable identity or essence."5 He is a chameleon or formless va- cancy who takes on whatever identity the circumstances demand. This formlessness is introduced as lago's main characteristic at the opening of the play. He tells Roderigo that he is one of those who "trimm'd in forms and visages of duty, / Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves" (1.1.51-52). He only "seems" to act for love or duty. But "when my out- ward action doth demonstrate / The native act and figure of my heart / In compliment extern, 'tis not long after / But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve / For daws to peck at. I am not what I am" (1.1.61-66). The phrase "I am not what I am" begs us instinctively to insert the word "seem." But lago's phrase is a blasphemous counterpoint to Yahweh's "I am that am.""96 In this phrase lago's diabolic character begins to emerge. Both his invidia and his nothingness reveal him as the demonic.97 This fact is reinforced by the reptile imagery used to portray him. Most important, because he is demonic, lago is the "father of lies." Using the tradition that the devil comes as the "angel of light," Shakespeare knew that lago must appear good in order to effect evil. In Shakespeare's source, Cinthio, lago is described as "di bellissima presenza"-a man with an attractive and charming exterior.98 Iago's evil must be concealed within something hand- some and virtuous. Hence he states "Tis here, but yet confus'd./ Knavery's plain face is never seen till us'd" (2.1.310-11). In a later soliloquy lago re- peats this insight that so fascinated Luther: "How am I then a villain / To counsel Cassio to this parallel course, / Directly to his good? Divinity of hell! / When devils will the blackest sins put on, / They do suggest at first with heavenly shows / As I do now" (2.3.345-47). As the vacant, empty, and formless figure of evil, lago can exploit the human ability-and even desire-to be deceived. Like Luther's devil, lago's method of deceit is all important. He is the master of dissimulation or the manipulator of appearances. He is the liar. He deceives by offering false interpretation of events and experiences. In lago's world the false permeates the true, rendering both unreal. As he lies to Othello, or "pours pestilence into his ear," lago always claims to be making reality visible. He 5 Bell argues that in Othello, lago works "to destroy belief in unimpugnable essences," in- cluding the essence of personal identity. Iago shows that "nothing belongs inalienably to one's nature" (Bell, pp. 97 ff.). 96 Greenblatt, p. 236. Bell reads this phrase as the reversal of Saint Paul's statement, "By the grace of God I am what I am" (Bell, p. 92). 97 S. L. Bethell, "Shakespeare's Imagery: The Diabolic Images in Othello," in Muir and Ed- wards, eds., pp. 29-47. The classic study on lago's personification of evil as the "Vice" of the morality play is Bernard Spivack, Shakespeare and the Allegory of Evil (New York: Columbia University Press, 1958). However, this view has been astutely questioned by Leah Scragg who identified lago as the devil instead of "the Vice"; Leah Scragg, "Iago-Vice or Devil?" in Muir and Edwards, eds., pp. 48-60. "9 Bethell, p. 39. 370</page><page sequence="27">Appearances and Reality insists that he is only bringing to light that which lies concealed, unseen, and unknown. In so doing he replaces truth with falsehood, being with seeming, reality with appearance. He also renders all experience thor- oughly malleable and unreliable. Appearance and truth become so indis- tinguishable that their fluidity dissolves all difference between the real and the unreal. As the demonic, lago seeks to reverse all norms and be- liefs that keep chaos at bay. The play is full of references to transformations that are, in fact, rever- sals. Following his statement that "I am not what I am" he promises to dis- credit Desdemona by "turning her virtue into pitch" (2.3.354). By the end of the play, Desdemona has become a "fair devil" to Othello (3.3.482). Iago announces his plans to reverse Othello's nature by framing Cassio with the handkerchief by saying, "Trifles light as air / Are to the jealous confirma- tions strong / As proof of Holy Writ. This may do something. / The Moor already changes with my poison. / Dangerous conceits are, in their nature, poisons, / Which at first are scarce found to distaste, / But with a little act upon the blood / Burn like the mines of sulphur" (3.3.327-34). And of course the greatest transformation is the change from Othello into a bru- tal beast, a transformation traced in the play by the increasing number of animalistic images. In lago's hands, even the line between humanity and the bestial world evaporates. At the end of the play Lodovico asks regard- ing Othello, "Is this the nature/ Whom passion could not shake?" lago an- swers, "He is much chang'd" (4.1.266-72). Even Othello refers to himself in the past tense, "That's he that was Othello. Here I am" (5.2.292). This haunting reply echoes lago's words, "I am not what I am." If lago's creed is the fluidity between appearance and reality, Othello's creed was their identity; Othello craved a stability that would provide him with certainty. He could not live among shifting appearances. He could not endure the chameleon-like existence personified by lago. A compari- son with Montaigne may be instructive at this point. If we recall Mon- taigne's urging for the incomplete life lived amidst appearances, we will see Othello as one who shows that life to be unbearable. Montaigne thought such a world to be safer. But Shakespeare makes clear that an in- substantial world was open to the endless manipulation of a figure such as lago. People such as Desdemona and Othello were easily victims of those who chose not to accept but, rather, to exploit the fluidity of the world of appearances. And people like Othello were particularly vulnerable to lago because Othello could not endure doubt and skepticism. Othello demanded certainty at all costs. Shakespeare demonstrated this demand by using terms of sight throughout the play, words such as "see," "per- ceive," "behold," "mark," "look," and "light." Othello's insistence for "ocu- lar proof" is only the most explicit portrayal of his craving for certitude. Moreover, sight belongs to the world we experience. By undermining 371</page><page sequence="28">The Journal of Religion knowledge gained by sight, Shakespeare's lago is throwing all of experi- enced reality into doubt. Iago strips Othello of all certainty through the manipulation of ap- pearances, a manipulation that renders all of experience unreliable. Iago's intent reaches its culmination in the famous temptation scene in act 3, scene 3. Iago stealthily, inch by inch, plants jealousy in Othello's mind. As in Hamlet, Shakespeare used the imagery of poison. Poison, like adul- tery, is that which cannot be observed and "infects unseen." Shakespeare masterfully depicts how lago pretends that he does not want to share his suspicions with Othello. Othello has to "drag it out of him" as he insists that lago tell him what he is thinking: "Think my lord? By heaven, he echoes me, / As if there were some monster in his thought / Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something. ... As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain / Some horrible conceit. If thou dost love me, / Show me thy thought" (3.3.111-21). Furthermore, Othello attributes lago's hesita- tion to his "honesty" saying, "This honest creature doubtless / Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds" (3.3.249-250)." In this crucial scene lago and Othello agree, "Men should be what they seem." But what are they? Othello no longer knows. The ground is shifting beneath him as all his previous assumptions and experiences come into question. He be- gins to doubt Desdemona and demands the certainty he still believes sight can offer: For she had eyes, and chose me. No, lago, I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove; And on the proof, there is no more but this- Away at once with love or jealousy! [3.3.195-98] Othello's demands for certainty become obsessive. He tells lago, "Vil- lain, be sure thou prove my love a whore! / Be sure of it. Give me the ocu- lar proof, / Or, by the worth of mine eternal soul, / Thou hadst been bet- ter have been born a dog / Than answer my wak'd wrath!" ... Make me to see't, or, at the least / That the probation bear no hinge or loop / To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life" (3.3.364-71). The play is full of refer- ences to "proofs." In the temptation scene lago humbly states, "I speak not yet of proof" (3.3.202). He then speaks of "other proofs" as he convinces Othello that he knows the truth about Desdemona. But Othello has already begun to trust Iago's perception. Although lago has not yet "proven" or "shown" Othello anything, nonetheless, Othello tells him, "If more thou dost perceive, let me know more" (3.3.246). Shakespeare re- peatedly makes Othello assume that he has seen or heard "more" than he " Empson, pp. 185-249. 372</page><page sequence="29">Appearances and Reality actually has witnessed. The most startling of these statements is found in the exchange between Emilia and Othello after Desdemona's murder. Emilia cannot believe her husband, lago, has convinced Othello of Des- demona's unfaithfulness. Othello replies, "Ay 'twas he that told me on her first / An honest man he is" (5.2.153). That lago was the "first" to tell him leaves the impression that others have also told him of Desdemona's adul- tery. But of course we know this to be false. By adding words such as "more" and "first," Shakespeare portrayed the growth of a new certainty in Othello's deluded mind. Othello expresses the anxiety of that uncer- tainty he cannot bear when he says, "I think my wife be honest and think she is not; / I think that thou art just and think that thou art not. / I'll have some proof" (3.3.389-91). Shortly thereafter Othello convinces himself that lago is right-even before spying on Cassio and lago conversing. After Iago "thickens the proof," with the report of Cassio's alleged dream and sleep talking, Othello cries, "Now I do see 'tis true. Look here, lago, / All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven, / 'Tis gone. / Arise, black vengeance, from the hollow hell!" (3.3.448-51). On the basis of a dream reported secondhand, Othello is willing to exchange one certainty for an- other. Anything is better than "not knowing" the truth, as is clear in Oth- ello's words, "Thou hast set me on the rack. / I swear 'tis better to be much abus'd [deceived] / Than to know 't a little" (3.3.341-43). As Othello begins to distrust Desdemona, he fully believes that he is finally seeing reality for what it is. Like lago, he has become a man "in the know" about the world. Calling lago "honest," he believes what lago has "seen and known" (4.1.280). After spying on lago and Cassio, Othello talks of "perceiving" and "seeing" (4.1.170-75) as if he were party to the conversation. In fact, before lago even has a chance to tell him what Cas- sio allegedly said, Othello says, "How shall I murder him, lago?" (4.1.169). He yells at Desdemona that he "saw" the handkerchief (5.2.65). He in- forms Emilia that her husband, "honest, honest lago" revealed the truth to him about his wife (5.2.162). Of course, the tragedy is that when he "sees" he is deceived; when he thinks he was deceived, he "saw" the truth. But by this time reality has become so unstable that the idea of "the truth" has become radically ambiguous and unsteady. In Othello Shakespeare shared Luther's fear that evil parodied the good in such a way as to seem all too real. In Othello the power of evil acts by making falsehood parody the truth to such an extent that its masquerade is undetectable. As did Montaigne, Shakespeare undermined that sense most identified with knowledge in order to render the possibility of knowledge question- able. By focusing on the relationship between perception and truth, Shakespeare portrayed a deep skepticism about the power of perception, the ability to interpret experience, and the stability of reality. By changing light into darkness, Iago renders all of reality precarious, fluctuating, and 373</page><page sequence="30">The Journal of Religion fluid. In the figure of Othello, Shakespeare has shown the danger of the demand for certainty as well as the unbearable difficulty of living without it. By destroying the identity between reality and appearance, lago brings Othello to a "seeming" but "certain" knowledge that is the opposite of truth. The final words of the play epitomize the theme of perception and re- ality. In the final scene the emphasis on "sight" gives way to "speech." Iago tells Emilia, "I told him what I thought, and told no more / Than what he found himself was apt and true" (5.2.183-84). The dialogue then centers on Emilia's repeated attempts "to speak." Determined to speak, she re- bukes lago by saying "I will not charm [keep silent] my tongue; I am bound to speak." She emphatically insists on speaking three more times and finally is able to reveal lago's plot. Significantly, lago's last words are about silence: Othello: Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil Why he hath thus ensar'd my soul and body? Iago: Demand me nothing, what you know you know. From this time forth, I will never speak a word. [5.2.309-12] The silence of lago is very important. As Heilman and others have noted, with his absolute silence lago retreats from the world of social inter- course.'"" A further comparison with Montaigne may be useful. Despite his barbs about the "airy" nature of words, Montaigne had a deep love of lan- guage, as is clear not only from his use of words but the vitality of his ex- pression and style."" It was because of this deep love of language that he so vehemently criticized the misuse of words. He was, furthermore, aware of the fragility of language. Although words are easily misused, nonethe- less, language is all that we have to keep society intact. In his essay "On Giving the Lie," Montaigne warned, "Our truth of nowadays is not what is, but what others can be convinced of." It is a dangerous situation when "dissimulation is among the most notable qualities of this century." Lying is dangerous because it breaks down all civil ties. As Montaigne wrote, "Since mutual understanding is brought about solely by way of words, he who breaks his word betrays human society. It [language] is the only in- strument by means of which our wills and thoughts communicate; it is the interpreter of the soul. If it fails us, we have no more hold on each other, no more knowledge of each other. If it deceives us, it breaks up all our re- ... Heilman, Magic in the Web, pp. 120-24. '' Robert D.

By means of lying, lago did ex- actly what Montaigne feared. He "dissolved all bonds of society.""'0 Ren- dering knowledge uncertain and words deceptive, it was really lago who made "chaos come again." I have reviewed Othello not to claim any new insight but to make an im- portant contrast with Luther and Montaigne. Shakespeare has, with good reason, been called a skeptic.'03 He is clearly a perspectival thinker, as Norman Rabkin so clearly showed when writing, "It is perhaps the most familiar mark of Shakespeare's complementary sensibility that he recog- nizes how from any subjective position there is a kind of truth; each man's world makes sense to him, and all his intelligence serves what he is-even if he is a scoundrel."'04 However, Shakespeare was not a skeptic in the same sense as Montaigne. According to Shakespeare one can, indeed, pierce through appearances to the reality that lies beneath. One is never left only with the "seeming" that makes, for Montaigne, all knowledge incomplete. But the knowledge one finds in Shakespeare is neither the transcendence of faith nor the empty verbal fabrications of the human mind. In the tragedies Shakespeare's characters discover the evil that lies at the core of reality. By piercing through the fictional world of appearances, the tragic hero confronts the burden of knowledge and the terror of truth. Othello did have to confront reality when, learning of Desdemona's innocence, he witnessed, "chaos come again" (3.3.93-94). There is in Shakespeare no lack of knowledge. There is instead the awful realization that the com- forting assurances about justice, stability, law, virtue, and order are actu- ally only fragile appearances, appearances that are precarious and vul- nerable to the chaos and evil that are always raging just below the surface. Hamlet, King Lear, and Macbeth further develop this theme. These plays show us again that appearances mask a hidden horror that lies just below the world of appearances. That horror, whether signified by the Ghost of old Hamlet, the storm, the witches, or Banquo's ghost, always threatens to erupt into the surface world. In the following conclusion I hope to make brief comments on these plays that will bring to light the ways in which 102 The Complete Works of Montaigne, p. 505. 10" Stanley Cavell, Disowning Knowledge in Six Plays of Shakespeare (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987); Graham Bradshaw, Shakespeare's Skepticism (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1987); Bell (n. 90 above).

The figure of Hamlet personifies the intellectual who questions the tra- ditional values of his world. In grief for his father and shock over his mother's remarriage-but before any knowledge of the Ghost-Hamlet talks of suicide in his "0, that this too too sullied flesh would melt," solilo- quy. The world Hamlet experiences this early in the play is merely an "un- weeded garden / That grows to seed," completely possessed by "Things rank and gross in nature." Wishing the "Everlasting" had not forbidden suicide, Hamlet feels, "How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable / Seem to me all the uses of this world" (1.2.129-37). No words could better express that alienation from the world caused by questioning traditional values and assumptions. It is of the utmost significance that before Hamlet has any knowledge of the murder, he is in tension with his world and its pur- poses. He is not only struggling with grief. His grief is a tool that awakens in him the awareness that the whole world and its values are stale. From the start, Hamlet is detached from the glittering court around him. The world now nauseates him. Nonetheless, Hamlet is not allowed to stay in the psychological situation described in his first soliloquy. That tension between Hamlet and his world is only the beginning. In short, he is not permitted to bejust melan- choly. The Ghost pushes him further and forces him to see a deeper level of reality. This is the reality of the night world that the Ghost inhabits.'05 The Ghost first appeared to the guards "In the dead waste and middle of the night" (1.2.198) and reappears to Hamlet at near midnight. The Ghost "Revisits thus the glimpses of the moon, / Making night hideous" (1.4.54-55). The deeper reality that the Ghost discloses alienates Hamlet even more thoroughly from the traditional world of appearances. After the Ghost reveals what Claudius was to call "that primal eldest curse," Hamlet can never fully return to the world he left behind. From this point forward he can only play a part in the midst of a world he knows to be fun- damentally false. The Ghost's message decisively separates Hamlet from everything he knew before; even the "unweeded garden" of life. Hamlet changes from melancholy to tragic. He becomes the person with a differ- ent perspective. In a strange way, Hamlet resembles Luther's Noah; from a "higher" or "deeper" perspective, both men were estranged because they entered a different reality. Shakespeare dramatized this separation in many ways but perhaps most dramatically in the person of Polonius. Polonius is fully engaged in the 105 On the nature of the Ghost, see Stephen Greenblatt, Hamlet in Purgatory (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2001). 376</page><page sequence="33">Appearances and Reality world of appearances and superficial values. He is usually seen giving fatuous advice about love or about how "the apparel oft proclaims the man." Most important, Shakespeare plots Polonius's entrances and exits with those of the Ghost in order to highlight the discrepancy between ap- pearance and reality. Hamlet's "Frailty thy name is woman" soliloquy and his wish that "the night were come ... Foul deeds will rise / Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes" (1.2.254-57) places the audience in the world of the night and its reality. Shakespeare then arranges the fol- lowing scenes to move from the Ghost to Polonius, back to the Ghost and then back to Polonius. This sequence where the appearances of the Ghost are framed by scenes with Polonius serves to illustrate Hamlet's dilemma as he is pulled between the two worlds. This sequence also raises the ulti- mate question, namely, "what is real?" As the play progresses, the Ghost becomes ominously more and more real, eventually overshadowing the ever-busy plot of Claudius's court. Hamlet gradually belongs more and more to the world of the night. He participates in the life of the court only to verify, through the mousetrap play, that the Ghost was telling the truth. After getting the proof he demanded, Hamlet becomes committed to the reality and truth of the Ghost's realm. He cannot pretend he has not seen the truth of the night world. The famous issue of revenge centers not only around Christian teaching but also about Hamlet's reaction to his new awareness. In a way the Ghost's cry for revenge backfires. Revenge re- quires Hamlet to participate in the surface world of the court. However, the vision of the night has alienated him forever from that world. The de- mand for revenge poses for Hamlet a terrible existential problem; that is, how does one live in a world that he no longer believes to be ultimately real? Recognizing true reality and all its horror, how does one "return" and act on knowledge learned in the night world. The famous question of "delay," which Hamlet gives voice to in his soliloquy about "thinking too precisely on th'event" (4.4.32-66), is the dilemma provoked by the Ghost's demand. Just as the Ghost is caught in the middle world of purgatory and walking about as an "extravagant [wandering] and erring spirit;' so, too, Hamlet is caught between the world of the night and the surface world of plots, relationships, and actions. Horatio was right when he warned Ham- let that speaking to the ghost could "draw you into madness" (1.4.73-74). Hamlet does "return" by going back to Denmark and trusting in provi- dence; that is, he resigns himself to kill Claudius when the right mo- ment presents itself. This new attitude of resignation to the "divinity that shapes our ends" results in disaster. The reason for this disaster is crucial. Throughout the play everyone involved in the court is always hiding, spy- ing, eavesdropping, and plotting. Nothing has changed, as is evident from the plot hatched by Claudius and Laertes. But Hamlet is no longer play- ing a part, no longer spying and hiding in order to find the truth. Hamlet 377</page><page sequence="34">The Journal of Religion knows the truth and has "let go." As a result he is no longer alert or "on his toes." Consequently he falls victim to the methods of the world he left be- hind. He falls prey to the manipulation of appearances orchestrated by Claudius and Laertes. He does not see the trap that is to cause his death. He is out of practice in the ways of this world. As he lies dying, Hamlet begs that the truth be revealed, "O God, Hor- atio, what a wounded name / Things standing thus unknown shall I leave / behind me. / If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart, / Absent thee from felicity awhile, / and in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain / To tell my story" (5.2.347-51). Why does Hamlet care that the truth be revealed? I would argue that Hamlet's demand for the truth is the only act of integ- rity he can cling to within this false world-and the only act he can take with him into the world of the night. Turning to King Lear, we watch as the force of chaos breaks out into the civilized world. After the opening scene, Lear's world is the world of the night. Once again the language of sight is used repeatedly to denote the lack of knowledge about this deeper reality. We have the "eyeless rage" of the sea (3.1.8) and the "plucking out" of Gloucester's eyes (3.7.68-7 1). Like Othello, Gloucester learns that "I stumbled when I saw" (3.7.19). Gloucester goes on to confess that he now sees "feelingly" (4.6.149). As the knowledge of the true horror increases all boundaries dissolve. The line between human and animal is crossed as Lear's daughters are increasingly described as "tigers" (4.2.40), "serpent-like" (2.4.159), and "Centaurs" (4.6.124). Moreover, in the traditional cosmology of the day, the elements of nature, especially water, had to be restrained or chaos would overflow the earth. Lear's words in the famous storm scene depict this overflowing of chaos as everything is let loose, "Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage, blow! / You cataracts and hurricanes, spout / Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the / cocks! / You sulph'rous and thought-executing fires, / Vaunt-courriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts, / Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking / thunder / Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world! / Crack nature's molds, all germains spill at once, / That makes the ingrateful man" (3.2.1-9). This howling is followed, of course, by the "tempest" in Lear's mind. Lear, who has but "slenderly known himself," is now thrust into the deep- est reality of all. Always Lear fears, "0, that way madness lies" (3.4.11-21). Horatio's fear about Hamlet is true for Lear as this underworld does, in- deed, "draw him into madness." As the kingdom cracks apart Lear goes mad and learns the reality of that evil he had never known. The gods and the universe are indifferent as the brutality of the underworld overflows into the ordered state. The duke of Albany expresses the terror of this un- derlying reality when he cries, "If that the heavens do not their visible spir- its send quickly down to tame these vile offenses, / It will come, / Human- ity must perforce prey upon itself, / like monsters of the deep" (4.2.47-50). 378</page><page sequence="35">Appearances and Reality In Macbeth Shakespeare depicts the world of terror as nightmare be- comes reality. Macbeth makes us see the underworld seep into the world of appearances as we watch "the frame of things disjoint" (3.2.18). We are tempted to believe Malcolm's possible warning, "But there's no bottom, none" (4.3.60). In Macbeth havoc reigns as all boundaries collapse between reality and fantasy, natural and supernatural, spectral and surface worlds. The spectral appearances of the witches and Banquo's Ghost signify the anarchy unleashed by Duncan's murder. In response to Banquo's Ghost, Macbeth cries, "The time has been / That, when the brains were out, the man would die, /And there an end" (3.4.79-81). That time is now gone as the underworld bursts into the open. The question of what is real repeat- edly occurs, as evident in Macbeth's questions about the witches, "Come, let me clutch thee / I have thee not, and yet I see thee still. / Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible / To feeling as to sight? Or art thou but / A dagger of the mind, a false creation / Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?" (2.1.35-40). This dissolving of boundaries is summed up in the expres- sion, "nothing is / But what is not" (1.3.141-42) or the statement by the witches, "Fair is foul, and foul is fair."'06 Macbeth surpasses Othello in the rendering of all reality unstable. As Lennox describes this new world, "The night has been unruly. Where we lay, / Our chimneys were blown down, and, as they say, / Lamentings heard i' th' air; strange screams of death, / And prophesying, with accents terrible / Of dire combustion and confus'd events / New hatch'd to th' woeful time. The obscure bird / Clam- or'd the livelong night. Some say the earth / Was feverish and did shake" (2.3.54-61). On this "bloody stage" where one hears the "screams of death," even Duncan's horses "eat each other" (2.4.18), an image used by both Montaigne and Shakespeare to denote anarchy. The restoration of order in the final scenes of the tragedies is not Shakespeare's last word. Rather, the tragedies tell us that we live a precarious life amidst ordered and civilized appearances. In this surface realm chaos is only temporarily restrained. It will erupt again. In an age that watched the traditional certainties slipping away, it is not surprising to find the sixteenth century a time preoccupied with the dis- crepancy between appearances and reality. As Harries has shown, some thinkers such as Bruno reveled in the new freedom from conventional limits. For others, however, the search for "the real" took on an urgency that demanded answers. Luther, Montaigne, and Shakespeare shared a sense of the human being's dangerous liability to delusion. In their explo- rations of this liability they posed different answers. Luther believed that one lived either in faith or in idolatry. Still, transcendence of the unreal 106 Ibid., pp. 193-94. 379</page><page sequence="36">The Journal of Religion was possible through the new perception of faith. But the faith in the cross must take place first. Only from the cross could the believer gain a new and salvific perspective on the world. In short, the Christian tragic expe- rience of the crucifixion threw all the rationality of idolatry into question. Without this tragedy no transcendence would have been possible. For Montaigne, claims to transcendence had proven dangerous. Certainly it was better to accept as real only the appearances among which we live and forgo claims about a higher reality. Montaigne expressed the melancholy of living with a kind of emptiness and the loss of absolutes. Shakespeare returns us to the tragic sense we felt in Luther. However, Shakespeare joined the existential tragic vision of Luther with the melancholy skepti- cism of Montaigne. Both Luther and Shakespeare shared a sense of the tragic because tragedy requires that appearances and reality be not just different but opposed. According to Shakespeare, appearances may be al- luring, but they are opposed to a deeper reality. For Shakespeare, that reality, which was accessible through the tragic vision, was the horror of chaos and evil. The price one paid for finding the truth was not transcen- dence but catastrophe. It is worthwhile to remember that while modernity was dawning with all its promise and future accomplishments, the great- est master of all was depicting our deepest reality, in Albany's words from King Lear, as "humanity preying upon itself like monsters of the deep." 380</page></plain_text>
