This paper describes methods developed specifically for re- constructing individual organ- and tissue-absorbed dose of ra- diation from past exposures from medical treatments and pro- cedures for use in epidemiological studies. These methods have evolved over the past three decades and have been ap- plied to a variety of medical exposures including external- beam radiation therapy and brachytherapy for malignant and benign diseases as well as diagnostic examinations. The meth- ods used for estimating absorbed dose to organs in and outside the defined treatment volume generally require archival data collection, abstraction and review, and phantom measure- ments to simulate past exposure conditions. Three techniques are used to estimate doses from radiation therapy: (1) calcu- lation in three-dimensional mathematical computer models using an extensive database of out-of-beam doses measured in tissue-equivalent materials, (2) measurement in anthropomor- phic phantoms constructed of tissue-equivalent material, and (3) calculation using a three-dimensional treatment-planning computer. For diagnostic exposures, doses are estimated from published data and software based on Monte Carlo tech- niques. We describe and compare these methods of dose es- timation and discuss uncertainties in estimated organ doses and potential for future improvement. Seven epidemiological studies are discussed to illustrate the methods. C 2006 by Radiation Research Society INTRODUCTION Patients exposed to radiation during treatment for malig- nant and benign diseases and for diagnostic purposes are well suited to be subjects in studies designed to assess and quantify the role of radiation exposure in the development of subsequent disease. More than 100 epidemiological stud- ies of medically exposed populations have provided quan- titative information on cancer risk (1), with data that can be generalized for comparison with risk estimates from oth- er studies (2, 3). Medical studies offer special advantages. Exposures are given under controlled conditions that are generally well documented, and comparison subjects are readily available. The range of doses allows dose-response evaluations. They provide information on effects from high doses, which would be fatal if given as whole-body doses. These studies also provide information on interaction of radiation with other environmental factors, such as smoking and chemo- therapy, and interaction with genetic susceptibility. Ra- diation-induced tumors do not differ from other tumors; therefore, they can provide insight into the carcinogenic process. Epidemiological studies require dosimetry methods that estimate organ doses inside and outside radiation beams. The accurate estimation of absorbed dose to specific organs and tissues for individual study subjects permits quantifi- cation of risk as well as assessment of dose-response re- lationships and the modifying effects of age, sex and other treatments. Radiation therapy typically involves the deliv- ery of high doses to the treatment site; absorbed dose to other organs varies and depends largely on the distance from the treatment site. Radiation doses for epidemiological studies can be re- constructed many years after exposure, even without benefit of complete exposure information. Computing the dose to organs outside the treated volume is particularly challeng- ing because dose decreases rapidly with distance, and un- certainty about the precise location of the treatment area translates to uncertainty in the dose at the point of interest. Even within a single organ, the dose may vary consider- ably. The purpose of this review is to describe how we esti- mate the absorbed dose from external-beam radiation ther- apy, brachytherapy and diagnostic radiology and to provide case study examples of doses used in epidemiological stud- ies. Methods of assessing the dose from internal radionu- clides are well documented elsewhere and are not discussed here (4). 1 Address for correspondence: The University of Texas M. D.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Collection and Management of Patient Data Because dose estimates are based on each patient's individual treatment parameters, the quality of retrospective data depends on how complete and accurate the treatment records are for each subject. Diligence is re- quired to obtain details documenting all radiation therapy prior to the diagnosis of the health outcome under investigation. For external-beam radiation therapy, the records should include radiation energy, field size, anatomic location of fields (diagrams or photographs), treatment-planning details, daily treatment logs, and any other information relevant for re- constructing treatments. For brachytherapy, the record should include the radioactive isotope used, the activity of sources, duration of treatment, and anatomic location of the implant. For certain complex studies, such as studies of lung or breast tumors after treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma, additional documentation, including simulator films, photographs of the patient in the treatment position, and information describing the specific location of the second tumor should be obtained. Our studies show that with sufficient effort, complete radiation therapy records can be obtained for approximately 85-90% of patients, depending on the primary disease site, calendar year, and treatment institution. Re- cords are abstracted and coded by trained personnel, and at least 10% of the records are independently coded again by a dosimetrist or another abstractor. A higher percentage of the more complex records are reviewed for quality control. Data from the abstracted records are input electroni- cally, and edit checks are performed to identify outliers and inconsisten- cies in the data. When a parameter is unknown, some values can be imputed for dose calculations by using other subjects' data from the same institution, same period, or both. Documentation of studies of radiation exposures resulting from diag- nostic testing typically includes only a written description of the type of examination, with no details of the machine parameters. Sometimes in- formation on procedures can be obtained from current staff or institutional archives in the diagnostic radiology department. In the absence of specific machine parameters, organ dose is estimated on the basis of typical values reported in the literature for a given examination and time. Estimation of Radiation Absorbed Dose to Organs 1. External-beam radiation therapy The three major components of absorbed dose outside treatment beams from external-beam radiation therapy are: (1) radiation leakage through the head of the machine, (2) scatter off the beam collimators, and (3) scatter within the patient from the primary beam. To estimate organ doses from these sources for an epidemiological study, three techniques are used: (1) calculation using a three-dimensional (3D) mathematical com- puter model based on measurements made in a water or polystyrene phan- tom, (2) direct measurement in an anthropomorphic phantom constructed of tissue-equivalent material, and (3) calculation of dose using a treat- ment-planning computer. a. 3D mathematical computer model With this system, absorbed dose outside the treatment beam is mea- sured on a 3D grid in a large water or polystyrene phantom. The radiation detectors used are thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLDs) containing lithium fluoride or calcium fluoride powder in capsules or chips. The response of the TLD is standardized in a 60Co beam with output measured by the Accredited Dosimetry Calibration Laboratory at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, which is approved by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. TLD measurements are verified independently by ioni- zation-chamber measurements at selected points. Figure 1 shows a beam's-eye and lateral view of the out-of-beam mea- surement setup (5). Dosimeters are placed in a phantom on a 3D grid at A dosi meters Beam : edge center edge Central 0 2 5 10 70 Axis Distance from field edge (cm) Radiation beam dosimeters water surface /I L---y \Depth 2 cm 5 cm 10 cm VA ......... ...15 cm Centraxis 0 2 5 10 70 Distance from field edge (cm) FIG. 1.

Data are typically measured for field sizes of 5 x 5, 10 x 10, 15 x 15, and 20 x 20 cm2. We have an extensive library of measured out-of-beam data, including orthovoltage X rays (1 to 3 mm copper half-value layer), 60Co y rays, and high-energy photons (4-25 MV). Figure 2 shows ex- amples of out-of-beam data measured in water for 10 x 10-cm2 beams of six photon energies at a depth of 10 cm (5-7). The dose from a beam is divided into three regions for calculation of dose at any point. "In-beam" dose is calculated using depth-dose data in clinical use (8). "Near-beam" dose is calculated using a log-linear interpolation between points of measurement; this region varies from 7- 15 cm from the beam's edge, depending on radiation energy. "Far-out- side-beam" is calculated using a curve derived from measured data. For field sizes other than those measured, a linear interpolation between doses for measured field sizes is used. A three-dimensional mathematical computer model of the human body was designed to describe the external dimensions of a patient using a set of regular, geometric shapes (right-angle parallelepipeds) that can be de- scribed by simple mathematical expressions. Our mathematical computer model can be used to simulate a person of any age, based on body-size measurements made for a National Safety Council (NSC) study con- ducted by the Society of Automotive Engineers (9). NSC measurements were made in 1972 on more than 4,000 children from the United States</page><page sequence="3">DOSE RECONSTRUCTION FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES 143 ....... ...... ...00 :::. . .. .== == .

Our mathematical computer model was designed specifically for seven age groups: newborn and patients 1, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 19 (adult) years of age, with sizes of patients between these ages calculated by linear interpolation. The age- specific sizes of children for individual patients or populations of patients may not correspond to data from the 1970s in the United States; in this case, the phantom size can be selected by specifying height. Figure 3 shows a frontal view of the 1-, 3-, 5-, 10- and 15-year-old phantoms and the adult phantom (5). The arms and legs of the phantoms can be moved to simulate the patient's position during treatment. The overall height of the phantom, relative to age, was compared to growth charts2 supplied by the Centers for Disease Control, with good agreement. The same heights are used for males and females. Figure 4 shows that the average height for both sexes is essentially the same before age 15 years (5). The phantom is divided into five sections: head, neck, trunk, arms and legs. Using several atlases of anatomy (10-14), the locations of 29 organs are specified within the phantom: the brain, pituitary gland, parotid glands, sublingual glands, submaxillary glands, larynx, thyroid, breasts, heart, lungs, adrenal glands, kidneys, stomach, gallbladder, pancreas, liv- er, small intestine, ascending colon, transverse colon, splenic flexure, de- scending colon, sigmoid, rectum, bladder, prostate, testes, ovaries, uterus and vagina. The organs are represented by 1,400 individual points; these points are evenly spaced within organs to allow calculation of minimum, maximum and average doses. Additional organs or calculation points are added as needed. The locations of bone and active bone marrow (ABM) are also specified within the phantom and are divided into partitions; the proportional weight of each partition depends on the patient's age (15, 16). To calculate the dose to an anatomic site for a particular type of treat- ment, the beams are positioned on the mathematical computer model, with beam size, radiation energy, and treatment dose specified. Plane geometry is used to calculate the lateral distance from the nearest field edge and the depth from the surface to each of the points in the organs 180 170 150 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ --------- ---------------- ----------- 140 --- 130 E 120 -- O 110 -- 100 ---- 80- -------------------------- - - ---- - 1 3 0 - -- - -- - -- - -- - -- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - --- - - --- - - - - - -- -- - - - - - - - - - - - . - . . .--. 1 2 0 - - - - - - -- - -- - -- - - - - --- --- --- --- - -- --- - -- -- --- -- - --- --- --- - - - - - - - - - - -- - -- - - - - q) 760 50 - - 30 20 10 - ----- so - --- - -- - - - - -- - -- -- - -- - - - -- - - - - -- - - -- -- -- -- - - - - - - - 70 -- - - -- - -- -- --- - -- -- -- - --- -- -- - - - -- -- -- -- --- -- - -- -- - ---- ---- - -- -- -- -- ---- - - -- -- -- - -0 - - --- ---------- --- - - -- - - -- - -- - - -- - - -- -- -- -- -- --- - -- - -- -- -- -- - - - -- - --- - 1 3 5 10 15 Adult Age (Years) FIG. 3.

This calculation method is suitable for estimating dose at any distance from beams. b. Anthropomorphic phantom Doses to organs can be measured directly in an anthropomorphic phan- tom. Three sizes of commercially available Alderson Rando3 phantoms are used: adult male, adult female and 6-year-old child (Fig. 5). The phantoms can be modified for specific patient characteristics, such as various breast sizes. The phantoms are constructed of three densities of tissue-equivalent material that closely simulate the composition of the human body (e.g. soft tissue, lung and bone). Dosimeters are placed throughout the phantom on a 1.5-cm grid at locations determined by the requirements of the particular study. The phantom is irradiated using the same techniques used to treat a patient (Fig. 6). Typical irradiation re- quires several hundred dosimeters for a 3D mapping of a region of in- terest. c. 3D treatment-planning computer The method of choice for calculating dose to anatomic regions in or near the radiation beam used for cancer therapy is a commercially avail- able treatment-planning system, such as the ADAC Pinnacle3 System (Philips Radiation Oncology Systems, Milpitas, CA). Such a system is suitable for irregularly shaped beams with special blocking, such as man- tle fields or inverted-Y fields (Fig. 7), which are used to treat patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. This method is limited to estimating doses to organs that are close to the anatomic site being irradiated. However, in most epidemiological studies, doses to distant organs are required and this method would not be applicable. d. Comparison of the methods to reconstruct doses from external-beam radiation therapy Each of the techniques used for estimating the radiation dose absorbed by organs outside the treatment site during therapy has advantages and disadvantages. An anthropomorphic phantom is the closest simulation of the irradiation of a patient; however, absorbed-dose measurements ob- tained using this system are valid only for specific irradiation conditions, are expensive, and are limited to phantoms of only a few sizes. The 3D mathematical model is much less expensive to use, can simulate a patient of any age or size, and offers complete flexibility in the selection and placement of treatment beams. The treatment-planning system is suitable only for situations requiring precise estimation in or near beams. In gen- eral, anthropomorphic phantoms are used for studies of adults receiving highly standardized treatments, with a limited range of field sizes, loca- tions and beam energies. The mathematical model is most suitable when there is large variation in patient size, such as in a pediatric population, or when a study includes a variety of radiation therapy techniques or many anatomic regions of interest. To ensure consistency, we verify that the results agree where two or more methods are applicable. 2. Brachytherapy Brachytherapy is "short-distance" therapy in which radiation is deliv- ered through tubes, needles or seeds placed in or on the patient.

Anthropomorphic (Alderson-Rando) phantoms, adult male, adult female, and 6-year-old child. clinical use, dose from sealed brachytherapy sources is calculated using isodose curves to estimate prescribed doses. This method is applicable to sealed sources of 226Ra, 60Co, 132CS, 198Au, 1251 or 192Ir (17, 18). For dose reconstruction, the mathematical computer model used for external-beam dosimetry, as described above, is used to calculate the distance from a radioactive source to the sites of interest. The validity of this method for estimating dose at distances far from the source has been verified by measurements in an Alderson-Rando phantom (19). 3. Diagnostic X-ray examinations Ideally, one can calculate dose from a diagnostic examination using software based on Monte Carlo simulations that take into account partic- ular machine parameters, such as kVp, filtration, field size and skin en- trance exposure. However, because machine parameters are rarely avail- able in medical records, we must use typical data for the examination and period of interest. This is a two-step process: describing the exami-</page><page sequence="6">146 STOVALL ET AL. FIG. 6. Anthropomorphic phantom (6-year-old child) positioned to simulate irradiation of the tonsil. nation in terms of number and anatomic location of views (20, 21) and estimating dose from each examination. Data suitable for both steps have been published for various periods. Organ doses from diagnostic exam- inations can be calculated using published data (22, 23). It should be noted that organ doses from diagnostic examinations have changed dra- matically over the past few decades. Doses have decreased substantially for many examinations due to improved technology; at the same time, however, the use of new high-dose examinations, such as CT scans, has increased. In an epidemiological study, it is essential to use dose estimates for the appropriate period. Doses from diagnostic procedures are subject to greater uncertainty than those from therapeutic exposures. Patient records of diagnostic ex- aminations are likely to be limited to the type of procedure performed and the clinical findings; it is unlikely that documentation of machine parameters will have been included. Furthermore, repeat exposures to improve image quality are common, yet these would not be included in the documentation. For fluoroscopic examinations, the machine "on time" is highly variable but is not included in the documentation. Also, older machines in operating condition are rarely available for use in per- forming measurements. For plain-film radiography, it may be necessary to use machine parameters such as kVp, filter and field (film) size from a few representative records containing this information and to interview staff who are familiar with the institution's older equipment and proce- dures. Uncertainties for diagnostic exposures are more likely to under- estimate the dose, resulting in risk estimates biased on the high side. For all studies, quality scores are assigned to each individual's dose estimates. These scores reflect the type and completeness of documen- tation received and other factors that might introduce uncertainty in the dose estimates. RESULTS Using the methods described above, organ doses have been estimated for numerous epidemiological studies (see</page><page sequence="7">DOSE RECONSTRUCTION FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES 147 A .. . . iiiiiii i il!ii~i!!iii ii~ i?

Radiation Therapy for Tinea Capitis in Childhood From the 1930s through the 1950s, in many countries children were treated with external-beam radiation therapy for tinea capitis (ringworm of the scalp). Epidemiological studies were conducted of populations treated in Israel (24, 25) and New York City (26-28); these are important be- cause they provide estimates of risk at relatively low doses. Special headgear was used to position five fields on the scalp using the Adamson-Kienbock technique (29). Three independent retrospective dosimetry experiments were con- ducted by other investigators using original treatment X- ray machines and headgear to irradiate an anthropomorphic phantom (24, 27, 30). In each experiment, assumptions were made about the following patient data: shape and size of the head, thickness of the skull, and patient position dur- ing treatment. For the study conducted in Israel (see item 2.7 in Table Al), we used the measurements of Schulz and Albert (27) to estimate age-specific radiation doses to the brain and scalp (31) and to the thyroid (32). Although in- dividual treatment plans were not available, highly stan- dardized, well-documented treatments were given in three clinics; these data were adequate to estimate doses for pa- tients treated at those clinics. However, due to the uncer- tainties in the individual dose estimates, a comprehensive evaluation of uncertainties in dosimetry was undertaken, with respect to radiation-induced risks for thyroid tumors. The uncertainties in each element of the dosimetry proce- dure, such as machine calibration, beam quality, patient po- sitioning, and movement of patients during treatment, were assessed. When the data were reanalyzed, taking these do- simetric uncertainties into account, they appeared to have only a minimal effect on the risk estimates (33, 34). Tonsil Irradiation during Childhood and Adolescence Approximately 4,000 patients treated during childhood with external-beam radiation therapy for lymphoid hyper- plasia of the tonsils were evaluated retrospectively to de- termine whether the treatment was associated with subse-</page><page sequence="8">148 STOVALL ET AL. quent development of malignant or benign thyroid nodules, salivary gland tumors, and hyperparathyroidism (35-37). Although the original treatment machine was no longer available, dose measurements were made using a similar but more modern machine with dosimeters placed in an anthropomorphic phantom representing a 6-year-old child (Fig. 6). Approximately 70% of the children had been treat- ed with rectangular fields and the other 30% had been treat- ed with square fields; the records were unclear about ori- entations of the rectangular fields. Therefore, doses were estimated in three ways: long-dimension vertical, short-di- mension vertical, and an average of these two dose esti- mates. Risk estimates based on an average of the two rect- angular fields were similar to estimates based on doses for the 30% of patients treated with square fields (35). Radiation Therapy for Peptic Ulcer A cohort of 3609 patients treated by external-beam ra- diation therapy for peptic ulcer from 1937 through 1965 was evaluated retrospectively for development of subse- quent malignancies and heart disease (38-40). Our mea- surements were made in a male Alderson-Rando phantom using the original treatment machine, which had a special lead rubber shield to reduce the dose to organs adjacent to the stomach. In addition, staff members who treated some of the patients were able to verify phantom setup and pro- vide details of treatment that had not been recorded in the treatment records. The use of the original equipment and participation of treating staff resulted in high-quality dosim- etry estimates for evaluation of malignancies. The estima- tion of cardiac doses, however, was not straightforward, because approximately 5% of the heart was estimated to be in the radiation field and received both scatter and direct radiation, whereas the remainder of the heart received only scatter radiation. The determination of the percentage of the heart in the beam was based on fluoroscopic examination of each patient to verify the location of the beam and ad- jacent organs. Measurements were normalized to each pa- tient's prescribed stomach dose, which was obtained from the individual radiation therapy records, to obtain the vol- ume-weighted mean dose to each patient's heart. The total average cumulative cardiac dose for each patient was ob- tained by summing the volume-average cardiac dose over all treatment courses. Lung Cancer after Radiation Therapy for Hodgkin Lymphoma We evaluated doses to various lung sites for a study of the risk of lung cancer after treatment for Hodgkin lym- phoma (41, 42). This was the first epidemiological study of radiation-induced lung cancer after Hodgkin lymphoma to take into account the dose received at the specific site of the subsequent tumor in the lung. Studies of subsequent cancers in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma can be difficult due to irregularly shaped treatment fields; Fig. 7 shows that the lungs are partially blocked during such treatment. Be- cause blocking attenuates the dose to approximately 10% of that from the primary beam, it was important to know the site of the lung tumor relative to the blocking. Two types of information were required for dosimetry: (1) lo- cation of the chest fields using simulator films and radiation records and (2) location of the lung tumors using diagnostic pathology reports, surgical/bronchoscopy notes, hospital re- cords, and radiological studies, including copies of chest X rays, CT scans, and tomograms. For each case/control set, a radiation oncologist reviewed all the information and de- termined the location of the secondary lung cancer in the case relative to the radiation fields in the case and matched controls (41, 42). Because of the large range of dose to the lungs, it was essential to determine dose to the specific site of the lung tumor; mean dose throughout the lungs would have been inappropriate. Sarcomas after Radiation Therapy for Retinoblastoma Hereditary retinoblastoma is a rare tumor of the eye that usually occurs in children under 2 years old. Survivors are at high risk of developing a subsequent sarcoma of the bones or soft tissue (43). Patients in our study were irra- diated by external-beam radiation therapy (90%), brachy- therapy (1%), or a combination of these techniques (9%). The common external-beam treatments in this cohort were a two-field technique with nasal and lateral fields and a single-field technique with either a lateral or anterior field. Before 1960, orthovoltage X rays were the most common type of external-beam radiation used; after 1960, 22-23 MV photons became the most widely used form of exter- nal-beam radiation. In our study group, tumor doses to the affected eye ranged from 15-115 Gy (average, 48 Gy), with the highest doses delivered from orthovoltage machines. Brachytherapy treatments were delivered by means of eye plaques, which contained radon seeds prior to 1960 and 60Co in later years. Patients were treated with machines fitted with special cones to define the small eye fields. Because many of the sites of interest were near the treated eye in a region of rapid fall-off, out-of-beam measurements of the dose dis- tribution near the cones were made with TLDs and film. The mathematical computer model was used for dosimetry estimates; Fig. 8 shows doses for a typical external-beam treatment of a 2-year-old child. The tumors were located as precisely as possible, based on clinical notes, pathology re- ports, and radiology reports. When there were uncertainties about the location of subsequent tumors, the average of the minimum and maximum estimated doses for sites of inter- est was used. Second Cancers after Radiation Therapy for Cancer of the Uterine Cervix We provided dosimetry for case/control studies of second tumors for patients drawn from a large international cohort</page><page sequence="9">DOSE RECONSTRUCTION FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES 149 Treatment field Salivary Gland Thyroid 1.20 Gy 0.73 Gy * - - Breasts 0.34 Gy Testes 0.12 Gy FIG. 8. Mathematical computer model; doses to selected organs of a 2-year-old patient with retinoblastoma treated to 45 Gy with a 60Co y-ray beam. (44). The radiation therapy was highly standardized ac- cording to stage of cancer, with the majority of patients receiving both external-beam and brachytherapy (19, 44- 46). We estimated dose in three ways: (1) measurement of the dose in an Alderson-Rando phantom, (2) calculation of dose using the computer model described above, and (3) calculation of internal scatter dose from the primary beam using a Monte Carlo calculation. To make the Monte Carlo calculation comparable to the total-dose measurements, we added the contribution from the other components (i.e., head leakage and collimator scatter). Dosimetry values se- lected for the analysis were derived from all three sets of data (19). For the study of subsequent leukemia, the ABM dose was calculated as a weighted average to the ABM using the partitions and weights reported by Cristy (16). The dose to the ABM partitions ranged from 0.001-5.5 Gy (45), which allowed investigators to model the risk of leukemia, taking into account doses that could potentially cause cell killing rather than cell mutation. To validate doses, we conducted an extensive compari- son of organ doses estimated by calculation using the math- ematical computer model and by measurements using TLDs in an Alderson-Rando phantom (19). The anthropomorphic phantom irradiations used the same TLD system that was used for the water phantom measurements. Table 1 lists results of the two methods to estimate dose from anterior and posterior pelvic fields. The methods differ because for each organ there are many more points of calculation in the mathematical computer model than points of measure- ment in the anthropomorphic phantom. Estimates of mean dose to the ovaries, which are in the primary beam, agreed within 17% using both methods. Overall agreement be- tween these two methods was within 20% for most organs, with only the dose to the thyroid gland showing greater discrepancy. This agreement is acceptable from the per- spective of the large range of doses outside a beam, where dose can decrease significantly near the edge of the beam.

Based on the number of examinations performed, the calendar years of examinations, and the patient's age, the breast dose was estimated at a 1.0-cm depth for pre-teens and a 2.5-cm depth for teens, using a software package4 based on organ doses calculated by Rosenstein (22). The examinations spanned several decades and breast doses varied over that period. Medical records documenting the diagnostic ex- aminations of the spine, including machine parameters, were available for only about 25% of the patients. However, because these examinations were standardized, it was pos- sible to make assumptions about irradiation conditions for patients with missing data and to estimate a breast dose for each study subject. The average estimated cumulative breast dose was 0.11 Gy (range, 0-1.70 Gy). DISCUSSION Epidemiological studies of medically irradiated popula- tions contribute an important body of evidence to what is already known about risks for radiation-induced cancers. These studies have significantly increased the capability to reconstruct doses to individual organs that allows detailed dose-response analyses and increases their use as predic- tion mechanisms (3). Several methods used to estimate organ doses during ra- diation treatment or diagnostic examinations have been de- scribed in this paper; each method has advantages and dis- advantages. Despite the unlimited number of points of cal- culation in the mathematical computer model and the avail- ability of all ages, the advantage of the anthropomorphic phantoms is that, because of their human-like contours and densities, they more realistically simulate the scatter and absorption of radiation in patients. If the treatment under study was mainly administered to adults, with a limited range of field sizes, locations and beam energies, the an- thropomorphic phantoms offer an advantage of enhanced realism. Their disadvantages are that they are available only in a limited number of sizes, irradiation is expensive and time consuming, and results of an irradiation are applicable to only one specific set of treatment parameters. In addition, the fixed grid of holes to hold dosimeters allow for only a limited number of measurement points. The advantage of the mathematical computer model is that it allows flexibil- ity in patient size, organ locations, number of points of calculation, and beam orientation. The aim of radiation therapy is to deliver a radiation dose adequate to kill tumor tissue but spare healthy tissue (48). An array of sophisticated imaging and treatment-planning systems is available to achieve that aim with high precision. Realistically, however, that same level of precision cannot be achieved in epidemiological studies that are aimed at retrospectively estimating individual organ doses for a large number of patients. There are two primary sources of uncertainty in dose estimates: (1) Patient information, which includes details abstracted from the patient's record as well as information provided by the institution about equipment and usual treat- ment techniques. This is the largest source of uncertainty and determines the quality of dosimetry data. (2) Methods selected for dose estimation, which include measurements in an anthropomorphic phantom, water phantom measure- ments applied to a mathematical computer model, Monte Carlo calculations, or a combination of these methods. Uncertainties in dosimetry can include misspecification of tumor position with respect to the treatment fields; miss- ing information on the use of shielding, field sizes and ori- entation, and blocking position; and incorrect recording of treatment doses. In most epidemiological studies that esti- mate the risk of late effects due to radiation treatment, it is unlikely that there will be any systematic bias in the esti- mation of dose that could distort the estimation of risk; however, there will be random variation associated with any exposure misclassification. In any study, one should aim to be consistent across a population of patients and produce dose estimates that do not differ systematically between cases and a comparison group. Selection of the best method of dose estimation or best combination of methods involves consideration of the study population, sites of interest, and treatment regimens. Despite unavoidable sources of uncer- tainty, it is possible to estimate radiation doses to organs outside the treatment field that can be used in epidemio- logical studies. In fact, the analysis by Lubin et al. (34) showed that relatively large uncertainties in dose estimates for patients treated for tinea capitis did not have a serious impact on risk estimates. However, the studies of breast and lung tumors after Hodgkin lymphoma required special ef- fort to determine dose to the specific site of the second tumor; this effort was necessary because patients were treated with irregularly shaped blocked fields, which pro- duced doses within the breast and lung that varied by a factor of ten (41, 49). Details concerning a subject's size at time of treatment and the location of internal organs are not usually available many years after treatment delivery. Frequently, the organ of interest with regard to late effects was not imaged or located at the time of treatment. This situation can be prob- lematic, because retrospective dosimetry estimates must then be based on average organ sizes and locations. Un- certainties and errors in placement of field(s) during the original treatment and location of the organ of interest rel- ative to the treatment field are particularly critical to ret- rospective dose estimation when the organ is close to a field edge (&lt;5 cm) because of the rapid fall-off of dose next to the edge of the treatment field (Fig. 2). 4 XRAYDOSE, MHP Software, North Little Rock, AR.</page><page sequence="11">DOSE RECONSTRUCTION FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES 151 TABLE 2 Additional Dosimetry Methods for Epidemiological Studies Condition/site treated Method of dosimetry Reference(s) Tuberculosis (fluoroscopies) Anthropomorphic phantom and Monte Carlo calculation Boice et al.

(69) The relative contributions of the three components to to- tal dose from external-beam treatments, i.e., scatter radia- tion within the patient, head leakage, and collimator scatter, have been reported by a few investigators. Fraass and van de Geijn (50) found that collimator scatter plus leakage is of the same order of magnitude as patient scatter. Kase et al. (51) also indicated that near the beam, the collimator scatter contributes 20-40% of the total peripheral dose and that leakage becomes the main contributor at greater dis- tances from the field edge. Greene et al. (52, 53) found that collimator scatter was the dominant component of the pe- ripheral dose near the treatment beam. Measurements in- dicate that, in general, machines of the same energy show the same proportion of dose due to scatter and head leakage and there is little error caused by using out-of-beam data measured on a single machine to represent other machines of the same energy.5 Van der Giessen (54) verified his calculation method us- ing in vivo measurements on 147 adult patients during 490 treatment sessions. TLDs were placed on the perineum dur- ing treatment of a variety of tumors in the neck, thorax or pelvis, using radiation energies ranging from 60Co to 25 MV photons. The ratios between calculated and measured ranged from 0.76 to 1.02, demonstrating that the calculation method was a practical method for estimating dose to sites of interest outside the primary treatment beam for the pur- pose of estimating risk. Van der Giessen (55) also compared the basic data used in his peripheral dose calculation method with measure- ments reported in 16 publications, including data used in the method reported here, and found the overall agreement to be good. The largest discrepancies were at the highest photon energies. The standard deviation of the published values was reported to be 33% overall. Van der Giessen also investigated peripheral dose of elongated and irregu- larly shaped fields and found good agreement with periph- eral dose for equivalent square fields. Francois and colleagues (56, 57) described a mathemat- ical computer model similar to ours, which is based on measurements in a water phantom. For individual organ doses, their data agree with our data to +?30%, with no systematic differences. In a direct comparison between the phantom used by Frangois and colleagues and our methods and phantoms, differences could be explained by differenc- es in organ locations. Other approaches have been used effectively and incor- porated into epidemiological studies as listed in Table 2. One area in which there is potential for future improve- ment in dose reconstruction is the characterization of sourc- es of uncertainty, as well as total uncertainty, in individual estimated doses. How dosimetric uncertainties affect the shape and magnitude of the dose response is a concern within the epidemiological community (70). Characteriza- tion of uncertainty for medical irradiations is generally sim- pler than for occupational or environmental exposures be- cause the exposures are controlled and there is documen- tation for most treatments or diagnostic examinations. Dosimetry will continue to play an important role in the estimation of cancer risks after medical irradiation. With the introduction of new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, additional cohorts of exposed patients are being identified, and individual organ dose estimates will be needed to ade- quately evaluate the long-term health effects associated with these new techniques. For example, in diagnostic imaging, a recent increase in the use of full-body CT scanning as an early-detection screening method for asymptomatic patients is of concern, especially if the patients are young children who undergo multiple screenings. The cumulative radiation doses from multiple CT scans may increase the risk of can- cer in these patients (71, 72). In therapy, intensity-modulated radiation treatment, which results in increased beam-on time and therefore in more scatter radiation to a larger area of the body, has led to speculation that it may result in a higher frequency of second cancers than occurs after conventional radiation therapy (73-75). The challenge for the future is to identify cohorts of patients and develop dosimetry resources necessary to understand the long-term effects of new diag- nostic and treatment modalities. 5 C. R.
