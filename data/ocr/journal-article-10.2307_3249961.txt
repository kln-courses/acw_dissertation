INTRODUCTION T he set of paintings entitled Three Officials of Heaven, Earth and Water, held by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (hereafter referred to as the Boston scrolls or the Boston set), have intrigued viewers as much as they have puzzled them (figs. I, 2, 3).2 Stylistically, the paintings reveal a high standard of artistic expression that marks them as masterpieces of Song painting.3 Designed as a set, the triptych represents the three realms of the deities of Heaven, Earth, and Water in a hierarchical order and reveals a thematic program. Reflecting a symmetrically organized space that is standard for any Daoist altar, the triptych places Heaven in the center, Earth on the right, and Water on the left.4 I Earlier versions of this paper were presented at the International Conference on Religion and Chinese Society, the Chi- nese University of Hong Kong, May 2ooo; at the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Asian Studies, March 2ooo; and at the New England Conference of the Association for Asian Studies, October 1999. I would like to express my special thanks to the following people: ProfessorJohn Lagerwey of the Ecole frangaise d'Extreme-Orient, the organ- izer of the Hong Kong Conference, who offered critical comments and gave me the opportunity to present my paper at the conference; Professor Lothar Ledderose of Heidelberg University, who acted as my discussant in the conference and shared valuable insights on the paintings; Wu Tung of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, who kindly allowed me to view the three paintings in storage; Professor Valerie Hansen and Professor David Sensabaugh at Yale University, who read the manuscript and offered critical comments; Eric Rasmussen, Larissa Schwartz and Sylvia Price, who read dif- ferent versions of this paper; Professor Wu Hung at Chicago University and Professor Robert Hymes at Columbia Uni- versity, who instructed me in the very early stages of this research, in December 1998. Last but not least, I would like to pay special tribute to two of my mentors: Professor Richard Barnhart at Yale University, and Professor Shih Shou- chien at the National Taiwan University. Their shrewd vision and wisdom have enabled me to complete this article. 2 For the plates, see Wu Tung, Tales from the Land of Dragons: -ooo Years of Chinese Painting (Boston: Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 1997), figs. 21-23; pp. 63-65. 3 Their painterly quality and exquisite detail even suggest a possible relation to Southern Song imperial workshop prac- tice. As Osvald Siren mentioned in his brief remark on the three paintings: "They were formerly attributed to Wu Tao- tzu and are said to have formed part of the imperial collection." See Osvald Siren, Chinese Painting: Leading Masters and Principles (London: Lund, Humphries, I958), vol. 4, p. I5. Stephen Little also suggested: "It would appear from its extraordinary quality that the twelfth-century triptych of hanging scrolls depicting the Taoist Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water (the Sanguan) in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, was also created under imperial auspices." See Stephen Little, Taoism and the Arts of China (Chicago: The Art Institute of Chicago, 2000), p. 22. Some historical paintings commissioned by the Southern Song court around the mid-twelfth and early thirteenth centuries deserve a closer sty- 5</page><page sequence="2">Even though past scholarship has commented on the form and content of the Boston set, it provides little connection between the representational features and the meaning of the art work.5 How can we make our formal observations relate more effectively to the cultural meaning of the studied object ? Although they are labeled as Daoist representations, which of their visual features can be perceived as Daoist ? How were they linked to actual Daoist experiences and ritual practices of the time? How do they overlap and interact with other pictorial representations that are not necessarily Daoist? If we seek to examine the history of Daoist painting, the Boston set provides an ideal place to begin our study. Readers may find the term "Daoist" poorly defined. Indeed, a systematic survey of Daoist art has yet to be established. Because of its indigenous and synthetic nature, most scholars find that Daoism overlaps with popular religion in many ways.6 This is especially true in the case of religious phenom- ena during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, when the Daoist pantheon incorporated many popular deities and a range of new Daoist sects and religious rites took shape.7 This overall situation can best be portrayed by borrowing a metaphor first used by Erik Ziircher, who pictured Buddhism and Daoism as two pyramid-shaped peaks sharing a common mountain base."At the lower level the listic comparison with the Boston set. See, for example, Breaking the Balustrade and Refusing the Seat, in Gugong shuhua tulu (Taipei: National Palace Museum, 1989), vol. 3, pp. 81, 83; and two historical paintings in the Shanghai Museum, in Zhongguo meishu quanji: huihua bian (Beijing: Wenwu chuban she, 1988), vol. 4, figs. 18, 19, pp. 22-25. 4 Hachiya Kuni6, in his book on the investigation of the contemporary Daoist temples in China, offers a rich body of examples concerning how the icons (or tablets) of the Three Officials were set up in the altars. All the examples of the Three Officials demonstrate a coherent order: Heaven in the center, Earth to the right, and Water to the left.

See Anna Seidel, "Chronicle of Taoist Studies in the West 1950-1990," Cahier d'Extreme-Asiae no. 5 (1989-1990), pp. 226-345, especially pp. 283-284; Rolf A.

Gregory eds., Religion andSociety in T'ang andSung China (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1993). 6</page><page sequence="3">bodies of the pyramid merged into a much less differentiated lay religion, and at the very base both systems largely dissolved into a indistinct mass of popular beliefs and practices."8 If we extend Ziircher's insight, "Daoist art" refers to visual materials that came from the peak of Daoism as well as from the iceberg underneath. In the past, scholars approaching the complicated pan- theon of Buddhist and Daoist images were primarily concerned with identifying individual deities. By asking only who the deities were, the researchers limited themselves to linking mechanical deities as described in texts with images.9 Religious images, however, are not produced as immutable types, but involve variations and inventions in a constantly changing context."' Furthermore, artists cannot work without models, or schemata." This is especially true of religious art works after the Song and Yuan periods. Images developed out of the visual tradition in response to the varying context of the cults and, occasionally, of their written texts. As Hans Belting observed in his study of western reli- gious icons before the Renaissance and Reformation, the types and meanings of the religious image migrate and mingle in varying contexts. Because of this interchangeability, the image becomes an inex- haustible source of new inventions, and style becomes an expression of historical change, linking the image to the society that produced it.12 The present study hopes to provide a more flexible reading of Daoist images by taking the notion of iconography, painting practice, and other cultural aspects into consideration. It will document the literary and visual sources of the painted subject, examine the iconographic models and compositional schemes appearing in the Boston set, and relate these motifs to the actual religious and cultural prac- tice of that time. This study will offer new ways of interpreting the depicted pantheon: it will show how these representations document, rather than just reflect, facets of ritual performance in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.'3 8 Erik Ziircher, "Buddhist Influence on Early Taoism: A Survey of Scriptural Evidence," T'oung Pao vol.

THREE OFFICIALS OF HEAVEN, EARTH AND WATER: RELIGION, ART, AND RITUAL PERFORMANCE Defining the Bureaucratic Triad The Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water are personified cosmic forces governing their respective realms. Together, they are known as sanguan, the "Three Officials." Playing a pivotal role in judging the behavior of all beings, the Three Officials have long been esteemed as bureaucratic gods who can bestow happiness, forgive sins, and offer protection.'4 The cult of the Three Officials can be traced back to the second century of the common Era, to the Daoists of the Five Pecks of Rice Sect ("wudou mi jiao"). After the patients had confessed their sins, Daoist masters prescribed their cure in the form of written documents. Called "Documents to the Three Officials" or "sanguan shoushu," one document was placed on a mountain to represent its delivery into heaven, the other was buried in the earth, and another was thrown into water.'5 The number three plays a significant role in Daoist theology. During the fifth century, the Three Officials became associated with another set of abstract trinitarian forces, which had previously existed in Daoism: the Three Primordials or "sanyuan." '6 Now the universe was conceptualized as a tripartite, multi-layered system administered by a huge bureaucratic pantheon. This bureaucratic reorganiza- tion placed the Three Officials on top, governing the spheres of the Upper, Middle, and Lower Primordials respectively, which altogether administered Nine Chambers, One Hundred and Twenty Bureaus, and millions of underlings.'7 Previously associated with documents, the Three Officials came to be thought of as bureaucratic gods who reviewed and kept written records of human behavior. The names of those who had accu- mulated merits were filed in the Green Book [of life] (qing bu), while the names of those who were 14 See Yuanshi tianzun shuo sanguan baohao jing, CT 71, Daozang (Beijing: Wenwu chuban she, 1988), vol. 2, p. 36. The numbering system of the Daoist Canon in this article is based on the serial number of the text as indicated in Kristofer Schipper's Concordance du Tao-tsang (CT), reprinted in Li Diankui ed., K.

See Zhongguo daojiao xiehui yanjiu shi ed., Daojiao shi ziliao (Shang- hai: Shanghai guji chuban she, 1990), p. 68. Rolf A. Stein interpreted these documents as "contracts" with the Three Officials. He further referred to Ofuchi Ninji's argument that "these contracts originated in popular customs of the era." See Rolf A. Stein, "Religious Taoism and Popular Religion from the Second to the Seventh Centuries," p. 73. 16 About the formation of the Three Primordials in Daoism, see Akizuki Kanei, "Sangen shiso no keisei ni tsuite," Tbhh gaku no. 22 (July, 1961), pp. 27-40; Ofuchi Ninji, "D6kyo ni koeru sangen setsu no seisei to tenkai," Tcho shuikya no. 66 (1985), pp. 1-21. In his recent article, Li Fengmao offers a detailed survey of the fast of the Three Primordials ("sanyuan zhai") and explores its relation to the folk festivals from the six dynasties to the Tang dynasty. See Li Feng- mao, "Yansu yu youxi: Daojiao sanyuan zhai yu tangdai jiesu," in Chuantong yu chuangxin (Taipei: Zhongyang yan- jiu yuan zhongguo wenzhe yanjiu suo chobei chu, 1999). 17 For a detailed list of the pantheon, see the fifth-century text Taishan tongxuan lingbao sanyuan pinjie gongde qingzhong jing (The Scripture of the Exalted One of the SacredJewel of Penetrating Mystery on the Prohibitions and Judgement of Merit of the Three Primordials), CT 456, Daozang, vol. 6, pp. 873-885. 8</page><page sequence="5">guilty of severe sins were recorded in the Black Book [of death] (hei bu).'8 On the fifteenth day of the first, seventh, and tenth months of the lunar calendar, the Three Officials each performed their annual review. Certain purifying fasts (called "Fasts of the Three Primordials" or "sanyuan zhai") aiming at self-confession were held during the days of the gods' inspection. As recorded in the sixth-century text Wushan Piyao, a three-stage mud altar imitating the shape of a mountain and symbolizing the three spheres of Heaven, Earth, and Water was used in the service of the fast.'9 Promoted by the Tang imperial house that honored Daoism greatly, the Three Officials were ele- vated to join the ruck of cosmological and astral deities in the state rites. In addition, the Festivals of the Three Primordials, or sanyuan jie, were ordained as official festivals.20o State promotion may have caused the cult of the Three Officials to merge with other religious practices and folkloristic customs. The cult of the Official of Heaven became associated with the traditional lantern festival on the fifteenth day of the first month of the year. In particular, Song writings contain abundant records detailing the festivals and cultural practice of the Three Officials in diverse urban settings. Deemed as an auspicious time to plea for good fortune at the beginning of the year, the Day of the Upper Pri- mordial was celebrated with the traditional lantern festival (yuanxiao) on the fifteenth day of the first month.2- Flaming torches and colorful lanterns decorated the cities during the night, symbolizing the stars that guard and protect the human world. On this day, the Southern Song imperial Temple of Spectacular Numina (Jingling gong) in Hangzhou erected a grand pavilion of lanterns to welcome the descent of the Official of Heaven.22 Special jiao offerings were sponsored by the state, as were purify- ing rituals of the "Enclosure of the Dao" (daochang) constructed in prisons to ward off malign spirits.23 Masquerade parades commissioned by the court showcased dancers and theater singers on the streets. Wearing colorful costumes and masks of various fictional characters, they danced around the city, mimicking the ancient exorcism to drive away misfortune and call for a better year.24 i8 Ibid., p. 883. 19 Wushang Piyao, juan 52, in John Lagerwey, Taoist Ritual in Chinese Society and History, pp. 30-31.

See Meng Yuanlao, Dongjing menghua lu, juan 5, "yuan xiao," in Dongjing menghua lu wai sizhong, p. 35. As Li Fengmao has pointed out, the lantern festival can be traced back to the ancient exorcism parade at the beginning of the year, when masquerade parades with torches were performed in order to ward off the malign spirits residing in the previous year and to welcome a new year. See Li Fengmao, ibid., p. Ioo. 9</page><page sequence="6">The cult of the Official of Earth, and particularly the zhongyuan festival underwent a conspicuous merger with the Buddhist yulanpen ghost festival.25 Throughout the Song dynasty, this festival was observed with stern gravity and richly documented. On this day, worshippers flocked to both Daoist and Buddhist temples, with a common wish to release the ghosts and ancestors for salvation. The grand "pu du" banquets (pu dujiao), hosting all the suffering souls in the universe, were held in Daoist temples, possibly including those which enshrined the Three Officials in the capital Hangzhou.26 On the Buddhist side, yulanpen gatherings were hosted in the Buddhist temples with the zaju drama of "Mulian rescuing his mother from hell" (mulian jiumu) enacted on the stage of the temple theaters.27 In the market place, mortuary cloth, bouquets of flowers and grains were sold for the preparation of ancestor worship. At imperial level, court ladies in the company of guards set off from the palace to visit the imperial tombs. The Minister of Worship ("Ci bu") ordered the "Enclosure of the Dao" (daochang) to be erected, and burnt piles of paper money for those who died in war. Hundreds of lamps were sent down rivers in tribute to the ghosts and deities of the seas."8 It is equally important to note that one of the most popular Daoist rituals held during the Song period, the Purgation Rite of the Yellow Register, or "huanglu zhai," became associated with the Three Officials. According to the late-twelfth century liturgical text Daomen dingzhi, the huanglu zhai ritual was to "support the family and the nation, saving both the living and the dead, releasing the ancestors of seven generations for salvation, and rescuing the souls from hell."29 In particular, the Official of Water was venerated as the major deity who authorized the huanglu zhai rituals during the Tang and Song periods.30 The huanglu zhai ritual was regarded as an efficacious way of exorcising troublesome ghosts and restoring the order of the human world;3' at the same time, Daoist institutions promoted the huanglu zhai ritual as a major source of economic support that offered an alternative to Buddhist Water Land Assemblies (shuilu hui).32 25 For a classic study on the Daoist zhongyuan festival and the Buddhist yulanpen, see Yoshioka Yoshitoyo, Dikyj to bukkyj (Tokyo: Nihon gakujutsu shink6kai, I959), vol. I, pp. 369-411. For the merger of the Three Primordials and the other social practices and folklore customs in the Tang period, see Li Fengmao, ibid., pp. 53-110o. For in-depth research on the Buddhist yulanpen ghost festival, see Stephen Teiser, The Ghost Festival in Medieval China (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1989); Teiser's book also provides a brief survey of the zhongyuan festival as a Daoist parallel of the yulanpen festival in the Tang period, see pp. 35-42. 26 Daoist temples dedicated to the Three Officials in the Southern Song capital Hangzhou included Yuxu guan, Cheng- tian lingying guan (an earlier name of this temple was Tian di shui sanguan tang), Shuifu jinglian guan, etc. See Xianchun lin'an zhi, in Song Yuan fangzhi congkan (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1990), juan 75, PP. 4, 8, Io; Mengliang lu, juan I5, in Dongjing menghua lu wai sizhong, p. 257. 27 Dongfing menghua lu, juan 8, in Dongjing menghua lu wai sizhong, pp. 49-50. 28 The descriptions of the zhongyuan festival in Dongjing menghua lu and Mengliang lu are almost identical; see Meng Yuan- lao, Dongfing menghua lu, in Dongfing menghua lu wai sizhong, pp. 49-50; Wu Zimu, Mengliang lu, juan 4, in Dongfing menghua lu wai sizhong, p.

These paintings showcased an encyclopediac body of gods and saints, demons and goblins, demonstrating an imaginative visual synthesis of Buddhism, Daoism, and folklorist beliefs. According to the early-eleventh century painting catalog, Yizhou minghua lu, the best-known painter who earned his fame in this subject was Zhang Nanben, active in Sichuan in the late ninth cen- tury.34 After Emperor Xizong of the Tang dynasty died in 888 CE, the chief minister of the Chengdu Bureau hired Zhang Nanben to paint a liturgical pantheon enshrined in the Baoli si monastery in honor of the dead emperor. Included in the pantheon were images of the Three Officials, juxtaposed with "Five Emperors, Thunder Sire and Lightning Mother, immortals of hills and rivers, Kings and Emper- ors from the ancient to the present."35 Originating from this mural tradition, individual paintings of the Three Officials were commis- sioned in the late Tang and Five Dynasties (from the late ninth to tenth centuries). Many of them were successfully passed down through the centuries. As recorded in Xuanhe hua pu, edited in the early twelfth century during the reign of the late Northern Song emperor Huizong (r. IIOO-1125), early paintings of the Three Officials occupied a significant proportion in the group of religious paintings. Collected mostly in a set format, the triad of Heaven, Earth, and Water was depicted in three separate scrolls. Famous masters associated with this painted subject were mural artists active in the Shu region (contemporary Sichuan) around the late tenth century, including Du Niqui (ca. tenth century), Zuo Li (Five Dynasties), and Sun Zhiwei (late tenth century to eleventh century).36 to peck the husband. The husband asked a Daoist master for help. After the purgation rite of the Yellow Register, the wife and the son appeared in the husband's dream and told him that because of his fast, both she and her son had been sent to heaven and gained the merits. This story is cited by Mitsumoto K6ichi from the early eleventh-century text Yunji qi qian, juan 120, CT 1032, Daozang, vol. 22, p. 835; see also Matsumoto K6ichi, "Daojiao yu zongjiao liyi," in Zhu Yueli trans., Daojiao (Shanghai: Xinhua shudian, 1990), vol. I, p. 182. 32 As the official records indicate, a prestigious Daoist master in the Southern Song could earn as much as several hun- dred thousand qian by performing a single zhai fasting. See Xu zizhi tong jian, juan 93, "song ji: huizong"; in Daojiao shi ziliao, p. 259.

The imperial Daoist master Du Guanting, who moved with the government to Sichuan around this time, played a significant role in promoting Daoism and the production of Daoist devotional images in the Sichuan region. 34 Huang Xiufu, Yizhou minghua lu (preface dated Ioo6), juan shang, in Lu Fusheng ed., Zhongguo shuhua quan shu (Shanghai: Shanghai shuhua chuban she, 1993), vol.

See Li Jian, Deyutang hua pin, in Lu Fusheng ed., Zhongguo shuhua quan shu, vol. I, p. 993. II</page><page sequence="8">These early paintings of the Three Officials were often attributed to earlier masters. Several paint- ings of the Three Officials reported to be in the Southern Song court collection were listed as works of Wu Daozi, Wu Zongyuan, and Sun Zhiwei.37 As mentioned by a later Qing dynasty source, three scrolls of the Three Officials that were in circulation in fifteenth-century Suzhou region were identified by the famous painter Shen Zhou (1427-1509) as genuine works of the Southern Song court painter Li Song (active ca. II90-I230).38 Though none of these paintings have survived, literary texts describe how sophisticated and rich the pictorial vocabulary of such painted subjects were. In a poem written by the northern literatus Yuan Haowen (1190-1257), the author commented on a set of Three Officials attributed to Zhu Yao active during the late Tang and Five Dynasties, whose paintings of the same subject had once been collected by the Northern Song court.39 Yuan's poem reveals a rich pictorial pantheon of the Three Officials in its colorful narrative details. According to Yuan Haowen, Zhu Yao's paintings were designed in a set of three scrolls, with each Official occupying a single scroll. The Three Officials were all described as "bearing the appearance of a great man" (daren xiang) or "dressed in the cloth of a King" (wangzhefu), accompanied by a group of female attendants, generals, and demon-attendants. Certain pictorial elements were vividly articulated as interesting components to signify a particular realm. For example, the Official of Heaven was shown in a celestial palace with a cassia tree and a full moon shown in the background. The Official of Earth was depicted riding a white horse under a bizarre cliff. A certain grotesque "tree spirit" (shu mei) with a naked body is described as uprooting a tree near the demon-attendants. The Water Official was shown driving a dragon across a stormy sea with his retinue. Water drops pearl over the sea while a record-keeper rides a rhinoceros emerging from a submarine palace.40 36 See Huang Xiufu, Yizhou minghua lu (preface dated Ioo6), in Zhongguo shu hua quanshu, vol. I, pp. 189, 190, 194. As recorded in Xuanhe hua pu, famous masters associated with the subject of the Three Officials include Zhou Fan (Tang dynasty), Zhu Yao (late ninth century), Sun Wei (late Tang), Zhang Suqing (late Tang), Du Nigui (ca. tenth cen- tury), Zuo Li (ca. tenth century), Lu Huang (ca. tenth century), and Sun Zhiwei (late tenth century to early eleventh century). See Xuanhe huapu, juan 2, juan 3, in Lu Fushen ed., Zhongguo shuhua quanshu, vol. 2, pp. 67-72, 78. 37 See Yang Wangxui, Song Zhongxing guange chucan tuhua ji (1199), in Huashi congshu (Taipei: Wenshizhe, 1974). 38 As recorded in Nansong yuanhua lu: "Somebody sent three scrolls depicting images of the Three Officials to the framer Sun for sale. At the bottom of each scroll, there is a big square seal that reads 'Zao Disun from Suzhou'. The owner of the paintings once presented these scrolls to Shen Zhou to seek his advice. Shen Zhou said, 'These paintings were painted by Li Song. Zao [Disun] is the person who once collected the paintings."' See Li E ed., Nansong yuanhua lu, in Huashi congshu (Taipei: Wenshizhe, 1974), vol. 3, P. 1710. A painting depicting the excursion of the Three Officials, now in the National Palace Museum, Taipei, is attributed to the thirteenth-century court painter Ma Lin. While the painting is clearly a later work, its linkage with the Southern Song court master suggests that the Three Officials were once a popular subject painted by Southern Song court painters.

Many of them were recorded as sacred images (shengxiang) displayed in religious or liturgical contexts. A diagram recorded in the thirteenth- century Daoist liturgy manual Lingbao lingjiao ji du jin shu (The Golden Script on Salvation Based on the Teachings Conveyed by the Lingbao Tradition) shows how the painted images of various divinities were hung on three walls outside the altar (fig. 4).4' As indicated by the text accompanying the diagram, the images (xiang) of the Three Officials were hung together with other cosmic and natural divinities on the west and east walls. They represented deities in the second tier of the Daoist pantheon.42 As labeled in the diagram, the noblest gods on the north wall included the Three Pure Ones (Sangqing), the Heavenly Emperor (Tianghuang), and the North, South, and East Poles (Beiji, Nanji, Dongji). Symmetrical displays of twelve groups of deities were placed on the west and east walls, with six groups on each side. On the east wall, there were Nine Heavens (Jiutian), Six Planets (Liuyao), North Dipper (Beidou), Three Chancelleries (Sansheng), Three Officials (Sanguan), and Five Peaks (Wuyue). On the west wall, there were Five Seniors (Wulao), Five Stars (Wuxing), South Dipper (Nandou), Heavenly Officers (Tiancao), Four Saints (Sisheng), and Two Bureaus (Erfu). Together, these divinities framed a sacred enclosure dedicated to the ritual. In general, the Three Officials were often juxtaposed with astral and cosmological deities during ritual occasions because they shared some common powers: bringing luck, providing protection, and warding off misfortune.43 As recorded in the official history of the Song dynasty, during the reign of the emperor Huizong, the Temple of the Central Great One (zhong taiyi gong) in Kaifeng enshrined a cosmological pantheon very similar to that presented in fig. 4. The Three Officials were worshiped alongside other astral deities of the sun and the moon, including those of the Five Stars, Twenty-eight Lodgings, Five Elements, Nine Palaces, and so on.44 41 Lin Weifu (1239-1303) ed., Lingbao lingjiao ji du fin shu, juan I, CT 466, Daozang, vol. 7, pp. 27-28. 42 More research is needed to determine the significance of the pairing of the gods. As noticed by Professor John Lager- wey, the corresponding deities of the Three Officials as shown in this diagram are Four Saints. "In a modern ritual, the Four Saints are linked to Mt. Wudang and are on the outer altar across from Mt. Longhu, which means that the Three Officials are here in a position comparable to that of Mt. Longhu, which may or may not be accidental but is certainly intriguing given the Heavenly Master origins of the Three Officials." Quoted from personal correspondence with John Lagerwey, April 2000. 43 According to the pre-Tang scripture Taishang taixuan nuqing sanyuan pingjie bazui miaojing, whenever the nation encounters misfortunes caused by flood, drought, or wars, banners bearing the images of the Three Officials, Five Stars, and Twenty-eight lodgings shall be hung in the "Enclosure of the Dao" (daochang) to perform the jiao offerings. See Taishang taixuan nuqing sanyuan pingfie bazui miaojing, CT 36, Daozang, vol. I, p. 845. 44 Tuo Tuo, Song Shi (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1977), zhi 56, li 6, p. 2509. In general, the astral deities and the Three Officials were grouped together during many ritual occasions because they all take charge of fortune and misfortune. The modern jiao offerings usually include the recitation of the scriptures of the North Dipper, Three Officials, and the penitential litanies to other astral deities. In the Song government painting collection, we observe many recorded paintings of diverse astral deities done by famous Song and pre-Song artists, such as Zhou Fan (ca. latter half of the eighth century to early ninth century), Zhu Yao, Sun Zhiwei (ca. tenth century), Zhou Wenju (ca. tenth century), Wang Qihan (ca. tenth century), Wu Dongqing, Wu Zongyuan (ca. eleventh century), Li Gonglin, Han Qiu, etc. It is very possible that many of these paintings might have been used in and replicated for rituals at court. See Xuanhe huapu (early twelfth century), juan I-juan 4, in Lu Fusheng ed., Zhongguo shuhua quanshu, vol. 2, pp. 60o-75. 13</page><page sequence="10">According to the liturgical codes sanctioned by the Song government, the Northern Song court commissioned Daoist masters to set up the "Enclosure of the Dao" of Lingbao Daoism (Lingbao daochang) for three days and nights in the Temple of the Great One (Taiyi gong) during the festivals in honor of the Three Officials.45 The Lingbao daochang might have closely resembled fig. 4, a ritual enclosure recorded in the thirteenth century liturgy manual of Lingbao Daoism. After the fall of the Northern Song, an imperial temple dedicated to the Great One (Dong Taiyi Gong) with similar pictorial programs was reconstructed in the Southern Song capital Hangzhou in 1148 under the imperial order of the emperor Gaozong (1127-1162), whose calligraphy was put on the wooden tablets of the temple. The corridors were decorated with 195 painted cosmological deities drawn from the Northern Song repertoire.46 Based on the ritual sources mentioned above, it is possible that those numerous Daoist paintings collected in the Song court were created and preserved primarily for ritual occasions. According to Xuanhe hua pu, the paintings of the Three Officials were collected among other astral paintings of the Five Stars (wuxing), Twenty-eight Lodgings (Ershiba su), North Dipper (Beidou), South Dipper (Nandou), Sun (Taiyang), Moon (Taiyin), "Tianpeng," "Jidu," and "Luoho," most of them dated to the tenth and eleventh centuries. They comprised a large percentage of the imperial painting collection, and might sometimes have been displayed on ritual occasions, just as indicated in fig. 4. Another diagram recorded in Lingbao lingjiaoji dujin shu reveals that the painted image (or images) of the Three Officials were hung in one of the altar screens (mu) flanking the main altar (fig. 5). The instructions read: In front of the [main] altar, set screens on the right and left walls. For fasts held on ordinary occa- sions, only two altar screens are necessary: the screen for the Six Masters on the left; and the screen for the Three Officials on the right. For the Purgation Rite of the Yellow Register, six altar screens are required: screens for the Dark Master, Heavenly Master, and Master of the Ritual Inspector on the left; and screens for Five Emperors, Three Officials, and Three Masters on the right. Each screen should be framed with banners on three sides, [so that the sacred images can be hung in the center of the screen], with fragrant flowers, lamps, and candles as the offerings.47 45 Song huiyao jigao bubian, "Taiyi gong"; see Wang Shengduo, "Songchao yu daojiao," in Guoji songdai wenhua yanjiu daolunhui lunwenji (Chengdu: Wenwu chuban she, 1991), p. 225. 46 Qian Yueyou, Xianchun Lin'an zhi (preface dated 1268), juan 13, p. I; Wu Zimu, Mengliang lu (1274), juan 14, pp. 196-197. 47 Lin Weifu (1239-1303) ed., Lingbao ling/iao ji du jin shu, juan I, CT 466, Daozang, vol. 7, p. 28. The six altar screens used during the Purgation Rite of the Yellow Register (huanglu zhai) were identical to those mentioned in another thirteenth-century Daoist liturgy manual, Wushang huanglu da zhai ii zheng yi. It suggests that these screens were standard in Song and Yuan rituals. See Jiang Shuyu (1156-1217), Wushang huanglu dazhai lizheng yi, juan 37, CT 5o8, Daozang, vol. 9, p. 595. 14</page><page sequence="11">It is important to note that the images hung on the altar screens represent judicial authorities sum- moned by the Daoist Master to inspect the ritual on the spot. After having burnt the memorials to initiate the ritual, the Daoist master read liturgical eulogies in front of each altar screen to invite the supernatural agent to participate in the ritual.48 The painted images therefore provide a visual pres- ence of the invisible power: they are visual aids for the Daoist master to invoke the gods. The liturgical eulogies dedicated to the Three Officials possess a striking common feature: they all use similar phrasing to describe a summoned god descending. For example, "The Eulogy to the Official of Heaven" (qing tianguan song) reads, "The Official of Heaven rides the jeweled chariot. With a colorful entourage, he descends to the mundane banquet."49 "The Eulogy to the Official of Earth" (qing diguan song) reads, "Descend, Official of Earth! Flags and banners are full with the five-cloud- chariot."50 Finally, "The Eulogy to the Official of Water" (qing shuiguang song) reads, "The Official of Water rides the dragon to descend. The colorful clouds stir the waves on the sea."r~ Because the Officials of Heaven and Earth drive chariots, and the Official of Water rides a dragon, the Three Officials are supernatural forces of great vitality. The eulogies to the Three Officials, like the liturgical eulogies to the myriad gods of Daoism in general, carry such a distinct message of conceptualizing deities and divine spirits in dynamic mobility. It is as if the gods' ability to move among different spheres determined their efficacy and power. The liturgical texts discussed above provide some sense of the ritual context within which con- temporary viewers might have seen the images of the Three Officials. The Daoist images were, then, not merely religious icons to be worshipped, but also the virtual representation of gods who descend from the supernatural world to participate in the ritual. 3. THE FIRST PAINTING: HEAVEN, ENCOUNTERING THE GOD IN THE VOID The Daoist Official of Heaven portrays the Daoist heaven as sensuous and fluid (fig. I). The celestial choreography is placed diagonally on a sea of clouds graphically stretching on the picture plane. An officer holding a tablet is kneeling in front of the Official of Heaven. He may be submitting a report delivered by the emissary who has just arrived in the lower right corner. The lord's mysterious hand gesture with his left hand leaning on the table and a single finger pointing to the officer suggests some type of communication, perhaps an order to his subordinate. 48 Jiang Shuyu, ibid., p. 591. 49 Jiang Shuyu, ibid., p. 586. 50o Jiang Shuyu, ibid., p. 586. 51 Jiang Shuyu, ibid., p. 586. I5</page><page sequence="12">Daoist Elements Some elements in the painting reveal its uniquely Daoist nature. First, positioning the deities in a procession has its roots in the early pictorial tradition related to the Daoist theme "chao yuan," or "Pilgrimage to the Primordial." 52 A monumental handscroll entitled Procession of Immortals Paying Homage to the Primordial, which is associated with the professional style of the early eleventh century court painter Wu Zongyuan (fig. 6), represents the pictorial prototype of the "chao yuan" convention that the artist of the Boston scroll might have used. Because of its monochrome nature and spontaneous linear expression, scholars believe that the painting functions as a copy or reduced design of a larger work of art - usually executed on walls.53 Though its horizontal format is different from the Boston picture, the juxtaposition of the flying draperies in a fluent and parallel manner is very similar.54 In addition to the Daoist procession, the pictorial symbol shown in each fan may also be consid- ered a Daoist trademark (fig. 7). This Daoist symbol consists of the celestial dwelling of the highest pantheon, the Three Pure Ones ("san qing"), which is located on top of the Jade Capital Mountain ("yu jing shan"). It is fashioned in the style of a wide and flat basin at the top and a narrow rocky pillar at the bottom. It is a symbol of the land of immortality that had been created in ancient times.55 The two circles at both sides of the mountain symbolize the dual forces of yin and yang in the universe. This type of fan motif with a celestial paradise atop the sacred pillar to heaven appears quite frequently in Daoist imagery, as seen in the Southern Song professional drawing album from the Junkunc Collec- tion (fig. 8, hereafter referred to as the Junkunc album).56 Mounted as a circular picture in the center of a fan, its design resembles the illustrative images often seen in Daoist manuals, such as this drawing from the well-illustrated text,Jinyi huan dan yinzhen tu (Illustrated Progress to the Golden Fluid and Reverted Cinnabar), illustrated and recounted by the Daoist master Long Meizi with his preface in 1218 (fig. 9). In the drawing we see a visualization of the Daoist paradise accompanying the text.57 This picture was also composed within a circle. From a Daoist perspective, the circle, symbolizing perfec- tion and genesis, is often used as a framing device in pictures of meditation instructions.S8 52 For the iconography and religious significance of the Daoist pictures of the Pilgrimage to the Primordial (or Chao yuan tu), see Hsieh Shih-wei, "Daojiao Chaoyuan tu zhi tuxiang ji zongjiao yihan," M.A. thesis, Chinese Cultural Univer- sity, Taiwan, 1994. 53 Xu Banda, "Cong bihua fuben xiaoyang shuo dao liang juan songhua - Chaoyuan xianzhang tu," in Wenwu cankao ziliao no. 2 (1956), pp. 57-58; James Cahill, The Painter's Practice (New York: Columbia University Press, 1994), PP. 93-94. 54 Suzuki Kei regards the Boston paintings as the legacy of the Wu Zhongyuan style in the Southern Song period. See Suzuki Kei, Chfzgoku kaigashi chfZ no ichi, p. 200. 55 This motif is often identified as the image of Mount Kunlun. For research on the pictorial representation of Mount Kunlun in early China, see Wu Hung, The Wu Liang Shrine (Stanford: Stanford University, 1989), pp. 117-126; for a provocative discussion of this mountain motif as illustrated in the Daoist Canon, see Judith Boltz, "Soaring on High as the Embodiment of Mount Kunlun," paper presented at the Conference on Mountains and Cultures of Landscape in China: Tang Dynasty, Five Dynasties Period, Song Dynasty, at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, 1993. 56 For a plate, see Tang Wu Daozi Mobao (Taipei: Zhonghua shuhua chubanshe, 1979), p. 3. The fourteenth-century murals in the Daoist Yongle Gong temple illustrate almost the same Daoist symbols of paradise in the design of the fans. See Yongle gong bihua (Beijing: Zhongguo weiwen chuban she, 1981), fig. 44. 57 This text contains twenty chapters, with some colophons and prefaces dated to 1218, 1234, and 1249. The text focuses on the practice of Inner Alchemy (neidan), and belongs to the southern tradition of Song-dynasty inner alchemy in 16</page><page sequence="13">In the Name of the Daoist Talisman The deliberately winding shape of the clouds in the Daoist Official of Heaven demonstrates an unusual graphic feature (fig. 10).59 It seems to mimic the form ofa Daoist talisman (fig. II). The examples drawn here are selected from Daofa huiyuan (A Corpus of Taoist Ritual), an enormous fourteenth-century collection of Daoist talismans and diagrams of the Song and Yuan periods. Each talisman comes with a title or a short literary description of its specific function. The four talismans selected here bear the following titles: (I) True Talisman to Ward Off the Misfortunes in Destiny (or benming jie e zhen fu); (2) Talisman of the Upper Primordial (or shang jie fu); (3) Talisman for Summoning the Messengers of the Three Primordials (or chao sanyuan shizhe fu); (4) Talisman to Summon (or chao fu).6o In these talismans, we observe a common graphic grammar. The rhythmically twisted, curving lines move symmetrically and repetitively, but end with a calligraphically turning stroke at the bottom of the talismans. Though difficult to decode, these talismans were variations of the so-called Cloud Script, or "yun zhuan," which imitates the natural forms of clouds and constitutes a large proportion of Daoist diagrams and graphic calligraphy.6' Indeed, the graphic configuration of the clouds in the Boston scroll resembles a talisman. Because talisman-like clouds occupy almost the whole picture plane in the Boston scroll, the painting itself looks like a talisman. Why make a painting in the form of a talisman ? Based on the titles or texts accom- panying the talismans, we know that these talismans were used to summon spiritual forces. The spiral or vortex lines constituting the talismans can thus be perceived as symbols of cosmic energy.62 the environment ofBai Yuchan (fl. 1194-1229).

The clouds depicted in the Boston scroll indicate a deliberate graphic effect. For a plate, see Buddhist Images of East Asia (Nara: Nara National Museum, 1996), pl. 149, p. 146. 60o These talismans are re-ordered by this author for illustrative purposes and are shown in a different order from that printed in the Daoist Canon. All of the four talismans belong to Qingwei Daoism. I would like to thank Li Yuanguo in Sichuan Academy of Social Science and Barend ter Haar at Leiden University, for their suggestions to investigate these original materials.

The arrangement of two groups of tapering clouds coming to meet each other from opposite directions highlights a dramatic encounter with the gods in the air. As seen in the picture, the one carrying the heavenly court is descending from above, while the one carrying the messenger is ascending from below. The Daoist Heaven is perceived as fluid and dynamic. The celestial gods are descending to receive the reports submitted by their officers. One can also view the scene from an alternative angle as simply the messenger ascending to Heaven. As seen in the center of the painting, an officer holding a tablet is kneeling before the Official of Heaven. He may be submitting a memorial delivered by the emissary who appears in the lower right corner. Ascending to Heaven in Daoist Ritual It is interesting to note that there is a visual connection between the Boston painting and the ritual performance. This officer reporting to the deity of Heaven and the emissary remind us of the visuali- zation journey experienced by a Daoist master at the beginning of the ritual to petition for the gods' permission. Accompanied by the illusionary troops, the Daoist master envisions himself ascending to Heaven to submit the memorial to the god. The Tang dynasty Buddhist monk Fa Lin vividly docu- mented this practice: "First [the Daoist practitioner] submits the memorial by calling out the gener- als, officers, and soldiers residing in his body. The Daoist masters and other people all hold tablets in their hands, calling themselves the officers of the gods (xiang shen sheng chen)."65 In fact, what Fa Lin mentioned was the so-called "Lighting the Incense Burner" (fa lu) and "Call- ing Out the Officers" (chu guan) rites held at the beginning of the ritual before the rite of "Sending the Memorial" (zou zhang orfa biao). It is a meditating performance through which a Daoist empties the 63 Li Yuanguo, "Daojiao fulu de qiyuan yu yanbian," in Chen Yaoting ed., Daojiao yili, pp. 62-69; Li Yuanguo, "Fulu de gongyong yu yuanli," ibid., pp. 119-147. 64 This tradition was later adopted and transmitted into the ritual "Throwing the Dragon Tablet" (toulong jian) prac- ticed by Lingbao Daoists. See Matsumoto K6ichi, "Daojiao yu zongjiao yili," in Zhu Yueli trans., Daojiao, vol. I, p. 181. For an interesting and advanced discussion on the early talismans and charts (fu) used by the Daoists as contracts between Heaven and the human, see Anna Seidel, "Imperial Treasures and Taoist Sacraments - Daoist Roots in the Apocrypha," in Michel Strickmann ed., Tantric and Buddhist Studies in Honor ofR. A. Stein (Melanges chinois et boud- dhiques 21, 1983), vol. 2, pp. 291-371; especially pp. 308-323. Stephen Little introduces a very precious archaeologi- cal object found in Mount Song in 1982, a golden tablet commissioned by the Empress Wu Zetian (r. 690-705) of the Tang dynasty for the ritual "Throwing the Tablet" (toujian). This tablet "is essentially an official communication from Empress Wu's terrestrial representative, the Taoist priest Hu Chao, to the celestial bureaucracy and the netherworldly Nine Departments of the nine hells, which are governed by the Three Officials." See Stephen Little, Taoism and the Arts of China, p. 21. 65 Fa Lin, Bian zhen lun, in Matsumoto K6ichi, "Daojiao han zongjiao liyi," in Zhu Yueli trans., Daojiao, vol.

Come out, each one of you, dressed nobly in ceremonial costume, and stand before the sacred officer, Earth God of this very place, to tell him that I am here burning incense so that I may go up onto the altar and practice the Dao for such and such a community. [...] And may the cosmic energies of life descend and spread through my body, so that my sincere intentions may be communicated rapidly before the throne of the Jade Emperor of the Golden Gate in the vast heavens! "67 Conceiving the human body as an extra replica of the cosmos, active practitioners believe that there are gods residing in each organ of the body. The Daost visualization can be discerned in some of the illustrations accompanying the meditation manuals (fig. 12). This chart, entitled Refinement of Energy and Perfection of Spirit (lian qi chen shen chaoyuan jue tu), is an illustration from a series of pictures pre- served in the text Xiuzhen taiji hunyuan zhixuan tu, which is associated with the practice of Inner Alchemy (nei dan). The abstract spirit (shen) is configured as an anthropomorphic "deity" (the same Chinese character shen) residing in the five organs of a human body: heart, lung, spleen, kidneys, and liver. Here each resident god is portrayed as a male figure clad in official robes and holding a tablet.68 66 Michael Saso, The Teaching of Master Chuang (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1978), p. 219. 67 This formula is taken from Lingbao wulian duren shangpin miao jing (Wondrous Scripture of Supreme Rank on the Infinite Salvation of Lingbao, CT I) compiled during the reign of the emperor Huizong around 1112. The English translation is based on Kristofer Schipper, Taoist Body, trans. Karen C. Duval, p. 97. Very similar texts were found in some other medieval Daoist writings, such asJiang Shuyu (1156-I217), Wushang huanglu zhaiyi, juan 31, CT 50o8, Daozang, vol. 9, p. 567; Lin Weifu ed., Lingbao lingfiao jindu jin shu, juan 9, CT 466, Daozang, vol. 7, pp. 82-83. 68 See Xiuzhen taiji hunyuan zhixuan tu, CT 150, Daozang, vol. 3, p. 101. Though the text does not provide a specific date, its content is close to two Song texts, Xiuzhen taiji hunyuan tu, CT 149, andJinyi huandan yizheng tu (preface dated 1218), CT 151.

I9</page><page sequence="16">Only by concentrating one's mind, meditating and breathing (cun xiang) can one visualize the res- ident deities. Illustrations that help the adepts in achieving this visualization are juxtaposed along- side the texts of the meditation manuals. For example, in the pre-Tang meditation scripture, Shangqing datong zhen jing, pictures are accompanied with literary descriptions of breathing methods and spells. It is advised that by visualizing the images as shown in the manual, following the instructions of the breathing methods and reading the spells, the practitioner can finally communicate with the divine realm.69 As shown in one illustration (fig. 13), a group of guardians (li shi) are called out from one's body during the meditation practice. They are visualized as tiny figures floating on a cloud mass emanating from one's head.70 The Daoist adept may practice such meditative visualization privately in a meditation chamber, or on ritual occasions. In the case of the rite of "Calling Out the Officers," the Daoist master calls out his resident spirits at the beginning of a Daoist ritual sequence. After invoking the inner pantheon, a Daoist master is ready to ascend to heaven and send a memorial inviting the gods. As stated in many liturgical books, the Daoist master calls himself the "officer" (chen) whenever he encounters deities in the sacred realm. A Ming dynasty woodblock print taken from the illustration of theJade Pivot Canon (Yu shu jing) is shown here as a pictorial reference (fig. 14). While the performance of the jiao ritual continues in the temple area, the meditating Daoist master ascends to the heavens to pay homage to the heavenly deities.71 Dressed like an immortal deity and holding a tablet in his hands, the Daoist master becomes an officer of the gods. The officer reporting to the Official of Heaven in the Boston scroll might show the visualization journey of the Daoist master at the beginning of the ritual. Accompanied by the messenger standing some distance away, he ascends to Heaven to submit a report from the human world. 4. THE SECOND PAINTING: EARTH, INSPECTING THE EVIL SPIRITS When we shift our gaze from the first to the second painting, we move from the upper realm to the middle sphere of the cosmos: the earthly terrain (fig. 2). Positioned in a typical Southern Song land- scape, with trees and rocks arranged diagonally at one side of the picture plane, the Official of Earth, searching in his realm, whips his horse as he rides through a stream toward a bridge. The presence of several demon-attendants and a falcon highlights the challenge of the journey. In the foreground, perhaps across the bridge, another group, showcasing the grotesque and fanciful, enters the stage. A fierce-looking officer holding files of judgment leads the team. Behind him, an ape and a tree creature are taken into custody; reluctantly, they are pulled on a rope to the lord across the bridge. 69 See Liu Zhongyu, Daojiao de neimi shijie (Taipei: Wenjin chuban she, 1997), PP. 137-138. 70 See Shangqing dadong zhen fing, CT 6, Daozang, vol.

Similarly to Zhu Yao's compositional scheme, the Boston scroll also portrays the deity as a kingly horseman under a cliff, flanked by his entourage.72 Clearly the pictorial stereotype has been transmitted in the professional practice by use of drawing models, or "fen ben." As Richard Barnhart rightly suggests in his discussion of the second scroll of the Boston set, many techniques in this picture, such as "the drawing, the brushwork, color application, compositional design," reflect "the necessary mechanical processes by which the image was formed."73 A very similar typological example illustrating an excursion of a Daoist king, is preserved in the Junkunc album (fig. I5).74 The regal figure riding the horse shares a similar posture with the Boston Official of Earth, turning his head to review his retinue. The Junkunc album includes fifty pages of such linear drawings on miscellaneous religious subjects. Transmitted under the name of the Tang master Wu Daozi, the Junkunc album appears to be a Southern Song workshop product executed by different hands. Performing a similar function as that of Wu Zongyuan's handscroll noted in the fore- going discussion, it serves either as one of the "preparatory studies for handscroll paintings" or "fen ben preserving the designs of some earlier works.'"75 The Boston scroll also absorbs the pictorial convention of the historical theme featuring the royal excursion, or "chu xun." The basic repertoire of this pictorial formula includes an important officer with a retinue of guards and heralds. A Southern Song historical painting in the Shanghai Museum places the royal outing of the emperor and his retinue in a similar landscape setting (fig. 16).76 Two canopies guarding the royal figures closely resemble the canopy style of the Earth Official. Even the position of the guardian holding the canopy in both scrolls seems to derive from the same pictorial convention, or perhaps even the same workshop tradition. Picturing the Demons In the foreground is a fantastic pictorial combination of the modes of demon-queller and demons (fig. 17). The image of the grotesque-looking bureaucrat in official robe and boots is often associated with the prototype of the demon-queller Zhong Kui.77 A handscroll entitled Zhong Kui's Excursion (Zhongshan yieyou tu) by Gong Kai (1222-1307), who lived in Hangzhou through the Mongol invasion 72 See Chen Gaohua, Sui tang huajia shiliao, p. 404. 73 Richard Barnhart, "Buddhist and Daoist Images," in Richard Barnhart et al., Three Thousand Years of Chinese Paint- ing, p. Io6. For further studies of workshop practice evident in religious painting practice, see Lothar Ledderose's research on the Ten Kings of Hell. Lothar Ledderose, "The Bureaucracy of Hell," in Ten Thousand Things: Module and Mass Production in Chinese Art (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2000), pp. 163-185. 74 This leaf, marked no. 4 in the Junkunc album, was published in James Cahill, The Painter's Practice (New York: Columbia University Press, 1994), fig. 3.24, p. 96.

Zhong Kui is depicted as a commander-in-chief, wearing an official's cap and boots, guarded and followed by demon-attendants, who assist him in quelling the little ghosts they have taken into custody and hung on poles.78 In addition to the demon-queller, humorous renditions of the demoniac figures appear at the corner of the Boston scroll: the ape and the tree monster signal two forms of evil spirits that disturb human beings on earth (fig. 19). The naturalistic rendering of the physique of the ape is fully demon- strated by the tension of its stretched arms and legs - a gesture indicating its resistance to being pulled. According to Wu Hung, the legend of the demonic ape living in the mountains and abducting women has existed in Sichuan since the Han dynasty. The popular motif, "archer shooting an ape-demon," often appears in early funeral art as a symbol to ward off evil and protect the hun-soul on its way to the world of the deceased.79 The demonic ape of Han art was later integrated into another legendary subject of popular art - a group of narrative pictures, entitled Searching for Demons in Mountains, or Sou shan tu. These pictures illustrate the story of the local Sichuan deity, Erlang, quelling the moun- tain demons and spirits. As the Erlang cult spread throughout China during the Song dynasty, pictures of Erlang quelling demons became popular and were often painted on temple murals or in narrative scrolls.8o In drama performance, the story of Erlang also became a popular theme in the Southern Song period.8I The Junkunc album contains a sequence of ten leaves detailing this narrative (leaves nos. 41-5O).82 In leaves nos. 41, 42, 44, 45, different forms of ape spirits are shown captive among other animal spir- its in the mountains. In leaf no. 45 (fig. zo), particularly, a baby ape is pulled on a pole by a demon attendant who serves the deity Erlang on the left. On the right, an ape spirit dressed in feminine attire stands beside a goat spirit. Another ape cringes in terror behind the ape spirit. A counterpart to the ape spirit, the tree monster must be one of the most fantastic aberrant gob- lins ever invented in the Chinese imagery of the grotesque (fig. 19). It wears a skirt made of weeds and raises its arms, stunned by the arrest. Its monstrous features are vividly articulated by the trunk-like horns growing out of its head and the two extra eyeballs protruding from its chest. Here we encounter an interesting category of imagery that has not been fully studied in Chinese painting: the demons, spirits, monsters, goblins, devils, ghosts - in sum, whatever the Chinese referred to by the generic name "gui." Unlike the generic name of "shen," meaning "god," the imagery of"gui" 78 For a complete plate, see Thomas Lawton, Chinese Figure Painting (Washington D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, 1973), fig. 35, PP. 142-143. 79 Wu Hung, "Pictorial Representations of Ape Tales," T'oung Pao no. 73 (1987), PP. 86-113. 8o Many scholars have contributed to the study of this narrative subject. For more information, see Wu Hung, ibid., footnotes 56, 57, pp. io8-1o9; Kohara Hironobu, "'Sou shan tu'," Kokka no. 1144 (1991), PP. 7-21. 81 Two dramas bearing the titles associated with Erlang, Erlang xizhou and Erlang shen bian Erlang shen, were listed in the performing repertoire recorded in the thirteenth-century text, Wulin jiushi. See Wulin jiushi (thirteenth century), juan Io, in Dongfing menghua lu wai si zhong, pp. 50o9, 511. 82 For plates, see Tang Wu Daozi mobao, pp. 41-50. Wu Hung discussed leaf no. 41 in his article. See Wu Hung, "Pic- torial Representations of Ape Tales," p. io8. 38</page><page sequence="35">often has negative connotations of destruction, decline, and death.83 In the pictorial tradition, "gui are represented as ugly, evil, strange, and eccentric. An anecdote concerning Sun Zhiwei (late tenth to early eleventh century), a specialist in religious painting, recounts that he once consulted a witch to be able to paint the imagery of "gui." The witch summoned Wang Sanlan from the underworld to reveal what he had seen in the ghostly realm. In distinguishing the gods from the demons and spirits, Wang Sanlan claimed, "those who belong to the demons in the wild (wang liang) are ugly, evil, strange, and eccentric. The images of the gods are as noble as the officers in the human world."84 In ancient mythology, the tree monster has been referred to as the "one-hundred-year-old tree monster" (bai sui mu zhijing), the "monster of trees and rocks" (mu shi zhi guei), and "mountain spirit" (shan jing).85 Residing in the wild mountains, tree monsters were perceived as hybrid creatures bear- ing physical forms similar to humans. In a later handscroll depicting the Buddhist narrative theme of "the Mother of Demons" (gui zi mu) (fig. 21), a procession of spirits are depicted as walking tree trunks.86 As mentioned earlier, Yuan Haowen (1190-1257) described Zhu Yao's picture of the Earth Official as showing a certain "tree spirit" (shu mei) with a naked body.87 Besides the Boston scroll, we find an alternative combination of the ape and tree spirits in theJunkunc album (fig. 22).88 In leaf no. 40, which is a scene of an underground court, the ape spirit and tree monsters are shown as prisoners receiving the lord's judgment. In the lower left corner of the picture, a Zhong-Kui-like jailer stands fiercely, watching a demon-attendant subjugating a female creature with a simian face. In the lower right cor- ner, two tree monsters pursued by a demon-attendant stand terrified. Having anthropomorphic forms like the tree monster in the Boston scroll, these tree monsters also wear leaves around their waists. Unbearable to look at, their faces are distorted and their bodies shabby and disgusting. Standing right beside the tree monsters is a fine lady wearing flowers on her head who is accom- panied by three babies with leaves on top of their heads. Judging from their botanic attributes, they might represent certain natural fairies. Indeed, the assembly of botanical spirits seems to constitute another group of imagery popular in the Water Land paintings (shuilu hua) used for the ghost-feed- ing ceremony. As pointed out by Caroline Gyss-Vermand, the whimsical appearance of nature spirits depicted in a fantastic scroll from an imperial set of Water Land paintings dated 1454 in the collection 83 For the distinction between the gods and the ghosts, see Arthur P. Wolf, "Gods, Ghosts, and Ancestors," in Arthur Wolf ed., Religion and Ritual in Chinese Society (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1974), PP. 131-182; especially p. 169. 84 See Huang Xiufu, Maoting kehua, juan Io; in Chen Gaohua ed., Song liao fin huajia shiliao (Beijing: Wenwu chuban she, 1984), P. 148. 85 See Murakami Yoshimi's discussion of ancient mythology in Bao pu zi; Murakami Yoshimi, "Onigami to sennin," Tjhh shz7kyj vol. I, no. 7 (Feb., 1995), pp. I-IS; for the section on demons and ghosts, see pp. 1-8. 86 This handscroll, entitled Raising the Alms-bowl, is from the Denver Art Museum, Colorado. It was published partially in Julia Murray, "Representations of Harati, the Mother of Demons, and the Theme of 'Raising the Alms-bowl'," Artibus Asiae vol. 63, no. 4 (1981), pp. 253-268, fig. 20. For a brief introduction to this narrative subject, see Julia Murray, "The Evolution of Buddhist Narrative Illustration in China after 850," in Marsha Weidner ed., Latter Days of the Law (Lawrence: The Spencer Museum of Art, 1994), p.141. 87 See Chen Gaohua ed., Sui tang huajia shiliao, p. 404. 88 For a plate, see Tang Wu Daozi mobao, p. 40. 39</page><page sequence="36">of Mus6e Guimet, Paris, is comparable to the images in the Boston and Junkunc pictures.89 A one- eyed tree trunk with a human chest and arms floats among the other spirits of nature. Slightly lower down, two spirits bearing the elements of leaves and mud can be discerned. Right below these two spirits are a lady wearing a peony in her hair and a naked child with botanic leaves growing out of his head. Their visual features are very similar to those of the lady and babies in the Junkunc leaf. A sim- ilar grouping of botanical spirits is presented in the scroll entitled Four Modes of Six Rebirths (liu dao si shen yiqie youqing jinhun zhong), which is one of the 139 Water Land paintings from the Buddhist temple Baoning si in Shanxi province (fig. 23), which can be dated around the mid-fifteenth century. A tree trunk with a distorted human face floats in the air with a female figure wearing flowers on her head. In the lower left corner, below the tree, horrifying demonic faces peep out of the rocks, which suggest the "mud eccentrics" (tu guai).90 The Bridge-crossing Metaphor (Du Qiao) and "Universal Salvation" (Pu Du) It is these dangerous spirits that the Earth Official is about to inspect, subjugate and perhaps, finally save and release from sin. As described in a sixth-century text by Zong Lin (ca. 498-561), all the hun- gry ghosts and prisoners are called together to the Daoist palace on the Day of Middle Primordial to make grand offerings to the deities in the Jade Capital Mountain. Magical chapters are chanted by all the immortal beings in order to bless the prisoners and the hungry ghosts. The hungry ghosts and the prisoners are finally free from suffering and return to their human state.9' While the theme of salvation is a key point in the cult of the Earth Official, in the Boston picture it is not obvious. The presence of the bridge motif suggests a possible metaphor of salvation. Pictori- ally, the bridge is arranged here to demarcate the boundary between the earth and water. The posi- tions of the figures imply that the earthly spirits escorted by the Zhong Kui-like officer are about to cross the bridge to meet the Official of Earth. A similar bridge motif appears at the marginal position of an early Ming scripture illustration of the Three Officials, entitled The Marvelous Scripture of the Most High Three Principles Who Protect and Prolong Life, Eliminate Disaster, Abolish Danger, Forgive Sins, and Confer Blessings, in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.92 The deities of Heaven, Earth, and Water are seated on rocks in the landscape. 89 The Water-Land paintings dated 1454 in the collection of the Mus e National des Arts Asiatiques Guimet, Paris, were commissioned by the Ming court under the supervision of the eunuch Wang Qin. The picture mentioned here, enti- tled Great Generals of the Deserts and the Spirits of Grasses and Trees Who Dwell in the Void of Water and Land is pub- lished in Stephen Little, Taoism and the Arts of China, fig. 84, p. 259. It is also published in Craig Clunas, Pictures and Visuality in Early Modern China (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1997), fig. I, p. 19. For a provocative study of the theme and iconography of this painting, see Caroline Gyss-Vermand, "D6mons et merveilles: visions de la nature dans une peinture liturgique du XVe siecle," Arts Asiatiques no. 63 (1988), pp. 106-122. 90 See Baoning si mingdai shui lu bihua (Beijing: Wenwu chubanshe, 1985), fig. Iso. The Water-Land paintings of the Baoning si monastery bear stylistic similarity with the Musee Guimet set dated 1454. See Caroline Gyss-Vermand, ibid. 91 See Zong Lin (ca. 498-56I),Jingchuz suishi ji, transcribed in Ouyang Xiu (557-641), Yi wen ju lei, p. 80. For the Eng- lish translation, see Stephen Teiser, The Ghost Festival in Medieval China, p. 36. 92 For a plate, see Stephen Little, Taoism and the Arts of China, fig. 72, p. 236. 4o</page><page sequence="37">At the lower left corner, a messenger submitting a report to the triad kneels on a bridge over the water. The presence of the bridge therefore seems to be an intentional arrangement and requires further explanation.93 As noticed by Charles Hartman, the bridge motif in Chinese landscape painting carries a certain religious overtone. In Chinese, the action of crossing a bridge, "du," can also refer to the action of "saving" and "releasing."94 In a similar vein, the term "pu du," which literally means "universal salva- tion," refers to a standardized form of a religious banquet held in the zhongyuan festival. Dedicated to all the souls and goblins released from the prison on the fifteenth day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar, the "pu du" banquet aims at releasing the sins and regulating the cosmic order. The bridge at the lower left corner of the Boston scroll therefore implies an allegorical meaning of "crossing over," or "salvation." For only by "crossing over" can the evil spirits be "saved" from their sins. 5. THE THIRD PAINTING: WATER, THE GHOST EXORCISM In the Daoist cosmic view, the realm of water sometimes implies suffering and malignancy - the res- idence of the "yin" power. In a cosmic chart of the Southern Song period from the early thirteenth- century Daoist text Yuanshi wuliang duren shangpin miaojing neiyi (fig. 24), Water is located below the "mysterious Heaven" (xuantian) and mountain (representing Earth). It is marked "the sea of suffer- ing," or "kuhai." 95 Pictorially, the Daoist Official of Water seems to echo the condition of turmoil in the lowest realm of the universe (fig. 3). Viewers encounter a clamorous seascape evidenced by its swirling waves, the scattered arrangement and the dynamic gestures of the figures. Instead of residing in their submarine 93 Another unpublished scripture illustration from the Yuan dynasty woodblock print edition of the jade Pivot Canon, British Library, London, also contains a very similar bridge motif at the marginal position of a landscape scene illus- trating the veneration of the Daoist deities. As shown in Shawn Eichman's paper entitled "The Precious Scripture of the Jade Pivot: A Printed Book in the British Library," presented in the Symposium of Taoism and the Arts of China, December 3, 2000, many interesting narrative images were included in this Yuan dynasty edition. Its artistic repre- sentation deserves closer examination in the future. For the introduction of this woodblock print scripture, see Shawn Eichman, "Uppermost Highest Spirit ThunderJade Pivot Thunderous Peal Precious Scripture with Talismanic Seals," in Stephen Little, Taoism and the Arts of China, fig. 73, pp. 237-9. Professor Lothar Ledderose, in a discussion at the International Conference on Religion and Chinese Society, Hong Kong, 2000, also drew attention to the presence of the bridge and water motifs in several Ming dynasty pictures of Zhong Kui. 94 Charles Hartman, "Mountains as Metaphors in T'ang Religious Texts and the Northern Landscape Painting of the Tenth Century," paper presented at the Conference on Mountains and the Cultures of Landscape in China, Santa Barbara, 1993. 95 This chart, entitled Chart of the Embodied Representation of the Ascent and Descent of Yin and Yang, is from Xiao Ying- sou, Yuanshi wuliang duren shangpin miaojing neiyi (preface dated 1226), CT 90. It provides "a view of the microcosmic landscape within which an enchymoma is created." See Charles Hartman, ibid.

In the central part of the painting, a figure riding a turtle sits frontally immediately below the Official of Water. His eyes stare at the audience attentively, drawing a powerful visual link between the viewer and the picture.96 Up in the sky, stagnant air is condensed in a distorted mass, which evokes associations with the gruesome atmosphere in the underworld (yin qi). Unlike the warm and graceful clouds in the scene of Heaven which evoke auspicious blessing (fig. I), here the cold and dark air sug- gests malevolence and misfortune. A group of hybrid creatures representing the agents of thunder, lightning, wind and rain are manipulating the storm. Ahead of the troops, there are two torsos emerg- ing into the air. One is an officer holding records, while the other is an ordinary woman who also car- ries rolls of documents in her arms. They are forced to advance by the hybrid troops behind them. Deities Crossing the Seas It is noteworthy that the Daoist Official of Water features a compositional format of "crossing the seas ("du hai") popular during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.97 A dynamic version of the same format is presented in this Buddhist scroll Lohans Crossing the Sea from the Daitoku-ji set of Five Hundred Lohans by Lin Tinggui and Zhou Jichang dated from 1178 to 1188 (fig. 25). According to Wen Fong, this set of lohan paintings was sponsored by the local devotees in the villages adjacent to Ningbo, Zhejiang province, and was originally donated to a local monastery near Ningbo.98 Similarly to the retinue of the Water Official, the lohans are standing on a dragon, a turtle, and a divine shell. The formalized patterns of the waves on the lower part of the Daitoku-ji scroll resemble the decora- tive shapes of waves in the Boston scroll.99 96 The deity sitting on a turtle has its iconographic association with the Deity of the River (he bo) in the pictorial narra- tive subject "the Nine Songs" (jiu ge). The turtle rider in the Boston painting shares the prototype with the "Deity of the River" portrayed in the Nine Songs handscroll formerly attributed to Zhang Dunli in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Another image bearing the same iconography is depicted in the Nine Songs handscroll by Zhang Wu, in the Cleveland Museum of Art. For plates, see Wu Tung, Tales from the Land of Dragons: 1ooo Years of Chinese Painting, fig. 91, p. 195; Wai-kam Ho et al., Eight Dynasties of Chinese Painting: The Collections of the Nelson Gallery-Atkins Museum, Kansas City, and the Cleveland Museum of Art (Cleveland: The Cleveland Museum of Art, 1980), fig. 96, p. 120. 97 Its prototype might be related to the Buddhist painting illustrating boddhisattvas attending the Buddha's assembly O(fu hui), inherited in the mural tradition. The murals in Yulin cave no. 3 executed during the later Xi Xia period (1038-1227), feature scenes of the boddhisattvas Samantabhadra and Manjusri crossing the sea on either side of the west wall. Compared to the composition of the Boston scroll, the main icon is also shown driving a sacred creature at the center of the procession. The whole group is marching in a horizontal fashion against a sea of clouds that in turn emerge from the background water. For plates, see Zhongguo shiku: Xi'an Yulin shiku (Beijing: Wenwu chubanshe, 1997), figs. 158, I65. 98 Wen Fong, Beyond Representation: Chinese Painting and Calligraphy, 8th-I4th Century (New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1992), pp. 343-345; footnote 21, pp. 375-376. For an early study on the project of the Five Hundred Lohans by Lin Tinggui and ZhouJichang, see Wen Fong, The Lohans anda Bridge to Heaven (Washington, D.C.: Smith- sonian Institute, 1958). 99 The rendering of waves in the Daitoku-ji set appears varied in different scrolls. While some are more naturalistic, some are schematic and decorative. It seems that the professional tendency toward flatness and the decorative is com- mon to the Boston and the Daitoku-ji paintings. In his 1971 article, Robert Maeda dated the Boston scroll to the Yuan dynasty on the basis of the formalized patterns of the waves. See Robert J. Maeda, "The Water Theme in Chinese 42</page><page sequence="39">Why did the artists represent the divine powers in a sweeping seascape? The swirling waves seem to facilitate the deities' exercise of their magical powers, such as inducing rain or exorcising ghosts.0oo Indeed, the Daitoku-ji lohans may have been worshiped in a religious rite summoning their magical powers. It is interesting to note that a full moon is depicted amid the dark clouds at the top of the picture to signify a night scene. This motif may suggest a certain night of the full moon on the fifteenth day of the lunar calendar month, during which the lohans were summoned to descend for the ritual held in the temple. A group of demon-attendants march diagonally across the bottom of the Daoist Official of Water. Two carry mirror-like gongs on their backs, while the other two hold hammers and strike the gongs (fig. 26). All of them are screaming as they strike the gongs and march. Indeed, clamor is a key concern in the depiction of figures in the processions whose goal is to ward off evil spirits. Very similar pictorial motifs occur in the handscroll entitled New Year's Eve Excursion of Zhong Kui (Zhong Kui yeyou tu) painted by Yan Hui in the late thirteenth or early fourteenth cen- tury (fig. 27).Io0 The noisy procession begins with a figure hitting a gong. Next we see some figures wielding halberds and spears, all shouting. Finally we see musicians beating drums, flanking the demon-queller Zhong Kui. The group play their instruments loudly throughout the parade in order to ward off evil spirits. Such processions actually occurred in twelfth- and thirteenth-century China. According to Menliang lu, a late thirteenth-century description of the festivals of Hangzhou, on New Year's Eve, actors and musicians dressed up in masks and colorful embroidered costumes to play the roles of Zhong Kui, his sister, a judge, an emissary, and demons. They beat gongs and drums and went from house to house performing a grand exorcism and demon-expelling ceremony.'0o A Southern Song genre painting entitled Grand Exorcism, or Da nuo tu, displays similar motifs (fig. 28). It depicts genre figures wearing strange masks performing an exorcism dance, a popular ritual to Painting," Artibus Asiae vol. 33, no. 4 (1971), p. 260. In fact, the decorative rendering of the waves appears as early as the eleventh century in the screen paintings against the sculpture of the Goddess of the Sage Mother in the Shengmu Hall, Jinci, Shanxi Province. For a plate, see Craig Clunas, Art in China (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997), fig. 54, P. 12;Jinci (Beijing: Wenwu chuban she, 1981), fig. 45; for a more advanced study of this temple project, see Amy McNair, "On the Date of the Shengmudian Sculptures atJinci," Artibus Asiae vol. 49, nos. 3-4 (1988-9), pp. 238-253. Suzuki Kei also compares the decorative orientation of the waves in the Boston painting to the waves depicted in an earlier handscroll entitled Liangyuan nuxian, attributed to the Five Dynasties painter Ruan Gao, in the Palace Museum, Beijing; see Suzuki Kei, Chuzgoku kaigashi chfi no ichi, p. 200. Ioo For example, the eleventh century imperial project in the Shengmu Hall, Jinci, Shanxi province, includes very fine pictorial renditions of waves on the screen panels. The screen panels are set against the main icon, the Sage Mother, who was thought of by the local people "as a rain deity in the popular imagination." See Amy McNair, ibid., p. 242. 101 For the most recent study on Yan Hui, see Kondo Hidemi, "Lun Yan Hui: Hunpo yoli de shijie," Gugong bowuyuan yuan kan no. I (1996), pp. 37-55.

Two figures to the lower right of this painting - one carrying a drum on his back and the other strik- ing the drum from behind - remind us of the demons striking the drums in the Boston painting. The Thunder Troops The Water Official's ritualistic performance finally reaches a climax at the top of the picture with the celestial troops of thunder, lighting, wind and rain (fig. 29). In both folk culture and pictorial con- ventions, thunder, lightning, wind, and rain are personified as demonic guardians who subjugate dan- gerous spirits. They usually appear as a group led by the thunder god.104 As many sources remind us, people of the Tang and Song regarded thunder, lightning, wind, and rain as natural symptoms asso- ciated with the appearance of supernatural forces, either ghosts or gods.1o5 As Wu Tung points out, an early painting of this kind, discussed in a poem by the Northern Song scholar Su Xun, also includes images of thunder and wind in the sky.,o6 According to Su Xun, this was a painting of the Official of Water that was reputed to be the single surviving scroll from a lost set of three paintings by the famous Tang court painter Yan Liben (ca. 6oo-673).o07 It is noteworthy that above the sea there are several figures in the air which might represent the agency of wind and thunder. The wind master is said to carry a black tiger bag ("feng shi he hu nang").108 Following him are three more feathered immortals ("yicong san shen ren"), moving toward the heavenly gate ("chao tian guan").V09 The call for thunder to exorcise ghosts had a contemporary ritual significance. The Southern Song period saw a growing interest in the Thunder Rites, or "lei fa." Many divinities associated with thun- der were incorporated into the Daoist pantheon around this time. Daoist masters, especially those from 103 See Zhongguo meishu quanji huihua bian, vol. 4, Songdai huihua (Beijing: Wenwu chuban she, 1988), pl. 87, catalog entry p. 45. 104 The earliest record of the thunder god can be found in the writings of the Shanhai jing, which portrays the thunder god as a sacred creature with a dragon body and a human head, residing in the Thunder Pond. As early as the Han dynasty, the image of thunder has been visualized as a circle of drums, with the thunder god depicted as a guardian striking the drums. See Wang Chong, "lei xu," in Lun Heng. For an early representation of the thunder god, see the mural in Dunhuang cave no. 249, Zhongguo shiku: Dunghuang mogao ku (Beijing: Wenwu chubanshe. 1982), vol. I, fig. 104. Thunder, lightning, wind and rain had long been worshiped in important state rites as venerable natural forces that regulate the order of the universe. For a rich anthology of historical literature centering on the state worship of thunder, lightning, wind, and rain, see Gujin tushu jicheng (Beijing: Zhonghua shuchu, 1985), "bowuhui bian," "shenyi dian," juan 20, vol. 490, pp. 39-42. oy5 For example, the Tang poet Wei Qumou writes, "Accompanying the wind and the rain, myriad of gods descend" (fengyu baishen lai); Su Shi writes, "the clouds condense when the spirits and goblins flock together; the clouds dis- perse when ghosts and deities depart" (yunxing lingguai ju, yunsan guishen huan). See Gujin tushu jicheng, "Buowu hui- bian, shenyi dian," juan 6, vol. 489, p. 31. Zhu Xi also associates wind, rain, thunder, and lightning with ghosts and deities. See Gujin tushu jicheng, "Buowu huibian, shenyi dian," juan 20, vol. 490, p. 41. io6 Wu Tung, Tales from the Land of Dragons, p. 150. 107 Su Xun, "Ciyun shuiguan shi," in Su Shi, Dongpo xuji, juan I; see Chen Gaohu, Suitang huajia shiliao, pp. 49-50. io8 Ibid., p. 50o. 109 Ibid., p. 50o. 44</page><page sequence="41">the southern regions where thunderstorms were frequent and fierce, used the thunder rites to ward off disease and exorcise evil spirits.II0 One typical incantation of the time ran: "I embody the power of the thunder god and lightning goddess in order to make extinct the diseases in the body [...] I will make the generals and soldiers from different directions quell the hundreds of evils, and exorcise millions of spirits. Quickly, quickly, quickly, in accord with the order!""' On the upper left side of the painting, the thunder god appears as a guardian beating drums and carrying a shiny mirror-like gong on his head - a magical object usually associated with lightning. Under the drums are three more demon guardians, who may represent the forces of wind and rain. In this representation, the masters of wind are represented as two figures; one stands to the right of the painting wielding a halberd, his wind bag open, and another figure stands behind him, carrying another wind bag. Although the silk has been retouched and the image is unclear, the feathered crea- ture standing between the two wind masters appears to be holding a bowl, which often symbolizes the rainmaker spreading the raindrops.II The Female Ghost Given these divinities and implements related to exorcism crowding the picture, one must wonder who or what is being exorcised. In the upper right-hand section of the painting, we see two figures standing in front of the troops (fig. 30). The officer holding records and clad in a red robe resembles the grotesque-looking officer who subjugates the earthly prisoners in the Daoist Official of Earth (fig. 17). He escorts a female whose appearance embodies distinctive features of a lay person. With the eyes sunken and the wrinkles around her face and neck, she looks like an old woman. Huddled and trem- bling in the wind and rain brought by the troops behind her, she gazes into the distance beyond the picture plane as she is escorted away. Other Water Land paintings used in rituals for sending dying souls to their proper resting place often use a similar motif. A fifteenth-century example from the set of the Water Land paintings in IIo As Ryui Shiman pointed out, the thunder rite has two major functions in the Southern Song period: first, to exorcise the ghosts; second, to induce the rain. Descriptions of performances of the thunder rite are many. In Fuzhou, Fujian province, Zhang Kezhe learned the thunder rite in a monastery and used it to drive away a fox spirit residing in the temple. Other examples describe Daoist masters applying thunder talismans for warding off disease and curing patients. For more detailed information on the practice of the thunder rite in the Southern Song period, see Ryai Shi- man, "Raijin shinko to raiho no tenkai," in Taiwan no dikyo to minkan shinki (Tokyo: Kodamasha, 1994), pp. 65-91; for the Southern Song examples, see pp. 69-71. iii Daofa huiyuan (late fourteenth century), juan 8, CT 1220, Daozang, vol. 28, p. 715; see also Matsumoto K6ichi, "Dao- jiao yu zongjiao liyi," in Zhu Yueli trans., Daojiao, vol. I, p. 188. 112 An incomplete handscroll entitled Taoist Divinity of Water attributed to He Cheng of the early fourteenth century, now in the Freer Gallery, bears an impressive layout of the thunder troops comparable to the icons in the Boston pic- ture. Painted on paper, it might have functioned as a draft or sketch. Compared with the Boston painting, the thun- der troops in the Freer handscroll are more elaborate in terms of their scheme. For more discussions of this painting, see Thomas Lawton, Chinese Figure Painting, fig. 38, pp. 156-158; Marsha Weidner, "Ho Ch'eng and Early Yuan Dynasty Painting in Northern China," Archives of Asian Art no. 39 (1986), pp. 6-I9. 45</page><page sequence="42">Baoning si monastery provides a good comparison (fig. 31). A demon guardian escorts a woman dressed in a white funeral robe. Like the female figure in the Boston painting, she appears at the top of the painting floating in the air. From the label we know that she is a wandering ghost who has come to console her bereaved family.II3 Regarded as an evil spirit, she was sent away by the demon soldiers. This comparison suggests that we can reasonably identify the female figure in the Boston scroll as a human ghost. Like the ape demon and the tree monster captured in the realm of the Official of Earth, the human ghost is regarded as another kind of aberration harmful to the living."4 As mentioned above, Water Land paintings are used in Buddhist Water Land Assembly rituals (shui lu hui) conducted for all the souls of the dead on land and sea, especially the sponsoring family's ancestors and relatives. In general, the ritual summons the myriad gods to the altar site, while at the same time calling the hungry ghosts to be fed in the feast, then sending them on their way to salvation in the western Pure Land of Amitabha Buddha. Parallel to the Buddhist Water Land Assembly in Daoism is the Purgation Rite of the Yellow Register, or "huang lu zhai," popular in the Song period. In fact, many Purgation Rites of the Yellow Register were held during the Days of the Three Primordials, the very festivals in the year dedicated to the Three Officials. Furthermore, Daoist ritual texts instruct that paintings of the Three Officials be hung on one of the six altar screens during the performance of this ritual."5 In particular, the Official of Water was venerated as the major deity who authorized the Purga- tion Rite of the Yellow Register during the Tang and Song periods."6 An episode from the Southern Song text Yijian zhi links the Purgation Rite of the Yellow Register and the divine realm of the Water Official. It recounts a story of the Purgation Rite of the Yellow Register held in the Daoist temple in Raozhou, Jiangxi province. The female ghosts who came to the purgation rite held in the temple were said to be all wet: On the sixteenth day of the second month, in the fourth year of the Qingyuan reign (II98 A.D.), the Tianqing temple in Raozhou held the Purgation Rite of the Yellow Register. People donated money in order to pray for the dead. Each person donated one thousand and two hundred qian. One thousand people attended the rite. When the rite was about to end, the merchant Fu San saw his mother, who had recently died. She was dressed in clothing that she had worn when alive. [Wet from top to bottom, she came from afar and entered the banquet.] Fu San was very sad when he saw her. He came home immediately, weeping [...] 113 The title reads: "diao ke sang men da hao xiao hao zhai long zhu shen zhong." See Baoning si mingdai shuilu bihua, fig. 132. 114 As Judith Boltz pointed out, when defining perversity, the twelfth century Daoist master Lu Shizong distinguishes two types, the great and the small. Small perversities are the human souls who await release from the netherworld, like the female ghost in the painting of the Official of Water. Great perversities are the false enshrinements within Buddhist and Daoist abbeys, or the spirits attached to mountains and forests, like the ape and the tree monster in the painting of the Official of Earth. See Judith Boltz, "Not by the Seal of Office Alone," in Patricia B. Ebrey and Peter N. Gregory eds., Religion and Society in T'ang and Sung China (Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1993), P. 272. 115 Lin Weifu (1239-1303) ed., Lingbao lingjiao jidu jinshu, juan I, CT 466, Daozang, vol. 7, p. 28. II6 Daomen dingzhi (preface dated 1188), CT 1224, Daozang, vol. 31, p. 713; see Ryfi Shiman, Chuzgoku dikyJ no matsuri to shinki, vol. I, p. 430. 46</page><page sequence="43">The daughter of the eye doctor Wei Sheng, who had married Zhou Si and had died while giving birth, also appeared at the feast. While the Daoist master was summoning the souls, Zhou Si saw [his wife appear in the air. She was dressed all in white and walked on the water. He even heard the sound of splashing water while she walked. When shefinally came close to Zhou Si, her feet were still wet]."7 Note that the story dramatizes how the ghosts were soaked to the bone when they appeared to their relatives. They had, of course, crossed the watery boundary between the living and the dead to attend the ritual for salvation. This is a clamorous realm indeed. One of the lay donors of this purgation rite, Zhou Si, who saw the soul of his wife, even heard the noise of the water that his wife splashed. The female ghost in the Boston scroll may provide a telling visualization of a similar ritual performance of the purgation rite: summoned by the Official of Water and his exorcism team, the wandering soul is now transcending the water realm to proceed to her final resting place, where she can no longer dis- turb the living. 6. CONCLUSION The Boston set of the Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water serves as a good example of the picto- rial merger of both the continuing religious tradition of Daoism and the particular visual culture of its time. In the absence of any written words on the Boston paintings we cannot conclude whether or not the Boston paintings were actually used in any Daoist ritual. Because many pictorial motifs and formulations are used to portray a dynamic pantheon, one might speculate that the Boston paintings could have been used in an imperially sponsored Daoist ritual."8 In any case, their style and content boldly attest to the actual roles of deities as conceived by a viewer of the time. The Boston set reveals a pictorial tendency newly formulated during the Southern Song period: a preference for the magical and mobile character of the gods rather than the static and inaccessible icons residing in their remote palaces."9 The Three Officials are now perceived as bureaucratic gods capable of action and possessing dynamia. Engaged in different acts of justice in their respective cosmic spheres, they mirror the dynamic vernacular evoked by the ritual master during his summoning of the gods in the Daoist ritual. 117 For the complete text, see Hong Mai (1123-1202), Yijian zhi (Beijing: Zhonghua shuju, 1981), zhi 3, juan ji, no. 2, p. 1319. 118 Daoist scholars who have done fieldwork in modern Taiwan and China share the opinion that the Boston paintings are simply too good to have been used in rituals. 119 The trend of picturing the devotional images in a dynamic fashion is not only restricted to the Three Officials; it applied to a body of religious pictorial images created during the twelfth and the thirteenth centuries. Many of these paint- ings were used in Buddhist rituals to evoke the depicted gods for specific magical performances, such as rescuing the deceased, inducing rainfall, or feeding hungry ghosts. This trend merits closer research in future in order to be able to comment upon the relationship of the formation of such a pictorial fashion to the prevalent practice of magical rites during the Southern Song period. 47</page><page sequence="44">Although the Dao has been named and depicted in myriad ways, it still remains one inseparable unity, as do the images of the Boston triad. The three paintings exemplify a thematic program: we observe a continual process of the rectification and restoration of the natural and proper Way.'20 In the center of the triptych, a messenger reports to the Official of Heaven - presumably to inform him of some disorder. Here a messenger announces injustice and danger and an officer who might represent the Daoist master himself submits a plea for a ritual to correct the disasters. On the right, the Official of Earth sets forth to deal with such offenders of the Way, arresting evil spirits. On the left, we see a conclusion to this whole process, as the Official of Water and his great entourage sweep across the seas having accomplished their goal of restoring the natural process. This drama is articulated most clearly in the huddled ghost of the poor, wet woman being led back to her proper resting place. As a result, the whole set is a visualization of the return to the natural order by the restoration of what is right, proper and just. The paintings, and the rituals accompanying them, represent a belief in the possibil- ity of correcting disasters and eradicating evils, restoring order and returning the world to a place where the Dao continues to function as the proper Way. 120 I am grateful to Professor Richard Barnhart for introducing the notion of the thematic program. Many ideas here were developed on the basis of personal correspondence with Richard Barnhart in October I999. 48</page><page sequence="45">GLOSSARY Akizuki Kanei k J ].VM Baoli si *Pff bai sui mu zhi jing -;$ .
