This furnishes some incisive analyses, as when one of La Rochefoucauld's maxims, on the currency or value which kings give to their favorites, is used to elucidate Clitandre (46-47), or when woman is shown to be an "erratic object of trade" in Othon (133-35). Nevertheless, the foregrounding of socioeconomic elements detracts from Baker's insightful arguments on characterization. The coordination of two rich codes, personation/impersonation and generosity/Machiavellism, is disrupted and its effect diffused by the addition of a third set of coordinates, based on the distinction between essence and commodity. This reservation does not mitigate Baker's perspicacious and stimulating interpretation of each of the plays. Her theory of personation and impersonation is delineated well and argued strongly. It would provide a useful frame for studying both Corneille's more successful plays and works of other playwrights. VAN KEJLLY University of Kansas SVETLANA BOYM. Death in Quotation Marks: Cultural Myths of the Modern Poet. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1991. 291 p. Svetlana Boym's intriguing title with its emphasis on death belies the liveliness of her radical reassessment of the poetic-and the critical-enterprise in terms of the tension between the work and the persona of the poet, the "uncanny relationship between artistic corpus and corps" (2). What she offers here is nothing less than a scathing reexamination of the most cherished assumptions, shibboleths, and sacred cows that French, Russian, and American literati have cultivated since the last century. Although Boym is obviously very much at home in the labyrinthine intricacies of structuralist and post- structuralist theory (not to mention various pre-structuralist critical approaches such as the New Criticism) and although her underlying intent is a serious one, she pursues a refreshingly light-hearted "back-to-basics" approach in her skillful use of etymological word plays. For example, after pointing out that fashion originates from the same verb as poetry, (to make-facere in Latin and poein in Greek), she observes that, though the transiency of fashion seems to defy serious analysis, her interpretation will "explore how clothes signify in poetry and in the development of the biographical legend [and] will combine clothes reading and close reading, demonstrating the impossibility of a complete 'disclosure' or laying bare of the poetic text" (34). In her introduction, she reveals that "the metaphor of the theater will be crucial in my examination of the cultural self of the poet," and, indeed, she inquires into the manner in which the poetic enterprise is a process of assuming or avoiding roles, rehearsing, and ultimately dying, whether metaphorically or metaphysically, on or off stage. She observes that "the relationship between life, art, and culture is not that of a mimesis, or a hierarchy, but rather that of a chain of rehearsals based on a certain limited repertoire" (29). She adds that "my focus will be precisely on the tension between the cultural 66</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews image/mask/myth and the individual practice of writing [which is] one of the outstanding everyday practices that both contributes to and resists self- theatricalization." What interests her in all this is not biography, she concludes, but rather "life in quotation marks and biographical legend" and the need to show how poets "articulate the relationship between their life and art and how the poet's writing both depends upon and challenges his or her intentionally created, unintentionally assumed, or forcefully imposed, cultural mask" (34). In each of the chapters, the author examines a specific instance of the death of the author-whether literal or figurative-that challenges the practice of close reading. In the first chapter, "The Death of the Author: Stopping Living and Stopping Writing," she focuses on the example of Mallarme and the legend of his "defacement" according to which he literally and figuratively "stopped living," thereby assuming the mythical identity assigned to him by Paul Valery of "pure poet," a writer without a biography (80). (Mallarme's actual death by asphyxiation was accidental but, for Valery, symbolically appropriate.) From Mallarme's self-effacement in text she moves to Rimbaud's decision to "stop writing" and explores the ambiguity of the transition from "the text that anticipates Rimbaud's departure from literature to the letter that anticipates his departure from life" (105). In "The Death of the Revolutionary Poet," she investigates the relationship between poetry and politics, especially the myth of the revolutionary poet, exposing the tension between poetry and engagement. Her analysis focuses on Mayakovsky as the model of the revolutionary poet whose role-playing spreads throughout all his activities and infects his critics and readers. In the chapter entitled "The Death of the Poetess," she explores the relationship between poetry and gender. She proceeds to reveal what is hidden behind both the claim of a universal poetic genius and the genderless impersonality of modernist writing. At the center of the discussion is the figurative and nonfigurative death of the Russian woman poet, Marina Tsvetaeva, who hanged herself in a small Siberian town in 1941. Boym then explores how the cultural mask of the poetess can entrap and challenge, and how the poet's death can be viewed as a "tragic denouement... in a feminine paradigm" (236). The final chapter, "The Death of the Critic," leads to an ironic climax in which she examines the work of Barthes, de Man, and Foucault, three critics who advocated the death of the author yet whose own deaths have led to countless biographical speculations. She asks several rhetorical questions which underline controversial and ultimately open-ended questions: "What are the limitations of the critical discourse that excludes the poet's 'biographical legend' from the scope of inquiry?" (36). "Do the 'complete works' of any writer present an organic whole or a collection of fragments? ... How does one distinguish between personal and theoretical stakes, between desires and repressions operating in text and life?" (243-44). Svetlana Boym's brilliant study is a metaphorical, metalinguistic, metatheoretical, and, ultimately, iconoclastic romp through the sacred groves of literary academe which repeatedly opens new vistas of critical thought and 67</page><page sequence="3">Rocky Mountain Review speculation. Although there is probably something here to offend nearly everyone, on balance there is far more savory food for thought than unpalatable provender, and this book is a must-read for any serious student of literature. RICHARD J. CUMMINGS University of Utah ROBERT H. BROWN. Nature's Hidden Terror: Violent Nature Imagery in Eighteenth-Century Germany. Columbia: Camden House, 1991. 148 p. In the study of eighteenth-century German culture there are no concepts more vast, complex, or contradictory than those of nature and the natural. As a mirror in which eighteenth-century culture perceived, understood, and articulated itself, nature came to signify practically everything. In his concise study of eighteenth-century nature imagery in German literature, Robert Brown manages this chaos by focusing upon violent nature imagery as a literary code of social upheaval. The author examines the treatment of nature in late eighteenth-century German literature as metaphorical space for the emergence of the bourgeois class into the public, competitive, and capitalistic sphere. The introductory chapter offers a brief but informative outline of the socio- economic premises that gave rise to bourgeois culture. Brown then reiterates the anthropomorphism of nature, which places upon nature the myth of social significance. As carrier of absolute reality and moral content, this myth underwent a major shift during the eighteenth century, as its religious and metaphysical significance was replaced by secular and empirical understanding. Accordingly, violent nature "changed from an emblem of God's eternal order into the symbol of a changing world" (5). For Brown, the major impetus for such a shift was provided by the Lisbon earthquake of 1755, the cultural ramifications of which he examines in his second chapter. Contrary to popular assumptions, this disaster, Brown argues, did not so much destroy outright the faith in nature as a manifestation of divine providence as it galvanized the debate over the metaphysical optimism of Leibniz and Pope. This debate "finally discredited the metaphysical basis of philosophical optimism, which established individual experience as a dominant criterion of equality" (131). This triumph of empiricism led to a new signification of nature and its various manifestations. According to the book's central hypothesis, violent nature imagery was a major esthetic vehicle accompanying the dialectic of the emerging bourgeois culture. Along with its socio-political reforms and revolutions, its cultural renovations and discoveries, bourgeois culture generated alienation, isolation, and "an all-consuming struggle of all against all" (136). Antithetical to the catastrophic, idyllic nature is identified by Brown as the encoding of the old, holistic, and harmonious order. In the central three chapters of the study, the author engages this binary construct of idyllic 68</page></plain_text>
