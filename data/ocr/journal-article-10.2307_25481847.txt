As some of the traditional links between education and human development seemed not to work as planned, a range of criticisms, reflections, and actions attempted to establish a closer causality between education and social harmony. UNESCO, as part of its reflection on past experience and in preparation for its missions of the 21st Century, established a Commission on Education for the Twenty-first Century in 1993. Chaired by Jacques Delors, it brought together a group of 15 personalities whose collective work was published in 1996 as 'Learn ing: the Treasure Within'. Among the fundamental assumptions and conclusions of its work is the notion of education throughout life as both a public and individual right and good. It posits an education that favours the emergence of the individual talents of each, preparing people for life as citizens, family and community members, and also economic agents. Its image of a successful education system is one built on four pillars: learning to know, learning to do, learning to be, and learning to live together. This image is both philosophical and pragmatic, one that forces attention to the societal role of education and the consequent balance between knowledge and action, between individual and social learning. It implicitly pro poses a vision of education that is alternative to one of education as mainly a contribution to the construction of human capital, its value measured by the rates of return from investment in education. It could be argued that learning to live together is both the most evocative and the most elusive of the roles of education for the 21st century. While hardly any thinkers or participants in educational practice would argue against the need to learn to live together, practical application of this principle in school systems is often assumed, neglected, or limited to the early years of schooling before aca demic and practical learning for the economic sector begins. How the Delors report speaks to us today on the subject of learning to live together is the focus of this article. The theme is particularly relevant to the current celebration of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue and to the renewed challenge of living in harmony among the different cultures and religions that coexist within the Euro pean mosaic. While conflict between countries diminished in the second half of the 20th century compared to the preceding hundred years, conflict within countries increased markedly in the latter decades. Macro social and economic trends, including migration, globalisation, and urbanisation and increasing inequality, seemed to exacerbate conflicts between groups, between boys and girls, women ? 2008 The Authors.

Thus the expansion of education opportunity did not reach, or not adequately, the poorest segments of society. Education's role in providing steps up the economic ladder weakened. Rhetoric about its value remained strong, but dissatisfaction with its quality and results seemed to grow. A nagging doubt about the role of education in fostering social cohesion became widespread. What achievements can we point to, what challenges can we identify, what are the practical ways forward? Background '(...) Education has a fundamental role to play in personal and social develop ment. The Commission does not see education as a miracle cure or a magic formula opening the door to a world in which all ideals will be attained, but as one of the principal means available to foster a deeper and more harmonious form of human development and thereby to reduce poverty, exclusion, ignorance, oppres sion and war (. . .) It is the view of the Commission that, while education is an ongoing process of improving knowledge and skills, it is also ? perhaps primarily ? an exceptional means of bringing about personal development and building relationships among individuals, groups and nations (...) The members of the Commission wished ... to stress the pivotal role of UNESCO, a role that stems directly from the ideas on which UNESCO was founded, based upon the hope for a world that is a better place to live in, where people will have learned to respect the rights of women and men, to show mutual understanding, and to use advances in knowledge to foster human development rather than to create further distinctions between people (...) The Commission has put greater emphasis on one of the four pillars that it proposes and describes as the foundations of education: learning to live together, by developing an understanding of others and their history, traditions and spiritual values and, on this basis, creating a new spirit which, guided by recognition of our growing interdependence and a common analysis of the risks and challenges of the future, would induce people to implement common projects or to manage the inevitable conflicts in an intelligent and peaceful way. Utopia, some might think, but it is a necessary Utopia, indeed a vital one if we are to escape from a dangerous cycle sustained by cynicism or by resignation' (Delors et al, 1996). Twelve years on, these key notions taken from the Introduction to the Report seem both appropriate and tantalising, but far from being realised. New conflicts and tensions in the intervening ten years have arisen that are mainly within countries: between economic, ethnic, and religious groups and even, to some extent, between generations. Growing inequality, scarcity of resources, urbanisa tion and increased migration feed old and new tensions. Violence, including that between men and women, boys and girls, has been eased in some ways and has cropped up with renewed vigour in other quarters. Religion is increasingly used as a justification for conflict ? violent or not ? both within and among religions. Touraine (2005), a respected analyst of modernity and late modernity, identi fies a major paradigm shift: from a social paradigm that prevailed throughout the 19th and most of the 20th centuries to a cultural paradigm well in place in the wake of the 21st century. The latter is driven by three key ideas: (i) the declining value of ? 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation ? 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="3">Roberto Carneiro &amp; Alexandra Draxler 151 society; (ii) an inexorable advance of supra-social forces (warfare, market, mobil ity) (iii) the increase in cultural demands. The end of society has given way to the emergence of the individual. Whilst before, the individual was a product of society, both in behaviour and thinking, nowadays, the individual is the single and foremost driving force in shaping one's self. In this process of liberation from social determinism the individual is a subject of cultural creation (re-creation). Culture becomes the 'thick' interpretative category to an ever-complex and intertwined world. In this increasingly mutant context most people, including, of course, educa tors, believe that education has a significant, even fundamental, role to play in developing the understanding and competence required to live together. Two UNESCO Reports, Two Different Contexts The International Commission on the Twenty-first Century was established by the Director-General of UNESCO (Federico Mayor) to take the first major look at the aims and purpose of education worldwide since 1972, when UNESCO published Learning to Be (Faure, 1972). Learning to Be was the result of a previous commission, created by UNESCO in the wake of world-wide turbulence by students and young people all over the world in 1967 and 1968. These upheavals are to many in Europe symbolised by the riots in France, known simply as May 1968. But young people demonstrated all over Western Europe, North America, and elsewhere in the 'developing' world in countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, Senegal, Congo, Brazil, Chile, and China. Among the subjects of dissatisfaction were those related to education, too variously felt and described to be summarised. The unease, however, can be expressed as one related to a young generation that was convinced that the world needed to change and that its leaders could not do so quickly or effectively enough. Education seemed stuck with older models whereby culture, philosophy, knowledge were transmitted rather than forged by the learners' critical analyses. The UNESCO Commission worked during 1970 and 1971, publishing a report that proposed a humanistic and optimistic vision of education: an education available and undertaken through life, and an education that enables each individual to use to the best the talents he or she possesses. It was an institutional ratification of a trend to demand of education that it be more than transmission, i.e. a liberation of energy, creativity and progress. It was a period when the prevailing climate was one of optimism in the future, and the sometimes explosive demands of students were ones of confidence in progress. During the 1970s, the humanistic vision of education proposed by the 1972 report was widely quoted and used. It lived side by side with the continuing conception ? largely emerging from the industrial developments of the 19th century ? of education as a contribution to homo economicus. Economic calcula tions of the value of education were developed and refined, and to a large extent informed policy, not without some positive results in terms of resource allocation and links between education and the real world. Education was considered by many as an ideological and policy battleground for forging the society of tomorrow. By the early 1990s, new trends had come into play that influenced education thinking and demands for education. Globalisation, the dominance of interna tional economic trends, some major failures of educational development policy in emerging economies, and failures of mass education to create jobs and social ? 2008 The Authors.

One saw an increasing view of education as first of all a preparation for work. In this climate, the Delors Commission held hearings and meetings all over the world, commissioned papers, discussed and delivered a report that built on the humanistic vision of Learning to Be. It was a report that re-affirmed the centuries-old view of education as a holistic process, successful when it linked knowledge with practice, individual with collective competence. What effect do such reports have? The best analogy is that of a 'White Paper': it informs but does not dictate legislation and policy. It forms a backdrop against which the practical details can be worked out by the decision-makers. The Delors report was translated into more than 30 languages, it informed policy debate in several regions and in every country where a language version was available, and generated special initiatives in at least 50 countries. Schools and districts took the four pillars as a basis to review their curricula. The Delors report continued in the paths kept open by previous humanist authors, including Learning to Be. It acknowledges the challenges of mass education. It recognises the increasing permeability between educational institu tions and the surrounding society. It emphasises the need for education to have practical applications. It maintains, however, the optimism and ideals of an edu cation that provides people with the tools to live in and contribute to society, by proposing the four pillars that include knowledge, understanding, competences for life and competences for action. Does one know how such work impacts on policy? This is a difficult question and one that bedevils both thinkers and practitioners. The evidence of direct impact is scattered: fifty or so major policy conferences that had the report as a central theme, reports of legislation in a dozen or so countries, local applications, continued debate in scholarly and other publications, and continued references in the policies of UNESCO, the World Bank, and bilateral donors' papers. Learning to Live Together: itself a controversy The theme of this article is one of the four pillars, learning to live together. As with the other pillars, the basic notion is ancient, consensual, and needed. Yet learning to live together is a contentious issue, arguably increasingly so. On the one hand, the notions of social cohesion and social capital have become respectable concepts that are integral parts of economic assessments of the factors of development. On the other, the proponents of an education that plays its best role in preparing people to be economic actors inevitably favour competition and can provide a strong contradictory example for the daily practice of living together. Complicating the issue is the fact that notions of tolerance and living together become infinitely more complicated in a world with shifting populations, unstable communities and families, and uncertainty about what constitutes social norms. Indeed, a recent UNESCO conference even pointed to what it called 'new igno rances' emerging in a globalised world.3 In this issue of the Journal, Rodolfo Stavenhagen takes a close look at what learning to live together means in a context of equal rights and opportunities for minorities. Europe itself is divided on policies about living together: while schools, on the whole, attempt to communicate notions of equality, respect, and 'active solidarity', ? 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation ? 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="5">Roberto Carneiro &amp; Alexandra Draxler 153 the surrounding environment can communicate a quite different message. Dis course and supporting legislation in many countries are hardening against immigrants from poor countries, and policies against illegal immigrants have occasionally and spectacularly resulted in children being pulled out of schools in Europe to be sent back to countries they do not remember or have never known. Manifestation of race or identity can be perceived as a threat by the mainstream culture and its representatives, whereas refusal to let this be expressed?including in schools?is often lived as blatant discrimination. This last example sees 'learning to live together' turned on its head, depending on the viewpoint: families, and indeed students, demanding the right of Muslim girls to wear scarves to school feel that learning to live together means acceptance of the practice; opponents see 'learning to live together' as compliance with a national norm. Human rights notions get involved, each side interpreting their expression in a different way. Is it any wonder that, in this confused landscape, the notion is unquestionably generous and good, and its application devilishly difficult? Harvard University's Robert Putnam, one of the world's most influential political scientists and author of Bowling Alone, on the increasing atomisation of contemporary society, produced controversial research showing that the more diverse a community is, the less likely its inhabitants are to trust anyone, from their next-door neighbour to the mayor. He stressed, however, that immigration mate rially benefited both the 'importing' and 'exporting' societies, and that trends have been socially constructed, and can be socially reconstructed.4 Putnam concludes his acute remarks emphasising: 'What we shouldn't do is to say that they [immi grants] should be more like us. We should construct a new us'. What Do We Expect from Education? Identity, Rights and Learning The Delors report placed the notion of 'learning to live together5 firmly in the context of'understanding of others and their history'. Others are not necessarily 'the other': others are those who do not share our immediate identity, experience or status. But understanding others means understanding oneself. Individual identity, especially in a context of tension, can be seen in a monochromatic way by the person concerned or by another. Yet none of us is only Christian, female, homeless, a woman, a parent, a soldier, a teacher, a victim of war. We can be one or several or all of these things simultaneously. At the same time, identities and rights are closely linked. The ways in which they are forged have a great deal to do with how individuals and groups function in a wider society. The role of education should be, here as in all areas, to encourage the understanding of complexity: to help each person become aware of the multiple identities and roles (s)he inhabits, as well as those of the people around. Merely bringing together people or groups who 'are rivals or if they do not have the same status in the same geographical area . . . may have the opposite effect to that desired ? it may bring out hidden tensions and degenerate into an opportunity for conflict'. Ensuring that within the education system equal rights are not just a principle but a practice is fundamental to providing an environment in which the principles are evident in the day-to-day life of the learners, as well as in the subjects taught. ? 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation ? 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="6">154 European Journal of Education Conflict, Narrative and History When conflict breaks out, it is rare for voices to be heard in favour of protecting the future through understanding of 'the other'. Political leaders, communications media, and even textbooks and religious leaders tend to emphasise the wrongdoing of the other side at the expense of building bridges towards compromise and living together. Legitimate or felt injustices out of context are better and more easily described than the contextual to and fro of conflicts that most often have roots in history. Yet, the best builders of both peace and national pride have senses of history, humility, and the knowledge of when to compromise on deeply-held beliefs: Confucius, Ghandi and Mandela never won a battle but they have won the hearts of history. All over the world, there are people and institutions that try to infuse young people's education with a sense of history, with the teaching of the funda mentals of democracy, equality, rights that make for societies where people can live together. Narrative has much to do with the ways in which conflict becomes entrenched. Each side (two people, two groups) develops its own, self-serving vision of the beginning of the story, the origin of the conflict, and a narrative that flows from an original point of aggression or wrong-doing. Living together means accepting that there are different narratives, different truths, and different visions that may never be reconciled. In South Africa, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission put much emphasis on the presentation and hearing of these narratives. Implementation in Teaching and Learning What are the key ingredients of an education for living together in a world of conflict, including when that conflict is at home? The Delors report suggested several avenues: a strong emphasis on history, where all sides and points of view can be explored and discussed; a focus on the multiple identities that we all have and inhabit, so that 'identity' does not become the focus of mistrust of 'the other', and learning the duties of democratic participation as citizens. What practical measures prop up these principles? Curriculum is one. A curriculum that encourages questions, different viewpoints, and the possibility for learners to contribute their own knowledge will inevitably encourage openness: in France, for example, the history curriculum is based less on the narrative of a textbook author than on the study of written, visual and recorded evidence that present a mosaic of views and a variety of sources. Learners are thus constantly reminded that history is a complex mix of fact, experience, attitude, and power. However, injecting material about attitudes into curriculum is positive only if all agree about its importance and value, and assessments of student progress include these value subjects. Studies have shown that the most powerful motivation for teaching and learning is, perhaps unfortunately, the testing system. And tests are designed, on the whole, to measure knowledge. Designing tests to measure com petences such as collaboration, respect, or negotiation, is a challenge that has not yet been met by most education systems. The organisation of the learning process is another: when collective effort is given prominence, learners are obliged to have practical experience of the effort, compromise, disappointment and negotiation required to reach common goals. ? 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation ? 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="7">Roberto Carneiro &amp; Alexandra Draxler 155 The organisation of educational institutions is a further key feature. Whether it is democratic and inclusive practice within the institution or encouragement for learners to engage in volunteer work in the community, educational institutions that favour give and take for both teachers and learners are more likely to develop attitudes towards living together. Contact and experience are also essential for learning to live together. Who has not admired examples such as the Diwan East West Orchestra that demonstrate the power of common tasks among antagonistic groups?5 Knowledge, example, and practice need to come together to form a fertile ground for the development of living together. Experience of learners is not limited to their human contact. Today, mass media have a tremendous influence, and perhaps an unfulfilled responsibility. Young people in wealthy country spend as much time in front of their computer screens and their televisions as in school. Even in poorer countries, mass media and advertising have powerful influences on trends and attitudes. The lived reality that reinforces living together is not news; when harmony or stability breaks down it is. Learning to live together must be, including through images, a way to decode the reality of the other, to understand the real and perceived images that dominate her or his life, in order to find a meeting point. As communications media expand in their influence on our daily lives, our conviviality changes. Through other factors, young people are more and more isolated from other age groups. Thus, the role of education, and of educators, takes on increasing importance in providing the human interchange that is essential to learning, including learning the skills of media literacy. What does formal education have to do with this? Education is fundamentally about transmission and innovation. As Jacques Delors has said many times, edu cation is about transmission of what humanity has learned about itself. At the same time, it is also about innovation, i.e. giving learners the tools to push the bound aries of what is known, to invent new realities or to seek new understanding from the existing realities. Thus, the process of education has always been a balancing act between freedom and constraint. Consequently, fostering media literacy is about developing a critical, informed view of what one sees and learns through the media.6 It is about empowering individuals. It is about understanding each individual's multiple identities, and about the ways in which these identities influence our 'reading' of the real and imagined world. And, it is about understanding, respecting, and communicating with others, 'the other'. This understanding is central to both citizenship and to community taken in their broad sense. A Focus on the Future Peace, the outcome of learning to live together is, as UNESCO's founding state ments say, in the minds of men. Those minds are formed very young, so, for us to learn to live together, we must enable young people to have the knowledge, attitudes and possibilities to exercise the choice of humanism. In a recent speech, one of the candidates for the U.S. presidency7 first suggested how living together is a product of the past: 'Understanding . . . reality requires a reminder of how we arrived at this point. As William Faulkner once wrote, 'The past isn't dead and buried. In fact, it isn't even past', and then went on to say that we must be able to ? 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation ? 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="8">156 European Journal of Education embrace 'the burdens of our past without becoming victims of our past. It means continuing to insist on a full measure of justice in every aspect of American life. But it also means binding our particular grievances ? for better health care, and better schools, and better jobs ? to the larger aspirations of all Americans'. There are not simple answers to complex problems: the best preparation for life, as the Delors report emphasises many times, is a holistic one. A holistic approach to learning appeals to both the hand and the mind, to actions and to reflection. It is able to communicate knowledge and understanding on a particular subject, but is conscious of the terrain required for this to take root. Both interpersonal and inter-group conflicts create an immediate and dra matic disruption in the lives of people. They also lay down and harden features that make it more difficult for those involved to return to openness to living together. Young people who live in situations of conflict carry over violent behav iour as problem-solving mechanisms into other areas of life. Identities become simplified and monochromatic: the drama of people with mixed ethnic back grounds or mixed families when conflict arises is only one example. And, for young people, the destruction of the social frameworks that lay the grounds for confident and successful adulthood is incalculable. A successful diverse society needs to enable all its members to enjoy their linguistic and cultural rights. These can and should be a force for development and for living together. The Delors report's overall focus is on learning throughout life. School is a tool building part of learning throughout life: the way in which schools interact with the surrounding community, and the way in which learning in school connects with life experience are important in preparing people for their roles as citizens and as social and economic actors. So, learning to live together is not only for schools. The Lisbon Seminar The Lisbon event was an Expert Seminar jointly convened in June 2007 by EJE and the Gulbenkian Foundation with invited participants from different continents and academic approaches. It clustered around the following four themes that constituted the motto for original presentations and heated discussions: Learning to Live Together: Impact and future of the Delors report Learning to Live Together: Young people facing crises of identity and con flict Learning to Live Together: Opportunities and challenges From diagnosis to action: towards the necessary Utopia. The Seminar intended to look at the relevance of the Delors Report in the present context. The anecdotal evidence is affirmative. The seminar highlighted that many of its recommendations are still pertinent, notably: the emphasis on more resources and more creative ways to expand educa tion in developing countries; the fundamental need for a more inclusive education (notably gender equality); ? 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation ? 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="9">Roberto Carneiro &amp; Alexandra Draxler 157 the emphasis on extending education throughout life, by means of technol ogy and by means of an education credit for all individuals to be used up over a lifetime. Seminar participants, in their papers and discussion, highlighted some issues addressed in the report that they believe are still pertinent, that can be revisited, complemented and reinterpreted. They are reproduced here, as they encapsulate many of the questions and approaches taken world-wide to address learning to live together. 1. What is education and what is the purpose of education? Today, as during the formulation of the Delors report, the main purposes of education are to: develop key competences that are based more on the ability to learn than on the accumulation of learning; accept and learn about complexity, in particular to accept that there are multiple identities, and to move from a way of thinking of oneself as opposed to the 'other' or others to a vision of belonging, of participation. 2. New ways of learning: the Delors Commission touched on many of the new ways of learning, through new communications media, through expansion of the notion of educational institutions beyond the boundaries of space and time. However, the intervening years have seen on the one hand advances in brain research that have enabled a better understanding on the ways and diversity of learning, and on the other, the influence of the way people live on how they learn. Current research in using a kind of reverse anthropomorphism in describing human behaviours and under standing in terms of how computers create and manage knowledge is acknowledged as a promising avenue. 3. Pedagogy is contextual to age and subject: what is universal is the need for learning and institutional environments that foster inclusion and that provide support. 4. We continue to live in a world of shifting definitions of what is knowledge and who defines authoritative knowledge. This is a subject under a big tent: it covers new methods of knowledge creation (collaborative, international, bypassing traditional institutions). It looks at the relationship, or antago nism between information and knowledge. It moves into understanding how people acquire, assimilate and disseminate what they learn and thus calls forth new paradigms of learning, new methods of communication, evolving roles of young people from absorbers of information to actors and agents of social change. A sub-theme here is that Western black and white, dichotomous ways of looking at truth and reality are not the only ways of doing things. Hybridisation emerges as the process of overcoming a binary mode of organising representations and of fostering true intercultural dialogue. 5. Unsurprisingly, diversity remains a central notion for the organisation of educational institutions and the organisation of learning. Learning in general and learning to live together in particular must be built on a foundation that values, celebrates, respects and promotes diversity. ? 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation ? 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="10">158 European Journal of Education 6. Identity and behaviours: already mentioned above, the question of identity is central to learning to live together. Both the Delors report and the Lisbon seminar emphasised the need to treat the question of identity on the one hand with respect for the particular needs and aspirations of groups, and on the other with emphasis on the complex nature of the identity of both individuals and groups. People have multiple identities, and commu nities are complex, made up of individuals from very different types of backgrounds. Integrity, honesty, and sensitivity need to be brought to bear. 7. Changing frontiers of who is a 'native' and who is an 'immigrant': these notions have migrated from the physical world to the virtual one. Natives and immigrants can be related to national or other physical boundaries, or to new competences. We can all be both at home and strangers in different ways: geographically, culturally, technologically. So, the notion of authentic nationals and new or adopted nationals is somewhat outdated, with con sequences for the organisation of learning processes. 8. The previous point leads directly to a related one of perspective: who holds the perspective on reality, the past, and why today's world is the way it is? How is this perspective communicated, through teaching of history and science, for example? Who defines what are the facts and what is the 'truth'? In conclusion, as the Delors report pointed out, education is central to learning to live together, but it is not a panacea: education cannot operate in a vacuum, and even in a good environment, it cannot do everything. There is no quick answer, no simple answer, and probably no answer that is broadly scalable. Every country has its history of pedagogical, organisational, personal, and ideological battles that have developed a fragile equilibrium between society, users and policy-makers. Solutions to problems are laboriously developed, heatedly discussed, and imple mented according to the prevailing political and societal power balance. The Way Forward An analytical reflection on educational systems and their successes in contributing to learning to live together through curriculum and specific teaching gives mixed results. Europe for decades felt it had a monopoly on harmony and tolerance, communicated partly through education systems. As new tensions emerge even in the educated societies of the wealthy economies, one can be justified in thinking that this question needs to be revisited. What are the strongest factors in the formal learning process that irrigate the development of durable attitudes and behaviours of living together? The European Union is well into its 2008 Year of Intercultural Dialogue, with a strong focus on education: but one cannot help but note that the intensity of activity is not high. On the other hand, the flagship EU Lifelong Learning Programme is testimony to the powerful desire of young people and of university teachers to know the world beyond their borders: Erasmus alone now supports 150,000 students a year and nearly 21,000 post-secondary teachers. The first, crucial, step to living together is contact. Here, as elsewhere, one of the biggest challenges is equal access, so that inequality is not reinforced by well meaning policies that mainly reach those who are already privileged. The 20th anniversary of the Erasmus Programme, celebrated in Portugal during the Portu guese presidency of the EU, set a high ambition for taking Erasmus to a new level ? 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation ? 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="11">Roberto Carneiro &amp; Alexandra Draxler 159 by promoting 'debate on . . . the importance of widening the social base for the mobility of students in Europe. To further build upon the success of the ERASMUS programme will require active social policies to enable lower income students to access the opportunities for international mobility. To achieve such an objective it is necessary to engage national policies with European Community objectives and to forge partnerships with both the public and private sector in the participating countries'.8 OECD carried out a landmark project over several years entitled DeSeCo (Definition and Selection of Competencies: Theoretical and Con ceptual Foundations).9 In this respect, we advocate European Information Society policies that aim at a complete value chain climbing from raw data to information, knowledge, learn ing and meaning-making bridging the gulf between information access, knowledge gaps, learning inequalities and meaning-making disparities. META META META META DATA INFOMttTON KNOWLEDGE LEARNING A truly inclusive education policy and purposeful learning strategy will overcome traditional dichotomies typical of a segregated long-cycle inspired by an industrial mode of organising school systems.10 Learning to live together can and will come alive only when learning practices allow ascending from simple to complex thinking, from the science of quantities to the science of qualities, from education as a product to learning as a service. On this note, we can come back to the Delors report's central message and imagine challenges and a way forward in three main policy areas: ? Education policies that value learning to live together in every aspect of the organisation of learning. We have alluded to this throughout, and this means organisation of the school, of the teaching and learning processes, and of the testing system. ? 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation ? 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</page><page sequence="12">160 European Journal of Education ? Teacher training that helps teachers learn how to foster the acquisition of competences based on a desire to live together in respect. ? Expansion of encouragement, opportunities and rewards for students to participate in out-of-school experiences (exchange, volunteerism, peer teaching) that contribute to learning together. As stated in the beginning of this article and in the introduction to the Delors report, there are no easy answers, but the challenge is fundamental both to individual development and to that of society. No single effort will reach the goal, but every effort, however small, is a building block of our common humanity. NOTES 1.
