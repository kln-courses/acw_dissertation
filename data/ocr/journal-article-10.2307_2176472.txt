<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW"TS OF BOOKS. The World and the Individual. [Gifford Lectures, University of Aberdeen.] Second Series. Nature, Man, and the Moral Order. By JOSIAH ROYCE. New York, The Macmillan Company; London, Macmillan &amp; Co., I90I.-PP. XX, 480. In this volume Professor Royce develops the general theory of Being elaborated in the first series of Gifford Lectures, by applying it to a number of particular problems that arise in connection with human experience as human. The sub-title of the book indicates the general character of the problems taken up: Nature, Man, and the Moral Order. For the purposes of review, at least, we may sub-divide Mr. Royce's discussion somewhat differently, putting together the first three chapters under the head of the explanation of certain phases of our intellectual organization of experience; grouping chapters four and five together as an account of nature as such; and placing the last five under the general heading of the self and the individual with special reference to the moral problems involved. The modulation between these divisions, however, is subtle, and, in particular, throughout the discussion of the self there is a continuous blending of the treatment of the individual as related to nature on one side, and to moral action on the other. The primary problem as to intellectual experience is to justify, in spite of particular facts to the contrary, the conception that it is a revelation, however mysterious, fragmentary, and illegible in detail, of the unity which is whole, perfect, and absolute, a unity in which Being is entirely identified with Meaning. The problem is constituted by the fact that our experience is decidedly limited, not complete; that in it meaning is divorced from being; and that such meanings or ideas as we have, seem to be resisted and determined by facts which are alien, stubbornly resistant, and compulsory-where meaning seems to be determined by a reality which is anything but mean- ing. The solution of the problem is in the recognition that this stubborn other does not resist and force our will and meaning, in so far as they are genuine and adequate, but because of their limita- tions and fragmentariness. Through the very resistance is furnished the material of a fuller purpose and a completer realization. Our recognition of facts is not a matter of taking note of something wholly outside us, but is rather an acknowledgment by will of its own basis</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 393 or presuppositions, and of what is necessary to its own completeness. Or, "a fact, then, is at once that which my present will implies and presupposes, and that which, for this very reason, is in some aspect Other than what I find myself here and now producing, accomplish- ing, attaining " (p. 28). Hence the twofold aspect of facts as experi- enced by us. Their most universal character is " a synthesis of their so-called ' stubborn ' or ' foreign ' character, with their equally genuine character as expressions of our own purpose " (p. 30). Reality is to us an ' Ought.' It is that which the will ought to recognize; but 'ought' no more here than in morality is identical with coercion. That which the will ought to recognize is just its own complete self. The particular facts which seem to limit, constrain, and determine us, thereby enable " us even now to accomplish our will better than we could if we did not acknowledge these facts " (p. 41). Here is the possibility of reconciling empiricism with idealism. The present will or meaning, being limited, must continually wait upon instruction from beyond its present self in order to find out what it really is; it cannot anticipate in detail, much less mould the world of fact to its own present mean- ing. But the start is with meaning, and every fact empirically won serves in the further appreciation of what Meaning really means. It depends upon and points to a perfected embodiment of idea in reality. And this is idealism. In carrying out the principle of learning from the Other, what our own will is or means, we find ourselves committed to the principle of putting to one side for the time our present purpose, and devoting our- selves to its completion through the search for fact as such. This search manifests itself in the act of attention which discriminates. The act of attention distinguishes for us the fact which is just now acknowledged, from the " rest of the universe." But this distinction does not isolate. The very discrimination of the present fact implies that we also acknowledge in a general way the rest of the universe as real. Our interest is partial, but this very partiality implies that in the very withdrawal of attention it still acknowledges the rest of the universe as there, and hence as something which ought to be attended to. " And every least shifting of our conscious momentary attention is one of the small steps whereby we continually undertake to make good the original sin, as it were, with which our form of consciousness is beset" (p. 58). Hence we get a series of discriminations. Each act of attention is discrete, but it implies a further succession of attentions or discrimi- nations in which its own deficiences shall be made good. It demands</page><page sequence="3">394 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XI. continuity, though the only way in which it can reach it is through the discrete points of a series. Hence all discrimination takes the form also of classification or relationship. We attempt to find something which is ' between' the two discrete terms with which we are dealing, in virtue of which they may be identified. So far as this search suc- ceeds, the succession of our acts finds itself expressed in an objective series which becomes a complex order-system. We have law precisely because within the series of changes " some definable characters of the objects that are undergoing the transformation do not vary " (p. 94); Facts that are thus related to one another as an ordered series of dis- crete elements constitute the World of Description. It is an abstract, not a real world, just because in this process of discriminations we have set aside for the time the will or purpose (whose active acknowledg- ment constitutes the World of Appreciation, not Description), and set ourselves simply to finding the possible contents of some or any will. Because of this abstractness the objects of the World of Description may be stated in any order, while the acts of a will of necessity present themselves in an irreversible series. But the world of discriminated and ordered facts nevertheless presupposes the will to discriminate. The objective world of the scientist, however free within itself of any consecutive series of realized purposes, still presupposes the volitional series of acts by which the scientist observes and constructs it. We thus have reason at least for suspecting that the series of contents which the descriptive attitude is endeavoring to make into a continuum by interpolating connecting links, is after all but an image or reflex of the world of self-representative acts in which a complete will expresses itself. The conception that the world of facts is present as the object of attention, meets a difficulty in the character of time. How can the past and the future be in any sense present? The key to the reply is found in the fact that even in perceptual time, in time as actually ex- perienced by us, there is given a serial whole within which are distin- guished time differences of former and latter. A succession comes to us as a present whole, present in the sense that it is known all at once. Our time experience is not that of a mathematically indivisible instant, but rather of a passage or transition from predecessors to successors. Suc- cession is a movement from something towards its desired fulfillment. " Our temporal form of experience is thus peculiarly the form of the Will as such. . . . Every part of a succession is present in so far as when it is, that which is no longer, and that which is not yet, both of them stand in essentially significant relations to this present" (pp.</page><page sequence="4">No. 4.] RE VIE WS OF BOOKS. 395 124-I25). Conceptual time, the world as a temporal succession, pre- sents exactly the same features. " We conceive the past as leading towards, as aiming in the direction of the future, in such wise that the future depends for its meaning upon the past, and the past in its turn has its meaning as a process expectant of the future " (p. I32). Time as such is finite, because it marks the movement of the imper- fect towards its own perfection. But the temporal world as a whole is at the same time an eternal world. A finite idea must appear as essentially temporal because in its very fragmentariness it is aiming or moving towards its own completion. But since the fulfillment exists, since indeed the nature of being is to be fulfillment, the tem- poral world is present as completely realized to the absolute, and in this complete presentation is eternal. In a temporal process as such each event of the series excludes former and latter elements. But all the members of an " experienced succession are at once to any conscious- ness which observes the whole succession as a whole " (pp. I38-I39). 'By the nature of the case, the entire temporal succession is present to the Absolute, and hence the absolute experience does, for all time, what our consciousness does for some portion of time; it has pre- sented to it at once all distinctions of past, present, and future. The eternal order is thus nothing essentially different from the temporal; it is just the essential order in its entirety, taken as known once for all by the Absolute. As already stated, the World of Description is the result of our attempt, when were cognize the inadequate content of our will, to find out how the will is expressed in the facts of universal experience. The World of Appreciation is our recognition of what it is our will even now seeks. We learn that our will demands not merely contents to be appreciated, but other wills than ours. Hence the World of Descrip- tion is never a whole truth: it must be interpreted in terms of the World of Appreciation.' I I do not find, however, in Professor Royce's discussion, any basis for a distinc- tion between the problem of what our will intends, and how the will is expressed. To know what the will intends is precisely to know how it is embodied. This is the very point of the distinction and relation of the inner and outer meaning. The World of Description arises (see particularly page 3IO) just because not knowing enough of our purpose we cannot set about directly expressing it. On the other hand, the criterion that he sets up for the reality of persons, viz.: that our fellows furnish us with a needed supplement to our own meanings, that they are local centers for imparting meanings to us (pp. I 72-I74), holds equally well of all our knowledge of, and intercourse with, objects. According to this theory, either all things ought to be persons (because they too are embodiments of meanings which help make up the fulfillment), or else all persons ought to be things-simply supplementary agencies in filling out the meaning already partially possessed by us.</page><page sequence="5">396 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XI. Our belief in the reality of nature " is inseparably bound up with our belief in the existence of our fellow-men " (pp. I65-i66). Na- ture is the common realm of human experience: the real object is sim- ply that which is common to my fellow and myself. It is thus essen- tially a social tool-that which serves as the common basis of definite acts of cooperation. The so-called rigidly uniform natural laws are just more generalized means of conceiving and socially communicating definite plans of action. The discovery of mechanical laws of nature has been a condition for the organization of definite social customs. Because we conceive nature as a socially significant tool, then that aspect of nature in which it is most serviceable socially, viz., that of suggesting unvarying laws, has come to be taken as an essential char- acteristic of nature. This mechanical conception then is no axiom, or even an empirically established generalization; it possesses its present authority because of our social interest in discovering uniformity as the basis of social cooperation. We must guard ourselves against letting this social interest blind us to other aspects of nature, or make us believe that nature is simply and only an unvarying uniformity. To regard nature as just a treasure-house of purely mechanical laws, is to be anthropomorphic-it is to take our social need as final. In discovering the human motive which is at the basis of our assump- tion of mechanical law, we soften the ordinary dualism between mind and matter. The conception of evolution still further breaks down this dualism. Evolution bridges the apparent gulf between mind and matter, and thereby forces upon us the question: what is the real link that unites these extremes ? Professor Royce begins his answer to this question by pointing out that the laws of our World of Description are not literal truths of experience, but ideal constructions, " convenient conceptions whereby we summarize observed facts " (pp. 2 I 5-2 I 6). They are in marked contrast with some other generalizations that are literal statements-such as that an organism grows old but never grows young. A significant difference between these symbolic and literal laws is that the former describe reversible processes, the latter irre- versible. The former are true of matter only; while laws of irrever- sible processes are common to matter and to mind. It is in the region of the abstract and ideal constructions that we find the difference be- tween mind and matter emphasized; it is in the more literal, actual, and directly observable ones that we find a process common to material and mental phenomena. Secondly, both material and mental facts involve a tendency of one part to communicate with another. Ideas assimilate other ideas; in material nature the so-called wave move-</page><page sequence="6">No. 4.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 397 ments institute a like propagation. Again, both the material and the mental worlds show a tendency to the formation of habits. Physical nature tends to fall into rhythms. These rhythms, however, are not absolutely permanent; if we take a long enough time span, they pass away or decay. It is suggested that apparently fixed natural proc- esses have after all only the same relative stability which habits have in conscious beings. Perhaps the inner nature of things is not so much ideally constant as merely relatively stable, so that in the fluent life of our consciousness, we directly know a process of which the apparently absolute stability of the conceived material process is really only an- other instance, whose inner fluency is concealed from us by the longer intervals of time. demanded for important changes to take place (p. 223). Finally, the process of evolution itself is common to both mental and material nature. The outcome of these four points of community is to suggest an impression and an hypothesis. The impression is that the contrast ordinarily made between material and conscious processes " depends merely upon the accidents of the human point of view " (p. 224). The hypothesis is that the material processes in their reality are just as conscious as are those which go on in ourselves; but go on at such different rates from ours that there is no free communication between theirs and ours. Nature is to be regarded as the phenomenal sign of a vast conscious process; a finite consciousness in which, as in our own, there is a play between habit and novelty; between the irrevo- cable which is left behind, and the repeated or persistent. On this basis, the " fluent inner experience,which our hypothesis attributes to inorganic Nature would be a finite experience of an extremely august temporal span, so that a material region of the inorganic world would be to us the phenomenal sign of the presence of at least one fellow- creature who took, perhaps, a billion years to complete a moment of his consciousness, so that where we saw, in the signs given us of his presence, only monotonous permanence of fact, he, in his inner life, faced momentarily significant change " (p. 228). Evolution is then interpreted as due "to the constant intercommunication of a vast number of relatively separate regions of this world of conscious life" (p. 229). Every natural process, viewed from within, is the pursuit of an ideal. Hence there is no dead or merely material nature, and no evolution of mind out of matter. There is simply intercommunication through which elements or facts that are novel in our experience arise. This continual reception and transmission occasions what we shall call</page><page sequence="7">398 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XI. growth or development. " The essence of this Doctrine of Evolution lies in the fact that it recognizes the continuity of man's life with that of an extra human realm, whose existence is hinted to us by our ex- perience of Nature " (p. 242).1 This brings us to our second main division-the human self. Pro- fessor Royce begins by calling attention: (i) to the ambiguity of traditional doctrines about the self, seen on one side in exaltations of its dignity and value, and on the other in depreciations of it through assertions of its ' selfishness' and need of regeneration; and (2) to the variability of selfhood as actually and empirically known, its change from day to day and almost from moment to moment. This am- biguity in theory, and instability in fact, the author finds to originate in the fact that empirical self-consciousness depends upon a series of contrast-effects bound up with our social experience. The individ- ual defines himself through the contrast of his own desires and aims with those of others who enter into the same social situations with him. Thus, as the other elements vary, the self varies. The ambiguity in the theoretical view is due to the fact that the present self is, as finite, essentially fragmentary; it needs to be fulfilled in the absolute self which is its own unity. The empirical principle of contrast-effects is given a rational or philosophical meaning by recog- nizing that, in all its diverse and chaotic changes, the self is struggling to possess or create some one principle, some finally significant con- 1 It may be said that we have here the basis of discrimination between persons and things which was declared in the previous note to be lacking: the ' person' is that the time rate of whose mental process is sufficiently like our own to enable us to enter into direct communication with it; the ' thing' belongs to some consciousness whose time rate is disparate from our own. This may be so; but then what becomes of the previous elaborate development of the World of Description through serially recurrent discriminative acts, and of distinction of it from the World of Appreciation as that which being common to different consciousnesses, serves as a basis for coop- eration among them? I do not, however, consider myself a competent critic here; this whole doctrine of ' nature' is too high for me; I cannot attain unto it. To be frank, I do not believe that such speculative constructions, with no further basis than certain vague analogies, involving also the highly precarious proposition that certain ' truths' about irreversible processes are much more literal and actual in their objec- tive validity than are mechanical laws, do anything but bring philosophy into disrepute. It is, I believe, this sort of thing which encourages in the man of science, as well as in the man of common sense, the too common notion about metaphysics. In any case, it is not clear what entitles Professor Royce suddenly to turn his back upon ideal constructions and fall back upon literal experiences-seeing that his whole theory of Being is based upon discounting literal experiences as fragmentary, mere hints, glimpses, etc., etc., in favor of what, for our type of consciousness, must be, and must remain, a wholly ideal construction.</page><page sequence="8">No. 4.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 399 trast, which shall mark it off from all others. The most stable feature of the empirical Ego is just the general fact of contrast-the will to be different, or to be unique. The true self, in the Absolute, is a sig- nificantly different meaning or purpose contrasted with that of every other. Hence in the world of Absolute Being, each retains its own individuality distinct from other selves, yes, even distinct from the Absolute self. Our life plans are mutually contrasting life plans, and each can reach its own fulfillment only by recognizing this contrast both for one's self and for others. Except in the variety of unique meanings or wills the absolute will or meaning cannot exist. As finite, we are longings of which God is the conscious satisfaction; but conscious fulfillment in turn presupposes conscious longing. The divine completion demands our incompletion. A goal which is not the goal of a process is meaningless (pp. 299-304]5assim, p. 308). Having thus determined the place of the self in Absolute Being, Professor Royce turns to its place in the temporal world, with special ref- erence to the problem of the emergence of new selves. The problem is the appearance of new life purposes. In explanation, Professor Royce recurs to the theory of discriminative attention by which new members are continually interpolated as intermediates between two extremes (whose unity is sought), so that a series is constructed. The empir- ical self in order to define itself, discriminates others from self and self from others. This happens only through imitation. But imita- tion is neither mere reiteration by the agent of his previous will or self, nor is it a mere repetition of the imitated self. It is a third construction of a new self, which, having assimilated to itself some- thing from both the previous self and the other, lies, so to speak, be- tween them. Thus the historical individual is a series of results of intermediation by which relatively unrelated selves are made more related. Professor Royce then makes "the wholly tentative hypothesis that the process of evolution of new forms of consciousness in Nature is throughout of this same general type" (p. 3I5). That is, the ap- pearance of new selves in nature is the same sort of thing as is the appearance of new modes of self-definition within the same finite self. " Sexual generation is analogous to the process of conscious imita- tion " (p. 3I5), while the process of asexual generation is like that type of human action in which the individual, having a definite pur- pose already in mind, tries it on experimentally without imitation. We need only suppose that some of the intermediary terms resulting from the discriminating process become conscious not merely of their</page><page sequence="9">400 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XI. place in the temporal series, but of their relation in the Absolute, to appreciate how the discriminated contents might appear as new selves. For in such case they will " define their own lives as individually sig- nificant, conceive their goal as the Absolute" (p. 321). As meanings relating to the Absolute, they survive the finite experimental purposes for which they were originated.' We now come to the distinctive moral problem. The postulates of a moral order are: ( i ) the freedom of the self in choosing; ( 2 ) hence the reality of moral badness as well as of goodness-for otherwise there can be no alternatives, no choice; (3) the possibility of real improvement in the objective order through the right choice of the individual-for unless the choice makes a real difference in things there can be no true freedom. But how can choice, real evil, and the making of things better or worse, really exist in a world which is eter- nally present as complete to an Absolute Being? In such a world, must not every apparent choice be really an act eternally done and known in the Absolute, just as it is, with no possibility of its being otherwise? In such a world, it would seem either that there is no evil, or that evil is a means by which the Absolute wins its own per- fection, and hence is in no sense the doing of the individual. The principle of solution for these difficulties is found in " the true distinction and the true connection, between the temporal and the eter- nal aspects of Being " (p. 347). The finite self seeks but does not know the Absolute, which, accordingly, appears as its other. Two courses are consequently open to the fragmentary self. It may undertake to win its own unity either by obeying the world beyond, or by subjugating that to its own present narrowness. Instead of seeking perfection in rational obedience to the law of the Absolute, it may seek rather to master the world in terms of its own fragmentary insight and inten- tion. It may then either expand into the larger whole, or endeavor to narrow the latter into its own petty compass. Here is the choice which gives significance to good and evil. I One can hardly refrain from a question. Since by the theory every meaning is conscious, and is related to the Absolute, how does it happen that some are conscious of their relation, and thus set up, on their own account, as new finite selves; while others are unaware of this relation, and are thus taken as terms within some finite self ? Surely, all meanings as temporal are on the same plane; and all as in the eternal are on the same plane. Why then this invidious distinction: why do some re- main only temporal as to their consciousness, while others succeed in gaining a con- sciousness in relation to the eternal ? Moreover, the distinctive self is conscious of itself only in its own serial terms. Why do not such terms then segregate themselves and appear as ' persons' ? Professor Royce seems to have no criterion of distinction between a ' self' and its own ' states.'</page><page sequence="10">No. 4.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 40I The possibility of choice is involved in the nature of attention. In so far as we attend to the ought, we can but act upon it. The essence of attention is to unite knowledge and deed. But attention involves inattention, and we may choose to ignore, to forget the Ought that is recognized. Attention can be fixed upon the private self; in exclud- ing the ought from our attention, we prevent its direct influence upon our action. And this ignoring and forgetting is sin. Although ig- norance, it is evil for it is voluntarily chosen; it comes from the will to forget (pp. 357-359_passim).1 To the objection that even the sinful act must contribute to the perfection of God, and being unique is fulfilled in the whole in a way for which no other will could provide a substitute, Professor Royce replies by returning to the definition of the temporal and the eternal order. All the temporal or finite facts as such are evil, since, " taken in themselves," they have no adequate meaning, and hence leave us search- ing and dissatisfied. But such searching, and hence such finite evil is necessary, because without it there can be no consciousness of finding and of fulfillment, no Absolute. But surely if a finite fact is evil, then it can work more evil. While this evil must be undone in the Abso- lute, yet this undoing does not flow from the evil itself, but from other wills (either of the same agent or of some other self) to thwart, and atone, and make good the evil. And while the good thus attained is doubtless higher than the good that would have existed had there been no evil, yet it comes about not because of the evil will, but because of some other will which recognizes what the evil will denies (pp. 365- 366 _passim).2 I This seems to be an unusually naive begging of the question. The premise is that attention is " an act by which we come to know a truth, and an act by which we are led to an outward deed " (p. 355). The idea is a nascent deed ; attend to it and it becomes a completed deed. Yet, Professor Royce assumes that there is no evil un- less the Ought has been known and recognized. To recognize it, however, is cer- tainly to be attentive to it. How then can we avoid acting upon it? Why, replies Professor Royce, just by being inattentive, by forgetting; we cannot get directly from attention to non-action, but we can get from attention to non-action through forgetting ! But how forget? How escape from attention? It would seem to be a philosophical principle that what a given concept forbids cannot be secured simply by changing its name. 2Two significant difficulties appear here. First, how can the finite will, in any particular case, distinguish between the act which carries it towards fulfillment, and that which narrows and limits it? It is our former difficulty: all acts are on the same plane qua temporal, and on the same qua eternal, while Professor Royce seems to take one act as merely temporal and another as merely eternal. And this suggests the second difficulty: How can any finite will be really good, if all the temporal and finite as such is evil? The distinction between the temporal order and the eternal</page><page sequence="11">402 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XI. In lecture nine, Professor Royce considers the struggle with evil, particularly with reference to our consolation in this struggle, and its bearing upon the virtues of courage, endurance, resignation, and hope. He discusses particularly two aspects of the problem. As already stated, the finite and temporal life is, as such, essentially more or less dissatisfied, and so evil. Hence, dissatisfaction is the universal experi- ence of every temporal being. As also already stated, the very pres- ence of ill in the temporal order is the condition of the perfection of the eternal order. " Were there no longing in Time there would be no peace in Eternity " (p. 386). Our comfort in the struggle is thus in realizing that the sorrows of our finitude are identically God's own sorrows, and have their purpose and meaning in the divine life as such significant sorrows; and in the assurance that God's fulfillment in the the eternal order-a fulfillment in which we share-is to be won through the very bitterness of tribulation. We may know that God sorrows in and with us, and that this sorrowing contributes somehow to the ultimate perfection. The other aspect of the problem is that the concrete contents of our suffering are the outcome of some in- dividual's finite will. " Morally evil deeds, and the ill fortune of mankind, are inseparably linked aspects of the temporal order " (p. 389). Our suffering from the results of other wills (unknown to us, and many of them doubtless extra-human) is thus a sign of our or- ganic participation in a realm of infinite experiences in which infinite meanings are realized. And if this fact brings us sorrow, it also brings us comfort and courage. Unless one can harm another, he cannot help him; and where an individual can neither harm nor help, no signifi- cant moral task is possible. On such a basis, moral life would be a mere cultivation of " a purely vain and formal piety, as empty as it is ineffectual " (p. 403). To suffer the consequences of another's ill deed, is, if rightly interpreted, an occasion for rejoicing: in it we may " discover at least one case where our own share in the atoning work of our common humanity is clearly laid before me " (p. 392). The final chapter discusses the union of God and man. In general, this is simply a summary of the previous discussion, especially in terms of the relation of the temporal and the eternal, with a further order, which Professor Royce holds to be the key to the whole problem, is a distinc- tion in toto. It applies equally to each and every act. To admit that the eternal can be realized in one fragmentary passing finite meaning, and hence make it good or better, while it is absolutely indispensable for any distinction between one idea as truer or falser than another, one act better or worse than another, is to introduce a principle which involves a complete revision of Professor Royce's fundamental notion of Absolute Being.</page><page sequence="12">No. 4.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 403 account of its bearing upon the question of human immortality. As in what I have to say in criticism I shall connect with the former of these points, I here take up simply the question of immortality. The finite union with the Absolute, the fact that the eternal is but the tem- poral process known as a whole, carries with it as a necessary conse- quence an immortal individual life. Individuality cannot be attained in our present finite form of consciousness. We are real individuals only in the Absolute. Hence we must be conscious of selfhood in him, "in a form higher than that now accessible to us " (p. 445). Secondly, the very nature of death, in a universe of the type ideal- istically defined by Professor Royce, implies immortality. The signifi- cance of death is the passing away or defeat of a purpose or meaning before that meaning is worked out to its completeness, or is expressed with its intended individual wholeness. But every real fact is a con- scious fact, and hence a defeated purpose must be known as such. It can be known only by some conscious being who can say: this was my purpose, but temporally I no longer seek its embodiment. And this once more means " that whoever dies with his meanings unex- pressed, lives as individual, to see, in the eternal world, just his unique meaning finally expressed in a life sequent to the life that death terminated " (p. 445). In other words, the whole individual must realize the defeated purpose as an incident in his own life, and in the fulfillment of his own true purpose. In the third place, the task set upon the individual, that of performing his unique function in the absolute, is not a task which can ever be brought to an end. There is always meaning to be realized, for every new action creates a new situation which calls for a new deed. The final summary of the whole doctrine is that "despite God's absolute unity we as individuals preserve and attain our unique lives and meanings, and are not lost in the very life that sustains us, and that needs us as its own expression. This life is real through us all; and we are real through our union with that life " (p. 452). I confess to a certain embarrassment in concluding this review. It is absurd to attempt to criticize a subtle and comprehensive philosoph- ical argument of four hundred and fifty pages in a few lines of a magazine article. To attempt it puts one in the role of a carping fault-finder. And yet Professor Royce's book, just because of its fundamental character, compels searchings of heart. One cannot read it without the stirring either of assent or dissent, and without some striving to formulate the reasons for assent or dissent. In my own case, I find the net result to be a dissent as profound as is the mheta-</page><page sequence="13">404 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XI. physical theory of Being which Professor Royce presents to us. And so I shall close with a brief statement of this dissent, not as a criticism of Professor Royce, but as an expression of my own reaction. In my review of his previous volume (PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW, Vol. IX, pp. 3 i i f.), I said in effect that Professor Royce seemed to me to be attempting a self-contradictory task. On the one hand, the frag- mentariness, the transitoriness of our actual experience is magnified; this is the essence of the method by which the definition of the Abso- lute is reached, and it affords, by contrast, the content of the defini- tion of the Absolute. On the other hand, some kind of organic rela- tionship is constantly supposed between the Absolute and the finite, between the complete and the fragmentary, in virtue of which alone some meaning is attachable to the latter. Without such identity, there is no basis for ascribing any valuable qualitative content to the finite. The Absolute as Absolute must, after all, include the fragmentary, and hence the fragmentary cannot be really fragmentary. Professor Royce's phrase "taken in itself" as applied to the finite is at most question-begging. Recognizing that doubtless much of his present volume has escaped me, and that my own mental medium has doubt- less distorted something of what remains, I am still bound to say that my most careful study of the new volume has only strongly rein- forced my conviction of the contradiction inherent in the old. On page 4I7 he speaks of an " ontological relation that, when rightly viewed is seen to link yourself even in all your weakness, to the very life of God, and the whole universe to the meaning of every Individual. " He says, " not only in spite then of our finite bondage, but because of what it means and implies, we are full of the presence and the freedom of God. " Grant all this, and what becomes of the finitude and fragmen- tariness of which Professor Royce makes so much ? An Absolute which enters organically into the " fragmentary " consciousness is one which gives that fragmentary consciousness present and immediate (temporal) absolute significance. Truth to tell, Professor Royce has all the time two fragmentaries: one the fragmentary as it is in us, the other as it is in his Absolute. And he vibrates back and forth between them. On one side, he says the final meaning of our experience " can sim- ply never be expressed in the type of experience which we men now have at our disposal " (p. 266). And again, " the true individual Self of any man gets its final expression in some form of consciousness difer- ent from that which we men now possess " (p. 269). And again, " in God, every individual self, however insignificant its temporal endurance may seem, eternally possesses aform of consciousness that is wholly other</page><page sequence="14">No. 4.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 405 than this our present flickering form of mortal consciousness" 1 (p. 435, italics mine in each case). In all these cases, it is a different type or form of consciousness which is asserted. The whole burden of at least one half the volume is this radical transcendence of the finite con- sciousness by the Absolute. And, on the other hand, this finite con- sciousness is and must be already in the Absolute, and the Absolute already in it. Professor Royce's entire metaphysics seems to me per- meated with this illusion of double vision, of reduplication. Take such a passage as that on page 381, "Any temporal fact, as such, is essentially more or less dissatisfying, and so evil. . . . In Time there is for the will, no conscious satisfaction," and contrast it with these passages from pages 4I Iand 427. "For our temporal life is the very expression of the eternal triumph"; and again, " Here and now, . . . is the temporal expression of a value that is unique, and that would be missed as a lost perfection of the eternal world if it were not known to God as just this finite striving. The temporal brevity of the incident is here no barrier to its eternal significance. " Professor Royce seems to have two minds about time and two about eternity. On one side, the temporal process in each and every phase is equally fragmen- tary and finite. The eternal is simply the temporal process taken as an object of knowledge all at once. Here there is no organic rela- tionship between eternity and any particular temporal portion. The other view is that the meaning of the whole time process somehow manifests itself in every member of the process. Each part of experi- ence has an eternal meaning, because it really embodies in its own significance the meaning of all others, being linked to them in the Absolute. Consider the "melody " metaphor which Professor Royce employs so much. A melody is not a present whole just because after it has been sung or played, we recall to ourselves the fact that all its successive notes make one melody. " The present knowledge of the whole " (p. 4I 8), does not constitute the melody as melody. Otherwise the knowl- edge of any conceivable series of noises would constitute a melody just the moment it becomes the object of a single cognitive act. What makes the melody a melody is precisely that no note is "fragmen- tary, " but each somehow carries within its own meaning, as each is ex- perienced in succession, the meaning of all the other notes. To apply the metaphor in any consistent way to human experience as a temporal process, would involve the rewriting of every sentence in which Pro- ' And yet our consciousness is immortal, and yet again no temporal moment is any better than any other !</page><page sequence="15">406 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XI. fessor Royce has taken the ' finitude' of our experience as indicative of some experience which is of another type or form. The notes simply do not make a melody in some other consciousness than that which is of them as they come and go. Such other type of conscious- ness is a bare symbol, a reminiscence that once such and such a melody was present to us in its own vital and dynamic change. And so Pro- fessor Royce's Absolute seems to me a mere pallid and formal symbol of the actual wealth and concreteness of experience as it is actually experienced. The likeness and the difference of Professor Royce from the German transcendentalists is significant: in certain phases of his doctrine he is close to Fichte, though far enough from Hegel. But even when the likeness in doctrine is greatest, in method the difference is tremendous. The old transcendentalists were at least serious with their theory of the Absolute as the meaning and reality of present experience. They worked out the idea into a logic, a Naturphilosophie, and a philosophy of history. They re-read our actual thinking experience, our actual scientific consciousness, and our actual associative life in detail, in terms of that which gives them their reality. At first sight, Professor Royce, with his willingness to leave all these matters in the region of the em- pirical and the contingent, to be got at casually and fragmentarily, seems to be more modest-to leave more room to the actual, to the empirical scientist. But, after all, this region is left simply because, from the standpoint of the Absolute, it means so little " to us men." Surely when we are dealing with fragments, the mere size of the rub- bish heap hardly matters; nor does permission to go playing freely in it amount to much. The apparently larger concession to and reverence for empirically given elements thus turn out to be mainly nominal. As a result, Professor Royce's own method seems to be essentially for- mal. He is dealing with Being, and with the categories of the finite, of time, of the individual, wholly at large. And not even Professor Royce's comprehensive knowledge and subtle intellect can avoid the unreal and arbitrary character that attaches to concepts which at best are only ' hinted at' by the actual warp and woof of our experience as experience, and which accordingly can be only logically determined. As a consequence, Professor Royce dives arbitrarily from the region of concepts into the chaotic sea of experience, and fishes out here and there just that particular experience which is required at that time to give body and tone to thin and empty categories. Without the psychology of ideo-motor action, of intention, of imitation, without the empirical principle of irreversibility, etc., etc., his constructive thought would</page><page sequence="16">No. 4.] RE VIE WS OF BOOKS. 407 hardly get very far. Not that I object to his use of these empirical elements; quite the contrary. But why take these experiences rather than any other? Either our experiences, yea, even the experiences of 'us men' have ultimate meaning and worth, and the 'Absolute' is only the most adequate possible construing of this meaning; or else, having it not, they are not available to give content to the Absolute. But a difference of form or type between our consciousness and the Absolute, simply once for all makes metaphysical method impossible. JOHN DEWEY. THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO.</page></plain_text>
