Trouble is, today's thick ceramic or plastics protection is so heavy that the troops can barely move. Fortunately, the next generation of armor will benefit from nanotechnology research at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Richard W. Siegel, professor of materials science and engi neering, has created tiny nanoparticles much smaller than any natural substances. Added to a ceramic matrix, the tough but lightweight com posite may one day help rapidly dissipate the energy of bullets, making the projectile nonlethal even if it manages to penetrate the armor. Siegel hopes that the material will be available for use by the end of the decade. 8 RECONSTRUCTING EVIDENCE Discovering how a bomb fragments during an explosion may provide as much evidence as the fingerprints of criminals can. Otto Gregory, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of Rhode Island, is using a high-powered electron microscope to examine fragments of pipe bombs, one of the most common and destructive terrorist tools. By examining the metal fragments after the blast, Gregory hopes to help law enforcement offi cials determine the size and type of explosive used in the devices. 9 DECONTAMINATING THE AIR An old invention may have important new uses. Yogi Goswami, professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Florida, designed an indoor air-cleaning technology in the mid 1990s to help rid buildings with poor ventilation of excessive mold or mildew. Now, with a few alterations, Goswami believes that his photocatalytic air-cleaning system, which uses the interaction between light and chemi cals to destroy spores, could also eliminate airborne anthrax and other dangerous pathogens. The system could be used in cen tral ventilation systems to decontaminate buildings and could also be adapted for use in single-family homes. T h ■■ •:# t GOING WHERE HUMANS CANNOT TREAD In the aftermath of the World Trade Center's collapse, a team of robots was sent into the rubble, dispatched to investigate crevices into which rescue workers could not fit. Robin Murphy, an associate professor of computer science at the University of South Florida, directed these search and recovery robots: luggage-size mechanical objects with bull dozer-like treads. The robots were armed with tiny video cameras, two way audio capabilities, and infrared and thermal sonars in order to locate and assist survivors. The robots could even snake along intra venous tubes through the small pathways. In the absence of survivors, the robots collected pictures of the trade center's basement—which was deemed unsafe for humans—in order to assess structural damage. Murphy believes the robots could one day be used to rescue hostages and perform SWAT team missions in lieu of soldiers.

At the University of Oklahoma, Le Gruenwald, a professor of computer science, and her husband, Hermann Gruenwald, a professor of civil engineering, are helping to create a publicly available Internet database of infor mation about terrorism, including incidents, alleged perpetrators, targets, weaponry, and indictments. These lists could assist local investigators in their search for patterns as they try to identify perpetrators. Information about counter-terrorism technologies and practices could help a community combat a biological attack. The $1.4 million research project is sponsored by the National Institute of Justice through the Oklahoma City National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism. The database will be housed on the Institute's Web site at www.mipt.org. FEBRUARY 2002 KEEPING WALLS FROM TUMBLING DOWN Finding economical ways to bolster walls when buildings fall to pieces is the goal of the University of Missouri-Columbia's National Center for Explosion Resistant Design. Sam Kiger, the center's director, believes that non-load-bearing concrete walls common in most con temporary office buildings could be sprayed with a polyurethane liner like the kind used in truck beds. In the event of an explosion, the strong, flexible material could prevent debris from flying about. In walls with steel studs, found often in home construction, Kiger dis covered that the addition of a single extra screw will nearly double a wall's load capacity, which increases its resilience in case of explosion. The Army has also asked the center to simulate explosions using com puters in order to help improve the design of its facilities. 12 SURFING FOR INFORMATION With the unsettling prospect of random terrorist strikes throughout the country, local fire, police, and rescue crews—and even ordinary citizens—could benefit from a nationwide terrorist-tracking repository.

But detecting land mines is a tricky business because sensors often can't discriminate between harmless and dangerous objects. For instance, metal detectors might positive ly identify bits of shrapnel in the ground while chem ical sniffers mistakenly tag it explosive residue. That's why the Army asked a number of universities to participate in the Flumanitarian Demining Operation and come up with novel solutions. One of the more promising innovations has been developed at the University of Kansas, where James Stiles, an assistant professor of electrical engineering and com puter science, has developed a type of radar that dis tinguishes human-made symmetrical objects from rocks no matter how deep the mine is buried. Although a can or shell next to the mine may still dis tort the symmetry, Stiles believes his technique can help. "No one has a sensor that works perfectly in all situations," he says. "Mine detection is like golf in that you'll need many different kinds of clubs." 14 TURNING UP THE HEAT Designers of protective garb for firefighters have never really been able to ensure that the safety gear is truly safe. Current testing environments can only simulate small scale propane jet fires. But at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Jonathan Barnett, professor of fire protection engineering, has built an 8-foot-by-12-foot testing room that can endure real istic severe fires such as the jet fuel blaze that engulfed the World Trade towers. Now with the abil ity to simulate fires of varying degrees, appropriate protective suits can be designed. The U.S. Navy has contributed $250,000 to the project so it can learn how to better safeguard troops in case of jet fuel fires on aircraft carriers, for instance. 15 REDUCING THE RISK OF FIRE The chances of passengers surviving the crash of a large plane aren't all that great, but Morteza Gharib, a professor of aeronautics and bioengineering at the California Institute of Technology, thinks the collater al damage can be reduced. Gharib, who is working with a team of researchers at the Caltech-affiliated NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, hopes that a poly mer added to jet fuel will transform it into a jelly-like substance that would stick together and not disperse into multiple small fires after a plane crash. The tech nique may also reduce the temperature of a fuel fire so it wouldn't get hot enough to melt the structure of a building, which caused the collapse of the World Trade towers.

Roughly two-thirds of combat-related deaths are due to blood loss. And the age-old technique of applying a tourniquet to stop the gushing causes other prob lems, such as nerve damage. It can also lead to the amputation of a limb from lack of blood. So Gary Wnek, chair of Virginia Commonwealth University's chemical engineering department, has teamed up with VCU's medical school to design a futuris tic tourniquet. A porous but elastic bag as small as a business card holds a diaper-like material. Applied to a wound, the bag soaks up blood, swelling to more than 10 times its original size, and the resulting pressure stems the bleeding temporarily until a solider reaches a medical unit. The research, funded by the Army for $300,000 last spring, has taken on a new urgency with troops in battle abroad. 13 'teeing off on mines From years of warfare, the Afghanistan terrain—like many other strife-tom nations where terrorists tend to lurk—is chock-full of land mines.

When the transportable food is being sterilized in packages, the current methods of using hot water heating or steaming can end up harming the flavor and texture. However, .fuming Tang, associate professor of bio logical systems engineering at Washington State University, has developed an improved system to sterilize MREs by using microwave and radio frequencies. When these tech nologies are perfected, they could allow the military to offer such heat-sensitive, bacteria-prone rations as scrambled eggs along with current entrees like ham or spaghetti. Tang has received $580,000 from the Army and Defense Department to develop the new thermal processing technologies. 20 BUZZING ABOUT The biological makeup of a fly's ears may one day help soldiers avoid surprise sniper attacks. Ronald Miles, chairman of the mechanical engineering department at SUNY-Binghamton, received a $3 million grant from the Defense Department to develop tiny microphones called "ormiaphones" that could be spread across a battlefield or city by American soldiers to detect the movements of enemy troops. The microphone's design is based on a fly's ear, which is able to more accurate ly discern the direction of sound than a human's ear. An early prototype of the microphone measures 1 mil limeter by 2 millimeter; a less superior unit based on current technology is at least the size of a breadbox. 21 I HEALING POWER The body can usually heal from injuries like burns and wounds, but resulting infections can be even more serious than the traumas themselves when left untreated. Georgia Tech professors of chemical engineering Jan Gooch and F. Joseph Schork are developing a "superbandage" for wounded soldiers caught far from medical treatment. After sustaining an injury, a soldier could grab a tube and, much like roll-on deodorant, apply the novel emulsion poly merized gel on the wound to create a transparent protective layer a thousandth of an inch thick. When the gel dries, it attaches to the skin so that only water and oxygen can pass through, not dangerous microorganisms, dirt, or sand. Anti-microbial agents in the gel fight bacteria, viruses, and fungi and promote healing for as long as two weeks. Animal testing is underway and the Army hopes to be able use the gel by next year. USING PDAS TO WIN THE WAR Military generals who once used binoculars and walkie-talkies may soon carry Palm Pilots instead to direct battlefront operations. That's the hope of Eugene Santos, an associate professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Connecticut. He's developing software for an advanced logistics system to give commanders in the field intelligent Palm Pilot-like devices to more easily move supplies and equipment during battle. The management of logistics can make the crucial difference between winning and losing, if for example, armaments or food doesn't end up at the correct location. The Air Force is sponsoring Santos's research. EJECTING TERRORISTS FROM CYBERSPACE Along with protecting public buildings and other facilities, the United States also has to safeguard cyberspace. A computer attack by terrorists could wreak havoc with power grids, communications systems, and financial networks. Raymond Hoare, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Pittsburgh, is one of many researchers nationwide working to design new security systems for local computer networks. By retooling both hardware and software, Hoare has designed a program that would take a snapshot of normal network traffic patterns and monitor them for any deviations, which, for example, occur when a replicating virus begins to attack hard drives. The controls would then shut down the activity and alert network administrators. Hoare hopes to complete the research within 18 months. RESCUING PHONE LINES A devastating terrorist attack on a city that cripples communications could also hin der emergency responses. Charles Bostian, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Virginia Tech, is head of a research team developing a portable wire less network for the exclusive use of emergency personnel. With special equipment placed near a disaster site, rescue workers could utilize a dedicated wireless network inaccessible to the public so that lines wouldn't cross, a phenomenon that made it nearly impossible to use the phone in New York and Washington D.C. on September 11. The communications pipe would be broadband, allowing recovery pros to access the Internet and share checklists, inventories of supplies, and even maps and videos of the situation. The first version, which can broadcast wireless signals over 2 miles, could be ready for testing during this month's Winter Olympics. But Bostian hopes to eventually improve the range to 10 miles. PLAYING WAR GAMES During the Cold War, American military theorists simulated nuclear war on com puters. But defending against terrorists makes those old war-game assumptions obsolete. That's why Boris Stilman, a computer science and engineering professor at the University of Colorado-Denver, has created new software to help the military prepare for the battles to come. Stilman's software incorporates a variety of factors that would be relevant during a war against terrorism, including information on Army resources and geography. The software uses game theory and mathematical algorithms to find winning strategies. The program's other potential applications could help government and businesses practice decision making during crises like hurricanes or bombings.

EATING RIGHT Many soldiers in the field long for a taste of home cooking, which is not always what they get with MREs, shorthand for meals ready to eat. When the transportable food is being sterilized in packages, the current methods of using hot water heating or steaming can end up harming the flavor and texture. However, Juming Tang, associate professor of bio logical systems engineering at Washington State University, has developed an improved system to sterilize MREs by using microwave and radio frequencies. When these tech nologies are perfected, they could allow the military to offer such heat-sensitive, bacteria-prone rations as scrambled eggs along with current entrees like ham or spaghetti. Tang has received $580,000 from the Army and Defense Department to develop the new thermal processing technologies. 20 BUZZING ABOUT The biological makeup of a fly's ears may one day help soldiers avoid surprise sniper attacks. Ronald Miles, chairman of the mechanical engineering department at SUNY-Binghamton, received a $3 million grant from the Defense Department to develop tiny microphones called "ormiaphones" that could be spread across a battlefield or city by American soldiers to detect the movements of enemy troops. The microphone's design is based on a fly's ear, which is able to more accurate ly discern the direction of sound than a human's ear. An early prototype of the microphone measures 1 mil limeter by 2 millimeter; a less superior unit based on current technology is at least the size of a breadbox. 21 I HEALING POWER The body can usually heal from injuries like burns and wounds, but resulting infections can be even more serious than the traumas themselves when left untreated. Georgia Tech professors of chemical engineering Jan Gooch and F. Joseph Schork are developing a "superbandage" for wounded soldiers caught far from medical treatment. After sustaining an injury, a soldier could grab a tube and, much like roll-on deodorant, apply the novel emulsion poly merized gel on the wound to create a transparent protective layer a thousandth of an inch thick. When the gel dries, it attaches to the skin so that only water and oxygen can pass through, not dangerous microorganisms, dirt, or sand. Anti-microbial agents in the gel fight bacteria, viruses, and fungi and promote healing for as long as two weeks. Animal testing is underway and the Army hopes to be able use the gel by next year. USING PDAS TO WIN THE WAR Military generals who once used binoculars and walkie-talkies may soon carry Palm Pilots instead to direct battlefront operations. That's the hope of Eugene Santos, an associate professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Connecticut. He's developing software for an advanced logistics system to give commanders in the field intelligent Palm Pilot-like devices to more easily move supplies and equipment during battle. The management of logistics can make the crucial difference between winning and losing, if for example, armaments or food doesn't end up at the correct location. The Air Force is sponsoring Santos's research. EJECTING TERRORISTS FROM CYBERSPACE Along with protecting public buildings and other facilities, the United States also has to safeguard cyberspace. A computer attack by terrorists could wreak havoc with power grids, communications systems, and financial networks. Raymond Hoare, a professor of electrical engineering at the University of Pittsburgh, is one of many researchers nationwide working to design new security systems for local computer networks. By retooling both hardware and software, Hoare has designed a program that would take a snapshot of normal network traffic patterns and monitor them for any deviations, which, for example, occur when a replicating virus begins to attack hard drives. The controls would then shut down the activity and alert network administrators. Hoare hopes to complete the research within 18 months.
