<plain_text><page sequence="1">Three Carved Figures in County Louth By Anthony Weir At first glance, the three figures under consideration would seem to have nothing in common ? apart from their enigmas. Yet different as they are in quality, size, and ? very likely ? in original function, they seem to be bizarrely related: a small carving on the east face of Muiredach's cross at Monasterboice may bear an ancestral relationship to a carving now in the Millmount Museum at Drogheda, whose latest significance was as a sign for a brothel and a charm against barrenness in women. A cousinal relationship to these two is borne by the grotesque, deeply grooved "mouth-puller" now built into the wall of the tennis-court at Castletown Castle, Dundalk. These three carvings have, understandably, received scant attention. Macalister1 interpreted the figure immediately hellward of Satan on Muiredach's cross as a: "pair of presumably illicit lovers, clinging to each other in their terror: possibly certain actual culprits, locally notorious at the time, are here gibbeted." He continues his description of the complete scene: "Behind them another demon forces a lost soul forward with a violent kick ? what he is holding in his hand is not clear. Observe a third demon pulling another lost soul by a rope round his neck, in the lower right-hand corner." (Plate 2a). Fifty years earlier than Macalister's detailed description of the Monasterboice crosses, an anonymous compiler included the carving in his list of thirty-two "sheela-na-gigs" in Ireland,2 an interpretation which was accepted by Dr Edith Guest in her list of "Irish Sheela-na-gigs in 1935".3 Clearly the two compilers of "sheila-na-gigs" regarded the carving as that of a figure viewed from the front, while Macalister saw two embracing figures in profile. Both interpretations raise problems. If Macalister is right, it is curious that only one leg apiece should be represented. It is, indeed, an unlikely omission on a monument whose excellent sculpture pays much attention to such basic anatomical detail where there is space for it. Satan and the Damned are carved in profile, and although exigencies of space forbid the showing of lower limbs on nine out of the fourteen Damned, and a further two Damned Souls are shown kneeling and sitting with only one leg visible, all the figures are naturalistically portrayed, even if their heads are rather too large. If the carving under consideration is of two embracing figures in profile, they not only have but one leg apiece, but are in an impossible position, anatomically distorted to a degree not found even in the crudest of mediaeval "sheila-na-gigs". Moreover, there is no evidence whatsoever of two heads face to face in profile. It would be natural to separ ate the heads entirely as in the manner of the several carvings of Jacob and the Angel on other crosses, and of the many pairs of lovers to be seen on the corbels of French Romanesque churches. It is very unlikely that weathering could have erased facial profile, for a pair of figures on the weathered East cross at Galloon Island, county Fermanagh, are clearly discernible as such? though their interpretation as Jacob and the Angel4 is very much open to question. Interpreted as a figure seen from the front, the carving has much more balance, but anatomical problems again arise. Between the head and the splayed legs are two bulges or pairs of bulges which might represent (a) breasts and arms; (b) breasts and belly; (c) arms and belly. It is impossible to say exactly which combination is intended, and it is the apparent lack of arms which prompted Macalister's interpretation of the carving. It is remarkable that the same ambiguity 1 R. A. S. Macalister, Monasterboice, Co. Louth, Dundalk, 1946, p. 41. 2 J.R.S.A.I., XXIV, (1894), pp. 78-81 and 392-394.

A more likely interpretation is that of David embracing Jonathan ? see Helen Hickey, Images of Stone, Belfast, 1976, p. 39. 67</page><page sequence="2">68 County Louth Archaeological and Historical Journal of bulges occurs also on a curious carving best described as an anthropomorphic knot, on the west face of the little-known granite cross-shaft of uncertain (but probably late) date in the graveyard of Bully's Acre in the grounds of the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, Dublin. The most likely interpretation of the Monasterboice carving is that it is an unclothed figure seen from the front, with arms held in front of its belly in the manner of many insular exhibition ists.1 Its legs are widely ? but not impossibly ? splayed. In the latest and most comprehensive discussion of female exhibitionists, j0rgen Andersen2 excludes the Monasterboice carving, com menting (page 153): "As a lost soul in a seemingly displayed state she may have impressed later carvers (of Sheila-na-gigs) but she can hardly herself be considered as a sheela, as her legs are splayed only from the knees downwards/' This is not, in fact, the case: the legs are splayed from the groin, and have a curious bend of the knees which is exactly the same on a figure holding two serpents, carved on a 7th century slab in Gotland, Sweden. Two other carvings in Ireland have splayed legs and bent knees; the ex hibitionist at Clenagh Castle, co. Clare3 and the bodiless figure at Kilsarkan Church, co. Kerry.4 A pair of exhibitionist (male and female) figures on an nth century frieze on the cornice of the bell-tower of the church of Saint-Hilaire-le-Grand in Poitiers (Vienne) has similarly splayed legs and knees slightly less bent, while a figure between two beasts on a tympanum of the 12th cen tury church at Bully (Calvados) has legs splayed almost to 1800.5 At least 400 years separate the Monasterboice carving from the Castletown "mouth puller". (Plate 2b). This is a very striking and well-carved grotesque, consisting of a head with almond-shaped, lidded eyes, deep grooves representing wrinkles, and an enormous tooth-filled mouth pulled into a baleful grin by hands which appear from either side of the head. There is no body. This carving has been mentioned briefly by Davies6 and Lawlor.7 It is fairly small, some 30 cms high, well-preserved, and carved with considerable vigour and panache. The two salient features are (a) the deeply-carved wrinkles, and (b) the dramatic action of pulling the mouth with the hands. While the latter might be interpreted as a representation of "vagina dentata" to make it a metaphorical "sheila-na-gig", the motif is also to be found on French Romanesque churches. In any case a 'metaphorical' "sheila-na-gig" is a contradiction in terms, though an apotropaic function similar to that of female exhibitionists was almost certainly intended for mouth-pullers. There are other mouth-pullers in Ireland, all with arms appearing from the side of the head. Miss Helen Roe has drawn my attention to one at Balrothery, (Plate 3) co. Dublin, built into the east wall of the church and possibly originating from the bell-tower of circa 1500. It has not, so far as I can ascertain, been published. Dr Peter Harbison has also drawn my attention to a Romanesque carving on one of two niches at the NE corner of St Brendan's Cathedral, Ardfert. This figure is also very striking, though very small. A handless arm which is an extension of the moulding which partly frames the head joins the lips which are pulled back into a toothy grin. A fourth, with a damaged chin like the Balrothery example, and a missing nose, at Drakestown, co. Meath, has been described briefly by Davies.6 This is of uncertain date, but the large almond eyes and carefully-carved eyebrows suggest a late-Romanesque or sub-Romanesque survival from a church earlier than the mediaeval ruins at present on the site.8 1 The shortcomings of the term "sheila-na-gig" are obvious, and the term "exhibitionist" is much more useful and explanatory, besides allowing for difference in sex. 2 J0rgen Andersen, The Witch on the Wall, Copenhagen, 1977. Almost all the female exhibitionists in the British Isles are described or discussed, together with eleven French Romanesque figures. This valuable study contains an exhaustive bibliography, and photographs of every exhibitionist listed in the gazetteer are also included. 3 Listed, like all the other insular female exhibitionists mentioned here, in Andersen's gazetteer, to gether with a photograph. 4 Peter Harbison, "Some Medieval Sculpture in Kerry", J.K.A.H.S., No. 6, (1973), 23 and photograph. 5 Lucien Musset, Normandie Romane, Zodiaque, Yonne 1967, I, plate 112. 8 O.

Dublin.</page><page sequence="5">Three Carved Figures in County Louth 69 During recent research on the exhibitionist motif in France I identified several mouth pullers, all with bodies and more or less naturalistic, and two of which are of considerable interest. One, at Fontaines d'Ozillac (Charente-Maritime) is a superb carving of an exhibitionist acrobat on a corbel of the exterior corbel-table. It is pulling its mouth with the forefinger of each well carved hand. The other, in the cathedral of St Peter at Poitiers (Vienne) is on an inside corbel, and is of a very naturalistic megaphallic male exhibitionist also pulling his mouth with his fore fingers. A third figure, on the ornamental corbel-table of the facade at Saint-Fort-sur-Gironde (Charente-Maritime), pulls its mouth with the forefinger of the left hand, while its right indicates an undefined genital region. Most French mouth-pullers insert their forefingers ? as does a fine grotesque example on the exterior south wall of the church at Torksey (Lines.), but the Castle town figure inserts all four, while that at Balrothery pulls its mouth with the middle of only three fingers. The other salient feature of the Castletown carving ? the pronounced grooving ? occurs on several heads in Ireland. "Sheila-na-gigs' ' at Athlone and Fethard1 are notable for the groov ing of face and body, while at Termon in co. Cavan, the disused church of Clannaphillip has a superb example of a head on which grooving is carried to an extreme.2 A head found in Keen aghan Lough, co. Fermanagh2 has grooved cheeks; the well-known head from Lough Oughter in Cavan (now in the National Museum) is also grooved, while at Kiltinane Castle, co. Tipperary, an unpublished head, grooved like those at Castletown and Termon, has been built into the arch of the gateway. There are other grooved or wrinkled heads at Kilcatherine church, Ballycrovane, co. Cork and at St Peter's Cell in Limerick. In France, however, wrinkles or grooves are rare on corbel figures (though two exhibitionists at Givrezac (Charente-Maritime) have wrinkled faces), but are more frequent on representations of Lust (e.g. above the door of the "Octagon" at Montmorillon, Vienne). Wrinkling of the body is frequent on insular exhibitionists, and evidently, as in the case of Lust at Montmorillon, represents age or emaciation. The date of the Castletown mouth-puller is uncertain. If it came from the castle it is un likely to be earlier than 1475, when, according to Davies, the castle was built. It may, however, come from the mediaeval church across the road from the castle, in which case it may well be earlier. The Drogheda carving (Plate 4) is as undatable as most post-Romanesque exhibitionists and isolated heads, but is likely to belong to the "giande ?poque" of insular "sheila-na-gigs": the 15th and 16th centuries. It is unusual, however, in having reliable and recent folklore attached (or accreted) to it. Mrs Moira Corcoran of the Old Drogheda Society kindly sent me the following communication in 1976:? "An old lady, Miss Molly Reid, a member of the Old Drogheda Society, told me that when she was a young girl (well over 60 years ago, I am sure) she in turn had enquired of an old woman as to the significance of the figure and was told: 'Sure, that was to tell the sailors, when they came in the river, where to go' ? in other words, a medieval "red lamp" being used in the 19th century. "An old man of almost eighty was viewing the taking down of the stone some weeks ago ? I do not know who he was. He remarked to a friend of mine who was standing nearby that 'Long ago when a woman was married long and had no children, as a last resort she came down to The Figure and asked for help ? and she nearly always got what she wanted.' The old man further said: 'Only for that stone I myself would not be here today.' " When I first saw the figure, about 4.5 metres up the front wall of No. 18 John Street (whence it has been removed to Millmount Museum), some children running by cried "That's the Bad Luck Stone, Mister !" The original home of the figure, before it made its way to a Victorian house, was almost certainly the Priory or Hospice of the Knights Hospitallers, founded in Drogheda by Walter de Lacy at the close of the 12th century, and situated very close to the present John Street. The foundation was a cell of the Priory of Kilmainham in Dublin ? on whose land stands the re markable cross-shaft previously mentioned ? which superseded a pre-Norman monastery.3 1 Andersen, op. cit., nos. 49 and 81. 2 Hickey, op. cit., pp. 86-88. 8 Information kindly supplied by Mrs. Moira Corcoran of the Old Drogheda Society.</page><page sequence="6">7o County Louth Archaeological and Historical Journal Another Irish figure is connected with an establishment of the Hospitallers ? a standing ex hibitionist with bandy legs and out-turned feet on the inside of a top window of Rattoo Round Tower, co. Kerry, a cast of which is in the National Museum.1 This figure also poses a problem, for it certainly has nothing of the Romanesque about it, and therefore may have been inserted into the tower (a late example) at the time that Rattoo was taken over by the Hospitallers. Below the main street of Royston in Hertfordshire an exhibitionist appears among several figures (a horse, a sword, St Catherine, the Disciples) incised on the walls of a remarkable, circular, artificial chalk cave which seems to have been used by the Knights Templars.2 This, however, is the sum and total of the information so far which relates exhibitionists with the orders of Knights, and as tantalising and frustrating as most of the meagre and rarely connected facts and indications about these figures. The Drogheda carving is some 42 cms high, crudely carved in soft sandstone, and somewhat worn. A large head is sunk between well-defined shoulders, and has two irregular depressions for eyes, no nose, and a slit-mouth. Above and behind the head, on the block from which the figure stands out in high relief, is a design or headdress of three contiguous hollow lozenges or ovals, reminiscent of Romanesque decoration found in western France and western Ireland. Below the head hangs a pendant of inverted cone shape. The prominent arms clasp an object which might be interpreted as some sort of stick or baton, but which I am inclined to believe is an erect phallus. Below this is a raised area, consonant with interpretation as a scrotum, into which a circular, deep hole has been obliquely bored. If I am right, this figure is an ithyphallic anal-exhibitionist.3 Male exhibitionists are extremely rare in the British Isles. Only one other blatant example is known: an unpublished figure on a gatepost at Ballycloghduff, co. Westmeath,4 which clasps a key to its chest with one hand, while the other grips a large, downward-pointing phallus. Built into the gateway of the church at Broadford, co. Clare is a similar figure also clasping a key, but the lower half of the body is missing so that it is impossible to say for certain whether or not it was once in the same attitude as the Ballycloghduff male. In France, however, male exhibitionists are almost as common as females. During a recent trip to France I identified over 35 males (megaphallic or ithyphallic) and almost 50 females, all in the Western part of the country. Many of the French examples are acrobatic, and some com bine other motifs, such as mouth-pulling, wafer-munching, or the pulling-out of a thorn from the foot. The Drogheda carving is certainly an exhibitionist, for if it is not an ithyphallic male, the presence of a circular hole makes it at least an anal, if not a female exhibitionist. Other anal exhibitionists are known in Ireland. At Grey Abbey, co. Down, one of the corbels on a remarkably French-looking corbel table on the north side of the chancel, is a worn anal and acrobatic ex hibitionist in soft sandstone, with hands gripping buttocks, and between its legs what appears from directly below to be an enormous scrotum. This carving is obviously of French influence, and very similar to a figure at Sablonceaux (Charente-Maritime), which, interestingly, is an austere building of the Augustinian Canons-Regular. Grey Abbey is, of course, Cistercian ? and these two figures are the only definite exhibitionists I have found on abbeys. A Romanesque acrobat from Aghalurcher, co. Fermanagh, is related to the Grey Abbey figure and to an acrobat on the westernmost capital at Boyle Abbey. 1 I am indebted to Mr. Lennox Barrow for information concerning Rattoo, and for his persistence in track ing down the long-lost cast. The figure is not a blatant exhibitionist, but merely indicates the genital area with one hand. 2 Information from the excavator, Mrs. Sylvia Beamon. 3 Many exhibitionists display the anus as well as the genitals. The Drogheda carving is probably the only post-Romanesque carving in the British Isles to be ithyphallic, apart from certain half-beast figures such as one accompanying a "sheila-na-gig" at Whittlesford in Cambridgeshire and the Abson beast-man in Gloucester shire. Both of these are, however, on all fours, and not ithyphallic in the same way as the Drogheda figure and the remarkable post-Romanesque upright masked man (or beast-man) in the group atKilkea Castle, co. Kildare, a scene of the temptation of Lust (but not of Saint Anthony) which has close parallels on some French Roman esque capitals, e.g. Passirac (Charente). 4 I am indebted to the late Mr. N. W. English of the Old Athlone Society for bringing me to see this interesting figure.</page><page sequence="7">Plate 4. Kxhibitionist figure in Millmoimt Museum, Drogheda.</page><page sequence="8">Three Carved Figures in County Louth 71 J?rgen Andersen has shown, and my further research has confirmed that the exhibitionist motif came to the British Isles from France. The earliest, Romanesque, carvings in Ireland can be shown to have French antecedents: the Berrymount (Tomregan) grotesque1 has a style about it which is found in grotesques in Poitou, while the Clonmacnois, Grey Abbey and Aghalur cher2 carvings show Saintongeais influence. The question of function and distribution of ex hibitionist figures ? whether the Romanesque exhibitionists of France or the post-Romanesque "sheila-na-gigs" of the British Isles ? is one which cannot be dealt with here. Suffice it to say that the insular figures occur largely in areas of great conflict in the mediaeval period (Yorkshire, the Welsh borders, Southern and Eastern England; a broad band from Dundalk Bay to the Shannon Estuary with two Romanesque predecessors in Cavan/ Fermanagh) and are absent from the more peaceful areas and those not penetrated until late. Scotland has only four, three on islands and one very near the mainland coast; there are no exhibitionists in Antrim, Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim or Mayo, and only one in East Gal way. Curiously, there are none in Wexford, Wicklow or Carlow, while there are two in county Dublin.3 Wales has only three, and Cornwall none, so that any "Celtic" connection can be ruled out. In any case, I have been able to identify only one definite "Celtic" female exhibitionist ? on a gold bracelet of the 4th or 5th century BC from Reinheim in Saarland.4 The origin of the exhibitionist as a French Romanesque motif remains obscure. While the mediaeval carvings can be shown to have an apotropaic function in areas of great turmoil (such as England and Wales during the Hundred Years' War and the Wars of the Roses, and Ireland in the period immediately following the Wars of the Roses), the Romanesque exhibitionists ? male and female ? cannot be so easily accounted for. There are scores of enigmatic Roman esque motifs whose meanings we cannot hope to discover; and the iconography of the Irish crosses offers much room for speculation. The problem is compounded by the distribution of European Romanesque exhibitionists, almost all of which are to be found in Western France, mostly in the departments of Charente, Charente-Maritime and Vienne, with others in Normandy, Brittany and only one or two south of the Gironde. The motif seems to have originated in Saintonge or possibly Poitou, though it must be borne in mind that the exhibitionist is a world-wide motif. Apart from the Reinheim example quoted above, there are exhibitionist carvings in India, Polynesia and South America which cannot have any connexion with the Western European examples except at the most universal level: genital display is a powerful and fascinating act. While the Romanesque examples may conceivably have a Christian meaning, it is more likely that their function is not Christian ? though not necessarily pre-Christian. They may have some connexion with the portrayal of Lust, a motif which, however, occurs in Romanesque art with out genital display. Romanesque churches are adorned with homely carvings of barrels, snails, lobsters and abstract decoration as well as a bewildering assortment of grotesques (such as foot suckers), fantastic beasts, chaste and coupling couples, acrobats and animal and human masks. The association of the exhibitionist motif with that of the acrobat (and the wafer-muncher, mouth-puller and thorn-puller) makes interpretation even more difficult. There may be a Graeco-Roman origin in the Gorgon-figures of Classical times, and the frankly licentious celebra tion of Christmas and the New Year (the Roman Saturnalia and Kalends of January), which in France lasted up to the 17th century, might also be represented in stone just as the importance of the wine-harvest prompted the carving of barrels in so many French Romanesque churches.5 1 Hickey, op. cit., pp. 62-63. Mrs. Hickey regards this figure as male, but I concur with J0rgen Andersen that the grotesque displays pendulous labia and not testicles. 2 I agree with Helen Hickey (op. cit. pp. 62-65) in regarding this figure also as male. 3 J?rgen Andersen lists three for co. Dublin, but the figure on the small cross at Jamestown, Stepaside, is not an exhibitionist. 4 Illustrated in J.V.S. Megaw, Art of the European Iron Age, London, 1970. 5 Out of around 375 Romanesque churches or parts of churches in Saintonge (a province comprising the department of Charente-Maritime, together with about half of Charente and small areas of Vend?e and Deux S?vres) 58 feature barrels or kegs. 43 churches have male, female or anal exhibitionists, on 8 of which are more than one example. For comparison, misers (representing Avarice) occur on only 6, musicians on 54, Lust on 14 (2 with 2 examples each), coupling couples on 21, embracing, non-coupling couples on 9, and chaste and decorative nude figures on 7.</page><page sequence="9">72 County Louth Archaeological and Historical Journal But such possible connexions cannot account for the preponderance of distribution in Western France and not, for example in Italy1 or in Eastern France. Another possibility is the reluctance of the lower clergy to be celibate. Several French papal-inspired councils ? notably one at Poitiers in iooo AD ? tried to enforce clerical celibacy. Since French exhibitionists must have been carved and sited with clerical approval ? whether on belfries or on capitals ? it is possible that some might have represented some defiance by the rural clergy of pressure against cohabita tion. It is interesting that none of the Romanesque Irish "sheila-na-gigs" is blatantly exhibition ist, although the Transitional carving on Grey Abbey comes very close to its French predecessors. The Aghalurcher carving is a fairly-discreet anal-exhibitionist acrobat; the acrobatic figure at the Nuns' Church, Clonmacnois, is probably also an anal exhibitionist; and the Berrymount (Tomregan) grotesque is ambiguous. In England, however, all eight known Romanesque ex hibitionists (of which the best-known is at Kilpeck, Herefordshire) are as blatant as any of the post-Romanesque grotesques. It seems that the Irish were reluctant to accept the motif of genital display until after Norman penetration. The Monasterboice carving is certainly not a blatant exhibitionist, any more than the long accepted "sheila-na-gig" at White Island, co. Fermanagh. But, like the White Island figure, it may be a forerunner of the Romanesque exhibitionists which became fairly popular in Sain tonge.2 Other details of Muiredach's Cross have a "proto-Romanesque" quality about them: the birds with interlocking necks at the top of the east face, the cats at the base of the cross-shaft, and the fighting beasts under the south arm. While it is quite possible that the White Island carving represents Chastity,3 the position of the Monasterboice figure between Satan and the Damned is more likely to portray Lust. In this I agree more or less with Macalister, even though I cannot accept his physical description of the carving. The whole world of Romanesque and pre-Romanesque Christian iconography is for us largely a world of speculation and mystery. The phenomenon of "sheila-na-gigs" and other exhibitionists in Romanesque and post-Romanesque Europe is likewise a subject fraught with anomalies and enigmas. But it is at least possible that the carving on Muiredach's Cross, with its striking leg-position prefigured in a Gotland slab of two centuries earlier, and prefiguring Roman esque and post-Romanesque exhibitionists, had a causal connexion with the remarkable appear ance of exhibitionists on (and in some cases in) the churches of Romanesque Saintonge, Angoumois, Poitou and Normandy, whence the motif came to Ireland, accepted reluctantly at first, but later ? with a non-Christian apotropaic function ? placed on 60 or more churches and castles4 with desperate fervour. Insofar as the mouth-puller is also a French Romanesque motif imported into Ireland, and in at least two cases combined with that of exhibitionism ? and is also of obvious apotropaic function, harking back to the Gorgon masks of the Grseco-Roman world ? there is a tenuous but definite connexion between the Castletown carving and the exhibitionists of the British Isles and France. The Drogheda figure, whose ithyphallic and anal exhibitionism relates to French male exhibitionists, shares with them a less problematic origin: the Priapic 1 Only one exhibitionist has so far been identified in Italy: a relief formerly above one of the city gates of Milan. A stern and dignified woman raises her robe in a defiantly exhibitionist attitude, her legs slightly bent. This figure has obviously some connection with the Gorgons placed before city-gates in Greece. See also E. Clibborn, "An ancient stone image, called Shela-na-gig at Lavey", P.R.I.A., series I, volume II, Dublin, 1840, p. 565 et seq., where the practice of female exposure to avert the evil eye is reported from the Naples area ? an area famous for the antiquity of its practices. 2 See footnote 5, page 71. 3 See E. Ettlinger, "Saint Patrice? l'homme au langage perp?tuel", Ogam, X, 271 et seq., and Folklore, LXXXV, (1974), 62-63; also D. O'Driscoll, J.R.S.A.I., LXXII, (1942), 116. The latest and most exhaustive treatment of this and the other White Island figures is in Hickey, op. cit., 34-38 and 44-48. 4 Only in Ireland do exhibitionists occur on castles, Norman, Irish and Anglo-Norman. They are some times very high up, sometimes low down in prominent positions; many are on quoins, sometimes sideways. While this would seem to lend support to the apotropaic function of exhibitionists, it might equally be the case that exhibitionists were erected to declare the sexual purity of the castle's holders, and hence render it free of guilt for causing plague. In late medieval times plague and other misfortunes were seen as punishment for sin, especially the sins of sexuality. In the long period of sexual licence amongst laity and clergy alike, up to the 17th century, in France, to a lesser extent in England, and in Ireland (where clergy, of course, occupied hereditary posts up to the 16th century), exhibitionists might, by pillorying the sin of Lust, have indicated the chastity of a congregation, or a monastery.</page><page sequence="10">Three Carved Figures in County Louth 73 carvings of the Roman Empire. The association of the Drogheda figure with fecundity, sexual relief and possibly good (or ill) luck is not unknown in other post-Romanesque exhibitionist figures. Motifs may quickly lose their significance and be adapted to new purposes. As early as the twelfth century the White Island carving was regarded as a "sheila-na-gig" and placed sideways in the doorway of the late-Romanesque church. It is possible that Romanesque ex hibitionists had different significances in different places, and it may be that the Drogheda carv ing had a different meaning to its sculptor than other, female, exhibitionists of about the same time. It is likewise possible that the exhibitionists had different meaning to their sculptors than to those who commissioned or viewed them ? just as today some sculptures might portray some spiritual attitude to the sculptor, but appear merely "obscene" to members of the public. If the motif of the centaur shooting an arrow at a lion represents Christ (man over beast) directing His spirit (the bow and arrow) to overcome evil (the lion), who can say what elliptical symbolism might be expressed in the exhibitionist figures and the mouth-pullers ? I am aware that in this brief discussion of these three quite different carvings I have done little more than offer food for thought. The field of iconography provides little scope for precision or fact-finding: the best that can be done is to suggest connexions. For their help in suggesting connexions I am grateful to Dr J0rgen Andersen and Dr Peter Harbison, who have also given me much useful information.</page></plain_text>
