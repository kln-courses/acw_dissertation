BERNS Abstract Women dominate the production of pottery in Africa, yet few scholars have considered women the likely creators of the figurative ceramic sculpture recovered archaeologically across the savanna. Indeed, the question of who made these highly celebrated ceramics is rarely raised. A close look at the art historical and archaeological literature exposes the gender biases that privilege men's 'high' art over women's 'low' craft, making men the presumed creators of these works. Examples of women's predominance in the production of ritually-destined figurative ceramics in Nigeria alone counters such unsubstantiated assumptions. Through such production women play important roles in the construction of social and cultural meanings. It does make a difference in our reading and writing of history to understand and reconstruct what women make as well as what men make. Resume Les femmes dominent la production d'objets en argile en Afrique, mais peu d'experts ont consid?r? les femmes comme cr?atrices probables des sculptures figuratives en c?ramique d?couvertes dans des fouilles arch?ologiques dans toute la savane. De fait, la question de savoir qui fabriquait ces c?ramiques hautement pris?es est rarement soulev?e. Une ?tude plus approfondie de la litt?rature ayant trait ? l'histoire de l'art et ? l'arch?ologie met en ?vidence les partis pris sexuels qui privil?gient l'art '?lev?' des hommes par rapport ? l'artisanat 'vulgaire' des femmes, faisant des hommes les cr?ateurs pr?sum?s de ces oeuvres. Des exemples de la pr?dominance des femmes dans la production de figurines rituelles en c?ramique au Nigeria contredisent ces suppositions non prouv?es. Par cette production, les femmes jouent un r?le important dans l'?laboration de notions sociales et culturelles. Comprendre et reconstruire ce que font les femmes, de m?me que ce que font les hommes, nous fait lire et ?crire l'histoire diff?remment. Introduction The last two decades have witnessed the consideration of gender in re-examinations of the premises and assumptions of both past and current scholarly research and interpretation.</page><page sequence="2">130 Maria C. Berns Across the disciplines of history, anthropology, archaeology and art history, the feminist critique of how male/female roles, power relations, and capabilities have been framed and conceptualized has revealed the tyranny of an androcentric point of view (see Aronson 1991; Atkinson 1982; Conkey and Spector 1984; Gero and Conkey 1991; Gouma-Peterson and Mathews 1987; Moore 1988; Nochlin 1988; Pollock 1983; Rosaldo 1980; Scott 1986, among others). This article explores how interpretations and reconstructions of African art history have been grounded on such male-centered assumptions, which privilege the male artist and what he makes and diminish the female artist and what she makes. In Africa, women are known to have dominated the production of pottery (see Bradley 1989:117; Conkey and Spector 1984:10; David and Hennig 1972:23; Drost 1968:138; Kramer 1985:83; St?ssel 1984:66; Sieber 1980:246; Vansina 1984:50, among others). However, the roles and positions of women in the network of relations concerning the production and use of ceramic objects - sculpture as well as vessels - has been seriously undervalued. This is true not only of the ethnographic traditions of the past century but of certain archaeological objects, which have come to be seen as benchmarks of human accomplishment and 'civilization' in Africa. The widely held feminist view that women have been strikingly neglected both as subjects and as agents has prompted re-evaluations of gender relations and of'gender as a structuring principle in all human societies' (Moore 1988:vii). However, as Lisa Aronson (1991:550) aptly notes, 'scholars of African art have been unusually slow to consider theoretical issues of gender. While many have studied women in the arts, few grapple with gender-related issues or attempt to interpret the data from a feminist theoretical perspective'. There is little doubt that sexual difference accounts for who makes what kinds of art in Africa. However, preconceived notions about gender have shaped both the hierarchical evaluation of the arts produced by men in Africa and the ways art history itself has been and continues to be written. By drawing greater attention to sex roles in art production and to cultural concepts of gender as they are materially and symbolically represented, Africanist art historians can, as feminists claim, profoundly alter our understanding of past and present human communities. The archaeologically recovered ceramic sculptures from Nok (Fig. 1) and Ife in Nigeria, the Inland Niger Delta in Mali, the Lake Chad Basin (Fig. 2), Komaland in Ghana and other sites in sub-Saharan Africa are claimed to be among the oldest and most celebrated manifestations of artistic excellence in Africa, with the earliest dating to 500 BC in the case of Nok (Fagg 1963; Shaw 1981:154; and Eyo 1980:3). It is because of these exceptionally preserved early artifacts that archaeologists and historians have argued for the independent invention of and mastery over the modeling and firing of clay in sub-Saharan Africa (Mclntosh and Mclntosh 1986:419). Yet, the question rarely asked is: Who made these ceramics? Androcentrism and the study of African art Margaret Conkey and Janet Spector (1984) in their review essay 'Archaeology and the Study of Gender' have identified the principal features of androcentrism that have influenced the ethnographies on which archaeologists have relied for understanding and explaining material modes of cultural expression. Most problematic among them are the kinds of assumptions and expectations of gender relations from their own society which</page><page sequence="3">Art, history, and gender: women and clay in West Africa 131 'Western, white, and middle- or upper-class' men have brought to their research. Such imported biases have contributed profoundly to the asymmetrical perception of relations between men and women in other cultures of the world. Hence, 'differences' between the Figure 1 Nok head from Jemaa, Nigeria, ca. 500 BC-AD 200. Ceramic; h. 19 cm. National Museum, Lagos.

The androcentrism Conkey and Spector observed primarily in the work of anthropo Figure 2 Sao figure from Tago, Chad. Ceramic; h. 24.5 cm. Lebeuf expedition, 1947 48.

They too have been preoccupied with certain categories of art over others because they are produced by men and express the prevailing male view. As Thalia Gouma-Peterson and Patricia Mathews (1987:332) have concluded, 'A large part of traditional female creative outpu? ?ha? conveyed a female experience had been invalidated as art and relegated ?o ?he calegory of craft ?hrough ?he crealion of an aeslhelic hierarchy qualiialively differentiating "high" from "low" art.' The definition of women's craft production as a 'low' art form, even implicilly, can be seen as a lool lo suslain arguments about the universal powerlessness of women. And this attitude, rooted in the historiography of Western art, has been carried into the field by Africanist scholars. African women's production of ceramics, baskelry, and decorated gourds, for example, confined for ?he mos? par? lo ?he domestic sphere, has long been devalued in relation to the wood or metal sculpture produced by men for ritual and sacred purposes (Aronson 1991). The negative way women artists have been presented and their relative dismissal 'is functional in the perpetuation of the myth of masculine creative superiority and social dominance' (Pollock 1983:40). There has been little challenge to the unqualified presump tion thai men are the pre-eminent artistic producers in Africa (see Biebuyck 1969; d'Azevedo 1973; Gillon 1984; and Vansina 1984, among others). Despite recent interest in the aesthetic and technological merits of women's arts, few studies have explored the ways women's arts contribule lo ?he cultural construction of symbolic meanings or to the social construction of gender. Moreover, of the studies con cerning women and the arts in Africa, those considered most significant concentrate on the powerful role women can play in the arena of men's arts - particularly male-dominated masquerades or religious cults, including those involving figurative wood sculpture (see Glaze 1981, 1986; Adams 1986; Drewal and Drewal 1983). Attention should be refocused on women as producers of cultural texis and transmilters of symbolic values withoul demeaning ?he kinds of material vehicles used for doing so. Gender and African ceramic sculpture The lileralure on African archaeological ceramics is dominaled by male scholars who also largely overlook ?he gender issue by referring in iheir discussions aboul art and malerial cullure lo ?he 'sculptors' or 'figurine makers' or 'artisls' as does Bernard Fagg in his volume on Nok Terracottas (1977). By nol even asking who made ?he early figurative ceramics of sub Saharan Africa, and given ?he conventional alliludes held aboul such celebrated material, it is generally assumed thai the artisls were male. This view is drawn largely from the designation of these ceramic objects as 'art' rather than as 'craft', and hence part of the male rather than female domain. Such widespread disregard and even evasion of the issue of authorship has fostered culturally particular assumptions about gender in interpretations and reconstructions of the past (Conkey and Spector 1984:2). The presumption lhal these figurative works must have functioned in ritual or sacred contexts strengthens the inference that they were made by men. Indeed, the view of women in the history of ceramic production in Africa has been biased by past and present gender ideologies, with their pervasive demotion of women's roles in the home, in labour or in the workplace (see Wright 1991). As a rare exception to this generalization, Henry Drewal, in his recent assessment of</page><page sequence="6">134 Maria C. Berns the archaeological sculpture from Ife (Drewal and Pemberton 1989:71), asks directly: 'Were the creators of these exquisite works women or men?' For him, the 'deeply rooted' tradition of Yoruba women modeling clay for sacred as well as secular purposes suggests that women were the artists of the Ife ceramic heads. Despite Drewal's interpretive departure, the pervasive assumption that men must have been the artists of such fired clay sculpture is further boosted by a tendency in the literature to classify them as 'terracottas' (which Drewal likewise does). Ceramics has been the conventional term used in non-Euroamerican and in Euroamerican art to describe the production of'objects made from earthy materials with the aid of heat' (Speight 1983:331). In the African literature, the word 'pottery' also is commonly used to refer loosely to any type of ceramic ware (Speight 1983:334). In contrast, the word 'terracotta' (a 'low-fire, porous, reddish clay body. . . . Used throughout history for common domestic ware', Speight 1983:336), has been singled out to mean something quite distinct from ceramics or pottery. While also used to describe sculpture, 'terracotta' distinguishes and elevates certain categories of African figurative ceramic or pottery production to art. For example, William Fagg and John Picton open The Potter's Art in Africa (1970:7) with the following position statement regarding the exhibition of the same name held in 1970 at the Museum of Mankind in London: 'This exhibition is about pottery and pottery sculpture (also often called terra-cotta) as art rather than craft, emphasizing forms rather than techniques. The distinction between pottery and pottery sculpture (terra-cotta) does not, therefore, imply that one is not art while the other is'. The authors go on to claim that the distinction between pottery and terracotta is an artificial one, and their designation of works as one or the other depends on whether they were, in Margaret Trowell's (1970:23) words, 'spirit regarding' (terracottas) or 'man-regarding/woman-regarding' (pottery). That is, ceramic works used in ritual or sacred contexts can be distinguished from those used in the home. Despite Fagg's and Picton's efforts toward taxonomic and even gender fairness, a hierarchy of sacred figurative 'art' over domestic non-figurative 'craft' is still subtly perpetuated. The authors themselves would probably argue that the position statement I have quoted proves that they endeavoured to treat these categories of production equally, and I do not question their intentions or integrity on this issue; however, the impact of a pervasive and implicitly androcentric point of view is still manifest. This is most apparent in the catalogue's photograph captions where ceramic vessels are labeled 'pots' and archaeologically recovered figurines and heads are labeled 'terracottas' (e.g. pp. 10, 11, 15, 18, 19, 24 and 34); women are 'potters' and the 'famous woman potter' Azume made a 'pottery figure' and not a terracotta sculpture (Fagg and Picton 1970:30). One of the most extensive regional collections of African pottery was assembled in Nigeria in the 1960s by Sylvia Leith-Ross, who spent nearly eight years directing the collection and documentation of over 1100 examples. Her catalogue, Nigerian Pottery (1970; published to accompany the permanent installation of the Pottery Gallery at the Jos Museum in Jos, Nigeria), not only describes form and function but identifies whenever possible whether men or women of a particular ethnic group were the objects' makers. And, whether produced for domestic or ritual purposes, Leith-Ross consistently calls the fired clay containers 'pots' and their makers 'potters'. Although this catalogue includes few non-domestic or figurative examples, one can still argue that Leith-Ross' inclusive and non-hierarchical presentation differs from much of the</page><page sequence="7">Art, history, and gender: women and clay in West Africa 135 African ceramic literature, where figurative objects presumed to have been made by men are called terracottas, while those known to have been made by women are called pots. For example, it is not accidental that Bernard Fagg has titled his book Nok Terracottas. We should make careful note of Fagg's (1977:21) choice of words when he explains that 'it is thought that the [Nok] terracottas may have been fired in the way that domestic pots and pottery figures are still fired [by women] today' (emphasis and parentheses supplied). Like wise, Elizabeth Isichei (1983:65), in her History of Nigeria, writes that 'The Nok culture, famous for its terracotta sculpture, produced also a wide range of domestic pottery.' Furthermore, in the volume, Two Thousand Years Nigerian Art, published by the Federal Department of Antiquities in 1977 to introduce the world to the artistic achievements of Nigeria, the table of contents distinguishes between major archaeological objects as 'art' or 'terracotta sculpture' and the one ethnographic figurative example known to have been made by a Dakakari woman as a 'pottery sculpture'. The same distinction persists elsewhere, especially in Arnulf St?ssel's survey, Afrikanische Keramik (1984), where label captions clearly discriminate between terracottas and pots (e.g. plates 1-3, 6-7, and 16). The underlying rationale for this taxonomic distinction, I would argue, is the promotion of figurative terracotta sculpture as a male art and the demotion of pottery vessels as a female craft. Yet as Suzanne Blier (1988/89:9) has claimed, such taxonomic divisions as those between art and craft or, I would add, between terracotta and pottery, are fabrica tions of a particular time, place, and perspective. There is little doubt that these are Western, most probably male inventions, which have been adopted with little critical reflection by many scholars, whether women or men. However, more than simply a matter of semantic convention, the distinctions between figurative terracotta and non-figurative pottery are also intended to valorize what men make versus what women make. Women and clay The ethnographic record abounds with references to sexual divisions of labour identifying women as the primary potters in Africa. One intriguing question this division raises is why pottery manufacture is necessarily largely limited to women especially since both sexes tend to be underemployed during the dry season when this activity mostly takes place (see David and Hennig 1972:23). It has been argued that women tend to dominate the modeling of clay because this work is typically done within the home, where women are closely confined due to the requirements of pregnancy, infant care, and other household tasks (see Arnold 1985; Wright 1991:200; and Brown 1989:215-16). Nevertheless, Brown's (1989:217) point that people's activities are governed by the allocation of time resources according to season and place would suggest that the absence of certain subsistence tasks during the dry season (and the reduced likelihood of scheduling conflicts) would free men to produce pottery. And, given the fact that pottery-making is not particularly resilient to a stop-and-start regime, it would seem that men and not women might be better suited to such work. For example, exceptions to the woman-pottery model found among the Hausa of northern Nigeria (Leoni and Pritchett 1976), the Azande of Sudan (Schildkrout, Hell man and Keim 1989) or the Moba of Togo (Kreamer 1989), where men make and fire pots, proves this to be true for the recent past. These studies are beginning to deal with the social, economic, or political reasons why men have entered this largely female domain.</page><page sequence="8">136 Maria C.Berns Nevertheless, the historical record does not explain why women are generally associated with pottery-making despite recent efforts to explore the origins and evolution of gendered activities (see Conkey and Spector 1984; and Gero and Conkey 1991). Al issue here is nol explaining or proving women's long-term dominalion of po??ery produclion, bul ralher arguing against the omission of women from interpretations of figurative and other ritually-deslined ceramics - distinguished as arl as opposed lo craft - and arguing for the critical reconsideration of how women as potters and as artists have been active participants in the history of art, social relations, and ritual practice in Africa. The pressing need for re-evaluating the existing data in a new light is driven home by the following kinds of insupportable assumptions: Frank Willetl (1967:70-8) claiming lhal Ife ceramic sculpture is built up in much the same way as women make pots using a coiling method, but because the interior walls of the sculpture are not finished smoothly as are domestic pots, they were most likely made by men1; William Fagg (1963: fig. 133), writing in his caption about the terracotta figure of a woman done by the Goemai artist Azume, says that 'While pots are nearly always made by women, this is a very rare instance of pottery sculpture produced by women'; Jean-Paul and Annie Lebeuf (1977:49) claiming in their discussion of Sao 'terracottas' thai ceramics were a female occupation yet still arguing it was probably men who made the anthropomorphic or zoomorphic figurines; E. Coart and A. de Hauleville (1907:24) concluding in ?he notes published on the early ethnographic collections of the former Mus?e du Congo at Tervuren, thai pottery making is basically an inferior industry except when men practise it, when it becomes an aristocratic profession; and Rene Gardi, in his book African Crafts and Craftsmen, noting that in Africa potting is reserved for women, but they 'seem to have little talent as creative artists. In comparison with the accomplishments of their men . . . the shy decorations thai one finds on the earthenware are rather ungainly' (169:112). Refusals by male scholars to acknowledge or even credit the artistic contributions or accomplishments of women are tacilly countered by ?he extensive record of po??ery produc lion in Africa. Women produce nol only a wide range of ceramic vessels for domestic and ritual purposes but various kinds of ceramic figurative sculptures used in sacred or ceremonial contexts. To cite a series of examples from Nigeria alone: 1. Yoruba ceramic vessels with figurative lids are made by women for cults honouring the Oyo river deity, Erinle. Robert Thompson (1969) has written about one artist, an Egbado Yoruba woman named Abatan (born around 1885), who is well known in several Yoruba provinces for her Erinle ceramics. Not only was she responsible for producing these vessels, but she was also a senior member of the cult (Thompson 1969:151). Thompson suggests thai this ceramic tradition may date to the mid-nineteenth century, with Abatan most active in the 1920s-30s. 2. In Benin, figurative ritual pots are largely made by wives of brasscasters belonging lo urban guilds (Ben-Amos 1973, 1980, 1986). The vessels are ?he central objects on shrines to Olokun, the Bini god of the seas and rivers and, according to Paula Ben-Amos (1980:46), the most popular and widely worshipped deity in Benin. This male deity's popularity has to do with his role in fostering creativity and providing children, for 'the path to the spirit world lies across the sea and the souls of those who have died, as well as those about to be born, must pass over the water'. Hence, all Bini women once maintained a shrine to Olokun in their homes, which included one of these decorated ritual vessels made of river</page><page sequence="9">Art, history, and gender: women and clay in West Africa 137 clay, depicting male and female participants in Olokun ceremonies. At the family and village levels, larger shrines also are maintained for Olokun, recreating through mud tableaux the palace of Olokun under the sea. Olokun priestesses help priests create the large-scale mud figures. The growing attention to the sexual division of labour in art production is strikingly evident in a comparison of Ben-Amos' 1973 and 1986 articles on Olokun pots and mud sculpture. The earlier article includes no explicit descriptions of the artists' gender (although it indicates that both men and women are followers of Olokun), allowing the reader to draw the conclusion that men were responsible (see p. 28 for a reference to the artist as 'he'). By contrast, Ben-Amos' 1986 article focuses on gender differentiation in the creation of Olokun arts, crediting women not only with making pots but the large-scale anthropomorphic mud figures as well. 3. Kwale Igbo figurative ceramics were made for the cult of Ifijioku, the yam spirit (Fagg and Picton 1970:34). Several examples were collected about 1880 in the village of Osisa (western Igboland) without documentation as to artist. However, the data on Igbo women sculptors presented by Herbert Cole and Chike Aniakor (1984:78-82), and more recently again by Cole (1989:47, 49), make it likely that the artists were women. Other examples of figurative ceramic sculpture made by north-eastern Igbo women (Fig. 3; see also Cole 1989: figs 23 and 52; cf. Schaedler 1985:176-7) further strengthen the argument that the sculptors of the yam cult ceramics were likely to have been women. 4. Figurative ceramics were made by one documented Goemai woman potter, named Azume (died 1951). The Goemai live in the middle Benue just within the so-called Nok culture area. Observed in the sixties by Bernard Fagg (see W. Fagg 1963: plate 133) and by Roy Sieber (1961:12, fig. 30, 1969:200), Azume's work has been characterized as the invention of a singular woman artist. However, there is no reason to conclude that other Goemai women before Azume (let alone other women in northern Nigeria and other parts of sub-Saharan Africa) did not also produce figurative ceramics. 5. Pottery finials are made by Gwari women living near Abuja, which is about 40 km from the Nok site of Taruga. Very little research has been done on the Gwari, and what is known about the finials is that they were kept on burial houses of chiefs or on the houses of new chiefs (NaTbi and Hassan n.d.: plates 18, 19). 6. Grave sculptures are produced by Dakakari women (Bassing 1973), who live about 250 km north-west of the Nok area. The most numerous and elaborate figurative examples are reserved for the burial mounds of high-status men, such as village heads, important priests, great hunters and warriors. Dakakari tomb ceramics are modeled in the form of human figures (Fig. 4), equestrians, and animals. 7. Anthropomorphic and zoomorphic vessels are made by Longuda women, as well as men, of the lower Gongola Valley, north-eastern Nigeria, for a healing cult called Kwandalha (Fig. 5). Interviews conducted with one female Longuda potter named Dasumi in 1968 indicate that certain Kwandalha vessels are kept in shrines and are used in conjunction with rites for diagnosing diseases.2 Others are made especially to personify the patient's illness, and during ritual procedures the disease is transferred from the person to the pot in order to effect a cure. Among the Longuda, women serve both as artists and as healers. 8. Figurative vessels, called Ku'chan, are kept in shrines by the Janjo (Jen) of the Gongola-Benue Valley and used primarily in annual hunting ceremonies. Early examples</page><page sequence="10">138 Maria C. Berns were collected by Leo Frobenius in 1912; other contemporary Ku'chan were documented in 1982 (Fig. 6), said to have been made for the Janjo on commission by a neighbouring Kwa woman named Bilau.3 Janjo men, however, oversee the shrines and use the vessels Figure 3 Igbo woman sculptor Nwale Chukwu (of Ameka Ezza, Nigeria) is modeling a figure for a medicine pot.

Such Nigerian ceramic sculptures clearly support the point made above: women have long served as producers and transmitters of a symbolic repertoire, participating in the construction of social and ritual meanings. That women are the artists, regardless of whether they control the contexts in which the ceramics are used, makes them part of the processes whereby material symbols help negotiate meaning - whether it be in Olokun or Erinle worship or in funerary rites enacted by the Gwari or Dakakari. Women's participa tion also means that they have entered into a dialogue with the men who use these objects, making women a part of the gendered system by which social meanings are constructed. The Rugange Bata of north-eastern Nigeria, for example, formerly maintained a cult of ancestors to whom appeals were made on an annual basis or in times of catastrophe (Chappel 1973). The spirits of deceased male chiefs were contained in ceramic vessels made by certain woman artists, even though it was the living chief priest and other male custodians who maintained the pottery shrine, made offerings, and held annual ceremonies to ensure community health and prosperity. The women who made the sculptured vessels are largely overlooked in discussions of the tradition's meaning and importance. I would argue that the role of women in helping create and maintain the ideology of the Bata social order needs to be assessed critically, particularly as it involves strategies of dominance and control. Men may be the explicit guarantors of community survival in their claim to sole rights of spirit mediation, yet they remain dependent on women for the production of the salient material symbols on which the successes of their spiritual negotiations depend. Not enough attention has been paid to these vessels and to the gendered meanings embodied in the terms of their production. What should be acknowledged at this juncture is that even in north-eastern Nigeria, where women predominate as sculptors of clay, there are examples of men who make certain sacred ceramic objects. This is true among the Ga'anda (Berns 1989) and the Cham/Mwona (Hare 1983; Berns 1986); other isolated examples of male production could be cited from elsewhere in Nigeria (e.g. in Benin; Ben-Amos 1980), Ghana (e.g. among the Asante; Cole and Ross 1977, McLeod 1984), and in Zaire, Angola and Zambia (e.g. among the Chokwe, Lunda and Lwena; Stossel 1984, Darish 1990). However, just because there are instances of men making figurative ceramic sculpture in the ethnographic record does not support the unqualified presumption that men produced all the figurative ceramics recovered archaeologically. And, whether figurative or not, there is little basis for the generalization that women rarely participate in pottery-production for non-household use. Approaches to the study of women and clay Data concerning twentieth-century ceramic examples do not prove, of course, that women made various examples of archaeological ceramic sculpture. However, the data do raise several key issues that affect the way we approach historical reconstruction and interpreta tion in Nigeria and elsewhere. To begin with, we should explore the importance of tech nology itself in social and cultural terms. Bryan Pfaffenberger (1988:241) argues that 'any technology should be seen as a system, not just of tools, but also of related social behaviours and techniques'. If we accept that technology has important social dimensions, then we</page><page sequence="14">142 Maria C. Berns must consider the gender arrangements of those making or using a technology and how those arrangements contribute to constructing the meaning of male-female social relations and processes of change over time. In Pfaffen berger's words (1988:249), the Western penchant to fetishize objects tends to 'unhinge human creations from the social relations that produce them'. By emphasizing archaeological sculpture only as cultural products of an early, but highly evolved ceramic technology, scholars avoid exploring the human social dynamics of production itself. So if women are (and most likely were) the producers of most ceramic arts, then their dominance over this technology must be seen as a function of Figure 6 Janjo tutelary vessel (Ku'chan) enshrined at the base of a tree in Jen, Nigeria. Ceramic; c. 40 cm. May 1982. Photo by Maria C. Berns.</page><page sequence="15">Art, history, and gender: women and clay in West Africa 143 certain social negotiations leading to this gender division. Furthermore, drawing on the premise that creating a new technology could mean creating not only new artifacts but also a new world of social relations and myths, what would it mean to that system of relation ships and beliefs if a technology were transferred from one sex to the other? Thus, going along with the dominant presumption that the Nok, Ife, or Chad ceramics were sculpted by men, what would it have meant for men to have used a pottery-making technology - specifically coiling - associated normally with materials and processes identified with women? Or, if we argue that it was women who produced these archaeological ceramics, then even if men controlled their use did not women still contribute to their meaning in social or symbolic terms? The Rugange Bata situation, described above, illustrates this point; other examples could be cited from northern Nigeria, northern Cameroon and elsewhere (see David et al. 1988). All this suggests that we should begin to view technology in the Maussian terms Pfaffenberger (1988:249) proposes, as 'a phenomenon that marries the material, the social and the symbolic in a complex web of associations'. In looking more closely at technology, the role of women in its history must be acknow ledged more emphatically (see McGaw 1989). Pottery production is 'among the most longstanding of human technical achievements' although little has been written about the history of its development and the organization of its production (Wright 1991:194; see also Brown 1989). A history of pottery production in Africa or in other parts of the world is a history in which women have played a central role. The tendency to view women's pottery techniques as rudimentary is rooted in the same gender biases that have segregated women's work within a 'separate' and lesser domestic sphere than that in which men function. Instead, as I argue here, the focus should be on the ways the production of objects negotiates relationships between men and women as well as between people and the spirits that such objects often contain, locate, or represent. Such a re-evaluation of ceramic production also shows how women, through what they make, contribute to the construction of symbolic systems. Objects like pottery have the capacity to express and communicate ideas through form and decoration whether used in domestic or non-domestic contexts (see Braithwaite 1982). My own work on Ga'anda sacred ceramics shows that their decorative programmes refer to social transitions and responsibilities, particularly insofar as certain dominant design motifs relate graphically and linguistically to patterns of scarification on women's bodies, the key symbolic markers of socialization and femininization (see Berns 1988). Nigel Barley (1984) sees the role of West African women potters as instruments of social thought. According to Barley, pottery-making should be reconsidered as a metaphor for how people look at and structure their worlds, a view largely neglected because scholars have ascribed male dominance in modes of symbolic production and expression (see also Herbert forthcoming). Supporting Barley's point is the example of Mafa and Bulahay women of northern Cameroon who make figurative spirit vessels in the form of 'persons' to guard the smelting furnace. Nicholas David, Judy Sterner and Kodzo Gavua (1988) explain that these pots share with people the process of irreversible transformation - the first through fire and the second through enculturation - in the same way as the culturally privileged, exclusively male, iron smelting process does. Moreover, the decoration used to anthropomorphize such 'god' pots serves either to protect the spirit who is vulnerably contained within or to protect people who are at risk from the spirit's power. So if</page><page sequence="16">144 Maria C. Berns decoration is one intentional means by which people protect and control their destiny, then the fact that women make such vessels means they too contribute to negotiations of power between people and spirits as well as between men and women, as the female-produced pot guards the male-controlled smelt. The exclusion of women from certain domains of ritual activity should not undermine the importance of considering the symbolic value of what women make, particularly when what they make is central to those activities. While the lack of contextual data often hinders efforts archaeologically to determine patterns of production, use or meaning, the ethnographic record reveals how careful analyses of ceramic objects for their symbolic representations of and communications about social realities can yield new insights into history and art history. Such analyses must include inquiries about gender, since social and cultural meanings do not pre-exist in objects but are constructed through the social dynamics of their production and use. The linkages between artistic processes and other systems of meaning also bear investigation. For example, we have yet to explore fully the kinds of cosmological formulations found among some African peoples, like the Jukun (see Meek 1931) and the Fon, Lodagaa and Bini (see Ben-Amos 1986:60), which have gods creating the world by forming human bodies out of clay. If creator gods are conceptualized as potters, are they female or are they male? Might such ideological constructs then relate to valuations of what living women and men create, whether of clay or other materials? Herbert (forthcoming) cites the Jukun tradition (recorded by Meek 1931:189-90) that describes the second-ranking god, Ama, as creating people and things 'just as a wife sits making pots while her husband looks on seated in his chair'. While the gender of Ama (and other such creator spirits) may be ambiguous, clay, normally worked by women (as the Jukun tradition recounts), is still the primordial material out of which the earth or the first people were created. Herbert warns that to accept the unqualified equation of 'women: female earth:potting' denies the fact that men do make pottery and even pots containing powerful spirits. I would still argue that the ideological ties between women, the earth (clay) and procreation remain pre-eminent. Conclusions This discussion demonstrates that to avoid the unsubstantiated androcentric assumptions typically held about ceramics as those from Nok, Ife, the middle Niger, Komaland or the Chad Basin, more critical questions can and should be asked of the archaeological/art historical evidence than have been asked previously. Because art production is inextricably linked to belief systems, social relationships, and behaviours, it does make a difference in our reading of history to understand and reconstruct what women have made as well as what men have made. Re-evaluating the role of women in the production of ceramic sculpture over the past 2000 years (or more) changes the way Africa's art history is written. Until tangible proof confirms or refutes the identity of their makers in each historical instance, the weight of evidence compels the determination that women were, as likely as were men, the producers of such ceramic sculpture. Not being able to identify conclusively the creators of the archaeological ceramics of sub Saharan Africa should therefore not prevent asking the questions that direct research to exploring the strategies underlying the production of art and material culture. If we see the</page><page sequence="17">Art, history, and gender: women and clay in West Africa 145 role of historical inquiry as an attempt to understand human actions, then studying material culture and the gender of its producers is a critical facet of that inquiry. As Ian Hodder (1986:8) has argued, 'material culture and its associated meanings are played out as a part of social strategies'. The centrality of gender to social strategies makes its study necessary for a fuller understanding of how material culture works. The feminist challenge in archaeology calls for the creation of an explicit framework for the study of gender, which would lead to more inclusive interpretations of gender organization and material culture patterning (Conkey and Spector 1984). Indeed Margaret Conkey and Joan Gero (1991:5) emphasize that '. . . not to inquire into gender processes as they play out in historical and prehistorical contexts is to undermine the possibilities both for richer prehistories and for richer, more nuanced understandings - being sought and called for by many social scientists and others - of gender as historical process'. Likewise, the work of art historians has the potential for making significant contributions not only to the thinking of archaeo logists, but of anthropologists and historians who have only schematically considered what women make and how what they make helps construct social relations and meanings over time. The focus on women artists in cross-cultural studies of and approaches to gender can only enrich and expand our understanding of social dynamics, of history and of art history. A cknowledgements This paper is dedicated to Merrick Posnansky. It was he who introduced me to the rich world of African women potters when, in 1978, I participated in an archaeological field school he directed in Begho, Ghana. I spent two weeks with Bonakire women, studying their ceramic production, engaging in my first field research, and living with a family where the woman of the household was an active potter. This formative experience has left an indelible mark on my career, providing insights and memories that continue to influence my thinking. So, too, did another project initiated in a seminar I took with Professor Posnansky as a graduate student at UCLA - a critical evaluation of the putative 'Sao' ceramics of the Lake Chad Basin - a subject I still find fascinating and in need of further investigation. I continue to combine a respect for women's artistic production and an insistence on critical inquiry, learned, in part, through Merrick's teaching and example. This article developed out of a paper first delivered at the Chacmool conference on the archaeology of gender held in November 1989 at the University of Calgary, Alberta, Canada. I am grateful to the group of students in the Department of Archaeology who organized and ran this provocative and stimulating event. I had been intrigued by the avoidance of gender in discussions of such archaeological ceramics as those from Nok, Ife and the Chad Basin, and saw the opportunity to participate in this conference as a way to focus my thinking and research. As an art historian, it further provided a challenging interdisciplinary framework in which to evaluate the ceramic evidence in light of the work being done on issues of art and gender. I am grateful to my colleagues who have offered their comments and insights along the way. In particular, I would like to thank Lisa Aronson, Elizabeth Brown, Herbert Cole, Nicholas David, Eugenia Herbert, Rachel Hoff man, Roderick Mclntosh, Philip Ravenhill, Doran Ross, and Janet Spector for their helpful and encouraging responses to and suggestions for versions of this article. The original paper</page><page sequence="18">146 Maria C. Berns also was delivered at the 1989 African Studies Association Annual Meeting, Atlanta, Georgia. Endnotes 1 Henry Drewal (1989:71) also cites Willett's observations about the interiors of the Ife heads. Drewal, however, denies that their rough or smooth treatment is reason for determining the sex of their creators. 2 Jehann Teilhet undertook field research among the Longuda in 1968 under the auspices of the Nigerian Department of Antiquities (see Teilhet 1978). I returned to Dasumi's village of Guyuk in 1981, two years after her death. The shrine in which her Kwandalha were kept still survived in her husband's compound. 3 The early examples of Ku'chan collected by Frobenius and called 'ancestor pots' are in the Museum f?r Volkerkunde in Berlin (see Krieger 1969). They vary stylistically from those I documented in the field in 1982; however, fragments of the type Frobenius collected survive to show how this ceramic art has changed over time.
