The present volume is the outcome of a workshop organized by the SCIEM 2000 research program and the IFAPO, held in Beirut in 2000. As the editors declare in their introduction, the term "Lebanon" in the title is not strictly geographical, and the book encompasses a much larger cultural area stretching to the north (until Qatna and Ugarit) and much farther south (Transjordan and Egypt). This is somewhat disappointing, as a volume entirely dedicated to the archaeology of Lebanon strictly speaking would be very welcome. The first five papers deal with three important sites located within the strict borders of coastal and inland Lebanon. Claude Doumet-Serhal presents the results of the ongoing project of the renewed excavations in Sidon and discusses a sequence of strata dating from the Early Bronze Age III and well into the end of the Middle Bronze Age. Among the most important conclusions of the study of the sequence: the last phase of the EB is interpreted as a continuation rather than a break in the development of Sidon's material culture and as such shows clearer affinities to the north. The Middle Bronze Age is represented by twenty-five tombs covering five phases of the period. The most intriguing aspects of this sequence are the methods of burial (constructed warrior graves and jar burials) and the accompanying grave goods. These consist of a wide array of both imported objects Edited by Manfred Bietak and Ernst Czerny. Denkschriften der Gesamtakademie 50; Contributions to the Chronology of the Eastern Mediterranean 17. Vienna: Verlag der Osterreichischen Akademie der Wis senschaften, 2008. Pp. 256, with fig ures and maps. Paper, $140.00, ISBN 3-7001-6136-0. T 'his book is the seventeenth volume in the series Contributions to the and local types, enabling a correlation of the various phases with other regions in the eastern Mediterranean. Noteworthy among these are the metal weapons in phase 1, the Egyptian imported burial jar, the Levantine Painted Ware and the Minoan Kamares cup in phase 2, and the metal objects in phases 4 and 5. These, as well as the local pottery vessels found in the tombs, form a crucial step in the reconstruction of the chronology and the foreign rela tions of Sidon and the coast of Lebanon in general. Following is J. A. MacGillivray's discussion of the Minoan Kamares cup found in a clear phase 2 context. The detailed typological and chrono logical discussion places the cup within its wider background and highlights both its Cretan origin (in the Mesara Plain) and its relatively early date (MM IIA or early B) compared to other Kamares vessels imported to the Levant. Two papers are dedicated to the stratigraphic sequence of one of the most important coastal sites in Lebanon: Byblos. Yasmine Makaroun Bou-Assaf discusses the architectural evidence from the Dunand excavations in terms of building materials, construc tion techniques, and ground plans of the structures and recon structs their development throughout the sequence. The table comparing Dunand's periodization with Near Eastern periods and newly reconstructed architectural phases is very useful. Jean-Paul Thalmann's paper seeks to establish a similar sequence and cor relation of Byblite strata from a different aspect, that of the pot tery vessels and metal weapons. Thalmann uses the well-defined stratigraphic sequence of Tell Arqa, further north on the Leba nese coast, as a comparable corpus of vessel types and ceramic development. One of the most interesting conclusions is the reconstruction of a period of cultural continuity in the last quar ter of the third millennium, the so-called EB IV, similar to the main urban centers of the northern Syrian coast and inner Syria, in line with Doumet-Serhal's suggestion for the Sidon evidence. The last paper of the group dealing with Lebanese sites is Regine Pruzsinszky and Marlies Heinz's discussion of the texts from Kamed el-Loz (Kumidi) in the Lebanese Bekaa. The paper treats the nine cuneiform tablets found in the excavations of this site (or illegally excavated and attributed to it) in an attempt to reconstruct their chronology and set them in their historical con text. These texts are letters, part of the international correspon dence between the Egyptian pharaoh and his Levantine vassals and thus can serve as the basis for the correlation between the Egyptian chronological scheme and the stratigraphic sequence of Kumidi. Hopefully, the results of the renewed excavations at the site, directed by Marlies Heinz, will shed more light on material and cultural links attested by its archaeological remains between the southern Levant, Egypt, and Syria. Closing the first group of papers relating to Lebanon is a short note by Peter M. Fischer describing the find context of a jug dated to the latest part of the MB that seems to be influenced 202 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 73:2-3 (2010)</page><page sequence="2">IIBllBll?I?II?II?II?II?II^MIffl both from Chocolate-on-White and Cypriote Bichrome vessels. Petrographic analysis suggests that the jug was produced in the southern Lebanese coast, possibly the area of Beirut. The following four papers are dedicated to sites in Syria. Three deal with various aspects of the Bronze Age strata of Tell Mishrifeh/Qatna as revealed by the Italian component of the joint international project of excavations at the site. Marco Iamoni discusses plain wares attributed to the MB II and LB Ages, from a technological and typological perspec tive. More than seventy fabric groups were defined, showing a high degree of differentiation during the MB and the early LB and a prevalence of mineral-tempered fabrics toward the later phase of the LB. In terms of the shapes, the author suggests a trajectory of more closed shapes in the MB II, while open shapes dominate the assemblage of LB contexts. It should be stressed that Iamoni admits that the corpus is indeed partial and the methodology of the sherd count is not specified; despite this res ervation, it is commendable to see a discussion of plain pottery shapes that moves beyond the typological-chronological aspect and takes into account aspects of technology and production. Marta Luciani's paper also deals with pottery, the decorated and imported pottery from Building 6 in Operation K. The monu mental building's four phases cover the MB II and the LB I, following which in the LB IIA it was abandoned and built over. The corpus shows a trend of overall decrease in the percent age of decorated pottery and the dominance of painted over incised pottery in the LB. Local decorated and imported pottery is presented and illustrated by very useful color plates. Imported Cypriote pottery (WFJ WS, and BRI) appears only in the last phase of the building and contribute to its dating to the late fif teenth or early fourteenth century. The third paper, by Daniele Morandi Bonacossi, might have fit better as the first in the series of Qatna studies, since it addresses the EB to MB transition and the emergence of the complex urban society of the second mil lennium b.c.e. in Qatna. The paper includes a detailed descrip tion of the earliest phases on the acropolis, dated to the end of the EB IVB until the first phase of the MB I, with accompanying pottery tables. Despite the caution necessitated by the poor preservation of the remains, the sequence is important in recon structing the EB-MB transition. It shows clear continuity and an uninterrupted pottery sequence, with a functional change of the area (from agricultural storage to pottery manufacture) in the beginning of the second millennium and the MB phases. The last paper in this group, by Jaques Lagarce and Elisabeth du Puytison-Lagarce, discusses the end of the LB in the north ernmost site included in this volume, Ugarit and its subsidiary palaces in Ras Ibn-Hani. The authors offer a discussion of several texts found in Ras Ibn-Hani and their chronological and histori cal implications. They suggest the destruction of both the Maison jMj|^lHl|B]|^|B}[B][H|lBj aux Albatres at Ugarit and the Palais Nord in Ras Ibn-Hani at the beginning of the twelfth century b.c.e. Their paper presents several objects found in the Maison aux Albatres that highlight the active relations between Egypt and Ugarit and Ras Ibn-Hani, including alabaster vessels of various shapes, one bearing the cartouche of Rameses II, and an Egyptian figurine. Other objects found in the Palais Nord (an Ugaritic translation of a letter to Rameses II, a quartz scarab and a seal impression) can also be attributed to the reign of this pharaoh and support the later date of destruction of the edifice. An interesting phenomenon dis cerned in both structures is a final phase of architectural altera tions and overall deterioration of the structures prior to their final destruction. Similar phenomena were recently observed in the final phase of LB sites (Hazor, Megiddo, and Lachish) in the southern Levant and might be interpreted as cases of "crisis architecture" hinting at the social circumstances during those crisis years. The third and last group of three papers is dedicated to the Egyptian evidence, mainly from Tell el-Dab'a in the Nile Delta. David Aston offers an overview of the history of research of the Tell el-Yahudiyeh family, with a description of the various typologies suggested by scholars studying these ubiquitous ves sels. This very detailed discussion forms the background for a new typological and chronological scheme, based largely on the large corpus of Tell el-Yahudiyeh jugs and juglets found in strati fied contexts in Tell el-Dab'a. It is hoped that this new scheme, which is simple, coherent, and chronologically sound, will supply a common language for scholars working in Egypt, the Levant, and Cyprus. Karin Kopetzky presents the MB IIB ceramic corpus of Tell el-Dab'a and offers a detailed discussion of several families. These include the Tell el-Yahudiyeh jugs and juglets, in terms of both shapes and fabrics, Tell el-Yahudiyeh anthropomorphic and zoomorphic/ichthyomorphic vessels, the painted juglets that are imported from the Levant, the monochrome burnished jug lets, dipper juglets, platter bowls, carinated and globular bowls, jugs and storage jars, and miniature or model vessels of various shapes. Kopetzky discusses the active trade between Tell el Dab'a and the northern Levantine sphere, including the areas of northern Palestine and Lebanon, an observation supported also by petrographic analysis. This reconstruction indeed leaves the area of southern Palestine in the MB outside the realm of direct contacts with Tell el-Dab'a and the Egyptian delta sites. Finally, Robert Schiestl discusses the early MB "Asiatics" tombs of Tell el-Dab'a, comparing the building techniques and materials of the built tombs, their shapes, and the ground plan of the cemetery and discussing their local origin and possible foreign influences. He interprets the evidence as an intentional adoption of Egyptian traditions by Near Eastern inhabitants of this multicultural site. The volume, as usual in this series, is beautifully illustrated NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 73:2-3 (2010) 203</page><page sequence="3">with high-resolution photographs, well-executed line drawings and maps, and color plates. The book is no doubt an impor tant addition to the accumulating body of knowledge of Bronze Age material culture and history of the Levantine coast. It will become indispensible for scholars of history and material culture working within this area, and the archaeological corpora pre sented here will form the basis of renewed discussions and recon structions of this crucial area during the third and second millen nia b.c.e. The volume whets the appetite, and one hopes that the finds in other major Lebanese sites currently under excavation, such as Beirut, Kamed el-Loz, Tell el-Burak, and Tell Kazel, will be presented in a following volume. In a less practical vein, one can also hope that one day the political situation will not prevent a volume such as the present one from including Bronze Age sites in modern-day Israel.
