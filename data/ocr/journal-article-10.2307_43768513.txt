<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO SPARTAN WOMEN AND THE ELEUSINION SUSAN WALKER The Discovery of the "Aberdeen reliefs" On October 15th, 1803, the nineteen-year-old George Hamilton Gordon, Fourth Earl of Aberdeen, wrote in his diary: In a ruined chapel at Slavo-chorio I found two bas-reliefs of the greatest curiosity, they represent different articles appertaining to the toilette of a woman. Combs, paint, pins and there is a vase in the centre of which is inscribed the names apparently of two priestesses.1 The young earl, who knew his Pausanias (and was indeed later to become President of the Society of Antiquaries of London),2 suggested that the reliefs he had discovered reused in a Byzantine chapel in the village now renamed Amyklai most likely came from the Sanctuary of Dionysos at nearby Bryseai. According to Pausanias (3.20.4), only women entered the temenos to perform the rites. These comments were passed to the antiquary Robert Walpole, and engravings of the reliefs appeared as illustrations to a letter of Lord Aberdeen published by Walpole.3 In the fashion of the day the Earl had the reliefs shipped home to Britain.4 They remained in his possession until his death in 1860, following his political downfall after a vote of censure on the conduct of the Crimean War, for which he as Foreign Secretary bore responsibility, though his personal views were against intervention. His son, the Fifth Earl, presented the "Aberdeen Reliefs", as they were known, to the Trustees of the British Museum.5 The texts on the vessels in the centres of both reliefs were published by Sir Charles Newton in 1883;6 the reliefs themselves (Figs. 1-2) appeared as entries nos. 811 and 812 in the first volume of Arthur Smith's Catalogue of Greek Sculptures , published in 1892. Both Newton and Smith, writing without the benefit of modern topographical research upon the ancient territory of Sparta, took up the conjectured association of the reliefs with the Sanctuary of Dionysos at Bryseai. Following a remark made by Aberdeen,7 Smith noted (p.371) that the 1 Unpaginated entry, Lord Aberdeen's Mss.

The Sanctuary of Eleusinian Demeter at Kaly via The iconographical association of the reliefs with the worship of Demeter may be set alongside the epigraphic evidence (some thirty texts) and archaeological finds recovered since Lord Aberdeen's day, which point to the predominance in the area south of Sparta of the Sanctuary of Eleusinian Demeter at Kalyvia, located at the spring-line below the Taygetus mountains some 2 km west of Amyklai.8 It is with this sanctuary rather than with the archaeologically unexplored site at Bryseai that we may associate the "Aberdeen reliefs". In 1947 a catastrophic flood destroyed part of the modern village of Kalyvia, exposing in the river bed a series of kerbstones, some inscribed, and various votive offerings and inscribed tiles dedicated to Demeter. British scholars, who had long held a concession to excavate at Sparta, were called in to explore the area. Sadly, the perils of the then raging Civil War did not permit any more than a brief campaign under military escort. The tantalising results were reported in the Annual of the British School at Athens for 1950.Â® The finds, once housed in the village school, have since been moved to the storerooms of the Sparta Museum. The river at Kalyvia has now been diverted and the bed covered over with concrete. But, while a visit to present-day Kalyvia may hardly be described as archaeologically rewarding, it does offer a chance to understand the topography of the ancient site and its relationship to the Eurotas Valley.10 Evidence of the fertility of the soil, now densely planted with olives and citrus fruits, may be seen in the panoramic views north to Sparta and east to Amyklai, which may be obtained from the terrace of the church of Zoodikos Pighi. A fine Hellenistic or Roman bridge built on a north-south line at Xerokambos, some 15 km to the south of Kalyvia, suggests some communication between these settlements on the western spring-line, now isolated from the main route from Sparta to Gytheion, which runs through the centre of the valley." The finds from the brief campaign at Kalyvia do not of course offer the interpretative value of those recovered from a full excavation. In general terms, they represent an assemblage of votives typical of other Spartan sanctuaries (notably that of Artemis Orthia), with numerous lead wreaths, terracotta figurines and unattractive miniature ceramic vessels.12 The predominance of finds of the fourth century BC, a period of increasing display of private wealth at Sparta, may be more a reflection of the effects of the modern flood than of the history of the sanctuary. No evidence was found of substantial buildings. Nonetheless, the finds were recovered from a large area, suggesting that the sanctuary occupied a considerable tract of ground. Some provision was made for formal seating and apparently also for dining. Statues were erected in honour of some of the devotees. These and the surviving texts concern only women, an appropriate reflection of Aristotle's observation {Pol. 70-2) of the dominance of women in Spartan public life at this period. 8 See G. Kolbe, IG V.l. (Berlin, 1913), nos. 81,519, 567, 579, 581-4, 592, 595, 596, 604-8, 617, 623, 631, 151 1, and J. M. Cook, "Lakonia.

Our information is largely derived from the inscribed bases of statues honouring devotees and officials of the cult, mostly found in the ruined church of Aghia Sophia at Kalyvia.13 Many of the named officials held the office of thoinarmostria , normally translated as "mistress of the banquets"; some were also honoured as hestian poleos . It was the duty of the thoinarmostria , an official known only from inscriptions found in Lakonia and neighbouring Messenia, to organise the ritual banquets, ordering the correct quantities of oil, wine, cheese and other foods to be consumed, and ensuring that the rules of procedure were correctly observed.14 Other statues were set up by the city of Sparta, or, more intimately, by their male kinsmen, to honour those women not holding office who displayed the typically feminine virtues of philandria, sophrosyne, arete and eusebeia .'5 The women named on the "Aberdeen reliefs" It has been observed that the social milieu of the women honoured in the Spartan sanctuary of Eleusinian Demeter is almost invariably upper-class.16 This may indeed be said of the women named in the "Aberdeen reliefs". Anthousa, daughter of Damainetos, is peregrine and not further traceable in the rich records of Spartan prosopography. Claudia Ageta, on the other hand, is of senatorial family. It is she who offers some circumstantial evidence for the attribution of the "Aberdeen reliefs" to the Spartan Eleusinion. She is described in the text on the relief as hiereia. Her priesthood was probably hereditary; another text from the Eleusinion, most likely of Flavian date, describes a woman as hiereia apo genous tan Eleusinian .17 More pertinently, Ageta was first cousin to a brother and sister who were hereditary priest and priestess of the cult of Kore at Helos, near the Laconian coast.18 The two cults of Demeter and Kore are known to have been linked at the time the family held these priesthoods, for Pausanias notes (3.20.7) that "on fixed days they bring a cult-statue of Kore to the Eleusinion from Helos". Claudia Ageta has been identified as a grand-daughter of the Spartan senator Tiberius Claudius Brasidas, whose statue, now gracing the garden of Sparta Museum, was dedicated by his son Tiberius Claudius Pratolaus in a private setting, possibly that of a funerary garden.19 The emperor Marcus Aurelius heard a lawsuit concerning Brasidas, the will of his divorced and deceased former wife and their two sons. Whether or not as a result of the outcome of this dispute, which found in favour of the sons, the descendants of Brasidas remained prominent in the Spartan elite.20 The sons of Brasidas were adult at the time of the lawsuit. His grand-daughter Claudia Ageta, then, most likely held her priesthood at the end of the second century.21 Her colleague 13 Ibid., 261-3. 14 On thoinarmostriai , ibid., 279, and A. J.

She is described as hypostatria , dresser of the cult statue.22 The iconography of the "Aberdeen reliefs" and the cult of Demeter at Kaly via The objects depicted on the reliefs are identified in the Appendix (p. 136). In general, it may be observed that no major item of dress is represented. Most of the objects refer to the grooming, decoration and covering of the hair, face and feet, and perhaps also to the cleansing of the body. Twelve objects appear on both reliefs. Apart from the staffs (812.1), and the inscribed bowl (812.24), Claudia Ageta's relief contains no clear references to cult ritual. In contrast, eight objects which may be associated with religious rites are shown on Anthousa's relief: 811.1 and 15-21. The reliefs are cut from the same grey marble, most likely of Peloponnesian origin. However, Claudia Ageta's relief is of higher quality than Anthousa's. Indeed, the disparity in letter-forms suggested to Leake that the latter was of later date.23 This observation, supported by the different forms of the unguentaria (811.8 and 812.3 and 19), is, however, countered by prosopographical evidence, which suggests the reliefs are contemporary.24 The divergent quality and form of the two reliefs may alternatively be explained by the nature of Claudia Ageta's relief, a more expensive commission and in some respects deliberately archaising. Given the hereditary nature of her office, some of the vessels may have been in her family for generations. The snood (812.23) is one of only two known examples of Roman sprang.25 The assemblage of objects on both reliefs reflects the mundus muliebris depicted on Attic vases of the classical period, and used by vase-painters to suggest that the scene in question related to women's affairs, or took place in the gynaikonitis.26 We may also understand the objects on the "Aberdeen reliefs" as having both narrative and symbolic significance. Thus they may represent items used by the women during their terms of office, possibly for a specific festival which would thus have been commemorated on the reliefs, but they also tell the viewer that the cult of Demeter at Kalyvia was the concern of women, a characteristic reflected in the surviving inscriptions of classical, hellenistic and Roman date. With the exception of the kalathos 81 1.21, the objects do not recall any of the votives found in the post- war excavation of the classical sanctuary, nor is the assemblage strongly reminiscent of finds from other Roman sanctuaries of Demeter in the Greek world.27 It does, however, recall some of the votives given in the classical sanctuary of Brauronian Artemis.28 This too may be a reflection on the nature of the Spartan cult: apart from the staffs on Claudia Ageta's relief 22 On hypostatriai , cf. remarks made by Newton in his commentary on GIBM cxli (n.6). 23 Leake (n.4). 24 C.

The dominance of women and apparent exclusion of men suggests that, like the cult of Artemis at Brauron, which was concerned with female fertility and childbirth,29 the Spartan cult of Demeter was directed towards women's needs. The depiction on Anthousa's relief of a loincloth (81 1.5), a garment worn by women only during menstruation (and no doubt also after childbirth), would appear to support this view. The context of the "Aberdeen reliefs" 1. Funerary sculptures? The identification of the reliefs as funerary sculptures, a matter raised in discussion following presentation of a shorter version of this paper at the colloquium, may be rejected. Though the iconography of the "Aberdeen reliefs" is markedly similar to that of Roman imperial tombstones in Asia Minor,10 to the decoration of some Etruscan chamber-tombs,31 and, as noted above, to the decoration of some classical vases (both Attic and South Italian), most of which were found in tombs, no similar traditions are known in the funerary art of Roman Sparta. The texts do not address the viewer. The wreaths and staffs surrounding both reliefs explicitly refer to the cult of Demeter. The similarity between the "Aberdeen reliefs" and funerary art of various cultures may be explained by shared purpose of iconography: as suggested above, the objects evoke a world of particular concern to women, whether an idealised view of women's lives (as in funerary art), or (as in the, "Aberdeen reliefs"), a religious cult in which women are known to have been dominant and men apparently excluded. This does not, of course, imply that objects decorated in similar fashion were intended to serve the same function.32 2. A commemoration of priestly office? This would seem the likely purpose of the "Aberdeen reliefs". Given the nature of Anthousa's post as hypostatria , it is worth examining the possibility that the reliefs refer to the kosmesis of the cult statue.33 Several hellenistic inscriptions from Delos are concerned with the accounts for this process, with reference to the cults of Artemis and Hera.34 The same items are listed on most of the texts: sponges; nitron (sodium carbonate); oil, sometimes specified as white (i.e. pure, uncoloured); thread or cord; wax; oil or perfume of roses.35 Only the identification of sponges is certain on the "Aberdeen reliefs", though the glass unguentaria were evidently intended to hold perfume or oil, and it is possible that the mortars held nitron , which may have been mixed with oil to make soap. Needles are represented but not cord or wax. The vessels in the centre of each relief may be identified with some certainty as washing bowls.36 29 A. Kondis, ArchDelt 22 (1967) A, 156-206. L.

Proietti, La Tomba dei Rilievi a Cerveteri (Rome, 1986), 18-50: objects representing daily life at home are contrasted with objects of military significance, shown in another part of the tomb. 32 For a similar overlap between funerary and religious iconography, again concerning women, see G.

The texts are discussed by T. Homolle, BCH 14 (1890), 497-503. 35 For a commentary on these requirements, Homolle (n.34), 498-9. 36 M. J. Milne, "A Greek footbath in the Metropolitan Museum of Art", AJA 48 (1944), does not include the "Aberdeen reliefs" in her extensive list of Roman representations of washing-bowls, pp.5 1-63. The use of such bowls is well illustrated in a red-figured oinochoe from Ruvo: Schneider-Herrmann (n.33), pl.3, fig. 2 &amp; 2a (= B5, p.20), and, possibly for washing a statue, on a Campana relief in the Louvre: S. Reinach, Rep. Rei. II (1912), 284. 1 . A satyr takes a sponge from the bowl, which is held by a woman.</page><page sequence="6">S.WALKER 135 Kosmesis has been understood as a technical process equivalent to ganosis as described by Vitruvius.37 Kosmesis was undertaken not only for reasons of conservation of sculptures, but also to clean and decorate statues for festivities - prior, say, to their being carried in procession.38 The reliefs might then commemorate the preparation of the cult statue of Demeter for a specific occasion.39 This interpretation, however, does not account for all of the objects shown on the reliefs. Moreover, other epigraphic evidence from Delos clearly states that the cleansing and oiling of statues was undertaken by professional male kosmetai , who were paid a salary greater than that offered to sculptors and painters.40 Female kosmousai completed the preparation of statues by dressing them in woolen tunics and purple cloaks, by crowning them with golden crowns, and slipping rings on their fingers. One text specifies that these functions were performed by hiereiai.Ä] Alternatively, then, and perhaps more satisfactorily, we may understand the "Aberdeen reliefs" as commemorating the grooming not of the cult statue but of the women themselves, again possibly for a specific festival. A third interpretation would have the objects recalling the ritual purification of these and other women participants in the cult before entering the temenos , or perhaps before eating the banquets recorded on so many of the inscriptions from Kaly via. 42 It is even possible that the inscribed basins held water for such a purpose; their interiors are significantly more weathered than the surrounding decorated surfaces, suggesting that water may have been allowed to collect in them. At Eleusis, archaising statues of young women holding out water-basins were set beside the entrance to the sanctuary, for the use of visitors.43 The depiction on each relief of two pairs of sandals, each of different design, may be of significance here. Possibly one pair was worn before ablutions and the other afterwards. Similar sandals are shown on Roman tombstones from Nakoleia and Dorylaion (Phrygia); these are thought to recall visits to local mineral baths.44 The setting and later history of the reliefs The weathered basins imply that the reliefs were set horizontally as panels in the floor, in which visitors may have stepped, or upon a raised platform. The bird's-eye perspective employed for some of the objects, and the radial disposition of the objects on Anthousa's relief also suggest that the reliefs were intended to be seen from above. At 26 cm, however, the stones are too thick for paving. They are roughly worked on all but the decorated surfaces. Two channels 66 cm long and 2.5 cm deep, and 70 cm long and 3 cm deep, cut in the left side of Ageta's relief and along the top of Anthousa's relief, do not extend along the full length of the stones. They are unlikely to be of structural significance and may have helped drainage. Though the channels appear of ancient workmanship, they may not be contemporary with the 37 See Homolle (n.35), and P. Reutersward, Studien zur Polychromie der Plastik: Griechenland und Rom (Stockholm, 1960), 70. 38 On the annual preparation of a new statue of Dionysos for a festival, see Homolle (n.35), 499 and 502-3.

In late antiquity the reliefs were evidently set upright and back to back to support a millstone, traces of the action of which may still be seen on the upper surfaces of both reliefs. Conclusion The "Aberdeen reliefs" may with some confidence be associated with the cult of Eleusinian Demeter at Kalyvia. The priestess Claudia Ageta, a member of a senatorial family, typifies the interest in the cult shown by the Spartan elite. The decoration of the reliefs is concerned with cleansing and grooming, possibly of the cult statue but more likely of the officials named in the inscriptions or of other participants in the cult. The reliefs may commemorate a specific festival, but they also indicate that the cult was the concern of women, a feature confirmed by other evidence from Kalyvia. The apparent revival of the cult in the later second century AD, and a certain archaism in the iconography of the reliefs, are features typical of public life in later second century Achaia.45 APPENDIX: CATALOGUE OF THE OBJECTS DEPICTED ON THE "ABERDEEN RELIEFS" GR 1861.5-23.1 Sc.811.

Below are two bundles of laurel, wheat, poppies and vines, tied at the base of each bundle in the centre of the relief with a knot of Hercules. The corners of the relief are masked by calyces of leaves. The eight bundles, set in opposed pairs, are each too short to form a wreath. Each bundle faces in a different direction to its neighbour on the adjacent side of the stone. The disposition of the bundles may have purely decorative significance. However, the bundles on the short sides of the relief may be compared with the bound garlands or wreaths decorating the cistae carried by the monumental caryatids from Eleusis, where the laurel leaves are decorated with miniature poppies: L. Budde and R. V. Nicholls, A Catalogue of Sculpture in the Fitzwilliam Museum , Cambridge (Cambridge, 1964), 48, no. 81 and pl. 24-5. Mylonas (n.43), 159, identifies the same feature as a representation of the bacchos , a staff or myrtle branches bound with wool carried by initiates into the Eleusinian mysteries. On the caryatids and the "Aberdeen reliefs" the branches are of laurel, not myrtle, but their form is akin to that of the staffs carried by Hercules and Eumolpus on a pelike of the Eleusinian painter now in Leningrad: K. Schefold, Die GÃ¶ttersage in der klassischen und hellenistischen Kunst (Munich, 1981), 66-7, fig.80-81, and to the staffs represented on the "Regina vasorum" in the same collection: X. Gorbunova and I. Saverkina, Greek and Roman Antiquities in the Hermitage (Leningrad, 1975), pl. 74-75. The objects are described clockwise, starting in the centre of the top of the relief). 8 12.2.
