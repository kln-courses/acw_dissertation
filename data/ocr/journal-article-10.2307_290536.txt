<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS. In the construction of the text Silk has proceeded with cau- tion and good sense. He is a bit too anxious to conform his ninth century author's spelling to the standard that he assumes for him. The pages are too often defaced with such writings as tyrannis, ex&lt;s&gt;titit, let&lt;h&gt;argus, ob&lt;o&gt;edimus, necromantiam, fu&lt;t&gt;tile. In particular, it is assumed that Johannes assimilated his prepositions (attende and the like), whereas there was a clear tendency to dissimilation in writers of the period. More atten- tion might have been paid to the sources used by the author of the Commentary, yet that is a lengthy operation, to which a special article might now be devoted. I have noted a number of cases in which I believe Silk's text may be improved, sometimes with the help of R. The follow- ing will serve as specimens.

Such blemishes, if blemishes they are, are few and do not detract from the merits of Professor Silk's noteworthy contri- bution to Boethius, to John the Scot, and to the history of philosophical studies in the ninth century. E. K. RAND. HARVARD UNIVERSITY. P. VERGILI MARONIS AENEIDOS LIBER PRIMUS, edited with notes by the late ROBERT SEYMOUR CONWAY, Litt. D., F. B. A. Cambridge, 1935. Pp. xiv + 149. 8s. 6d. The task of a modern editor of Vergil (I must rather re- luctantly adopt Conway's spelling) is by no means easy. So traces of an ancestor of P with a manuscript of the D-line." For mente concipiebat (CD), P has mente considerebat nil concipiebat. He may have taken the doublet from some source outside his own inventiveness. If so, why is not his original reading concipiebat? Possibly he is draw- ing from Remigius, whose contributions often take the form of tautology. In that case the relation between P and R suggested by Silk may be reversed and D be right after all in 145, 6-10. 341</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. much has been written on the Aeneid through the ages, so much modern knowledge of philology and grammar, palaeography, religion, archaeology and topography can be brought to bear on the poem that an editor hardly knows what to do. He can, as Professor Pease did lately in his edition of the fourth Book, give us 568 pages of notes in which nearly all is recorded; we then have a storehouse of information from which the reader can select what he needs. Dr. Conway to my mind chose the better course. Setting out, as he modestly proposed to himself, to revise the Conington-Nettleship-Haverfield edition of the Aeneid he has given us in the 107 pages of this commentary on the first Book what is in fact far more than a revision. It is rather the residue of value which remained in his mind after the sifting of editions and commentaries from Servius to Henry and Norden and Fowler and the focussing of wide knowledge and interests on his lifelong love of the poet. The result is not a storehouse but a guide, which cannot fail to light the path of a modern student, for there is hardly a note which does not illuminate Vergil and many which are of great significance for the general study of Latin. The work has something of the quality of Munro's Lucretius. The notes are indeed almost an epitome of Conway's life as a student of Latin. As a foundation there are his earlier studies in philology and grammar, which gave him a peculiar insight into the meaning of words. Then there are the interests which he developed later in life in religion, archaeology and topog- raphy. And over all is the insight into Vergil as a poet, both on the technical and the literary side, which welds together and colours his other studies. We are told by Mr. Geoffrey Conway in his Preface that his father intended to add further notes on textual criticism, topography and archaeology; but, though the reader does miss a complete treatment of the text, yet the principal points of difficulty are dealt with, and topography (e. g. 159-69, and 246) and archaeology (294, 464, 488) are not unrepresented. There are good notes too on matters of religion on 258 fata, 292 Fides, 631 sacrifice in temples, 664 the peculiar spheres of action of numina. To illustrate these various interests attention may be called to some of the most striking notes. 1) Philology: 30 the so- called "reduplicated " forms, relliquiae etc., due to the alter- native form of the prefix red-, 60 neuter plural endings, 73 scansion of the cases of conubium, 388 quantity of the termina- tions of the fut. perf. ind. and perf. subj., 533 Italia meaning "the calf-land." 2) Grammar: 90 Vergil's avoidance of sub- ordinate clauses and consequent devices, 217 virtual or. obl., 251 construction of parenthetic infandum etc., 268 use of dum with perf. ind. 3) Meaning of words, perhaps the most valuable 342</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS. contribution of all: 33 moles, 77 fas, 93 and 655 duplex, 96 contingit, 110 and 616 immanis, 114 ingens, 256 libare, 479 interea, 499 exercet, 546 aura, 591 purpureus, 704 adolere, 726 laquearia and kindred words. From these notes there is always much to be learned both as to the original meaning and the historical development, and the comment always shows a fine instinct for the shade of meaning in the context. One may notice too sound discussions of passages of difficulty such as the opening lines, which Conway concludes that Vergil wrote but marked for deletion, 395-6 the alighting of the swans, 462 sunt lacrimae rerum, 636 munera laetitiamque dei, where Conway is emphatic that dei is Bacchus. Of great interest too are comments on wider topics such as 52 Vergil's use of the miraculous, 522 his use of rhetorical argument, and 534 and 636 the half-lines, which Conway thinks as against Sparrow are always signs of incompleteness. It could not be expected that a reader would always agree with the editor, but the places in which I feel doubt or diver- gence are few and far between. A mere layman in compara- tive philology may perhaps wonder whether (8) numen can " not merely come from nuo 'to nod,' but also be connected with the Greek :rveva "; spondaic words completing the fourth foot (26) were not used "at random " by Lucretius, but because he pre- ferred accent and ictus to coincide, whereas Vergil set them against one another. Animus is doubtless identical with av.veuo (57), but was Vergil conscious of this? and was it really the cause (149) of the Latin use of the plural in the emotional sense? Did the Roman of Vergil's day (177) use Ceres to mean " bread " and Venus to mean " charm " because he knew that in older Latin they had these impersonal meanings? I doubt too if Vergil had always in mind that fata meant "orac- les" (239, 258); this sense was sometimes there but often the word meant " destiny " to him. I do not understand the state- ment (320) that sinus "can hardly have been those of her tunic "; in the context I cannot see what else it could mean. It is not easy to believe (448) that the hypermetric nixaeque was " used to suggest the projection of the architraves "; and inani (464) surely means in the simplest sense that the paintings were unreal, not that their subjects "are in the irrevocable past." We shall have too to know a great deal more about the early religion of Italy before we can affirm with confidence (569) that "the expulsion of Saturn by Jove represents the conquest of a southern population by invaders from further north." But it is the sign of good work that it occasionally provokes opposition. To my mind this edition of Aeneid I is the most fully satisfactory of Conway's contributions to Latin criticism, 343</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. and it is a great loss to scholarship that he did not live to carry out his task. He is here at his wisest and best. CYRIL BAILEY. OXFORD. FERNAND CHAPOUTHIER. Les Dioscures au service d'une deesse (Bibl. des ec. franc. d'Athenes et de Rome, 137). E. de Boccard. Paris, 1935. Pp. viii + 381, with 16 plates and 67 figures. 60 fr. This is a model investigation, which has already received the unqualified praise of M. P. Nilsson (Gnomon, XII [1936], pp. 43 if.). Chapouthier is concerned with the monuments " ou les Dioscures, symmetriquement places, accompagnent une divinite feminine." After an amusing survey of the history of the problem, he classifies a series of related iconographic types. We have the goddess without attributes between two riders; we have the goddess (a) with attributes which are not distinctive; (b) with a crescent (or indicated simply by a crescent, without an anthropomorphic representation); (c) the goddess with nimbus; (d) the goddess with star; (e) the goddess who has easily recognizable emblems (Cybele or her equivalents, Ourania Hera, Ephesian Artemis, Hecate, Tyche, Astarte); (f) such emblems (lion, cornucopiae, ear of corn, Isiac sign, torch) between two pilei; (g) doubtful instances. All this is set forth in a clear and well-illustrated catalogue. Chapouthier then analyzes the chronological and geographical distribution of these forms, finding that, while somewhat am- biguous versions in the shorthand of coins occur in the third century B. C., full representations range from the end of the second century B. C. to the third century A. D. We shall consider the geographical facts later, but we may here note his observation that the dedicators of reliefs of this kind are pre- dominantly men.' He proceeds to show the coherence of these various series. He finds at the heart of the development the old group of Helen and the Dioscuri: the tree-goddess, from whom poetry had made a symbol of the beauty which catches the throat and masters the will, and the heroes of young manhood, chivalrous in aid.2 He reminds us that Helen remained a figure of cult,3 and then indi- 1We need a general study of the relative distribution of dedications to different gods and goddesses as between men and women. 2 Like Heracles and Dionysus, the Dioscuri were during and after the Hellentistic period regular types of men raised to godhead for services to humanity (e.g., Diels, Doxographi, p. 297). 8 Cf., above all, Herodotus, VI, 61, a very early aretalogy. 344</page></plain_text>
