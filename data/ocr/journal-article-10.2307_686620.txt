<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nagel's Translation of Teleological Statements: A Critique NAGEL'S TRANSLATION OF TELEOLOGICAL STATEMENTS: A CRITIQUE In recent years there have been many attempts to explicate the 'meaning' of teleological statements in biology. Some of the analyses were undertaken in order to prove that the use of these statements is 'congruent with the spirit of modern science'. For it was once feared that the expressions which are said to charac- terise teleological statements-'such typical locutions as "the function of", "the purpose of", "for the sake of", "in order that", and the like. . .' (Nagel [1961], p. 403)-had undesirable connotations. It is now generally agreed that these statements are thoroughly scientific and that 'teleological. . . statements in biology ... neither assert nor presuppose ... either manifest or latent purposes, aims, objectives, or goals' (p. 402). But even though their anthropomorphic innocence is widely acknowledged, the use of teleological statements in biology remains controversial. Disputes now center on their role in the reduction of biology to the physico-chemical sciences. In Chapter i2 of The Structure of Science, Ernest Nagel argues that the use in biology of expressions 'signifying a means-end nexus' does not indicate the pre- sence, in that science, of a distinctive type of explanation. For, he claims, state- ments which contain these expressions (teleological statements) can always be reformulated 'without loss of asserted content' into statements which do not contain them (nonteleological statements). He says, for example, that the teleo- logical statement 'The function of chlorophyll in plants is to enable plants to perform photosynthesis': appears to assert nothing that is not asserted by "Plants perform photo- synthesis only if they contain chlorophyll", or alternatively by "A necessary condition for the occurrence of photosynthesis in plants is the presence of chlorophyll". These latter statements do not explicitly ascribe a function to chlorophyll and in that sense are therefore not teleological formulations (p. 405). Nagel contends that the 'asserted content' of these teleological and nonteleo- logical statements is equivalent: 'the initial unexpanded statement about</page><page sequence="2">398 Vivien B. Shelanski chlorophyll appears to assert nothing that is not asserted by (the nonteleological formulations)' (p. 405). He maintains that the content of the former is 'fully conveyed' by the latter, and that the difference between the formulations is merely 'one of selective attention, rather than of asserted content' (p. 405)- This example, Nagel says, may be taken as a 'paradigm'; he then presents his general translation schema: when a function is ascribed to a constituent element in an organism, the content of the teleological statement is fully conveyed by another statement that is not explicitly teleological and that simply asserts a necessary (or possibly a necessary and sufficient) condition for the occurrence of a certain trait or activity of the organism (p. 405). Here Nagel claims that a teleological statement of the form (TI) 'The function of X is Y' can always be replaced by an equivalent nonteleological statement of the form (T2) 'Y only if X' (or, alternatively, 'X is necessary for Y'). The suggestion is, then, that the equivalence of the teleological and nonteleo- logical statements is not an empirical matter. For, according to Nagel, the equiva- lence of TI and T2 can be seen by an examination of the statements themselves- by an analysis of their 'meaning' or 'asserted content'. This means, presumably, that once we have the evidence to assert the teleological statement, TI, no additional evidence is required to assert the nonteleological statement, Tz. Of course, the whole point of Nagel's argument requires that the equivalence be independent of empirical evidence, since his express purpose is to show that teleological statements are always replaceable by equivalent nonteleological ones. If the equivalence were dependent on a case by case examination of empirical data, then the strongest claim that Nagel could make would be that sometimes teleological statements of the form TI are replaceable by nonteleological state- ments of the form T2-but that only empirical investigation can tell us when the replacement can be made. A claim of this sort, however, would threaten to reintroduce the spectre of that special sort of teleological explanation that it is Nagel's intention to eliminate. Two sorts of questions must be asked about Nagel's analysis. First, is the general translation schema correct? Are TI and Tz always equivalent in asserted content, or are there counter-examples? Second, is it true that the equivalence of the formulations is independent of empirical considerations? Does the equiva- lence depend on 'asserted content' alone? Consider Nagel's translation schema: he contends that TI, 'The function of X is Y' and Tz, 'Y only if X', are equivalent in meaning. The only difference between them, he says, is 'one of selective attention' (p. 405). However, there does seem to be an important difference between these statements which amounts to more than 'selective attention'. TI leaves open the possibility that something other than X could produce Y; Tz, however, explicitly precludes that possibility. Nagel and others are aware of this difference, but Nagel claims that it is not significant (and therefore that it does not affect his equivalence claim) and the others seem to have accepted his view.' Nagel acknowledges that the teleological 1 Morton Beckner, in The Biological Way of Thought, notes that the translation (T2) of the teleological statement (TI) is not identical with TI in asserted content: 'Tz says much more than TI. For even if it is true that chlorophyll is necessary for photosynthesis, TI</page><page sequence="3">Nagel's Translation of Teleological Statements: A Critique 399 statement 'The function of chlorophyll in plants is to enable plants to perform photosynthesis' does not preclude the possibility of an alternative mechanism, while the allegedly equivalent nonteleological statement 'A necessary condition for the occurrence of photosynthesis in plants is the presence of chlorophyll' does preclude an alternative mechanism. This difference, he argues, is irrelevant for the following reason: even though the existence of a green plant that performs photosynthesis without chlorophyll is logically possible, such a plant does not, in fact, exist. Merely logical possibilities, then, are irrelevant: teleological analyses in biology.. . are not explorations of merely logical possibilities, but deal with the actual functions of definite components in concretely given living systems (p. 404). In other words, teleological statements of function are equivalent to nonteleo- logical statements of necessary conditions if, by necessary, we mean factually rather than logically necessary. Nagel's argument can be rephrased in the following way: it is true that teleo- logical statements of the form TI leave open the possibility of alternative mechanisms, while nonteleological statements of the form T2 do not. But the statements are still equivalent. For although it is logically possible that some factor Z could produce Yjust as X does, nevertheless, as a matter of actual fact, only X does so. Yet this clearly means that the evidence for Nagel's equivalence claim is empirical: his contention that TI 'The function of X is Y' and Tz 'Y only if X' are equivalent rests on the empirical claim that there exist no cases in which some Z (different from X) produces Y. And this, as we shall now see, is false. Consider the following example. It is true to say that 'Bone marrow functions to produce blood cells', but it is false to assert either that 'Bone marrow is neces- sary for the production of blood cells' or that 'Blood cells are produced only if bone marrow is present'. For if the bone marrow is destroyed or diseased, the spleen and liver take over the function of producing blood cells in the body.1 Here we have a case in which the supposedly correlative statements 'The function of X is Y' and 'Y only if X' are clearly not equivalent. Y is not a necessary condition for X because, as a matter of actual fact, there is an alternative, Z. In this instance, then, the nonteleological statement cannot replace (and does not does not state that it is true.' (Beckner [1968], pp. 129-30.) But Beckner completely misses the significance of this point, for he then goes on to say: 'The elimination (of teleological statements) might be carried out by pencil-and-paper operations, in which appeal is made only to a translation schema, such as the one suggested by Nagel. For this one needs only knowledge of syntax and semantics.' (Beckner [I968], p. 131.) Here Beckner clearly implies that Nagel's translation schema relies solely on syntax and seman- tics. Yet if T2 differs from TI in the way that Beckner says it does, one needs to have additional evidence in order to replace TI by Tz. Nagel's schema transforms a function statement into a statement of necessary conditions. The latter is stronger than the former, and requires stronger evidence. Nagel's schema merely purports to rely on syntax and semantics alone; but in fact, to effect the translation, empirical data are needed. 1 It is true that in the normally functioning body, bone marrow alone functions to produce blood cells. For the spleen and liver to assume this role, the situation must be extra- ordinary. Nonetheless, the statement 'Bone marrow functions to produce blood cells' is true under all circumstances (normal or abnormal), whereas the statement 'Bone marrow is necessary for the production of blood cells' is not.</page><page sequence="4">400 Vivien B. Shelanski translate) the teleological one, because the former is false while the latter is true. Thus the translation schema is inadequate. We turn now to our second question: is it true that the 'equivalence' of the formulations follows from their 'asserted content' alone and that empirical evidence is irrelevant? To the contrary, empirical data are crucial. For Nagel defends his claim that the formulations are equivalent not by analysing the mean- ings ('asserted content') but by citing matters of fact. Let us look closely at Nagel's argument. He claims that the teleological statement 'The function of chlorophyll in plants is to enable plants to perform photosynthesis' is equivalent to the non- teleological statement 'Plants perform photosynthesis only if they contain chlorophyll'-despite the fact that the latter precludes the possibility of an alter- native mechanism, while the former does not. How does he defend his equiva- lence claim? Not, as we might expect, by examining the meanings of the state- ments, but by citing empirical data: It is certainly logically possible.., .that processes in living organisms produce starch without requiring chlorophyll... On the other hand, the above teleological explanation of the occurrence of chlorophyll in plants is presumably concerned with living organisms having determinite forms of organization and definite modes of behavior-in short, with the so-called "green plants." Accordingly, although living organisms.., .capable of maintaining themselves without processes involving the operation of chlorophyll are both abstractly and physically possible, there appears to be no evidence whatever that in view of the limited capacities green plants possess as a consequence of their actual mode of organization, these organisms can live without chlorophyll (p. 404). Here Nagel himself admits that the adequacy of the translation, the truth of the equivalence claim, rests entirely on matters of actual fact. Only empirical evidence can show whether or not the formulations are actually equivalent. Thus, whereas Nagel purports, on the one hand, to establish a purely logical point- that teleological and nonteleological statements are equivalent because of their 'asserted content'-he is nonetheless forced to admit, on the other hand, that this 'equivalence' can be established only in the light of empirical investigation. That Nagel's translation schema is inadequate, that 'The function of X is Y' and 'Y only if X' are not equivalent, can be shown in yet another way. Nagel advances the following argument to 'reinforce' his claim that the formulations are equivalent: if a teleological explanation had an asserted content different from the content of . . (a) nonteleological statement, it would be possible to cite procedures and evidence employed for establishing the former that differ from the procedures and evidence for warranting the latter (p. 405). But, he claims, there are no such differences-or at least no important ones. However, consider again the bone marrow example. To establish (a) Bone marrow functions to produce blood cells (teleological statement), one needs only to trace the production of the cells in many individuals. But to establish (b) 'Blood cells are produced only if bone marrow is present' (nonteleological</page><page sequence="5">Nagel's Translation of Teleological Statements: A Critique 401 statement), one needs to determine not only that bone marrow produces blood cells (the evidence for (a)), but also that no other organ or structure assumes (or is capable of assuming) this role in the absence of properly functioning bone mar- row. According to this 'evidential' criterion, then, the formulations are not equivalent. Indeed, if differences in evidence and procedure for justifying two statements are a sound indication of differences in their 'asserted content', it is doubtful whether Nagel's own chlorophyll-photosynthesis example holds up. Consider the correlative formulations: A. The function of chlorophyll in plants is to enable plants to perform photosynthesis. B. A necessary condition for the occurrence of photosynthesis in plants is the presence of chlorophyll. Despite Nagel's claim that they are equivalent, it is apparent that much stronger evidence is required to warrant B than to warrant A. Even if chlorophyll is, in fact, a necessary condition for the occurrence of photosynthesis, we do not need to know this in order to assert that chlorophyll has that function (teleological statement A.) We obviously do need to know it before we can assert the non- teleological statement B. In addition, different kinds of evidence are required in order to falsify A and B. Evidence which would disconfirm the nonteleological statement would not, at the same time, disconfirm the teleological one. For example, we would say that B is false if we could find some way of removing the chlorophyll and replacing it with another substance which also led to photo- synthesis in the plant. This would not mean, however, that A is false: it would still be true that the function of chlorophyll in plants is to enable the plant to perform photosynthesis-since this does not preclude the possibility that some other substance might also have that function. In view of the misfortunes of the verifiability criterion of meaning and its descendents, we are not entirely confident that differences in procedure and evidence for justifying (or falsifying) two statements are a sound indication of differences in their 'asserted content'. If they are however (and Nagel believes that they are), then the differences in evidence cited above-for Nagel's own photosynthesis case as well as our own bone marrow example-lead one to con- clude that Nagel's claim for the equivalence of the teleological and nonteleo- logical statements is as unwarranted by the present argument as it was by his earlier ones.
