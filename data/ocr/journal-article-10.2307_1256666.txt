<plain_text><page sequence="1">MAGIC AND RELIGION BY LORD RAGLAN A REGRETTABLE feature of modern science is that it is to a great extent carried on along lines which, if they are not exactly parallel, at any rate never meet. This feature is nowhere more apparent than in the science of man, and in particular that branch of it which is concerned with the study of magic. Students of this subject may be divided into four schools, the psychological, the environmental, the functional, and the historical. Let us start with the psychological school. Many psy- chologists, of course, devote themselves to such subjects as juvenile delinquency, and leave magical beliefs alone, but those who do discuss magical beliefs invariably assume that they arise from ideas innate in every human mind. Like all psychologists they ignore the past completely. If any psychologist has ever read a page of history, he is at pains to conceal the fact. Yet every idea in the human mind is conditioned by the social heritage, and this applies to magi- cal beliefs as much as to anything else. Perhaps more so, since while our ideas on most subjects show signs of change and development, in magic there are no new ideas at all. " We find," says Malinowski (Science, Religion and Reality, p. 70), "the conviction that onlyby an absolutely unmodified immaculate transmission does magic retain its efficiency. The slightest alteration from the original pattern would be fatal." Almost all magical beliefs are unquestionably pre- historic, and even the few which seem to be modern, such as the taboo on lighting three cigarettes with one match, retire further into the past the more closely they are studied. 115</page><page sequence="2">116 Magic and Religion Our language of metaphor consists largely of arrows, shields, torches and other survivals from the past. To ex- plain it we need not a psychologist but a historian. A psychologist is powerless to explain the even more ancient language of magic. If magical beliefs could be explained psychologically, they would have to be universal. Not only would all human beings have to be believers in magic, but magical beliefs would have to be the same all over the world. And this they are not; many magical beliefs are extremely widespread, but I know of none which can be shown to be universal. And what of those who do not believe in magic ? The fact that some of us do not believe in unlucky numbers, in the power of the evil eye, in the devastating potency of men- strual blood, in the ability of people to turn themselves into wolves or leopards, indicates, if I appreciate correctly the psychological position, that we are mental defectives, in that we are lacking in ideas which form part of the mental equipment of every normal human being. If this is not what the psychologists mean, then it is a pity that they do not express themselves more clearly. From the psychologists I turn to the environmental school, whose theories seem to be the exact opposite. According to the psychologists, magical ideas form part of the innate mental equipment of every human being, but according to the environmental school there is no such innate equipment. According to this school the mind of man is infinitely plastic, and a change of environment may produce a com- plete change of ideas. The Eskimo live in a totally different environment from, let us say, the Nagas, and therefore have a totally different stock of ideas. It is easy to take the ideas of the Arabs, in so far as they differ from our own, and to assume that these differences are due to the influence of the desert-easy, that is to say, if we ignore the fact that the great majority of Arabs do not, and never did, live in</page><page sequence="3">Magic and Religion I 17 the desert. If the environmental theory were the true one, we should find that the inhabitants of the Amazon basin had a culture almost exactly like those of the Congo basin, and totally different from that of the Andes. This, of course, they have not. So far as I know, no anthropologist believes in the environmental theory, but I understand that it is the orthodox one among geographers. Let us now consider the functionalists. It is true that they disclaim all interest in origins, but this is really an idle pretence. In the first place it is impossible to analyse a cultural trait without asking oneself how it could have come into existence, and in the second the functionalists, however much they may disclaim it, have in fact very dogmatic beliefs about social origins. No one, for example, is ad- mitted to the functional school unless he is prepared to swear that the clan grew out of the family. The theory of the functionalists is that magic arose as a response to social needs. It forms a kind of cement which causes savage society to cohere. Why it continues to exist in Europe they do not find it necessary to explain, since they do not recognise the existence of Europe. Anyhow they are quite certain that neither magic nor any other trait can exist in any savage society unless it is an integral part of the culture of that society, and unless it is necessary for the efficient functioning of that society. We can easily find, however, cases in which magic, far from cementing a savage society, has caused that society to lose useful arts, and so to go down in the cultural scale. Thurnwald points out that boat-building died out in the Torres Islands, weaving in Ureparapara and pottery-making in Santo, not because the people lost the art of construction, but because those who knew the proper magic died out, and the survivors would not construct without it. Similarly, Harrisson tells us that the loss of pottery-making in the New Hebrides may be due to the irksomeness of the taboos with which its manufacture</page><page sequence="4">118 Magic and Religion is surrounded. Whichever way it was comes to the same thing, namely that the existence of magical beliefs causes people to lose useful arts. We get a similar account from America, where, we are told, the Navaho claim to have dis- continued making baskets because the work was surrounded with a great number of ceremonial taboos and restrictions. How these taboos and restrictions are explained function- ally I have no idea. The psychologists, then, have a theory which depends on the non-existence of the past; the environmentalists have a theory which depends on the non-existence of any culture except the one which they are studying at the moment, and the functionalists have a theory which depends, among other things, on the non-existence of Europe. There are, however, some writers who are so certain that they know all about the origin of magic that they do not think it necessary to have any theory at all. " A warrior wearing a necklace of bearclaws for the first time," says Clark Wissler, " escapes injury in battle and automatically formulates it thus-bearclaws on the neck, invulnerability in a fight " (Man and Culture, p. 268). Wissler is one of the foremost of American anthropologists, and the fact that he can make such a statement shows how little clear thought there has been on the subject. Let us analyse his statement. In the first place we must assume, since the words "for the first time " are applied to the bear- claws and not to the battle, that the warrior is supposed to have been in battle before, and he would therefore have been under the necessity of attributing his survival to some cause other than the bearclaws. The most obvious cause to which a warrior would attribute his safety is his own prow- ess, and the next most obvious, the efficiency of his weapons. Other causes might be the support given to him by his friends, or the cowardice of the enemy. If he attributed his survival to one or more of these causes, why, on a later</page><page sequence="5">Magic and Religion 119 occasion, should he invoke the bearclaws ? And further, why should he do it automatically ? The only conceivable reason would be that he had heard that bearclaws were lucky. In that case, of course, he would not be formulating anything, but merely repeating what he had been told. Nor is there any reason why a man should go into battle wearing bearclaws at all unless he previously believed that there was virtue in them. Is it conceivable that the extreme sacred- ness of the bear in many parts of the world is due to the chance that a man wearing bearclaws once escaped with his life from a battle ? Of course it is not, and until people leave off composing such just-so stories we shall get no further. Nor are facile rationalisations of any greater value. It is often said that magic is primitive science. It is nothing of the kind. A scientist, whether primitive or modern, is a man who is trying to find out something. His methods, however crude they may be, involve logic, observation and experiment. The magician is not trying to find out any- thing. He has no use for logic, observation or experiment because he knows, or thinks he knows, all about it. He blindly performs rites which he has been taught to regard as essential or at least effective, and nothing that happens alters his attitude towards those rites. Before we are entitled to form any opinion as to the basis of magic, we must analyse magical rites as they are found all over the world, and when we do this, we find that they all have a great deal in common. A magical rite, then, consists usually of five elements-the preparation of the site; the preparation of the officiant; the preparation of the materials ; these together form the prologue to the rite, and then the rite itself consists of words and of actions. Let us start with the preparation of the site. We find that magical rites are usually performed at some special place, a particular building, well, tree, rock, etc. Sometimes the rite can be performed on any suitable spot, but then</page><page sequence="6">120 Magic and Religion the preparations are more elaborate. The preparations of the site take two forms. In the first place the area must be rendered fit by being swept, washed, sprinkled with blood, etc., or by having wands waved and spells recited over it. Secondly, it must be fenced off. This is done either by building an actual fence or wall round it, or by people going round it in procession, and thereby magically fencing it. Or it may be done merely by a form of words, as when at the Tynwald Court ceremony, in the Isle of Man, the Coroner of Glenfaba three times calls upon the audience to witness that the Court is fenced, before the business can begin. Now to the officiant. The first principle of magic is that nobody may perform a rite unless he is properly qualified. I shall return to this point presently, but here we must note that the officiant, though already qualified, must further qualify himself by the observance of food and sex taboos, ablutions, the wearing of special garments, or the smearing of his body with special pigments. The material preparations include the production of special stones, knives, vessels, etc., and the provision of animals to be sacrificed; alcoholic liquors to be drunk or poured out; special kinds of wood or aromatics to be burned. Then, when all is ready, we find that the actual ceremony consists of charms or spells which have to be recited in the traditional manner, accompanied by actions which are largely of a mimetic or symbolic character. An almost universal feature is that the rite is invalidated not merely by any error by the officiants but also by any intrusion or in- terruption by an unauthorised person or spectator. It seems unnecessary to give a description of a particular magical rite, since it will, I think, be recognised that rites containing the elements mentioned are found all over the savage world. Similar rites are described in European fairy- tales.</page><page sequence="7">Magic and Religion 121 It is to be noted that while these five elements are nearly always present, the emphasis on them varies considerably. Dr. Evans-Pritchard, for example, has compared the magic of the Zande with that of the Trobrianders, and has noted that whereas with the Trobrianders the form of words is more important than the action, with the Zande it is the other way round. And this although the general attitude towards magic of the two peoples, and the general form of their rites, are very similar (Am. Anth., 1929, p. 623). It can hardly be doubted that this comparatively slight differ- ence is due to historical, and not to functional or psycholo- gical causes. According to the psychological theory, all magical rites, being conditioned by exactly the same ideas or emotions, should be exactly the same, while according to the functional theory, by which every group devises rites to suit its own particular needs, there is no reason why there should be any resemblances at all. It would be quite easy for people of very little imagination to devise magical rites in which none of the five elements which I have mentioned appeared. We find, however, that these elements not merely form part of the magical rites of all savages, but also that they characterise the rituals of the great religions of the world. We find that in these the officiant prepares himself by fasting, and by donning special garments ; that the rites are performed at, and as a rule only at, sanctified spots; that special implements and vessels are used; that the action performed and the words used are often fixed by tradition in forms which permit of not even the slightest deviation. One point to be noted in both magical and religious ritual is that the officiant, however great the wonders which he performs, never professes to be able to make anything out of nothing. The African rainmaker can make rain, but in order to do this he has to pour beer upon the sacred stones. Cinderella's fairy godmother can make a coach and horses,</page><page sequence="8">122 Magic and Religion but she has to have a pumpkin and rats wherwith to make them. And this feature is by no means peculiar to magic, since we find it again and again in the Bible. God makes man from the dust of the earth and manna from the dew. Moses can make a serpent out of a wand, and Elisha can create an unfailing supply of oil, given some oil to start with. In the same way the Christ of the Gospels makes wine out of water and a meal for a multitude out of seven loaves and two fishes. Finally we are told, in a passage that reminds us of the myth of Deucalion, that God can " of these stones " raise up children to Abraham. This consistency, for so it seems to be, suggests the existence of some theory. We shall return to this point. Another feature which magical and religious rites have in common is that they are both owned, that is to say that they can only be performed, by persons who have, in one way or another, acquired proprietary rights in them. In most religions we find that rites, or at all events rites of any importance, can be performed only by priests. These priests are always hereditary. This does not necessarily mean that they must actually be the sons of their pre- decessors, though that is often the rule, but usually that they acquire a fictitious sonship by means of a rite of adop- tion. The apostolic succession is the form of adoption most familiar to us, but Buddhism has analogous rites. Islam has, of course, no ordained priesthood, but descent from the prophet, real or fictitious, plays a prominent part. In Hinduism, of course, all priesthood is hereditary. We may also note that whatever the position of women, they can seldom perform religious rites. The same applies to magic. The right to perform most magical rites is hereditary. Among most savages the most important rites can be performed only by hereditary chiefs, whose chieftainship often consists solely in their ability to perform these rites.</page><page sequence="9">Magic and Religion 123 Professor Malinowski tells us (p. 457) that " magic tends in all its manifestations to become specialised, exclusive, departmental and hereditary within a family or clan." It does not appear, however; that he was in the Trobriands long enough to observe the process of becoming, so that all that he is entitled to vouch for is that magic is in fact hereditary. Among the Zande, according to Dr. Evans-Pritchard (op. cit. p. 633), magic is as a rule the property of individual men, who can hand it on to their sons, or even sell it or give it away. Here, as everywhere else, magic is not something which wells up spontaneously from the subconscious, but a form of property which belongs to members of a priestly corporation, or to other individuals, who have the right to pass it on in accordance with the provisions of a recognised code of rules. There are magical rites which are known to all, but they are of little importance. Evans-Pritchard con- cludes that all important magic is in the hands of a few men, and that the more it spreads, the less important it becomes. We find the same thing in religion. Sacraments lose their importance if they are performed by others than members of a priestly corporation, and among ourselves the most im- portant rite, that of crowning the King, is reserved to one man. Evans-Pritchard also tells us that in the opinion of the Zande, women ought not to practise magic, which is a field reserved for men. A similar opinion has often found ex- pression at church congresses in this country. We see, then, that there are many resemblances between magic and religion, both in the general form of the rites, and in particular features, such as the exclusion of women, the heredity of the priesthood or magicianship, and the apparent limitation, which has been extended to the deity, on the creative powers of miracle-workers. These are some of the facts which must be taken into account if we are going to</page><page sequence="10">124 Magic and Religion consider in a scientific manner the relationship between magic and religion. The resemblances are sufficient to in- dicate a close relationship-I do not think that anyone will disagree with that-but the question which then arises is whether religion is the offspring of magic, or magic the off- spring of religion. It is because the facts which I have just mentioned, as well as others which I shall come to presently, have not been taken into account in considering this matter, that I have been emboldened to embark upon this paper. The consideration of these facts has driven me to the con- clusion that magic is the offspring of religion. I do not mean by this that magic is in any sense the heir of religion, but rather that the magicians are the descendants of those who carried off crumbs from the table of religion into the back- woods, and there preserved them in a more or less decayed or fossilised form. Everyone is familiar with the distinction which Frazer draws between magic and religion (G.B., vol. i, p. 222). Religion consists of " a belief in powers higher than man and an attempt to propitiate and please them," while magic assumes that all personal beings, whether human or divine, are subject to those impersonal forces which control all things, but which nevertheless can be turned to account by anyone who knows how to manipulate them by the appro- priate ceremonies and spells. He goes on to say that " a consideration of the fundamental notions of magic and religion may incline us to surmise that magic is older than religion. Obviously the conception of personal agents is more complex than a simple recpgnition of the similarity or contiguity of ideas." He assumes, that is to say, that magic is based upon ab- stract theories, of a simpler type than the theories upon which he supposes religion to be based, and if this were so, then there would be a good deal to be said in favour of his view. But it is not so; there is no theoretical basis to</page><page sequence="11">Magic and Religion 125 magic at all. This not only is but must be so, since it is impossible for savages, or any other illiterates, to form theories. This arises not from any mental inferiority or deficiency, but from the simple fact that a theory is an idea which has been expressed in writing. Ideas which have not been expressed in writing are of necessity too vague to deserve the name of theory. We ourselves have no theories of anything which we have not written about or read about. This fact is not generally realised because scientists have, till quite recently, assumed that all mind is exactly similar to the literate mind, the only mind with which they were acquainted. On the assumption that all mind was the same as the literate mind it was as easy and as fallacious to credit savages and children with theories of magic as it was to credit beavers with theories of engineering or bees with theories of food preservation. They act as we should not act unless our actions were based on a theory; therefore their actions must be based on a theory. The older biolo- gists thus interpreted the actions of animals, and Frazer, as well as many other anthropologists, thus interprets the actions of savages. But magic is a system not of ideas but of actions, and the savage performs his magical rites simply because he has been taught by his parents that it is the correct thing to do. His beliefs about them are not theor- etical beliefs but practical beliefs, beliefs, that is to say, that in order to accomplish that, it is necessary to do this. Dr. Evans-Pritchard, whom I make no apology for citing again, shows that many of the beliefs of the Zande are quite incon- sistent with one another, but they are not felt to be incon- sistent because they occur in different contexts. They are not brought into conflict by any theory because there are no theories (Witchcraft, pp. 25, 475). It is the same among ourselves. Many English people are addicted to such magical practices as touching wood, throw- ing salt over the left shoulder, or avoiding ladders. They</page><page sequence="12">126 Magic and Religion will tell you that the non-observance of these rites is un- lucky, but so far as I can learn nobody has any theory what- ever as to the nature or modus 6perandi of the forces which might be supposed to cause the ill-luck. The attitude of English people to these rites is the same as that of those who practise magic in every other part of the world; it is not merely non-theoretical and non-speculative, but quite unreflecting. We see, then, that while the theory of magic, as defined by Frazer, may be simpler than the theory of religion, this is unimportant, since what we have to consider is not theory but practice. In practice it is much simpler to try to please a stronger man than to seek to bend impersonal forces to our will. And the more complex practice is likely to be the derived and not the original practice. I am inclined to think that " mana " and all the other impersonal forces which figure in magic are the remains of gods reduced to the state to which gods must descend when their cults become purely magical ; the rulers of the world reduced to penny-in- the-slot status. To return to Frazer-his argument has another flaw, in that he makes the savage not merely a consistent thinker, but a consistently erroneous thinker, a man who is always setting himself problems and always getting the wrong answers. Those of us who have lived among savages know that the savage is not like that at all. He never sets himself problems, but in the ordinary affairs of life he shows plenty of intelligence and common sense. He is, in fact, not very different from the English countryman, who also has no theories, but knows a lot. To him, magic is not something that arises out of the present but is a legacy from the past, which he does not reject because he is accustomed to it, and because he lacks the mental training which would enable him to throw it off. That he lacks this training is not sur- prising, since it seems that even our universities have not</page><page sequence="13">Magic and Religion 127 yet invented a form of mental training which will wean students from taking mascots into examinations. The belief that magic arose out of the simple desires of simple people is expressed in a rather different way by Goldenweiser, who assures us that " all the data indicate that the more primitive forms of supernatural creatures and magical devices are associated with single or at any rate simple purposes and functions. A primal magical rite is for fertility, protection, success in hunting or in love; a prim- itive spirit is of sickness or famine, of craftsmanship or valour " (Anthropology, p. 521). It is impossible to lay one's hands upon the data upon which Goldenweiser relies, since primal man has of course long since disappeared, carrying his beliefs with him. So far as I know, we do not find among modern savages any such spirits as Goldenweiser postulates, and even if we did we should be no better off, since modern savages can only by a misuse of language be described as primitive. Goldenweiser also assures us that " the belief in spirits is a basic, natural trait ; people believe in spirits almost as naturally as they love or hate " (ib. p. 472). Dear, oh dear ! It is dreadful to think that those of us who do not believe in ghosts must be devoid, or almost devoid, of all natural feeling. Whatever may have been the primal state of affairs, which nobody except Golden- weiser can know for certain, we find in all religions a great deal of specialisation. Even in Christianity, particular saints are regarded as having a special interest in particular activities. It is the same with magic; the mana, baraka and so on of the Old World find their counterpart in the wakan and orenda of the New. All these, like the unspecified power which punishes those who walk under ladders, are com- pletely vague, and completely devoid of any recognisable at- tributes. So that even if Goldenweiserwere right about primal man, which we have no reason to suppose, present-day magic is still further from the primitive than present-day religion.</page><page sequence="14">128 Magic and Religion And now to the rites which, as we have seen, are the essence of magic. Goldenweiser says that a primal magical rite is for success in hunting or some other simple purpose. He is here at one with the psychologists, who derive magical rites from the subconscious or some other inside source. But if this were so, then every rite would be related solely to its own special purpose, independently of every other rite. This, emphatically, is not the case. Not only, as I have already pointed out, are all rites developed upon the same pattern, with the same qualifications and limitations for those who perform them, but many of them are extremely ill adapted to the purposes for which they are performed. We find rites for success in war in which the warriors starve themselves till they are almost too weak to fight; rites for fertility in which the participants have to remain continent, or even to emasculate themselves; rites of fire-walking, which bear no relation at all to whatever purpose they are believed to forward. It is easy enough to pick out some simple rite, such as jumping to make the corn grow, and to conclude that all magic is based upon simple wish-fulfil- ments, just as easy as it is to pick out the giraffe's long neck and explain evolution as the result of simple wish fulfil- ments, but the true solutions of these problems must go a great deal further than that. They must start by explaining not merely why so many rites are apparently so inappro- priate, but why the magical setting should be the same whether the magician's object is to cure toothache, make poison, cause wild beasts to destroy his enemy's crops or the rain to fall upon his own. In all these cases the ritual is very much the same; in fact there is considerable support for Dr. Perry's view that all the rituals in the world are variants of the same ritual. The view which I am contesting is that religious rites are derived from magical rites, and that these are based upon natural psychological causes. Let us consider our own</page><page sequence="15">Magic and Religion 129 wedding and funeral rites. According to the psychological view people feel joyful at weddings, which presage increased fertility and strength to the community, and devise simple magical rites to express their joy and at the same time to induce fertility in the bridal couple. At funerals they ex- press sorrow at the loss of a relative and a weakening of the community through his loss, coupled with a wish to keep his spirit from returning and troubling them. On this basis the magical rites for a wedding and a funeral should be as different as chalk from cheese, and the religious rites, being derived from the magical rites, should be equally different. When, however, we examine our own wedding and funeral rites, we find that they are almost exactly the same. The bride and the corpse are both dressed in white and adorned with wreaths of white flowers. Both enter the church by the west door; both go in procession, preceded by the clergy and escorted by their nearest male relatives. Both stop at the chancel steps, and there is then a service which follows the same form and in part the same words. There is then a triumphal procession; to the strains of a march the corpse, or the bridal couple, as the case may be, leads the whole congregation out of the church. In the case of a funeral, the whole congregation escorts the corpse to its resting-place, a chamber decked with green leaves, in which it is shut. It was formerly the custom for the whole congregation to es- cort the bridal couple to the nuptial chamber, and there leave them shut in. Whether the nuptial chamber was also decorated with greenery I cannot find out, but probably it was. Other features are that the lych-gate is opened for both parties, and that both parties are sprinkled, the corpse with earth and the bridal couple with rice. Before the ceremony the bride and'the corpse both have, or had, a ceremonial bath, and the proceedings terminate with a feast given to the congregation by the relatives of the bride or corpse, as the case may be. I</page><page sequence="16">130 Magic and Religion Some of these features, such as the white robe and garland of white flowers, are also associated with the christening ceremony, which is itself, of course, a ritual bath. These resemblances are probably due to the carrying over into Christianity of the rites de passage of earlier religion, together with a faint recollection that these rites are really appropriate only to royalties. To discuss them further would be to go outside the scope of this paper, but I would only say that to me they seem essentially religious. The whole ritual of these rites de passage is based upon the idea of a progress towards the divine, a progress which does not end at death. It seems to me totally different from magic, as magic is described by Frazet or Goldenweiser, that is to say as a process of bringing about useful ends by the manipu- lation of impersonal forces. We find, of course, initiation rites among savages, and by labelling these savages as primitive, and assuming that all their traits are older than the traits of the more civilised, it of course becomes possible to assert that savage initiation rites are ancestral to those of the more civilised. By this argument it is also possible to maintain that the crude fire- arms manufactured by the wild tribes of the Indian Frontier are ancestral to the firearms of Europe. Initiation rites, and all other religious rites practised by literate communities, are systematic and are based upon coherent theories. The analogous rites of illiterate savages are unsystematic, and are not based upon any theory. No more are the super- stitions of Europe, to which they are strictly comparable. Religion is ritual linked with theology, and the idea that theology is something which springs suddenly into existence and links up with hitherto meaningless magical rites is one which seems to me quite untenable. On the other hand, it often happens that rites continue to be performed after the reason which validated them has been forgotten. This is how I suppose magic to have originated.</page><page sequence="17">Magic and Religion 13 To suppose that religion grew out of magic, we should have to suppose that magic itself contained the seeds of growth. And this it does not. Magic never changes. It either goes on just as it was, or else it dies out. This is because, unlike religion, it is an end product. In religion we have heresies, schisms, and reformations, but it is impossible to imagine anyone trying to reform magic. If magic is incapable of reformation, that is of improvement, how could religion arise out of it ? Nor is it easy to imagine how the idea of gods could arise from cults of impersonal forces, whereas it seems quite easy to see how impersonal, forces could be derived from gods. I said a little while ago that " mana " and so on are the reduced remains of gods, and I will try to show how I suppose this to have come about. Our superstitions of today are, I suggest, in no way primal or primitive, but are broken down fragments of ancient religious rituals. Let us take the taboo against sitting down thirteen, which seems to me a thoroughly representative superstition, senseless, meaningless, of no conceivable value to man, either civilised or savage. The ill-luck which is believed to fall upon the breaker of the taboo has, so far as I can learn, no connection with any deity or religious belief. It is an impersonal force. The superstition has been plausibly explained as being de- rived from a time when the thirteenth at table was the divine victim. That is to say, it was once religious and personal, and had a meaning. Now it is magical, impersonal and meaningless. Everything that is not human and personal is meaningless to us. Our ancestors believed that the sun, moon and stars had been made by an anthropomorphic deity for the especial benefit of man. They were thus linked with humanity, and their meaning was obvious. We have discarded that belief, and as a result the universe has become meaningless. We know that the stars exist, but we have no idea why they</page><page sequence="18">132 Magic and Religion exist. The great difference between the mediaeval theo- logian and the modern scientist is that the former thought he knew what, and was quite sure he knew why. The latter thinks he knows what, but makes no pretence of knowing why. We believe that the sun's movements are controlled by an impersonal force. Our religious ancestors believed that it was guided by an anthropomorphic deity. But according to the orthodox anthropologists the primitive belief was that the sun's movements are controlled by an impersonal force. Have we then merely gone back to the primitive ? All the writers to whom I have referred regard the change or development from magic to religion as a great step in human progress. Frazer says that it can only have been brought about by the deeper minds. Was this great step which was taken by the deeper minds the discovery that the sun, instead of being controlled by impersonal forces, was a chariot driven by a divine but invisible man ? This would clearly be a step down and not a step up, just as it would be a step down if we were to decide that the electric light is not due to an impersonal force, but to the fiery breath of a giant. To assert that the beginnings of religion consisted in the adoption of such beliefs, and at the same time to maintain that the adoption of religious beliefs was a great step forward made by the deeper minds, seems to me a contradiction. The mistake lies in supposing that the savage believes in " impersonal " forces in the sense in which we use the word " impersonal." In a sense they are impersonal because they are unformulated, or because the formula has been lost. Savages, even those who practise only what we call magic, probably once had gods, and in some cases the names of these gods survive in charms or spells. They are not recog- nised as gods because it is the custom to assume that any name which occurs in a savage tradition is that of a historic</page><page sequence="19">Magic and Religion 133 chief. The savage says that the wonder-worker lived a little before his father's time, and the European enquirer, not realising that time exists only for the literate, says- " Oh, this cannot be his god; it must be his grandfather." But even apart from this, it is doubtful how far the so- called impersonal forces are really impersonal. There is a good deal of evidence that all of them, from the Ancient Egyptian " heka " to the Polynesian " mana " are really personal. They are names for the essential virtue to the possession of which gods and divine persons owe their divinity. I have, I hope, shown that a good theoretical case can be made out for concluding that the impersonal beliefs of the magicians are derived from the personal beliefs of the priests, but a theoretical case is unsatisfactory, unless it can be re- inforced by a demonstration of the actual process, and I propose to conclude by attempting this. It is well known that the most important feature in the religions of the Ancient East was the Creation Rite, an elaborate ceremony lasting several days in which the parts of the gods were taken both by statues and by kings and priests, and in which the world was ritually destroyed, and then recreated. A portion of this ceremony, according to Hocart (Kingship, p. 202), is described in the first chapter of Genesis. Now Mr. Gadd (Myth and Ritual, p. 66) describes a Babylonian rite for the cure of toothache, in which this creation rite is brought into play. A part of the story of creation is recited, and the worm which is supposed to cause the toothache is brought into contact with Ea, the sun-god. The priest takes the part of Ea, and in that capacity curses the worm. What we should call a magical rite is thus based upon a religious ceremony. Professor Hooke (Origin of Early Semitic Ritual, p. 20) describes another Babylonian rite intended to cure a sick man who has been attacked by a demon. After offerings</page><page sequence="20">134 Magic and Religion and invocations, a bed is prepared for Tammuz, and the sick man stands at the foot and covers his face. The priest then strikes him seven times with a seven-knotted cord. This changes his personality, and he now becomes Tammuz, strikes himself, and invokes Ishtar to save her people. The priest then cuts the hair from the sick man's forehead, re- moves his girdle, and throws them, together with food offerings, into the river. The patient then fasts in sackcloth for three days. If we leave out the references to the gods, we get a magical ceremony such as is performed by medicine men all over the savage world. These ceremonies are, in themselves, pure folly, and are given meaning only by the references to the gods, and the theological beliefs which these connote. In Egypt, as in Babylonia, disease was believed to be caused by the presence of demons, and the medicine man began his treatment by adopting the r61le of Re or Horus. Here also we find cords with seven knots, and each knot is sometimes identified with a god. In an Egyptian cure for snake-bite, the medicine man assumes the r61le of Horus, and in that capacity orders the poison to flow out upon the ground. (W. R. Dawson, Magician and Leech, pp. 56, 67). He cannot exercise power in his own person, but if he can, by the appropriate rites, transform himself into the god, then he can exercise the powers which pertain to that god. And this is what we find everywhere. The magician has no powers of himself, but only the powers which he obtains through the rites. Dr. A. B. Cook (Zeus, I, p. ii) tells us that unsophisticated man seeks to control the weather " by a sheer assertion of his own will power expressed in the naive arts of magic," So far as we know, no unsophisticated man has ever attempted anything of the kind. The magician is, or thinks he is, highly sophisticated and he attempts to achieve his end not by the assertion of his own will power, but by the perform-</page><page sequence="21">Magic and Religion 135 ance of rites which, far from being nai've, are extremely complex and completely stereotyped. Religious rites are linked with theological dogmas, and have no meaning apart from those dogmas. Magical rites are distinguishable from religious rites in that they are linked with no dogmas, and are therefore meaningless. By saying that they are meaningless, I do not mean that they have no purpose, but that their purpose, or alleged purpose, is not linked up by any theory with the means adopted to achieve it. Your purpose in saluting a magpie may be to avoid a road accident. If you had any theory of the relation between the ruling powers, magpies and road accidents, this would be a religious rite, but since you have not, it is pure magic. It is here that I join issue with Professor Malinowski. He (op. cit., p. 38) compares a rite carried out to prevent a death in childbed with a ceremony in celebration of a birth, and says that the former has a definite purpose while the latter has none. " This difference will serve us as a prima facie distinction between magic and religion. While in the magical act the underlying aim is always clear, straightforward and definite, in the religious ceremony there is no purpose directed towards a subsequent event." We see here a good example of the disadvantage of ignoring Europe. If Professor Malinowski were to study an ordinary English marriage, he would find that the religious ceremony has a recognised purpose and meaning, whereas the magical rites, such as throwing shoes, which normally precede and follow it, though they may have the vague purpose of bringing luck, have no known meaning at all. Though the natives manage to rationalise to some extent some of the rites which Professor Malinowski describes, this does not alter the fact that they are all traditional, magical and meaningless. My suggestion then is that religion consists of ritual</page><page sequence="22">136 Magic and Religion practices linked with theological dogmas, and that magic consists of ritual practices which are followed blindly after their theological basis has been forgotten. To this it has been objected that some of the Stone Age cultures of Europe, in their burials and their rock paintings, afford evidence of magical practices. To this I would reply in the first place that none of the cultures of Stone Age Europe are of European origin, and they can therefore tell us nothing of the origin of religion or magic. In the second place, even if a trace of the beginnings of religion were found, and even if it were found to bear some resemblance to magic, it would still be necessary to differentiate it clearly from the magic of today, since all those who have studied the latter agree, whatever else they may say about it, that it is very far removed from the beginnings of anything.
