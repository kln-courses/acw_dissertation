The “Folk” and their “Lore” as Tropes in the   Reconstruction of Rabbinic Culture D I N A  S T E I N For my teacher, Galit Hasan-Rokem A b S T r A c T This article argues that “ folklore” has served as a narratological device in modern  scholarship of rabbinic culture; rather then reflecting rabbinic history, “ folklore” has  served in constructing sociocultural images that are not grounded in, or indicated by,  the rabbinic corpus itself. The first part of the article addresses the role of “ folklore” as  yielding a variety of historiographical tropes in the writings of scholars such as  Lieberman, Urbach, Ginzberg, and Fraenkel, as well as in the writings of specific  folklore scholars such as Hasan-Rokem and Yassif. “Folklore,” as an essential  category, when applied to rabbinic texts, designates ideological, institutional or  social margins, and in turn, it implies an imagined canon. As the article argues, the  identification of “ folklore” with marginality cannot be sustained by the texts  themselves. The article therefore suggests implementing folkloristic tools in reading  rabbinic texts without the underlying essentialistic understanding of the texts  themselves as reflecting rabbinic “ folklore.” The second part of the essay applies the  nonessentialized use of folklore methodology to two close readings of rabbinic texts.  The cultural, political, and historical implications of the term folklore, or rather of its various uses, have been at the center of many disciplinary debates over the last two decades.1 Informed by the self-reflective  discourse of folkloristics, this paper offers a close look at the use of the term as a  narratological device by scholars of rabbinic Judaism.

The nature of  rabbinic texts, the scarcity of relevant external material (its relevancy in and of  itself a matter of opinion) as well as scholarly paradigms, have led to different,  often diametrically opposed, pictures of ancient Jewish culture(s). With that, it is  not only what is being told that is worth noting but also its how. Here, I wish to  draw attention to the cunning role of “folklore” in the telling and retelling of  rabbinic history. The first part of the article will discuss the use of folklore by  scholars of rabbinic Judaism, pointing at the implicit and explicit underlying  assumptions encapsulated in their very use of the term and at their corresponding  historiographies. I argue that all uses of “folklore” by scholars as designating “real  essence” cannot be sustained and should thus be viewed as an interpretative para- digm rather than reflecting an objective cultural phenomenon. In the second part  of the essay I suggest an alternative approach that circumvents possible pitfalls of  existing uses of “folklore,” applying it in two close textual readings. H I S T o r I o G r A P H y ,  F o L k L o r E  A N D  T H E  r E P r E S E N T A T I o N   o F  M A r G I N S Historiography, in this case rabbinic historiography, is inevitably comprised of  conventional tropes without which, as Hayden White has taught us, it cannot  deliver a meaningful account. It is in this context of conventional, but by no  means insignificant, tropes, that the concept—or trope—of “folklore” deserves  attention: “folklore,” I suggest, has furnished historiographic interpretations of  rabbinic texts, in the choice of “plot structure” as well as in the implied “paradigm  of explanation” that these historiographies employ.2 That is, “folklore” has served  as an interpretative lens through which scholars have sought to explain rabbinic  culture, consequently producing a range of cultural “plot structures.” However,  and this will be the focus of this article, the interpretative lens that employs  “folklore” is not transparent since the use of the term itself is heavily saturated  with underlying assumptions. The field of folklore studies has been well aware of the inherent problematics  of its designated subject matter. Like other disciplines, it has been digging deeply  Spring 2009 </page> <page sequence="3"> 208 y    Dina Stein into the archaeology of its own knowledge, and much has been said in recent  discussions about the ideological components that have resided in the unfolding  notions of “folklore” and in its various studies.3 In this context, the double bind of  simultaneous demarginalizing and remarginalizing of “folkloristic” phenomena  has also been addressed: when a cultural expression is designated as “folklore” it  is retrieved from the social/cultural margins and yet, ironically, by the token of  the very same designation, it is restored (safely?) to the margins, once again.4 Applying the theoretical reflexivity of folklore studies to rabbinic studies, I  am suggesting that by selecting specific texts from the rabbinic era and labeling  them as “folklore,” scholars have marginalized them. The margins to which they  have been relegated are at times concretely social ones, in which case the “folklor- istic” notions that are reflected in the texts are associated with low, weak or  nonhegemonic groups (or at least thought to originate with them). At times,  however, “folklore” is not attributed to marginal segments of society but rather is  seen to reflect noncanonical cultural ideas. In both instances, the designation of  “folklore,” implying an opposition to that which is “not-folklore,” has served to  construct a cultural hierarchical map.5 As I will argue, the act of marginalization  has been committed not only by scholars who view folklore as an inferior cultural  product. Folklorists, who favor folklore, have also contributed in enhancing some  of the assumptions held by the non- (or: anti-) folklorists. Although in this essay  I do not presume to present an exhaustive survey of rabbinic scholarship of folk- lore, I do hope to point at what seems to me to have been characteristic tendencies  in the use of the term.6 The following discussion thus focuses on the use of the term folklore by  modern scholars who read ancient rabbinic texts. Whether the rabbis, or alterna- tively, the texts themselves, manifest the category of folklore is an important issue  both for exploring the ways in which the rabbis imagined their social profile and  for assessing the overlap between the designation offered by the texts themselves  and modern scholarship. However, these social–religious markers (e.g., am ha- aretz) do not yield any coherent corpus that can subsequently be identified as folk  narrative, belief, and so on. Similarly, except for one instance—the introduction  of proverbs in the Babylonian Talmud deamri inshe (“as people say”)—there is no  specific genre that the rabbis themselves designate as a folk genre.7 Consequently,  PROOFTEXTS 29: 2 </page> <page sequence="4"> Let the “People” Go?    y  209 modern scholarship has relied on extratextual criteria for its designation of folk- lore in rabbinic literature.  Trope 1 :  Marg ina l i z ing The Undes ir abl e  in  r abb in ic  cUlT Ure Saul Lieberman (1898–1983), undoubtedly one of the most important and influen- tial scholars of rabbinic literature, once commented regarding a certain text he  published that “it would be of more interest for the folklorist than for the student of  Talmud and Midrash.”8 I will take a closer look at this specific text in the  concluding part of the paper and will suggest possible underlying notions that may  have guided Lieberman’s emphatic comment. But before addressing the story in  more detail, it is important to see the ways in which scholars of midrash—first and  foremost Lieberman himself—regarded the “folk” and their role in the rabbinic era. Lieberman assumes a basic dichotomy between the elite—the rabbis—and the  folk. While not denying the actual wide distribution of folklore in rabbinic  everyday reality, he describes folk ideas as originating with the masses (“the folk”),9  with which the rabbis had to, albeit reluctantly, come to terms. An example of  such an understanding of the dissemination of folk beliefs is Lieberman’s account  of incantations, oaths, and vows, which are found in rabbinic literature. Lieberman  commends the rabbis “who faced the situation admirably.”10 The situation the  rabbis were faced with was one in which, according to Lieberman,  The ignorant people of the country . . . whose economic status made it  impossible for them to emulate the middle class in the pursuit of pleasures  and elegance, adopted their neighbors’ belief in magic, astrology and all  kinds of superstition in defiance of Written and Oral Laws.11 The rabbis, according to Lieberman, did their best to fight these foreign influences  and “[o]n the other hand, they tried to legalize strange customs which could be  tolerated without endangering the vital principles of Judaism. But their funda- mental work was that of Judaizing the foreign elements.”12 These folk beliefs were  supposedly transposed by the rabbis and incorporated into monotheistic prayers.13  Similarly, Ephraim Elimelech Urbach (1912–91) describes the dissemination of  Spring 2009 </page> <page sequence="5"> 210 y    Dina Stein folk beliefs in, and the practice of, sorcery as originating among women and  simple folk but eventually spreading amongst the sages. And he goes on to say: In actuality, even the Sages of the Talmud and Midrash—despite their  fundamental recognition that there is none besides God and that  consequently witchcraft does not exist—could not ignore the facts, to  wit, that broad masses of people believed in and made use of these  practices. . . .They sought to find a compromise.14  Both Lieberman’s and Urbach’s descriptions imply that the assumed pure form  of monotheism—Judaism—was devoid of magical elements.15 The existence in  rabbinic literature of incantational narratives, for example, is explained by a scenario  of a sociocultural conflict in which “folk” beliefs—with which the incantations are  identified—could no longer be ignored. In this last example, the reconstruction of  the social reality of the Jews in late antiquity does not marginalize “folklore” by ulti- mately attributing it to marginal segments of society (although it is assumed to have  originated there). Rather, the use of the term folkloristic, as a means to narrate rabbinic  history, serves to designate noncanonical ideas and hence to paint a picture of what  Judaism, an abstract entity and not a lived form of life, was, or was meant to be.16 Indeed, “magic” has often been identified with “folklore,” rendering both  terms members of the same semantic-associative field. However, there seems to  be a crucial difference between them: rabbinic magic is granted a host of meta- titles, that is, terms found in rabbinic literature which supposedly designate  phenomena that—even from an comparative point of view—can be labeled  “magic” (e.g., kishuf ). Not only that, but a variety of external material, such as  magical bowls, amulets, and recipes, which exist outside the Talmuds and  midrashim, allow for a historical reconstruction of magic as a distinct domain of  ideas and practices in rabbinic culture.17 This is not the case with folklore, which is  not labeled as such in rabbinic literature, nor does it appear as a distinct discipline  in extracanonical corpora.18 The association of “magic” with the “folk” has no  textual basis: whereas it could be argued that rabbinic magic carries distinctive  features, the identity of the rabbinic “folk” remains obscure.

However, even a view of history as regressive,  rather than progressive, has posited “folklore” in a similar position, whereby it is,  by definition, something “out of step with its time and surroundings”:19 in the  “devolutionary” scheme,20 folklore has—since the days of Herder and the brothers  Grimm—symbolized the vital forces of the authentic folk,21 still uncorrupted by  modernity and its institutions. Overtones of the romantic notions of folklore can be discerned in Lieber- man’s picture of Jewish society in late antiquity, in which the folk and their lore  leave their mark on progressive (at least chronologically) rabbinic institutions.  Lieberman, at best, may have viewed the cultural processes that he invoked  neutrally. However, in the works of other scholars these assumed cultural  dynamics were stated within a clear evaluative framework, both by those who  lamented the impact of “folklore” (e.g., Urbach) and by those who marveled at it  (e.g., J. Lauterbach).22 The latter case is best exemplified in Louis Ginzberg’s  words. In his paper, titled “Jewish Folklore—East and West,” delivered at the  Tercentenary of Harvard University in 1936, the author of the seminal Legends of  the Jews said as follows: Are these hundreds—yea, thousands—of legends found in the  Talmudim and Midrashim concerning Biblical personages and events  nothing but extravagances of an unbridled scholastic mind? or are they  genuine creations of popular fancy which the school appropriated—mostly  in modified form—for its use of instruction and edification? To predi- cate this antithesis, as has been done by many, is in my opinion falla- cious, for most frequently scholastic ingenuity and popular fancy both  contributed toward the production of these legends.23  The right blend of scholastic–academic principles with the creative energy of  the folk stands at the base of the utopian picture which Ginzberg draws of rabbinic  literature. It is utopian not only because it sees midrash, a salient cultural product  Spring 2009 </page> <page sequence="7"> 212 y    Dina Stein of the rabbinic era, as the perfect combination of rational reason and (emotional?)  imagination;24 it is utopian since it implies a social system in which the academy  and the “people” are brought together in full harmony.25  Although the tone of Ginzberg’s description is very different from that of  Urbach’s, who recognizes folkloristic elements in rabbinic writings but sees them as  the outcome of a lost battle, it is nonetheless similar in its fundamental assump- tions: a basic dichotomy is assumed, comprised of the rabbinic elite on the one  hand, and of the folk on the other. This assumption in itself may even correspond  to a historical reality of the Jewish society in late antiquity. However, what seems  questionable, indeed problematic, is the role assigned to folklore in this context. For  Ginzberg, “folklore” is the raw material of “popular fancy” with which “the inge- nious exegete . . . made free use.”26 For Ginzberg, unlike for Lieberman or Urbach,  folklore is not a contaminating commodity imported from alien cultures. Quite the  opposite: it is the heart and soul of the Jewish culture.27 Thus, although Ginzberg  draws attention to many parallels between motifs found in Jewish legends and ones  that appear in other countries and cultures (Indian, Persian, Babylonian, Greek;  Early Christianity and Islam) he unequivocally states that “[t]he burden of proof is  on him who claims foreign origin for any of the legends contained in this litera- ture.”28 This puzzling statement can be best understood within the framework of  the romantic–nationalistic (favoring) notion of folklore as the quintessential expres- sion of the people’s voice, “produced on Jewish soil, either in Palestine, which for  many centuries continued to be Jewish even after it became politically part of the  Roman empire or in Babylonia, where for centuries the Jews lived in great numbers  a life of their own.”29 Within this framework, “folklore” is a vital component (subor- dinated to the “scholastic ingenuity” of the rabbis, to be sure) in what is imagined to  be a pure cultural identity of the rabbinic era. These few examples draw a clear trajectory. Whether condemned or admired,  “folklore” is used to designate cultural phenomena that are assumed to originate  in the social margins of the culture, or beyond its imagined boundaries. Viewed  as an internal phenomenon, “folklore” is identified with the raw, vital, imagina- tion of the “folk” that is harnessed by the rabbis. It assumes internal social bound- aries and a division of labor between the folk and the elite; as an external  phenomenon, “folklore” essentially belongs to another (not purely Jewish) culture.  PROOFTEXTS 29: 2 </page> <page sequence="8"> Let the “People” Go?    y  213 By naming certain beliefs (e.g., magical, mythological), practices (e.g., incanta- tions), or literary-discursive genres as “folklore,” at least in their origin, they are  inevitably contrasted with that which is not “folklore”: social institutions or ideas  that are assumed to have originally been at the center. It is here that the very act of  labeling cultural phenomena as “folklore” conceals the premises on which it relies.  “Folklore,” imbued with the romantic understanding of the term, is used to support  a preconceived image of rabbinic culture. “Folklore” does not reflect social and  ideological boundaries; it produces them.  For Lieberman and Urbach, “folklore” is the solution disguised as the problem:  “folklore” does not only mark what were to them problematic cultural phenomena.  Once these phenomena are designated as “folklore,” an ideal rabbinic culture is  reconstructed and sustained. In their clear-cut picture of the rabbis on the one hand,  and the folk on the other, it is the folk who carry the initial blame for beliefs and  practices that do not comply with what they perceive as the pure notion of mono- theistic Judaism. The folk are the agents through which supposedly foreign ideas  invade a coherent—though unsuited for the masses—rabbinic culture. For Ginz- berg, too, “folklore” is a redeeming term, albeit for different reasons: starting off  from similar assumptions regarding a social dichotomy between the rabbis and the  “folk,” “folklore,” originating with the “folk,” is for him a vital component without  which the scholastic enterprise of the rabbis would be lacking authentic substance.  For Ginzberg, “folklore” plays an important role in a utopian social–cultural recon- struction. For Lieberman and Urbach, “folklore,” paradoxically, alleviates the  painful recognition that—to their minds—it was not an ideal culture.30 These three towering figures in Jewish Studies operated within cultural, reli- gious, and institutional frameworks that may provide some clues as to their use of  “folklore” in their historiographic narratives. Lieberman and Urbach clearly  engaged in very different aspects of rabbinic texts: Lieberman continued Epstein’s  philological inquiries and provided textual commentaries as well as pioneering  studies on the Hellenistic contexts of the rabbis in Palestine; Urbach’s studies  encompass multifaceted works on rabbinic (as well as earlier and later groups’)  worldviews and practices. Not only that, but Lieberman also became affiliated  with the Conservative Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, serving as  rector, whereas Urbach, a member of the Talmud department at the Hebrew  Spring 2009 </page> <page sequence="9"> 214 y    Dina Stein University in Jerusalem, was a prominent figure at the institute of Jewish studies  there which he, too, headed. Clearly, the modern-Orthodox-academic-Zionist  milieu in which Urbach not only operated but which he also helped fashion stood  miles away from Lieberman’s struggle-ridden context where his identity as  Orthodox-Conservative Jew was being tested.31 Yet, both scholars seem to have  shared an inherited disdain (dating back to the days of the Wissenschaft des  Judentums)32 to what they perceived as irrational elements in rabbinic Judaism.  Lieberman is oft quoted as having introduced a lecture on Jewish mysticism by  Gershom Scholem at JTS by saying that nonsense is nonsense but the history of  nonsense is science. This attribution seems to capture the apprehensive position he  held (as a practicing Jew and scholar, and owing to the Litvak yeshiva tradition)  regarding this body of irrational wisdom. When it came to his area of study— rabbinic texts—irrational elements (e.g., magic) were accordingly labeled  “folklore.”  Urbach attempted to provide an objective picture of rabbinic worldviews in  his ambitious and groundbreaking The Sages: Their Concepts and Beliefs.33 In the  context of this discussion, it is worth noting Yaacov Sussmann’s observation: To some extent Urbach too painted the world of HAZAL and the  image of rabbinic-Talmudist Judaism and the profile of its leaders as too  idyllic. He often described them in his own image, in which paradoxes  could reside in utter peace, under the guise of rationalism. . . . In general,  anything that smelled of mysticism was pushed aside, to later periods  and to marginal groups.34 It is within his broader—projected—image of rabbinic culture that Urbach uses  folklore to designate irrational beliefs and practices. Although Ginzberg shared Lieberman’s institutional affiliation (JTS) as well  as a keen philological engagement with texts, the contours of his academic and reli- gious identity were quite different. Ginzberg’s identification with the Conservative  movement and his public role in it seem to have been less complicated than his  colleague’s (stemming no doubt also from their different backgrounds and biogra- phies prior to their arrival at JTS).35 His role as an academic “elitist”—albeit in a  PROOFTEXTS 29: 2 </page> <page sequence="10"> Let the “People” Go?    y  215 seminary that ordains rabbis and hence does not view itself as an “ivory tower” to  begin with—and his role in American religious circles comprised two simultaneous  facets of his persona. As we saw, Ginzberg grants dual—and equally important— axes to the rabbinic enterprise, the scholastic and the imaginative (with which folk- lore is identified). His belief that the Jews are (and were) like all other nations was  undoubtedly influenced by a romantic-nationalistic vision. Jewish culture is,  according to Ginzberg, like other cultures-nations and ought to seek its folk- national roots in its ancient sources.36 The duality with which he characterizes the  rabbis echoes his own academic profile, which includes halakhic and philological  issues as well as studies in Jewish “lore.” In fact, it seems that his Legends of the Jews  epitomizes this duality: the text itself reads as a successive narrative, akin to myths,  epics, or legends of other nations, and as such it is analogous to folk–literary  creations of the romantic–nationalistic schools beginning with the Brothers  Grimm, the Kalevala, or the Ring of Nibelungs. However, the references to sources  that served Ginzberg in writing his own Midrash and the erudite discussions in the  footnotes comprise the other (and for the study of rabbinics far more important)  layer of his work. The Legends of the Jews, like its author and like his imagined  rabbinic culture, is of dual nature—the imaginative (folklore) and the scholastic.  T r o p e  3 :  r e c o v e r i n g  T h e  M a r g i n s The use of folklore as a term that is self-explanatory has been prevalent among  scholars who are not folklorists by their academic training or position. It is not  surprising that the term is used unreflectively by scholars such as Lieberman,  Urbach, and even by Ginzberg (who was undoubtedly influenced by the under- lying notion of the “folk” in the publication of other epic and legendary compila- tions of his time).37 This is obviously not the case with folklorists who use the  term as an explicit interpretative concept in their reading of rabbinic texts. Dov  Noy, the founding father of folklore studies as a recognized field in Israeli  academia and who was the teacher of most of the leading folklorists in Israel  today, relates folklore to “the passing down of tradition from one generation to  the next” and sees it as “expressing a wish fulfillment fantasy of the people.”38 It is  not hard to detect the romantic legacy in his and in some of his students’ studies,  Spring 2009 </page> <page sequence="11"> 216 y    Dina Stein a legacy that places their reconstruction of Jewish culture in late antiquity in close  proximity to that which is found in the writings of the nonfolklorists. In Noy’s  case, this definition encompasses material found throughout Jewish history, from  the Bible to contemporary oral tales recorded in Israel, thus delineating a contin- uous and teleological trajectory beginning and ending in the Land of Israel.39 While previous studies of “folklore” in rabbinic texts relied heavily on the  assumptions and methods of the historical-geographical school of folkloristics,40  more recent scholarship reflects the changes that have swept through the field of  “folklore” and that have affected the understanding of its subject matter, namely:  (1) the understanding of the “folk” as “any group of people whatsoever who share  at least one common factor”;41 (2) seeing “folklore” as a product of any group, by  which the group seeks to define—or establish—its identity;42 (3) the idea that a  person is associated with a few “folk” groups simultaneously, such as family,  work43—and one may add: gender; (4) the emphasis on a performance-oriented  approach that defines “folklore” as an artistic communicative process in small  groups.44 These notions, which have been underlying much of the work done in  the field of folkloristics in the United States since the 1960s, have not gone unno- ticed by folklorists reading rabbinic texts. In this context I will refer to two major studies: Eli Yassif ’s discussion of  “folklore” in the rabbinic era in his The Hebrew Folktale: History, Genre, Meaning,45  and Galit Hasan-Rokem’s book, Web of Life: Folklore in Midrash in Rabbinic Liter- ature.46 Yassif ’s panoramic study and Hasan-Rokem’s monographic analysis are  important works on “folklore” in the rabbinic era. The shift they mark in the  study of “folklore” in rabbinic texts, and the innovative insights they offer of  these texts, make their implied reconstruction of rabbinic culture all the more  significant. It should be noted that while these two studies address written texts,  Yassif, and to a larger extent Hasan-Rokem, engage elsewhere in contemporary  oral traditions. Their treatment of ancient textual material and their definition of  folklore in that corpus are thus inevitably informed by what they perceive as the  phenomenology of folklore in a wider perspective.  Yassif presents a widely accepted definition of “folklore,” or rather the “folktale,”  as a narrative that exists in multiple versions.47 The “multiple existence” is for Yassif  both “an operative and an essential” criterion48 by which one can discern—with  PROOFTEXTS 29: 2 </page> <page sequence="12"> Let the “People” Go?    y  217 certainty—specific texts, and designate them as “folk narratives,” within a vast tradi- tion of texts. Furthermore, this operative definition is described as stemming from  the essence of the folkloristic process in general, which is characterized by ongoing  re-creation. Similarly, Hasan-Rokem states that “The most crucial and specific  feature of folk literature is . . . its constant re-creation in changing contexts.”49  In both Yassif ’s and Hasan-Rokem’s explicit definitions of the term folklore  (or: folk-narrative) there is no trace of the dichotomies that stood at the base of  earlier scholarship: “folklore” is not restricted a priori to the “folk,” as opposed to  the “rabbis”; nor are the ideas reflected in “folklore” contrasted with those of the  “elite’s” set of ideas. It is thus surprising to find in these studies relapses to the  more restrictive notions of “folklore.” Thus, although Yassif does not define folk- lore in oppositional terms—in fact, in the preface to the chapter on the rabbinic  era he reiterates his anti-oppositional approach50—the underlying dichotomy  reemerges in his later comments. In his discussion of demonological tales, for  example, he notes that the idea of the Torah as the ultimate protector against  demons is expressed in narratives that are probably produced by the rabbis of the  academy. In these tales, he claims, the religious establishment employs basic social  fears (death, the demonic world, hunger, diseases) in order to impose its views on  the masses.51 Allusions to “folk” as opposed to the learned and to “folklore” as the  product of marginal groups are made on several other occasions as well.52 Hasan-Rokem, in the introduction to her sophisticated reading of the fifth- century midrash Lamentations Rabbah, suggests that the folkloristic perspective will highlight every-day life as a cultural category rather than as the  background or the setting for more important, “historical” events. Light  will thus be shed on groups that have so far been in the shadow of the  sages—the scholars of the academy, the spokesmen, and social leaders;  this approach to the study of folk literature leads us to women, children,  uneducated people and strangers of all kinds, and conveys their contri- bution to the polysystemic character of rabbinic culture.”53  With this assertion, the affiliation of “folklore” with social margins is rein- stated; the historical picture that Hasan-Rokem invokes is not Ginzberg’s utopian  Spring 2009 </page> <page sequence="13"> 218 y    Dina Stein image, nor is it Lieberman’s or Urbach’s vision of the inherent—partly lost—battle  between the sages and the people. Throughout the book, Hasan-Rokem sees the  various social institutions and groups (the academy, the family, men, women, “us,”  “foreigners”) as negotiating—almost equal—parties; Hasan-Rokem sees midrash as  a literary production of the learned elite, originating either in bet-hamidrash (the  academy)54 or in the synagogue.55 Yet the imagined cultural reality is one in which the  different institutions, and the people who inhabit them, are not detached from one  another, and it is one in which their discursive activities cross the fluid boundaries  that define them. Furthermore, Hasan-Rokem suggests that the collective character  of rabbinic literature (in its entirety)—in which it resembles “folklore”—allows us to  discern the real voices in its discourse. That is, traces of negotiations that took place  between the establishment and “other” social segments are recorded in the texts.56  Folklore manifests itself in narrative-genres (e.g., riddles)57 in a social practice  (e.g., interpretation of dreams),58 and in a specifically feminine practice (e.g.,  lamenting).59 In all these cases, “folklore” is understood as a subversive, anti-hege- monic, phenomenon. Within this framework “folklore,” which is attributed to  marginal social groups, is seen to be directly represented in rabbinic literature: real  women, simple folk, and strangers are present in the hegemonic discourse; it is their  authentic voices that we can actually hear—if we are attentive enough—in what is  presumed to be a Bakhtinian-dialogic text. Yet, much as one might wish for a more egalitarian past, it is doubtful  whether we can accept, at face value, the representation of “other” voices in a  literary product of the hegemonic elite. As Elizabeth Clark has noted, regarding  the impossibility of reconstructing an improved historical place of women in early  Christianity, “the leap from ‘representation’ to the extratextual world crosses a  wide and ugly ditch.”60 As Hasan-Rokem herself acknowledges, it is within “the  poly-system of rabbinic culture” that “women, children, uneducated people, and  strangers of all kinds” are expressed.61 Thus, while folkloristics has provided us  with a long legacy (heavily saturated with romantic ideas) of tuning in to the  subversive, the “other” and the “underdog,” these “voices” cannot be directly  attributed to historically separate marginal groups. On the contrary, subversive  ideas may as well have resided in the rabbinical establishment itself. So viewed,  the marginal groups to which these “folk” ideas are attributed (strangers, women,  PROOFTEXTS 29: 2 </page> <page sequence="14"> Let the “People” Go?    y  219 etc.) are semiotic objects—the criteria for their selection important in itself—on  which the rabbis project their own thoughts and desires, including their subversive  ones.62 Put differently, the rabbis are the implied authors of midrash; hence, any  social group represented in their texts (including groups of rabbis) ought to be  considered in relation to the rabbis’ authorial position and should not be confused  with social groups per se.63 Moreover, even a modified view that may attribute  subversive elements to a possible rabbinic establishment cannot avoid a reification  of the “normative” in relation to which such elements are measured.  Hasan-Rokem sees rabbinic culture as a poly-system, and she understands  the hegemonic discourse (of the rabbis) to be, ipso facto, comprised of ongoing  negotiating processes with “other” discourses. In her reconstruction of rabbinic  culture, folklore is the locus in which such negotiations, between the folk and the  rabbis, can be found. Folklore is, hence, a locus for subversive ideas. “Folklore,”  attributed ultimately to marginal social groups, here, too, serves as an emanci- pating term, which deconstructs what might otherwise be mistaken for an all too  coherently monophonic culture. Her use of “folklore” implies certain assumptions  concerning rabbinic society and culture, as well as assumptions regarding the  representation of the historical reality in midrash. Thus, her reading implies the  existence of an underlying dichotomy between the folk (and their lore) and the  rabbis. That is, although a “rabbi” could be both a “rabbi” and belong to the  “folk,” there still exists an underlying distinction between what comprises his  “rabbinic” as opposed to “folkloristic” persona; her historical reconstruction also  implies that marginal groups—to which “folklore” is attributed—that are repre- sented in midrash correspond directly to extratextual social groups. Hasan-Rokem’s and Yassif’s works were heavily criticized. What could be  gleaned from Jonah Fraenkel’s studies in general is made quite explicit in his  programmatic article, triggered by Hasan-Rokem’s and Yassif’s studies, “Sippur  ha-aggadah le’umat ha-sippur ha-amami” (The Aggadic Narrative vs. the Folk- tale).64 Arguing against these folklorists’ work, he points out that orality and folk- motifs cannot qualify as markers of “folklore” in rabbinic literature since the former  is the underlying mode of the entire rabbinic corpus (i.e., “oral Torah”) and the latter  can be found in the great canonical—and hence not folkloristic—works of the world.  While his argument on these points may be valid, it implies an inherent circularity  Spring 2009 </page> <page sequence="15"> 220 y    Dina Stein that becomes manifest when he discards certain kinds of knowledge (e.g., under- standing animal language) and literary genre-styles (e.g., riddling tales) as “non- rabbinic,” hence, “folklore.” And, since according to him rabbinic literature, at its  best, is not “folklore,” he posits two options: he either points at the utter “rabbiniza- tion” (“de-folklorization”) of folk-motifs or genres,65 or else, argues for the belated- ness of the text which attests to its temporal externality. The circularity of Fraenkel’s argument resides in the assumed relationship  between a given text and a posited textual framework. It results, as is the case of  the motif of “animal language,” in the following conclusion that It is clear that knowing animal language is a “secular” science of sorts. It  is not connected to either the knowledge of Torah or the fulfillment of  mitzvot and therefore it is clear that Sages do not engage in it.66 Hence, according to Fraenkel, in order for a narrative to belong to the normative  rabbinic corpus, it has to comply with an assumed body of canonical ideas. Yet,  one may indeed ask if “knowledge of Torah or the fulfillment of mitzvot” encom- pass the complexity and richness of rabbinic culture(s). Or, for that matter, if the  riddling-tales in Lamentations Rabbah should be considered external to canonical  rabbinic literature. Fraenkel’s assertion may, in fact, tell us more about the scholar  who projects his own idealized picture of normative rabbinic Judaism. But what is  of particular importance here is that we find “folklore,” once again, as a narrato- logical device that designates both imagined social and ideological margins and a  normative center with which it is contrasted. Not surprisingly, Fraenkel’s literary  cartography echoes Lieberman’s and Urbach’s legacy; as such, its use of “folklore”  as (an implicit) historiographical trope functions to marginalize the undesirable.  For Yassif, and especially for Hasan-Rokem, it is precisely the margins that are  desirable. Yet, the actual use of “folklore” for demarcating cultural hierarchies  and boundaries characterizes their work no less than it serves Fraenkel. In both  cases, it remains far from clear how, and if, it indeed reflects cultural processes  that underlie rabbinic texts and to which we have very limited access. The association of folklore and marginality should also be understood in light  of the institutional-academic and larger intellectual context of these scholars.  PROOFTEXTS 29: 2 </page> <page sequence="16"> Let the “People” Go?    y  221 Fraenkel’s vehement critique of Yassif and Hasan-Rokem could very well relay his  own fear regarding the still liminal and precarious position his field (which he to a  large extent established), literary studies of rabbinic texts, occupies in relation to the  core historical–philological study of the rabbinic corpus. His response exposes not  only his, or his field’s, own vulnerabilities, but also the underlying volatile contours  of disciplinary distinctions in Jewish Studies (at least in Israeli academia) and ques- tions of academic and cultural identity which they involve.67 Hence, the framework  of an academic hierarchy, which is not divorced from cultural-religious claims and  qualms—such as Talmudic studies and its relation to traditional learning in the  yeshivot—might explain Fraenkel’s response.68 Unlike Lieberman’s, Urbach’s, and  Ginzberg’s works, Hasan-Rokem’s and Yassif’s works on rabbinic texts were from an  institutional point of view marginal to begin with, since they were not carried out in  the Talmud department; nor did they emphasize the halakhic aspects of the texts.  Nor is either scholar affiliated with a religious profile: they are both “secular.” The  institutional marginality of folklore studies and the disparaging attitude of the phil- ologically–halahkically oriented Talmudists toward the field (which extended to  literary studies of rabbinic texts in general) were unquestionably oppressive. At the  same time, the imposed marginality may have been liberating since it allowed for  an openness and receptiveness to novel intellectual paradigms that could not be  recognized by the establishment. The complex position of institutional marginality  that folklore studies held within the study of rabbinic texts is reflected in the  projected notions of folklore in the works of Yassif and Hasan-Rokem, wherein the  former ultimately adheres to the notion of folklore as residing in social and cultural  margins, and the latter, while implicitly reinstating the marginality of folklore,  nonetheless argues for its subversive power. Here again, we may find that modern- day professors and ancient rabbis are conflated, as are their institutions in which  folklore is a form of marginal or subversive discourse.  c I r c u M v E N T I N G  T H E  T r o P E S ,  D E c o N S T r u c T I N G  T H E  D I c H o T o M I E S :  T H E  P r A G M A T I c S  o F  F o L k L o r E The identification of “folklore” with the margins—social, institutional, or ideo- logical—thus serves to reconstruct different images of rabbinic culture and  Spring 2009 </page> <page sequence="17"> 222 y    Dina Stein society, all of which imply certain assumptions regarding the culture and its  representation in the texts. It ultimately invokes a series of possible dichotomies  between “folklore” and “not-folklore.” Some scholars would probably not render  these dichotomies problematic, nor would they question the role of “folklore” in  the social reconstruction. However, others are involuntarily trapped by the term.  If, indeed, the dichotomies and the social/cultural maps to which they correspond  are inevitable as long as “folklore” stands for “real essence,” how can one address  the notion of folklore in rabbinic culture? The answer, as I will suggest, lies in  de-essentializing the term and by using the discipline of folklore studies for its  interpretative tools, without necessarily accepting its identification with an essen- tial subject matter. Diana Fuss, in her discussion on essence versus social constructs in feminist  and ethnic theories, presents Locke’s distinction between two kinds of essen- tialism, which may also apply to the field of folkloristics: If we can never securely displace essentialism, then it becomes useful for  analytical purposes to distinguish between kinds of essentialism, as John  Locke has done with his theory of “real” versus “nominal” essence. Real  essence connotes the Aristotelian understanding of essence as that  which is most irreducible and unchanging about a thing; nominal  essence signifies for Locke a view of essence as merely a linguistic  convenience, a classificatory fiction we need to categorize and label. Real  essences are discovered by close empirical observation; nominal essence  are not “discovered” so much assigned or produced—produced specifi- cally by language.69 Going back to the issue with which this paper began, namely viewing “folklore”  as a trope in the writing of rabbinic history, perceiving “folklore” as a “real”  essence is analogous to what Hayden White described as “the conviction of the  historian that he has ‘found’ the form of his narrative in the events themselves,  rather than imposed it upon it.”70 Following Diana Fuss’s distinction, I am  suggesting implementing “folklore” as a “nominal” essence, a recognition that  may avoid the familiar—at times problematic—patterns of cultural-historical  PROOFTEXTS 29: 2 </page> <page sequence="18"> Let the “People” Go?    y  223 reconstructions:71 if the term folklore is used to designate first and foremost a disci- plinary construct, it could serve as an interpretative prism. To be sure, much of the  folkloristic paradigm understood its subject matter—“folklore”—to be a “real”  essence. Yet, it is possible to employ the disciplinary methods and tools without  necessarily accepting their ontological premise.72 T r o P E - L E S S :  A  c o M P A r A T I v E  r E A D I N G  o F  T w o  r A b b I N I c  T E x T S  Let us now take a closer look at the text I mentioned earlier and which, in Lieber- man’s words, would be of more interest to “a folklorist than for the student of  Talmud and Midrash”: There is a story of Rabbi Eleazar who was extremely good looking. And  his eyes were like two jewels. And he wished to marry the daughter of  Rabbi Yishmael and she had a coarse [big] nose [Heb.: af gasah]. What did her father do? He placed a thousand dinars in her bosom  and said to her: If he says to you “on account of the nose” [= on account of the  wrath, Heb.: mipne ha’af] give him a thousand dinars. He married her and dwelled with her. He found her nose [to be] coarse and his face fell. She said to him: what is the matter, Rabbi? He said: “for I fear the wrath” (Deuteronomy 9:19) [= for I fear the  nose; from the face of the nose. Heb: mipne ha’af] She said to him: “A gift made secretly allays wrath” (Proverbs 21:14)  [= allays nose, Heb.: matan beseter yikhpeh af] And she gave him the thousand dinars and she was his wife until  the day he died.73 The story does not seem to belong to the margins of the cultural system reflected  in the narrative, since a predominant practice of the educated establishment is the  core of the tale: the midrash of biblical verses is what endows the story with its  playful charm, and it is through the double meaning of the verses that the virtual  Spring 2009 </page> <page sequence="19"> 224 y    Dina Stein conflict between the handsome Rabbi Eleazar and his coarse-nosed bride is both  constructed and resolved. Rabbi Eleazar, frightfully intimidated and repelled by  his wife’s dominant organ, addresses her by quoting part of a verse from Deuter- onomy 19:9, “For I fear the wrath”; biblical interpretation is his home ground, and  it is from this secure point that he gently conveys his distress. The verse, in its  original context, has nothing to do with bodily parts (although the imagery may  have its roots in an anthropomorphic image of fury): af is wrath. There, af refers  to God’s anger at the Israelites who, at the sublime moment of the intimacy and  union with Him, had transgressed and built the Golden Calf. Rabbi Eleazar  invokes the verse, connoting a second meaning of the word af, meaning “nose.”  However, there is more to his “midrash” than the humorous comparison between  a nose and God’s elevated fury. In an exquisitely subtle way, his midrash, qua  midrash, does not renounce the scriptural context, and an implied analogy  between the desecrated betrothal of Israel and the Torah and his own personal  matrimonial context operates as a subtext in the story. It is indeed a moment of  intimacy and revelation between the newlywed couple, and is brought to its  successful culmination by Rabbi Eleazar’s wife: her midrash not only matches his,  in its tone and texture, but it also conveys extratextual wisdom that Rabbi Eleazar  seems to have initially been lacking. In response to his words, she quotes Proverbs  21:4: “A gift made secretly allays wrath” (which continues: “a bribe in the bosom  [will appease] rage”). Her promise of “a gift made secretly” and “a bribe in the  bosom” seems to allude not only to the thousand dinars her father had given her  (that is, if we understand them as literal, to begin with). What we see in this story is nothing short of a masterful display of midrashic  discourse, which employs textual–linguistic techniques characteristic of the rabbis  of the rabbinic era.74 It is, to be sure, playful and erotic. Similarly is the relationship  between God and Israel depicted in rabbinic literature in erotic terms: if an anthro- pomorphic model of bride/groom is employed to convey a “theological” worldview  of the relationship between God and Israel,75 it should not be surprising to find that  the theological model of God/Israel is used in the human realm, in, for example,  the relationship between husbands and wives. Rabbi Eleazar, in his midrash, in the  midst of what is clearly a very human, physically oriented, awkward moment,  alludes to the “theological” model, relating to the divine. His midrash—like his  PROOFTEXTS 29: 2 </page> <page sequence="20"> Let the “People” Go?    y  225 wife’s midrashic response—has an explicit comic effect; it is also profoundly serious.  “High theology,” sophisticated humor, midrashic wit, sexual fears, erotic playful- ness, crude allusions—and more—are all inextricably woven together in this text.  There does not seem to be anything in it that renders it—according to essentialistic  notions of the term—as particularly “folklore.” At this point, it is important to  reemphasize that even if it were a “simple,” “playful,” “erotically crude” narrative,  labeling it as “folklore” is highly questionable: it would suggest that it is marginal to  rabbinic thought and culture. That is, that “simple,” “playful,” and similar notions  are not—or should not have been—part of rabbinic Judaism. We may, indeed, ask again what in the text renders it more suitable for “a  folklorist than for the student of Talmud and midrash”? Lieberman’s essay is based  on a talk he had given on the first night of Hanukah at Shlomo Zalman’s Schock- en’s house, in what he termed a “gathering of the sages of Eretz Israel,” and as he  himself notes, it “may contain phrases that are better suited for an oral presenta- tion than to an article.”76 In other words, taking Lieberman’s comment on the text  seriously may be attributing deep meaning where none is intended. Yet, it seems  that it may be precisely the casual comment that discloses deep-rooted assump- tions and ideological bents. Admittedly, the fact that this is a late Yemenite text allows for the doubting  of its authenticity. Thus, this story may be viewed as a literary expression, which  may say more about fifteenth-century Jewish Yemenite culture than it does about  the culture in which the narrated events supposedly occurred, the Tannaitic  period.77 Yet, even if it is indeed a late text, it is nevertheless significant that  Lieberman specifically calls for a “folkloristic” reading. Lieberman comments that  the story “teaches us about the naïveté of the Yemenite compilers who considered  the tale to be a rabbinic midrash and who believed that the event actually occurred  to Rabbi Eleazar and Rabbi Yishmael.”78 Although one could hardly attribute a  naïve positivistic historical approach to Lieberman’s own readings of what he  considered rabbinic tales (i.e., from the rabbinic era), he is accusing the Yemenite  redactors of such naïveté, of accepting the narrative as a straightforward historical  portrayal of events that supposedly took place. His comment thus alludes to the  old equation between “folklore” and “falsity.”79  Since Lieberman identifies ancient traditions in the Yemenite compilation, it  Spring 2009 </page> <page sequence="21"> 226 y    Dina Stein seems that it is not so much the temporal externality of the text, in that it is situ- ated beyond the temporal boundaries of the rabbinic era, that renders it “folklore”;  following our discussion of Lieberman’s view of “folklore” in rabbinic literature,  his designation of the story as “folklore” might imply that the text is external to  rabbinic ideological boundaries, that is, that it expresses a worldview that was not,  or should not have been (and did not become—unlike the oaths and incantations),  central to rabbinic thought and culture. Might it be its erotic, some would even  argue “vulgar,” humor that renders it “folklore”? The attribution of erotic  (“vulgar”) humor to the folk, who are not the rabbis of the academy, conveys a  certain image of an ideal-type rabbi who engages in sophisticated irony, for  example, but never in “plain” playful humor.80 Yet, this text may indeed draw the attention of a folklorist, without neces- sarily identifying the story—or aspects of it—as essentially “folklore”: the hypo- thetical folklorist could point at motifs, or plot-structure, apparent in this story  that resemble ones known from different cultural contexts. The comparative  perspective need not necessarily lead to the conclusion that there were actual links  between the different narratives; it could serve as a heuristic framework that may  sharpen the understanding of a specific text.81 For example, the midrashic tale  could be read in relation to the folktale types, as classified in the Aarne-Thomson’s  index, which address the wedding night as a perilous boundary to be crossed.  Addressing the danger (and anxiety) encapsulated in the liminal stage, on the  threshold of becoming a sexual adult, there are numerous variations on the theme  of “the monster in the bridal chamber” (AT 507B).82 There, the groom has to  overcome a phallic beast in order to consummate the marriage. The “coarse nose”  of Rabbi Yishmael’s daughter could be read, in this context, as a variation of the  “monster in the bridal chamber,” although in this case both the actual threat and  overcoming it defer significantly from the tale-type abstracted in Aarne- Thompson. Not only is the groom’s anxiety represented in his wife’s nose, but the  means to conquer the fear is not projected onto an external battle of killing the  beast. Rather, the successful culmination of this particular initiation rite relies on  discourse, and one which is offered by the bride. These characteristics of the  rabbinic story, as well as the role of the biblical verses in the story, could be shown  PROOFTEXTS 29: 2 </page> <page sequence="22"> Let the “People” Go?    y  227 to be a salient feature of rabbinic “ecotypification”—a cultural adaptation of a tale  that is known in other versions.83 Aarne-Thompson’s index was a product of the geographical-historical school  of folkloristics that, true to its underlying philological paradigm, sought to  provide a tool for tracing the migration and dissemination of folk-narratives.  Implicated in this reference book is not only a suggested method for comparative  research but also an implied definition of the corpus, as suggested by its title (The  Types of the Folktale). Reading the Yemenite midrash in relation to relevant tale- types does not in any way render the story a “folktale.” Yet, tale-types that address  the wedding night as an initiation rite where the bride or groom has to overcome  an obstacle (snake, dragon, or even riddles) may draw attention to less conspic- uous aspects of the tale and to its culturally specific elements. The obstacle that  Rabbi Eleazar has to overcome is his wife’s nose, and it is she who provides him  with the tool he already has—midrashic discourse—to overcome it. Both the  culturally specific discourse and the cunning reversal of gendered roles that are at  play in the tale are made manifest by this folkloristic reading.   The story could be seen in the context of other rabbinic humoristic genres84  highlighting the woman’s ingenuity. Through a comparison to recurring themes in  other rabbinic tales, Rabbi Yishmael’s daughter’s midrash of scripture could be  perceived as an act of a trickster—a favorite folk character—who uses the hege- monic patriarchal discourse in order to survive in a discriminating system.85 Simi- larly, the role of the humoristic, or “women’s” stories, in undermining—or eventually  supporting—the normative and the hegemonic principles, can also be emphasized  in the reading of this text.86 The subversive aspects of the story, and the use of  midrash—the basic discourse of the establishment—as a tool for expressing reverse  norms, or as disclosing cracks in the establishment itself—are likely to come up in a  “folkloristic” reading of the text (but then again, in other readings too). A folklor- istic perspective need not lead to a historical reconstruction, implying that marginal  elements in the social reality, external to the text, are directly represented in it. As a discipline that emerged from two central paradigms—the literary and  the anthropological—folkloristics may have developed suitable interpretative tools  for reading the story about Rabbi Yishmael’s daughter; this does not render the  story “folklore.” It is not more, nor less, a folk-narrative than is the following well- Spring 2009 </page> <page sequence="23"> 228 y    Dina Stein known tale, which I would venture to say would not be labeled—either by “folk- lore scholars” or by “students of Talmud and Midrash”—as “folklore”: R. Hiyya b. Ashi used to prostrate himself daily and say: “May the  Merciful One save me from the evil impulse [Heb.: yetzer hara].” One day his wife heard him. She said to herself: “Why, he has  refrained from sexual contact with me for several years already. Why  does he say that?” One day as he was studying in his garden, she dressed and made  herself up and walked back and forth in front of him. He said to her: “Who are you?” She said to him: “I am Heruta, and I have just returned today  [Aram: ana heruta dehadri miyoma].” He propositioned her [Aram: tav’ah]. She said to him: “Bring me that pomegranate from the uppermost  bough.” He jumped up and retrieved it for her. When he returned home, he found his wife firing the oven. He got into it and sat down. She said to him: “What is [the meaning of] this?” He said to her: “Such and such occurred.” She said to him: “That was me!” He said to her: “But I intended to do something forbidden” (BT  Qiddushin 82b).87 This tale is somewhat of a mirror image of the Yemenite midrash. Both texts  present a woman who is wiser than her husband, and her ability to outwit or to  seduce him lies in her knowledge (e.g., of her sexual powers). In both stories the  man makes an initial mistake by reacting to superficial appearances, lacking an  ability to grasp the deeper truth which lurks underneath the surface. In both of  these texts the woman’s enigmatic words mark a crucial point in the brief plot.  And it is at this point exactly that they are also diametrically opposed to each  other: Rabbi Eleazar takes the hint; he understands his wife’s clever answer and  PROOFTEXTS 29: 2 </page> <page sequence="24"> Let the “People” Go?    y  229 therefore “she was his wife until the day he died.” In the second text, as Shlomo  Naeh has shown,88 Rabbi Hiyya does not comprehend the multifaced (or the true)  meaning of his wife’s response: he understands its plain meaning, whereby “I am  Heruta” means “I am sexually unrestrained.” The complexity of her words, which  refer simultaneously to the opposite designation of “Heruta,” as a sign of sexual  abstinence, and her use of the verb hdr (to return), evoking the notion of “trans- formation”—all these elude Rabbi Hiyya, who eagerly climbs up the tree to pick  the fruit (which is—how fitting—a pomegranate, symbolizing fertility). This  quick ascent is followed, as we immediately find out, by a tragic fall.  The story seems to lend itself to folkloristic interpretations. The Historical- Geographical school, for instance, could easily identify its “folk” elements: the  motif of the rejected wife who disguises herself as a whore—as she does in this  story—in order to win back her husband is a widely spread motif in “folk” narra- tives: one may consult Stith Thompson’s index and find it there (K 1814). This  text also resembles a known tale-type (AT 891), as marked in Aarne-Thompson’s  index, and its appearances in oral texts, written down and catalogued in the Israel  Folklore Archives (IFA), were discussed at length by Hasan-Rokem.89 Moreover,  as Hasan-Rokem showed in her analysis of the IFA texts, this tale-type, and  especially the motif of the disguise, deals with a central existential theme, the  inherent conflict between men and women.90 Following this line, for example, a  folkloristic reading of the story might examine its polemics against asceticism (as  Naeh convincingly argues) in relation to the cross-cultural theme that is abstracted  in the tale-type: the story could be viewed as a specific Talmudic oicotype, in  which the tension between men and women, and the unresolved power struggle  between them, find their tragic expression in ascetic norms. It thus presents asceti- cism as a false and improper solution to an existential conflict. Rabbi Eleazar and the daughter of Rabbi Yishmael probably lived happily  ever after, whereas Rabbi Hiyya and his wife may have not been as lucky. Let us  suppose for a moment that the first story is “folklore,” since its happy ending  expresses a shared fantasy (hence, it is approved by the “people”),91 and that the  vague or even sad ending of the second narrative is what renders its exclusion  from the domain of the “folk.” If so, we would be implying that the canon of  rabbinic thought (albeit not necessarily the rabbis themselves) is by its nature  Spring 2009 </page> <page sequence="25"> 230 y    Dina Stein severe and maybe even tragic, whereas humor and optimism reside in the social or  ideological margins. These presuppositions—brought ad absurdum—presume a  “real” essence of “folklore.” Yet, they are, in fact, not so different, nor less arbi- trary, from the implied suppositions held by scholars such as Lieberman, Urbach,  and Ginzberg. As I have suggested throughout this paper, any use of the term as  designating “real” essence inevitably reconstructs the society to which it is applied,  mapping a cultural hierarchy in which the “folk” carry a burden, or a virtue,  depending on the eyes of the beholder. Moreover, the concept of “folklore” is  contingent upon how (and if) one compartmentalizes one’s own—not exclusively  external—world in terms of what is (or should be) “folklore,” as opposed to what is  (or should be) “not-folklore.” “Folk” and “folklore” as essential terms applied to  rabbinic texts do not reflect rabbinic culture. Rather, as narratological devices, they  produce a cultural map, designating not only the margins but also, by implication,  an imagined normative center.

Kiel, “Sefer ha’aggadah:  Creating a Classic Anthology for the People and by the People,” Prooftexts 17,   no. 2 (1997): 178–79. It should be noted that the Wissenschaft’s reluctance to  incorporate “irrational”-romantic ideas in their scholarship (one of the reasons for  their distaste for “folklore”), is mirrored by the use of the term by later scholars:  later uses are associated with the very same romantic notions of “folklore” for  which it had previously been rejected.

Shmuel Safrai, Zeev Safrai, Joshua Schwartz, and Peter J. Thomson (Assen: Van  Gorcum, 2006), 2:107–32. Harari points at Lieberman’s and Urbach’s relegation  of magic to the masses; Lieberman and Urbach thereby exempt the rabbinic elite  of ideas that do not fit their own ideal. My argument regarding the use of  “folklore” in their historiographies thus corresponds with Harari’s claims.  17 That is not to say that the historical reconstruction of rabbinic magic is devoid of its  own problems, as Bohak’s study explicitly states, both in the designation of the  field’s contours, as well in assessing the actual practicing of magic and the  identity of “magicians” in relation to the rabbis (Bohak, Ancient Jewish Magic). 18 See above, note 7. 19 Kirshenblatt-Gimblett, “Topic Drift,” 246. 20 Alan Dundes, “The Devolutionary Premise in Folklore Theory,” Journal of the  Folklore Institute 6 (1969): 5–12. 21 Bendix, In Search of Authenticity. 22 Jacob Z.

On this, see  Jonah Fraenkel, Darkhei ha-aggadah ve-hamidrash (Givataim: Yad Latalmud,  Masada, 1990), 553–57; idem, Midrash ve-aggadah (Ramat Aviv, Tel Aviv: The  Open University of Israel, 1996), 3:982–1001. See also Louis Ginzberg,  “Meqomah shel ha-halakhah be-ÿoÿmat yisrael” (a lecture delivered at the  Hebrew University in Jerusalem, 1929), where he says that “when I became aware,  I saw that in truth Rabbah bar bar Hanna’s geese are real geese . . . and if we  regard them as natural creatures of folk-imagination, there is no wonder here, it is  not surprising or amazing. Quite the opposite, it would be more surprising if we  didn’t have such legends, for are we different from other nations and tongues, and  has reason overcome our imagination to the degree that the latter was entirely  diminished and ruined?” (Al halakhah ve-aggadah [Tel Aviv: Dvir], 1960, 13,  italics added, my translation).  25 See also Isaak Heinemann’s Darkhei ha-aggadah, in which he views the aggadic  midrash of the sages as an expression of their “organic” thinking. He states the  aggadah should be considered in relation to the ways in which “people who are  close to nature” interpret their legends. In fact, he claims, the agaddah of the  sages is part of a yet unwritten book titled “the ways of the universal folk- legends” (Isaak Heinemann, Darkhei ha-aggadah [Jerusalem: Magnes Press,  1950], 14). Heinemann’s romantic notion of Midrash Aggadah (he explicitly  distinguishes it from halakhah/legal discourse) does not suggest that its roots are  in the “people” as opposed to the rabbis: the rabbis are the “people.” On Heine- mann’s ahistoric, romantic, reading of Midrash, see Daniel Boyarin, Intertextu- ality and the Reading of Midrash (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1990),  1–19. For an extensive discussion on Bialik’s attitude to “folklore,” see Kiel, “Sefer  ha’aggadah”; on Berdichevsky’s view of “folklore” and Jewish identity, see Dan  Ben-Amos’s introduction to Micha Joseph Bin Gorion (Berdyczewski), Mimekor  Yisrael—Classical Jewish Folktales, trans. I. M. Lask (Bloomington: Indiana  University Press, 1976), 1:xxix–xli. It should be noted, though, that Ginzberg  himself in his preface to The Legends of the Jews states that “the school and the  home are not mutually opposed to each other in the conception of the Jews. They  study in their homes, and they live in their schools” (Louis Ginzberg, The Legends  of the Jews, trans. Henrietta Szold [Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University  Spring 2009 </page> <page sequence="29"> 234 y    Dina Stein Press, 1998 [1909], 1:XXII). Yet, this portrayal of social institutions in the  rabbinic era does not ultimately negate the basic distinction between the creative  forces underlying the rabbinic enterprise. 26 Ginzberg, “Jewish Folklore,” 62. 27 Hence the title Legends of the Jews (with an emphasis on Jews and not rabbis). 28 Ibid., 70. 29 Ibid.; italics added. 30 It should be noted that the nature of the materials to which Lieberman and Urbach  refer, and the ones to which Ginzberg relates, are different: Lieberman and  Urbach discuss (in this context) beliefs and practices of the rabbinic era, whereas  Ginzberg alludes to biblical-midrashic legends. 31 On Lieberman’s position in the Orthodox (mainly nonacademic) world, see Marc B.  Shapiro, Saul Lieberman and the Orthodox (Scranton, Pa.: University of Scranton  Press, 2006); on the nascent days of the Institute for Jewish Studies at the  Hebrew University and its relation to the Zionist enterprise, see David N. Myers,  Re-Inventing the Jewish Past: European Intellectuals and the Zionist Return to  History (New York: Oxford University Press, 1995). 32 See note 6 above. 33 Urbach argued against earlier as well as contemporary studies that he views as guided  by apologetic impulses.

The substitution of “folklore” with  “ethnography” indeed allows for a more flexible, less charged delineation of a  reconstructed rabbinic culture underlying the texts. Yet the concept of “ethnog- raphy” deserves discussion, beyond the scope of this article. See Galit Hasan- Rokem, Tales of the Neighborhood: Jewish Narrative Dialogue in Late Antiquity  (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003).  57 Hasan-Rokem, Web of Life, 39–87. 58 Ibid., 88–107. 59 Ibid., 108–29. 60 Elizabeth E. Clark, “Holy Women, Holy Words: Early Christian Women, Social  History, and the Linguistic Turn,” Journal of Early Christian Studies 6, no. 3  (1998): 430. 61 Hasan-Rokem, Web of Life, 8. 62 Hasan-Rokem argues that while reading women in rabbinic texts as patriarchal  images is self-evident, the phenomenological affinity of midrash to “folk-narra- tive” allows for another reading, namely one that recognizes the expression of  “women’s voices” in the text (Hasan-Rokem, Web of Life, 108–9). It seems to me  that the “folkloristic” aspect of midrash—a collective narrative that includes  modes of discourse with which we are acquainted from oral or written “folk- literature”—does not bridge the “ugly ditch” between the text and its historical  context. Moreover, recruiting “folklore” for the—much desired—representation  of marginal groups lends itself to the very same fallacy that characterizes “naïve”  feminist readings. But compare her reading of the “other” in midrash as refracted  representations: Galit Hasan-Rokem, “Narrative in Dialogue: A Folk Literary  Perspective on Interreligious Contacts in the Holy Land in Rabbinic Literature  of Late Antiquity,” Sharing the Sacred: Religious Contacts and Conflicts in the Holy  PROOFTEXTS 29: 2 </page> <page sequence="32"> Let the “People” Go?    y  237 Land, eds. Arieh Kofsky and Guy G. Stroumsa (Jerusalem: Yad Izhak Ben Zvi,  1998), 109–29. 63 It should be added, though, that the very association of “folklore” with the subver- sive—even if the subversion is viewed as a component of the establishment  itself—reconstructs a hierarchy of ideas, in which “folklore” marks the margins. 64 J. Fraenkel, “Sippur ha-aggadah le’umat ha-sippur ha-amami,” in Sippur ha-aggadah:  aÿdut shel tokhen ve-tzurah (Tel Aviv: Hakibutz Hameuhad, 2001), 236–60. 65 It is instructive to follow Fraenkel’s distinction between “proverbs” (i.e., a folk-genre)  and the sages’ menra. See Fraenkel, “Ha-pitgam u-merat ha-ÿokhmah  ba-agaddah,” in Midrash ve-aggadah, 2:490–93. 66 Fraenkel, “Sippur ha-aggadah,” 259 (my translation). 67 The need to dissociate himself from Yassif ’s and Hasan-Rokem’s work thus stems  precisely from the proximity of their field to his. Both Yassif and Hasan-Rokem  were trained in the department of Hebrew literature at the Hebrew University  where Fraenkel taught, although he had earned his doctorate in the Talmud  department. 68 On the differences between traditional learning of the Talmud and the study of  Talmud in the academic-scientific framework, see Menahem Kahana, “Meÿkar  ha-talmud ba-universitah ve-ha-limud hamasorti ba-yeshiva,” in Beÿevle masoret  u-tmurah: asufat ma’amarim lezikhro shel Aryeh Lang, ed. Menahem Kahana  (Rehovot: Kivunim, 1990), 113–42. Although Kahana, a professor of Talmud at  the Hebrew University, advocates academic studies, he nonetheless tries to offer a  mediating model that would bridge the gap between traditional and modern- scientific modes of learning in the yeshivot (primarily of the national-religious  circles). Although it is the yeshivot that are in need of remodeling, according to  him, his article nonetheless implies an awareness of Talmudic academic studies to  its place and function in creating and preserving traditional Jewish identities.  69 Diana Fuss, Essentially Speaking: Feminism, Nature and Difference (New York:  Routledge, 1989), 4–5. 70 White, Tropics of Discourse, 95. 71 Ben-Amos’s studies of “folklore” genres in midrash avoid the dichotomies of other  historical reconstructions. Yet, his implied conflation between (almost) the entire  extant rabbinic literary poly-system and “folklore” (or as he calls them: “tradi- tional genres”) does not seem to me, in itself, to offer new insights. However, a  “folklore”-oriented taxonomy does convey the discipline’s interest in “folklore” as  Spring 2009 </page> <page sequence="33"> 238 y    Dina Stein a socially determined, distinct, means of communication. It is from this stand- point that generic distinctions in the aggadah—whether labeled as “folklore” or  not—can potentially enhance our understanding of rabbinic texts as cultural  products (see Dan Ben-Amos, “Talmudic Tall Tales,” in Folklore Today, ed. Linda  Dégh, Henry Glassie, and Felix J. Oinas [Bloomington: University of Indiana  Press, 1976], 25–43; idem, “Generic Distinctions in the Aggadah,” in Studies in  Jewish Folklore, ed. F. Talmadge [Cambridge Mass.: The Association, 1980],  45–71). Furthermore, the existence of “folk” genres—genres that have been  characterized by folkloristics as such, and have, therefore, merited their atten- tion—in rabbinic literature enables us to draw on comparative studies of “folk”  genres. This, in turn, offers new insights into rabbinic literature, as the works of  Ben-Amos, Yassif, Hasan-Rokem, and others clearly demonstrate. On Ben- Amos’s contribution to the study of rabbinic folklore, see Dina Stein, “Mehqarav  shel Dan Ben-Amos al hasifrut ha’amamit ba-midrash: hagdarat hasugot  ha’etniyot be-heqsher ha-tarbut,” Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Folklore 19–20  (1997–1998): 25–32. Ben-Amos’s engagement in theoretical and methodological  issues that were at the core of the discipline’s radically shifting discourse in the  1970s in the United States expressed itself in his innovative approach to rabbinic  texts. He thus played an important role as mediator between structuralism and  performance-oriented studies that emerged at that time in U.S. and Israeli  folklore studies.  72 In this regard, Hasan-Rokem’s use of the term folklore in its romantic sense to  characterize Babylonian attitudes toward Palestinian “Men of Piety” (BT Ta’anit  23a–24a) provides an insightful framework for discussion. Hasan-Rokem employs  the term, explicitly reflecting on the category of “folklore” in Babylonian rabbinic  epistemology; see her “Ha-im hayu ÿazal muda’im le-musag ha-folklor?” in  Higayon l ’Yona: Hebetim hadashim be-ÿeqer sifrut ha-midrash, ha’aggadah  ve-hapiyut: qovetz meÿqarim likhvodo shel professor Yona Fraenkel bimlot lo shiv’im  ve-hamesh shana, ed.

In Fraenkel’s illuminating reading of the story of Rabbi Hiyya, he argues that the  printed versions of the story reflect the decline of the literary tradition in post- Talmudic times. According to Fraenkel, these versions, in which Rabbi Hiyya is  referred to as a “tzaddik,” and in which he does not die in the fire of the oven lit  by his wife, reflect a literary-aesthetic decline. See: Jonah Fraenkel, “Qavim  boltim betoldot masoret ha-text shel sipurei ha-agaddah,” Proceedings of the 7th  World Congress of Jewish Studies in Talmud, Halachah, and Midrash (Jeru- salem, 1981), 59–61. Although I find his aesthetic judgment convincing, it does,  to my mind, raise questions regarding the connections between aesthetics,  worldview, and the imagined rabbinic culture that produced the “original,”  “better” versions of the narrative.
