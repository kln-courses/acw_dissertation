<plain_text><page sequence="1">e x h i b i t i o n p r e v i e w MARLA C. BERNS AND POLLY NOOTER ROBERTS n September of 2006 the UCLA Fowler Museum of Cultural History opened to the public the first long-term installation dedicated to its permanent collections. Titled "Intersections: World Arts, Local Lives," this 6,300-square-foot exhibition features 250 of the finest examples of the Museum's vast holdings of African, Asian, Pacific, and Native and Latin American works of art. The selection of objects, spanning some 4,000 years to the present, was made according to their outstanding artistic quality, geographical scope, his torical breadth, and interpretive richness. This new exhibition will enhance the Fowler Museum as a national destination for viewing and learning about global arts and cultures. "Intersections" represents a significant step in the Fowler's forty-four year history and an opportunity to strengthen accessi bility to its renowned permanent collections. The gallery is de signed to be on view for ten or more years, but has significant elements of change built into its conception, ensuring dynamism and relevance over time. It incorporates a thematic and cross-cul tural (as opposed to a geographical) approach to exhibiting and thinking about world arts, while simultaneously increasing the visibility of the collections. The new space showcases highly important, yet seldom seen works of art. The exhibition also pro vides new opportunities for teaching, leaming, and audience building, which depend on past accomplishments in interpretive exhibition development and on technological and scholarly ad vances in the museum field. "Intersections: World Arts, Local Lives" explores the roles art plays in creating meaning and defining purpose for people across the globe. We hope visitors take away the message that art has vital connections to people's lives and that artistry is a critical part of an object's efficacy. We want audiences to see that art is never static, that it is now and always has been in a state of creative transformation. The objects in "Intersections" convey the beauty, skill, and artistic accomplishments of diverse cultures. The exhi bition themes explore and emphasize aesthetic principles and the role of the artist, while also teaching about contexts of use and meaning. Through interpretive components, the exhibition offers glimpses into the lives and histories that informed the objects, the stories they engendered, and the performances of which they were part. The exhibition title, therefore, is twofold in meaning: Visitors will intersect with a wide range of world arts and cul tures, many of them perhaps for the first time, while at the same time learning that art traditions are constantly updated and rein vented in response to intersections-with new forms and ideas, changing circumstances, and other cultures. The Fowler Museum and the Wellcome Collection The Museum of Cultural History at UCLA was founded in 1963 to provide a home for the various collections and associated infor mation being brought back to the university by anthropologists and archaeologists doing fieldwork around the world. Chancellor Franklin Murphy, who with great foresight founded the Museum, also negotiated the gift in 1965 of 30,000 objects from the Sir Henry Wellcome Collection in England, assembled early in the twentieth century, which forms the core of our African and Pacific hold ings. Today, our art and ethnographic collections total more than 150,000 objects from traditional and contemporary African, Asian, Pacific, and Latin and Native American cultures, as well as parts of eastern Europe and the Middle East. The African collection, with mQre than 40,000 objects, is among the top twenty African collections worldwide. Other strengths include more than 24,000 Latin American and pre-Columbian objects, and more than 10,000 textiles, with particular strengths in Indonesia and the Phillipines. Additionally, we have been the official campus repository for ar chaeological items, which now number more than 600,000, most ly from California, Mexico, and the Southwest. As steward of this 1.

The size and scope of this collection has made it enormously important for research. Since our founding, the Museum has be come one of the most prolific publishers of scholarship on non Western art traditions, largely produced in association with major, _44 p thematic, nationally touring exhibitions. To date, we have pro duced 162 exhibitions and 103 publications on specific themes, cultures, or artistic genres around the world and the Fowler is rec ognized nationally for its ability to present cultural diversity and complex ideas in ways that are accessible to audiences of all back DON COLE grounds. Projects have examined the artistic excellence and vital ity of both traditional and contemporary expressive forms, and whenever possible they are informed by the contributions and voices of representative scholars, artists, and practitioners. After thirty years in the basement of a classroom building, the Museum moved in 1992 into a new state-of-the-art facility, with more than 17,000 square feet of exhibition space in three large galleries. At that time, the name was changed to the Fowler Mu seum of Cultural History based on the lead gift of the Fowler * b Z ' &gt; ID j l l family. Using strengths in the collection as springboards, the Museum continued to develop changing exhibitions on a wide range of topics and cultures, always conveying the artistic merit and creative strength of objects within their broader social and historical contexts. m While the temporary exhibition program (which wil continue in full force alongside the new long-term exhibition) has enabled us to investigate subjects in depth and with specificity, it has also _~ I ..- meant that the Museum's finest objects are not on view continu ously.

"Intersections" reflects exciting research and writing in the fields of art history, anthropology, and religion on the ways art | K t w w ~~~~~~~~~~~~works in an active sense, and how its forms and aesthetic attri butes contribute directly to these processes. Our particular work as museum professionals is to develop strategies to communicate these ideas to a cross-section of audiences using a combination of DON COLE 16 uIrlcan art: * wintar 2011</page><page sequence="4">carefully selected objects and equally carefully considered inter pretive devices. The exhibition has been designed to reveal layers of meaning. Our objectives are to show that objects in the Fowler's collections are examples of the highest aesthetic standards in their respective cultures and products of consummate artistic skill and vision, and to illustrate how these objects function in a variety of specific and culturally prescribed ways. The exhibition elaborates these ideas though four broad the matic sections. In the first, titled "Art and Action," the visitor en counters a selection of outstanding objects chosen to offer insights into intersections between artistry and capacity, and between works of art and their makers. Three subsequent sections then examine some of the principal ways these objects intersect with peoples' lives. "Art and Knowledge" allows us to explore cer tain objects' ability to impart cultural, historical, and cosmologi cal knowledge, and/or encode memory and express identity. "Art and Power" encompasses the many ways that objects bestow prestige upon their owners, negotiate gender, or act to harness and/or summon the powers of the natural and spirit worlds. Finally, "Art and Transformation" addresses the tangible ways that objects may effect change and assist with life's challenges and transitions, including the passage through death and rebirth. It is important to note that these themes are not mutually exclusive; often objects perform multiple roles. As such, we foreground the role best exemplified by the object itself through, for example, its iconography and form, and by supporting interpretive materials. The Project's History In early 2002, Fowler Director Marla C. Berns made the creation of a long-term collections-based exhibition one of the priorities for the Fowler's strategic plan, and a creative team of core staff members began convening to lay the philosophical and practical framework for the project. Led by Deputy Director and Chief Curator Polly Nooter Roberts, the team included Curator of Asian and Pacific Collections Roy Hamilton; Director of Exhibitions David Mayo; and Director of Education Betsy Quick. During the planning phase we undertook research and evaluation, met with colleagues in the field, visited permanent collection galleries in art museums across the United States and Europe, and assembled advisory committees of local teachers, UCLA faculty, community leaders, and Museum members. Throughout the twentieth century, the arts of world cultures have been displayed in permanent galleries of American muse ums in varying ways. Each approach has reflected the biases and prevailing attitudes of the time or the paradigms typically used by particular kinds of museums. In recent years, a number of natur al history, anthropology, and art museums have been rethinking and reinstalling their permanent galleries of world arts. During the spring and summer of 2003 the Fowler project team visited the Denver Art Museum, the Heard Museum, the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, The Walker Art Center, the Victoria and Albert Museum, The British Museum, the Louvre, the Musee du Quai Branly (which was still in planning stages), and the Musee Guimet, among others. These visits helped us explore such tangi ble elements as design formats, casework, lighting, and didactics, as well as conceptual issues such as thematic versus geographic organization, paradigms for cross-cultural exploration, and the use of first voices. As we began to identify our objectives, it was clear that the ex hibition would have to feature art from all the key global areas Fowler collections encompass. We wanted to highlight our best and most important objects, whether their virtue lay in age and provenance or aesthetic quality and rarity. But we wanted neither wlntur 2001 * atricmn art:</page><page sequence="5">? .. .. .. .

Collectively, we agreed that a thematic approach would offer our visitors the richest experience of our collections and one that allowed for intersections between forms and ideas. Also during 2003, in-house and consulting curators studied the thousands of objects in our storage rooms to begin identifying ob jects to be included in the exhibition. To augment existing staff expertise, Dr. Virginia Fields, Curator of Pre-Columbian Art at LACMA, was hired to assist with the selection of objects from pre Columbian, colonial, and postcolonial Mesoamerica. The team drew on the specialized expertise of former directors Christopher B. Donnan (Andean ceramics) and Doran H. Ross (Africa and Oceania) in addition to many of the project's other consultants and subject experts. Exhibition Strategies With major support, totaling over a million dollars, from many granting agencies and foundations (including the National En dowment for the Humanities, the National Endowment of the Arts, and the Getty, Ahmanson, Ralph M. Parsons, and W.L.S. Spencer Foundations) and private patrons, we were able to devel op and implement several key interpretive strategies and to completely refurbish our largest gallery for a custom-designed long-term installation. At the beginning of "Intersections" is a nine-minute introduc tory video, produced by Peter Kirby, followed by the four major thematic sections designed around a central changing gallery called "Fowler in Focus." The video is a critical presentational strategy and ensures that the exhibition's key concepts are intro duced in an immediate, visually stimulating format. It conveys the messages that objects have lives and that people have deep and abiding relationships with objects. It expresses these concepts through a series of vignettes featuring artists, scholars, religious practitioners, and community leaders, all of whom articulate in different but compelling ways the importance of objects in their lives. The video interweaves these accounts with remarkable video footage of performances and shrines, works of art in the exhibition, and music. Interactive video kiosks in three of the galleries also offer a menu of stories that focus on the contexts of use and meaning behind selected works of art. In "Art and Action," the video kiosk emphasizes the stories of particular artists, such as Magdalene Odundo, a contemporary African ceramist; Sisilia Sii, an Indo nesian weaver from the island of Flores; and Felix Lopez, a santos carver from New Mexico, each of whom provides an intimate understanding of the process and the passion behind the creation of particular kinds of works shown in the galleries. In "Art and Knowledge," the three case studies focus on meaning and memo ry; one study is on the universe of cultural information embedded within Moche ceramics and revealed through archaeological exca vations and art historical analysis; another on the transmission of memory and history through the painting of a clan house in Papua New Guinea; and a third on the integral role that katsina figures play in Hopi lives past and present. Finally, in "Art and Power," three videos explore case studies of power and pageantry through a personal account about life at the palace of the Bamum king in Cameroon with its profusion of art forms; an exploration of the vitality of potlatch ceremonies of the Pacific Northwest as articu lated by First Nations peoples who continue these traditions today; and finally, the dramatic masquerade spectacles called Barong, in Bali, Indonesia, used to maintain social equilibrium by dispelling misfortune from people's lives. Each of these stories was chosen to complement the extraordinary objects on view in the galleries. An accompanying free audio guide presents two listening op tions for visitors. A random-access version focuses on selected objects, with the voices of artists and cultural spokespersons fea tured prominently alongside those of curators and specialists.

To avoid becoming static, and also to reflect the Museum's philosophy that culture is always on the move, the Fowler has built elements of change into the exhibition's conception and for mat. Certain displays within the four main sections will be ro tated on an annual basis. For example, in the "Art and Power" gallery we open with the leadership arts of the Cameroon Grass fields, but will change this display in two years to feature Akan royal arts of Ghana-another area of strength in our collections. Textiles will be alternated on a schedule to be determined by curators in consultation with our conservators, depending on their condition and fragility.

The art works presented here are about humanity: people, ances tors, communities, and generations. In addition to a wall panel and an audio stop in the linear tour, these points are reinforced through the introductory video, shown in a screening area with comfortable seating, which visitors pass through before proceed ing to subsequent sections. Art and Action The first major gallery that the visitor enters is intended to communicate the exhibition's fundamental message: that objects in the Fowler's collections are products of exceptional artistic achievement at the same time that they play active and essential roles in peoples' lives. Through a selection of objects from around the world, texts and labeling, and a set of audio-guide stops, vis itors begin to learn about the interconnectedness of art, artistry, and action. Six visually arresting examples dominate the center of the gallery to immediately engage the viewer. Some of the objects are world renowned, while others are equally remarkable yet never before exhibited. These works show the exquisite detail ing of beadwork, the luster of textiles, and the various possi bilities in woodcarving styles and surfaces. Theirvariation will encourage visitors to question the kinds of roles and impacts these works had within broader social and historical contexts. The works include: A pair of elaborately carved early to mid-20th century Yoruba doors by the master sculptor Areogun, once a part of a royal household (Fig. 1); A contemporary Yoruba beaded crown made by Jose Rod riguez, a Cuban/Puerto Rican artist and practitioner of Yoruba religion (Fig. 4); One of a few existing eharo masks from the Elema peoples of New Guinea (late 19th-early 20th century), who customarily destroyed these objects after they were used in festivals (Fig. 5); An imposing New Caledonia feather-clad sculpture used by chiefs to embody their ancestral authority-an extremely rare work featuring a spectacular coiffure made of human hair; 26 aiPlcan art: - WIatar 2006</page><page sequence="14">Left: 20.

Visitors learn about these works through object labels that link the creative process to the ways objects are activated. For example, the label for the Kongo nkisi figure brings the visitor's attention to the many layers of items that have been added to the figure's surface over the course of its lifetime. It bristles with nails, each one pounded into its surface to bear witness to an oath sworn and a trial held. Its assertive gesture and stance serve as a code for action and power, readiness and vigilance. The label also explains that the Kongo peoples describe the power that inheres within the object as nkisi, a spiritual potentiality that can be unleashed each time the sculpture is used. Similarly, through the Yoruba crown, visitors learn about the Yoruba con cept of ashe, the authority or power that can reside in objects like this royal emblem. In the audio tour, the artist, Jose Rodriguez, talks about the making of the work and the meaning of the crown's symbolic iconography. The Yoruba doors, carved with horizontal registers of de tailed narrative scenes, reflect Yoruba daily life and ritual. The scenes include symbols of worldliness and cultural intersections such as bicycles, one of the most popular imported modes of transportation in Africa. The label describes how consummate artists such as Areogun, who carved these doors, incorporated new ideas and motifs into their art to further enhance an object's artistry and capacity. Beauty and Purpose: Art that Works. Moving beyond these six singular objects, the visitor encounters a 22-foot display with smaller objects, all utilitarian in some way but rendered in the most exquisite forms. These works show that even objects of more mundane purposes, such as containers, seats, sleeping pil lows, and baby carriers, are enhanced and beautified so as to increase their effectiveness. Most of the objects are arranged in multiple groupings, showing visitors the many variations and innovations possible within a single aesthetic canon or artistic genre. This strategy allows us to share some of the breadth and depth of Fowler Museum collections. The display includes a mul ticultural array of examples such as: Japanese baskets of minimalist design made to hold flower arrangements (early to mid-20th century; Fig. 7); A grouping of ancient Peruvian vessels, some with complex polychrome design elements and others depicting anthropomor phic and zoomorphic scenes in three dimensions (2nd-15th cen turies C.E.); A variety of finely carved and decorated headrests from Asia, Africa, and the Pacific used as sleeping pillows (lOth-19th cen turies; Fig. 8); Southeast Asian areca nut (betel) cutters and spatulas of ele gant form (l9th-2Oth centuries); Elaborately decorated Nigerian gourds used for domestic life (20th century); and Domestic furnishings from Africa and its diasporas, such as a richly symbolic Suriname stool, a figurative Mangbetu/Zande trinket box (Fig. 9), a Chokwe seat (Fig. 10), and a beautifully inlaid Swahili chair from Lamu Island off the coast of Kenya (18th-20th centuries). An audio-guide stop in the linear tour invites visitors to notice how these objects are embellished and enhanced in ways that ele vate everyday activities and imbue them with special significance and value. For example, headrests from Polynesia, China, and Central Africa may be used as pillows for the head, while at the same time being vehicles for communicating with the ancestors through dreams or fulfilling other functions. An object may per form -several roles at once and have multiple layers of meaning and significance without any contradiction whatsoever. The Mangbetu/Zande container, which masterfully combines the shape of a cylindrical box with an anthropomorphic form, is designated as an Object of Encounter, whose pull-out panel ex plains that figurative images in this region of Africa may have been influenced by the presence and tastes of foreign visitors who were commissioning objects from local artists in the late nine teenth and early twentieth centuries. Art and Knowledge Visitors now enter a section of works singled out for their ability to encode, protect, transmit, or elicit knowledge. That is, they have meaning and the ability to teach and impart wisdom, not only to their original owners, makers, and users, but also to us-here and now. In this section we invite visitors to think deeply about this seemingly simple concept. They explore how objects can commu nicate historical knowledge about cultures for which we have no written records; stimulate memory through graphic and written inscriptions and serve as vehicles for oral traditions; instruct, edu cate, and initiate through performance; convey identity through dress and adornment; and celebrate heritage through reference to ancestors, genealogies, and migrations. Each of these subthemes is explored through both cross-cultural displays (with a selection of varied objects from diverse parts of the world sharing a similar approach to a topic) and those devoted to a single case study. The visitor first encounters a case containing four Moche fine line painted ceramic vessels. There are no existing written records from the Moche peoples of the north coast of Peru. Yet a pot tery tradition of remarkable beauty, precision, and informational wealth has survived, and the Fowler Museum possesses one of the most significant collections of Moche ceramics, dating from 100-700 C.E. Visitors learn through an audio-guide stop and a video, narrated by Moche archaeologist and UCLA professor Christopher B. Donnan, that the analysis of pottery forms, iconog raphy, contexts, and other data, has allowed art historians and archaeologists to piece together a picture of ancient life among the Moche. The works in this section show visitors that art can be a remarkable window onto the past, and each individual label demonstrates what an object can reveal about a culture's history. Memory and Cosmology. A large wall case contains a suite of cross-cultural objects that serve to encode and to communi cate memory and cosmology. As the linear tour in the audio-guide explains, not only does art assist the outsider looking in upon a culture's past, but also many peoples of Asia, the Americas, and Africa have devised complex visual systems for recording and nar rating their own histories, family stories, and other vital cultur al information. Some cultures had writing systems, such as the WInter 2006 * 8rican artS 27</page><page sequence="15">DON COLE Maya's hieroglyphics, which were merged with art forms to impart vital information. In other cases, systems of graphic in scription such as those found on a Tibetan mandala or a Batak cal endrical instrument both were artfully rendered and served to transmit knowledge. Finally, many art works are visual stimuli for oral traditions, such as a virtuoso ntan drum from Ghana (Fig. 11) carved by Osei Bonsu in 1935 and covered with visual motifs that recall proverbs, and a Luba royal bow and arrow holder from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which evoked stories of the culture hero who introduced kingship to the Luba. Performing Knowledge. Museums use objects as teach ing devices for instructing the public, yet much of the art in the Fowler collections was always intended for this purpose in its earlier contexts. In this section, visitors have the opportunity to compare three case studies from Asia, Africa, and Native North America that offer specific examples of the ways art objects have and continue to serve educational roles. Among these are: Delicate puppets from Burma (early-mid 20th century) accom panied by a small video screen showing puppet theater in action. The Fowler has one of the largest collections of Asian puppets in the world and selections from its Indian, Southeast Asian, and Chinese puppets will appear in this space in rotation, represent ing a remarkably broad range of characters; Two stunning, yet highly distinctive masks used for initiation in Africa; one from a Mende girl's initiation in Sierra Leone (Fig. 12) and the other from a Yaka boy's initiation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (both 19th century); and Early 20th century Hopi katsina dolls (also called tithu) used to teach youth about the complex pantheon of katsinam spirits. The Object of Encounter in this section is a later twentieth century Hopi katsina-an image that many museum visitors will recognize. Katsinam have become increasingly commodi fied in recent years, both among Hopi themselves who are experimenting with new forms and ideas, and also among non Hopi-on the Navajo reservation, in factories in the Philip pines, and at the design firm of Hermes Paris. The label for this work includes a quote from Hopi artist Gerry Quotskuyva, who addresses issues of appropriation and reinterpretation by sug - -~ DON COLE gesting that different perspectives can ensure the dynamism of Hopi art. Dress and Identity. The Fowler Museum's textile holdings are among the most important in the United States, and there is no dearth of first-rate examples to show how dress communicates identity in cultures worldwide. Visitors encounter examples from one culture area at a time, but the works in this display will rotate three times yearly. Not only is this necessary for the preservation of the textiles themselves, but it also offers the opportunity to look deeply at more than one specific case. The first to be featured is an outstanding collection of beauti fully woven and ikat-dyed women's coats from multiethnic com munities in Uzbekistan. Interpretive text and an audio stop invite visitors to think about the messages we communicate about ourselves in what we choose to wear. Field photographs offer a wider lens for understanding the role of dress in cultural context. Detailed information about styles, designs, and the history of their production are provided through an Added Perspective pull out label.

Proclaiming Heritage. In addition to art forms that encode identity, many Fowler objects are intended as conduits for com munication of ancestral heritage. Through a work of art the living may continue to communicate with the deceased and also to re member the long lines of ancestry from which one descends. The visitor here encounters one of the most dramatic displays in the exhibition. Twelve carved wooden sculptures of ancestors, in cluding architectural elements and free-standing figures, serve as examples of one of the most important art forms of the Aus tronesian peoples of the Pacific. Varying in artistic style from the realistic to the highly abstract, these sculptures were prominently displayed in noble lineage houses or in village plazas. There they served to remind the inhabitants of the heritage of their ancestors, who first established the leading clans of the settlement. The fig ures on display include several masterpieces, such as one of the finest and most prized Nias Island (Indonesia) sculptures known; a massive, boldly abstract doorpost from New Caledonia (Fig. 13); and a pair of elegant ancestor-topped posts from Leti (eastem In donesia). In the audio-guide, Fowler curator Roy Hamilton ex plains how sculptures like these, together with sacred place names, kept orally transmitted memory alive.

Art and Power The next major section of the exhibition features arts made for purposes of empowerment. Their importance is in large measure associated with their ability to assert political authority, assure control over the environment, negotiate male/female relation ships, and express status and prestige. The first work that the vis itor encounters in this section is a dramatic and outstanding 19th century flute stopper from the Mundugumor peoples of the East Sepik Province in Papua New Guinea (Fig. 14). Such a work of art would have been the prerogative of a men's association, its pur pose to guard and protect men's secret knowledge. The label introducing this section explains that power is defined in culturally specific ways that reflect the priorities and values of a people. For example, political power is not always indicative of mil itary might or authoritarian leadership. It may reside, rather, in a king's quick wit and oratorical wisdom, or in a ruler's implicit link to the spirit world. Such attributes are often embodied in the de tailed iconography of leadership arts or in the rarity and labor intensiveness of personal prestige articles. Likewise, empowering men and women is not simply a question of bestowing separate rights on each of the sexes, but may involve a kind of theater of negotiation. Art works are able to facilitate and represent these power relationships through their forms and attendant meanings. Empowering Leaders. The intersections of art and lead ership are explored in a striking display of Cameroon Grassfields royal arts. The centerpiece of the case is a massive wooden Bamileke mask that celebrated royal authority and chiefly power-one of the Fowler's most famous objects (Fig. 15). This pre-WWI object, of which only a dozen are known, is a tour de-force of African art. It leads visitors to a rich case study of Cameroon Grassfields arts of leadership that includes monumen tal masks and figures and beaded regalia from the Bamum, Kom, Babanki, and other kingdoms in which the arts play a central and direct role in govemance and authority. The pieces in this section are coupled with spectacular and informative field photographs that show visitors how the objects looked during performances and royal processions. The related video features recent footage from the research of Christraud Geary and is narrated in first per son by Usmanou Nsangou. Negotiating Gender. This section consists of ten superior works that demonstrate how art can define male and female roles q COLE african arls * winter 2011</page><page sequence="18">DON COLE DON COLE in society. Fowler collections hold numerous objects that embody concepts about gender and that enable men and women to ex press their differences and interdependencies. They include: A Toba Batak knife adomed with a superb miniature depiction of a husband and wife. Once an object of ceremonial exchange at a marriage, its iconography depicts the complementarity of the sexes (late 19th-early 20th century; Fig. 16); and Baule nature spirit figures (Fig. 17) and spirit spouse figures from Cote d'Ivoire that embody the spirit of the opposite sex, which every member of the society is thought to have in the oth erworld. An Object of Encounter text panel discusses how the 20th century Baule spirit spouse couple donning Westem dress and bright industrial paint demonstrates the ongoing vitality of this tradition. Other objects reinforce the power of one gender or the other: An outstanding 19th century Yoruba Gelede mask from Nige ria, attributed to Labintan, that was made and wom by men to honor and placate the powers of "our mothers" (late 19th-early 20th century; Fig. 18); A compelling Egungun headdress, attributed to Adugbologe, depicting a male hunter, reinforcing the ethos and power of hunt ing as a man's profession and also as a conduit to great reserves of power (made prior to 1922; Fig. 19); A seldom exhibited yet renowned work of Mbole art from the Wellcome collection depicting a male figure with a white, heart shaped face, in a position of suspension in reference to the require ment of male initiates never to divulge the secrets of the associ ation to women (19th century; Fig. 20); and An 18th-19th century Luba royal figure from the Democratic Republic of the Congo once owned by a male ruler. It depicts a female figure to express the importance of women in traditional Luba politics and to attract the spirits through its aesthetic per fection (Fig. 21). Harnessing Spirits. Animal forms are pervasive in the arts of many of the cultures the Fowler Museum represents, but this section looks specifically at those made to control and har ness the powers of spirits in nature. An outstanding group of works with fantastic forms and composite imagery make man ifest the forces of the natural world and the diverse animals that populate it. Such animals sometimes pose dangers, but they can also be sources of food, shelter, trade, and vehicles for spirit beings. In other cases, they may serve as metaphors for human behavior, or they may have properties that are efficacious for healing and/or other forms of protection and empowerment. This section includes: A muscular Borneo hornbill figure that tests the boundaries of the supernatural. One of the Fowler's most famous pieces, it is recognized as one of the finest works of carving from Borneo extant today (early 20th century; Fig. 22); winlor 2006 arlIcan arts 31</page><page sequence="19">Animal crest masks from the Fowler's remarkable Pacific Northwest Coast collection, including a polychrome Nisga'a frontlet depicting a white owl through a combination of materi als including wood, walrus whiskers, and leather (19th century; Fig. 23); and A superb African mask from the Igbo people of Nigeria by Ezeki Ngwo made from 1940-50, whose accumulation of ele ments from the natural world conveys the unleashed potentiality of the animal forms it references (Fig. 24). Visitors can explore concepts of activation or power that inhere within these zoomorphic objects. Interpretive labels reinforce the message that each of these artistic forms has the ability to harness spiritual power and to help people control the forces of nature. Status and Prestige. Individual empowerment may be expressed through articles of prestige and status such as em blems, insignia, and jewelry; objects made from rare and precious materials; labor-intensive works of art; and things of beauty, precision, elegance, and grace. Such articles occur in almost every culture worldwide, and their role is often to extend the person physically and metaphorically. Whether through the wearing of dramatic and aggrandizing garments or through the possession of worldly items, a person becomes more than him- or herself. Such objects are displayed to emphasize their exquisite form and detail. A wall text describes the themes of this section, and the audio-guide invites visitors to consider shared methods for ex pressing status and prestige and also to notice what makes each cultural example aesthetically distinctive. Visitors first view a small group of works in materials in cluding gold, jade, ivory, silk, feathers, shell, brass, and bronze. Among them are: A treasury of 17th-century Akan gold in the form of a spectac ular necklace and bracelet, as well as a gold-covered linguist staff (c. 1930; Fig. 25); A Kuba embroidered skirt of complex geometric patterning from Central Africa that was used to denote royal status (19th century); An ancient Olmec maskette and a Guerrero figurine from Cen tral Mexico, both carved from jade (Pre-Classic, 1200 to 300 B.C.E.); Two tiny ivory pendants from the Luba and Pende of Central Africa that served as precious personal articles of value and beauty (18th-20th centuries; Fig. 26); and Two brass castings from the Benin kingdom of Nigeria (18th 19th century; Fig. 27), stnning examples of the artistry and com plexity of Benin iconography, that demonstrate the conceptual intersections between power and art. A significant object in this section on prestige items (and also an Object of Encounter) is an intricately carved ivory tusk from the Loango coast of central Africa (c. 1850) representing an early example of tourist art in Africa. Only about 600 of these carvings were produced during the latter half of the nineteenth century by a prestigious carving guild, mostly as souvenirs commissioned by European trading companies; a few were presented as gifts from African to European royalty to signify worldliness and wealth. Their iconography is a mixture of African and European imagery, with contemporary European images seen through the eyes of Congolese artists. Visitors are guided to consider the tusk's dis tinctive profile of Queen Victoria. Art and Transformation While many works serve to maintain the status quo and/or to ensure social harmony, there are some objects whose purpose is specifically to cope with challenges and change. The fourth and final major section of the exhibition features works that are made to assist with life's essential transitions and transformations. Ob jects may be used for spiritual intervention, healing, and other forms of problem solving. They may be used to assist the passage through death. Or they may reflect the dynamic nature of chang ing artistic traditions. Arts for Spiritual Intervention. Cultures around the world have specific ways of coping with difficulties, misfortunes, and challenges. For some peoples, objects are made as vessels or abodes for spirits and other agents of change. By constructing an object in a particular way, the object attracts the spirit to it, and thereby can impact a person's or community's life. A striking array of figures used for spiritual intervention welcomes the visitor into the gallery. Central African power figures from the Songye, Yombe, Bembe, and Kongo are well known for their bold forms, varied iconography of gesture, and accumulative aes thetic that implies process and continual visual transformation (Figs. 28 and 29). A random-access audio stop features celebrated art historian Robert Farris Thompson, who discusses the potent meanings and capacities underlying gesture and iconography in Kongo figures. Also in the section is a group of finely painted Japanese ema wooden votive tablets used to secure divine intercession-and Mexican retablos-often found on home altars as focal points of devotional practice. In both cases, these works are objects of divine mediation and bridges to transformation. Three figures from mainstream world religions are also featured in this gallery: a large Burmese Buddha; a Philippine colonial santo figure depict ing St. Jacinto; and a carved stone Hindu temple sculpture from India representing a yogini. In contrast to the intimate quality of the emas, retablos, and power figures, which can be commissioned by individuals, these objects of devotion belonged to temples and churches and were communally owned and publicly viewed. Memorials and Transcendence. Myriad artformsin the Fowler's holdings were made to cope with human mortality and the inevitability of death. The visitor first encounters five ex amples of funerary objects from West Mexico, which emphasize the vital role of the arts in the last phases of life and on the spirit's journey to the hereafter. These intriguing objects, which were made and used in the states of Nayarit, Colima, and Jalisco, are juxtaposed with a far more contemporary tradition of memorial ization of the dead in Mexico: a tree of death dedicated to the fam ilies of the recent female murder victims known as the Women of Juarez. This dramatic and powerful sculpture was made for a Day of the Dead altar in 2003 by Veronica Castillo Hemaindez and has helped families to cope with the violent loss of their loved ones. Some objects in this section are protectors of the relics of the deceased, such as the dynamic eighteenth-nineteenth cen tury works by Kota and Ndzebi/Sango artists of Gabon in West Central Africa (Fig. 30). In an adjacent case, an assemblage of seven spectacular carved and painted figures represent the Malagan funerary tradition of New Ireland (Papua New Guinea; Left: 28. Seated male figure Yombe peoples, Democratic Republic of the Congo; late 19th century Wood, glass; H. 30.5cm (12") X65.7498; Gift of the Wellcome Trust Right: 29.

The figures are grouped in a tableau to suggest the man ner in which they would once have been displayed for the most important post-burial rites of this Melanesian society. Historic photographs provide further context to assist visitors in explor ing the transformative power of these figures, which would have been left to decay in the tropical climate of the island. An Added Perspective label details New Ireland concepts of memory and death and how a person is memorialized through the recreation of the artistic motifs he invented during his lifetime. Tradition as Innovation. Just as most funerary arts are associated with rebirth and renewal, so are many of the arts of these cultures in constant states of reformulation. Many Fowler holdings reflect this dynamic aspect of art and visual culture and the linking of the past to the present. Some art forms of the con temporary moment may express resistance movements, social commentary, and/or modem urban life. The closing works attest to cultures and communities in transition, and the vital role of the arts to express historical transformations. For example, one work by South African artist Masaego Jo hannes Segogela, titled Death of Apartheid, is a powerful and poignant commentary on the end of one era and the beginning of a new one. Through a grouping of carved and painted wood figures at a funeral, loss is transformed into hope, and grief leads to new beginnings. Another work in this room is an en semble of truly dramatic papier-mache figures made by the re nowned Linares family of Mexico depicting lively skeletons and their steeds (Fig. 32). This installation, called La Calavera Don Quijote, made in 1980, expresses the entwined and interdepen dent nature of life and death, while also commenting on political reform and transformation. The audio-guide stop features repre sentatives of the Linares family speaking about their art and its DON COLE DN OLE winter 211o 1 african arts 33</page><page sequence="21">relationships to changing traditions in Mexico and in Chicano communities of America, and a small video screen shows vari ous stages of the the artists's creation of the figures. An elegant ceramic vessel by the Kenya-bom, England-based artist Magdalene Odundo beautifully illustrates the way a cen turies-old process of African hand-building can be transformed to a new set of uses and meanings through modem technology (Fig. 33). Odundo blends tradition with innovation and has cre ated ceramic vessels that transcend the functional to become aes thetic gestures laden with associations and references. An Object of Encounter panel addresses the use of technology in her inven tion of new forms. On the final wall leading out of the exhibition hangs a highly dramatic large-scale painting by contemporary Haitian-American artist Edouard Duval-Carrie, whose multimedia works address the active involvement of Vodou deities in the lives of Haitians. His paintings are represented in many major museum collections in the US and abroad. This display will rotate annually, always representing a major contemporary work by an artist with links to Africa, Asia, the Pacific, Latin America, or Native North America. The exhibition thus concludes with the visual message that art is active, on the move, and working in the present. While many ob jects in the Fowler collections emanate from deeply rooted, long standing traditions, they have rarely been static. Rather, their forms have been constantly updated and reinvented to meet changing social circumstances, to accommodate new media and technologies, and to reflect the dynamism of art and culture around the world. In conclusion, what will "Intersections: World Arts, Local Lives" mean for the Fowler Museum and its long-range goals and objec tives? Internally, it will ground our exhibition program with a dynamic orientation to our collections and mission, while leaving us more time to develop new temporary projects. The small, rotat ing "Fowler in Focus" gallery at the center of "Intersections" can become a laboratory for experimentation, spontaneity, and col laboration. This new exhibition will have many overlapping outreach possibilities: for general audiences, it can help put the Fowler more firmly on the map as the premiere southern California venue for non-Westem arts. For collectors and donors, DON COLE 34 afplcan arts * winter 2006</page><page sequence="22">we can demonstrate that we have made a strong commitment to showing our collections, some of which they have given us. For faculty at UCLA, it can provide a predictable resource for integra tion into course curricula, and for K-12 teachers incorporation into classroom activities and programs of repeat visitation. And, it can help strengthen our identity as a museum that presents powerful global artistic traditions and insists on linking them to local lives. To this end, we have changed our name to the Fowler Museum at UCLA, dropping the "cultural history" designation, a term that has long confused our visitors, linked us with anthropology mu seums, excluded us from the ranks of art museums and, essen tially, distracted from the fundamental work we have always done to underscore the inextricability of world arts and cultures. "Intersections: World Arts, Local Lives" lets us close the gap between art and ethnography as well as between the classical and the contemporary. Bringing objects and ideas into cross-cul tural intersection promises to be provocative and illuminating. Drawing on the metaphor of the vast streetscape of Los Angeles, intersections can be crossroads for collisions or convergences of communities, traditions, and visual expression. U Opposite page: 30.
