<plain_text><page sequence="1">A NATURALIST REALISM C. A. HOOKER 1. Prolegomenon Realism as I conceive it is focussed on understanding the whole cognitive process on the planet — human Cognition centrally, but set in a larger evolutionary framework ; individual cognitive fonctions certainly, but set in a social, societal and even species process framework. Realism accepts Cognition as fundamentally involving an organism-world (in cluding organism-organism) relation, it is metaphysically and epistemo logically anti-idealist and anti-empiricist. Naturalism accepts that Cogni tion is an evolved capacity ; it is anti-transcendental but also uncommitted to reductionism or materialism. Understanding Cognition ranges from the stratosphère of meta-philosophical principle to the groundwork of scien tific detail. This brief essay will remain largely in the clouds ; I shall concentrate on setting out a framework of Realist principles I believe adequate to this task. I also believe them necessary to a defensible realist theory. Most of this statement is drawn from a larger statement, "Evolu tionary Naturalist Realism : Circa 1985", written specially for a volume of my essays on realism which will appear in 1987 under the State University of New York Press label A Realist Theory of Science (Hooker 1987). Other essays in the volume are Hooker 1974, 1975a, c, 1976, 1982, 1985. 2. An Evolutionary Naturalist Realist Manifesto 2.1. Realism The central idea of realism, as a theory of scientific knowledge, is that knower and known are related causally, not more strongly (say of logical or conceptual necessity). To put this metaphysics bluntly : humans are parts of the world, knowing it through the interactions (both within and</page><page sequence="2">6 C. A. HOOKER without them) that permeate it. Or perhaps : humans are sub-systems of a world system which includes cognitive organisation within it. The realist idea is often expressed in the slogan that there exists an independent reality, but the independence here must be understood to mean logical independence, not causal independence. The realist can allow very strong causal interactions between mind and reality, for that precisely still involves a reality whose basic character is mind-independent. This picture of humans is supported by the naturalistic evolutionary conception of ourselves from science. The basic metaphysics then provides a framework for characteristic realist Claims : Metaphysical component R, : Existence is logically and conceptually independent of epistemic conditions (reality exists independently of knowing). R2 : Reality is knowable (ceteris paribus, at some 'level' etc.) and knower and known are related causally (nomicly etc.), not in any stronger constituitive manner. Semantic component R3: Truth consists in an appropriate correspondence relation holding between language and the world. R,: Truth obtains or fails independently of all epistemic acceptance/rejec tion criteria. RS: Theories of science are candidates for truth as well as for epistemic acceptance or rejection. Κ (therefore) Theoretical terms have semantic content appropriate to their being components of truth candidates and this semantic content is not wholly reducible to the semantics of observation terms. Epistemic Component R7 : At any given time, it is the overall epistemic value of a theory, of which its empirical adequacy is but one component, which determines our rational epistemic attitude to it. R8 : Our most valuable theories are our most acceptable guides to reality. There is nothing sacrosanct about these précisé versions. By contrast, I have deliberately not included in the foregoing list of realist theses any commitments in either the theory of perception or of mathematical and other abstract objects. These ofifer two additional senses to the term 'realist'. I don't believe that a scientific realist as understood here is logically required to be a realist about either perception or abstract</page><page sequence="3">A NATURALIST 7 objects — however I am certainly sympathetic to perceptual realism (see Hooker 1978). I have insisted that a substantial and defensible scientific realism involves the theses R, to R8 above. This is because together they have to add up to a coherent, believable conception of us and our world. Obviously there must be further doctrines than these (reserved for other sections below). I do not really believe that pursuit of a neat séparation of these doctrines into fundamental and derived would add insight, but I shall take R, to R8 as defining scientific realism for present purposes. (N.B. I shall also drop the qualifier 'scientific' hereafter to shorten the label to just 'realism'). These theses are, in all strictness, mutually logically independent of one another. But they are certainly not independent of one another qua components of realism for each is part of the best philosophie theory of science we have, so each is supported by the others. After these général characteristics of realism come Claims which delineate one brand of realism from another. For example, it might be claimed that there is no significant semantic distinction to be drawn between theoretical and observational terms, or that science aims solely at the truth, or that the history of science demonstrates progress toward the truth, or that the development of science is given by the dialectic of historical materialism, and so on. Additional Claims of this kind, together with the eight R doctrines and realism in perception and mathematics, give realists plenty of opportunity to disagree about what doctrine is labelled by that term. I do not believe that even the eight R doctrines stated suffice to characterise realism sufficiently deeply, though there is a need for systema tic taxonomy of realist principles at the R level. In my view the distinetive characteristics of evolutionary naturalistic realism are speeified in the meta-philosophy given at Hooker 1975c, sec. 6. These metaphilosophical commitments can be briefly summarized as follows : MNR, : There is no first philosophy ; no group of statements is to be held immune from criticism in the lights of other groups of aeeepted statements. MNR2 : The normativeness of philosophy consists in its being a général theory of the world, able to criticize belief, being, and practice in each area of life and to be criticized for its inadequaey to the subject matter in turn (cf. the theory/experiment relation). [Metaphilosophy has a similar status vis-a-vis philosophy.] MNR3 : The aim of epistemology is to explain how science, and Cognition generally, is possible, what are its limitations and what are the relations of epistemology to personal and social development.</page><page sequence="4">8 C. A. HOOKER MNR4 : The philosophical theory of language should be founded on a scientific theory of information use and exchange generally, and in humans in particular. MNR5 : The aim of rationality is to construct a theory of the well-fiinctioning mind, where 'well-fiinctioning' is informed by scientific theory. / Judgment, at once evaluative and factual, and risk, are the basic catégories of rationality theory, and rationality is the central concept in the philosophy of human functioning. MNR,, : Philosophy of science is a theory of science. It is out of these that the R theses take their detailed form vis-a-vis science and have their unity. I cannot emphasize this too strongly. There are then three levels of realism as I believe the term should be used : meta-philosophical (MNR Theses), core philosophical (R theses) and optional philosophical theses. 2.2. Naturalism The world is a natural unity The leading motif here is the commitment to theorising humans as a natural species, to seeing humans first as part of nature. An important part of this commitment is therefore to theorising Cognition as a natural capacity, one 'grading back' into the more generalised natural abilities of other species. If human emotional structures are to be understood then that unders tanding best begins by studying the évolution of the flight/fight and hedonic responses, from reptiles through the mammalian lines. This study will be both behavioural and neural, the two to be eventually unified. If human perception is to be cognitively understood then that understanding best begins with an understanding of the development of optical détection of motion and boundary in reptiles and its évolution through successively elaborated mammalian structures. If human language is to be understood, including its intentional and semantic structures, then that understanding best begins with the non-verbal understanding of early mammals, the information processing requirements of cross-model sensory coordina tion, opposed-thumb technologies and social co-operation, as well as the developmental significance of music (especially song) and dance drama. If science as an institutionalised activity is to be understood then that understanding should begin with the nature, especially the dynamics and limitations, of socio-biological co-ordination generally and of goal and method évolution in particular. On these themes see Hooker 1975c,</page><page sequence="5">A NATURALIST 9 sec. 6 ; and Hooker 1982 passim. The guiding teachers here are Jean Piaget, Konrad Lorentz and Conrad Waddington. Naturalism does not require reductionism. The unity intended here is that of intégration. E.g. the basic principles of perception are seen to apply equally to reptile and human, but within that unified framework the exfoliation of information-processing structure gives human perception a much greater cognitive capacity. But neither is ontological réduction required. Dualisms of many sorts are in principle quite consistent with naturalism. E.g. Whitehead's dualist physical and mental properties characterising a unified category of processes is compatible with natura lism. On the other hand, naturalism is not vacuous. E.g., there are plenty of specific psychological theories that are essentially anti-naturalist : e.g. ail those theories holding that language is a strongly distinct category from other psychological catégories, or that consciousness is. And of course vitalism in biology at large was typically anti-naturalist. Moreover, it is certainly possible to state sufficiently un-integrated or dis-unified dualisms as to rule out naturalism, e.g. that of Descartes. Realism does not logically require naturalism, it can take other forms. Why then adopt naturalism ? First because, as I read the history of science, naturalism is as a matter of fact the most theoretically fecund methodology available, it leads to the most insightful, accurate and usefiil scientific theories (cf. R7 above). Second, I believe that naturalism, with its systema tic anti-anthropocentrism and structured fallibilism, is ultimately the only way to philosophically defend realism (see Hooker 1974, 1975c, sec. 4 ; sec. 6.1). Third (this is really a special case of the first), naturalism is an essential part of the best philosophical explanation of the cognitive dynamics of science. For naturalism occupies an intermediate position on a philosophical continuum from rationalism/empiricism at one extreme to scepticism/conventionalism at the other. The rationalist and empiricist are both dogmatic, they are already certain about the nature and sources of knowledge, so they dogmaticly reject methodological évolution and Cognition of Cognition generally. The conventionalist and more radically the sceptic are 'morons' about Cognition, they reject the significance of questions concerning alternative goals for science, alternative methods for achieving those goals and the like. Both groups agree in dismissing cognitive évolution at the philosophical (meta-scientific) level. The natura list realist, by contrast, insists on theorising philosophy of science as a fallible theory of science, thus unifying cognitive theory. And within the</page><page sequence="6">10 C. A. HOOKER theory of science it is natural to discover that methodological évolution is absolutely central to the cognitive dynamics of science. These themes are expressed throughout the essay to follow. 2.3. Philosophical Interdependence Philosophy and science are inter-dependent, interact and should mutually cohere Unity implies that the theories of philosophy and science should cohere. Philosophy offers a général theory of the world. As such, its view of the world should cohere with the more specific view offered by science ( ceteris paribus, granted philosophie critique of science and doubts about various scientific theories, and vice versa for philosophy). So, the caté gories of metaphysics should be those appropriate to the ontologies of scientific theories ( ceteris paribus...), the epistemology should be possible for créatures with the biology and psychology of Homo sapiens, the theory of meaning should accord with the neuro-linguistic capacities and causal design of Homo sapiens, and so on. The spirit here is well captured by Piaget, especially in his attacks on both empiricism and rationalism. In practice, this kind of requirement proves quite stringent. It is very difficult to see with many standard philosophie concepts how they can 'grade off down the evolutionary sequence and/or how the properties they designate fit into an integrated causal/functional dynamics. (I find this, for example, for sense data, unanalysable intentionality and rationalist intui tions). The général upshot of these and like considérations is a complex interaction between philosophy and science, the two co-evolving, often in a highly dynamic way. 2.4. Anti-Anthropocentrism Humans have no Privileges created by philosophical fiai Perhaps the greatest triumph of science has been to break through unconscious anthropocentrism, rife among our species, to reveal Earth as but one planet among billions, humans as but one species among many, our societies as but a few complex systems among many. Though these and their ilk have been rude shocks to the ego, they have led to immea surably clearer Cognition of our real condition. Moreover they are, likely, a prerequisite for any substantial further achievement in other areas. (Note that religion, and philosophy, at their best, also enjoined transcending</page><page sequence="7">A NATURALIST 11 cultural, racial and national divisions and, in many cases the anthropocen tric viewpoint. This drive to cognitive transcendence then is central to being human and certainly to the philosophie enterprise). An important conséquence of naturalism is, therefore, anti-anthropocentrism (including anti-anthropomorphism as a special case). According to our present understanding of the world, man is not the measure of all things (not even persons are). Human sensory Cognition is limited and error-prone, human imagination is likewise limited and often parochial, human investigatory resources — e.g. planetary research stra tégies — are as yet poorly organised and poorly understood by humans, and so on. Yet humans have come historically from a practice which began by projecting human personhood out into ail the world (animism), which centred the world quite literally on humans (geocentrism) and which valued the world only in relation to humans (or even the local sub-group of humans — witness most religions). Anti-anthropocentrism is then opposed to ail these doctrines which, explicitly or covertly, remove humans from a place among other places in the scheme of things and install us in some privileged position by philosophical or cultural fiât. Recall that the essence of realism is that what is true is not tied logically or conceptually to human Cognition (nor to human culture), so if humans have special characteristics this is so independently of our assertion of it. Privileges humans may have, but not by human fiât. There are two grades of anthropocentrism. One is the straightforward meaty kind of the sort science has knocked about over the last few centuries, as indicated above. The other is a philosopher's back-door version, a diaphanous transcendental sort in which the anthropocentric limitations to human Cognition and/or meaning seems to arise out of semantic or epistemic 'analysis'. Hume ofFered an explicit version, so did Wittgenstein. Logical empiricism is anthropocentric, for it déclarés co gnitively meaningless ail assertions not verifiable by us, as if the world could not be anything but transparently accessible to us. And since the essence of idealism is to tie reality logically or conceptually to human Cognition (often in pursuit of epistemic security, or at least a transparent epistemic intelligibility), most idealisms share with empiricisms an un derlying anthropocentrism. This inevitably results in a misplaced centrality to human cognitive processes in the scheme of things (and, not at ail incidentally, often results in poor cognitive science). There is anthropo centrism in the pragmatist concept of truth as deflned by idealised scientific agreement, and this no matter how idealised the ideals are.</page><page sequence="8">12 C. A. HOOKER Anthropocentrism is widespread in contemporary philosophy. It has a current fashionableness derived from such Claims as (i) humans can never escape their concepts to grasp reality directly, from which truism it is (wrongly) inferred that that truth must be 'internal' to a conceptual scheme, or (ii) the nature of linguistic reference is such that we could never refer to the unverifiable (or perhaps unconfirmable, certainly unknowable) ('). Alternatively, humans are held to be locked in deter ministically to their culture (2), or locked semantically into their theo ries (3), so truth must be truth-for-the-social-group. Now it is certainly true that whatever is thought sententially must be conceptualised linguisti cally, and there are other truisms relevant to each of these views. But truisms don't constitute an argument (though they may be mistaken for one). So far as I can see there is no substantial theoretical evidence at the present time for supposing that we are limited or confmed in the foregoing ways ; to the contrary, science is constantly presenting us with conceptions of our cognitive access to the world which are both more and less limited than these philosophical divisions would suggest (4). In short, science is constantly doing and exhibiting what philosophers say can't be done or isn't intelligible. (One is reminded rather sharply of the philosophie Claims for traditional logic vis-a-vis the development of mathematical logics and the corresponding Claims for Euclidean geometry vis-a-vis the develop ment of non-Euclidean geometries). On the other hand, this is not to dismiss the real problems lying beneath the choice of simple anthropocen (1) See Rorty's 'pragmatism' (1982), note Putnam's (1981) and Ellis' (1985) internal 'realism', and Dummett's (1978, 1982) empiricist intuitionism. (2) See Bloor's (1976) and Barnes' (1977) sociology ofknowledge program, on which see Hooker 1986 sec. 3.6 and 4.3F. My view expressed is consonant with the carefiil critiques by Nicholas 1984 and Musgrave 1980 of Kuhn 1962 and by Trigg 1980, ch. 5 — although I acknowledge essential methodological reference to the Community, making no pretense to a disembodied 'objective' methodology. (In this respect I stand mid-way between empiricist/Popperian objectivism and relativism.) (3) See for example Kuhn's (1962) and Feyerabend's (1965a, b, c) incommensurabi lities. (4) For example theories of neuro-linguistic development transcend cultural boundaries and theoretical boundaries while the universe beyond the cosmic 'light horizon' remains epistemically inaccessible. Conversely, perhaps even the past — whose epistemic inaccessi bility in any mode but theory is itself an embarrassment to empiricism — may not be so simply inaccessible were closed time-like space-time paths and/or two-dimensional times to be developed more extensively within science and shown empirically applicable. Science has even stimulated recent discussion of what it might be to use systematically différent logical structures in the foundations of theory — I refer to so-called quantum logic (see e.g. Hooker 1975/79, 1979b, Holdsworth/Hooker 1983).</page><page sequence="9">A NATURALIST 13 trie epistemologies, e.g. what are the theoretical limits of mutual under standing (theoretical, cultural, etc.) ? Can these (or how far can these) be coherently theorised ? 2.5. Evolutionäry Perspective An evolutionary perspective is to leaven the construction of ail philosophie theory The requirements that philosophy and science cohere and neither be anthropocentric lead directly to adopting an evolutionary approach to our biology and Cognition. The evolutionary approach has important impli cations for developing theories of Cognition and consciousness generally, and for scientific epistemology (including perception and methodology), linguistic theory and theory of the dynamics of science in particular. These implications have been a constant theme in my writing, e.g. 1975c, 1976, 1978, 1982 passim. (Recall here that naturalist realism is not intrinsically committed to materialism). In the present context of the philosophy of science the evolutionary approach leads to three important conséquences for epistemological theory, namely the adoption of a thoroughgoing fallibilist stance, a shift from logic to rational acceptance and an emphasis on the basic rôles of risk and judgement in rational belief dynamics. These conséquences are fondamental for the way in which epistemology is developed ; they will be discussed under that heading (sec. 3 below). Here I elaborate briefly on the fallibilist theme, the most général of these three. 2.6. Fallibilism AU assertions are in principle open to criticism and revision An evolutionary perspective insists that we commence, epistemically, from profound ignorance, not only ignorance of the truth but ignorance even of what knowing is, of what theorising is. Popper (1934, 1963a) emphasised a fondamental dilemma for any créature seeking to progress epistemically from evolutionary ignorance : there is a clash between security and relief from ignorance ; each can be emphasised, but only at the expense of the other (5). Most philosophies have evaded this problem (5) Levi 1967, 1980 has articulated this clash by placing Popper's insight into a décision theoretic setting. Levi's original position runs into considérable difficulty over globally connecting acceptance divisions, see Bogdan 1976. More recently Niiniluoto 1984</page><page sequence="10">14 C. A. HOOKER by claiming some privileged source of knowledge (religious révélation, rational intuition, transcendental proof, empirical perception, etc.). Pop per argued that privileged sources have always created epistemic authorita rianisms which have stood in the way of cognitive progress. He added (1963b) that they have also laid the foundation for socio-political authori tarianisms as well, authoritarianisms which in the long run stand in the way of social progress. I accept these doctrines as fondamental insights. However, given our evolutionary circumstances, Popper evidently thought it rational to aim solely at relief from ignorance, maximising both bold conjecture and severity of criticism. But a glance at other species reminds us that whether this is the best strategy depends upon the nature of the environment (how stable, how predictable, how dangerous ...), the nature of our epistemic capacities in that environment (how specialised, how accurate ...) and the resources available for survival. In these respects my doctrine lies more in the spirit of Peirce and the American naturalists. All of these factors can be the subject of learning and each can also be modified through utilisation of information. So we can expect an evolving methodology, formed as a complex fonction of all three factors, the present State of each factor in turn a fonction of past méthodologies and the technological practices that emerged from them. This circumstance makes it piain that fallibilism characterises every level of cognitive theory and practice, from technologi cal practice through theory to philosophy of science (includes methodo logy) to meta-philosophy and so on 'up\ Moreover, the critical appraisal of these cognitive levels does not proceed independently or in a simple priority order ; rather, discoveries and changes at any one level potentially effect those at all other levels (cf. Hooker 1975c,sec. 6.1 ; 1976, sec. 3.6). In our circumstances, rationality calls for critical appraisal of both our accepted beliefs and our practices at all levels. This is the attitude of systematic fallibilism. One might add that Popper also thought that his insights into social authoritarianism required some form of classical individualism together with piecemeal social policy making. But it is a profound fact that our has examined Levi's continued attempts to develop and extend his views (e.g. in Levi 1980). Niiniluoto (1984, ch. 5) concludes that while Levi's system is a coherent alternative to a fallibilist realist one, it does not present a compelling alternative to it. I cannot pursue these important issues further here, but it bears directly on the understan ding of my nested contexts of acceptance model - see Hooker 1982, sec. XI, 1985, Sec. VI and 1986 sec. 3.2.</page><page sequence="11">A NATURALIST 15 cognitive development has catapulted us into a technological condition where it is often quite impossible to make social policy piecemeal (science policy included) because of the enormously widespread ramifications of social décisions nowadays. This is a theme which I have emphasised and elaborated elsewhere, see (1980a, b, 1980/1, 1983). Taken overall, then, it is this complex, dynamic and interacting system which we face today, an embedded sub-system forming the cognitive structure of the planet. Developing a philosophy of science is developing an understanding of what it is to be simultaneously subject, agent and theorist with respect to that system. Both theoretically and practically, achieving this understan ding represents the greatest intellectual and social challenge the species has faced. 2.7. Normative force Norms are theories Both interdependence and fallibilism require that philosophie theories are on the same epistemic level as are scientific theories (i.e. vis-a-vis rational acceptance) ; indeed, they are essentially required to be theories. Once the anti-naturalist préjudices of the western philosophie tradition are set aside, what is left of the normative rôle are the capacities to concep tually organise or systématisé and to critically evaluate. Precisely these are capacities which theories have in relation to their domains of evidence and explanation (6). An important conséquence of the present doctrine of the normative is this : the distinction between a normative theory and what it is normative for is quite compatible with holding that assertions at both levels have the epistemic status of fallible conjectures and thereby insisting that their contents develop in mutual interaction (just as happens for scientific theories and their data domains). Indeed, as I have constantly remarked, this is happening ail around us (see e.g. Hooker 1982). Yet the as sumption that we are forced to choose between accepting the empiricist dichotomy between the normative and the descriptive or rejecting it by (6) For this theme see Hooker 1975c, sec. 6.1 and for a critique of the western tradition see Hooker 1982, sec. VI. The idea of philosophy as a theory goes back, in the contemporary debates, at least to Kuhn (e.g. 1962, pp. 8-9). It is, however, at least tacit in much earlier realism, see e.g. R. W. Sellars, J. Dewey and J. Piaget, and even the positivist Schlick.</page><page sequence="12">16 C. A. HOOKER collapsing it, is widespread in philosophy ; e.g. it is evidently behind the Quinean move to a so-called naturalised epistemology (Quine, 1969). Here that dichotomy is rejected by insisting on interaction. Philosophy is theory, so realism offers a theory of science. Realism provides a theoretical framework for understanding science, i.e. one which offers an explanatorily unified and metaphysically penetrating account of science and, on that basis, realism offers a normative critique of scientific methods and assumptions. The assumption that rational methods are so for any kind of world is a natural one for those who think of philosophy as offering transcendent normative judgements of some sort. But it is not self-evident for a naturalist realist and I believe that a little reflection will show that it is in fact false. There is no a priori reason to suppose that realism in itself should explain the success of any particular methods, much less any particular theories, independently of considering the kind of world revealed to us through theory. Conversely, realism must also be accountable to science in the sense that the rational science which it describes cannot, without good explanatory reasons, be too far distant from the historical development of science. 2.8. Meta-philosophy and theory The meta-philosophical hierarchy is a theory hierarchy Meta-philosophy is a theory of philosophy. It should, therefore, provide a framework for philosophie theory capable of offering a normative critique of philosophical theory, methods and assumptions. It should be held accountable to the development of philosophy by providing explana tory understanding of that development and of the reasonableness of philosophie methods. I have tried to provide a meta-philosophy of just this character for evolutionary naturalist realism — see Hooker 1975c and cf. sec. 2.1 above. The first principle of that meta-philosophy expresses the fallibilist doc trine, the second the doctrine that norms are theories and the sixth applies both principles to philosophy of sciences in particular. The third, fourth and fifth doctrines formulate goals for theories of epistemology, language and rationality in such a way that they express the doctrine of unity and its more specific conséquence, philosophie interdependence. (A perusal of the discussion in the commentaries to these doctrines will underline the centrality of interdependence to their formulation). Moreover, I suggest</page><page sequence="13">A NATURALIST 17 quite concretely that interaction between philosophy and science liberates philosophy (and science) from narrowing dogmatic assumptions. Pursuit of these perspectives meta-philosophically shifts the foci at the philosophical level in theories of epistemology, language and rationality. When one begins from ignorance as to what Cognition is, the most important and interesting questions are "How is Cognition possible" and "What kinds of organisation in what kinds of systems can be cognitive ?". These are very différent questions from the language-biased, success rather than process oriented, human agent biased questions of traditional episte mology such as "What is the logical analysis of 'X knows that p' ?" Similarly for rationality theory, what shifts to the fore is the understanding of interacting systems of risk-taking and judgement (judgements both normative and factual). We learn about the characteristics of our own perceptual capacities while learning about the world generally ; in the same way we learn meta-philosophically about the specific characters of, and inter-relations among, theories of epistemology, rationality, language and so forth. Thus there emerges an open-ended hierarchy of learning : it is, as it were, fallible learning 'ail the way up'. The existence of open-ended learning processes is central to the realist rejection of ail those philosophical attempts to create a neat world by philosophie fiât. It is, for example, at the base of the realist rejection of the currently fashionable idea that truth can be defined in terms of idealised rational agreement. For if there is an open-ended capacity to learn then rules of rational agreement or commit ment, especially idealised rules, can be specified only through appeal to their capacity to capture reality truly. The neglect of the open texture of our more abstract cognitive methods has its counterpart in the neglect of the open texture of the interaction between our biological cognitive methods (perception) and technology. The earlier empiricist notion that one could separate the observable and unobservable by semantic fiât has given way to the admission that the development of technology is constantly shifting the dividing line. Kantian idealism had it that the basic cognitive structure of the mind was fixed a priori, only to have Kant's own version exploded by working scientific counterexamples (7). An evolutionary account of our basic cognitive (7) For the critique of the observable/unobservable distinction see e.g. the review in Suppe 1974a. Recent empiricists such as van Fraassen have explicitly abandoned the old attempts to draw the distinction but still illegitimately rely on the notion, see Hooker 1985,</page><page sequence="14">18 C. A. HOOKER methods, i.e. our perceptual methods and their neural organisation, makes it clear that those capacities are still dynamic, still open to change, indeed possibly still accessible to change by our own technologies. For this reason it is an illusion to speak of a 'completed human biology' as an ultimate basis for some notion of epistemic privilege to observation. The open texture of our biologically-based cognitive future means that even these attempts are covert ways to create privilege through philosophie fiât. Here then is a wonderfally open-textured dynamic of conceptualisation and observation in which our own perceptual capacities, our fand of conceptualised scientific and philosophical theories and méthodologies, and our technological capacities, are beginning to evolve in dynamic interaction with each other. How is one to speeify in advance an outcome to this process ? The main problem of philosophy is to understand it in all its complexity, not to attempt to confine it (inevitably by fiat) in advance. This complétés my account of a realist manifesto of an evolutionary naturalist kind. There follows now an examination of some more specific realist doctrines, to illustrate the application of the position. For other applications see Hooker 1986a. 3. Realism Applied : Epistemology Mapping, not mirroring, is the construction metaphor ; commitment, not logic, the structure metaphor In 1978 I wrote that in perception "The features of the world that are mapped and the way they are mapped into the existing informational State of the organism are idiosyncratically selected according to the organism's ends, in the light of its capacities ; thus we expect no identities, only transformations and embeddings appropriate to making appropriate identifications for action." (1978, pp. 408 and 411-412) This approach to perception as a dynamic cognitive system is now commonplace in the sec. VI and Churchland/Hooker 1985 generally. On difficulties with Kant's catégories see e.g. Reichenbach 1965 ; cf. the attempts of the modem German school of evolutionary epistemology to give them a fallibilist reading, Campbell 1973, Lorenz 1976, Wuketits 1983. For physics simply consider the abandonment of universal causality and of Euclidean or even of simple Riemannian geometries, the notions of a non-classical logical or possibility structure and of space and time as perhaps Statistical rather than fundamental features of reality, the exploration of simplices and fùzzy sets as replacements for indivi duals of various kinds and so on.</page><page sequence="15">A NATURALIST 19 sciences but is has important conséquences for philosophy. For example, it leads one to an analysis of the underlying assumptions of the classic anti-realist argument in perception theory from the occurrence of illusion and hallucination. With these underlying assumptions displayed explicitly it runs somewhat as follows (1978, pp. 419-420) : P, : Sensory illusions and hallucinations are logically possible (indeed they occur). P2 : Veridical perception is indistinguishable to the mind from illusory and hallucinatory perception, qua perceptual experience. A, : The mind is epistemically self-transparent. A3 : Perception logically requires a consciously examined content. A4 : Perceptual contents are objects, i.e., individuals of the ontology. C, : What is before the mind in veridical perception are objects of the same rôle, type and status as are those objects before the mind in illusory and hallucinatory perception. A5 : Perception is veridical if and only if what is before the mind is identical with what is in the external world. P3 : The contents of illusory and hallucinatory perceptions differ from the actual external situation presented to the perceiving subject. C2 : The objects before the mind in illusion and hallucination are not objects in the external world. C3 : What is before the mind in veridical perception are not objects in the external world. P4 : The objects of perception either belon to the external world or belong internally to the mind. C4 : What is before the mind in veridical perception are objects in the mind. (To this add the assumption A2 : Conscious awareness is propositional awareness, i.e. epistemic states are propositionally defined states). About these five assumptions I wrote as follows : ... a scientifically adequate theory of perception and mind requires the rejection of ail five assumptions of the epistemological approach. The importance of the rôle of the subconscious/unconscious in mental fonctio ning and our ignorance of it is evidence enough that A, is false. Language is peripheral to nervous fonction, and the transformations occurring in the nervous system can be expected to be richer and nongrammatical in form. So A, is false. Consciousness being a phase of nervous fonction in a nervous system dominated by unconscious processes, perception does not require a conscious act at ail, nor is there plausibly a subject/object structure to conscious processes. So A3 is false. The nervous system processes infor mation in a manner dépendent jointly upon environment and organism.</page><page sequence="16">20 C. A. HOOKER Thus sense data, if we choose to introduce them as theoretical entities, will be structural features of nervous-system states, not objects of any sort, and not in any sort of subject/object relation to consciousness. Perception depends on structure-preserving mappings, not identities ; it depends on the extraction of information to make identifications rather than achieving identities. So A4 and As are false (1978, p. 411). Consider the 'received' or dominant western traditions in foundational epistemology. These all share the following paradigm : propositional source plus logical structure. There is a source of knowledge specified (senses, révélation, rational intuition, transcendental proof...). This source provides knowledge in the form of propositions and it is held to be strongly authenticating in the sense that it commands the mind's unquestioning assent to its deliverances (its givens). All other knowledge is rationally based on these given propositions and hence structured by the rational rules for relating propositional contents, logic. (Whether the logic is deductive or inductive is then best regarded as a variation within the paradigm, comparable to variations of source). Truth is automatically the dominant goal, with subsidiary goals deriving from logical resources : consistency, perhaps versions of coherence. (Idealists and/or pragmatists may often try to extract truth from coherence). This paradigm focuses attention on the analysis of 'X knows that p', where p is a place-holder for déclarative sentences. If the standard analysis is taken — 'X believes ρ, p is true and X has good reasons for believing p' — then a regress of reasons ensues, to be stopped at the source (cf. Armstrong 1973). Within this paradigm we can identify the direct truth proclaimers, such as Hempel and Armstrong, and a wide variety of those who, struggling to be critical of sources within these confines, are forced to Substitute coherence (Quine's 'web of belief ), problems (Popper's progress) or some other logic-based procédure (8). Notoriously, these latter positions have proved difficult to maintain (logic serves foundationa list epistemology) and have led still others to généralisé logic to proba bility of truth, to become odds-makers rather than truth-proclaimers, whether Bayesian in form (e.g. Horwich, Jeffrey) or not (Carnap's inductive calculi, Glymour's bootstraps, etc.) (9).

Harper/Hooker 1976.</page><page sequence="17">A NATURALIST 21 From an evolutionary naturalist perspective logic + source is not a plausible paradigm of epistemology. There are no strongly authenticating sources, rather there are multiple interactions with the world from which usefiil information is extracted (perception, reflection, various communi cation modes), none of it perfect. Though the world has a structure, this is not a magical all-pervading platonic object, unavoidably (perhaps even unspeakably) inherited by us. The key issue is how to rationally evaluate source différences and cognitive structure as a fiinction of goal priorities, circumstances and tolerable risk. But rationality gets no hold on the strongly authenticating source. Nor does risk-taking find any natural place in the source + logic paradigm. Indeed, since knowledge is a function only of source and logic, the conséquences of belief are irrelevant to its rationality. For these reasons it is difficult to understand the évolution of this kind of cognitive capacity from more elementary and less perfect capacities. Realist principles here counsel the development of cognitive capacities which are operationally possible and environmentally reinforceable for us as evolving organisms, and an epistemology which shows how knowledge is possible for a créature with those cognitive capacities. It is mysterious how the received view could meet this requirement. Indeed, it is a crucial feature of our epistemic situation, already noted, that in science we develop theories of the limitations of our own sensory capacities. The received view is forced back into schizophrénie double-think about these developments. Alternatively, it is forced on to either transcendental démonstrations or appeal to conscious incorrigibilities (l0). From the naturalist realist perspective Cognition is theorised as a natural phenomenon. In a certain sense one begins by 'taking it whole', theorising a biology of knowledge. Here the inspiration is Lorentz ( 1976) and Piaget (1970, 1971a,b), see also Campbell 1973). Systems perspectives add an important dimension (see e.g. Iberall 1972, Jantsch 1980, 1981). Contri butions to the same development by e.g. Calhoun (1984), Wojciechowski (1978, 1980) and others from the 'ecology of knowledge' movement expand the approach to embrace contemporary socio-epistemic problems. (10) More broadly, the received paradigm has a basic presupposition that knowledge is linguistic, the paradigm unit of knowledge being the proposition expressed by a déclarative sentence. But the study of intelligence provides no special support for this presupposition and there is evidence suggesting its falsity. This too has long been a theme in my writing, see e.g. 1975b, 1978. It is a place where I admit to issuing a promissory note to be redeemed by a major review of the issue some day.</page><page sequence="18">22 C. A. HOOKER These developments represent some progress but they are as yet un unified. Moreover, since we are building a theory, the normative dimen sion remains present but in this respect one feature of the lack of intégration is serious : the intégration of traditional epistemic theory remains nearly non-existent. In respect of this last, I suggest that the roadblock to intégration is the absence of an epistemic paradigm connecting cognitive system dynamics to cognitive rule structure. Here that link is best made, I believe, through a rational décision model. I hold this true for social theory generally (cf. the Vickers model in Hooker 1983). Consider then by way of contrast to the logic + source paradigm, an extended agency model of cognitive fonction in which the metaphor or paradigm for belief is practical commitment. Here we picture an organism inheriting and/or developing a set of epistemic goals and a set of epistemic methods working on multiple sources of information. The organism is rational just insofar as it adopts efficient methods for pursuing its episte mic goals given its sources of information. This simple theory needs to be complicated in several important ways, but first I should like to list a few of the advantages of this sort of approach. It integrates well with a naturalistic theory of cognitive capacities and organic évolution ; judge ment, risk and optimising all 'grade back' to more elementary opérations. And present capacities can be understood as outcomes of selection because belief-forming processes are directly related to, and tested by, their outcomes. There is no inherent linguistic bias, since there is no a priori commitment to the forms which cognitive states take or to the Channel characteristics of epistemic sources. Nor is there special anthro pomorphic bias in the choice of goals, this is left open initially, to be filled in as part of developing epistemic theory (more anon). There is no barrier to the reflexive critical évaluation of sources of of logical structure ; in pursuit of our epistemic goals we may quite consistently learn about the sources on which we are forced to rely and the structures we use to organise them. Via building theories of all these, we are able to criticise their limitations. Logical structures for the organisation of belief commit ments can also be recaptured within this framework, though there is no a priori commitment to any particular logical structure so that these too can be critically explored ("). (11) Logical structure may be recaptured, for example, through the use of dialogic constructions, see my 1979b. Part of what is re-captured will be uses of inductive argument</page><page sequence="19">A NATURALIST 23 Finally, the sceptic obtains no special purchase within this paradigm. The essential sceptical argument I take to be this : epistemology Ε is logically (perhaps actually) compatible with the occurrence of error, therefore Ε is not adequate. The link between logic, certainty and foun dationalism encourages this line of argument and the absence of any focus on deliberate risk-taking in epistemic rationality (in any but Popper's account) gives it a continued force. The alternative décision theoretic paradigm advocated here allows one to reject the sceptic's conclusion while accepting the premise, and the naturalist evolutionary framework actually shifts risk-taking to the fore as a focal part of epistemic acti vity (12). In science, as elsewhere, humans pursue valuable truth, and I recognise a fairly wide range of values qualifying truth in the scientific context. This means that acceptance has an equally complex structure. Technical control, e.g., is valuable for its facilitation of other goals (health, wealth...). It is also cognitively valuable twice over, first because it facilitâtes theory testing, concept formation, etc. and second because it is one kind of evidence that our theories have locked on to reality (Hooker 1986a, sec. 3.9, 4.4). Historically these twin pursuits dynamically interact. Thus beyond acceptance for belief there is a rich array of acceptances, accept for testing (in respects X,Y ...), accept for heuristic exploration (in respects ...), accept for technical application ... and so on. Empiricist and Popperian methodological debates encouraged the view that in science there was a simple acceptance/rejection structure, a Statement was either in or out. But the move to a décision theoretic epistemology delivers us from simplistic dichotomies, to reveal the complex texture of Cognition. Having outlined and argued for the non-traditional decision-theoretic paradigm for epistemology, it is now time to briefly review the diflficulties of various kinds, as well as inference to the best explanation, see e.g. Hooker 1986a, sec. 3.5, 4.2, 4.3 A,B. (12) Thus the sceptic's implicit premise, namely that if an epistemology is consistent with a possibility of error then it should be rejected, is itself rejected. Considering the large body of evidence in favour of a risk-oriented approach to evolutionary epistemology, how might the sceptic attempt to justify this premise ? To be meta-consistent the sceptic should be sceptical of the premise, which would leave the field to the epistemology with the weight of evidence in its favour ! Otherwise only some form of transcendental justification, or justification by conventionalist fiât, would seem to be a possibility. The fîrst is not likely and the second is objectionabie to an evolutionary naturalist realist. There are other forms of sceptical objection and these are taken up in Hooker 1974, sec. 4 and in 1986a, sec. 4.2, 4.4.</page><page sequence="20">24 C. A. HOOKER and programmatic features of this position. First, the view itself has only recently received serious theoretical attention and there is still a relative paucity of theoretical literature. In particular, there is a need to investigate conditions on the global development of belief systems so that they remain cognitively rational (cf. note 7). Beyond this, the view is heir to many of the controversies surrounding the foundations of décision theory itself. For example, there is clear scope for the occurrence of Allais-style paradoxes with the concomitant need to examine the role of risk vis-a-vis epistemic Utility explicitly. It seems to me what is required here is a theory of epistemically appropriate risk-utility trade-oif structures. There is scope for a clash between individual cognitive rationality and collective cognitive rationality (cognitive prisoner's dilemma games) and the limitations which confine political voting systems also confine the décision processes of epistemic institutions (cognitive Arrow paradoxes). Just as in the political case generally, so in Cognition it will be the designs of epistemic institu tions (scientific institutions) which determine the epistemic quality with which these constraints are handled. Thus another strength of the present epistemological paradigm is that it provides a natural framework for the importance of institutional theory within the theory of science (cf. Hooker 1982, 1983). Finally, formal décision theory has not made much theoretical progress in the treatment of inter-dependent utilities, hierarchially organised utilities, or in Utility dynamics. Yet these features are crucial to characte rising what it is to be a person, to characterising our most basic cognitive capacities (including our capacity for innovative resolution of décision theoretic paradoxes) and hence for characterising epistemic rationality in science. The décision theoretic epistemic paradigm therefore is still largely programmatic, but in my view it provides for a much stronger and richer, and much more plausible and promising, program for epistemological theory than its traditional alternative (13). And it is natural to a naturalist realist framework. (13) Note that the traditional alternative (source + logic) captures also Popper's epistemology without a knowing subject (1973), cf. Hooker 1981. There is a non traditional approach to epistemology which is like Popper's in this last respect, though radically opposed to the metaphysics of a 'third world', namely a Marxist-style theory of knowledge as an objective product of labour. From this perspective any epistemology which introduces as basic an epistemic subject is castigated as essentially idealist. Thus décision theoretic epistemologies count as idealistic however much they may oppose traditional idealism. They join empiricism in being counted against historical materialism,</page><page sequence="21">A NATURALIST 25 REFERENCES Armstrong, D. M. (1973).

I accept that a Marxist-style analysis has important lessons to teach, and precisely about the respects in which Cognition is like other economic and social activities (cf. also Rüben 1979). Human individuals certainly adapt to the institutional and more broadly cultural circumstances in which they find themselves and to that extent supra-individual characteris tics appear essentially in the analysis of any human activity. But in my view Cognition is not, fundamentally, just another economic (or socio-economic) activity, it also has a distinctive character and a fundamental role in human activity from which it is able to be a factor in transforming historical socio-economic processes. In Marxist jargon, base and superstructure are in interaction, the one is not determined by the other. For this reason I try to recapture Marxist insights through the theory of epistemic institutions.</page><page sequence="22">26 C. A. HOOKER Good, I. J. (1976).
