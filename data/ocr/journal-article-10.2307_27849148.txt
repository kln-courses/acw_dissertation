Talmage Recognition and Memory in the Cells of the Immune System Lymphocytes from the thymus have a complex recognition system that may be based on two linked receptors on their surface Immunologists, like computer ana lysts, tend to use anthropomorphic terms to describe the phenomena with which they work. This is because there are important similarities be tween the fundamental properties of both computers and the immune system and those of the human brain. Developmental biologists have always had an interest in the immune system because of its late emergence in on togeny and phylogeny and because it reproduces in the life of each indi vidual the processes of adaptation to the environment that have occurred in all species at a much slower pace. Cellular and molecular biologists find the immune system of great value as a model for the study of differentia tion and its control. In no other sys tem are the receptors and their anti gens as easily purified. The concept of gene splicing, which has recently been confirmed through the technology of DNA cloning, was first predicted by immunologists, and the immuno globulin genes have provided one of the first models for its direct demon stration. This article attempts to describe the basic components and operations of the immune system, without too much detail, as a general survey of the subject. Recent discoveries will be stressed since they justify the explo sive expansion of immunology as a field of study which began with Jen ner and Pasteur and which shows no sign of leveling off. Special emphasis will be given to the recognition system of the thymus-derived lymphocyte, a major type of white blood cell. Memory depends on the existence of diversity in the environment and its recognition. The diversity our im mune system recognizes is the fine structure of the invisible molecules that invade our bodies, particularly those excreted by and on the surface of bacteria and viruses. The breadth and specificity of this recognition is almost unlimited, since a change in the position of a single atom on newly created molecules is easily distin guished. The ability to recognize the tremen dous diversity of molecular structures both present and possible in nature depends on a vast array of natural protein receptors, found in all verte brates, called antibodies or immu noglobulins (Igs). There are probably more than a million different kinds of Igs in each individual, and they have sufficient diversity, specificity, and overlapping reactivity that a small fraction of them (e.g. 1 out of 10,000) will bind strongly with any conceiv able foreign molecular structure (antigen). The Igs are thus like a huge set of master keys designed in such a way that at least a few will be able to fit into any conceivable lock. The remarkable specificity of the immune system derives from the fact that the two subsets of Igs which react with two different antigens are themselves quite different. The number of Igs that are common to any two such subsets is usually insignifi cant unless the two antigens are quite similar in structure, in which case there will be a significant cross reac tion due to the large fraction of Igs in one subset that are also present in the other. Usually, however, some Igs are present that will react with one anti gen but not the other: these can be detected or isolated and form the basis of a most exquisite specificity. Immunoglobulin structure and diversity How can the DNA of the single cell from which each individual develops contain enough information to encode the millions of different Igs required for such an immune system? The answer is very simple but was not even suspected until the chemical structure of lg was determined. Each lg is made up of two kinds of polypeptide chains-light (L) and heavy (H)-and each chain is made up of at least three different re gions-constant (C), junction (J), and variable (V), as shown in Figure 1 (1 ). (The J region has been explicitly demonstrated in DNA only for the L chain, but because of the extensive homology between H and L chains, it is very likely that J regions exist also on H chains. In the following discus sion I will assume this to be the case.) The three regions of the H chains are quite different from and never inter change with the three regions of the L chains. Thus, there are six re gions- CH, JH, VH, CL, Jl, and VL. Each of the six lg regions is deter David W. Talmage received his M.D. from Washington University and was on the faculties of the Universities of Pittsburgh and Chicago before coming in 1959 to the Univer sity of Colorado Medical Center in Denver as Professor of Medicine and Microbiology. He was Chairman of Microbiology and then Dean of the Medical School before taking his present position as Director of the Webb Waring Lung Institute. In 1957 he proposed the first cell-selection theory of antibody for mation and has continued his interest in theoretical immunology while his research has focused on transplantation and cancer im munity. He is president of the American As sociation of Immunologists and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. His re search is supported in part by grants from the NI AID and the Kroc Foundation.

Diverse polypeptides that serve the same function, e.g. CH, are called isotypes if the genes which determine them are on the same chromosome. As might be expected from their name, the greatest variability and the greatest number of isotypes are in the V genes and V regions. By combining the multiple C, J, and V genes in various ways to make numerous H and L chains, and by combining the numerous H and L chains in various ways, it is possible to make millions of different lg molecules from only a few hundred to a thousand structural genes. The variability in lg genes is of two main types: that accounting for specificity in interaction with antigen, which lies in the V and J regions, and that accounting for diversity in functions, which is determined by the CH region. Each human chromosome set con tains at least nine tandem structural genes that determine nine different CH isotypes (2). The nine CH isotypes in turn determine nine kinds of lg molecules, which differ in size and in ability to bind to various cells, to fix complement, and to pass through the intestinal and placental barriers. This diversity of function is obviously of great value to the organism, but fur ther details of this type of diversity are beyond the scope of this article. Two processes, one at the DNA level and one at the RNA, account for the joining of the C, J, and V genes in a particular combination in any one cell (Fig. 2). The relatively small number of C and J genes for each type of chain are located close to each other in the DNA, with only a short gap between them, but the larger number of V genes for each chain are necessarily more distant, although still on the same chromosome. During differen tiation a translocation of DNA occurs, probably by excision of the inter vening segment, so that one of the VL genes is directly joined to one of the JL genes (3). At the same time on an other chromosome, a VH gene is thought to be joined to a JH gene. One or more CH genes may be excised (4). The stage is now set for synthesis of messenger-RNA containing one V gene, one or more J genes, a gap, and one or more C genes. What happens next is a little less certain, but the evidence strongly suggests that a piece of RNA including the gap and any extra C and J genes is cut out of the middle of the messenger and the ends spliced, leaving one C gene, one J gene, and one V gene joined to gether continuously. It seems likely that there are at least 200 V genes and 20 J genes for each chain in each chromosome set inher ited by an individual. If so, there would be 200 times 20-or 4,000-H chain antigen-binding regions and the same number for the L chain. These could be combined into 16 million antigen-binding sites, and this num ber would be greatly expanded if so matic gene mutation occurs, as seems likely, and is subject to positive se lection whenever a mutation serves to form a better-fitting binding site for some environmental antigen. In the translocation process, the de termination of which V gene ends up adjacent to a J gene appears to be random and different for each cell. The result is a diverse restriction in cell potential: in each Ig-producing cell only one VH and one VL gene are located in a position where they can be translated into a complete H or L chain. Different cells, however, are restricted to different combinations of H and L chains. In addition to the stable rearrangement of DNA, the restriction in cell potential implies that only one each of the chromo somes containing H and L genes is functional. The mechanism of this process, called allelic exclusion, is not known. Perhaps an lg gene is not op erational until after some transla tional event has taken place, and such events are relatively rare. Lymphocytes and antigens The cells with the randomly diverse restriction in potential to make Igs are lymphocytes, and form a major fraction of the white blood cells in all vertebrates. Each lymphocyte can make only one H chain and one L chain, and therefore each can make only one complete lg out of the mil lions of Igs made by the entire popu lation of lymphocytes in the same animal. This restriction in synthetic potential is quite stable and has per sisted for years in Ig-producing clones of lymphocytes grown in cell culture, and this stable diversity of lympho cytes forms the basis of immunologic memory by a process similar to nat ural selection. As postulated by Dar win, natural selection has only two preconditions: heritable diversity and selective replication. The stable but diverse restriction in cell potential provides the first of these precondi tions, and selective lymphocyte acti vation by foreign antigens, the sec ond. A special membrane-bound form of the lg to which each lymphocyte is genetically restricted is used by that lymphocyte as a highly specific re ceptor for recognizing antigen. There are two major classes of lymphocytes, distinguished by their source, their function, and the way they recognize antigen: (1) B-cells are lymphocytes that come into the blood from the bone marrow: they secrete the Igs that form the gamma globulin of blood plasma, and they recognize free antigen directly by binding it to their membrane lg receptors. (2) T-cells are lymphocytes that come into the blood from the thymus: they do not secrete lg, and they recognize antigen only in association with certain nat ural membrane proteins. A major function of one type of T-cell is to recognize and destroy virus-in fected cells. Another type produces mediators that are important to in flammatory responses and to the regulation of lymphocyte prolifera tion. I shall concentrate on the com plex recognition system of T-cells in the remaining portion of this arti cle. hinge region ' ??

Their cytoplasm is meager, and they synthesize very little RNA and pro tein. In the absence of the antigen for which they are specifically reactive, they may roam in the blood and tissues for years without once repli cating their chromosomes or dividing. In the presence of an antigen, how ever, the small fraction of lympho cytes capable of recognizing that an tigen begins to enlarge within a few hours. Production of RNA and pro tein increases and DNA synthesis begins, resulting in the secretion of antibodies or mediators and an in crease in the number of cells respon sive to the antigen. After the antigen has been neutralized and digested, the activated lymphocytes return to their former inactive state, but in larger numbers. The persistence of the increased number of long-lived lymphocytes created by this clonal expansion forms the basis of immu nological memory. The binding of antigen to receptors on the surface of the lymphocyte is the first step in the physiological process leading to selective activation of specific lymphocytes. However, antigen is neither sufficient nor re quired for activation. Several non specific substances called mitogens (e.g. phytohemagglutin and con conavalin A) are able to activate whole classes of lymphocytes. And whether lymphocytes are activated by antigen or mitogen, they require the presence of an accessory cell (5), sometimes another lymphocyte. In fact, the role of antigen or mitogen appears to be that of a bridge between the lymphocyte and the accessory cell. The result of this cell-cell inter action is the delivery of an activating signal. When the accessory cell that delivers the signal is another lymphocyte it is known as a "helper cell," and belongs to the mediator-producing class of T-cells. The stimulus that activates helper cells comes from nonlympho cyte accessory cells called macro phages, an important group of white blood cells whose most obvious function is to engulf and digest bac teria, but which also play a significant role in lymphocyte regulation. One major class of T-cells, or T-lym phocytes, when activated, can kill cells bearing the antigens for which they are specific. The mechanism of this killing is not known, but we know that cell-to-cell contact is required. The cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL), as these killer cells are called, are thought to be important in the de struction of tumors and organ grafts as well as in providing the main pro tection against virus infection. Since viruses grow exclusively inside cells, they cannot be reached by antibody during their intracellular growth phase, but fortunately, most virus infections lead to the appearance of viral antigens on the cell surface. Here they activate specific CTL, which kill the infected cells and root out the infection. In the study of the CTL specific for virus-infected mouse cells, Doherty and Zinkernagel (6) made a surpris ing observation. The CTL could kill only virus-infected cells from the same inbred strain of mice from which they were derived. Thus if strain A mice were infected with virus 1, and the spleen cells removed a week later and tested for their ability to kill normal and infected cells of several mouse strains, they could kill only strain A cells infected with virus 1. Similarly, if strain B mice were in fected with virus 2, the spleen cells could kill only strain B cells infected with virus 2. This observation indi cated that the CTL had a double specificity-for both the virus and the host cell-and led to the simulta neous proposal by two laboratories of a major new theory of T-cell recog nition called the "dual receptor theory" (7,8). According to this theory, T-cells have two kinds of receptors in close asso ciation, both of which must bind to complementary spots on another cell in order for an activating signal to pass into the T-cell or for a killing signal to pass out. One of the two re ceptors is specific for the foreign an tigen (e.g. virus) and the other is al ways specific for a protein derived from the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which provides each individual with a set of unique markers that distinguishes him from every other individual. The only ex ceptions are identical twins, members of the same inbred strain of mice or guinea pigs, and occasionally sib lings. The MHC and thymus imprinting It has been known for some time that the chromosomes of every vertebrate species contain a set of linked genes known as the major histocompatibi lity complex. Initially, the distinction between the MHC and the genes for numerous other minor histocompa tibility antigens was made on the basis of the rapidity of rejection of a skin graft. If two individual animals differed in their MHC genes, skin grafted from one to the other was promptly rejected. If they differed only at minor loci and contained identical MHC genes, skin grafts be tween them were rejected more slowly. Subsequently, other characteristics of the MHC were identified. Lympho cytes from two individual animals of the same species differing in MHC genes stimulated DNA synthesis in each other when the two populations of cells were mixed for only a few days in test-tube culture. Some of the his tocompatibility antigens or proteins determined by genes in the MHC could be identified on all the cells of the body.

The immunoglobulin (lg) chain is formed from a much greater number of genes than it ultimately contains by the steps shown in the diagram. Some details have not been explicitly demonstrated experimentally, in particular those dealing with excision of J genes. The gray areas are always excised in the next step; the colored areas are the additional genes which were excised in the particular cell illustrated. The variability in the excision of V and J genes in the differentiation step accounts for the diversity in lymphocyte specificity.

Although other proteins are determined by genes of the MHC, the only other group with which we are concerned are found only on lymphocytes and macrophages. One receptor of the helper T-cell is thought to be specific for such a pro tein. Zinkernagel has recently reported the results of a series of complex experi ments designed to determine the or igin of the dual specificity of T-cells (9). Was the failure of the killer cells, activated in one individual by a virus infection, to kill virus-infected cells of another individual due to the absence of lymphocytes specific for such tar gets or to the inability to activate them? ZinkernagePs experiments gave the surprising result that both explanations were correct. They also showed that the MHC proteins of the thymus determined what kind of in fected cells could be recognized. Hy brid mice were thymectomized and given the thymus of one parental strain. They were then x-rayed to destroy T-cells and injected with hy brid-strain bone marrow containing T-precursors but no T-cells. After two months they were infected with a virus and, six days later, spleen cells were tested for ability to kill infected targets of both parental strains. Only targets containing the MHC proteins of the thymus were killed. Generally the lymphocytes of an in dividual respond to its own infected cells, because its own cells bear the same MHC proteins as its thymus. But if a thymus from one individual is transplanted into another individ ual with different MHC proteins, the T-cells from the transplanted thymus cannot recognize virus-infected cells of the new host. An individual that receives all its T-cells from such a transplanted thymus is immunologi cally incompetent: the lymphocytes have been imprinted in the thymus to recognize viral antigens bound to the wrong MHC protein. To avoid the high mortality associ ated with this immunological in competence, Zinkernagel and col leagues modified slightly the above experiment by transplanting the thymus of an inbred mouse (A) into a thymectomized hybrid mouse (A X B). Two months after x-radiating to kill off A X B T-cells and injecting A X B bone marrow containing T-cell precursors but no mature T-cells, the mouse was infected with virus and its spleen cells tested for their ability to kill infected A and B targets. Only infected A targets were killed. Since the entire mouse including its lym phocytes and macrophages but ex cepting the radioresistant epithelium of the thymus carried A and B pro teins, the only conclusion possible from these experiments was that T cells are imprinted in the thymus to recognize foreign antigens in associ ation with the MHC protein they find in the thymus during their differen tiation there. The process of im printing in the thymus is called adaptive differentiation. As we have seen, when two individu als of the same species differ in MHC genes, grafts exchanged between them are rejected promptly-because a relatively large fraction (1 to 2 per cent) of the T-cells of each individual is capable of recognizing and reacting against the MHC antigens of another member of the same species. This surprisingly large number of cells re active to foreign MHC antigens is a paradox for two reasons. First, the fraction of lymphocytes that can re spond to most other (foreign) anti gens is, as we have said, probably less than 1 percent of that amount (1 in 10,000). And second, because of adaptive differentiation-imprint ing-there are no lymphocytes that can respond to virus-infected cells bearing foreign MHC antigens. To explain this paradox more clearly, according to the dual receptor theory, we will use two symbols, H and X: H will refer to an individual's own MHC proteins and H' to MHC antigens of others. X' will refer to all non-MHC foreign antigens, including viral and minor histocompatibility antigens, and X to an individual's own minor histocompatibility proteins. Using these symbols we may describe the paradox this way: T-cells can recog nize and respond to H + X' and H' + X but not to H' + X' or H + X. Selection in the thymus Since T-cells differentiate in the thymus, we must examine the cell flow through this organ if we are to understand how the T-cells acquire Figure 3. The author has suggested a strict dual receptor theory for recognition in the immune system. The model, diagrammed in Fig. 4, is based on these four postulates. X H postulate 3 postulate 4 or Figure 4. The strict dual receptor theory pro posed by the author postulates, first, positive selection of a small fraction of T-precursor cells recognizing H + X and then negative selection: only those cells that by gene mutation or gene translocation change one receptor can stop dividing and leave the thymus. As a result, all cells coming out of the thymus recognize either H + X' or H' + X but not H + X and only rarely H' + X \ 176 American Scientist, Volume 67</page><page sequence="5">their peculiar restriction in recogni tion ability. The thymus consists of two zones, an outer cortex and an inner medulla. The lymphocytes in the cortex are large and divide rapidly despite the absence of all foreign an tigens. The lymphocytes of the me dulla are small and inactive. Experi ments using marked and labeled cells have shown that stem cells from the bone marrow enter the thymus through the cortex, divide rapidly for one to two weeks, and, only after they have stopped dividing, either pass into the medulla or exit from the thymus. Since the rate of growth of the thy mus and the number of cells exiting into the bloodstream is too small to account for the rapid cell division in the cortex, it has been postulated that many of the cortical cells die there. We have reason to believe that both positive selection (growth) and neg ative selection (death) take place in the thymus. Is it possible that the dividing cortical cells are responding to natural anti gens-i.e. to the animal's own pro teins? If so, according to a strict dual receptor theory, this antigen must be H + X, since only self antigens are present in the thymus. I would pos tulate that only that small fraction of stem cells capable of recognizing H + X multiply when they arrive in the thymus: this would be positive selec tion. After 10 to 20 cell divisions, each such cell would have multiplied a thousand- to a millionfold, and most would be doomed to die of exhaus tion. A few cells, however, would not die, because one of the two receptors has changed, either by gene mutation or gene translocation. Several recent observations have indicated that at least one of the receptors on T-cells is identical to the receptors on B-cells specific for the same foreign antigen, which suggests that gene transloca tion, not mutation, is the major source of T-cell diversity. Whatever the cause of the change in receptors, the process by which these cells are saved from death by exhaustion would be negative selection. The changed cell no longer recognizes H + X, stops dividing, and leaves the thymus. Since the probability of both recep tors changing simultaneously is quite low, very few of these cells would recognize Hf + X'. Thus, most of the cells that stop dividing and leave the thymus recognize either H' + X or H + X' (see Figs. 3 and 4). In 1971 Jerne (10) proposed a model of diversification of antibody-forming cells that contained many of the fea tures of the model presented here for T-cells. In 1978 von Boehmer, Haas, and Jerne (ll) presented their own dual receptor model of T-cell recog nition. Numerous other explanations (12, 13) have been given for the pe culiar restrictions in T-cell recogni tion, some variations of the dual re ceptor theory and some not. The chief virtue of the version I have outlined (see Fig. 4), which was developed after many discussions with Kevin Lafferty and Robert Blanden at the Australian National University, in Canberra, is its simplicity, compared with other proposed models. Future work will reveal if it is both simple and correct. Implications for biology and medicine The natural cutting and splicing of genes, either during or after their transcription, was first demonstrated for lg genes and is now well estab lished for several different proteins and must be considered a general oc currence. Beyond that, the immune system has provided the sole dem onstration to date of translocation of DNA during cell differentiation. If this should also turn out to have general validity in other organs, as seems likely, then these findings should have great interest to em bryologists. Organ development in embryogenesis has generally been considered an or dered process of cell differentiation in response to specific inducers. These findings suggest that organog nesis may include two of the steps involved in development of the immune sys tem: (1) a random diversification of gene organization through translo cation or deletion and (2) selection of cells with the appropriate gene ar rangement to respond to a particular inducer. In order for such a model to work it is necessary only that at each stage of development the number of cells be large enough to ensure that at least one cell be present to respond to the inducer. The theoretical advan tage to such a model is that the problem of two inducers competing for the same cell is avoided. Two of the major unsolved problems in medicine today are the failure of the immune system to mount an at tack against the demonstrable anti gens of cancer cells and the difficulty in preventing the immune system from rejecting transplanted organs. The solution to both these problems will probably involve a better under standing of the regulation of T-cells, for it is the cytotoxic T-cells that are the major effectors of both tumor and transplantation immunity.
