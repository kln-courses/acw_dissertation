<plain_text><page sequence="1">Exploring Nature with Your Child. Dorothy Edwards Shuttlesworth. 448 pages. $3.95. Greystone Press. New York. 1952. As editor of Junior Natural History Magazine, published by the American Museum of Natural History, Mrs. Shuttlesworth has long been sampling the extent and character of juvenile interest in nature. Thus she is in a particularly advantageous position in writing a book that opens many fas cinating doors to nature's mansion. The title is rather limiting and not too effectively broadened by the subtitle which says: "An introduction to the enjoyment and understanding of nature for all." It would seem that this book is also valuable to the elementary school teacher, and has a place in the secondary school library for reference pur poses. Of course, it will introduce many parents to nature, fully as much as it will childrenâ€”per haps even more. Chapters cover birds; mammals; fishes; snakes, frogs and their relatives; insects and spiders ; flowers, trees ; astronomy, and weather ; and their component parts are well selected and interesting. Touches of anthropomorphism, here and there, can, no doubt, be excused since the ultimate audience is said to be from four to four teen in point of age. Richard W. Westwood Editor, Nature Magazine Washington, D. C. February 1953 Richard W. Westwood</page></plain_text>
