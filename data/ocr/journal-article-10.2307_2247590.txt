<plain_text><page sequence="1">VII.-NEW BOOKS. Florentine Painters. By BERNHARD BERENSON, author of Venetian Painters, Lorenzo Lotto. New York: Putnam, 1896. Pp. 141. I HAVE asked leave to introduce to the readers of Mind a book ap- parently destined for a very different public, because I am convinced that, instructive to studelnts and lovers of art as Mr Berenson's "Tuscan Painters" is bound to prove, its great and original suggestiveness is fully appreciable only by professed psychologists. That Mr Berenson himself is not a student of mental science, that he does not write for students thereof, and that his book shows no traces of psychological training, are circumstances which, as it seems to me, enhance rather than diminish the interest of his work in the eyes of psychologists. For we get in this volume a coincidence with some of the most significant recent psychological discoveries and hypotheses, which is convincing for the very reason that it comes, not as a result of philo- sophical speculation on the connexion between art and other mental phenomena, but in the course of an attempt, on the part of an already distinguished connoisseur and art-historian, to make others share the aesthetic emotions of which he is himself aware. The subject of aesthetics, of the how and why of the perceptive and emotional phenomena connected with art and the Beautiful, is one which has occupied my own thought for many years, and upon which, in con- sequence, I have myself arrived at a certain number of conclusions. With these conclusions the facts and theories propounded by Mr Berenson by no means tally either as whole or parts; but such differences, however considerable, are thrown into the shade by my thorough agreement with the method and the spirit which Mr Berenson has applied to aesthetic problems; so that the brief space of a review will be more profitably employed by my placing Mr Berenson's views before the readers of Mind rather than by my criticising them in the light of my own experiences and hypotheses. And first, about the rank which the aesthetic pheno- menon takes in life and life's development. Mr Berenson holds that, so far from the aesthetic phenomenon being, as we have been told, a species of accident in evolution, a sporadic activity which has survived, "like sea-sickness" says Mr W. James, without any apparent reason for survival, the aesthetic phenomenon has a very distinct raison d'gtre in the fact that it represents a direct increase of vitality, or, as Mr Berenson ex- presses it, that "art alone can give us the life-enhancing qualities of objects." This life-enhancing power of art is not however sufficiently explicable by the reasons given by contemporary aesthetics; or rather, contemporary aesthetics, not having recognised the specific properties of art, have failed</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS. 271 to explain artistic pleasure by reasons sufficiently specific to that form of pleasure: artistic pleasure, in painting (of which Mr Berenson ex, clusively treats) has been explained, for instance, by sensations in the visual apparatus, helped out by an army of ideational and emotional associations, and generally dismissed from psychological analysis as a case of the placy instinct, itself a very vague entity indeed. But Mr Berenson, basing his notion upon what he perceives as going on inside himself, offers an explanation which, without discarding any of those previously given, reduces them to mere coincident factors. The main pleasure of painting, he says, is due to the very special manner in which painting can make us realise spatial relations and movement: this special manner of realisation producing directly the sense of heightened vitality. But how can realisation of spatial relations and of movement act in any way upon a phenomenon so organic, so bodily, as the sense of vitality ? Stripped of certain complications and (as I think) contradictions, Mr Berenson's answer can be reduced to a very startling formula: "We realise objects," says Mr Berenson (p. 84), "when we perfectly translate them into terms of our own states, our own feelings." And this formula must not be understood in any metaphorical fashion. The states to which Mr Berenson alludes are bodily states, the feelings are such as are accompanied or actually produced by bodily sensations. " We watch (p. 86) those tautnesses of muscles and those stretchings and relaxings and ripplings of skin which, translated into similar strains in our own persons, make us fully realise movement." The thorough realisation by a painter of the spatial relations, of what Mr Berenson calls the tactile values of the objects represented, produces in the thoroughly appreciative observer much more than the mnere cold intellectual awarerness which has hitherto satisfied writers on cesthetics: " Our tactile imnagination is put to play immediately. Our palms and fingers accompany our eyes more quickly than in the presence of real objects, the sensations varying constantly with the various projectiolns represented, as of face, torso, knees, etc." (p. 12). Still greater is this activity of our own muscular sense where not merely spatial relations, but movement is efficiently forced on our realisation by the painter-" unless (p. 50) my retinal impressions are immediately translated into images of strain and pressure in my muscles, of resistance to my weight, of touch all over my body, it means nothing to me in terms of vivid (visual) expression." Briefly: first, all vivid visual perception is due to the conversion of ocular impressions into feelings of bodily activity; second, such bodily activity produces a sense of livin,q in those who experience it; and third, paintilng having the means of producing such a condition by processes more direct, more efficacious and more economical than those of reality, painting possesses the power of enhancing the sense of our own vitality. The painter has selected, isolated and reinforced all the characteristics which increase, without exhausting, the energy of him who perceives them. Hence we get in painting what Mr Berenson describes as a "hyperaesthesia not bought with drugs, and not paid for with cheques drawn on our vitality,"-and thanks to it we very literally " feel as if the elixir of life, not our own sluggish blood, were coursing through our veins." Such is the essence of Mr Berenson's hypothesis. The reader of his volume will find it there complicated unnecessarily and even contra- dictorily with notions of self-conscious " Wille zur Macht " of which I have ventured to strip them. The reader will also be puzzled, until he remembers that Mr Berenson is essentially a connoisseur, a professional</page><page sequence="3">272 NEW BOOKS. expert rather than an engaging aesthete, by the deliberate neglect of so important an item in aesthetics as mere "Beauty": the book will seem, even within the field purposely restricted by the author, narrow and even crotchety. But it appears to me that no person with the habit of aesthetic introspection can deny that Mr Berenson has at last applied to artistic phenomena the only method which can lead us to differentiate and study them as an important branch of psychic life. Similarly, I imagine that no student of contemporary mental science can fail to be deeply impressed by the coincidence between Mr Berenson's analogies and hypotheses and the trend of physiological psychology. As regards myself, although I cannot accept Mr Berenson's views as a sufficient explanation of the pleasure derived from painting, I am desirous to place his little book in the hands of psychologists, because it seems to show in the most con- vincing and also the most suggestive manner that aesthetics ought to become one of the most important fields for psychological observation, analysis and speculation. How significant the empirical study of aes- thetics can be Mr Berenson has already shown with an acumen and a philosophical imagination which promise great achievements therein on his own part. VERNON LEE. Thinking, Feelinq, Doing. By E. W. SCRIPTURE, Ph.D., Director of the Psychological Laboratory, Yale University. Meadville: Flood &amp; Vincent, 1895. Pp. xii., 304. From the author of the research Ueber den associativen Verlauf deer Vorstellungen, and from an unwearied advocate of the "New Psychology," we had a right to expect a text-book of no inconsiderable freshness and originality. There is but little doubt of the presence of both of these qualities in overflowing measure in the work under review: but a freshness amounting to coolness in the unacknowledged appropriation of diagrams and text, together with an originality most in evidence in a condescending jocularity of a nursery-book type, is hardly fitted to commend the volume to any well-wisher of the science of Psychology. The work bears the imprint of the Chautauqua Century Press, and is written, the author informs us in the preface, "expressly for the people." After acquainting himself with the character of the book the reviewer feels constrained to say that its ready acceptance by those to whom it is dedicated would indicate that "the people" stand more in need of the *services of a missionary than of a psychologist. It is this very effort to write a popular treatise which is the bane of the book. The effort is seen in the comparatively large amount of text and cuts devoted to the reaction-times of athletic exercises-at present of small psychological value,-in the disproportionate amount of space given to colour-blinidness, in the remarkable 'practical' suggestions (as in the colour-top device for matching dress patterns), and even in appeals to popular prejudice. Apropos of colour-blindness the author remarks: " Are we to suppose that the many Englishmen are colour-blind who can see in the Irish flag only a symbol of anarchy ?" (p. 176). This, as the politicians would say, seems to be an attempt to catch the Irish vote. As is to be expected of a popular work, the book is profusely illustrated: there are 294 illustrations for 295 pages of text. To five of the cuts the author gives prima facie evidence of ownership-for his electrotype likeness appears therein-but to some of the rest his title is not so clear. Whether a given diagram or cut may be regarded as having passed into the common stock or not is a matter of literary casuistry. It is also to be</page><page sequence="4">NEW BOOKS. 273 said that in an elementary text-book one is not called upon to ac- knowledge the source of each cut separately. But Dr Scripture has drawn from many sources beside the common stock. He has fitted out his book with diagrams and cuts from treatises, investigations, works and catalogues, and nowhere-not even in the preface-does one find any acknowledgment of -his broad indebtedness. A graver fault confronts us in the text. Dr Scripture has quoted copiously from Creighton and Titchener's translation of Wundt's MIenschen- und Thierseele; but has neglected to pay to the translators the tribute of quotation marks. Twelve pages of the thirteen making up Chapter XVII. are taken from this translation without other acknowledgment of the source than the general statement that "Wundt is to be followed for the rest of the chapter" ! And this is by no means the only case of "borrowing." As regards the plan of structure of the book, one finds that it amounts to a series of chapters connected chiefly by the binding. Chapter III. is on Reaction-time; Chapter VI. on Power and Will; Chapter XVI. on Feeling; Chapter XVIII. on Memory. The book can be read beginning with the last chapter as easily as with the first. This amorphous structure is, however, probably deliberate with the author; for he informs his readers that the "New Psychology confines itself strictly to fact." This statement is to be reconciled with the fact that the latest authoritative work on experimental psychology-Kuilpe's "Outlines" abounds in theory and hypothesis. Thinking and Doing take up twenty of the twenty-two chapters comprised in the book. Feelings come off with twelve pages, and Emotions with thirteen-twelve of these from the unacknowledged source mentioned above. Dr Scripture is especially severe upon what he calls the "arm-chair" psychologist. "For several thousand years," he writes, "psychologists have been waiting and watching: it has never occurred to them to labour also. Sitting at home in the arm-chair is very pleasant; but it is not the way to do business, and consequently psychology has been going back- ward." It is a pity that the misguided English philosophers, from Locke, Hume, and Berkeley, down to the Mills, had not been checked in their retroactive efforts by the olfactometer and the hypnotic button; and it is to be regretted that Dr Thomas Brown, who sometimes clung to his arm-chair through the entire night in writing his lectures, had not been kindly advised that it was "not the way to do business." It is to be sincerely deplored that a psychologist of Dr Scripture's ability has chosen to sacrifice his work to an attempt to come down to the popular level,-an attempt, in the reviewer's opinion, which has resulted in excavations beneath the popular level. The book itself bears evidence enough of the author's knowledge of experimental psychology and of his fertility of resource in experimental methods. But despite this, it is to be hoped that customn may never stale the variety of this particular form of the "New Psychology," and that it may ever remain unique. FRANK ANGELL. The Child and Childhood in Folk-thouqht. (The child in primitive culture.) By A. F. CHAMBERLAIN, M.A., Ph.D. New York: Macmillan &amp; Co., 1896. Pp. x., 464. This work is a sort of lexicon of 'paidology.' It is a careful and laborious compilation of all that refers to the cbild and childhood in popular thought. There are thirty-three chapters, dealing with children's food, souls, flowers, M. 18</page><page sequence="5">274 NEW BOOKS. animals, etc.,-the child as poet, linguist, actor, teacher, judge, oracle- keeper, weather-maker, healer, hero, etc., etc. Each chapter is subdivided into numerous sections. Thus that which treats of the child in the primitive laboratory has paragraphs upon licking into shape, massage, face games, primitive weighing, primitive measuremenits, measurements of limbs and body, tests of physical efficiency, sleep, and heroic treatment. Six chapters are lists of proverbs and familiar sayings about children and childhood, collected, as the author candidly remarks, from pre-existing dictionaries of quotations and proverbs. A very useful bibliography of 549 titles, and three elaborate indices close the volume. The writer's thesis is that "the child is as important to the savage... as to the civilised" man. "Everywhere through the world the activities of childhood have been appealed to, and the race has wonderfully profited by its wisdom, its naivete', its ingenuity and its touch of divinity." "Upon language, religion, society and the arts the child has had a lasting influence, both passive and active, unconscious, suggestive, creative. History, the stage, music and song have been its debtors." And the thesis is supported by a great mass of authoritative evidence. Mr Chamberlain's enthusiasm has enabled him to weld his materials together into some sort of unity; and his occasionally emotional way of presenting his facts will bring him readers, while it does not seriously affect his scientific attitude. Not the least valuable thing about the book is its suggestiveness. There is hardly a section that does not furnish a subject for detailed investigation to the anthropological psychologist. The WsNuber Concept: its origin and development. By L. L. CONANT, Ph.D. New York: Macmillan &amp; Co., 1896. Pp. vii., 218. This is a very complete study, by a mathematician, of the anthropology of number. . The faculty of counting is taken for granted. The author believes, with Kulpe, that " the primitive conception of number" is "fundamental with human thought," and so does not attempt, as Preyer has recently done, to derive it from something which is not numerical. The only legitimate objects of inquiry are "the primitive methods of counting and of giving visible expression-to the idea of number." Ch. I. discusses finger counting, and deduces certain peculiarities of the finger scale from the facts of attitude, right-handedness, etc. Ch. II. compares the limits of numerical systems in savage and civilised com- munlities. Chs. III. and IV. trace the origin of number words. We find that " all above two, three or at least four are almost universally of digital origin." A table is given of the various ways in which the primitive mind conceives of number: thus "one" is "existence, piece, group or beginninig"; "eight" is "five-three, second three, two fours, or two from ten," etc. Ch. V.-a very interesting chapter to the psychologist deals with other than the natural (finger, i.e. 5, 10 and 20) number bases. Binary and quaternary systems are not rare; ternary bases are less frequent; while "there is probably no recorded instance of a number system formed on 6, 7, 8, or 9 as a base." Traces of einumeration by such systems are discoverable in systems otherwise formed, but the author proves that they call for special and local explanation. The duodecirnal scale is "the scale of civilisation," but will never supplant the decimal in ordinary use. The two concluding chapters take up the quinary and vigesimal systems in detail. Professor Conant has been admirably careful in his use of authorities, and the Judgments which he passes upon evidence are impartial and well-balanced. His book is the most comprehensive treatment of its</page><page sequence="6">NEW BOOKS. 275 subject extant: between two and three hundred number scales are transcribed and analysed. It may be cordially recommended. Miovement. By E. J. MAREY. Translated by E. PRITCHARD. (International Scientific Series, vol. lxxiii.) New York: D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1895. Pp.- xv., 323. Psychologists, no less than physiologists, must welcome the appearance of Professor Marey's le mouvement in an English dress. Many of the methods which it describes have been, and others will be, of service to experimental psychology. To mention one only,-it is surprising that use has not been made of the zootrope, for the investigation of associative and apperceptive completion of impressions, to a far greater exteint than has actually been the case. Mr Pritchard has given us an accurate and readable translation. But he has made some regrettable departures from the original, cutting out a round dozen plates (among them, the two phototypes with which the French volume ends) and the author's index to illustrations. The number- ing of the early plates has beeni quite needlessly altered. There may be reasons for certain of these changes, though none is alleged in the preface. But the bad printing of the plates in general is inexcusable. In the writer's copy, Fig. 17 is no figure at all; and some fifteen others would be unintelligible, were their French impressions not familiar. The Psychology of Number, and its applications to methods of teaching arithmetic. -By J. A. McLELLAN and J. DEWEY. (International Education Series, vol. xxxiii.) New York: D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1895. Pp. xv., 309. This little book falls into two distinct parts, as its title indicates. The second and practical part is, so far as the lay mind can judge, exceedingly good. What is more, its polemical tone seems to argue that it is needed at the present juncture as a corrective to vicious school practice. The first part discusses the psychical nature, origin, definition, etc., of number by the method, and even in the terms, of the Hegelian dialectic. It will hardly recommend itself either to the psychologist or the mathematician as an adequate account of the number idea and the number judgment. The Beginninqs of Writing. By W. J. HOFFMAN, M.D. (Anthropological Series, No. 3.) New York: D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1895. Pp. vii., 209. There is very little psychology in this volume, which should have borne a more specific title. It is a popular account, profusely illustrated, of the forms and underlying principles of American picture-writirng. Only now and again (e.g. in the chapter on Symbols) does the psychological problem come to the front with any explicitness. At the same time the writer keeps well within the limits of established fact, and the psychological reader will find, between the lines, a good deal to interest hirm. Philosophy of Theism: being the Gifford Lectures delivered before the University of Edinburgh in 1894-95. First Series. By ALEXANDER CAMPBELL FRASER, LL.D., Hon. D.C.L. Oxford, Emneritus Professor of Logic and Metaphysics in the University of Edinburgh. Edinbargh and -London: William Blackwood &amp; Sons, 1895. Pp. 297. Professor Fraser's final chapter has for title "What is God?" This is the problem of his book. He considers in succession the solutions offered by Panmaterialism, Panegoism, and Pantheism, and concludes that none of 18-2</page><page sequence="7">276 NEW BOOKS. these can afford a satisfactory ultimate conception. If the question were purely theoretical, Agnosticism might be a tenable position. But Agnos- ticism would logically lead to universal nescience, and " the mental state in which one doubts about everything is a state in which man cannot live" (p. 278). We need a practical answer to the question, What is God ? From this point of view "the deepest and truest thought man can have about the outside world, is that in which the natural universe is conceived as the immediate manifestation of the divine or infinite Person, in moral relation to imperfect persons, who, in and through their experience of what is, are undergoing intellectual and spiritual education in really divine surround- ings" (p. 280). The Worship of the Romans, viewed in r elation to the Roman temperament. By FRANK GRANGER, D.Lit., Professor in University College, Notting- ham. London: Methuen &amp; Co., 1895. Pp. ix., 308. A well-written and useful account of the magical and religious customs and beliefs of the Romans. In the writer's view magic is more primitive than religion. The titles of the chapters are: " The Roman Spirit," " Dreams and Apparitions," " The Soul and its Companions," " The World Around," " Nature Worship," " Primitive Thought," " Roman Magic," "Divination and Prophecy," " The Primitive Idea of Holiness," "Holy Places and Idolatry," "The Divine Victim," "The Sacred Drama." The writer approaches his subject with the insight derived from a thorough knowledge of recent work on folk-lore. Stutdies in the Evolutionary Psychology of Feeling. By HIRAM M. STANLEY. London: Swan Sonnenschein &amp; Co. New York: Macmillan &amp; Co., 1895. Pp. vi., 390. This work is characterised by vigour and originality. The writer regards Feeling as the primary fact of psychical life both in the race and in the individual. Not only Cognition in general, but every cognitive state, is generated by a prior pain or pleasure. Most of the book is devoted to an analysis of the special emotions and of their development. Whatever may be thought of the writer's general theory, there is much in this part of the work which is distinctly valuable. (Fuller notice follows.) Criminal Sociology. By ENRIco FERRI. London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1895. Pp. 284. This is the second volume of the Criminology Series edited by Mr Morrison. In the preface to the present volume he calls attention to the fact that the problem of crime is again pressing its way to the front and demanding re-examination at the hands of the present generation. As evidence of the dissatisfaction which exists with regard to penal institutions in their present form, Mr Morrison calls attention to the large number of govern- ment inquiries which have recently been held respecting them. The result of these inquiries has been to sustain Professor Ferri's opinion that the criminal problem will not be solved by a resort to measures of a merely punitive and repressive character. Crime is a product of adverse individual and social conditions, and it can only be successfully dealt with by ameliorating those adverse conditions where it is possible to ameliorate. In cases where these conditions are not susceptible of amelioration, the only other effective alternative is to exclude the offender from ordinary social existence. It is unnecessary for us to review this book at greater length inasmuch as the original Italian edition has already been noticed in the pages of ilhnd. The English edition will be a boon to those who do</page><page sequence="8">NEW BOOKS. 277 not read Italiani. It is an admirable introduction to the problems of Criminology. Le Socialisme au XVIIPe siMcle. Etude sur les idees socialistes dans les ecrivains franjgais du XVIIIe siecle, avant la Revolution. Par ANDR1, LICHTENBERGER, docteur 6s lettres. Paris: Felix Alcan, 1895. Pp. 471. This volume is an interesting and comprehensive examination of the Socialist ideas current in French literature in that portion of the eighteenth century which preceded the great Revolution. In the execution of his task M. Lichtenberger, whose name reveals his origin, has exhibited a pleasing combination of German exhaustiveness and French lucidity. He has ransacked the literature of the period with admirable patience and industry, and must be complimented on the singular spirit of imparti- ality with which he sets forth the economic ideas of the writers whose works he has undertaken to analyse. In recent years Socialism has become an exceedingly vague term. In the mouths of many men it is merely another word for philanthropy, and even amongst those who use it in a more scientific sense there are con- siderable differences of opinion as to its interpretation. In order to make matters perfectly clear on this head M. Lichtenberger begins by telling his readers what he means by Socialism. With him it is not a body of doctrine which covers the whole field of collective life and effort. He regards it solely in its economic aspect as a theory which has for its object the collective ownership of property. The question therefore which he has set himself to answer is this: In what manner was the collective owner- ship of property held, and to what extent did this conception of the owner- ship of property permeate the public mind in the ninety years anterior to the Revolution ? In order to alnswer this question satisfactorily we are presented with a careful exatnination and analysis of the literature which bears upon it. This involves an exposition of the ideas of writers such as Meslier, Montesquieu, D'Argenson, Morelly, Rousseau and his disciples: the Encyclopedists and the physiocrats. Socialist ideas in a more or less definite form were not confined to writers on philosophy and economics. They had a wider audience and were popularised in romances, poems, and plays. Accordingly M. Lichtenberger discusses and interprets the nature of the relations which existed between socialism and literature. M. Lichten- berger's examination of the Socialist utterances of the eighteenth century leads him to the conclusion that Socialist principles were not as a rule enunciated with the object of revolutionising the economic basis of society. These principles were formulated and appealed to in order to procure what would now be considered very moderate reforms. The writings of Brisson de Warville and of the lnotorious Marat contain interesting examples of this method. The excessive severity of the criminal law was a subject which aroused the keenest indignation in the pre-revolutionary period. Punishments were inflicted on offenders altogether out of proportion to the gravity of the offence or the necessities of social security. Capital punishment was the penalty for petty theft and most other offences were punished with similar harshness. In order to obtain a mitigation of the punishment of offenders against property both Brisson and Marat bring forward arguments fatal to the existence of private property altogether. But these arguments were adduced merely to secure a more humane penal code and not for the purpose of effecting fundamental changes in the economic constitution of society. Of course there were writers who went further, but in all cases their ideas were of a speculative character.</page><page sequence="9">278 NEW BOOKS. In order to translate these ideas into practice economic conditions were required which did not exist in the eighteenth century. Socialism as a plan for the economic organisation of collective life has only assumed a practical shape since the rise of great industrial and commercial enterprises. It is the coming into existence of these great undertakings which has pro- duced latter day socialism. But it was the men of the eighteenth century who pointed out the way for existing socialist parties by ventilating the idea that civil equality is impossible without economic equality. To all who are interested in the evolution of political ideas and doctrines M. Lichten- berger has produced a volume for which they will be grateful. La Superstition Socialiste. Par le BARON R. GAROFALO. Paris: F6lix Alcan, 1895. Pp. 299. It must be said that M. Garofalo has written a lively, vigorous and comba- tive book, and a book exhibiting a considerable amount of controversial ability; but the effect of his polemic is to some extent destroyed by the need- less alarm with which he contemplates the Socialist movement. He tells us that his book is directed against revolutionary Socialism, but revolutionary Socialism, or for that matter Socialism of any serious kind, is not a theory of the State which need discompose the equanimity of sensible men. Garofalo's fear of socialism arises largely from his detestation of the mob. Of all Latin sayings the one he loves best is " Odi profanum vulgus," "I detest the mob," he says, "in every shape and form. The applause of the ignorant does not give me the slightest satisfaction; their hootings are equally a matter of indifference. That is, perhaps, one of the reasons why I have never become a candidate for public offices, not even for the position of a Municipal Councillor. Instinct may play a part in this sentiment of repugnance, but reason justifies it too. I am persuaded that everything which proceeds from the mob is always bad. It can destroy, but it is incapable of constructing. I believe that no one can do a more detestable thing than to disseminate among the poorer classes the idea that they have been dispossessed and that they have a right to take their revenge. I clearly perceive that the ill will excited among one section of the popula- tion against the other can produce no other result than a cooling down of the sentiment of cordiality and solidarity which constitute the foundations of human Society." Garofalo is evidently afraid lest the mob should become the instrument of agitators bent on the destruction of private property as a social institu- tion. There is really little cause for alarm on this score. Of all sections of the community the masses are the most conservative. No doubt the masses have at times participated in revolutionary episodes. But these episodes must not be accepted as an expression of the settled and habitual temper of the popular mind. On the contrary they are very exceptional incidents. It is quite a mistake to infer fromr these exceptional outbursts that the masses are always in a mood for violent and fundamental social transformations. As a matter of fact the habitual temper of the masses is to hold on with an unreasoning tenacity to the habits, customs, traditions, prejudices and institutions of the past. The lower down we go in the scale of civilization the greater is social immobility. This is a truth which we should be justified in describing as a Socio- logical law. This law is applicable to the various grades of Society, and it may be said with a near approach to accuracy that the lower down we descend in the social scale the greater is the aversion to change. The advent of the democracy to supreme power so far from producing revolu- tion is much more likely to produce stagnation. It is, in fact, probable</page><page sequence="10">NEW BOOKS. 279 that those countries which are most completely under the dominance of the masses may eventually lose their place in the international struggle for existence owing to the extreme unwillingness of the electorate to adjust their laws and institutions to the new conditions which are always de- veloping in the family of nations. De la Contingence des Lois de la Nature. Par EMILE BOUTROUX, Professeur i la Faculte des Lettres de Paris. Paris: Felix Alcan, 1895. Pp. 170. This essay is a reprint of the thesis presented by the author for the doctor's degree at the Sorbonne in 1874. Its main object is to demonstrate the exist- ence of a radical contingency in nature in order to make room for free will. Indeed so strongly does M. Boutroux insist on contingency that at times he is led into a position dangerously like Hume's. Thus he asserts that causality, i.e. an invariable connexion between events, is only contingent and not lnecessary. The author begins with a discussion of necessity, and finds that Logic and Mathematics give us the perfect type of it. But this is just because they are abstract sciences and do not deal with reality in the concrete. The laws of Logic have little to do with the inner nature of things. If we turn, on the other hand, to the actual world, we find contingency every- where. Being actually given is not a necessary consequent from the possible. Its existence is contingent. Again, reasoning a posterioqi and a priori proves a radical contingency in the natural production of genera and species such as we find Biology dealing with. There are no " kinds," the denota- tion and connotation of which are exactly determinate and unchangeable. In a similar way M. Boutroux proceeds to point out how, as we ascend the scale of being, new elements are constantly met with which cannot be logically deduced from what we may have previously found existing. Thus life cannot be explained on mechanical principles, and consciousness cannot be deduced from physical and physiological laws. Having thus cleared the ground, M. Boutroux is in a position to intro- duce free will. His con)clusion is that each being, animate or inanimate, is gifted with a spontaneity to realise the ideal of which it is capable. That ideal is to become as like God, the First and Final Cause of all things, as the nature of the creature permits of it. It is given to man to app-roximate to this perfection in a greater degree than the other animals, and so he is gifted with a greater freedom. " L'homme est l'auteur de son caractere et de sa destinee" (p. 145). This constant striving after an ideal is the essence of things. The laws of nature are the artificial and fixed image of what is living and changeable in its very essence. Their apparent necessity is explained by the stability inherent in the ideal itself. So necessity becomes the mean term between the world and God. The essay as a whole is brightly written. W. F. TROTTER. Histoire de la Philosophie Atomistique. Par L]OPOLD MABILILEAU. Paris: Felix Alcan, 1895. Pp. vii., 560. M. Mabilleau;s task is a twofold one. He attempts, in the first place, to write the history of Atomism, and, in the second, to form an estimate of its value as a scientific and metaphysical hypothesis. His opinion on the second question is that of a decided adherent of the Atomist school. Atomism is for him at once the most satisfactory of scientific working hypotheses, and the metaphysical doctrine which lends itself most easily to the support of a theistic and spiritualistic conception of the universe. " The corpuscular philosophy," he says, quoting Voltaire, " is the shortest</page><page sequence="11">280 NEW BOOKS. path to the discovery of the soul and of God." From the historical point of view M. Mabilleau's undertaking is perhaps more ambitious than fortunate. He begins his review of the various atomistic systems of antiquity with a survey of "Atomism among the Hindus," devoted mainly to an account of the system of Kanada which he assigns, in spite of the suspicious analogies with Aristotelian technical terminology, to a period "several centuries" earlier than the era of Leucippus and Democritus. The account of Kanada is followed by a sketch of Greek atomism, which M. Mabilleau, in opposition to the established views on the subject, regards as having been largely influenced, to say the least, by Hindu speculation. Unfortunately for M. Mabilleau the force of his argument is greatly weakened, if not altogether destroyed, by his readiness to rely on the worthless statements of Neo-Pythagorean authors of the type of lamblichus, whose judgment, not to say their veracity, is hardly above suspicion. A chapter on "Atomism among the Arabs" serves as the connecting link between Greek and modern speculation on the subject. We are then conducted through the theories of the alchemists and the "theological" atomism of the eighteenth century, to the "scientific" atomism of the present day. (Fuller notice follows.) A. E. T. Le RIa4isme Me'taphysique. Par EMILE THOUVEREZ, Professeur agreg6 de philosophie, Docteur es lettres. Paris: Felix Alcan, 1894. Pp. 282. M. Thouverez holds with Hegel that the rational is the real. The cate- gories of human knowledge are, according to him, not merely subjective forms; they constitute the nature of the real, and have their source in the nature of the absolute creative activity. This doctrine is what M. Thouverez means by metaphysical realism. Perhaps the chief interest of his book lies in the view which he takes of the interconnexion of the categories. He arranges them in an ascending series, according as they express more and more profoundly the nature of reality. Each higher category presupposes the lower as its necessary condition: but at the same time contains something essentially new. The lower is related to the higher as matter to form, in the Aristotelian use of these terms. The coincidence with Aristotelian doctrine is emphasised by the teleological language used: the lower categories are constantly spoken of as existing for the sake of the higher. The principles of Identity and Sufficient Reason, Deduction, Induction, Analogy, Faith, Number, Space, Time, Substance, Cause, End, Duty, and God, form the main topics discussed. There is much that is suggestive and helpful in the detailed treatment of these conceptions. Der Karnpf urm einen geistiqen Lebensinhalt. Neue Grundlegung einer Welt- anschauung. Von RUDOLF EUCKEN, Professor in Jena. London: Williams &amp; Norgate, 1895. Pp. 400. This work, the author tells us in his preface, is intended to be an uncom- promising polemic against the Naturalism of the present age, the object being to establish from a new point of view the reality of an order of Being independent of, and superior to, the Universe of sense-perception. Professor Eucken complains that the idea of a mode of existence not amenable to sense-consciousness has become almost an obsolete tradition. To rehabilitate this geistigen Substanz, as he terms it, in the realm of contemporary culture, is the design of the present Essay. The entire work is divided into two main divisions, the first designated the Ascent, or Auf- steigender Teil; the second the Descent, or Absteigender Teil.</page><page sequence="12">NEW BOOKS. 281 It is not very easy to make clear to an English reader the exact position assumed by Professor Eucken, but perhaps he may be best described as a Metaphysical Anarchist. He will not be bound by the speculations of philosophy, nor the dogmnas of science. He neither believes in a noumenal nor a phenomenal Universe. He trusts neither the averments of sense nor the categories of the understanding. But even an Anarchist nmust take his stand somewhere, so on page 6 we find the learned Professor condescending to an axiom which is sufficiently comprehensive, if not very intelligible to any but Hegelian students. As far as we can make out, however, from this initial pronouncement it would seem that the one real substance of the Universe is a spiritual entity, the soul of the age, embodying eternal truth, and constituting a timeless reality. This spiritual substance, this increasing purpose that through all ages runs, we are familiar with as the Zeitgeist of the poets, and it might be construed without much violence into the goal of evolution, the immovable outcome of the cosmic process. On page 16, Professor Eucken tells us that the main contention, the Hautptproblern of the present treatise, is to establish the activity, spontaneity and eternally expanding development of the individual soul. These are the character- istics of the only reality that can be grasped by the human intellect. Autonomy is the criterion of reality. The Idealist Metaphysic has here certainly an advantage over the Materialist inasmuch as the former rests on the positive conception of reality, while the latter is content with a mere negative abstraction termed the unknowable. Professor Eucken seizes upon this dialectic weakness in the scientists' theory of Being. There is no Autonomy in Nature, therefore there is no reality in Nature. Just so, admit the scientists, but then we seek our reality in a realm transcending Nature. But, replies the Idealist, our conception of Nature is that of a spiritual process, the very principle of which is that self-initiating Auto- nomy which is not to be found in the phenomenal Universe. At page 31, Professor Eucken contrasts the substance of spiritual life with that of physical life. Spiritual Being is a series of consciously self-initiated im- pulses, whereas the life of the Materialist is the evolution of a surd fatalist potentiality enchaining the succession of phenomena in a rigid order of development. In spiritual life there is no potentiality, no necessary se- quence; the child is not the father of the man, as the oak is in the acorn. The considerations opened up by the conception of a spiritual as opposed to a physical mode of existence have, as Professor Eucken shows, something more than an academic interest. The question of the possibility of moral amelioration in a human being is every day discussed amongst philanthrop- ists, and reduced to practical experiment by enthusiastic reformers. With the spiritualists the life of the individual is undergoing perpetual renova- tion (p. 32), so that there is always a possibility of making a fresh start. At page 213, Professor Eucken marshals the empirical evidence, in support of the reality of a power in Nature, transcending and dominating Nature; such a power is a spiritual energy quite apart from any mechanical or physical force. The triumphs of Art in the subjugation of nature are proofs that the human intellect is informed by a faculty, able to enslave and control the brute properties of matter; and while these properties are constant in the mode and extent of their operations the power of human knowledge is perpetually increasing and modifying our conceptions of natural processes. Again, the records of history attest the reality of a hyperphysical mode of being. There is a universe of ideas determiniing the course of human affairs, from generation to generation, issuing in the progress of culture and the evolution of social types. A struggle for exis- tence is perpetually being waged between the immanent forces of nature and the plastic powers of the geistigen Lebensinhalt. It is true that in this</page><page sequence="13">282 NEW BOOKS. conflict the spiritual side is not always triumphant, and it is to a con- sideration of this aspect of existence that Professor Eucken addresses him- self on page 245. Space is then devoted to a criticisrn of the Optimistic and Pessimistic views of this great problem,- the mixed character of human life. Professor Eucken is not inclined to accept any of the current solu- tions of the enigma, but counsels philosophers to look for a higher synthesis (p. 267). The very fact of the ever present Kampf in the realm of nature Pro- fessor Eucken takes to be a warrant for the reality of a spiritual mode of existence where intellectual and moral antinomies will alike be reconciled. The second part of the work is an application of the theory of Being, propounded in the first part, to the practical requirements of human exis- tence such as Religion, Ethic, Art, Philosophy. There is much elevating and stimulating suggestion in Professor Eucken'&amp; Essay, but his mode of exposition is somewhat too comminuted and prolix. T. W. LEVIN. Die Spiele der Thiere. By KARL GROOS. Jena: G. Fischer, 1896. Pp. xvi., 359. In this -book the author seeks to prove that the play of animals is due to an instinct developed by natural selection, and useful in practising those movements which are of service in the struggle for existence. Herbert Spencer's view that play depends on superfluity of energy is regarded as insufficient; superfluous energy being a favourable but not an essential condition. Imitation, which Spencer gave as a secondary cause of play, is shown in many instances to be out of the question, and is regarded by the author as due to an instinct allied to the play instinct. A full and inter- esting history is given of the opinions which have been held on the nature of instinct, and the author concludes by agreeing with Ziegler, whose theory resembles that of Spencer in regarding instinct as complex reflex action depending on inherited nervous arrangements, without however accepting with Spencer the inheritance of acquired characteristics. The various forms which the play of animals, and especially of young animals, may take, are very fully described, with an abundance of illustrative examples drawn to a large extent from the work of those who have observed animals in a wild condition. The first and simplest kind of play is called " experi- menting" and includes all those movements by which the young animal obtains command over its own movements and over external objects; other kinds of play include hunting, fighting, building, nursing, etc., while the performances of courtship are treated in a separate chapter, dis- tinguished as they are from the other forms, in that they have a direct purpose. Much space is devoted to the psychological aspect of play. The play of young animals is held to be purely instinctive, the only psychical accompaniment being the pleasure attending the satisfaction of an instinct. In the higher animals the author believes that there is often consciousness of sham-occupation, giving in support of this view instances of dissimulation in animals. In the various grades of the consciousness he sees divided states of mind analogous to those occurring in the hypnotic and allied conditions. When considering curiosity in animals the author advances the view that the primitive form of attention is not concentra- tion on an impression actually present, but the expectation of a future impression associated with preparation for the instinctive movements which the expected impression will call forth; a watching cat is given as a typical example. (Does not an expected impression imply a conscious-</page><page sequence="14">NEW BOOKS. 283 ness of the nature of the impression which in its turn involves previous attentive perception?) In his preface the author complains that most of those who have written on animal psychology have too much sought out human characteristics. His own aim has been rather to study those features which are especially characteristic of the animal, and his work shows a marked freedom from the anthropomorphism which vitiates so much work on the animal mind. A second book is promised which will deal with the subject of human play. Die Umnwdlzung der Wahrnehmungshypothesen durch die mechanische Methode. Nebst einem Beitrag iiber die Grenzen der physiologischen Psychologie. Von Dr HERMANN SCHWARZ. Leipzig: Duncker &amp; Humblot, 1895. Pp. xx., 195 (Erster Teil: das Problemn des unmittel- baren Erkennens), 213 (Zweiter Teil: das Problemn des Sinnesquali- tdten, &amp; Anhang). Dr Schwarz has set himself the task of combating the prevailing tendency to regard the secondary qualities as subjective affection objectified. In an earlier work he directly attacked this current fallacy, as he rightly deems it. In the present volume he resumes the same topic from an historical point of view and gives a most interesting account of the phases through which the problem of sense-perception passed in the transition from scholasticism to the modern mechanical view of the material world. Suarez, Thomas Aquinas, and Gabriel Biels are selected as typical representatives of the scholastic point of view. Dr Schwarz, while exhibiting clearly the difficul- ties of the doctrine of "species" mediating between the object and the mind, points out that the schoolmen were in the main free from a confusion which has had a disastrous influence on more modern theories. They did not interpose between the object and the mind a second vicarious object, as those do who hold that we know in the first instance only our own subjective states. Suarez, for instance, insists that we perceive "non speciem sed per speciem." Descartes and Hobbes are taken as repre- sentative of the revolution in the theory of sense-perception which the mechanical view of nature produced. The influence of the old doctrine of species on Descartes is well brought out. In some points however we question the writer's interpretation of the Cartesian position. It is clear to us that Descartes held the secondary qualities to be in their own nature purely modes of consciousness. When we conceive them distinctly we can according to him conceive them only in this way, and not as being in any manner or degree modes of extension. Dr Schwarz says that for, Descartes they were qualities of the complex formed by the union of soul and body. The appendix on the limits of Physiological Psychology contends that the distinctions possible from a physiological poinit of view cannot keep pace with the number and subtlety of the different modalities of conscious- ness. The argument appears to us quite uncorivincing. Le Dottrine Filosofico-Religiose di Tommaso Carnppanella. By Dr GIo. SANTE FELICI. Lanciano; 1895, (London: Williams and Norgate). PP. xxxii., 285. Campanella comes last in the brilliant series of Italian Renaissance philosophers begun by Marsilio Ficino and continued by Pomponazzi, Telesio, and Giordano Bruno, who attempted, but with less success, to do for ancient thought what the Italian Humanists did for classic literature, and the Italian artists for the classic ideals of visible beauty. They form</page><page sequence="15">284 NEW BOOKS. not so much a piogressive line as a curve returning on itself. Dr Felici, without exactly intending it, shows us his hero in complete reaction towards the Aristotelian and medieval point of view from which Ficino had broken away. This was due partly to the spontaneous movement of speculation, partly to the circumstances of an unhappy life (1568-1639). A born Neapolitan like most Italian philosophers, Campanella entered the Dominican order in his youth, was accused of conspiring against the Spanish government and thrown into prison, where he spent the twenty- seven best years of his life, in the course of which he underwent the torture seven times. It was in these untoward circumstances that most of his works were written, with the fear of the Inquisition no less than of the foreign tyrants before his eyes. A natural vein of religious mysticism not unmingled with charlatanismn was intensified by long seclusion from the world, by bodily suffering, by hope deferred. To conciliate his judges and to procure the intercession of the Pope he made concessions to authority which ended by being half-sincere. When at last set free and provided with an asylum in France the bent of his mind was irrevocably determined in a direction widely diverging from that of modern civilisation. The philosophy of the Italian Renaissance never transcended the limitations or added to the categories of Greek thought; but those limits included the whole field of naturalism, and those categories were so numerous that an appearance of originality might be produced by shuffling them into new combinations. When the Florentine Academy had tempo- rarily broken the yoke of Aristotle not only Plato but the earlier and later physical systems began to be studied afresh and were powerfully aided by the Copernican astronomy. In time Aristotle reasserted his authority, but he was now read with other eyes and found to be on one side of his activity the father of systematised observation, and of inductive science. On the other side as a metaphysician he was a chief factor in Neo-Platonism, the religious mysticism of which blended easily with the great spiritual move- ment provoked by the Reformation. All these elements met and mingled in Campanella, but with an increasing preponderaiice of those which made for theological iinterests. In him, as Dr Felici well observes, is repeated the general movement of Italian Renaissance thought. First he is attracted by the study of nature, then by the study of Mind. Psychology replaces physics (p. 45). As might be expected, Aristotle, whom he had so passionately assailed, now becomes his guide. He adopts the famous distinction between soul and reason or nous, using the latter as an organ for the apprehension of religious truth. Religion is in fact the tendency of the mind to expand itself to infinity (p. 138). Think away all the limitations of Mind and you arrive at an infinite substance which is God. As the universal principle this substance is Power; as conscious of itself it is Wisdomn; as self-delighted it is Love. Here we have the celebrated " Primalities" of Campanella- and with them we find ourselves back in medievalism. Creation is not so much out of nothing as a combination of the supreme principle with nothing--a subjection of the Infinite to a series of restrictions and negations constituting a descending chain of partial existences from the throne of God to the verge of nonentity. What chiefly differentiates Campanella from the Neo-Platonists seems to be his substitution of the Infinite for the One, a process due, I think, to the revived Epicureanism of the Renaissance, such as we can study best in Giordano Bruno. Whether he was really more orthodox than his martyred predecessor may be doubted. Dr Felici institutes an elaborate and instructive comparison between the two Dominicans going to prove that Bruno valued the popular religion as very useful for the morals of the uneducated classes although untrue in</page><page sequence="16">NEW BOOKS. 285 itself, while Campanella interpreted its dogmas as a historical manifestation of metaphysical truth, and therefore themselves a part of the great cosmic process, the self-evolution of the Infinite in nature and man (pp. 210-216). According to his critic Campanella " pantheizes," but is not simply pantheistic, believing as he does in a deity which though immanent in nature also transcends it. Whether this deity is or is not personal seems left undetermined. In no case is his religion supernatural in the sense of being miraculously revealed, and his exclusion of every specifically Christian dogma is complete. "What need of a 'new creature' if human nature tends by virtue of an inborn and necessary inclination towards the highest good?" (p. 145). Campanella in his Atheismus Triumphatus declares that " the chief merit of Jesus Christ consisted in preaching the simplest form of natural religion to men and aiding them to conform to it. His death had no higher value than that of a luminous example 'moriendi pro ratione"' (p. 221). But natural religion is as we have seen merely the tendency of the mind to expand itself to infinity, which again is the supreme form of that self-preservation which our philosopher borrows from Stoicism as the definition of virtue (p. 134). Like the Stoics also-a derivation which Dr Felici does not notice-- Campanella looked forward to the eventual union of all mankind in one fold under one shepherd; but, strange as it may seem, his fold was the Roman Catholic Church and his shepherd was the Pope. Like the ancient thinkers he regarded history as a series of recurrinig cycles, and Dr Felici has shown that to credit him with anticipating the modern idea of perpetual progress is a mistake (p. 170). But the sweep of the cycles was to go on expanding until the whole globe was redaced under the sway of a single theocratic despotism. The great discoveries and inventions of modern times had no other value or meaning in his eyes than as steps towards this consummation, which remained his ideal through life, the only change being that in his youth he looked on Spain, and in his later years on France, as the predestined instrument for its accomplishment. His illusions about the desirability and feasibility of establishing papal supremacy over the secular monarchies are worthy of the thirteenth century, and remain totally unaffected by the Reformation. Protestantism he would have suppressed by any means however violent or fraudulent, and we are told that his unscrupulousness in this respect leaves Machiavelli far behind (p. 238). Thus the last thinker of the Italian Renaissance exhibits with extra- ordinary clearness the pervading note of Italian thought, the dream of universal empire, that legacy from old Rome which has been the inspiration of so many great Italians, from Dante to Vico, from Rienzi to Buonaparte, from Gregory VII. to Leo XIII.
