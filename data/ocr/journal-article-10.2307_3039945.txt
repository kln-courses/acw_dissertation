<plain_text><page sequence="1">Guy Lefevre de La Boderie's La Galliade and Renaissance Syncretism Posterity has not been totally unjust in ignoring Guy Lefevre de La Boderie, poet, translator, historian; a man of encyclopedic mind but of limited talent. Yet a closer analysis of some of his work may help us understand more clearly the complexity of French thought toward the end of the Renaissance. Marcel Raymond not without cause considers the poetry of this disciple, first of the Rhetoriqueurs, later of the Pleiade " une tentative manquee." I Certainly his Recueil de Vers, published with L'En- cycltie des secrets de l'eternite (Anvers: Plantin, 1570), the Divers meslanges poetiques (Paris: R. Le Mangnier, 1582) and the Hymnes ecclesiastiques (Paris: R. Le Mangnier, 1578 and 1582), which stand at midpoint between Ronsard's Hymnes and Du Bartas' Semaine, "Marcel Raymond, L'Inftuence de Ronsard sur la poe8ie frangaise (1550- 1585), 2 vols. (Paris: Champion, 1927), ii, 278. VOL. LXXVI, December 1961 735</page><page sequence="2">represent astheticaIly a rather feeble effort to counteract the Protes- tant translations of the Psalms by Clement Marot and Theodore de Beze. Of greater interest to both the literary scholar as well as the his- torian of ideas are his historical works. In his searching article on " The Prisca Theologia in France," 2 D. P. Walker refers to the strong influence on Guy Lefevre of Ficinian Platonism, the Hermetica and Orphica, as well as to the fundamental orthodoxy and the strong nationalism which underline his attitude to faith and country. " These conflicting elements, Walker concludes, typical of many of his con- temporaries but in a more extreme, intransigeant form, produce this strictly limited version of the doctrine of truth-veiling: the Orphica, the Hermetica, Plato and all Druidic practices, may be interpreted so that they conform with Christianity but all other pagan religions, myths, legends are rigorously outlawed." 3 Obviously indicative of this prolific translator's interest in the Florentine Academy and its ideas are his translations of Ficino's De la Religion Chrestienne . . . pour la radresse de plusieurs devoyez (Paris: G. BeYs, 1578), or the Discours de l'honneste amour / sur le Banquet de Platon: / par Marsile Ficin . . . (Paris: I. Mac6, 1578). Moreover, his syncretistic striving is foreshadowed in the prefaces which stress the pagan anticipation of Christian thought and, for example, in a dedicatory sonnet, to the duke of Alencon, of his pseudo- history La Galliade, ou de la revolution des arts et sciences (Paris: G. Chaudie-re, 1578; iv) which traces the transmission of divine knowl- edge to France through the intermediary of Moses, Hermes Tris- megistus, Athens and Saint Denis.4 Other prefatory sonnets of La Galliade, especially numbers 1, 6 and 8, indicate that the author sees France as the heir to the Assyrian, Chaldaic, Egyptian, Hebrew, Persian, Greek and Roman traditions, in that order. This, in itself, would hardly distinguish Lefevre's thought from that of many of his contemporaries. What raises him above the Joutrnal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, xvrr (1954), 227-228, and n. 9. s Ibid., pp. 227-228. 4Walker reproduces the sonnet on p. 220 of his article. Lefevre's belief in its importance may be adduced by the fact that he also included it the same year, 1578, on page 439v of his translation of Ficino's De la Religion Chres- tienne. . . . Significantly, its title is given as " Sonnet de la Descendence ... des doctrines screttes &amp; plus sublimes." 736 Modern Language Notes</page><page sequence="3">average is his strong awareness of the chaos of his period as well as the attempt to reconcile divergent views into a harmonious vision. As in most of his work, La Galliade S serves a two-fold purpose: 1-to counteract the effect of 'heretics' since "La rage &amp; cruaute en nostre Gaule esprise / A, presque en- tous endroits, saccage chaque Eglise" (sonnet # 9, p. iv) and 2-to present the 'true' picture of human progress. The work is divided into five parts or "cercles," reminiscent of Dante. The first deals with Noah and the fate of his descendants; each mentioned with the appropriate sign of the Zodiac. The second treats of architecture. The third tells of the Druids, natural and black magic as well as astrology. The fourth describes the nature and development of music and harmony. The last portion speaks of poetry and divine fury. A closer analysis of these sections will show the particular nature of his rather personal syncretism. PART I: Here Guy Lefevre first attributes to God the origin of all knowledge. His God is the neo-platonic or Hermetic vision: C'est le rond infini que nous appellons Dieu, Dont le centre est par tout, &amp; la circonference N'est comprise de nul, fors de sa propre essence (p. ir). 6 This section is followed by the traditional fanciful pseudo-historical origins of France from Noah and his numerous and prolific descend- ants. Next comes a cabalistic elaboration (pp. 1Ov f.) on the sig- nificance of numbers. The author then pays hommage to Italian contributions to knowledge and, in a most interesting manner, con- fuses centuries and schools of thought. Thus we read of: All page references to or quotations from La Galliade will be from the 1578 edition, Paris, G. Chaudiere. 6 In a sonnet to the editor, Chrestofle Plantin, of L'Encyclie des secrets de l'eternite (Anvers: Plantin, 1570), p. 213, Lefevre acknowledges his debt to Hermes Trismegistus, writing: Mercure Troisfois-grand dit k bon droit que Dieu Est un Cercle infini, qui sur la forme ronde A voulu patronner le Modelle du Monde, Mais son tour n'est point clos, son centre est en tout lieu. Cf. also pp. 103r-v for a similar passage. For a study of the theme of the infinite sphere or circle cf. Dietrich Mahnke, UJnendliche Sphdre und Allmittel- punkt (HIalle, Saale: M. Niemeyer, 1937) and Georges Poulet, Le&amp; m6ta- morphoses du cercle (Paris: Plon, 1961), among others. VOL.

It is somewhat surprising to find mention of Boccaccio and Savonarola in the same breath-or verse. Next Lefevre turns his attention to Greece (p. 24r), especially Socrates; however, in true nationalistic spirit he concludes that Noah's descendants, "nos vieux Gaulois, non les Egiptiens, / De la Mathe- matique, &amp; des arts anciens / Sont premiers inventeurs" (p. 27v), granting, none the less, that magic was transmitted from Zoroaster to Abraham to Egypt and finally to Europe. With an enthusiasm reminiscent of the spirit of the early sixteenth century, he next salutes the " Esprits &amp; clairs &amp; diuins flambeaux, / Qui auez . . . chasse de la France / Le monstre tenebreux de l'aueugle Ignorance " (p. 31v). The very comprehensive list of names that follows contains Lefevre d'fRtaples, " du sgauoir Gaulois premier res- taurateur," Guillaume Bude who brought back to France " &amp; l'Italie et la Grece," also Erasmus, DanZes, Amiot, L. de Baif, and Pierre de La Ramee. It is certainly an impressive array of poets and scholars, but one not always easily reconciled, philosophically or theologically, with orthodox thought. PART II:- The second part deals with architecture. Largely inspired by Vitru- vius, Guy Lefevre nonetheless attributes a French origin to this art as well. This portion contains little of relevance to our discussion. PART III:- This "cercle" deals mainly with the Druids and their customs. According to the author they possessed all knowledge:-of Grammar, Rhetoric, Logic, etc. as well as of "Les mysteres profonds, &amp; leur Theologie / En Nature fondee auecques la Magie " (p. 42v). Stressing the importance of truth-veiling throughout human history, from Adam to the Renaissance through the agency, among others, of Moses, Joshua, the Sanhedrin, the Prophets, Toth, iermes Trismegistus, Orpheus, Zoroaster, Plato, Christ, the Saints, etc. (pp. 48v-49r), he 738 Modern Language Notes</page><page sequence="5">offers the aristocratic justification in the reference to the Druid's prac- tice of not recording any of their wisdom "par prudence discrete, / Tant pour ne reueler leur science secrete / Au peuple profan . .. (p. 48r). In true and traditional Hermetic fashion " Thoyt Heros le Troisfoisgrand Mercure / Sa doctrin-e enseignoit fort profonde &amp; obscure / Aux vieux Egiptiens: " (p. 48v). Like Cornelius Agrippa he approves of natural (p. 44v) as opposed to black magic (p. 56r), though he does reveal perhaps an unusual amount of interest in the latter. Strangely, however, he does not totally condemn human sacrifice since, in his personal orthodoxy, this Druidic practice might have speeded salvation. There can be, after all, no resurrection without death (p. 51v). Carrying his syncretism yet one step further, Lefevre refers to the book of Zohar and the seven raptures of the soul (pp. 59v ff.), stressing particularly the seventh as hymn-singing " en rauissement" (p. 62v). It can be seen, therefore, that the spiritual or non-rational prevails in his philosophy. Leaving the ethereal, he goes on to praise Lyons and Marseilles (pp. 69v ff.), the Carolingian Renaissance (pp. 72v If.) and he returns to orthodoxy in his praise of France's saints. PART IV:- The fourth circle deals with music and harmony of song and of the world. Again the national spirit recurs in his attribution of the origins of music to Bardus, son of Drius, king of Gaul. Guy Lefevre's inter- pretation of the aim of music is quite Platonic. Music's function is to imitate "les celestes accords" (p. 83v), thereby becoming a song praising the glory of God. This naturally leads to a discussion of the role of man in this world as well as the nature of the human soul. Although he follows the traditional anthropomorphic pattern in the former, his denial of the death of the soul is neo-platonic. Referring directly to the Hermeticac, he writes: Voy Trismegiste au Pimadre: Car le nom de la Mort est un nom vain du tout, Et ce qu'on voit dissouldre, en cela se dissoult Dont il est compos4: quand il faut qu'un corps meure, Cela qui est terrestre, i la terre demeure, VOL.

Lefevre concludes the portion with a Hermes-prayer (pp. 104v- 105v) from the Asclepius, XIII.7 PART V:- In a passage dealing with the theme of the Lost Paradise, Lefevre mourns the noble primitive state lost with the advent of civilization (pp. 107vff.). It was a period when "les Egiptiens, Grecs &amp; Rom- mains nouices / N'auoient encor donne des Deitez aux vices" (p. 108r). The devils created the false gods. However, with the help of the twin-sisters Poetry and Music, whose laws were invented by Bardus, fifth king of Gaul (pp. 108v-109v), man was shown the proper direc- tion. Poetry and Music collaborated to "faire rauir par ces fureurs diuines / Qui desrobent nostre Ame, &amp; luy font voir au sein / Des hautes Deitez meint sublime dessein " (p. 109v). The author mentions the inspirational singing of Moses, Joshua, David, and the various prophets. Next he pays hommage to Hermes Trismegistus, " Celuy que Grece a feint le fils de Calliope, / Alla voir le terroir que le Nil va noyant / Et les champs arrousez du Iourdain ondoyant " (p. 112v). There he learned the secrets of music and of heaven, " Les causes de Nature, &amp; les sacrez mysteres / Des Puissances &amp; Dieu, &amp; des Demons contraires " (p. 112v). Disciples of Toth, Moses and Zoroaster taught him their secrets which he, the recipient of God's hidden wisdom, " Les traitant par-apres en poetiques nom- bres / Les peignit &amp; voila de nuages &amp; d'ombres " (p. 113r). Poetry next came to Greece where it found maximal expression in the work of Homer, Hesiod, Anacreon, Sappho, Euripides, Sophocles, Aristophanes, Theocritus, etc. (pp. ii7r ff.). The two sisters then went on to Rome where, however, " La Musique . . . n'eut pas tant d'amoureux / Comme entre les Gregeois, gent molle &amp; eneruee, / Qui sa pudicite luy auoit deprauee " (p. 121r). Rome passed on her wisdom to the Goths who, careless guardians, were followed by the great Dante, Petrarch, Sannazaro, Bembo, Are- tino, and Ariosto (pp. 121v f.). " It may be found in vol. II, pp. 207-8, of the A. D. Nock-A.-J. Festugi6re edition of the Corpus hermeticum (Paris, 1945). 740 Modern Language Yotes</page><page sequence="7">Finally, with the Renaissance, the arts " reuindrent en France " (p. 123r), largely through the efforts of king Francis, Marot, Saint-Gelays, HEero6t, the Pleiiade and their successors. It is evident that Guy Lefevre de La Boderie strives, in La Galliade as in his other work, primarily to defend the traditional faith of France. In this the careful reader may perceive an underlying effort to defend faith, all faith generally, against what he considers atheism. This interest becomes evident quite early in his career; as he himself states in the Preface to L'Encyclie des secrets de l'eternite (Anvers, 1570) that "il y a plus de quinze ans passez" (p. 3), he reacted against atheists and set out to defeat or convert them. It is probably not a coincidence that this corresponds to the period of the Civil Wars. Yet Lefevre's orthodoxy emerges as most unorthodox. Perhaps also a sign of the times. He seems carried away by his multiple interests as well as the attempt to reconcile frequently divergent, if not totally opposed views. The primary philosophic theme which permeates all of his work is Ficinian or Florentine Platonism and its allied concepts of the Her- metica and Orphica. Thus he sees God as an infinite sphere or circle, stresses the doctrines of divine fury and truth-veiling, has a Hermetic vision of the soul and toys with cabalism. Characteristic of the histories of the period are his ardent na- tionalism, the tracing of French origins from Noah, his inordinate respect for the Druids which even makes him justify human sacrifice, as well as the attribution of the origins of almost all scientific and humanistic knowledge to French sources. Still, he is in some ways both unique and modern, for his period. In the foot-steps of Pico he strives to syncretize Platonism and Aris- totelianism, though it must be granted he does not succeed too well. Platonism seems to prevail over Thomas Aquinas who is seen pri- marily as a codifier (pp. 73 ff.). Just so does Savonarola share un- comfortable honors with Petrach and Boccaccio. Classical antiquity does not occupy the eminent position it held with Rabelais or Montaigne. The lists of eminent Greeks and Romans stress the poets rather than the philosophers. Socrates becomes a fore- runner of Christian ethics. And magic, the not too distant ally of the Hermetica, finds its place VOL. IvI, December 1961 741</page><page sequence="8">in La Galliade just as it assumed more importance in a France torn by internal strife. Yet this 'modern' still shares, at the end of the Renaissance, Rabelais' enthusiasm for the 'new' revival of learning. It is doubt- lessly this enthusiasm which prevails over orthodoxy in his praise of Erasmus and Pierre de La Ramee. We might well ask if this orientation does not represent a tacit rejection of the emergent rationalism, Padouan and other,8 traces of which are found in the work of Ronsard or Montaigne.
