<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE INFLUENCE OF MACHIAVELLI ON SPENSER I The influence on Machiavelliupon the Elizabethans was twofold. On the one hand, he stood for resolution, promptness, severity, as necessary elements in government; on the other fpr treachery, deceit, self-interest. Tamburlaine is the dramatization of one of these phases; Barabas of the other.' II Principe was the hand- book of Cromwell, of Burghley, and perhaps of the great queen herself;2 it was to others, or under other circumstances, a book "penned by the finger of Satan." This duality is perhaps involved in the book itself. The first fourteen chapters constitute a treatise on government, dealing with many of the problems which the England of Elizabeth was facing; the remaining chapters, including the notorious eighteenth, deal more particularly with the private character of the prince, and, perhaps through the distorted inter- pretation given by Gentillet, seemed a code for the trickster and the villain.3 To put it in another way, Machiavelli's insistence that the prince must be a combination of the lion and the fox is at the very base of the Elizabethan conception of his philosophy, except that as a rule they separated the two. In Spenser, both these phases are reflected: the lion in his View of the Present State of Ireland, and the fox in his Mother Hubberd's Tale. That Spenser knew. Machiavelli's writings scarcely needs demonstration. The little group of friends who discussed theories of poetry also read eagerly the writings of the Italian student of statecraft. So early as 1573 Harvey asked a friend to send him 1For exhaustive studies of Machiavelli's relation to the Elizabethan drama, see E.

(Cited by W. Raleigh, introduction to Hoby's Courtier, p. 1.) And in Meres' famous Sketch (1598) we read: "As the Lord de la Noue in the sixth Dis- course of his Politic and Military Discourses, censureth the books of Amadis de Gaul; which, he saith, are no less hurtful to youth than the works of Machiavelli to age," etc. (Arber, Eng.

Machiavell, Aretine, and whom you will, That ar any waye renown'd for extraordinary skill, I reade and reade till I flinge them away, And then goodnight Studye, tomorrowe is hallidaye.2 In 1574 Sidney refers to II Principe in a letter to Languet, and in Languet's reply Machiavelli is called Sidney's friend.3 Four years later Harvey writes a Latin poem attributing various crimes to Machiavelli, and in 1579 asserts that the works of the Italian are surpassingly popular: I warrant you sum good fellowes amongst us begin nowe to be pretely well acquainted with a certayne parlous booke callid, as I remember me, Il Principe di Nicolo Machiavelli, and I can peradventire name you an crewe or tooe that ar as cunninge in his Discorsi sopra la prima Deca di Livio, in his Historia Fiorentina, and in his Dialogues della Arte della Guerra tooe, as University men were wont to be in their parva Logicalia and Magna Moralia and Physicalia of both sortes.4 Harvey also mentions "Machiavel" in one of his letters to Spenser, published in 1580, and there are other evidences of the Italian's popularity with the young English students." There is reason to believe that not only were the originals familiar to Harvey and his friends but also the garbled and partisan interpretation written by Gentillet and translated into English by Patericke in 1579. And apparently it was this conception of Machiavellism as consisting mainly of trickery and foxcraft that appears in Mother Hubberd's Tale, published in 1591, but composed, at least in part, some years earlier. II In another place I have sought to show that Mother Hubberd's Tale derives mainly from the famous mediaeval cycle of Renard the Fox.6 The introduction suggests the Decamerone or the Canterbury Tales; but the rogues' progress and the incidents of the tale, with the peculiar conclusion in which the fox escapes the 1 Letter Book, ed.

But, as was pointed out in my former discussion, Spenser in Mother IHubberd's Tale was indebted to the Renard cycle only for the main outline of his plot. Possibly when he first wrote the tale, in the "raw conceipt" of his youth, his chief aim was to tell a story somewhat in the manner of Chaucer and based on the great beast epic. As it was published in 1591, however, the Tale shows some elements drawn from other sources and it is with this phase of Spenser's work that we are now concerned. The first section of the poem, consisting of about five hundred lines, follows the Renard material, modified by the influence of Chaucer, pretty closely. This embraces incidents (a), (b), (c), (d);' even the first courtier passage (502-14) is thoroughly characteristic. The description of the hypocritical priest (379-95), as well as the "ghostly sermon" (415-79) which he delivers to the two rogues, suggests Chaucer.2 But that part of the poem which deals with the experiences of the two rogues at court, while following the Renard material in the main, presents some peculiar problems. The material may be divided into four parts: the experience as courtier (642-942); the usurpation of the throne (943-1224); the intervention of Jove (1225-1332); and the con- clusion (1333-88). Of these, only the first two sections relate to the present inquiry, for the third is based on classical material ; 1 Cf. Modern Philology, January, 1905, pp. 421, 422. 2 Cf. 11. 382 if. with Chaucer's description of the Monk (Prologue, 11. 165 ff.); the "sermon' itself is strongly reminiscent of the Pardoner's Prologue and of the passage in the Tale in which that gentleman enlarges upon his view of life and his duty. Note also that the descrip- tion of the Mule (589-94) is quite in the manner of Chaucer's portrait of the Monk. And cf. 11. 866-68 : "Now like a Lawyer, when he land would lett, Or sell fee-simples in his Masters name, Which he had never, nor ought like the same." with Prologue (319) : "Al was fee-simple to him in effect." 3 Ll. 1225-30 and 11. 1246,1247 are based on Aeneid, i, 222-26 and 247; and the whole passage is closely parallel to F. Q., VII, vi, 14-18. Cf. especially 11. 1292-94 with stanza 18. This inter- vention of Jove and the use of Mercury as a means for carrying out his special providences are also found in Bruno's Spaccio de la Bestia Trionfante.

GREENLAW and the fourth is composed, as I have already shown,' of purely conventional Renardic material. As to the first two sections, dealing with court and courtiers, one notes that the narrative portions, and not a little of the satire, follow in all essentials the general source of the poem. But there are also evidences of other influences at work. For one thing, the Lion of 11. 621-30 is not the Lion of 11. 952 ff. Confusion result- ing from Spenser's reworking of the poem is plainly evident in 11. 627, 628, for the "she" refers to the Queen. Again, though it is not uncommon in the later French versions of the Renard romances for the animals to be displaced in all but name by chivalric heroes, i. e., the treatment is purely anthropomorphic, yet it is puzzling to find that a long passage in Spenser's poem (11. 655-942) has absolutely no suggestion of the animals. Except for the occasional use of the names "Ape" and "Fox" one would never imagine, if this were the only portion of the poem preserved to us, that it was a part of an animal tale. The persons, the allusions, the customs are those of the court, and the court was Elizabeth's near the end of the sixteenth century. There are such conventional Elizabethan themes as the praise of the perfect courtier, to be found wherever Castiglione was known and imitated; the intensely personal pas- sage about suitors' delays; and the characterization of the crafty courtier whose only care is how to advance himself. Lastly, though the animals all come trooping back in the second section, where the plotters usurp the Lion's throne, thus introducing an entirely different court, there seems to be a difference in much of the characterization of Reynold and the Ape; Reynold has practically become a new Prince in a conquered principality; together with the Ape, who is a mere figure-head, he represents the union of lion and fox which Machiavelli constantly stresses." 1 Modern Philology, II, 430, 431. 2It seems to me probable that the entire section (642-942) dealing with the first court was written at a later date than the remainder of the poem. This is not because it is better, but because it is so entirely different, in its lack of the animal element and its use of Renais- sance material, from the passage dealing with the usurpation. The animals disappear with the Mule, and do not return until the rogues begin their plot against the Lion. Ostensibly it is the same court in both passages; in reality there are two different courts, peopled by entirely different courtiers. The first court passage, which is of the Renaissance and not of mediaeval times, is opened with the speech of the Mule, which shows, as has already been pointed out, signs of confusion caused by reworking. It is probable that Spenser either inserted the long passage which follows, or practically reworked what he had originally 190</page><page sequence="5">THE INPLUENCE OF MACHIAVELLI ON SPENSER 5 Greene's The Scottish Hystorie of James the Fourth is an admirable illustration of the way in which the conventional con- ception of Machiavellism was applied to the drama, and it contains some useful parallels to Mother Hubberd's Tale.' Professor Gayley dates the play ca. 1590; thus it is practically contemporary with Spenser's poem. There is a passage in dispraise of court which is very similar to that in Mother Hubberd's Tale.2 The king is called a "lion,"'3 and Ateukin the "fox."4 Thus the two illustrate in precisely the same manner as in Mother Hubberd's Tale Machiavelli's oft-repeated formula, lion plus fox. Ateukin uses methods of attracting attention in accordance with Machia- velli's advice;" and his methods are similar to those used by Reynold.6 Greene's model is revealed by the fact that Ateukin is making "annotations upon Matchavell" which he carries about with him.7 Ateukin's theory that 'Tis pollicie, my liege, in everie state To cut off members that disturbe the head,8 written. Moreover, it is worthy of note that it is this passage which gave offense to Burghley, and probably caused the poem to be suppressed or "called in." There is one interesting bit of evidence that Spenser got into hot water because of his satire that I believe has not been noted. In Thomas Scot's Philomythie, a curious satirical poem in which "outlandish birds, beasts, and fishes are taught to speake true English plainly," first edition published 1616, we read: " If Spenser were now living to report His Mother Hubbert's Tale, there would be sport To see him in a blanket test, and mounted Up to the stars, and yet no starre accounted." 1 It may be mentioned, in passing, that there are interesting parallels between this play and Twelfth Night. Examples are Dorothea's words when told she must disguise herself as a man, and her fear of a sword (III, iii, 99-114); her mood, closely parallel to Viola's, here and in IV, iv, 1-15; the situation (V, i) in which she is placed by finding that Lady Anderson loves her; etc. The characterization of Dorothea is very similar, in many respects, to that of Viola. 2Induction, 11. 40-52, ed. Manly. This is a very frequently used motif in Elizabethan literature. From Wyatt's time on, there are scores of passages which complain bitterly "what hell it is in suing long to bide." One of the most interesting parallels to Mother HuTbberd's Tale is supplied by Braithwaite's Strappado for the Divell (pub. 1615) : "The Ornaments which he admires are these, To faune, to observe times, to court, to please, To make strange faces, sleeke his prefum'd skin, Starch his Mouchatoes, and forget his sinne, To dance, to dice, to congie, to salute, To stamp, to stalke, to finger well a lute, To tremble at a Cannon when it shootes, To like, dislike, and fill his head with doubts, To be in passion, wind his carelesse armes, To file his Mistresse with delightful charmes, To be for all, yet ignorant in all To be disguised, and strange fantasticall." -Ed.

GREENLAW is not only good Machiavellism but it is also the method followed by Reynold in making his false Prince secure.' This "fox Ateukin," careful student of "Matchavell," typifies the distorted view which the Elizabethans gained from Gentillet. The influence of this species of Machiavellism on the drama has often been pointed out; we may now note the same influence at work in a part of Mother Hubberd's Tale. The principal elements in Gentillet's charge against Machia- velli are his so-called blasphemous attacks on religion; his un- scrupulous cruelty and perjury; his apology for hypocrisy; in short, his use of "policy" and self-seeking rather than sincerity and humanity. All these traits are characteristic of Reynold in the two incidents dealing with court and government. 1. The Mule says they must see to it That men may think of you in generall, That to be in you which is not at all; For not by that which is, the world now deemeth, (As it was wont) but by that same that seemeth. 2. There is mockery of religion: He would his impudent lewde speach Against Gods holie Ministers oft reach, And mocke Divines and their profession, What else then did he by progression, But mocke high God himselfe, whom they professe? But what car'd he for God, or godliness?' 3. He cares only for himself, and stops at no means to gain his ends. All his care was himselfe how to advaunce, And to uphold his courtly countenaunce, 1 L1. 1175 ft. It is an interesting coincidence, also, that Ateukin, like Reynold, escapes without punishment after his schemes have fallen in ruins about his ears. Thus he is the true fox of the Renard cycle. 2 L1. 647-50. Cf. Gentillet, Max. C. 22 (these maxims are taken from Meyer, op. cit., pp. 10-14): " La foy, clemence, liberalit6 sent vertus fort dommageables I un Prince; mais il est bon qu'il en ait le semblant tant seulement." Also, cf. I1 Principe, cap. xviii: "Ma f neces- sario questa natura saperla ben colorire, ed essere gran simulatore e dissimulatore: e sono tanto semplici gli uomini, e tanto obbediscono alle necessith presenti, che colui che inganna, troverh sempre chi si lascert ingannare .. ..

Gentillet, B: "Maximes de la seconde partie, traitant de la Religion que doit avoir un Prince." These maxims, with the comments thereon, charge Machiavelli with being an impudent blasphemer. 192</page><page sequence="7">THE INFLUENCE OF MACHIAVELLI ON SPENSER 7 By all the cunning meanes he could devise; Were it by honest wayes, or otherwise, He made small choyce .... No statute so established might bee, Nor ordinaunce so needfull,obut that hee Would violate, though not with violence .... "I for my selfe must care before else anie."'1 4. The Ape, who is a mere figure-head, is joined with the Fox, thus illustrating Machiavelli's theory that the Prince must be a combination of lion and fox.2 5. Reynold establishes a strong guard;3 increases his own treasure;4 and ruins the country, reducing all the nobles to abject poverty or driving them into exile.5 III In the Veue of the Present State of Ireland the influence of Machiavelli is unmistakable. Here, however, it is the master of statecraft that appeals to Spenser rather than the apostle of indi- vidualism. Though the tract was not published until 1633, Spenser endorsed it "finys 1596," and it was entered for publication in April, 1598. MS copies of it were circulated, and in 1598 a brief of the main arguments was sent to the queen under the caption, "Certaine points to be considered of in the recovery of the Realme of Ireland."'6 It may also be noted that the defense of Lord Gray's course in Ireland, which forms the chief part of the fifth 1 L1. 845-49; 1161-63; 1196.

Also, II Principe, cap. xviii: "Essendo, adunque, un Principe necessitate saper bene usare la bestia, debbe di quelle pigliare la volpe e il leone;" and xix: " ..0. io voglio mostr ar brevemente quanto egli seppe ben usare la persona della volpe e del leone; le quali nature dice, come di sopra, esser necessarie ad imitare a un Principe."

GREENLAW book of the Faery Queene, is repeated, with the veil of allegory removed, in the VeCue.' Lord Gray died in 1593; Book V of the Faery Queene was completed by 1594, and "entered," with Books IV and VI, in January, 1596. Perhaps the poet's desire to win the favor of Essex, shown also in the Prothalamium (November, 1596), accounts in part for his growing interest in matters of state policy. The problem presented by Ireland was one of the most vexing of those with which the queen and her advisers had to deal. With it the poet had some knowledge at first hand; he also saw how entirely the principles laid down by Machiavelli for the governing of a turbulent foreign colony would fit the present case; he resolved to point this out, trusting to the well-known popularity of Machiavelli's writings at court as an element in his favor, and incidentally seizing the opportunity of once more defending Lord Gray, this time on the unimpeachable authority of the Italian thinker. No doubt, too, the parallelbetween his own disappointed ambitions and those of Machiavelli suggested itself to him, and like Machiavelli, he hoped by writing such a book to win the favor of his superiors. In its general scheme, the Veue follows II Principe very closely. Spenser finds his text in Machiavelli's third chapter: "Ma quando si acquistano stati in una provincia disforme di lingua, 1 Machiavelli's well-known distrust of the people is paralleled in Arthegall's rebuke of the giant who represents the theory of political and social equality in F.Q., V, ii. Later, Arthegall (Lord Gray) fights in behalf of Irena (Ireland) and vanquishes her enemies. After restoring peace "All such persons, as did late maintayne That Tyrant's part with close or open ayde, He sorely punished with heavie payne; That in short space, whiles there he with her stayd Not one was left that durst her once have disobayd. During which time that he did there remayne, His studie was true Justice how to deale, And day and night employ'd his busie payne How to reform that ragged commonweale; And that same yron man, which could reveale All hidden crimes, through all that realme he sent To search out those that usd to rob and steale, Or did rebell geinst lawfull government; On whom he did inflict most grievous punishment." -V, xii, 25, 26. But "ere he coulde reforme it thoroughly," he was recalled, for "envies cloud still dimmeth vertues ray;" the charge against him being "that he had, with unmanly guile And foule abusion, bo'h his honour blent, And that bright sword, the sword of Justice lent, Had stayned with reprochfull crueltie In guiltless blood of many an innocent." -V, xii, 40. All this is repeated, with additions, in the Veue. 194</page><page sequence="9">THE INFLUENCE OP /MACHIAVELLI ON SPENSER 9 di costumi e d'ordini, qui sono le difficulth, e qui bisogna avere gran fortuna e grande industria a tenerli." The entire tract is a development of this idea, except that Spenser includes the differ- ences in language in his discussion of the customs of the Irish, and stresses the variation in religion. It should also be noted that whereas Machiavelli contents himself with postulating a difference in language, customs, and laws, Spenser devotes rather more than the first half of his essay to an exposition of these differences. In this there is considerable "ripping up of auncient historyes," and Eudoxus is quite right in thinking that it "savoureth of good conceits, and some reading withall." Particularly interesting are the descriptions of costumes, a subject in which Spenser proves himself expert; the singularly neglected brief treatise on the function of poetry, which suggests Spenser's former interest in the subject; the defense of Lord Gray, to which he also returns in the last part of the essay; and the discussion of religion, which throws considerable light on Spenser's own religious opinions. There is not a little humor, considerable learning, and a deal of keen obser- vation in this part of the essay. But it is the second division which shows most directly the debt to Machiavelli. The first fourteen chapters of II Principe are drawn upon, and the most important arguments in each work exactly correspond, though of course Spenser does not follow the same sequence of topics, and his method is further modified by being applied to a particular case. The indebtedness of Spenser can best be pointed out by constructing a brief of his argument, with cross references to passages on the same subjects in Machia- velli.1 "VEUE" " IL PRINCIYPE" I.

The present method is not less expen- sive and is utterly ineffective. See 651a and also the defense of Lord Gray, noted below. (b) The imputation of cruelty is not to be feared. Lord Gray suffered from the charge "that he was a bloudye man, and regarded not the life of her subjects noe more than dogges, but had wasted and consumed all, soe as nowe she had nothing almost left, but to raigne in her ashes .... " When he was removed "not onely all that "JIL PRINOIPE" there in person; or to hold as a depend- ency, taking tribute.1 Cf. medicine forti (cap. fii) etc. There is no safe way to retain them except to ruin them.2 Unless ruined, the city will destroy the conqueror, for the watchword of liberty and ancient privileges is a ral- lying point in rebellion; the safest way is to destroy utterly or reside there.3 Machiavelli constantly stresses promptness, severity, and the ability to give a crushing blow. Cruelty is justifiable if applied at one blow and necessary to one's secur- ity; unjustifiable when, notwithstand- ing slight beginning, it must be persisted in. A prince who follows this second course cannot maintain himself.4 bo Cesare Borgia in Romagna found the country full of robbers; exter- 1 Il primo b rovinarli; l'altro andarvi ad abitare personalmente; il terzo lasciargli vivere con le sue leggi, tirandone una pensione, e creandovi dentro uno stato di pochi, che te lo conservino amico (cap. v). 2 PerchB in verita non ci b modo sicuro a possederle, altro che la rovina (cap. v). 3 E chi diviene padrone di una citta consueta a vivere libera, e non la disfaccia, aspetti di essere disfatto da quella; percha sempre ha per r, fugio nella rebellione il nome della liberta, e gli ordini antichi suoi. .... talcha la pih sicura via B spegnerle, o abitarvi (cap. v). 4 Credo che questo avvenga dalle crudelta male o bene usate.

"This base sorte people doth not for the most parte rebell of himself, hav- ing noe harte therunto, but is of force drawen by the graunde rebells into theyr actions, and carryed away with the violence of the streame" (653b). Lord Gray was wrongly accused of cruelty in destroying the chiefs, because he did it to strike terror into the common people (655 b). III. After the Irish have been ut- terly subdued by this swift and severe treatment: (a) English soldiers should be estab- lished there as colonists. This is developed in detail in pp. 662 b-663, in a passage too long to quote. The argument is based on the precedent of the colonizing of Britain by the Romans. (b) The English Governor of the province should live there and have absolute power. This principle is stated in p. 666 b. Cf. also p. 682 b: "This should be one principle in the appoyntment of the "IL PRINCIPE" disarming a new state which is added as a province to the old one.' Cf. Machiavelli's defence of the methods of Cesare Borgia, cap. vii. On this cf. cap. ix. Cesare Borgia is defended for ex- terminating the nobles in Romagna (cap. vii). In cap. iii Machiavelli dwells on the importance of establishing colonies as a means of holding a dependency. The Roman method in this respect is several times referred to. Near the end of the chapter, one of the capital errors of Louis XII is said to be his failure to send colonies into Italy. Cesare Borgia made d'Orco his governor in Romagna and gave him absolute power.2 1 Ma quando un Principe acquista uno stato nuovo che come membro s'aggiunga al suo vecchio, allora B necessario disarmare quello stato . . . . ed -ordinarsi in modo, che tutte l'armi del tuo stato sieno in quelli soldati tuoi propri, che nello stato tuo antico vivono appresso di te. 2 Cap. vii. 198</page><page sequence="13">THE INFLUENCE OF MACHIAVELLI ON SPENSER 13 "VEUE" Lord Deputyes authority, that it should be more ample and absolute then it is, and that he should have uncontrolled power" (682 b). This in order that troubles may be dealt with before they become serious, thus gaining "timely prevention." Here occurs a direct reference to "Machiavell in his discourses upon Livye"where he commends the Roman practice of giving to their governors absolute power (683a). (c) The laws should not be too radically changed. "I doe not thinke it convenient, though nowe it be in the power of the Prince, to change all the lawes and make newe, for that should breede a greate trouble and confusion .... Therefore since we cannot nowe apply lawes fitt for the people, as in the first institution of commonwealthes it ought to be, we will applye the people, and fitt them to the lawes, as it most conveniently may be" (670 b-671 a). (d) Farming and religion are to be fostered (677 b, 680). (e) Towns are to be multiplied. "They will both strengthen all the countreye rounde about them .... and will also be as continuall holdes for her Majestie, yf the people should revolte and breake out agayne, for without such it is easye to forraie and over-runne the whole land" (682 a). "IL PRINCIPE" Of the three courses allowed by Machiavelli in dealing with a new state (to ruin them; to reside there in person; or to permit them to live under their own laws, establishing an oligar- chy by means of colonizing) it will be observed that Spenser stresses the first and third.' The necessity of keeping the people satisfied and contented is empha- sized.2 Agriculture to be fostered for this reason.3 Princes should fortify their towns, and not on any account defend the open country. By this means they will avoid attack.4 Some additional reasons may now be given for postulating indebtedness of the Veue to Machiavelli: 1. Verbal parallels. (a) Machiavelli's phrase medicine forti supplies the key to Spenser's plan for reform, and often appears in the Veue.e Several instances have already been cited under II 1 Cap. v, quoted above p. 196. 2Cap. xix. 3 Cap. xxi. 4Cap. x, ad. init. b Professor Fletcher (Encyclopedia Americana, s. v. "Spenser") has referred to Spenser's use of this phrase from Machiavelli. 199</page><page sequence="14">14 EDWIN A. GREENLAW (a), above; one also notes "too violent a medecine" (623 a), and in Spenser's letter "To the Queene" (1598)1 is the statement that "nothing but a moste violent medecyne will serve to recouver it." The phrase is too frequently used by Spenser to be mere chance. (b) The idea, based on the same phrase, that the work of reform in Ireland is the work of the physician, seeking by heroic measures to save the life of a patient desperately ill, corresponds to Machia- velli's frequent use of the simile of the physician." (c) The reference to "the Prinee" (670 b) is significant: "I doe not thinke it convenient, though nowe it be in the power of the Prince, to change all the lawes and make newe, for that should breed a greate trouble and confusion." Spenser does not elsewhere in the Veue refer to the Queen in this manner. 2. Similarities in structure and style. One illustration of this has already been pointed out: the fact that in general outline the Veue closely follows Machiavelli's idea of proposing a course of action suitable for dealing with a principality differing in insti- tutions and customs from the country of the Prince. It is hardly Iess striking that Spenser's method of supporting his arguments by illustrations drawn from history is directly imitated from Machiavelli. Nothing is more characteristic of I1 Principe than this: an observation or general statement is followed by copious historical illustration. Spenser uses precisely the same method, at times even using the same illustrations. 3. There is a direct reference to Machiavelli, with an illustra- tion drawn from the Discorsi. "VEUE" (682 b-683 a) Therfore this should be one prin- ciple in the appoyntment of the Lord Deputyes authoritye, that it should be more ample and absolute then it is, and that he should have uncontrol- led power to doe anything .. .. for it is not possible for the Counsell heere, to direct a Governour there, whoe shal be forced oftentimes to fol- lowe the necessitye of present occa- DiscoRsi (Lib. II, cap. xxxiii) The authority given to these Con- suls and Dictators was of the most unlimited character. Fabius did not even notify the Senate in a crisis; thus there was no delay, and they did not meddle in affairs which they did not under- stand. 1 Grosart, I, 538 ff. 2 Veue 609 6, 610 a, 656 b; It Prinrcipe, cap. iii; Discorsi, lib. III, cap. i., etc. 200</page><page sequence="15">THE INFLUENCE OF MACHIAVELLI ON SPENSER 15 " VEUE" sions, and to take the suddayne advantage of time, which being once loste will not be recovered; whilst, through expecting directions from hence ..... greate danger often groweth, which by such timely pre- vention might easily be stopped. And this (I remember) is woor the.lye ob- served by Machiavill in his discourses upon Livye, when he commendeth the manner of the Romayne government, in giving absolute power to all theyre Consuls and Governours .... And the contrarye therof he repre- hendeth in the States of Venice, of Florence, and many other principali- ties of Italye." "IL PRINCIPE" The Republics of the present day, such as the Venetians and the Floren- tines, act very differently ... . which hasbrought them to the coi dition in which they now find themselves. There are a few other indications that Spenser knew the Discorsi, such as the fact that in III, i, Machiavelli emphasizes the need of fostering religion, a point not brought out in II Prin- cipe for the obvious reason that there he was planning a course of action to be applied to Italian cities, in which there were no varia- tions in religion; Spenser stresses the point in the Veue. Also, Machiavelli's favorite simile of the physician dealing with a disease requiring heroic treatment, so often used by Spenser, occurs again in Discorsi, III, i. Again, Spenser often says that the semblance of old forms must be preserved in Ireland; this is also observed by Machiavelli in I, xxv. And finally, Spenser's statement (674 b) that it is a great grace in a prince to deal liberally in occasions where there is no constraint, is an echo not only of the praise of liberality in II Principe (cap. xvi), but also of the Discorsi (I, 51), where prudent men are said to make it appear as if their course were dictated by their own liberality. In general, however, the debt of the Veue to the Discorsi is extremely small; it is therefore the more significant that Spenser's only direct reference to Machiavelli is to this work. If he drew directly from a book which in the nature of things had little to contribute to the problem which he had in mind, it is the more 201</page><page sequence="16">16 EDWIN A. GREENLAW certain that he must have known the one book of his time which in subject and in method bore most directly upon such a problem. 4. Finally, Spenser acknowledges (683 b) that his plan is not original with him. "I doe not deliver (it) for a perfect plott of myne owne invention, .... but as I have learned and understood the same by the consultations and actions of verye wise Gover- nours and Counsellors.'" Among these very wise governors and counsellors Machiavelli assuredly stood. Thus the Veue of the Present State of Ireland, despised and rejected by most lovers of Spenser, is seen to possess a certain distinction in Elizabethan literature, the distinction of rightly interpreting Machiavellism. To Spenser's contemporaries, the word was anathema. In Spenser's own earlier poem, the conven- tional view was given, the foxcraft of pseudo-Machiavellism being combined with mediaeval Renardie. In the Veue, however, we have not a mere servile defense of Lord Gray's atrocities, nor an inhuman hatred of the Irish people, but an earnest plea for the course which Spenser believed would soonest bring relief to that wretched and suffering province. The theories of Machiavelli are here applied as the great Italian intended, not as a code for an adventurer who seeks by unholy means to advance his own fortunes, but as a means for bringing a new province into a con- dition where permanent reform should be possible.
