<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HUMANISM OF JOSEPH CONRAD Joseph Conrad, now that he is dead, is being made popular as well as famous. The American art of advertising, having been called upon, has responded in terms of which the following choice question is a sufficient indication: "Who can resist tales that pick you up and throw you bodily into strange surround ings, tales of love as deep as the sea itself, tales of gripping ad venture; a ferocious combat, a struggle for existence, a mid night explosion on a desolate harbor, a millionaire's yacht an chored on a remote inlet while the natives are sharpening their barongs for a massacre?" We can imagine what kind of reader would respond to such allurements, and what sort of books he would expect to get for his money. And we can also wonder what state of mind that native soul would be in, expecting something similar to Treasure Islond ox The Sea Wolf, and be ginning The Rescue \x\ innocent anticipation of hearing all about those barongs ! But we do not take "blurbs" too seriously. When critics foster an inaccuracy, the case is altered. The blurb advertises Conrad as a popular romancer; the critics praise him as a lit erary romancer. The distinction is one of degree not of kind. Mr. Joseph Curie strikes the usual note when he says flatly: "Conrad is the most romantic of writers." Now I admit that in Conrad you find both melodrama and glamor; but my opionion is that if he possessed nothing else he would not be entitled to the very high rank he is beginning to hold in our literary history. My opinion is that he possesses some thing else? a view of life, an attitude toward men and women ; and that furthermore this attitude sets him less in the tradi tion of The Ancient Mariner or Moby Dick than in that of Homer, of dipus and King Lear. I hold, in other words, that funda mentally, Conrad's art, at its best is less romantic than classic. I Now I do not use those much-abused words in any narrow and arbitrary sense. I consider that they represent alternative</page><page sequence="2">The Humanism of Joseph Conrad 205 attitudes toward life and conduct, alternatives between which not only writers but every person who has any spiritual energy at all, must choose. They represent opposite tendencies. Clas sicism, or humanism, toward control, normality, and unification of experience. Romance seeks unlimited expression, strange ness, multiplicity. The one is centripetal; the other cen trifugal. The former runs the? clanger of being mediocre, but aims at the golden mean. The latter, on the other hand, runs the danger of flying off into the lunatic fringe, where so many modern artists have obviously landed. At its best, however, romance adds to beauty strangeness as in Coleridge, or mysti cism as in Blake or sensuousness as in Keats, depicting in beautiful symbols the less frequented ways of the spirit. Hu manism, on the contrary, lays claim to its title because it seeks what is peculiarly human?that is, ethical, rational, controlled ?in contrast to those irrational and instinctive qualities which man shares with the brute or with nature. Now it should not occasion surprise when I say that in Con rad there is both. There have been few or no great artists in whom there has not been something of both. Shakespeare is outwardly romantic; at bottom he is ethical and controlled. So I believe is Conrad at his best. This article is an attempt to distinguish between these opposing tendencies in him. I begin with what is, or is taken to be, romantic. In the first place Conrad's practical necessity, as we know from letters published, was to make money by his pen. He sought to do so by making the stories popular in the same way and for probably the same reason as did Shakespeare. Both built works of beauty on a foundation of melodrama. For nine tenths of the average audience Hamlet is nothing but melo drama?ghosts, revenges, plottings, madness and sudden death. It is none the less a tragedy to the discerning. And the bare plots of such novels of Conrad as The Rescue, Lord Jim, Nos tromo, Victory, not to mention stories like Falk or Heart of Dark ness, are, except for the "unhappy" ending, perfectly adaptable to the screen. And the screen, of course, by the very fact that it omits the artistic significance of a work, demonstrates the</page><page sequence="3">206 The Sewanee Review amount of melodrama in it. This use of melodrama has been made a reproach to Conrad; a critic as sympathetic as Abel Chevalley "regrets" he has felt obliged to mix so much of the feuilleton in his novels." Nevertheless, despite our blurb's implications, Conrad was never as wholehearted about his sensationalism as Shakespeare was, and as a consequence never has been genuinely popular, as Shakespeare has been. Shakespeare wrote immortal plays with out, so far as we can see, having been troubled by an artistic con science. Conrad was. His ironic sense of truth, his dislike of emo tional excess, never permitted him to follow the broad road to best-sellerdom. His endings, for example, as I have suggested, are never the facile and conventional ones ; and he could very forcefully express his distaste for such expedients. The letter has already been widely quoted in which he comments on the rejection of Freya of Seven Isles by a certain editor. "As for faking a 'sunny' ending to my story, I would see all the Ameri can Magazines and all the American Editors damned in heaps before lifting my pen for that task. I have never been particu larly anxious to rub shoulders with the piffle they print with touching consistency from year's end to year's end." His tales oftener end sadly than not; but what is more to the point, he frequently goes deliberately about to avoid mere sensation in the interest of deeper significance. In Falk, for instance, we have the sufficiently sensational fact that the hero once ate human flesh. Imagine the conventional, Poesque treatment of the theme. Conrad puts the incident far back in the past, and centers our attention on how it affected Falk's character. What might have been mere melodrama is trans formed into a pitifully ironic study, emotionally near to tragedy. I admit, then, that much in the plots of Conrad's novels is crudely romantic, if considered alone. But one cannot justly consider it alone, any more than one can consider alone the bare plot of Hamlet, or even of that classic masterpiece which Aris totle took as his model, dipus the King. Secondly, Conrad's involved and retrospective method of narration, so often criticized, at times so tantalizing, akin as it</page><page sequence="4">The Humanism of Joseph Cotwad 207 is to the methods of some romanticists, proves when closely examined tobe an effort in the opposite direction. This method is too familiar to need extended explanation. Ford Madox Ford, in his Personal Recollection, amusingly gives us his understand ing of it as it was worked out by the two together during their collaboration. As he puts it: "We saw that life did not narrate, but made impressions on our brains. We in turn, as we wished to produce on you an effect of life, must not narrate but render impressions." One must not generalize about a character or event; one must presenta mass of data just as it might come to one in life, and let the reader do the generalizing. But such a method handicaps a writer when he wants to make clear the sig nificance of his material. Conrad as a result had recourse to long retrospective and explanatory narrations which at any moment would interrupt the flow of the story. He also made use of a personal narrator, from the belief that the device enhances veri similitude, and from the need of having some alter ego to philos ophize occasionally about the goings-on. Thus we were given Marlow, that extraordinary ancient mariner, who must indeed have held his audience with a glittering eye to have kept them silent through the expanses of his discourse. In all this I see the French influence Mr. Ford emphasizes less clearly than I do that of Henry James, Conrad's friend and "cher ma?tre". Incidentally it is amusing to note James, as quoted by Mr. Walpole, remarking of our author's method that "it places Mr. Conrad absolutely alone as votary of the way to do a thing that shall make it undergo most doing." This from the author of such works as What Maisie Knew! At all events, this impressionistic technic, in spite of its toil after actuality and its timidity wdth the frank conventions of traditional fiction, too often becomes itself a labored and im probable convention, as we know to our regret in Tord Jim and Chance. It might indeed be argued that Conrad would have done better with a more forthright method of story-telling. But that is neither here nor there so far as we are concerned. The point for us is that what is sometimes taken in Conrad for per verse artifice is actually a consequence of a passion for telling</page><page sequence="5">208 The Sewanee Review the exact truth. An acute critic has said that Conrad had greater respect for realism of human emotions than earlier Eng lish novelists like Meredith and Hardy. This view would seem to be borne out by what Conrad himself has to say regarding the use of the imagination: "Well, that imagination . . . should be used to create human souls: to disclose human hearts, ?and not to create events that are properly speaking accidents only. To accomplish it you must cultivate your poetic faculty ?you must give yourself up to emotions (no easy task). You must squeeze out of yourself every sensation, every thought, every image?mercilessly, without reserve as without remorse: you must search the darkest corners of your heart, the most inner recesses of your brain ? you must search them for the im age, for the glamour, for the right expression. And you must do it sincerely, at any cost. You must do it so that at the end of your day's work you should feel exhausted, emptied of every sensation and every thought, with a blank mind and an aching heart, with the notion that there is nothing?nothing left in you." In search after truth the rule of moderation, for Conrad as well as for philosophy, obviously did not hold! Grant that he adopted a current romantic technic. One must deny that the burning passion for sincerity that lay behind his adoption is something peculiar to romanticism. Thirdly, let us consider those "strange surroundings" spoken of in the advertisement. Surely, says the average reader, a story laid in the South Seas is per se romantic ! There is a hoary tradition to that effect, founded on obvious causes. Never theless the matter is not so simple. Conrad happens actually to have lived some of his most impressionable years in the South Seas, and to tell of what he has actually seen. He has not been, so far as I am aware, criticized for inaccuracy in these settings. Nay, more, it is remarkable in reading his life and letters to dis cover what large chunks of his own actual past experience he transported bodily into his stories. Indeed, several critics, considering these things, have labelled him "romantic realist" or "realistic romancer". The terms</page><page sequence="6">The Humanism of Joseph Conrad 209 are well enough so far as they go. Realism, meaning an effort to describe things accurately, in spite of a common notion to the contrary, is not incompatible with romance. In fact, it is extremely useful to romance: it makes the improbable seem plausible. Thus realism, as a method, is used by Balzac and Hugo, by Poe and Dickens and Stevenson, and almost every great romantic writer. The romantic furthermore tends toward realism because of his interest in the variety of things. Real ism as a method, however, is not opposed to humanism. The classic artist, it is true, is less likely than the romantic to de light in details, but when he uses them he does so with equal desire for accuracy. And realism as a method Conrad obviously used, and naturally: to be accurate was a necessary part of his impressionistic technic, and an essential of his artistic faith. Realism, however, sometimes means not a method but an atti tude? the cold scientific observation of fact, the avoidance of any kind of idealization. In this sense Conrad was no realist. His criticisms of Arnold Bennett make this obvious. "I would quarrel not with the truth of your conception but with the real ism thereof. You stop just short of being absolutely real be cause you are faithful to your dogmas of realism. Now realism in art will never approach reality. And your art, your gift, should be put to the service of a larger and freer faith." Whether for Conrad himself this "faith" was a romantic one is the real question before us. His realistic use of details of the South Sea islands!?has little bearing on our problem. II If, then, one looks for something essentially romantic in Con rad, he will not find it in Conrad's occasional use of startling incident or exotic setting. These things are more accidental, superficial, than innate qualities of the author. But there is undoubtedly something else to be found. That is glamor?the glamor which Conrad throws over any setting, exotic or not, which touches his imagination. This is the one important ro mantic quality which I find in him. Let us consider its nature and its bearing on our problem. Now romantic literature shows notable manifestations of a mental disturbance with characteristics similar to homesickness. 6</page><page sequence="7">210 The Sewanee Review Adolescents usually feel a disturbance similar to it, which the disillusioned adult world calls "growing pains". Some people never grow out of it: and in them it is often considered a mark of distinctibn, as being the outward and visible sign of artistic grace, a longing for the ideal, the bearing of the banner with the strange device, so to speak, into the Alpine heights. Some long hopefully for their ideal; some become disillusioned and hope less. Criticism calls the longing romantic nostalgia. Now there is no one, romantic or otherwise, but yearns for something. What distinguishes romantic nostalgia both in life and in literature is its extreme subjectivity. The longing may attach itself for a time to some object outside the individual, just as the adolescent thinks himself in love with the nearest girl : but it is essentially the result of auto-suggestion, and is hence changeable and restless. It is a prolongation into the maturity of "wishful thinking'' of childhood; it is the result of the imagination working to appease the instincts without the discipline of reality. Shelley is perhaps the supreme example in English literature, and may well be contrasted with another poet usually con sidered romantic?Burns. Shelley's desire was that "of the moth for the star, of the dawn for the morrow"; he imagined himself into love with Harriet or Mary or Emilia. Burns wanted not so much ideal love as particular women. The re sults in both cases were unfortunate; but the point is that rela tively Shelley's love affairs were far more than those of Burns the temporary "fixations" of subjective imaginings. And since no actual woman could measure up to the dream of a romantic genius, disillusionment inevitably followed. Shelley never became permanently disillusioned; his dream world, in other words, never became adapted to reality; he never "grew up". But other less sanguine romantics become permanently disillusioned without losing their nostalgia. In their work the longing, since it can find no satisfactory object in life, finds in it consciously fabricated dreams, or manifests itself merely in a suffused emotional tone. It is in this last way that romantic nostalgia manifests itself in Conrad.</page><page sequence="8">The Humanism of Joseph Conrad 211 Now considering the facts of Conrad's life we would a priori expect something of the kind. When a mere infant he was exiled to Russian prison camps with his parents, and was wit ness to the mortal illness that followed upon his mother's privations. During his formative years he was witness to his fathers's death in sorrow and loneliness. As a youth he was imbued with the proud but hopeless traditions of a patrician family and a conquered race; he became the passionate lover of home and country, and found himself deprived of both. Under the circumstances we cannot wonder at the nervous anxiety and restlessness of his temperament, even in his middle age. Nor is it so extraordinary that as a youth he felt an irresistible impulsion to wander, and that he became a sailor under the flag of England. What he could not find in Poland he was impelled to seek elsewhere. Hatred of Russia, generalized in his large spirit to hatred of all oppression and injustice, was balanced by the love for freedom and justice, and he ideal ized England into the symbol for these. And his need for fellowship and solidarity, denied in Poland, was partially met by the fellowship of the sea, the necessary result of the sailor's human isolation and enforced cooperative toil. But though Conrad was impelled by a spiritual homesickness to wander, it is obvious that his sickness was never wholly cured either by the sea or by life in England. The result is a nostalgic tone manifested in all his writing. Like the music of that other Polish genius, Chopin, Conrad's style was always not a little brooding, melancholy, and yearning. Typically the yearning of his middle age, when he is writing, had through disillusionment become generalized to regret for the transiency of beauty. Thus comes his desire "to snatch in a moment of courage, from the remorseless rush of time, a passing phase of life"; "to hold up unquestioningly, without choice and without fear, the rescued fragment before all eyes in the light of a sin cere mood" ; and to disclose "the stress and passion within the core of each convincing moment". Passion was for him recol lected not in tranquility but with regret and yearning, because all things, whether beautiful or terrible, are transient. His art</page><page sequence="9">212 The Sewanee Review was thus a means of remoulding the universe nearer to the heart's desire. His nostalgia is manifested not only in his fondness for mem ories but in the details of his style. Thus we find in his sen tences the tendency to "looseness", to trailing off. There is considerable evidence that he thought most readily in French and that he was greatly influenced by Flaubert and de Maupas sant. Certainly he often uses triads of adjectives, following the words they modify as in French, which close the sentence with a dying fall. "The land and the water slept invisible, unstirring, and mute." "The weary succession of nights and days tainted by the obstinate clamour of sages, demanding bliss and an empty heaven, is redeemed at last by the vast silence of pain and labour, by the dumb fear and the dumb courage of men obscure, forget ful, and enduring." Or, of a ship,". . . again, for long hours she remained lost in a vast universe of night and silence where gentle sighs wandering here and there like forlorn souls, made the still sails flutter as in sudden fear, and the ripple of a beshrouded ocean whisper its compassion afar?in a voice mournful, immense and faint." He often uses parallel series of words or phrases not for logical clarity but for the effect of suggestiveness, uncertainty, elusiveness. "She lived like the tall palms among whom she was passing now, seeking the light, desiring the sunshine, fearing the storm, unconscious of either. The slave had no hope, and knew of no change. She knew of no other sky, no other water, no other forest, no other world, no other life. She had no wish, no hope, no love, no fear except of a blow, and no vivid feeling but that of occasional hunger. . ." Again consider his use of metaphor and simile for suggestive ness?"She dipped into the hollow straight down, as if going over the edge of the world." "In the perfect calm before the coming of the afternoon breeze the irregularly jagged line of tree-tops stood unchanging, as if traced by an unsteady hand on the clear blue of the hot sky." The reader will have felt the rhythmic effects of these pas sages, effects that, according to Ford, Conrad labored upon</page><page sequence="10">The Humanism of Joseph Conrad 213 unceasingly. This rhythm undoubtedly re-enforces the mood. But above all we must note his fondness for words denoting unlimited space and time, connoting wonder, mystery, and nos talgia. This, in spite of his complaints concerning the indefinite ness of English words contrasted with French, and his almost Flaubertian toil after the mot juste. The explanation of the ap parent contradiction lies in that his anxiety was for fidelity to a mood, and that to convey a mood a writer must use words poeti cally, for their suggestiveness. ". . . The sea that stretching away on all sides merged into the illimitable silence of all creation." "And the immortal sea stretched away, immense and hazy, like the image of life, with a glittering surface and lightless depths." "... The ship, a fragment detached from the earth, went on lonely and swift like a small planet. Round her the abysses of sky and sea met in an unattainable frontier. A great circular soli tude moved with her, ever changing and ever the same." "In the magnificence of the phantom rays the ship appeared pure like a vision of ideal beauty, illusive like a tender dream of se rene peace. And nothing in her was real, nothing was distinct and solid but the heavy shadows that filled her decks with their unceasing and noiseless stir: the shadows darker than the night and more restless than the thoughts of men." In short we find Conrad genuinely romantic not so much in plot or setting as in his habitual mood of brooding and melan choly reflection whereby he suffuses over all his action an un certain, magic, and crepuscular light ?the glamor of his nostal gic imagination. This glamor exercises its charm at all times with a potency hardly less than that of The Ancient Mariner. I do not wish to minimize its importance, but when all is said ?and much more and much better might be said?in its praise, not all is said in praise of Conrad. In the very passages se lected to illustrate his glamor and nostalgia we note something else: "immense and hazy, like the image of life"; "more rest less than the thoughts of men". These words are not the ex pression of mere feeling and mood; these are the outcome of thought and the evidence of philosophy. Moreover, the same facts offered to suggest the cause of his nostalgia may be used to prove it more than mere emotional vagabondage.</page><page sequence="11">214 The Sewanee Review III The point is that Conrad's nostalgia was vague and his spirit restless for genuine cause. We have recognized in him the signs of subjective yearning; we must recognize also that he had a good objective. Thus the distinction between romantic and true nostalgia. As Professor Babbitt remarks, "romantic nostalgia is not 'homesickness', accurately speaking, but desire to get away from home", and "Odysseus in Homer suffers from true nostalgia. The Ulysses of Tennyson, on the other hand, is nostalgic in the romantic sense when he leaves home 'to sail beyond the sunset'." So of Conrad we may say that if his nostalgia, as manifested in his writing, seems to be without defi nite object, he had in literal fact no home to be sick for. And of Conrad we may go further, I believe, and say that through out his life he was seeking, often in toil and anguish, a substi tute for the home he had lost. His nostalgia proves that he never wholly found it in the brotherhood of seamen, as he de clares in the Preface to A Personal Record. He found some thing, apparently, in living in England, his ideal land of liberty. He must have found something in marriage, and in the friend ship of men of literary imagination and warm hearts. And he seems to have found most in a view of life, expressed through his books. He does not seem to have come by this view of life easily and happily. Modern knowledge makes the path to a rational spir itual home very difficult indeed. Faced with the disillusion ments of science, the poets?among whom- I emphatically in clude Conrad?can no longer seek consolation with Nature un der the delusion that she "never did betray the soul that loved her". To the children of scientific light the eternal dance of electrons, intellectually interesting as it is, cannot be a human thing nor satisfy the human need for spiritual union with some thing beyond ourselves. Much as Conrad admired the beauty and might of nature,?he never, like Wordsworth, deluded himself that nature was worshipful. Nor did Conrad ever find conso lation in a supernatural religion.</page><page sequence="12">The Humaiiism of Joseph Conrad 215 Disillusioned Conrad was, as is startlingly manifested in the melancholy, sometimes bitter, confessions poured out in his let ters to friends. But it is significant that he was not a pessi mist. He did not, like Hardy in Tess ox Jude, go to the oppo site extreme from Wordsworth and regard nature as altogether malign. Rather, in his search for a home he turned away from nature altogether, and turned to man. He seems to have been driven by despair of all else to a new humanism, to a revival of interest in mankind not as part of nature?the scientific view? but as separate from and in a way antagonistic to nature. Hav ing like Bertrand Russell cast off all anthropomorphic illusions about the world and adopted the "free man's worship", he sought the solidarity of mankind; isolated from the unregard ing flux of the universal machine of which he himself in body was a part, he sought in men and women the consolations of purpose, of justice, of love and fidelity. He knew well that little enough of these human ultimates could he find even in men and women, but except for the groping virtues of some animals like the dog they exist nowhere else. These rare but necessary humanities are found for individuals now and again in personal relationships ; but they can be preserved for all man kind only in that vehicle for communicating our subtlest exper ience which we call poetry. And Conrad embodied them in his romances. In his writing, then, nature affects man, forms a setting for him, but is never confused with him; it has no hu man qualities, either good or evil. Its blind activities some times collide with human will, but it is human will which in Conrad is significant. In Typhoon, for example, the real signifit canee of the narrative lies in the power of a na?ve Scot through sheer obstinacy to conquer inanimate nature in one of its mos terrific aspects. As in Typhoon, this natural setting is often grand indeed, but Conrad has no anthropomorphic illusions about it; at most he allows himself the rhetorical resource of personification, but only as a figure of speech. In that beauti ful series of prose poems, The Mirror of the Sea, there is, for example, a magnificent passage which might be called Conrad's Ode to the West Wind. But while Shelley wanted to identify</page><page sequence="13">2l6 The Sewanee Review himself with the restlessness of nature, Conrad remains consis tently aloof; in the passage there is simply a fine use of rhetoric to suggest something of the awfulness of mighty forces. Conrad, then, does not "mix himself up with the landscape" after the fashion of the nature-loving romantic; his concern is with man. He sees man alone against a mysterious and insentient background, overarched by indifferent stars, blown upon by moving but unliving winds; but willing, acting, and for a time subduing the forces about him, to his own ends. When so viewed, man cannot but take on some of the attributes of hero ism ; not the tawdry heroics of melodrama, but heroism in the great tragic tradition. Conrad of course does not over-rate capacity; if man, as he sees him, is at times heroic, he is also sometimes despicable and, ultimately, futile. Life to Conrad, indeed, is enfolded in mystery, compounded of illusion, rounded by a sleep. Yet though he sees its ultimate futility, he admires the struggle; he mediates between philosophic pessimism and an unthinking optimism. Hence comes his detachment, his irony. Now there are different kinds of irony. There is the still Sophoclean irony of contrast between what is representatively human in aspiration and hope, and the irrationality of human fate. And there is the restless romantic irony of contrast between moods, which results from a temperament centered in nothing outside itself and hence subject to the change. In a Lord Byron, a James Branch Cabell, this romantic irony results from the discovery that romantic ideals are vain, and is the recoil resulting from an objective world breaking in upon a sub jective dream. Mr. Cabell knows that his visions have no objective existence, but for fear of ridicule from an unromantic world he dares not weep; rather he pokes fun at the dreams he still loves but cannot credit. Thus he gives us, as has been remarked, warm baths of sentiment alternating with cold douches of irony. Now Conrad's irony is not of this latter sort, for it is disci plined to reality and freed from the tyranny of mood. It is notable for its restraint and calm; at most it is only tinged with</page><page sequence="14">The Humanism of Joseph Conrad 217 bitterness, never steeped in gall like that of Hardy. "From laughter and tears", he writes in a memorable passage, "the descent is easy to snivelling and giggles." And in another connection he says: "One thing that I am certain of is that I have approached the object of my task, things human, in a spirit of piety. The earth is a temple where there is going on a mystery play, childish and poignant, ridiculous and awful enough, in all conscience. Once in, I've tried to behave decently. I have not degraded any quasi-religious sentiment by tears and groans; and if I have been amused or indignant, I've neither grinned nor gnashed my teeth. In other words, I've tried to write with dignity, not out of regard for myself, but for the sake of the spectacle, the play with an obscure beginning and an unfathomable d?nouement." This passage gives us the point of view?that of the specta tor, not ideal but concerned only as one can be in matters of life and death; not swayed by moods, but self-contained. Thus it is that Conrad's irony, unromantic because of its disciplined detachment from mood and attachment to reality, is made human by pity. So ruthless and sordid a story as The Secret Agent, for example, would be unendurable if the irony of its author were not throughout tempered and subdued by his pity for all things pitiful, his grave indignation at all things detestable. True pity, as Conrad exemplifies it, is the human aspect of justice; it is to be sharply distinguished from that sentimentalism that is the result of unregulated feeling. It is the chief constituent ofthat "spirit of piety" in which Conrad approached his work. Now irony of this kind, touched with pity, if pressed in one direction, becomes humor; if pressed in the other, merges into tragedy. Conrad is seldom humorous, but sometimes at his best he achieves the effect of great tragedy. His human fig ures, isolated from nature as they are, sometimes are nobly and grandly heroic. His protagonists, as has frequently been pointed out, are often extremists in their fidelity to some cause or ideal, almost to the extent of being driven by an id?e fixe. This fact has been made ground for considering him, especially in his Russian</page><page sequence="15">2l8 The Sewanee Review novel, Under Western Eyes, influenced by Dosto?evski. This view 1 believe mistaken. Incidentally we may mention that Conrad himself vehemently denied the influence. Above all, we must reiterate that Conrad's own point of view, in contrast to that of some of his characters, and in contrast to that of the great epileptic romancer, is always controlled and normal. There is no extravagant "Slavic" mysticism about his treatment of human nature; he indulges in no romantic overturnings of normal ethical experience, as does Dostoievski when, for exam ple, the latter makes his murderer-hero find salvation through the spiritual influence of a prostitute. That Conrad's heroes are often distinguished by more than ordinary fidelity to an ideal makes for elevation rather than for romantic strangeness. These are typically simple men; and the ideals they pursue are usually recognized by all mankind. In view of these facts I find Conrad indeed akin to the writers of the classic traditions, for whom the tragic hero must be in ele vation of character above the commonplace though in quality of character not beyond the normal. Again it has been pointed out that his heroes are almost al ways made to face the difficulties which they by nature are least able to overcome. "In almost every case", says Hugh Walpole, "his subjects are concerned with unequal combats? unequal to his own far-seeing vision, but never to the human souls engaged in them, and it is the consciousness of the blind ness that renders men's honesty and heroism of so little account that gives occasion for his irony." Hence Mr. Walpole con cludes that Conrad's "harshest limitation" is that he can "never be free from this certain obsession of the vanity of human struggle." His best as well as his worst characters meet defeat: Lord Jim, Captain Walley, Lingard, Razimov, and the rest. Thus, for Mr. Walpole, Conrad is a pessimist, and there is no mitigation for the calamities that ends his greater works. If this view be true, we cannot consider these works true tragedies. For of tragedy we say that pity and fear are purged, not merely aroused; that a physical defeat is offset by a spiritual victory. We can, I think, say this even</page><page sequence="16">The Humanism of Joseph Conrad 1\0j of so dark a tragedy as King T^ear, for by the very death of Cordelia the beauty of her life is made brighter to the world. The mitigation of defeat arises from the spectator's sense that in spite of death human values have been vindicated. It is the lack of this sense often in Hardy's novels, I submit, that makes them less tragic than merely mortuary. It is otherwise with Conrad. To some of his tales, of course, he gives endings which are not tragic at all; and to some, endings which are calamitous only. I cannot feel that the sordid horrors of The Secret Agent rise to tragedy, or even the utter misfortunes of Freya. Exceptions being granted, however, it is surprising how much of tragic elevation there is to be found even in those novels which do not end in death. It may be said, for example, of Nostromo that tremendous as it is, its title character is hardly a genuine hero, and his death at the end does not yield awe and admiration. But one may reply that nonetheless there is tragedy in the novel, and that it is personified in Mrs. Gould. She does not die, but the spirit ual loss she sustains through the influence of the silver mine is far more moving than Nostromo's melodramatic demise. And again, The Rescue ends without physical misfortune to the principal characters, yet it very powerfully conveys through Lingard the grandeur of a struggle between irreconcilable spir itual demands?on the one hand the claims of his own race and of love; on the other, those of fidelity to sworn friendship and a romantic quest. This novel disappoints or annoys many readers, yet after long acquaintance I can myself confess in creasing admiration for the artistry of its ethical theme. We must indeed disagree with Mr. Walpole and accept rather the dictum of another critic that Conrad is a pessimist about the universe but an optimist about human individuals. The romance called Victory, as Mr. Follett notes, is a case in point. Superficial readers have been at a loss to justify the title of that unhappy story. They have failed to observe that the "victory" is that of the girl Lena, and is achieved by death. It is only by losing her life that she wins the skeptic Heyst to</page><page sequence="17">220 The Sewanee Review surrender to the laws of life. In spite of considerable melo drama the underlying theme here is the classic tradition. Mr. Walpole mentions The End of the Tether as though the death of Captain Walley were unmitigated loss. Yet what would seem obvious about his suicide is its self-sacrificing heroism. At the end of his tether, he has but one way to preserve his daughter's insurance money. He dies, but with our admiration and honor. The case of Lord Jim is less clear. However quixotic and cruel to the woman who loves him, Jim does the one thing that can prove his mastery over the cowardice he dreads; yet the fact that we, as readers, do not feel his death to be altogether necessary, makes the ending not wholly tragic. Indeed, as Conrad carefully reminds us, Jim was "in curably romantic", and in dying made a last romantic gesture. Conrad wrote in a romantic tradition, and the tendency in the other direction which I have been observing never found perfect fruition. Yet it is, I believe, fundamental enough to justify my view that the casual classification of Conrad with romance is superficial, and that higher honors are due him for his ability to rise at times to the austere heights of tragedy. For if he was nostalgic, it was for a spiritual home; and what sets him above the vast majority of creative writers of to-day is that at times he found this home in the best of human nature. Beside his ironic and pitiful yet admiring view of life, the pessimism of naturalistic fiction seems stupid. It was no mere romancer who could write: "At last the presented vision of regret or pity, of terror or mirth, shall awaken in the hearts of the beholders that feeling of unavoidable solidarity; in mysterious origin, in toil, in joy, in hope, in uncertain fate, which binds men to each other and all mankind to the visible world." And after he had known the worst of human fate, it was with an unshaken faith in mankind that he could assert : H When the last aqueduct shall have crumbled to pieces, the last airship fallen to the ground, the last blade of grass have died upon a dying earth, man indomit able by his training in resistance to misery and pain, shall set this undiminished light of his eyes against the feeble glow of the sun."
