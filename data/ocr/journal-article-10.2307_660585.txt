<plain_text><page sequence="1">THREE-POINTED STONE ZEMI OR IDOLS FROM THE WEST INDIES: AN INTERPRETATION BY ADOLFO DE HOSTOS HISTORY M ODERN archaeologists have generally shown a marked tendency to regard the three-pointed stones from the Greater Antilles as enigmatical, mysterious, and puzzling. Dr. J. W. Fewkes' has reviewed the interpretations of these objects given by several authors and has critically discussed most of them. We learn from his excellent monograph that the three-pointed stones have been variously interpreted as paint mortars; representations of the genius of Porto Rico in the figure of a man or animal; as symbols to account for volcanic phenomena; as the genius of evil weighed down by Boriqu6n; as cosmo- theogonic symbols-the Creator and inert matter on two sides of chaos, which extends over the firmament; as clan idols or images of tutelary totems-this last being probably the first step taken towards a rational interpretation. The late Father Nazario, the most successful local collector of Indian antiquities, saw in three-pointed stones a symbol of the Biblical legend of Jonah being swallowed up by the great mythical fish! No doubt the father was influenced by the theorists who, fifty years ago, claimed contact between certain peoples of the Mediterranean basin and some islands of the West Indies. Mrs. Zelia Nuttal2 believes that the three-pointed zemi is a symbol of the Above, and infers, on this evidence, that the aborigi- nes of Porto Rico practised some form of a Mexican cult. Mr. T. A. Joyce,3 while admitting that "their exact use is a mystery," rightly believes, without giving reasons, that the idols 1 J. W.

He has even suggested that the conical projection represents the root of the yuca plant. Dr. Fewkes, in his latest researches upon the subject known to the author (1913), advocates the theory that these objects were zemi-idols. Casual observers have perceived in these stone forms relations with weapons and instruments of torture. Local tradition in Porto Rico, even when speaking through the mouths of illiterate individuals, whispers that the objects were used to aid women in parturition. METHOD OF RESEARCH In approaching the solution of this problem we propose-in order to restrict to the minimum the field of conjecture and imagination-a survey of (a) the historical, (b) the archaeological, and (c) the auxiliary or collateral evidence. By this last line of conduct we mean that, insofar as it is possible within our capacity, we must limit the application of collateral evidence only to those cases in which scientific corroboration may be obtained. DIscussIoN Recognizing the fact that in this particular case it would be a. great error of judgment to ignore the testimony of one whom we have good reason to believe was an eyewitness of aboriginal cults and ceremonies, we will begin by examining the testimony of Ramon Pane. This friar, in the last years of the fifteenth century, went among the Indians of Haiti, learned their language, and reported to Columbus on their religion. Pane states that certain zemi "have three points and they think they cause the yuca (manioc) to thrive."4 This is quite a definite statement, worthy of careful investigation, especially when we remember that, of the thousands of prehistoric stone relics gathered in the West Indies-except some which are obviously utilitarian, like certain flat, more or less triangular blades and a few stone rubbers, having three roundish points-the only class of objects which could possibly be identified as the objects mentioned by Pane are SAs quoted by Fewkes, op. cit., p. 131.</page><page sequence="3">58 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 25, 1923 the three-pointed or mammiform stones. He tells us that these stones were zemi-a collective term which may be translated as "sacred thing"; specifically, an idol, or thing to be worshipped. He adds that the Indians thought that these idols caused the yuca to grow. It becomes then a logical necessity to find out in the historical records-and not by assumption or implication-what was the immediate object or purpose of idolatry within the Haiti-Porto Rico culture-area. Any interpretation based on the religious, social, or political principles of other peoples of the world, even of other peoples of America, is purely speculative. What little we know about the worship of idols in this region may be summarized in the following excerpts, compiled by Mr. H. Ling Roth5 in his "Aborigines of Hispaniola": Most of the caciques have also three stones which they were said to wor- ship, one to help corn and all sorts of grain, a second which helps woman to be delivered without pain, and a third which procures rain or fair weather according to requirement. . . . some [idols] that speak, and others that cause things to grow, some that eat, others that cause rain, and others that make the wind blow. They have a name for every one, [zemi], regarding this as their patron on this subject, and that as their patron on that subject. .... These people only ask of their gods plenty to eat and drink, and good health, and victory over their enemies. Worship, then, was almost, if not exclusively, practised for temporal benefits desired. One of the benefits expected proceeded from the cultivation of the soil. In this connection we learn that certain idols were used: (a) to help corn and all sorts of grain, (b) to cause things to grow, (c) to cause yuca to grow. Keeping in mind the fact that a zemi with three points was thought to promote the growth of the yuca plant, we may infer that the idols which helped corn and all sorts of grain, as well as the one which caused things to grow, may have had the same, or at least a similar, related form. Turning our attention now, for the present, to the archaeolog- ical evidence,6 it is thought convenient to group these objects in 6 Jour. Anthr. Inst. of Great Britain and Ireland, vol. xvII, no. 3. 6 For detailed descriptions of three-pointed idols See Fewkes, op. cit., pp. 111-128; Joyce, op. cit., pp. 185-186; and Otis T.

Rpt., 1876.</page><page sequence="4">DE HOSTOS] THREE-POINTED STONE ZEMI 59 accordance with a biological scheme of development-from the simple to the complex-in order to approach the interpretation of the morphological details: 1. A small conoid monolith, without carvings and with plain projections-that is, without any intentional modifications of the lateral extremities (Fig. 17, a). Each has a pronounced conoid projection. 2. The same as above, except that there are rudimentary protuberances at the anterior and posterior projections (Fig. 17, b). 3. A three-pointed stone having a human or an animal head carved in one or both (rarely) of the lateral projections and the lower extremities of the being carved in the other (Fig. 17, c). 4. Where the head is placed on the conoid, between the apex and the anterior projection, facing toward it (Fig. 17, d). 5. Where the head or face occupies the place of the conoid projection, facing up, the stone resting on its base (Fig. 17, e). 6. Where the head or face is carved on one side of the conoid projection, facing at a right angle with reference to the lateral projections. These consist of a simple or a double protuberance or knob-like swelling (Fig. 17, f). Although the above classification is arbitrary, there is a hint of an evolution in the form of the objects, which it is of impor- tance to bear in mind. As to the differences in the shape of the conoid projection, we note that the degree of convexity varies considerably in the several specimens. Some resemble closely a cone, the apex, however, never ending in a sharp point; some are conoid, some- times resembling mammae; others are hemispherical-semicircu- lar in outline; sometimes, cylinder-like, being circular in cross section, with a rounded apex; a few are flat-topped. Generally, in the more conoid specimens, the apex tips slightly (sometimes considerably) forward. In this connection the following circumstance should be par- ticularly emphasized: that the simpler, evidently the most archaic forms, have always a pronounced conoid projection (Fig. 17, a</page><page sequence="5">60 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 25, 1923 and b). No examples of this class are known to the present writer having hemispherical or flattish upper projections. It is reasonable to suspect that these variations in the form of objects which preserve certain constant features may correspond C 0c FIG. 17.-Three-pointed zemi from Porto Rico. to secondary adaptations in their use. This hypothesis, together with the above quoted reference to the diversity of food plants supposed to be helped by a zemi, allow us to infer that different forms of the zemi were used for different kinds of plants. In all</page><page sequence="6">DE HOSTOS] THREE-POINTED STONE ZEMI 61 probability the specimens to which Pane refers as having been dedicated to the yuca plant were those of a well-defined conoid shape, with a more or less acute apex. Vague as his description is, it could not well be applied to a specimen of the rounded or hemispherical type. Thus, as will be shown later, reasons are not wanting for associating the original conoid shape with the culti- vation of root plants. We have now arrived at the climax of the discussion: what symbolical relation, if any, could there exist between the shape of these idols and the natural phenomenon of vegetable growth? The conoid projection-however modified-being the constant feature, the attempt may then be made to find a symbolical con- nection between it and the phenomenon of vegetable growth. The problem has been reduced to this postulate: The conoid projection is an objective representation of vegetable growth. In the succeeding pages we must devote our attention to vegetable growth, in its visible, superficial aspects at any rate, for we well know that no other could be within reach of the Indian's mind. Being aware of the real tendencies of Antillean idolatry, we will confine our efforts to plants of Indian origin. As relevant collateral information an estimate should be made of the status of agricultural art among the West Indian Arawaks in order to judge as to the possibility of theoretically expecting from them the making of certain simple observations, which we will later on attribute to them, as mere incidents in the routinary tasks of aboriginal agriculture. The Taino (Arawak) tribes of the Greater Antilles were re- markable agriculturists. They had, at the time of the conquest, developed their own methods of soil preparation, sowing, irrigation, and isolation of crops, and they were even be- ginning to recognize the value of artificial fertilization.7 They were careful to select certain periods of the year for planting.8 Whether of insular or continental origin, the domestication of the yuca plant and the complicated manipulation of its poison- 7 H.

Some authorities believe that the idea of cultivating economic plants originated in the Caribbean region and spread thence westward around the world.' Martir Angleria (Madrid, 1892, vol. ii p. 435) has preserved a tradition clearly pointing to the beginning of agriculture [in Haiti] by the domestication of esculent root plants. He also describes the several roots which, during a long time, served as the only kind of food to the original inhabitants. The value of this information on the elucidation of the present theory cannot be over-estimated. It is precisely a root-growing people whom we should expect to evolve the peculiar ideas connected with the development of the three-pointed stone as an agricultural idol. Encouraged by a passage in Oviedo's History, where the state- ment is made that the yautia was cultivated in Haiti "with much diligence and special care'."o and by a botanist's belief in the great antiquity of the yautia as a cultivated plant," we have selected for our little experiment this plant, which still yields one of the most important root crops in Porto Rico. Recalling that Mr. Barrett bases his theory on the fact that the yautia has lost its power to produce seed, while native to the same region-tropical America-as other food plants still capable of reproduction, we gain fresh zest in the investigation as we begin to anticipate a natural sequence of happenings leading to the solution. It is evident that the artificial propagation of a plant which has lost its reproductive power must have necessarily compelled the ancient farmer to watch closely the external manifestations of 9 O0.

Of course we mean close observa- tion for the practical purposes of agriculture. We must insist upon making clear our position. We feel strongly inclined to regard the employment of idols in Antillean agriculture as the combined result of three factors: (1) a wish to promote the well-being of slow growing plants (the yautia's tubers, for instance, not maturing until the twelfth month); (2) woodcraft and plant- life knowledge acquired in the course of the native's routinary activities in the field; (3) his mental subordination to animistic beliefs. It seems idle to accept the validity of any interpretation ideo- logically connecting the idols with complex theogonic and cosmo- gonic abstractions. Let us now uproot an adult yautia plant and see what is going on beneath the surface of the soil, since the edible parts of the plant are the tuberous offsets of the rootstock. Observe these fleshy underground stems with their "eyes" in all stages of growth: firstly, a minute whitish speck, slightly raised above the surface of the tuber; then, as it swells, becoming a protuberance which, forming the bud, takes a decided conoid shape, the apex generally tipping to one side (according to its position on the tuber). See P1. V, Nos. 3 to 6. The well-developed bud assumes some- times a roundish shape, bulging to one side (No. 5). From the apex develops the shoot which later differentiates into a plant stem (No. 6). Long before the shoot has appeared new "eyes" develop near the base of the stem bud, often at the extremities of one of its diameters (P1. V, No. 2). The "eyes" are germination points which may or may not develop into suckers or new tubers in accordance with certain conditions. It is a common practice in Porto Rico to cut up the tubers into "sets" or pieces for propagation. We presume that the method was also known by the aborigines. While doing this, any farmer, modern or ancient, must be careful to see that "eyes" are included in the sets he intends to sow. Moreover, while re- peatedly handling these pieces, the agriculturist becomes familiar with the appearance and condition of the eyes and buds in all their stages of growth as he may show individual preferences in</page><page sequence="10">64 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 25, 1923 this respect in connection with his wishes to obtain the best "seed" and the quickest results. The fact that these "eyes" are germination points scattered over the surface of the tuber is therefore firmly fixed in the farmer's mind. We may now assume that-according to the processes of thought of primitive man yet in the animistic stage-the Indian saw in the development of the bud, which he knew by experience to contain the germ of a new plant, the activities of supernatural forces, of spirits-zemi-upon which he naturally bestowed a human form and human attributes. If the earth, the sky, the stars, the wind, rain, thunder, and the animals were possessed of spirits which directed their actions, why should we hesitate to invest their food plants with a similar power? Most primitive beliefs in supernatural beings are logically (in that state of mind) associated with propitiatory practices. Whether good or evil the spirits of things must be pleased-to gain the favor of the former or to prevent the ill-effects of the latter. For a people incapable of much abstraction, the easiest way to please these unseen forces (spirits) was to make-incise, paint, carve, or weave-their material representations or imagi- nary likenesses and to propitiate them according to the particular form of worship involved. Throughout the Antilles, indeed throughout pre-Columbian America, it was believed that any material representation carried with it the powers and attributes of the thing represented. Is not this the very essence of idolatry? At this point we may suggest that the conoid projections of three- pointed stones are representations of the stem buds of certain tubers used as food by the Taino tribes of Porto Rico, Haiti, and perhaps other islands of the archipelago; that the conoid was made to symbolize the invisible power of germination which they knew to reside within the bud. The spirits supposed to reside within the object were propitiated in order to help the plants to grow. The bulging conoid of the zemi would, by sympa- thetic magic, remind the plant spirit of the maker's wish for large, fat tubers, capable of germination, of fruitful reproduction. It will be seen, then, that if the plant spirit was represented by a conoid stone, the original forms must have been devoid of bio-</page><page sequence="11">DE HOSTOS] THREE-POINTED STONE ZEMI 65 morphic carvings. This theory would satisfactorily explain the existence of very small specimens (as well as some very large ones)12 entirely devoid of life carvings and of which, to the pres- ent, no interpretation has been possible. By a simple process of association of ideas this apt symboliza- tion of germination in the yautia plant may have been extended to other plants. Or, by a gradual process of form modification, an effort may have been made to simulate the entire form of those roots which were devoid of "eyes." There is a specimen in the writer's collection resembling a yam or a large sweet potato. It may well be imagined that, as the yautia-spirit cult devel- oped, the attention of the bohii, priest-sorcerer, was attracted by the simultaneous growth of new eyes appearing near the base of the bud. To him, no doubt, the swelling bud lodged a spirit. But there were also visible points of lateral growth as evinced by the new "eyes"-a process which must have suggested to these sorcerers the existence of vital motion from the inside outwards- laterally-in addition to the vertical growth which culminated in the formation of the plant stem. To this moment in the evolution of the three-pointed stones may correspond Group 2 of our classification outlined above, stones with knob-like swellings in place of biomorphic carvings at the lateral projections. It seems but natural to believe that the mind which saw a supernatural spirit ruling the life of the plant -and which pretended to locate its pulsations in the fecund buds- would see in the course of time, pressed by the necessity of giving an outward representation to his animistic concepts, the head and the propelling limbs of the spirit hidden in the new swollen spots which he had already represented by means of rudimentary pro- tuberances in the early forms of the fetish. Hence the carved human or human-like face and the human or human-like legs and feet carved in the lateral extremities. The forward motion implied by the position of the human figure would have to be expressed by showing the lower extremities of the being depicted in the only position compatible with rapid forward motion for a man lying down on the stomach-the crawling position. 12 The smallest of these specimens known to the writer is about an inch in length- on the longer axis of the base; the larger is nearly 30 inches long.</page><page sequence="12">66 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 25, 1923 Unquestionably the idols were used by burying them in the soil, somewhere within the garden or plat, the conoid projection up, near the particular plants whose "fertilization" it was thus thought to accomplish. At any rate there is historical evidence to the effect that certain objects were hidden in the ground for this purpose. So strong had this belief become among the na- tives that, after the Conquest, even Christian images were some- times stolen from the churches for burial in their plantations. Fertility--i.e., the multiplication of the edible roots of the yautia, the yuca, the sweet potato and other plants-would then be obtained by propitiating the yautia, the yuca, or the sweet potato "spirit" through the medium of its effigy, the zemi, so devised as to convey to it a prayer to "move on" within the bud, that is, to grow, to thrive, and to accelerate the reaping of a bountiful harvest. We must now discuss the presence of avian and reptilian ele- ments seen in several three-pointed stones. Notice, in the first place, that anthropomorphic representations are by far the most abundant, a fact which seems to suggest that the former is the primary and the latter a secondary development. In relation to agriculture, the animal groups represented- birds, reptiles and mammals-may be divided into two classes: (1) those that are beneficial to plant life; (2) those that are injurious to it. The love or fear of both kinds of natural agencies has given rise to corresponding cults in primitive societies. Representa- tions of the first class are the most common and therefore we may suppose that those belonging to class 2 represent a tertiary de- velopment of the plant spirit cult. A study of the carvings representing animals beneficial to the plants reveals the fact that those represented are either birds or reptiles. Many of these creatures are predacious animals feeding on insects, worms, and larvae very injurious to plant life. There- fore these animals may be considered the farmer's friends or benefactors. The West Indian mole cricket (Scapteriscus didac- tylus), to cite only one instance, is a burrowing insect and a</page><page sequence="13">DE HOSTOS] THREE-POINTED STONE ZEMI 67 tenacious enemy of tender plant growths-rootlets, buds, shoots, etc. Tobacco and corn-two plants of Indian origin-are especially injured by it.'3 The most efficient enemies of the mole cricket are to be found among the following Porto Rican birds: the Cuban green heron, the "falcon" (sparrow hawk), the white heron, and the "buho" (a species of owl?). Among the reptiles the various lizards, especially the ground lizard (siguana) are also enemies of this cricket as well as of other injurious insects.14 Of class 2 two animals only could be identified by the author among the many specimens with which he is familiar: a rodent and a waterfowl, the hutia (probably Capromys), and the Yaguaza (Dendrocygna autumnalis), a nocturnal species of tree duck. The hutia, which has become extinct in Porto Rico, was, like the present field rat, an unwelcome visitor of the yautia plat. Indeed, the plant derived its name from the animal, as yautia (ya-hutia) means place of hutias, a derivation which implies that in ancient times the hutia abounded where the yautias were plen- tiful. The yaguaza is a nocturnal bird. Alighting in flocks in a sweet potato field these birds devour all the tubers partially exposed above the ground. Most bird- and lizard-shaped speci- mens have human or human-like limbs, a fact which corroborates the opinion that the carvings are not realistic representations of the animals themselves but imaginary semblances of the animal benefactors. Throughout America worshipped animals were often symbolized by figures, partly human, partly animal. In the great majority of cases bird heads carved in three- pointed idols have long, more or less curved, bills. There are rare instances of birds with a short, straight, pointed bill which is generally seen in Porto Rican fruit-eaters. In a general way the carvings resemble some of the wading birds living along the streams and in the marshes and lakes of Porto Rico and Haiti. 13 R. H.

Ledru (Viage a Puerto Rico, 1793) states that two large species of lizards, over a meter in length, were in his time common in the island.</page><page sequence="14">68 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 25, 1923 Perhaps some now extinct species of the ibis and the flamingo are represented.15 Many of these birds are insectivorous."6 DECORATION OF. THREE-POINTED IDOLS The conoid process is at times decorated with incised designs (Pl. VI). The patterns, in the several specimens, include parallel and angular lines, concentric circles, small pits (cup cuttings), chevrons, triangles, and semicircles. The combinations of some of these elements, in the majority of cases, have the appearance of formal designs used primarily by the Taino tribes for purely decorative purposes. Several of these designs are very similar to patterns seen in the decoration of wooden, stone, and clay artifacts from the same region. There seem to be no grounds, in the present state of our knowledge, for attaching any special symbolic significance to these designs, unless they are interpreted as variants of a diffuse symbolism involved in the decoration of other non-utilitarian objects. However, the relative abundance of complete circles and pits seen scattered over the surface of the conoid projections may bear a certain symbolic relation to the "eyes" which frequently dot the surfaces of the stem bud of the yautia. At any rate, to us the designs seem simply to denote early manifestations of the aesthetic sense of the race in connec- tion with certain propitiatory practices of aboriginal worship. THE CONCAVE BASES One feature of three-pointed idols which is indeed difficult to reconcile with our interpretation is the almost universal presence of a concave base. If, as stated above, these idols were used by burying them somewhere within the "conuco," or native garden, the scooping out of the base would be unnecessary. At the same time, accord- ing to our theory, there is no explanation to offer for the occasional '5 Wetmore (Birds of Porto Rico, U. S. Department of Agriculture Bulletin No. 326, p. 27) says that the white ibis is no longer found in Porto Rico and that the flamingo was formerly fairly common. Fewkes (25th Ann. Rpt., B. A.

The concavity of the base, the furrows, and the traces of resin are strongly indicative of attachment of the zemi to other objects. J. J. Acosta, the commentator of Ifiigo Abbad's History,17 was the first to suggest that the three-pointed stone was attached to a stone collar. He based his hypothesis apparently on mythological grounds connected with snake worship, perhaps inspired by the popular belief (in Porto Rico) that stone collars represent snakes. Dr. Fewkes has refuted Acosta's theory, after a comparative study of the morphology of these objects. However, we think that that part of Acosta's theory which advocates the attachment of the fertility zemi to the stone collar should be carefully reviewed in the light of recent progress in Antillean archaeology so notably furthered by the researches of Dr. Fewkes and Mr. T. A. Joyce. In approaching this question it is believed that an attempt should be made to ascertain, in the first place, whether there is any possibility of associating the three-pointed idol and the stone collar as remaining material evidences of two related animistic concepts. Mr. Joyce's researchess1 have given to the stone collar its present theoretical status: a retranslation in stone of a wooden or archaic form of a zemi or idol connected with tree-worship. With regard to this Dr. Fewkes adds:" In Antillean as in other tree worship it was the spirit of the tree that was the object of adoration, and that worship was more or less connected with the material benefits desired: generally the food that the tree yielded. Also: The many similarities between three-pointed zemis, elbow stones and stone collars would seem to indicate a corresponding similarity in use, conse- quently any light on the morphology of one would aid in the interpretation of the other types. 17 Historia Geogrifica Civil y Natural de'la Isla de San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico, 1866. 18 Central American and West Indian Archaeology, 1916, pp. 188-191.

S., 25, 1923 If stone collars are idols it is probable that those specimens of whatever type which are devoid of anthropomorphic and therio- morphic elements-an almost general condition-are incomplete objects. We must look somewhere for their complements. They may have consisted of detachable inlays or adjuncts of either durable or perishable substances. For what then is the indis- pensable outward, material symbol of the spirit supposed to dwell within the stone ring? Truly, it is inconceivable that an animistic worshipper would have been content with the mere resemblance of the collar to the branch of a tree in which a spirit resided and which he imagined capable of articulate speech ex- pressing thought (Ramon Pane). The dialogue between an In- dian and a tree spirit recorded by Pane implies that the former subjectively saw the human form which animated the latter.20 The spirit and the human or animal form are here so intimately associated that we cannot obliterate one without destroying the validity of the other as a factor of primitive belief. We have already said that to us the upper projection of three- pointed stones is a symbol of vegetable growth-originally, of bud germination of a root plant. But, although we have sug- gested it, we have not been able to gather sufficient data to attempt to narrate the several episodes in the evolution of this intensely interesting group of ideas. However, enough has been done to show that there are unmistakable evidences of this evolution in the stones themselves. It is almost certain that the three-pointed idol and the stone collar are the result of two independent developments, in time and space, of related ideas or concepts. This possible ideologic relation is borne out by the geographic distribution of the objects. Leaving for the time in suspense the question of how and when the two kinds of objects became united, we will content ourselves with remarking that there is a strong probability that certain types of three-pointed stones were, at a certain moment in the evolu- 20 Las Casas (Historia de las Indias, Madrid, 1876, vol. v, p. 437) says that wooden idols were ill-shapen and had ugly faces of grimacing old she-monkeys (" . . . estatua o idolo, de mala figura, porque comunmente hacian las caras de gesto de monas viejas regafiadas. ... .")</page><page sequence="18">DE HOSTOS] THREE-POINTED STONE ZEMI 71 tion of tree-worship, somehow attached to certain types of stone collars. Dr. Fewkes's belief that collar and elbow stones were used for ceremonial purposes inclines us to suspect that the stone collar (embodiment of a tree spirit or of a spirit accidentally dwelling in a tree) and the three-pointed stone (embodiment of a food-plant spirit) may occasionally have been united in magical ceremonies where certain sacrifices may have been consummated in order to impart the reproductive power to other plants than those usually placed under the patronage of the three-pointed zemi. At all events these stones would morphologically supply the collar with the biomorphic elements so essential in animistic forms of worship. Rio GRANDE, PORTo RICO.</page></plain_text>
