<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY VOL. XVI JULY, 1950 No. 1 PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGA- TIONS AT THE MOUTH OF THE AMAZON CLIFFORD EVANS, JR. AND BETTY J. MEGGERS* DECENT years have seen increasing archae- ological research in South America, but little of it has been undertaken in the tropical forest regions. In an attempt to fill a portion of this gap we spent the period from July, 1948 to July, 1949 in archaeological survey and exca- vations on the Islands of Marajo, Mexiana, and Caviana in the mouth of the Amazon and in the Territory of Amapa (Brazilian Guiana).' At the close of the field work the material was analysed, classified, and described in Brazil, and compared with collections from the region not available in American museums. It is upon these preliminary studies and comparative analyses that the following discussion is based; and although the basic classifications and ceramic typologies will not be changed, some alterations in over-all conclusions may be made as the final report nears completion. While field survey and stratigraphic excava- tions did not exhaust the sites in any one area, an effort was made to visit sites in all parts of an island and in all types of environment (coastal, inland, river, plain, and forest) to secure a reliable cross section of the various phases of occupation represented (Fig. 1). On Marajo 15 sites were excavated, of which one includes 21 and another 3 separate mounds. With the exception of three cemeteries belong- ing to the mound groups, all were occupation sites. Four village sites and five cemeteries were studied on Mexiana, and on Caviana nine village sites and five cemeteries were excavated. The distinct ceramic traditions represented at these sites indicated several different occupa- tions on the islands in the mouth of the Amazon. In the hope that these might be explained as migrations from the Brazilian Guiana region, we extended our field excavations to the Terri- tory of Amapa. However, intensive and exten- sive survey and excavation of 25 sites (13 occu- pation, 10 cemeteries, 2 temples) in the regions on both sides of the Rio Araguari-Ampari, a large river which divides the Territory almost equally into northern and southern halves, produced evidence of only one of the groups previously encountered in the islands. The remaining ceramic traditions were com- pletely different. The sequence of occupations and migrations in the Lower Amazon region, as shown on the accompanying chart (Fig. 2), is based on ar- chive data on the Arua, which gives a terminal date, and on the seriation of all sites by means of the percentage changes through time of the ceramic types. Although the sites were shallow, sufficient change occurred in the ceramics, especially the plain wares, to permit the estab- lishment of a sequence. Except in three cases the decorated wares comprise only 2-10 per cent of the total sherds from the occupation sites. (See Fig. 3 for selected examples.) THE ISLANDS OF MARAJO, MEXIANA, CAVIANA Ananatuba Phase. The first and possibly the oldest ceramic tradition on the north coast of Marajo was found at four sites (J-7, J-8, J-9, J-10). All were in patches of forest, typical of those scattered over the Marajo plains, and were not far from the coast near the banks of small streams. To judge from the refuse depos- its, the villages were roughly circular with * Paper delivered before the Twenty-ninth International Congress of Americanists' Meeting in New York, Septem- ber 10, 1949. 1 The work was made possible through a grant from The Viking Fund, Inc. of New York and a William Bayard Cutting Traveling Fellowship of Columbia University and was undertaken under the auspices of the Department of Anthropology of Columbia University and in cooperation with the Museu Nacional of Rio de Janeiro, the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi of Belem, and the Museu Terri- torial of the Territory of Amapa, Brazil.</page><page sequence="2">2 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY 11, 1950 4-I6 0 25 5,0 100 K f LO 4ETE RPS 15 A-' --7X A A 23 A K A T L A N T I C 221&lt; F E DER AL 4 E R R 0 R,Y I 13MA PA C E A n MO)U TH CF THE AMAZON ,&gt;CAVIANA 1 15 3 C 9 Cl M3~.-MEXIANA 2 ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~~~~~- - LAGO~~~~~~~ FIG. 1.

Although these rises are never flooded, they are wet in the rainy season and all evidence indicates the use of a house elevated on piles. The Ananatuba Phase is represented by a distinctive plain ware (Ananatuba Plain) with a hard, smooth, some- times polished, cream to tan surface, moderate amount of ground-sherd temper, gray core, poorly-controlled oxidized firing, round-bot- tomed bowls with rounded or square rims, and thickened rims on large globular jars. At the type site (J-9: Ananatuba) the plain ware was 98 per cent of the total sherds, with the deco- rated ware consisting of a simple vertical bruslh- ing (Carmo 'Brushecl) and( a very distinict and well-executed incised style (Sipo Incised), characterized by zoned crosshatching, undulat- ing lines, complicated jagged and parallel lines on bowl exteriors.

It appears that the Mangueiras culture received a sudden impetus leading to a great expansion. The peoples of this phase swept into north and central Marajo and conquered the peoples of the Ananatuba Phase. The ceramic traditions, and probably non-material items of the Ananatuba culture, were replaced by those of the stronger and more dominant group, the Mangueiras Phase people. Mangueiras Phase. Stratigraphic evidence on southern Caviana and at a site on Rio Croari Marajo, west of the general region of the Ananatuba Phase occupation, indicates these areas to be the home of the group before they expanded and took control of the north and central part of Marajo. Data on the Mangueiras Phase are derived from one village site on Caviana (C-3), four habitation sites (J-5, J-6, J-7, J-13) on north Marajo, and one (J-16) in the center of the island near the headwaters of the Rio Anaja.s. As in the previously described phase, the village sites are located in the forest on low natural rises near small water courses. The pile-supported houses were arranged in a circular or oval pattern covering an area from 25 to 75 m. in diameter. The deposits range from 25 to 85 cm. in depth. Decorated ware is more abundant here than in the Ananatuba Phase, averaging about 15 per cent of the total count. It includes crude vertical brushing (Bacuri Brushed), simple incising, scraping (Pocoato Scraped), and a limited use of red paint primarily on rims. Except for Pocoato Scraped, which increases in popularity from the lower to the upper levels, the decorated styles remain relatively stable. However, a diagnostic change is visible in the two plain wares. Mangueiras Plain is an in- completely-oxidized ceramic with rough to slick surfaces varying in color from salmon- pink to tan or gray, coarse sherd temper, and a gray core. A multitude of undifferentiated rim shapes and body forms, varying from large jars with everted rims to platters and small bowls with beveled rims, is characteristic of this ware, which accounts for 70 to 90 per cent of the total sherds per level in the lower strata levels. Anjos Plain, an oxidized-fired ware with bright orange surfaces and core; smooth, irregular, soft surface; sherd temper; round and slightly thickened rims; and body forms rang- ing from large, globular jars to bowls of varying sizes, is associated with Mangueiras Plain throughout the strata cuts. In the lower levels it constitutes 4 to 10 per cent of the sherds and in the upper levels it increases to 70 per cent with Mangueiras decreasing to 26 per cent. This same gradual displacement of a strong, welt-made ceramic by a cruder, over-fired, weaker ware also occurs in the Marajoara Phase and in both instances argues for a de- generation in the culture under the island en- vironment. Formiga Phase. A third occupation, the Formiga Phase, may be the expansion into this part of Marajo of a tribe from the eastern part of the island. It appears fully developed at Site J-6: Formiga, but has a very short independent existence here before receiving Mangueiras influence. The Mangueiras culture did not domi- nate the Formiga as it previously did the Ana- natuba, however, and instead fades away while the Formiga wares continue strong. The Formiga Phase is represented by two sites on the north-central coast of Marajo which, by location and village pattern as well as by ceramic tradition, indicate the introduc- tion of a people with a slightly different culture. The sites (J-4 and J-6) are found in the plains instead of in the forest and consist of three to six low mounds. The smallest mound was 5 by 30 m. in extent and 1 m. high and the largest 20 by 100 m. and the same height. The accumulated refuse varied in depth from 15 to 90 cm. The six mounds of the village site at Site J-4: Mucaja were arranged over an area 150 by 350 m. Formiga Polished Plain, a highly-polished, EXPLANATION OF FIG. 3.

This decrease is explained by the expansion, from 17 per cent in the lower to 70 per cent in the upper levels, of Embauba- Plain, an unpolished variety of Formiga Polished Plain. The decorated wares are re- stricted to a few Bacuri Brushed sherds, some simple incising (Formiga Incised), and the 2 per cent occurrence of a poorly-made corru- gated ware (Unclassified Corrugated). Except in the two lowest levels in one mound, Formiga Polished Plain and Embauba Plain occur inter- mixed with Anjos Plain in amounts decreasing from 25 per cent in the lowest levels to 4 per cent in the upper levels. Marajoara Phase. The upper levels of the strata cuts at Site J-6: Formiga, the principal site of the Formiga Phase, produced a few sherds of the incised and excised2 types charac- teristic of the Marajoara Phase. The sudden appearance of this ware toward the end of the occupation of a site that seriates above the Ananatuba and Mangueiras Phases and the absence of any such association in the latter, earlier phases establishes the group as a late intrusion into the area. A detailed study was made of the Camutins group of 21 mounds (J-15) located within a dis- tance of 10 km. along the banks of the Igarape Os Camutins, a branch of the upper Rio Anajas. One large cemetery mound, 255 m. long, 30 m. wide, and 10 m. high, is along the central part of the stream with eighteen village mounds upstream from it, one opposite it, and two downstream. With three exceptions, they were all on the east side of the river and were separated by distances of from 8 m. to 3 km. The smallest habitation site, not appreci- ably eroded, was 8 m. wide and 25 m. long and rose 1 to 1.50 m. above high water level; the largest measured 250 m. long, 70 m. wide, and 6.40 m. high. Strata cuts indicate that the mounds were built from 1 to 3 m. above high- water level and then inhabited, with the houses having a dirt floor. Periodically, the dirt floor was renewed with a fresh layer of clay giving a variegated cross section to the strata, in which fire-burnt floor levels containing ash and sherds alternate with 5 to 15 cm. of sterile clay. The deepest refuse deposit was 2.15 m. in a habita- tion mound 6.25 m. high. The most common vessel shape from the village sites is a bowl with curving walls and a flat or slightly round bottom, a smoothed or slipped interior with many crackle marks, rough finger-scraped exterior, rounded lip, an average mouth diameter of 30 cm., and a base diameter of 12 cm. While this form remains stable and standardized, the plain ware of which it is made changes from a hard, light-orange or grayish ware with a gray core and coarse sherd temper (Inaja' Plain) in the lowest levels to a crumbly, rotten, over-fired, oxidized, orange ware with coarse sherd temper (Camutins Plain) in the uppermost levels. The former (Inaj'a Plain) drops from 80 per cent in the lowest levels to 10 per cent in the upper levels while the latter type (Camutins Plain) shows an increase from 6 to 85 per cent. The plain wares comprise 92 to 98 per cent of the total sherds found at all levels in all strata cuts in the village sites. Although decorated wares are scarce, all styles are represented and no time distinc- tion could be discerned between the elaborate decorative techniques of incising, painting, excising (champleve), double-slipping, scrap- ing, adorning, and retouching. Tanga frag- ments of both red-slipped and painted styles are found throughout all refuse layers, with the red-slipped variety more abundant. Strata cuts were excavated in the cemetery mounds of Monte Carmelo and Os Camutins, and it was determined that they were artifi- cially constructed solely for cemetery use. The number of broken pots and sherd fragments associated with the burial urns indicates that burial was made over and over again with no effort to avoid the disturbance of previous buri- als except by the occasional addition of new dirt. Large fires must have been built upon the mounds, for layers and pockets of burnt- orange sandy-clay were encountered in the cuts. The data from Strata Cut 1 in Site J-14: Monte Carmelo, Mound 1, Guajara, shows a chainge in burial pattern (luring the time that 2 Since "champleve"' refers to the production of a design by cutting away 50 per cent or more of the background, the less rigid term "excised" has been substituted to permit the inclusion of all sherds having any parts of the design cut otut.</page><page sequence="7">EVANS AND MEGGERS] ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS AT MOUTH OF AMAZON 7 the cemetery was in use. In the earlier period, polychrome anthropomorphic jars or plain ware jars 75 cm. or more in height, covered with basin-like bowls either inverted over the mouth of the jar or fitted upright inside the neck, were characteristic. These urns contained secondary human burials with the bones painted red and in one urn animal bones, also painted red, were found. Every jar contained a tanga. In two cases, bone fragments-associated with tangas were encountered outside the burial urns. The second pattern, observed in the upper levels of the cemeteries, was one of cremation with the ashes buried in a plain or painted jar generally about 30 cm. in height and covered with a lid fitting over the jar rim instead of in- side it. No jar with cremated remains contained a tanga. The abundance of sherds from deco- rated and plain ware bowls indicates that offer- ings were made to the dead. This burial stratig- raphy corroborates the evidence from the vil- lage sites that the exised, incised, and painted wares are contemporary. The complex of traits characteristic of the Marajoara Phase is more advanced and dis- tinctive than that typical of the preceding phases. The most diagnostic features include the use of artificial mounds for habitation and burial, the construction of which depends upon a structured society; standardized ceram- ics with a variety of well-executed decorative techniques, also indicative of occupational specialization; secondary burial and tangas inside burial urns, with the occasional addition of animal bones and of small, plain, and deco- rated bowls probably containing offerings; houses built upon dirt floors rather than on piles; and several unique ceramic objects such as stools, tangas, and oval, dipper-like pipe- bowls. In contrast to the earlier and late cul- tures in the region, which were primarily coast- al, the Marajoara Phase is restricted to the interior of Marajo in the plains around Lago Arari. Archaeological research in South America to date has recovered evidence of this trait com- plex only on Marajo. Our field work indicates, however, that the Marajoara Phase entered Marajo at the peak of its cultural development, and that its subsequent history on the island was one of decline. A consideration of all the evidence leads to the conclusion that these people originated in an area where they were able to develop the intensive agriculture neces- sary to maintain a higher degree of cultural advancement than is possible under tropical forest conditions. Forced to abandon this area, they migrated until they arrived at Marajo Island, which they found inhabitated by the small and loosely organized groups of Manguei- ras and Formiga Phase peoples. These, they either drove out or subjected, leaving them- selves the sole occupants of the island. Either because of an already existing mound-building tradition, or because the low, flooded plains did not permit the use of the house type to which they were accustomed, they constructed artificial mounds. The land, flooded in winter and parched in summer, did not permit the kind of agriculture needed to assure a constant food supply for the maintenance of such a highly developed culture. Fish in abundance and a variety of small game were available, but to secure them required the expendi- ture of many more man-hours than are needed to produce an equal return from agriculture. With its new subsistence pattern, the Mara- joara culture gradually declined and the last remnants either moved away or were ab- sorbed by the Arua, the only group on the islands at the time of the arrival of the Euro- peans. A cauan Phase. One site (M-3: Acauan), 300 m. long, 10 m. wide, and with 35 cm. of refuse, located in the center of Mexiana on a low natural rise along a marsh, yielded a combination of wares that is difficult to explain. The plain ware of the Acauan Phase (Piryzal Plain), similar in some respects to Mangueiras Plain, has a very hard, smoothed surface, tan to dark gray color, poorly controlled oxidized firing, gray to orange core, fine sherd temper, and a variety of thin- walled, flat-bottomed jars and bowls with thick- ened rims. Thirty-eight per cent of this plain ware is decorated in three distinct techniques: excision, incision, and corrugation. Acauan Excised, 4 to 6 per cent of the total sherds, is identical in motif to the excised ware of the Marajoara Phase but, except for occasional thin red slip, is applied to an unslipped surface. The incised ware breaks into two types: Vergal Incised with deep incisions in slanting rows giving an all-over "V" or zigzag pattern, and Unclassified Incised, including motifs showing central Marajo influence. Floripes Corrugated is versatile and well executed with examples ranging from fine to wide corrugated rows and from almost flat, even scallops to high, narrow</page><page sequence="8">8 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [1, 1950 ridges often interspersed or bordered with one or more plain coils. The predominant vessel shape is a flat-bottomed bowl or jar with out- slanting sides and a thickened rim. The corruga- tions cover the exterior walls, beginning just above the base and stopping some distance below the rim. The enigma is the association of excision in the Marajoara style with 18 to 28 per cent cor- rugated ware. On the stratigraphic sequence chart the Acauan Phase is placed contemporary with the Marajoara Phase because of the copied excised technique; however, more work, lead- ing to the explanation of the source of the corrugated influence, may alter slightly this chronological position Arui Phiase. At the time of European contact none of the phases just described were in exist- ence on Marajo, Mexiana, or Caviana. Archive data support our stratigraphic evidence and identify the sites found sprinkled over the islands, often associated with glass trade beads, as belonging to the Arua, vestiges of which continued until 1793 in Chaves and 1816 in Rebordelo on Caviana.3 That the Arua migrated to the islands from the mainland is demon- strated by the discovery of the plain ware, Piratuba Plain, in its earliest form at three sites (A-5, A-8, A-23) in the Territory of Amapa. Pushed out by the Mazagao and Ariste Phase groups, they sought refuge in the islands, which they found either unoccupied or in the hands of the remnants of the Marajoara Phase. The evidence from 21 Arua sites, including 8 cemeteries (M-4, M-5, M-6, M-9, C-1, C-4, C-il, C-12) and 13 habitation sites (M-2, M-7, M-8, J-2, J-3, J-11, C-5, C-6, C-7, C-8, C-10, C-13, C-14, C-15) permits the following description of the culture. Small villages aver- aging 10 to 30 meters in diameter with refuse deposits of 5 to 10 centimeters are shallower than any preceding phase. They are always found in the coastal forest fringe close to a stream, often about a kilometer above its mouth. In the cemeteries, located in the center of the islands, secondary burials, sometimes accompanied by small bowls and glass or nephrite beads were placed in large jars on the surface of the ground. The only ceramic type is Piratuba Plain, a tan to orange ware with coarse sherd temper and a smooth to highly irregular surface. Contrary to the trend found in the wares of other phases, Piratuba Plain is better made in the later than in the earlier sites. Decoration appears on only an average of 1 per cent of the sherds, most commonly in the form of a row of impressed rings around the neck of large burial jars. Crude, flat, thick, platters with ring decoration on the interior rim edge are also diagnostic. THE TERRITORY OF AMAPA (BRAZILIAN GUIANA) The survey and excavation carried out in the Territory of Amapa show two important things about the coast north of the Amazon: (1) ceramic-making peoples are recent in the region, and (2) except for the Arua, they did not come from or have any influence on the islands of Marajo, Mexiana, and Caviana. Both phases described below arrived in the area slightly before the Conquest period and continued into historical times. .4ristM Phase. The northern half of the Terri- tory, between the Rio Araguari-Amapari and the Rio Oyapoque, was occupied by the Ariste Phase. Data were recorded from 7 habitation sites (A-7, A-9, A-12, A-13, A-16, A-18, A-21) and 7 cemeteries (A-10, A-11, A-14, A-15, A-19, A-20, A-22). The Cunani burials reported on by Goeldi in 18954 also belong to this phase. The habitation sites, ranging from 30 to 100 m. in diameter are usually on low, wooded hills along streams or lakes. The refuse deposit is only 5 to 10 cm. in depth. Natural rock shelters, caves, or artificially constructed subterranean chambers were used for burial. Although some burial urns contained secondary burials, crema- tion was more common. Portuguese trade beads were found at two sites. Two plain wares are present: Ariste Plain, a gritty ware because of its quartz temper; and Serra Plain, a smooth, soft ware with sherd temper. The percentage of Serra Plain increases slightly with a corresponding decrease in the percentage of Ariste Plain in post European times. The predominant decorative technique found on both plain wares is painting in mono- chrome or polychrome geometrical designs (spirals, dots, interlocking units) and horizon- tal bands.

Although contemporary, they appear to have had no appreciable conitact across the Araguari- Amapari frontier. Five habitation sites (A-1, A-2, A-5, A-6, A-17) and 3 cemeteries (A-3, A-4, and Igarape do Lago) belong to the Mazagao Phase. As in the northern group, the villages are located in forest on high banks along streams. The sites were 10 to 110 m. in diameter with 5 to 30 cm. accumulation of refuse. Cemeteries were on similar high places with the urns, containing secondary burials and occasional miniature bowls and European trade beads, buried just below the surface and usually covered with lids. Two plain wares occur: Mazagao Plain, a sandy ware, tempered with sand, quartz hunks, and sometimes mica and siliceous fibers, and fired bright red or brown; and Vilanova Plain, a smooth ware tempered with burnt ash of cariape, incompletely fired in an oxidizing atmosphere producing a slight tan to grayish surface. The pre-European sites of this phase have a high percentage of Mazagao Plain and a decorated style (Uxy Incised) typified by sharp, deep, unevenly-made incisions forming rec- tilinear and curvilinear patterns on bowl ex- teriors. Some of the larger plain ware jars of this period have applique modeling around the neck or on the collar of the jar. About the time of European contact there was a marked in- crease in the use of Vilanova Plain and the initroduction of a completely new style of in- cision, Anauerapucui Incised. Parallel lines, triangles, rectilinear spirals incised with great precision and regularity and filled with white chalk, are arranged in a limited number of standardized combinations in a manner show- ing definite affiliations with the Upper Ronquin and Arauquin material from the Middle Ori- noco of Venezuela.5 These same sites produced anthropomorphic burial urns of the Maraca style, modeled in the local plain ware, indicat- ing contact with the Rio Maraca peoples. CONCLUSION Since this expedition was the first to conduct stratigraphic archaeological investigations in the Amazon drainage, we are at a decided handicap in making comparative studies and in relating our data to other work in South America. As many problems were raised as were settled. The cultural development that we were able to work out from stratigraphic se- quence is only a beginning. Similar research must be done in many other parts of the Ama- zon before we can form an outline of the culture history in the tropical forest regions of South America.
