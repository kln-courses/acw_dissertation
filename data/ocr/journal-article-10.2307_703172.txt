<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW SEPTEMBER 1940 THE HUMOUR OF HOMER IT is curious that, in past generations of scholarship, so little has been done to show the real place of the divine appar- atus in the Iliad. There have been, no doubt, good reasons for this neglect, the most powerful being the traditional attitude of the Greeks themselves, so that even Matthew Arnold followed the lead of Aristotle and 'Longinus' and hardly recognized the existence of Homeric wit, on the assumption that the Bible of the Greeks must be as serious as other Bibles. In quite recent days the presence of burlesque in the Iliad has sometimes been noticed, but it has usually been either neglected or, at least, not adequately discussed.' For example, Leaf in his Companion to the Iliad (p. 64) remarks that 'it has often been pointed out with truth that the humour of Homer is almost entirely confined to the scenes in Olympus', but he is content to add that the display of Olympian passions would be beneath the dignity of heroes. This low estimate of the gods seems not to have been explained until the twentieth century, when W. Nestle2 reopened the question of an Homeric burlesque, and was followed by Finsler,3 Drerup,4 Bielo- hlawek,s and more recently by M. P. Nilsson, in his History of Greek Religion (1930). Most of these scholars, how- ever, have confined themselves to an analysis of the various scenes in which they trace Homeric humour, without much discussion of its place in religious thought. In England the first monograph on this subject appears to have been the work of Samuel Butler, the author of Erewhon, who lectured at a Working Men's College on 'the Humour of Homer'.I It might be doubted whether the originator of a theory that a woman composed the Odyssey was well qualified to discuss the epic at all-whether his puckish wit was not being exercised at the expense of the clerks and other working men who presumably formed his audience. But Butler was quite in earnest; and, as we have seen, the idea of Homeric humour had already been recognized in England by Leaf and others. There is a well-known passage in the first book of the Iliad (493 f-) which Butler rightly believed to be the keynote of the whole Homeric attitude towards the gods. The sea-goddess Thetis clasps the knees of Zeus, pray- ing him to honour her son Achilles, whom Agamemnon has deprived of the captive Briseis. For some time Zeus refuses an answer, but when Thetis becomes urgent he gives an unwilling consent, pointing to the jealousy of Hera, who has bitterly reproached him for helping the Trojans. However, he promises to do his best, and confirms the promise by a nod that shakes Olympus. But Hera knows that Thetis has approached Zeus, and at once accuses her husband of going behind her back, and making secret plans. Zeus remarks that she must not expect to know all his counsels, and a domestic quarrel arises. Zeus blusters and threat- ens to lay violent hands on his wife. She protests in words which Butler translates as follows: 'Dread son of Saturn, what in the world are you talk- ing about? I meddle and pry? No one, I am sure, can have his own way in everything more absolutely than you have. Still I have a strong misgiving that the old mermaid's daughter has been talking you over.

I must here interpolate a few words on Butler's style, because it has a bear- ing upon the Homeric humour. The situation is frankly comic, but the Greek verses have no trace of comedy-they are in simple, ordinary epic language, just as the parody of The Battle of the Frogs and Mice depends for its wit solely on the contrast between subject and form. Butler, however, used the same conversational idiom in those parts of the Odyssey which are perfectly serious; and he has been followed by translators such as T. E. Lawrence and Dr. Rouse. He told me in a letter, written on the appearance of his Odyssey, which (as a young man) I had reviewed in the Eagle (the journal of our common College), that translators, if they hope to be read, must write the language of their own day. But was the idiom of the epic, in any sense, 'contemporary'? Did the Greeks of Homer's day ever talk like the epic? It may be very well to protest against 'Wardour Street English', as exemplified by Lang, Leaf, and Myers; but a rendering of the strong-wing'd music of Homer must surely have the dignity and nobility which Matthew Arnold saw in the original Greek.' If it be objected that this particular passage is comic, the answer is that here Homer utters the most comic sentiments with (apparently) the straightest of faces, which improves the obvious parody-- of himself. To return to the bickering of the Olympians: the quarrel is only com- posed by the lame god Hephaestus, who warns Hera that Zeus is dangerous to provoke; and he reminds her of his own experience when he was thrown from heaven by his father, and fell all the day down to Lemnos, with little breath left in his body. Hephaestus advises conciliation, and acts in place of Hebe- itself a humorous touch-as cupbearer to Hera and the other gods, who are moved to unquenched (Homeric) laughter as they see him lumbering about the banquet-hall. Hephaestus is, of course, the comic figure in the Olympian hier- archy. The limping smith is even called a 'monster' (rrEAowp), who sponges the sweat dripping from his face and body as he labours at the anvil.' The prototype of a human smith (the occupation for a lame man was obvious), Hephaestus found a rather equivocal place in Olympian circles. He was ad- mired for his famous works, but ridi- culed for his appearance, just as the armourer in an early Greek army--often no doubt incapacitated for active ser- vice-may have had to endure the good- natured amusement of more fortunate comrades. Such a sense of humour may seem to us elementary; we have advanced on Bergson's definition of laughter-that the comic element con- sists of a certain mechanical inelasticity, as when a man running along a street stumbles and falls, so that the passers- by burst out laughing.2 But we must admit that the Greek sense of humour at least included, or even started from, this small beginning. Ugliness, in any form, as Bergson adds, may be laugh- able, e.g. a comic physiognomy or a deformity that a normal man could successfully imitate-because it suggests automatism and inelasticity. We re- member Thersites-the earliest butt in classic literature-who was not only a mob-orator, but a 'figure of fun', being bandy-legged and round-shouldered, with other defects which were ridicu- lous to the Greek lover of the beautiful. If we are inclined to self-congratulation in having outgrown this schoolboy sense of humour, we may remind ourselves that the improvement has been hardly won: as late as the eighteenth century, Fielding (who was disfigured by dropsy) took for granted that he would be guyed by the riverside crowd before embarking on his voyage to Lisbon.3 At one end I Dr. Rouse defends his position in Homer (1939), ch. x.

Divine quarrels may be funny enough, but there is more to come. In the twenty-first book the gods fall a-fight- ing with each other, an event at least foretold in the preceding book.' This fight, not unnaturally, rouses Zeus, sit- ting on Olympus, to laughter.2 Ares starts the mix-up, with an attack on Athena, whom he strikes on the aegis, and is wounded in his turn; Aphrodite comes to his aid, and both are laid low by the triumphant Athena, egged on by Hera. Poseidon challenges Apollo, but the Far-darter properly refuses to fight on behalf of mortals who die like leaves. Artemis chides her brother for coward- ice, and Hera, with a smile, boxes her naughty ears-a pretty feminine gesture -so that she flees like a dove pursued by a hawk. Finally the fight peters out, and the gods return to Father Zeus, who is still in a laughing mood (not taking his daughter's complaints about Hera too seriously); and the Trojan war is resumed. Well may Leaf describe the whole Theomachy as a ridiculous harlequin- ade, though I cannot agree with him in calling it 'poverty-stricken in express- ion'. On the contrary, the admirable humour quite redeems it from this charge. Again, though not a strict Homeric Unitarian, I cannot agree with his scathing remark 'to attribute such work to any of the older poets of the Epos is to deny the possibility of any rational criticism in this field'. The work may be, as he suggests, a pre- cursor of The Battle of the Frogs and Mice, which can hardly be earlier than 500 B.c.; but, if we grant (as I think we must) that the divine bickering of the first book belongs to the oldest stratum of the Iliad, we need not boggle at the actual War in Heaven. There are other instances in the Iliad which are plainly humorous, and some that are not so patent, as for example the description of a Sacred Marriage,' which may be a 'frivolous misuse' of the "Epo' yoS~, although Leaf remarks that the passage (II. 14. 153-362) 'is radiant with humour, grace, and healthful sensuousness', and calls it the most 'romantic' in Homer. In the Odyssey, there is nothing that corresponds with the quarrels and fights of the Olympians. But the song of Demodocus, the Phaeacian minstrel, on the love of Ares and Aphrodite proves that the poet of the Odyssey has no more ideal conception of the gods than appears in the Iliad. It is usual to call the passage 'late', and to compare it with the Hymn to Hermes, where that god's adventures are told with manifest humour. But that hymn is no parody or satire. Hermes is a trickster, a master-thief, and the thefts of the child- god have plenty of analogies in the Mdirchen or folk-tales of many peoples; but the hymn is not meant to be deroga- tory. All the Greek gods differ from human beings, not in morals, but in powers, and the special power of Hermes is that of thieving, just as part of the wit of Demodocus lies in the cunning net forged by the ingenious workman Hephaestus to catch his erring wife and her paramour. It is the whole situation that rouses the aoflEa-ros y'Aws of the immortals. The humour of Homer was apparently missed or at least misinterpreted by the Greek critics. As early as the sixth cen- tury, when new and higher theological ideas were permeating Greece, the epics were scrutinized and found wanting. Homeric theology was taken literally; the early philosophers were only con- cerned to save Homer's face and never realized that the face had a smile upon it. Criticism of the epic started with the gallant but mistaken attempt of a Theagenes or Pherecydes to explain away the Homeric views of the Olymp- ians by allegorizing, if they did not adopt the methods of Xenophanes, a severe and dignified protest against the poet's 'immorality'. Xenophanes, in words often quoted, reviled Homer for SCf. 20. 66 f. 2 Ibid. 21. 389. I M. P. Nilsson, History of Greek Religion, pp. 33 f. S. E. Bassett (Poetry of Homer, p. 224) doubts any allusion to the lep~s y,tos.</page><page sequence="4">124 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW attributing to the gods all that was unseemly among men--theft, adultery, mutual deception. Such a reproach would have lost its sting, if Xenophanes had believed that the Iliad was not always serious. More than a century later, Plato continued the protest against Homer and other poets; and, at the very end of Greek criticism, the author of On the Sublime summed up current views by the paradoxical epigram that Homer has done his best to make gods of his men and men of his gods. This is ad- mirably true; but 'Longinus', like his predecessors, seems quite unaware that the poet of the Iliad might be not only pathetic but comic. The nearest that he attains to this recognition is his re- mark that the Odyssey is 'like a comedy of manners' ; but it must be remembered that 'Longinus' was thinking of the New Comedy, in which the chief aim was character-drawing rather than pure humour. Aristotle had already noticed a broad distinction between the two great epics; but to him, as to 'Longinus', the comic side of the Iliad was a closed book, even if he held that Homer wrote the Margites and therefore had a sense of humour. Its occasional levity was for- gotten. But humour had long since ceased to be in the epic convention. I cannot think of any later classical epic poem in which that saving grace is prominent, or even present at all. The Alexandrine followers of Homer were essentially serious: there is no trace of levity in the Argonautica of Apollonius -a fact which may help to explain the modern neglect of that poem. The Romans were equally obsessed with the belief that humour had no place in epic. Lucretius, whose great work was so much influenced by Homer as well as by Empedocles that the De Rerum Natura may fitly be called the Epic of Man, is desperately serious, even in his treat- ment of the gods, where at least a touch of irony might have been expected from his pen. Virgil, who could be humorous in the Bucolics and even the Georgics, was careful to preserve the utmost gravity in the Aeneid. (Young Iulus once ventured on a very mild witti- cism: 'Hullo, we are eating our dinner- tables!',' when lack of other food com- pelled the diners to eat the flat wheaten cakes on which they had put their dessert. But his father promptly saw through the joke: it was really an omen, and must be stopped at once.) The fifth book of the Aeneid is a light interlude between two grave books; but it con- tains practically no humour, except the description of Nisus, pleading for a prize with a muddy and bloody face.2 In his treatment of the gods Virgil shows how far Homeric wit had been forgotten. The Olympian family-with all its faults-has almost ceased to exist ; Jupiter has become, not only great, Maximus, but good, Optimus. Juno is still vindictive-to the Trojans-but she has ceased bickering with her husband. Venus still helps her son (she could do no less), but we no longer hear of her intrigue with Mars. It is significant, by the way, that the Phaeacian minstrel Demodocus, who delighted the court of Alcinous with that scandalous tale, is superseded by the Tyrian lopas,3 who sings an improving didactic lay on astronomy, biology, and physics. Vir- gil's successor Lucan, being a Stoic, eliminated the departmental gods alto- gether; but anyhow he had no sense of humour, and would have failed to appre- ciate the delicate burlesque in the Iliad. The tradition of seriousness was main- tained in most of the later literary epics or quasi-epics of Europe.4 Tasso and Milton spring to the mind. Nor can I see humour either in the Orlando Furioso or in the Lusiad, where Camoens (canto i) describes a council of the gods without betraying the slightest recognition of the disrespect towards divine matters so plainly evident in Homer. Camoens, for example, does full justice to the majesty of the Olympians, but utterly neglects to portray their more human qualities.

Any burlesque of Christianity would have seemed, not only irreverent, and there- fore dangerous, but against the accepted convention of the genre. But comedy-in its various forms of manifestation-has by no means been always a foe to religion. Romanesque and early Gothic art can tolerate, and even delight in, a grotesque treatment verging on farce or actual indecency. Professor John Scott thought that 'Homer, in spite of his picture of the gods, may have been a man of simple faith', and he further remarked that 'the ages in which faith seems un- questioned are generally those in which religious beliefs are most broadly carica- tured; hence travellers to churches in the early Middle Ages are often shocked by the farcical illustrations of Bible stories'.' The pious sightseer need not be shocked; for, since the time of Ruskin and Morris, he might have learned to re- vise his views about the psychology of religion. 'Reverence', in the usual sense of the word, is by no means a universal attitude towards sacred things. In medieval art-to quote from Dr. Coulton -'many details of church carving are too licentious to be photographed or modelled '.2 The fact is beyond dispute that artists working in great churches were influenced by Bohemian gilds rather than by celibate clergy and monks; and, when craftsmanship and the higher religion came into conflict, art often had the upper hand. Early Christian drama and other literature tell the same tale. For example, in the Chester miracle-play of Noyes Fludde, the quarrel between Noah and his wife (who had to be dragged into the Ark) is told with much humour, less sophisti- cated, it is true, than in the Iliad, but not unworthy to be set by the side of Zeus and Hera, with the roles of the sexes reversed. Again, in the medieval York plays, the interludes have plenty of comic relief to the sober scenes.' At a far later date we may remember that such excellent Christians as Luther and Jeremy Taylor gave offence by their outspokenness, so that we need not wonder that the negroes who figure in Green Pastures could treat their God with familiarity.z Indeed, we may sym- pathize with the former Dean of St. Paul's, who writes in Our Present Dis- contents: 'I never could see why it should be derogatory to the Creator to suppose that He has a sense of humour. One meets with so many people who could only have been created for a joke.' Homer, then, is not alone in what may seem his 'irreverence'. To come nearest to the Heroic Age of Greece, it has been shown by Professor Chadwick that divine discord and trickery are a feature of the Edda, while the Loka- senna has some likeness to the epic brawls in heaven.3 The Edda may be the closest analogy to the epic period in Greece; but we need go no further than another Greek-Aristophanes-to illus- trate Homeric humour. As is well known, Dionysus, the actual patron of the theatre, is not spared in the Frogs, where his masquerade under the guise of Heracles, and his adventures in the Underworld, form perhaps the most comic scenes in all Aristophanes. The plot of an earlier play-the Birds-turns on the successful blockade of Heaven by a wall constructed in the air, the gods being starved to submission and only saved by the hardest terms of surrender. Their ambassadors-Posei- don, Heracles, and the barbarous Tri- ballian god, invented for the occasion- are treated in the richest comic vein, I J. A. Scott, The Unity of Homer, pp. 178 f. 2 See generally G. G. Coulton, From St. Francis to Dante, and elsewhere. J. W. Hewitt (A.J.P. xxxviii, 1917, pp. 176-85) discusses the 'irrever- ence' in Aristophanes, with parallels in the medieval banter of St. Peter and other saints, and even of God. I A. W.

Aristophanes, in fact, is no isolated phenomenon in art. Not to mention the frank indecency of the yEqvpLctod on the bridge in connexion with the Eleusinia, and the broad jesting of Baubo, there are plenty of examples in which both sculpture and vase-paintings are highly disrespectful towards divine powers. The limestone pediments on the Acro- polis-to take a single instance in sculpture-representing the monstrous Typhon, are examples of a grotesque treatment that is almost certainly meant to be humorous, tending to caricature; and this view is supported by many vases of the same period.' In Aristophanes himself few deities, great or small, escape, except perhaps Athena, the city-goddess. The gods, in fact, were 0LAonra1UJovE~,2 fond of a joke, provided that the joke did not go too far; so that Greek religion has been well described as 'a friendly contact with the deity'. It may be doubted, however, whether the word 'religion' is right in this context. Mythology is not to be confused with a developed religion; it belongs to the region of folk-lore, and of course is largely, though not wholly, the product of an uncivilized stage of society. Hence it is, I think, a mistaken view to hold that the Olympian scenes in the Iliad are a travesty of earlier beliefs which Homer had outgrown. They represent part of his religion, but not the whole of it. Like Kim, he had two separate sides to his head: Much I owe to the land that grew-- More to the life that fed- But most to Allah Who gave me two Separate sides to my head. One side to Homer's poetic head was the myth; the other was religion-the cults of the Greek altar and sacred pre- cinct. In the later temple of Zeus at Elis the god's many amours were for- gotten; there only remained the fine and dignified idea of the All-Father, by which Phidias, according to Macro- bius, was to add something to the accepted religion. It seems, then, that the scenes in the Iliad may be like the double axe of the Cretan Zeus-a two- handed engine at the Homeric door. On the one hand, there is the obvious humour in the description of divine beings, an organized community with the faults, as well as the virtues, of a human family. The main difference is that the gods have superhuman powers and are not subject to death. On the other hand, besides the purely mytho- logical element, there are traces of the religious side, as when Homer shows that the fates of the Greeks and Trojans are determined by Zeus, and (to a less degree) by the gods in general. It is true, as Bassett says, that divine inter- ference is not essential in the Homeric narrative-' the heroes work out their own destiny '.' Character, as Heraclitus was to point out, is fate. But, whatever the relation of the gods to human fate-and the question is difficult-the broad fact remains that, for the epic, the chief interest lies in the fortunes of human beings, and not in the gods themselves. The gods-in Lascelles Abercrombie's acute summary2-must only illustrate man's destiny. Hence Petronius, criticizing Lucan for his neglect of the divine apparatus (deorum ministeria), was instinctively right. Lucan had failed to adopt the Virgilian 'ministry of the gods'; and, feeling the need of stimulating the imagination which a bare recital of historical facts could not supply, he had recourse to the supernatural in the form of witchcraft.3 In more modern times, Thomas Hardy not only pointed the moral of The Dynasts but adorned his tale by adop- tion of the Intelligences. Hardy was, of course, a disbeliever, but found it im- perative to suspend his belief, as Cole- ridge had already done. But what is the ultimate meaning of the epic burlesque ? It is usual to say that, once the forces of Nature were x See E. A. Gardner, Handbook of Greek Sculp- ture, i, pp. 158 f. 2 Plato, Crat. 406 c. x The Poetry of Homer, p. 222. 2 'The Epic' in The Art and Craft of Letters. 3 See my Roman Poetry, p. 206.</page><page sequence="7">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 127 represented in anthropomorphic form, it followed that these gods must forfeit human respect. Homer's rationalism reacts against the anthropomorphism of the myth.' This view is far better than any 'intertribal' explanation that Hera's bickerings with Zeus go back to a time when she was the native queen of a land conquered by Zeus-worshippers.z If so, why was Zeus himself not por- trayed as impeccable? It surely takes two to make a quarrel, even if the persons are divine. There is the same difficulty in the argument that, since Homer was no doubt an Ionian, Hera- a Dorian goddess-might be 'as dis- agreeable as a Dorian'. The reason must go much deeper, and the Christian analogies seem to indicate that even Nilsson's nature-theory does not entirely meet the case. Noah and his wife are certainly not nature-gods. Their quarrel in the miracle play must spring from the very human tendency to 'comic relief', which influenced the medieval artists no less than Homer, however much his particular notion of the gods may have been due to the proneness of nature-deities to rational- ism. Of course there is a difference between the divine economy of the Iliad and the Immanent or Absolute director of The Dynasts. On this, it is not my purpose to insist; it is enough to point out that both Achilles and Napoleon are heroes-in the Greek sense-and that, for Homer and Hardy alike, the epic is mainly concerned with the heroic glory of which Achilles himself was a singer; the spirits, whether introduced with humour or with gravity, not only serve as light interludes, but (which is far more important) mark the significance of the human drama.
