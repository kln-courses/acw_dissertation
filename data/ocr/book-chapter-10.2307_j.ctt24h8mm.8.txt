<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Chapter 6: Excavations at Yengo 1 and Yengo 2  6 ExCAvATIONS AT YENGO 1 AND YENGO 2  The following three chapters detail the excavation results from the four art shelters excavated for  this research. This chapter details the results of excavations at two sites in the north-west of the  Sydney Region near Mount Yengo (Figure 6.1). The main shelter (Yengo 1; NPWS #37-5-1) has  art (stencils, paintings and engravings), occupation deposit and grinding grooves. The engraved  vertical panel at the front of the shelter has a complex of weathered pecked circles. Prior to the  excavation it was apparent that these were truncated by the deposit. The second shelter (Yengo 2:  NPWS #37-5-2) is located 10m north of the main site. This shelter has art (stencils, drawings and  paintings) and occupation deposit. figure 6.1: locality map showing site context.  terra australis 27 69 </page> <page sequence="2"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange Chapter 6: Excavations at Yengo 1 and Yengo 2 The excavation aims for Yengo 1 were threefold; 1) to determine whether the engravings continued beneath the deposit; 2) to obtain evidence which might establish the age of the engravings;  and, 3) to investigate the contemporaneity of the archaeological components at the site.    The parietal  art was  recorded  in October 1986  (McDonald 1987) and  two field  seasons  were  spent excavating  the site. The first of  these was  in September-October 1987,  the  second  in  September  1988.  During  the  first  season  approximately  1.6  cubic  metres  of  deposit  were  excavated, yielding 10,100 artefacts. Towards the end of this first season extremely heavy rain  caused flooding in the trenches, and made the drawing of sections impossible. The second season  reopened the site to complete drawing the sections, and to investigate the nature of a large boulder  buried in Square 1. Six charcoal samples were submitted between seasons for radiocarbon dating.  Three more samples were subsequently submitted, to refine the sequence.   The excavation questions for Yengo 2 had a different orientation. These were based on the  fact that the art assemblage in this shelter was different from that in the main shelter. Considering  the proximity of the two sites, establishing the contemporaneity of occupation for the two sites  was thus of some interest. The research questions for Yengo 2 were: 1) was there archaeological deposit at the site; and, if so, 2) to establish the nature and age of the deposit; and, 3) to establish the relationship between this site and Yengo 1. This site was excavated in September 1988. environmental context The two sites are located on the east facing slope 250m from Big Yengo Creek16 and 20m in  elevation above it. At this point the creek is 8km south of its headwaters in the Hunter Range,  and 30km north of its junction with the McDonald River. Mt Yengo (elevation 668m) is located  approximately 4km west-south-west of the sites. The Hunter Range forms the divide between the  Hunter and Hawkesbury Rivers catchments.  Big Yengo Creek is reputed to contain water for almost all of the year. While currently  the creek has a sandy bottom, prior to the 1950 floods, the creek bottom was pebbly (Ken May,  ex-property manager, pers. comm.). The gently sloping flats along both sides of the creek have  been cleared for grazing. Many of the side gullies have also been cleared, and many have had  dams  constructed within  them. Only  a  few  very  large  trees  remain within  these  grassy  flats.  The steeper slopes contain undisturbed dry sclerophyll with a medium understorey. Angophora  floribunda (Rough-barked apple) dominates the upper storey, with Casuarina spp. and Acacia spp  in abundance. Native Cherry (Exocarpus cipressiformis) was observed in front of Yengo 1, and  seeds from this species were found throughout the deposit.  In this part of the Sydney Basin the Hawkesbury Sandstone formation overlies the  Narrabeen Sandstone and the Hunter Range is towards the most northerly extent of this bedrock.  The hillslopes at Big Yango contain many sandstone overhangs and boulders. Seven other shelters  with  art  have been  identified  in  the vicinity,  and  systematic  survey would undoubtedly  locate  more.  16The property on which these sites are located is ‘Big Yango’ while on maps the orthography for the creek is Big  Yengo and the mountain is spelt Mount Yengo. The sites have been named after the mountain and are therefore spelt  ‘Yengo’. Yengo is reputedly an Aboriginal word meaning mountain (Sim 1966a: 38). The sites are thus called Yengo  1 and Yengo 2. This was also done to avoid confusion with Moore’s (1981) Yango Creek site (YC/1).  terra australis 27 70 </page> <page sequence="3"> Chapter 6: Excavations at Yengo 1 and Yengo 2  Mount Yengo is the highest peak in this hinterland country. It has a Tertiary basalt (Alancime  Dolerite) cap: the remains of a large sill (AGSHV 1981). Mount Wareng (elevation 594m) is a  similarly shaped geological feature to the north.  The Sites Yengo 1 (AHIMS #37-5-1) This site is a medium-sized shelter measuring 14m x 6m x 1.9m at the dripline. It has an easterly  perspective and is a very pleasant morning habitation (Figure 6.2 and Figure 6.3). The deposit  is dry and the shelter is fairly well protected from the prevailing winds. There is an extensive  pigment assemblage on the ceiling and back wall of the shelter, the interior vertical panel of the  roof fall boulder is engraved and the sloping back shelf of the shelter is replete with grinding  grooves (Figure 6.2, Figure 6.5).    When the site was first visited in 1986, no artefactual material was observed on the surface  of the deposit, although some fragmented faunal material was observed near the entrance to a  wombat burrow at the northern end of the shelter. From the interior size of the burrows it was  clear that the deposit was &gt;50cm deep and that the potential for occupation material was high.  While some deposit derives from slopewash at the northern end of the shelter (and over the  dripline), the deposit is mostly fine-grained grey ashy material of primarily cultural derivation. A  large roof-fall boulder at the northern end of the shelter acts as a successful barrier for the deposit.  This large boulder contains the engraved circles, bird and macropod tracks (Figure 6.4). There is  a slight lip in the sandstone outcrop at the southern end of the sandstone which further acts to foil  gravity and the downslope movement of deposit.  The Art Of the 36 engravings on the vertical boulder (Figure 6.4, Figure 6.7), all are pecked and most are  circles (90%). Two of these circles have a pecked central dot. The macropod and bird tracks are  intaglio (i.e. pecked solid) while the circles consist of thick pecked forms. They have not been  subsequently abraded, as with most circles on open engraving sites in the region. These motifs  are classified as a regional variant of the Panaramitee (following Maynard 1979, Rosenfeld et al.  1981). Most of the art in the Sydney Basin is of the Simple Figurative style. It was thus assumed  (based on Maynard’s classification)  that  this art  should be older  than  the majority of  the  sites  found in the Sydney Basin.  The pigment art at Yengo 1 consists of stencils, paintings and drawings in white, red, yellow,  pink and black pigment (Figure 6.8 to Figure 6.11). The assemblage is large (just over 500 motifs)  the second largest recorded in the Sydney Basin (McDonald 1987, 1990a). The predominant  motif is the hand stencil and there are numerous hand stencil variations (hand and arm, hand and  wrist, finger manipulations). The art was recorded in detail with the assistance of Laurajane Smith  and Warren Bluff (see Table 6.1).  The predominant colour used in the pigment art at the site is white (73%), followed by  yellow (10.1%) and black and red (4.9% each). Stencilling is the predominant technique at the  site (82.9%) followed by engraving (7.1%), drawing (5.8%) and painting (3.6%). Motifs with a  mixture of wet and dry pigment are present but rare (0.6%).       Of the 50 depictive pigment motifs, most (58%) are infilled only; 34% are outlined and  8% are  outlined  and  infilled. All  of  the  identifiable motifs  are  either  black  or white. Most  of  the depictive motifs (78%) are either no longer  identifiable or are generally unclassifiable. No  depictive motifs were executed in yellow pigment: this colour is restricted to stencilling.  terra australis 27 71 </page> <page sequence="4"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange Chapter 6: Excavations at Yengo 1 and Yengo 2 figure 6.2: Site plan, yengo 1. Figurative motifs include two anthropomorphs, an emu and an eel. Complex non-figurative motifs  (CXNF) are slightly more common, as are bird tracks. The CXNFs are in white paint or drawn  charcoal, and are predominantly geometric (i.e. zigzags, parallel lines with an emu track on the  end of one: Figure 6.11). Several hand stencils also contain the black outline drawings of hands  - either the result of tracing around the hand after the stencil had been completed, or by tracing  around the inside edge of the stencilled hand’s outline. This same technique has also been applied  to two axe stencils and an unidentified stencilled implement. These motifs have the potential to be  dated by AMS techniques (McDonald et al. 1990; McDonald 2000c).  Hands are the predominant stencilled subject but axes, boomerangs and other material  objects (clubs, straight sticks and several unidentified objects) also feature. Yellow is the second  most common colour used in stencilling, followed by red and black. There are eight black stencilled  hands. It is not clear whether this is charcoal or manganese. terra australis 27 72 </page> <page sequence="5"> Chapter 6: Excavations at Yengo 1 and Yengo 2 figure 6.3: cross-sections, yengo 1. figure 6.4: engraved panel at the front of yengo 1, showing the engravings and their  (excavated) depth below the surface level. terra australis 27 73 </page> <page sequence="6"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange Chapter 6: Excavations at Yengo 1 and Yengo 2 Table 6.1: yengo 1.

This is the only known site in  the region where a paint wash has been used either to cover existing art or to prepare the surface  for subsequent art. Pink, tan and white paint have been used in four locations covering areas  ranging between 1.5m x 0.4m to 0.8m x 0.8m. At the northern end of the site, hand stencils are  superimposed over the wash. Several stencils (hands and axes) were also observed to be partially  covered by wash.   Black hand stencils are rare. A few have been recorded in the south of the region (Caryll  Sefton, pers. comm. 1988). The use of two colours in a single stencil (bichrome technique) is also  rare: otherwise recorded only at Swinton’s, near Mangrove Creek (personal observation).  Prints (positive stencils) are also rare in the region: four hand prints (one yellow and three  tan) occur in Yengo 1.  The use of non-primary colours, or at least of mixed pigments, in this case  pink (presumably red + white mixed) and orange (yellow + red mixed), is also uncommon. A tan  colour is used quite commonly at this site. This may be a mixture of yellow and red, or could be  a very fine clay mud.  The Hand Stencils The size range of the hand stencils at the site was recorded to indicate the likely age range and  gender of the population participating in the art’s production. It was hoped that this would give  some insight as to what sort of site this may represent. Two measurements were consistently  made for all hands: width and height. Width was measured between the tips of the thumb and the  little finger; height was measured between the tip of the middle finger and the heel of the hand.  The latter measurement is considered the most reliable indicator of the size of the hand being  stencilled, since the former can vary depending on the amount of finger splay. terra australis 27 74 </page> <page sequence="7"> Chapter 6: Excavations at Yengo 1 and Yengo 2 figure 6.5: yengo 1: grinding grooves - pecked and pounded areas. terra australis 27 75 </page> <page sequence="8"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange Chapter 6: Excavations at Yengo 1 and Yengo 2   Figure 6.6: View upslope towards sites Yengo 1 and Yengo 2 (#’s 37-5-1 and 37-5-2).

However a number  of stencil variations are also present. Most of the stencil variations involve the stencilling of wrist  and/or arm, but there are numerous examples of finger manipulations (‘mutilations’) and other  variations of finger position.  Left or right? Left and right handedness of stencils was also recorded: assuming that hands are placed palm- down on the rock surface for stencilling (Table 6.2). Most of the hand stencils are left hands. With  the white stencils and stencil variations, left hands occur at a ratio of approximately 2:1 over right  hands.  With all other colours the ratio is closer to equal. Size Of the 392 stencils recorded at the site, 237 could be measured. Size, colour and side (left or  right) were measured to assess whether particular colours might have been used by certain age  groups. If so, then certain colours or sides may have been restricted to certain size ranges (i.e. age  groups).  Table 6.2: yengo 1. left and right handedness of the coloured stencils.

Measurements from living Aboriginal populations from central and northern Australia17 were  compared (Abbey 1975). The relevant measurements are hand length – the distance from end of  radius to tip of middle finger - comparable to the length measurement here on the hand stencils.  Abbey’s results show:  Men   range = 14.0 - 21.8 cm  mean = 18.2cm  Women   range = 14.7 - 20.2 cm  mean = 17.2cm There is considerable overlap between the two gender groups and the lower end for the range for  males is lower than that recorded for females. Differentiating gender in stencils therefore, on the  basis of size alone, is not possible. No doubt there is also considerable overlap between the hand  sizes of adolescents (particularly boys) and women, as well as the fact that some men are small  and some women large. Also to be considered is the fact that the contemporary sample derives  from central Australia. While this was the only data available, it is possible that the Sydney  (coastal) Aborigines were more robust than this sample18 and that their hand sizes may have been  marginally larger. The stencil analysis however, demonstrates a similar set of size ranges to those  recorded by Abbey.  The presence of babies’ hands amongst the stencils is a better indicator of the presence of  women at a site than the presence of medium-sized hand stencils. Similarly, it is probably only the  very large stencils (&gt;21cm) which could be definitely identified as being male - except perhaps  17Abbey’s population sample included men and women (aged 21-60+) from Yuendumu, Haast’s Bluff, Maningrida,  Yatala, Beswick and Kalumbaru. 18Analysis of long bones has indicated a greater robusticity among coastal and Murray River skeletal remains than  those from the arid zone (Dr Denise Donlon, pers. comm., 1992). terra australis 27 79 </page> <page sequence="12"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange Chapter 6: Excavations at Yengo 1 and Yengo 2 where there was direct association between the hand stencils and male hunting equipment (e.g. an  axe). While men’s and women’s hand sizes, and most likely adolescent’s hand sizes also involve  considerable overlap, the size of children’s and babies’ hands are more reliably identified. On the  basis of a study of the hands of 35 children under four19, the following measurements are used as  the basis for identifying the stencils of infants and children at the site (children &lt;12 years grouped  in a size range between infants and small adults):    Babies/infants under 4 &lt;11 cm    Children 4-12 years 11 - 14 cm An analysis of size indicated the following (Table 6.3 and Figure 6.12: based on the 267 stencils  which were fully measurable).    The  largest hand stencils at  the  site are 22cm  long. There are five only of  these  largest  stencils; four are white left, one is a white right. The descriptive statistics for the different stencils  (Figure 6.12) indicate considerable overlap between the bulk of the stencils in terms of median  size and 50% of the range. Table 6.3: Yengo 1.

Two children’s sized stencils [13.5cm and 14cm long] were also recorded amongst the  white left hands. The yellow stencils and the right handed black and red stencils all have a mean  smaller than Abbey’s mean women’s hand sizes. Children’s and babies’ sized hands were found  stencilled in white and yellow, but not in black and red. No hand stencil variations were made  using children’s hands. A total of 10 very small stencils were recorded at the site. Three only were  identified as babies’; the remaining seven were identified as children-sized.  While the occurrence is relatively rare (4.2%), children and babies obviously took part in  the production of stencil art at the site. While it cannot be demonstrated conclusively, it is argued  that women also likely to have taken part in the production of this art form; the yellow stencils  and the right handed black and red stencils have a mean size well below the mean male hand size.  Given the overlap found by Abbey in men’s and women’s hand sizes, distinguishing between  men’s and women’s hand stencils based on size alone is a fruitless endeavour. From the presence  of children’s and babies’ stencils amongst the art it would seem likely that women were not only  present at the site but also participated in the production of this art form (McDonald 1992b).  The Grinding Grooves The grinding grooves and areas of pecking and abrasion were traced on polythene and measured  in the field. A total of 55 grinding grooves, two areas of abrasion and one abraded groove were  recorded, as were five discrete areas of battering/pounding and numerous pecked marks (Table  6.4, Figure 6.5, Figure 6.13).   The average length of the 55 grinding grooves was 26cm (s.d. = 7.5). The maximum length  was 40cm and the minimum length was 10cm. The average width of the grooves was 6.1cm (s.d.  terra australis 27 81 </page> <page sequence="14"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange Chapter 6: Excavations at Yengo 1 and Yengo 2 = 1.9). The narrowest groove was 2cm wide and the widest was 10cm. The longest groove was not  the widest groove. The grooves were on the whole fairly shallow, with the average being 0.8cm  deep (s.d. = 0.7). The deepest groove was 2.5cm deep, and the shallowest was 0.1 cm deep.   As well as sharpening axes, there is evidence that other activities were undertaken on the  gently sloping back wall of the shelter. Three areas of abrasion (#s 44a, 45 and 48: Figure 6.5)  include one discrete incised groove and two areas where these incisions occur more as collections  of grooves. These indicate the sharpening of either wooden spears or perhaps women’s digging  sticks (McDonald 1992b).    Also present were five discrete areas of pounding, i.e. bruising or battering of the surface.  Most of these occur on the relatively flat shelf, not the sloping surfaces. Where these occur in  superimposition with grinding grooves, the areas of pounding predate the grinding grooves.  Several of these areas have been affected by exfoliation of the case hardened surface in this area  - as have several grinding grooves (i.e. groove #s 35, 52: Figure 6.5). There is also evidence that  some surface exfoliation predates both the grinding and pounding activity.  There are also numerous discrete pecked dots as well as clusters of dots (as opposed to the  pounded areas) scattered across the back wall area. On the bedrock surface beneath Squares 2 and  3, five more pecked dots were also discovered (Figure 6.5). This suggests that this type of activity  may predate the site’s most intensive occupation period, and could be related to the production of  the pecked art on the shelter’s boulder. Pecked dots are a common component of the Panaramitee  (Clegg 1987, Edwards 1971, McDonald 1983).   figure 6.13: yengo 1. Grinding grooves on  sloping back wall at southern end of shelter.

Scale in cm  intervals. terra australis 27 82 </page> <page sequence="15"> Chapter 6: Excavations at Yengo 1 and Yengo 2  One ground edged axe head was found in the undergrowth at the front of the shelter. This  measured 8.0cm x 7.5cm x 3.8cm, and was made of fine grained basic material (Figure 6.14).  One ground edge was 5cm long while the length of opposite edge would have been in the order  of 6.5cm. There are a few remnant stains/adhesions suggestive of hafting resin and the head is  waisted. Both ground edges show evidence of usewear (chopping and battering), and there is a  sheen near the shorter cutting edge in addition to the grinding striations. Fragments of ground  edged material were also excavated from the deposit. Yengo 2 (AHIMS #37-5-2) This  site  is  located  in  a medium  sized  shelter measuring  7.0m  x  4.0m  x  1.35m  (Figure  6.15  and Figure 6.16).  It  faces east and  is 10m north of Yengo 1  (Figure 6.6) at  the same contour.  The art assemblage in this site is very different to that found in the main shelter (Table 6.5).  Here drawings and stencils (40.4% each) are co-dominant while paintings represent 17% of the  assemblage  (Figure 6.17, Figure 6.18). Mixed dry  and wet  pigment motifs  occur but  are  rare  (2%).

Most of the  earliest art (dry black solid) consists of small anthropomorphs (&lt;25cm in size) while the middle  phase consists of the widest range of subjects. These are (mainly) kangaroos, anthropomorphs (all  &gt;30cm; most &gt;50cm in size) and the full range of figurative motifs present at the site. Black and  white bichromes are restricted to macropods, goannas, possums and bird tracks.  Stencils Side and size for the hand stencils were recorded, although the sample size here is considerably  smaller. There are similarities and differences between this and the Yengo 1 assemblage. Left  hand stencils again dominate, representing 65% of stencils for which side was identifiable and  87.5% of the stencil variations (Table 6.6). A relatively small proportion (30%) of the stencils  could not be identified for size and/or side. This reflects less superimpositionning rather than the  condition of the art.   Table 6.6: Yengo 2.

Half of the hand variations here consist of the ‘hand + arm’ variety. The remaining four consist of  two pairs of stencils positioned wrist-to-wrist (Figure 6.19).

The mean sizes for the two of the three main  varieties are all larger than their counterparts in Yengo 1, and the standard deviations are generally  terra australis 27 84 </page> <page sequence="17"> Chapter 6: Excavations at Yengo 1 and Yengo 2 smaller (Table 6.7). The smallest hand was 15cm in length. The largest stencils (n=3) in this site  are 21cm.   Stencilling in this site is a more restricted phenomenon both in terms of the overall site  assemblage and compared with the extensive usage of this technique in the shelter next door.  From  the  stencils’ measurements  it would  appear  that  the population producing  these  stencils  was also more restricted. All are adult sized, most of these from the middle range. One stencilled  axe amongst the assemblage is the only possible gender association. Superimposition analysis  indicates that stencil production occurred late in this art sequence. Black + white bichromes and  white paint also appear late in this shelter’s art sequence. Table 6.7: Yengo 2. Size ranges of hand stencils (where n &gt;3). Colour/side Minimum Mean Maximum St. Dev.

A  total of 483kg of deposit were excavated  from square 1C (1.2m x 0.5m) in 1988.   The majority of the pits measured 1.0m x 0.5m (Table 6.8). The unorthodox placement  (and occasionally size) of the pits resulted from the morphology of the shelter and from the need  to avoid several areas of obvious and severe disturbance caused by extensive wombat burrowing.  Initially the pits were positioned to investigate two separate areas of deposit: adjacent to the  engraved panel (square 1) and in the flat central floor area (Squares 2 and 3). Once excavation  commenced, however, it became apparent that site formation processes were complex. Because  of this and the very friable nature of the deposit, the two main investigation areas were joined by  two trenches. One of these (Squares 4A and 5A) connected the engraved panel (square 1) with the  back wall. The other trench (Squares 3 and 6) connected the central area of the deposit (square 2)  with the first trench. All squares (except 1A) were excavated to bedrock. A total of 123 spits were  excavated (Figure 6.20 to Figure 6.23).   Once excavation commenced it became apparent that burrowing activity was not restricted  to wombats and that surface disturbance was not a clear indicator of subsurface burrowing  activity. Almost all squares contained bush rat (Rattus fuscipes) burrows - prehistoric, recently  collapsed and extant varieties. During our excavation a trap set with peanut butter was used (by  Jon Saunders, Zoologist) to catch a current resident that kept re-excavating its burrow into our  trenches every night. Thankfully none of the wombat burrows were currently in use! figure 6.20: yengo 1.

Two test pits were  excavated (Figure 6.15) removing a total of 494kg of deposit. Sixteen spits were excavated in  these two test squares (Figure 6.25).  Bush rats had also burrowed in this site and heavy rain throughout the excavation period  demonstrated that the floor can be inundated by water from the northern end of the shelter. Two  pits were excavated to provide a good sample of artefactual material. While the deposit contained  archaeological material, the density of this was extremely low. Saturation of the deposits meant  no stratigraphic divisions were observable here. Decomposing sandstone was encountered  immediately above bedrock (Figure 6.24). results - yengo 1  Stratigraphy  The stratigraphy at the site is complex, as a result of the shelter’s morphology and different  depositional processes. Bedrock in the shelter consists of a sloping rock floor. The large engraved  boulder at the front of the shelter retains deposit only at the northern end, and in this area there  terra australis 27 90 </page> <page sequence="23"> Chapter 6: Excavations at Yengo 1 and Yengo 2 figure 6.24: yengo 2. completed excavation.

Several of the layers of deposit  identified are only present in excavated squares at the front of the site. The steeply sloping bedrock  means that at the back of the shelter, the most recent layers are adjacent to bedrock. Deposition  has been accelerated in the front squares, because of incoming sediment. The sand fraction in the  front squares is considerably higher than those in the central area of the site, where the deposit  is fine grained and ashy. Through time, the area of flat, deposit covered floor increased laterally,  bringing the ceiling to within reach. The squares at the site are viewed as two groups:  1. Square 1A, 1B, 1R and 1C which contain the deepest and earliest deposit and have been  affected by soil deposition from outside the dripline; and, 2.  Squares 2, 3, and 5A which are relatively shallow and mostly recent for which  sedimentation is primarily cultural.  Squares 4A and 6 show combinations of these formation processes.  Stratigraphic Layers Section drawings were done for all excavated squares except Pits 1A, 1R and 1B. Torrential  rain (10cm in 24 hours) fell towards the end of the first season before the sections in this area of  the site had been drawn. This rain severely affected the surfaces of the balks at the front of the  site. The main reason for the return season was to reopen this trench to interpret its stratigraphy.  Unfortunately torrential rain again fell and this problem was not perfectly resolved. It would  terra australis 27 91 </page> <page sequence="24"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange Chapter 6: Excavations at Yengo 1 and Yengo 2 1 2 4 31 5 2 7 6 3 8 4 5 9 6 7 0 20cm Square 4C Square 4B  northern section southern section  excavated spits excavated spits Bedrock Square 4C Square 4B ground surface maximum water level Bedrock 10YR 4/3 rock layer 10YR 7/8 decomposing  sandstone Bedrock root sandstone rock No colour gradations observable within main sections.

Individual hearths, extant and prehistoric burrows and ash lenses have been identified on  the section drawings and are described in the detailed discussion for each square. The deposit in the central area of the shelter was extremely fine, dry and alkaline. The densest  layers were rich in artefactual material and contained large quantities of highly fragmented faunal  remains (over 600g of bone were recovered from eight of the squares).  Given the stratigraphic complexities of the site, the high degree of disturbance in some  squares and the large size of the excavated stone tool assemblage, a sample of the excavated  material was analysed in detail (see below). Stratigraphic components in all excavated squares are  given (Table 6.9 and Table 6.10). Detailed stratigraphic notes are presented for the four analysis  squares (1B, 4A, 3S and 6). The correlation of excavated spits with analysis units/stratigraphic  layers for the analysis squares is given (Table 6.10).

Unit III Increasingly compact dark grey deposit, rich in charcoal and artefacts. Many pieces  of red coloured roof fall observed. A rat burrow intrudes into the north-western  face (a 10cm baulk was employed along 50cm of wall to prevent collapse).  20This boulder, the top of which was uncovered in Unit II, was excavated beneath only in square 1C (see Figure 6.28).  This appears to be contemporaneous roof fall with the large engraved boulder at the front of the shelter. terra australis 27 93 </page> <page sequence="26"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange Chapter 6: Excavations at Yengo 1 and Yengo 2 Unit IV More red/brown with decreased charcoal throughout this layer.

These established that initial occupation of the shelter dates to  the pre-Bondaian period, commencing around 6,000 years ago. It would appear that occupation  of the shelter at this time was sporadic and continued for c.1,000 years. There may have been a  hiatus between this and subsequent occupation of the site, although artefact accumulation rates  suggest this not to be the case. The next phase of occupation ended around 3,000 years ago. Table 6.11: yengo 1. radiocarbon determinations.

Occupation continued from this time well into the last millennium. There is no evidence of post  contact use, either in the dates, the art or the excavated artefacts.  Two of the dates received (ANU-6057, ANU-6217) are considered to be unreliable indicators  of age. The former, being located as it was beneath the dripline may well have been contaminated  by more recent charcoal percolating down through the deposit. The latter sample may have been  affected by bush rat burrowing in the spit below (3S/5): the sample when collected was noted to  be underneath an in situ piece of sandstone associated with a hearth. Contamination of this sample  with younger material therefore must be attributed to below, rather than from above.  terra australis 27 98 </page> <page sequence="31"> Chapter 6: Excavations at Yengo 1 and Yengo 2 Table 6.12: Yengo 1.

The Excavated Lithic Assemblage A total of 10,060 stone artefacts were excavated from the 10 counted excavation pits21. Artefacts  were found in all but seven of the 117 counted spits.  The assemblages from all counted squares  were  classified  and  quantified.  General  patterns  in  horizontal  and  vertical  distribution  were  analysed for all squares, but because of the large assemblage retrieved, the complexity of the  stratigraphy and since many of the squares were severely affected by burrowing, it was decided to  analyse only a sample of the excavated squares in detail. Squares 1B, 3S, 4A and 6 were selected  for analysis for the following reasons:  the stratigraphy in these squares was well controlled and clear;  these squares contain high numbers of artefacts, and provide a good sized samples for  analysis;   both the central living floor area and the deeper deposit are well represented by these  squares. Square 4A was severely affected by extant burrowing. Excavation in this square proceeded  extremely careful to isolate the material from the burrows. This square provided the most complete  sequence of the site’s strata as well as five of the radiocarbon samples.    The four analysis squares represent 56% of the volume of deposit excavated (0.9 cubic  metres), and c.52% of the artefact assemblage retrieved (Table 6.13). It was considered that the  21The material from Square 1C has been neither sorted nor counted. terra australis 27 99 </page> <page sequence="32"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange Chapter 6: Excavations at Yengo 1 and Yengo 2 aims of the excavation would be achieved by analysing this sample and that many complications  arising from stratigraphic anomalies and disturbance from burrowing would be avoided. Data  from the sample squares was amalgamated into two pairs of analysis squares (called Squares 1B-4  and 3S-6) for the analysis of vertical (diachronic) patterning.  Artefact Density Artefact densities were calculated using excavated bucket (deposit) weights. The weights of  sandstone  fragments and gravel  (weighed  in  the field) were  subtracted  from  these  totals. This  ensured comparability between squares with varying amounts of roof-fall. A separate calculation  was made to enable comparison of roof-fall components throughout the deposit (see McDonald  1994: Appendix 1: Table A1.A:1). Cubic metre calculations were based on spit volume (length x  breadth x depth) and weighed excavated volume. The calculated ratio was 0.00073 cubic metres  of deposit/kilogram. Density calculations were based on this ratio. Densities are also expressed as  artefacts/kg. The two methods of describing artefact density were calculated to enable comparison  with other excavation data from this northern part of the Sydney Basin (Attenbrow 1987, Moore  1981).  Assemblage Characteristics   The majority  (98.4%) of  the  lithic material at  the site  is unmodified debitage. Almost 70% of  the assemblage is also &lt;1cm in size, and is classified as microdebitage. Only 161 artefacts with  macroscopic evidence of usewear and/or retouch were present amongst the assemblage (1.6%).  Most  of  these  (47.2%) were modified  amorphous flakes  and flake  pieces. A  total  of  87  cores  (0.8%) were present amongst the assemblage. Table 6.13: Yengo 1. Average artefact densities (density1 = artefacts/m3; density2 = artefacts/ kg).

No detailed analyses (e.g. residue or functional) have been undertaken of  these artefacts. A range of edge damage characteristics was identified during the artefact analysis.  This included fine, scalar flaking; chunky stepped flaking; notching; crushing; and bifacial flaking.  Concave and straight edges, and ‘noses’ and notches were also identified; as were the presence  of edge angles (particularly, steep and fine). A range of activities are suggested by this range of  assemblage characteristics (e.g. butchering, wood working, knapping and so on). It would appear  that the site’s lithic assemblage represents that of a generalised site and not a specialised site. This  is discussed further below.  terra australis 27 100 </page> <page sequence="33"> Chapter 6: Excavations at Yengo 1 and Yengo 2 Cores Of 87 cores retrieved, 37 were in the analysed squares (Table 6.14). These represent only 0.8%  of the assemblage. Most of the cores (69%) are quartz. All other raw material found at the site  are represented by this artefact type, albeit in small numbers: Silicified tuff20 and chert (8: 9.3%),  FGS (6: 7%), quartzite (4: 4.6%), FGB (5: 5.7%), volcanic (2: 2.2%) and silcrete and other (1:  1.1% each).   As would be expected (given the dominance of quartz) most (53%) of the cores are bipolar.  However, not all the quartz cores were made with this technique. Other raw materials were used  with  this  technique,  including  one  silicified  tuff  core. Multiplatformed  cores  were  next most  common (35%) while single platformed cores were less common (13%).  Table 6.14: yengo 1. cores.

Asymmetrical (Bondi) points were in the majority (91%); the remainder were  symmetrical (geometric) backed artefacts.   A large proportion (21: 36%) of the backed artefacts was broken, and many (19: 33%)  had evidence of chord usewear. Four had both evidence of use and breakage. One of the backed  artefacts with R/U on the chord also had macroscopic evidence of residual hafting material.  Utilised and/or broken backed artefacts occurred in all squares with backed artefacts. Broken  and used backed artefacts appear to be concentrated in the central area of the site, and most were  found in Squares 2A and 3N (Table 6.15).    Different causes are likely for these different states of modification to this implement type;  i.e. breakage often happens during manufacture and/or use, depending on the nature of the break  (Baker 1992); and usewear on the chord indicates that the blade has been used, i.e. for cutting,  prior to discard (McDonald et al. 1994; Robertson 2005). Broken and/or used points may also have  been replaced from a haft in a composite weapon, e.g. as barbs in a spear (McDonald et al. 2007).  Differential distributions for these breakage characteristics may indicate either a manufacturing  or a gearing up area.

This assemblage may indicate  gearing up activity. In square 3S, however, the majority of the backed artefacts are fragments with  little evidence for use. This area of the site may represent primary manufacture. Ground Fragments Some (17%) of  the modified material  in  the assemblage provides evidence  that ground edged  implements, were used at the site. This supplements the considerable evidence provided by the  55 grinding grooves on the sloping back shelf of the shelter and the eight stencilled axes on the  ceiling. These fragments with grinding evidence indicate the re-forming or breaking up of ground  edged implements. Almost all of these were made on fine grained basic (FGB) material; with one  exception was a coarser grained basic (in spit 6/8). All grinding is located on the dorsal surface of  the flakes. None of these artefacts has subsequent retouch or usewear. Several have evidence of  hafting material adhering to the old surface. One complete and very battered axe was located at  the front of the site in the undergrowth (see section 3 above and Figure 6.14).  Other Implement Types The other formal implement types identified was the scraper. A total of eight of these were located,  one of which (from 3S/2) has evidence of residual hafting and is very worn down on its distal end.  Three of these tools are thumbnail scrapers (all quartz; one from spit 4A/6; two from spit 6/8).  Hafting Residue Six artefacts in the assemblage have macroscopic evidence of residue suggestive of gum or resin  hafting. This residue was identified on a range of artefact types: the surface ground edged axe, two  backed artefacts, one scraper and two amorphous retouched artefacts. This material has not been  analysed in detail but is certainly worthy of further investigation. Residue which may be blood  was also identified on three artefacts. Macroscopic plant residue was identified on one fragment  of ground edged material.  The Analysis Squares The two analysis Squares (1B-4 and 3S-6) contained 1,451 and 3,383 artefacts respectively (Table  6.16). Of these 547 and 1,017 were &gt;1cm (Table 6.17). Assemblage Characteristics As with the total assemblage, the majority of the material in these analysed squares consists of  unmodified debitage. Most of the 4,834 artefacts are unmodified debitage and most are &lt;1cm in  size.  Raw Material The dominant  raw material  in  each  sample was  quartz  (56% and 55%)  followed by  silicified  tuff (17% and 15%) and quartzite (9% and 11%). The other raw materials classified amongst the  assemblage - silcrete, fine grained basic (FGB), fine grained siliceous (FGS), volcanic and ‘other’  made up the remainder of the assemblage (18% and 19% in the two squares). The proportions of  raw materials in the two squares are relatively equal and they remain consistent regardless of size  (Table 6.18 ; Figure 6.31 and Figure 6.32). terra australis 27 102 </page> <page sequence="35"> Chapter 6: Excavations at Yengo 1 and Yengo 2 Size The majority (67.5%) of the non-modified artefactual material found at the site is &lt;1cm long.

Table 6.19 and  Table 6.20). Most modified artefacts and cores (69%) are in the 1-3cm category and the next most  common size range is 3-5cm (20.4%). Only nine of these artefacts (8%) are in the &lt;1cm size  range and two artefacts are larger than 5cm. Three of the modified artefacts in the &lt;1cm range are  distal tip fragments of backed artefacts. The largest artefact at the site is a large quartzite pebble  chopper (9.5cm maximum dimension) found in spit 1B4/11.   The fact that such a large proportion of the assemblage is &lt;1cm indicates that knapping  was common at the site. The shattering properties of quartz and predominance of the bipolar  knapping techniques are also contributing factors. Much of the increase in artefact deposition  rates over time is likely to be due to the higher proportions of bipolar quartz in the upper levels  (Hiscock 1986). This possibility, and distance to raw material resources (another potential cause  for decreased artefact size) is investigated further below.

All artefacts. Artefact Types The two analysis squares contain 25 backed artefacts, 46 artefacts with retouch/usewear (including  ground fragments) and 35 cores. These artefacts indicate different raw material preference. Some  of these differences were marked in contrast to the general assemblage raw material proportions  (see above).   The raw materials used for cores show the greatest similarity to the general raw material  proportions:  quartz  dominates  (cf.  Figure  6.31  and Figure  6.33). The  dominance  of  quartz  in  the assemblage generally, and  in  the cores,  reflects  the dominance of bipolar knapping during  the later occupation of the site. In contrast, no silcrete cores were found in the assemblage and  the proportions of the less common materials do not match those demonstrated by the general  assemblage. This indicates that the import and knapping of some materials (such as silcrete) at  the site must have occurred only rarely. Given the high numbers of silcrete backed artefacts in the  assemblage, this finding is significant.   Most (43%) of the cores in the two analysis squares are bipolar, followed by multiplatformed  (40.5%) and single platformed cores (16%). Half of the single platformed cores are blade cores.  Some of the multiplatformed cores were identified as being multi directional - and are possibly  the  type  identified  by  Baker  (1992)  in  the  Hunter  River  central  lowlands  as  representing  an  alternating knapping technique - one of a number of strategies used for blade production (and see  also Hiscock 1986, 1993).    Backed artefacts reveal a significantly different and more restricted range of raw material  preference than any other artefact class (cf. Figure 6.31 and Figure 6.33). Quartzite, silicified tuff  and silcrete predominate, followed by quartz and then FGS. Volcanic materials, FGB and ‘other’  raw materials have not been used for this artefact type. terra australis 27 105 </page> <page sequence="38"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange Chapter 6: Excavations at Yengo 1 and Yengo 2  Square 1B-4 50  45  40  35  30  %f 25  20  15  10  5  0  Raw Materials  Square 3S-6 figure 6.32: yengo 1.  50 proportions of raw materials  45 in the two analysis squares.  40 Artefacts &gt;1cm. 35  30  %f 25  20  15  10  5  0  Raw Materials  Key:  - quartz quartzite  silcrete FGS  silicified tuff volcanic  FGB other  Three only of the backed blades were symmetrical, the remainder were asymmetrical.

The one whole backed artefact smaller than this was a triangular symmetrical piece  (measuring 0.9cm x 0.8cm x 0.3cm) from 3S/5. This too was made of silicified tuff.    Artefacts with R/U also show a significant difference in raw material usage (cf. Figure 6.31  and Figure 6.33). FGB predominates (thanks to the 10 fragments with ground facets), followed  closely by silicified tuff and quartzite. Quartz, silcrete, FGS and volcanic materials follow. ‘Other’  raw materials have not been utilised. These findings suggest several things.

This  suggests  that  the  general  assemblage  proportions  then  do  not  necessarily  reflect  the  intent of lithic manufacture and use at the site, but perhaps the flaking characteristics of  certain raw materials (Hiscock 1986). Another possible interpretation is that local raw  materials were used for certain, non-specific tasks while exotic raw materials were used  for selected tasks (as represented by formalised tool types);  some backed blades (particularly the silcrete and quartzite ones) were not made on  the site, but were brought there, perhaps for replacement in a ‘gearing up’ situation, or  perhaps as trade items;  if cores of silcrete were brought to the site for knapping of that material, these were  removed subsequently, perhaps for use elsewhere; and,  silicified tuff was a preferred raw material for generalised tools: more than 25% of the  artefacts with r/u were made of silicified tuff while  this raw material only represents  15% of the assemblage &gt;1cm.  Vertical Distribution of Material The discussion of vertical patterning at the site is restricted to the data from the two paired analysis  squares. The artefactual material at the site was found to be unevenly distributed throughout the  vertical sequence. terra australis 27 107 </page> <page sequence="40"> Dreamtime Superhighway: an analysis of Sydney Basin rock art and prehistoric information exchange Chapter 6: Excavations at Yengo 1 and Yengo 2 figure 6.34:  yengo 1 Square  1B-4.

Artefact deposition rates  An age-depth curve was calculated (Figure 6.37), although there were some concerns about the  utility of this due the complexity of the deposit, the sloping bedrock of the shelter and variable  deposition factors (cultural, natural). It cannot be assumed that the rate of deposition throughout  the sequence or across the site was constant, since the area being deposited over laterally increased  with time. As most of the dates were submitted from square 4A, the analytical units from this  square were used to make this calculation. The reliable upper date from square 2B was used to  provide perspective on this more recent deposit. Artefact totals are from the combined 1B/4A  analysis square (Table 6.21).    The artefact accumulation rate demonstrated (Figure 6.38) is similar to that achieved using  density and percentage frequency measures (cf. Figure 6.34 and Figure 6.35). The most intensive  periods of artefact accumulation occurs in Layers III and IV. Rates are extremely low in the upper  and lower layers. Artefact accumulation rates suggest a hiatus in site usage between the earliest  and the main occupation. It is tempting to accept the age-depth interpretation, as it relates to this  hiatus, given the similarity in the patterning between the age/depth results and the density measures  throughout the sequence. Given concerns about the validity of this method at this particular site,  this potential hiatus is explored further using other components of the assemblage. The dates for  the sequence support a hiatus between the early and middle Bondaian phases of occupation. terra australis 27 109 </page> <page sequence="42">
