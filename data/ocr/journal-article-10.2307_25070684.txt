<plain_text><page sequence="1">HUMOR IN THE COLONIAL PROMOTIONAL TRACT: TOPICS AND TECHNIQUES Leslie A. Wardenaar UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES Humor in colonial promotional literature has provoked some notice but little critical analysis. Cultural or literary historians (e.g., Howard Mumford Jones,1 Moses Coit Tyler2), critics of travel literature (e.g., Percy G. Adams3), students of early American folklore (e.g., James R. Masterson4), and critics of individual writers (e.g., A. L. Diket of John Lawson,5 J. A. Leo Lemay of Andrew White and George Alsop,6 Percy G. Adams of William Byrd7), have focused in passing on many of the humorous tales and witty passages that appear in literature designed to promote colo nization. But while all of these studies have expanded critical aware ness of humor in promotional literature, none of them deals primarily with either the promotional tract or humor, none suggests the range of humorous methods and topics, and none examines the inherent re lationship between humor and the promoters' execution of their pri mary task. Thus, a more specialized, fuller study of the subjects, tech niques, and underlying motivation of promotional humor seems to be called for. In undertaking such a study, I hope to contribute to an understanding, first, of the promotional genre itself, and second, of the American consciousness in its early stages of development. I have selected for this study five promotional works: William Wood's New England Prospect (1634), a straightforward narrative account of New England's natural features, animals, and Indians; John Josselyn's New England Rareties Discovered (1672), a syste matic description of New England's flora and fauna, and An Account of Two Voyages to New England (i675), a diary and travel account of the colony; George Alsop's A Character of the Province of Mary land (i666), an account, spiced with sarcasm, of Maryland's phys ical, social, and economic attractions; John Lawson's A New Voyage to Carolina (I709), a travel journal, a natural history, and a socio economic survey of life in North Carolina. Certainly this list could</page><page sequence="2">Humor in the Promotional Tract 287 be expanded. Ralph Hamor's A True Discourse of the Present State of Virginia (1615), John Smith's A Map of Virginia (1612) and A Description of New England (1616), and Andrew White's A Rela tion of the Successful Beginnings of Lord Baltimore's Plantation in Mary-land (1634) exhibit some features of promotional humor in their early stages of development, while Thomas Budd's Good Order Established in Pennsylvania and New Jersey (I685), Robert Bev erly's The History and Present State of Virginia (1705), and William Byrd's History of the Dividing Line betwixt Virginia and North Caro lina Run in the Year 1728 (along with the Secret History8) ex hibit those features in their middle-to-late stages. But this study is necessarily limited in space, and a more extensive survey would be at the sacrifice of close analysis. Thus, I have chosen for careful exami nation works that display enough variation in style, methodology, colo nial region, and period of composition to establish the general patterns of humorous techniques and topics in promotional literature-pat terns that can, in turn, be seen in other promotional works. The simplest way to approach the chosen writers' uses of humor is to begin with the topics that all of them treat. Four basic sub jects appear in all five tracts: America's social and economic pros pects, vegetation and natural resources, animal life, and Indians. If one examines the humor that accompanies these four topics, interest ing patterns begin to emerge, most of which seem to reflect the pro moters' purpose and audience: America's social and economic pros pects, the most crucial and naturally serious topics the writers must handle, provoke little humor; America's plants and resources en courage a more openly playful attitude but limit, by their own lack of complexity, the range of the writers' comic inventiveness; American wildlife, fascinating but unfamiliar to the English audience and in volving behavior as well as simple existence, offers more comic possi bilities; Indian life, most fascinating to an English audience and in volving complex patterns of behavior, affords the promoter the greatest diversity in humorous perspectives. This study, then, will be organized according to these four topics, with special emphasis on repeated de vices or motifs of humor such as the tall tale. One especially delight ful device-the humorous analogy designed especially for the Eng lish audience-will receive separate consideration. The new world's economic and social prospects are not a pro ductive source of humor. America as the land of economic and social opportunity is, of course, the most crucial theme and most potent weapon of all colonial promoters, and these writers rarely risk the misunderstanding or non-serious consideration of the "land of oppor</page><page sequence="3">288 Early American Literature, IX, 1975 tunity" appeal in its explicit forms by treating it with too great or open levity. Indeed, Alsop alone openly jokes about the opportunity appeal, as he encouragingly reports the prospects of the indentured fe male: "The women that go over into this Province as Servants, have the best luck here as any place of the world besides; for they are no sooner on shoar but they are courted into a Copulative Matrimony, which some of them (for aught I know) had they not come to such a Market with their Virginity, might have kept it by them untill it had been mouldy."9 The sexual candor and market-place diction con tribute ribald humor to this passage, while the anticipation of the bait ed outrage or enthusiasm from certain portions of the English read ing public heightens the comedy for those sophisticates able to appre ciate Alsop's intent. But the more sophisticated humor derives from Alsop's unexpected advancement of this particular prospect within the familiar rhetorical structure of the "land of opportunity" appeal. With this preposterous (though in some ways serious) enticement to colonization, Alsop burlesques the rhetorical enthusiasm of his fel low promoters by taking the tendency to find encouraging opportunity in virtually every aspect of American life to a ridiculous extreme. Burlesque of the social and economic opportunity theme does not, however, typify even Alsop. Dedicating significant portions of his tract explicitly to this theme, he generally treats it with an impassioned seriousness similar to that of the other writers. This general tone of seriousness contrasts with the simple comic embellishment that frequently accompanies the opportunity theme in a related, less direct form: the promise of the American land itself (e.g., fecundity, climate, natural resources). Wood's claim that New England's grass will grow from seed to a foot high in two weeks10 and Josselyn's report of radishes "as big as a man's arm"'' exem plify the tendency toward humorous exaggeration in describing the fecundity of the American soil. Lawson uses a more sophisticated humor of exaggeration as he discusses Carolina's peach trees: "Eat ing Peaches in our Orchards makes them come up so thick from the kernal that we are forced to take a great deal of care to weed them out; otherwise they make our Lands a Wilderness of Peach trees."12 Since the peach probably appealed to the English imagination as a particularly lush and exotic fruit, Lawson's exaggerations of peach tree growth and productivity in Carolina immediately suggest a garden paradise. Lawson plays upon that anticipated image in the English mind to humorous effect by adopting a tone of mock concern and complaint over the horticultural nuisance created by the land's excessive fecundity. Answering his audience's implicit envy in a com</page><page sequence="4">Humor in the Promotional Tract 289 plaining tone that suggests failure to appreciate his luxuries, Law son uses a gently teasing humor to heighten his readers' impression of the land's fecundity and the life of luxury promised by it. Alsop similarly combines humor, the fecundity theme, and the image of America as a garden paradise: "The Trees, Plants, Fruits, Flowers, and Roots . . . by their dumb vegetable oratory, each hour speak to the Inhabitant in silent acts, that they need not look for any other Terrestrial Paradice to suspend or tyre their curiosity upon, while she is extant" (33). The idea of Maryland's plants using silent "vegetable oratory" to convince the colonist of his presence in a new Garden of Eden achieves genuine humor from the simple, incongruous attribu tion of human capacities to vegetation. And the brimming sense of confidence and pride that the plants' particular brand of rhetoric ex udes further heightens the humor and strengthens the promotional appeal. Other, non-vegetative resources of the American land also re ceive humorous exaggeration. Josselyn's report of an American ruby large enough to light a room by refracting the moonlight humorously illustrates the "land of riches" theme,l3 and Lawson's brief anec dote about a Frenchman who stumbled down an embankment while retrieving his dog and uncovered a tremendously rich coal mine in the process (119), humorously suggests the eagerness of the American land to expose its resources, a suggestion heightened by Lawson's matter-of-fact, almost indifferent tone. The abundance and purity of the drinking water elicits Wood's praise in humorous tones: "It is thought there can be no better water in the world, yet dare I not preferre it before good Beere, as some have done, but any man will choose it before bad Beere, Wheay, or Buttermilke" (I5). Select ing as evaluative standards beverages likely to represent the extremes of tastiness to the typical male Englishman, Wood establishes a tone of humorous familiarity with his reader that lends credence to his claim of the water's high quality. Even the weather receives humorous treatment in at least two accounts. The extremity of New England's climate was a potential deterrent to colonization, and Wood and Josselyn attempt to gloss over this possible drawback by humorously exploiting its positive features. Wood argues that the extreme weather of each season makes its counterpart that much more pleasant, and he cleverly arranges his language to attack the "non-committal" qualities of the English cli mate: "In a word, both Summer and Winter is [sic] more commended of the English there than the Summer Winters and Winter Summers of England" (9). Josselyn advances a similar argument in Two Voy</page><page sequence="5">290 Early American Literature, IX, 1975 ages with the added tongue-in-cheek comment that the greater heat of the sun in New England draws heat from the body and enables the Englishman to drink comfortably a much greater quantity of bran dy there than in England (243). This lightly comic logic entertains the reader and simultaneously draws his attention away from a pos sibly detractive feature of New England life. The diverse elements that constitute America's inert natural fea tures, coupled with the writers' styles of presentation, insure a certain variety in the promoters' humorous treatment of the "land of plenty" theme. But the very inertness of those elements limits the treatment to a single mode: descriptive exaggeration or misrepresentation. Amer ica's wildlife also invites descriptive exaggeration, but its inherent characteristics as a promotional subject give rise to greater diversity and complexity in comic treatment. First, the animal account is less central than the "land of plenty" theme to the promoter's primary purpose, and thus invites free exercise of the writer's comic inventive ness with less risk of offending the reader's serious interest in the prospects of colonization. Second, while the English reader's probable familiarity with vegetation and natural resources imposes some limits on his credulity in these matters, his curiosity and ignorance about American wildlife leave him more vulnerable to the clever Ameri can reporter. These two factors encourage the promoter to take comic advantage of his audience and thus to tease it repeatedly with misrep resentational accounts of animals. Third, the very "animation" of animal life not only affords the promoter greater range in his exagger ations (i.e., to appearance is added behavior), but also offers him the narrative or anecdotal mode of presentation, thus opening up another major pattern of humor: anthropomorphic humor, which depends on similarities between animal and human behavior. Josselyn fills New England Rareties Discovered with animal cari catures, ranging from slight truth-stretching to obvious tall tales. Ap pearing within a straightforward, accurate description and classifi cation of New England's flora and fauna, a pond frog as large as a year-old child (38), a moose twelve feet in height with a horn spread of equal length (I9), a goose with three hearts (9), and a wild cat containing six whole geese in its belly (i6), add a lightly humorous accent to Josselyn's otherwise serious reports. Two animals receive a more extreme degree of misrepresentation. The "maccarib" (caribou) in Josselyn's report suddenly acquires a set of horns extending to "the rump" and back again past the nose and a straight horn protruding from the center of its head (20). Josselyn asserts that the wings of "the troculus bird" (the chimney swallow) are equipped with special</page><page sequence="6">Humor in the Promotional Tract 291 pikes for attaching the bird to a chimney and adds that the bird throws one of its offspring down the chimney as an expression of gratitude to the chimney's owner for the term of occupancy (7). Exaggerations and misrepresentations of this degree indicate that Josselyn is spoof ing the gullibility of at least part of his anticipated audience. And the reader who possesses the knowledge or alertness to perceive the falsity of the report can appreciate the twofold humor: the simple amusement of a tall tale and the burlesqued gullibility of the less aware audience. The animal tall tale appears in the other tracts as well. In Two Voyages, Josselyn's descriptions of a whale with a spout like "a river of water" who makes the sea a bubbling vortex to draw any nearby ships into oblivion (215), and Wood's crane who is as tall as a man (32) and his deer capable of leaping sixty feet in a single bound (23), expand the range of animals whose appearance and demeanor are mis represented for comic effect. In addition, Lawson, Josselyn, and Wood all play with a long-standing English fascination when they report the rumored presence of the kingly lion on American soil. Al though the promoter typically modifies this tall tale by hinting that he himself may have been a victim of a native's fabrication or identifi cation of some other animal (e.g., mountain lion) as a "real" lion, he still anticipates, with some amusement, the excitement of the Eng lish reader as he imagines African lions roaming through America's forests. More detailed than the previous examples is Wood's humor ous account of the New England wildcat's hunting tactics: " . . . being much of the colour of a Goose he will place himself close by the wa ter, holding up his bob taile, which is like a Goose necke; the Geese seeing this counterfet Goose, approach nigh to visit him who with a suddaine jerke apprehends his mistrustlesse prey" (24). This patent non-truth, delivered with deadpan seriousness and within a context of accurate observation, illustrates the genuinely comic possibilities of the animal tall tale. Wood's wildcat and Josselyn's troculus bird accounts make use of misrepresentation to poke fun at English gullibility, but both also illustrate a second major variety of animal humor, anthropomorphic humor. The politeness of the bird's gesture of gratitude and the cat's cleverly planted decoy exhibit uniquely human motivation and capa cities, and the incongruity of the writer's attributions creates humor. The reporters' motivation for these attributions appears to derive, again, from their position and purpose relative to their audience. Anthropomorphic humor first aids the audience's comprehension of the writer's image of American wildlife and, second, it implies a cas</page><page sequence="7">292 Early American Literature, IX, 1975 ual, familiar relationship between "Americans" and their animals that not only individualizes "the American experience" but also al lays possible English fears about the danger posed by wildlife. The beaver and the bear especially lend themselves to anthro pomorphic humor. Wood notes the seeming rationality of beavers' behavior and then parlays that suggestion into a humorous portrayal (26-27). He accents his observation of their cooperative, regimental method of transporting logs by quoting the Latin form of the proverb "many hands make light work," which humorously ascribes a human quality to the beaver's work habits-the Latin adding a touch of face tious formality. He also calls the beavers' three-tiered lodges "three story houses" and suggests that errant beavers are socially rehabili tated by doing duty at the heavy end of the log. (Interestingly, Josse lyn attests to his own familiarity with Wood's account when he too anthropomorphizes the beavers' lodges into "three-story houses" [Rareties, 18].) Also in Wood's account, a hunter attacks a wounded bear with the butt of his rifle, whereupon the bear, "perceiving him to be such a coward to strike him when he was down" (22), retaliates and chases the hunter into a pond. The bear's use of peculiarly human codes of honor to evaluate the hunter's action supplies the humor in this anecdote. In a similar mode, Alsop facetiously chides Maryland's bears for failing to bid farewell when they run away from an encoun ter with human beings (37). Treated in this way, the bear hardly emerges as a threat to the colonist's safety or happiness. The human attributions in these bear and beaver reports seem unforced, but at times the promoters' anthropomorphic humor relies more heavily on contrived language. The humor of Wood's sug gestion that the porcupine "proclaims a Noli me tangere to man and beast that shall approach too near him" (23) relies primarily on the extremely incongruous application of the Latin, legalistic diction to simple, instinctual animal behavior. Alsop especially enjoys com bining formal, refined language (particularly legalistic terminology) and primitive features of wilderness life to effect a humor of incon gruity. His comments on the nuisance-creating flocks of swans, geese, and ducks are typical: "But while they do remain, and beleagre the borders of the shoar 'with their winged Dragoons, several of them are summoned by a Writ of Fieri Facias, to answer their presumptuous contempt upon a spit" (40). The comparison of this passage with Wood's beaver account defines the wide range of the anthropomor phic technique. While Wood touches his portrayal of beavers with flourishes designed to draw out the inherently comic, "human-seeing" qualities of their behavior, Alsop relies for his humor on the extremity</page><page sequence="8">Humor in the Promotional Tract 293 of his attributions. His strident tone of near outrage, in treating the birds as morally and legally responsible for their normal, in stinctive behavior, creates humor through the sheer incongruity of the unnatural diction and the unexpected ascription. These writers do not, of course, limit their animal humor to mis representation and anthropomorphism. Indeed, the straightforward reporting of the instinctual animal behavior that Alsop treats in a highly contrived way is a frequent source of mild amusement, es pecially when the animal's habits are unfamiliar and potentially fascinating to an English audience. Lawson's and JosselyM's reports of skunk "piss" and its special effect, and Lawson's account of the possum's "retrograde" coital practices (125), illustrate this kind of animal humor in its vulgar dimensions, while Lawson's account of Carolina's "flying pigs" (I42), consisting of the American eagle and its prey, demonstrates the simply comic interpretation of a visual ef fect. Less dependent on the conscious and extended management of the writer, this type of humor merits much less critical attention than the tall tale or anthropomorphic technique. But like those two pat terns of animal humor, it appears to derive from the promoters' de sire to create an image of American wildlife that is simultaneously fascinating or exotic and familiar or relaxing. Humor designed to create an image both exotic and familiar also pervades the promotional treatment of the American Indian, but the diversity of the humor is greater because the Indian is treated on more than one level. In one sense, the Indian is simply another natu ral curiosity of the American forest, inviting simple tall tale humor. But the Indian's reputation as a "savage" conjures up certain no tions and fears in the English mind, and the promoter's wish to satis fy and exploit this preconceived image gives rise to a more subtle form of humor: humor produced by the narrative description of par ticularly strange or repulsive features of Indian behavior in incon gruous tones of casual familiarity or open levity. On yet another level, the Indian is not a natural curiosity but the possessor of a relatively sophisticated culture. Anecdotal comparison and contrast of this cul ture with the white settler's way of life naturally produces humor, either through unexpected likenesses or complicating differences. This kind of humor, because it emphasizes the particularly "human" aspects of Indian behavior, contributes a sense of familiarity that counterbalances the "savage" image, and thus promotes coloniza tion by diminishing English fears. Alsop's claim that Indians dye their skin with roots and berries (77) and Josselyn's assertion that Indians speak extemporaneously in</page><page sequence="9">294 Early American Literature, IX, 1975 perfect hexameters (Rareties, 5) exemplify the simple tall tale de signed to poke fun at English gullibility. But in Indian accounts, the simple tall tale is critically less interesting than humor directed specifically at the English image of the Indian as savage. To exploit this image, the promoter typically describes Indian behavior, focusing in detail on its primitiveness and accenting its repulsiveness with humorously incongruous diction. Josselyn, for example, describes the Indians' consumption of live rattlesnakes and then labels the action a simple means of "refreshment" (Rareties, 38-39). In his gro tesquely humorous account of Indian scalping and cannibalism, Al sop reports that the Indians "disrobeth" the victim's head and then quickly apply hot embers in fear that the victim will get cold without his "customary Cap." He further asserts that they consume their victim's flesh while he is still conscious but blandly observes that human flesh is a rare treat-"a particular dish for a better sort" (80 81). In each case, the writer's tone of comfortable amusement plays against the anticipated English reaction of fascination and horror with humorous effect. By treating Indian behavior in this way, the promoter explicitly satisfies his English audience's morbid inter est in Indian savagery and implicitly pokes fun at the expected ex tremeness of the English reaction. On a more subtle level, this kind of treatment also strengthens the promotional appeal: the writer's comic tone masks an actual American inhabitant's fear of Indian savagery by suggesting that it seems more amusing than threatening. As a fascinating phenomenon of the American forest, the Indian lends himself to various forms of exaggeration and grotesque humor. But increased cultural contact between- colonist and Indian diminished the inclination to view the Indian solely as a natural curiosity and introduced another variety of humor into the promotional tract: humor that depends on the contact, confrontation, and intermingling of two initially distinct ways of life. A clear example of this kind of humor appears within Wood's discussion of the Indians' attitude toward the Christian religion. Although the Indians remain strong in their beliefs, they do learn the new religion well enough to serve as moral watchdogs to the colonists. In the particular incident Wood reports, the self-impressed Indians indignantly reprove their white counter parts for failing to pray before a meal (83). This story humorously typifies the frustration of superficial and incomplete cultural exchange and functions as a comic relief in a topic of discussion that Wood and other writers typically treat with deep seriousness: the missionary task of the white settler. Confrontation and exchange between the religious beliefs and</page><page sequence="10">Humor in the Promotional Tract 295 practices of the Indian and the white settler are a frequent source of humor in these tracts, and two extended anecdotes establish Lawson as the most interesting exploiter of this source. The first concerns two shrewd Indian "witch doctors" who lose their noses to "the pox" while in isolation from the tribe and then return to it, eager to gain power by pretending to mystic capacities. Asked what happened to their noses, they convert the loss to advantage: "They made answer, that they had been conversing with the white man above (meaning God Almighty), how they were very kindly entertained by that Great Being; he being much pleased with their ways, and had promis'd to make their capacities equal with the white people in mak ing Guns and Ammunition in Retaliation of which, they had given him their Noses" (26). In designing a story to dupe the tribe, the "doctors" count on their fellows being familiar and impressed enough with the white man's God to appreciate the advantage and to accept the legitimacy of the powers that the "doctors" now possess. But at the same time they rely on the superstitious logic of the Indian's religion for the really convincing phase of the argument. The re sulting notion of the Christian God intervening through syphilitic op portunists to equalize the armaments race in exchange for two noses is preposterous and humorous to an English audience, while the In dians apparently find it quite convincing. The modifications imposed on Christianity by the Indians' continuing belief in their own religion lead to a humorous conclusion. Cultural confrontation rather than interchange animates the second humorous incident. As a gesture of goodwill to Lawson's trav eling party, a group of Indians offers to serve up a rooster apparently reserved for sacrificial purposes. Evasive about the nature of this par ticular rooster, the Indians drop several veiled hints about their ori ginal intent for it, with the apparently calculated aim of disturbing the white men and enjoying the comedy of their hesitation and discom fort. Lawson's report that the rooster seemed to move and to bleed for an incredibly long time, thus intensifying the party's squeamishness, testifies to the effectiveness of the Indians' aim. The travelers over come their reservations and eat the rooster with no ill effect and "if he was design'd for him, cheated the Devil" (62), so the anecdote has no really comic denouement. But as Lawson presents the incident, the reader can easily imagine the nervous hesitation and deliberation of the travelers as they superstitiously measure the possible potency of the Indian "devil worship" against the dictates of their own common sense, and that internal predicament produces genuine humor. The amusing effect of Indian religious rituals on the behavior</page><page sequence="11">296 Early American Literature, IX, 1975 of white settlers is further enhanced by the conventional image of the innocent traveler encountering another culture via its food. Elsewhere Lawson relies more exclusively on this long-established convention in cultural-exchange reporting. While visiting another Indian tribe, the travelers confront a hearty meal of two unborn fawns cooked in their placenta and a hare stewed with its skin, hair, and innards intact. Lawson limits his comments to a brief summary statement that euphe mistically underscores the basic humor: "this new fashioned Cookery wrought Abstinence in our Fellow travelers" (58). A keen sense for the potentially amusing details of cultural exchange and a comfortable image of the Indian as its product characterize this type of Indian humor in general and Lawson's technique in particular. While confrontation between Indian and white patterns of be havior frequently produces a comic effect, the absence or transcend ence of expected differences between the two ways of life can also create humor, a humor based on recognition of the universality of human traits. Wood structures his amusing report of the maltreated but uncomplaining Indian wife around this source of humor. Norm ally docile and submissive to her husband's domination, the squaw occasionally seeks and finds comfort from her English counterpart: "These women resort often to the English houses, where pares cum paribus congregate, in Sex I meane, they do somewhat ease their mis erie by complaining and seldome part without reliefe: If her hus band come to seeke for his Squaw and beginne to bluster, the English woman betakes her to her arms which are the warlike Ladle, and the scalding liquors, threatening blistering to the naked runaway who is soone expelled by such liquid comminations" (102). This passage reveals the amusing universality (reinforced by the Latin) of women congregating to exchange complaints about their husbands' behavior, and the transcendence of cultural differences ("sex is stronger than race") lends a humorous familiarity to the Indian wife that the read er would not have anticipated. Furthermore, the image of the ram bunctious English wife using her domestic wiles to thwart and sub due a blustering Indian brave strengthens the comedy, not only through reinforcement of the sexual alliance theme but through the tradition ally humorous image of the "bully" being defeated by the crafty re sourcefulness of an apparently weaker adversary. Wood likes to util ize the familiar "war between the sexes" for comic effect. In another incident, the garrulity of an English housewife understandably per plexes and irritates an Indian male, driving him from her house to a white neighbor's where he mimics what he has heard: "Nannana Nannana Nannana Nan" (77).</page><page sequence="12">Humor in the Promotional Tract 297 While Wood employs the confrontations between the Indian male and the English wife for humorous effect, Josselyn and Law son infuse ribald humor into their accounts of relationships, po tential or actual, between the Indian female and the white male settler. In New England Rareties, Josselyn offers an erotic account of the Indian woman as "recreation against boredom" for those who have suffered through the plant and animal descriptions. With a "come to me" countenance for virtually every colonist she en counters, the Indian maiden is surely one of New England's most alluring "rareties," a fact humorously reinforced by Josselyn's bawdy poem which evaluates the sexual prowess of white and In dian females and decides in the Indians' favor because "darkness comes before the dawn" (99-102). Lawson's amusing anecdote about a boisterous white traveler and an Indian prostitute cautions the prospective colonist against surrender to such sexual temptation. Apparently naive, innocent, and totally vulnerable to the domination and demands of her prospective mate, the Indian maiden is in fact "no Novice at her game" of luring him into marriage. After a public celebration of the wedding, "Mr. Bridegroom" and "Mrs. Bride" retire to bed in complete happiness, but Lawson's report of the next morning reveals the brevity of the nuptial bliss: " . . . Mr. Bride groom, who in less than 12 Hours, was Batchelor, Husband, and Widdower, his dear Spouse having pick'd his Pocket of the Beads, Cadis, and what else should have gratified the Indians for the Vic tuals we receiv'd of them . . . Thus dearly did our Spark already re pent his new bargain, walking bare-foot, in his Penitentials, like some poor Pilgrim to Loretto" (47). In addition to illustrating some conventional motifs of humor (e.g., simple ribaldry, the traveler hoodwinked, the braggart si lenced), this anecdote summarily exemplifies many of the elemental features of the intercultural exchange variety of Indian humor in these promotional tracts. As Lawson draws the scene, the two anta gonists represent their respective cultures in elemental confrontation, with misunderstood motives leading to a humorous conclusion. And the reversal of cultural stereotypes, with the primitive savage becom ing the skillful entrepreneur and the white man assuming the role of the innocent, enhances further the passage's humor. Finally, the image of the prostitute behaving in her universally recognizable manner ex hibits the Indian humor that rests on cultural transcendence and that contributes to a comfortably familiar image of the Indian way of life. Thus, the most significant kind of Indian humor involves the simple anecdotal juxtaposition of the Indian and American colonist</page><page sequence="13">298 Early American Literature, IX, 1975 ways of life. This juxtaposition also functions in a final and multiple subject pattern of promotional humor: analogical humor, in which the "American" and the homeland English serve as comparative terms in amusingly incongruous analogies. At least initially the result of the promoter's effort to create a recognizable image through ana logues, Josselyn's suggestion in Two Voyages that the Indians' snow shoes are like English tennis rackets (297) and Lawson's analogy between an aged Indian's skin and "a Bag of Tripe" (36) exempli fy the simple analogy which serves a functional, descriptive purpose yet lightly amuses. Similarly, Lawson's analogy between the stamping motion of Indian dancers and "the treading upon Founders Bellows" (47) implicitly removes the maidens into an English foundry and thus humorously undercuts their potentially exotic image. The extent to which the English reader possessed the imagination and knowledge to appreciate the humorous incongruity of any of these simple analo gies is an open question, but the promoter's anticipation of his read er's puzzled expression is enough to qualify these analogies as at least partially humorous in intent. A variety of humorous analogies relying on English personali ties, institutions, and public jokes appeals more specifically to the con temporary British audience. Lawson employs a hyperbolic comparison that only an Englishman could fully appreciate to create a humorous ly familiar picture of an old, gaunt Indian woman: "old Parr's Head (the Welch Methusalem) was a Face in Swadling-Clouts to hers" (36). Similarly, Alsop's grotesquely descriptive comparison of fresh ly scalped skulls to carefully preserved ones has a contemporary Eng lish flavor: "the skull almost as bare as those Monumental Skelitons at Chryrurgions-Hall" (80). Lawson's analogy between the casual sexual affairs of young Indian braves and maiden dancers and the footguards and "trulls" of Salisbury-Court introduces popular Eng lish gossip into promotional humor while Alsop, in his description of Maryland's deer, creates an extended word play that relies on current English slang and popular awareness of prostitution: "The Deer here neither in shape nor action differ from our deer in England: . . . They are also mighty numerous in the Woods, and are little or not at all affrighted at the face of a man, but (like the does of Whetsons Park) though their hydes are not altogether so gaudy to extract an admira tion from the beholder, yet they will stand (all most) till they be scratcht" (36-37). Reflecting the promoter's participation in the public English consciousness and thus making him seem less a propa gandist and more a friendly acquaintance, such humor obviously in creases the English reader's receptivity to the promoter's account.</page><page sequence="14">Humor in the Promotional Tract 299 The frequency of the specifically English analogy reflects both the continuing impact of English society on the promoter's individ ual consciousness and his deliberate attempt to create an appealingly familiar image of America. Other humorous techniques, especially the incongruous use of highly refined language and codes of behavior to describe and evaluate primitive American life, stem at least partially from the same psychological and propagandistic factors. But these writers are not simply English travelers reporting the superficial delights of a "foreign" land to their fellow Englishmen. They also seek to express the uniqueness of the total "American experience," and various forms of humor are crucial to that expression. Anthropo morphic humor, which suggests congenial intimacy between Ameri cans and wildlife, cultural exchange anecdotes, which imply casual friendship between Americans and their "savage" neighbors, in congruously matter-of-fact diction and other forms of exaggeration, which suggest a comfortable acceptance of America's primitive envi ronment and pride in the country's natural assets, consistently en hance the promoters' image of the distinctly American way of life. Josselyn's polite chimney swallow, Alsop's boasting vegetation, Wood's tasty water, and Lawson's practical-joking Indians accent the pleasure and uniqueness of the American experience. Beyond its immediate effect of accenting the uniqueness of life in America, promotional humor reflects the early development of a distinctly American self-identity. All repeated techniques of humor suggest a somewhat unified American self-image, but the tall tale, the most diversified and frequent mode of humor, is the most significant indicator of this self-image. Appearing within a genre devoted to an English audience yet functioning by ridiculing that audience's lack of experience, the many instances of the tall tale suggest the promo ters' sense of a separate identity and their wish, however subcon scious, to express this sense to a "foreign" audience. Spurred by England's cultural refinement, age, and small size, the promoters turn to America's youth, primitiveness, magnitude, and natural exotica, exaggerating their existence and significance and advancing them as the key to America's distinctness. In the process, they lend the sanc tion of formal literary expression to the backwoods braggadocio and youthful optimism of early American culture and provide a stimulus to the future development of American humor. Americans' conscious lack of refinement, their compensatory pride in the advantages of their culture's primitiveness and material assets, and tall tales or simple boasting, especially as belittling "foreign" (European and, eventually, Eastern American) sophistication, would come to pervade</page><page sequence="15">300 Early American Literature, IX, 1975 America's folk and literary humor and self-directed satire (e.g., the Paul Bunyan tales, Western "local color" humor, Twain's fic tion and travel accounts, Henry Blake Fuller's satiric "Chicago fic tion"). Thus, promotional humor in general, and the promotional tall tale in particular, reflect the early stages of the American con sciousness and contribute to the nation's popular and literary tra ditions.
