Stuttgart: Ferdinand Enke Verlag, 1961. viii, 322 pp., references, index. DM29.50. Reviewed by THOMAS A. SEBEOK, Indiana University Kainz, a Viennese philosopher, is known in this country chiefly by his massive Psychologie der Sprache (Vol. 1, 1941; Vol. 2, 1943; Vol. 3, 1954; and Vol. 4, 1956), one chapter of which (in Vol. 2, pp. 170-259) bore the same title as the book under review. Excised from a new edition of the earlier work, the materials relating to animal com- munication are, in this volume, almost quadrupled as well as reoriented to take advan- tage of what were, in the 1950's, the latest achievements of linguistic theory, compara- tive psychology, ethology and ecology. The resulting synthesis is unique in that it constitutes the only monographic treatise on zoosemiotics (a term introduced in Lg., Vol. 39, p. 465 [1963]) so far. This summative aspect of Kainz's book is perhaps its most im- mediately useful feature, for, by supplementing it with a recent series of easily acces- sible review articles-by, e.g., P. Marler, on "Developments in the study of animal communication" (1959); W. H. Thorpe, on "Comparative psychology" (1960); M. Lindauer, on "Ethology" (1962); E. H. Hess, on "Ethology" (1963); D. G. M. Wood-Gush, on "Comparative psychology and ethology" (1963); T. A. Sebeok, on communication in social insects and marine mammals (1963); and W. A. Mason and A. J. Riopelle, nominally on "Comparative psychology" (1964), but actually on pri- mate behavioral research--one can readily gain an authoritative impression of the state of this rapidly expanding scientific discipline. The book is divided into two halves: the first aims to account for the biological data, and the second to consider a host of theoretical questions suggested by them. There are five separate chapters which bring together the literature concerning the following ani- mals: insects, especially the Hymenoptera (bees, 9-24, and ants, 25-33), with some attention (34-41) to sound-production in several subclasses of Exopterygota; fishes (41-50); amphibians and reptiles (50-54); birds (their sound production, 54-66, and some functions thereof, 66-71, the interrelationships of avian song and visual display, 71-80, with an excursus on mimicry, 80-86); and mammals (mostly primates, 86-119, with a miscellaneous sampling of others, especially domesticated animals, 119-26).</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 955 The first section is rounded out by chapters on communication between man and other animals; on "lying" in the animal kindgom; on the dangers of anthropomorphism; and on the limits to which an animal call system is capable of developing. Although the supporting annotations and references to Part I cover eleven pages (293-303), Kainz tends to be discursive rather than encyclopedic. This is hardly surprising when one realizes thatthe scientific literature concerned with insect "conversations" alone ran to over 1750 items by 1957, as assembled by M. and H. Frings, or that J. M. Moulton, in 1962, listed over 1500 entries on marine bioacoustics. In Part II of his book, Kainz undertakes a critical review of various theoretical approaches, both systematic and genetic, which have, at one time or another, been put forward to interpret forms of animal communication observed thus far. Throughout his survey, he manages to steer a sober middle course between the two extremes he characterizes (277) as "die Charybdis des Teleologismus und Anthropomorphismus" on the one hand, and "die Scylla des Mechanismus" on the other. The position he arrives at seems essentially identical with that of several European ethologists, notably that of his Austrian colleague, 0. Koenig. In a 1961 lecture, later published as "Probleme tierischer Verstqndigung," Koenig formulated his conclusions thus: human language is not an isolated phenomenon in nature but rather one with deep roots in the animal kingdom; the basic principle of all transactional systems is uniform; no clear boundary lines exist but only overlapping areas, "deren wichtigster und bedeutendster das allge- meine, 'primdre', und das tiberwiegend dem Menschen vorbehaltene 'sekundire' Signalsystem trennt und verbindet." Kainz's inquiry invites comparison with the simultaneously published but much more succinct "Logical analysis of animal com- munication," by P. Marler, who also contrasts the "objective," i.e., taxonomic stand- point of the ethological school with the anthropocentric approach of comparative psychologists and some linguists as well as the teleological attitude of some other psychologists, then builds upon the foundations provided by the former within the framework of a semiotic model. Kainz and Marler have this in common, that both re- gard animal communication systems as a whole instead of parochially treating each aspect, say, a single social releaser, as a separate issue; it is amply clear that such single components do not act independently of each other. Kainz's compendium neatly and serviceably terminates what might be thought of as the classical period of animal communication research, an uneasy mixture of acute field observation, such as Tinbergen's comparative studies of the behavior of gulls; ingenious laboratory experimentation, focusing, as in the work of Hinde, on the be- havior of certain cardueline hybrids; and a generous dash of speculation, which derives in part from the temperamental predilection of some investigators but which is also inherent in the very process whereby differences between present-day species are transposed into changes in time--illustrated by the recent attempt of Hockett and Ascher to trace the various steps and stages of the evolution of language, as well as by Earl W. Count's neuropsychologically oriented approach to the same problem. A vast amount of valuable descriptive material has been published since Kainz completed his work, and we have entered since a new, technologically more sophisti- cated, era of research. The use of telemetric and other automated devices can furnish answers more accurately as well as more quickly in studies of animal behavior, includ- ing social, as shown by the proceedings of a 1962 conference on bio-telemetry, edited by L. E. Slater. At the same time, the application of communication theory to the phenomena of social interaction, variously employed by scholars here and abroad (e.g., N. I.
