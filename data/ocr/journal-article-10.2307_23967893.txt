ISBN 90 04 10897 1. Gld. 176/$!10. This monograph, a revision of what must have been a distingu ished Durham Ph.D. thesis, makes an important contribution to Lukan studies. It subjects to critical scrutiny the belief that Luke historicized the primitive exaltation kerygma to make the ascen sion the point at which Jesus was advanced to the right hand of God, thus reducing the resurrection appearances to what Christopher Evans termed 'something of a half-way house'. Rejecting this view, it offers an alternative assessment of Luke's understanding of the ascension's significance. Following Lohfinck, Zwiep defines Luke's ascension narratives</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 231 as rapture stories but, unlike him, he finds their inspiration, not in those of Greece and Rome which enabled the immortalization or even the deification of their heroes, but in pre-Christian (or at least pre-Lukan) Jewish speculation. A chapter is therefore devoted to the stories of Enoch, Elijah, Moses, Ezra, Baruch, Phinehas and Melchizedek. Those of Enoch and Elijah, being firmly grounded in Scripture, are thought to be primary. However, whereas 'in the original Enoch and Elijah stories their rapture was in itself a crown to their career, later their rapture was seen as a precursory event which set them temporarily aside as it were for a future task in the eschaton'. Having given this pointer to where he is going, Zwiep then discusses those passages which have immediate significance for Luke's 'rapture Christology'. In the last chapter of the gospel, Luke, by omitting chronological details, ties the ascension story to that of the resurrection. It does not advance the status of Jesus, for his blessing of the disciples and their worship of him reflect, not the trappings of hellenistic rapture stories, but those of the description of Simon in Sirach 50.19-21. In Acts 1, if ηρξατο is to be given any significance, this is met by translating it 'from the beginning' and the 'forty days', paralleled in Jewish rapture tradi tions, emphasizes, not the moment of the ascension, but the end of Jesus' resurrection appearances and of his instructions to the disciples. Verses 6-8 refute the idea of Νaherwartung. The cloud, typical both of Jewish and hellenistic stories where it serves as a vehicle of ascent and/or as a means of concealment of the actual event, here 'envelops' Jesus and so hides the entry into heaven from the eyes of the disciples: 'The ascension is a final departure which commences a period in which Jesus will be physically absent.' This preliminary significance seen in the ascension stories is supported by two other exegeses. Luke 9:51, by making άναλήμφις refer to the ascension alone, sees that event as separated out from what has gone before rather than as actually a part of it. In Acts 3:21 Jesus is said to have gone into heaven in readiness for the parousia. 'It is God's will that Jesus is now in heaven, that is, it is God's will that the parousia has not yet taken place!' Luke's ascension texts therefore do not obviously point to Jesus' exaltation. In them he does not refer to Psalm 110:1, to Daniel 7:13-14 or to Psalm 68:19 and does not mention either the glory of God or Christ's ascension to a heavenly throne. Such omissions demand an explanation: 'If Luke has incorporated the ascension story to dramatise the heavenly enthronement of Jesus as Lord (κύριος), a visualisation of the Messiah's exaltation to his throne</page><page sequence="3">232 REVIEWS in heaven, why this silence? Why is Luke's picture so restrained in comparison with other traditions?' Why does Luke give it 'a thoroughly eschatological twist?' Having found grounds for questioning the exaltation reading of Luke's ascension narratives, Zwiep now seeks to link him firmly to what he sees as the primitive and general New Testament position where the glorification of Christ is effected by the resur rection. Only later was this pattern changed—in Mark 16:19 where the exaltation is separated from the resurrection and in John where it is 'stretched out' to embrace the cross also. Luke should not be read through their eyes. Other significant passages of Luke-Acts are now considered. Whilst Luke 23:42-3 has little to contribute, 24:26 speaks of an event already accomplished; 22:69 hardly refers to the ascension for he eliminates Mark's clouds. Acts 5:31 and 13:10—37 point to the traditional exaltation-through-resurrection concept. Peter's Pentecostal sermon rightly receives extended treatment, for it appears to present a challenge to Zwiep's thesis. Luke is here taking over traditional language, for 'the heavens' is a decidedly un-Lukan expression. In verse 33 ουν, strictly under stood, points to a reiteration of what has already been said rather than to a new step in the argument. Psalm 110:1 is included so that the resurrection cannot be understood as a mere restoration to life. Its proclamation of the exaltation of Jesus is based upon no event other than the resurrection. Zwiep allows that the greatest problem for him is Luke's failure to give a clear indication that the post-Easter appearances are those of one who is already exalted. Accepting, though seemingly not entirely convinced by, Alsup's categorization of them as 'anthropomorphic theophany stories' and stressing the changed nature of Jesus' resurrection body, he points to the many parallels between Luke and Matthew, though, unlike Matthew, in Luke Acts there is 'no explicit reference to the exalted status of the risen Lord'. Recognizing the weakness of these arguments, he finally puts his trust in Luke's alleged anti-gnostic or anti-docetic aims to account for his more reserved descriptions. He is therefore able to conclude that there is no 'principal objection to a categor izing of the post-Easter appearances by Luke as "appearances of the already exalted Lord from heaven" '. Zwiep now turns to his own assessment of the significance of Luke's distinctive picture. Whereas he uses ascension language in 'the resurrection-exaltation complex (the Easter event)' to make Jesus an active participant in the life of the disciples, the rapture type of ascension which is found at the end of the Gospel and in</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 233 the beginning of Acts ,puts Christ, as it were, temporarily on a sidetrack, waiting for the parousia'. The primary focus of the ascension story is salvation-history, not Christology. Its Sitz im LebenLeben is the delay of the parousia, the certainty of which it affirms. Rounding off one period of salvation history, it inaugurates another. The period of Jesus is a closed past, the appearances have come to an end and the apostolic witness has been legitim ated: 'The almost unavoidable corollary to Luke's rapture christol ogy is that Luke advocates an "absentee christology".' Christ does make his presence known, but he does so ,in spiritual ways'. The proclamation and experience of salvation are made possible through the gift of the Spirit which is occasioned by the Lord's exaltation. Here, the ascension plays only an 'ambivalent' role: 'Strictly speaking, it is the heavenly exaltation not the ascension which is the necessary precondition to Pentecost.' Redundancy is avoided by an appeal to the Elijah-Elisha story and to the passing on of the Spirit that it describes: 'The ascension marks the trans ition point at which the Jesus event continued to be effective along two separate lines, i.e. h&gt; ουρανώ (where the risen Lord is being kept in preservation) και kni γης (through the Spirit working in the Church).' This summary does scant justice to the actual quality of Zwiep's work which is meticulously argued, invariably stimulating, usually challenging and always deserving of the closest attention. All in all this is an important volume which makes a determined case for its author's reading of Luke. That it is compelling, however, is more open to question and, in the end it has to be said that it is not. Admittedly, this reviewer is not unbiased for he represents that interpretation of Luke against which the book's argument is directed. Nevertheless, allowing for that, it remains unlikely that Zwiep has done justice to Luke's actual narratives of the ascension. The imagery of Luke 24 may be influenced by Sirach 50 but its thought is not controlled by it. Whilst Sirach's congregation received 'the blessing of the Lord' and responded by worshipping God, in Luke the disciples are blessed by Jesus as he is carried up into heaven and then worship him. This seems nothing less than a legitimate response to a true recognition of an action which effects what it discloses. On the other hand, the Jesus of the resurrection narratives, though real and truly alive, provokes per plexity and has to work hard to convince the disciples of his status. The disciples' doubts are not, as in Matthew, the blameworthy hesitations of some, but are seen as the inevitable result of the career of Jesus which he has rationally to justify as being in accordance with the Scriptures. The resurrection has to be seen</page><page sequence="5">234 REVIEWS as actually vindicating the unexpected course of the career. On the other hand, the ascension, when seen through the eyes of faith, demonstrates the status of Jesus. Essential and pivotal though the resurrection is, it is the ascension which actually effects the full reality of Jesus. It glorifies and universalizes him in a way which the resurrection does not. The cloud of Acts 1:9 is neither a heavenly lift nor a divine curtain: rather, on the lines of Exodus 24:15-18 it both expresses the presence of God and maintains its otherness. When Moses enters the cloud, he confronts God face to face and reflects some thing of his glory. It is small wonder that, in Luke, the disciples at the transfiguration 'feared as they entered the cloud' and that the voice acknowledging Jesus as Son came out of its midst. The cloud catches up those who are within it into a special relationship with God. As at the baptism the Spirit in Luke came upon Jesus 'in bodily form', so now Jesus remains within the cloud in which he will return 'in his own glory as well as in that of the Father' (Luke 9:26). The ascension for Luke marks the point of glorifica tion to which everything else in the life, beginning from what for him is the third temptation, has pointed forward. If Acts pin points the perplexity rather than the worship with which the ascension narrative of the Gospel climaxes, this is because its story as a whole sets out to justify the amazing claim that its grounding in the ascension makes. Such a reading of Luke's ascension narratives means that Ziep's exegesis of Acts 2:32-6 must be questioned. His suggestion that the ovv of verse 33 should be taken narrowly in the sense of acting as a conclusion to and summary of what has gone before is made unlikely by Luke's earlier use of the same construction in verse 30. There it makes what follows virtually into a causal clause— 'because he was a prophet, he foresaw ... '. Verse 33 follows a similar pattern. It is 'because' Jesus is exalted that he is able to pour out the Spirit. Verse 34 goes on to justify what verse 33 proclaims and does so by naming the ascent into the heavens as the means and content of the exaltation. Such deliberate and emphatic justification accounts for the unusual use of the plural, much as it does in Stephen's climactic assertion in 7:56. In the end Ziep, I think, has not done justice to Luke's ascension narratives. These have christolngical significance and effectively both both establish and reveal Jesus as exalted to the right hand of the Father. To see them as expressing less than this makes them have the effect of putting some kind of constraint upon the exaltation achieved-through-resurrection by making the ascension into a vehicle of withdrawal which compels Jesus to wait on the sidelines</page><page sequence="6">REVIEWS 235 (a term which Ziep uses more than once). Jesus becomes an inactive Lord, much more so in fact than is Conzelmann's, and it does little to reduce this by speaking of his making his presence known 'in spiritual ways'. Luke's Jesus is not inactive: the Gospel speaks of what he 'began' to do and he moves, if not in his church, then at least with, or perhaps better, above it. That he does not actually move within it is caused, not by what is appropriate to any particular period of salvation history, but by the constraints placed upon Luke by his thinking of Jesus in terms derived from the Old Testament. If Ziep is no doubt right to link the ascension to the parousia which it guarantees, he nevertheless does not do real justice to the link. The ascension does not merely make Jesus available for the parousia, it actually anticipates it, releases its first-fruits and even inaugurates what the parousia will complete, the overthrow of Satan and of all that hinders God's rule. Ziep has nevertheless done Lukan scholarship real service by making it face the fact that Luke does not always include reference to the ascension as though it were the sole and essential witness to and means of Jesus' glorification. Indeed, he might have made more of the fact that the early speeches of Acts which have claims to be expressions of Luke's own distinctive kerygmatic witness make only limited reference to it. Only in Peter's sermon at Pentecost is the ascension pin-pointed as the moment of exaltation. At the Beautiful Gate, Jesus' glorification may not have been seen as having been achieved by the resurrection, but there is no explicit reference to any other event and a nod in its direction cannot be assumed. His waiting in heaven may be based on noth ing else than a cessation of resurrection appearances. Further speeches of Peter build any apology on the resurrection whilst that of Paul at Antioch of Pisidia makes the resurrection itself the point of adoption into that sonship which the speech proclaims. Luke does not so emphasize the ascension as to make it essential as an ingredient in his witness to Jesus' glorified status. Nevertheless, whenever he does refer to it, it becomes the precise point of that glorification and the resurrection is reduced to some preliminary stage preparatory to it. This suggests that Luke is in fact historicizing the kerygma at this point. It expresses his funda mental statement of faith and is used when he is thinking in terms of God's eschatological action through Jesus. It witnesses to Jesus as the fulfilment of God's saving work in Israel and is in turn itself witnessed to by the outpouring of the Spirit and the universal mission undertaken in his power. It guarantees the parousia which will reveal what it has itself enabled. Luke does not always spell this out in the missionary speeches, for its faith assertion is</page><page sequence="7">236 REVIEWS witnessed to only by its results. One of these is the presence of the Holy Spirit, and so Peter can proclaim it in his Pentecost sermon. That to Cornelius was made before the Spirit's presence was demonstrated. No doubt had it followed the gift, the ascension would have figured prominently! Belief in the ascension is the prerogative of those who rejoice both in their possession of the Spirit and in the one they see as his enabler. Apologetics generally rests on the resurrection of Jesus for it is that event which can be presented as the logical grounds for faith in him. Zwiep has made a significant contribution to Lukan study: his work is a model of its kind. Disagreement with his conclusions in no way diminishes the debt owed to him for a stimulating work which challenges both by its thesis and by its standard of scholarship. Ε.
