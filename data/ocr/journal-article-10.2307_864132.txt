<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RUTHERSTON COLLECTION AT SOUTH KENSINGTON -I. JADES BY W. A. THORPE HE selection of early Chinese art formed by the late Charles Ruther- son is now exhibited on loan at the Victoria and Albert Museum. The taste which brought it together was one of unusual clarity. Mr. Rutherson did not collect for hypothesis or for possession or for curiosity, and nothing is in his collection because it ought to be there. Every piece is a sensitive preference and consequently the early history of Chinese art is here registered without prejudice and with a most delicate economy. It is of interest that this unfuddled cho.ice should include several jade *types which 'are commonly waived as " archaeological "; pre- sumably because their design is elementary or they have been dug up. Their presence in this collection does something to break up the narrow category of oesthetic interest and with it the hollow dogma of significant form. The content of a work of art is always an adverb, and the adverb an adverb of behaviour; form may be a complex of relationships passing into rhythm, but human behaviour is all that it can signify. Ideology is a part of behaviour and in several of the objects here illustrated it is explicit. Their form is admittedly elementary but they do not cease to be made by art because they are geographically conceived. The identification of the ts'ung and pi rests mainly on the evidence of the Chou Li' and may, I think, be regarded as certain." Dr. Laufer in his Jade sought to carry through the equation of known jade types with the ritual objects described in the Chou Li and other classics. In doing this he largely followed Wu Ta Ch'eng, a well-known Chinese scholar of the last century whose work' he highly praised.4 From the point of view of Quellen- kritik there is little serious objection to this method. The Chou Li has now lost the early date and historical character assigned to it by Biot, but its value as a source is not diminished thereby. It is to be regarded as an almanack of an " ideal " empire compiled in Later Han times but throwing back its analysis into the golden age of Chou. Even on that reckoning it must have been based on material which was actual at the time of compilation. For Han times, therefore, it is directly valid. As for its retrospective value, there is a core of fact covered with later accretions, but these are the discoveries of diligent scholarship more probably than the falsifications of tradition. On the literary side, the tradition has been broken to some extent by the Ch'in revolution and an intelligent interest in Pre-Ch'in China was one characteristic of Later Han scholarship. It does not follow that the identification of 1 Le Tcheou Li. Translation into French by E.

With the yellow jade tube ts'ung he does homage to Earth.") It is further added (Biot, I, 490 that) the pi is symbolical of Heaven and the ts'ung of Earth. See Laufer (B.), Jade (Chicago, Field Museum of Natural History, Anthropological Series, Vol. X, i912), pp. 120, sq., and references cited below.

Jades jades is often possible; for the Chou Li descriptions are apt to be meagre and obscure. The reaction against the literary equation is marked by an essay of Prof. Pelliot5 in which he turns to archaeological evidence and especially to the early culture revealed by Dr. A ndersson.' The value of this approach, so far as jades are concerned is that it supplies a formal derivation for certain jade types (e.g., the ko- and knife derivatives), but it does not provide them with a social context; archaeology can only say ritual derivatives from a utilitarian prototype. Those jades which seem to carry an idea are not illuminated by the Tang Shao deposits. For the connection between the ideas and the art of " seden- tary China,"' it is more fruitful to work from ideology to design than from design to ideology. The take-off is in literature. All the ideas of sedentary China were affiliated to the Tao. Man in China has never been important; what is important and impressive is the universe. This attitude is directly contrary to the Western tradition which has made a hero of humanity and believes that the universe may be brought to heel by the whistle of science and morality. The mode of painting most essentially Chinese is land- scape, not portraiture; whereas western landscape began life in the background, with a man in front. The Chinese were less arro- gant in this respect. They wished to make themselves intellectually comfortable in a bewildering world and they were thus led to the discovery of a Weltanschauung which brought the diversity of phenomena within the compass of human reason. This formulation was called the Tao-the way things happen. Its tendency was monistic but not theistic; logical rather than imaginative; an " outside " explanation, not an " inside " explanation. The development of early Greek monism offers an interesting contrast, for there, too, the explanation was at first external, among the " elementary " sages of Ionia; but by the time of Anaxagoras the elements had been abandoned, and for Anaxagoras himself the Tao was a faculty of man (nous) turned out of doors and made universal.8 Herein lies the essential humanism of Greek thinking, and it was supported by a bright anthropomorphic fancy which has only the palest counterpart in sedentary China. The philosophies of Con- fucius and "Lao Tzti " were divergent interpretations from a pre-existent popular ideology, and in both systems the Tao, trans- lated from facts to values, was used as the philosophical sanction for a traditional morality. As an existent,, the Tao was kimpersonally conceived as Ta 9P the great monad or as T'ai Chi"? the absolute. Conceived as a dynamic, the Tao operated through the dual forces of nature the Yang and the Yin, which in the form of fluid composed the primordial chaos and separated off like milk and cream to become heaven and earth." The Yang-Yin idea was primarily astronomical and only secondarily biological. In the astronomical view Yang was the sphere of heaven, carrying with it the sun and the fertilising influence of heat, light, rain; and from it were derived the ideas of power and goodness. The Yin was earth, dark, heavy, passive and weak. The essence,12 and therefore the image,"3 of heaven were circular; incommensurable but complete, since elementary logic will have no infinities. For earth, the domain of man, the circle was squared and made practicable, so that north,, south, east and west were not points of a compass but straight sides. In the biological conception, the Yang and the Yin came out of a cosmos (which really meant rain on the arable) into the farm-yard, and became the generative dualism, Yang being the male and Yin the female. The astronomical view and the bio- logical view were never clearly distinguished, and, in consequence, the Yang and the Yin have a double set of correlatives which at times overlap.'"

Legge, I, 287: " it splits and becomes heaven and earthi, it changes and becomes Yin, and Yang." 11 The separation idea is a commonplace of the creation theories, both Chinese and Greek. Dr. Forke (World-con- ception of the Chinese, London, 1925, p. 40) cites interesting examples, and among them a fragment of Anaxagoras: 'A7r -TOVTV - V a7rOKpLVOeAOVWV (VTU7rJryTaL 7t Y K /XEV yap rov vebeXeowv i&amp;op WarOKpVETCra, EK TOU - Sa-ro 7), K 'eT y9 X OoS (o-v7Ur-yvUvrai vT o rO urvpoR. But in the case of Anaxagoras this emphasis is beside the point. Anax. is important not in resembling his predecessors (and the Chinese), but in differing from them, i.e., in the externalised nous. This is ma~de clear by Aristotle's critical remarks on him (loc. cit.). 12 Huai-Nan-Tzu, a Taoist philosopher of the Early Han dynasty, says: " the principle of heaven is round, the prin- ciple of earth is square. The square governs darkness, the circle brightness " (cited by Forke, World-conception, p. 52). The former sentence occurs word for word in Liu Ngan, a writer of the second century, A.D. (cited by De Groot, Relig. System of China, VI, 1264). In each case the phrase yiieh tao implies " is concerned as essentially 13 Dr. Laufer (Jade, p. 121) well insists that the objects used for worship of the six cosmic powers are not symbols for ideas but images of them. 14 The Yang-Yin correlatives are collected by Forke, World-conception, pp. 163, sq. 239</page><page sequence="3">The Rutherston Collection-I. Jades immanence of the Yang and the Yin is the end- less demonology of Yang powers or sh'n and Yin powers or kuei,"5 though even these do not seem to be sexually conceived, but derived rather from the life-death, light-darkness correlation. The whole hierarchy-Tao, Yang and Yin, shun and kuei-is eventually abstract and logical. This pre-emptive logic governed classical China, in morality, thought, religion, and in political organisation, providing the Chinese with mathematics instead of myth, design instead of iconography, a cosmology in place of a pantheon. The most complete statement of it is to be found in the early astronomies which have been shown to be indigenous in China and were a principle source of ideology in Chou times.'6 The Chfinese described the world first and worshipped it afterwards. Their metaphysic, astronomically stated, was more fundamental than their religion, and thus their religion was itself conceived and expressed in the terms of their prior description. Its images and associa- tiions did not arise spontaneously in acts of worship. But worship, being emotionally"7 grounded, required a concrete apparatus. Thus the logical bias passed from astronomy, through worship, into the design of ritual objects, and thence to pure decoration. This link between pure and applied ideology is an important clue to design in sedentary China, and it offers a guide to the chronological sequence. The devolution of logic in the earliest Chinese design may be traced by three stages: (a) In the first we have the explicit geometrical imagery of the plain'" pi and ts'ung, where the design is correspondential. In the Eumor- fopoulos Collection there is an interesting plain pi with the pa kua,"9 in relief. The latter are a geometrical statement of permutation, but their arrangement in the Eumorfopoulos specilmen shows a slight decorative concession. (b) In the second stage the pre-emptive logic is not stated directly but impltied in the character of the design. The use of the pa kua for a decora- tive purpose" may be regarded as a link between stage (a) and stage (b), e.g., the various types of geometrical ornament, key-pattern, etc., found on Chou bronzes. A good example of it may be seen in the classical (Chou) girdle pendent of the ku yii t'u p'u2' and the com- ponent parts22 of it which are themselves geo- metrically arranged. In a zoomorphic jade figured by Dame Una Pope-Hennessy23 not only is the ornament geometric, but the creature itself is geometrically constructed and its derivation from a sector of the pi is clear. It is not neces- sary to cite further examples of this well known type of Chou design. (c) With the appearance of organiic line the logical bias acts as a con- stricting influence. In early Chinese art organic line appears to be partly indigenous and partly transmitted. In the former case it is difficult to say whether the move towards abandon was due to a (subjective) looseniing of geometrical structure or to the outside stimulus of organic life; probably both explanations are reciprocally true. Nor can one say at what point the stiff scrolls become definitely closed scrolls. Cloudy convolutions moving towards ornithic or draconic forms are a common orna- ment of pi and that is itself a strong argument for the indigenous origin of the Chinese dragon. Stiff scrolls which are still rigidly geometrical are also interpreted as a tiger. Of the other type of organic line called by Prof. Rostovtzeff2' the " animal style " little can be said here. The technical transmission from Central Asia probably reached China about the middle of the Chou dynasty (eighth century, B.C.)26, but the instances which come from China are apt to have a more rigid style than those of Scythia and South Russia. In this greater constriction we may perhaps remark S5 For the shen and kuei and the magical system which served them, see De Groot (J. J. M.), Religion of the Chinese (New York, 1910), pp. 3 sqq. and 33 sqq. 16 By De Saussure (L.). Les origines de l'astronomie chinoise. T'oung Pao, X, 121-182, 255-305 (1909); XI, 221- 292, 457-487, 583-648 (910o); XII, 347-374 (1911). The analogy with Pythagoreanism is perhaps worth quoting. In each case there is an organon and then a "mystical " attitude towards it. 17 Cf., Li Chi, ed. Couvreur, I, 58: " The sacrifices offered to the altars of Earth were intended to honour the beneficent action of the Earth, aq honour was paid to the actions of spirits. The Earth bears ten thousand things and Heaven holds the stars suspended. All riches come from Earth and the seasons and order of works are ruled by Heaven. So they honoured Heaven, but they loved Earth and they taught the people to give solemn thanks." 18 E.g., Jade, P1. XV, I-3 (t'sung), P1. XXI-XXII (pi); cf., Li Chi, ed. Legge, I, 400: " acts of the greatest reverence admit of no ornament." 19 The pa kua are a good example of which I have called the pre-emptive logic of early Chinese thought. Cf., Eitel in the China Review, X V, 342, where their significance is well stated: " There is underlying these diagrams a recognition of the truth that things are groups of relations. The diagrams themselves are to my mind clearly ideal construc- tions expressing real facts and built up from real elements of imperfect and fanciful experience . . . causation is here represented as imminent change, as the constant interaction of the bi-polar power of Nature, which is never at rest, balanced or free, the mutually sustaining opposition of two forces which are essentially one energy, and in the activity of which divergence and direction is inherent and essential."

In the Scythian types the lines go on and carry you with them-so fast that you cannot see where you are going. In the Chinese instances the lines stop with a potent economy; but the design goes on, and it is the possibilities that carry you away. These phases of design appear to be conse- quential, but their chronology is not easy to fix. For that purpose the most important land- mark is the Ch'in revolution and the Han expergiscence which followed it. The stilted feudalism of Chou China was succeeded by an imperial programme which brought with it the stimulus of foreign contact. One aspect of the new society was a criLical " enlightenment " which awakened Chinese thought from the dog- matic slumber of the Chou masters. At the same time the arts escaped from the rules of logic and swept into a powerful abandon. The result was a new vogue in design, free, vivid and various, and marked by a sympathy with organic life that is not less evident in pure design -than in 'the actual representation of natural forms. It follows that jades, where the design is freely conceived or explicitly zoomorphic (e.g., the individuation of the dragon in PLATE I, A) are subsequent to the Ch'in revolution; and since the appearance of the animal style is now placed about the eighth century B.C., it seems probable (a) that organic constriction dates from the second half of he Chou dynasty (c. eighth century--255 B.c.), and (b) that logical design both explicit and implied is earlier still. A scheme of tlhat kind is often to be modified in its application to particulars by the possi- bility of later apologues, but the reproduction of Chou types is considerably less likely during tlhe Han break-away than in the studied renais- sance of Sung times. If it holds for design, then the quite plain ts'ung is the earliest of the objects figured here. Whereas tlhe pi are found both plain and with organic ornament of varying constitution, the ts'ung do not seem to have organic ornament at all; where they are not plain they have the rectangular "hinges" or other geometrical ornament. Had jade ts'ung been made in late Chou times one would expect an ornament which shows organic constriction, which is found in tlhe later pi, e.g., Laufer, Fig. 73 a and b. In pi on the other hand, we find all stages of design from the plain pi to a " real live dragon." (a) Of these the plain pi are probably contemporary with the ts'ung and date from the first half of the Chou dynasty. (b) Next in order are "the pi with stiff geometrical scrolls (Laufer, PLATE XXIII 4, XXIII 5, XXV 3, in order of relaxation) (c) Organic constriction appears in Laufer, Fig. 73b (after Wu), but the logical bias is still evident in the symmetry. (d) Finally we have the cloud scrolls of Laufer (PLATE XXIV), which show considerable aban- don, but are not yet explicitly zoomorphic. These types (b)-(d) may be regarded as of mid-Chou or late Ohou date according to the degree of constriction which they exhibit. (e) The scroll ornament which is explicitly zoomorphic (e.g., Laufer, Fig. 74, where the bird head is clearly seen though the body is still scrolled, and Fig. 71 where both head and body are explicit) must be left until the Han expergiscence. At what point in this revolution must we place the Rutherston pi? The logical paradigm is still effective in the circularity of Yang, but tVhe essential Yang is here given its visual attributes of cloud and rain. Tlhe pi form has taken on ornament of cloudy convolutions. In the outer zone are the heavy cloud masses, in the inner the cloudlet raindrops. The design of the outer zone is still forced into symmetry, and there is no abandon. You may begin with the " tail " of a scroll and follow it, hoping for a head, but instead you find a blank mask that is only potential. The mask itself is sym- metrical and is centred on a little panel of cross hatchjing as in one of Wu's examples just quoted (Laufer, Fig. 73b). But the most com- plete parallel to the Rutherston pi is to be seen in a jade pi recently dug up in the Lolang district of Korea."7 In the Lolang pi, the pro- portions of ring and perforation are about the same and the former is divided into two zones, of big and little clouds. The scrollwork of the outer zone is not symmetrical and instead of the blank head mask you find a quite explicit bird-head. It may be suggested that the explicit bird-heads are an early evidence of Han naturalism. In that case the Lolang pi is to be described as early Han while the Rutherston pi is prior to the Ch'un revolution, i.e., dates from the end of the Chou dynasty. We come lastly to the "real live dragon " of PLATE I, A. Here the visual atttributes of Yang have got quit of its essence. What had been only the ornament of the pi [PLATE I, B] is released fro.m its form and reassembled inde- pendently. By the same act design has escaped from worship into decoration, from logic into life. The heavy cloud masses are now the beast's configuration, its scales the rain drop that the big clouds contain; and all the stiff symmetry is gone out of the picture. Whereas the ts'ung 27 Korea.

Jades and pi were religious objects, the dragon of PLATE I, A is a personal ornament2"--part of a girdle pendent (Laufer, Fig. 142) which closely resembles the Rutherston dragon, but witlh one difference; that in Wu's dragon the rail is a bird's head (as in the Lolang pi), whereas in the Rutherston example the tail is merely a tail. One early Chinaman, observing a cloud, thought it looked like an alligator;29 for alli- gators abound in the rivers of China. Another early Chinaman thought rather that it resembled a bird. In Han design the alligator and the bird ran a neck-and-neck race to become the chief atribute of Yang and the emblem of China. As is well known, the alligator won and was canonised as tihe dragon. In Wu's girdle pendent the dragon has not shaken off its rival, but in the present example there is no ornithic influence except on the neck scroll. That is some ground for placing it about the middle of the Han dynasty rather than at the outse't, and such a date is consistent with, several girdle pendants illustrated by Dr. Laufer (PLATE XXIX) where the design is equally abandoned, but much less zoomorphic than in the Rutherston dragon. The two objects shown in PLATE II, A30 are of utilitarian origin. Stone and bronze imple- ments of closely similar type were found in the Yang Shao deposits, and Dr. Andersson 1has shown3" that these are variants of the amneolithic hache-poignard"3-a pointed hachet fixed transversely on a shaft. He has demonstrated from intermediate modes of writing it that the modern character 4 ko is derived from the pictogram for this hatchet.ss The identifica- tion of the jades in PLATE II, A with any of the insignia described in 'the Chou Li is highly dubious; the yen kuei is at any rate possible.*" It seems likely that whereas objects of religious use were ideographic, objects of civil ceremony were derived from utilitarian prototypes, which had the dignity of being obsolete; " the pen is mightier than the sword " is the proper way to say that typewriters are more powerful than machine-guns. The object on PLATE II, c is a knife deriva- tive.3" Wu Ta Ch'eng figures two objects which resemble it fairly closely.3" The first of these Wu called the ta kuei, but neither Wu's object nor the Rutherston object will stand that identi- fication, if only because the ta kuei is described by the Chou Li37 as " hammer-headed ""38 and was therefore more akin to the ko-derivatives. Wu's other object is called by him a hu, but is clearly derived from a knife blade. The latter is true of the Rutherston object, which has been cut down at the end opposite the " handle." Professor Pelliot"3 has convincingly argued the knife derivation, but it is surely possible that a ceremonial knife may have been used for writing. PLATE II, B shows a set of jades used for filling the apertures of the corpse in the tomb. Jade was pre-eminently the Yang substance; it was eaten sacramentally and after death it was used to preserve the body from decay and to ensure immortality." c is the amulet placed on the tongue.4' Such pieces were tongued-shaped, sometimes plain,42 sometimes incised." In a third type (as c) the tongue form was modified to become a cicada,44 but the significance of this is not clear, a and ai are a pair of eye- pieces in the shape of a fish,"5 which Dr. Laufer considers to be a symbol of watchfulness."' Hand-grips like b and b are described by the Lolang excavators47 as " pig jades," and on the analogy of cicada tongue-pieces this is pro- bably correct. The pair of short prisms d and dI may be either nose plugs or ear plugs which are of almost identical shape and size;"4 the other pair is missing from tlhe Rutherston set. The larger prism e, can also be matched in the Lolang finds, but is described by the excavators simply as a " plug-shaft.49 This type is too long for an ear- or nose-plug, and Dr. Laufer"? suggests another and probable use. 28 Laufer, Jade, p. 217 sq. 29 Yetts, Chin.
