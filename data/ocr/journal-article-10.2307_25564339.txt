Administered by the Irish American Cultural Institute on behalf of the Arts Council, the residency offers one annual fellowship to an artist. A working studio space is provided for ten months at Location One, New York.. The award includes provision for accommodation and a monthly stipend of $1,500. Location One is a not-for-profit arts centre whose mission is "to foster the convergence of classic and new media for the development and presentation of new work. Emerging and established artists in all media are invited to collaborate and experiment with advanced technological tools." The residency award by the Arts Council can be seen as a continuation of the 'P.S.l' legacy; also based in New York, being sent on a P.S.l residency was the most monetarily valuable prize offered by the Arts Council until the scheme finished a few years back. Art business At the Allianz Business2Arts Awards this year, among the prizes to note was the Best collaboration by a small business award, which went to Eurojet Ireland and the Royal Hibernian Academy. We report on pages 98 - 100 of this issue on this year's Eurojet show. John Sisk &amp; Son and ev+a , Limerick's annual visual-arts fest, were highly commended under the Best collaboration with continuity award. 26* CIRCA 113 Autumn 2005</page><page sequence="2">UPDATE ^^^HPP fll^lBa^lBa^lBa^lBa^lBa^lBa^lBaH Artists in the Dock / to the Four Despite the appearance of Space: Architecture for Art, the CIRCA publication which contains a stunning directory of contemporary art spaces throughout the island of Ireland, new spaces continue to crop up. For instance, there's Leitrim's new Arts Centre, the Dock, in Carrick on Shannon. In a renovated building, it contains three galleries and already boasts an impressive programme even before its official opening this September. And there's Four, on Burgh Quay, Dublin 2. "Four is devoted to the development of an uninhibited artistic exploration of ideas, discourses and new trends in contemporary art and its practices." The space kicks off with Xyler lane this November. The following exhibi tion, curated by Mark Garry, will include works by Robert Carr, Paul McKinley and Sufjan Stevens. Iceberg! It's a project many want to sink. If the heat of argument were enough, it could alternatively melt away. It's also a project that lends itself to endless metaphor: Rita Duffy's proposal to tow an iceberg to Belfast. Why do such a thing? It's about 'working through' memories - both of the Titanic, doomed pride of Harland and Wolff - and of Belfast's more recent troubled waters. Logistically, it is an enormous undertaking, and it seems the artist is in it for the long haul (apologies!) - with a possible target date being the one hundredth anniversary of the launching (1911) or sinking (1912) of the vessel. While the idea has piqued the curiosity of TV, radio and other media around the globe, it has met with some fierce opposition closer to home. The 'no' side is being led by, among others, Joffy Donaldson. He has (by 15 August 2005) gathered 786 signed-up members for his campaign. According to him, "Many of those who profess themselves 'artists' promise to enliven the protest [this winter] with 'giant papier mache icebreakers', 'depressed polar bear suits' and other such colourful performances..." Apparently "at least a third of our members protest at the proposed iceberg on aesthetic grounds, saying it is an ugly proposal or that it is out of step with what is current in the field of sculpture. The remaining members of the campaign claim it is either impracticable or an insult to those who have encountered icebergs in less frivolous circum stances (notably, of course, the passengers and crew of the Titanic)." But according to Duffy, whose father served his appren ticeship in the Harland and Wolff shipyard, "The ICEBERG project opens up the narrative and imagines other possibilities; it has the promise of revelation; it is a celebration of how we might begin to see ourselves and who we might become.. .Times have changed, the big thaw has begun and the water that runs from the ice will alchemise the fire and quench the burn."

Marianne O'Kane, frequent CIRCA contributor, has been made Chief Executive Officer of the Wexford Arts Centre. A slew of new faces now grace the Board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin. They include three artists: Valerie Connor, Aine O'Driscoll and Brian Ranelow. Prize man Peter Richards, artist and Directory of the Golden Thread Gallery, Belfast, is the inaugural winner of the Curfew Tower Award. The prize is unusual. It is open to artists who have been in residence in the Curfew Tower, Cushendall, Co. Antrim, and it is awarded by popular acclaim of the citizens of Cushendall. Richards appar ently won hands down, when work of previous residents of the tower was put on display on 10 August. According to the press release, "The winner of the award receives a small bronze cast of the Curfew Tower and no fat cheque." If you are surprised by the somewhat truculent tone of the statement, Google "Bill Drummond." VISUALise this Images have been released of VISUAL, the National Centre for Contemporary Art and Performance Theatre, which is scheduled to open to the public in early 2007. The design plan that won the RIAI architectural design competition for the project, which initially attracted 119 entries, was proposed by Terry Pawson Architects, an award-winning London-based practice specialising in the area of public and cultural spaces. The centre will be equipped with a wide range of facilities to accommodate exhibitions and events, such as retractable seating, climate control, and adaptable interior spaces. The design of the centre will reportedly follow its function: to promote openness to new art forms, media, and gallery presentation. VISUAL can be seen as the long-awaited acknowledgment of the vigorous visual-arts scene in Carlow and environs. Eigse is probably the best-know of Carlow's visual-arts dominated events, with Visualise Carlow coming a close second. Meanwhile, the new jewel in University College Cork's crown, the Lewis Glucksman Gallery, continues to draw accolades to itself. Having been singled out for an RIBA Award in June, it is now shortlisted for the very prestigious RIBA Stirling Prize.

Aileen became head of school in 1997; since then, with formida ble organisational skill and vision, she transformed what was then known as the Dun Laoghaire College of Art into the dynamic institution of creative practices it is today. Aileen graduated from the National College of Art and Design, Dublin, with a BA in Fine Art in 1976. She took an MFA in Southern Illinois University in Sculpture in 1981. She returned to Ireland where she became one of a number of pioneering women artists who came to prominence between 1975 and 1985, such as Cecily Brennan, Kathy Prendergast and Dorothy Cross. Up to the mid-sixties, Irish art was emphatically insular. It tended towards the nationalistic, with a predominantly rural perspective, shored up by a conservative educational system. Aileen contributed significantly to breaking this mould, as both an artist and an educator. As a young teacher in NCAD, to which she returned in 1982, Aileen was to the fore in broadening the work practices of the Sculpture department to include video, film, photography, sound, installation, assemblage and performance. She was a gifted and inspiring educational ist. Her early relief sculpture was mainly concerned with landscape. Exhibitions such as Forest Fragments, Project Arts Centre, 1982; Thedral Thicket, Triskel, Cork, 1983; and Landlesions, Hendriks Gallery, 1986, explored different aspects of land and nature as the repositories of meaning. The early multi-media landscapes are often cut away or cross-sectioned to reveal what lies beneath - what is normally unseen - peeling away layer after layer, to get to the heart of the matter. There are recurring binary oppositions evident within the work: inside and out; above and below; nature and artifice; revelation and concealment. Increasingly anthropomorphic, landscape eventually gives way to manmade structure in House, Project Arts Centre, 1991. This dramatic shift in direction was caused by a life-changing event in Aileen's own life: the death of her son, Luke, in 1987. What emerged two years after she resumed working was a hugely challenging corpus of work in which she seems to have shifted from a naturalistic to a humanistic world-view. As the practice of art is a primal instinct, Aileen was unable to remain silent. Although intensely private about her own life, she set about a remarkably difficult task. She wanted her work to express her own deepest thoughts and emotions while, for public consumption, she wanted the distillation of her experience to create the opportunity for her audience to reflect on more universal concepts and meanings, concerned with disaster, mortality and renewal. In relation to one of her installations, Deadheading - in which she explored conflicting emotions evoked by confronting issues surrounding life, death and beauty - with poignant prescience, Aileen wrote: From the very beginning of our lives the only certainty is that we will die. Yet there is an unnatural fear of death. We are happy to look at life. We take delight in documenting its various manifestations. But we are uncomfortable looking death in the eye. We are even more uncomfortable looking at something beautiful dying. There is a time and place for death and everything should be in its proper time and place. Three years ago, when Aileen was diagnosed with cancer, she started that journey herself. What was so remarkable about her was the courage with which she faced her own illness and death. When she first told me she had cancer, she declared that while she could not pretend that she would enjoy it, she intended to live her illness to the full. She had an unflinching capacity to confront the huge tragedies dealt her in her too short life - the unbearable loss of a child, her own illness and pain, and even her own death. She had so much more to give, not least to return to her own art practice. Within days of her death, she was still looking forward to all the things she wanted to do. She was a remarkable woman, with huge personal qualities, a most cherished friend.

Having been a painter himself for a number of years, he realised that there was no gallery in Dublin showing the work of young artists and was about to open the Davis Gallery in the rooms above his family's rubber stamp shop in Capel Street. I had just left NCAD and, in spite of the fact that I was working in an unusual and unproven medium (batik), he gave me my first show and I began to imagine, how, just how unusual the Davis Gallery was in its early years. It showed new as well as estab lished artists, ceramic and textiles as well as traditional painting and sculpture, and all on the north side of the Liffey. Gerald made buying art fun: there was often food (smoked salmon, cream cheese and bagels which he called a Jewish New York breakfast) at Sunday morning openings, sometimes music - usually very good jazz. I bought my first painting there as did many who are now established collectors. And - best of all for us, the artists - the Davis Gallery paid us within a few weeks of making the sale. Alongside all the work he was doing on behalf of other artists, he was also painting and exhibiting in galleries both in Dublin and around the country. He loved the act of painting - the smell of oil paint on canvas and the sheer thrill when work was going well. He was far too often flippant about what he did; hiding how much his painting mattered to him, how important it was. He hated the fact that painting as he knew it seemed to be in the doldrums and had no time for the sort of shoddy, unimaginative and downright dull work that he felt was being shown in many galleries - especially those in receipt of state funding. He wrote long and elaborate letters in the newspapers, to IMMA, to the Douglas Hyde Gallery (and probably to CIRCA too), bemoaning the demise of well crafted and well worked-out painting and sculpture. He fought hard for what he believed in. When he was diagnosed with cancer of the larynx in 2003 he treated the news in quite a matter-of-fact way. He had it, it had been caught early, he would have the treatment and he would beat it. He continued painting, went to Annamakerrig, made more paintings and had more treatment. He had one operation, then another. When he could no longer talk, he wrote in a reporter's spiral notebook. He never gave up or lost his sense of humour. I still have, in my phone, the last text he sent me. I asked him could he come to lunch and he texted back, "Probably, but I am a lousy conversa tionalist!" Gerald David lived his life as he wanted to. He gave gave encouragement to me and to many other artists over the years. He was a good friend. I miss him.
