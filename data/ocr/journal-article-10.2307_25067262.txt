<plain_text><page sequence="1">Herri met de Bles's Sleeping Peddler: An Exegetical and Anthropomorphic Landscape Michel Weemans The Sleeping Peddler Robbed by the Apes (Fig. 1) is one of the most significant works of the exegetical painter Herri met de Bles, a Flemish artist working in the second third of the sixteenth century.1 Given the fact that the profane subject of this painting is an exception in Bles's oeuvre, this statement may seem paradoxical.2 On a structural level, however, its confor mity to a common model of visual exegesis is striking, despite its iconographie singularity.3 Because of what it represents? the accident that thrusts the traveling merchant from the ordinary sense of his existence, the boundless immoderation of the apes who rob him in his sleep?The Sleeping Peddler Robbed by the Apes is an extravagant painting in the usual sense of the term. But there is a second meaning at work here, an exegetical extravagance. Certain representatives of structural exegesis (Ian Ramsay, Paul Ricoeur) see biblical stories? parables, proverbs, proclamations?as having a common principle of extravagance:4 their enigmatic and paradoxical dimension is meant to shake the reader and provoke a break with his usual conception of existence, thereby leading to a "reorientation through disorientation."5 According to Ram sey, this trait of extravagance is indissociable from a second characteristic of biblical stories, their telos, or common qual ifier (the eschatological announcement called the Celestial Jerusalem, the Kingdom of God, or the Vision of God). Extravagance is thus a response to the tension between the ordinary nature of the story and the extraordinary aspect of the telos, for which Ricoeur prefers to use the stronger term scandal.6 In the painter's own time, Desiderius Erasmus re formulated the classical theory of exegesis of the four senses in a comparable manner. For Erasmus, exegesis is the dialec tical tension between the two extremes of literal and anagogic meaning, reconciled by the paradoxical, enigmatic figure of allegory.7 Envisaged in this light, as a visual exegesis, The Sleeping Peddler Robbed by the Apes becomes a space of transfor mation and conversion in which, for centuries, a visual chal lenge?a surprise for the eyes, an extravagant anamnesis? has been lying undetected.8 Apes or Diaboli For Karel van Mander, the singularity of the subject of The Sleeping Peddler Robbed by the Apes was matched only by the importance of the landscape, which he qualified as "grandi ose." It is the only painting described in detail in his biogra phy of Bles.9 The subject?the story of a peddler who stops to rest in the forest and is fleeced in his sleep by a band of apes who then proceed to string his treasure in the tree branches like garlands?has its origin in the medieval tradition of diaboli, in which apes represent the irrational, absurd side of human nature, the idea of evil opposed to good and virtue. The tradition of diabolical apes was reworked extensively in painting, engraving, literature, and proverb during the six teenth century. The Antichrist and demons were called apes or imitators of God in sermons and religious pamphlets, and preachers warned against "apes of the apostles who destroy all, like the apostles of the Antichrist."10 Martin Luther be lieved in the diabolical nature of apes, and John Calvin denounced the Anabaptists as "falsifying apostles like apes and not true imitators."11 The common Christian denomina tion of Christ's enemies as "men imitating apes" may explain van Mander's interpretation of Bles's painting: In Amsterdam, in Waermoestraet, at Marten Papen broeck's place, one can see a beautiful and grandiose landscape by him in which, lying under a tree, a peddler is sleeping while a multitude of apes rob him of his wares, hang them from the trees and amuse themselves at his expense. According to some, it is a satire of the papacy. The apes are Martins, or Martinists, supporters of Luther, who have discovered the sources of the Pope's revenues, which they refer to as "haberdashery." However, this inter pretation is subject to caution, and perhaps Henry in tended nothing of the sort, as art should not be an instru ment of satire.12 We should take note of van Mander's anecdote and his skepti cism regarding a politicoreligious allusion as determining the meaning of the painting. To this erudite humanist, the land scape with the sleeping peddler was more an evocation of the topos, common in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, of the dream vision, and in this it conformed to "the idea of interior choice and at the same time to the assumption at the basis of medieval 'moralizations,' which viewed fables as having a mean ing, an exemplary value for Christians."13 The first extensive interpretation of the painting was given by Horst W. Janson. In a passage from chapter 7 of Apes and Ape Lore, he compares it to a contemporary poem by the German meistersinger Hans Sachs, "Der Kremer mit der Affen" ( 1555).14 Janson recalls the visual rather than literary origin of this episode, the first instances of which were found by Aby Warburg and Fritz Saxl15 in Gothic marginalia or drolleries.16 It is worth noting that, contrary to the usual schema, here the text originated in images. Two woodcuts from the end of the fifteenth century, one Florentine and the other Swabian (Fig. 2), precede the engraving by Hans Wei ditz that appeared in the German edition of Petrarch's De reemidis (1532) and that was certainly known to the German poet. Nevertheless, as Janson notes, Hans Sachs's poem in troduces various new elements: the peddler is described as being old and poor, and the wicked apes flee when he awakens, leaving him to the sight of his scattered and irre trievable merchandise. Everything leads up to the moral ex emplum developed in the third and final part of the poem, in which those who, like the apes, rob and take advantage of honest, industrious men are condemned.

(59.5 X 85.5 cm). Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden, Gem?ldegalerie Alte Meister (artwork in the public domain, photograph ? Copyright the Trustees of the British Museum) form of the poem is in keeping with van Mander's allusion to "Martinists," and certain new aspects found in the text are also present in Bles's painting. Janson proceeds to list the matching details in the painting and the poem: the dignified air of the aged peddler, the emphasis on the goods strung high in the branches, and also the addition of a panic stricken figure who, he believes, personifies the second verse of the poem in which the peddler awakens. However, it is hard to follow Janson in his conclusion that Bles must have been given a translation of Sachs's poem at the time of the commission and infers that the painter relied on a single textual source chosen for him by the commissioner. Our difficulty increases when he adds that while the figures in Bles's painting are certainly based on those of the traditional repertoire of diaboli, the relation is purely formal and that they are entirely bereft of the symbolic density associated with them in Gothic marginalia. One wonders why Janson, after having recognized Bles's use of figures from the diaboli tra dition, whose iconographie wealth he has demonstrated and analyzed, goes on to deny the significance of these inten tional borrowings. It is even more surprising that having identified the visual origin of the theme, Janson should then revert to a narrow and isolating iconology, which treats the picture in the light of a single textual source, a key text that is supposed to provide an exhaustive explanation. Using this model of a direct correspondence between text and image contributes to a simplified interpretation that reduces the painting to an illustration of the moral of Sachs's text, to the formal repetition of a simplified iconographie repertoire, to a moralizing farce typical of the Flemish repertoire. One could say that the art historian's judgment has been distorted by an isolating interpretation in two ways. First, he fails to consider the painting in relation to the entire corpus of the painter, in which the presence of an exegetical schema be comes evident. Second, he neglects the associations and ten sions that structure the painting itself. The model that grants logical supremacy to a single textual source, thereby linking image to text, is, in fact, a hindrance when it comes to the exegetical interpretation of the image. As Paolo Berdini states, "Because the correspondence model derives its coher ence from denying to beholding a cognitive or critical role, what it undermines is the notion of understanding as a fundamentally phenomenological act and, with it, the phe nomenology of a specific understanding such as behold ing."17 Furthermore, an interpretative model that pretends to attempt a complete understanding through the discovery of correspondences between an image and its textual source not only limits the viewer's experience of the work but also</page><page sequence="3">HERRI MET DE BLESS SLEEPING PEDDLER 451 overlooks the humanist predilection for the multiplication of levels of meaning, failing to recognize the painting's "iconic density."18 Bles's paintings demonstrate a high degree of artistic awareness, interweaving visual, literary, theological, biblical, classical, and vernacular references. Instead of the textual model predominating over the im age, the concept of visual exegesis implies that the painting is not the visualization of a text but of an interpretation,19 related not only to the fable but also to the Book of Nature.20 The interpretation can be seen in the painting's details as in it as a whole, in its figures as in its pictorial morphology. We must, therefore, look more carefully at the play of polarity and tension in the painting and consider that this humanist painter's visual exegesis involves subtle operations of revival, displacement, and transformation of the diaboli repertoire and of previous engravings on the theme of the peddler. This will lead us to discern in Bles's painting the linking of the visual tradition of diaboli with the no less fundamental theme of the sleeping figure. Diaboli and Vanitas The general structure of the painting, from the position of the sleeping peddler under a tree in the foreground, the peculiar way he is lying, and his elbow propped on an open basket with its contents spilling out to the agitation of the apes directly above him in the branches, strewn with his wares, and the frenzied dance in the forest, is clearly in debted to representations of the peddler in engravings from the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. However, the transformations wrought by Bles are more significant than these similarities.21 In all the known engravings, the episode is depicted as a sort of vignette combining two elements: the peddler in a deep sleep at the foot of a tree with an open bag at his side, and the apes, in great number, mimicking human attitudes and manipulating the contents of the vanae merces (belts, gloves, shoes, caps, necklaces, and small musical in struments), adapted to their grotesque parody. This precise schema may be found in all the engraved variations of the subject up to those of Pieter Bruegel (Fig. 3) and Pieter van der Borcht (Fig. 4) emphasizing the group of apes who are busy undressing the peddler and shamelessly searching his body while dirtying his clothing. Bles's painting maintains the contrast between the unbridled agitation of the animals and the heavy inertia of the sleeping peddler. In other ways, though, it departs radically from the engravings. Rather than stressing the parodie and satiric uses of the looted objects, it proposes a wider variety of actions intentionally borrowed from the traditional repertoire of diaboli. As we shall see, some ten perfectly identifiable, specific motifs and their con figuration through repetition and successive juxtaposition serve to amplify a general set of themes. The distance that separates the figure sleeping at the foot of the tree from the high branch strewn with the treasure of ribbons, bracelets, and necklaces demonstrates the irremedi able inaccessibility of the lost goods (Fig. 5). The glittering colored adornments set against the deep green of the forest, the golden bracelets displayed ostentatiously by the apes, and the big hollow pearls floating on the surface of the spring suggest the idea of an illusory world. This idea is underlined by a series of corollary motifs, such as the ring of dancing 2 The Sleeping Peddler Robbed by the Apes, Florence, ca. 1470-80, engraving (artwork in the public domain; photograph ? Copyright the Trustees of the British Museum) apes deep in the forest, one of the most common metaphors for both the instability of worldly goods and humans' inca pacity to detach themselves from them. Bles was probably familiar with this theme, which has its origin in a fable by Lucian in which a king painstakingly trains a troop of masked and costumed apes to dance; then one day, someone throws some nuts at them, and the civilized dance is transformed into a savage scramble.22 This fable, translated and published in Flanders at the beginning of the sixteenth century, is mentioned by Erasmus in his Adages for its value as a moral exemplum denouncing Christian imitators ready to jump at opportunities to sin thrown their way by the Devil. Another loan from the diaboli tradition, popularized by Israhel van Meckenem in a widely distributed and much-copied series of engravings, is a pair of apes chained together and caressing each other or, in Bles's variant, playing cards.23 Associated, as it is here, with the dancing ring of apes, it reinforces the theme of human beings as earthly creatures, prisoners of worldly passions. To these two motifs, Bles connects one of the major themes of the diaboli iconology: that of a bird confronted with an ape, or the soul aspiring to deliverance that is threatened by diabolical forces.24 The landscape contains several variations on this theme: a bird in a cage (a representation of Spes, the virtue of Hope, or of the soul as prisoner of its earthly body), just grabbed by an ape, its fate rendered explicit by the dead</page><page sequence="4">462 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2006 VOLUME LXXXVIII NUMBER 3 3 Pieter van der Heyden, after Pieter Bruegel, The Sleeping Peddler Robbed by the Apes, published 1562 by H.

The contrast between the frailty of the soul and bestiality is am plified by the scene in which two apes pet a small animal, perhaps a dog. This corresponds to an ancient and widely held belief that the excessive and uncontrolled love of apes for children, young animals, and their own offspring could lead to the latter's death by suffocation. Among the diaboli, the "ape and owl team"25 holds a special place. This couple, which is to be found throughout the Gothic period and the Renaissance, symbolizes the union of two evil animals tradi tionally associated with damnation.26 This combination of variations on the frailty of the soul confronted with earthly and diabolical bestiality establishes a dominant theme related to the sleeping figure, which is crystallized in the ape with the mirror, or the vanitas ape</page><page sequence="5">5 Bles, The Sleeping Peddler Robbed by the Apes, detail with the diaboli around the sleeping peddler (artwork in the public domain) HERRI MET DE BLESS SLEEPING PEDDLER 453 (Fig. 6). Its isolation in the foreground emphasizes this major polysemous figure, at once a metaphor of vanity, the image of the prisoner of self-love, and a parody of man in search of his soul.27 Included in all the Flemish versions of The Sleeping Peddler Robbed by the Apes, be it that of Bles, Bruegel, or Pieter van der Borcht, it marks the culmination of a tradition stem ming back to the end of the fifteenth century with the il lustrated works of Johann Baemler, Sebastian Brant, and Erasmus, in which Dame Folly, personifying all human weak nesses, walks a bespectacled fool and an ape with a mirror on a leash. Their attributes symbolize their role, which is to show blind men their own folly through the magnifying glass of caricature. The Peddler's Dual Nature If it is wrong to reduce Bles's painting to a simple Flemish comic farce and to see in it a Christian iconographie reper toire emptied of its symbolic meaning, and if the diaboli can more readily be interpreted as the instruments of a visual exegesis, what relation do they have with the sleeping figure? This leads us to the question of the meaning of the peddler's sleep, which Eric de Bruyn answers in a brief and stimulating analysis of Bles's painting.28 Like Janson, de Bruyn ap proaches the painting within the iconographie tradition of the sleeping peddler robbed by the apes. His interpretation is itself part of a subchapter of his vast work demonstrating the popularity and abundance of the peddler's figure in Flemish literature and visual arts from the end of the Middle Ages to the sixteenth century. The historical and cultural material that de Bruyn studied makes it possible for us to understand in greater depth the manner in which the humanist readers and viewers perceived and interpreted the figure of the ped dler. Eric de Bruyn sorts the abundant literary and visual exam</page><page sequence="6">464 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2006 VOLUME LXXXVIII NUMBER 3 6 Bles, The Sleeping Peddler Robbed by the Apes, detail with the ape holding a mirror (artwork in the public domain) pies of the peddler into three distinct categories. The first one reflects a negative image of the peddler, who incarnates various forms of sin and folly: cheating, luxury, cupidity, drunkenness, and heresy. The second category corresponds to the positive image of a peddler who carries devotional handbooks or bears his bag as a priest bears the souls of the faithful. In between these opposite poles, at whose extremes the peddler is associated with either the Devil or with Christ (described as the "celestial peddler"), there is a third cate gory that could be qualified as the dual figure of the peddler, both positive and negative, linked to the Christian topos of the choice between vice and virtue and to the homo peregrina tor. Nevertheless, it is with the first category, the peddler's negative image, that Eric de Bruyn associates the icono graphie tradition of the peddler robbed by the apes, which includes Bles's painting.29 The most explicit example is found in the Italian engraving (Fig. 2) in which the peddler, leaning on an empty jug, clearly illustrates the theme of the peddler's drunkenness and its disastrous consequences, a theme extensively developed in literature. In the engravings by Pieter van der Borcht (Fig. 4) and by Pieter van der Heyden after Bruegel (Fig. 3), the vicinity of the apes confers a negative image to the figure of the sleeping peddler: their degrading attitudes and the choice of objects with negative connotations (glasses, mirror, knives, money bags) offer a catalog of the vicious behavior of sinful man, incarnated by the peddler himself.30 In these different representations, writes de Bruyn, the sleep of the peddler should be interpreted as a "spiritual sloth," "a mortal sin that alludes to a breach in religious duties, to the attachment to material goods and to terrestrial vanity."31 In Bles's painting, as de Bruyn points out, the negative connotation accrues to the distraught young assis tant who has neglected to guard the merchandise of his abused master.32 Unlike the negative figure of the engravings, the peddler in Bles's painting benefits from a nuanced interpretation, as Eric de Bruyn justly points out; in de Bruyn's book, Bles's peddler seems to foretell the positive figure of the peddler, a category discussed in the following chapter. But one needs to go even further, to step out of the iconographie circle within which the sleep of the peddler is linked to a negative mean ing as loss of vigilance toward the Devil and sign of "spiritual sloth" and to consider a broader meaning of the figure. I propose that Bles's interpretation instead corresponds to the category defined by de Bruyn as the "dual figure of the peddler." The duality of the peddler's figure, as understood by de Bruyn, may be defined through a single example, that of the play by the Flemish rederijker Cornelis Everaert, Tspel van Groot Labuer ende Sober Wasdom (1530).33 Half profane, half edifying, the play initially presents a negative character living in a state of illusion and "spiritual sleep." The peddler, Sober Wasdom (Hard Up), is in love with Couver Han delynghe (Prosperous Trading). To seduce her, he serenades her with a musical instrument called Scale Vondeken (De ceptive Discovery), from which the pitiful suitor manages to produce only a cacophony that leads to his rejection. The rejected peddler then receives a gift with an enigmatic value: the letter L, interpreted as Lyden (Resignation). The first part of the play insists on the material and carnal aspirations of the hero, until the decisive moment of the reversal.34 This turn is provoked by the intervention of a major character, often encountered in the plays of the rederijkers (sixteenth century poets and playwrights who belonged to local "cham bers of rhetoric") and just as often associated with a peddler. This character has been qualified by W. M. H. Hummelen as the waarschuwer. the "admonitor," or the one who warns; he addresses himself at the same time to the hero of the play and to its readers/spectators, inviting him/them to interpret the events in a moral and spiritual light.35 Beleedt van Wysheden (Testimony of Wisdom), the admonitor, suggests to the ped dler that he interpret the enigmatic L in a new way: as Liefde, or the Love for terrestrial goods that kept the peddler in a life of illusion. He advises him to reject Deceptive Discovery and to turn his hopes from illusory earthly vanities to the love of God and of heavenly goods. The tale follows a progression in three stages, according to a similar structure that de Bruyn found in other plays. The first stage corresponds to the negative figure of the peddler engaged in a carnal, illusory life, oblivious of God. The second stage brings the reversal of fortune: the admonisher appears, along with the topos of the "backward gaze" through which the peddler sees his past errors and finds himself transformed. Finally, in the third stage, after having transformed his bag of sins into a bag of virtues, the now-positive figure of the repentant peddler gives an edifying speech praising trust in divine mercy. Several common features between the play and the paint ing may be proposed: the accent placed by Bles on the dispersal of material goods; their cheap, junklike appearance and their evident inaccessibility; the use of topoi such as the soul as prisoner; the round dance of the apes or the vanitas ape with the mirror36?all of these correspond to the moral izing warning about the vanity of terrestrial goods and the superiority of spiritual values. These elements alone, how ever, do not indicate a duality, that is, a transition from a</page><page sequence="7">HERRI MET DE BLES'S SLEEPING PEDDLER 465 7 Bles, The Sleeping Peddler Robbed by the Apes, detail with four apes observing the sleeping peddler (artwork in the public domain) negative state embodying terrestrial blindness to the positive state of spiritual discernment. In order to discover in Bles's painting evidence of the dual nature of the peddler, it is necessary to examine the means by which the painting man ages to represent certain motifs visually, such as the discovery of illusion, the intervention of a waarschuwer, and the process of conversion, as well as the "backward gaze" reflecting (on) the sinful life of the past and the choice of a virtuous path toward heavenly goods. The fact that Bles's pictorial strategy consists in developing, in his unique manner, the topos of the dual figure of the peddler and the "reversal of the gaze" preceding a movement of conversion is a point that we shall examine below. First, we must look beyond the negative equation of sleep as sloth in order to analyze the symbolism of the figure of the sleeping peddler in Bles's painting. By distancing ourselves from a traditional iconographie ap proach and by placing the accent on the relation of herme neutical dynamics between the spectator and the image that is integral to an exegetical approach, we could say, with Maria Ruvoldt, that we consider the interpretation of the peddler's sleep less as a fixed equation?a negative one, with moral or spiritual sloth?than as a humanist expression emphasizing the ambiguity, the refinement, and the multiplication of meaning.37 Sleep and Vacatio Not a single study has paid attention to the way in which the sleeping figure in Bles's painting is emphasized by a group of apes without precedent, either in the other known versions of The Sleeping Peddler Robbed by the Apes or in the iconographie tradition of the diaboli. Bles's painting is alone in developing the scopic theme of four apes observing the sleeper (Fig. 7). This theme might more appropriately be termed displace ment rather than an invention, since what in fact is at work here is the reinterpretation and transformation of an icono graphie schema that opposes deep sleep and watchful besti ality. Millard Meiss traces the importance of this schema throughout the first half of the sixteenth century.38 Images showing a sleeping figure watched by one or several others who observe the sleeper with absolute freedom undoubtedly owe their popularity, evidenced by the theme's appearance in numerous representations, primarily to the force of the theme: a sleeping subject reduced to the status of a pure object in a process of objectification in which the sleeper ceases to be a person and becomes an open scene, obscene.39 The marked facetiousness of Pieter Bruegel's and Pieter van der Borcht's engravings has a more muted and subtle manifesta tion in Bles's version in the image of the ape tickling the peddler's ear with a straw. However, a more somber meaning is conveyed by the silent and worrying gaze of the diaboli. It evokes the idea of a deathly gaze that transforms the sleeper into an ambiguous figure and likens sleep to a praeparatio (Erasmus) for death, "the only experience given us which anticipates and approaches, be it in vain, the fundamental experience of the end that escapes us."40 If in older exempla sleep embodied cunning or sloth, during the Renaissance it acquired a new dominant function as dream or revelation. Bles's sleeping peddler must be seen in the light of this powerful image of sleep in its positive r??valuation, with both Christian and facetious ramifica tions.41 Meiss describes the concept of sleep, developed in the Renaissance, as vacatio, which predisposes the sleeper to contemplation and communication with the Divine.42 In six teenth-century painting, the figure of vacatio as dream and a means of access to the Divine had become popular in the form of moralizing mythological scenes and Christian varia tions highlighting vanitas and the ambiguity of sleep as a metaphor of death. We see the emergence of representations of the Christ Child asleep in the arms of the Virgin as a premonitory figure of the piet?,43 with the legend "Ego</page><page sequence="8">466 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2006 VOLUME LXXXVIII NUMBER 3 dormivi et chor (m) eu (m) vigila" (I sleep, but my heart waketh),44 the verse from the Song of Solomon, which is interpreted as a retreat from the world through sleep in order to contemplate God.45 The interpretation of Bles's peddler as a depiction of va catio, or a figure that anticipates death, is confirmed by a later version of the theme entitled The Dream.46 As in Bles's paint ing, the peddler is resting under a tree,47 but the multiple actions of the diaboli have been reduced to a single motif: the ring of dancing apes, successive variations of which are re peated throughout the painting. In the foreground, an ape musician leads a ring of gallant apes that seem about to exit to the right. In counterpoint to this group, in the back ground, a ring begins on the left with a procession of soldier apes and concludes to the right with a burial scene. In the center, a frenzied ring circles a pole topped by a second ring of apes spinning like dervishes. This theme is repeated in all directions, from top to bottom and left to right, from the foreground into the distance?an image of compulsive rep etition and instability ruling the world?in a sort of parodie variation of the old dances of death. All these rings serve to amplify the dominant, central motif of the sphere, symbol of the unstable world, on which the peddler (whose heavy iner tia, characteristic of the figure of vacatio, contrasts with the frenzied agitation of the apes) is resting. For humanist viewers, the presence of a sleeping figure usually signaled that the image concerned a vision or revela tion.48 This should not stop us, however, from recognizing the more specific modality linked to the themes of vanitas and death through the related diaboli figures. Following Meiss, Ruvoldt has insisted on the particular links between sleep, dream, and death in sixteenth-century representations of sleeping figures.49 To understand those links, it is worth noting the passage from the idea of death as an awful expe rience and punishment for sin to a new conception found in certain devotional tracts, which sought to "remove fear of death [oster la crainte de la mort]." Death becomes the prelude of resurrection,50 and this is expressed by the paradox of death as gain. Death is a gain because death is a grain: "Ut Semina sicca Virescent" (They will live again like dry grain), "Spes Altereae Vitae" (Waiting for eternal life) declares a contemporary emblem depicting a skull with budding branches coming out of its sockets.51 This new conception of death as hope of redemption and spiritual rebirth52?mani fest in the melancholic gisants, leaning on one elbow, of Bles's Antwerp contemporary Frans Floris53?found its major expression in Erasmus's De praeparatione ad mortem, published in 1532 in Basel, widely translated and republished in many editions.54 In this last great theological text by the Dutch humanist, the themes of loss as gain and material reality as illusion are articulated, for the last time, with a major Eras mian leitmotif, the Pauline opposition between visibilia and invisibilia:55 We are travellers in this world. . . . Our whole life here is nothing but a journey towards death . . . but death is the gateway to eternal life. . . . "The things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal," says Paul. . . . That is why that divine psalmist cries out, "Lead out my soul from its prison so that it may confess your name, O Lord." . . . This is how truly pious men feel; al though their bodies are on earth, their treasure, their heart, their "citizenship is in heaven." ... It has not been granted to all to say with Paul, "To me life is Christ and death is gain."56 The fundamental Erasmian opposition of spiritual truth and invisibility to material reality and illusory visibility is given metaphoric expression in the text through a series of themes and motifs. These include treasure, the traveler, the soul imprisoned in the body, death as dispersion, loss as gain, and the illusory character of the visible world. There is a striking similarity between these metaphors and the figures in Bles's painting. The very notion of meditatio (preparation) rejoins that of vacatio, referring, as it does, to the idea of a temporary departure of the soul from the body in a sort of revelation or ecstatic delight.5 The Dresden painting places Bles, along side Everaert or Erasmus, as one of the great sixteenth century interpreters of the Christian theology of indifference to material goods. This model of pious conduct opposes those who use the good things of the world to those who abuse them, those who live according to the flesh to those who, living according to Christ, have renounced the material and carnal and are "transported towards celestial things."58 In his manual De praeparatione ad mortem, Erasmus reminds his read ers that practicing death is practicing true life, the life freed from material attachment (what he also calls the philosophy of Christ). Such thinking strikes men of flesh as pure folly. But if we invert the carnal gaze to a spiritual gaze, what seems crazy will be revealed to possess true meaning and what seemed the norm becomes illusory. How does Bles's painting visualize a dual and paradoxical structure similar to those provided by contemporary Chris tian authors like Everaert and Erasmus? In other words, what in Bles's painting represents motifs of blinding and illusion, of warning and the "backward gaze," signifying meditation on a life of sins and a reversal involving the choice of a virtuous path leading to the heavenly goods? How did the painter develop in his own manner the topos of the reversal that leads to the peddler's conversion from a negative to a positive figure in the rederijkers'plays? To find a truly pictorial strategy equivalent for this movement of conversion in Bles's paint ing, we must examine the landscape as a whole. It would be misleading to apply visual exegesis solely to the narrative figures. It can initially refer to the representation of a vision, as suggested by the conventional figure of the sleeper. How ever, the vision in the image is not the simple product of the narrative figure. The latter would imply making a clear dis tinction between figure and ground, between significant el ements and merely formal ones, which is precisely what Bles's exegetical landscapes tend to blur. They are founded in a dynamic conception of exegesis that structures the painting as a space of transformation involving the image as a whole. The idea of landscape as visual exegesis not only renders isolating iconology and the primacy of a textual source dubi ous but also challenges the prejudice of seeing the landscape as a neutral ground in which only the figures carry mean ing.59 It is through its effects of morphology, juxtaposition, and polarity, in its imaging materiality, that Bles's landscape thematizes vision and brings visual exegesis into play.60</page><page sequence="9">HERRI MET DE BLES'S SLEEPING PEDDLER 467 Crypto-anthropomorphosis and Conversion of the Gaze Thus, the Dresden painting contains many motifs that recur throughout Bles's repertoire, arranged in an antithetic schema, the organizing principle of many of his landscapes.61 A bilateral opposition is established between the scene on the left, showing the sleeping peddler robbed by apes, and the right side of the image, which we have not yet examined. There, on a protuberant rocky mound, we find a group of apes made conspicuous by their isolation. This basic opposi tion is accentuated by several specific motifs from Bles's repertoire. The familiar negative figure of the blind man led by a child is the counterpoint on the right (in the middle ground) to the "visionary" figure of the sleeping peddler. This opposition is echoed and amplified by the framing antithesis of the dead or destroyed tree on the left?con nected to the illusory treasures?and the green leafy tree, an allegory of the Resurrection, that frames the painting on the right.62 This schema, which often structures Bles's land scapes, involves a double polarity?left/right, low/high?and reflects the double opposition of literal/spiritual, terrestrial/ celestial.63 The two horizontal antitheses (the visionary figure and the blind man, the two trees) are complemented by a vertical axis that links several powerful motifs of passage. The remarkable and strange natural rocky arch that dominates the landscape, the luminous, celestial, anagogic qualifier of Bles's landscape, is echoed by its terrestrial counterpoint, the conspicuous dark rocky cavity in the center foreground. The ape and owl, animals usually found in strategic emplacements in Flemish painting, point to this second rocky arch with insistence, indicating a significant detail. Here, they combine deictic and admonitory roles. As one begins to look closely at this separate group of diaboli, with their scheming airs, their gestures and postures, a precise configuration of echoes, repetitions, and juxtapositions becomes apparent. In a man ner symmetrical to that of the ape and owl group, the ape with the strangled duck directs our attention to a second, less obvious rocky cavity, and to the exploring ape in the shadows there. The link of complicity between the diaboli extends to the ape with the mirror, whose specular and scopic value strongly implies both admonition and inclusion of the spec tator. The attitude of our miniature double, bent over a convex mirror that looks like an enormous dark eye, is an invitation to effect a corresponding reversal in our own gaze. If we look at the painting afresh?or give its reproduction a quarter turn counterclockwise?the synthetic meaning of the details signaled with such insistence by the diaboli becomes evident: a hidden face appears (Fig. 8) ! This face with a high forehead, shown in profile, is outiined by a single stroke that begins just above the ape with the mirror and is prolonged by a protuberant nose with a slightly curved end. The first dark cavity is an eye socket, and the ape and owl show us the beginning of the second eye. The dark cave, being visited by the exploring ape and ironically tickled by the dangling legs of the strangled bird, is a nostril, which is followed immedi ately by a recess and a crack in the rock tracing the delicate line of a sardonic mouth. A protuberant jaw is made partic ularly evident by vegetation that becomes a green, leafy tree/ beard. In order to effect a metamorphosis of the rocky, verdant mass and stabilize the "hints of aspects [soup?ons dfaspect]n64 8 Bles, The Sleeping Peddler Robbed by the Apes, detail with the crypto-anthropomorphosis (artwork in the public domain) in this figure, it was necessary to look closely at the clues provided by the diaboli, holders of the secret of a crypto anthropomorphosis. The structuring principle here is similar to that of Arcimboldo's combined heads in which a double articulation (each natural element corresponds to a part of the face) is associated with reversibility (set in one direction, the image is a landscape, in another, a portrait). This sup poses a readjustment of the gaze, a change in scale, and an effect of surprise. What makes Bles's double image different from Giuseppe Arcimboldo's is its cryptic character. While the double image in the portraits made by the painter of Rudolf II is immediately visible, Bles's anthropomorphism appears only if the viewer is attentive to the exegetical logic of the painting. In other words, the optic phenomenon is indis sociable from the hermeneutic process. This is why we should understand the gestures of the peddler's associate as having no effect in the register of narrative fiction (Fig. 5).

The role played by the panic-stricken figure is less fictional and narrative than pictorial and exegetical. He gives meaning to the picture not as the peddler's associate but as the pictorial associate of the diaboli in the strategy of double mimesis, surprise, and revelation of the visual puzzle. The painting, then, depends not so much on a textual source that would give it unequivocal meaning, as Janson would have it, as on a pictorial and exegetical logic. All images in painting possess their part of sleep: every painting is sleep awaiting the watchful observer. Erasmus uses a similar image when he describes the texts of Scripture as the shell in which Christ's spirit is enclosed, waiting for the vivifying scrutatio of the exegete-reader. One particular detail in Bles's painting seems to suggest this: the few strokes of red and yellow illuminating like a flame the dark hollow of the rocky anthropomorphosis (Fig. 9). This detail is easily iden tified as a goldfinch, whose emphatic visibility derives from its intrusive character and intense color. This tiny pictorial de tail is at once bird and eye, at once colorful spot and allegor ical motif, pupil and spark of the soul. Pupilla and scintilla anima, these two notions that designate discernment and contemplation in the Christian oculocentric tradition,65 here intimate the chiasmus of gazes intended to operate between the eye socket of the rocky skull (one pole of the pictorial structure) and corresponding sockets (the living eyes of view ers who will successively gaze at the painting) .66 In the tradi tion of compound images and double mimesis, Bles's gold finch-pupil is the equivalent of the principle of paronomasia, mentioned by Roland Barthes in connection with the heads of Arcimboldo:67 the evocation of one thing by another that has the same shape (generally, the coincidence of the eye of the compound portrait with the eye of one of the animals in the assemblage).68 However, in Bles's painting, the semantic charge of the paronomasia is intensified, as much by its pictorial position as by the play of symbolic and historical artistic references. The goldfinch pupilla and scintilla anima is at the heart of a particularly dense scopic configuration that associates, through effects of proximity and polarity, the three visual motifs of the blind man guided by the child, the earthly hollow, and the celestial orbit. It is also a pole of the vertical axis in the center of the painting whose other pole, linked by the admonitory ape and owl couple, is the equally powerful Christological symbol of the mill. The met aphor of the Book of Nature implies infinite and subtle correspondences between Creation and the Creator; in a similar way, the relations of proximity and correspondence between the two Christological symbols of the goldfinch and the mill appear as the trace, or reminiscence, of a configu ration that accompanied the emergence of landscape in the altarpieces of Hans Memling and Jan Provost, where the Christ Child on the Virgin's lap holds a goldfinch in one hand and points with the other toward a shining water mill in the center of the landscape framed by the window.69 In Bles's painting, though, the Christological motif of the mill takes on a new importance specifically related to the idea of conver sion. Its privileged position at the center of the landscape can be interpreted as the topographical translation of the Chris tocentric definition of the Book of Nature. More important, given its proximity to the figure of the ape with the mirror and to the visual strength of its formal composition, it plays a second, formal role: a circle within a rectangle that echoes in miniature, at its very heart, the exact shape of the landscape and acts as an additional invitation to effect the movement of reversal and conversion. In the exegetical logic at work here, the left side of the landscape, with the apes scattering the treasure, represents the nightmarish dream of the peddler, perhaps expressed by the peddler's panic-stricken double, his assistant. At the same time, there is a second, tropological meaning of the dream in which loss becomes gain, as well as an anagogic one in which the earthly peregrinatio (pilgrimage) of a siendeblind (a Flemish expression designating a "blind seer" unable to recognize the divine nature of the one he leads to sacrifice)70 led by invidia and avaricia is transformed into the hope of a treasure of a higher order and the recovery of true Vision. Such is the meaning corresponding to the diagonal, ascendant axis spe cific to Bles's Weltlandschaft (world landscape), canalized and signaled by a series of recurrent symbolic motifs. The leafy tree is the starting point of a diagonal that is successively punctuated by the figure of the blind man led by the child, the nodal motif of the mill, and the rocky arches leading us toward the celestial arch that orients the exegetical trajectory in its anagogic meaning. The anthropomorphic rock, placed strategically at the crossing of the two axes,71 suggests a reversal of paths, from Vado Mori to Vive Deo, an exegetical conversion of the literal fable of the sleeping peddler into a figure of vacatio, a representation of death whose spiritual meaning consists of a tearing and a reversal that demands, according to Erasmus, an alter oculus.72 In this exegetical trajectory that stretches from the literal fable to the qualifier Visio Dei, the crypto-anthropomorphosis is the operator of con version from literal to spiritual meaning. In Bles's exegetical landscapes, it occupies the same structural position as the</page><page sequence="11">10 Pieter van der Heyden, after Pieter Bruegel, Elck, published 1558 by H.

The conflict between Christian values and the forces of capitalism in towns with budding market economies like Antwerp made the attitude toward material goods a crucial subject for Christian human ism in the north. Painters, theologians, rederijkers, and hu manist poets all sought an answer to the question of the behavior to be adopted by a Christian regarding the material world, not only in Scriptural sources but also in literary and visual moralizing traditions, both classical and vernacular. It is in this context that was created and popularized the figure of the shortsighted old merchant Niemand, wandering among a profusion of scattered goods, created in Germany by Joerg Schoen in 1507, and his derivatives, Elck and Chascun. The Peddler appears alongside Niemand, Elck, and Chascun as a variant of the single universal, allegorical figure embody ing the humanity of the Fall, blinded by greed.75 It is there fore not surprising to see Elck take the form of a peddler in the morality plays by Cornells Everaert or Dirck Volkertsz. Coornhert,76 or to see J?os de Damhouder's Chascun lying propped on a pouch with its contents scattered about, in a deep sleep77 that places the image, like Bles's Sleeping Peddler, under the sign of the dream vision.78 The most explicit confirmation of this close relation is undoubtedly found in Hans Holbein the Younger's Sleeping Peddler Robbed by the Apes, painted for Hans Baer in 1515, one of a pair of table runners whose pendant is none other than a representation of Nie mand.79 Among these multiple variations, the most striking parallel with Bles's painting is by far Bruegel's Elck (Fig. 10).80 The moral significance of the protagonist, embodying fallen hu manity's incapacity to find God,81 is amplified by Bruegel, in a manner reminiscent of Holbein's matching images, by the association of Elck, the greedy old merchant, with his double Niemand, the fool gazing at himself in the mirror. In both cases, attitudes and attributes?the thick glasses, the convex mirror, the extinguished lamps and candles?clearly point to the self-blinding ignorance of the characters in a play of echoes that is amplified and made explicit by the two cap tions: "Elck soect hem selven in alderley sacken" (Each per son looks for himself in all things), and "Niema[n]t en kent he[m] selve[n]" (No one knows himself).82 Studies on Elck have insisted on the connection between the theme of at tachment to worldly goods and that of self-blinding.83 They have also reminded us of the popularity in sixteenth-century Netherlands of the adage of the Delphic oracle, "Know thy self," numerous variations of which can be found in prov erbs, maxims, and Christian commentaries.84 Thus, it is not so much the moralizing theme regarding the attitude to be adopted toward material goods or the device of their scatter ing as the importance accorded to the acts of looking and judging that justifies the parallel between Bruegel's Elck and Bles's Peddler.

We have linked the stereotypical revival of diaboli figures (in particular, the variations on the denotative meaning of the traditional figure of the imprisoned, earthly creature or evil suffocating the soul) to the general theme of vanity. In addition, the apes in Bles's painting lend themselves to spe cifically visual, connotative variations, obviously connected to the dream figure and to the presence of the crypto-anthro pomorphosis. To humanists used to reading collections of adages and emblems, several apes would evoke a manifest proverbial allusion to deceit and illusion, as is true of the two apes previously described as petting a small animal. At the same time, they also allude to the proverb "De cat de bel aenbinden": to bell the cat, signifying the audacious who dare to reveal hidden and scandalous truths.85 Bles's use antici pates Bruegel, who in his Flemish Proverbs associates this motif with the many proverbial variations that place his picture under the dominant theme of deceit and self-blinding. In Bles's painting, as in Bruegel's, the interpretation of the proverb transposed as image depends not exclusively on the textual meaning but also on the visual relations of repetition, juxtaposition, proximity, and resonances within the image.86 Thus, this initial allusion to the theme of veiling and unveil ing is repeated by the ape with the mirror. The more com plex visual meaning of the central, mediating figure of the ape with the mirror is linked to its attribute, which denotes, as it does in Bruegel's Elck, the illusion of knowledge and whose appearance as a dark eye captivating the ape is, as we said, the negative counterpoint of the celestial arch, the anagogic qualifier of the landscape.87 Strategically positioned at the "forehead" of the anthropomorphic landscape, the ape with the mirror is also an evocative negative figure of the adage "Know thyself," the Delphic admonition attributed to the fool by Flemish humanists. In humanist culture, the convex surface of the ape's or fool's mirror also signified illusion: the illusion of a multiplied gaze revealing a surreal world and capable of parodying the Divine, all-seeing gaze. It entered for that reason in the category of malefic objects. In Bles's painting this is underlined by the small animals at tracted, like the ape, by the convex mirror. It thus seems to demonstrate a symmetrical relationship?on either side of the vertical axis in which the ape and owl couple link the two powerful Christian motifs?with the ape about to explore the cave (Fig. 11), whose interior remains inaccessible and con stitutes a figure of the nonrevealed hidden.88 The collections of Adagia that were fashionable during the sixteenth century contain various Flemish proverbs on the nose designating a revelation or a deception, which is what the painting visual izes in this area.89 Perhaps it is not gratuitous that the detail of the ape that holds the strangled duck before the rocky nostril should give the impression of projecting toward the real space of the viewer. This effect of pictorial opacity re turns the gaze to the surface of the image, while remaining a gesture of exhortation meant to indicate the image hidden "under our nose."90 Such an effect is comparable only to the manner in which several contemporary anamorphic land scapes designate the double mimesis by means of a detail painted in trompe l'oeil.91 Within this configuration, the strangler ape would have been recognizable as an obvious allusion to the proverbial expression "to pull a feather from one's nose," which meant to fool or to deceive, to betray, as do those who lie before the judge. The ape tickling the nostril of the giant sleeping in the landscape on the right echoes</page><page sequence="13">HERRI MET DE BLES'S SLEEPING PEDDLER 47I both the one who bells the cat and the one testing the depth of the peddler's sleep with the aid of a twig, all of them reinforcing the allusion to the Christian humanist paradox that views material reality as a world of inconsistent ghosts and illusory appearances while dream, or vacatio, unlocks the world of spiritual revelation and true realities. According to a plan that we may presume to be deliberate, all the fore ground figures?the ape who bells the cat, the panic-stricken figure, the ape with the mirror, the ape pointing to the owl, the ape tickling the nostril, and the ape exploring the cave? trace a continuous line, a horizontal axis that connects the two poles framing the image, the peddler and the crypto anthropomorphosis, which the gaze must scrutinize and ul timately interpret as figures of illusion and revelation. Finally, what justifies the parallel between Bruegel's Elck and Bles's Peddler is the fact that in both cases, the accumu lation of details signifying illusion and blindness in an em phatic and varied manner is related to the central pictorial principles netticheydt (meticulousness)92 and copia (abun dance) , which demand of the viewer the corollary virtues of scrutatio (scrutiny) and dicernere (discernment), the aptitude to recognize proverbial, religious, and philosophical refer ences, the capacity to identify and interpret humanist topoi. In both images, the juxtaposition of figures deceived by illusion and the connections between them correspond to a visual strategy of paradox and "bluff':93 an invitation to search for what Erasmus called the sensus germanus, the au thentic meaning beyond literal appearances.94 In Bles's painting, the apes' bluff is a bluff of signs. The allusions to sight, to the dangers of superficial vision, to the need to look carefully, as suggested by the apes, all these add up to a strategy elaborated in the humanist context of a crisis of interpretation, of intense questioning concerning exegesis and the signs in the two Books of the Creator, themselves understood as challenges to the human capacity for interpre tation. Crypto-anthropomorphosis and Visual Exegesis For authors, such as Ernst Kris and Dario Gamboni, inter ested in ambiguous or hidden images, the hypothetical and subjective character of any interpretation that privileges this type of image imposes the need to establish and respect pertinent criteria.96 These criteria are situated by Kris and Gamboni in the correspondence between interpretation and data such as the coherence of an ensemble, the use of enun ciative devices specific to the hidden image, the intentions of a painter, or the thought of an era. The questions raised by the presence of a hidden anthropomorphosis in the Dresden painting could be answered, in the form of a conclusion, by a brief evocation of these criteria. To begin with, it is neces sary to indicate that the Dresden painting is just one example, among many others, that illustrates a central hidden phe nomenon in Bles's oeuvre. When I reexamined Bles's paint ings from the angle of the exegetical paradigm, a "change of aspect"97 did in fact take place: it led me to discover various anthropomorphoses in more than twenty of his landscapes.98 This phenomenon, which had until now remained hid den?or had been overlooked?in the history of art, is de fined in Bles's works by two characteristics: the constant and varied profusion of anthropomorphic motifs, and their (effi 12 Athanasius Kircher, Campus anthropomorphus, engraving, from Ars magna lucis et umbrae, 1643. Biblioth?que Nationale de France, Paris (artwork in the public domain) cient) imperceptibility. The issue of abundance is important, because it places Bles among the major sixteenth-century representatives of double mimesis and, within this general category, of multiple forms of anthropomorphoses. The de velopment of these forms?a process that exceeds the length and scope of this article?found fertile terrain during the Renaissance in certain epistemological principles, such as signatures, analogy, and microcosmism, used to organize knowledge. Their development is partly related to the birth of the landscape itself: for many artists, the habit of imitating irregular rock formations, roots, and clouds led to a game in which Leon Battis ta Alberti, in a paragraph of De statua, recognized the very origins of art: this game consisted in emphasizing the accidental coincidence of a resemblance with a figure.99 Bles's anthropomorphoses thus partake of a long tradition ranging from the punctual insertion of an anthropomorphic motif in the middle of a landscape (such as in the famous anthropomorphic rock-sentinel guarding the passage in Albrecht Durer's Val dArco100) to the head-land scapes of Athanasius Kircher (Fig. 12), Josse de Momper, or Mattheus Merian. Although complex from a syntactic point of view, the latter examples are semantically less dense than Bles's anthropomorphoses, which, with their frequence, vari ety, and degree of indiscernibleness, clearly stand out among all the other existing expressions of this tradition.101 These characteristics can be attributed to the role anthropomor phosis plays in visual exegesis, as illustrated in the following examples. The first example occupies a special place in Bles's oeuvre, because, strictly speaking, it is not a hidden image. In Land scape with the Calling of Saint Peter (Fig. 13), a figure of a rock shaped like an eagle is immediately visible in the center of the image. This monumental ostentum naturale (natural sign) en gendered speculation and ambiguity of a kind that fueled debates concerning mirabilia in the sixteenth century: Is this an icastic representation?in other words, did the painter simply copy an existing natural image, creating a work a natura non ab arte (made by nature not man)? Or is this a fantastic representation?that is, should we see it as an inven tion of the painter meant to capture the viewer's imaginative attention? In Bles's case, the ambiguity and surprising nature of the image principally serve an exegetical pictorial strategy.</page><page sequence="14">472 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2006 VOLUME LXXXVIII NUMBER 3 ?#*?SW*$i?Ar* 13 Bles, Landscape with the Calling of Saint Peter, detail, oil on wood, 12% X 195/s in. (32 X 50 cm). Formerly collection of Kister (artwork in the public domain; photograph provided by Christie's) Following the Book of Nature and the Scriptures, the image is organized around a miraculous double apparition, a dou ble sign, or a double semeion, to use the Johannine term associated with the exegetical tradition. The semeion was a "sign" intended not only to impress but also to lead to self questioning, to confirmation of one's faith and spiritual un derstanding. It is the sign, as Erasmus specifies, of a schism between the light of faith and "those whose hearts were still in the darkness" of disbelief.102 It is no coincidence that the humanist exegete and the entire exegetical tradition that arose around the last apparition of Christ to the Apostles insistently pointed out the paradox of uncertainty, or of intermediate states: between night and day, between body and spirit, between the dead Christ and the resurrected Christ, between the nocturnal retrenchment of the Apostles and the calling to pursue Jesus' mission during the day, between the era of the historical witnesses of Jesus and that of the followers of the spiritual Christ. The pictorial strategy of the rocky eagle can be understood in terms of these classic issues concerning the exegesis of this episode. It consists, along with the central narrative mirabilium of the image, in bringing the viewer to experience a disquieting effect, similar to that experienced by the witnesses of the miraculous appa rition of the ambiguous figure who provoked wonder and doubt. Bles's pictorial exegesis activates the varied possibili ties of the semantic power assigned to the figure of the eagle, which is simultaneously a "psychagogic" and a "psychopomp" figure in Christian tradition (these terms designate what attracts and what elevates), a symbol of the regenerating and salvational value associated with the resurrection of Christ and an emblem of the first Apostle called to lead the Church and open the gates to Heaven. Far from a mere optical illusion, the rocky zoomorphic figure is indissociable from the visual exegesis in which it plays a dynamic role. The double figure of miraculous apparition expresses an invita tion to the exegete viewer of the image to establish a mean ingful analogy between the Scriptures and the Book of Na ture, between the biblical semeion of the last apparition of Christ come to designate his earthly successor and the osten tum naturale of an eagle-rock bearing the allegorical motif of the Church. Still within the perspective of a narrative relating to blind ness and vision, another crypto-anthropomorphosis by Bles highlights the role played by antithetic iconography, which generally coincides with a schema of chiasmus (as demon strated by the Dresden painting). In Landscape with the Con version of Paul on the Road to Damascus (Fig. 14) the vertical polarity between the arid, rocky landscape in the foreground and the sky with its divine apparition corresponds to the horizontal stretch of the landscape marked by the polarity between Jerusalem and Damascus at either end. The pres ence of multiple signs of passage?stairs, footbridges, distant arcades through which the convoy passes?here reinforces the impression that all the elements of the landscape partic ipate in an event that takes on a cosmic dimension. In this structure, the recurrent anagogic motif of the City of God is amplified by its juxtaposition with a halo of divine apparition, which Bles uses in many of his landscapes. The anthropomor phic character of this huge celestial eye is undoubtedly not gratuitous. In a pictorial context in which polar tensions play an important role, the eye is related to a second anthropo morphic motif opposite it on a slightly inclined vertical axis, which is its counterpoint. This motif is signaled by the stra tegic presence in a fold in the rock of another recurrent motif in Bles's oeuvre: his figured signature, the owl, which is obviously meant to capture our attention. The association of this humanist emblem of dicernere with a figure of blindness and reversal, the soldier who stumbles on the rock without seeing it?making it all the more evident?is clearly inten tional. The juxtaposition of the soldier hiding his eyes and a bird in hiding exhorts us to see the hidden image in a disquieting rendering of a rocky face, revealed by a reversal in</page><page sequence="15">HERRI MET DE BLES'S SLEEPING PEDDLER 473 14 Bles, Landscape with the Conversion of Paul on the Road to Damascus, oil on wood, 18 X 23V4 in.

In order for blindness to give way to vision, for the hidden image to be revealed or deciphered, the painting demands a drastic reversal of the gaze, echoing the one experienced by the saint, who tumbles from his horse at left. The era in which Bles worked, marked by religious tensions brought on by the Reformation, favored the the matic opposition between the satanic Antichrist (associated with illusory appearance), who embodies vice, and Christ (incarnating spiritual discernment). Bles's pictorial exegesis reflects this view; in his story of Saint Paul's conversion, he amplified its essence?the opposition between persecutor and predicator (persecutor and preacher)?in an antithetical schema that contrasts the pagan view, blind and turned to ward satanic illusion, with the Christian gaze turned toward Christ. Our third and last example?one of the most sophisticated anthropomorphic landscapes painted by Bles?reveals an in terpretation that emphasizes illusory appearance and para doxical reversal. In The Way to Calvary (Fig. 16), the painter uses and develops two of the pictorial processes found in other representations of the Calvary theme popular in Flanders between 1530 and 1560. First, the meeting between two categories of visual witnesses: the historical contemporar ies of Jesus and a group of Flemish peasants going to market. Bles underlines the distinction between the procession of the siendeblinden and the distant spectators of the scene, the painter's contemporaries; placed on the edge of the painting in the foreground and seen from the back, these figures invite the viewer to place himself in their visual hierarchy and to identify with them. Related to this first pictorial device, a second strategy consists in bringing the viewer to experience for himself the difficulty in perceiving the almost insignifi cant detail of Christ in the middle of the multicolored up roar. In this way, the painter rendered the theological ques tion of Christ's invisibility in the eyes of his historical witnesses. This is one of Erasmus's privileged themes, one that he developed extensively in his exegesis of this episode. Erasmus based his argument on three paradoxical figures: first, he recalls the biblical image of Christ compared to a worm (the most ridiculously insignificant creature to human eyes). He then comments on the mocking laughter of the Pharisees in the procession, whose effect is countered by the mocking laughter of an invisible God in Heaven (because, as Erasmus comments, God knows that Jesus' invisibility in the eyes of his blind historical witnesses will result in his ultimate universal visibility: the sign of the cross). Erasmus's exegesis on the theme of invisibility and appearance culminates with a third figure of paradox: the analogy proposed by the hu manist exegete between Christ and the Silenus, the mytho logical figure whose superficial ugliness provoked mocking laughter but hid a divine interior. The image of the Christ Silenus, and the paradox of the Silenic gaze (the capacity to discern true treasure hidden under an appearance of poverty or its opposite, the sordid?"a treasure of coals"?hidden under an appearance of respect and wealth) is the subject of The Sileni of Alcibiades, one of Erasmus's most widely read texts, which contributed to the great popularity of the Silenus figure in humanist culture.103 Its hybrid nature, its metamor phic capacity, and its masklike and paradoxical reversion value account for the place of honor that the Silenus occu pied in the art and literature of the sixteenth century. The fashion of the grotesques, disseminated in Antwerp through the engravings of Cornells Bos and Cornells Floris, helped to make familiar the snub-nosed physiognomy and mocking expression of the Silenus. Bles's painting joins this long Silenic procession: his visual exegesis brings out the themes of surface illusion and of the mocking gaze by making the paradox of the Christ-Silenus visible.

The smooth, rounded rock at the top left represents the forehead with, at one end, a tuft of hair and a rocky, leafy crown and at the other a snub nose and fleshy mouth. The landscape with the story of the mocked Christ-Silenus is at the same time a portrait of a mocking Silenus, with the winding procession wrapped around him like a frivolous ruff. These few examples of schematic summaries illustrate how the presence of a crypto-anthropomorphosis in Bles's oeuvre is always linked to the visualization of the paradoxical Chris tian notion of vision opposing illusory appearance and invis ible truth, carnal blindness and spiritual discernment. The characters depicted may be simultaneously those who live in deception or illusion and those who exemplify and experi ence spiritual discernment. However, as in the example of the distant spectators in The Way to Calvary or that of the sleeping peddler, the perception of faulty vision or illusory appearance by the characters in the image remains ambigu ous. As Larry Silver proposed about the landscapes painted by Hieronymus Bosch,105 it is quite possible that the characters in the painting are mere representations of blindness, since only a viewer outside the painting could overcome the de ceptive illusion and exercise true judgment. If the peddler's sleep can be interpreted as vacatio, this would suggest that revelation?that is, the reversal of the gaze, the perception of material reality as illusory surface, and the recognition of the superiority of the spiritual realm?may be experienced through the gaze and judgment of the actual spectator of the image, if not by the sleeping figure. Finally, a common char acteristic of the four paintings described above is that the hidden image is associated with an effect of a central gaze, a gaze that addresses the viewer, who unwittingly finds himself</page><page sequence="18">476 ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 2006 VOLUME LXXXVIII NUMBER 3 watched by the painting. The presence of an optical game in the exegesis would seem to make it clear enough that the ironic surprise partakes of the humanist jocoserium (satiric bent). In The Sleeping Peddler Robbed by the Apes, one must understand that if the apes do in fact imply a farce, this farce is adapted to the complex form of humanist irony mixing paradox, ambivalence, and multiple meanings.106 The points on which I have insisted?ind?termination, the exchange of gazes, within the paintings themselves and be tween the viewer and the painting, the image as a field of tensions?are aspects of visual exegesis that attempt to in volve the viewer in what he is seeing and provoke a herme neutical dynamic. This is the aim of a final motif that will lead us to consider the fundamental character of imperceptibility in Bles's anthropomorphoses. We must distinguish between two distinct forms of imperceptibility in Bles's work, both present in the Dresden painting. The first is related to what Odilon Redon, in an almost Wittgensteinian expression, called "hints of aspects (images within images), forms that are about to come into being or will take their being from the onlooker's state of mind. All things that are more than sug gestive, since they actually appear."107 Dario Gamboni re cently described this particular category with the term poten tial image, as an enunciative strategy of unstable apparition in which the viewer's attention has as much importance as the painter's intention.108 This category perfectly describes a sec ond anthropomorphosis in The Sleeping Peddler Robbed by the Apes whose presence we have not yet discussed, and whose perceptibility depends on its being put into relation with the first (Fig. 18). Looking closely, we can make out another, smaller anthropomorphic rock behind the first one. Almost indiscernible?as is perhaps indicated by its association with the blind man led by the child?it hovers somewhere be tween figuration and distortion. The irregular contours of the rock trace a wrinkled face with a low, receding forehead; the character seems to be eyeing, at the level of the small figure pushing a cart, the first hidden face. A jutting rock forms a long nose, which is interrupted by a deep rocky crack with the trickle of a stream springing from it: the outline of an enormous mouth that splits the face in two. The serene smile of the first face is met by the grimacing scowl of the second. Unlike this potential image, the large anthropomor phic rock in the foreground belongs to the category of the crypto-image, both because of its stability (once perceived, it remains manifest) and because of a deliberate pictorial strat egy involving processes of masking and unmasking. The Sleep ing Peddler Robbed by the Apes is exemplary in containing both kinds. The difficulty in perceiving the anthropomorphosis arises from a combination of procedures, including superpo sition, enclosure, fragmentation, discontinuity, change of scale, inversion, and metonymy. At the same time, as we have seen, the crypto-image, desiring to be revealed, surrounds itself with figures whose function is to attract attention, char acters whose value is less fictional or narrative than specifi cally pictorial and who present clues to both the presence of the anthropomorphosis and the means of deciphering it.109 In The Sleeping Peddler Robbed by the Apes, as in all of Bles's anthropomorphic landscapes, these indicatory figures gener ally have deictic, admonitory, phatic, and allegorical func tions, one or many of which they may assume. At the same 18 Bles, The Sleeping Peddler Robbed by the Apes, detail with the second anthropomorphosis (artwork in the public domain) time, their scopic value is specifically determined by the context of the visual exegesis.110 What does the cryptic character of Bles's anthropomorpho ses actually signify, if not the fact that this phenomenon is entirely motivated by the exegetical logic of his landscapes? In Bles's works, if there is disguise, the discovery of the hidden anthropomorphosis does not resolve the enigma; rather, it engages the viewer in a hermeneutic dynamic. The ideas of figure and figurability are useful here: the figure is "always between two things, two worlds, two temporalities, two modes of signification . . . between the perceptible form (schema) and its contrary, the ideal form (eidos)."111 This constitutive otherness is what renders the figure a dynamic force. In describing the crypto-anthropomorphoses in terms of the figure, we are able to take into account their value as operators of conversion in a pictorial exegesis, which, far from being dependent on and reducible to a verbal referent, is an authentically visual form of thought. Aside from their value as humanist jocoserium and beyond their exegetical func tion, the crypto-anthropomorphoses in Bles's work could be viewed as emblematic of every pictorial image in its ind?ter mination,112 its figurability?which involves plasticity and po tentiality, displacement and dissimulation?the latter, since the "secondary elements" of the background, parerga and cryptimage, not only participate in the meaning of the scene but also play an essential part in the exegetical strategy. In relation to the dream modality that determines The Sleeping Peddler Robbed by the Apes, the anthropomorphosis that haunts the landscape with the sleeping peddler confirms the idea that, in the pictorial image as in the dream, "the margin of ind?termination is the reverse of and the condition for an overdetermination,"113 and that in both image and dream, interpretation consists of exploiting plasticity, drawing atten tion to the potential of latent forms in the background, figures that may come into being depending on the multiple tensions that structure the image. In other words, in the exegetical trajectory at work in Bles's landscapes, hermeneu tics and phenomenology go hand in hand. The interpreta tion of the landscape as visual exegesis implies looking at the exegetical content and the pictorial structure as one. Envis aging Bles's landscapes as visual exegesis therefore supposes exceeding the traditional limits imposed on an iconographie</page><page sequence="19">HERRI MET DE BLES'S SLEEPING PEDDLER 477 theme; "vision" here is less a "figurative figure" than a figurai work, less a narrative factor (the representation of a story of apparition) than a process of optical and semiotic conver sion. It is significant that Bles's anthropomorphoses are inti mately associated with two major visual figures from his rep ertoire of recurrent motifs: the blind man led by a child about to cross a threshold, the symbolic reflection of all painting that exists somewhere between visibility and invisi bility, between figure and figurability, and the owl, the figure of nickname (the linguistic form of the mask), the bird of dissimulation and dicernere that JSles-Civetta made his emblem atic signature. If Karel van Mander, in his biography of the painter, insisted repeatedly on the anecdote regarding the hidden presence of owls in all of Bles's paintings,114 it is because the paradigmatic value they possessed in his exeget ical landscapes was clear to him?the value of an exhortation, of a wink pointing in the direction of a spiritual interpreta tion: "Let those who have eyes see!"

Translated from the French by Kirsten Murphy, Winton Wood, and Elena Iribarren Notes I am grateful to Hubert Damisch, Victor Sto?chita, Giovanni Careri, Xavier Vert, Luis P?rez-Oramas, Mich?le Cl?ment, Thomas Sipp, V?ronique Goudi noux, and Luc Serck for their insightful suggestions and comments on this text as part of my thesis or as article. In addition, I wish to thank the anonymous readers for The Art Bulletin and Lory Frankel for their constructive remarks. 1. This article is a revised excerpt from my PhD dissertation, Michel Weemans, "Les paysages ex?g?tiques et anthropomorphes de Henri Bles," under the direction of Hubert Damisch (?cole des Hautes ?tudes en Sciences Sociales, 2004). My work relies on recent studies that have stressed two characteristics of Bles's landscapes: a composi tion typically structured by a diagonal and a pictorial practice based both on variation (about eight versions of the Good Samaritan and fifteen to eighteen versions of the Preaching of Saint John the Baptist or of the Way to Calvary) and repetition (of a set of recurrent natural motifs used in his various paintings). On these points, see in particu lar Luc Serck, "Henri Bles et la peinture de paysage dans les Pays-Bas m?ridionaux avant Bruegel" (PhD diss., Universit? de Louvain, 1990); Walter Gibson, Mirror of the Earth: The World Landscape Tradition in Six teenth-Century Flemish Painting (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1989); and also Norman E. M?ller, Betsy J. Rosasco, and James H. Marrow, eds., Herri met de Bles: Studies and Explorations of the World Landscape Tradition (Princeton: Art Museum; Turnhout: Brepols, 1998); and Jacques Toussaint, ed., Actes du colloque autour de Henri Bles (Namur, 2002). Rather than viewing these characteristics simply in terms of their technical and economic aspects, however, I consider them in terms of an exegetical scheme, in connection with a third fundamental characteristic: the Christian theme of the Vision of God. My approach relies on studies that have stressed the visionary aspect of art in the Netherlandish culture in the times of the Devotio Moderna (a movement for the renewal of the spiritual life): Sixten Ringbom, "Vision and Conversation in Early Netherlandish Painting: The Delft Master's Holy Family," Simiolus 19 (1989): 181-90; Craig Harbison, "Vision and Meditation in Early Flemish Painting," Art Bulletin 66 (1984): 588-602; Larry Silver, "God in the Details: Bosch and Judg ment," Art Bulletin 83 (2001): 626-50; Bret Rothstein, Sight and Spiritu ality in Early Netherlandish Painting (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005); K.

Among the studies that have stressed the links between landscape painting, exegesis, and Desi derius Erasmus's thought, see especially the following by Reindert L. Falkenburg: "Pieter Bruegel's Series of the Seasons: On the Percep tion of Divine Order," in Liber Amicorum Raphael De Smedt, vol. 2, Ar tium Historia, ed. J. van der Auwera (Louvain: Peeters, 2001), 253-76; "?rasme de Rotterdam et la peinture de paysage aux Pays-Bas," in De la puissance de l'image: Les artistes du Nord face ? la R?forme; Cycle de con ferences, ed.

Undoubtedly, this explains the lack of attention it has received in studies on Bles, its association with a popular Flemish farce, and its persistent attribution to the painter's entourage. 3.

Esmeijer, Divina Quaterni tas: A Preliminary Study in the Method and Application of Visual Exegesis (Amsterdam: Van Gorcum, 1978); Georges Didi-Huberman, Fra An g?lico: Dissemblance et figuration (Paris: Flammarion, 1990); Paolo Ber dini, The Religious Art ofjacopo Bassano: Painting as Visual Exegesis (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997); and Herbert Kessler, Spiritual Seeing: Picturing God's Invisibility in Medieval Art (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2000). 4.

My approach, in stressing the dimension of paradox and the link be tween the image and the spectator, is indebted to Reindert L. Falken burg's idea of "antithetical iconography," as well as to studies that have considered the pictorial effects of tension and polarity in the emerging landscape, still life, and genre painting as reflecting the in tense questioning provoked by the encounter of sacred and profane; see Falkenburg, Joachim Patinir: Landscape as an Image of the Pilgrimage of Life (Amsterdam: John Benjamins, 1988); "Antithetical Iconography in Early Netherlandish Painting," in Bruegel and Netherlandish Landscape Painting from the National Gallery, Prague, exh. cat., National Museum of Western Art, Tokyo, 1990, 25-36; and "Marginal Motifs in Early Flem ish Landscape Painting," in Muller et al., Herri met de Bles: Studies and Explorations, 153-69.

Horst Waldemar Janson, Apes and Ape Lore in the Middle Ages and Re naissance (London: Warburg Institute, University of London, 1952). 15. Janson, ibid., considers a series of representations, mainly engravings, in which a peddler is robbed by apes. To the two paintings represent ing the scene?Bles's picture and an early-seventeenth-century Flem ish painting entitled The Dream?we must add the tabletop painted by Hans Holbein and a distant copy of Bles's picture (Sotheby's, New York, August 10, 1993, lot 21). Janson also mentions other examples, "which include the following: a mural, now destroyed, in Valenci ennes Castle, dated 1375, where our subject was combined with the Fountain of Youth; a Flemish enameled silver cup of the early fif teenth century, formerly in the collections of Pierpont Morgan and Alfred R?tschi; another cup (or possibly the same one) which was in the collection of Piero de' Medici in 1464" (217). The theme also served as "the subject for a ballet on at least two occasions, in 1468 at the Court of Charles the Bold, and again at the beginning of the sev enteenth century" (220). 16. Janson, ibid., 186: "Some of the simians are engaged in other pursuits traditionally associated with their kind. . . . Herri met de Bles, we may be sure, no longer attached any symbolic meaning to these activities; he must have regarded them simply as parts of the standard repertory of simian antics, since his picture also shows a group of apes dancing, an ape petting a small dog, and other familiar motifs. What surprises us is that he shows himself so dependent on pictorial precedents in all of these situations. This in itself constitutes an eloquent tribute to the visual felicity of the images created by Gothic marginal art during the preceding centuries." 17.

Among those transformations are the disappearance of motifs with sexual and scatological connotations, which in Janson's eyes justifies the parallel with Hans Sachs's moralizing poem. 22. For example, northern representations starting with Albrecht D?rer's Dance of the Apes (1523) and ending with Lucian's version of the leg end revisited in Jacob Cats's Emblemata (1618), pi. 84. On this motif as emblem of nature's dominance, index of social distinction, or moral commentary, see Janson, Apes and Ape Lore, and Sullivan, "Bruegel the Elder's Two Monkeys," 125. 23. On variations of this theme from Israhel van Meckenem to Bruegel, see Sullivan, "Bruegel the Elder's Two Monkeys." 24. This is one of the themes developed by Erasmus, with his sense of copia (abundance), in Depraeparatione ad mortem (1534), trans. John N. Grant, Preparing for Death, vol. 70 of Collected Works of Erasmus (Toron to: University of Toronto Press, 1998). 25. For the importance of this motif in ape iconography, see Janson, Apes and Ape Lore, 163-86. 26. Numerous examples of this pair are found in Dutch representations, such as Dialogum creatura, published in 1480, or Jan Gossaert's Fall of Man, as well as certain versions of Tondalis's Vision. 27. For more on this figure and its relation to the Ars simian naturae theme, see Janson, Apes and Ape Lore, chap. 10, 287-314. 28. See Eric de Bruyn, "Het motief 'marskramer door apen beroofd,'" in De vergeten beeldentaal van Jheronimus Bosch: De symboliek van de Hooiwa gen-triptiek en de Rotterdamse Marskramer-tondo verklaard vanuit Middelne derlandse teksten ('s-Hertogenbosch: AH-ABC, 2001), 221-27. 29. Ibid. The study of this series is the conclusion of the chapter dedi cated to the negative figure of the peddler. 30. On these negative motifs, see ibid., 226-27. 31. Ibid., 226. 32. The profane figure of the peddler could have a religious dimension, as testified by its presence in wooden sculptures or stained glass in some churches. A stained-glass window by Peter Zeiner in Bern of about 1500 could be compared with Hans Sachs's poem (quoted by Janson); the peddler in the window seems to have the look of an abused man, and the apes are interpreted in a negative manner. The blind man and his guide, a motif commonly used to represent fallen humanity in Netherlandish literature and painting of the sixteenth century, in the moralizing theater of the rederijkers was often described as a master abused by his young assistant. E. de Bruyn, "Het motief 'marskramer,'" 226, concludes that it therefore offers an iconographie parallel with the main subject in Bles's painting. 33.

The indecent gestures of the apes found in most engravings allude to recurrent ties between sleep and sexuality.

See also Daniel Arasse and Andres Serrano, Le sommeil de la surface (Arles: Actes-Sud, 1994). 41. An additional point in common between Bles's picture and Italian versions is the motif of the spring. For more on this subject, see Meiss, "Sleep in Venice." 42. Meiss, ibid., notes the first example in Dante; in an allegory of spiri tual awakening, Beatrice sleeps in the Lord's arms and is awakened by his gaze. 43. On the sleeping Noah as precursor to the Mocking of Christ before the Crucifixion, see Daniel Arasse, "Giovanni Bellini, Bacchus et la mythologie de No?," in Le sujet dans le tableau (Paris: Flammarion, 1997), 59-68. 44. Meiss, "Sleep in Venice," 228, points out a similar inscription in the version of Cosme Tura's Christ Child Asleep, where the awakening of the child relates to the process of redemption. 45. Bles's picture should be situated at the junction of this Christian schema and the satiric ramifications that correspond to the anti thetical opposition of the purity of the sleeping figure (generally a nymph) and the bestiality of the gaze (of a satyr) that surprises and observes the figure. One example is The Dream of Raphael, where Marcantonio Raimondi shows two sleeping nymphs watched by gro tesque and clearly phallic monsters. See Ruvoldt, Italian Renaissance Imagery; and Stephens, Demon Lovers. 46. Reproduced in Janson, Apes and Ape Lore, 233, fig. B. The artist, date, and setting of The Dream are unknown. 47. An enormous pince-nez, the attribute of the fool, hangs from his belt; this motif is repeated in the picture as it is in Bruegel's version of the sleeping peddler. 48. On the sleeping figure, see Sixten Ringbom, "Some Pictorial Conven tions for the Recounting of Thoughts and Experience in Late Medi eval Art," in Medieval Iconography and Narrative, a Symposium (Odense: Odense University Press, 1980). 49. What is at stake through these connections is the relation of sleep and death to forms of vacatio: "If dreams are a form of communica tion with the divine, an opportunity to achieve insight through con tact with the heavenly realm, death is the ultimate form of such union, a state in which the soul communes forever with the divine intelligence"; Maria Ruvoldt, Italian Renaissance Imagery, 30. 50.

(The Hague: Nijhoff, 1932); and C. Blum, La repr?sentation de la mort dans la litt?rature de la Renais sance, 2 vols. (Paris: Champion, 1989). 52. Thus, it is not only the erotic connotation, as Janson suggests, but also the hope of rebirth that justifies the association of the peddler robbed by the apes with a Fountain of Youth in several representa tions, including a fresco that has since disappeared (ca. 1375, Valenci ennes) and two tabletops (ca. 1530-50, Berlin and Wiesbaden). Jan son, Apes and Ape Lore, 220-21 n. 105. 53. See, for instance, the tombs of Carondelet in Bruges by Michel Scher rier, the tombs of the Sforza by Jacopo Sansovino in Rome, the tomb of Valentine Balbiani by Germain Pilon in Paris, and, in particular, the melancholic figures, leaning on one elbow, of Adolf von Schauen burg and Anton von Schauenburg, associated with representations of Christ's Resurrection by Cornelis Floris, Cologne Cathedral, 1561, in Cohen, Metamorphosis of a Death Symbol; and A. Huysmans et al., eds., Cornelis Floris, 1514-1575, beeldhouwer, architect, ontwerper, exh. cat., Ge meentekrediet, Brussels, 1996, 97-99, nos. 228-31. 54. Phrases illustrating this conception are common in emblems, adages, or mottos engraved on rings: "Die to live" or "Vado mor?" (I go to ward death), associated with "Vive Deo" (Live in God). On the em blem "Die to the world to live in God," of John Colet, humanist re former and Erasmus's close friend, see Leland Miles, John Colet and the Platonic Tradition (London: Open Court, 1961), 137; and F. Grossman, "Holbein, Torringiano and Some Portraits of John Dean Colet," Jour nal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 13 (1950): 202-36. 55. On the paradoxical loss of the earthly body as gain of spiritual life associated with the paradoxical idea of the vision of God, see Cohen, Metamorphosis of a Death Symbol, 129-31. 56. Erasmus, De praeparatione ad mortem (1534), 395-97. 57. The idea of preparation for death in Erasmus's work refers directly to the Christian topos of the soul as prisoner of the body, an earthly prison from which it aspires to free itself and ascend: a theme con stantly reworked by Erasmus in the Enchiridion, the Moria, the Sileni Alcibiadis, De praeparatione ad mortem, and the Paraclesis. 58.

See Georges Didi-Huberman, Saint-Georges et le dragon, versions dune l?gende (Paris: Adam Biro, 1994), 20-24. 60. The ideas of considering Bles's landscapes as a corpus, their making sense only when viewed as a set, and of the signification of Bles's Peddler relying not on a single "iconographie subject" but on a common model of visual exegesis have much in common with Gio vanni Careri's notions of a "dialogic network" and intertextuality; see Careri, Gestes d'amour et de guerre: La J?rusalem d?livr?e, images et af fects (XVIe-XVIIe si?cle) (Paris: ?ditions de l'EHESS, 2005). 61. On the question of the importance of antithetical iconography in Netherlandish landscape painting, see the decisive study of Falken burg, "Antithetical Iconography." 62. The opposition of a dead tree with a split trunk (here linked to the sleeping figure and scattered treasure) and a green tree, always delib erately associated with the protagonists of the paintings, is one of the recurrent motifs in Bles's landscapes. See particularly The Preaching of Saint John the Baptist, The Good Samaritan, and The Way to Calvary. On this motif, see M. R. Bennett, "The Legend of the Green Tree and the Dry," Archaeological Journal S3 (1926): 21-32; and Uta Neidhardt and Christian Sch?lzel, "Zwei Bilder von Herri met de Bles in der Dresdener Gem?ldegalerie Alte Meister," Dresdener Kunstbl?tter 39, no. 5 (1995): 144-50. 63. See Falkenburg, Joachim Patinir, "Antithetical Iconography"; and "Mar ginal Motifs." 64. Odilon Redon used this term to designate figures that produce an indeterminate effect of incongruity. Redon, A soi-m?me, Journal (1867 1915) (Paris: H. Floury, 1922), quoted in Dario Gamboni, Potential Images, Ambiguity and Indeterminacy in Modern Art (London: Reaktion Books, 2002), 9. 65. On these two notions, see Wilhelm Fraenger, Das Tausendj?hrige Reich (1947), translated into French as Le royaume mill?naire (Paris: Ivrea, 1993), 106. 66. This eye motif in the landscape suggests a third pole?the dark eye of the tree, which, high on the left above the sleeping peddler, shelters the emblematic owl. 67. Roland Barthes, "Arcimboldo ou rh?toriqueur et magicien," in L'obvie et l'obtus (Paris: Seuil, 1979), 128. 68. In the tradition of anthropomorphic landscapes, the eye corresponds to a target, aimed at by an archer, or to the benevolent gaze of Christ on the cross in front of whom the pilgrim kneels. 69. We also find this configuration?the Virgin with Child holding a gold finch, a chained ape at her feet, and a landscape with a mill in the background (a configuration of three Christological motifs symboliz ing the domination of sin)?in D?rer's well-known engraving The Vir gin with an Ape. 70. The Dutch invented the term Siendeblind, "seeing blind man" (from the evangelical expression "being blind with one's eyes open," Matt. 13:13), for which Bles's paintings offer endless visual equivalents. The expression, found in dictionaries and common in sixteenth-century moralizing literature, is symptomatic of an oculocentric Christian cul ture. It appears in one of the Twelve Proverbs engraved by Jan Wierix after Pieter Bruegel, showing a peddler. The objects hawked by the peddler designate him as deceiver, and the legend describes the Peo ple as "Siendeblindt": "Hier netten ende trompen ja ooek schoon fluijten. .. . Daer t' volck noch is hoorende doof en siende blindt." On this print, see Jan Grauls, Volkstaal en volksleven in het werk van Pieter Bruegel (Amsterdam: Standaard-Boekhandel, 1957), 200-205; and E. de Bruyn, De vergeten beeldentaal, 208. 71. In other landscapes by Bles, we find a similar placement of the an thropomorphic motif at the crossing of two axes.

Nadine Orenstein (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001), 168-70. 76. Certain representations show the old merchant, sometimes accompa nied by a sleeping woman, holding an owl on his shoulder and look ing at the disorder of dilapidated objects through his thick glasses. For more on this subject, see J. M?ller, "Interpretations of Everyman"; Louis Lebeer, Catalogue des estampes de Bruegel TAncien (Brussels: Biblio th?que Royale Albert 1er, 1969), 80; and Kavaler, Bruegel: Parables of Order. Although the Peddler represents a poor hawker and Elck a rich merchant, they are sometimes combined in Flemish proverbs; see E. de Bruyn, De vergeten beeldentaal, 206. 77. The image illustrates the chapter entitled "Le simulacre de Justice mondaine" in Damhouder's book Practique des causes criminelles (Ant werp, 1564). 78. Above the sleeping merchant, the allegorical figure of Justice sepa rates spiritual from material values. The Trinity in the sky, opposed to a Boca Inferna (mouth of hell), recalls a similar polar schema in many of Bles's landscapes, particularly in those containing dream figures and crypto-anthropomorphoses. 79.

See Ren? van Bastelaer, Les estampes de Pieter Bruegel VAncien (Brussels: G. van Oest, 1908); Grauls, Volkstaal en volksleven; Charles de Tolnay, The Drawings of Pieter Bruegel (London: Phaidon, 1952); and more re cently, Kavaler, Bruegel: Parables of Order, whose work is related to this interpretative tradition. 82. In one of the first studies on Elck, Grauls, Volkstaal en volksleven, sug gested the paradoxical structure given to this theme in Netherlandish culture. 83. According to J. M?ller, "Interpretations of Everyman," 83, Bruegel's engraving "tests the combinatory capacities of the beholder, while constituting a profoundly moral image destined to promote attentive vision." Concerning interpretations of images centered on vision and judgment, see Calmann, "The Picture of Nobody"; Bret Rothstein, "The Problem with Looking at Bruegel's Elck," Art History 26, no. 2 (2003): 143-73, who defines Bruegel's Elck as "one of the major ex amples of reflexive inclination for the act of seeing, which constitutes a central aspect of Northern Renaissance art" (170). 84. These follow Erasmus's "Nosce teipsum," proposing a moral assess ment of his age: during the Landjuwel (annual feast organized by the Chambers of Rhetoric) in Antwerp in 1561, two fools opened the cor tege, proclaiming successively, "Ick ben soo fray ick en kenne my sel ven niet" (I am so splendid that I don't know myself) and "Ick en kenne my selven niet" (I don't know myself). Bles's peddler?a man whose life is driven by material profit but who, as a figure of vacatio, suggests the spiritual and moral sense of "loss as gain"?is comparable to Bruegel's double Elck-Niemand. Embodying simultaneously the example to be avoided and the detachment of the commentator on morality, these figures belong to the category of the glossing fool. The combined effects of paradox, polarity, parody, and direct address con stitute the more general strategy of humanist irony, which primarily employs the figures of the fool, the ape, and Everyman. The fool called Chascun, Elckerlijk, or Everyman serves as a pretext for Chris tian humanists to unite several themes in the same meditation: death, the folly of attachment to the material, the impossibility of self-knowl edge, worldly blindness, and the necessary superiority of spiritual vi sion. See Robert Klein, "Le th?me du fou et l'ironie humaniste," in La forme et l'intelligible (Paris: Gallimard, 1970), 433-50. 85. The theme was popularized by Sebastian Brant, whose Ship of Fools concludes with the image of a fool who bells a cat, associated with the fool looking through his fingers. See Sebastian Brant, Ship of Fools (Basel, 1494), chap. 110. The proverb is also found in the compila tion of Reyer Gheurtz and Symon Andriessoon, Duytsche Adagia ofie Spreecwoorden (Antwerp, 1550), 78.2, facsimile ed. with transcription of the Dutch text and an English translation edited by Mark A. Meadow and Anneke C. G. Fleurens (Hilversum: Verloren, 2003). 86. On the formal organization of the proverbs in Bruegel's picture, see Mark A. Meadow, Pieter Bruegel the Elder's Netherlandish Proverbs and the Practice of Rhetoric (Zwolle: Waanders, 2002). On Gheurtz, see M. Jut ten-de-Brouwer, "Een onderzoek naar de (eventuele) bron(nen) van de verzameling spreekwoorden 'adagia ofte spreeckwoorde' in het handschrift Gheurtz" (PhD diss., University of Amsterdam, 1991). 87. The ape's mirror is also the one in which the sinful man has to see himself as simia dei, a false imitator, a dissembling deformation of the resembling reflection. On the ambivalent figure of the mirror in the Renaissance, see Agnes Minazzoli, La premi?re ombre: Reflexion sur le mi roir et la pens?e (Paris: Minuit, 1990).

See also Sto? chita, L'instauration du tableau, chap. 1. 91.

From the first studies on Bles, published in 1863 and 1864 by Alfred Bequet, to recent colloquiums on Bles (Princeton, 1996; Namur, 2000), this phenomenon has remained unnoticed, or has been al luded to only by two authors in the form of denial. Bequet drew at tention to the irregular shapes of Bles's rocks, calling them "oddities," which he attributed, in a naively naturalistic appreciation, to the</page><page sequence="23">HERRI MET DE BLES'S SLEEPING PEDDLER 4gJ "weakness of his landscapes." Bequet, "Henri Bles, peintre bouvi gnois," Annales de la Soci?t? Arch?ologique de NamurS (1863-64): 54-88. More recently, in his catalog of Bles's paintings, Serck, Henri Bles et la peinture du paysage, 797, pointed out the obvious example of the rocky eagle that appears at the center of the Calling of Saint Peter, but only in order to qualify it as an "abnormal" phenomenon in Bles's oeuvre and to deny the existence of other similar examples: "apart from this example, no other mountain anthropomorphosis can be attributed to him." 99. The recognition of a fortuitous likeness in the irregular forms of na ture spurred the desire to accentuate it to obtain a real image. On this passage of Alberti's De statua, see Oskar B?tschmann, "Leon Bat tista Alberti: De Statua," in Theorie der Praxis: Leon Battista Alberti als Humanist und Theoretiker der bildenden K?nsten, ed. K. W. Foster and H. Locher (Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 1999), 109-28. 100. On the anthropomorphoses in D?rer's Val d'Arco, see Hermann Leber, Albrecht D?rers Landschaftaquarelle: Topographie und Genese (Hildesheim: G. Olms, 1988). Leber's study shows, with precision, that the head on the right was inspired by an anthropomorphic rock that really exists and analyzes how D?rer, through a complex manipula tion, emphasized the likeness and gave it the face of a sullen old man.

On the place of Bles's anthropomorphoses within that tradition, see Weemans, "Les paysages ex?g?tiques," chap. 3. As the recipient of a J. Paul Getty Postdoctoral Fellowship in the History of Art and the Humanities, I will be studying and preparing an exhibition on the links between anthropomorphism and landscape and the develop ment of various forms of anthropomorphoses from the end of the fifteenth century to the middle of the seventeenth century. 102.

Bles's Right into Egypt (Museo d'Arte Catalano, Barcelona), with a crypto-anthropomorphosis implying a reversal of the gaze, offers an other example that confirms our interpretation of the dual nature of the peddler and of his sleep as vacatio. In this painting, the sleeping figure in the foreground (whose pose recalls the peddler) is a repre sentation not of Joseph's Dream but of a sleeping pilgrim that places the landscape under the modality of the dream, of the theme of the pilgimage of life, and of the choice between civitas terrena and civitas Dei, illusion and discernment. For a detailed analysis of this landscape and of the three examples described here schematically, see Wee mans, "Les paysages ex?g?tiques," chap. 3. 105. Silver, "God in the Details." 106.

For a definition of the crypto-image as "figurative sign oscillating be tween the two extreme desires of visibility and nonvisibility, between manifestation and disappearance," see Jean-Didier Urbain, "La crypto image." 110. In Bles's work, the most significant indicatory figure is his famous sig nature figure: the owl, whose qualities of dissimulation and observa tion alone make it indicatory. It is generally associated with a second indicatory figure, but it is also always included in a larger network in volving the metaphor of the Book of Nature and the pictorial inter pretation of a biblical or profane theme, as it is here. 111.
