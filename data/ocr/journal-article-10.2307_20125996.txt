<plain_text><page sequence="1">NIHILISM, REASON, AND 'THE GOOD" BERND MAGNUS U NTiL recently the terms "nihilism" and "nihilist" had served as philosophic shibboleths. When uttered, the words were almost always invoked to summon the community?philosophic or non philosophic?to self-righteous indignation. Nihilism was said to motivate critiques of religious and moral notions; forms of skepticism, including Hume's, were not surprisingly branded "nihilism." When employed in this way, the terms were intend ed both to stigmatize and quarantine. "Nihilism" and "atheism" share a common history in this respect, as terms of derision, as objects of abuse. To judge something or someone "nihilist" was to judge it evil, whether it embraced no specific theory or, simply, a doctrine perceived as fundamentally menacing to established dogmas. In recent times "nihilism" has become less an invective and, at least in some of the philosophic literature, more or less context specific. Nietzsche, for example, thought that nihilism was a consequence of the historical devaluation of the highest values, not an individual's failure to accept or assent. Heidegger identifies nihilism with the forgetting of the Being (Sein) of beings (Seiendes), inaugurated by Plato. In the peculiar sense Hei degger gives it, "nihilism" is the inner logic of Western meta physics. Whether nihilism is a "good" or "bad" thing is a pointless question for Heidegger and, it should be added, for Nietzsche too. In his book,1 Stanley Rosen confronts what he takes to be nihilism in its current philosophic expressions, with a view to exhibiting its origin, scope, and remedy. Unlike Nietzsche and Heidegger, Rosen does not simply accept nihilism as an accom plished fact to be overcome. His polemical tone and philosophic strategy, rather, are designed to show the connection between "wisdom" and "the good," with a view to "mitigating the other 1 Nihilism: A Philosophical Essay (New Haven and London, Yale Uni versity Press, 1969). Page references in the text are to this work.</page><page sequence="2">NIHILISM, REASON, AND 'THE GOOD" 293 wise fatal results of this perennial pestilence" (viz., nihilism) (p. xx). Rosen's book is to be understood as "a defense of rea son," which means, for him, that "it must necessarily be an attack upon . . . the enemies of reason" (p. xiv). I shall try to resist the self-indulgent temptation to counter polemic, in what follows, because I consider Stanley Rosen's book to be as important as it is bound to be controversial. The book's importance lies, in part, in its conception of contemporary philos ophy as nihilism and an historical intensification of nihilism; and in its particular critiques of "ordinary" language philosophy and Heideggerian fundamental ontologies, as examples of nihilism. More controversial than satisfactory, in my opinion, are the specific philosophical recommendations Rosen offers, the antedote he prescribes. I Stanley Rosen shares with Heidegger and Nietzsche the opinion that nihilism is, at bottom, a metaphysical view, or better, event, upon which its political and moral instances depend. More specifically, nihilism "today is due to a series of specific philosophical decisions in the past" which have detached reason "from its traditional affiliation with the conception of 'good' (p. 14). The divorce of reason and "good" has, in this view, resulted in the loss of reasonableness, an incapacity to assert the goodness of reason, arbitrariness in philosophy, the demise of "rational speech" and wisdom. The "enemies" of reason, and its misguided friends as well, are all nihilists in the sense that they are foes of Platonic realism. It is not the case, in short, that we are given an inadequate definition of nihilism. Precisely the reverse is the case. Since Wittgenstein and Heidegger, Marx and Nietzsche, ordinary language analysis, positivism, and exis tentialism, are one and all forms of nihilism, in Rosen's judgment, we are offered an abundance of characterizations. Consider the following illustrations : . . . Speech that is indistinguishable from silence is nihilism (p. xix). . . . nihilism may be defined as the view that it makes no difference what we say, because every definition of "difference" is itself merely something we say (p. 19). The evidence for "sense" is "nonsense" and for "nonsense" is "sense. This is what I mean by nihilism (p. 22).</page><page sequence="3">294 BERND MAGNUS And if an utterance can never be falsified, there is no difference, with respect to it, between true and false, or sense and nonsense. Is this not nihilism? (p. 33). Nihilism as a political and moral problem of our epoch has its roots in the epistemological and ontological teaching of the day (p. 136). Nihilism is fundamentally an attempt to overcome or to repudiate the past on behalf of an unknown and unknowable yet hoped-for future (p. HO). This is the classical origin of nihilism, or the view that things as a whole are worthless (p. 149). Taken as autonomous psychic motions, one desire contradicts another, and the result is chaos, or nihilism (p. 170). Nihilism again presents itself as the disjunction between speech and desire. Nihilism is an expression of the impossibility of human perfection (p. 212). The discontinuity of reality, and so the irrational fluctuation of remembering and forgetting; the acquiescence in and glorification of absurdity; a fastidious attention to the bodily Eros in all its imaginable forms, first, as a consolation for the disappearance of the psychic Eros, then as a kind of applied mechanics of the technicist anti-mind; more generally, an obsession with technique, whether as applied to bodies or in the empty formal systems of logic and mathematics; the con comitant praise of intoxication and sobriety as themselves discon tinuous or indistinguishable manifestations of chaos: these are the easily identifiable characteristics of the contemporary nihilist scene (p. 233). As is plain from this tedious but partial list, epistemological skepticism or conventionalism, as well as value relativism are forms of nihilism. The collapsing of distinctions between value "relativism" and epistemic "relativism" as species of nihilism is not, of course, accidental. If, as Rosen claims, the severing of reason and "good" is one of the bases of nihilism, then the normative-descriptive disjunction is itself nihilistic. Having said all this, one might suppose that several philosophers may serve as paradigms of "true" philosophy. But this is not the case. Descartes, Kant and Hegel, too, are judged either nihilistic in their teachings or in their consequences. Nihilism, then, accord ing to Stanley Rosen, involves not only the divorce of reason and the good. The deeper malady is a disfigured sense of reason; involving the transformation of nature and eternity into human constructions; into history and temporality. The leitmotif of modern philosophy as nihilism is, for Rosen, precisely the view that man creates meaning.</page><page sequence="4">NIHILISM, REASON, AND "THE GOOD" 295 The many formulations reduce, in the end, to one: if the world's intelligibility is a human product, "there is no basis external to human agreement, by which to distinguish sense and nonsense . . . there is no way in which to certify the meaningful ness or value, in a rational sense, of man's construction of reason. It is a contingent, arbitrary fact, engulfed in the silence of nothing ness" (p. 11). Accordingly, Rosen treats the dominant modern and contemporary philosophic tendencies as historicist ontologies. Their "speeches" about the world are formless silence, hence "nihilism," because they cannot offer an account of the intel ligibility of "the whole" by appeal to criteria which are not them selves human creations. To the extent that I am able to under stand his many formulations, Rosen's central allegation is this: If reason is a human construction, then there is no "rational" way for it to certify itself. The term "rational" here is used in the same question-begging sense as Rosen employs it. As far as I can make out, it serves as a synonym for "objective." It appears, then, that Rosen's collage of nihilisms is framed by two matrices. On the one hand, nihilism is a consequence of the divorce between reason and good. On the other hand, nihilism is the abandon ment of Platonic realism (reason denatured). As far as I can see, both matrices are required by Rosen, although they are never distinguished. Both are needed because, quite plainly, there have been "modern" philosophers who have fully shared Rosen's lament concerning the fact-value cleavage, the chasm between reason and value. Dewey comes immediately to mind. Yet the indictment of modern philosophy is made coherent because, wherever the first matrix will not serve, the second matrix does. That is, modern philosophers who attempt to integrate reason and value are nihilists, nonetheless, because of an alleged historicist per spective. In the last analysis, those who are not hung on the first horn of Rosen's matrix are gored on the second. Which is to say they are not Platonists. I think that helps to explain many of Mr. Rosen's puzzling, if not exasperating, remarks about Kant, Nietzsche, and Marx. Moreover, I think it accounts, in part, for Rosen's challenging reduction of the later Heidegger's work to historicism. Rosen's polemics against the "human construction of reason," ironically, echo Heidegger?the book's principal adversary.</page><page sequence="5">296 BERND MAGNUS I shall suggest, in the penultimate section of this essay, that if nihilism involves the human construction of reason, and the ensuing divorce of fact from value, then a "realist" reason is subject to analogous strictures. I shall claim that Stanley Rosen's work, when its criteria are self-reflexively applied, is also an instance of nihilism; one in which human "interpretation" is equivalent to human "construction" of reason. Apart from the merit of the claim, however, I shall offer the criticism principally because I do not think that "nihilism" can be so indiscriminately invoked as it is by Stanley Rosen, without losing (some of) its sense. For now, however, I want to turn to his analysis of the contemporary philosophic scene. II Stanley Rosen's first chapter, "Wittgenstein and Ordinary Language," attempts to draw out the nihilist meaning and con sequences of Wittgenstein's teachings, early and late. Here "nihilism" means the denial of philosophical propositions or, as the author prefers to characterize it throughout his book, the reduction of speech to silence. It is no doubt puzzling to talk about "doing philosophy" when ordinary language functions as normative standard. If philosophical puzzles are grammatical ones, in the last analysis, then therapy consists of the disposal of the grammatical conundrum. All this is terribly unoriginal, to be sure. Witt genstein was better aware than his critics that the appeal to ordinary usage to litigate philosophic disputes entailed a denial of the view that there are philosophical questions proper in the traditional sense. Stated differently, if our philosophical dilemmas are a consequence of a misuse of language, then abuse of language is the problem. Philosophy, in the ordinary language sense, ought to heal itself. Its therapy is its self-dissolution. Rosen makes the interesting point that Wittgenstein's conception of ordinary language is already purified. That is, ordinary language should surely be said to include the several puzzles which give rise to competing philosophies. But, in that case, one cannot without difficulty turn to "ordinary usage" to dispose of the puzzle. If philosophical puzzles are only grammatical ones,</page><page sequence="6">NIHILISM, REASON, AND "THE GOOD" 297 then they can be solved, or dissolved, by reference to "correct" usage. If, on the other hand, the puzzles are reflected in lan guage usage, it is impossible to appeal to the source of the problem to determine its proper solution, within the ordinary language frame of reference. For it is quite a different thing to claim that ordinary usage generates philosophical problems than to claim that ordinary usage disposes of them. To claim that ordinary usage disposes of philosophical issues is, at a minimum, to urge not ordinary usage but extraordinary usage, since philosophical prob lems arise quite ordinarily. A sympathetic reading of Wittgenstein, in consequence, requires the separation of some of his statements from his general intention. Quite plainly, it is self-contradictory to propose a philosophical theory to demonstrate the impossibility of philo sophical theories. If, as has been repeatedly stated by Witt genstein's critics, all philosophical theories must be instances of the illegitimate employment of language, then the Philosophical Investigations violates its own canons. It is, after all, a philo sophical "theory." In consequence, if one wishes to be fair to Wittgenstein's general purpose, some minimal distinction must be introduced. If not, as Rosen rightly claims, Wittgenstein's asser tions are a yearning for silence. Perhaps, as Stenius, Quinton, and others have suggested, Wittgenstein's purpose is not so far removed from Kant's. Like Kant, we should then have to say, Wittgenstein's purpose was to circumscribe the bounds of sense. And we should then also have to say that Wittgenstein's positive view was that philosophical theories ought to describe facts about language in such a way that many philosophical paradoxes and confusions are dispelled. But we could not then claim that all philosophical paradoxes and confusions are susceptible of this treatment, without being paradoxical and confused ourselves. In sum, to treat Wittgenstein sympathetically requires separating what is commonly understood as the positive and negative aspect of his position. And I believe there is something to recommend this interpretation. Rosen, however, thinks otherwise, and not without merit. It is his view that Wittgenstein and his followers were initially dissatisfied with the paradigm of reason they had implicitly embraced, "a conception of reason as equivalent to logical calcula</page><page sequence="7">298 BERND MAGNUS tion plus the scientific verification of facts" (p. 6). This logico empiricist sense of reason is, according to Rosen, among other things incapable of asserting the value of being reasonable in other than an instrumental sense. The shift from "ideal" to natural languages in Wittgenstein represents a shift from logical form to public speech, from immediate intuition to language usage; a shift from noetic to dianoetic discourse. But, Rosen suggests, the teaching of the later Wittgenstein can be no more easily salvaged than his earlier teaching, because the impossibility of speaking about logical form is now replaced by the impossibility of speaking about a "natural order of the world" (p. 9). Custom, in the last analysis, decides the meaning of meaning. An already understood historical language disposes of philosophic issues. Rosen asserts, however, that there is something puzzling about not being able to give an account, for instance, of the form com mon to all games, while at the same time assuming an ability to (correctly) identify any particular game. From considerations of this sort we are led to the following startling conclusion. "Witt genstein's denial that there is such a common form is contradicted in practice by the visibility of games as games. The common form is present, very much like a Platonic Idea" (p. 10). And we are further told that since the "common form" cannot be rendered discursive, " 'Doing' is equivalent in the Investigations to noetic intuition" (p. 10). It is hard to know what to make of such claims, presented, as many are throughout the book, without much careful argu ment. I, for one, should have thought that the "visibility of games as games"?for the later Wittgenstein?is a function of what gets called a "game" in a given natural language. I should further have thought that a person's ability to recognize activities called a "game" does not at all depend upon something like "a Platonic Idea," but, rather, upon the person's learning the natural language. Misidentification of games, on this view, is not a failure to grasp the visible form (Platonic Idea), but either an imperfect acquaintance with ordinary usage or a recommenda tion to apply the term to an activity hitherto not designated as "a game." I shall now break-off further discussion of Rosen's analysis of Wittgenstein abruptly, for two principal reasons, First, despite</page><page sequence="8">NIHILISM, REASON, AND "THE GOOD" 299 the fact that I am not an advocate of "ordinary language" philos ophy, I am in serious danger of becoming a carping critic, which is not my intention. Second, whether his indictment of "ordinary language" philosophy is persuasive or not can be quite readily determined by all of us who are members of the English-speaking philosophic community. I should, however, make one final remark here. Rosen's discussion of Wittgenstein illustrates, it seems to me, his pervasive failure to separate issues, a failure which infects the substance of the book as a whole. If nihilism is the divorce of reason and "good," then Wittgenstein is innocent of that charge, by virtue of Rosen's own analysis. "Reason" and "value" are, on his reading of the later Wittgenstein, "con tingently" or "instrumentally" good. But to claim that X is instrumentally good is surely not to claim that it is not good. Yet, throughout the book, Mr. Rosen rhetorically glosses over elementary distinctions such as this one. One is left with the impression that a conception of "reason" and "good" which can not lift itself by its own ontological boot-straps is nihilistic un reason. For a procrustean either/or informs Rosen's book: either Platonic "reason" and "good," or nihilism. This also bears upon my earlier suggestion that two matrices, rather than one, frame Rosen's discussion of nihilism. That is, nihilism is the divorce of reason and good, or the construction of reason and good. But the careful reader will note that the second matrix begs a critical question, namely, what is to count as a case of "construction." Now, happily, we can get a fairly clear sense of what would not count as construction. Consider, for instance, "If reasons have no external' objective' reference but are altogether self-certifying, then they are arbitrary utterances, lack ing in rational justification or human value" (p. 41). I think one can fairly say that reasons, reason, and good, for Rosen, need "objective" referents. But, to my knowledge, virtually all the "nihilists" in Rosen's account of philosophy's history might agree with the viewr that reason and good must correspond to some thing, i.e., have objective referents. The point of these remarks is, of course, that Rosen assumes what needs to be demonstrated. To make his case he would have to show, in connection with Wittgenstein for example, that reference to "ordinary usage" is not "external," "objective." In Kant's case he would need to</page><page sequence="9">300 BERND MAGNUS show that categories, the transcendental unity of apperception, and, in moral philosophy, the categorical imperative, have no "objective" reference. Mr. Rosen, behind the wall of a Platonic fortress, does not, of course, demonstrate any of these things. He simply assumes them. Now I am not saying that these things cannot be proven, although I doubt that they can. I am simply asserting that Rosen does not appear to be alive to the fact that they need to be demonstrated to lend plausibility to his thesis. It is my hope, and I do not mean to sound patronizing, that Stanley Rosen will one day attempt to show more clearly what non-Platonic construction consists of, because I consider his broad and penetrating command of the history of philosophy adequate to the occasion. For without a full and clear account of the sense in which "constructionism" is arbitrary, Nihilism will remain, I fear, essentially a controversial polemic rather than a carefully argued philosophic treatise. The most insightful aspect of Nihilism, it seems to me, con sists of those pages devoted to a discussion of Heidegger and the political implications of fundamental ontology as an enterprise. But here too, I regret to say, substantial additional evidence would have to be brought to bear on the analysis of Heidegger to be persuasive. It is common knowledge at this late date that Heidegger's principle question, What is the sense of the Being (Sein) of beings (Seiendes) ?, was motivated by a profound dissatisfaction with the manner in which "Being" had been understood in the history of Western metaphysics. As early as Being and Time we find Heidegger maintaining that Being had been understood, since Aristotle, to represent a self-evident, undefinable, most general concept. It is also well known that Heidegger sought to elicit a more primordial sense of Being. The motive, plainly, was not perversity. Rather, Heidegger was persuaded that the tradi tional categorial treatment of Being failed to articulate clearly what is meant for a thing "to be" in general. The context which traditionally informed an account of "Being," according to Heidegger, was inherently defective. He has argued that the criteria which sustained an analysis of Being, undefinability, universality, and self-evidence, are not simply inadequate but are themselves the result of an inadequate account</page><page sequence="10">NIHILISM, REASON, AND "THE GOOD" 301 of Being, viz., metaphysics itself. The criteria are allegedly derived from the success of discursive speech in application to beings, to entities. Categorial inquiry, since Plato, according to this view, enjoys considerable success in eliciting the sense of beings, the ontic, but misapplies its energies in treating Being (Sein) in the categorial mode, through discursive speech. I do not need to rehearse my misgivings about this theory here, since I have done that elsewhere.2 But I should add that Heidegger's account of the retrogression of Being from Plato to Nietzsche involves one of the most sustained and coherent analyses of the concept of truth to be found in the literature. As is common currency, Heidegger's analysis tries to show that philosophic discourse, since Plato, assumes an unanalyzed conception of truth as correctness, i.e., a correspondence between a statement and a state-of-affairs. Now, Heidegger maintains, this sense of truth is derivative. Before Plato truth, al?theia, meant disclosure; being-in-a-state of-uncovering. Truth, according to Heidegger, originally meant wresting from concealment. Lethe, lanthano, originally sug gested covering-up, hoarding, concealing, disguising, forgetting. The a-privative in al?theia, consequently, was said to uncover, unconceal; to bring into the light. I have characterized this Heideggerian sense of truth as "ontological" truth as distinct from the "epistemological" sense which sustains philosophic, i.e., dis cursive speech. Now Heidegger maintains that epistemological truth, adequatio rei et intellectus, while applicable to ontic speech, to talk about things, is incapable of grasping Being, the emergence within which things come to be. But that is not all. Ontic speech about Being has characterized the history of philosophy as metaphysics. Truth devolves, historically, from al?theia (pre Platonic), to orthotes (the "correct" speech about things), to adequatio intellectus et rei (medieval period), to certitude (Descartes), to error (Nietzsche). The revelatory essence of truth is allegedly subservient to correct speech, in Plato. "Correct ness" then evolves its own career; from medieval correspondence, to Cartesian self-evidence in which mathematical certainty serves as paradigm of truth, to Nietzsche's extraordinary claim that truth 2 Cf. Heidegger's Metahistory of Philosophy: Amor Fati, Being and Truth (The Hague, Martinus Nijhoff, 1970).</page><page sequence="11">302 BERND MAGNUS is the sort of error, the sort of falsification of fluid becoming, without which human beings could not live. I am stressing, however briefly, that Heidegger's conception of truth is abso lutely critical to an understanding of his thinking, because the fate of Being, as Heidegger sees it, is inextricably connected with the development of truth. As a consequence of the sharpening of epistemological truth, Being devolves from Anwesenheit, the pre-Platonic presence of emergence, to Idea (Plato), to tran scendence (God), to "will" (modern period). Heidegger main tains, I shall only briefly add, that Being appears as will in the entire post-Cartesian period, not only in Nietzsche. I cannot now dwell on the merits and weaknesses of the position I have sketched so hastily. That falls outside the scope of the present discussion and, as I have already indicated, is treated elsewhere. I cannot help remarking, however, that Rosen's discussion of Heidegger fails to bring the concept of truth sufficiently to the forefront. I take it that this is a consequence of the fact that Rosen remains firmly wedded to the correspondence view of truth. In fact, where Heidegger fails, in my opinion, to pay sufficient attention to the merits of the correspondence view, Rosen goes to the opposite extreme. His Platonic realism pre disposes him to the view that the proper task of philosophy, wisdom, is to claim to give a completely rational speech about "the whole." Now the confessed impossibility of fulfilling this claim is not a consequence of the failure of the structure of speech to "correspond" to the "whole." For Rosen, rational speech "corresponds" to the whole, paradoxically, in part. I shall have more to say about this puzzling view a bit further on. For now, I simply want to underscore the point that whereas Heidegger assumes the defectiveness of "correspondence," Rosen assumes its impeccability. The failure of ontic speech to illuminate Being has led Hei degger to poetic prophecy. Here I think Rosen's criticisms of Heidegger are entirely correct, and his trenchant illustrations of the obscurantist efforts to make Being become word will be offensive only to the most uncritical Heidegger disciple. However, there is nothing original in the observation and discussion of the fact that the discourse of the later Heidegger, and ontological speech generally, is no longer philosophic speech. More contro</page><page sequence="12">NIHILISM, REASON, AND "THE GOOD" 303 versial and less satisfactory, in my opinion, are other claims Rosen makes about Heidegger. For example, Rosen suggests that Being, the emergence-process, is conceived by Heidegger as dependent upon human thinking, "... the revelatory identification with the emergence-process is conceived as dependent upon human think ing." 3 Now that assertion is, it seems to me, simply mistaken. The controversial Kehre, the shift in Heidegger's thinking, has troubled commentators precisely because it has suggested the independence of Being and man's dependence upon it. This is neither a matter of surmise nor opinion. In Being and Time, Dasein was conceived as a being-in-the world, where its structure and the world's are reciprocally dis closed. As a result of this reciprocal relationship Heidegger had said, "Of course, only as long as Dasein is (that is only as long as an understanding of Being is ontically possible), 'is there' Being.4 Clearly, this reinforces Rosen's view of the dependency of Being upon man. And I think it can be fairly said that the dependency relationship is still evident in Heidegger's Kant-study. However, with the dramatic shift to meditations on Being, apart from Dasein, Heidegger scholars began to point to passages such as the one I have just cited to locate the shift in Heidegger's thinking. Heidegger was himself not content to acknowledge a reversal and asserted, instead, the primacy of Being all along: "In Being and Time (p. 212) it is said intentionally and cautiously: il y a VEtre: 'it gives' Being. The il y a translates the 'it gives' inexactly. The 'gives' names, however, the essence of Being; the giving itself and the imparting of its truth." 5 This extraordinary self-interpreta tion simply translates the German idiom es gibt literally; es (it) gibt (gives). We are, therefore, to understand Heidegger as having said, in Being and Time, "only as long as Dasein is . . . does Being give itself." The questionable character of Hei degger's self-interpretation is not at issue here. Rather, I want to st jss what Heidegger himself has repeatedly stressed, rightly or wrongly, correctly or incorrectly, namely the initiative of Being. I have myself tried to indicate the unhappy consequences 3 Nihilism: A Philosophical Essay, p. 41. 4 Sein und Zeit (T?bingen, 1953), p. 212. 5 Piatons Lehre von der Wahrheit: mit einem Brief ?ber den "Humanismus." (Franke, Bern, 1947), p. 80.</page><page sequence="13">304 BERND MAGNUS of Heidegger's reversal. I find it uncommonly odd, therefore, to read that the emergence-process (Being) is dependent upon man's thinking. Moreover, I do not think that Stanley Rosen need argue this way to make his central claim successfully, that Hei degger's position is a species of historicism. I think that his analysis is penetrating and correct in this regard. For it can be fairly said that if man's function is to let Being be, this suggests a submission to history. Heidegger's own personal biography is instructive in this respect, and I admire Stanley Rosen's pointed analysis of it. The pertinent chapter, "Historicity and Political Nihilism," will no doubt infuriate many Heideggerians. But I do think that Rosen's claims are unavoidable. If a philosopher reduces Being to the emergence-process itself, and if a new era can occasionally be glimpsed within the epochal and eschatological nature of the emergence-process, then moral judgments and standards vanish. I do not know whether much more than that can be claimed, regarding the alleged receptivity of fundamental ontology to Nazism. My own view is that although some philosophical posi tions are more easily reconciled with totalitarianism, others plainly are not. More important, perhaps, the political conse quences of a philosophical theory are enormously difficult to establish. In Kant's case, for instance, I do not see how one could read protofascism into his moral teachings?yet Eichmann did just that in Jerusalem! I would argue that, in any case, a man's moral failings can rarely be deduced from his philosophical con tribution. Plainly, Heidegger's initial enthusiasm for the Third Reich was not inconsistent with his growing conviction about the epochal nature of Being. Yet Tillich maintained to his death that the content of Being and Time is utterly irreconcilable with a surrender to History. I mention all this because I labor under the growing conviction that political nihilism can be justified under virtually any philosophical view (read : ideology), if clever and malevolent men work at it. In this connection, I would only remind Rosen that the spell of Plato, far from suggesting the liberating yardstick Rosen would insist it supplies, has been invoked by practicing fascists, and has recently been credited as the fountainhead of the enemies of the open society by an eminent philosopher. But, I repeat, the relation between philosophy and</page><page sequence="14">NIHILISM, REASON, AND "THE GOOD" 305 politics is complex, and causal claims regarding it are utterly vulnerable to attack. There is, however, a more general issue concerning the relationship of philosophy to political nihilism at work in Rosen's book, namely, the opinion that cultural, political, and moral nihilism are consequences of philosophical nihilism. If I am skeptical about the general enterprise of interpreting which philosophies justify monstrous political practices, it cannot be said that I am skeptical about the broader argument, i.e., the argument that certain philosophies, in some sense, "cause" his torical nihilism. I am not skeptical about that issue. Rather, I think it is simply false. Perhaps not "simply." But it is an arrogant preconception, a sort of inverse image of economic deter minism mechanically understood, which informs not only Nihilism, but the work of Heidegger and to a lesser degree Nietzsche as well. Moreover, I think that issue is of sufficient importance to treat it more than en passant, and I shall conclude this study, in the last section, with a somewhat more thorough discussion of it. Ill The intention of Nihilism, as is plain by now, is to rescue philosophy from nihilism, understood as the reduction of the dominant trends in modern philosophy to historicism. To ac complish this task, according to Stanley Rosen, we must turn back to Plato, for "Plato wishes us to take our bearings in time by a vision that remains free of the transcience of temporality" (p. 141). I shall not dwell too long on Rosen's discussion of "The Good," because it seems to me to confuse three separate issues. First, there is the issue of what Plato meant by "good," and the theory of forms generally. Here I think Stanley Rosen's treatment is masterful. Second, there is the issue of repudiating Hei degger's interpretation of Plato. This, too, is done adequately and convincingly. Third, there is the issue, apart from the first two, of assessing the merits of what Plato recommends. Un fortunately, it appears to me that Rosen's analysis assumes that the first two issues resolve the third. However, a "correct" under standing of forms does not, it seems to me, commit us to the view that "order and stability in speech and deed depend upon</page><page sequence="15">306 BERND MAGNUS what Socrates calls Ideas" (p. 162). This is not an idle criticism I am making. Rosen's indictment of modern philosophy as nihilism cannot be made persuasive merely by showing what Plato really meant. He must show that what Plato meant was, in some sense, true. And although this is insisted on throughout the book, the critical reader is left in doubt. One is troubled by the meaning and logical force of statements like: "Propositions are dianoetic icons of the being of things; hence the correspond ence between speech and things is an image of truth as uncovered ness or intelligibility, and not truth itself. The good is not the principle of utility in an anthropomorphic sense but, as the visibility or intelligibility of the world, the donor of utility in all senses of that term" (p. 195). Apart from the question of the meaning of these sentences, why are they unavoidable, that is, true? Moreover, if it is true that "Plato does not understand Being as a process, but, if as anything, then as the intelligibility of the world manifested in extra-historical shapes as whatness, and as the intelligence, manifested as psyche, which grasps the world" (p. 196) ; does it follow that the world is in fact "manifested in extra-historical shapes as whatness ?" I remind the reader that Rosen does not merely claim that non-Platonic philosophy is mistaken. He argues that it is nihilism. Space does not permit me to analyze in detail any of the arguments which allege that "the whole" is "intelligible." But, to the extent that arguments can be derived from the last two chapters, Rosen's Platonic hypothesis involves the following: (1) "The whole" is intelligible. (2) The intelligibility of "the whole" cannot be exhibited in a single "speech." (3) No speech is philosophical which denies the intelligibility of the whole. (I shall, hereafter, substitute "reality" for Rosen's "the whole.") Now "wisdom," according to Rosen, is "the claim by someone to have given a complete rational speech," (p. 5) that is, a com plete account of reality. But, plainly, the achievement of wisdom is ruled out by the second hypothesis, the inability to give a complete account of reality. This does not trouble Stanley Rosen. For even though "such a claim cannot be fulfilled, . . . that takes</page><page sequence="16">NIHILISM, REASON, AND "THE GOOD" 307 nothing from its validity as the end and standard of philos ophy" (p. 5). I find that puzzling. If wisdom is the claim to have given a complete rational speech, a claim which cannot be fulfilled, then wisdom is claiming the impossible. More accurately, it is not merely to claim the impossible, but to claim to have done the impossible. Now if claiming to have done the impossible, what cannot be done, "takes nothing from its validity as the end and standard of philosophy," I fear that sense and non sense are indistinguishable. By Rosen's own standards, of course, that is a case of nihilism. Let me try to put this another way. Consider the previously cited definitions of nihilism: (a) "The evidence for 'sense' is 'nonsense' and for 'nonsense' is 'sense'. This is what I mean by nihilism" (p. 22); (b) "And if an utterance can never be falsified, there is no difference with respect to it, between true and false, or sense and nonsense. Is this not nihilism?" (p. 33). Now the claim to have given a complete rational speech, a complete account of reality, is, we are told, impossible. But in that case the claim is either false or nonsense. If we are told, moreover, that the impossible claim is nonetheless a "valid" standard for philosophic wisdom, and I take "valid" to mean "true," then we are being told that a false or nonsensical statement is "valid," i.e., true. Is that not plainly an instance of nihilism as specified in (a) and (b) above? As far as I am concerned, I am not impressed with the label "nihilism." It simply seems to me that if wisdom is to claim to have done the impossible, then that takes everything away from the validity of the claim. It is as if the standard for "true" mathematics was the claim to have squared the circle, or the standard of ethics the keeping of promises which cannot be kept. What I have said, in sum, requires the abandonment of one of the three above-mentioned hypotheses. To make his thesis coherent Rosen would probably have to claim that a complete rational account ("speech") of reality can be given, in order to avoid the inconsistency of his argument. Of course, he has fore closed on that option. If, however, one accepts the view that a complete account of reality is possible, then, to be sure, it becomes difficult to brand as "nihilists" those philosophers who, in addition to Plato, have attempted to achieve precisely that. There is another sense, it seems to me, in which Rosen's</page><page sequence="17">308 BERND MAGNUS charge of "nihilism" can be self-reflexively applied. If it is the case that every philosophic speech is partial, that means that every speech is an incomplete rendering of "intelligible" reality, i.e., an interpretation. Now, further, if nihilism, in its root sense, is the severing of reason and good or the construction of reason and good, what is the difference between "construction" and "interpretation"? Stated differently: if speeches about reality are always partial, interpretations, are they not re-constructions, i.e., incomplete constructions of intelligible reality? But in that case philosophy itself is nihilism, since it must always be the partial "construction" of reason and good. The motive of this reductio ad absurdum should be plainly stated. I am troubled by self-appointed "defenses" of reason, however well-intentioned, and by polemical accounts which claim that there is one "true" philosophy, not merely in the sense that others are mistaken, but in the sense that all other positions reduce to "nihilism." Perhaps this simply reflects my own bias for openness, a bias which finds a deeper wisdom in the Socrates who loved wisdom but knew only his own ignorance, than in the Platonic Socrates who could order the polis if he could but rule it. IV I should like to conclude this discussion with some observa tions to which I referred earlier concerning the relationship between philosophy and political nihilism generally. These remarks are not directed solely at Rosen's book, although they are occasioned by it, but at Heidegger as well. Heidegger and Rosen share the unexamined conviction that nihilism is not only a philosophic view but that, somehow, his torical nihilism is "rooted" in philosophical nihilism. The most sweeping statement of this view, in Heidegger, that I can recall without much difficulty is this one: The domain of the essence and event of nihilism is metaphysics itself, always granting that with this term we do not designate a doctrine or even merely a special discipline of philosophy, but think of the basic relational pattern (Grundgefixge) of beings as a whole, in so far as it is distinguished into a sensible and supersensible world and is sustained and defined by this distinction. Metaphysics is the historic sphere within which it is destiny that the supersensible world, the Ideas,</page><page sequence="18">NIHILISM, REASON, AND "THE GOOD" 309 God, the moral law, the authority of reason, progress, the happiness of the greatest number, culture, forfeit and annul their generative force in civilization.6 Heidegger, to be sure, subsumes history within metaphysics. He is able to do that, however, because! he sees nihilism as in augurated by Platonic dualism, the division of the two realms, and regards the history of metaphysics as the forgetting of the Being of beings. The history of the West, it can be said with but a slight exaggeration, is the history of nihilism, for Hei degger, because it is the history of Platonism. However that may be, it is important to note that, for Heidegger, the moral law, progress, the authority of reason, etc., forfeit their status in civilization as a consequence of the fact that "metaphysics" is sustained and defined by Platonic dualism. Moreover, this forfeiture is "destiny," that is, the destiny of Being itself. Rosen, differences notwithstanding, shares Heidegger's view of the dependency of history upon philosophy. Consider, for example, "Nihilism as a political or cultural phenomenon is a consequence of philosophy in two senses. First, it is a conse quence of the transformation of nature and eternity into history and temporality. . . . But second, it is a consequence of the at least partial failure of this revolutionary transformation" (pp. 193 194). Or consider once again, "Nihilism as a political and moral problem of our epoch has its roots in the epistemological and ontological teaching of the day" (p. 136). The conviction that the course of historical nihilism is shaped by philosophic systems helps, in part, to explain the extraordinary sense of urgency that Rosen attaches to his work: "... and I want to say very frankly that this book, or one like it, needs to have been written" (p. xviii). I do not intend to demean Rosen's purpose when I say that, quite plainly, there is more at stake in Nihilism than a "correct" account of reason and "good." Its purpose is "pro tective innoculation" against nihilism. "Such is the task of philo sophical medicine, and such is the intention of the pages which follow" (p. xx), we are told in the Preface. I have already stated that I consider the view that political nihilism is a consequence of philosophy to be mistaken. I should 6 Holzwege (Frankfurt a/Main, Klostermann, 1950), p. 204.</page><page sequence="19">310 BERND MAGNUS add, somewhat more emphatically, that it is simplistically in error. For if the argument is to make any sense, in Rosen or Heidegger, it must mean that philosophic strategies, somehow, cause political nihilism. But I do not see how anyone can take that view seriously, profound as it may appear to be. It is a view even less credible, in my opinion, than its opposite, causal economic deter minism. And I know of no contemporary Marxist philosopher who would claim that all philosophies are determined, causally, by socio-economic forces. Yet, if Heidegger and Rosen are not merely playing on the surface of words, and if they mean what they say, we are to accept that?at bottom?Dachau and Auschwitz, My Lai and racism, are "a consequence" of philo sophic systems. We are asked, in short, to close our eyes to the internal imperatives of economic, social, and political history. More accurately, in my opinion we are invited to close our eyes to history itself. I do not mean to imply that philosophic views and strategies have no historical consequences. One need only think of Marx to surrender that feigned humility. At best, however, the history of philosophic systems has been one element in a complex web of causal relations which have formed the modern world. Some philosophic systems have, no doubt, helped to shape the modern mind. But the view that one particular philosophic system or strategy has shaped the modern world is, it seems to me, merely counter-factual arrogance.
