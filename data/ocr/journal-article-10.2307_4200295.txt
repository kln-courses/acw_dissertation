<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TELL AL-HAWA PROJECT ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS IN THE NORTH JAZIRA 1986-87 By WARWICK BALL, DAVID TUCKER and T. J. WILKINSON with an appendix by j. a. black Introduction (W. Ball) Members of the British Archaeological Expedition to Iraq first visited Tell al-Hawa in January 1986 from the Saddam Dam. The site appears as a massive, solitary giant, dominating the landscape and dwarfing all other sites in the region (Plate la). From the summit, 30 m high, there is an impressive view over a vast plain covered with mounds in all directions. A walk over the main mound revealed a particularly wide range of pottery types representing most known periods. The size, scope and archaeological potential of Tell al-Hawa and the surrounding plain led us to decide on further investigation. A first season of survey and excavations was conducted from October 1986 to April 1987 inclusive. The aim of the project was to carry out a single, integrated study of a major site in its context. We would like to thank specially Dr Mu'ayyad Sa'id Damerji, the Director- General of Antiquities and Heritage, and Dr Abd as-Sittar Azzawi, then Director of the Antiquities Office in the North, without whose help the Hawa Project would not have been possible. For the duration of the 1987 season we were allowed use of Antiquities Office housing and working facilities in the citadel at Tel'afar, for which we are very grateful. Mr Salem Yunis, then Inspector at Tel'afar, was of consider- able assistance to us at all times, as were our representatives in the field, Mr Mohammed Zaki Abdul Kerim and Mr Meti Barbar al-Tumm. The field-work was supported by generous grants from the British School of Archaeology in Iraq and the British Academy. We would like to thank the respective Councils of both institutions for their support. We received considerable help on all levels during the season from Dr Jeremy Black, then Director of the British Archaeological Expedition to Iraq; Mr Roger Matthews, the Secretary Librarian of the Expedition, was able to take over the excavations as Acting Director for a short time after Warwick Ball was recovering from injuries received in a car accident. The expedition is also grateful to Mr Ton Hasselt, head of the Netherlands Engineering Consultants (NEDECO) in Mosul, and his wife Sandra, for their help and kindness throughout the season. As always however, by far the greatest support comes from the team of women and men who volunteer their time, hard work and expertise over many months of often very trying conditions. The North Jazira team consisted of: Warwick Ball (director), Tony Wilkinson (assistant director), David Tucker (survey), Lucy Blue, Barry Flood, Jeanne Nijhowne, Nigel Sadler, Louise Scott, Mark Shaw (archaeolo- gists), Susan Coliton (photographer), Andrew Fisher, Imogen Grundon (illustra- tors), Isabelle Munsch (finds assistant), Bronwen Morgan and Peter Sheehan</page><page sequence="2">I WARWICK BALL, DAVID TUCKER AND T. J. WILKINSON (surveyors). In addition, we were able to receive the help of two part-time volunteers: Murejka Hasselt and Fiona Hasselt. The following were also of considerable assistance to the Project: Wendy Ball, Helen MacDonald, Stuart Campbell, Wendy Knight and St John Simpson. The latter three were particularly helpful in their advice on Chalcolithic, Uruk and Sasanian-Islamic pottery respect- ively, though all errors in this report are the authors' own. We would also like to thank Dr Dominique Coll?n, Dr Joan Oates and Dr Michael Roaf for their many helpful comments and suggestions on this report. The work fell in to three parts: (1) an intensive field survey of an area of seventy- five square kilometres immediately surrounding Tell al-Hawa; (2) an intensive survey and analysis of the ca. eighty hectare surface of the site itself; and (3) preliminary soundings and excavations in selected areas of Tell al-Hawa. The surveys were carried out in the autumn, when ground visibility was at its optimum, and the excavations were carried out in the spring. The project was under the overall direction of Warwick Ball; T. J. Wilkinson was responsible for the area survey and David Tucker for the Tell al-Hawa surface survey. Each part of the fieldwork has been written up by those responsible, the concluding section reflects the ideas of all who participated. Despite the large amount of material that emerged from last season, it must be emphasized that it was only a very small-scale operation: the area survey was carried out by one person, as was the surface survey of the mound while the excavations themselves were carried out by a staff of only thirteen without the assistance of workmen. If nothing else, it is hoped that this report demonstrates the importance of results obtained by combined survey and excavation. The area (Fig. 1 ) In recent history the North Jazira was peopled by nomads and semi-nomads with few major settlements, but the most characteristic feature of the landscape today is the immense number of artificial mounds attesting to the numerous settled com- munities in the more distant past. Whilst most of these mounds are small?probably no more than village communities?some are comparable in size with centres of urbanization in the South. Some, such as Tell Brak or Tell Leilan are well-known, but others such as Tell Hoshi, at 100 hectares (Lloyd 1938: 141), Tell Farfara, at 106 hectares (Meijer 1986: 24), or Tell al-Hawa itself are less familiar, and reflect the past cultural and material wealth as much as the future archaeological potential of the area. However, there is evidence that nomadism was as much a feature of the distant past as urbanization (Postgate 1976; Donner 1986). Indeed, this constant interaction of nomadic and sedentary populations is one of the Jazira's most distinctive cultural features. The North Jazira in Iraq is roughly triangular in shape, bordered to the south by the Sinjar hills, the northeast by the Tigris River, and the northwest by the Syrian border (Fig. 1). This area is approximately that of ancient Katmuhu, which Saggs (1984: 45, 73) regards as of key strategic importance to Assyrian expansion to the north and northwest. In the North Jazira of Iraq we have therefore, a key area, rich in archaeological</page><page sequence="3">THE TELL AL-HAWA PROJECT ?Chagar Bazar Fig. 1. Location of the Tell al-Hawa Project. remains, with important cultural traditions of its own, that lay across the main routes of communication between the great centres of the ancient Near East. This report will provide preliminary evidence on the development of settlement, land use and communications for a small part of this area, and the growth and development of its main urban centre, Tell al-Hawa. The site (Fig. 2) The name Hawa ( &lt;sy&gt; ) in Arabic means "passionate desire", "craving", "love" or "amourousness" (not to be confused with hawa? \?* ?meaning "air"). The site was first reported in the early 19th century, when the traveller James Silk Buckingham (1827, 2: 7) passed across the North Jazira, "observing nothing peculiar in the way, except three small eminences ... being called respectively Tal Fraat, Tal Howa, and Tal Moos, ... like many others of a similar kind, scattered over the face of these desert wastes." Several considerations led to the selection of Tell al-Hawa as a site of prime importance for excavation: 1. A number of important excavations have taken place in adjacent areas: Tell Leilan, Tell Brak, Yarim Tepe, Tell ar-Rimah, Tell Taya, Tellul eth-Thalathat, Nimrud, Nineveh, Tepe Gawra, the Saddam Dam sites (Fig. 1). However, these</page><page sequence="4">WARWICK BALL, DAVID TUCKER AND T. J. WILKINSON metres ?f Fig. 2. Preliminary contour plan of Tell al-Hawa, showing areas excavated. excavations surround an archaeological void on the map. Obviously, an excavation in the centre of this void would help to fill out the archaeological picture for the region. 2. Of the very large number of sites in the North Jazira, Tell al-Hawa stands out: at 80 hectares in area and 30 m in height it is by far the biggest site and in a position to command communications through the area. Most of the cultural phases that are known in the North are represented, from Hassuna to Islamic, thus making it an ideal choice for a type site for the area. 3. The Saddam Dam Project has resulted in much needed detailed ceramic studies for most of these periods, but it was concerned mainly with village sites or, at most, relatively minor provincial administrative settlements. Excavations at a large, multi- period urban centre in the North are needed therefore to help answer broader questions. It is only at such a site that we would expect to find the major civil, military and religious architecture, the industrial and trading areas and, most important, the texts. 4. Tell al-Hawa has extensive surface material of the late 3rd millennium, while</page><page sequence="5">THE TELL AL-HAWA PROJECT 5 Khabur, Mitannian and Middle Assyrian ceramics indicate that it continued as a centre throughout the 2nd millennium. 5. Recent excavations in the Mesopotamian/Anatolian borderlands have posed many new questions on early urbanization in the North. At Tell al-Hawa Uruk sherds extend over an area of some 50 hectares, with remains apparently as high as 25 m above the plain. Ubaid material is also found. Previous work in the North Jazira The North Jazira came to the attention of professional archaeologists in the first half of the twentieth century, but with little more than sporadic reconnaissance. In 1937 Sir Aurei Stein carried out an aerial survey of Roman limes systems though his work was only published recently (1985: 107). He commented: "Among these mounds Tall Hawa and Tall Chilparat are so large as to indicate sites of considerable settlements dating from a very early period but probably occupied also down to Roman times. In the case of Tall Hawa which rises to more than 70 feet [ca. 22 m] plenty of ancient pottery, including painted sherds which may be prehistoric in type were picked up on the steep slopes". At about the same time, Seton Lloyd was carrying out a survey south of Jebel Sinjar, though he visited some sites to the north including Tell al-Hawa. His report contains the first detailed description of the site (Lloyd 1938: 136-7), and emphasizes in particular the range of pottery to be found on the surface. During the 1950s and 1960s the site was visited a number of times by David Oates and other members of the British School of Archaeology in Iraq. The records of the Iraqi Directorate-General of Antiquities were the first to reveal the vast numbers of sites that cover the plain (Abu al-Soof 1968; Directorate General of Antiquities 1970: 253-62 &amp; 1976: Maps 124 &amp; 125). Some 145 sites in the area were mapped and separate tables listed the approximate periods present at each site. Tell al-Hawa (Site No. 862) was reported as having Ubaid, Uruk, Jamdat Nasr and Late Assyrian material. An important reconnaissance of the area was carried out in 1985-86 by Salem Yunis of the Tel'afar Antiquities Office in preparation for the North Jazira Project, when many more sites were mapped and recorded (Salem Yunis, pers. comm.). The present work is therefore an ampli- fication of the original survey conducted by Mr Yunis and we wish to thank him and his colleagues of the Department of Antiquities and Heritage for their considerable help during the 1986 field season. In the early seventies a hoard of Old Babylonian cuneiform tablets was brought to the Iraq Museum from somewhere within the nahiya of Rabi'a, which covers the area of the North Jazira. It is tempting to identify Tell al-Hawa as its findspot but only further excavation can confirm this. The present project An extensive new irrigation scheme has been planned for the North Jazira, and work began in 1986. The scheme is to derive its water from the recently completed Saddam Dam on the Tigris River at Eski Mosul. The plans call for the construction</page><page sequence="6">? WARWICK BALL, DAVID TUCKER AND T. J. WILKINSON of an extensive network of canals, pipelines, feeder roads, agricultural complexes, new settlements and massive mechanical irrigators that will cover an initial 400 square kilometres, to be extended eventually over 750 square kilometres. These developments, together with the irrigated multi-cropping that will result, will obviously alter drastically the face and nature of the landscape. In particular many of the more subtle archaeological features such as small sites and evidence for ancient land use systems and routeways, will be obscured if not lost forever. In recognition of the urgency of the situation, the Directorate-General for Antiquities and Heritage of Iraq designated the area a rescue zone. Accordingly, foreign archaeological teams were invited to participate in a programme of rescue work, and it was agreed to share the excavations at Tell al-Hawa between the British Archaeological Expedition and the Japanese Archaeological Mission to Iraq of Kokushikan University, under the direction of Professor Hideo Fujii. The British involvement provides for a programme of survey and excavations based at Hawa. The main objective of the survey is to produce maps detailing the settlement patterns, communication systems and land use of the surrounding area. These will include information indicating those sites which have been cut or disturbed by construction work. Such data will be crucial for teams operating in the area in future, and it will also provide a picture of the ancient landscape before the irrigation project changes it. Note on terminology In the following preliminary report, the reader is asked to bear in mind that the examination and interpretation of the material is still incomplete. In particular, the use of "labels" to describe the cultural periods in the North has been a continual problem. Such labels at best are inadequate, at worst misleading. Those used here, therefore, are nothing more than convenient abbreviations, temporarily adopted. It is hoped that in the future a more suitable cultural sequence and period definition may emerge for the Jazira. Part 1: The Regional Study (T. J. Wilkinson) The survey area falls within what has been described as the "granary of Mesopotamia" (Weiss 1983: 40), although the marginal nature of the rainfall and the variable and sometimes low yields must not be overlooked. It should be emphasized that all the data presented here are derived from tangible field evidence, unlike the more hypothetical approach of site catchment analysis. This more empirical approach was made possible by the enormous potential of the North Jazira landscape, which although subtle (some might say dull), encompasses a wide range of evidence invaluable for landscape reconstruction. The archaeological landscape comprises three main elements: archaeological mounds ranging from 1 hectare to 80 hectares in size, "field scatters" of potsherds littered over many square kilometres of terrain, and shallow radiating valleys discordant to the original drainage system. The field scatters are interpreted here as being primarily a product of ancient fertilizing practice and they can be used as a means of inferring zones of ancient intensive land use. The shallow valleys appear to form the remains of ancient "hollow way" route systems.</page><page sequence="7">THE TELL AL-HAWA PROJECT 7 The choice of a limited survey was necessitated by various logistical constraints, notably the lack of a vehicle for much of the time. Although only a modest 75 sq km (amounting to some 10% of the projected irrigation area) was to be covered, it was felt that this would provide a firmer foundation for future research than a more haphazard survey of a wider area. The physical landscape and communications Climate and land use The project area lies well within the limits of dry land farming as defined roughly by the 250 mm rainfall isohyet (Wallen 1967 &amp; 1968). Mean annual rainfall, amounting to 320 mm per annum at Rabi'a and 350 mm per annum at Tell Uwainat allows the production of moderately reliable crops of wheat and barley. Recent statistics indicate yields in most years of 700 and 900 kg/ha for wheat and barley respectively, but in good years yields can rise as high as 1500 kg/ha. To allow the land to recover some of its fertility, as well as to conserve moisture, some 30% of the field area is left fallow in most years. Flocks of sheep, together with a small number of goats, are pastured on the harvested fields of cereal stubble until the cereal growing season in the early spring, when they are moved to outlying uncultivated areas. Geology and water supply Tell al-Hawa is situated within the northern half of a broad alluvial basin drained by the Wadi al-Murr, a small right bank tributary of the Tigris. Flow along the 3-5 m wide silt-lined channel is ephemeral, and even during the autumn rains of 1986, the bed was only occupied by a few pools of standing water. The basin fill includes upper strata of reddish-brown silty clays which, at depth, contain inter- bedded strata of gypsum. The underlying beds of sands, silts and clays include the Neogene continental Upper Fars series which forms the main regional aquifer. Beneath are the less aquiferous Neogene marine deposits of anhydrite/gypsum, marl and rock salt of the Lower Fars series. Springs and perennial surface water flow are absent within the area surveyed, but under conditions of low water abstraction, a water table at depths of less than 10 m can be tapped by shallow wells. As a result of an increase in the use of mechanical pumps in recent years, the water table appears to have been significantly lowered and now the pumped water supply for the village of Tell al-Hawa is slightly brackish. As a result, water must now be hauled by donkey or truck from a pumped well source at Tell Kuran, 4 km to the northeast. At the present stage of research, it is not clear whether surface water was ever present within the area, but, because water was only required for domestic consumption and watering of flocks, the limited supply required may simply have been extracted from shallow wells between 3 and 12 m in depth. Soils The soil forms the most valuable agricultural resource of the Tell al-Hawa area. The uniformly deep reddish-brown silty clay loams, classified as Calcic or Gypsic xerosols by the FAO soil classification system (UNESCO/FAO 1977), or more prosaically as Brown Soils (Buringh 1960: 211), are potentially</page><page sequence="8">8 WARWICK BALL, DAVID TUCKER AND T. J. WILKINSON fertile and only require the addition of nitrogen and phosphate to give sustained high crop yields (UNESCO/FAO 1977, v.VII: 68). It was in fact this high potential fertility that originally led to the Wadi al-Murr basin being selected for future agricultural development (Buringh 1960: 211). Within the survey area, the soils comprise a ploughsoil (Ap = ploughed "A" horizon) enriched with potsherds and other artifacts overlying at depths of 30-60 cm, a subsoil "B" horizon containing small calcium carbonate concretions (Fig, 3a). The concretions have accumulated probably over millennia as a result of the movement of calcium carbonate in solution from the overlying "A" horizon and its precipitation in the "B" horizon. In some localities to the east of Tell al-Hawa, strata of gypsum/ anhydrite occur at ca. 2 m beneath the surface but these do not appear to affect the growth of crops. Although the above soil type predominated within the survey area, in places sedimentation has resulted in multiple soil profiles in which later soils overlie pre-existing soils. This is best illustrated by an example from Site 33, located 3*5 km west-northwest of Tell al-Hawa, where a construction trench exposed the following sequence (Fig. 3b): (a) A lower soil profile with a buried A horizon (bA) containing large sherds of Hassuna pottery overlies an old calcium carbonate-enriched ? horizon (bBca). (b) Subsequent deposition of silt, clay and possibly some occupation debris resulted in the build-up of 1 m of sediment over a horizon containing Halaf and other Chalcolithic pottery. (c) The ensuing stable phase resulted in the development of a calcium carbonate-enriched horizon of a typical Calcic xerosol (Bea). (d) Finally, cultivation since the Halaf period has resulted in the formation of a ploughed "A" horizon (Ap) enriched in potsherds mainly of post-Chalcolithic type. As will be described below, these probably arrived as a result of manuring in antiquity. Other areas, for example a broad zone virtually devoid of surface sherds to the west of Tell al-Hawa, &gt; Calcium carbonate "IIW I XH'Xj XX HOLLOW WAV' RELICT WADI txJ Fig. 3.

Large enclosed depressions within or adjacent to many sites appear to be the result of excavation of soil, either for the construction of mudbrick or to make the local water table more accessible. Fig. 3c illustrates a section through such a depression at Site 15 (Mowasha on Fig. 4) where a trench dug to house a modern pumped well exposed ca. 3 m of grey-brown loams containing abundant cultural debris. This basin fill overlies a truncated calcium carbonate-enriched subsoil horizon (palaeosol on Fig. 3c). The original soils in the area had apparently been dug down to ca. 4 m below the level of the plain, and the resultant void became infilled with 3 m of sediment washed in from the adjacent mounds. From the contained pottery, which included a large Partho-Sasanian jar fragment and related ceramic types, this infill appears to have taken place over the last two thousand years. Similar infilled basins occur at many other sites in the area, but their original purpose remains unexplained. Valley systems The gently undulating plain around Tell al-Hawa slopes from north to south with a gradient of ca. 1:200 towards the Wadi al-Murr (Fig. 4). The monotony is broken only by tells and very shallow valleys of which there are two main types: (a) Shallow open valleys forming a roughly dendritic network, draining with the gradient of the land surface from north to south towards the Wadi al-Murr (wadis on Fig. 4). In plan these are often slightly sinuous, and valley cross profiles can be asymetrical as a result of lateral channel erosion in the past (Fig. 3d). Many of these valleys lack flow channels, and indeed today the channels are often completely ploughed across. From the above characteristics it appears that the channels were once deeper features containing flow channels, but as a result of the arrival of slopewash and ploughwash from the adjacent land they have become partly infilled with sediment. Valleys of similar form in the western Jazira in Syria proved, when excavated, to have been infilled by soil wash (Wilkinson 1976). As a result of the infill of selected valley segments some valley systems around Tell al-Hawa do not now form a complete drainage network. (6) Similar shallow valleys of open profile have straight alignments and radiate from or run between the larger tells. Unlike the first group of valleys, these do not accord with the main drainage lines. Instead they have alignments oblique to the contour lines and some even cross the channels of the first type (Fig. 4). In exceptional cases, short lengths of valley show a double cross profile (Fig. 3d) or exhibit sections where the long profile flows "up hill" for a short distance (Fig. 3e). This second type of valley is probably caused by the long-continued passage of men and animals which have produced hollow way routes between major mounds as described below. Vegetation The area is today virtually treeless with a heavily degraded moist steppe vegetation (Guest 1966: 72-82). It is beyond the northern limit of date production today, but date palms were probably more abundant during Abbasid times when Yaqut referrecxto their presence within the district of Tel'afar (Le Strange 1905: 99). No reconstruction of the former vegetation cover can be attempted because both pollen profiles and historical accounts appear to be lacking. However, palaeo- vegetation maps, constructed from sources beyond the North Jazira, show the survey area to have been south of any early-mid Holocene forest and forest steppe.</page><page sequence="10">10 WARWICK BALL, DAVID TUCKER AND T.

Sites recorded in 1986 within their archaeological landscape of field scatters (hatching), hollow ways and natural drainage systems (wadis). Further information comes from Gillet (in Guest 1966: 72-82) who has suggested that, allowing for the destructive effect of man over many millennia, much of the North Jazira was originally (in the early Holocene) a kind of savannah or open forest of Pistacia and other small trees. Regional communications Tell al-Hawa lies on one of the major inter-regional routeways, that which links Nineveh, to the southeast, with Nusaybin and south-east Turkey to the north-west</page><page sequence="11">THE TELL AL-HAWA PROJECT 1 1 (Fig. 1 ). This route also connects a series of pre-Islamic sites and significantly leads in the direction of the major late 3rd and early 2nd millennium centre of Tell Leilan in Syria. The importance of this route continued into Abbasid times when it became a major caravan route (Fiey 1964). A second route, less obvious on the ground, has been postulated to link Tell al-Hawa with Tell Brak in Syria (Lloyd 1938: 124). This route either led west or west-southwest from Tell al-Hawa towards Tell as-Samir probably to link with an east-west group of smaller mounds aligned upon Tell Brak (see van Liere and Lauffray 1954). Communications with the south via the Tel'afar plain and Wadi Tharthar were probably easy through the gap between the Sinjar hills and the low ridges in the vicinity of Tel'afar (Fig. 1). The cultural landscape The distribution of archaeological sites Figure 4 shows the distribution of sites of all periods found within the survey area. With the exception of a buried Hassuna site (Site 33) and a very low early ceramic Neolithic mound (Site 21), all sites showed significant mounding. The density of ground coverage on foot (indicated by the sample transects shown on Fig. 4) ensured that all noteworthy sites were discovered, although the omission of one or two flat early prehistoric sites cannot be excluded. Sites were sketched in the field and were subdivided into pottery collection areas according to their topography. Further details of the sites, their pottery collection areas and size are given in Table 1. In general, sites were between 1 and 2 km apart across the surface of the plain. The twenty-nine sites recorded within the 75 sq km area of survey yielded a mean site density for all periods of one site every 2*6 sq km. Many sites grouped under a single site number consist of multiple mounds in which the nucleus of occupation has moved a few tens or hundreds of metres through time. This layout is useful for purposes of survey because it usually facilitates the period-by-period subdivision of sites into readily isolated ceramic assemblages. This contrasts with large multi-period mounds where pottery is mixed within one large and complex area and can only be disentangled by resorting to elaborate sampling techniques or by reference to a pre-existing ceramic typology. Before examining the sequence of settlement patterns, it is necessary to review the other data indicated on the general survey map (Fig. 4). Land use zones An important, though subtle component of the archaeological landscape around Tell al-Hawa is a scatter of potsherds across the surface of the plain and through the ploughsoil. These "field scatters", shown by oblique hatching on Fig. 4, are important because firstly, where moderately dense (e.g., greater than 60 sherds per 100 sqm), they can be confused with sherd scatters of archaeological sites and secondly, they can be used to infer areas of fertilizing in antiquity. In the latter case, organic rubbish, manure and excrement scraped from streets, as well as ash from kilns and domestic ovens, when spread upon the fields as fertilizer would have resulted in the incorporation of artifacts into the ploughsoil (Wilkinson 1982). It seems unlikely that these sherd scatters represent short-lived extra-mural</page><page sequence="12">12 WARWICK BALL, DAVID TUCKER AND T. J.

The colour of the soils were more in keeping with the brown of cultivated areas rather than the grey of occupation debris, and the quality of the sherds in the scatters more abraded and generally poorer in quality than those found on the mounded parts of the site. In addition a mean sherd density of 2700 per 100 m square on the site at Tell al-Hawa (see Table 3) contrasts with a range of 10-140 sherds per 100 m square on the scatters.</page><page sequence="13">THE TELL AL-HAWA PROJECT 13 Such sherd scatters were mapped by setting out radial transects from Tell al-Hawa and its satellite mounds (Fig. 4). At intervals of usually every 200 or 300 paces (c. 188 or 282 m) along these transects, 10 x 10 m sample squares were set out and all pottery was collected and counted. Other artifacts, flints, fragments of kiln waste, brick fragments, parts of figurines and pieces of basalt quern stones were also recorded. All diagnostic finds were retained, but body sherds were discarded after counting. Sample transects varied in length from 1 km around the smaller sites to over 3 km from Tell al-Hawa (Fig. 5). The most frequent sherd densities were 20-40 and 40-60 sherds per 100 sq m, and in general, the density of scatter diminished away from the sites (Fig. 5). The rate of fall was greater away from the smaller than from the larger sites, and as a result, the smaller sites are surrounded by the smaller sherd scatter rings. The greatest problem during sampling was to maintain a ground surface of consistent quality so that artifact counts were a true reflection of their distribution through the ploughsoil. In the autumn, the only season when the ground is not obscured by crops, the visibility of artifacts can vary according to the state of the surface. To ensure consistent counts, sample squares were therefore set out on unploughed fallow land and older ploughed land; harrowed soils and fields covered with straw, or which had only just been ploughed, were avoided. The above-mentioned decline in sherd density away from sites probably results from the preferential spreading of fertilizer on fields adjacent to the settlements. This reflects the efforts of farmers to minimize their efforts and costs by concentrating the most intensive system of cultivation within a short distance of the settlement (Chisholm 1979: 41-5). Minor oscillations in sherd density can be accounted for either by observational error or as a result of slight differences in ground surface conditions. Where sample squares fell within a valley floor, sherd counts were often slightly lower than on adjacent slope crests, presumably because sedimentation had partly obscured sherds on the valley floor (e.g., Fig. 5d). Finally, there is some suggestion that sherd densities are lower within a ring of approximately 500 m radius from Tell al-Hawa (evident on Fig. 5d). This may result from one of two causes: (a) Pasturing of flocks and herds adjacent to the settlement would have resulted in "natural" manuring, so that settlement-derived fertilizers would not have been necessary. (b) The deposition of fine sediments washed from the mound may have covered part of the surrounding terrain and any associated sherd scatters with an apron of finer sediment. Until trial pits have been dug in these areas it is impossible to determine which of the above interpretations is correct. Ideally the date of the sherd scatters can be estimated from diagnostic pottery collected, it being assumed that the fertilizing agents, having been gathered from the nearby settlement, would also incorporate contemporaneous rubbish from the settlement. In certain cases in the Near East however, farmers in the recent past have been known to excavate ancient tells to extract their phosphate and nitrogen-rich soils to spread on their fields. As a result, field scatters, although comprising early pottery, would be of recent date. In the survey area it is highly likely that manuring was probably an ancient technique because: (a) There is no known tradition of digging fertilizers at Tell al-Hawa. (b) If such excavation had taken place at Tell al-Hawa, the pottery scatters would almost certainly include more Islamic, Ubaid and Northern Uruk pottery, strata of which are exposed either on the low mounds or around the base of the main mound in locations accessible to fields. Where, for example, Islamic sherds do occur within field scatters, they are around some outlying Islamic sites (e.g., Sites 4 and 28), which today are uninhabited. (c) The field scatter sherds are usually both small and extremely abraded, a condition unlikely to have been achieved as a result of only a generation or two of ploughing. (d) If the fertilization with archaeological deposits had taken place in the recent past, field scatters might be expected to occur around only the modern or late Islamic villages of Tell al-Hawa, Tell Wardan, Tell Kuran, Mowasha, al-Botha and al-Khubaza. Fig. 4 shows that this is clearly not the case, and instead both occupied and long-abandoned sites are surrounded by field-scatters. Indeed, the size of the scatter around Tell al-Hawa is more in keeping with the enormous size of the ancient site than with the relatively modest scale of the present village. To conclude, it appears most likely that the field scatters resulted from spreading of settlement- derived refuse at approximately the time suggested by the diagnostic sherds collected. This appears to have been mainly during the 3rd, 2nd and 1st millennia b.c., with minor activity being recorded around</page><page sequence="14">14 WARWICK BALL, DAVID TUCKER AND T. J.

The density distribution map (Fig. 4) shows the main site to have been surrounded by the most extensive sherd scatter of 1-5-2 km radius (to the 40 sherds/ 100 sq m contour). The smaller satellite sites: 5, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20 and 23 are surrounded by smaller land use rings of between 0-5 and 1 km radius. The absence of field scatters on Fig. 4, between Sites 17 and 19, is a result of the recent development of irrigated farming, which has rendered much of the area inaccessible. Inevitably, as the irrigation project gains momentum, this situation will become increasingly common. A preliminary impression is that late 3rd millennium b.c. sherds were mainly confined to the large sherd scatter zones surrounding Tell al-Hawa, which in addition, contained sherds of the 2nd and 1st millennia b.c. Scatters around the satellite settlements comprised mainly 2nd and 1st millennium b.c. sherds although one or two Ninevite 5 sherds were also recognized. The Tell al-Hawa scatter was distorted by two lobes which extended 2-5 km to the west and 4-4 km to the southeast of the site (measured to the 40 sherds/100 sq m contour). Sufficient checks were made to establish that these were real features and did not result from one or two chance high readings. Although the large southeast lobe was exaggerated by the presence of scatter zones around Sites 3, 14, 15 and 22, the trend of the readings was consistently high all the way from Tell al-Hawa to the southeast. This implies that there was a preferential distribution of fertilizer along this alignment. Both lobes may therefore result from the movement of settlement refuse out to the fields along the main lines of communication; in this case to the west or northwest towards Tell Brak and Tell Leilan respectively and towards the southeast along the Nineveh road. A single large negative anomaly defined by sherd densities of less than 10 sherds per 100 sq m extends to the west of Tell al-Hawa. Although it was not possible to check the vertical distribution of pottery through the soil profile by excavation, it seems from the distribution of valleys on Fig. 4 that deposition of sediments in this area may have partly obscured a pre-existing denser sherd scatter. In particular, this is the area where an infilled wadi channel has apparently been diverted by the presence of the lower mounding of the tell or by a hollow way route leading to the southwest. Whatever the cause, the main valley appears to be broken in plan and the resultant disruption in the former drainage pattern may have caused the aggradation of sediments in this area. Further insights into the relationships between sherd scatters and settlements will become apparent below where the settlement pattern is resolved into its component periods. Local route systems As was noted above, a number of discordant valleys apparently radiate from Tell al-Hawa. Similar hollow ways have been recognized elsewhere in the Jazira: to the west of Mosul (Buringh 1960: 212-13; see also D. Oates 1968: Pl. 1); across much of the Syrian High Jazira (van Liere and Lauffray 1954) and in the western Jazira of Syria around Tell Sweyhat (Wilkinson 1976). Clearly, analysis of a much larger area is required before such hollow way alignments can be accepted as totally convincing, but their presence does imply that Tell al-Hawa did function as a significant communication node for the area. The large size of the hollow ways, which can be over 100 m across and 2 m or more in depth, suggests that they may have been caused by prolonged periods of use by men and animals. It is evident today that hollow ways can develop in both dry and wet weather: during the former, the soil breaks down into dust and is readily blown away, whereas during wet conditions the ground along tracks is churned up, loses its soil structure and thus becomes vulnerable to both erosion by water as well as by later episodes of blowing. The effect of storm run-off is confirmed by the presence of erosional gullies along the floors of some discordant valleys. Because the hollow ways cannot be dated directly, their age can only be inferred</page><page sequence="16">16 WARWICK BALL, DAVID TUCKER AND T. J. WILKINSON by reference either to documentary sources, if available, or by the dates of sites along them. The only documented road known to the writer is the Abbasid road from Mosul via Eski Mosul (Balad) to Nusaybin which almost certainly passed by Tell al-Hawa (Fiey 1964, Fig. 1). This is indicated on Fig. 4 by the southeast-northwest alignment from Site 23 through Tell al-Hawa towards Site 29 (see also Fig. 6f). With the possible exception of Tell al-Hawa however, this route is not conspicuous for its Abbasid sites (Fig. 6f). In fact, the presence of 1st, 2nd and 3rd millennium b.c. sites along the route suggests that it is of much greater antiquity. In general, hollow ways radiate from Tell al-Hawa towards the larger sites in the survey area (Sites 9, 19/20, 23 and 28). Such sites, which combine large area (hence population) and height (proportional to length of habitation?see Table 1) will generate more traffic through time than smaller sites, thus pathways between large mounds will be routes of greatest long-term interaction. The presence of pottery at least as early as Ninevite 5 on all of these secondary sites suggests that the linking hollow ways may be at least as old as the first half of the 3rd millennium. The settlement sequence Our present state of knowledge of the ceramic types of the region limits the treatment of the development of settlement patterns to a review of those periods for which the ceramic types are better known. With further work in the area it should be possible to refine the ceramic sequence and eventually produce more detailed maps for each settlement phase. The preparation and appearance of settlement maps is further distorted by the presence, on some multi-period mounds, of later occupation deposits which obscure the Hassuna, Halaf, Ubaid and Northern Uruk levels. The selection of the occupation periods in the accompanying distribution maps (Fig. 6) is therefore one of expedience, being reliant largely on the existence of common and distinctive "type fossils". Hassuna and Halaf (7th-6th millennia b.c.). Figs. 6a; 14: 1-6, 11. The presence of later occupation deposits on many of the mounds probably obscures much evidence of Hassuna and Halaf occupation. As a result, the apparent distribution of sites towards the Wadi al-Murr may merely reflect the development of later settlements over early sites away from this wadi. Certainly, even the limited evidence available suggests significant occupation of the plain by the 7 th and 6th millennia b.c. Ubaid and Northern Uruk [5th and 4th millennia b.c.). Fig. 14: 7-10, 12-23. Although Ubaid wares occurred on two or three sites (Table 1), their apparent absence from other sites may be a result of burial beneath later deposits. Northern Uruk ceramics (definite or probable) were found on fifteen sites but rarely in significant quantities. Whether this indicates that there was a small dispersed population on the outlying settlements at this time is unclear. If it does, it is counter- balanced by a substantial population on the main site of Tell al-Hawa. Because of the distorting effect of overburden for the Ubaid and Northern Uruk ceramic distributions, no distribution maps have been attempted for this period.</page><page sequence="17">THE TELL AL-HAWA PROJECT 17 NINEVITE 5 ? 29 0 ? 9 .8 HELLENISTIC X1 'e^Tm/l %e ??-- .-. xt*. /.

J. WILKINSON Later 3rd millennium b.c. {'Akkadian'). Fig. 6c. Storage jars and related fine wares of this period were common at the expanded site of Tell al-Hawa, but such wares were rare on the outlying settlements, which were either unoccupied or formed small outlying farmsteads or outposts. Northern Akkadian wares were present, however, in significant amounts in the field scatter surrounding Tell al-Hawa and it is likely that the 1-5-2-5 km radius zone (of greater than 40 sherds per 100 sq m, Fig. 4) attained its maximum development during this time. Khabur {early 2nd millennium b.c.). Figs. 6d; 15: 15-27. Sites of this period were conspicuous because of the presence of distinctive Khabur painted wares on the upper levels of many mounds. Settlements were, as in Ninevite 5 times, dispersed around a central settlement of Tell al-Hawa which had main- tained its Akkadian size of 66 hectares. Although Khabur wares are present in field scatters, further analysis is necessary to determine to what extent these contribute to the overall pattern of field scatters. Middle and Late Assyrian {mid-2nd to mid-lst millennium b.c.). Fig. 16: 1-7, and 8-15. Preliminary ceramic analysis suggests that by Late Assyrian times, at least fourteen sites were occupied around Tell al-Hawa (Table 1). By this time many smaller settlements had encroached onto the former cultivated land of Tell al-Hawa. The distinctive white painted Nuzi wares of the Mitannian period were not identified in any of the sherd collections from the survey, though their existence at Tell al- Hawa attests to their presence in the region. Hellenistic {late 1st millennium b.c.). Figs. 6e, 16: 16-20. Our lack of knowledge of Median/Achaemenid pottery types precludes the presentation of settlement distribution maps for this period. However, by the Hellenistic period a completely dispersed settlement pattern is apparent, with Tell al-Hawa being abandoned. The resultant void was partly filled by the growth of small settlements at Sites 2, 3 and 6. Such a pattern of small villages and hamlets probably enabled the entire North Jazira plain to be farmed, but the virtual absence of Hellenistic pottery from most areas of field scatter suggests that settlement- derived fertilizer had ceased to be used and that the intensity of cropping had diminished. ParthojRoman to modern {1st millennium a.d. and later). Figs. 6 f; 16: 21-28. Small villages continued to develop close to Tell al-Hawa (Sites 4, 6 and 8) and the earlier distinctive ring of satellite settlements had by now entirely disappeared. There is little or no correspondence between the distribution of later settlements and field scatters, and although Islamic sherds were present within the field scatters, they were usually restricted to within a short distance of the Islamic sites. By the 19th and 20th centuries, much or all of the area had been deserted and was occupied periodically by nomadic tribes of Bedu. Not until after Seton Lloyd surveyed the area in the 1930s did settlements start to re-appear and to build up the modern settlement pattern.</page><page sequence="19">THE TELL AL-HAWA PROJECT 19 Settlement systems and land use The practice of spreading habitation refuse on fields around settlements implies that land use intensity was greater at some periods in the past than it is today. Modern Jazira systems, although described as "high yield dry farming" by Weiss (1983: 41), provide in most years only relatively modest yields of less than 1,000 kg per hectare and still represent a risky undertaking in dry years. Manuring, by adding humus, promotes good soil structure and moisture retention. This, together with the addition of nutrients, phosphate, potash and nitrogen, would both lessen the impact of dry years and would raise yields during wet years. From the preliminary survey data it seems that the settlement system probably attained its maximum settlement area during the 3rd and part of the 2nd millennium B.c., a period when the use of settlement-derived manure was also apparently at its peak. However, the date of distribution of field scatters requires further supporting evidence. Unfortunately textual sources have provided little on the use and techniques of manuring before the classical period. This is partly because field scatters may be limited in their occurrence to non-saline soils (thus excluding the Mesopotamian lowlands from which many of the agricultural texts come). Furthermore, evidence from around other sites suggests that such manuring events can be short-lived and thus may not correspond to the period for which texts survive (Wilkinson 1986). It will therefore be an objective of future seasons to demonstrate whether field scatters run beneath dated sites, structures or sedimentary deposits, or can be dated by other means. A similar pattern of increased use of settlement-derived manure during specific phases has also been observed around two major Islamic cities (Sohar and Siraf in the Gulf) and also around the late 3rd millennium b.c. town of Tell Sweyhat in Syria (Wilkinson 1982). In all three cases, the main period of spreading of urban waste as manure corresponded to the main phase of urbanization. On the other hand in the areas around Kurban H?y?k in southeast Turkey, similar studies have demonstrated that manuring using comparable sources took place when the area contained its maximum population, albeit primarily within rural settlements, during the late Roman/Byzantine times (Wilkinson 1986). In all the above cases however, it is evident that the presence of zones of intensive manuring and cultivation cor- responded to either an urban or to a regional peak in population. Although further dating evidence is essential, it is possible that during the 3rd, 2nd and part of the 1st millennia B.c., a population within a central town and surrounding rural settlements was supplied with food from a potentially rich agricultural plain, the vagaries of dry farming yield being evened out by the generous application of fertilizer. This may have made the area more closely fitted to the description of high yield dry farming applied by Weiss (1983: 41), although of course yields per hectare would still not attain those of the irrigated lowlands. Whether the total yield over very extensive areas was as great or greater than those of the lowlands is a matter for future research in which the present techniques should play a crucial role. When population became less urbanized during the late 1st millennium b.c. or later, perhaps less intensive fallowing systems were adopted.</page><page sequence="20">20 WARWICK BALL, DAVID TUCKER AND T. J. WILKINSON Part 2: Tell al-Hawa Surface Survey (David Tucker) As a preliminary investigation to the programme of excavations at Tell al-Hawa, a detailed surface survey of the mounded area was completed, in an attempt to disentangle and define the various occupational phases present and their extent. This survey was conducted over a period of two months, November and December, and the collected sherds were processed during January 1987. The main mound covers some 18 hectares at its base, and on all but the west side it is surrounded by a complex area of mounding an additional c. 60 hectares in extent (Fig. 2). The mounding is most extensive to the southeast, where it survives in places up to 6 m in height. The modern village covers a rectangular area of 26 hectares to the east of the main mound. Overall, the mounded area covers some 80 hectares. Surrounding the mounded area is a ring of grey soil discolouration and sherd scatters extending a further 50-100 m radius from the site. For the purposes of the surface survey, the site was divided into three main areas: {a) The main mound (Sample Areas: A, B, Fig. 7) (?) The extensive lower mounded area (Sample Areas: C-J, L-X; Fig. 8) (c) The modern village (unsampled). The main mound (Figs. 7 and 8) Notes on collection For late third millennium and later periods, only good diagnostic sherds were collected from the main mound, and notes were made as to the relative abundance of types. An attempt was made to collect all diagnostic sherds from the Ninevite 5, Ubaid and earlier periods. Obsidian and flint were not systematically collected. An attempt was made to take at least one measurement (usually thickness) of all oven fired brick fragments to see if any significant variations in the distribution could be discerned. The main mound was a complex area to investigate and no single systematic sampling strategy could be effectively employed. It was divided into three areas: (a) the summit (A 1-20); (b) the external slopes (B5-170); {c) the internal gullies (B200-219). The summit {Area A) The summit area is roughly crescent-shaped, its surface grassed and uneven, tending to slope down from the north edge towards the centre. This sloping surface acts like a basin, surface water is channelled inwards, and in time it has cut deep ragged gullies through the stratified deposits; the gullies converge before draining out through a large wadi cutting through the south slopes. Where the summit is not grassed it has been disturbed in a few parts by heavy machinery and some now ruinous small mudbrick and concrete structures, marking the existence of a police post in recent times. A cemetery containing over 300 marked graves covers part of the eastern end of the summit. Access to the top for vehicles is provided by a partly metalled strip of road cut into the south slope of the tell. The surface of the summit was either grassed and stable with very few or very small sherds, or roughly disturbed by machines and liberally covered with large diagnostic sherds. It was felt that little could be gained from a systematic investigation of the summit. A paced sketch plan was made of all features (Fig. 7), and cultural material was collected from all major cuts and disturbances (A 1-20).</page><page sequence="21">THE TELL AL-HAWA PROJECT 21 KEY TABLET SIKKATU FRAGMENTS Fig. 7. Sketch plan of the main mound (Areas A and B) showing surface collection areas. The slopes {Area B) The steep slopes of the mound were of very diverse character; a sampling grid could not easily be employed and was thought to be inappropriate. It was hoped that the detailed plotting of sherds, and particularly in situ sherds, would permit an estimate to be made of the minimum height of the mound in each particular period. Further, it may be possible to plot (from the minimum heights) approximate</page><page sequence="22">22 WARWICK BALL, DAVID TUCKER AND T. J. WILKINSON contour levels for the mound as it gradually grew through time. In this way the structure of the mound might be better understood. This objective has been only partially realized so far, as the contour survey, which would enable the relative levels of sampling areas to be determined, has not yet been completed. The topography of the earlier?particularly the Uruk?mound might therefore need to be eventually re-assessed. In sampling the slopes, the surface conditions of the collection areas were recorded (e.g., eroding edge, sheep track, cut, slope, wash, etc.). Approximate dimensions of the area and its depth below the summit edge above were noted and then put on a plan of the slopes. The sides of the mound were recorded in a series of four panoramic elevation drawings. The slopes of the mound were divided into five areas, distinguished by marked changes in surface conditions (Fig. 7): {a) the western slopes (B5-25); {b) the northern slopes (B26-65); (c) the eastern slopes (above the village; B66-138); (d) the southern slopes (B139-159); {e) the southwestern slopes (B160-170). (a) Western slopes. The western slopes were predominantly grassed and stable. In the south and central areas sherds were collected along eroding edges and in shallow cuts at the top of the slope (B14-25); no material was in situ and no pre-Uruk material was collected. At the northern end a gully (B10-13) cut a muddy swathe, revealing two oven fired brick floors at 5 and 6 m below the summit. Below the lower floor the gully narrows from 10 m wide to less than 5 m, cutting down through softer levels. At 2 m below the lower floor (8 m below the summit) an Uruk carinated bowl was exposed (B12, Fig. 19: 33). Other sherds found in this gully included Ubaid, Northern Uruk, a little Ninevite 5, later 3rd millennium b.c., Khabur, Middle and Late Assyrian. It is assumed that the oven fired brick floors belong to the late 3rd/early 2nd millennium b.c., and given the relative scarcity of Ninevite 5 material, are probably built on the Uruk mound. At the north end of the slope, the summit of the tell is higher than elsewhere. This must derive from Late Assyrian deposits (which were strongly in evidence in the cuts sampled on the summit A9 and Al2). Fired bricks on or below the slopes were scarce. (b) Northern slopes. The northern slopes (Areas B26-65) are largely grassed and stable, except for two prominences that projected beyond the steep slopes which were eroded by wind action on their east sides (B36-8, 41-6). In the grassed areas, most exposed material derived from slope wash and was not in situ; the slope wash effectively masked all pre-3rd millennium b.c. material. In the weathered area (B41-6) Ninevite 5 material was exposed, and in a small gully (B51-54) Ubaid and Uruk sherds were found near the bottom of the slope. A major gully (B59-65) cut in the slopes above the modern school exposed much early 2nd millennium and later material, though at the same time created a thick layer of sediment fanning out to conceal earlier deposits on the slope and on the lower area below. At the top of this gully on the west side were traces of a substantial mudbrick wall at least 2 m thick, subsequently investigated by excavation (see Part 3, below). In the middle of the gully, 1-20 m below the summit, were traces of a floor of oven fired bricks (32 x 15 x 8-5 cm). On the south side 3-5 m below the summit, another fragmentary floor of oven fired bricks (6-5-7 cm thick) and rubble was visible. Two metres below this floor was a circular brick structure built of curved, segmented oven fired bricks bonded in clay mortar. It may have been a well. Limestone rubble footings bearing mudbrick were exposed in the centre of the gully, and nearby another oven fired brick surface occurred at the same level as the well. Large quantities of Northern Akkadian sherds were present, so it is likely that the walls and floors belong to this period. The gully contained many fragments of oven fired brick. No in situ material was found dating earlier than the Northern Akkadian period, although a large, brown mudbrick wall crossing the gully obliquely 10 m below the summit probably belongs to an earlier period. (c) Eastern slopes. The eastern slopes, to the east of the large gully described above, have been eroded by wind and rain leaving little opportunity for grass, soils or even loose slope-wash to accumulate on the steep sides. Much of the northern end of this section is masked by collapsing slope-wash and debris, but at the southern end erosion has removed most of this wash, so areas of horizontal stratigraphy have been exposed providing a "window" on in situ deposits. Where the slope is steepest more stratigraphy is</page><page sequence="23">THE TELL AL-HAWA PROJECT 23 exposed, whilst on gentler slopes the eroded material conceals and gradually buries the horizontal strata. Consequently, at the bottom of the slopes there is a masked area, where material from all periods accumulates, slumped and jumbled together, one wash upon another. In the area of these eastern slopes below the cemetery (B66-99) Northern Akkadian and Khabur sherds were relatively scarce, whilst Uruk sherds were abundant, particularly on the middle slopes (due to factors just outlined). The only exception was one place where the slope was weathered from the top (B97, 98, 100, 101 up to 4 m below the summit), where Khabur sherds were more conspicuous. Generally, the later 3rd millennium-Khabur component appears less intense at this eastern end of the tell, and the Uruk levels might be higher here than elsewhere, some 5 m below the summit. On the slopes south of the cemetery and below the high south end of the tell (B103-138), Middle Assyrian sherds were present in larger quantities than elsewhere, with 65% of all Middle Assyrian diagnostics from the surface survey being found here. On the upper slopes below the highest part of the mound, 4 sherds of white painted Nuzi ware and other fine painted wares also probably from the mid-2nd millennium were found, suggesting that this south end of the tell (a citadel?) owes much to the late-2nd millennium component. Ninevite 5 material appeared to be particularly scarce given the large number [ca. 200) of collection points and the well-exposed tell slopes. Stratified groups of Uruk material were sampled at ?106, 111, 122 and 123. The slopes were largely devoid of oven fired bricks, which may have been re-used in the village at the foot of the slope. (d) South slopes. The south slopes (B139-159) are lower than elsewhere and slope down relatively gently between the metalled track and the wide gully that drains out from the heart of the tell. They were semi-grassed, broken by swathes of shallow channels that could drain surface water. Unlike the east slopes, there were no high eroding edges and no stratified deposits were exposed. On the mid-slopes (B141, 145, 153) three Halaf sherds were recognized alongside Ubaid and Northern Uruk material. No material before the late 3rd millennium was noted in situ and no Late Assyrian. At 7-5 m below the summit limestone footings were associated with concentrations of later 3rd millennium and Khabur pottery. Fired brick rubble was scarce. (e) Southwest slopes. The southwest slopes (B160-170) to the west of the wide gully, like the east slopes have been eroded. The slopes are low and gentle similar to the south slopes, and in situ Northern Uruk deposits were exposed in a narrow band 4-5 m below the summit. Beneath the Uruk levels was the greatest density of Ubaid sherds found anywhere on the site (50% of the total collected) and there was much obsidian. Neither Middle nor Late Assyrian material was recognized in this area. The interior gullies The interior gullies (B200-219) were rapidly investigated, and the broad trends recognized on the external slopes were merely reinforced. Much of the interior gullies were covered in slope-wash and little more could be gained from attempting to plot each locus precisely, given the information gained from the external slopes. Consequently, little material was collected (mainly novel types and small finds); instead notes were made as to which types were present and on architectural features. The south gully (B200-202) cuts down from the metalled road. At the south end (near the road) large limestone and sandstone footings bearing up to 2 m of mudbrick were exposed, oriented approximately east-west. In area B202 a short 6 m length of wall footing of red sandstone rubble and bricks survives some 3-5 m below the summit, at approximately the same level as the footings at the end of the gully. At a point between B202-203, stratified Northern Uruk sherds were present 5 m below the summit. In situ Northern Uruk sherds were also found in B204 (6 m below the summit), B211, B213 (5-5 m below the summit) and B214 (8 m below the summit). Above the Northern Uruk material in B213 and 214, later 3rd millennium-Khabur in situ material was 4-3 m below the summit. Whereas the later 3rd millennium-Khabur material was more prevalent in the south gully, Middle and Late Assyrian sherds were more obvious in the northern areas, particularly B209-215. A mere 3-5 m below the summit in B215, Ubaid and Northern Uruk material was found in grey ash. Considered with the evidence from the south-west slopes, it suggests that the post-Uruk deposits may be shallower here than elsewhere on the tell. (It is assumed that the substantial wall footings in the south gully are later 3rd millennium/Khabur and the footings mark the approximate level of the Uruk mound).</page><page sequence="24">24 WARWICK BALL, DAVID TUCKER AND T. J. WILKINSON Summary The investigation of the summit (Area A) revealed little material prior to the 2nd millennium B.c. An area of intense Late Assyrian occupation was identified at the northern end of the summit. In contrast, Middle Assyrian occupation seems to be more strongly in evidence at the south end, and on the upper adjacent slopes. The investigation of the steep slopes and gullies has greatly enhanced our knowledge of the tell, perhaps more importantly by clarifying the determining role of erosion in slope reduction, particularly on those slope areas facing eastwards, and its effect on the visibility of pre-Ninevite 5 material. The exposed mid-slope areas on the east and south slopes provide valuable "windows" on the earlier Uruk mound. The levels of stratified and unstrati??ed groups of Northern Uruk sherds all around the tell, together with the level of "late-3rd millennium wall footings", suggests that the Uruk mound must have been of a similar form to the high tell we see today, perhaps as little as 5 m lower, and possibly even higher in that area below the modern cemetery. A subsequent major phase of occupation would have occurred in the early 2nd millennium B.c., followed by Assyrian occupations and thicker deposits concentrated at the high northern and southern ends. The detailed approach to sampling the slopes has shown that the apparent scarcity of Ninevite 5 sherds on the tell is real. It has also identified some anomalies, such as the three Halaf sherds on the south slopes, the limited distribution of the four Nuzi sherds, and the definite Middle Assyrian presence at the south end of the tell. Thus it has been possible to assess general trends as to the character of this vast and complex tell based on firm data, rather than on chance finds and consequent ill- founded hypotheses. Lower mounded areas (Fig. 8) In the area immediately surrounding the slopes of the main mound, there is a sudden decrease in the density of sherds, except in an area that is unploughed in the vicinity of the pump below the gentler southern slopes (B139-59). The ploughed areas between Mound F and the main mound, and between Mound ? and the main mound below the north slopes, are largely devoid of sherds. The soils are dark brown and broken into large clods in areas that are flat or are depressions between the main mound and the mounds of the lower area. (The darker soils contrast with those on the mounds, which are grey, of smaller size clods and densely filled with pottery.) It is assumed that eroded deposits from the main mound have washed down masking deposits at its foot, presumably leaving heavier sherds and stones at the base of the slopes. This process seems to be responsible for the considerable depth of washed deposits in the fan below the gully (B59-65) to the northeast of the main mound; another fan of debris may be postulated south of Area X where a vast quantity of material would have been eroded out from the heart of the main mound. In the area immediately to the west of the main mound there are no smaller mounds, the area is ploughed and grey; the apparent dearth of sherds here may in part result from a process of sedimentation in the past from a now dry wadi channel, which flowed southwards before being diverted around the Area F mound.</page><page sequence="25">THE TELL AL-HAWA PROJECT 25 metres Fig. 8. Plan of the lower mounded area (Mounds C-X) showing collection areas.</page><page sequence="26">26 WARWICK BALL, DAVID TUCKER AND T. J. WILKINSON The ring of redeposited sediments around the foot of the main mound has the effect of isolating it from the lower mounded areas, although it is probable that stratified deposits exist below; it remains to be seen to what extent the grey soil areas in the fields beyond the outer edge of the lower mounded area conceal stratified deposits. Systematic sampling methods The extensive lower mounded areas were more suited to intensive systematic collection than the main mound, although even on the lower mounds several different types of surface had to be sampled. Considerable areas of the lower mounds were masked by redeposited sediments, particularly in that area close to the slopes of the main mound; elsewhere, vehicles had made numerous tracks, compacting some areas whilst reducing others to dust. A series of transects were aligned so as to avoid such problem areas and instead concentrate on some twenty-one high points (Areas C-J, L-X) within the mounded area (Fig. 8). These transects were aligned onto magnetic north, and each transect was divided into 20 x 20 m square sample units. Each square was walked east-west at least eight times in a period not normally exceeding fifteen minutes and all diagnostic sherds (rims, bases, decorations, handles), flints, obsidian, small objects, glass, figurines, etc., were collected. All oven fired bricks found within and close to the sample area were measured. In the southwest corner of each 20 x 20 m square, a 2 x 2 m square sample unit was completely stripped of all cultural material. All sherds were quickly washed and counts made recording sherd size and fabric on a simple matrix. From this sample, relative sherd densities could be compared across the site. A detailed description of the surface character of the 2 x 2m control sample forms the basic record for the larger 20 m square. A total of 5-6 hectares was sampled in the 140 large sample squares. The collection data for the lower mounded area is given in Appendix 2. Northern mounds Mound C covers an area of approximately 4 hectares, rising some 5-5 m above the plain. To the south the modern village limits the area of investigation; to the west is an area of sedimentation in a shallow depression dividing Mound C from the main mound and Mound D to the northwest. Mounds D and E are a pair of mounds, their summits ca. 170 m apart. Mound D is a broad oval area 3-5 m in height covering approximately 4 hectares. To the south are the lower slopes of the main mound, much of which is probably material washed down from the slopes, and to the west is Mound E. To the north and west the slopes are gentle, dipping down to the plain. The area was ploughed when sampled, and sherds from all three mounds were scarce and abraded. Overall, the pottery from the sample squares suggests that the main periods of occupation were Akkadian and Khabur, though an earlier presence cannot be ruled out; lithics may also indicate a prehistoric presence. There was very little evidence for later occupation. Southwestern mounds Mound F covers an area of approximately 4 hectares and rises to a height of ca. 3-5 m. To the northwest, west and southwest the limits of the mound were defined by the bed of a dry, very shallow wadi. The entire area was ploughed and well weathered when collected, and many sherds were visible on the surface. Mound G is much lower and more indistinct. It was heavily rutted by vehicle tracks which dug deep into ashy topsoil layers. The sampled area was restricted to the west of the mound, which provided a consistent evenly ploughed surface. The earlier Islamic material dominates the assemblage in almost every sample square. Mound J is perhaps more strictly a spur of the main mound,</page><page sequence="27">THE TELL AL-HAWA PROJECT 27 rather than a part of the lower mounded area, and some of the sherds on its surface undoubtedly derive from slope wash from the main mound. The sampled area was unploughed and compacted. There was a quantity of brick and rubble on the south slope of the spur. Mound X is a prominent oval mound lying adjacent to the hollow way route opposite Mound F, producing mainly Khabur material. Southern mounds There was no evidence for Assyrian occupation, nor for any occupation earlier than the mid-3rd millennium on Mound G. Mounds H and I are small and low, with the summits compacted by a track, but adjacent rain-washed surfaces were densely covered with sherds dominated by earlier Islamic types. Mounds U, V and W are very slight mounds occupying the more level area between Mound G and the slopes of the main mound. Mound V had traces of red sandstone wall footings, and both Mounds V and W produced large amounts of earlier Islamic pottery, contrasting with Mound U which was predominantly later Islamic, with a virtually complete absence of earlier Islamic types. Mound L, the southernmost mound of the site, is isolated from much of the rest of the site by the main hollow way route. It has a good 3rd millennium sequence followed by Islamic occupation. In Squares 72-74 on the unploughed summit, sherds were dense. Square 72 was notable for the large quantities of Northern Akkadian sherds?including some wasters and slag, suggesting a nearby kiln? which were upcast from an adjacent machine cut. This machine cut as well as the high erosion of the slope next to the hollow way route was probably responsible for exposing the very large quantities of Ninevite 5 and Northern Akkadian sherds on Mound L. Squares 75-77 were in the ploughed areas on the very edge of the mound. Some 30 m to the south was a large machine-dug pit which may have been the source of much of the redeposited soil on top of the main mound. Southeastern mounds Mound M, at 6 m in height and covering an oval area measuring approximately 130 x 100 m, is the most prominent of the lower mounds. A recent track crosses the flat summit area, exposing two separate areas of brick and rubble some 65 m apart. It is possible that these remains?an unusual feature for Tell al-Hawa?may represent walls retaining the flat summit area. The mound was unploughed and consequently surface visibility was excellent. The steep south slope produced much obsidian and the bulk of the Ninevite 5 material from the mound; the gentler north slopes, where visibility and consequent recovery was poorer, produced mainly Islamic types, with Ninevite 5 and later 3rd millennium material conspicuously absent. Just 20 m to the west of Square 123 however, a machine cut exposed a wide variety of Northern Akkadian types (Ml; see appendix 2, p. 50). Mound O, a small prominence ca. 30 m in diameter adjacent to the hollow way route, had some oven fired bricks on the summit. On Mound N, a small, oval mound, Square 81 included some recent refuse from the modern village. As well as some modern glass, pottery and other recent debris, this refuse contained an Uruk pierced lug bowl, indicating a presumed Uruk presence underneath the village. Other single, isolated sherd occurrences elsewhere on the site might also be the result of secondary re- distribution. The mound was otherwise densely covered in later Islamic sherds. Mound R was densely covered in many coarse wares typical of the later Islamic cooking wares. Pottery from the surfaces of Mounds S and ? belonged mainly to the later Islamic period, but some Uruk material was found in upcast from a machine cut, providing a "window" onto the earlier phases of the lower mounded area. At Mounds ? and Q the presence of Uruk?or earlier?material is suggested by large quantities of flint, obsidian and coarse undiagnostic cooking ware in Squares 94 and 95. The lithics were denser here than anywhere else on the lower mounded area. Otherwise, the pottery suggests occupation from the Uruk to Khabur periods, with insignificant later Assyrian occupation. Later Islamic material, though clearly in evidence, is less dense than on mounds to the southwest, so the Islamic occupation is presumably petering out. The "grey" area The area beyond the mounds of Tell al-Hawa has, for a distance of some 500 m, a lower density of sherds than the mounds themselves and the field scatters beyond this zone. This has been discussed in Part 1 above. In addition, an area of 50-100 m beyond the edge of the mounds is a distinctive grey colour which gradually gets browner as it becomes more distant from the site. It remains to be seen if</page><page sequence="28">28 WARWICK BALL, DAVID TUCKER AND T. J. WILKINSON stratified deposits survive beneath these grey soils on the plain; certainly this area is more vulnerable to agricultural erosion, but it may also result from sedimentation and the degradation of soils by sheep trampling around the settlement. Within the grey area that rings the site are two areas, K1/K2 and Y, that were investigated. Area Kl was an approximately circular depression some 30 m in diameter which contained a scatter of oven fired bricks, a waster, and at least fifty lumps of kiln slag. All the sherds were heavily concreted, which was unusual; they probably date from the late 3rd millennium, though no good parallels are known for these sherds. Fifty metres away, K2 is a second, though ill-defined, depression some 15 m in diameter, containing a scatter of oven fired bricks but no wasters or substantial quantities of slag. The few associated sherds are probably Islamic. Area Y to the northwest of the site was visible as a grey patch, heavily ploughed and barely 1-5 m high. This isolated grey patch may be a "window" on the grey zone surrounding the site, suggesting that the site may extend significantly beyond the mounded area. This is further suggested by Trench LP (see Part 3 below), which although off the visibly mounded area, still contained earlier Uruk material 1 -40 m below the surface. This material may derive from a wadi or channel, and not be directly related to the occupied area; nevertheless, test pits in the grey area surrounding the tell need to be made before firmer conclusions can be drawn. The topographical development of the site Of the collected "diagnostic" sherds 4300 were sorted where possible into approximately 130 "types" or "groups", which were regarded as diagnostic indicators deriving from the Halaf to Later Islamic periods (see Appendix 2). The distribution of these "types" or "groups" has been used to plot areas of occupation on the site at specific periods (see Table 2). Halaf {6th millennium b.c.). Fig. 17: 1-3 Only three Halaf period sherds were collected during the survey (though five more, as well as one definite Hassuna sherd, were collected from the surface in the 1987/88 season). They all came from a restricted area on the south slopes of the high tell (B141, 145 and 153). Although found at the foot of the main mound, this is still quite high above plain level, suggesting a mound of indeterminate size of the Halaf period, perhaps congregating around a water source. Ubaid sherds are also found in the same area, though the distribution is much wider. Ubaid {5th millennium b.c.). Figs. 9; 17: 4-21 The main Ubaid category (Type 50?see Appendix 2 for this and all other pottery types) included body sherds and rim sherds; no base sherds were recognized (unpainted fabric types were not regarded as diagnostic in surface scatters). The distribution of sherds on the slopes of the main mound is dictated by the location of vulnerable erosion surfaces. Wherever the lower stratified slope areas have been exposed, Ubaid period pottery has been found. Thus there is good evidence for a primary Ubaid settlement at least as large as the base of the present tell, although the evidence seems stronger on the southern rather than perhaps the northern edge of the main mound. The majority of the painted Ubaid sherds were found on the slopes of the main mound (93%) and derive from unstrati??ed slope wash. Beyond the main mound Ubaid sherds are few and far between; only Area X (with 4 sherds) probably has occupation levels. Only five other sherds come from the lower mounded area; alone</page><page sequence="29">THE TELL AL-HAWA PROJECT 29 u E? d : 11 ? &lt;3 d a ^ ?I ?*, ? R *?. ^ "S ? S ? ?S s-i ? X I ? I I I I ?

However, two sherds from 167 on the south edge of the site, and one from Q96 on the eastern edge of the site, may derive from an occupation level that is basically undisturbed and deeply buried over much of the site. It is perhaps significant that Uruk sherds appear in similar positions on the edge of the site suggesting that here, as on the east facing slopes of the high tell, erosion at the tell edge is exposing this earlier material. A machine cut in Square ?109 produced an Ubaid sherd, although unlike the sherds from Mounds I and Q, it was not associated with quantities of obsidian. A single Ubaid sherd came from Square D5; single sherds in any context are rather suspect, and in this and other instances are insufficient evidence alone for the plotting of occupation areas. Surface evidence suggests the Ubaid occupation is restricted to the area of the main mound, although a few sherds on the edge of the site (Mounds I and Q) may hint at peripheral occupation areas when associated with lithics. The primary area of settlement, some 15 hectares, is based on the distribution of Types 50 and 51. Northern Uruk {4th millennium b.c.). Figs. 9; 18-20; 21: 1-20. Although there is a good range of Northern Uruk material, it is not evenly distributed around the site: less than 5% comes from the lower mounded area while 50% comes from the middle slopes of the eastern side of the main mound. This included a considerable number of complete profiles. The Tell al-Hawa assemblage is predominantly vegetable-tempered, with the more sandy "Late Uruk" wares and forms so characteristic of many of the Saddam Dam sites conspicuously almost absent. The later Uruk material that was found, including bevelled rim bowls, was largely restricted to the main mound. It is expected that the Uruk period at Tell al- Hawa will be sub-divided more precisely after more detailed assessment of the pottery. At present much of the Uruk material, including that excavated in Trench LP (see below, Part 3) seems to be predominantly earlier Uruk rather than later. Trench LP might appear to be isolated from the rest of the Uruk areas on the site, but it must be emphasized that almost all the Uruk material collected from the site comes from eroded areas: most comes from the slopes of the main mound (AreaB), and it is significant that 12 of the 38 Uruk sherds from the lower mounded area were found at the edges of mounds in places most vulnerable to erosion (166, 079, Q94/ 95, R105, Ml 19, S), so its absence from uneroded areas elsewhere may only mean that it is obscured by later overburden. There are suggestions of an earlier Uruk presence on Mounds P, Q, R, S and T; Mound ?Hn particular has a large quantity of flint and obsidian eroding from its eastern slopes and coarse "Uruk-like" sherd fragments collected from the sample squares. The small amount of Islamic over- burden made the earlier material more visible here. In Mound ? too, whilst there was considerable overburden of Islamic material, earlier Uruk material was found in the spoil of a machine cut. Mound S was defined by a brownish soil that may also have been upcast from digging, and here four earlier Uruk sherds were found (Types 21, 104, 114, 115). Another sherd from upcast soil was found in Mound M, again suggesting that the earlier Uruk component is masked by later Islamic occupation. The areas to the north of the main mound (Mounds C, D and E) have little evidence of occupation following the Khabur, thus a masking effect by later periods</page><page sequence="32">32 WARWICK BALL, DAVID TUCKER AND T. J. WILKINSON would seem to be an insignificant factor when discussing the absence of earlier Uruk material on these mounds. However, field conditions were poor and the sample squares had low densities, with less than 30% of the collected sherds being attributable to specific periods, so Uruk occupation underneath cannot necessarily be ruled out. In addition, Trench LP at the eastern edge of Mound C contained at least a metre of earlier Uruk deposits and a near complete profile of an Uruk bowl was found at Mound ? (Square 81) amongst some refuse from the modern village. Clearly therefore, the surface evidence for these earlier periods, which may only be exposed by erosion, is not so reliable at Tell al-Hawa. For the subsequent, post- Uruk periods however, erosion does not seem to have had so great a determining role on visibility, so the surface evidence is much more reliable. With these limiting factors in mind, the minimum primary area of earlier Uruk occupation can be put at approximately 33 hectares (Fig. 9). If one includes Trench LP as a part of the settlement however, and not merely an isolated incident, then an occupied area of approximately 50 hectares can be postulated. This known distribu- tion of sherds and mounds would suggest a large Northern Uruk town with a citadel on its northwestern corner, of a similar area to the modern mound and perhaps only 6 m lower: a massive Uruk citadel/acropolis therefore, with a town at its foot stretching to the east, southeast and south. The settlement area in Fig. 9 is based on the distribution of Types 20-29, 70 and 101-114. Ninevite 5 {earlier 3rd millennium b.c.). Figs. 9; 21: 21-43. Diagnostic Ninevite 5 sherds were predominantly grey fine wares. Those sherds that were decorated had decoration only on exterior surfaces, and decoration did not extend to the base. The distinctive solid pedestal bases were often found in a battered condition, but they survived well in the ploughsoil. In general, the Ninevite 5 grey wares are highly distinctive in both fabric and decoration, making them ideal diagnostics for survey. Only 5 painted Ninevite 5 sherds were found, all from areas associated with unpainted Ninevite 5 pottery (slopes of the main mound and Mounds F, O; see Roaf and Killick 1987). Unlike the distribution of Uruk and earlier material, which is principally dictated by the elements of erosion, the Ninevite 5 material is more evenly distributed in those areas where it does occur, even in areas with much later (e.g., Islamic) occupation. This would suggest that later occupation does not significantly obscure areas of Ninevite 5 occupation. On the eastern and southern slopes of the main mound it is extremely sparse (only 12 sherds in 93 collection areas), which does not reflect sustained occupation. However, on the southern mounded area Ninevite 5 sherds are more conspicuous (Mounds I: 10, L: 36, M: 22, Qj 21, R: 5 and V: 4), suggesting that the primary area of occupation of the preceding Uruk period had shifted from the main mound. To the west, Mound F has a slight but distinctive Ninevite 5 presence. To the north, 5 sherds unsystematically collected in a cluster between Mounds D and E might be significant and relate to sherds collected on the northern slopes of the main mound (in B35-45). Outlying single occurrences (e.g., in C138 and Dl) have been ignored for the purposes of estimating the Ninevite 5 occupied area. The primary area of Ninevite 5 settlement therefore, appears to be to the south</page><page sequence="33">THE TELL AL-HAWA PROJECT 33 0 100 200 300 m 0 100 200 300m Fig. 9.

Secondary areas include Mounds F and X to the west, and tentatively Mound E and the adjacent areas on the northern slopes of the main mound, some 11 hectares. The main mound must be regarded as a minor area of perhaps some 18 hectares with sparse occupation. Given the scarcity of Ninevite 5 sherds on the eastern slopes of the main mound and Mound C, it seems unlikely that it extended under the modern village. This gives a total maximum area therefore, of 42 hectares of occupation. The settlement area in Fig. 9 is based on the distribution of Types 40-42, 44, 45, 47 and 48. Later 3rd millennium b.c. {'Akkadian'). Figs. 9; 22; 23: 14-33. Five types occur widely over the entire area of Tell al-Hawa, and three of them are distinctive bases (Types 52, 53 and 56). The green fabric type (55), often of thick storage jar sherds, often with bands of incised and combed decoration just below the rim, was very distinctive and usually survived well except in those areas (Mounds C, D and E) north of the main mound (the apparent low density of sherds of this period here must be considered against the poor (20%) diagnosis of sherds collected). Amongst the group of fine wares for this period (Type 90), the classic "Taya" fine wares common to other sites of this period in northern Iraq (Reade 1982: 74; e.g., Tell Abu Dhahir) were conspicuously poorly represented, with no incised examples. The material grouped as Type 91 includes some incised and fenestrated stands (from Mound L). In Square L72 a range of types (52, 53, 55, 56 and 91) were found clustering together in a concentration which formed 23% of the total number of sherds of their period from the lower mounded area. The sherds described above occurred in 61 % of the sampled lower mounded area, including Area ? (where they perhaps derived from a kiln) and Area Y some 200 m beyond the northwestern edge of the mounded area. On Mounds L, ?, ?, ?, ? and V broad ranges of types occurred; this diversity was coupled with the better condition of the sherds?perhaps implying that the southern mounds were a more important area? The sherd distribution suggests that the main mound, the northern mounds (above the 364 m contour) and the southern mounds (above the 362 m contour) were occupied, a total area of approximately 66 hectares. The settlement area in Fig. 9 is based on the distribution of Types 52, 53, 55, 56 and 91. Khabur {early 2nd millennium b.c.). Figs. 10; 23: 1-13; 24. Distinctive for this period are the familiar stripy-painted sherds (Types 58 and 59, both frequently belonging to similar types of medium jar). These painted vessels often have a channel base (Type 57, though it is uncertain how good a diagnostic feature this is). The storage jar type with raised "U" band cordons (Type 62) may, like the channel bases, have origins in the late 3rd millennium. The finer painted sherds (Type 64) were scarce; a notable concentration occurred on the upper south slopes of the main mound, so perhaps these are more linked to the mid-2nd millennium Nuzi goblets, merely lacking the white paint (or even akin to the Middle Assyrian fine beakers: Type 33). The painted sherds (Type 64), channel bases (Type 57) and pie-crust pot-stands (Type 65) were not considered when plotting the Khabur occupation areas.</page><page sequence="35">THE TELL AL-HAWA PROJECT 35 On the lower mounded area 54% of the sample squares produced Khabur types. This distribution was generally similar in extent to that of the preceding period, though notably scarce in some areas (especially Mounds G, H and I) and generally less dense, except on Mound J. On the main mound, owing to the abundance of Khabur ware (especially Types 58 and 59), only good profiles or single examples from a context were collected; concentrations were merely noted. When the detailed breakdown of late 3rd millennium and Khabur types is complete and the extent of their overlap is realized, perhaps a different picture will emerge. But the present evidence indicates a shift back to the main mound and a much more uneven settlement on the lower mounded area. The result is a primary area of sustained occupation on the main mound (17 hectares), a secondary area on the lower mounds (17-56 hectares), and additional minor areas on the lower mounds perhaps extending up to 66 hectares. The settlement area in Fig. 10 is based on the distribution of Types 58, 59, 61-63 and 66-68. Mitannian {mid-2nd millennium b.c.). Fig. 25: 1-5. On the basis of a single distinctive white painted "Nuzi" type, there is insufficient evidence for a Mitannian presence at Tell al-Hawa. At the time of writing, no other good diagnostic types to distinguish the Nuzi period from the preceding Khabur and succeeding Middle Assyrian periods could be defined. However, all the Nuzi sherds were found reasonably close together on the eastern slopes of the main mound below the high south end. It is of interest that four of the fourteen fine painted "Khabur" sherds from the site also occurred in this same area (Type 64). Other knob and stump pedestal beaker bases may also belong to this period, though these have later Assyrian connections. It may be that the Nuzi material is more likely to be found in those areas with Middle Assyrian material than with the preceding Khabur pottery. The anthropomorphic pottery face (from J125, Fig. 12b, PI. Ilo) may also belong to this period. Middle Assyrian {late 2nd millennium b.c.). Figs. 10; 25: 6-30. Although Middle Assyrian sherds were rarely decorated, they have distinctive features on a range of forms which make them easily recognizeable. The pottery is predominantly plain, in pale buff/yellow shades with a coarse vegetable temper which tends to give the sherds a distinctive surface of vegetable impressions. Some forms, notably Type 32 and less often Type 31, have occasional white grits. On the main mound Middle Assyrian sherds are concentrated on the east, a pattern confirmed by the subsequent excavations. The relative scarcity of Middle Assyrian sherds at the northern end may be due to the presumed thicker Late Assyrian deposits covering this area. Only Mound F on the lower mounded area has traces of Middle Assyrian material (Types 31, 34, 35, 36 and 39). The major area of occupation is restricted to the summit area of the main mound (12 hectares), particularly to the east, with a secondary area at Mound F extending over some 2-5-3 hectares, making a total of 15 hectares for this period. The settlement area in Fig. 10 is based on the distribution of Types 31-39.</page><page sequence="36">36 WARWICK BALL, DAVID TUCKER AND T. J.

Figs. 10; 26: 1-31. Late Assyrian pottery from Tell al-Hawa does not appear to be especially distinctive. The Late Assyrian presence is concentrated on the high north end of the main mound, an area where 66% of all Late Assyrian material was found. To the east, south and southwest, the Late Assyrian sherd distribution became sparser. However, at the high eastern end of the main mound three fragmentary, probably Neo-Assyrian sikk?tu were found (see Fig. 13 and Appendix 1 ) within a distance of 30 m from each other, suggesting perhaps that important administrative or religious structures were built in this commanding position at this time. On the lower mounds, sherds were found on Mound F (as in the preceding period), though often other single occurrences were recorded in widely scattered areas (Mounds E, H, L, O, P, U, V, X and Y). Sherds classed as possibly "general Assyrian" (Type 78) are clustered on the southern mounds (50% in Mounds U, V and W). In addition, some sherds and oven fired bricks may hint at a presence in the vicinity of the hollow way route (Mound O). An elbow fibula probably from this period (Fig. 12c) was found on Mound C. The occupied area may not have been too dissimilar from the Middle Assyrian occupation, except that the main occupation had shifted from the eastern end of the summit to the northern end. This gives a primary occupation area of 12 hectares on the summit, and a secondary occupied area, possibly related to the routeway, of 3-5 hectares on Mound F, together approximately 15 hectares. The settlement area in Fig. 10 is based on the distribution of Types 71-76. Partho/Roman {early 1st millennium a.D.). Following the Late Assyrian period, there appears to be a major break in occupation. At the time of writing, distinctive diagnostic pottery of the Median and Achaemenid periods was not well enough known to permit the recognition of an Achaemenid phase. No Hellenistic pottery was recognized at Tell al-Hawa, though it occurred on a number of sites in the surrounding area (see Part 1 above). Distinctive diagnostic types for the Partho/Roman and Sasano/Byzantine periods are also poorly known. Several stamped sherds, possibly Partho/Roman, have been found on the lower mounded area, which together fall into a reasonable cluster (Areas F38, F28, VI13 and W117). One additional sherd from the east side of Mound F had an impressed diamond stamp and rocker pattern, typically Parthian (Fig. 26: 33). Attention, however, must be drawn to the fact that the cluster of stamped sherds falls entirely within the area assigned to the Sasanian-Early Islamic occupation. It remains to be seen to what extent these stamped sherds also occur in this period. Whilst "brittle ware" (Type 16) was present, it must be noted that this ware also occurs in the Early Islamic period. Some kind of Sasano/Byzantine presence is hinted at, though such material could derive from activity along the main hollow way route and from temporary habitation rather than permanent occupa- tion. Like the distinctive but elusive white-painted Nuzi sherds, single diagnostic types are not a sufficient basis to determine the nature and exact extent of occupation. Sasanian-Early Islamic {c. a.d. 250-750). Figs. 10; 26: 40-56 The "Islamic" period is here divided into an earlier (incorporating broadly the</page><page sequence="38">38 WARWICK BALL, DAVID TUCKER AND T. J. WILKINSON Sasanian and Umayyad periods) and a later part (incorporating the Middle and Late Islamic periods). It is difficult to put finer dates than this for the "earlier" period, as there are few good parallels for the gritty-tempered group of sherds that make up the bulk of material for this period. However, of the two coins from the site, one comes from the "earlier" Islamic area (165) and may well be Umayyad; the other is from the "later" Islamic area (T109) and is a silver Ottoman coin. The gritty-tempered Sasanian-Early Islamic fabrics form a distinctive spatial group, concentrated on Mounds F, G, H, I, V and W; the areas immediately surrounding this concentration (Mounds L, O, N, U and X) together contain less than 2% of the gritty wares. The Sasanian-Early Islamic occupation area can thus be determined with confidence. It is interesting to see which sherds are found beyond the cluster: the turquoise glazed sherds (Type 4) are one such group and thus cannot be regarded as a good diagnostic type at present for the Sasanian-Early Islamic period specifically. Two sherds with gritty fabrics were occasional finds on Mound Y, a small mound to the northwest of the site just beyond the mounded area. Fragments of nine glass bowls (50% of the total found) came from the Sasanian-Early Islamic area (Mounds G, H, I and V) and three glass bracelets from Mounds F and X. In contrast, only a single glass rim but eight glass bracelets were found in the Late Islamic area (to the east of the main hollow way route). The Sasanian-Early Islamic settlement occupied a major area of at least 16 hectares, mainly to the west of the site, in the area west of the main hollow way route. The settlement area on Fig. 10 is based on the distribution of Types 1-17. Later Islamic {2nd millennium a.D.). Figs. 10; 27 At the time of writing it is not possible to distinguish the Late Islamic Ottoman from the Middle Islamic which is undoubtedly present. It is assumed that the Middle and Late Islamic settlements occupied similar areas to the east of the hollow way route. Of the sherds labelled broadly "Islamic" (Types 94-6, 121-6, 129 and 131), 98% occur in the area east of the hollow way route (Mounds L, M, N, O, P, Q, R and T, area K) or on Mound U just to the west, all areas within that covered by the better- defined Late Islamic types. These sherds therefore, might be considered Middle Islamic, though there is obviously an overlap to an unknown extent with the Later Islamic Ottoman period. It is hoped the divide will become clearer when compara- tive stratified material is studied. The characteristic fabric for these types is hard pale green. The subdivision of the handles is perhaps over-enthusiastic and could be simplified, but handles were particularly numerous as they survive well in the ploughsoil. The distribution of Middle/Late and Later Islamic Ottoman sherds differs perhaps significantly on Mound M, where the former types outnumber the latter two to one, whilst in all other areas the ratio is reversed. It is possible that this apparent anomaly is related to a larger, monumental building on Mound M (a caravanserai?) which has made this mound, at some 6 m above the plain, the highest of the lower mounds; traces of such a structure may exist in the two rubble lines 65 m apart exposed in the path of the deep track cutting across Mound M. The Later Islamic "Ottoman" wares, like the Middle/Late group described above, are concentrated in a relatively restricted area of approximately 8 hectares to</page><page sequence="39">THE TELL AL-HAWA PROJECT 39 the east of the hollow way. Much of the coarse chaff-tempered fabrics belonging to the later part of this period can occasionally be confused with the early prehistoric coarse fabrics. The Later Islamic material is concentrated in Mounds L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, ? and U, which contain 98% of all sherds diagnosed for this period; only eight sherds fall out of this area. The assemblage is characterized by roulette-decorated sherds (25%), often associated with finger-tip impressions on medium fabrics (not to be confused with the distinctive "honeycomb" ware of the Sasanian period). Finger- tip impressions are also found, occasionally with rouletting, on the coarse chaff wares and the rouletted wares together. The green glaze on a brown or reddish fabric is also very distinctive, and forms 28% of the assemblage. The settlement area on Fig. 10 is based on the distribution of Types 80-9. Part 3: The Excavations (W. Ball) It was not possible in the first season to open up any large areas for excavation, due to lack of workmen. Only selective soundings were carried out in two areas: Trench LP, in the lower area of mounds, and Area A, on top of the main mound. Trench LP: Uruk levels (Fig. 28) The first sounding, Trench LP, was a small sounding dug on the very edge of the lower area of mounds, some 400 m to the east of the main mound on the outskirts of the modern village (see Fig. 2). A record of the archaeological deposits was made by David Tucker. The trench measured 1-80 x 2-20 m and was excavated to a depth of l-45m, though virgin soil was not reached. The topsoil contained pottery, flint, obsidian, basalt and a small quantity of animal bone, though no structures were recorded throughout. Below ca. 70 cm of topsoil was a layer of grey, mixed ashy lenses resting on compacted, tenacious clay about 1 m below the surface. The ashy lenses and the lower part of the topsoil contained many coarse, shallow bowls (Fig. 28: 28) and steep-sided deep bowls (Fig. 28: 23-5), some fine brownish-grey obsidian blades and flakes (two retouched basal fragments of blades, one bladelet, and one long, slim, retouched blade fragment; I am indebted to Bettina Stoll for this information), and a fine, burnt clay sealing bearing an impression of a kneeling animal (Fig. 12a). The compacted clay probably represents an ancient surface of the mound, though more artifacts, including a crushed but largely complete double- mouthed jar (Pl. Ilrf; Fig. 28: 1), indicated that it was still an artificial deposit. The compacted clay continued about 30 cm, and overlay a 20 cm deep layer of less compacted, mixed debris containing some rather poor unpainted, mainly undiagnostic sherds. From a glance at the contour map of Tell al-Hawa (Fig. 2), it is apparent that this trench is on the very edge of the mounded areas of the site, yet it produced nearly 1-5 m of archaeological deposit. A small rubbish pit excavated 30 m to the west and a line of post-holes excavated around Trench LP failed to produce any Uruk material. These pits however, were not excavated deeper than 80 cm at most, so would not have reached the harder clay deposit found in Trench LP. Perhaps the apparent anomaly of the upper deposits of Trench LP can be explained by their being slumped along the edge of a gully, which has since silted up.</page><page sequence="40">40 WARWICK BALL, DAVID TUCKER AND T. J. WILKINSON The homogeneity of the material was notable, being wholly Northern Uruk There was an absence of painted wares, but grey/black burnished vessels (Fig. 28 32-41), reddish-brown coarse bowls (Fig. 28: 27-9), and hole mouthed jars (Fig. 28 1, 38-41) were popular and are closely paralleled at Gawra XI-IX (Tobler 1950 151-4). However, the seal impression is paralleled at Gawra VIII (Speiser 1935 PL LVII, Nos. 28, 29, 30). Earlier Uruk material (e.g., the double-mouthed jar? though this form occurs in the Ubaid period as well) was found in the compacted clay below the earlier mound surface. Trenches A21-A25: Khabur and Middle Assyrian monumental walls (Fig. 29) Surface finds included four wall-cones, three of them inscribed fragments (Fig. 13?see also Appendix 1). One of the prime objectives of this first season therefore, was to test for monumental structures. The limited workforce available led us to select Areas A21-25 on top of the main mound along the north-eastern edge overlooking the village (Figs. 2; 11). The side of the mound here has a very straight, level edge to it, indicating the probable existence of structures underneath. Of this area, Seton Lloyd (1938: 136) wrote in the thirties: "Near the summit of the NE flank a construction of Akkadian-type (large, slightly plano-convex) baked bricks projects". Today, there is still a very large, mud-brick mass eroding from the side of the mound about half-way along this edge. Two of the trenches, A22 and A23, were directly concerned with articulating these areas of mud-brick on either side of a gully Secondary wall TELL AL HAWA SPRING 1987 EXCAVATIONS Fig. 11. Plan of excavations in Area A.</page><page sequence="41">THE TELL AL-HAWA PROJECT 41 eroded in the side of the mound; two further trenches, A24 and A25, were to test whether these mud-brick masses continued northwards along the straight edge of the mound, and a fifth, A21, was a slit-trench aimed at relating these mud-brick masses to structures and/or occupation levels inside. The mud-brick masses in A22 and A23 when exposed proved to be sections of massive walls. That in Trench A23 (Wall 14) was particularly impressive, measuring some 4-70-4-80 m in width (Pl. lb). In Trench A22, on the opposite side of the eroded gully, the mud-brick wall (Wall 7) was smaller (approximately 2-40 m in width), and on a slightly different alignment to Wall 14. Since the gully had cut the ends of both walls it is not possible to determine their relationship, but the different widths and alignments seem to indicate that they are two separate walls. Fur- thermore, Wall 7 in A22 terminated in a straight edge to,the north, but was abutted by a later wall (Wall 46) at a slightly different alignment and different width again. In trenches A24 and A25 Walls 37 and 31 respectively were found. Neither of these walls, however, continued below a few courses. Construction was consistently of mud-bricks measuring approximately 38 x 38 x 10 cm (with variations up to 2 cm in any plane) throughout. The different alignments and widths of the walls suggest that we are dealing with at least three large buildings, rather than the single major encircling wall that the straight edge of the mound initially led us to assume. The secondary nature of some of these walls (46, 37 and 31) furthermore indicates at least two major building phases. Structures and occupation levels associated with these walls were very meagre. A23 had a possible fragmentary mud surface against the inside (western) face of Wall 14. A22 had two phases of mud surface associated with a possible thin mud wall (Wall 19) and stone door socket (which may have been re-used) on the western side of the trench. A21 had a few flagstones associated with a mud surface, though too far away to relate directly to any of the walls. A25 had a thick clay surface associated with a rebuilding phase of Wall 31. Nowhere was typical occupation debris found (ashy lenses, decomposed vegetable matter, bone, etc.) though such debris might in any case be out of place in a monumental area. The pottery included a wide variety of types, of which by far the most abundant were Khabur and Middle Assyrian. Whilst Khabur pottery occurred in varying degree throughout most contexts, it was generally found in the lower levels excavated. In particular, a collapsed section of Wall 7 contained almost exclusively Khabur pottery within its mud-brick, and most of the pottery within the fabric of Wall 14 was also Khabur. This included the characteristic types familiar from excavations elsewhere (e.g., Chagar Bazar?see Mallowan 1947), usually dated to the first half of the 2nd millennium (Fig. 29: 2-8). The later addition to Wall 7 (Wall 46) together with Walls 37 and 31 further to the north, had on the other hand a preponderance of Middle Assyrian types associated with them. All were fairly coarse, chaff-tempered fabrics, and included shallow bowls (Fig. 29: 10-12, 16-18), ribbed-neck jars (nos. 13-15), and "channel- bases" (no. 17). Conclusion The survey evidence suggests that between the 4th and 1st millennia b.c. the settlement pattern alternated markedly between phases of nucleation centred upon</page><page sequence="42">42 WARWICK BALL, DAVID TUCKER AND T. J. WILKINSON c</page><page sequence="43">THE TELL AL-HAWA PROJECT 43 Tell al-Hawa and phases in which the rural settlements became significant. This pattern can be compared with that found by Adams (1981) in southern Mesopotamia. There, settlements reached urban proportions by Uruk times and by the mid-3rd millennium b.c. urban centres had become numerous. Similar patterns of urban development have been recorded for Khuzistan (Wright and Johnson 1975), Tell Leilan in Syria (Weiss 1983: 47-9) as well as in southeastern Turkey (Marfoe 1986). Tell Taya, a short distance east of Tel'afar, also reached its maximum size during the second half of the 3rd millennium (Reade 1968: 236). It should be emphasized however, that no general conclusions regarding fluctuations from urban to rural communities should be drawn from the 1986/87 field-work results; the evidence is only relevant to a small area. Although the urbanized nature of the later 3rd millennium settlement pattern appears clear enough, the rural pattern of Hellenistic or Islamic times may have been peripheral to a more distant urban centre?Eski Mosul in the case of the Islamic period. The results presented here are therefore instructive at the level of the micro-region only; it is necessary greatly to increase the survey area in order to provide results of more general validity. Tell al-Hawa can now be viewed as a single, though major, element in a complex and changing pattern of human activity spanning some 9,000 years. The pattern described in the above report exists now in outline; the work of future seasons will fill in the details and provide a fuller picture of a hitherto neglected part of the ancient Near Eastern landscape.

Black) A total of four cuneiform texts have been found on the surface of the mound. (Several more were found in the 1987/88 season; these will be published in a future report.) The first, a tablet, was found during a preliminary reconnaissance of the site in spring 1986. Three more fragmentary sikk?tu texts were found during the systematic surface survey of the site the following autumn.</page><page sequence="45">THE TELL AL-HAWA PROJECT 45 45 1224 Fig. 13. Cuneiform texts from Tell al-Hawa. Scale 1:1. The tablet (Fig. 13) The tablet, no. 1224, was found in an eroded gully on the southwestern slopes of the main mound, just below Areas B208-209 (from where the tablet most likely eroded?see Fig. 7). It measured 3 x 3 cm and is inscribed with four lines of Babylonian cuneiform script on the obverse. The reverse is uninscribed. The text, a receipt, reads as follows: \ GU.?N a-na fgi??.apin?1 Ira?-ab?1-ki-nu na-di-in From this we learn that a man called ? x -k?nu paid half a talent, about 28-8 kg (presumably of silver), a considerable sum, for what may possibly read "a plough", by which probably an entire plough-team should be understood. It is very uncertain owing to damage on the tablet. However, the use of nadin "paid", instead of the standard Assyrian dialect form tadin, might possibly indicate, together with the handwriting, that the tablet had originated, i.e., that the transaction took place, in Babylonia. It is difficult to date it more precisely than between 1600 and 600 b.c.</page><page sequence="46">46 WARWICK BALL, DAVID TUCKER AND T. J. WILKINSON The sikk?tu texts (Fig. 13) The three fragments, nos. 43, 44 and 45, which were found on the slopes of the high south end of the main mound (Areas ?118, ?127 and ?138?see Fig. 7), are all pieces of sikk?tu, inscribed decorative ceramic objects which were inserted into the brickwork of walls, gates, temples and palaces in Assyrian-held regions from the mid- 2nd millennium until the end of the Assyrian empire. Sikk?tu from Ashur have been published by Jakob-Rost 1982: 137-77, and with a commentary and bibliography by Donbaz and Grayson 1985. They are also known from Nineveh and Kalhu (e.g., Grayson, ARI 11, Ashurnasirpal II, nos. 49-52) and a sikkatu of Assur-dan II (934? 12 b.c.) was found at Kakzu (modern Qasr Shemamok, see Grayson, ARI II: 80). All of these sites are capitals or provincial capitals. While an ancestry for sikk?tu can be traced both in the inscribed clay cones used in Southern Mesopotamia and in foundation deposits, especially in Isin/Larsa-Old Babylonian times, the Assyrian sikk?tu have a distinctive range of shapes and forms of their own. They are not invariably inscribed?indeed, a fourth sikkatu, complete but uninscribed, was also found on the surface of the mound (see Fig. 12e). On some the inscription is arranged in a series of concentric arcs running around the curvature of the object. No. 45 is of this sort. Others have the writing running straight across the curved surface in a series of parallel horizontal lines. Nos. 43 and 44 are both of this type, both exhibiting slight convexity of surface. Usually the sikk?tu are hollow and in both Nos. 44 and 45 it is possible to observe the concavity of the inner surface. No. 43 is only a surface flake and no inner surface is preserved. On none of these fragments is enough text preserved to identify the king in whose reign they were made. The only recognizable phrases are formulaic phrases typical of the inscriptions on these objects. No. 44 carries the broken beginning of a titulature which is that of a king whose name began with a theophoric element (not Assur-) and who was the son or grandson of a king whose name began Assur-. This might be Sin-sar-iskun (629-12 b.c.), but it is much more likely to be Shalmaneser III (858-24 b.c.). (This was confirmed by the find of a fourth fragment, with the name of Shalmaneser [III], in the second season in 1987. This will be published with further textual finds in a future report.) In general the script and phrases exhibited suggest a date from Shalmaneser III onwards for all three pieces, but an earlier date is not excluded. 45 ] ru ti ya sa1 [ dassur] ? diM ik-W-fbi-su i-s?-me-? ]-ri-sa-ni-ma i-s?-[ ]AN-e ?
