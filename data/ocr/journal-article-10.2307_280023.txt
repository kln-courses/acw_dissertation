<plain_text><page sequence="1">RepoRts A MISSISSIPPIAN PERIOD RITUAL CAVE IN TENNESSEE Charles H. Faulkner, Bill Deane, and Howard H. Earnest, Jr. Trailed and incised drawings on the mud-covered walls of an East Tennessee cave have been identified as the artwork of Mississippian Indians who visited this sanctuary about 800 years ago. These unique drawings, called "mud glyphs" because of their similarity to certain petroglyphs found in the southeastern United States, include abstract designs, symbols, zoomorphic forms and anthropomorphic figures. Symbols such as the forked eye and the "bird- man " anthropomorphic representation correlate with six radiocarbon dates on torch charcoal that range between the twelfth and seventeenth centuries A.D. The occurrence of thousands of superimposed elements on the walls indicates that Mud Glyph cave was a Mississippian period sanctuary and further suggests that certain southeastern caves during this period were used for ritual activities rather than for mining as they were during earlier Woodland and Archaic times. Five thousand years ago prehistoric Indians began exploring deep cave passages in the southeastern United States. Footprints found in soft mud and the charred remains of cane torches on the floors of caves in Kentucky and Tennessee indicate that these Late Archaic period cavers went thousands of feet into the perpetual darkness, penetrating as far as three miles in such systems as Mammoth Cave (Robbins, et al. 1981; Watson 1969; Watson, ed. 1974). While many of these trips appear to have been exploratory, the discovery of scraped and pounded mineral deposits, broken formations and quarried chert in these remote passages indicate that a major activity of these early aboriginal cavers was the extraction of mineral deposits. The numerous artifacts and food remains left behind by these prehistoric miners attest to repeated and prolonged underground visits. On the basis of archaeological evidence, this exploration and mining by prehistoric Indians in Kentucky and Tennessee reached a peak about 3,000 years ago. If we read the archaeological record correctly, by the middle of the Woodland period, about 2,000 years ago, this activity markedly decreased, and by the end of the first millennium A.D., when the spectacular Mississippian culture was emerging in the great river valleys of the Southeast, deep cave passages appear to have been virtually ignored or perhaps even shunned. This possible avoidance of caves by the Mississippian Indians has puzzled archaeologists, but the recent discovery of a unique form of Mississippian art in a cave passage in Tennessee sheds new light on the aboriginal use of caves during the Mississippian period in the southeastern United States. In 1979, Walter Merrill, an amateur caver, crawled beyond what appeared to be the end of a small cave in east Tennessee and finally reached an upper corridor with thick mud coating the limestone walls. This mud, still almost as soft as when it was deposited, was covered with trailed and incised drawings or "glyphs," some depicting animals and humans. The absence of modern graffiti suggested a prehistoric origin for these drawings and Merrill wisely kept his discovery secret until he could inform a professional archaeologist about the contents of this cave.

Map of glyph gallery (Redrawn by Terry Faulkner from the original by Jim Nicholls). confided in Howard Earnest, U.S. Forest Service archaeologist, who in turn contacted Charles Faulkner for assistance in studying and preserving this unique site. Initial visits to the site by Earnest, Faulkner and Bill Deane, a professional photographer, confirmed Merrill's discovery and under- scored the urgency in securing and studying the cave since word had leaked out in the local com- munity and the cave was now being visited by curiosity seekers and major damage to the floor and minor vandalism of the drawings had already occurred. The landowners were also concerned about the preservation of the drawings and cooperated fully in allowing an intensive study of the cave and a secure gating of its entrance. In January, 1982, a grant was received from the National Geographic Society for a preliminary study of "Mud Glyph Cave," a name used to protect its real identity and precise location. Research in the cave began in February, 1982, and was concluded in October of that year. The research was divided into three phases. The first was the complete mapping of all cave passages and an archaeological survey of the glyph passage floor to locate any cultural remains of the people responsible for the cave art. Assessment of the cave entrance indicated the unlikelihood of finding undisturbed aboriginal deposits. This conclusion was based on the extremely small open- ing, recent disturbance from the storage of sweet potatoes by former landowners, and an examination of the spoil dirt and profiles of a recently dug vandal's pothole which revealed no cultural material. Second, after the mapping and survey phase was completed, a photographic record, consisting of 323 35-mm black-and-white negatives and 323 35-mm color slides, was made of the walls of the glyph gallery. These photographs were tied to permanent datum points established during the survey. The cave entrance, other cave passages, and researchers at work in the cave were also photographed. The third and last phase of research involved visits by several archaeological consultants with expertise in cave archaeology and the art of primitive peoples. 351</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figure 2. Section of cave wall showing several parallel deep strike marks from a club or staff in the foreground and superimposed meanders and rectilinear designs in the upper right portion of the ledge (scale increments 2.5 cm). Mud Glyph Cave has a total length of 530 m with the glyph gallery situated 120 m from the entrance. To reach this gallery, one must enter the cave through a small opening (ca. 0.75 m x 0.75 m before gating) and proceed through a stoop and crawlway to the first "keyhole" which leads to a narrow slanting passage above the permanent stream which issues as a large spring below the cave mouth. At the end of the slanting passage one must negotiate a second keyhole into the stream passage. Forty meters down this large walking passage is a mud bank with cut steps leading to the upper glyph passage (Figure 1). The lower stream passage continues for another 137 m below and beyond the glyph passage before a siphon is reached, ending the aboriginally explored portion of the cave. Another 80 m of cave beyond the siphon was explored as far as a terminal rock breakdown by members of the research team who swam through the siphon. They found no evidence of aboriginal traffic in this passage. Available evidence indicates that the Indians entered the cave and reached the glyph gallery by the same entrance and passages as we do today, although it is possible that the lower stream passage may have been more open near the entrance and the aboriginal cavers may have been able to by- pass the keyholes and narrow slanting passage. Recent silt deposits on the stream passage walls and ceiling and observation of fluctuating water levels during our research indicate that the lower stream passage commonly floods to a depth of 3 m and more during periods of heavy rainfall. Unfortunately, this flooding has destroyed all traces of prehistoric traffic in this portion of the cave. Despite the occasional flooding, however, the cave would have been easily accessible during most of the year with a minimum of stooping and crawling to reach the glyph passage. The aboriginal cavers would have had to expend some effort to reach the passage and carry in fuel for light, but compared to the exploits of Late Archaic and Early Woodland cavers in such systems as Mammoth in Kentucky it would have been a very easy trip. 352 [Vol. 49, No. 2, 1984]</page><page sequence="4">REPORTS The glyph passage was apparently formed by the same stream action that is occurring in the lower passage today (Figure 1). As water filled the passage over an unknown period of time, a fine silty clay was deposited on the walls, reaching a thickness of 10 cm in some areas. The water eventually receded, with the stream being confined to the lower passage, never to flood the glyph passage again. A very high humidity and constant temperature in the cave kept this veneer of mud soft and workable and provided a perfect medium for drawing by aboriginal visitors thousands of years later. The drawings on these clay covered walls have been called "mud glyphs" because of their similarity to petroglyphs pecked and and scratched on limestone and sandstone cliffs and rockshelter walls through- out the southeastern United States. The term glyph is used to mean a carved figure or drawing, and is not meant to imply any type of written communication. These drawings ae predominantly abstract designs and figures, although excision of clay plugs and impaction of the soft surface with poles or clubs have also marked the walls (Figure 2). A dark patina and cave dust cover the clay; when scratched, it exposes a light orange-brown undersurface. When first drawn, the glyphs must have been vivid in the flickering torchlight, but they are now subdued after hundreds of years of aging. Close examination of the glyphs indicates that they were draglyphs indicates that the end of a stick, probably river cane, which also served as torch material. The glyphs extend along both walls of the 96-m-long glyph gallery. They can be categorized into four groups: abstract designs; motifs that repeatedly occur on artifacts of the M ssippian period; zoomorphic forms; and anthropomorphic figures. The glyphs may number in the thousands since most suitable surfaces in the passage were covered with them; in many cases the trailed lines are extensively superimposed (Figure 2). Our preliminary study of the glyphs suggested that the distri- bution of the four categories is generally random throughout the glyph passage. That is, the glyphs represent a gradual accumulation of isolated drawings. However, on-going detailed studies of in- dividual and juxtaposed glyphs may reveal a methodological arrangement of certain motifs in specific areas of the gallery. For example, meanders and macaroni predominate near the entrance to the glyph gallery, and human faces and figures are more common near the end of the passage. On a high ledge (ca. 1.5 m) beginning at meter stake 76 on the left side of the gallery, a series of large figures flow across the sloping surface, possibly drawn from floor level with a long pole or by the artist being supported by assistants (Figure 3). No aboriginal footprints were found on the ledge. The most common abstract designs are the meanders or macaroni drawn with the fingers. Mar- shack (1975:89) has associated such serpentine designs in European caves with water ritual and mythology. Cross-hatching and latticework designs are also found. These designs may sometimes be components of large decorated units-i.e., huge human and animal figures that extend over a considerable portion of the wall. Originally included in this category were numerous scratch marks, thought to be possible ritual scratching of the cave walls by humans using an animal paw. However, subsequent examination of these marks by a cave zoologist indicates these are the claw marks of live raccoons, a common cave visitor even today. Identifiable Mississippian or "Southern Cult" motifs include the forked eye, mace, cross-in-circle, concentric circles, round suns with rays, rayed semicircle, and squares or rectangles that could be suns or copper plate representations (Phillips and Brown 1978; Waring and Holder 1945). The forked eye, fairly common to the human faces drawn on the cave wall, is a characteristic motif on Mississippian period shell and copper artifacts. However, the cross-in-circle is rare in the cave, and this is surprising considering its common occurrence in Mississippian period art in other media. The rarity of the cross-in-circle and the absence of such motifs as the bilobed arrow and monolithic axe could mean that the walls were decorated early in the Mississippian period when these motifs were not yet part of the cultural repertoire, or that their use was idiosyncratic and they were either unfamiliar or unimportant to the individual artists who decorated the walls of this cave. Zoomorphic forms include the snake or "serpent," owl, woodpecker, turtle and opossum. All of these animals are reproduced on Mississippian period pottery, shell gorgets, and/or copper plates. It may also be significant that the absence of major game (food) animals in this repertoire is consistent with other Mississippian art. Three different snake motifs are present: a Moundville-like winged serpent (left wall, meter stake 31), a Lick Creek-like snake motif on the high ledge (meter stake 75), and a horned serpent (right 353</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figure 3. Large human figure on high ledge. wall, meter stake 87). The latter appears to be a crude representation of the Uktena, a mythical Cherokee monster. The Uktena was said to be "a great snake, as large around as a tree trunk, with horns on its head, and a bright blazing crest like a diamond upon its forehead, and scales glittering like sparks of fire" (Mooney 1900:297). The Uktena resided in the Under World as well as This World and the Upper World in the Cherokee belief system (Charles Hudson, personal communi- cation 1983). The owl glyph is realistically drawn with feathered wings and tail and "horns" protruding from the head (left wall, meter stake 63). This could be the great horned owl or perhaps the long-eared owl which the Cherokee believe is a witch or avenger of breach of taboo (Witthoft 1946:379). Witthoft (1946:379) states that "The scream of the long-eared owl brings dread and terror to the heart of the conservative Cherokee, but the bird must not be killed." The other avian species has a long bill and a crest and probably represents the pileated or ivory-billed woodpecker (left wall, meter stake 30). The Cherokees believe the red-bellied woodpecker is a cunning bird, and it is the war symbol of these people (Witthoft 1946:380). Hudson (1976:130) suggests that the pileated and ivory-billed woodpeckers engraved on Mississippian shell gorgets may have had the same meaning. The turtle is particularly important in Cherokee myths about the Under World (Hudson 1976: 139). Two realistically executed turtles have been drawn on the walls. One on the left wall at meter stake 63 is unusual in that the body is formed by a circular plug cut from the clay with the head, legs and tail represented by radiating trailed lines. The other turtle is very naturalistic, and is associated with a rectangular human mask superimposed over a human footprint (right wall, meter stakes 55-56). The print is of the right foot of a person negotiating the narrow passage at this point by pushing his foot up on the wall. At some later time an artist used the heel print for the turtle's body and at the same time drew the accompanying mask with the same implement (Figure 4). The only mammal depicted in the cave is a crudely drawn opossum on the left wall at meter stake 93 which is believed to exhibit a defensive posture with an open, snarling mouth and the prehensile tail arched over its back. Being a four-footed animal, the opossum was not associated 354 [Vol. 49, No. 2, 1984]</page><page sequence="6">REPORTS Figure 4. Turtle and human mask superimposed over human footprint. with the Under World in the Cherokee belief system, but on the other hand it is an anomalous animal in that it carries its young in a pouch and is nocturnal. Hudson points out that anomalous animals were often singled out for special symbolic values by the Southeastern Indians (1976:139). The largest number of identifiable glyphs are the anthropomorphic figures; these range from naturalistic in style to simplistic, almost child-like caricatures. The simple anthropomorphic draw- ings include crudely executed moon-like faces, some with finger-poked eyes, pinched noses, and protruding ears (ear spools?); crescent-shaped facial profiles; and male and female stick figures. This category of abstract anthropomorphic motifs also includes the rectangular mask associated with one of the turtles and oval or pear-shaped faces, several with the forked eye, reminiscent of the shell mask gorgets found in the late Mississippian Dallas culture of the eastern Tennessee Valley. At least one stick figure is more realistic and appears to show some kind of ritual activity. A small male figure (ca. 30 cm high) with what appears to be exaggerated genitalia is depicted running with an upraised hand that is holding a mace or more likely a ball stick (Figure 5). His backbone, windpipe, or esophagus may be represented by a vertical line through the body. This suggests that the rep- resentation of certain internal organs and the identification of some figures as male or female by the genitalia was important in the rendering of these human drawings. This figure is located on the left wall at meter stake 70. One of the most naturalistic human figures is located on the right wall at meter stake 69. The figure is large (ca. 92 cm high) with well executed legs and feet, a knee-length skirt, upraised arms, and a head with a hair bun. A mask or skull (trophy head?) may be attached to the side of the skirt or may be a later superimposed drawing. This human figure is difficult to interpret since it is obscured by a palimpsest of superimposed curvilinear lines and gouging. Three additional naturalistic human figures depict the so-called eagle being (Waring and Holder 1945:Figure V) or bird-man (Phillips and Brown 1978:124) and the chunkey player (Phillips and Brown 1978:110), themes found on Mississippian shell and copper gorgets. One of the bird-men on the left wall at meter stake 60 has a realistic head with forked eye, lines radiating from the top 355</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Figure 5. Running male figure, possibly representing a ball player. of the head which may be a crude representation of a roach, and a hair bun. The body is only vaguely depicted, but lines streaming down the back probably represent feathers or wings. Another bird-man was drawn on the high ledge above the passage floor at meter stake 87 (Figure 3). This is a large figure (ca. 2 m) with a beak-like face (falcon mask?). The upper body and the arms are represented by simple lines; one arm is raised, the other is turned downward. Wavy lines descending from the shoulders probably represent feathers. Unfortunately, the downtumed hand and the lower body have been broken away from the ledge, possibly by recent vandalism. A naturalistic human figure occurs on the right wall at meter stake 66. This detailed figure has a crescent-shaped face with forked eye and a diamond-shaped body (Figure 6). A round object, possibly a shell gorget, is drawn on the chest. Armbands and bracelets are depicted on the arms. The right hand is upraised, the left is extended downward and is holding what is tentatively identified as a discoidal (chunkey stone). This is believed to be a representation of the chunkey player, a theme found on shell gorgets (Phillips and Brown 1978:110-112). 356 [Vol. 49, No. 2, 1984]</page><page sequence="8">REPORTS Figure 6. Chunkey player glyph. One of the most intriguing aspects of the aboriginal activity in Mud Glyph Cave is the deliberate mutilation of the drawings by the Indians themselves. Several of the glyphs were purposely defaced by smearing, gouging out the clay, or overdrawing. Fingers and fingernails were also poked into the soft clay. Many glyphs have small tick marks or scratches on them executed by the end of a sharp implement. The impressions of a club, staff, or possibly a mace handle are evident on several glyphs, including the mask and turtle. The butt end of this object left a round depression that measured 5.5 to 7.5 cm in diameter. The side of a bark-covered club or staff was also struck against the wall, leaving a bark impression that has been tentatively identified as hickory. The glyphs, charcoal scatter on the floor, smudge marks from cane torches on the walls, and occasional footprints are the only evidence of aboriginal visitations to the cave. A thorough survey of the cave floor produced no artifacts. The cave is too damp for the preservation of perishable items and apparently no stone or bone tools or ceramic containers were carried into the cave. This suggests the aboriginal visitations were of short duration. Unfortunately, the traffic by recent cavers before the cave was gated and studied erased all vestiges of any aboriginal footprints that may have been present down the center of the passage. Only a few partial prints were found to one side. Light for the prehistoric artists was provided by cane torches, possibly some pine torches, and at least one small hearth. The only extensively used hearth was in a small natural rock basin along the right wall near the far end of the glyph gallery (meter stake 86). Wood from hickory (Carya sp.), ash (Fraxinus sp.), and honey locust (Gleditsia triacanthos) was identified in a sample of hearth charcoal. Charcoal was concentrated along the edge of the trail down the center of the passage, 357</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Table 1. Radiocarbon Dates From Mud Glyph Cave.

Most of the charcoal appears to be cane (Arundinaria gigantea) from the residue of torches. Pine (Pinus sp.) charcoal is also found scattered on the floor and while it could be from pine torches, it is more likely the remains of small, single- event fires, the ashes of which were subsequently trampled along the cave floor. In the widest and highest portion of the glyph gallery, called the "fireplace room" (5 m x 5 m), considerable charcoal is present on the floor. Eight charcoal samples collected in the glyph passage were dated at the Radiation Biology Lab- oratory, Smithsonian Institution. These included two samples of soft and hard woods from the basin hearth along the right wall at meter stake 86 and five samples of cane charcoal and one of Pinus sp. charcoal from concentrations along both walls, some under specific glyphs. Samples of the carbon dioxide generated from the five cane samples were sent by the Radiation Biology Laboratory to Geochron Laboratories for C- 13/C- 12 analyses to provide corrections to the age calculations. The radiocarbon dates are listed on Table 1. The uncalibrated radiocarbon dates from the hearth and torch scatter indicate that prehistoric Indians may have occasionally entered Mud Glyph Cave during the Middle Woodland period and continued visiting this site as late as the eighteenth century A.D. However, since six of the eight radiocarbon dates fall between the twelfth and seventeenth centuries and correlate with Mississippian culture motifs found in the glyphs, it is believed that the intensive utilization of Mud Glyph Cave occurred during the Mississippian period, especially around the thirteenth to fourteenth centuries A.D. The extensively decorated walls in Mud Glyph Cave appear to be a virtually unique prehistoric art form in North America. Abstract symbols were drawn on a thin coating of mud on two areas of a cave wall in Virginia, but these symbols cannot be dated typologically nor has other evidence of Indian visitation been found in this cave (Bunnell 1979). In France and Spain, Upper Paleolithic artists decorated mud-coated cave walls with macaroni at such sites as Rouffinac (Marshack 1975) and stab-mutilated incised horses at Montespan (Sieveking 1979). However, this Upper Paleolithic art form is rare compared to the paintings and engravings on cave walls in Western Europe. It is unclear whether this rarity is due to the fragile nature of this art, which would not withstand erosional forces over a long period of time, or to the virtual neglect of such a medium for artistic expression 358 [Vol. 49, No. 2, 1984]</page><page sequence="10">REPORTS by prehistoric peoples, or simply to the fact that such art was practiced only in very confined geographical areas. Over 3,900 caves have been located and explored in Tennessee. It is significant that in none of these caves, many with ancient mud coated walls, have similar artistic works been discovered. Although mud glyphs have been found and reported in only two caves in North America, pre- historic petroglyphs on the rock walls of cliffs, bluff shelters, and cave entrances are common in several areas of North America including Tennessee and Alabama. Some of these petroglyphs in the Tennessee River Valley of northern Alabama include the same Mississippian period motifs found in Mud Glyph Cave, e.g., the cross-in-circle, suns, forked eye, serpent, and woodpecker (Henson and Martz 1979). However, despite the hundreds of miles of cave passages that have been explored by cavers and archaeologists alike in the Southeast, petroglyphs have been reported in only three deep caves in Middle Tennessee. One on the Cumberland Plateau has three petroglyphs (snake, sun, and spiral) on the ceiling, these possibly dating from the Terminal Archaic period ca. 3,000 years ago on the basis of radiocarbon dates for the mining acities that occurred in the same passage (Ferguson 1981). A cave in the Sequatchie Valley has scratched figures on a wall including woodpeckers, a bird-ma, mace, monolithic axe, and an unidentified animal. A Mississippian age is suggested for these glyphs. The third cave, which is located on the Eastern Highland Rim, contains geometrical petroglyphs at least 250 feet from the entrance in the dark zone. The cultural association of these geometric symbols is not known, but Woodland artifacts have been found inside the cave entrance (Henson 1982). One can tentatively conclude at the present time that that the prehistoric Indians infrequently decorated the walls of deep caves in the Southeast, despite the fact that these passages were often explored ad mined in the Late Archaic and Early Woodland periods. A careful examination of the passage walls and floor of Mud Glyph Cave revealed no evidence of mining by these aboriginal cavers. While the cave is too damp for the preservation of perishable artifacts, the absence of stone tools, pottery, and food bone also suggests that the Mississippian Indians who ventured back into the cave remained in the glyph gallery for only a short period of time. The presence of drawings such as the bird-man, chunkey player, woodpecker, and horned serpent (Uktena), which are forms found on southeastern Mississippian ritual objects, indicates that the cave was entered by the Mississippian people for ceremonial activity. The superposition of certain glyphs and the deliberate mutilation of other drawings by the Indians themselves suggest that sympathetic magic might have been involved in the ritual. Perhaps it was the act of drawing or the cancellation of the act that was important. The artist could gain power over a particular spirit by producing its image in the mud; however, such power could also be broken by mutilating (killing) it. It is also possible that these drawings may not represent simple pragmatic exercises in magic; rather, each one could be an element in a narrative story that covers the entire glyph passage. That some conscious order was operative in decorating the walls is suggested by the grouping of certain glyphs in the gallery. The first 30 m along the left wall and 55 m along the right wall are entirely decorated with straight lines and meanders before an animal or human form is encountered. Of the 27 human faces and full human figures recognized thus far, 18 are found in the last 27 m of the glyph passage. Four of five rayed suns occur between meter stakes 88 and 96 at the end of the gallery. One unresolved question is how many individuals were responsible for this ritual art. On-going research on the Mud Glyph Cave drawings will concentrate on motif elements in an attempt to determine whether they were created by one person over a lifetime or a number of persons over several generations. The large number of superimposed glyphs, the range of glyphs produced in the cave, and the radiocarbon dates argue for repeated visits over several generations. Nevertheless, the glyphs must be studied in detail before this question can be resolved. The Mississippian period ritual art in Mud Glyph Cave could also constitute the first evidence of a major change, after the Early Woodland period, in the meaning of deep caves within the aboriginal cognitive system. Caves were frequently visited by Late Archaic and Early Woodland cavers in the Middle South, apparently on a continuing basis. There is little evidence of cave ritual during these early periods. By the Middle Woodland period about 2,000 years ago, however, pre- 359</page><page sequence="11">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY historic mining and exploration in deep caves in the Middle South seem to have dropped off appreciably. An exception would be the use of some caves as burial chambers (Walthall and De- Jarnette 1974). Until the discovery of Mud Glyph Cavnte,il there was virtually no evidence that Mississippian peoples were penetrating the deep inner passages of southeastern caves. The art in this cave reveals that these people were also reaching deep underground passages, but the nature of their activities suggests that by 1,000 years ago the function of caves had changed and some had become ritual sanctuaries. Because of changes in conceptualization of the spirit world, caves may then have been viewed as awesome or even dangerous places, perhaps places of death or entrances to the underworld. The Southeastern Indians dians did believe that water sources and caves were entrances to the Under World (Hudson 1976:130). In this respect it is probably significant that four of the five animals drawn on the cave walls are associated with the Cherokee Under World. Water sym- bolism may also be represented by the meanders that predomiatte near the entrance to the glyph gallery. The artists who decorated the walls of Mud Glyph Cave eight centuries ago are probably the ancestors of the Indians now living in the Southeast. Thus, we intend to study the mythology and ceremonies of the Cherokee and Muskogean-speaking people in the area to determine the place of caves and of the underworld in their belief systems. In this way we hope to find clues for determining the meaning of the ancient art in Mud Glyph Cave. Acknowledgments.

Piperno Phytolith analysis in archaeology suffers from a lack of taxonomic data on silicified forms in plant domesticates and related wild species. This study presents the results of a comparative analysis ofphytolith size and morphology in maize (Zea mays L.) and wild grasses. Grass phytolith morphology is highly diverse. By combining the criteria of size and three-dimensional form of cross-shaped phytoliths, one can discriminate between maize phytoliths and those of wild grasses, including teosinte. This method for identifying archaeological maize was tested by analysis of samples from four sites in the Pacific watershed of central Panama. Phytolith spectra from deposits dated by radiocarbon to the early fifth millennium B.C. indicate the presence of maize. The interpretation of the phytolith data is supported by pollen studies. The analysis of phytoliths, microscopic pieces of silica formed within the cells of living plants, is a recent addition to archaeobotanical research in the New World (Carbone 1977; Lewis 1981; Pearsall 1978; Piperno 1983a, 1984a, 1984b; Robinson 1983). Since these mineral bodies are very resistant to destruction over long periods of time in soils, they have an enormous and largely untapped potential for ecological reconstruction. Increasing interest in the application of phytolith analysis has led to both a broadening of geographical areas open to phytolith examination and refinements in the procedures for processing and classification. Yet, as various authors have indicated (Pearsall 1982; Piperno 1983a; Rovner 1983), considerable baseline research remains to be carried out in order that the strengths and weaknesses of phytolith analysis in paleobotanical reconstruction may be properly delineated. A major current interest among prehistorians is the utility of phytoliths in demonstrating the presence of domesticated plants in the archaeological record, particularly in areas such as the humid tropics, where deposits are often inimical to the preservation of other plant material. However, there is at present very little information concerning the attributes and structural forms of silicified cells as those occur in major New World plant domesticates and related wild species. Between 1979 and 1982, a comparative phytolith collection was constructed for 20 tropical cultigens, including maize (Zea mays L.), manioc (Manihot esculenta Crantz), squash (Cucurbita pepo), pineapple (Ananas comosus), and arrowroot (Maranta arundiaceae L.) (Piperno 1983a, 1983b). The domesticate phytoliths were compared to phytoliths from over 300 species of wild Central American plants, in order to establish some preliminary notions about their taxonomic significance.
