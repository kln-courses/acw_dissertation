Architecturally, this new state has been compli- cated by the ambiguity of its spatial referents. Thus, for two decades now, the theoretical challenge has been to articulate the relation between the spatialities of the physical and those of the connected, the online, the virtual.1 Because architecture is concerned with the order of space, any characteristic pertaining to this emerging spa- tial paradigm will affect architecture itself; one such notion is the omnipresent avatar. In the following argument, I further propose that understanding the virtual might mean a disassociation from the idea of virtual space, and the nomination of the avatar as a key spatial metric to virtuality. To understand the virtual as a kind of space is a.practice that emerged during the early years of the internet, when- in an inertia of metaphors- references to computer connectivity abounded with terms suggesting spatiality, like information highway, surfing, cyberspace, and so on. Furthermore, such a perception is influenced by the modernist tradition of "space" as a category of the universal- whether in theocentric or anthropocentric theories. As a concept implying distancing, however, space has been thought of as abstract, vacant, indifferent, ubiquitous, infinite, and, most of all, impersonal. With the shift of spatial paradigms, marked by the presence of the avatar in online computer gaming, this has changed. If the category of the virtual is understood as spatial at all, then this space is first compartmentalized, and then infinitely and disparately multiplied: every avatar has a spatiality attached to it, propagated from distinct nuclei and untethered to external boundaries. Thus, every avatar becomes the generator of its own space, which is not only personal but- as I propose here- it is egotistical. Without a doubt, the human body has been a privileged measuring device of space throughout the history of architec- ture-from antiquity (Vitruvius), through the Renaissance (Leonardo and Alberti), to modernity (Le Corbusier).Figure1 While this proposi- tion is following its own course of historical formation, the avatar presents a new paradigm of referencing. Unlike its predecessors' instrumentalization of the body, an avatar is more than a physical or psychoanalytical measure of space- it becomes the originating code by which the body's spatial context is not only evaluated, but totally created. While the human body has undergone epochal stages of analysis, idealization, and standardization in its role as architec- tural measure, the "body" of the avatar is always unique in ways that disallow the same extent of "standardization." Humanist credo asserts that no two human subjects are identical, yet architec- ture's assumed space of the human figure- deduced from relative similarity in uprightness, range of height, and predictability of movement- has allowed anthropocentric measurement of architec- ture that is nearly universal. This universality lends architecture a certain stability, through systems of measurement and, ultimately, legibility in anthropomorphic terms. However, the avatar reverses this humanist logic. Avatar-Space P e ^</page><page sequence="3">User Perspecta 44 94 Until the late 1980s, the word avatar appeared exclusively in the context of Hindu myths and related discussions of incarnation. Avatar or avatãra, from the Sanskrit word for "descent," is used to describe the manifestation or appearance of an alternate body- often merging human and animal forms- through which a Hindu deity descends to earth.2 With an ever-increasing presence of references to extra-bodily experiences, the idea has been transported into literature and film. One of the pioneering virtual worlds, Habitat, released by Lucasfilm Games in 1986, specifically introduced the term avatar as the human body's virtual counterpart in a graphically presented social online community. The Habitat environment was conceived as a series of graphically described loci, each present- ing a comic-book-style two-dimensional scene, where humans could engage in conversation, scenery exploration, and goods exchange via graphically described alternate bodies, called avatars.3 Figure2 The avatar now became essential to the state of virtual being as the "embodiment" of the self. In direct correlation with the human figure and psyche, the avatar has henceforth been the key to the connec- tion between physical body and virtual fantasia, across a number of media. The idea of a split self whose double is dislocated into differ- ent realities has not evaded cinema- from the early Tron (1982) by Steven Lisberger to the recent Avatar (2009) by James Cameron, to the even more recent sequel Tron: Legacy (2010), whose direc- tor, Joseph Kosinski, is an architect by training. As evidenced in Avatar's lush jungle planet Pandora, the notion of an avatar is increasingly associated with an access to comprehensive Utopian "worlds," which these fictional avatars inhabit. While the concept of a "virtual world" is not directly linked to computing connectivity, its design tropes flourish in the digital domain. The term virtual world has itself emerged specifically in relation to massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs). Since the very early multiplayer computer games like Maze War (1974) to the current truly massively multiplayer worlds- where a title like World of Warcraft singlehandedly accounts for over 12 million monthly paying subscribers- the idea of what constitutes a virtual world has hardly changed.4 The players' surrogates (the avatars) appear within a context, presented graphically as a spatial virtual world, where these avatars interact according to the premises of the particular world's lore. Depending on the type of anticipated interactions amongst avatars, MMOGs are spread into game types such as role-playing, simulation, strategy, combat, and so on; depending on the graphical imagery, the worlds are further loosely divided into genres such as fantasy, science fiction, history, and more. Bound to an idea of spa- tiality, MMOGs rely heavily on representation and straightforward mimicry of familiar architectural referents. In fact, the architectural approach is often embedded in the conception stages of a world. For example, Habitat's creators describe: "The Habitat world is made up of a large number of discrete locations that we call 'regions.' In its prime, the prototype Habitat world consisted of around 20,000 of them. Each region can adjoin up to four other regions, which can be reached simply by walking your Avatar to one or another edge of 2 Stills from Habitat</page><page sequence="4">95 the screen. Doorways and other passages can connect to additional regions. Each region contains a set of objects which define the things that an Avatar can do there and the scene that the player sees on the computer screen."5 The fast adoption and eager utilization of a vast vocabulary of architectural terms such as doorways, passages, and edges in game design, as in this brief example, then further opened the field to the possibility of spatial interpretation.6 What makes MMOGs a particularly good domain to articulate the terms of virtual architec- ture, however, is the fact that their spatial tectonics are different from any other field. Furthermore, unlike earlier ideas about comput- ing and (non-online) computer games, the worlds of MMOGs do not stop existing when a user logs off and leaves the computer and the game. The graphical representation of online gaming environments persists- for pragmatic and economic reasons an MMOG cannot just be powered down.7 Now the virtual can no longer be used when needed and discarded when obsolete, but has become capable of constituting a self-sustained world. . Unlike the modernist notion of space as universal and simply "receiving" the subject, the space of virtual worlds is specifically constructed by and around its constituency of avatars. The avatar is pivotal to the definition of a virtual space in the process of represent- ing that space to the player. In other words, the protocol of spatial representation is established in terms of the supremacy of the avatar, and does not "exist" independently of the avatar. The supremacy of the avatar's body is so pronounced in MMOGs that while he or she is on a quest of conquering space and eliminating rival bodies, the avatar makes the conquered space his own. This action is not accomplished by the simple appropriation of preexisting space, or representations thereof, but by establishing metaphysical control over the entire game environment. In preparing for this spatial control, a player's first prerogative is the creation and articulation of his or her surrogate- the avatar. Avatars within a virtual world are socially predisposed to rivalry as they are divided by appearance- as belonging to different species, and by capability- and endowed with different proclivities. In addition to those faction-forming choices, most gaming environments allow hundreds of initial cosmetic embellishments that a player attributes to the avatar, which make it almost unique by its first appearance in the virtual context. The avatar's quest in a virtual world is often facilitated by the possession of objects, such as weapons, which are useful in warding off rivals, and also by the acquisition of special skills for controlling the physical properties of his environment- such as an ability to fly, turn invisible, teleport, and so on. Hence a consider- able portion of the avatar's significant virtù within virtual worlds is established in the moment of his or her creation; the avatar and its environment are mutually predetermined.8 For example, in World of Warcraft, by selecting an elf char- acter, the player's entry into the world is a forest, whereas a dwarf character is first introduced in a village. As the game's creators state: "Your choice here has an impact on what you can and cannot Avatar-Space Petit</page><page sequence="5">User Perspecta 44 accomplish in the world... Other content, such as the zones you can visit and the quests you can accomplish, are also organized by faction. Some quests can only be completed by Horde players and others can only be completed by Alliance players. Some zones offer cities and interactive NPCs for one faction, but are completely hostile to the other."9 As a further element of control, the spatiality of MMOG virtual worlds is only experienced as graphic output on flat screen displays. The framed image on the gamer's screen invariably portrays the avatar as a propagator of spatial representation, but primarily, as I argue, as an object of the gamer's desire. While the virtual whereabouts of an avatar might resemble or mimic physical space and architecture, the ultimate design problem of a virtual world is not one of spatial resolution, but rather of arousing the individual gamer's desires. These desires are expressed via the avatar's perceived control of space through its central position on the gamer's screen- at the expense of articulating a greater spatial enclosure or context.Figure3 This compositional structure affords players the oppor- tunity to document feats of achievement or victory as a Screenshot of their avatar in the midst of a graphically complex scene. The screen- shots are labeled as particular locations, recognizable by architectural referents; yet despite the possibility of providing a view without the centrally positioned avatar, the body is invariably present as a focus.10 While perspectivai vision is a precondition for gaming in an MMOG's virtual world, the avatar's actions and motions transform this precondition into the defining boundary of a spatial context. Walls, ground planes, and various thresholds form the contours of an enclosed environment for the figure of the avatar, who always remains the focus within this representational system. The centrality of the avatar to his environment is thus evidenced in the idiosyncra- sies of an MMOGs' representation of virtual worlds: 1 The avatar is always situated in the center of the screen, regardless of the perspectivai representational system used to attain illusory depth; 2 Space in the immediate vicinity of an avatar is over-defined by multiple orbiting views, at the expense of a more expansive gaming environment; 3 Space acquires new characteristics as a result of an avatar's acquired abilities, such as flight or teleportation, among many others. For example, if one's own avatar is adept at digital manipulations, as virtual worlds allow, it is quite possible to negate the rival's control of space by disguising oneself as environment- the more skillful elf can turn into a tree Figure4 amidst a forest and thus become invisible to the novice ava- tar, whose centrality within a homogeneous image of trees becomes meaningless. Such malleability of the spatial context under the influence of an avatar can diminish a less skillful rival avatar's control of space in what is commonly known as a PvE (player vs. environment) experience. 96</page><page sequence="6">97 Avatar-Space Petit 3 Player avatar positioned at the center of the gaming interface; still from World of Warcraft captured in 2009 4 Above: An encounter between two avatars, simultaneously captured on the computer screens of both players.

This connection between bodies is neither completely unidirectional, nor is it entirely reflexive: the gamer is interested in participating in the MMOG, and hence he or she activates the environment "on behalf" of the avatar; concurrently, the gamer's desiring gaze is consumed by the ava- tar's objectified body. While the reciprocity of the body in a virtual self inside the game creates conditions similar to Jacques Lacan's description of the mirror stage- where the screen image serves as the mirror and the avatar is the reflected self- the implications here are quite different. In Lacan's analysis, the child is perplexed and intrigued by the unity of the reflected image of his or her body, while her still imperfect control of moving limbs accounts for a disjointed self-awareness. The comparison between the disjointed and the totalized body in the child's mind, according to Lacan, is made pos- sible by the juxtaposition of the image of the self and the self against a static background of objects in the immediate vicinity of the play- ing child.11 In the case of the avatar, an awareness of disjuncture, or rather fragmentation, is not so much the result of the gamer's imper- fect control of the figure of the avatar (the surrogate "subjective I"), but of the relative unfamiliarity with the objects in the immediate vicinity of the avatar's body. Since the virtual gaming environment is not a reflection of the gamer's surroundings, but rather a supporting framework for the avatar's representation, the relationship between self and virtual self hinges on the opposition between the two bodies. In this exchange there is no static space against which oneness and fragmentation are in tension; rather, both bodies are in respective dynamic states. Hence, unlike the surrealist and cubist expansiveness of space, which is achieved through an imaginary bridging of gaps, virtual worlds present a spatial context that becomes fragmentary because of the exclusive focus on the body of the avatar.12 The centrality of the personal avatar and his or her control over space is so steadily maintained that even during encounters with rival avatars, or PvP (player vs. player) events, the control over the image remains in the gamer's hands. Unlike human bodies, avatars do not share space- they con- trol and own spatial representation in its entirety, impervious to other claimants' needs. Even in the presence of another player's avatar, the gamer will continue to observe, admire, and perceive his or her own other as the center of the image. Fiaure 5 Meanwhile rival bodies are pushed into the periphery of the image, radially away from the gamer's own avatar, as though contiguous with the gaming environ- ment.13 All other players' avatars are represented as peripheral, even subsidiary, within each view into the virtual world. This allotted control over the visual field, I argue, is concurrent with an egocentric control over the entirety of virtual space. While spatial control can be achieved in-game, egotistical architecture is a Utopian idea with consequences beyond the virtual; indeed, virtual worlds are metaphors for an already charged relation- ship between subject and environment. The different relationships Avatar-Space Petit</page><page sequence="9">User Perspecta 44 between avatar and game context, avatar and human player, and avatar and avatar are foundational to the proposed paradigm of virtuality; yet these relationships are somewhat constricted by the limitations of both technology and human agency in the realm of MMOGs. In the ideal case, with no such restrictions, what would it mean to transport the metaphor of avatar-centric measurement and representation existing in virtual worlds into architecture within the physical world? While egotistical space is concomitant with the avatar in virtual worlds, its translation into physical architecture's reality is not straightforward. Representations of the virtual as a homoge- neous void or liquid malleable space allowed a physical approach that remained a metaphor nonetheless. A perceived lack of tectonic constraints within virtuality provided for a logical justification for blobby or otherwise liquid aesthetics in physical architecture, as evidenced by the work of Greg Lynn, Marcos Novak, NOX, and oth- ers. The human body was thus destined to find its place and adjust to the liquidity. More recent interpretations of the virtual paradigm, focusing on interactivity and immersability, logically prompted spaces defined by reactive media, wherein the actions of a human body are monitored by sensors to yield morphological changes to the physi- cal environment, as in Kas Oosterhuis's work. The ability to invoke change in one's physical environment- certainly an architectural approach following the non-standardized-human-as-measure lineage of Michelangelo-de Mézières-Tschumi-Oosterhuis- seems to qualify as an expression of egotism on the part of the inhabitant as a propagator.14 This particular lineage specifically highlights the human as not only an aesthetic unit, but as a psychoanalytical mea- sure of architecture.15 A logical shift from thematizing "space" then is to talk about space via the desires of every individual "gamer." Yet any manipulation of physical space invariably achieves an effect (or affect) for every inhabitant. Thus an individual's ability to alter physi- cal space is in fact totalizing from the start. As a totalizing utopia, James Cameron's Avatar has a larger significance in the context of non-egoistic egotistical space. The movie presents a curious scenario of reconciling physical and vir- tual realities, coming together in a common environment: the planet Pandora. Logistically, this is implemented by a plethora of "body architectures" extending the space of the visiting humans into the autochthonous environment of the Na'vi tribe. Permanent transposi- tion of life away from a human subject into a bio-synthetic avatar is also possible. This representation of the spatial paradigm is further significant because, unlike in most virtual worlds, where the sustain- ability of the virtual world is dependent on egoistic principles, the scenario of Cameron's film allows human avatars to act out of empa- thy with the planet's community and environment. The real possibility for this ethical integrity, however, lies in the unity of the spatial con- text encompassing both humans and locals. In contrast to this unity, the division between virtual and physical in the context of most virtual worlds allows the gamer a deliberate disassociation from the unde- sirable consequences of their avatar's actions. 100</page><page sequence="10">101 Outside of film, a complete analogy to the egotistical space propagation of virtual worlds- or the Utopian case of Avatar- is not feasible because the human body cannot actually merge with physical space: in philosophical terms, the ontologies of body and space differ. Moreover, there is an ultimate separation between the alternate ego embodiments, the virtual and the physical self: in Avatar the ethical problem of egoism is solved by eliminating the ambiguity between virtual and real within a body that mediates between both states. Hence, the last theoretically possible portal to pure egotistical space is through eliding two spatial contexts, physi- cal and virtual- and this is a path already taken by some architects. For example, architectural exploration of the possibilities of "physi- cal computing," "smart materials," and "responsive environments" are attempts at erasing the boundary between physical and virtual by introducing physical morphological changes via digital means, and vice versa. Examples of such attempts are the Blur Building (2002) in Yverdon-les-Bains, Switzerland, by Diller Scofidio + Renfro;Figure6 the Living Light (2009) installation in Seoul by The Living; or the 2003 Muscle NSA in the Centre Pompidou in Paris by ONL. The problem with understanding and implementing the tecton- ics of virtual worlds in physical architecture is precisely the problem of incorporation. Virtual worlds allow complete transposition between body and space, thus emphasis on constructing a body is possible not in opposition to, but as a part of, egotistical space. My proposi- tion is that in the pursuit of this endeavor, one can revisit the mythos underlying the virtual's presumed spatiality, as discussed in the intro- duction, and therefore it may be possible to rethink architecture's interpretation of the virtual not as liquid and infinitely flexible, but ultimately as another kind of embodiment of the egotistical individual subject's desire. In which case, physical architecture must become even more phenomenologically resonant to reposition the avatar's peripheral environments as an instrument for collective experience beyond the domain of the virtual.

Edward Geoffrey Parrinder, Avatar and Incarnation (New York: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1970). 3 The opening line of the Official Avatar Handbook , the manual that was printed dur- ing the pilot testing for Habitat and written in the avatars' voice, engages and charges the player: "As Avatars, we feel it necessary</page><page sequence="12">to explain to you why we, in essence, are allowing you to take our form and enter our society." http://www.dsgames.net/qlink/ habitat/Habitat%20Manual.pdf. 4 The total participants in all virtual worlds can only be estimated, since a large number of these worlds are free to access, and hence a census is unrealistic, however, companies releasing pay-for-service MMOGs, such as World of Warcraft' s publisher, Blizzard Entertainment, compile specific numbers based on monthly subscriptions.

Randall Farmer, "The Lessons of Lucasfilm's Habitat," in Cyberspace: First Steps , ed. Michael Benedikt (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1991), 273. 6 On the one hand, passages , edges , door- ways, and similar key architectural elements have been theoretically addressed as concepts in architectural and urban planning texts for decades- works by Robin Evans and Kevin Lynch deal specifically with those terms- so that an interest in the mean- ing of those in virtuality is already loaded. See Kevin Lynch, The Image of the City (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1960); and Robin Evans, Translations from Drawing to Building (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1997). On the other hand, the process of "architecturization" of game graphics is further obliged to the number of context designers, "level designers" with an archi- tectural degree or background, or at least a self-described affinity for architecture. Amongst many examples are the award- winning design firm Tronic Studio, both of whose founders hold M.Arch. degrees (see http://www.tronicstudio.eom/#/about); the director of Tron: Legacy , Joseph Kosinski, also an M.Arch. holder (Brook Barnes, "Cyberspace Gamble," New York Times , 3 Dec. 2010); and the main developer and designer of online communities like Habitat and The Palace , Chip Morningstar, who pro- claims only three interests on his personal website- software, architecture, and photog- raphy (see http://www.fudco.com/chip/). 7 Morningstar's text on Habitat points to a shortcoming that has prevented the multiplayer game from becoming truly expansive. Amongst the main differences in design between this early online commu- nity and contemporary virtual worlds is the former's desire to control and predetermine the in-world appearance and experience, an approach considered standard in stand-alone games. Attention to the rep- resentation of a very large planned spatial context, however, quickly revealed itself to be an overwhelming and unnecessary effort, which could not keep up with the players' Notes desires and behaviors. In contrast to the rigidity of Habitat's implementation, the contemporary avatar-centric approach to virtual being, as described in this text, stems from the persistency and self-sustainability of MMOGs.

Jacques Lacan, "The Mirror Stage as Formative of the Function of the I as Revealed in Psychoanalytic Experience," in Ecrits: A Selection, trans. Alan Sheridan (New York: W.W. Norton, 1977), 5. 12 These art movements, contemporary to Lacan, exploited fragmentation of space by juxtaposition of object to context to viewer. In the case of MMOGs, I will argue, spatial fragmentation of the object is oblivious to context. Spatial discontinuities involving object and context are addressed, for exam- ple, in reference to Giacometti by Rosalind Krauss, Passages in Modern Sculpture (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1987), 128. 13 The egotistical nature of the virtual body- space composite is confirmed by the central position of the avatar in every image- the geometrical control of visual space is thus consistent with the foundational principle of ego psychology- hence the choice of characterizing term. The principle of the ego was first described by Anna Freud as the "warding off of displeasure"- similarly, the avatar's body becomes the primary figure of an observed image, and hence the surrounding periphery is less displeasing or threatening.
