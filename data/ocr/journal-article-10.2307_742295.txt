<plain_text><page sequence="1">Primary Sources A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman Anne MacNeil The disassociation of music from the medieval quadrivium and its realignment with what we now call the fine arts is one of the basic defin- ing characteristics of the Renaissance as a historical period,1 and yet mu- sic historians have tended to resist construction of a theory of Renais- sance music that encompasses the visual, poetic, dramatic, and musical arts as integral components in the craft of what Girolamo Mei in 1560 called the arti fattive.2 Howard Brown and Claude Palisca have argued that music and rhetoric might be thoughtfully combined in a compre- hensive theory of imitation, and a number of other modern writers have followed their lead in further developing a musical-rhetorical conception of Renaissance polyphony.3 But the visual and dramatic arts-those of the fine arts that add a physical, spatial component to the equation- have rarely found room in studies of musical poetics, and music's poten- tial to signify intertextual as well as intratextual meaning has not yet been fully explored. Analyses of music and the body, however-logical descendants from the Doctrine of the Affections-are now beginning to be written thanks to the growth of gender studies in music history and increasing interaction between music-historical studies and ethnomusi- cology.4 Renaissance practices that integrated music with visual and verbal media, like the glorious Medici and Gonzaga wedding festivities, entries of visiting dignitaries into cities, and civic processions that celebrated the end of war or the beginning of new alliances, suggest the need for a comprehensive theory of the performative arts in this period, to under- stand better not only art's relationship to the artist, but its relationship to politics and the increasingly more cohesive aesthetic agendas that characterize the development of permanent diplomacy in western Eu- rope. The writings and performances of commedia dell'arte players offer an especially rich field of sources for this kind of study, in part because Renaissance comedy was a particularly physical art form that drew atten- tion to the human body, its sex, and gendered social interactions, and in part because comedians were celebrated both for the diversity of their talents and for the political and cultural savvy of their entertainments. 247</page><page sequence="2">248 The Musical Quarterly They were active participants in Renaissance court culture when social and diplomatic relations were highly prized, and yet they were perma- nent members of no single court.5 Comedians therefore provide a unique perspective of sixteenth-century elite society and its aesthetic programs: a perspective that encompasses both an abstract vision of what consti- tutes courtly practice and a well-considered specific view of individual styles of patronage. The actress Isabella Andreini was and is considered by many to have been the finest representative of her time and profes- sion. Analysis of her writings and contemporary reactions to them makes a strong case study for continued work on a theoretical integration of the performative arts in the sixteenth century, on the identification and rep- resentation of interdisciplinary aesthetic agendas as part of the political programs of Renaissance courts, and on characterizing the changing roles of men and women at court. Born Isabella Canali, Andreini entered the theatrical profession in 1578 when, at the age of sixteen, she married Francesco Andreini, a gentleman soldier from Pistoia. Nothing is known of the actress before her marriage,6 but Francesco fought under the banner of the Medici in the wars against the Turks in the 1570s, turning to the stage after his re- lease from eight years in an enemy prison. The actor's habitual role was that of the braggart military man, Capitano Spavento della Valle In- ferna.7 The couple quickly became leading players in the already famous company known as the Gelosi, their marriage providing them with a professional cachet roughly equivalent to that of Lynn Fontanne and Alfred Lunt or, prior to their divorce, Emma Thompson and Kenneth Brannagh. Isabella assumed the role of innamorata among the Gelosi, second only to the troupe's veteran leading lady, Vittoria Piisimi, and by 1589, Andreini was vying with Piisimi for the status of prima donna innamorata within the company. Among the Gelosi's more noteworthy performances are those for the Medici wedding festivities in 1589, the baptism of Cosimo de' Medici in 1592, the entrance of Margherita and Alberto of Austria into Italy in 1598, and the signing of the peace treaty between Rome and Savoy in 1601.8 Over the course of time, the An- dreinis' fame skyrocketed, and upon Isabella's untimely death in 1604 the Gelosi, one of the most renowned and longest-standing companies in the history of the commedia dell'arte, disbanded. The great actress died in Lyons at the age of forty-two while giving birth to what would have been her ninth child. The preface to Francesco's publication of theatrical dialogues is a touching reminder not only of his love for his wife and children and of Isabella's widespread fame, but of the rhetorical foundation of their craft; titled "Corinto pastore alla defunta sua Fillide," a small section of it reads:</page><page sequence="3">Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman 249 Oh! sacred and venerated stone, break, for pity's sake, and disclose your beloved contents to my eyes! Take these, my sighs, these, my tears, and these kisses as well, and give them to the cold ashes of my dear Phyllis, who in your damp, cold breast lies freezing, so that, if ever her most beautiful spirit will deem them worthy of one solitary glance, she will know that with her death a thousand deaths and a thousand more I suffer for her. And turning again to speak with you, beautiful soul in heaven above-know that when the sun, in mounting its gilded car- riage, faded your mortal star, it remained three times in its course, want- ing to die, and in the end to cover your doom with eternal shade. Know, too, that at your death the celestial spheres were heard singing hymns sweet and soft; and that the worldly goddesses who live on Mount Par- nassus were seen all dressed in funereal robes, and were also heard to sing the most doleful elegies around your honored tomb.9 Isabella and Francesco Andreini were part of a long tradition of co- medians who performed plays with music at northern Italian courts, a tradition that is traceable in written documents from the third quarter of the fifteenth century. Nino Pirrotta's and Elena Povoledo's text, Li due Orfei,1o is still the most comprehensive treatment of the subject, and. it has been admirably augmented by a number of scholars, among them Marina Calore, whose discussion of pastoral plays with music performed in the Padana region of Italy brings into focus wedding festivities at the courts of Ferrara and neighboring cities. Iain Fenlon's trenchant studies of Venetian and Mantuan cronache inexorably demonstrate the fruitful- ness of discussing musical and theatrical performances in relation to pre- vailing social and political climates, and his essays have gone a long way toward defining music's role in triumphal entries and civic processions in Renaissance Italy. From an architectural perspective, Maria Teresa Mu- raro's work, together with Elena Povoledo's and Franco Manini's, in documenting the design and construction of theaters in the Veneto has provided a wealth of documentation and must now be considered an es- sential foundation for further research in music and theater.1 Although these scholars' studies show that a humanistic integration of the visual, poetic, and musical arts had been achieved in practice significantly ear- lier than the so-called birth of opera in 1597, the underlying philosophi- cal conflict between differing conceptions of music as pure science or physical craft-between musica speculativa and musica rappresentativa- still yielded sufficient force at the end of the sixteenth century to erupt in heated debates like the quarrel between the conservative music theo- rist Giovan Maria Artusi and the progressive composer Claudio Mon- teverdi. And, as Susan McClary and Suzanne Cusick have shown, ques- tions of embodiment and gender form a central part of this conflict.12</page><page sequence="4">250 The Musical Quarterly Artusi adopted the posture of a well-educated humanist scholar trained in the tradition of Battista Guarino, the famed fifteenth-century forebear of the author of Pastor fido, who codified a highly influential ed- ucational system in Ferrara in the mid-fifteenth century. At the basis of Guarino's system stood the impassive assertion that rhetorical studies prepared the student for life within the Renaissance court. Subscription to this belief in the relationship between rhetorical study and life often generated an unyielding insistence on decorum and rules, as Artusi demonstrated in his indictment of Monteverdi's "unprecedented" and "unnatural" uses of dissonance in the five-part madrigals composed in the 1590s and later published in his fifth book. Artusi's humanistic train- ing, accrued through years of repetitive exercise, compelled him to grant priority to the rules of pure counterpoint over the new, interdisciplinary ideals grounded in the representation of affect that Monteverdi es- poused.13 In short, he did not view music as a component of rhetorical composition. Monteverdi's standing in the inner circle of Mantua's theatrical elite, however, together with librettists and performers like Alessandro Striggio, Ottavio Rinuccini, and the Andreini family, gave him rein to consider the musician's art as part of a greater whole, in which the texts of his madrigals and their dramatic impact-while they may have detracted from the integrity of his counterpoint in certain in- stances-strengthened the madrigals' overall rhetorical designs. In this sense, Monteverdi's music, like the early modern schoolboy's exercise of composing laments patterned on classical models of noblewomen in ex- tremis, represents the exertion of emotional self-control by defining the boundary between decorum and excess through the rapid reining in of brief, unconventional outbursts. That Monteverdi translated a rhetori- cian's Figures of Words into Figures of Music reveals the comprehension and subtlety of his craft.14 As Cusick has pointed out in reference to Monteverdi's much stud- ied "Cruda Amarilli" and its famous dissonant canto entrance at the words "Ahi lasso!," "Artusi's attack.., . focuses on the errors and unnat- ural acts of the highest sounding part, which, because it is generated by the lower one, ought to have obeyed the latter's desire for consonant harmony.""5 Drawing on the foundation of McClary's "Constructions of Gender in Monteverdi's Dramatic Music," Cusick focused her own argu- ment on the gendered aspects of the discourse, emphasizing the time- worn comparison of serva and padrona and showing how Artusi's criti- cisms of the composer's skill in writing polyphony might also be read not only as attacks on Monteverdi's masculinity, but on the overall ef- feminacy of modern music. Artusi's was a formulaic intellectual gambit, however, based on rhetorical tropes handed down through several gener-</page><page sequence="5">Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman 251 ations of Renaissance humanists and cannot, therefore, be read as an un- mediated response to Monteverdi's music. Moreover, because of the ba- sic perception of education as the preparation for adult life at court, Ar- tusi figured Monteverdi's compositional technique within an allegorical context that centers more on conceptions of coming of age, the adop- tion of the habits of a good citizen, and the submission of the individual to social convention.'16 Elucidation of the pedagogical role of gendered constructions like Artusi's and their tenacity over time may be seen in a letter Guarino wrote to Isotta Nogarola, chastising her for an unchecked expression of anger and frustration: This evening I received your letters, full of complaints and accusations, in which you render me uncertain as to whether I should feel pain for you or congratulate myself. For when I saw fit to give my attention to that outstanding intellect of yours, with its attendant embellishments of learning, I was accustomed besides to express strongly my opinion that you were manly of spirit, that nothing could happen which you would not bear with a courageous and indomitable spirit. Now, however, you show yourself so cast down, humiliated and truly womanish that I am able to perceive nothing which accords with my previous magnificent opinion of you.17 In addition to their uses as correctives for anger and emotional ex- cess, Guarino's letters to Nogarola suggest that the concept of the heroic woman who wielded an Amazonian command of oratory, like her classi- cal predecessors Cassandra and Penthesilea, fascinated early modern hu- manists. Expressions of this idolization of the eloquent woman emerged in the sixteenth century not only in humanists' letters and their advo- cacy of such women in their academies, but also at court, in the wide- spread rise of commedia dell'arte actresses in the 1570s and in the con- figuration of a new kind of aristocratic performing ensemble in the 1570s and 1580s-the concerto delle donne. As Anthony Newcomb has shown, Ariosto, too, publicized the esteemed ideal of the heroic woman in his Orlando furioso and placed the image within a historical continuum. The epic begins: Women have arrived at excellence in every art in which they have striven; in their chosen fields their renown is apparent to anyone who studies the history books. If the world has long remained unaware of their achievements, this sad state of affairs is only transitory; perhaps envy concealed the honors due to them, or perhaps the ignorance of historians.'8</page><page sequence="6">252 The Musical Quarterly In politics as in literature, women's roles gained importance in the sixteenth century, as marriage became a primary avenue for negotiating diplomatic relations among courts. As a result, espoused women, with their retinues, became permanent representatives of their paternal dy- nasties at their husbands' courts, assuming a diplomatic function parallel to that of official ambassadors who, paid out of the chancellery, were charged to take up residence in a foreign ruler's domain and to maintain their patron's interests there. Wives' ambassadorial functions, although unofficial and unpaid, were no less critical to the exercise of interna- tional diplomacy, as Maria de' Medici's often contentious relationships to her husband's and son's courts, especially in regard to French policies concerning Spain, so powerfully demonstrates.'9 Artusi's arguments show evidence of a backlash against this bur- geoning feminine agency in his insistence that the feminine be sub- sumed within a dominant masculine frame that he identified as "natural" because he perceived it as normative. Not all scholars subscribed to such rigid constructions, however, and elsewhere, as in the literary quarrels about Ariosto's Orlando furioso and Tasso's Gerusalemme liberata, nature and truth were portrayed as feminine and the falsity of art as masculine. This late-Renaissance tension between conceptions of nature and art as either feminine or masculine is nowhere more apparent than in sixteenth-century women's constructions of self and in the styles of theatrical performance practiced by Isabella Andreini and her peers.20 Renaissance men's self-fashionings, most notably recorded in Stephen Greenblatt's writings on the works of Sir Thomas More, Edmund Spenser, and others, did not usually broach the topic of art versus nature because men's authority depended on the perception of wealth, position, and even virtue, but not on their sex.21 Women, however, often invoked a dichotomy between art and nature in their compositions and perfor- mances in order to construct a hermaphroditic persona that might gain credibility within a masculine authoritative sphere.22 Formulation of such a persona was complicated, for it relied on contemporary intellec- tual arguments regarding the aesthetic evaluation of poetry and art, which might be posited in either a negative or a positive light. The ques- tion was not one of attaining social authority, but of trading one form of authority for another, and the effort usually outweighed the effect. As we shall see, Isabella Andreini's self-fashioning gained her, in at least one contemporary scholar's estimation, the status of a work of art-a mascu- line construct, but a sterile one-a lovely icon and nothing more. Andreini's self-fashioning, like that of the men Greenblatt de- scribes, was also closely tied to economics, and in this she differs from many other women artists of the period. As an actress, Andreini by ne-</page><page sequence="7">Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman 253 cessity solicited benefaction, and so she does not fall into the same cate- gory of creative women as a Gaspara Stampa (1523-54) or a Laura Guidiccioni (1550-97)-noblewomen who wrote and published poetry but eschewed contracts and monetary remuneration. Andreini's social position more closely resembled that of musicians like Tarquinia Molza and Adriana Basile, for whom patronage was a fact of life and whose fi- nancial security depended on their artistic success.23 This association of creativity with economics fostered a sense of awareness in Andreini's, Molza's, and Basile's works of stratagems pertaining to the differences be- tween men's and women's social spaces, a compositional negotiation that was generally absent in the writings of noblewomen. In essence, women like Andreini engaged in creative as well as economic barter with their benefactors, whereas noblewomen like Stampa and Guidiccioni could perform a similar creative role within the circles of female court culture with little regard for broaching the distance between themselves and masculine spheres of patronage. As a result, the image Andreini upheld to the world's eye during her brief but illustrious life reflects a curious combination of distinct feminine and masculine attributes, as well as ev- idence of a constant pressure to publicize her various saleable talents. In- deed, Andreini's notoriety rested on the fact that she did not trade her feminine power for its masculine complement, but rather exerted both forms of artistic authority in their respective social spaces and triumphed in the wit and dlan that allowed her to move back and forth between them. She never attempted to resolve these juxtapositions nor meld them into an androgynous unity; she instead established a comparative framework for her self-image within which both masculine and feminine traits might be contrasted with each other. These polarities resonate fur- ther with Andreini's profession as a commedia dell'arte actress, which invites reference to masking and unmasking and to the illusion of oppo- sites embodied within a single image; I know of no other actress of the time, however, who so successfully infused both life and work with this juxtaposition of masculine virtue and feminine nature. The confrontation of Andreini's constructed self-image with con- temporary court culture gave birth to a variety of intellectual and artistic responses to her work that help to illustrate how she and various other members of elite society integrated new ideas about the meanings of courtliness, diplomacy, and women's roles into their preconceptions of the world and its hierarchies. These exchanges include a correspondence with the Belgian humanist Erycius Puteanus on the subject of women as creative artists, musical settings of Andreini's lyric poems by a number of Italian composers, and intertextual imitations of dramatic topoi in plays concurrently within the Gelosi's performing repertory. In each case, the</page><page sequence="8">254 The Musical Quarterly author or composer addressed the transgendering of Andreini's self- image in either words, actions, or music, as well as its play with ideas of truth, falsity, art, and nature. Puteanus made contrasts between masculine art and feminine na- ture in Andreini's self-fashioning explicit in a letter of 14 December 1601, which was printed in his Epistolarum fercula secunda of 1603.24 He wrote in reply to a gift she had sent him-a copy of the poems she pub- lished that same year under the title Rime-and his admiration extended not only to her verses, but also to the earlier publication of her pastoral play Mirtilla in 1588.25 In the course of his epistle, Puteanus invoked Neoplatonic and Aristotelian arguments associating masculinity with the literary and rhetorical arts and with them traced an outline of An- dreini that was overwhelmingly manly. In ascribing masculine traits to a woman and to art rather than to nature, Puteanus's treatment of the male-female dichotomy contrasts with Artusi's in that Puteanus appears to celebrate nature's undeniable femininity, whereas Artusi isolated the errant feminine outside the natural order. Puteanus's bold assertion of Andreini's artistic masculinity extended to the ridiculous end of calling her a man, but he palliated this conclusion by appealing to the image of a community of Amazons and their legendary queen, Penthesilea, who was said to have been so beautiful, young, and valorous that Achilles bitterly regretted having triumphed over her in battle at the fall of Troy. He held up Andreini as a new Penthesilea who, although outwardly masculine, would possess profound feminine beauty and strength, and finally, he made an etymological pun on the name Andreini, using the Greek words aner and andros, to show that even Andreini's name would betray her inherent manliness. On the surface, and contrary to the theo- ries advanced by McClary and Cusick regarding the framing of women in Renaissance art, Puteanus here astonishingly appears to place mascu- line art within a feminine frame. That such eloquence, that such learning should fall to the part of a woman! Where does that sex, which is mighty in writing, which sweats in public declamation, which grows old in literary studies, where does it show itself stronger than in you? Behold, now there are amazons of learning, and they have their own Penthesilea. Shall I not call you by the name Andreina with good reason and set you up against men? It has been implanted in women by nature to be able to speak, but in you to be able to speak well, whence it arises that by correcting a female vice you surpass even the virtue of the male.26 Puteanus's letter to Andreini, however, conforms to the language of a similar letter written by Angelo Poliziano to Cassandra Fedele, a con-</page><page sequence="9">Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman 255 gruency that demonstrates the formulaic derivation of Puteanus's praise. It is clear from the imitation that Puteanus sought not so much to de- scribe Andreini as to locate her within a tradition of learned, inspired women-a contextualization that would in turn solidify his own position in line with the great Renaissance humanists Guarino and Poliziano and ultimately with the ancient Greeks, whose language he appropriated for the word "men" within his text. Poliziano's letter reads: What an astonishing impact it must make upon us, truly, that it was possible for such [letters] to be produced by a woman-what do I say, a woman? By a girl, rather, and a virgin. It shall therefore no longer be the exclusive privilege of antiquity to boast of their Sybils and their Muses, the Pythagoreans of their female philosophers, the Socratics of their Diotima, of Aspasia; and neither will the relics of Greece proclaim those female poets, Telesilla, Corinna, Sappho, Anyte, Erinna, Praxilla, Cleobulina and the others. Now we shall readily believe the Roman ac- count of the daughters of Laelius and Hortensius, of Cornelia, mother of the Gracchi, as matrons of surpassing eloquence. Now we know, truly by this we know, that your sex has not after all been condemned to slow- ness and stupidity.27 Puteanus, continuing his praise of Andreini, toward the end of his letter compared her natural, or physical, female self with the virile traits he ascribed to her by urging the actress to increase her masculine cre- ativity and match it to her already fecund procreativity. In so doing, he established a parallelism between nature and art that equates the work- ings of the mind with the mysteries of the womb. As Puteanus writes, Nature herself and the father of time have given you to our age, but you will give yourself to posterity. What we admire in you, we owe to your own industry and at the same time to benign nature, but what posterity will admire in you will redound to you alone. For which reason I exhort and beg you the more vehemently to commend yourself no less to pos- terity by writing than by speaking you commend to us the kindness of nature. We have seen the Mirtilla eclogue and now your Rime. Bring out more, so that fertile with children as you are, you may also turn out to be fertile with books.28 In an earlier letter, Puteanus had established a theoretical formula- tion by which he reasoned Andreini's dual-gendered self-image. This construct is important not only because it outlines a method by which a woman might have appropriated masculine-gendered traits within this strong tradition of humanist representation, but also because Puteanus</page><page sequence="10">256 The Musical Quarterly overstepped the boundary between ascribing masculine attributes and denying female physical fact; in doing so, he turned Andreini into an ob- jet d'art. In short, he dissolved the boundary between nature and art in a manner not unrelated to Artusi's dismissal of the feminine in reference to music. Just as Artusi had characterized the feminine (if we follow Cu- sick's interpretation) as a disruptive force within the masculine composi- tional hierarchy of the madrigal, Puteanus here is shown to describe the feminine as a individualistic form of irrationality to be overcome by communal masculine virility. In this, he follows the educational scheme that Guarino had modeled after the myth of Achilles, wherein the femi- nine represented the unruly expression of individual will in confronta- tion with the good of the state, and the masculine, adherence to social convention. Puteanus accomplished his erasure by way of a comparison between the Latin words virtus (virtue) and vir (man). Virtue, in terms derived from St. Thomas's Summa theologica, resulted in an ordering of the mind, demonstrated in acts of rational thought and scholarship, and thus, Puteanus's clever but predictable and overwrought etymological game-a trademark of Renaissance humanism-concluded with the bald statement that Andreini was, in fact, a man. Truly in my opinion you supply a defect of nature, Andreina, who are not only capable of male glory but in fact an equal partner in it. No, more, abandoning your own sex, you transform yourself by the labor of virtue into a man. Now if the word virtue derives from the word man, then you are more fruitful than a man, you who, though a woman, bring forth the fruit of virtue. But if the word man derives from the word virtue, then the reward of the better name, I mean the name of man, is due to you who perform the offices belonging to the better name. There- fore you are a man. And indeed you are called a man by name, if you look closely at the name Andreina.29 In spite of their author's apparently good intentions, to modern readers, Puteanus's compliments leave a bitter aftertaste, and I wonder if Andreini found them equally pungent. In praising the individual, he derided women as a group, stating that Andreini's birth in female form was a defect (in essence, a "monstrous birth") to be overcome by her masculine virtue, that all women by nature chatter and babble, whereas Andreini spoke well, and that eloquence and learning were foreign to women, whereas the great actress proved her manhood (so to speak) through writing and rhetoric. Moreover, he likened Andreini to the leg- endary Penthesilea-a woman who, although beautiful and valorous, died a violent death and was essentially a tragic, impotent figure. An- dreini's own forays into masking her womanhood with virile armor did</page><page sequence="11">Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman 257 not indulge in such misogyny, nor were they centered on Aristotelian conceptions of virtiL. She took a Petrarchan route, grounded more firmly in the "constructive" arts than humanistic philosophy, and, by com- mending the female sex while in masculine guise, managed to sing her own praises. In this, Andreini's self-fashioning drew on contemporary court literature like Ariosto's Orlando furioso and Tasso's Gerusalemme lib- erata, with their depictions of bold, valorous women like Bradamante, Marfisa, and Clorinda, whose nobility and heritage incited them to don armor and ride into battle. These were the images of femininity valued by the rulers of Renaissance courts-not for nothing were generations of Este daughters after the publication of Orlando furioso named Marfisa and Bradamante-and Andreini, in adapting her self-image to ideals of noble valor rather than disobedience, reinforced her patrons' ideas of dynastic integrity and virtue by blood rather than gender.30 Andreini formulated her masculine persona partly by writing po- etry and poesia per musica in what we have come to call the male voice, and she is one of only two known female poets of the Renaissance to have done so, the other being Laura Terracina.31 What has been called the "male voice," however, I would more accurately describe as the "fem- inine ear," for the gender of these poems' protagonists is rarely indicated, and arguments concerning the "male" and "female" voices often erro- neously assume a heterosexual relationship between author and auditor that is particularly inappropriate to Renaissance poetry.32 What is clear in analyzing Andreini's musical lyrics and Renaissance verse in general is the establishment of a dyad consisting of dominant and submissive partners (just as there were a serva and a padrona within the Renaissance household, there were also a servo and a padrone), which are usually construed as respectively masculine and feminine. This hierarchical structure, however, cannot be taken as an indication of the sex of its protagonists, for, as Michael Rocke has shown in his fascinating study of homosexuality and male culture in Renaissance Florence, submissive partners in sodomic relationships were consistently gendered as feminine in court records and diaries as well as in carnival songs, even though their sex was decidedly male.33 The feminine position, therefore, was one of submission, like Artusi's serva, and identified not by the presumed gender of the poem's interlocutors but by the style of its rhetoric. The style of Andreini's poetry varies depending on her adoption of a dominant or submissive authorial tone and on the individual construc- tion of her lyrics-their genre, sources of imitation, subject matter, and poetic conceit. At times, her verses describe innocent, almost asexual pastoral or courtly love in a Petrarchan mode, as in the madrigal "Ove si tosto voli sogno?"</page><page sequence="12">258 The Musical Quarterly Where do you so suddenly fly, dream? Ah, do not depart, since sweetly you console my bitter and anguished suffering. If you alone make my Lady compassionate of my long suffering, kind deceiver, why do you go? It is certainly true that the contentment of love flees like a cloud in the wind.34 Andreini's poems can convey, however, a deeper, more burning passion and more forceful delivery, as in the madrigal "Quella bocca di rose." That red mouth my charming Licori, all smiling and beautiful, offers me at last in reward for my great pain (ah! cunning shepherdess!) Behold, I kiss her, and she, who in her mouth hides the torches of love, sets my soul on fire with her kisses.35 In both styles, Andreini engages an authoritative perspective that deconstructs or otherwise fragments the subject of the verse. In the first poem, the lady love is nearly invisible-an apt characterization for an image that occupies only a fleeting dream, and yet typical of the domi- nating (heretofore "male") authorial gaze. She is held on a pedestal and, like a living statue, is capable only of recognizing or remaining blind to the poet's anguish, much like Puteanus's characterization of the poem's author. In contrast, the feminized object of the second poem is more clearly in evidence, although fragmented. "She" has a name, and we are told that she is a shepherdess, but the view we have of her is only from chin to nose-a fractured image of the feminine object that marks the dominant gaze even today.36 But few women composed poetry from such a powerful perspective. The prismatic view of Licori in Andreini's madri- gal, for example, may be fruitfully compared to the more comprehensive, submissive vision of the lover in Gaspara Stampa's sonnet "Or sopra il forte e veloce destriero." I tell myself I see my lovely sun mounted upon his powerful, swift steed, chasing the hare or hart, or rapid flock of birds, with falcon or with sparrowhawk;</page><page sequence="13">Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman 259 Now with his spear he fights the savage boar, awaiting its attack with fierce disdain; again, he bends his wise and lofty thoughts to the pursuits of Mars and of Minerva. He eats now, now he sleeps, he rises, speaks, now gazes on his hill, now with humane welcoming manner he receives all guests. And so, my lord, though I am far away, love so inspires me and spurs me on that I can plainly see your every act.7 The poem's "author" might be an adoring adolescent of either sex. From the submissive subject position, though, the author not only sees the lover's every act, but also imagines him so completely that the vision includes his horse, the prey he hunts, his lands, and his guests, however equivocal those metaphors might be. In contrast, although Andreini's verse is written in a more terse, epigrammatic style than Stampa's son- net, the dominating gaze of the madrigal, in focusing exclusively on the shepherdess's mouth, is exceedingly narrow. Taking the two poems to- gether, whereas the submissive position is characterized by fragmenta- tion, the dominant is shown to be comprehensive and all-encompassing; this is the same formulation posited by Artusi in reference to Mon- teverdi's madrigals, wherein a single dissonant voice was construed as feminine within the overall consonance of the five-voice texture. Fur- ther demonstrations of the differences between the dominant and sub- missive authorial voices would look beyond the poetry's meaning to its sound, a theoretical move that brings us closer to a parallel construction of the authorial voice in music. Stampa's soft, "o"- and "a"-laden verse, for example, with its insistent repetition of the word "Or" at the begin- nings of lines 1, 5, 7, 9, and 10 and the predominance of its sensuous "o" vowels in the incipit, more closely resembles the dreamy wistfulness of "Ove si tosto voli sogno?" (also made up primarily of "o" vocables) than with the greedy, staccato accents of "k"s (as in "Quella bocca," "Ecco," and "Bocca asconde"), "t"s ("tutta"), and double consonants ("bocca," "Ecco," "tutta") in "Quella bocca di rose." Musical settings of Andreini's poetry offer a variety of responses to her adoption of the dominating authorial perspective, just as Mon- teverdi's setting of "Cruda Amarilli" offers a response to Guarini's poem and a musical characterization of the dramatic moment within II pastor fido in which it occurs. Pietro Paolo Torre's setting of "Ove si tosto voli sogno?", beyond exhibiting minor alterations in grammar and punctua- tion, eradicates Andreini's obvious referent to a feminized object by omitting lines five and six of the poem, which also weakens the poem's</page><page sequence="14">260 The Musical Quarterly rhetorical strength, making hash of its rhyme scheme and stanzaic struc- ture. Nor does the poem's subject matter remain convincingly secular, once the lines "Se pietosa tu sol Madonna fai / Del mio lungo languire" [If you alone make my Lady compassionate / of my long suffering] are excised (see Ex. 1, m. 33): Where do you so suddenly fly, dream? Ah, do not depart, since sweetly you console my bitter and anguished suffering. Kind deceiver, why do you go? It is certainly true that the contentment of love flees like a cloud in the wind.38 Torre's madrigal might speak as clearly to the anguish of lapsed faith in God or the conclusion of an ecstatic vision as it does in An- dreini's version to the pangs of love. In removing the reference to a "Madonna" who responds to feelings of desire, Torre-an organist and monk at the monastery of S. Gieronimo near Milan-turned the poem from a Petrarchan love lyric into a song of devotion in which love em- anates only from the first person. In so doing, although the word "Madonna" may well have been what drew him to the poem in the first place, Torre also removed from the song's construction any issues of cor- poreal sexuality or illicit thoughts about the lady that might have arisen from a setting of the entire stanza.39 One can readily imagine Torre teaching two of S. Gieronimo's novices to sing the voice parts, which are written in a simple, easily performable style. The imitative entries hardly overlap (when they do, one of the voices tends to hold to a single pitch while the other moves, as at mm. 10-11), and when the voices sing to- gether, it is in a facile texture of parallel thirds over a sustained bass that is immediately satisfying to the ear. There is little dissonance, other than a few carefully controlled suspensions on words like "amaro" and "mar- tire," and none of the unruly, acrid entrances that caused Artusi to com- plain so bitterly against Monteverdi's compositional technique. Indeed, if we were to transfer Artusi's anthropomorphic characterizations to Torre's madrigal and call the two canto parts the serve of the controlling, dominating bass, we would find no dissension in Torre's compositional household, for here the upper voices obey the lower and the poem (to its disfigurement) submits to the rules of musical counterpoint. The more forceful "Quella bocca di rose," however, set to music by the Neapolitan composer Donat'Antonio Spano, brings a different musi- cal style to Andreini's poetry that admits no tension, as in Torre's madri- gal, between the poet's forceful authorial stance and the collective, uni- versalizing voice of its five-part polyphonic setting.40 Here, Andreini's</page><page sequence="15">Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman 261 O - ve si tos - to vo li O - ve si 5 O- ve si tos - to vo - li tos - to vo ili O - ve si tos - to vo - li O - 10 O - ve si tos-to vo - li So - gno Deh non par-ti 0 . . . .I , ... ! 0) - - -r. r r r-"i - - i ," - ve si tos-to vo - li si tos-to vo - li So- '9:f J IJ I J )  " I [ I i p.

Spano mirrors the strength of An- dreini's poetic style in the full texture and contrapuntal conformity of his setting, although his musical imagination does not match Andreini's capacity for invention (see Ex. 2). As I have argued in regard to Andreini's musical lyrics and her correspondence with Erycius Puteanus, and with reference to Michael Rocke's work on male culture in Renaissance Florence, conceptual boundaries between masculinity and femininity in rhetorical strategies were extremely fluid, and were founded more on stylistic characteristics than on representation. I would therefore hesitate to argue that a five- voice imitative texture might be construed as feminine because the text reads from a feminine subject position, although Susan McClary's analy- sis of Monteverdi's dramatic music suggests one might do so. As she states, "It may be possible to trace some of the musical signs for 'mas- culinity' or 'femininity' that are displayed in opera back into earlier gen- res such as the madrigal.... Because madrigal texts typically speak from the masculine subject position that is assumed as normative in Western culture, they are usually treated as neutral or undifferentiated with re- spect to gender. However, there are texts-especially those drawn from Guarini or Tasso-that are understood to be female utterances, and some musical settings of these seem subtly coded as 'feminine'."41 McClary is constrained to make an exception to her general state- ment that polyphonic textures signify a masculine subject position in identifying Monteverdi's "Io mi son giovinetta" (book 4) and "O Mir- tillo" (book 5; "O Mirtillo," like "Cruda Amarilli," sets a text from Il pastor fido) as feminine because her definitions of femininity and mas- culinity are based on representational veracity. Humanists' constructions of heroic women, however, like those depicted in the letters of Guarino, Poliziano, and Puteanus, show that a different premise is at work, wherein the feminine subject position is understood as an expression of individual emotion that defines the boundaries of communal decorum by temporarily exceeding them. The fragmentary characterization of the feminine, as well as its associations with adolescence and hormonally charged narcissism and yearning, may be seen in other composers' set- tings of Guarini's texts, such as Giaches de Wert's setting of "Tirsi morir volea" (1581). Wert's dialogue distinguishes between the feminine voice of the anonymous Nymph (as Rocke would argue, Guarini's Nymph might have been a boy), Tirsi's similarly feminine-gendered voice (be- cause adolescent and fragmented), and the omniscient, "masculine" role of the narrator through textural means (see Ex. 3).</page><page sequence="18">14 In pre - mial fin In pre - mi'al fin In pre - mi'al fin In pre - mi'al fin Sla In pre - mi'al fin In pre - mial fin de' In pre - mi'al fin In pre - mi'al fin de' In pre - mi'al fin de' 18 0) !

Thyrsis curbed the desire Which by then had almost ended his life; He felt death near, yet could not die, And while he kept his gaze Fixed upon those eyes divine, And drank from thence the nectar of love, His pretty Nymph, who felt Love's heralds near, Said with languishing and trembling looks: "Die, my love, for I die." At which the Shepherd replied: "And I, my love, die." Thus the happy lovers died, A death so sweet and pleasant That in order to die again, they returned to life. Through most of the composition, both the narrator's and Tirsi's words occupy the same musical space, in four voices of the texture, while the other three parts are reserved for the voice of the Nymph-thus de- picting an overall textural fragmentation that is augmented by the in- creasingly brief motives exchanged between the voices of Tirsi and the Nymph. Only at the end of the madrigal, when the lovers have come to- gether in metaphorical sexual death, do the voices of the nymph, Tirsi, and the narrator assimilate all parts of the musical texture, thereby demonstrating the absorption of the "feminine" into the encompassing whole. Just as the theatrical styles of "Tirsi morir volea" and "Cruda Amar- illi" bring questions of representation of gender to the surface, so too did Andreini's masking of her own body take on a more empirical aspect on stage than in her poems and other writings. At times, the female mem- bers of Andreini's troupe would be asked to provide private entertain- ment for a noblewoman and her ladies-in-waiting, and on these occa- sions Andreini might play either a female or a male character. Indeed, Ferdinando Taviani has convincingly argued that one of Andreini's the- atrical triumphs was the role of Aminta in Tasso's pastoral drama.42 Part of Taviani's proof lies in the first poem in Andreini's first book of Rime, which I transcribe here in order to demonstrate the actress's conscious use of transgendering in the rhetoric of her self-fashioning. Here, An- dreini adopted an unashamedly Petrarchan idiom that centers on the</page><page sequence="23">Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman 269 idea of stylistic variation and then incorporates into this framework comparisons between poetry and theater, man and woman, art and na- ture. If ever anyone reads my neglected verses, do not believe in their false ardors, for loves imagined on stage I have set forth with feigned affects; With lies, no less with false words, I have portrayed the Muses' high madnesses, sometimes bewailing my fictive sorrows, sometimes singing my fictive delights; And as in the theater I have played now a woman, now a man, in varied style, as Nature would instruct, and Art as well, Thus, following once more my star of fleeting years, in green April, with varied style, I have penned a good thousand pages.43 The grammatical parallelisms in the third stanza of the sonnet out- line a level of comparison that associates man with art and woman with nature, as Puteanus had done in his letters, but Andreini tells us in lines ten and fourteen that the representation of gender is a style-a composi- tional technique-that she adopted both on stage and in her poems. Her allusions to the relationship between her published verses and dramatic performances are noteworthy, as she tells her readers that the poems open before them have their origins not in a book-lined cell or other private space where female authors are traditionally said to have sat in solitude with pen and paper, but rather on stage in the marketplace of imaginary lives enacted there.44 The fictions she pens, therefore, self- consciously contradict the authorial stance of authors like Gaspara Stampa, whose poetry is said to have been typically autobiographical.45 While embracing Petrarchan conceits of variation and contrast, An- dreini also pokes fun in this sonnet at the Neoplatonic ideal of divine madness, the representation of which formed the cornerstone of her theatrical fame and which stands as the foundation of humanist thought concerning the perfection of nature and the music of the spheres. As has been thoughtfully explored by Gary Tomlinson in his studies of Fi- cino's De vita coelitus comparanda,46 Renaissance humanists constructed a philosophical systemization of the universe in which one might achieve transcendence to the divine through poetic inspiration from the Muses, but Andreini in this poem admits that she has deceived her audi- ences, playacting divine madness and reciting not cosmic truth, but lies. Her parody of Renaissance Neoplatonists is obvious, as she defines yet</page><page sequence="24">270 The Musical Quarterly another border-between pedantry and intellectual fashion. She also distances herself from the concomitancy of nature, truth, and femininity, while more firmly binding her theatrical and poetic creativity to con- cepts of fantasy and art. Even when portraying a woman on stage or writing for female char- acters, Andreini often used gender reversals to parody known authors or stereotypical situations and to bring contrasts between masculine and feminine constructs to the surface. In her pastoral play Mirtilla, for ex- ample, Andreini produced a proto-feminist reading of a famous scene from Torquato Tasso's Aminta that also parodied contemporary erotica. Tasso's version, from act 2, scene 1, lines 804-5, features the Satyr, who declares his lust for the nymph Sylvia. He plans to abduct her and, if she does not concede to his wishes, says he "will force her, will rape her who denies him love's reward."'47 We are never shown the fulfillment of these desires on stage, but in a later scene Sylvia relates to another shep- herdess that she has narrowly escaped capture in the forest. In Mirtilla, Andreini begins her satiric theatregram48 in precisely the same manner, showing the Satyr alone on stage, declaring his lust for the nymph Fil- lide and asserting that, if she continues to reject him as she has in the past, he will rape her. At this point, Andreini's text diverges from Tasso's. Fillide-the part habitually played by Andreini, as was the role of Sylvia-enters the scene and is perforce abducted by the Satyr who declares his intention to tie her, naked, to an oak tree and force himself on her. Not only does Andreini's veiled reference to Tasso's oak make the source of her literary imitation explicit, but the idea of the Satyr ripping off her clothes alludes to another stereotype of the baser sort of comedy, which Andreini had built her reputation on thwarting. The im- age of a nymph tied, naked, to a tree and beaten or otherwise physically abused is also a topos that appears in erotic literature, engravings, and other prurient art forms in the late Renaissance, as may be seen in the pornographic series of engravings entitled "Lascivie" by Agostino Car- racci (1557-1602), now housed in the British Museum (see Fig. 1)49 Perilously close to having at least her bosom bared, Fillide appears to warm to the Satyr's advances as she stalls for time. She promises him a kiss if he will allow her to secure his arms so they will not bruise her deli- cate skin. Stupidly, he agrees, and once bound firmly to the tree, Fillide degrades him, tearing his beard, choking him, and pinching his bared breast. She leaves finally, triumphant, and the Satyr is subsequently dis- covered in his humiliating predicament by an old goatherd, who offers him consoling words about the "safer" satisfactions of food and wine.50 In the equivocal language of Renaissance theater and erotic poetry, the</page><page sequence="25">Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman 271 : : .-~I::??.-~====?1?-~:~:?L~I: "::rr~,:;_..~. .~.~I~ ~ _I.........~...-i~;jL------r~-:~~~-i~_~: s~--=z=--~---;i~~:-~ : -.r*? -ri ~~~,,,-.-1-: -ii-:---i i:i:--I:l- - : -- ~ 1~1-:1-- ---~ p i :?------~: ?I~-~:::::: -::~I;: ii _:-::':I-':I~-:~~ =s~----~---~?-_~:il~ a ~: : : : : :- :i ii i- I :- !I--- --II?-: - -1 II . -:-i_.~ : ::: ~lir :: - : - i :i- i:-- ii-b .: - : ii;-- ii-~ ?:b -iii -:liii,_: .; ?` -- :- _ I- .

The British Museum. old man's character and advice suggest that the Satyr exercise his lust on boys instead of women, his words implying that children are less conniv- ing than their feminine elders.51 In all of these demonstrations of Andreini's self-fashioning, she invoked a fundamentally Petrarchan dualism that contrasts feminine</page><page sequence="26">272 The Musical Quarterly style with its masculine counterpart and that plays at the boundary of decorum and excess. This relegation of femininity and masculinity to concepts of style satirizes contemporary humanist expositions of art, na- ture, masculinity, and femininity, wherein nature was often accorded a dominating, masculine characterization and the feminine was sometimes seen not only as submissive, but as unnatural. For Artusi, for example, lingering traces of scholastic music theory, wherein the harmony of the spheres held mastery over dissonance, invite an interpretation of conso- nance as both natural and masculine and dissonance as unnatural and feminine. Wert's "Tirsi morir volea" upholds this schema of the femi- nized object subsumed within a dominating frame, although Wert's dia- logue makes the transitional character of the feminine apparent, whereas humanist music theory does not. Puteanus's construct, in contrast, al- though heavy-handed and caught up in rhetorical convention, main- tains an opposing dichotomy in which Nature is feminine and art is mas- culine, which erupts in the seemingly ridiculous assertion that Andreini is a man. The crux of Puteanus's argument, however, lies in the Aris- totelian notion of virtue, by which he associates creativity and aesthetic value with man by way of Latin etymologies, and so Andreini, by virtue of her art, is a man. The actress's own self-imaging is more subtle. On the one hand, she provides her theater audiences with a clear-cut feminist parody of a stereotypical scene that lands humiliation on the male animal in retribu- tion for acting on his lust. On the other, she appropriates to herself a forceful, dominating authorial perspective that expresses sexual desire for the feminine persona and imitates the fragmentation of the feminine ob- ject typical of that subject position. She leaves unspoken Puteanus's cor- respondence between virtue and masculinity, derived from Poliziano and Guarino, although remnants of this concept lie at the foundation of any Renaissance association of man with art. When literary ideals equating nature and truth with aesthetic value are added to it, however, the result is a less overtly misogynist construct by which art strives toward truth and nature (as the Tassists argued for Gerusalemme liberata), and by which Andreini's representations of women may be seen as divine truth, instructed, as she tells us, by nature. But finally, to draw a tantalizing veil of uncertainty over the entire enterprise of her theatrical art, her self- fashioning, and her attendance to humanistic themes of aesthetic valua- tion and its gendering, Andreini tells us that her writings, like her per- formances, are false and not to be trusted. Like the liar who presents the listener with the impossible conundrum, "I am a liar," so Isabella An- dreini dares us to deny both her powerful, artful image and her playful, practical female nature.</page><page sequence="27">Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman 273 Notes 1. Theodore K. Rabb, The Struggle for Stability in Early Modern Europe (New York: Ox- ford University Press, 1975), would describe this renunciation as a signal of the early- modern era rather than the Renaissance, an argument that I find compelling, but delin- eation of a historical period that recognizes the "birth of opera" as part of a developing aesthetic narrative rather than its rupture, as Rabb does in defining the age from approxi- mately 1500 to the mid-seventeenth century, has yet to be widely accepted in the musi- cological community, and I hesitate to give superficial treatment here to an argument worthy of more detailed consideration. 2.

Comedians some- times enjoyed a longstanding relationship with a single court, as did the Andreini family with the Gonzaga court after Francesco Andreini was made a citizen of Mantua by ducal</page><page sequence="28">274 The Musical Quarterly decree in 1601. The nature of such relationships and their implied obligations, however, was one of fealty rather than beneficence. Even under such circumstances, comedians would enter into contractual arrangements with other rulers, which were understood to take temporary precedence over their long-term responsibilities to their "home" court. 6. Indeed, even Andreini's birthdate is inferred from documentation of her death; Pad- uan officials made and kept baptismal records only after being constrained to do so by decree of the Council of Trent, which met for the first time three years after Andreini was born. 7.

Cusick, "Gendering Modern Music." The late sixteenth century was rife with con- flicts of this type, most pronounced in literary circles, with the quarrels over Ariosto's Orlando furioso, Tasso's Gerusalemme liberata, and especially Guarini's Il pastor fido and its attendant definition of the new genre, pastoral tragicomedy. For an excellent over- view of primary source materials, see Bernhard Weinberg, A History of Literary Criticism in the Italian Renaissance (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1961). 13. As Artusi states in his treatise of 1600, "Do you not know that all the arts and sci- ences have been brought under rules by scholars of the past and that the first elements, rules, and precepts on which they are founded have been handed down to us so that, as long as there is no deviation from them, one person shall be able to understand what an- other says or does? And just as, to avoid confusion in the arts and sciences, it is not per- mitted to every schoolmaster to change the rules bequeathed by Guarino [emphasis mine], nor to every poet to put a long syllable in verse in place of a short one, nor to every arithmetician to corrupt the processes and proofs which are proper to that art, so it is not permitted to everyone who strings notes together to deprave and corrupt music" (trans. Oliver Strunk, rev. Margaret Murata, in The Baroque Era, vol. 4 of Strunk's Source Readings in Music History [New York: Norton, 1998], 25). 14.

Cusick, "Gendering Modern Music," 18. 16. Note, for example, that Cusick's Table 2, labeled "Gendered Oppositions in Late Renaissance Thought," which (erroneously, I would argue) equates man with masculinity and woman with femininity, is derived not from contemporary cultural constructions of order and disorder but solely from modern sources concerning the roles of women in Re- naissance society.

Nam cum tuum istud perspexisse viderer ingenium adiunctis doctrinae ornamentis insigne, te adeo virili animo et opinari et praedicare solebam, ut nihil accidere posset quod non forti et invicto ferres pectore.

Professional Women Musi- cians in Sixteenth-Century Italy," in Women Making Music: The Western Art Tradition, 1150-1950, ed. Jane Bowers and Judith Tick (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1986), 90: "Le donne son venute in eccellenza / Di ciascun'arte ove hanno posto cura; / E qualunque all'istorie abbia avvertenza, I Ne sente ancor la fama non oscura. / Se'l mondo n'P gran tempo stato senza, / Non pero sempre il mal influsso dura; / E forse ascosi han lor debiti onori / L'invidia o il non saper degli scrittori." Newcomb more accurately associ- ates the rise of female singers in Italy, which Cusick attaches to the formation of the con- certo delle donne in Ferrara in the 1580s, with the earlier appearances of singing actresses on stage. 19. Maria de' Medici upheld Florentine support of Spain and in 1619 and 1620 staged two revolts against the French crown's anti-Iberian policies. See Frances A. Yates, As- traea: The Imperial Theme in the Sixteenth Century (London: Pimlico, 1975), 209-11. 20.

See Constance Jordan, Renaissance Feminism: Literary Texts and Political Models (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1990), 134-247. As Susan McClary and others have noted, even women invested with social and political power refashioned their public images in accordance with prevailing masculine orders, and thus Elizabeth I of England was known as "the Virgin Queen" and Catherine de' Medici as Artemisia; see McClary, Feminine Endings, 38, n. 13. 23. Andreini often took charge of the Gelosi's financial negotiations, arranging perfor- mances and accepting payments on behalf of the troupe, as is documented in multiple sources, including Milan, Archivio di Stato, Autografi, cart. 94, fasc. 3, and Paris, Biblio- thbque nationale, Genealogies d'Hozier, piece originale 59, 'Andriny'. Andreini presents a</page><page sequence="31">Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman 277 fascinating foil for female performers like the singing ladies of Ferrara, whose social and economic deficiencies were masked, as Anthony Newcomb has shown, in order to dis- play the semblance of nobility.

Erycius Puteanus, Eryci Puteani, Epistolarum fercula secunda (Hannover: Claudium Marnium &amp; heirs, 1603), 17-19. Puteanus was a pupil of the Belgian humanist Justus Lipsius at Louvain's Trilingual College. Studying history and philology, he received the master of arts degree in 1595 and two years later moved to Milan, where the governor, Juan Hernandez de Velasco, conferred on him a post in classical languages at the Pala- tine school. Puteanus wrote most of his own textbooks and with his treatise Modulata pallas became known as a reformer of the science of music. Puteanus dedicated Modulata pallas to a student of Philippe de Monte, Gian Vincenzo Pinelli, who then invited the classicist to become his secretary in Padua, a position he accepted in 1599. It is likely that Andreini and Puteanus met in this context. In 1624, at the age of fifty, Puteanus re- turned north to succeed Lipsius in the post of headmaster and director of classical letters at Louvain. 25.

Rocke, Forbidden Friendships, chap. 1. Interestingly, and in conformity with the Achillean model of humanist education, the partners identified as "feminine" in homo- sexual relationships, as described by Rocke, were preadolescent boys, and homosexuality, per se, was treated as illicit only when the "feminine" was absent-when both partners were adult men. 34. Andreini, Rime, 171: "Ove si tosto voli / Sogno? Deh, non partire, / Poichi dolce consoli / L'amaro ed angoscioso mio martire. / Se pietosa tu sol Madonna fai / Del mio lungo languire / Cortese ingannator, perchi te n' vai? / Ben e ver, che '1 contento / D'Amor fugge qual nube innanzi al vento." 35.

Similarly, circumstances under which it was deemed inappropriate for the women of the troupe to appear-in Rome, for example, where</page><page sequence="33">Portrait of the Artist as a Young Woman 279 women were restricted from public theatrical performance-resulted in the younger men of the troupe dressing in women's clothes to play the female roles. The homoeroticism latent in these performances, as well as their satirical employment of the suspension of disbelief when transvestite characters transvest again within the context of the play, sug- gests an attitude toward the characterization of masculinity and femininity in Renais- sance drama that is anything but rigidly constructed, although it clearly plays on the gendered hierarchies propounded by academicians like Puteanus and Artusi. 43. Andreini, Rime, 1: "S'alcun sia mai, che i versi miei negletti / Legga, non creda a questi finti ardori, / Che ne le Scene imaginati amori / Usa a trattar con non leali affetti: I// Con bugiardi non men con finti detti / De le Muse spiegai gli alti furori: / Talhor pi- angendo i falsi miei dolori, / Talhor cantando i falsi miei diletti; II// E come ne' Teatri hor Donna, ed hora / Huom fei rappresentando in vario stile / Quanto volle insegnar Natura, et Arte. // Cosi la stella mia seguendo ancora / Di fuggitiva eth nel verde Aprile / Vergai con vario stil ben mille carte." 44.

Maria Luisa Doglio (Lucca: Maria Pacini Fazzi, 1995), 81-99 (act 3, scenes 1-3). Analogous scenes in Guarini's Il pastor fido (act 1, scene 5, and act 2, scene 6) similarly show the nymph, Corisca, playing up to the Satyr's prurient overtures, but he does not believe her, and they quarrel. Locked in a wrestler's hold, Corisca invites the Satyr to tear her head off, if he is strong enough, and she es- capes as he falls hard to the ground, a worthless prosthesis in his hands. Although in- jured by the fall, Guarini's Satyr escapes the humiliation suffered by Andreini's. 51.
